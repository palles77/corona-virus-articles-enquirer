The unavailability of a specific antiviral drug against the chikungunya virus (CHIKV) disease has created an alarming situation to identify or develop potent chemical molecules for remedial management of CHIKV. In the present investigation, in silico studies of dihydrorugosaflavonoid derivatives (5a\u2212f) with non-structural protein-3 (nsP3) were carried out. nsP3 replication protein has recently been considered as a possible antiviral target in which crucial inhibitors fit into the adenosine-binding pocket of the macrodomain. The 4\u2032-halogenated dihydrorugosaflavonoids displayed intrinsic binding with the nsp3 macrodomain (PDB ID: 3GPO) of CHIKV. Compounds 5c and 5d showed docking scores of \u22127.54 and \u22126.86 kcal mol \u22121 , respectively. Various in vitro assays were performed to confirm their (5a\u2212f) antiviral potential against CHIKV. The non-cytotoxic dose was determined by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay and was found to be <100 \u03bcM. The compounds 5c and 5d showed their inhibitory potential for CHIKV, which was determined through cytopathic effect assay and plaque reduction assay, which show inhibition up to 95 and 92% for 70 \u03bcM concentration of the compounds, respectively. The quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction assay result confirmed the ability of 5c and 5d to reduce the viral RNA level at 70 \u03bcM concentration of compounds to nearly 95 and 93% concentration, respectively, in cells with CHIKV infection. Further, the CHIKV-inhibitory capacity of these compounds was corroborated by execution of immunofluorescence assay. The executed work will be meaningful for the future research of studied dihydrorugosaflavonoids against prime antiviral entrants, leading to remedial management to preclude CHIKV infection.",

Infections are not only limited to Asia and Africa; recently, the epidemics of chikungunya have been reported from Central and South America. 1, 2 Concerning the data obtained from the National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme (NVBDCP, India), the number of infected people identified in April 2018 was 9175, 4875 from Karnataka following 1375 from Gujarat and 966 from Maharashtra. Earlier research studies have shown that there is considerable resource burden from chikungunya outbreaks, which escalates in monsoon and post-monsoon seasons. Therefore, cases of chikungunya viral fever have increased in the continent of Asia and various parts of the world. The name chikungunya originates from \"Makonde\", meaning \"to become twisted\". It denotes the \"curved\" appearance of those going through joint ache as a result of chikungunya infection. Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) spreads by mosquito vectors Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus. The common eukaryotic hosts are primates and humans. In humans, the symptoms associated with CHIKV are nausea, fever, joint pain, vomiting, rashes, and persistent arthralgia.",

Alphaviruses are configured as enveloped positivesense single-stranded RNA viruses. There are 29 members in the alphavirus genus; some members of the genus contain several animal and human viruses like Ross River virus, Sindbis virus (SINV), Western equine encephalitis virus (WEEV), Semiliki Forest virus (SFV), Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV), etc. They are furthermore categorized into Old World and New World viruses reliant on the changes that occurred in their life cycle, fatality, and clinical manifestations. Basically, the Old World viruses CHIKV, SINV, SFV, etc. engage the protein nsp2 to downregulate the host cell transcription, have less demise percentage, and stimulate arthralgia. The New World viruses VEEV, WEEV, etc. use virus capsid protein (CP) to downregulate the host cell transcription, have high casualty frequency, and generate encephalitis.",

Trimers of E1 and E2 (surface glycoproteins) heterodimers build up every spike. 15 CHIKV bears a genome of almost \u223c11.7 kb, polyadenylated at the 3\u2032 end and capped at the 5\u2032 end. The non-structural polyproteins (nsP1234) are encoded by the 5\u2032 two-third open reading frame (ORF) of the genome. The three chief structural proteins (capsid (C), E1, and E2) are encoded by the 3\u2032 one-third ORF of the genome. 16 The functioning of non-structural protein (nsP) promotes the construction of distinct mature non-structural proteins (nsp1\u2212 4). nsP1 is the capping enzyme, nsP2 is the viral helicase and protease, and nsP4 is RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, which has an intrinsically disordered N-terminal domain. 17 The role of nsP3 was not very well defined. However, recently, McPherson et al. 18 have reported that CHIKV's nsP3 macrodomain hydrolyzes ADP-ribose groups from mono-(ADP-ribosyl)ated proteins and the activity of nsP3 mono-(ADP-ribosyl)hydrolase is somewhere decisive for CHIKV replication and virulence in mice. At the N-terminus, nsP3 encompasses a very preserved MacroD-type macrodomain. The protein fold in the macrodomain is remarkably conserved, which is present in numerous plus-strand RNA viruses, and it attaches to ADP-ribose. Mutant viruses missing hydrolase activity were incapable of replicating in mammalian BHK-21 cells or mosquito, A. albopictus, cells and quickly regressed the catalytically inactivated mutants.",

The nsP3 has three key domains, a central zinc-binding region, a very conserved Nterminal macrodomain, and a poorly conserved, not properly structured acidic and highly phosphorylated C-terminal domain. The functions of various cellular proteins to influence signaling, stress granule assembly, and viral replication are controlled by the C-terminal domain. 35, 36 The exact role of the central zinc-binding region and N-terminal macrodomain is not well categorized. Macrodomains are known to have a conserved protein fold detected from archaea to higher eukaryotes considered for their affinity to the small molecule ADP-ribose and its analogues. In positive-strand RNA viruses such as alphaviruses, coronaviruses, and hepatitis E virus, the macrodomains are the integral part of the nsPs. 37\u221246 According to Rungrotmongkol et al., 47 the molecular understanding of the particular binding of ADP-ribose to the CHIKV nsP3 macrodomain revealed that nsP3 amino acids Asp 10, Ile 11, Asn 24, Asp 31, Gly 32, Val 33, Cys 34, Ser 110\u2212Tyr 114, Val 133, and Arg 144 act as the critical residues in the binding pocket, which make molecular contacts with the ligand.

Therefore, to evaluate the inhibitory potential of halogenated dihydrorugosaflavonoids against CHIKV, the antiviral assays were performed using Vero cell lines by observing the cytopathic effect (CPE), plaque reduction assay, the quantification of the viral genome RNA by qRT-PCR, and using immunofluorescence imaging. ADME/T Analysis. In the process of drug discovery development, various rules were considered but suffered various limitations. 48 Therefore, a combination of pharmacodynamics (PD) and pharmacokinetics (PK), which explains the interaction of an organism with the drug, is important to be studied. PD evaluates what the drug does to the body, and PK explains how body responds to the drug. The main components of PK are absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME), finally associated with toxicity (ADMET). Although ADME properties explain the utmost pharmacological performance of small molecules, the toxicology study ensures no injury to the organism with no side effects. According to Hodgson, \"A chemical cannot be a drug, no matter how active nor how specific its action, unless it is also taken appropriately into the body (absorption), distributed to the right parts of the body, metabolized in a way that does not instantly remove its activity, and eliminated in a suitable manner\ue0d5a drug must get in, move about, hang around, and then get out\". 49 Haplessly, to address all of these parameters is time-consuming and cumbersome due to the intricacy of human body, where all of these parameters affect each other. It has not only limitations to interactions within the body but also several restrictions due to gender, age, genetic state, disease, etc. In this case, in silico technologies can be helpful to compute these calculations based on the mathematical algorithm used in the in silico software. Although it does not give full guaranty that it is going to work 100% in the living system, it saves our time in the selection of molecule to be considered for further studies. Therefore, ADME/T properties were studied using Qikprop software of Maestro.",

The 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay is dependent on the reaction of water-soluble compound (MTT) with an insoluble formazan product by viable cells with active metabolic activity. Thus, the color produced due to the formation of formazan is a suitable marker of only viable cells. Different concentrations of the 5c and 5d compounds were assessed by MTT assay at 24 h. Both compounds did not display toxicity up to 85 \u03bcM as >70% of Vero cells were viable (Figure 3a,b) . Half-maximal cytotoxicity (CC 50 ) was calculated from the plotted graph and represented as a dotted line. So, all of the antiviral assays were performed using 30\u221270 \u03bcM concentration of both the compounds.",

The EC 50 of 5c compound was 26.14 \u03bcM (Figure 4a ) with a selectivity index (CC 50 / EC 50 ) of 4.33 (CC 50 = 113.4 \u03bcM (Figure 3a) ). The EC 50 of 5d compound was 28.39 \u03bcM (Figure 4b ; selectivity index = 4.19; CC 50 = 119 \u03bcM (Figure 3b) ). The reported EC 50 values are the means of two experiments, which are performed in triplicates. It clearly shows that 4\u2032-halogenated dihydrorugosaflavonoids (5c and 5d) possess better inhibitory potential than other substituted dihydrorugosaflavonoid compounds for CHIKV.",
