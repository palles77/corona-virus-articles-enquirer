In the early phase of the illness and after adjusting for baseline characteristics, SARS patients were less likely to have lower respiratory symptoms (e.g. sputum production, shortness of breath, chest pain) and more likely to have myalgia (p < 0.001). SARS patients had lower mean leukocyte and neutrophil counts (p<0.0001) and more commonly had \"ground-glass\" radiological changes with no pleural effusion. Despite having a younger average age, SARS patients had a more aggressive respiratory course requiring admission to the ICU and a higher mortality rate. The area under the receiver operator characteristic curve for predicting SARS when all variables were considered was 0.983. Using a cutoff score of >99, the sensitivity was 89.1% (95%CI 82.0-94.0) and the specificity was 98.0% ). The area under the receiver operator characteristic curve for predicting SARS when all variables except radiological change were considered was 0.933. Using a cutoff score of >8, the sensitivity was 80.7% (95% CI 72.4-87.3) and the specificity was 94.5% (95%CI 90.9-96.9). Certain clinical manifestations and laboratory changes may help to distinguish SARS from other influenza-like illnesses. Scoring systems may help identify patients who should receive more specific tests for influenza or SARS.",

It has been postulated that improvement of diagnostic guidelines specific to SARS would be much more costeffective than testing with PCR assays; establishing an alternative diagnosis by influenza testing is another costeffective strategy [17] .

            "text": "This study shows that the early clinical and laboratory presentation of patients with SARS differed significantly from that of patients with other common causes of viral respiratory tract infection and pneumonia. Although fever was common in cases of both SARS and non-SARS viral pneumonia, other systemic symptoms such as chills, malaise, and rigors were less common in non-SARS viral infections. Upper and lower respiratory symptoms were more common in non-SARS cases. Patients with non- SARS viral infections had higher systolic blood pressures and respiratory rates, and lower oxygen saturation readings than patients with SARS, which may reflect older age and premorbid status rather than pneumonia itself. The clinical diagnosis of pneumonia was supported by significant radiological changes more commonly in patients with SARS than non-SARS infection. Total leukocyte and neutrophil counts were higher in non-SARS viral pneumonia, but mean lymphocyte counts, although depressed, did not help discriminate among different etiologies. A recent study indicated that the absolute neutrophil count is discriminative between patients with SARS and those with other causes of community-acquired pneumonia [10] . In contrast, our study included only non-SARS viral etiologies. The routine total leukocyte and neutrophil counts may potentially be of use in excluding SARS and should be evaluated further. SARS can be confused with influenza [1-5, 24, 25] . In fact, during work-up for any patient considered to be at high risk for SARS epidemiologically, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends routine testing for influenza A and B [22] . This is the first study to compare the clinical, laboratory and radiological features of SARS to those of influenza. It demonstrated that certain features are more commonly seen among SARS patients; if these are seen, SARS-CoV testing is probably indicated in the correct epidemiological setting [22] . On the other hand, specific SARS-CoV testing for all cases of acute febrile respiratory illness is not cost-effective and can cause social disruption due to the false-positive and false-negative results these tests can produce; this is especially true in the absence of worldwide transmission, since the prevalence of SARS is extremely low. Establishing an alternative diagnosis is a reasonable strategy and is likely to be more cost-effective [16] . This is especially important under the current threat of another pandemic flu. Although it is possible for a patient to have coincident SARS and influenza infections, the combination is unlikely. Nevertheless, during coincident SARS and influenza outbreaks, we cannot rule out the possibility that a patient may contract both. Since patients in both groups of our study attended the emergency department within the first few days of illness, it is likely that the clinical and laboratory differences are not simply a result of measurements being taken at different times during the course of illness. Nevertheless, the present study had several limitations. First, it was conducted at a single centre, so the applicability of our findings may vary depending upon the relative prevalence of the etiological agent during any particular period. Second, we compared patients with known SARS or non-SARS viral infection, while this status is not typically known in presenting patients. Third, viral illness follows temporal patterns, so single data measurements obtained during the epidemic may not allow for temporal variation; however, our study did focus on a similarly early period in the course of the illness. Fourth, the radiological assessment of SARS cases in 2003 was not as thorough as that conducted for patients in 2004. During the SARS outbreak, the high infectivity of the disease and the large number of patients limited some of the assessments. Only frontal radiographs were performed for most patients, and many radiographs were performed with mobile units. In some cases, film handling was minimized and only digital images were reviewed. Nevertheless, chest radiographs and assessments were performed following an established standard protocol. Our non-SARS group may not be representative since they were hospitalized patients. Non-hospitalized influenza cases may resemble SARS even more closely.",

The overall mortality was, nonetheless, the same for both groups, despite the higher mean age of patients in the non-SARS group. Although there are clinical, laboratory and radiological differences between SARS and commonly occurring non-SARS viral respiratory infections, specific influenza testing is still important since these conditions can mimic each other clinically, despite their differences. This is especially important given the threat of another influenza pandemic.",
