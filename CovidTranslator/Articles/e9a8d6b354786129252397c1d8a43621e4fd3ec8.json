            "text": "Little information is available on persistent infection of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (CoV). In this study, we established persistent infection of SARS-CoV in the Vero E6 cell line. Acute infection of Vero E6 with SARS-CoV produced a lytic infection with characteristic rounding cytopathic effects (CPE) and the production of a large number of infectious particles in the culture fluid within 3 days post-infection. Upon subsequent culturing of the remaining adherent cells, the cells gradually proliferated and recovered normal morphology similar to that of the parental cells, and continued to produce large numbers of infectious viral particles during the observation period of 5 months. Among a total of 87 cell clones obtained from the persistently infected Vero E6, only four cell clones (named #13, #18, #21, and #34) were positive for viral RNA. Clones #13, #18, and #34 shifted to viral RNA-negative during subsequent cultures, while #21 continuously produced infectious particles at a high rate. The SARS-CoV receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, was almost completely down regulated from the cell surface of persistently infected cells. Western blot analysis as well as electron microscopy indicated that the ratios of spike to nucleocapsid protein in clone #21 as well as its parental persistently infected cells were lower than that in the cells in the acute phase of infection. These Vero E6 cells persistently infected with SARS-CoV may be useful for clarifying the mechanism of the persistent infection and also for elucidating the possible pathophysiologic significance of such long-term maintenance of this virus.",

The S protein of this virus was shown to be sufficient for the binding to this receptor molecule [8, 9] . ACE2 is expressed in many tissues, including epithelia of the lung and small intestine [10, 11] . Indeed, pathological characterization of several autopsied tissues from SARS-CoV-infected individuals also revealed viral signals only in the restricted tis-Abbreviations: ACE2, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2; CoV, coronavirus; dpi, day post-infection; E, envelope; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; GAPDH, glyceraldehydes-3-phosphate dehydrogenase gene; HRP, horseradish peroxidase; IF, immunofluorescence; M, membrane; MAb, monoclonal antibody; MHV, murine hepatitis virus; MOI, multiplicity of infection; N, nucleocapsid; PAb, polyclonal antibody; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; RT, reverse transcriptase; S, spike; SARS, severe acute respiratory syndrome; TCID, tissue culture infectious dose; TTBS, Tris-buffered saline containing Tween 20. sues such as lung and small intestine [11, 12] . Interestingly, the SARS-CoV-infected ileal and colonic mucosa appeared normal at the microscopic level and no viral inclusion bodies could be detected in the intestinal biopsies obtained from a SARS patient [13] or in fatal cases of SARS [14] . Recent examination of seven ACE2-positive cell lines of human intestinal origin for SARS-CoV infection revealed that only one cell line (LoVo) was sensitive to infection without CPE [15] . This culture seems to accord with the histopathologic findings in intestinal samples from patients [13, 14] . In sharp contrast to the LoVo cell line, the Vero E6 cell line undergoes a lytic infection with characteristic refractile rounding CPE [16, 17] that seem to correspond to the features of multinucleated pneumocytes resulting from local replication of SARS-CoV in the lungs of patients [11, 12] .",

Murine CoVs, especially mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), induce hepatitis, enteritis, and encephalitis in mice. The pathogenic effects vary with the virus strain, route of infection, and the strain, age, and immune status of the host mice [18] [19] [20] . Persistent infection of MHV can be established in immunosuppressed or neonatal animals [21] [22] [23] [24] . Also, MHV causes both lytic and persistent infections in a variety of murine cultured cell lines and in these persistent infections, the cells produce virus variants with defective or aberrant phenotypes [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] . On the other hand, human CoVs such as 229E and OC43 are also responsible not only for common colds [32, 33] but also pneumonia, meningitis, diarrhea [34, 35] , as well as central nervous disorders [36, 37] . Persistent infections of these human CoVs can be established in human neuronal cell lines [38, 39] .",

After the production of the progeny particles, the host cells die via an apoptotic mechanism [40, 41] . This host cell killing in the acute phase seems to be the typical course for this virus. In this study, we examined the possible establishment of persistent infection of SARS-CoV in Vero E6 cells. The results showed that Vero E6 could survive the acute infection with SARS-CoV, and the survivor cells allowed long-term persistence of this virus, although serial continuous passages resulted in a gradual decrease of the viral RNA-positive cell population. Upon cell cloning of the persistently infected cell population, only 1 out of 87 cell clones obtained was a long-term producer of infectious virus particles at a high rate, with aberrant expression of S protein.",

As shown in Fig. 2 , most of the Vero E6 cells were viral antigen-positive on the 1st and 2nd days. The cells that did not undergo rounding on day 3 were also viral antigenpositive, although only a fraction of the cells were positive: 70.8%, 67.4%, 45.0%, 39.0%, 39.4%, and 39.5% on days 1-6, respectively. By co-staining with Hoechst 33258, it was found that most of such surviving cells with expression of viral antigens contained no apparent apoptotic bodies inside them (Fig. 2) . Next, the culture supernatants harvested daily from the infected Vero E6 cells were subjected to infectivity titration and also to antigen-capture ELISA using anti-SARS-CoV guinea-pig PAb and murine (2G3) MAb, as shown by TCID 50 per ml and absorption at 492 nm, respectively (Fig. 3) . The viral production rate was the highest (10 7.5 TCID 50 per ml) on days 2-3 (Fig. 3A) . After the cells were replaced in fresh medium on day 3, the surviving cells also continued to produce infectious virus particles at a high rate, near 10 7 TCID 50 per ml (Fig. 3A) . A similar particle production pattern was also observed by antigen-capture ELISA (Fig. 3B) . The guinea-pig PAb recognizes SARS-CoV proteins, including S and N proteins (as described below), whereas murine 2G3 MAb recognizes the SARS-CoV S protein (data not shown). Thus, these surviving, viral antigen-positive Vero E6 cells were shown to be persistently infected with SARS-CoV, so this cell population was named Vero/SARS-CoV. The Vero/SARS-CoV cells came to show a similar morphology and cell proliferation rate as the parental Vero E6 cells upon subsequent continuous passaging of the cells. However, the percentage of the cells positive for SARS-CoV antigens gradually decreased to~10% by 5 months after infection.",

The Vero E6 and CaCo-2 cells were similarly infected at an MOI of 1 with SARS-CoV in the culture fluid of acutely infected Vero E6 cells and that in the culture fluid of #21 cells. The RNA extracted from the infected cells on days 0 (just after adsorption) and 10 were analyzed for viral genomic RNA levels by RT-PCR using primers at 1ab region. The results showed that the amounts of PCR products on day 10 samples were almost similar between SARS-CoV at acute and persistent phases, although those on day 0 samples were apparently higher in the SARS-CoV at acute phase than that at persistent phase in both Vero E6 and CaCo-2 cells. Thus, the adsorption rate may be different between SARS-CoV pre-pared at acute and persistent phases, but the subsequent replication rate of the virus from persistent phase was almost similar to that from acute phase.",

The results by triplicate experiments showed a slightly higher ratio of the S/N ratio in acutely infected Vero E6 cells, compared with Vero/SARS-CoV and #21 cells, i.e. 0.95 \u00b1 0.15, 0.24 \u00b1 0.05, and 0.30 \u00b1 0.17, respectively. Next, Western blotting was also carried out to confirm the differences in the expression of viral proteins among the same acutely infected Vero E6 cells, Vero/SARS-CoV, and #21 (Fig. 9B ). The cell fractions as well as the virus particle fractions precipitated from the culture media by ultracentrifugation were characterized. Western blotting using the cell fractions and guinea-pig anti-SARS-CoV PAb revealed lower amounts of S protein in Vero/SARS-CoV and #21 compared with that in acutely infected cells. However, the amounts of N protein in Vero/SARS-CoV and #21 cells were similar to that in the acutely infected cells. Similarly, rabbit PAb to the N-terminus region of SARS-CoV S protein also detected a higher amount of the S protein in the acutely infected cells than those in #21. Rabbit PAb to the C-terminus region of SARS-CoV N protein detected the N protein in the acutely infected cells and Vero/SARS-CoV and a rather lower amount of N proteins in #21. The S/N ratios by triplicate experiments using rabbit anti-S and anti-N PAbs were 0.81 \u00b1 8.080 in the acutely infected cells and 0.059 \u00b1 0.014 in the Vero/SARS-CoV.

This different S/N ratio was also similarly observed in uncloned, parental persistently SARS-CoVinfected Vero E6 cells, suggesting the universality of this difference in persistently infected Vero E6 cells. Similar observations have been reported for other CoVs: a number of MHV variants with deletions in the S glycoprotein have been isolated from persistently MHV-infected animals; however, the significance of generating and potentially accumulating deletion variants in the persistent viral population remains unclear, although it has been proposed that the complexity of the population of persisting viral RNAs may contribute to chronic disease [49, 50] . Interestingly, the cultured cells persistently infected with MHV were shown to be resistant to superinfection with MHV but not to infection with other unrelated viruses [51] . When the culturing of cells persistently infected with MHV was carried out for >400 passages, the yield of released virus gradually decreased and only~10% of the cells were viral antigen-positive at passage 97 [51] , which was similar to the pattern we observed for SARS-CoV in this study.

In contrast, we were able to obtain several virus-positive cell clones by culturing a single Vero/SARS-CoV cell in the wells of 96-well microplates. In human neuronal cell lines persistently infected with human CoV OC43 and 229E, there were no important common viralgenome mutations related to the persistent infection [38, 39] . On the other hand, using bovine CoV it was found that a translation-attenuating intraleader open reading frame was selected in this virus mRNA during persistent infection [52, 53] . In this study, we found that the persistently infected cells maintained the expression of SARS-CoV antigens for at least 5 months during maintenance without cell cloning, while most of the cell clones prepared from Vero/SARS-CoV cells were negative for virus RNA by RT-PCR. Several cell clones positive for virus RNA at early passages after the preparation also readily shifted to become negative, suggesting that a certain host cell factor(s) may be involved in the maintenance of SARS-CoV in the Vero E6 cells during the uncloned condition. In addition, such host factor, probably together with other factor(s), may be also involved in a long-term maintenance of SARS-CoV even in the cloned condition such as in #21. It is noteworthy that the SARS-CoV S to N ratio in persistently infected cells was significantly lower than that in acutely infected cells. Electron microscopic observation also supported this conclusion, as shown by the much lower density of the \"knob\" structures in persistently than acutely infected Vero E6 cells. In fact, we identified a total of 5 nucleotide substitutions at S gene, but no substitution at N gene in the viral RNA from #21 cell clone. However, we found no apparent difference in the replication rates in Vero E6 and CaCo-2 cells between SARS-CoV prepared from acutely and persistently infected Vero E6 cells. We will need further studies to clarify the correlation between the S/N ratio and the establishment of persistent infection with this virus.",

However, on the basis of Western blotting using sera obtained from a total of 43 patients with SARS that were obtained 7-35 days after the onset of fever, most (79%) of the patients produced antibodies to N protein, but only 40% produced antibodies to S protein [55] .

Thus, lymphocytes might be resistant to SARS-CoV infection in vivo. Nevertheless, evidence of SARS-CoV infection in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) was reported. RT-PCR is a relatively rapid and sensitive method for the diagnosis of patients with SARS symptoms using patient-derived samples such as nasopharyngeal aspirates [57, 58] . One trial to standardize the sample source for quantification of SARS-CoV used plasma and PBMC derived from patients at three SARS stages: days 1-7, 13-39, and 79-91 after fever onset [59] . The viral RNA was detectable even in PBMC, where its level was higher than that in plasma at all clinical stages. The peak of the shedding of SARS-CoV corresponded to the peak of the course of SARS-CoV infection. Surprisingly, residual SARS-CoV may persist in a patient's circulation, in most cases for a relatively long time without obvious effects on the host. The viral loads in the plasma were not significantly different in the samples obtained at days 13-39 and 79-91. Thus, some cells, including PBMC, may be a reservoir for this virus, although the pathophysiologic significance of such persistently infected cells is not clear yet. In addition, the recent finding that dendritic cells can take up SARS-CoV and transfer it to susceptible target cells seems to be important, since such dendritic cells may serve as a reservoir that might provide long-term exposure to this virus and contribute to the persistence and chronicity of infection [9] . The above observations, together with the fact that other CoVs readily establish persistent infections in vivo and in vitro, and also together with our establishment of persistent infection in the Vero E6 cell line after induction of severe CPE, suggest that complete elimination of SARS-CoV from all patients who have recovered from SARS seems to be unlikely.
