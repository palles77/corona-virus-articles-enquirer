Sal-06mAb belonging to IgG1 isotype demonstrated broad cross-reactivity to standard and isolated strains of genus Salmonella and others such as Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumonia, and Proteus mirabilis. Cross-reactivity across several bacterial genera indicated that the epitopes reactive to Sal-06mAb are conserved among these members. Neutralizing effects of Sal-06mAb on Salmonella growth and survival was evaluated in vitro using bacteriostatic and bactericidal activity with and without complement and bacterial invasion inhibition assay. Sal-06mAb demonstrated a bacteriostatic effect on the growth of S. typhimurium ATCC 14028 strain which is both time and concentration (of mAb) dependent. It was also found that the bacterial growth inhibition was complement independent. When the bacterial cells were preincubated with Sal-06mAb, it reduced the adherence and invasion of bacterial cells into A549 epithelial cell line. This was confirmed by CFU count analysis, phase contrast, and fluorescence microscopy. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) imaging confirmed the antimicrobial effects of Sal-06mAb on S. typhimurium ATCC 14028. The development of broadly reactive and cross protective Sal-06mAb opens new possibilities for immunotherapy of sepsis caused by Gram-negative Enterobacteriaceae members.",

Salmonella is commonly found in intestinal tract of humans and animals and therefore presence of Salmonella in food and raw materials is an indication of fecal contamination. Certain non-typhoidal Salmonella strains are responsible for bloodstream infections which are referred to as invasive non-typhoidal Salmonella (INTS) infections. The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) published that Salmonella enterocolitis resulted in~95.1 million cases and 50,771 deaths in 2017. The symptoms are not typical of diarrhea and present as febrile illness with higher fatality rate (Stanaway et al. 2019) . The disease burden is disproportionate affecting adults or children with weak immune system. Intervention and control of the infection depends on rapid detection of these pathogens followed by appropriate therapeutic interventions.",

            "text": "Selection of right virulence factors as target for therapeutic intervention plays a key role in disease control. Several studies have shown that outer membrane proteins (OMPs) of bacteria are strong immunogenic components and possible vaccine candidates (Babu et al. 2017; Abadi et al. 2018; Neema and Karunasagar 2008) . Outer membrane proteins include integral membrane proteins as well as lipoproteins that are anchored to the outer membrane via N terminally attached lipid. Generally, OMPs are characterized by \u03b2-barrel structures and integral OMPs are essential for maintaining the integrity and selective permeability of bacterial membranes (Lin et al. 2002) . Some of them serve as adhesins and play an important role in virulence (Ebanks et al. 2005; Khushiramani et al. 2008) . Outer membrane proteins are extremely immunogenic (Li et al. 2014 ) and therefore they would be effective candidates for vaccine and diagnostic development owing to their exposed epitopes on the cell surface. The OMPs of Salmonella are also known to have a significant role in eliciting immune response (Meenakshi et al. 1999) . They have been considered potential candidates for conferring protection against typhoid. Salmonella OMPs have been investigated as potential vaccine candidates, virulence factors, and diagnostic antigens (Isibasi et al. 1988 ). Therefore, generation of antibodies specific against surface and structural components might prevent establishment of infection.",

The growth has resumed after~6 h of inoculation, where as in control wells with bacteria and no mAb, the growth resumed immediately. As we decreased the mAb concentration, the time lapse between the control wells and mAb-treated wells was decreasing. To confirm the specificity of inhibitory effect Sal-06mAb to Salmonella, Salmonella cells were treated with 120 \u03bcg of a control mAb (mouse monoclonal antihistidine antibody-Sigma Aldrich) which did not affect the growth of bacteria from that of untreated control.

Control cells were intact, homogenous, and turgid with smooth membrane (Fig. 9A ). Monoclonal antibody-treated Salmonella cells showed severe morphological alterations such as flaccid/squashed cells with uneven wrinkles, protuberances and craters, and collapsed membrane with disrupted cell contents (Fig. 9B) . Addition of mouse complement did not favor these morphological damages at bacteriostatic concentrations of monoclonal antibody. Increasing the incubation time promoted damage of cell membranes by mAb (Fig.  9C ). From this, we inferred that Sal-06mAb was able to bind outer membrane proteins and was disrupting the integrity of cell membrane.",

            "text": "Globally, Salmonella is the predominant cause of typhoidal and non-typhoidal gastroenteritis infections leading to significant mortality and morbidity (Liu et al. 2018) . Non-typhoidal Salmonella alone causes~93 million cases of gastroenteritis worldwide annually (Eng et al. 2015) . Emergence of multidrug-resistant strains has limited the antibiotic treatment options. Vaccines present an attractive approach to control and prevent Salmonella-associated diseases. Several of the reported vaccines are only experimental or are presently under development. Reports from animal and human studies support the possibility of a safe and effective vaccine against invasive non-typhoidal Salmonella. Studies from animal models demonstrated the efficacy with O-antigens, flagellin proteins, and outer membrane proteins of typhimurium and enteritidis serovars (Tennant et al. 2016) . Though the live attenuated vaccines are able to confer cross protection, the risk of virulence restoration in immune-compromised individuals is limiting their use (Haesebrouck et al. 2004) . This led to focus on developing novel and alternative antimicrobial therapies offering high specificity, improved safety, less toxicity, broad immunity, and cross-protective efficacy against broad Salmonella serovars. Passive immunization has been utilized successfully as a suitable alternative to conventional antibiotic therapy against several gastrointestinal pathogens such as Salmonella, Campylobacter, Escherichia coli, and rotavirus (Esmailnejad et al. 2019; Rahimi et al. 2007 ). Antibodies exert their antimicrobial activity through binding and blocking the pathogen entry, neutralization, inhibiting growth, replication and dissemination, and membrane damage (Peddayelachagiri et al. 2014; Kovacs-Nolan and Mine 2004; Esmailnejad et al. 2019) . Monoclonal antibodies have found their way in immunodiagnostics, pathogen identification, prevention, and therapeutic applications. Administration of monoclonal antibodies raised against conserved antigens of Enterobacteriaceae members might confer a neutralizing effect by antibodydependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) effect. Several earlier studies have explored the possibility of immunotherapy utilizing cross-reactive monoclonal antibodies against broad range of Enterobacteriaceae pathogens. A murine monoclonal antibody (WN1 222-5) capable of binding to LPS of E. coli and Salmonella has shown in vitro and in vivo cross-protective activity against LPS-induced lethality in mouse model (Di Padova et al., 1993) . In another study, two monoclonal antibodies ST-1 and 10-5-6 directed against the Opolysaccharide of S. typhimurium LPS provided significant protection against the lethal challenge with homologous S. typhimurium strains (SR-11 and LT-2) in the C3H/HeN mice (Colwell et al., 1984) . Michetti et al. (1992) reported the protective efficacy of a secretory IgA challenge by an invasive S. typhimurium by immune exclusion at the mucosal surface.",

            "text": "In a similar study, permanent secretion of mucosal IgA (mAb 177E6) directed specifically against O:9 antigen into the respiratory tract through a backpack tumor model protected 50% of animals challenged with high dose of S. enteritidis strain through intranasal route (Iankov et al., 2004) . Our work is in agreement with the above studies wherein a cross-reactive, surface protein targeted monoclonal antibody can neutralize the pathogen, thereby blocking its entry into the cells. Sal-06 monoclonal antibody was reactive to several species of Salmonella on dot ELISA and western blot analysis. Since several members of the family Enterobacteriaceae are closely related in structure, composition, and virulence mechanisms, we tested the cross-reactivity of Sal-06 monoclonal antibody on other members of genus such as Klebsiella, Proteus, Escherichia, and Enterobacter. The monoclonal body showed strong cross-reactivity with K. pneumonia, P. vulgaris, and E. coli indicating shared epitopes among these organisms. These cross-reactive pathogens are also of great clinical significance. Western blot analysis revealed the size similarity of cross-reactive antigen among the tested pathogens with that of Salmonella members. Antigen reactive to the Sal-06mAb was assumed to be of proteinaceous in nature and not a lipopolysaccharide (LPS) based on the distinct banding pattern of reactivity as opposed to ladder-like formation usually associated with LPS (Peddayelachagiri et al. 2014) . Antibodies directed against bacterial surface components might prevent pathogen from establishing infection by blocking their binding sites, adhesion, and invasion into host cells. This effect is reflected in vitro on the rate of growth and survival of the bacteria. We observed that under in vitro conditions, the Sal-06mAb inhibited the growth of actively dividing Salmonella bacteria for more than 4 h at 60 \u03bcg quantity. We assume that such effect under in vivo conditions would be sufficient to induce opsonization and pathogen neutralization. This hypothesis needs to be studied in vivo in suitable animal model. In Sal-06mAb, the mAbs bound to the pathogen surface and blocked their invasion into the A549 epithelial cell line. Adhesion of Fig. 9 Study of the effect of Sal-06mAb on morphology of S. typhimurium by a scanning electron microscope. a) Salmonella bacteria without mAb incubation (control). b) Salmonella cells incubated with Sal-06mAb for 1 h. c) Salmonella cells incubated with Sal-06mAb for 2 h bacteria to the cell surface is the primary step in the establishment of infection. Prevention of bacterial invasion is promising in prevention of establishment of pat hogenesis (Peddayelachagiri et al. 2014 ). Further, Sal-06 being an IgG1 subclass of mAb might display potent neutralization and phagocytic killing ability in vivo. SEM studies further complemented our assumptions of the surface location of antigen specific to Sal-06. In electron micrographs, it was clearly evident that mAb bound to surface epitopes and induced osmotic lysis of the bacterial cells which demonstrate its partial bacteriostatic action.",
