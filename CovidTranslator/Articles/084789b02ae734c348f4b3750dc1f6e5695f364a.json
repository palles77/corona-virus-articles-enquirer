Nevertheless, there are countries, with a rapid increase and a high number of cases, with a lack of studies. This is the case of Iran in the Middle East. For these reasons, we have developed epidemiological maps of cases but also of incidence rates using official populations, by provinces, for COVID-19 in Iran using geographical information systems (GIS).",

All the provinces have been affected, and rates ranged from 0.8 (Boushehr) to 61.8 cases/100,000 population (Qom) (Fig. 1 ). At Qom, the first two cases were reported. COVID-19 arrived at Iran from China. The highest number of cases have been reported in Tehran, 1945 ( Fig. 1) , followed by Qom, 712, and by Mazandaran, with 633. Qom is the border with Markazi and Semnan, provinces with rates from 27.2 to 34.9 cases/100,000 population. From the GIS-based maps, it is clear that spreading in the country is occurring from north-central provinces such as Tehran and Qom. Till March 9, 2020, there have been 237 deaths (3.31%, case fatality rate). While the number of cases seems to decrease during the last three days, this is not occurring with fatalities ( Fig. 1) .",

Even if it were considered that all imported cases of Iran were identified in all states with certainty, the \"best case\" outbreak size was substantial (1820, 95% CI: 380-5320 cases), and far higher than reported case counts in February 2020. All confirmed cases in Saudi Arabia are imported from Iran and one from Iraq and other cases are close contacts to those confirmed cases. Imported cases from Iran have been diagnosed at Kuwait, Bahrain, Iraq, Oman, Qatar, among other Asiatic countries, but also Georgia, Estonia, Belarus, and even New Zealand [6] . The capital city of Khorasan Razavi (3.1 cases/100,000 population), Mashhad, is the second-largest holy city in the world, attracting more than 20 million tourists and pilgrims every year [7, 8] , many of whom come to pay homage to the Imam Reza shrine (the eighth Shi'ite Imam).",
