In this study, we report the development of an integrated isothermal device for both amplification and detection of targeted HBV DNA. It has two major components, a disposable polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) micro-reactor and a temperature-regulated optical detection unit (base apparatus) for real-time monitoring of the turbidity changes due to the precipitation of DNA amplification by-product, magnesium pyrophosphate. We have established a correlation curve (R 2 = 0.99) between the concentration of pyrophosphate ions and the level of turbidity by using a simulated chemical reaction to evaluate the characteristics of our device. For the applications of rapid pathogens detection, we also have established a standard curve (R 2 = 0.96) by using LAMP reaction with a standard template in our device. Moreover, we also have successfully used the device on seven clinical serum specimens where HBV DNA levels have been confirmed by real-time PCR. The result indicates that different amounts of HBV DNA can be successfully detected by using this device within 1 h.",

At present, serologic diagnosis of HBV infections is based on the viral antigens and antibodies. However, the REVEAL-HBV (risk evaluation of viral load elevation and associated liver disease/cancer-hepatitis B virus) study indicates that the serum level of HBV DNA ( 10,000 copies/ml) is a strong risk predica-tor of hepatocellular carcinoma or cirrhosis [2, 3] . It would thus be clinically valuable to have a molecular diagnostic method for screening and monitoring the progress of hepatitis. However, the long reaction time of traditional PCR amplification and the high cost of thermalcycler are still major issues for such a screening application. Therefore, it is important to develop a rapid and accurate diagnostic device for field applications as soon as possible [4] .",

There are several PCR-based amplification methods [5] , such as nucleic acid sequence-based amplification [6] and self-sustained sequence replication, for nucleic acid amplification. However, these methods require a precise instrument to provide the efficient thermal cycles and to shorten the total amplification time for a test run. In general, it takes up to 2.5 h for a PCR test with the present state of art equipment. Alternatively, isothermal amplification methods, e.g., strand displacement amplification [7] , branched DNA amplification, invader, rolling circle amplification [8] and loop-mediated amplification method (LAMP) [9] , have been proposed for amplifying the targeted nucleic acid sequence under a single working temperature condition with special designs for the buffer system and primers to prevent non-specific amplification. It would thus allow for the development of a low-cost device for rapid pathogen detection.",

            "text": "Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP), originally developed by Notomi et al. [9] , utilizes a designed set of six primers, termed inner and outer primers, to recognize specific gene sequences, and a polymerase with strand displacement activity to generate large amounts of amplified product (>10 9 copies) within 1 h [10] . Moreover, it has been shown that the well-known PCR inhibitors in the blood (e.g., heme) have little impact on the LAMP reactions [11] . It is believed that the Bacillus stearothermophilus (Bst) DNA polymerase used in the LAMP reactions is more resistant to these inhibitors. Therefore, the LAMP reaction has been successfully applied for fast genetic screening tests in many acute infectious diseases, including Mycobacterium tuberculosis [12] , severe acute respiratory syndrome virus [13] , human influenza viruses [14, 15] , avian influenza viruses [16] and herpes viruses [17, 18] , with special primer design and buffer adjustment. Among these, the LAMP method has been shown to have great promise for the amplification of HBV DNA. In addition, the DNA yield of the LAMP reaction (10 g/25 l) is much higher than that of the traditional PCR (0.2 g/25 l) [19] . Recently, we have successfully demonstrated that the level of turbidity, which is due to the by-product (magnesium pyrophosphate) of DNA polymerization, has a high correlation to the amounts of amplified DNA. Then, we decided to work with a total of 25 l of LAMP reaction volume because of the practical limitations of turbidity detection. In addition to the use of the LAMP protocol, we have adapted a simulated chemical reaction to mimic the by-product production without using expensive polymerase and primers [20] . It can serve as an internal quality check for the system validation. Therefore, it is our intention to design and implement a compact integrated device with a disposable chip and simple quantitative optical read-out for low-cost applications.",

For the applications of rapid pathogens detection, we have successfully used the device on seven clinical serum specimens and confirmed HBV DNA levels with real-time PCR. The results of using this device indicate that different amounts of HBV DNA can be successfully detected within 1 h with a threshold level of 10,000 copies/ml, which is the recommendatory quantity of REVEAL-HBV study. This integrated isothermal device can be advantageous in a wide spectrum of field applications, including pathogen detection and gene testing.",

It is assumed that the intensity of the input light is constant and that the samples have no absorbing constituents (DNA absorption peak: 260 nm) and that there are no changes in other loss mechanisms for the transmission of light, such as surface coatings, alignment, etc. Then the changes in detected light intensity can be ascribed to changes in total scattering. Thus, we interpret changes in detected light intensity as having resulted from changes in turbidity.",

First, we check the efficiency of the heating and optical detection unit. We have adapted a simulated chemical reaction to mimic the by-product (magnesium pyrophosphate) production without using expensive polymerase and primers. Then, the results of the turbidity measurement from using a spectrometer are compared with the base apparatus. The reaction curves also have a similar trend between turbidity and initial amounts of potassium pyrophosphate. It shows that our system can provide appropriate reaction conditions for DNA amplification and detection. Second, we demonstrate that the results of within runs exhibit greater reproducibility of turbidity detection through the use of this base apparatus. This shows that our system has good stability. However, the results of between runs from our system show greater fluctuations than the results from the spectrometer, because of the disposable micro-reactor being a home-made product. In the future, we can use plastic molding for mass production to improve the quality and consistency of the micro-reactor and develop multi-channel micro-reactor type to achieve large-scale quantification test. The stability of light source and the precision of light-alignment are also important for the improvement of overall system performance.",

            "text": "After the performance of micro-reactor system is confirmed, HBV LAMP reactions can be transplanted into this system. The reaction curves decrease rapidly and achieve the lowest level of turbidity in 2 min. Then, the reaction curves increase quickly and achieve the highest level of turbidity in 8 min. We think that this phenomenon is related to the principle of Brownian motion [23] . When the reaction mixture is initially raised from room temperature to 65 \u2022 C, some microscopic clusters or particles may dissolve, causing an increase in the intensity of transmitted light. In 30 min, the turbidity of HBV LAMP reaction obviously changes. The standard curve shows that the numeric of the turbidity are highly correlated to the initial amounts of HBV template DNA (R 2 = 0.9605). After 30 min, gravity causes the numeric of turbidity to continually decrease because of the magnesium pyrophosphate precipitation. Therefore, the numeric of turbidity in 30 min could be a critical point for judging the performance of the HBV LAMP reaction. In addition, the HBV LAMP reaction is also performed in the thermalcycler. The amplified products can be analyzed by electrophoresis to confirm the consistency of the LAMP reaction between our device and thermalcycler. In Fig. 5 , we show that the electrophoretic result of the HBV LAMP reaction is performed in the thermalcycler (lane 1) or in our device (lane 2). It seems that there are many small fragments (<200 bp) of HBV LAMP reaction as shown in lane 2. We presume that this phenomenon is related to the slow heat transfer in our device, which causes Bst DNA polymerase cannot elongate the LAMP product under stable condition, initially.",

            "text": "The REVEAL-HBV study indicates that serum level of HBV DNA ( 10,000 copies/ml) is a strong risk predicator of hepatocellular carcinoma or cirrhosis [2] . Seven serum specimens with chronic hepatitis B were collected from National Taiwan University Hos-pital. These clinical specimens had triplicate tests by HBV LAMP reaction with this integrated isothermal device. The HBV viral load of these seven samples ranged from an undetectable level to more than 5 \u00d7 10 7 copies/ml for the testing of our device. The frequency of positive results in triplicate test represents by fractional number. In addition, our HBV LAMP reaction has good sensitivity (50 copies/25 l). Even though the quantitative results from our device are higher than the data from real-time PCR, these results (Table 1 ) are valid to effectively distinguish the HBV DNA threshold level in the serum samples according to current protocol. Thus, using the integrated isothermal device provides great assistance for early diagnosing and monitoring the progress of chronic hepatitis B. However, there are several inhibitors from the blood samples that might potentially interfere with the amplification processes require further elucidations. In this study, the serum HBV viral DNA was extracted by using the QIAamp Viral DNA Mini Kit. The purified DNA is free of protein, nucleases, and other contaminants and inhibitors. In 2006, a study demonstrated that the LAMP assay does not require purified DNA for efficient DNA amplification [11] . These PCR inhibitors have little impact on the LAMP reactions even though there are inhibitors (e.g., heme) in blood could severely affect the amplification of DNA in PCR assays. As DNA polymerase have different susceptibilities to PCR inhibitors, they suspect that the Bacillus stearothermophilus (Bst) DNA polymerase used in the LAMP reactions is more resistant. In the future, the influence of various inhibitors, e.g., elevated levels of triglycerides, bilirubin, hemoglobin, and non-specific human DNA, will be addressed when we directly detect DNA from serum or heat-treated blood by LAMP. It would also be necessary for us to show that systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and rheumatoid arthritis have no impact on the method during large-scale clinical experiment. We will also try to improve the sensitivity and further reduce the reaction volume to 6 l by using surface mode of optical detection [24] [25] [26] .",

Thus, using this integrated isothermal device greatly assists early diagnosing and monitoring the progress of chronic hepatitis B. It can improve the prognosis of patients and enormously save medical expenses.
