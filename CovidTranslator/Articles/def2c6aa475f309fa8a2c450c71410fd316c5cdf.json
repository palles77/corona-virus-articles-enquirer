Five single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of porcine IFN-\u2425 (PoIFN-\u2425) were identified, respectively, at positions 269 (A/G), 376 (C/T), 426 (T/C), and 465 (T/C) of the coding sequence in Landrance/Duroc hybrid, and at position 251 (A/G) in Landrance breed. Among them, A269G and A251G polymorphisms resulted in Q67R and K61R replacements in the mature protein. PoIFN-\u2425 cDNAs of Duroc breed (PoIFN-\u2425-W) and Landrance/Duroc hybrid (PoIFN-\u2425-M), which, respectively, encoded Q67 and R67, were introduced into a prokaryotic expression vector pET32 to express recombinant PoIFN-\u2425-W (rPoIFN-\u2425-W) and rPoIFN-\u2425-M protein variants in Escherichia coli. The identity of both protein variants was further confirmed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). We then compared bioactivities of these two recombinant proteins. Although both recombinant protein variants exhibited comparable activities in antiproliferation of PK-15 cells and in nitric oxide (NO) induction of porcine peripheral monocytes, antiviral activity of rPoIFN-\u2425-W protein was significantly higher (P < 0.001) than that of rPoIFN-\u2425-M protein in a plaque inhibition assay using pseudorabies virus (PRV). IC50 values of rPoIFN-\u2425-W and rPoIFN-\u2425-M protein in anti-PRV assay were determined as 5.3 \u00b1 1.3 and 9.3 \u00b1 4.3 nM, respectively.",

Nevertheless, the cDNA sequence has not been formally published. Although sequence of PoIFN-\u2425 gene was reported and aligned with human IFN-\u2425 gene to deduce the exon and intron structure (Dijkmans et al., 1990) , little is known about the polymorphism of PoIFN-\u2425 gene or cDNA. Human population studies have revealed several polymorphic sites in both intron and exon regions of human IFN-\u2425 gene (Iwasaki et al., 2001; Tiroch et al., 2005) . Two polymorphisms located in intron 1 of human IFN-\u2425 gene were further shown to affect the production of IFN-\u2425 (Pravica et al., 1999 (Pravica et al., , 2000 , and which might influence either disease manifestation of IgA nephropathy (Schena et al., 2006) , or the infection susceptibility to parvovirus B19 (Kerr et al., 2003) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) (Chong et al., 2006) .

Nucleotide and encoded amino acid sequences of these three clones were aligned and compared with that of PoIFN-\u2425 gene (Dijkmans et al., 1990) to identify any polymorphic sites. Two PoIFN-\u2425 cDNA variants were cloned, respectively, into pET32 vector for expressing rPoIFN-\u2425 proteins.

In contrast, NO secretion increased substantially in a dose-dependent manner when monocytes were treated with various concentrations of rPoIFN-\u2425 (from 0.5 to 50 nM) (P < 0.001). However, levels of NO synthesis stimulated by rPoIFN-\u2425-W, rPoIFN-\u2425-M, and commercial rPoIFN-\u2425 were not significantly different.",

            "text": "In this study, we identified five novel SNPs in PoIFN-\u2425 cDNA clones, including four (A269G, C376T, T426C, and T465C) from Landrance/Duroc crossbreed and one (A251G) from Landrance breed (Fig. 1) . A251G and A269G are located within exon 3 of PoIFN-\u2425 gene at nucleotide positions 68 and 86 (Dijkmans et al., 1990) . On the other hand, C376T, T426C and T465C are located within exon 4 of PoIFN-\u2425 gene at nucleotide positions 10, 60 and 99 (Dijkmans et al., 1990) . Four SNPs detected in PoIFN-\u2425-M (Landrance/Duroc) were absent in both PoIFN-\u2425-W (Duroc) and PoIFN-\u2425-L (Landrance), indicating that these SNPs may not be breed-specific. Allelic frequencies of these polymorphisms between Landrance and Duroc breeds, nevertheless, require further investigation. A269G polymorphism in PoIFN-\u2425-M would change the coded amino acid sequence (Q67R). A251G polymorphism in PoIFN-\u2425-L would also result in one amino acid replacement (K61R). Both K61 (within helix C) and Q67 (near helix D) are conserved in the mammalian IFN-\u2425 (Fig. 2) . However, we expect that the impact of K61R (PoIFN-\u2425-L), a similar amino acid replacement, would be minor. On the other hand, Q67R that increases positive charge of the protein variant (PoIFN-\u2425-M) could be a significant replacement. Consequently, in this study we expressed both PoIFN-\u2425-M (R67) and PoIFN-\u2425-W (Q67) variants to compare their biological activities. Interestingly, our results showed that Q67R could clearly inhibit antiviral activity of PoIFN-\u2425.",

All these viruses are RNA viruses that are highly sensitive to the antiviral mechanism of interferon. Instead of using RNA viruses, we evaluated the antiviral effect of PoIFN-\u2425 on pseudorabies virus, a DNA virus. PRV, a swine alphaherpesvirus, is distantly related to the human herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1). Unlike HSV-1 that is well known for its anti-interferon mechanism, PRV lacks homologs of some anti-IFN genes (e.g. \u242534.5 and Us11) of HSV-1 and the viral growth could be inhibited in IFN-\u2424 treated PK-15 cells (Brukman and Enquist, 2006) . The result of this study showed that PoIFN-\u2425 inhibited PRV in a dose-dependent manner, although the dosage of IFN-\u2425 used for PRV inhibition assay was higher than that for other RNA viruses. Therefore, we have established a PRV-based plaque inhibition assay to determine antiviral activity of PoIFN-\u2425. Except for carrying an extra fusion peptide encoded by pET32 vector at N-terminus, the amino acid sequence of rPoIFN-\u2425-W was identical to that of commercial rPoIFN-\u2425 protein (Vandenbroeck et al., 1991) . The fact that antiviral activities of rPoIFN-\u2425-W and commercial rPoIFN-\u2425 proteins were not significantly different indicated that the fusion peptide did not interfere with antiviral activity of IFN-\u2425. Results from plaque inhibition assay showed that rPoIFN-\u2425-W presented a better antiviral activity than rPoIFN-\u2425-M protein (P < 0.001). The missense polymorphism, Q67R, indeed has an impact on the biological activity of PoIFN-\u2425-M protein, and this is the first report that identified a functional SNP in the coding region of IFN-\u2425.",

This could be resulted from the interference of fusion peptide carried in rPoIFN-\u2425-M and rPoIFN-\u2425-W proteins. In addition to growth inhibition, activation of macrophage/monocyte is another important immunoregulatory activity of IFN-\u2425. Measuring IFN-\u2425-induced NO secretion in macrophages is a common bioassay for evaluating the activity of murine IFN-\u2425 (Kim and Son, 1996; Malu et al., 2003) . Instead of using macrophages, we measured PoIFN-\u2425-induced NO secretion in porcine monocytes because peripheral monocytes were more easily obtained from pigs. Our result showed that, in response to PoIFN-\u2425 stimulation, porcine peripheral monocytes produced NO in a dose-dependent manner. Nonetheless, induction levels of NO were not significantly different among monocytes treated with rPoIFN-\u2425-W, rPoIFN-\u2425-M, or commercial rPoIFN-\u2425. Taken altogether, Q67R and fusion peptide in the rPoIFN-\u2425 protein can, respectively, reduce antiviral activity and antiproliferation activity of IFN-\u2425, with little effect on NO induction. Our data indicate that these three activities reside in independent functional domains of PoIFN-\u2425.",

Three cDNA clones, designated as PoIFN-\u2425-W (pIFN-\u2425-W), PoIFN-\u2425-M (pIFN-\u2425-M) and PoIFN-\u2425-L (pIFN-\u2425-L), were isolated, respectively, from Duroc, Landrance/Duroc hybrid, and Landrance breeds. These cDNA sequences were deposited to GenBank under accession numbers AY188090 (PoIFN-\u2425-W), AY188089 (PoIFN-\u2425-M), and DQ839398 (PoIFN-\u2425-L). The sequence of PoIFN-\u2425-W cDNA completely matches to the predicted coding sequence (CDS) of a previously reported PoIFN-\u2425 gene (Dijkmans et al., 1990). On the other hand, PoIFN-\u2425-M clone has four nucleotide variations or single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), at nucleotide positions 269 (A/G), 376 (C/T), 426 (T/C), and 465 (T/C) of CDS (Fig. 1). Among these four SNPs, only the A269G polymorphism would change the coded amino acid sequence (Gln67Arg or Q67R). PoIFN-\u2425-L clone has one SNP at position 251 (A/G), resulting in one amino acid replacement (Lys61Arg or K61R). Amino acid sequences of PoIFN-\u2425-W, -M and -L variants were compared with that of other mammalian homologs, including bovine (M29867)",

Four single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified in the coding sequence (CDS) of PoIFN-\u2425-M, including one missense polymorphism (nucleotide 269) that changed the coded amino acid (residue 67) from glutamine (Q) to arginine (R). Another SNP (nucleotide 251) identified in PoIFN-\u2425-L resulted in an amino acid replacement (residue 61) from lysine (K) to arginine (R). The signal peptide comprises residues S1 to S23.
