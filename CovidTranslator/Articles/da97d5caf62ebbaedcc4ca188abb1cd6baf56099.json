CypA plays critical roles in various biological processes, including protein folding, assembly, transportation, regulation of neuron growth, and HIV replication. The discovery of CypA inhibitor is now of a great special interest in the treatment of immunological disorders. In this study, a series of novel small molecular CypA inhibitors have been discovered by using structure-based virtual screening in conjunction with chemical synthesis and bioassay. The SPECS_1 database containing 85,000 small molecular compounds was searched by virtual screening against the crystal structure of human CypA. After SPR-based binding affinity assay, 15 compounds were found to show binding affinities to CypA at submicro-molar or micromolar level (compounds 1-15). Seven compounds were selected as the starting point for the further structure modification in considering binding activity, synthesis difficulty, and structure similarity. We thus synthesized 40 new small molecular compounds (1-6, 15, 16a-q, 17a-d, and 18a-l), and four of which (compounds 16b, 16h, 16k, and 18g) showed high CypA PPIase inhibition activities with IC 50 s of 2.5-6.2 lM. Pharmacological assay indicated that these four compounds demonstrated somewhat inhibition activities against the proliferation of spleen cells.",

            "text": "Cyclophilins were discovered originally for their high affinity against cyclosporin A (CsA), an immunosuppressive drug used to prevent allograft rejection. 1 The general biological function of cyclophilins is to catalyze the cis-trans isomerization of peptide bonds preceding proline in protein and peptides. 2 Of the 15 known human cyclophilins, cyclophilin A (hCypA) is one of the most important members and has been widely studied for mapping its biological functions. 3 In addition to a binding target of CsA, hCypA is able to enhance the rate of folding (or unfolding) of proteins via its peptidyl-prolyl isomerase (PPIase) activity. 4 hCypA performs an essential function in HIV-1 replication by binding specifically with the capsid domain (CA) of the Gag polyprotein. 5 hCypA may also render neuroprotective/ neurotrophic effects 6 when presented at high levels in the brain. 7 Recently, it was discovered that the nucleocapsid (N) protein of SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) can bind to hCyPA, which may be associated with SARS-CoV infection. 8 CypA has attracted considerable attention not only for its novel catalytic activity, but also for its therapeutic significance. It is reported that CypA-CsA binding might inhibit the serine/threonine phosphatase activity of calcineurin, thereby blocking the production of cytokines including interleukin-2 9 and interferon c. 10 The discovery of CsA more than two decades ago heralded a new era in the field of organ transplantation. Since then, the number of transplanted organs has grown continuously and the search for novel immuno-suppressants has intensified. 11 However, inhibitors of CypA are mainly derived from the natural sources (such as FK506, 12 rapamycin, 13 and sanglifehrin A 14 ) and peptide analogues, 15 which are all large molecules, and little has been reported regarding the small molecule CypA inhibitors.",

Structure-based ligand design has led to the identification of compounds that are currently in clinical trials or into the market. 19 The wealth of structural and functional information of CypA 15 has offered a solid starting point for the rational structure-based design of inhibitors. By using dockingbased virtual screening approach in conjunction with surface plasmon resonance (SPR) determination, 15 novel small molecule CypA binders (hits) (compounds 1-15) have been discovered. According to the binding potency, structural similarity, and synthetic complexity, seven hits (compounds 1-6 and 15) were selected as the starting points for further structural optimization. Totally, 40 new compounds including 1-6 and 15 (the preparation methods for these seven compounds have not been reported) and their 33 analogues (16a-q, 17a-d, and 18a-l) have been synthesized and tested with biological assay.

The shape scoring function is an empirical function resembling the van der Waals attractive energy. The ligand-receptor binding energy is taken to be approximately the sum of the van der Waals and electrostatic interaction energies. After the initial orientation and scoring evaluation, a grid-based rigid body minimization is carried out for the ligand to locate the nearest local energy minimum within the receptor binding site. The position and conformation of each docked molecule were optimized using single anchor search and torsion minimization method of DOCK4.0. 21 Thirty configurations per ligand building a cycle and 50 maximum anchor orientations were used in the anchor-first docking algorithm. All docked configurations were energy minimized using 100 maximum iterations and 1 minimization cycle.",

Immobilization of the CypA to the hydrophilic carboxymethylated dextran matrix of the sensor chip CM5 (Biacore) was carried out by the standard primary amine coupling reaction wizard. The CypA to be covalently bound to the matrix was diluted in 10 mM sodium acetate buffer (pH 6.0) to a final concentration of 0.035 mg/mL.

All the Biacore data were collected at 25\u00b0C with HBS-EP as running buffer at a constant flow rate of 30 lL/min. All the sensorgrams were processed by using automatic correction for non-specific bulk refractive index effects.

The top 5000 candidate molecules were obtained with the best scores by a shape complementarity scoring function in DOCK. 21 These compounds were re-estimated using Cscore. 24 A total of 1301 compounds with Cscore = 4 or 5 (the best score of Cscore is 5) were subsequently docked and ranked using the FlexX 26 program. Finally, 82 compounds were selected according to the score of FlexX for biological assay. Because enzymatic assay is time-consuming, therefore, surface plasmon resonance (SPR) measurements were used for the primary screening, determining the binding affinity of these 82 candidate molecules to CypA. Immobilization of CypA resulted in a resonance signal at about 5370 resonance units (RUs). Among the 82 compounds, the biosensor RUs of 15 compounds were concentration-dependent. The collected data indicated that these 15 compounds can bind to CypA in vitro and the binding affinities to cyclophilin A are in the submicro-or micro-molar range (K D = 53.4-0.58lM). These compounds could be designated as binders (or hits) of CypA, their chemical structures and binding affinities shown in Figure 1 .",

Considering the structural similarity and the binding affinity with CypA, we took compounds 1-6 in class I and compound 15 in class III as leaders for structural optimization. Totally, 40 compounds (1-6, 15, 16a-q, 17a-d, and 18a-l) were designed and synthesized, and their chemical structures are shown in Tables 1 and 2. These compounds were synthesized through the routes outlined in Schemes 1-5, and the details for synthetic procedures and structural characterizations are described in the Experimental section. Tables 1 and 2. Four compounds, i.e., 16b, 16h, 16k, and 18g, can remarkably inhibit the PPIase activity of CyPA (percent inhibition at 10 lM > 50%), indicating that these four compounds are CypA inhibitors. Therefore, we determined their IC 50 values, which are, respectively, 4.88, 2.84, 2.48, and 6.23 lM (Fig. 2 ). In addition, the binding affinities of the 33 analogues were determined by using the SPR technology, the results also listed in Tables 1 and 2. The PPIase activities of the compounds do not consistently correlate with the SPR binding affinities. The reason may be that the protein was immobilized to a sensor chip in the SPR assay, which affects the conformational flexibility of the protein. Accordingly, good binders identified by the SPR assay may not be good inhibitors. To find CypA inhibitors rather than binders, the effects of compounds on the PPIase activity of CypA have to be determined.",

From Figure 3 , one can see that there are two binding sites in the surface binding groove of CypA: site A is a small binding pocket formed by Lys82, Met100, Ala101, Asn102, Ala103, Thr107, Asn108, Gly109, Ser110, Gln111, and Phe112; near site A, there is a larger pocket, which is called site B, formed by Phe60, Met61, Gln63, Ala101, Asn102, Ala103, Phe113, Leu122, and His126; there is a \u00d4saddle\u00d5 between the two sites. The binding models indicate that class I compounds (Table 1 ) interact with CypA in a similar way: the common sulfanilamide moiety occupies the polar binding site (site B), forming three to four hydrogen-bonds (H-bonds) with residues Gln63, Gly75, Asn102, Thr107, Ser110, and Gln111 (Fig. 4) ; the 2-substituents of quinoline rings (1-4 and 16a-j) and pyridine rings (16k-q) or aryl rings (5, 6 and 17a-d) fill in the hydrophobic pocket (site A); and the quinoline moiety (1-4 and 16a-j), the pyridine moiety (16k-q) or alkyl groups (5, 6 and 17a-d) act as linkers interacting with the saddle part between sites A and B. The interacting models for class III compounds to CypA are mostly similar to those for class I compounds, except that compounds 15, 18a, 18d-f, and 18j-l extend from site B due to their longer linkers and/or substituents.",
