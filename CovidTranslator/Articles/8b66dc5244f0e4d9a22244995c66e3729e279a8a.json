            "text": "Our objective was to characterize the effects of supplementing newborn calves with n-3 fatty acids (FA) and \u03b1-tocopherol on blood lipid profiles and oxidant status in early life. Sixteen calves received 0 or 60 mL of 1:1 fish and flaxseed oil with 200 mg of \u03b1-tocopherol in 2.8 L of colostrum within 6 h after birth. Colostrum was >22% on the Brix scale. Blood was sampled on d 1, 2, 4, 7, 14, and 21 after birth for assessment of plasma polyunsaturated FA, \u03b1-tocopherol, total serum protein, and oxidant status index, an indirect indicator of oxidative stress that examines the balance between the concentration of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species and antioxidant capacity in serum. Health was observed daily. Weight and hip height were recorded at birth, 3 wk, and 8 wk. Data were analyzed with a Mixed procedure of SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). Treatment did not alter concentration of total protein in blood serum, prevalence of diarrhea or other signs of disease, or rate of growth. Feeding n-3 FA and \u03b1-tocopherol increased plasma concentrations of the n-3 FA, including \u03b1-linolenic, eicosapentaenoic, and docosahexaenoic acids, with a concomitant decrease in oxidant status index during the first week of life. Concentrations of \u03b1-tocopherol decreased with supplementation, but all calves maintained adequate concentrations. Oxidant status index of treated calves returned to the level of control calves by d 14. We conclude that a colostrum supplement of n-3 FA and \u03b1-tocopherol is safe to administer to newborn calves, reduces oxidant status in the first week of life, and may improve health and performance.",

Waters Oasis Prime HLB 3-cm 3 solid-phase extraction columns were used for solid-phase extraction, which was performed using Biotage ExtraHera. After samples were loaded onto columns and excess infranatant was discarded with nitrogen, columns were washed with 3 mL of 5% methanol and then 2.5 mL of 90:10 acetonitrile: methanol eluted samples. Leftover solvents were evaporated with a Savant SpeedVac. A mixture of 1.5:1 methanol: HPLC water brought the PUFA back into solution before filtering and dispensing into glass chromatography vials with inserts. Vials were stored at \u221220\u00b0C until analysis with liquid chromatography-MS. A 6-point standard curve was used with the internal standards previously mentioned for quantification of PUFA concentrations.",

The reduction potential of each sample, compared as Trolox equivalents, was compared using a photometric plate reader. This decolorization assay is further described in Re et al. (1999) .

One possible mechanism is through increased n-3 FA, which compete for the same enzymatic reactions n-6 FA use to produce a large variety of known proinflammatory metabolites (Sordillo, 2018) . Cytochrome enzymes, for example, use both n-3 and n-6 FA as substrates but, with increasing concentrations of n-3 FA, will sometimes favor EPA over ARA as a substrate (Arnold et al., 2010) . Notably, EPA and DHA produce oxylipids with anti-inflammatory properties and oxylipids with lower proinflammatory potential than the competing ARA substrate; subsequently, greater metabolism of EPA will result in decreased RONS production. Thus, a prolonged response in decreased oxidant status such as that observed may have been assisted by n-3 FA catabolism. Some metabolites such as resolvins and protectins act as anti-inflammatory signaling molecules and are not only effective at decreasing inflammation but also protect against hyperinflammatory conditions (Calder, 2010) . A definitive association of downregulated inflammation with decreased RONS production has been observed after supplementation with n-3 FA (Takahashi et al., 2002) . A future study should examine what products of n-3 FA metabolism may affect the oxidant balance after a one-time dose in colostrum as reported in the current study. Our observation of decreased RONS production by the n-3 FA in FFE may have further improved with the addition of 200 mg (334 IU) of \u03b1-tocopherol, which was included to protect n-3 FA from peroxidation (Wang et al., 2010) . In our study, we observed decreased \u03b1-tocopherol concentrations in FFE calves during wk 1. Supplementation of PUFA is known to decrease \u03b1-tocopherol concentrations in blood (Raederstorff et al., 2015) , and we speculate that the depressed \u03b1-tocopherol concentrations observed in FFE calves were due to depletion by n-3 FA to prevent peroxidation. Incorporating 200 mg of \u03b1-tocopherol in the FFE treatment, which is greater than the minimum recommendation of 0.6 mg of \u03b1-tocopherol/g of PUFA (Harris and Embree, 1963) , was not enough to sustain plasma \u03b1-tocopherol concentrations of FFE calves at the same concentrations as in CON calves; nevertheless, FFE calves did not show visible signs of \u03b1-tocopherol deficiency, and plasma concentrations remained within recommended levels (Reddy et al., 1987) .",

However, all calves received an intramuscular injection of 100 mg of \u03b1-tocopherol and 2 mg of selenium at birth, and this supplement alone was unable to attenuate oxidative stress as much as the addition of FFE. The possibility , and (C) oxidant status index (OSi) as calf age increased, given in Trolox equivalents (TE), relative fluorescent units (RFU) per microliter, and arbitrary units (AU), respectively. CON = control (no supplement added to colostrum); FFE = 60 mL of a 1:1 fish oil: flaxseed oil blend with 200 mg of \u03b1-tocopherol added to colostrum. Data are shown as LSM \u00b1 SE predicted from the model. During the first week of age, FFE did not alter antioxidant potential (P = 0.14) and tended to decrease RONS (P = 0.08). Overall, FFE decreased OSi in wk 1 (P = 0.01). that calves would benefit from additional antioxidants above 100 mg of \u03b1-tocopherol and 2 mg of selenium should be explored.",

Failure of passive transfer (<52 g of protein/L of serum) puts the calf at risk for poor vitality and immune function. To our knowledge, no one has published effects of a lipid supplement to colostrum. We found that FFE did not alter normal absorption of IgG. Serum protein concentrations remained similar across CON (65 g/L) and FFE (64 g/L), where P = 0.35. Kamada et al. (2007) observed increased IgG concentrations in calves fed selenium-supplemented colostrum. Based on this finding, one might expect that the presence of \u03b1-tocopherol in our supplement might also increase IgG concentrations, but we did not observe this.",

The supplement increased plasma concentrations of ALA, EPA, and DHA, decreased the n -6: n -3 FA ratio in plasma, and decreased oxidant status index during the first week of life. We speculate that this change in n -6: n -3 FA ratio and decreased oxidant status may potentially improve health and growth.",
