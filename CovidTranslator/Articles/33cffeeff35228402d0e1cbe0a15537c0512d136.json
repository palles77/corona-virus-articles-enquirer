They are encoded by a superfamily of genes 1 and can be defined by several highly conserved motifs. These enzymes catalyse the removal of head groups from glycerophospholipids to generate phosphatidic acid (PtdOH), a reaction that results in the stoichiometric release of the free head group [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] . One of the four subgroups of PLD enzymes is characterized by a conserved H-X-K-X 4 -D-X 6 -G-(G/S) catalytic motif that is commonly known as an HKD motif. Members of this subgroup hydrolyse phosphodiester bonds via the HKD catalytic motif using a generally similar reaction mechanism; however, some family members also exhibit lipid hydrolase activity, whereas others do not. In addition, several PLD enzymes that lack HKD motifs have been described that also generate PtdOH 5 .",

Lindsley [1] [2] [3] 6 Abstract | Lipid second messengers have essential roles in cellular function and contribute to the molecular mechanisms that underlie inflammation, malignant transformation, invasiveness, neurodegenerative disorders, and infectious and other pathophysiological processes. The phospholipase D (PLD) isoenzymes PLD1 and PLD2 are one of the major sources of signal-activated phosphatidic acid (PtdOH) generation downstream of a variety of cell-surface receptors, including G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) and integrins. Recent advances in the development of isoenzyme-selective PLD inhibitors and in molecular genetics have suggested that PLD isoenzymes in mammalian cells and pathogenic organisms may be valuable targets for the treatment of several human diseases. Isoenzyme-selective inhibitors have revealed complex inter-relationships between PtdOH biosynthetic pathways and the role of PtdOH in pathophysiology. PLD enzymes were once thought to be undruggable owing to the ubiquitous nature of PtdOH in cell signalling and concerns that inhibitors would be too toxic for use in humans. However, recent promising discoveries suggest that small-molecule isoenzymeselective inhibitors may provide novel compounds for a unique approach to the treatment of cancers, neurodegenerative disorders and other afflictions of the central nervous system, and potentially serve as broad-spectrum antiviral and antimicrobial therapeutics.",

The mechanism of catalytic activity includes the following steps: first, the formation of a five-coordinate phosphohistidine intermediate and initial phosphoryl transfer during which the head group is cleaved; second, the hydrolysis of the phosphohistidine intermediate and bond dissociation of the hydrolysed substrate; and third, the formation of a thermodynamically stable four-coordinate phosphohistidine intermediate 7 . These individual steps are highly conserved among enzymes that contain the HKD motif, which supports speculation that the large number of highly diverse PLD enzymes evolved as a consequence of differences in the mechanism of regulation by constituents of distinct cell signalling and metabolic pathways to fulfil a variety of cellular functions for which PtdOH generation is vital.",

            "text": "Despite their essential roles in cellular function, it is curious that one or more PLD isoenzymes can be genetically ablated in mice without causing lethality or even overt severe morbidity phenotypes. However, some isoform-specific functions have been identified in these models [8] [9] [10] . It can be postulated that PtdOH production is so indispensable to cellular function and organism survival that multiple redundant pathways have evolved to prevent the global loss of PtdOH. Both metabolic and signalling pathways depend on PtdOH generation, from the initial steps of the de novo glycerophospholipid biosynthetic pathway (that is, the Kennedy pathway) to signalling pathways that are initiated by specific classes of GPCRs, RTKs and integrins, which lead to the rapid generation of signalling pools of PtdOH 5 FIG. 2) . In mammalian cells, GPCR signal-activated PtdOH generation occurs predominantly via the PLD1 and PLD2 isoenzymes, and phospholipase C (PLC)-diacylglycerol kinase (DGK) signalling. From this perspective, one or both of the isoenzymes may be involved both temporally and spatially in a specific cellular function, but PtdOH depletion can be compensated for if an isoenzyme is inactivated. If the causal misregulation step is due to a signalling pathway that modulates the specific PLD isoenzyme in a physiological circuit, then one of the parallel PtdOHgenerating pathways may not be similarly affected. As an example, purinergic receptors can induce PtdOH production via both PLD and PLC-DGK signalling in astrocytomas 11 . These pathways are interconnected and seem to constitutively cross-regulate one another in the production of primary PtdOH lipid products as well as that of downstream products such as diacylglycerol (DAG). When one pathway is blocked the other compensates, thereby ensuring the continued production of essential lipid signalling products. However, the resulting molecular species differ in acyl composition depending on whether they were generated via the PLD pathway or the PLC-DGK pathway. In some cases, acyl composition may be important for the activation of a specific target. For example, a recent report showed that only unsaturated fatty acids containing PtdOH dissociate the dishevelled, EGL-10 and pleckstrin (DEP) domain-containing mTOR-interacting protein (DEPTOR) from mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) 12 . This finding extends previous suggestions that PLD enzymes may have a primary role in the regulation of mTORC1 and that other enzymatic sources of PtdOH have a secondary role. By extension, if an individual isoform of PLD is dysfunctional and thus contributes to a disease process, then it is likely that isoform-specific small-molecule inhibitors would have less adverse consequences than would pan-reactive inhibitors.",

Although early efforts throughout the 2000s did identify small molecules that were capable of modulating the function of some PLD enzymesboth indirectly (for example, polyphenolic natural products such as resveratrol (FIG. 3a, compound 1 ) or steroids such as triptolide (FIG. 3a, compound 2) ) and directly (phosphate mimetics such as tungstate (FIG. 3a, compound 3) and vanadate (FIG. 3a, compound 4) , as well as natural products such as SCH420789 (FIG. 3a, compound 5) and calphostin C (FIG. 3a, compound 6 )) -these ligands failed to accelerate development in the field in part owing to their obvious lack of specificity. Thus, over the past 30 years, the most commonly used class of molecules to study the function of PLD enzymes was primary alcohols (for example, n-butanol (FIG. 3a,  compound 7) ). As emphasized above, alcohols such as n-butanol block PLD-catalysed PtdOH production by competing with water as a nucleophile. However, the blockade of PtdOH production is frequently incomplete under experimental conditions, and thus caution must be exercised in interpreting data from studies that have used primary alcohols such as n-butanol 1, 3, 5, 16 .",

These analogues included an indole amide congener that is now referred to as 5-fluoro-2-indolyl des-chlorohalopemide (FIPI; FIG. 3b, compound 9; PLD2 IC 50 = 200 nM) 21 . This manuscript only reported PLD2 activity, with no mention of PLD1 inhibition, which prompted further pharmacological evaluation of these compounds in both cell-based and biochemical assays with the purified PLD1 and PLD2 enzymes 16 . Interestingly, halopemide potently inhibited both PLD1 (cellular IC 50 = 21 nM; biochemical IC 50 = 220 nM) and PLD2 (cellular IC 50 = 300 nM; biochemical IC 50 = 310 nM), as does FIPI (PLD1 cellular IC 50 = 1 nM; PLD1 biochemical IC 50 = 9.5 nM; PLD2 cellular IC 50 = 44 nM; PLD2 biochemical IC 50 = 17 nM); therefore, halopemide and the reported analogues 21 are more accurately described as dual PLD1-PLD2 inhibitors. Although isoenzyme selectivity remained elusive, Figure 1 | Phospholipase D enzymes as therapeutic targets and their mechanism of action. a | Recent findings have implicated phospholipase D (PLD) enzymes as therapeutic targets in a variety of human diseases. b | Most PLD enzymes mediate both a hydrolysis reaction that generates phosphatidic acid (PtdOH) directly and a transphosphatidylation reaction in which primary alcohols serve as alternative substrates for the generation of a phosphatidyl alcohol lipid product. Allosteric small-molecule inhibitors block both reactions. PtdOH is metabolized to diacylglycerol (DAG) by lipid phosphate phosphatase (LPP) enzymes. PtdOH species are also generated downstream of PLC enzymes, which directly produce DAG; subsequent phosphorylation of DAG by DAG kinases (DGKs) generates PtdOH. The mechanism of transphosphatidylation has been reviewed in detail elsewhere 5 . BuOH, butanol; PtdBuOH, phosphatidylbutanol. *denotes long-chain fatty acid residues.",

Halopemide was originally developed by Janssen in the 1980s as an atypical antipsychotic that has potent antagonistic activity at D 2 dopamine receptors (as well as at more than 30 additional biogenic amine receptors) and was called a \"psychic energizer\" (REFS 22, 23) . In clinical trials, halopemide was shown to have effects on the negative as well as the positive symptoms of schizophrenia, without the extrapyramidal side effects that are common to standard atypical antipsychotic agents 22, 23 . Importantly, halopemide achieved high plasma exposure and displayed no adverse events or abnormal biochemistry. At these exposures, halopemide fully inhibited both PLD1 and PLD2, which suggests that the mechanism of inhibition of PLD1 and PLD2 by this chemotype would be safe in humans; this represented a major step towards de-risking this therapeutic approach. However, halopemide was not a panacea. Many laboratories began to use both halopemide and FIPI as key proof-of-concept tools for PLD1 and PLD2 target validation, which led to potentially flawed conclusions, as both compounds display a considerable amount of ancillary pharmacology at a multitude of biogenic amine receptors, as expected for atypical antipsychotics that have GPCR-privileged structures as a core motif [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] .",

The design and optimization strategy was based on results from two types of in vitro catalytic assays that were conducted in parallel: a cell-based assay and a biochemical assay that presented defined substrates to human or rat recombinant PLD enzymes 16 . Through a combination of diversity-oriented synthesis, matrix libraries and subsequent iterative parallel synthesis, more than 1,000 analogues were prepared and assayed, leading to a series of the first highly PLD1-selective inhibitors, which are exemplified by VU0359595 (FIG. 3b, compound 10 ; PLD1 IC 50 = 3.7 nM); VU0359595 has more than 1,700-fold selectivity for PLD1 versus PLD2 (REFS 16, 25) (FIG. 3) . In this instance, the addition of a (S)-methyl group to the ethyl linker increased selectivity for PLD1 versus PLD2 by more than 150-fold across multiple examples in this sub-series by both diminishing activity at PLD2 and enhancing inhibitory activity at PLD1 (FIG. 4) . By virtue of the (S)-methyl group, a multitude of the resulting analogues displayed more than 200-fold selectivity for PLD1 over PLD2 within a traditionally PLD2-preferring scaffold 16, 25 . This unanticipated finding is a striking example of the 'magic methyl' effect, and this modification to the linker promotes a U-shaped ligand topology. Importantly, VU0359595 had markedly improved ancillary pharmacology relative to halopemide and FIPI, and displayed an attractive DMPK profile, which enabled in vivo proof-of-concept studies 16, 25 .",

The structure-activity relationship (SARs) of these compounds were shallow, and more than 99% of the variants studied were devoid of PLD-inhibitory activity; however, an N-phenyl triazaspirone congener (FIG. 5, compound 11) displayed a modest preference for PLD2 and represented a considerable departure from the halopemide-based PLD inhibitors 26 . A subsequent lead optimization campaign focusing on the N-phenyl triazaspirone congener encountered a shallow SAR, yet the addition of a fluorine atom in the three-position of the N-phenyl moiety provided VU0364739 (FIG. 5, compound 12), the first highly selective PLD2 inhibitor (PLD2 IC 50 = 20 nM; 75-fold selective for PLD2 versus PLD1) 27 . Moreover, similarly to VU0359595, VU0364739 was a direct PLD inhibitor, and it had potent activity in biochemical assays with purified PLD proteins. In addition, VU0364739 had improved ancillary pharmacology relative to halopemide and FIPI, and a DMPK profile that was suitable for in vivo proof-of-concept studies 27 . Interestingly, PLD1-preferring VU0359595 was peripherally restricted, whereas PLD2-preferring VU0364739 was CNS penetrant (brain-to-plasma ratio (K p ) = 0.7) [25] [26] [27] . An intriguing observation within this novel PLD2-preferring series relates to the effect of the (S)-methyl group, which had a marked impact on PLD1 selectivity in the benzimidazolone series. In the benzimidazolone series, the addition of a (S)-methyl group into N-phenyl triazaspirone congener converted an approximately tenfold PLD2-selective inhibitor into the dual PLD1-PLD2 inhibitor compound 13 (FIG. 5) , which was approximately sixfold selective for PLD1 versus PLD2. These subtle structural features that promote substantial changes in PLD isoform selectivity are reminiscent of the 'molecular switches' that are prevalent in allosteric GPCR ligands [25] [26] [27] [28] .",

The monomeric GTP-binding protein ARF and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P 2 ) were found to be stimulators of PLD activity in extracts from HL60 cells 103 and porcine brain 104 . Based on this observation, it was postulated that PI(4,5)P 2 might even be an essential cofactor for the PLD enzymes.

An intriguing regulatory loop was discovered when ARF6 was shown to directly modulate phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate 5-kinase (PI5K), which catalyses the rate-limiting step in the generation of PI(4,5)P 2 in mammalian cells 114 . ARF seems to function as a feedforward stimulator of PI(4,5)P 2 production, triggering the production of PtdOH by PLD, which requires PI(4,5)P 2 . PtdOH then stimulates PI5K activity, which generates intracellular PI(4,5)P 2 .",

            "text": "The unprecedented level of PLD isoenzyme selectivity and the presence of apparent 'molecular switches' led us to question the mechanism by which these compounds inhibit PLD enzymes. These features, along with the structural similarity of these compounds to previously reported piperidine benzimidazolone-based allosteric inhibitors of AKT 31 -that is, they have a twosite binding mode within both the catalytic domain and the pleckstrin homology domain -led us to postulate that VU0359595 and VU0364739 were allosteric inhibitors 31, 32 . Initial studies with halopemide and FIPI in assays using a PLD1.d311 truncation construct (which lacked a portion of the pleckstrin homology domain) showed a slight reduction of PLD activity 16 ; however, both VU0359595 and VU0364739 significantly reduced PLD activity (by more than tenfold), which suggests that the pleckstrin homology domain (a domain that is far away from the HKD catalytic active site) is key for the binding of these molecules. Additional enzyme kinetic studies further increased our confidence that these compounds were allosteric 16, [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] . Using a backscattering interferometry technique 33 , it was found that VU0359595 binds to two sites on the PLD1 protein (one with high affinity and the other with low affinity) 34 , which further supports an allosteric mode of inhibition akin to that of allosteric AKT inhibitors 31, 32 . Of course, in the absence of high-resolution structural determinations, the sites of interaction are somewhat speculative, but some suggestions have been reported. In 2015, evidence was published for two sites of inhibitor action that involved both the enzyme catalytic centre and an allosteric phosphoinositide-binding pocket 35 . In this study, FIPI was shown to interact with S757 of PLD2 (and also other PLD isoenzymes); by contrast, VU0364739 interacted with two different PLD2 sites, with one in the HKD (at S757 or S648) and the other an allosteric site (R210 or R212) that is natively occupied by phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P 2 ). Binding of VU0364739 to the allosteric site blocked PI(4,5)P 2 binding. In combination with F244-L245-L246, the PI(4,5)P 2 -binding site forms a hydrophobic pocket in the pleckstrin homology domain that is identical to that of allosteric AKT inhibitors 31 , and thus promotes a high degree of PLD2 selectivity 35 . Not only have these second-generation, halopemide-based and triazaspirone-based PLD inhibitors achieved high selectivity for the individual PLD1 and PLD2 isoenzymes, they have also provided a novel allosteric mechanism for PLD inhibition 16, [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] . PLD2 has recently emerged as a target in oncology and infectious diseases 14, 16, 28, 29, 36 , and VU0364739 has served as a proof-of-concept compound 28 ; however, a better tool was required. Although VU0364739 is 75-fold selective for PLD2 over PLD1, the selectivity is driven by potency at PLD2 (IC 50 = 20 nM), but the compound still inhibits PLD1 at modest concentrations (IC 50 = 1500 nM); therefore, a third-generation optimization campaign was launched 27 . This effort led to the synthesis of ML298 (FIG. 6, compound 14) , which is more than 53-fold selective for PLD2 (IC 50 = 355 nM) and has negligible activity against PLD1 (IC 50 \u224820 \u03bcM). Incorporation of the (S)-methyl group used in the piperidine benzimidazolone series had a substantial impact on enhancing PLD1 inhibitory activity (increasing it by more than 250-fold) and provided ML299 (FIG. 6, compound 15 ), which is a potent, dual PLD1-PLD2 inhibitor (PLD1 IC 50 = 6 nM; PLD2 IC 50 = 20 nM) 28 . Once again, ancillary pharmacology and physiochemical properties were improved, and interestingly, ML298 was found to be peripherally restricted, whereas ML299 was CNS penetrant (K p = 0.44) 28 .",

This effort identified ML395 (FIG. 6 , compound 16) , which is a pyridylmethyl congener with good 29 . As a result, a series of potent and isoenzyme-selective, as well as dual, PLD inhibitors were developed; these compounds had DMPK and ancillary pharmacology profiles that were suitable for in vivo proof-of-concept experiments aimed at dissecting the roles of the individual mammalian PLD enzymes (described below) 16, [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] . Although a major advance in the PLD field, these halopemide-derived and novel triazaspirone-based series of mammalian PLD inhibitors were devoid of activity against both the bacterial Pseudomonas aeruginosa PldA and the endocannabinoid regulator NAPE-PLD 18 . Importantly, no ligands existed that could modulate these structurally divergent PLD enzymes, thus hindering our understanding of their potential as therapeutic agents. The search for inhibitors of these PLD enzymes led to the re-examination of certain selective oestrogen receptor modulators (SERMs), which have been used in the successful treatment of oestrogen-receptor-positive breast cancer 37, 38 . A previous report suggested a potential ER-independent mechanism for the efficacy of SERMs such as raloxifene (FIG. 7, compound 17 ) and 4-hydroxytamoxifen (FIG. 7, compound 19 ; the active metabolite of tamoxifen (compound 18)) that may be due to off-target inhibition of mammalian PLD enzymes 39 .

            "text": "The potential of SERM chemotypes as PLD inhibitors was not fully explored until recently, in part because the PLD-inhibitory activity required mid-micromolar concentrations, and SERM activity might complicate definitive target validation. However, these novel chemotypes might provide a novel scaffold that could achieve universal PLD inhibition across diverse PLD enzymes, and they have a binding mode that is distinct from the halopemide-derived and triazaspirone-based series of mammalian PLD inhibitors 16, [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] . Intriguingly, raloxifene, 4-hydroxytamoxifen and tamoxifen all showed modest inhibitory activity against the bacterial PldA enzyme, which prompted the evaluation of des ketoraloxifene (FIGS 7, 8, compound 20) , which is a SERM that has a unique planar topology and is a stronger activator of the activator protein 1 (AP-1)-binding site of ESR1 (which encodes oestrogen receptor-\u03b1)) compared with that of ESR2 (which encodes oestrogen receptor-\u03b2) 18 . Desketoraloxifene was a breakthrough, and had comparable inhibitory activity against mammalian PLD1, mammalian PLD2 and bacterial PldA (FIG. 8) . This unexpected finding led to a new multidimensional optimization campaign that focused on desketoraloxifene and produced hundreds of novel analogues. Taking into account the well-established SERM pharmacophore model, these analogues were designed to abolish SERM activity (FIG. 8) , and they were then measured using in vitro enzymatic assays against PLD1, PLD2, PldA and NAPE-PLD 18 . This effort provided compound 21 (FIG. 8) , which was devoid of the 6-OH moiety that is crucial for oestrogen receptor binding and antiproliferative action. It also contains an N,N-dimethylamino moiety, which is known to greatly reduce SERM activity in this core 40 , but retained good activity against PLD1 (IC 50 = 4.7 \u03bcM), PLD2 (IC 50 = 7.1 \u03bcM), PldA (IC 50 = 7.5 \u03bcM) and even NAPE-PLD (IC 50 = 67 \u03bcM) 18 . This finding also led to the profiling of desketoraloxifene against NAPE-PLD, and it was found to be slightly more potent than was compound 21 (NAPE-PLD IC 50 = 58 \u03bcM). Thus, both desketoraloxifene and compound 21 represented the first entry into potentially universal inhibition of structurally and phylogenetically distinct PLD enzymes 18 . Although an advance, compound 21 is a lead compound (that is, the 'halopemide of the mammalian chemotypes') from which to develop a more optimized compound for target validation of PldA and NAPE-PLD.",

Using a combination of microscopy and RNAi, it was demonstrated that viral entry was significantly delayed after prophylactic treatment of human A549 adenocarcinoma alveolar cells with VU0364739 in vitro 14 . This was true for infectious viruses and for non-infectious transferrin uptake, which is indicative of a general defect in endocytosis. However, the block was not complete, and some virus was eventually able to enter the cell.

The delay in virus endocytosis permitted a more efficient and effective antiviral response, which limited subsequent productive virus replication. This novel mechanism demonstrated the potential for broad-spectrum antiviral activity of PLD2 inhibition and gave some indication of why the treatment showed remarkably low toxicity (that is, although endocytosis was slowed, it was not blocked, thus permitting normal cell metabolism and cellular processes to continue, albeit with altered kinetics). These data also suggested that virus exocytosis, as measured by RAB10-mediated accumulation of surface-trafficking endosomes, was delayed, probably through mechanisms similar to those that that limited virus entry. This effect seemed to be less striking than the entry phenotype, but continued exploration of the potential for multiple pathways of action of PLD2 inhibition on influenza virus replication is ongoing. In summary, PLD2 inhibition can protect against influenza virus infection by delaying, but not blocking, endocytosis, which allows the host-cell innate immune system to mount an effective response against influenza virus. This 'extended window' of antiviral activity can significantly reduce productive virus replication (the steps in which PtdOH contributes to infection are summarized in FIG. 9 ).",

Surprisingly, there were distinctive elements in the mechanism of suppression of HIV and influenza virus by PLD inhibitors 15 . PLD inhibition has previously been shown to block RAS-MAPK activation in SK-BR3 breast cancer cells 46 , and in in vitro assays with CD4 + T cells, treatment with the PLD1 inhibitor VU0155069 reduced extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK) phosphorylation after T cell activation 15 .

HIV targets these activated T cells and makes use of the increased metabolic stores that are generated to support rapid cell division and effector activity 15 . Consistent with this, treatment with the PLD1-selective compound VU0359595 reduced the induction of MYC in these T cells in in vitro experiments.

RTKs such as epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) initiate signalling cascades that are known to have roles in cellular transformation, including signalling pathways that lead to the production of lipid second messengers. Binding of the hormone epidermal growth factor leads to EGFR dimerization, which is followed by the autophosphorylation of multiple tyrosine residues that form binding sites for Src homology 2 (SH2) domains, including those of growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 (GRB2), PLC\u03b3 and the p85 subunit of phosphoinositide 3-kinase. Similarly, viral egress appears to be impaired by PLD inhibition 14 . The regulation of AKT activity by PLD2 has also been shown to activate the autophagy pathway, which can limit virus production. PLD-generated phosphatidic acid (PtdOH) recruits AKT to cellular membranes, and AKT subsequently phosphorylates beclin 1 at serine 295. This leads to dissociation of the beclin 1-rubicon complex, a process that promotes autophagy. PLD inhibitors reduce PtdOH concentrations, reduce AKT-mediated phosphorylation of beclin 1 and stabilize the beclin 1-rubicon complex to stall autophagy. The changes depicted in membrane lipid composition are based on previous work that investigated the contributions of PtdOH to membrane curvature 115, 116 . During the process of autophagy, autophagosomes fuse with endosomes and lysosomes, which leads to their maturation into autolysosomes. These display the autophagy markers LC3 (light chain 3, also known as MAP1LC3) and p62 (also known as sequestosome 1). This process results in acidification and allows the autolysosome to digest captured cellular material such as viruses. The respective details of PLD1 and PLD2 activation are discussed elsewhere 3 . Right panel: this shows a PLD1 pathway that affects pyrimidine biosynthesis and intracellular deoxyribonucleotide triphosphate (dNTP) levels via the enzyme CAD (which contains carbamoyl aspartate synthase, aspartate transcarbamylase and dihydro-orotase domains). PLD1 allosterically modulates the activity of mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR), which leads to the phosphorylation of CAD and enhances its catalytic activity. The subsequent production of pyrimidine nucleotides via the activation of CAD is independent of AKT. PLD1 inhibition, in turn, can lead to reductions in dNTP production.",

Historically, this was thought to be primarily in response to the higher energy needs of cancer cells relative to those of normal cells, but it is now appreciated that most cancer cells obtain their cellular energy through oxidative phosphorylation 3 . Recent evidence suggests that rapidly dividing cells with dramatic growth rates use the glycolytic pathway as a means of biosynthesizing lipids, amino acids and nucleotides 3 . These intermediate molecules may be viewed as 'metabolic currency' , and dysfunctional regulation of signalling pathways is a frequent cause of the abnormal metabolic rates of cancer cells. This phenomenon of higher metabolic rates of cancer cells relative to healthy cells and the preference of cancer cells to use aerobic glycolysis is known as the Warburg effect, and recent insights into cancer cell metabolism have led to the development of small-molecule inhibitors that disrupt these cellular pathways. Both PLD1 and PLD2 have been shown to at least partially modulate essential pathways that are involved in metabolic reprogramming 67 . Smallmolecule inhibitors of PLD isoenzymes may, therefore, be better tolerated than conventional chemotherapeutic agents because they only partially suppress the stressmediated responses of metabolic pathways as opposed to shutting them down completely 36 .",

This is consistent with previous reports that demonstrated the modulation of mTOR pathways by PLD-generated PtdOH 68, 84 , and may explain why some PLD inhibitors, via their indirect effect on CAD function, can have activity against both cancer cells and viruses 15, 16, 46 (see also FIG. 10) .",

In the CNS, PLD1 and PLD2 display a distinct differential distribution and function, and numerous studies in the past 10 years have begun to delineate the potential of both isoenzymes to represent therapeutic targets in CNS disorders.

In 2010, using Pld1 \u2212/\u2212 and Pld2 \u2212/\u2212 mice, the non-overlapping roles of PLD1 and PLD2 in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease were demonstrated, along with the potential of therapeutically targeting these enzymes 9 . Overexpression and biochemical studies showed that PLD1 (but not PLD2) regulates the trafficking of APP and the assembly of the \u03b3-secretase complex via a direct interaction with presenilin 1 (PS1) 9, 93 . In in vivo experiments, PLD2 was shown to be required for the synaptotoxic action of A\u03b2, and Pld2 ablation rescued memory deficits and promoted synaptic protection in SwAPP mice, despite a high A\u03b2 load 9 . Finally, in 2014, a genome-wide association study identified a rare variant in PLD3 that doubled the risk for late-onset Alzheimer disease (LOAD); however, less than 1% of individuals with LOAD carry the PLD3 mutation 94 . PLD3 is highly expressed in brain regions that are prone to Alzheimer disease, such as the cortex and hippocampus, and is expressed at significantly lower levels in neurons from the brains of patients with Alzheimer disease than in control brains 94 . Unfortunately, it is unknown whether any of the existing PLD-inhibitor chemotypes modulate PLD3 catalytic activity, and the precise biological function of PLD3 in the human CNS is also unknown. It is also noteworthy that several recent reports have questioned some of the initial findings regarding the molecular association between rare alleles of PLD3 and the occurrence of early onset Alzheimer disease [96] [97] [98] .",

Here, it is of note that the production of newly synthesized PtdOH, as a consequence of infection-induced activation of cellular signalling pathways, may be under-reported. PtdOH accumulation may be highly transient owing to the rapid flux of these lipid species, as enzymes convert PtdOH into DAG, lysophosphatidic acid (lysoPtdOH) and constituents of the Kennedy pathway (see FIG. 2 ). Investigations in HCMV-infected cell lines suggested that PtdOH generation in response to infection occurred via de novo biosynthesis and not as a result of the activity of PLD enzymes 13 . However, we observed increases in PtdOH mass following the infection of cell lines with influenza virus, an effect that was reduced after treatment with isoform-selective PLD inhibitors 14 . This leads us to propose the 'PtdOH hypothesis of infection' , which postulates that PtdOH accumulation may be a component of infection that is broadly relevant to viral, bacterial and fungal pathogens. Moreover, although the roles of PLD enzymes in cancer, and infectious and neurodegenerative diseases are undoubtedly complex and multifaceted, it is tempting to speculate that this reflects a shared role of intermediate metabolism in each of these diseases.",
