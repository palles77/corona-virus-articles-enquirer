The virus-specific nucleic acid sequences have been detected in lung fluid, throat, oropharyngeal and nasopharyngeal swab samples [3] . Due to lack of sufficient awareness of the COVID-19 in the early stages of the epidemic, some healthcare workers (HCWs) have been infected [4, 5] . Patients with symptoms of VOVID-19 may present to Ear Nose and Throat ENT Departments. To decrease the density of patients, the ENT department separated the waiting area from the treatment area, reduced the number of appointments, scheduled appointments at different times, and increased online consulting services. In addition, taking account of the facts that the median age of COVID-19 patients was 59 years and that morbidity and mortality is greater in the elderly [4] , HCWs older than 65 years of age were suspended from outpatient activities. Further, our escalation plan is that if the number of COVID-19 cases continues to rise, only emergency services will be maintained.",

This there is a particularly high risk to HCWs and other patients in ENT Departments. To protect HCWs and non-infected patients from potential COVID-19 patients, infection control measures were established in the West China Hospital (WCH) ENT department. We summarize our experiences, which we hope might help other ENT units to formulate their own infection control plans to prevent nosocomial transmission of COVID-19. As COVID-19 began to spread, WCH set up a trans-department emergency infection control team that was in charge of infection control and protection management for the entire hospital. The strategy for infection control against COVID-19 includes: material preparation and distribution, training on infection prevention measures, a triage strategy, limiting traffic in the hospital, reorganization of hospital departments, keeping the environment clean, etc.",

Emergency patients are assessed and managed according to the flowchart in Figure 1. After surgery, patients with suspected COVID-19 are transferred to a negative pressure isolation ward and screened for COVID-19. Those that screen negative are returned to the ENT department; those that test positive are transferred to the infectious ward for further treatment. It should be emphasized that fever occurred in only 43.8% of patients with 2019-nCoV on initial presentation [6], those patients may be missed if the surveillance case definition only focused on fever detection during preoperative screening.",
