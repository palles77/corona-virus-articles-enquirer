            "text": "Mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) belongs to the Coronaviridae whose name is based on the characteristic morphology of petal-shaped spikes of these viruses (I). They are enveloped viruses with a large nonsegmented, positive-stranded RNA genome (2, 3). MHV produces seven to eight discrete mRNAs. They form a 3'-coterminal nested set extending different lengths in 5' direction and each mRNA has a common 5'-leader sequence of about 70 bases (4, 5). In MHV-infected cells, three major viral proteins are detected. A nucleoprotein (N) of ca. 60,000 Da is the most abundant and is translated from mRNA7 (6-8). Two other glycoproteins, El and E2, of ca. 23,000 and 120,000 to 160,000 Da, are translated from mRNAs 6 and 3, respectively (6-8). Among these three viral structural proteins, the E2 or peplomer glycoprotein has been shown to have particularly interesting biological activities (9-11). It is believed that the fusion of cells infected with MHV is caused by the E2 glycoprotein, which is fusogenie only after it has been cleaved proteolytically (12, 13) . Another important biological function of the E2 glycoprotein is thought to be its binding to receptors on the cell surface as an initial step in virus replication in cells (10). The E2 glycoprotein is also believed to be involved in the pathogenesis of MHV on the basis of studies on monoclonal antibodies ( 74-7 7) and variant viruses isolated from persistent infections (18).",

First, a comparison of the mRNA patterns of the six different JHMV variants was made, focusing on the size differences of mRNA3. RNA was extracted from DBT cells infected with each of the six JHMV variants, electrophoresed on agarose gels, and transferred onto nitrocellulose filters. Virus-specific mRNAs were detected by hybridization with 32P-labeled cDNA prepared from mRNA7 of JHMV as previously reported (23). As shown in Fig. 1 , there were at least eight distinct mRNAs with different mobilities on agarose gels. There were no substantial differences in the mRNA patterns among the six different JHMV variants except for the sizes of mRNAs 2, 2a, and 3. The variants sp-4 and JHM-X produced mRNA 2, 2a, and 3 of smaller sizes (ca. 150,000 Da) compared with those produced by other variant viruses. In addition to these differences in the sizes of particular mRNAs, a striking difference in the amount of mRNA2 produced by CNSV was observed. In all other variants, mRNA2 was shown to be more abundant than mRNA2a; however, CNSV produced an excess of mRNA2a.",

E2 glycoproteins produced by sp-4 and JHM-X, both of which synthesized a small mRNA3, were shown to be approximately 15,000 Da smaller than those produced by the other variant viruses with larger mRNA3.s.

As shown in Fig. 3 , the monoclonal antibodies uniformly had excellent binding to all the viruses tested, with the exception of sp-4 and JHM-X, the two variants with small mRNA3s and E2 proteins. These two variants did not bind to monoclonal antibodies recognizing two major antigenic regions on the peplomer, which have been designated E2(A) and EZ(B). Monoclonal antibody J.7.1, recognizing a third site on E2, binds all viruses with essentially equal intensity, indicating that the E2 molecule is present in normal amounts in all variants tested. All monoclonal antibodies to N protein and one to E 1 protein bound strongly to all six strains. However, the other monoclonal antibody to the El protein, J.2.7, did not bind variants ~1-2, CNSV, and sp-4, showing that J.2.7 can distinguish variants maintained in West Germany from other JHMVs. These results suggest that the determinants E2(A) and E2(B) are either antigenically altered or deleted in variants with small E2 glycoproteins. The second possibility seems more likely, in view of the uniformly high binding of the monoclonal antibodies to variants with large E2 proteins and the consistent lack of any binding of the antibodies to variants with small E2 glycoproteins.",

From such observations, it may be speculated that ca. 500 bases found only in larger mRNA3s are located in one-third of the mRNA3 at the 3'-end.

This indicates that the viruses with the larger E2 glycoprotein may have a growth advantage in rat brain, resulting in acute and semiacute encephalomyelitis.
