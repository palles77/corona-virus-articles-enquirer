ALL patients experience immune suppression both from their disease and secondary to chemotherapy, which they receive for up to 3.5 years.

[4] The investigators identified 27 clinical encounters in 24 oncology patients (63% with hematologic cancer), with two-thirds of the patients hospitalized for a median duration of 7.4 days, and 40% of them experienced a delay in chemotherapy as result of influenza infection. [4] In addition, 15% of the subjects had concurrently diagnosed bacteremia. Others have reported severe and fatal complications due to influenza disease in this population, such as secondary bacterial infections and hemophagocytic syndromes, [5] [6] [7] [8] including serious complications from the 2009 pandemic influenza A H1N1. [9] In addition, immunosuppressed individuals can shed influenza virus for prolonged periods when infected, resulting in nosocomial outbreaks and development of resistant strains. [10] [11] [12] The main protection from influenza disease is influenza vaccination. Therefore, yearly influenza vaccination is recommended for high-risk individuals, including patients with ALL. [13] Contemporary influenza trials with the trivalent inactivated influenza vaccines (TIVs) demonstrated that children with ALL mount an immune response; [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] however, these studies also confirmed lower titers and seroresponse rates to influenza vaccines in children with ALL compared to healthy controls. In addition, lower titers were observed in those who received chemotherapy compared to those off chemotherapy. [14, 15, 19] Recently, a high dose (HD) TIV (Fluzone HD) with four times the antigenic dose was approved in individuals \u226565 years of age, because this population was historically noted to respond poorly to the standard dose TIV compared to younger adults. [20] A phase III study found a statistically significant higher antibody response to both influenza A antigens in elderly patients who received the HD vaccine compared to those who received the standard dose (SD) TIV, thus leading to its licensure.",

Our results differ from the three previous studies with the elderly population in which they reported higher rates of local reactions in HD TIV recipients compared to SD TIV recipients; however these reactions were also well tolerated in the elderly. [24] [25] [26] Although this study was not powered to compare the immunogenicity between vaccine groups, the GMTs and the percentage of subjects achieving a \u22651:40 or 4-fold rise in titers were not statistically different between those in the HD TIV or SD TIV groups. Our analyses separated the group comparisons further by those who received one or two doses of the vaccine, further limiting the sample size. We additionally analyzed the immunogenicity results by comparing the two study years and found no significant differences. Since this study was not powered for immunogenicity, a phase II trial is needed to determine the immunogenicity of HD versus SD TIV in the pediatric ALL. In addition, pre-titers in both groups were high, especially with H1N1 and B, which could have been due to prior vaccination or prior infection; these results may have further limited our ability to evaluate vaccine responses.",

[23] The majority of these earlier studies; however, reported that lower antibody titers were achieved in individuals with cancer, including children with ALL, when compared to healthy controls. [35] In addition, individuals receiving chemotherapy had significantly lower titers compared to those off chemotherapy. [35] Lower immune responses in children with ALL receiving chemotherapy compared to healthy controls and children with ALL off-chemotherapy were also reported in more current studies with TIV. [14, 15, 19] . Two studies compared TIV to a live-attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) in children with cancer; the first study proved it was safe to administer LAIV in these children. [22] However, the second study revealed that the LAIV produced lower HAI titers compared to the TIV, [36] suggesting that the LAIV was not as effective in this population compared to the TIV.

This was a phase I study with a small number of patients enrolled and although we did not see any increased local or systemic reactions associated with the HD TIV, further studies with a larger population are needed. Recruitment occurred over two influenza seasons which is not ideal, but the vaccine formulations remained identical. Even though we limited our patients to children with ALL in remission and at least 4 weeks into the initiation of chemotherapy, this was still a heterogeneous population, which could have affected our immunogenicity results. Finally, we changed our inclusion criteria in study year two, which allowed patients to enroll after 4 weeks into chemotherapy rather than once in the maintenance phase. Patients enrolled prior to the maintenance phase of chemotherapy are receiving more intense therapy and this might have affected their immune response to the vaccine in study year two, although since more than 80% of patients were in maintenance during the study, the population was quite homogenous.",
