After oral immunization with transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE) coronavirus, antibody production from primed mesenteric lymph node cells was revealed by an in vitro boost with viral antigen. For the latter the leukocytes were co-cultured with UV-inactivated virus using a variety of different methods of antigenic stimulation. Enumeration of specific antibody-secreting cells (ASC) and titration of secreted anti-virus antibodies were performed with ELISASPOT (using 3-amino 9-ethyl carbazole as the peroxidase chromogen) and ELISA tests respectively, according to the Ig isotype. The results showed a close relationship between ASC numbers and secreted antibody titres. The best in vitro antibody synthesis was observed when the sensitized cells were maintained in contact with virus during the whole culture period. Antibody responses were defined by a kinetic profile characterized by a narrow peak, with a maximum occurring after 4 and 6 days of culture and with the IgA response appearing earlier than the IgG. This methodology, which analyses specific antibody responses at the cellular level, may permit studies on the mechanisms of Ig isotype regulation. Extended to leukocytes from other organs of the immune system, it may also constitute an in vitro model to study antibody responses expressed in different lymphoid tissues of the pig.",

It usually results in only a transient diarrhea in adults but is a major cause of death in piglets under two weeks of age (Bohl, 1981; Garwes, 1982) . Lactogenic immunity, induced in sows after natural infection or oral immunization, appears to be the most important mechanism protecting newborn piglets against TGE infection (Hooper and Haeltermann, 1966; Bohl et al., 1974; Aynaud et al., 1990) . Viral stimulation of the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) of sows leads to the production in mammary secretions of antibodies (secretory IgA) which are protective for the piglet intestinal mucosa (Bohl et al., 1972a; Bohl, 1979, 1981) . Our research program is mainly focused on improving protection of suckhng piglets through milk-borne immunity. Although the presence of secretory IgA antibodies in milk is linked to the immune status of the intestinal mucosa, the mechanisms of regulation of this local antibody production are still unclear.",

            "text": "The enteric tropism of the TGE coronavirus permits studies on the induction and modulation of the local IgA response. In order to better understand the mechanisms operating in the regulation of the antigen-specific IgA production in the secretory immune system at the cellular level, it was necessary to establish both an in vitro model for antigenic stimulation of pig leukocytes using TGE virus (TGEV) and a technique for enumerating resulting specific antibody-secreting cells (ASC), according to their Ig isotype. The methods used in vitro for antigenic stimulation were essentially those developed for study of in vitro primary and secondary plaque-forming cell responses following stimulation of pig blood mononuclear cells with mouse red blood cells (MRBC), subsequently also applied to the response to ovalbumin (OVA) (Binns, 1982; Berthon and Binns, manuscript in preparation) . Since the hemolytic plaque assay (Jerne and Nordin, 1963; Jerne et al., 1974) did not appear to be appropriate for the determination of numbers of specific ASC in the responses of pig leukocyte cultures to viral particles, their enumeration was undertaken with an ELISASPOT test. Although originally described for the investigation of ASC responding to the protein antigen OVA (Czerkinsky et al., 1983; Holt, 1983, 1986; Holt et al., 1984; Bianchi et al., 1986) the ELISASPOT test has been used with viral antigens (Russell et al., 1987) . With TGE virus, the test was performed using virus-infected swine testis (ST) cell monolayers as antigen (Grom and Bernard, 1985; Russell et al., 1987; Cubero Pablo et al., 1988 ) and 3-amino 9-ethyl carbazole as the chromogen for the peroxidase reaction (Pauli et al., 1984) . This report describes a method to study in vitro antibody responses of the pig GALT to TGE virus at the cellular level. The effect of various in vitro antigenic stimulation methods on the humoral immune response from in vivo primed mesenteric leukocytes was studied and specific antibody production measured, according to Ig isotype, using two techniques: the enumeration of anticoronavirus ASC (ELISASPOT test) and the titration of specific antibodies secreted in culture supernatants (ELISA test).",

Little or no TGEV-specific IgG was detected in samples from cultures without virus (ST) or following short antigenic stimulation (PV). The profile of the IgA anti-TGE\u00a5 response after the in vitro boost (Fig. 3B ) was similar to the IgG response, though the highest level of antibody was observed after 6 days of culture. In this response too, pulsed viral stimulation produced less antigen-specific IgA synthesis, increasing to a lower peak level from a high average background.",

Compared to this last report, our in vitro antigenic stimulation methods permit both the use of crude viral antigen preparations and the titration of secreted anti-TGEV antibodies without any treatment of the culture supernatant samples. Since the protective mechanisms against TGE infection do not seem to be only provided by anti-TGEV neutralizing antibodies (Shirai et al., 1988; Wesley et al., 1988) , the humoral immune responses induced in pig MLN by TGEV have been studied by estimating both total TGEV-specific antibody-producing cells and their secreted product, according to their Ig isotype and regardless of their neutralizing activity.",

For example, some antibody specificities which react with virus-infected cells may be against epitopes which are either (a) not expressed at all on isolated viral particles or (b) are hidden on such particles (Bernard et al., manuscript in preparation) . So, for some samples the ELISA technique performed on virus-infected cell monolayers (Grom and Bernard, 1985; Cubero Pablo et al., 1988) may be more sensitive than the ELISA immunocapture technique.

In both cases, kinetic profiles of specific antibody production were characterized by narrow peaks (the anti-TGEV IgA response occurring earlier than the IgG), suggesting that, under these in vitro culture conditions, antigenic stimulation caused differentiation in only some late precursors of antibody-forming cells. According to this hypothesis, the lower total and IgA anti-TGEV antibody responses observed with leukocytes from jejunal Peyer's patches than with mesenteric cells could reflect differences in their cell content and stage of differentiation. Although good antibody responses were induced from unprimed blood lymphocytes stimulated in vitro with MRBC and OVA (Binns, 1982;  Berthon and Binns, manuscript in preparation) using the same culture conditions, we have not yet detected an in vitro antibody response to the coronavirus without preliminary in vivo immunization of the leukocytes. These observations are in agreement with studies performed with other viral antigens (African swine fever virus) in which induction of antibody secretion from cultured pig leukocytes appeared to be dependent on growth factors (e.g., interleukin-2) which could be provided by supernatants of concanavalin A-stimulated leukocytes (Casal et al., 1987) . The transient antibody response, as illustrated by the peak of the kinetic profiles, may indicate that these antigenic stimuli caused selective terminal differentia-tion of primed precursors to synthesizing plasma cells and then cell death. No more SFC were detected after 10 days of leukocyte culture, in contrast to the response of blood lymphocytes to MRBC, which under appropriate conditions showed continuing synthesis of antibody beyond this time.",

However although these bacterial antigens are cytotoxic for lymphocytes, they are both persistent and contain lipopolysaccharide which is a B cell mitogen, so providing a more potent and complex response.

Thus in comparison with the normal viral stimulation (V) method, complex formation in the RV protocol resulted in a decrease of free secreted antibody titers as revealed by ELISA tests.

The use of these enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays permit both a precise analysis of the antigenspecific antibody response and studies of the mechanisms of Ig-isotype regulation.
