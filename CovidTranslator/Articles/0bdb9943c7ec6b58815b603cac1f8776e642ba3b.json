In these two cases, basic transcriptional regulatory elements were designed and assembled to realize the biological equivalents of electronic memory storage and timekeeping (Box 1). Within the framework provided by these two synthetic systems, biological circuits can be built from smaller well-defined parts according to model blueprints, they can be studied and tested in isolation, and their behaviour can be evaluated against model predictions of the system dynamics. This methodology has subsequently been applied in the synthetic construction of additional genetic switches 8, 10-18 , memory elements 8, 14, 15, 19 , and oscillators 9, 10, [20] [21] [22] [23] , as well as of other electronics-inspired genetic devices, including pulse generators 24 , digital logic gates [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] , filters [31] [32] [33] , and communication modules 23, 31, 34, 35 .",

            "text": "In electronics, one of the most basic elements for storing memory is the reset-set (RS) latch based on logical NOR gates. This device is bistable, in that it possesses two stable states that can be toggled with the delivery of specified inputs. Upon removal of the input, the circuit retains memory of its current state indefinitely. These forms of memory and state switching have significant implications in biology, such as in the differentiation of cells from an initially undifferentiated state. One means by which cellular systems can achieve bistability is through genetic mutual repression. The natural P R /P RM genetic switch from bacteriophage lambda, which uses this network architecture to govern the lysis/lysogeny decision, consists of two promoters that are each repressed by the gene product of the other (that is, by the Cro and CI repressor proteins). The genetic toggle switch 8 , constructed by our research group, is a synthetically engineered version of this co-repressed gene regulation scheme. In one version of the genetic toggle, the P L promoter from lambda phage was used to drive transcription of lacI, whose product represses a second promoter Ptrc-2 (a lac promoter variant). Ptrc-2, on the other hand, drives expression of a temperature-sensitive \u03bb CI repressor protein (cI-ts), which inhibits the P L promoter. The activity of the circuit is monitored through the expression of GFP. The system can be toggled in one direction with the exogenous addition of the chemical inducer isopropyl-\u03b2-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) or in the other with a transient increase in temperature. Importantly, upon removal of these exogenous signals, the system retains its current state, creating a cellular form of memory.",

Electronic timekeeping can be achieved with basic oscillator circuits, such as the LC circuit (inductor L and capacitor C), which act as resonators for producing periodic electronic signals. Biological timekeeping, which is widespread among living organisms 120 , is achieved with circadian clocks and similar oscillator circuits, such as the one responsible for synchronizing the critical processes of photosynthesis and nitrogen fixation in cyanobacteria. The circadian clock of cyanobacteria is based on, among other regulatory mechanisms, intertwined positive and negative feedback loops on the clock genes kaiA, kaiB, and kaiC. Elowitz and Leibler constructed a synthetic genetic oscillator based, not on clock genes, but on standard transcriptional repressors (the repressilator) 9 . Here, a cyclic negative feedback loop composed of three promoter-gene pairs, in which the 'first' promoter in the cascade drives expression of the 'second' promoter's repressor and so on, was used to drive oscillatory output in gene expression. Now, ten years after the demonstration of synthetic biology's inaugural devices 8, 9 , engineered biomolecular networks are beginning to move into the application stage and yield solutions to many complex societal problems. While much work remains on elucidating biological design principles 36 , this foray into practical applications signals an exciting coming-of-age time for the field.",

In the example shown, a transcriptional AND gate was designed to sense and report only the simultaneous presence of two environmental signals (e.g., salicylate and arabinose)25. At one gate input, the researchers encoded an environment-responsive promoter (e.g., P BAD ) that activates transcription of a T7 RNA polymerase gene in response to a single environmental signal (e.g., arabinose). The gene, however, carries internally encoded amber stop codons (red asterisks) that function to block translation of its transcript. Activation of the second gate input is the key to unlocking translation; specifically, translation can be induced when a second promoter (e.g., P sal ) activates transcription of the SupD amber suppressor tRNA in response to a second unique signal (e.g., salicylate). In other words, only when the two environmental signals are simultaneously present can the T7 RNA polymerase be faithfully expressed and used to activate an output T7 promoter. This is an example of how sophisticated specificity can be programmed into a transducer module by creatively linking the sensory information of multiple sensitive elements. Furthermore, the design is transcriptionally modular in that different sets of environment-responsive promoters can be interfaced to the AND gate.",

Specifically, the absence of light triggers Cph8 kinase activity, which correspondingly activates the ompC promoter.

AHL binds to the constitutively expressed transcription factor LuxR to activate expression from the P lux-\u03bb promoter, which is simultaneously and dominantly repressed by CI.

Achieving true modularity with genetic parts is inherently difficult because of unintended interference among native and synthetic parts, and therefore requires careful decoupling of functional modules. One such modular design strategy was employed by Kobayashi et al. 34 to develop whole-cell E. coli biosensors that respond to signals in a programmable fashion. In this design, a sensory module (i.e., an environment-responsive promoter and associated transcription factor) was coupled to an engineered gene circuit that functions like a central processing unit. E. coli cells were programmed to respond to a deleterious endogenous input, specifically, DNA-damaging stimuli such as UV radiation or mitomycin C. The gene circuit, which was chosen to be the toggle switch described above (see Box 1), processes the incoming sensory information and flips from an 'off' to an 'on' state when a signal threshold is exceeded. Because the biosensor has a decoupled, modular nature, it can be wired to any desired output, from the expression of a standard fluorescent reporter to the activation of natural phenotypes, such as biofilm formation (e.g., via expression of traA gene) or cell suicide (e.g., via expression of ccdB gene).",

Many regulatory RNA molecules are natural environmental sensors [61] [62] [63] [64] [65] [66] [67] [68] [69] , and because of their ability to take on complex structures defined by their sequence, these molecules can mediate diverse modular functions across distinct sequence domains.

Aptamer domains that are modeled after riboswitches represent versatile and widely used sensitive elements for RNA-based biosensing. The choice and number of aptamer domains can provide control over specificity.

Binding of the aptamer to its ligand (e.g., the small molecule theophylline) induces a conformational change in the RNA sensor that either sequesters the antisense domain in a stable stem loop (ON switch) or liberates it to inhibit translation of an output gene reporter (OFF switch). As a result of the cooperative dependence on both ligand and target mRNA, this biosensor exhibits binary-like switching at a threshold ligand concentration, similar to the genetic toggle design. Importantly, this detection threshold can be adjusted by altering the RNA sequence and thus the thermodynamic properties of the structure. In principle, the \"antiswitch\" framework is modular, in other words, aptamers for different ligands and antisense stems targeting different downstream genes could be incorporated into the scaffold to devise new sensors. In practice, and as in many current synthetic biology designs, developing new sensors by aptamer and antisense replacement would likely involve re-screening compatible secondary structures to create functioning switches. In the future, this platform could be combined with rapid, in vitro aptameric selection techniques [72] [73] [74] [75] for generating a suite of RNA biosensors that report on the levels of various mRNA species and metabolites within a cell. However, here it should also be noted that aptamers show specificity for a relatively biased ligand space, and as a result aptamers for a target ligand cannot always be found.",

Conversely, many other drugs are isolated from hosts that are not as amenable to large-scale production and are therefore costly and in short supply. Such drugs include the antimalaria drug artemisinin and the anticancer drug taxol. Fortunately, global access to drugs is being enabled by hybrid synthetic biology and metabolic engineering strategies for the microbial production of rare natural products. In the case of artemisinin, there exist two biosynthetic pathways for the synthesis of the universal precursors to all isoprenoids, the large and diverse family of natural products of which artemisinin is a member. The native pathway found in E. coli (deoxyxylulose 5-phosphate, DXP, pathway) has been difficult to optimize, so the researchers synthetically constructed and tested in piece-wise fashion (e.g., \"Top\" and \"Bottom\" operons) the entire S. cerevisiae mevalonate-dependent (MEV) pathway in E. coli. The researchers initially used a simple, orthogonal host platform to construct, debug, and optimize a large metabolic pathway 105 . They then linked the optimized heterologous pathway to a codon-optimized form of the plant terpene synthase, ADS, in order to funnel metabolic production to the specific terpene precursor to artemisinin. This work allowed them to build a full, optimized solution that could be ultimately and seamlessly deployed back into S. cerevisiae for cost-effective synthesis and purification of industrial quantities of the immediate drug precursor of artemisinin 106 .

This strategy was employed to lend mechanistic insight into a primary immunodeficiency, known as agammaglobulinemia, in which patients cannot generate mature B cells and as a result are unable to properly fight infections 83 . The researchers developed a synthetic testbed by systematically reconstructing the various components of the human B cell antigen receptor (BCR) signaling pathway in an orthogonal environment. This allowed them to identify network topology features that trigger BCR signaling and assembly. A rare mutation in the Ig\u03b2-encoding gene, identified in one patient, was then introduced into the synthetic system and shown to abolish assembly of the BCR on the cell surface, thereby linking this faulty pathway component with disease onset. Pathogenic viral genomes can similarly be reconstructed to study the molecular underpinnings of infectious disease pandemics.

To achieve post-transcriptional control over a target gene, the mRNA sequence of its 5\u2032-UTR was designed to form a hairpin structure that sequesters the ribosomal binding site (RBS) and prevents ribosome access to it. Translational repression of this cis-repressed mRNA could then be alleviated by an independently regulated trans-activating RNA that targets the stem-loop for unfolding. Engineered riboregulators were used in a subsequent study to tightly regulate the expression of CcdB, a toxic bacterial protein that inhibits DNA gyrase, so as to gain a better understanding of the sequence of events leading to induced bacterial cell death 87 . These synthetic biology studies, in conjunction with systems biology studies of quinolones (antibiotics that inhibit gyrase) 87 , led to the discovery that all major classes of bactericidal antibiotics induce a common oxidative damage cellular death pathway 88, 89 .

Ethionamide, currently the last line of defense in the treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis, depends on activation by the M. tuberculosis enzyme EthA for efficacy. Due to transcriptional repression of ethA by the protein EthR, however, ethionamide-based therapy is often rendered ineffective. To address this problem, the researchers designed a synthetic mammalian gene circuit, featuring an EthR-based transactivator of a reporter gene, and used it to screen for and identify EthR inhibitors that could abrogate resistance to ethionamide. Importantly, because the system is a cell-based assay, it intrinsically enriches for inhibitors that are nontoxic and membrane-permeable to mammalian cells, which are key drug criteria as M. tuberculosis is an intracellular pathogen.

A standard approach is to drive the expression of pathway components with strong and exogenously tunable promoters, such as the P L tet, P L lac, and P BAD promoters from the tet, lac, and ara operons of E. coli, respectively. To this end, there are ongoing synthetic biology efforts to create and characterize more reusable, biological control elements based on promoters for predictably tuning expression levels 111, 112 . Further to this, synthetic biologists have devised a number of alternative methods for biological pathway balance, ranging from reconfiguring network connectivity to fine-tuning individual components. A richer discussion of these topics, including the fine-tuning of parts, model-guided approaches, and the development of nextgeneration interoperable parts, is presented elsewhere 113 . In Box 4, we detail a few such synthetic biology strategies that specifically pertain to the optimization of metabolic pathway flux. These strategies span a spectrum from those driven by evolutionary techniques to those driven by rational design and in silico models, to those that combine both approaches.",

In the production of artemisinin precursors, the native E. coli isoprenoid pathway (DXP) was eschewed in favor of a heterologous pathway so as to circumvent the complex regulatory control imposed by the host (see Box 3c). In an alternative method of relieving regulatory control over the large number of DXP pathway components, Wang et al. 121 rapidly diversified and evolved, and thus optimized, the native DXP biosynthetic pathway in E. coli. The researchers developed a rapid, automated method for the in vivodirected evolution of pathways, which they termed multiplex automated genome engineering (MAGE); they then applied it to evolve the translational efficiencies of DXP pathway components to achieve maximal lycopene production. Specifically, cells were subjected to cycles of genetic modifications (via oligo-mediated allelic replacement) in an automated fashion to explore sufficient genomic diversity for optimizing biosynthetic pathways in laboratory time scales.

Typically, a component of interest (e.g., an engineered promoter, P*, or RBS sequence, RBS*) will be built into a simple test network. The network and its input/output data will then be fed into a model, which attempts to determine a parameter set that optimally describes the component's dynamics within the framework of the model. Finally, the optimized parameter set will be used to forward-engineer altogether new networks and components. For example, stochastic biochemical models have been developed to capture the expression dynamics of synthetically engineered promoters; these models were subsequently employed to predict the correct, in vivo behaviour of different and more complex gene networks built from the modeled components 122, 123 . Similarly, at the level of translation, thermodynamic models that predict the relative translational initiation rates of proteins can be used to rationally forward-engineer synthetic RBS sequences to give desired expression levels 124 . Such techniques harness modeled genetic parameters (transcriptional or translational) to predict the level of expression of proteins and enzymes within a network.",

In a hybrid rational-combinatorial approach, Dueber et al. 125 hypothesized that metabolic flux could be controlled by spatially recruiting the enzymes of a desired biosynthetic pathway using synthetic protein scaffolds. To construct the enzyme scaffolding, the researchers tethered protein-protein interaction domains from metazoan signaling proteins (e.g., GBD, SH3, PDZ domains) that recognize and bind cognate peptides fused to the enzymes to be recruited (atoB, HMGS, HMGR). By varying the number of repeats of an interaction domain, they could additionally control the stoichiometry of the enzymes recruited to the complex. Once again, using the heterologous MEV pathway in E. coli as a model, they combinatorially (albeit, at a significantly smaller scale) optimized the stoichiometry of the three enzymes responsible for producing mevalonate from acetyl-coA. Finally, they showed that the optimized synthetic scaffold could significantly increase product titer while also reducing the metabolic load on the host; in other words, their high product titers did not require the overexpression of biosynthetic enzymes in the cell.

For instance, circuits designed to sense the bioreactor environment and shift metabolic phases accordingly would further improve biofuel production. Alternatively, autonomous timing circuits could be used to shut down metabolic processes after a prescribed duration of time. Biological timers of this sort have been developed using genetic toggle switches that had been deliberately rendered imbalanced through model-guided promoter engineering 112 . These genetic timers were used to program the time-dependent flocculation of yeast cells to facilitate the separation of cells from, for instance, the alcohol produced in industrial fermentation processes.",

The Salmonella type III secretion system (T3SS) not only fulfills these criteria but also possesses a natural regulatory scheme that ties expression of the protein to be secreted to the secretion capacity of the cell; as a result, the desired protein is only expressed when sufficient secretion complexes have been built. The researchers needed only to engineer a control circuit that hitches their heterologous genes to the innate genetic machinery for environmental sensing and secretion commitment to obtain superior secretion rates of recombinant silk protein.",

Balancing these two modules involves engineering modularity and specificity into the various circuits.\u2022 Biosensor sensitive elements include environment-responsive promoters (transcriptional), RNA aptamers (translational), and protein receptors (posttranslational).\u2022 Biosensor transducer modules include engineered gene networks (transcriptional), non-coding regulatory RNAs (translational), and protein signal transduction circuits (post-translational).\u2022 Synthetic biology's contributions to therapeutics have included engineered networks and organisms for disease mechanism elucidation, drug target identification, drug discovery platforms, therapeutic treatment, therapeutic delivery, and drug production and access.\u2022 In the microbial production of biofuels and pharmaceuticals, synthetic biology has supplemented traditional genetic and metabolic engineering efforts by aiding in the construction of optimized biosynthetic pathways.\u2022 Optimizing metabolic flux through biosynthetic pathways is traditionally accomplished by driving the expression of pathway enzymes with strong, inducible promoters. New synthetic approaches include the rapid diversification of the various pathway components, the rational and model-guided assembly of pathway components, as well as hybrid solutions. ",
