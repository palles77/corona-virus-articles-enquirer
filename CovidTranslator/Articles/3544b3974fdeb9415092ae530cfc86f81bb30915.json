We evaluate this issue by including all consecutive allo-HCT recipients with molecularly-documented CARV infection during the first year after transplant. The study cohort was drawn from a prospective longitudinal survey of CARV in allo-HCT recipient having respiratory symptoms conducted from December 2013 to December 2018 at two Spanish transplant centers. Respiratory viruses in upper and/or lower respiratory specimens were tested using multiplex PCR panel assays. The study cohort comprised 233 allo-HCT recipients with 376 CARV infection episodes diagnosed during the first year after allo-HCT. Overall, 60% of CARV episodes occurred within the first 6 months (227 out of 376). Thirty patients (13%) had died at 3 months after CARV detection, of which 25 (83%) were recipients developing CARV within the first 6 months after transplant. Multivariate analysis identified four risk factors for mortality: ATG used as part of conditioning regimen [odds ratio (OR) 2.8, 95% confidence interval (C.I.) 1.21-6.4, p = 0.01], CARV lower respiratory tract disease (OR 3.4, 95% C.I. 1.4-8.4, p = 0.007), CARV infection within the first 6 months of transplant (OR 3.04, 95% C.I. 1.1-8.7, p = 0.03), and absolute lymphocyte count <0.2 \u00d7 109/L (OR 2.4, 95% C.I. 1-5.3, p = 0.04). Developing CARV infection within the first 6 months was associated with higher mortality. Our data supports that the timing of CARV development after allo-HCT could be of major interest.",

            "text": "Established and validated risk factors for progression from upper respiratory tract disease (URTD) to lower respiratory tract disease (LRTD) and mortality include recipient age, smoking history, high APACHE II score, lymphopenia, high-dose total body irradiation, high-dose steroids, and presence of copathogens [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] . Validated risk scores have recently been proposed to predict respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and influenza virus infections with greater accuracy [1, [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] . Despite the suspicion in real life practice that the timing of CARV infection after allo-HCT could be related to increased severity and mortality, there is a lack of strong evidence supporting this belief. Although current risk scores include timing of CARV infection relative to timing of allo-HCT, the cut-off time points vary between different studies. Immunosuppression status in allo-HCT has classically been divided into preengraftment (up to neutrophil recovery), early postengraftment (from engraftment until day + 100), and late postengraftment (after day + 100). Based on this classification, several studies have analyzed the impact of timing on severity and mortality in different CARV type scenarios, with inconsistent results. Most studies used the aforementioned cut-off time points of 30 days and/or 100 days and/or 6 months and/or 1 year after stem cell infusion for comparison. Accordingly, some studies found that developing a CARV infection within 30 days after transplant was linked to worse outcome [6, 10] whereas others did not [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] . In addition, studies using day + 100 as a cut-off time could not show significant association with outcome [19] [20] [21] [22] , while others observed worse outcome for CARV infections occurring before day + 180 [11] . Finally, while some studies found that CARVs beyond 1 year after allo-HCT showed favorable outcomes [23] , others did not [14, 17, 24] . In summary, most studies found no effect on patient outcomes regarding the timing of CARV infection development, but due to the discordant results, this issue remains unresolved and warrants further research.",

The Luminex xTAG RVP Fast v1 assay can detect adenoviruses (ADVs); human bocavirus (HBoV); human coronavirus (CoV) types 229E, HKU1, NL63, and OC43; influenza A virus A/H1N1, A/H3N2, and other influenza viruses (non-subtypificable); influenza B virus; human metapneumovirus (HMPV) A and B; HPIV 1, 2, 3, and 4A-4B; RSV A-B; and enterovirus/rhinovirus (EvRh). The CLART \u00ae PneumoVir DNA array assay differs from the Luminex xTAG RVP Fast assay in that it detects influenza C virus but does not allow the detection of the alphacoronavirus NL63 virus and the betacoronaviruses HKU1 and OC43. The CLART \u00ae PneumoVir is able to discriminate between rhinovirus and enterovirus genus, and it permits the identification of the new influenza A/H1N1v.

            "text": "This study shows that the timing of CARV infection during the first year of allo-HCT could be one of the major determinants of mortality, irrespective of CARV type. Our multivariate model showed that all-cause mortality at 3 months after CARV detection was significantly higher in recipients who developed CARV infection within the first 6 months of transplant. In addition, we found that ATG use as part of conditioning regimen, LRTD, and lymphopenia (<0.2 \u00d7 10 9 /L) were also associated with higher risk of mortality. Risk factors for mortality among the CARV LRTD episodes included early CARV LRTD (within the first 6 months), ATG as a part of conditioning regimen, and high-risk ISI category. Several studies have looked at the effect on mortality of when CARV infection occurs after allo-HCT using heterogeneous cut-off time points, showing discrepant results [6, 10, 11, [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] . In fact, most of them were unable to find any association between timing and mortality [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] 24] . In contrast, our detailed analysis of 3-month all-cause mortality conducted monthly during the first year revealed that most deaths occurred in recipients who developed a CARV infection within the first 6 months of transplant (see Fig. 1 ). We confirmed this observation in our multivariate model by including the \"6 months\" variable as an optimal cut-off time point in both overall and CARV LRTD. The differences observed between our study and others could be explained by two issues, the first being the risk of selection bias inherent to retrospective studies, with the inclusion of severe cases at any time after transplant. The power to detect differences in mortality according to the timing of CARV infection in severe cases is likely to be limited. Second, the most common cut-off time points used for comparison in prior reports were \"day 0 to +30 vs. day +31 to +365 vs. >day +365\" and before or after day +100 of transplant. The selected intervals of both comparators overlap with our \"6 month\" cut-off. This may have distorted the effect of timing on mortality in prior studies. However, our findings suggest that the aforementioned cut-off time points are probably not optimal enough to differentiate the mortality risk. In fact, we explored these cut-off time points in our cohort, observing no statistical differences in terms of mortality. To our best knowledge, only one study, focused on paramyxovirus CARV infections, included a cut-off of 6 months in their analysis of mortality and found statistically significant differences [11] . This is a predictable result since the 6-month cut-off corresponds to the anticipated length of immunosuppression in most allo-HCT recipients.",

We observed that the timing reported was consistent across all CARV types except HBoV (see Table 2 ). Our pooled analysis with different CARVs can be justified by the fact that several prior studies comparing mortality and/or OS according to CARV type showed no significant differences [23, 24, 31, 32] . Our findings underscore the need for further prospective studies analyzing in detail the effect of timing of CARV infections on mortality in allo-HCT recipients; this elucidation could be of utmost importance for diagnostic purposes, infectious control measures, and to close monitoring of recipients who develop CARV infections within the first 6 months after transplant. In addition, if timing is confirmed as a major predictive factor for CARV severity, this will certainly raise further unanswered questions. Can the well-established clinical and/or biological risk factors and/or immunodeficiency scores reliably predict mortality due to later developing CARV after transplant? To the best of our Except for influenza virus and to some extend for RSV, currently there is an urgent need of new effective antiviral drugs against other CARV types. Although many molecules are under development [33] , in the meantime the efforts should be focused on having a timely microbiological diagnostic and preventing CARV transmission, in particular during the first 6 months after transplant. Medical education/information emphasizing what symptoms should be reported immediately to the transplant team, urgent clinical evaluation, and risk stratification within 24-48 h after the start of respiratory symptoms, rapid application of sensitive diagnostic test and prompt initiation of antiviral drugs in treatable CARV, as well as the early identification and treatment of direct and indirect CARV-related complications may be of value. In addition, there is also an urgent need in educating not only patients and healthcare givers about the risk of transmission associated with CARV infection but especially healthcare workers, managers, workplace health and safety and infection control staff, and administrators [34] .",

Besides these, use of ATG showed a direct association with mortality in both overall CARV and those limited to the LRTD. This finding is unsurprising, as ATG produces lymphopenia and a significant delay in T cell immune reconstitution that lasts longer than 1 year after stem cell infusion [35, 36] . Finally, we have corroborated the value of the high-risk ISI category in predicting mortality in LRTD caused by several CARV types. ISI was developed by investigators from the MD Anderson Cancer Center to predict outcome in allo-HCT recipients with RSV [9] . This score demonstrated value in predicting LRTD progression [1, 10] and mortality [10] in the context of influenza respiratory infection and RSV [13] . However, the failure to differentiate risk of mortality between the moderate-risk and low-risk ISI category [10, 13] indicates room for improvement. In the meantime, the high-risk ISI category could be useful to assess the severity of several CARV types with LRTD involvement.",
