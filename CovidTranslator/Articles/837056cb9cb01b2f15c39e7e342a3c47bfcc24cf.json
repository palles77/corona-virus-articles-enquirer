It plays many pivotal roles in forming helical ribonucleoproteins 63 during packaging the RNA genome, regulating viral RNA synthesis during replication, 64 transcription and modulating infected cell metabolism [6] [7] [8] . The primary functions of N protein are 65 binding to the viral RNA genome, and packing them into a long helical nucleocapsid structure 66 or ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex 9,10 . In vitro and in vivo experiments revealed that N protein 67 bound to leader RNA, and was critical for maintaining highly ordered RNA conformation suitable 68 for replicating, and transcribing the viral genome 7,11 . More studies implicated that N protein 69 regulated host-pathogen interactions, such as actin reorganization, host cell cycle progression, 70 and apoptosis [12] [13] [14] . The N protein is also a highly immunogenic and abundantly expressed protein 71 during infection, capable of inducing protective immune responses against SARS-CoV and 72 At present work, we report the crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid N-terminal 87 domain (termed as SARS-CoV-2 N-NTD), as a model for understanding the molecular 88 interactions that govern SARS-CoV-2 N-NTD binding to ribonucleotides. Compared with other 89 solved CoVs N-NTD, we characterized the specificity surface electrostatic potential features of 90 SARS-CoV-2 N-NTD. Additionally, we further demonstrated the unique RNA binding site 91 characteristics. Our findings will aid in the development of new drugs that interfere with viral N 92 protein and viral replication in SARS-CoV-2, and highly related virus SARS-CoV. 93",

As shown in Fig. 3B, although CoV N-NTDs 177 all adapted similar overall organizations, the surface charge distribution patterns are different. 178 Consisting with our observations, previous modeling of related coronaviral N-NTDs also shown 179 markedly differ in surface charge distributions 24 . Superimposition of SARS-CoV-2 N-NTD with 180 three kinds of CoVs N-NTD are shown in Fig. 3C. Compared with SARS-CoV N-NTD, SARS-181 CoV-2 N-NTD show a 2.1 \u00c5 movement in the b-hairpin region forward to nucleotide binding 182 site (Fig. 3C, left panel). While compared with MERS-CoV N-NTD, SARS-CoV-2 N-NTD show a 183 less extended b-hairpin region, and a distinct relax N-treminal tail (Fig. 3C, middle panel). In 184 consistently, SARS-CoV-2 N-NTD show a distinct relax N-treminal tail, and a 2 \u00c5 movement in 185 the b-hairpin region backward to the opposite side of nucleotide binding site when the structure 186 is compared with HCoV-OC43 N-NTD (Fig. 3C, right panel). These differences dramatically 187 change the surface characterizations of the protein, may result in the RNA-binding cleft being 188 adaptive to its own RNA genome. 189 A potential unique drug target pocket in SARS-CoV-2 N-NTD 190 Although there are several CoV N-NTDs structures have been solved, the structural basis for 191 -NTD between SARS-CoV-2 with HCoV-OC43 are distinct, we next explored the differences 194 of RNA binding mechanistic basis with superimposition analysis. Previous studies had shown 195 that, HCoV-OC43 N-NTD contained Adenosine monophosphate (AMP)/ uridine 196 monophosphate (UMP)/ cytosine monophosphate (CMP)/ guanosine monophosphate (GMP) 197 binding site alongside the middle two b strands of its b-sheets core 40 . In the complex structure 198 of HCoV-OC43 N-NTD with ribonucleotides, the phosphate group was bound by Arg 122 and 199 Gly 68 via ionic interactions, the pentose sugar ribose 2'-hydroxyl group was recognized by 200 Ser 64 and Arg164, the nitrogenous base inserted into a hydrophobic pocket consisting of Phe 201 57, Pro61, Tyr 63, Tyr102, Tyr 124, and Tyr 126, mainly interacted with Tyr 124 via p-p stacking 202 forces(Fig. S3). It is proposed that this ribonucleotide binding mechanism are essential for all 203 coronavirus N proteins, applying to develop CoV N-NTD-target agents. 204To obtain the structure information of SARS-CoV-2 N-NTD ribonucleotide binding site, we 205 make a superimposition of SARS-CoV-2 N-NTD with HCoV-OC43 N-NTD-AMP complex. As 206 expectedly, the root mean square deviation (RMSD) between these two structure coordinates 207 are 1.4 \u00c5 over 136 superimposed Ca atoms. However, a number of difference around the 208 ribonucleotide binding site were shown as superimposition of SARS-CoV-2 N-NTD with HCoV-209 OC43 N-NTD. The major difference is N-terminal tail of N-NTD with sequence variation (SARS-210CoV-2: 48 NNTA 51 versus HCoV-OC43: 60 VPYY 63).

The N-terminal tail residues 242 (Asn 48, Asn 49, Thr 50, and Ala 51) is more flexible and extended outward compared with 243 equivalent residues in HCoV-OC43 N-NTD, possibly opening up the binding pocket into fitting 244 with viral RNA genomic high order structure.
