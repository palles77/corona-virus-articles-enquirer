Although the current Massachusetts (Mass)-and Connecticut-serotype vaccines usually offer sufficient protection, they are less effective in certain areas, such as China (CH) and Taiwan (TW) Wang and Khan, 2000; Yu et al., 2001) . Frequent point mutations and evolutionary fitness in the hypervariable regions (HVRs) of the spike 1 (S1) gene contribute to most of the antigenic determinants of IBV. Therefore, the S1 gene is often referred to as the index of genetic diversity and of viral evolution, due to its high variability and close genotype/serotype correlation (Dolz et al., 2008; Liu et al., 2006; Wang and Huang, 2000; Wang and Tsai, 1996) .",

            "text": "In addition to point mutation, RNA recombination is also involved in the generation of new antigenic variants. RNA recombination in a coronavirus was first demonstrated experimentally in mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) (Lai et al., 1985; Makino et al., 1986) , and a high frequency of recombination was found both in vitro and in vivo after MHV infection (Keck et al., 1988; Makino et al., 1986) . Recombination sites were detected throughout nearly the entire genome, and many recombinants with multiple crossover sites were found (Liao and Lai, 1992) . The high frequency of RNA recombination in coronaviruses is likely caused by the unique mechanism of RNA synthesis, which involves discontinuous transcription and polymerase jumping (Cavanagh, 2007; Lai et al., 1985; Liao and Lai, 1992; Makino et al., 1986) . Putative IBV genetic recombination in the S gene has been documented in different field isolates, including a Japanese strain (KB8523), European Avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) belongs to the Coronaviridae family and causes significant economic loss in Taiwan (TW), even in flocks that have been extensively immunised with Massachusetts (Mass)-serotype vaccines. Phylogenetic analysis of all non-structural and most structural genes shows that TW IBV is genetically distinct from the US strain and more similar to Chinese (CH) IBV. In contrast, the nucleocapsid (N) gene of TW IBV presents phylogenetic incongruence. RNA recombination at the 5 0 end of the N gene between TW and US IBV is shown to be responsible for this discordance. Surprisingly, the recombinant N gene is found in all of tested TW IBV isolates, suggesting that a recombination event gave origin to a founder lineage. Our data indicate that RNA recombination in the recombinant 5 0 end of the N gene may have caused the emergence of the current IBV population in Taiwan.",

Additionally, half of the nucleocapsid (N) gene of CU-T2 was further shown to be replaced by that of the Holland 52 (H52) vaccine strain, indicating that genomic RNA recombination in IBV may occur in multiple genes (Jia et al., 1995) . In Taiwan, phylogenetic analysis revealed that few TW IBV strains, such as 2992/02 and 3374/05, may undergo genetic recombination with CH IBV (Chen et al., 2009; Huang et al., 2004) . This experimental evidence and the sporadic detection of recombinant variants in nature support the notion that recombination occurs in coronaviruses (Kottier et al., 1995) . However, available evidence remains insufficient to allow the conclusion that coronavirus evolution can be driven by interspecies recombination. TW IBV, first isolated in 1964 (Lu et al., 1993) , can be classified into two individual serological groups, TW I and TW II, based on the sequences of the HVRs of the S1 proteins (Wang and Huang, 2000) . The Mass-serotype vaccine has shown a modest protective effect on the IBV outbreak in Taiwan (Huang and Wang, 2006; Lin et al., 2005) , possibly due to the considerable variation in S1 sequences between TW and US strains. In this study, we analyse TW IBVs and show that they are genetically closer to CH isolates than to US strains. The N gene of TW IBV is the only exception and shows phylogenetic incongruence. We further demonstrate that RNA recombination has contributed to this genetic discordance. The recombinant N gene is detected in all the analysed TW IBVs, suggesting that RNA recombination drives the evolution of this coronavirus at the population level.",

The nucleotide-sequence identity between TW S1 genes and those of US or CH isolates was similar (77-82%). The phylogenetic tree shown in Fig. 1A , which were constructed by BI, shows that TW IBV is a branch independent of the US and CH groups. Analysis of ML reproduces similar tree topology and the bootstrap values are illustrated together with the posterior probability (Fig. 1A) . Interestingly, the evolutionary divergence and ME methods indicated that TW IBVs are more closely related to the CH cluster than to the US group (Table 1 , Fig. 1B and Fig. S1 ), supported by less difference between TW-CH strains (Table 1 ) and the high bootstrap value (98%) for the branch separating the TW-CH groups from US group (Fig. 1B) , respectively.",

RDP analysis and three GARD algorithms all consistently showed high significance (p value = 1.9 \u00c2 10 \u00c03 to 3.5 \u00c2 10 \u00c09 ) to support the hypothesis of interspecies recombination with the breakpoint at nt 278 of gene 5. RDP-bundled algorithms also revealed one candidate crossover region between the TW and US genes, located between nt 278 and 757 of the queried sequences, covering the gene 5 and the 5 0 -terminus of the N gene (Fig. 5A ). For instance, the p values of the RDP and Bootscan algorithms were 5.1 \u00c2 10 \u00c04 and 1.0 \u00c2 10 \u00c05 , respectively.

To increase viral adaptability and fitness, coronavirus has evolved a unique discontinuous transcription system and 'copy-choice' genomic synthesis to achieve high efficiency of RNA recombination (Cavanagh, 2007; Lai et al., 1985; Liao and Lai, 1992; Makino et al., 1986) .

(A) For the RDP/Bootscan analysis, TW2575/98 was used as the query strain for potential recombination detection. TW2296/95 (solid line) and CU-T2 (dashed line) were used as parental sequences; CH-LX4 was as an outlier sequence. The black region represents a potential crossover within nt 278-757 of the queried sequences. The arrow indicates the suggested breakpoint at nt 278, proposed by both the Bootscan and GARD programs. The N gene, starting with the underlined ATG, is shaded (A). Alignments of the first 150 nt (B) and the deduced aa sequences (C) of N are illustrated. The CH IBVs in panel B and C are shaded to highlight their discrepancy.",
