Four groups of 63 (1\u00b15week-old) suckling, TGEV-seronegative pigs were used to assess the efficacy of the recombinant protein vaccine (group 3) in comparison with sham (group 1), commercial vaccine (group 2), and virulent TGEV Miller-strain-inoculated pigs (group 4). The TGEV-specific mucosal and systemic immune responses were measured after in vivo and in vitro stimulation with TGEV-antigens. The major T-cell subset distribution was analyzed in vivo and in vitro after stimulation of mononuclear cells with TGEV (from mesenteric lymph nodes of group 3 inoculated with TGEV-recombinant proteins). Induction of active immunity was assessed by challenge of pigs with virulent TGEV at 27 days of age. Baculovirus-expressed TGEV proteins coadministered with LT-R192G in IFA induced mesenteric lymph node immune responses associated with IgA-antibodies to TGEV and partial protection against TGEV-challenge. The high titers of serum IgG-and virus-neutralizing-antibodies to TGEV in group 3 pigs most likely reflected the dose of TGEV S-protein administered. At the day of TGEV-challenge, the in vitro stimulation of mononuclear cells from the mesenteric lymph nodes of group 3 pigs with inactivated TGEV resulted in an increase in double positive (CD4+CD8+), natural killer (CD2+CD4\u00c0CD8+dim) and cytotoxic (CD2+CD4\u00c0CD8+bright) T-cell phenotypes, Veterinary Immunology and Immunopathology 70 (1999) 203\u00b1221 : S 0 1 6 5 -2 4 2 7 ( 9 9 ) 0 0 0 7 4 -4 accompanied by increased expression of interleukin-2 receptor and a decrease of the null (CD2\u00c0CD4\u00c0CD8\u00c0/SW6+) cell phenotype. #",

The native TGEV Sglycoprotein (220 kDa) is the major structural TGEV protein capable of induction of virus-neutralizing (VN) antibodies and is responsible for virus attachment . For our experimental vaccine, the baculovirus-expressed TGEV S-recombinant (R2-2) which is truncated (150 kDa) but contains the four major antigenic sites (A, B, C, D) and induces VN-antibodies was used (Shoup et al., 1997; Park et al., 1998) . In addition, a baculovirus-expressed N-phosphoprotein (47 kDa) and M-glycoprotein (29\u00b1 36 kDa) were included because of their involvement in T-helper cell stimulation (Anton et al., 1995) and their effects on -interferon production , respectively. Although several non-toxic LT-mutants and recombinants have been prepared with partial knockout of the ADP-ribosyltransferase activity (O'Neal et al., 1998; Giuliani et al., 1998) , exploration of the mucosal adjuvanticity of such enzymatically inactive LT forms has not been adequately addressed in the context of their potential to stimulate IgA responses in farm animals.",

Genes coding for TGEV S-, N-, and M-proteins (Shoup et al., 1997; Pulford and Britton, 1991a; Baudoux et al., 1995) were cloned and expressed in a baculovirus-expression system as described (Shoup et al., 1997) . The amounts of TGEV-specific proteins contained within the baculovirus protein lysates were determined by the use of continuous-elution electrophoresis (Kyd et al., 1994) . Briefly, this involved applying 3.5 mg of solubilized (total) lysate protein to a manifold-tube of the BioRad Mini Prep Cell (BioRad, Hercules, CA) containing a 6\u00b110% separating and 4% stacking polyacrylamide gel based on the size of TGEV protein to be separated (S \u00b1 6%, N and M \u00b1 10%). Protein mixtures were fractionated based on their size at constant voltage (200 V) with a vacuum pump attached to collect the individual protein-fractions. The TGEV-specificity of individual fractions was tested by Western blot (Stott, 1989) using hyperimmune serum to TGEV Miller strain. The yield of TGEV S, N and M proteins was 0.15, 0.5 and 0.4 mg/ml, respectively, of the original (7 mg/ml) protein concentration which corresponded to 2, 7 and 6% of TGEV S, N and M proteins contained within the baculovirus lysates. The dose of TGEV recombinant proteins administered per individual pig was determined based on a doseresponse pilot experiment with age-matched pigs and the S-protein, as the dose eliciting the highest TGEV-seroconversion measured by a VN-test (50 mg). Because of the high amount of TGEV-proteins needed for double inoculation of 16 group 3 pigs and relatively high expression levels (2\u00b17%), the baculovirus protein lysates were IP-administered directly without the above semipurification step. The dose of other TGEV (N, M) and wild type baculovirus (ACNPV) proteins used was the same as that for the TGEV Sprotein (50 mg). Prior to IP-administration, the TGEV-specificity of all baculovirusexpressed protein lysates was tested by Western blot (Stott, 1989) using hyperimmune serum to TGEV Miller-strain. As an adjuvant, the thermolabile E. coli mutant toxin LT-R192G (which has a glycine instead of an arginine at position 192 of the protein rendering it nontoxic at adjuvant-effective doses) was used (courtesy of Dr. J.D. Clements, Tulane University). The second dose-response pilot experiment was performed with the LT-R192G adjuvant in order to assess its potential toxicity. In our suckling conventional pigs, none of the LT-R192G doses administered IP, ranging from 1\u00b125 mg/ pig, resulted in diarrhea. The adjuvant dose used in our study was 10 mg/pig. The second adjuvant used was incomplete Freund's adjuvant (IFA, Gibco, Grand Island, NY). IFA was mixed with an equal volume of TGEV-proteins containing the LT-R192G (2.5\u00b15 ml of total volumes).",

Briefly, ELISPOT was performed by using a coating antigen of acetone-fixed TGEV Miller-strain infected swine testis cell monolayers grown in 96-well cell culture plates. For the test, 100 ml of a MNC suspension (I, MLN, PBL) was added to each duplicate well at 3 cell concentrations (5 \u00c2 10 5 , 5 \u00c2 10 4 , 5 \u00c2 10 3 MNC/well) and plates were incubated for 6 h at 37 8 C in a 5% CO 2 atmosphere. After incubation, MNCs were removed by washing the plates six times in 20 mM Tris\u00b1HCL (pH 8.0) containing 0.15 M NaCl and 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20. Next, 100 ml of biotinylated MAB to porcine IgA or IgG (MAB 6D11 and 3H7, respectively) (Paul et al., 1989) in concentrations of 1 and 0.4 mg/ml, respectively, were added to each well for 2 h at 20\u00b122 8 C. The dark-blue spots resulting from reactions between the TGEVantigens and the antibodies secreted by the MNC were developed, using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin (Streptavidin POD conjugate; Boehringer Mannheim, Indianapolis, IN) and tetramethylbenzidine chromogenic substrate (TMB; Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories, Gaithersburg, MD). Numbers of antibody secreting cells (ASC) were counted as described by VanCott et al. (1994) . The ELISPOT was performed for MNCs isolated on the day of euthanasia (PCD 0 and 6\u00b17), which reflected the in vivo immune responses, or after 4\u00b15 days of incubation with 28 mg/ml of inactivated TGEV-Miller strain which reflected the in vitro responses of memory B-cells (MLN, PBL only). In vitro memory responses for ileal lymphoid tissues were not evaluated due to difficulties with maintenance of sterility in these cultures. The ELISPOT counts of ASC restimulated in vitro by TGEV antigens indicated the presence of TGEVspecific IgA or IgG memory B-cells in MLNs and PBLs of the vaccinated/infected pigs.",

Differences in distribution of Tcell phenotypes in vivo compared to in vitro immune responses in a single-color (CD25 and SWC6) or tri-color (CD2CD4CD8) setup were analyzed by the use of an indirect staining method. The MABs used as a primary reagent to stain the porcine lymphoid cell surface molecules were CD2, CD4, CD8, interleukin-2 receptor (IL-2-R/CD25) (VMRD, Pullman, WA: MSA4, 74-12-4, PT36B and PGBL25A, respectively) and porcine null cells (SWC6) (Serotec, Raleigh, NC: MCA1448). The secondary reagents were antimouse-IgG2a-Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC), anti-mouse-IgG2b-Tri-Color (TC), anti-mouse-IgG1-R-Phycoerytherin (PE) (Caltag, San Francisco, CA) and anti-rat-IgG-FITC (Caltag, San Francisco, CA). Isotype controls were mouse IgG2a, mouse IgG2b, mouse IgG1 and rat IgG (Caltag, San Francisco, CA). The MNCs were resuspended in buffer (PAB) composed of PBS, pH 7.3 containing 2 g/l of sodium azide and 2 g/l of bovine albumin at a concentration of 1 \u00c2 10 7 MNC per ml. Indirect staining for FCM was performed in U-bottom 96-well plates (Dynex, Chantilly, VA) where 100 ml of MAB diluted in PAB was applied, followed by 1 \u00c2 10 6 of MNC (100 ml). The MNC were incubated with MABs at 37 o C for 30\u00b160 min. After incubation with primary reagent, the MNC were centrifuged in 96-well plates at 435 \u00c2 g for 5 min, supernatants were aspirated, cell pellets resuspended in 100 ml of PAB buffer and washed 2 more times to completely remove the unbound primary reagent. After three washes, the secondary, labeled reagents (100 ml per well) were added to 100 ml of MNC suspension and incubated at 37 o C for 30\u00b160 min. After staining the MNC with secondary reagents, three washes were performed as described above and MNC were transferred to the labeled 12 mm \u00c2 75 mm glass tubes (Fisher, Itasca, IL) containing 100 ml of 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS, pH 7.3, followed immediately by thorough mixing. Each tube was capped with parafilm and refrigerated in the dark, on a shaker (40 rpm/min) for up to 1 month, then tested by FCM. Each set of samples contained the unstained MNC controls, secondary antibody only-stained controls and isotype controls in order to assess the cut-off between the stained and unstained cell populations. Each FCMmeasurement included approximately 100,000 events (Coulter Epics Elite; Coulter Corporation, Miami, FL).",

By measuring the percentages of selected T-cell phenotypes: CD2+CD4+CD8\u00c0, CD2+CD4+CD8+, CD25+, CD2+CD4\u00c0CD8+bright, CD2+CD4\u00c0CD8+dim and CD2\u00c0CD4\u00c0CD8\u00c0 (corresponding to T-helper, double positive, antigen-activated, cytotoxic T, NK and null cells, respectively), several differences in distributions of these phenotypes were observed after comparing in vivo and in vitro responses ( Fig. 3A and B) . After 4\u00b15 days of stimulation of MNC with inactivated TGEV, a significant (p < 0.05) decrease in the CD2\u00c0CD4\u00c0CD8\u00c0 phenotype and an increase in CD25+ (IL-2-R) expression occurred (Fig. 3) .

The most severe TGE-symptoms were observed in the TGEV seronegative control group 1 which did not possess any immunity to TGEV (Fig. 4A) . Although the group 4 (positive controls previously inoculated with virulent TGEV) showed a high degree of active immunity to TGEV at PCD 0 associated with lack of TGEV shedding, this group continued to be stunted and still exhibited mild dehydration (result of initial TGEV infection at 11 days of age) compared to age-matched pigs (group 1\u00b13). This impacted the group 4 TGE clinical scores measured after challenge at 27 days of age (Fig. 4A) . Groups 2\u00b13 (inoculated with commercial or recombinant TGE-vaccines) showed similar patterns of clinical signs which were completely ameliorated between PCD 6 and 9 (Fig. 4A) . TGEV shedding in feces better reflected the degree of active local immunity to TGEV (as detected by ELISPOT in I-and MLN-lymphoid tissues). At PCD 1, no shedding of TGEV-antigen was detected in group 4 pigs, followed by 38% shedding in group 3 pigs, 86% shedding in group 2 pigs and 100% shedding in the negative control group 1 pigs (Fig. 4B) . .

Several systems were used to express the TGEV S, M, and N proteins such as E. coli, salmonella, adenovirus, vaccinia virus and baculovirus (Britton et al., 1987; Pulford and Britton, 1991b; Godet et al., 1991; Enjuanes et al., 1992; Tuboly et al., 1995; Torres et al., 1995 Torres et al., , 1996 Smerdou et al., 1996; Shoup et al., 1997) . Although some protective antibodies were induced in inoculated animals, the protection was only partial (Torres et al., 1995) , not reported (Smerdou et al., 1996) or VN-antibodies were mostly IgG (Saif and Wesley, 1992; Shoup et al., 1997; Park et al., 1998) . Moreover, TGEV-immunogens expressed in procaryotes were not glycosylated, soluble or did not induce VN-antibodies (Saif and Wesley, 1992) . Human adenovirus vectors were reported to undergo an abortive replication in the porcine gut and loose the TGEV (S) inserts (Torres et al., 1996) . The S protein expressed in the baculovirus expression system induced VN antibodies to TGEV in the serum of rats and pigs after parenteral application (Tuboly et al., 1995; Shoup et al., 1997) . However, these serum VN-antibodies were not protective (Godet et al., 1991; Tuboly et al., 1995; Shoup et al., 1997) . Only IgG antibodies to TGEV were detected in sow's colostral and milk whey after a baculovirus-expressed S protein was administered with IFA intramammarily (IMM) and intramuscularly (IM) to TGEV seronegative pregnant sows (Shoup et al., 1997) . Moreover, there was no significant impact on litter morbidity or mortality after TGEV challenge exposure of these litters (Shoup et al., 1997) .",

The adjuvant activity of bacterial toxins such as Vibrio cholerae toxin (CT) and heatlabile enterotoxin (LT) from enterotoxigenic E. coli has been reported using the mouse model (McGhee et al., 1992; Katz et al., 1997) . Both CT and LT enhanced mucosal IgA responses, T-cell proliferation, IL-2 production and extended immunological memory (McGhee et al., 1992; Katz et al., 1997) . The ability to target IgA inductive sites makes LT and CT ideal mucosal adjuvants (if the toxic effects can be suppressed) after coupling or coadministration with other antigens, even poor immunogens (Wu and Russell, 1994) . Several non-toxic LT mutants and recombinants have been prepared with partial knockout of their ADP-ribosyltransferase activity (which is associated with enhanced cyclic AMP formation in the affected intestinal cells) (Giuliani et al., 1998) . As a nontoxic antigen carrier system, the LT-B subunit has been coexpressed as a fusion protein with TGEV-S in a Samonella expression system and some TGEV neutralizing antibodies were induced in a mouse model after oral administration (Enjuanes and Van der Zeijst, 1995) . However, further exploration of the mucosal adjuvanticity of enzymatically inactive forms of LT (mutants or recombinants) needs to be addressed in the context of its potential to stimulate IgA immune responses and protective immunity.",

Moreover the feasibility of accessing the GALT via the serosal surface after IP administration of antigens was suggested in general for mucosal vaccine formulations (Husband, 1993) . The IP immunization of preweaning and postweaning pigs with a killed E. coli vaccine reduced the mortality rate among vaccinated pigs by half that of unvaccinated controls (Husband and Seaman, 1979) . Thus, our hypothesis was that IP inoculation of pigs with recombinant TGEV structural proteins combined with recombinant LT may be used to deliver these vaccines to GALT and elicit intestinal IgA antibodies and protection to TGEV.",

IgAantibodies to TGEV were not detected in the serum of any group at PCD 0 except low titers in group 4 pigs, reflecting use of a non-replicating recombinant protein vaccine or killed TGEV administered IP. Coadministration of TGEV-proteins with LT-R192G resulted in local production of IgA-ASC as detected by ELISPOT at PCD 0 in the MLN (but not ileum) of group 3 pigs. In our previous studies, administration of baculovirusexpressed S with or without M recombinant proteins (IM, IMM, IP) without LT-R192G resulted in only systemic (IgG) and very low local (IgA) immune responses to TGEV, or IgA was not measured (Shoup et al., 1997; Sestak et al., 1997; Park et al., 1998) . In this study at PCD 0, the increase observed in both TGEV IgG-and IgA-ASCs after in vitro stimulation with inactivated TGEV-antigens (memory response) suggested that memory ASC for TGEV-specific IgA were present in groups 2\u00b14 (MLN-tissues) at the time of challenge (PCD 0), but there was no or very little transudation of IgA into the serum as measured by ELISA (<20) after vaccination. These findings are consistent with those of others who reported serum IgA-antibodies to TGEV only during the convalescent (>PCD 7) but not during the acute (<PCD 7) stage of TGE (Kodoma et al., 1981) . Other factors which most likely contributed to the lack of detectable serum IgA to TGEV in group 3 pigs prior to PCD 6\u00b17 was the use of a nonreplicating protein vaccine and the possibility that even when IgA ASC were induced locally in GALT as demonstrated by ELISPOT, the numbers of IgA ASC were low and the efficiency of transudation of IgA into the serum was low. In previous studies, it was found that in suckling pigs passive immunity against TGEV-challenge was mostly associated with IgA (Saif and Wesley, 1992) .",

Only the group 4 pigs (inoculated with virulent TGEV prior to TGEV challenge) showed higher numbers of TGEV IgA-ASCs at PCD 0 ( Fig. 2) in ileum and MLN tissues. In contrast even after in vitro stimulation with TGEV-antigens, no or very low numbers of TGEV-specific ASCs were detected at PCD 0 in group 2 (inoculated with commercial vaccine) reflecting the poor efficacy of the commercial TGEV vaccine used in our study in inducing IgA antibody responses. The highest numbers of TGEV IgA-ASCs among the 4 groups of pigs were found in group 4 pigs which did not shed TGEV at PCD 0\u00b15. In this group however, the previous TGEV-inoculation (at 11-days of age) resulted in marked stunting of pigs (compared to age-matched non-infected pigs), mild dehydration and a 33% mortality rate by PCD 0 when all groups were challenged with TGEV. It is important to mention, however, that evaluation of TGE-symptoms after infection of 27-day-old-pigs in this study was not as informative an indicator as it can be in future studies when recombinant TGEV proteins might be administered orally in the form of capsules to pregnant sows and TGE-symptoms then evaluated in neonatal pigs.",

            "text": "The induction of cell-mediated immunity after TGEV infection has been investigated by macrophage migration inhibition (Frederick and Bohl, 1976) , leukocyte migration inhibition (Woods, 1977) , direct lymphocyte cytotoxicity (Shimizu and Shimizu, 1979) , spontaneous cell-mediated cytotoxicity, antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (Cepica and Derbyshire, 1983) , and antigen specific lymphocyte proliferation (Brim et al., 1995) . Among all mammalian species studied, swine show the most diverse T-lymphocyte populations. The porcine T-cell populations are unique in that they contains several major subsets which do not exist or play only a minor role in other species. About 10\u00b150% of porcine T-cells show the CD2\u00c0SW1+ phenotype and this subpopulation has been referred to as porcine null cells (Binns, 1994) . Although the CD4 and CD8 antigens show a similar T-cell expression pattern compared to other mammals, i.e. T-helper cells and cytotoxic T-cells, respectively (Saalmuller and Bryant, 1994) , two unusual (major) subpopulations of porcine T-cells have been identified based on coexpression of these two antigens: CD4+CD8+ and CD4\u00c0CD8\u00c0, i.e. double positive and double negative or null cells (Pescowitz et al., 1994; Saalmuller and Bryant, 1994) . The exact function of these two enigmatic porcine T-cell subsets remains to be elucidated (Saalmuller et al., 1996) although the results from some studies suggest that porcine CD4+CD8+ T-cells exhibit properties of antigen experienced cells or memory T-cells (Zuckermann and Husmann, 1996) . It was reported that the TGEV-N-phosphoprotein contains at least 3 T-helper cell epitopes suggesting the involvement of T-helper cells in TGEV antibody synthesis (Anton et al., 1995) . In our study the impact of the coadministration of TGEV structural proteins with LT-R192G in IFA on the distribution of major T-cell subsets and expression of IL-2-R was measured at PCD 0 for MNC of MLN from the in vivo and in vitro (inactivated TGEV) stimulated cultures. The IL-2-R is expressed on the surface of antigen/mitogen activated, and not resting cells (Smith, 1988; Minami et al., 1993) . In our study we found significantly increased IL-2-R expression on MNC from the MLN of group 3 pigs after their in vitro stimulation with inactivated TGEV antigens as measured at PCD 0. The significant increase of IL-2-R expression was accompanied by a significant decrease in the CD2\u00c0CD4\u00c0CD8\u00c0 phenotype, suggesting the possibility of null cell transition into other, perhaps more functional cell types such as double-positive T-cells, NK-cells or cytotoxic T-cells. For group 3 the occurrence of double-positive, NK and cytotoxic T-cell phenotypes was increased for in vitro MLN cultures of MNC above the level corresponding to the in vivo responses but not significantly. Our data (increased occurrence of CD4+CD8+ and IL-2-R+ cells in vitro) are in agreement with investigators who suggested the involvement of T-helper cell epitopes in TGEV-antibody synthesis and that double-positive CD4+CD8+ T-cells show properties of memory T-cells (Anton et al., 1995; Zuckermann and Husmann, 1996) . The positive identification of porcine CD2\u00c0 null cells can be performed by detection of SWC6 antigen expression (Saalmuller and Bryant, 1994) . In our group 3 pigs, 33 AE 7% of MNC from MLN were identified as SWC6+. Considering the percentages and the standard errors (CD2\u00c0CD4\u00c0CD8\u00c0 phenotype: 44 AE 9% and SW6+ phenotype: 33 AE 7%), it is possible that the group 3 CD2\u00c0CD4\u00c0CD8\u00c0 MNC population consisted of predominantly SWC6+ cells and the rest were other cell-types not expressing CD2, CD4 and CD8 antigens such as B-cells, etc. In the case of porcine CD8+ cells, two different levels of expression (high and low or bright and dim) had been previously described as corresponding to cytotoxic T (CD8+bright) and NK (CD8+dim) cells (Pescovitz et al., 1988; . In our study both cytotoxic T and NK cell phenotypes were identified based on bright and dim expression of the CD8 antigen. After in vitro stimulation of group 3 MNC from the MLN with inactivated TGEV antigens (PCD 0), an increased number of cytotoxic T and NK cell phenotypes suggested an involvement of these cells in immune responses after IP-inoculation of pigs with baculovirus-expressed TGEV structural proteins. This finding is in agreement with the findings of others who observed NK-and cytotoxic T-cell activity after TGEV-infection of neonatal pigs (Cepica and Derbyshire, 1984) .",

Moreover, our results suggest that TGEV subunit vaccines based on baculovirus recombinants administered IP with LT-R192G can also actively stimulate systemic immune responses. The in vitro immune response in group 3 pigs at PCD 0 compared to the in vivo responses was associated with a significant upregulation of IL-2-R, the decreased occurrence of CD2\u00c0CD4\u00c0CD8\u00c0 (null cells) phenotype (p < 0.05) and the increased occurrence of CD4+CD8+ (double positive Tcells), CD2+CD4\u00c0CD8+dim (NK-cells) and CD2+CD4\u00c0CD8+bright (cytotoxic T-cells) phenotypes (p > 0.05). Further improvements in the efficiency of this type of vaccine could be explored by the use of additional carrier systems such as Immuno-Stimulating-Complexes (ISCOMs), biodegradable microspheres, etc.",
