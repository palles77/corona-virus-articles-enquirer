The aim of this study was to establish the dose-response relationship of the inhibition of proteolysis as assessed by FIZ with E-64 at different dosages in a murine model of fasciolosis. Maximum effective inhibition of proteolysis was achieved at 50 mg/kg/day (87%). Mice treated with this dose survived for a mean of 10.92 days more than untreated controls, and their ova counts and egg viability were significantly (P<0.05) lower than this latter group. These results indicate that intraperitoneal administration of E-64 not only inhibited liver proteolytic activity in a dose-dependent manner but also produced antifecundity and anti-embryonation effects, delaying the progression of fasciolosis. Yet, residual proteolysis may suggest that other E-64-non-sensitive enzymes are involved, or that E-64-enzyme chemical interactions are only capable of a partial agonistic-like effect.",

            "text": "Fasciola hepatica infection in cattle and sheep causes significant economical losses (Berasain et al. 2000) . At present, a number of drugs for the treatment of fasciolosis are available; yet, resistant strains are emerging. For example, reduced efficacy has been identified for closantel and triclabendazole (Mulcahy and Dalton 2001) . Hence, there is always a need for new chemotherapeutic agents against this trematode species. The cysteine proteases of F. hepatica represent attractive targets for chemotherapy development, as these enzymes play key roles in the life cycle of the parasite, such as evasion of host-defense mechanisms (Carmona et al. 1993) , tissue invasion (Dalton and Heffernan 1989; Berasain et al. 1997) , feeding (Yamasaki et al. 1989; Smith et al. 1993) , and egg output (Dalton et al. 1996) . Incubation of F. hepatica metabolic products with low-molecular-weight inhibitors abolished -thiol protease activity (Dalton and Heffernan 1989) . Furthermore, a more recent evaluation of F. hepatica-proteolytic activity in vivo using film in situ zymography (FIZ) demonstrated that 85% of the liver fluke cysteine proteases activity was inhibited by intraperitoneal administration of a dose of 50 mg/kg (M. Bogyo, personal communication) of N-[N-(L-3-trans-carboxyoxirane-2-carbonyl)-L-leucyl]-agmatine (E-64) (Alcal\u00e1-Canto et al. 2005) . Nonetheless, highest possible efficacy to inhibit F. hepatica proteolytic activity and anti-F. hepatica effects, and recognition of side effects of E-64, other than its teratogenic effect on early rat embryogenesis (Tachikura 1990 ), remain to be established in an animal model. Therefore, a dose-response relationship of E-64 assessing such variables was established.",

The mice were housed in cages in a temperature-controlled animal room (20-22\u00b0C) and allowed free access to water and fed a standard rodent diet (Rodent Lab Chow 5001, Purina). Metacercariae of F. hepatica were obtained by infecting Lymnaea cubensis snails, as described by Vera (1994) . The cysteine protease inhibitor N-[N-(L-3-trans-carboxyoxirane-2-carbonyl)-L-leucyl]-agmatine (E-64) (Sigma) was dis-solved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and the final concentration was adjusted with distilled sterile water. Each one of the mice belonging to infected groups received orally 15 metacercariae in suspension.",

A statistically significant difference was obtained between these two groups (P<0.05). A significant (P<0.05) reduction was also observed between each of the latter groups and the corresponding value for groups dosed with 50 mg/kg or more (P<0.05). There was also a statistically significant decrease in ova counts of groups given 50 mg/kg or more when compared to untreated controls (P<0.05). Eggs collected from the 50-, 100-, 200-, and 500-mg/kg treatment groups failed to embryonate in 44, 42, 43, and 43%, respectively. By comparison, 20 and 23% of ova from the 12.5-and 25-mg/kg treatment groups did not develop miracidia, respectively. A significant decrease (P<0.05) was observed for groups given 50 mg/kg or more when compared to these two treatment groups. This statistically significant difference was as well determined among the 50 mg/kg or more treatment groups and untreated controls, which developed miracidia at over 85% (P<0.05).",

            "text": "The intraperitoneal administration of 50 mg/kg/day of E-64 was the lowest possible dose capable of showing the highest anti-proteolytic effects in the liver of F. hepatica-infected mice, and was also effective in delaying the progression of this murine model of fasciolosis. Yet, regression analysis suggests a dose of 40 mg/kg as the lowest dose with highest efficacy (87%). Upon in vivo evaluation, higher doses were unable to improve the parameters set by the 50-mg/kg/day dose. Inability of E-64 to reach 99% inhibition of proteolytic activity complies well with findings by Hashida et al. (1982) who reported that the intraperitoneal injection of E-64 to rats inhibited cathepsin B activity to a certain extent only, and when higher doses were applied, further inhibition was not observed. They suggested that E-64 is incorporated into the cytosol in the free form, and then transported to lysosomes, where it binds to cysteine proteases. E-64, which previously has been shown to be a diagnostic tool in studies of cysteine proteases, has also been proposed as a possible therapeutic agent due to its potent inhibitory activity, stability and permeability into cells and tissues (Powers et al. 2002) . For example, the administration of E-64 reduced proteinuria in an experimental model of glomerulonephritis in rats (Baricos et al. 1988 ) and its effect has also been tested on the resorptive activity of osteoclasts (Delaisse et al. 1987 ). E-64 analogues have also been employed in biological studies and associated with attenuation of proliferation of parathyroid hormone in osteoblasts (Murray et al. 1997) , inhibition coronavirus protein processing and RNA synthesis (Kim et al. 1995) , as well as several other biological processes (Powers et al. 2002) .",

Nevertheless, incomplete reduction of gelatinolytic activity was observed on liver sections in all E-64-treated mice. It is postulated then that gelatinolysis may be caused by proteases other than E-64-sensitive cysteine proteases. Yet, it may also occur that proteolysis due to cysteine proteases might not be totally inhibited because of the partial inability of E-64 to fully interact or modify the catalytic domain of these particular F. hepatica enzymes.",

These results may therefore be taken to indicate that cysteine protease activity is involved in tissue invasion of F. hepatica as suggested by our previous work (Alcal\u00e1-Canto et al. 2005) . There seems to be a close relationship between the rate of proteolysis and the course of infection, showing that cysteine proteases are an important factor in the in vivo pathological effects of the parasite. The fact that E-64 strongly inhibited proteolysis caused by F. hepatica in liver is an encouraging finding, as mortality due to fasciolosis in sheep is a direct consequence of liver pathology caused by migrating flukes (Dalton et al. 1996) .",

A significant (P<0.05) decrease in ova counts was observed in the 50-mg/kg or more treatment groups when compared to counts in the untreated groups. Moreover, eggs from these groups had a 43% failure to embryonate. The exact mechanism by which E-64 affects fluke fecundity and egg viability is not known, but it is tempting to speculate that E-64 affects egg production and viability, as a result of the lack of nutrient acquisition by the liver fluke. Dalton et al. (2003) suggested that antibodies produced versus cathepsin L proteases may block cathepsin L activity, limiting parasite feeding, thus preventing amino acid intake and subsequently the synthesis of egg proteins. Vaccination of sheep with cysteine proteases of F. hepatica reduced worm fecundity and egg viability (Wijffels et al. 1994) .",

Analysis of the dose-response relationship yielded a maximum effective dose of 40 mg/kg/day. This efficacy was not linked to hepatic injury.
