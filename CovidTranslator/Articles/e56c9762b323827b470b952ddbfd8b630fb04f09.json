            "text": "Preterm birth is the most important problem in modern obstetrics. It causes significant infant morbidity and mortality and incurs an estimated annual societal economic burden in excess of $26.2 billion in the United States. 1 Spontaneous preterm births that occur following spontaneous preterm labour or preterm premature rupture of fetal membranes account for approximately two-thirds of preterm births. 2, 3 Decades of epidemiological and mechanistic research support the notion that spontaneous preterm birth is the clinical consequence of several possible aetiological pathways. 4 The 'syndrome' of spontaneous preterm birth may occur as a result of the convergence of the influence of a multitude of common, complex exposures. 4 In this regard, it is thought to be analogous to adult coronary artery disease. 5 A number of exposures have been implicated as risk factors for spontaneous preterm birth. These include cigarette smoking, maternal underweight, urogenital infections, poor socioeconomic status and African-American race. 4, 5 Certainly, our understanding of the environmental contributors to spontaneous preterm birth is incomplete. As has been the case with other common, complex conditions such as coronary artery disease, 6, 7 an exploration of seasonality of disease may provide a direction in the search for risk factors. In an effort to raise hypotheses regarding early pregnancy exposures that may predispose to preterm birth, we sought to determine whether the season of conception bore any relation to subsequent preterm birth. We focused on season of conception based on the notion that the aetiological roots of spontaneous preterm birth lie in the beginning of pregnancy, weeks to months before the clinically recognised events of parturition.",

Electronic and medical record data on all deliveries were obtained and collated from prenatal records and hospital charts, including delivery records. The database was surveyed periodically to maintain its accuracy by direct comparison at random with patient charts and by examining frequencies for variables that contain data outliers upon download which, once identified, were verified or corrected by means of medical chart review. The existence of personal identifying information in the perinatal database was eliminated to ensure that confidentiality of all patient records was maintained.

We calculated the estimated date of conception based on the date of delivery and gestational age at delivery. Preterm birth was defined as a delivery occurring at 20-36 completed weeks of gestation. We also studied preterm births occurring at 20-31 completed weeks of gestation. We defined a spontaneous preterm birth as a delivery occurring after preterm labour with intact membranes or preterm pre-labour rupture of the fetal membranes.",

Others examined the frequency of preterm birth related to the month or season of birth, and did not distinguish spontaneous from obstetrically initiated deliveries. In over 482 000 singleton pregnancies delivered in London from 1988 to 2000, Lee and colleagues found that the prevalence of preterm birth (gestational age 26-36 weeks) reached its peak in winter and steadily declined to its nadir in summer. 12 Investigators of two studies conducted in large U.S. populations reported that the lowest probability of preterm birth, defined as gestational age 29-37 weeks 13 and gestational age 27-35 weeks, 14 occurred among births in spring, and the highest probability was among births occurring in the second half of the year. A bimodal pattern with peaks of preterm birth prevalence occurring in winter and summer was observed in Japan. 15 Rayco-Solon and colleagues studied 1916 births in Gambian villages and found that the incidence of prematurity was lowest in births occurring in February (5%), and peaked in July (17%) and October (14%), which paralleled increases in agricultural labour and malaria infections. 10 In Zimbabwe, birth in the early dry season increased the odds of preterm delivery 2.9-fold [95% CI 1.7, 5.2]. 16 The inconsistencies in previous results are not surprising, given that they were conducted in dissimilar populations, regions of the world and climates, where environmental exposures that influence gestational length may fluctuate greatly. Furthermore, previous results are difficult to compare with ours because the timing of delivery does not perfectly correlate with timing of conception. Different definitions of preterm birth further complicate comparisons.",

            "text": "Indeed, the seasonal pattern in preterm birth that we observed, with highest prevalence among late winter/ early spring conceptions and lowest among late summer/early autumn conceptions, lends itself to several possible explanations. Seasonal variation in respiratory and gastrointestinal viral infections parallels that seen in our study. [17] [18] [19] Burguete and colleagues noted that early pregnancy infections with adeno-associated viruses were related to spontaneous preterm birth. 20 The mechanisms underlying this possible association are unclear but warrant further investigation. Another exposure with seasonal periodicity that parallels that seen in our data is allergy/atopy. 21, 22 The phenomenon of mast cell degranulation promoting myometrial contractility and preterm labour is well-described, and the contribution of a hypersensitivity response to the pathophysiology of preterm birth has been reported. 4, [23] [24] [25] [26] Interestingly, neonatal IgE concentrations also vary with season of birth in a pattern similar to that described in our study. 27 Other plausible mechanisms relate to the physical environment. Traffic-related air pollution in low socioeconomic status neighborhoods has been linked to preterm birth risk, particularly in winter months. 28 Ultraviolet sunlight exposure and maternal vitamin D status may also be relevant. Sunlight is the major contributor to vitamin D status. 29 Because of the seasonal variation in ultraviolet light, vitamin D nutritional status is best in summer and autumn and poorest in winter and spring. 30 Recent data suggest that vitamin D regulates key target genes associated with implantation and has anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects. [31] [32] [33] Therefore, it may contribute to the pathophysiology of preterm birth.",

As observed by Basso et al., 44 there is a seasonal variation in pregnancy planning. The most fecund couples will achieve pregnancy within their desired season, while the less fecund couples will be more likely to conceive outside of the preferred time period. If low fecundity is a risk factor for preterm birth (which has been noted in some 45, 46 but not all 47 studies), then the high-risk pregnancies will be unevenly distributed throughout the year. While this confounding bias cannot be controlled, its impact is likely to be small. 44 A similar bias may occur if women who lost their previous pregnancy attempt to conceive more quickly after their loss and outside of their preferred season. Nevertheless, we observed similar seasonal patterns in preterm birth among both primiparous and multiparous women (data not shown).",

LMP-derived gestational age is error-prone because mothers may not perfectly recall their LMP and may misinterpret the LMP owing to post-conception bleeding, delayed ovulation or intervening early miscarriage. Nevertheless, gestational age derived exclusively from the LMP was less likely in our dataset, as 78% of women who present for delivery in our hospital have had an ultrasound for dating at <20 weeks' gestation, and 92% of women have an ultrasound before delivery (Magee-Womens Hospital quality assurance data, 2006). As with any large delivery database, misclassification of preterm birth was possible. However, as the gestational age cut-point for preterm birth is lowered, misclassification is less likely. We observed a significant effect of season of conception with both earlier and later cut-points. It is possible that some births at 20 weeks' gestation (our lower cut-point for inclusion into the study), some stillbirths and miscarriages were misclassified as live-births. However, our database staff classifies deliveries with 1-min Apgar scores of 0 as stillbirths to reduce this misclassification.

Further investigation into the specific biological mechanism(s) for this finding could aid in efforts aimed at preventing preterm birth. Fitted seasonality of conception model for preterm birth <32 weeks' gestation (panel A) and spontaneous preterm birth <32 weeks' gestation (panel B). The models fitted to Fourier series used the first pair of Fourier terms (F1 model). The dashed line represents the proportion of preterm birth <32 weeks conceived per calendar month. The solid line represents the Fourier fit for the seasonality of conception of preterm births. ",
