This paper used two-dimensional time-resolved particle image velocimetry (2D TR-PIV) to measure the exhaled flow from a breathing thermal manikin. Since the exhaled flow is transient and periodic, the phase-averaged method was used to analyze the flow characteristics. The results showed that the velocity profile of the flow exiting the mouth was bell-shaped for exhalation and flat for inhalation. The exhaled flow showed different characteristics during each stage of the exhalation process. In the initial phase, a mushroom-shaped flow arose, while some jet characteristics appeared in the middle phase. The effect of thermal buoyancy and thermal plume on the exhaled flow was analyzed. Clear turbulence characteristics were found in the exhaled flow, and the turbulence fluctuation was very strong in the transition stage between exhalation and inhalation. The last finding was that the distribution and value of vorticity were different in each phase. The results of quantitative PIV provided detailed information about the boundary condition set and validation data for CFD simulation.",

Human breathing process can thereby be an important source of infectious diseases [4] that are transmitted through airborne droplets. The majority of droplets in human breathing are tiny or nuclei (smaller than 10 mm) [5] , and can follow the airstream [6] . In recent years, outbreaks of airborne infectious diseases have frequently occurred, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in over 25 countries in 2003 [7] , and the spread of the swine flu epidemic in 2009 [8] , which caused high morbidity and mortality worldwide [9, 10] . The World Lung Foundation has reported that more than four million deaths are caused by acute respiratory infections (ARIS) each year. Therefore, it is extremely important to investigate the characteristics of human exhalation flow and the dispersal of exhaled air to reduce the risk of spreading infectious diseases.",

When human breathing was considered as a contaminant source, different exhalation boundary conditions were used in these studies. In both early numerical studies [11, 14, 17, 18] and experiments [19e21] , a constant initial exhalation velocity was used. Under other circumstances, the real sinusoidal function [7, 13, 15, 16] or a very similar time-dependent function [22, 23] was used. One study that compared steady and unsteady boundary conditions found that the distribution of contaminants was quite different and suggested that the boundary condition of a sinusoidal exhalation should not be simplified [14] . In almost all the experiments [12, 24, 25] , only the velocity in the center of the exit was obtained, while the distribution of contaminants at the exit has never been illustrated. In general, the velocity profile at the exit is bell-shaped for a free jet [26] . So it could be inferred that the velocity profile for exhaled flow is also not flat at each phase either.",

Olmedo [12] suggested that the exhaled flow can be partly modeled as a vortex ring and partly as an instantaneous turbulent jet. Most studies only showed the trajectory of the exhalation from the mouth or nose using smoke visualization, or have measured the peak values for exhalation velocity using hot sphere anemometry [11e13,24] . Nielsen [25] showed that the peak value of instantaneous human exhalation flows can be described by an equation similar to the centerline velocity in a steady state jet. Marr investigated on turbulence intensity and anisotropy in the breathing zone, while the studies had little analysis about the turbulence characteristics of exhaled flow [27, 28] . In a word, few papers have described the turbulence characteristics of the exhaled flow. Xu [4] also pointed out that although the boundary conditions of a varying flow rate or velocity had been used in most of the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations of breathing, the turbulence features have not been clearly described. Thus experimental studies of exhaled flow are required. The precise measurement of the exhaled flow and analysis of turbulent statistics could help control the exhaled contaminant transmission and facilitate the selection of the best turbulence model for CFD simulations.",

The first kind of manikin had a steady breathing boundary. In some studies [20, 21] , the initial breathing momentum was ignored, with a very low initial velocity. Also, a mean velocity of the exhalation process was chosen as the boundary [19] . The others had an unsteady breathing boundary. Most of the unsteady boundary used sinusoid function. However, there could be a difference in breathing pattern. In some studies [4, 12, 13] , exhalation and inhalation of the manikin were carried out through different respiratory organ (mouth or nose) in a breathing process. The shapes of mouth in breathing process were also different. Some [12] were circular, and the others [4, 13] were semi-ellipsoid. However, in Marr's studies [27, 28] , the manikin exhaled through nose and also inhaled through nose. And in Marr's early study [27] , the breathing boundary was not sinusoid function. In a word, many different breathing manikins were used. Gupta pointed out that the exhaled flow rate of real human over time can be represent as a sinusoid function [10] . So in this study, the breathing manikin was used to breathe through mouth with a boundary of sinusoid function.",

All traditional anemometers can only measure the velocity information at the point of the probe sensor after a laborious process, making it difficult to conduct accurate and detailed measurement of multipoint turbulent airflows. Furthermore, traditional anemometry may disturb the local airflow to different degrees [31, 32] . Therefore, it could be more difficult to measure the exhaled flow using traditional velocimetry, which is more complex and unsteady comparing to free jet. However, sound measuring information can be obtained by particle image velocimetry (PIV) technique [27, 28] , for instance, Marr found that the local turbulence intensity had a threefold increase in the breathing zone by PIV technique, when compared to the ambient values [27] . PIV can capture velocities and related statistical information in the global flow domain in a very short time, and the airflow is not disturbed because no intrusive sensor probe exists [32] . Therefore, PIV may be the better velocimetry for measuring the exhaled flow in the study.",

The mockup was 1.2 m (length) \u00c2 1.0 m (width) \u00c2 1.5 m (height), with transparent walls, through which a laser can penetrate to form a light sheet for PIV measurements. One naked, breathing thermal manikin with a mouth (1.4 m in height when seated and a body surface area of 1.339 m 2 ) was used to simulate an average-sized male. The breathing thermal manikin consisted of four segments, including head, trunk, left leg and right leg. The surface of the manikin was wrapped with 2 mm nickel-chromium resistance wire (32 U/m). The sensible heat loss of the manikin was controlled at 75 W [32] and the sensible heat loss of each segment was listed in Table 1 . In the experiment, the manikin breathed through a mouth with a 12 mm diameter circular opening [10, 13] , as shown in Fig. 2 . The manikin had a respiration flow of 0.45 l per exhalation and a frequency of 15 breaths per minute, and the breathing condition was sinusoidal [10, 11, 34] . The angle of breathing flow was horizontal. The exhaled air temperature of human breath varies in different ambient air conditions, and it is about 32e36 C when the ambient air is 20 C [35] .

The laser beam was originally enlarged using a telescope, and then extended using a cylindrical lens to form a light sheet with an opening angle of about 30 and a thickness of 0.5 mm in front of the manikin's face. The camera was installed on a tripod and positioned perpendicularly to the light sheet. The camera and the laser were controlled to capture sequential pairs of images using a synchronizer. In the experiment, theatrical fog particles with a mean diameter of 1 mm were used as tracer particles since their density is similar to that of air.

The manikin experienced 75 exhalations in the process. To reduce the background noise, the upper part of the manikin was blackened using flat lacquer [32] . The analysis of the PIV images was conducted using the Dantec software package Dynam-icStudio. The background noise of the raw images was first removed using background subtraction. Then, an adaptive correlation algorithm supplemented with a pinpoint accuracy sub-pixel interpolation was used to extract the velocity vectors. The size of the interrogation window was 16 \u00c2 16 pixels with a 50% overlap, which led to a spatial resolution of 0.65 mm \u00c2 0.65 mm. PIV measurements can be affected by many error sources. The errors can divided into systematic errors and statistical errors [32] . The systematic errors are mainly induced by the tracking behavior and seeding density of the particle, the background noise, the random displacement error and so on [27, 32] . The statistical error is mainly the random error. According to the method in studies [32] , the uncertainty was less than 3.5% in the velocity field.",

Similar methods were also used in the studies [27, 28] . All these studies achieved good results. However, N was equal to 75 in Equation (1) of this study, while it was 500 in Marr's studies [27, 28] . Compared with the results obtained by Marr's studies, the statistical result of mean velocity was very good, while that of the vorticity and the turbulence intensity was less satisfactory. It may be induced by the value of N [32] , but a greater value of N will lead to a lower sampling frequency. Some key characteristics cannot be found by a low sampling frequency especially for the periodic flow. For instance, in the transition between inhalation and exhalation the turbulence fluctuation was very strong, such phenomenon may not be found with a smaller sampling frequency. So a trade-off had to be made between the sampling frequency and the number (N) of instantaneous sample for each phase, especially when the storage of the camera is limited. And it is suggested that the number of instantaneous samples for each phase should be equal to or greater than 75. Further study is need about the trade-off.",

As mentioned above, the precise boundary was obtained and it was noticed that the velocity was bell-shaped for each phase. However, for a bell-shape boundary, a greater number of meshed and more computing resources would be needed. If a simplified boundary was used as shown in Fig. 14 , the mean velocity was much less than the peak value, with a non-dimension velocity about 0.5. It is suggested that a comparison between measuring data and the simplified boundary was needed. The turbulence intensity is another important boundary condition. In previous CFD studies, it could be underestimated with a value of 0.5% [4, 7] , while in this study it may be very strong in the short time between inhalation and exhalation and it was also much greater than 0.5% in the whole process. Since turbulence plays a significant role in pollutant dispersion [27] , underestimating the turbulence intensity may lead to a poor prediction. The mean velocity, vorticity and turbulence intensity in each phase measured by PIV can provide validation data for CFD simulations. The results can provide help for the CFD simulation in enclosed space, for instance in aircraft cabins where airborne disease transmission always happens.",

It can be more difficult to measure the exhaled flow since the two nostrils have an angle with the horizontal plane about 45 and an angle with the intervening angle of 30 between the vertical planes. The flow characteristics may be different for the interaction of the two jets. In addition, compared with a real human, the shape of the manikin's mouth was simplified. For the diversity of human, the shape of mouth when breathing is various and irregular, which may have an effect on the characteristics of the exhaled flow. All these need further research.",

When choosing the sampling frequency and the number of the instantaneous samples for each phase, a trade-off had to be made and it was suggested that the number of the instantaneous samples for each phase should be equal to or greater than 75. (2) The breathing boundary should be set with a velocity inlet of a sinusoidal function over time in CFD modeling. In exhalation process, as the mouth exit velocity profile was bell- shaped for each phase, and the radial velocity gradient was quite large. While the velocity profile can be considered as a constant for each phase of the inhalation process. (3) The exhaled flow showed different characteristics during each stage of the exhalation process. In the initial phase, a mushroom-shaped flow was observed for the isothermal condition, while this structure became asymmetric due to the thermal plume and thermal buoyancy under the heated condition. In the middle phase, the exhaled flow exhibited jet characteristics, yet it had some differences from a free jet. Under the heated condition, the diffusion angle was greater, the decay of the centerline velocity along the axis was different, and the exhaled flow had greater entrainment. In the final phase, the jet characteristics gradually disappeared, and the exhaled flow had a clear upwards trend under the heated condition, promoting contaminant diffusion. (4) The distribution of the vorticity was also different at different phases. A pair of vortices was formed besides the mushroomshaped flow, and the vortex structure existed throughout the entire exhalation process. The exhaled flow had a large vorticity. In the initial phase, the distribution of the vorticity value was unique for the exhaled flow, with its maximum occurring in the center of the above-centerline and belowcenterline parts. In other phases, it was similar to a free jet. (5) The exhaled flow showed clear turbulence characteristics. In the short time between exhalation and inhalation, the turbulence fluctuation was quite strong. The mean turbulence intensity u 0 rms =U 4:c was about 0.055 at the center of the exit in the first half of the exhalation process, while it was about 0.092 in the second half of the exhalation process.",
