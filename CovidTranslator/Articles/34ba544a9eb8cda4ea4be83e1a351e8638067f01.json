To provide passive immunity, 18 lines of transgenic mice secreting a recombinant monoclonal antibody (Mab) neutralizing transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV) into the milk were generated. The genes encoding a chimeric Mab with the variable modules of the murine TGEV-specific Mab 6A.C3 and the constant modules of a human lgG, isotype Mab were expressed under the control of regulatory sequences derived from the whey acidic protein, which is an abundant milk protein. The Mab 6A.C3 binds to a highly conserved epitope present in coronaviruses of several species, which does not allow the selection of neutralization escape mutants. Antibody expression titers of 10' were obtained in the milk of transgenic mice that reduced TGEV infectivity 10'-fold. The antibody was synthesized at high levels throughout lactation. Integration of matrix attachment region sequences with the antibody genes led to a 20-to 10,000-fold Increase in the antibody titer in 50% of the transgenic animals. Antibody expression levels were transgene copy number independent and related to the site of integration.

To identify founder animals carrying transgenes, genomic DNA isolated from tail biopsies of the 278 animals born was first screened for the presence of the WAP-LC and -HC transgenes by PCR using primer pairs that hybridized with the WAP gene (5' primer) and with the immunoglobulin gene (3' primer). The pronuclear injection of these chimeric constructs led to the generation of a total of 46 transgenic mice that had integrated at least one of the transgenes ( Table 1 ).

This indicates that epithelial cells of the mouse mammary gland ( a non-B-lineage cell) perform adequate post-translational processing required for the correct expression and assembly of antibody molecules. The reduction in TGEV infectivity, higher than 10'-fold, observed with milk samples of selected transgenic animals, suggested that the antibody secreted could be sufficient to protect offspring against TGEV infection, similar to the protection provided by lactogenic immunity using immune sows'\u00b7'. Using the same WAP regulatory sequences, protein Chas been successfully expressed in pigs\"~'. These results suggest that the expression of rlgG1 under the WAP promoter probably will work in pigs. High levels of rlgG1 were detected in the milk of the transgenic mice from the first day of lactation, which supports the possibility of an effective protection of newborn offspring against TGEV infection. The kinetics of antibody production during lactation showed no reduction in the antibody synthesis after midlactation in transgenic mouse 132-3. Identical results were observed after two gestation periods of the same transgenic mice, but in others, a reduction in antibody synthesis after midlactation was detected ( data not shown).",

Among the mice that cointegrated MAR sequences with the rigG1 genes, no direct relationship between transgene copy number and rlgG1 expression levels in the milk was found. This suggests that transgene integration site determines transcriptional levels, as previously reported\". Interestingly, the highest expression levels were obtained only when MAR sequences were cointegrated with the antibody genes. The RIA titers for immunoglobulin production in the five MARmice were always below 10', while 8/16 MAR\u00b7 mice secreted antibodies with significantly higher titers.
