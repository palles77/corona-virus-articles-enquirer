            "text": "The ability of a pure virus infection to induce an acute phase protein response is of interest as viral infections are normally considered to be less ef\u00aecient in inducing an acute phase protein response than bacterial infections. This was studied in a bovine model for infection with bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV), analysing the induction of the two most dominant bovine acute phase proteins haptoglobin and serum amyloid A (SAA). Strong and reproducible acute phase responses were detected for both proteins, peaking at around 7\u00b18 days after inoculation of BRSV, while no response was seen in mock-inoculated control animals. The serum concentrations reached for SAA and haptoglobin during the BRSV-induced acute phase response were generally the same or higher than previously reported for bacterial infections in calves. The magnitude and the duration of the haptoglobin response was found to correlate well with the severity of clinical signs (fever) and with the extent of lung consolidation while SAA responded most rapidly to infection. #",

The bovine acute phase protein reaction has been reviewed most recently by Eckersall and Conner (1988) and Gruys et al. (1994) . Haptoglobin concentrations in healthy cattle are often undetectable (Makimura and Suzuki, 1982; Conner et al., 1986; Eckersall and Conner, 1988) but during an acute phase response bovine haptoglobin can increase 50\u00b1100 times (Conner et al., , 1989 Godson et al., 1996; Gruys et al., 1993) , making it the most prominent acute phase protein in cattle (Alsemgeest et al., 1994) . On the other hand, SAA is a remarkably moderate acute phase protein in cattle increasing around 2\u00b15 times during an acute phase response (Boosman et al., 1989; Gruys et al., 1993; Alsemgeest et al., 1994; Werling et al., 1996) . Nevertheless, SAA seems to react faster than haptoglobin in response to an acute phase protein inducing event (Gruys et al., 1993; Horadagoda et al., 1994) and the difference between serum concentrations induced by acute and chronic in\u00afammation, respectively, was found to be bigger for SAA than for haptoglobin in naturally infected cattle (Alsemgeest et al., 1994; Horadagoda et al., 1999) .",

As a rough guideline, severe BRSV infection correlated with haptoglobin concentrations above 1 mg/ml at day 7 p.i. while less severe infection correlated with concentrations above the detection limit but below 1 mg/ml at day 7 p.i. (compare Table 1 and Fig. 1A\u00b1C ). For SAA, concentrations around 30\u00b140 mg/ml were associated with mild disease and severe disease resulted in concentrations at or above 60 mg/ml. Although no reports have been published previously on the induction of SAA after viral infection in cattle, the SAA and haptoglobin concentrations reported here are within previously reported ranges for normal and acute phase concentrations in cattle after various experimental bacterial infections and aseptic in\u00afammations (Werling et al., 1996; Boosman et al., 1989; Alsemgeest et al., 1994; Horadagoda et al., 1999; Conner et al., 1986; Eckersall and Conner, 1988; Skinner et al., 1991; Gruys et al., 1993; McNair et al., 1997; Nakagawa et al., 1997) .",

Skinner et al. (1991) found that haptoglobin concentrations of more than 200 mg/ml indicated mild infection, values above 400 mg/ml diagnosed severe infection, while extended pathological conditions were typically associated with haptoglobin concentrations in the 1\u00b12 mg/ml range (Skinner et al., 1991; Saini et al., 1998) . In Godson et al. (1996) , maximum haptoglobin concentrations correlated with maximum rectal temperature, sick score, weight change and decreased zinc concentration as well as with death after experimental herpesvirus type-1/P. haemolytica co-infection. Alsemgeest et al. (1994) found that bovine SAA was a more sensitive indicator of acute disease than haptoglobin. Also, while a bovine SAA response was found within 360 min after intravenous LPS, no increase in haptoglobin was found in the same time frame (Werling et al., 1996) . Similarly, Horadagoda et al. (1993 Horadagoda et al. ( , 1994 found SAA to react more rapidly than haptoglobin to experimental P. haemolytica infection. The difference in the inducibility of SAA and haptoglobin by acute and chronic disorders, respectively, was recently con\u00aermed in cattle with various acute or chronic diseases (Horadagoda et al., 1999) and SAA was also reacting more rapidly and sensitively than haptoglobin in the present study (see above). In man, SAA is the acute phase protein that is most sensitive to viral infections (see e.g. van Leeuwen and van Rijswijk, 1994) .",

In other studies, viral infection, either experimental (bovine herpes virus followed for 4 days after infection (Godson et al., 1996) ) or natural (rinderpest virus (Spooner and Miller, 1971) ) did not give rise to elevated haptoglobin. However, an acute phase haptoglobin response was observed in foot-and-mouth disease virus infections (Ho \u00c8fner et al., 1994) , simultaneously with or a couple of days later than viraemia and clinical disease. Also, bovine herpes virus infections did lead to a haptoglobin response when animals were followed for more than 4 days p.i. (Godson et al., unpublished results) .",

Haptoglobin reacted with the biggest relative increase but SAA was most sensitive to BRSV-infection. None of the control animals showed any sign at any time of haptoglobin above the detection limit of the assay or SAA above normal levels even if Mycoplasma spp. were isolated from all control animals. It must be concluded therefore that bovine haptoglobin and SAA can react to viral infection. Considering the timing of the response and the correlation between the magnitude of the response and the severity of the infection, it can be established that viruses causing only local pathology can indeed induce acute phase responses, most probably indirectly via virus-mediated tissue perturbations.",
