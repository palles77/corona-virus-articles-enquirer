Detection of milder cases (or clinical management) seemed to have improved in recent months. Analysis of human clusters indicated that chains of transmission were not self-sustaining when infection control was implemented, but that R in the absence of controls was in the range 0\u00b78-1\u00b73. Three independent data sources provide evidence that R cannot be much above 1, with an upper bound of 1\u00b72-1\u00b75.",

            "text": "The earliest known human infections with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) occurred in Jordan in March, 2012, 1 with isolation and identifi cation of the virus from a patient in Saudi Arabia occurring some months later. 2 By Aug 8, 2013, 94 virologically confi rmed human cases and 17 probable cases 1,3-5 had been reported. Zoonotic exposure is suspected as the source of human infection, in view of the initially sporadic occurrence of cases together with the genetic similarity of MERS-CoV to bat coronaviruses. 6 However, epidemiological investigations of cases did not fi nd a consistent pattern of exposure to animals or the environment, 7 and, as of Aug 8, 2013 , the virus had not been isolated from any animal species. Recently, however, camels from Oman and the Spanish Canary Islands were discovered to have been previously infected by the MERS-CoV or a closely related virus. 8 The high apparent casefatality ratio in reported cases is cause for concern: as of Aug 8, 2013, WHO reported that 46 of the 94 virologically confi rmed cases had died; 7 this death toll is expected to rise since some patients are still in hospital. 9 Although progress has been made in characterising the epidemiology of MERS-CoV, many uncertainties remain. 10 Little is known about the extent of human infection or the degree of detection bias towards more severe cases. If the severe cases currently being detected represent only a small sentinel minority of a much larger number of milder cases (as occurred early in the 2009 H1N1 pandemic in Mexico 11 ), the case-fatality ratio might be substantially lower than what current surveillance data suggest. Conversely, for the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic of 2003, little evidence of undetected mild or subclinical infections existed, 12 even after detailed serological follow-up studies. 13 In the absence of robust community-based serological surveys for MERS-CoV, assessment of the extent of undetected infection must rely on epidemiological inference. Another essential aspect of risk assessment is the characterisation of transmissibility, and a study 14 concluded that transmission levels were under the epidemic threshold in detected clusters. 14 However, since stringent control measures were implemented in many of those clusters, the transmissibility in the absence of such controls is still unknown.",

Alternatively, the growth could be generated by an epidemic in an animal reservoir, with associated increasing incidence of spill-over infections in human beings. Irrespective of the scenario, we can use estimates of doubling times to derive an upper bound for R. Under the assumption that growth outside detected clusters is driven by human-to-human transmission, R would remain close to 1: for T G =12, R=1\u00b721 (95% CI 1\u00b702-1\u00b753) from an analysis of the fi ve more recent sequences and R=1\u00b710 (95% CI 1\u00b706-1\u00b713) from the timing of incident clusters; for T G =7, R=1\u00b712 (95% CI 1\u00b701-1\u00b729) from an analysis of the fi ve more recent sequences and R=1\u00b706 (95% CI 1\u00b704-1\u00b708) from the timing of incident clusters.

Since the four returning non-resident traveller cases were clinically severe, this fi rst analysis refl ects missed severe clinical cases. This contrasts with the genetic analysis that estimates the number of all infections in both man and animals (albeit assuming the generation time of infection in the same in all species).

If the epidemic is driven by human-to-human transmission, it is plausible that visitors might have a lower risk of infection than locals (because of inhomogeneous mixing patterns). By contrast, in the alternative scenario of an animal reservoir such as camels, 8 visitors could be at greater risk of infection if they were more likely to be in contact with the reservoir than locals.

So the scenario of R slightly above 1 in the absence of control measures cannot be ruled out from these data. We found that the size of clusters (and R cluster ) decreased over time, which might be explained by shorter delays in onset to detection and control.

The growth in the rate at which clusters are detected could be explained by an increase in the reporting rate rather than a true increase in incidence rate (appendix). However, the genetic analysis, which is less sensitive to temporal variation in levels of case detection, suggests that the observed increased incidence of cases and clusters in 2013 is not just a reporting artifact. A caveat to the estimation of R index is that there might be a surveillance bias towards detecting clusters which have an index case that causes multiple secondary cases. However, it is notable that each of the four reported cases in travellers caused one or two secondary cases (mean R=1\u00b775) on their return to their country of residence, and yet detection of secondary cases occurred after the identifi cation of infection in the index traveller. Transmission probabilities might be boosted in populations with comorbidities in which many of the clusters took place; on the other hand, R index might underestimate transmission in the absence of controls if interventions were promptly implemented after onset in the index case.",

Many of these sequences were from the Al-Hasa outbreak, and so although very interesting, do not add to the population dynamic inferences. During late revision stage, we repeated our analysis with these new sequences. Our analysis is most directly similar to their fi gure 3, an analysis of 11 representative sequences. We further removed two sequences (Al Hasa 8, so that the outbreak is only represented once, and Bisha-1 because of the controversy surrounding it and the encephalomyocarditis virus), and added the new Paris sequence. Based on this new dataset, we estimated the molecular clock rate at 1\u00b70 \u00d7 10 -\u00b3 substitutions per site per year with 95% credibility interval (6\u00b78 \u00d7 10 -\u2074-1\u00b73 \u00d7 10 -\u00b3) that overlaps the estimates of Cotten and colleagues. 18 We conclude that a slowly growing epidemic is underway, but current epidemiological data do not allow us to determine whether transmission is self-sustaining in man. Our analysis demonstrates that the transmissibility of MERS-CoV in man is close to the critical threshold of R=1 required for self-sustaining transmission. If R is greater than 1, then the number of human cases we estimate to have occurred to date make it highly likely that self-sustaining transmission has already begun. If a human epidemic is underway, the low estimated value of R (<1\u00b73-1\u00b75) and evidence of severe infection in secondary cases from case clusters suggest that intensive public health measures around cases, coupled with improved case ascertainment, are suffi cient to contain spread and reduce morbidity and mortality. However, an important caveat to this conclusion is the unknown extent of mildly symptomatic or asymptomatic infection and the role it might have in transmission. 19 Our analysis indicates a high proportion of infections are not currently being detected. The reported case data therefore probably represent the severe end of a wider clinical spectrum of disease, though a case-fatality ratio higher than 10% cannot be ruled out from present data. Paradoxically, a low case-fatality ratio might make control more diffi cult, if mildly symptomatic cases prove to be responsible for most transmission.",
