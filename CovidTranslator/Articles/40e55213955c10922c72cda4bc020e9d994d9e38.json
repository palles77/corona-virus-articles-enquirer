Influenza infection recurs each year due to a high incidence of mutation of its hemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N) antigens, and these determine its virulence. When mutations occur concomitantly in both the H and N antigens, pandemics with potentially high degrees of morbidity due to the lack of immunity may ensue ( Fig.  8.8 ). 16 H1N1 influenza was responsible for an epidemic in this country, and sporadic cases have persisted. Patients dying with this infection were often relatively young and their lungs showed DAD with prominent areas of hemorrhage. 17 Currently, epidemiologists are carefully monitoring the evolution of an avian influenza in Southeast Asia for evidence of spread to humans. Influenza is the most common cause of viral pneumonia, although most cases are subclinical. The virus most commonly causes a diffuse tracheobronchitis/bronchiolitis in which the normal ciliated respiratory epithelium is sloughed. 18 However, when DAD develops, it can carry a high mortality even in the absence of acute bacterial superinfection ( Fig. 8.9 ). 19 The lungs in DAD due to influenza in patients with prolonged survival often develop prominent squamous metaplasia of bronchoalveolar lining cells (Fig. 8.10A ). Although these findings are characteristic, they are also nonspecific, so that immunostains, in situ hybridization, electron microscopy, or viral antigen detection may be required to establish the diagnosis (see Fig. 8 .10B). Superinfection by pyogenic bacteria, including Haemophilus influenza, group A Streptococcus, and Staphylococcus are a well-recognized complication and may mask evidence of a healing influenza infection.",

Intubated patients receiving chronic ventilatory support are at increased risk due to local barotrauma from inflated endotracheal tubes. The respiratory mucosa is the primary target ( Fig. 8.21 ). At times, extensive necrosis of an ulcerated airway suggests the diagnosis, but immunostaining for herpes viral antigen can demonstrate high background staining, obscuring the diagnosis. 27 When this is the case, examining paraffin-embedded tissues by electron microscopy can reveal diagnostic virions (Fig. 8 .22A to C).",

The acute cellular response is neutrophilic, but this is followed within days by alveolar filling with exudate macrophages that ingest the infected exudate, the gray hepatization (see Fig. 8 .35C).

The morphology of giant cells may be an indicator of whether host cell-mediated immunity is adequate in containing tuberculous infection. Prior to the development of effective cell-mediated immunity, many giant cells in the lesions show nuclei that have aggregate towards one pole of the multikaryon (Fig. 8.58A ), whereas when infection is effectively contained, Langhans giant cells with peripheral nuclei or giant cells with centrally placed nuclei predominate (see Fig. 8 .58B).

However, the most common and greatest difficulties in diagnosis can arise in distinguishing small, regular microcalcifications in GMS-stained sections because they can closely resemble degenerate yeast (Fig. 8.78) . The presence of irregular calcifications is a clue to their actual nature, but at times, ultrastructural examination may be required to exclude infection. In the immunosuppressed host, disseminated infection is primarily distributed within interstitial and alveolar macrophages (Fig. 8.79 ). 71 Extension of infection from a peribronchial lymph node can produce mediastinal granuloma, a lesion characterized by dense whorled hyaline fibrosis with aggregates of plasma cells (Fig.  8.80A ). Organisms are rarely identified in the areas of paucicellular scarring, and this form of the disease appears to be immunologically mediated. At times, necrotizing granulomatous inflammation is concomitantly present and confirms the diagnosis (see Fig. 8 .80B). The lesion can entrap the large vessels of the mediastinum, leading to the superior vena caval syndrome and death. Surgical excision is required but not always technically possible.",

Whereas the clinical and histologic features of this disorder are most frequently caused by hypersensitivity to Aspergillus spp., other fungi (e.g., Candida spp.) can yield a comparable syndrome. A subset of patients with cystic fibrosis develops concomitant ABPA, and establishing the diagnosis in this setting can be difficult. 41 Bronchocentric Granulomatosis. Bronchocentric granulomatosis (BCG) appears to reflect an abnormal cell-mediated response to Aspergillus spp. and less commonly other fungi (e.g., Candida spp. and C. immitis), in which small-caliber airways develop circumferential granulomatous inflammation, loss of the normal lining respiratory epithelium, and impaction of the airway lumen by granular basophilic mucin admixed with cellular debris (Fig.  8 .99A to C). The disorder may be first noted radiographically as isolated or multiple airway-centered nodules. 87 BCG may be seen as part of the spectrum of findings in ABPA or as an isolated disorder. As in ABPA, fragmented hyphae may be difficult to identify and surrounding areas of eosinophilic pneumonitis are common. When the disease is suspected clinically, it can be treated noninvasively with corticosteroids; however, definitive resection may be undertaken to exclude neoplasia. of high oxygen tension, such as lung or sinus cavities but do not develop in tissues. They are composed of a vesicle with one or two layers of phialides that produce the infective conidial spores, and the morphology of the fruiting body allows for accurate speciation in situ. In general, the specific diagnosis of \"aspergillosis\" should be avoided unless the aspergil is identified because other fungi can be morphologically virtually indistinguishable in tissue. Diagnoses are therefore optimally phrased as \"acute-angle branching hyphae consistent with aspergillus.\" Immune Disorders Due to Aspergillus Infection. Aspergillus spp. give rise to a spectrum of disorders, some reflecting hypersensitivity responses to the organisms, whereas others are the consequence of invasive infection (Fig. 8.97 ). Distinguishing these is critical for the proper management of these disorders.",

The galactomannan assay is relatively specific for invasive aspergillosis and is rarely positive in mucormycosis, which can be helpful in distinguishing them noninvasively. The sensitivity is somewhat higher in the BAL than is serum. 93 However, this test should not be used to screen patients for aspergillus infection because its sensitivity in the nonimmunosuppressed and noninvasive disease is limited. Whereas both Aspergillus spp. and Pseudallescheria are sensitive to voriconazole, Pseudallescheria is resistant to amphotericin. The sensitivity of Fusarium spp. to most antifungal antibiotics appears to be both unpredictable and limited. In all cases, culture remains the gold standard for diagnosis. Immunohistochemical reagents that can distinguish between hyphate fungi exist but are not are broad (5 to 25 \u00b5M), pauciseptate, tending to branch at right angles ( Fig. 8.111A ), although acute-angle branching does occur and its presence should not dissuade one from the correct diagnosis. The hyphae of the Zygomyces are well stained by hematoxylin, and they have a proclivity to produce ribbonlike structures (see Fig. 8 .111B), but caution in diagnosis is required because treated aspergillus can assume this appearance.

However, transmission to humans from infected animals has been recognized from antiquity as a complication of wool sorting (wool sorter's disease). An epidemic of inhalational anthrax occurred in 1979 at a biofacility in Sverdlovsk, in the former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR), and in 2001 there was a limited epidemic of anthrax due to contaminated letters sent through the US mail service by an unidentified terrorist. 106 Cutaneous penetration by the bacillus produces a necrotic eschar with rapid extension to blood vessels, resulting in bacteremia, sepsis, meningitis, and death. However, the most deadly form of infection is pulmonary. In these cases the bacilli are inhaled, which evokes a localized hemorrhagic pneumonia and associated pleural effusion. Organisms proliferate rapidly in the lung, where they produce a localized hemorrhagic pneumonia with scant neutrophilic reaction, (Fig. 8.132 ) and spread via the pulmonary lymphatics to the regional lymph nodes to produce hemorrhagic mediastinitis, followed by bacteremia, toxic shock, and death in a high percentage of cases. The diagnosis must be suspected and treated early to be curable.
