Thus, complete genomic information is critical for the effective control of human viral disease. However, until recently, public databases, with the exception of HIV, contained limited full genome sequences for many viruses; only partial genomic sequence obtained by targeted amplification of specific genes had been available for diagnosis and analysis of emerging and re-emerging viruses [7] . To address the lack of full length viral genomic data, several large scale viral genome sequencing projects (in addition to efforts in the area of HIV genome sequencing) have been funded by agencies such as the US National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) within a comprehensive microbial sequencing project to produce publicly available sequences for thousands of influenza virus, dengue fever virus, coronavirus, HCV and rotavirus samples [101] . Some of the expected outputs of these projects were to standardize methods for rapid and accurate viral genome sequencing and to provide a large data set for the analysis of temporal and spatial changes leading to the emergence of selected viral infectious diseases. These projects have demonstrated the importance of determining full length viral genome sequences in order to provide a comprehensive picture of viral evolution, pathogenesis and transmission between human and animal [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] . During the same period of time, viral metagenomics studies have also emerged and focused on examining the diversity, ecology and even discovery of viruses and the overall community of viruses that reside in a wide variety of terrestrial and aquatic environments, as well as detecting viruses that exist in human tissues, saliva and feces [13] .",

Available sequences for specific RNA viruses are downloaded from public domain databases then aligned using publicly available software. The output of the alignment ( Figure  1A ) is manually inspected for regions of sequence conservation and primers are designed manually or using an automated primer design pipeline. In the absence of perfect sequence conservation in a region, a degenerate primer is designed. During synthesis, each primer is usually linked to a M13 tag to facilitate high-throughput direct sequencing of amplicons. Sequence reads are then assembled and areas of low coverage are targeted for genome closure ( Figure 1C ). Ideally, this procedure aims to achieve four-to-sixfold sequencing coverage for any region of the genome; in cases of poor sequence quality or low amplification leading to low coverage (i.e., less than fourfold coverage by two separate amplicons) the corresponding area is selected for direct PCR amplification followed by sequencing of the PCR product to increase the coverage level and validate the consensus sequence.",

These methods depend on the concentration of viral particles and reduction of the amount of host nucleic acid present (by chemical or nuclease treatment) so as to enable the use of random amplification of viral genomes. Initial sequence-independent approaches focused mostly on viral DNA by using linkers to ligate and amplify viral DNA followed by construction of shotgun libraries (Linker Amplification Shotgun Library [LASL]; [18] ) and some modified versions such as the expressible-LASLs [19] . For practical purposes, the LASL method contains three steps: fragmentation of DNA using the Tsp509I restriction endonuclease; ligation of a single linker at either end of the fragmented DNA; and PCR amplification of linker-associated DNA with a linker-targeted primer. The resulting DNA, ranging from 0.5 to more than 4 kb, is cloned in a TOPO TA vector. The decision to use a specific vector depends on whether there is need to select for expressing clones or simply recombinant clones. For functional genomics and metagenomic screening, the choice of the pBAD TOPO TA vector for the selection of expressing clones led to the identification of anti-Bacillus lysins, and an aerolysin from a bacteriophage genome and a community of genomes [19] [20] [21] . Notwithstanding the success of the use of LASL for sequencing partial or full length viral genomes it is not well suited to use for RNA viruses, which cannot be detected using this method.",

            "text": "In order to develop a method applicable to both DNA and RNA viruses, several research groups have developed and adapted modifications of the sequence-independent single primer amplification (SISPA) of viral genomes and coupled it to the construction of a plasmid library, mass sequencing of random library clones, and assembly of sequences into full or near fulllength viral genomes [14, 16] . We propose an adaptation of the original 'random-PCR' [22] that we refer to as the random priming (RP)-mediated SISPA or RP-SISPA. The RP-SISPA method is based on random reverse transcription of viral RNA followed by annealing of excess primers to cDNA and conversion into dsDNA by Klenow polymerase and PCR amplification. The reverse transcription is performed using a chimeric primer containing a fixed sequence of 20 nt and a random hexamer attached to its 3\u2032-end. The PCR is subsequently conducted using a single primer derived from the fixed portion of the chimeric primer used for the reverse transcription ( Figure 2) . For viral DNA (ssDNA and dsDNA), the RP-SISPA procedure begins with the denaturation of DNA followed by annealing of random primers onto ssDNA and the use of the Klenow enzyme to fill the gaps, thus generating a dsDNA. The product of the Klenow reaction is subsequently used as a template for PCR amplification using a single primer. The PCR products, usually ranging in size from 300 to 2600 nt, are purified and cloned into a plasmid vector. Random clones are selected from the library and then sequenced and assembled to build full length viral genomes. We have successfully used the RP-SISPA method to obtain the complete genome sequence of RNA viruses ranging in size from 3000-15,000 kb including the full length genome sequences of a total of 78 rhinovirus isolates available at the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) [Palmenberg et al., Sequencing and analyses of all known human rhinoviruses genomes. Science (2008); Submitted manuscript]. Alternatively, PCR products can also be processed differently without cloning. We have size-selected PCR products and use fragments of 300 to 600 nt in length for 454 pyrosequencing. In doing so, we have explored the possibility for use of the 454 pyrosequencing for ultra high-throughput sequencing in parallel of several viral genomes as described in the next section.",

            "text": "Recent advances in sequencing referred to as the next generation sequencing (NGS) methods [23] [24] [25] have revolutionized many aspects of genomics and are rapidly replacing the conventional Sanger sequencing strategy for many applications by offering greatly increased data output with reasonable costs [26] . Current NGS methods can generate approximately 100 Mbp (for 454 with a read size of ~240 nt), 800 Mbp (for Solexa with a read size of 25-40 nt) and 1200 Mbp (for the sequencing platform SOLiD\u2122 with a read size of 25-30 nt) of DNA sequence from a single run. Parameters such as read length, the ability to generate mate pairs, and resolution of homopolymer runs significantly influence the choice of any of the three NGS methods for either de novo sequencing or a re-sequencing project. Based on read length and sequence accuracy, the 454 method has arguably emerged as the best candidate for large scale sequencing of RNA viruses. However, due to the high cost of one 454 sequencing run and the relatively small sizes of RNA viruses, optimal use of the 454 requires multiplexing of several viral isolates. Given the output of the 454 pyrosequencing (currently at 100 Mbp bases) it is in principle possible to multiplex hundreds of RNA viral genomes in a single run with adequate coverage to resolve sequence polymorphisms. There have been several successful attempts to barcode different samples and demonstrate the use of 454 for multiplex genome sequencing [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] . All these barcoding attempts used 2, 4 and 10-nt barcodes and targeted the sequencing of fractions of genomes such as mtDNA, rDNA, a specific class of RNAs, small interfering RNAs and a section of the HIV genome for mutations in the context of drug resistance. Despite these successful attempts, there is still a need to develop a much more robust barcoding strategy coupled to 454 pyrosequencing or any of the next-generation sequencing methods for multiplex viral genome sequencing. Given the small sizes and relatively low complexity of viral genomes, it is anticipated that the level of throughput provided by 454 pyrosequencing may effectively allow the complete genome sequencing of several viruses in a single run.",

It utilizes 20 nt-long barcodes that are integrated into the viral genome during the RP-SISPA and then are used to differentiate RNA isolates by bioinformatics analysis of the sequence output. Our preliminary experiments [Djikeng et al., Unpublished data] have demonstrated the possibility of mass sequencing of up to 33 different influenza and 33 human rhinovirus genomes per half-454 pyrosequencing run. Detailed analysis of the data output indicated that the sequence space from half of a 454 run could even produce full or near full length of approximately 100 viral genomes (genome size ranging from 6 to 15 kb) at approximately 10\u00d7 coverage. This approach may, in the near future, allow the full length or near full length sequencing of several hundred isolates of viruses, thus allowing a good understanding of viral evolution and also to develop a rapid disease agent identification and intervention during an outbreak.",

            "text": "At this time, the field of viral genomics is providing thousands of sequences of viral isolates per year. The current bottleneck is caused by the relatively low sequence space provided by Sanger sequencing methods and the difficulties inherent in closing highly divergent viral genomes. With the advent of the NGS methods, sequence data generation will be limited only by the rate of collection, culture and extraction of viral RNA. It is expected that within the next 3-5 years the methodology will exist for mass sequencing of hundreds to thousands of viral genomes in a single reaction. Potential applications of such capability could be for the analysis of thousands of viral isolates during an outbreak or during a season. In conjunction with increased collection and association of epidemiological and ecological metadata this will enable a rapid examination of viral evolutionary processes in near real time. Additionally, large scale coordinated studies using the NGS to generate sequence data from individual human hosts and their viral pathogens will greatly increase our understanding of viral evolution within the context of selective pressures in the human host. The random priming-sequence-independent single primer amplification begins with the design of two primers. Primer 26 is a chimeric oligonucleotide with a 20 nt sequence fused to a random hexamers sequence. Primer 20 is made up of the 20 nt of the chimeric primer. Primer 26 is used for reverse transcription of viral RNA followed by a Klenow reaction after the excess primer 26 is annealed to the single stranded cDNA. For viral DNA, primer 26 is annealed to denatured viral DNA followed by a Klenow reaction. The dsDNA product of the Klenow reaction is then used for a PCR amplification using primer 20. The PCR product is made up of a heterogeneous mix of amplicons with sizes ranging from 200 to 2500 nt. A fraction of the amplicons mix is used for sequencing using either Sanger (after cloning into the TOPO TA vector) or 454 pyrosequencing. ",
