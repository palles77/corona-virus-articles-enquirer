Aguirre * Francisco Esmaile de Sales Lima esmaile.sales@gmail.com wild birds. Upon vaccination, IBV generates antigenic variants that can result in incomplete protection (Cavanagh 2005) . Coronaviruses phylogenetically related to IBV were largely detected in several wild bird species in Northern England, as well as novel viruses that are not associated to classical IBV types (Hughes et al. 2009 ). This was also reported in the Beringian area between Alaska and Siberia (Muradrasoli et al. 2010 ) and in wild bird surveillance carried out in Hong Kong and Cambodia (Chu et al. 2011) .

Briefly, the nPCR was performed as follows: the first reaction was performed in a 25-\u03bcL volume containing 20 ng of cDNA with primers (CoV-F1 and CoV-R1). The cycling conditions were 5 min at 95\u00b0C, 40 cycles of 45 s at 94\u00b0C, 40 s at 49\u00b0C, 45 s at 72\u00b0C and a final incubation at 72\u00b0C for 7 min.

Sequences recovered from dabbling and whistling ducks were closely related to sequences isolated from gulls in Russia (Muradrasoli et al. 2010) , sharing up to 93 % of similarity on the nucleotide level. The fact that some sequences were more closely related to IBV strains highlights the question on the original reservoirs of IBV, if domesticated or wild birds (Hughes et al. 2009 ).

These related sequences were reported in the Commander Island, Russian Federation (Muradrasoli et al. 2010) , highlighting not only its potential of geographic distribution but the interspecies transmission, as such, very similar viruses can be detected in different avian species: ducks, plovers, herons, weavers, waders, small water birds, and painted snipes.
