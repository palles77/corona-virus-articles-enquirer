Among the many seminal discoveries of NIH immunologists are the cloning of T cell antigen receptor \u03b2-chain; the discovery of interleukin 2 (IL-2), IL-3, IL-4 and IL-15, as well as of chains of the IL-2 receptor; the elucidation of the three-dimensional structure of antibodies; and the co-discovery of the causative agent of HIV-AIDS. This extraordinary assemblage of researchers and clinicians, including world leaders in the immunology field, nurture the development of new generations of immunologists with a PhD and/or MD at the NIH's state-of-the-art laboratories and Clinical Center facilities. Immunologists across the NIH share membership in the Immunology Interest Group, which currently has over 500 members. This group promotes interactions inside and outside the community through scientific activities such as its weekly Lectures Series. Another important activity is its yearly workshop, a two-day symposium that gathers the NIH's immunologists, largely from the intramural program. At this workshop this community can be seen in action, with senior investigators providing one-on-one feedback to trainees presenting their research work and engaged in exciting discussions, all on one central topic: immunology. The NIH intramural immunology community also has cross-fertilizing groups, such as the NCI Center of Excellence in Immunology, the trans-NIH Center for Human Immunology and the Translational Immunology Section at National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases.",

Accordingly, research projects are geared toward the acquisition of critical knowledge in areas that facilitate the development of novel regulatory paradigms and provide scientific support for the development and application of new regulatory policy and decision-making. While undertaking a dual role as a researcher-reviewer can be challenging, the hands-on expertise in bioanalytical methods in silico and in vitro, as well as in animal models that can be used to improve product characterization, provides reviewers with knowledge to understand the products they regulate.

Improved understanding of the factors involved in protein immunogenicity has led the industry to improve bioanalytical characterization and clinical monitoring, as well as to develop tolerizing regimens where indicated. Together this has resulted in improved therapeutic efficacy and product safety. It is thorough such understanding of basic science, current technology and patient needs, as well as the challenges of existing therapies, that has pushed scientists at the FDA to advocate the concept of 'biobetters'-that, is the generation of new, improved versions of existing biological agents that would benefit patients by diminishing the adverse outcomes of many diseases and might reduce health care costs.",
