(16) first isolated the A 59 strain and reported properties similar to those of JHM. Sturman (27) reported on the pH dependence of MHV-A 59 infectivity. At 37 \u00b0 C, virus infectivity was most stable between pH 6.0 and 6.5 whereas at 4 \u00b0 C, virus was stable over the range of pH 4 to 8. Hirano et M. (14) determined that MHV-2 was heat-labile but was protected from inactivation at 56 \u00b0 C by 1 M magnesium chloride or 1 M magnesium sulphate. This virus was also stable at pH 3 to 9 at 37 \u00b0 C for 60 minutes. In summary, it appears that physieo-chemieal properties differ within the eoronavirus group according to the experimental conditions and the intrinsic properties of the virions. In the present study, we report on some of the physieo-ehemieal properties of MHV-A 59 grown on DBT cells.",

The DBT murine cell line (13) was kindly supplied by Dr. Michael J. Buehmeier (Scripps Clinic and l~eseareh Foundation, La Jolla, CA, U.S.A.) and grown at 37 \u00b0 C in Earle's minimum essential medium/ Hunk's M 199 (1:1, v/v) supplemented with 5 percent (v/v) foetal calf serum (FCS) and 0.13 percent (w/v) sodium bicarbonate (Gibco Canada, Burlington, Ontario). Plaque assay of MHV-A 59 was carried out by a modification of the method reported by Hirano et al. (13) in 35 mm diameter tissue culture 6-well cluster plates (Flow Laboratories, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada). All samples were homogenized by vortexing and ultra-sonieation for 5 to 10 seconds in order to eliminate possible virus aggregates before dilution and inoeula\u00a2ion. After one hour adsol~)tion at 37 \u00b0 C on a rocker platform, the virus inoeula were removed, the monolayers overlaid with medium containing 1.5 percent (w/v) bucto-agar (Difco Laboratories, Detroit, MI, U.S.A.), 0.05 mg/ml gentamycin and 10 percent (v/v) FCS. Plates were incubated for 48 to 72 hours at 37 \u00b0 C, fixed with 9.25 percent (v/v) formMdehyde and stained with erystM violet.",

            "text": "The pH sensitivity test described in Fig. 1 was also perIbrmed in buffers without sodium chloride, with similar results (data not shown). The sensitivity of MHV-A 59 to ionic strength was further investigated with sodium chloride concentrations of 0 to 500 mM added to solutions of 10 mM Tris acid maleate pH 6.0, containing 5 percent (v/v) FCS. Ten-fold dilutions of virus in these buffers were incubated at 4 or 37 \u00b0 C for 6 hours and stored a t -7 0 \u00b0 C On the other hand, Wallis and Melnick (30, 31) found t h a t 2 M sodium ions (Na +) e n h a n c e d inactivation of enteroviruses (non-enveloped RNA viruses) at 37 \u00b0 C whereas it p r o t e c t e d t h e m from inactivation at 50 \u00b0 C. F u r t h e r m o r e , Na \u00f7 conferred some protection to vaccinia and adenoviruses from heat, inactivation (32) . As shown in Fig. 2 , the A 59 strain was rapidly (25 minutes) inactivated at 56 \u00b0 C. It was significantly protected by 1 \u2022 magnesium chloride for at least 30 minutes, and slightly m o r e by 1 M magnesium sulphate. H e a t stability has not been associated with morphological characteristics such as the presence of an envelope or nucleic acid type. Indeed, poxviruses, papovaviruses and reoviruses were relatively stable when incubated at 50 \u00b0 C for 30 minutes whereas herpes simplex viruses, adenoviruses, enteroviruses and m3~xoviruses were labile in similar conditions (10). Nevertheless, m o s t corona-viruses were reported to be inactivated within l0 to 30 minutes at 56 \u00b0 C as we have shown for MHV-A 59 (19, 20, 29) . The effect of divalent cations, such as magnesium, has been shown to vary according to the virus and the salt used. Wallis et al. (33) showed that stabilization of polioviruses by salts could not be generalized to cations or anions. Indeed, 1 M magnesium chloride stabilized entero-and reoviruses whereas 1 M magnesium sulphate did not stabilize enteroviruses and enhanced inactivation of reoviruses (31, 33) . In addition, l M magnesium chloride enhanced inactivation of adeno-, papova-, herpes-, myxo-and poxviruses whereas myxoviruses were the only one stabilized by 1 M magnesium sulphate (22, 33) . In the coronaviruses family, TGEV was not protected by 1 M magnesium chloride at 50 \u00b0 C for 60 minutes (18) whereas IBV was protected for 80 minutes at 50\u00b0C by 1 M magnesium sulphate (5) . On the other hand, Hirano et al. (14) found that MHV-2 in 1 M magnesium chloride or sulphate was not inactivated after heating at 50 \u00b0 C for 15 minutes, results similar to those obtained in our studies on MHV-A 59. The kinetics of virus inactivation at 4, 22 and 3 7 \u00b0 C were studied and the results are presented in Fig. 3 . The virus was relatively stable for 3 months at 4 \u00b0 C whereas infectivity was unmeasurable after 14 days at 22 and 37 \u00b0 C (<200 PFU/ml). The 37 and 4\u00b0C samples were kept in the dark but t~he 22\u00b0C sample was in room light and might have increased the inactivation rate at 22 \u00b0 C above that at 37 \u00b0 C. Manaker et al. (16) observed that the infectivity titre of the A 59 strain was not altered after 7 months at 4 \u00b0 C. Other authors described coronaviruses as slowly inactivated at 37 \u00b0 C and moderately stable at 4\u00b0C in optim~l suspending medium (19, 29) . On the other hand, some TGEV strains were inactivated in less than 4 days at 37 \u00b0 C (II, 18) and MHV-2 showed a 400-fold decrease in infectivity after 24 hours at 37 \u00b0 C (14) . However, it is not clear whether the other components of the suspending fluid were comparable in these experiments.",
