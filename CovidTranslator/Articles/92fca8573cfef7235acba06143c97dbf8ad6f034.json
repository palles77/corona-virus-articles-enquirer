Methods RAW264.7 cells (a murine macrophage-like cell line) were cultured in the absence or in the presence of PTS2 (3-10 lM) together with or without IFN-c (10 ng/ml). IP-10/CXCL10 expression was measured by specific enzyme-amplified immunoassays and reverse transcriptase-PCR (RT-PCR). Phosphorylation of JAK1, JAK2 and STAT1 were detected by Western blot analysis. Results We found that PTS2 inhibited IFN-c-induced up-regulation of IP-10/CXCL10 protein level in a doseand time-dependent manner in RAW264.7 cells. RT-PCR experiments showed that PTS2 suppressed IFN-c-induced IP-10/CXCL10 expression at mRNA levels. Mechanistically, PTS2 prevented phosphorylation of JAK1, JAK2 and STAT1, but did not interfere with the p38 pathway. Furthermore, the inhibitory effect of PTS2 on IP-10/CXCL10 up-regulation was slightly stronger than JAK2 inhibitor AG490.",

IP-10/CXCL10 binds its receptor CXCR3 to play a biological role in stimulation of monocytes, natural killer (NK) and T cell migration, regulation of T cell and bone marrow progenitor maturation, modulation of adhesion molecule expansion and inhibition of angiogenesis [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] . The expression of IP-10/CXCL10 has also been observed in a wide variety of chronic inflammatory disorders and auto immune conditions [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] . Recently, it is reported that SARS-CoV may instigate an excessive immune response through overproduction of IP-10/CXCL10, MCP-1 and IL-8, resulting in transendothelial infiltration and accumulation of neutrophils, alveolar macrophages and Th1 lymphocytes into lung tissue causing pulmonary inflammation and destruction [19] . Previous studies have shown that IP-10/CXCL10 could be an excellent prognostic marker for SARS disease progression [20, 21] . IP-10/CXCL10 is also induced by hepatitis C virus (HCV) in hepatocytes for recruiting inflammatory cells into the lobules and acts as an important predictor of chronic HCV infection progression [22] . Thus, IP-10/CXCL10 is considered as a predictive marker of successful treatment response in HCV/HIV-coinfected patients [23] . In addition, Kong et al. [24] have reported that IP-10/CXCL10 levels are increased in SLE, and serum IP-10/CXCL10 may represent a more sensitive marker for monitoring disease activity than standard serological tests.",

We thus evaluated the effects of PTS2 on IFN-c-induced JAK1, JAK2 and STAT1 activation in RAW264.7 cells. The cells were pretreated with 3.0, 5.0, 10.0 lM of PTS2 for 2 h or not, and then incubated with IFN-c (10 ng/ml) for 30 min. Western blot analysis showed that JAK1, JAK2 and STAT1 were markedly activated by IFN-c stimulation, whereas PTS2 treatment led to a reduction in IFN-cinduced JAK1, JAK2 and STAT1 phosphorylation in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 4a) . Next, RAW264.7 cells were treated with PTS2 (5.0 lM) for 2 h or not, and then incubated with IFN-c (10 ng/ml) for 0-60 min. As assessed by Western blotting, IFN-c rapidly (within 3 min) increased the phosphorylation of tyrosine residues 1022/1023 of JAK1 and 1007/1008 of JAK2, and tyrosine 701 of STAT1 (Fig. 4b) . PTS2 decreased the phosphorylation of JAK1, JAK2 and STAT1 in a timedependent manner (Fig. 4b) . When RAW264.7 cells were treated with different concentration of IFN-c (1-10 ng/ml), a dramatic and concentration-dependent JAK1, JAK2 and STAT1 phosphorylation was observed (Fig. 4c) .

Western blot analysis was performed by using antibodies to JAK1, p-JAK1, JAK2, p-JAK2, STAT1, or p-STAT1, respectively. GAPDH was used as control. b Cells were incubated with PTS2 (5.0 lM) for 2 h or not, followed by stimulating with IFN-c (10 ng/ml) for 0-60 min, respectively. Cell lysates were subjected to Western blot analysis. c Cells were pretreated with 5.0 lM PTS2 for 2 h or not, and then stimulated with different concentration of IFN-c (1-10 ng/ml). d Cells were pretreated with PTS2 (5.0 lM), AG490 (30.0 lM) or both of them, respectively, for 2 h, and then incubated with IFN-c (10 ng/ml) for 24 h.

Previous reports showed that the selective pharmacological JAK2 inhibitor AG490 could significantly inhibit upregulated chemokine expression induced by IFN-c in mouse mesangial cells [29] . Therefore, we compared the effects of PTS2 and AG490 on IFN-c-induced IP-10/CXCL10 expression. RAW264.7 cells were pretreated with PTS2 (5.0 lM) or AG490 (30.0 lM) or both of them, respectively, for 2 h, and then incubated with IFN-c (10 ng/ml) for 24 h. The cell culture supernates were subjected to ELISA analysis to measure IP-10/CXCL10 protein levels. As shown in Fig. 4d , PTS2, at concentration of 5.0 lM, proved more effective in suppressing IFN-c-induced IP-10/CXCL10 expression than 30.0 lM of AG490. Furthermore, IFN-c-induced IP-10/CXCL10 expression in the cells co-incubated with PTS2 and AG490 together was lower than in those treated with either PTS2 or AG490. Taken together, these results suggested that PTS2 inhibited IFN-c-induced IP-10/CXCL10 expression in RAW 264.7 cells through suppressing activation of JAK/STAT1 signaling pathway.",

Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) represent one of the most widely used drug classes, including aspirin, indomethacin, phenylbutazone, etc. Moreover, new anti-inflammatory drugs are being discovered and developed based on their effects on signal transduction and as anti-cytokine agents [37] . Some pyridine derivates, such as pyroxin and sulfasalazine, have been known for their anti-inflammatory effects. As a member of the pyridinethione compound family, PTS2 has been used as bactericide, pesticide and fungicide for a long time [38] . However, relatively fewer studies have focused on the anti-inflammatory activity and the mechanisms of PTS2.",

Activated T lymphocytes and NK cells produce IFN-c which is the major macrophage activation factor. Activation of JAK1, JAK2 and STAT1, plays a central role in the primary transcriptional response to IFN-c [2, 28] . It has been well documented that excess IFN-c release could result in IP-10/ CXCL10 overexpression, which regulates almost all stages in the development of inflammation, in particular, the early stage of T cells and NK cells transmigration to the sites of inflammation [2] . Some medicines, such as glucocorticoids, which reduce the incidence of the inflammatory disease process, show inhibitory effects on IP-10/CXCL10 expression, and some chemicals with efficiency of inhibiting IP-10/CXCL10 overexpression are also considered to have the immense potential for treating a broad range of and inflammatory diseases including SARS, chronic hepatitis C, SLE, etc. [20, 39, 40] .",

Sakaeda et al. [41] showed that IFN-c-stimulated IP-10/CXCL10 expression in RAW264.7 cells. In the current study, we demonstrated that IFN-c-induced up-regulation of IP-10/ CXCL10 in RAW264.7 cells was dose and Fig. 5 Effect of PTS2 on IFN-c-induced p38 activation. RAW264.7 cells were pretreated with 5.0 lM PTS2 for 2 h or not, followed by incubating with 10 ng/ml IFN-c for 0-1.5 h. Western blot was performed by using antibodies to p38 or p-p38. GAPDH was used as control. The results were representative of three independent experiments time-dependently inhibited by PTS2. Although IFN-c induces a rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK1 and JAK2 and activation of STAT1 in RAW264.7 cells, when treating cells with IFN-c in the presence of PTS2, JAK/ STAT1 activation was depressed. Moreover, we found that the inhibitory effect of PTS2 on IP-10/CXCL10 up-regulation was slightly stronger than JAK2 inhibitor AG490 while RAW264.7 cells co-incubated with PTS2 and AG490 showed marked reduction of IP-10/CXCL10, suggesting the synergistic effect of PTS2 and AG490. These results indicate that PTS2 inhibits IFN-c-induced IP-10/ CXCL10 expression through preventing activation of the JAK/STAT1 signaling pathway. A similar result revealed in our recent report indicates that PTS2 inhibits the LPSinduced iNOS expression by depressing phosphorylation of STAT1 in RAW264.7 cells [34] . It has been demonstrated that activation of p38 appears to play a critical role in regulation of the expression of a number of chemokines and cytokines induced by IFN-c in macrophages [31] , but in the present study, PTS2 did not alter IFN-c-induced p38 phosphorylation. Majumder et al. [42] showed that the induction of IP-10/CXCL10 was dependent on the ISRE (interferon-stimulated response element) and one of the two NF-jB recognition sites. We also tried to study the effect of PTS2 on NF-jB signaling, however, we did not find NF-jB activation by IFN-c stimulation through detecting ubiquitination of IjBa and IjBb in RAW264.7 cells (data not shown). The result is consistent with the results that NF-jB can regulate IP-10/CXCL10 expression but IFN-c did not detectably activate NF-jB in both Myd88 -/and wild-type macrophages [43] . In addition, our work also indicates that PTS2 has no significant effect on cell viability (data not shown).",
