            "text": "The Coronavirus disease -19 (COVID19) that started in Wuhan, China in December 2019 has spread worldwide emerging as a global pandemic. The severe respiratory pneumonia caused by the novel SARS-CoV-2 has so far claimed more than 14,500 lives and has impacted human lives worldwide. Development of universal vaccines against the novel SARS-CoV-2 holds utmost urgency to control COVID19 pandemic that appears to be more severe than any of the previous outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle-East respiratory syndrome (MERS). However, as the novel SARS-CoV-2 displays high transmission rates, the underlying severity hidden in the SARS-CoV2 genomes is required to be fully understood. We studied the complete genomes of 95 strains of SARS-CoV-2 reported from different geographical regions worldwide to uncover the pattern of spread of the novel SARS-CoV-2 across the globe. We show that there is no direct transmission pattern of the virus among neighbouring countries suggesting that the outbreak is a result of travel of infected humans to different countries. We revealed unique single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in nsp13, nsp14, nsp15, nsp16 (present in ORF1b polyprotein region) and S-Protein within 10 viral isolates from USA. These viral proteins are involved in RNA replication and processing, indicating highly evolved strains of the novel SARS-CoV-2 circulating in the population of USA than in other countries. Furthermore, we found an isolate from USA (MT188341) to carry frameshift mutation between positions 2540 and 2570 of nsp16 which functions as mRNA cap-1 methyltransferase (2\u2032-O-MTase). Thus, we reason that the replicative machinery of the novel SARS-CoV-2 is fast evolving to evade host challenges and survival. These mutations are needed to be considered, otherwise it will be difficult to develop effective treatment strategies.",

Bats are known to host coronaviruses acting as their natural reservoirs which may be transmitted to humans through an intermediate host. SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV were transmitted from intermediate hosts, palm civets and camel, respectively (Lau et al., 2005; Mayer et al., 2014). It is not, however, yet clear which animal served as the intermediate host for transmission of SARS-CoV-2 transmission from bats to humans which is most likely suggested to be a warm-blooded vertebrate (Zhang et al., 2020). The inherently high recombination frequency and mutation rates of coronavirus genomes allows for their easy transmission from different intermediate hosts. Structurally, they are positive-sense single stranded RNA (ssRNA) virions with characteristic spikes projecting from the surface of capsid coating (Newman et al., 2006,",

The phylogenetic clustering was found majorly concordant by both core-genome (Figure 1A) and SNP based methods (Figure 2B). The strains formed a monophyletic clade, in which MT093571.1 (South Korea) and MT039890.1 (Sweden) were most diverged. Focusing on the edge-connection between the neighbouring countries from where the transmission is more likely to occur, we noted a strain from Taiwan (MT066176) closely clustered with another from China (MT121215.1). With exception to these two strains, we did not find any connection between strains of neighbouring countries. Thus, most strains belonging to the same country clustered distantly from each other and showed relatedness with strains isolated from distant geographical locations(Figure 2A & B). For instance, a SARS-CoV-2 strain isolated from Nepal (MT072688) clustered with a strain from USA (MT039888). Also, strains from Wuhan (LR757998 and LR757995), where the virus was originated, showed highest identity with USA as well as China strains; strains from India, MT012098 and MT050493 clustered closely with China and USA strains, respectively(Figure 2A & B). Similarly, Australian strain (MT007544) showed close clustering with USA strain(Figure 2A & B)and one strain from Taiwan (MT066175) clustered nearly with China strain (Figure 2B). Isolates from Italy (MT012098) and Brazil (MT126808) clustered with different USA strains(Figure 2A & B). Notably, isolates from same country or geographical location formed a mosaic pattern of phylogenetic placements of countries' isolates. For viral transmission, contact between the individuals is also an important factor, supposedly due to which the spread of identical strains across the border of neighbouring countries is more likely. But we obtained a pattern where Indian strains showed highest similarity with USA and China strains, Australian strains with USA strains, Italy and Brazil strains with USA strains among others. This depicts the viral spread across different communities. However, as genomes of SARS-CoV-2 were available mostly from USA and China, sampling biasness is evident in analysed dataset as available on NCBI. Thus,",

All the mutated proteins are non-structural proteins (NSP) functionally involved in forming viral replication-transcription complexes (RTC) (Snijder et al., 2016). For instance, non-structural protein 13 (nsp13), belongs to helicase superfamily 1 and is putatively involved in viral RNA replication through RNA-DNA duplex unwinding (Jang et al., 2020) whereas nsp14 and nsp15 are exoribonuclease and endoribonuclease, respectively (Becares et al., 2016; Athmer et al., 2017). nsp16 functions as a mRNA cap-1 methyltransferase (von Grotthuss et al., 2003). All these proteins containing SNPs at several positions (Table 2) indicate that viral machinery for its RNA replication and processing is utmost evolved in strains from USA as compared to the other countries. Further we analysed the SNPs at protein level and interestingly in ORF1b protein, there were amino acid substitutions at P1327L, Y1364C and S2540F in USA isolates. One isolate namely USA0/MN1-MDH1/2020 (MT188341) carried frameshift mutation between positions 2540 and 2570 (Figure 3), which might affect the functioning of nsp16 (2\u2032-O-MTase). As the proteins involved in viral replication are evolving rapidly, this highlights the need to consider these mutants in order to develop the treatment strategies. Direction of selection Our analysis revealed that ORF8 (121 a.a.) (dN/dS= 35.8) along with ORF3a (275 bp) (dN/dS= 8.95) showed highest dN/dS values among the nine ORFs thus, have much greater number of non-synonymous substitutions than the synonymous substitution (Figure 4D). Values of dN/dS >>1 are indicative of strong divergent lineage (Kryazhimskiy et. al., 2008). Thus, both of these proteins are evolving under high selection pressure and are highly divergent ORFs across strains. Two other proteins, ORF1ab polyprotein (dN/dS= 0.996, 0.575) and S protein (dN/dS= 0.88) might confer selective advantage with host challenges and survival. The dN/dS rates nearly 1 and greater than 1 suggests that the strains are coping up with the challenges i.e., immune responses and inhibitory environment of host cells (Pond et al., 2005). The other gene clusters namely M-protein and orf1a polyprotein did not possess at least three unique sequences necessary for the analysis, hence, should be similar across the strains. The two genes ORF1ab polyprotein encodes for protein translation and post translation modification found to be evolved which actively translates, enhance the multiplication and facilitates growth of virus inside the host. Similarly, the S protein which helps in the entry of virus to the host cells by surpassing the cell membrane found to be accelerated towards positive selection confirming the successful ability of enzyme to initiate the infection. Another positive diversifying gene N protein encodes for nucleocapsid formation which protects the genetic material of virus form host immune responses such as cellular proteases. Overall, the data represent that the growth and multiplication related genes are highly evolving. The other proteins with dN/dS values equal to zero suggesting a conserved repertoire of genes.",

            "text": "Detailed analysis of interactome highlighted 9 host proteins in direct association with 6 viral proteins. Further, the network was analysed for identification of regulatory hubs based on degree analysis. We identified Mitogen activated protein kinase 1 (MAPK1) and AKT proteins as major hubs forming 24 and 21 interactions in the network respectively, highlighting their crucial role in pathogenesis. Recently, Huang et al, demonstrated the role of Mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) in COVID-19 mediated blood immune responses in infected patients (Huang et al., 2020) and showed that MAPK activation certainly plays a major defence mechanism. Gene Ontology based functional annotation studies predicted the role of direct interactions of several viral proteins with host proteins. One such protein is non-structural protein2 (nsp2) which directly interacts with host Prohbitin (PHB), a known regulator of cell proliferation and maintains functional integrity of mitochondria (Tatsuta et al., 2005). SARS-CoV nsp2 is also known for its interaction with host PHB1 and PHB2 (Cromwell T et al., 2009). Nsp2 is a methyltransferase like domain which is known to mediate mRNA cap 2'-O-ribose methylation to the 5'-cap structure of viral mRNAs. This N7-methylguanosine cap is required for the action of nsp16 (2'-O-methyltransferase) and nsp10 complex (Chen et al., 2011). This 5'-capping of viral RNA plays a crucial role in escape of virus from innate immunity recognition (Chen et al., 2011). Hence, nsp2 -is responsible for modulating host cell survival strategies by altering host cell environment (Cromwell et al., 2009). Based on network predicted we propose nsp16/nsp10 interface as a better drug target for anti-coronavirus drugs corresponding to the prediction made by Cormwell and group (2011).Similarly, the viral protein Papain-like proteinase (PL-PRO) which has deubiquitinase and deISGylating activity is responsible for cleaving viral polyprotein into 3 mature proteins which are essential for viral replication. Our study showed that PL-PRO directly interacts with PPP1CA which is a protein phosphatase that associates with over 200 regulatory host proteins to form highly specific holoenzymes. PL-PRO is also found to interact with TGF\u03b2 which is a beta transforming growth factor and promotes T-helper 17 cells (Th17) and regulatory T-cells(Treg) differentiation (Zhang et al., 2007). Reports have shown the PL-PRO induced upregulation of TGF\u03b2 in human promonocytes via MAPK pathway result in pro-fibrotic responses (Li et al., 2016). This reflect that viral PL-PRO antagonises innate immune system and is directly involved in the pathogenicity of SARS-CoV 2 induced pulmonary fibrosis (tu sing fung, 2019; Li et al., 2016). Many COVID-19 patients develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ADRS) which leads to pulmonary edema and lung failure (Xu Z et al., 2020, Huang et al., 2019). These symptoms are because of cytokine storm manifesting elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines like IL6, IFN\u03b3, IL17, IL1\u03b2 etc(Huang et al., 2019). These results are in agreement with our prediction where we found IL6 as an interacting partner. Our study also showed JAK1/2 as an interacting partner which is known for IFN\u03b3 signalling. It is well known that TGF\u03b2 along with IL6 and STAT3 promotes Th17 differentiation by inhibiting SOCS3. Th17 is a source of IL17, which is commonly found in serum samples of COVID19 patients. Hence, our interactome is supported from these findings where we found SOCS3, STAT3, JAK1/2 as an interacting partner. The results suggested that proinflammatory cytokine storm is one of the reasons for SARS-CoV -2 mediated immune-pathogenicity.In next cycle of physical events the viral protein NC (nucleoprotein), which is a major structural part of SARV family associates with the genomic RNA to form a flexible, helical nucleocapsid. Interaction of this protein with SMAD3 leads to inhibition of apoptosis of SARS-CoV infected lung cells(Zhao et al, 2008), which is a successful strategy of immune evasion by virus. More complex and multiple associations of ORF7a viral protein which is a nonstructural protein and known as growth factor for SARS family viruses, directly captures BCL2L1 which is a potent regulator of apoptosis.Tan et al (2007) have shown that SARS-CoV ORF7a protein induces apoptosis by interacting with Bcl XL protein which is a responsible for lymphopenia, an abnormality found in SARS-CoV infected patients(Tan et al., 2007).Another target of viral ORF7a protein is SGTA (Small glutamine-rich tetratricopeptide repeat) which is an ATPase regulator and promotes viral encapsulation(Fielding 2006). Subordinate viral proteins M (Membrane), S (Glycoprotein) and ORF3a (viroporin) were found to interact with each other. This interaction is important for viral cell formation and budding(de Haan et al., 1999, Klumperman et al., 1994. Studies have shown the localization of ORF3a protein in Golgi apparatus of SARS-CoV infected patients along with M protein and responsible for viral budding and cell injury(Yuan et al., 2005). ORF3a protein also targets the functioning of CAV1 (Caveolin 1), caveolae protein, act as a scaffolding protein within caveolar membranes.CAV1 have been reported to be involved in viral replication, persistence, and the potential role in pathogenesis in HIV infection also (Mergia, 2017). Thus, ORF3a interaction will upregulate viral replication thus playing very crucial role in pathogenesis. Multiple methyltransferase assembly viral proteins (nsp7, nsp8, nsp9, RdRp) which are nuclear structural proteins were observed to target the SPECC1 proteins and linked with cytokinesis and spindle formations",

With the limited data so far available we observed no direct transmission pattern of the novel SARS-CoV-2 in the neighbouring countries through our analyses of the phylogenomic relatedness of geographical isolates. The isolates from same locations were distant phylogenetically, for instance, isolates from USA and China. Thus, there appears to be a mosaic pattern of transmission indicative of the result of infected human travel across different countries. As COVID19 transited from epidemic to pandemic within a short time, it does not look surprising from the genome structures of the viral isolates. The genomes of six isolates, specifically from USA, were found to harbour unique amino acid SNPs and showed amino acid substitutions in ORF1b protein and S-protein, while one of them also harboured a frameshift mutation. This is suggestive of the severity of the mutating viral genomes within the population of USA. These proteins are directly involved in formation of viral replication-transcription complexes (RTC)",

            "text": "). N-protein, the fourth protein, helps in packaging of virus particles into capsids and promotes replicase-transcriptase complex (RTC) (McBride et al., 2014). Recently, in December 2019, the outbreak of novel beta-coronavirus (2019-nCoV) or SARS-Virtually all human lives have been impacted with no foreseeable end of the pandemic. A recent study on ten novel coronavirus strains by Lu et al., suggested that SARS-CoV-2 is sufficiently diverged from SARS-CoV (Lu et al., 2020). SARS-CoV-2 is assumed to have originated from bats, which serve as reservoir host of the virus (Lu et al., 2020). Other studies have also reported the genome composition and divergence patterns of SARS-CoV-2 (Sah et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2020). However, no study has yet explained the biogeographical pattern of this emerging pathogen. In this study, we selected 95 strains of SARS-CoV-2, isolated from 11 different countries to understand the transmission patterns, evolution and pathogenesis of the virus. Using core genome and Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) based phylogeny, we attempted to uncover any existence of a transmission pattern of the virus across the affected countries, which was not known earlier. We analysed the ORFs of the isolates to reveal unique point and frameshift mutations in the isolates from the USA. In addition, we analysed the gene/protein mutations in these novel strains and estimated the direction of selection to decipher their evolutionary divergence rate. Further, we also established the interactome of SARS-CoV-2 with the human host proteins to predict functional implications of the viral infection host cells. The results obtained from the analyses indicate high severity of SARS-CoV-2 isolates with inherent capability of unique mutations and the evolving viral replication strategies to adapt to human hosts.",
