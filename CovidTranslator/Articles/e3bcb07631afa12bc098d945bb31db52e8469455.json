Glycyrrhizic acid (GA) is considered the principal component in Glycyrrhiza spp. with a wide spectrum of antiviral activity. Aim: The present study attempt to validate the medicinal use of Glycyrrhiza uralensis for hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) and further to verify whether GA is an active antiviral component in the water extract of Glycyrrhiza uralensis. Materials and methods: Radices of Glycyrrhiza uralensis Fisch. were extracted with hot water. The chemical contents of the extract were profiled with HPLC analysis. The antiviral activity of the extract and the major components was evaluated against infection of enterovirus 71 (EV71) and coxsackievirus A16 (CVA16) on Vero cells. The cytopathic effect caused by the infection was measured with MTT assay. Infectious virion production was determined using secondary infection assays and viral protein expression by immunoblotting analysis.",

In contrast, the acid precipitant retained antiviral activity. The precipitant at a concentration of 200 mg/ml inhibited EV71 and CVA16 replication by 1.7 and 2.2 logs, respectively. Furthermore, GA dose-dependently blocked viral replication of EV71 and CVA16. At 3 mM, GA reduced infectious CVA16 and EV71 production by 3.5 and 2.2 logs, respectively. At 5 mM, CVA16 production was reduced by 6.0 logs and EV71 by 4.0 logs. Both EV71 and CVA16 are members of Enterovirus genus, time-of-drug addition studies however showed that GA directly inactivated CVA16, while GA anti-EV71 effect was associated with an event(s) post virus cell entry. Conclusions: This study validated the medicinal usefulness of radices Glycyrrhiza uralensis against the etiological agents of HFMD. In addition to the identification of GA as the antiviral component of Glycyrrhiza uralensis against EV71 and CVA16 infection, this study also reveals that GA inhibits EV71 and CVA16 with distinct mechanisms.",

            "text": "Hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) is a common viral illness that usually affects infants and young children of 5 years old or younger. The clinical features of HFMD typically begin with mild fever, sore throat, poor appetite, and diarrhea. A day or two later, blisters form in the mouth and a rash develops on the cheeks, gums, and the tongue, potentially with life-threatening neurological complications, such as encephalitis. The causative agents of HFMD have been identified as coxsackievirus A16 (CVA16) and enterovirus 71 (EV71) viruses, accounting for more than 70% of the cases during the 2008 outbreak in China (WHO, 2008) . CVA16 and EV71 are single strand RNA viruses of the Enterovirus genus. The viruses can be spread through direct contact with blisters and other surfaces contaminated with virus-containing fluids or through fecal-oral route. HFMD occurs sporadically around the world since its first report in 1957. Large outbreaks of HFMD with higher morbidity and mortality have become common in the Asia Pacific region. An outbreak in 2008 affected nearly half million children with 126 deaths in eastern China (Yang et al., 2009) . Data reported to the Ministry of Public Health of China showed that more than one million cases annually and hundreds of deaths associated with HFMD in China for the past 3 years (www.moh.gov.cn). There is no vaccine or specific antiviral drugs available for HFMD. Good hygiene, including hand washing and disinfection of surfaces in child care facilities, therefore remains as the most effective approach to reduce the transmission rate of HFMD (Solomon et al., 2010; Ma et al., 2011) .",

GA at millimolar concentrations inhibits growth and cytopathology of several unrelated viruses, while not affecting cell activity and ability to replicate (Pompei et al., 1979) . Subsequent studies have shown the antiviral activity of GA against several enveloped viruses, including HIV, and SARS related coronavirus (Cinatl et al., 2003; Hoever et al., 2005) , Kaposi's Sarcoma-Associated herpesvirus (Curreli et al., 2005; Kang and Lieberman, 2011) , hepatitis C virus (Ashfaq et al., 2011) , respiratory syncytial virus, vaccinia virus, Epstein-Barr virus, and vesicular stomatitis virus (Fiore et al., 2005 (Fiore et al., , 2008 Pompei et al., 2009) . The compound has not previously been reported to inhibit the infection by nonenveloped viruses.",

Plants in the genus contain triterpenoid saponins such as glycyrrhizic acid, dihydroflavonoids like liquiritin, and polysaccharides (Asl and Hosseinzadeh, 2008) , with GA as the principal component for antiviral activities. GA has three carboxylic acid groups and can be selectively precipitated by acidification of an aqueous solution. To preliminarily determine whether GA was responsible for Glycyrrhiza uralensis antiviral activity, we precipitate GA from water extract of Glycyrrhiza uralensis with H 2 SO 4 and detected the antiviral activity of precipitant and supernatant. Consistent with GA as an antiviral component, depletion of GA by acid precipitation obviated the antiviral activity of the extract (Fig. 3A and B) .

Kuo et al. (2009) have recently reported that a water extract of radices of Glycyrrhiza uralensis Fisch. possessed strong antiviral activity against EV71 infection. The IC 50 value was determined at 0.056 mg/ml. However, the components with such potent antiviral activity remain uncharacterized. In this study, we only detected moderate antiviral activity of the extract against EV71 and CVA16 infection. And we further demonstrated that GA contributed to the antiviral activity in Glycyrrhiza uralensis. In addition, GA is a signature component of Glycyrrhiza spp. and Chinese Pharmacopeia specifies its minimal content as 2.0%. It has been reported that GA contents in Glycyrrhiza uralensis Fisch. from different cultivated areas varied significantly (Gu et al., 2002) . Consistent with this report, we found the contents of GA of five samples purchased from local market varied dramatically (data not shown). Therefore, we speculated that different GA contents and the cell lines may contribute to the discrepancy of reported activities of Glycyrrhiza spp. compared with our studies.",

This report represents the first case of GA antiviral activity against nonenveloped viruses. A time-of-drug addition study revealed that GA inhibits CVA16 and EV71 infections through different mechanisms. The compound directly inactivates CVA16, while it inhibits EV71 infection apparently through an event post cell entry of the virus. Glycyrrhizic acid exhibits antiviral activity with multiple mechanisms, including direct deactivation of HSV-1 (Pompei et al., 1979) , reduction of host cell membrane fluidity (Harada, 2005) , inhibition of fusion of enveloped viruses (Wolkerstorfer et al., 2009) , impairment of hepatitis B virus surface antigen transport (Sato et al., 1996) , or disruption of RNA polymerase II pausing, resulting in loss of proper mRNA production and defects in sister chromatid cohesion (Kang and Lieberman, 2011) .
