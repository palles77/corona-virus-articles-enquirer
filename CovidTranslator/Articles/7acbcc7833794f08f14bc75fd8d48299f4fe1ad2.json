It seems probable, because of the very large number of coronavirus particles seen in 1 patient, that they were the cause of this outbreak, although this relationship cannot be proved at this stage. Similar particles have not been seen on examination of faeces from other patients with diarrhoea. Further work with this virus is in progress. SIR The clinical significance of the hepatitis-B surface antigen (HBsAg) subtypes D and Y in HBsAg positive liver diseases is still unknown. Different subtype distribution in patients with acute and chronic liver diseases and healthy carriers has been demonstrated by several authors, and it was concluded that the HBsAg subtypes D and Y are of clinical significance. If the clinical course of an HBsAg-positive acute viral hepatitis is determined by the HBsAg subtype, clinical differences in the two forms of hepatitis B should be expected.",
