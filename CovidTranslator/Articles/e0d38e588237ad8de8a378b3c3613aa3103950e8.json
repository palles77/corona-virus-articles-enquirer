            "text": "As PVL-positive S. aureus pneumonia is rare in the general adult population, especially in most Western European countries, this aetiology is often considered with delay by physicians. Our case shares many of the features of community-acquired PVL-positive S. aureus pneumonia described in previous studies. Indeed, this form of pneumonia affects preferentially young immunocompetent healthy individuals. Haemoptysis, a common finding associated to acute respiratory distress syndrome, is frequent and previously described as a predictive factor of fatal outcome. 9 Regarding biological data, leucopenia and thrombopenia were frequently observed at the initial stage of disease. Here, a white cell count at 1.95\u00d710 9 /L was observed whereas previous study had demonstrated that a severe leucopoenia is another predictive factor of fatal outcome with a mortality rate of 75% associated with white cell count <3000/mL. 10 In the case presented here, we have not found the origin of the PVL-positive S. aureus strain responsible for community-acquired pneumonia. We were not able to find a healthy carrier of the S. aureus strain in the environment of the patient. As the patient had not returned to work at the time of hospitalisation, the origin of the PVL-positive S. aureus strain seems community-acquired. Indeed, the carriage of the same PVL-positive S. aureus strain among the relatives of the patient with necrotising pneumonia has been described in the literature. 8 Recently, the carriage of PVL-positive S. aureus strains has been described either in a population of adults and in a population of preschool children. 11 12 The S. aureus strain was associated with the ST 152, infrequently found in Europe. 5 The PVL-positive S. aureus colonisation of populations may play a key role in the epidemiology of community-associated infection by PVL-positive S. aureus.",
