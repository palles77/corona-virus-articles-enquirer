Fecal examination showed that 14.19% of the examined calves were positive for Cryptosporidium spp. Calves at 1-15 days were at the highest risk (P<0.001), and a significant relationship between season and infection (P<0.05) was recorded. A significant association between infection and hygiene (P<0.001), type of floor (P< 0.01) and source of water (P < 0.01) was also recorded. Statistical analysis concerning the clinical signs and fecal characteristics revealed a significant association with fecal consistency (P<0.001), presence of blood (P< 0.01) and mucous (P<0.01).",

However, cryptosporidiosis should not only be considered from the perspective of animal health and production; its zoonotic character and the possibility that animals may act as a source of infection to humans, via foodstuff and water, should also be considered. Although the infection leads to few deaths, serious economic losses can occur due to costs involved in the treatment (de Graaf et al. 1999) .",

However, halofuginone lactate was found to have anticryptosporidial effect (Jarvie et al. 2005; Klein 2007 ). Furthermore, Cryptosporidium oocysts are resistant to the commonly used disinfectant at recommended concentrations (Campbell et al. 1982) . It is necessary to find management approaches to minimize the risk of infection with cryptosporidiosis. Cryptosporidiosis in water buffaloes (Bubalus bubalis) received great interest in different localities of the world (Galiero et al. 1994; Dubey et al. 1992; Rinaldi et al. 2007) . In Egypt, studies limited to the prevalence and zoonotic aspects of the disease were done (Iskander et al. 1987; El-Sherif et al. 2000; El-Dessouky and El-Masry 2005; El-Sherbini and Mohammad 2006) . The prevalence of cryptosporidiosis was also mentioned in African buffaloes (Syncerus caffer) among wildlife animals in Tanzania (Mtambo et al. 1997) . However, the risk factors concerned with cryptosporidiosis in buffalo calves have not been described. Consequently, the objective of the present study was to determine the prevalence and determinants (risk factors) of cryptosporidiosis in buffalo calves in Middle Egypt.",

Hosmer and Lemeshow's goodness of fit statistic test greater than 0.05 was used to imply that the model's estimates fit the data at an acceptable level in multivariate analysis. The results were each expressed as P value and odds ratio (OR) with a 95% confidence interval (CI 95%). A chi-square (\u03c7 2 ) analysis test was used to study the possible association between the infection and the variables of clinical findings and fecal characters.

Overall results showed that diarrheic calves had higher rate of infection (17.72%) than nondiarrheic ones (7.54%). There was a significant association (P<0.01) between Cryptosporidium infection and the presence of mucus in the feces; 36 (55.38%) of the infected calves had mucus in their feces. Also, there was a relationship between the presence of Cryptosporidium oocysts and the existence of blood in the feces (P<0.01), 63.07% of the infected calves had blood in their feces, versus 36.93% calves. Moreover, there was significant association between the severity of infection and presence of blood, mucous or both in the feces (\u03c7 2 , P=0.002; linear trend test, P=0.001), thus 21 cases of severely infected calves had combined mucous and blood versus five of mild infection and 10 of moderate infection. There was a significant association between the severity of infection and the fecal consistency (P<0.001; linear trend test, P<0.001). Thus, 91.30% of severely infected calves has watery diarrhea and 100% of moderately infected cases had soft pasty feces, and only 12 mildly infected calves with normal feces shed oocysts. No significant association was recorded between cryptosporidium infection and presence of fever and dehydration (P= 0.275 and P=0.410, respectively); however, significant association was recorded between infection and the desire for suckling (P<0.05). Thus, 34 (52.30%) of infected calves stopped suckling compared with 31 (47.69%) had normal suckling. Furthermore, a significant association between the infection and tenesmus ",

In the present study, all of the calves were not separated from their mothers directly after birth and had taken their colostrums directly from their dams. It is suggested that natural feeding and delayed separation could played a role in the low prevalence compared with bovine calves. Quigley et al. (1994) and Mohammed et al.

A significant association between the season and the prevalence of Cryptosporidium spp. infection was recorded in this study. Winter recorded the highest prevalence (49.22%), while summer recorded the lowest (9.23%). It is suggested that the prevalence of infection by Cryptosporidium spp. is not only related to the presence of calves at risk but also related to the presence of the suitable climatic condition for viability and spread of the parasite. In winter, the temperature in our locality is suitable for viability and survival of Cryptosporidium oocysts. Similar findings were recorded by Tzipori (1983) and Lefay et al. (2000) . These results were supported by Anderson (1986) who found that warm temperature of 18 to 29\u00b0C, had been partially responsible for loss of the infectivity. However, Garber et al. (1994) attributed the high prevalence of cryptosporidiosis in winter to presence of large number of calves at risk a result of concentration of calving in winter months. On contrary, in California, Atwill et al. (1999) found that calves were at high risk of contracting infection by Cryptosporidium spp. during May month and they attributed this to the greatest contact with the source of infection, lowering animal resistance or environmental conditions that might favor transmission of the infection during this month. Contrary to all recorded results, absence of seasonality in the presence of Cryptosporidium infection has been described (Wade et al. 2000; Castro-Hermida et al. 2002) . It was suggested that seasonal effects can only be correctly evaluated when the study is repeated over several consecutive years (Castro-Hermida et al. 2002) .",

In houses with cement floor there was no efficient cleaning or using of disinfectants, which could help to retain dirties and moisture. Furthermore, mixing of the animals with each other may help in contraction and spread of infection. On contrary, Castro-Hermida et al. (2002) found that cement floor had lower risk than straw/ earth floor due to daily cleaning using water with pressure hose. The use of straw and deep litter seemed to confer protection against Cryptosporidium infection or at least excretion (Maddox-Hyttel et al. 2006) . They attributed this finding to the microclimatic factors governing oocyst survival. It was also found that calves in herds with cleaning daily had low tendency to have infection than that cleaned weekly (P<0.001). In bovine calves, a similar finding was also recorded by Castro-Hermida et al. (2002) .

Other secondary signs such as tensmus and decreased desire for suckling were recorded. The infection rate in diarrheic calves was 17.72%, whereas in non-diarrheic calves was 7.54%. This result came in accordance with that carried out in cattle by Atwill et al. (1999) and Castro-Hermida et al. (2002) . Coexistence of C. parvum, rotavirus, coronavirus and Salmonella, among others, in calves of less than one month of age, with diarrhea was recorded (de la Fuente et al. 1999 ). Blood, mucous were found to be associated with Cryptosporidium spp. infections. On contrary, infection was found not associated with bloody diarrhea due to the very superficial location of the parasite (Heine et al. 1984; Aurich et al. 1990; Blewett and Angus 1994) .",

However, C. bovis was found also to infect cattle calves and could not be differentiated by the traditional methods (Sant\u00edn et al. 2004) . C. parvum was only found to be predominant in unweaned calves, whereas C. bovis was detected in weaned cattle calves (Sant\u00edn et al. 2004; Fayer et al. 2005; Starkey et al. 2006) . C. andersoni infects the abomasums of juvenile and mature cattle and this infection has been identified as a cause of reduced milk production. Moreover, in a study, G\u00f3mez-Couso et al. (2005) has been identified a Cryptosporidium spp. from buffalo heifers without diarrhea using the molecular characterization. In conclusion, similar to cattle calves, the results of the present investigation demonstrate the relation between Cryptosporidium infection and the occurrence of diarrhea in buffalo calves. Further molecular biological study needs to be done to recognize the Cryptosporidium spp. specific to the buffalo calves in Egypt.",
