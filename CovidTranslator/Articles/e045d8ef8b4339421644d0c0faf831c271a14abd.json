Colostral growth factors and hormones have beneficial effects on postnatal maturation and may affect substrate utilization and energy expenditure in neonatal calves. We tested the hypothesis that energy metabolism and its endocrine regulation differ during the first 10 d of life in calves fed either colostrum or a milk-based formula with a similar nutrient composition to colostrum, but largely depleted of bioactive substances, for the first 2 d postnatum. Male Holstein calves (n = 18) were fed either pooled colostrum (COL; n = 9) or a milk-based formula (FOR; n = 9) for the first 2 d of life. From d 3 on, all calves received same milk replacer. On d 2 and 7 of life, calves were placed in a respiration chamber for indirect calorimetric measurements to calculate heat production, fat (FOX) and carbohydrate oxidation (COX), as well as respiratory quotient. Blood was sampled on d 1 before first colostrum intake and on d 2, 3, 7, 8, 9, and 10 before morning feeding, to measure plasma concentrations of immunoglobulins, metabolites, and hormones. Additional postprandial blood samples were taken on d 1 and 9 at 30, 60, 120, 240, and 420 min after milk feeding. Liver samples were collected on d 10 of life to determine gene expression related to energy metabolism. Formula-fed calves showed lower plasma concentrations of total protein, immunoglobulins, haptoglobin, leptin, adiponectin, and insulin-like growth factor (IGF) binding protein (IGFBP)-4 during the whole study but temporarily higher plasma concentrations of urea, insulin, glucagon, triglyceride, and cholesterol on the first day after feeding, compared with concentrations in COL. The temporary increase in glucagon, triglyceride, and cholesterol on d 1 reversed on d 2 or 3, showing higher concentrations in COL than in FOR calves. In FOR, IGF-I, IGFBP-2, and IGFBP-3 were lower on d 3 than in COL. Interestingly, FOR calves had higher heat production during respiratory measurements on d 2 and higher body temperature on d 2, 3, and 5 than those of COL. The hepatic mRNA abundance of cytosolic phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase was higher in FOR than in COL. Our results indicate that first milk feeding after birth influenced whole-body energy expenditure but not FOX and COX in neonatal calves, and the absorption of colostral leptin and adiponectin might affect insulin sensitivity on d 1 of life.",

In addition to its high content of nutrients and immunoglobulins, bovine colostrum contains high amounts of non-nutritive, biologically active substances, such as hormones and growth factors Blum and Baumrucker, 2008; Nissen et al., 2017) , which may have local and systemic effects on postnatal maturation in neonatal calves (Blum, 2006; Hammon et al., 2012; Ontsouka et al., 2016) . Colostrum intake immediately after birth has a great effect on the intestinal development of the neonatal calf and supports nutrient absorption by the intestine (Roffler et al., 2003; Blum, 2006; Hammon et al., 2012) . Glucose supply is clearly improved in colostrum-fed calves compared with calves fed a formula with the same lactose content as colostrum but much lower amounts of biologically active factors (Steinhoff-Wagner et al., 2011; Gruse et al., 2015) . Colostrum intake affects the neonatal metabolome, indicating large systemic effects on neonatal metabolism after first colostrum intake (Hammon et al., 2012; Qi et al., 2018; Zhao et al., 2018) . Furthermore, thermoregulatory mechanisms, including the metabolism of brown adipose tissue, shivering, and physical activity, are important for adaptation to new environmental conditions after birth, and colostrum intake stimulates heat production in neonatal calves (Vermorel et al., 1983) . However, less is known about the effects of first colostrum feeding on whole-body nutrient utilization during the first week of life in neonatal calves and whether long-lasting effects on carbohydrate (COX) and fat oxidation (FOX) occur due to colostrum feeding.",

Previous studies indicate that the interaction of numerous growth-enhancing factors in the first colostrum stimulates intestinal maturation and protein synthesis in several tissues of the neonate (Reeds et al., 2000; Roffler et al., 2003) . On the other hand, the systemic effects of colostral IGF-I or insulin were denied because studies could not detect a significant intestinal absorption of colostral IGF-I or insulin in neonatal calves (Gr\u00fctter and Blum, 1991; Vacher et al., 1995; Sparks et al., 2003) or piglets (Donovan et al., 1997) . However, recent studies in neonatal calves indicated systemic availability of colostral adiponectin (Kesser et al., 2015) . The effect of colostral adiponectin on metabolic development in neonatal calves is not yet clear, but adiponectin may influence neonatal energy metabolism by affecting insulin action (Havel, 2002; Yamauchi and Kadowaki, 2013) . In addition, lactocrine maternal programming of neonatal reproductive tract development has been discussed in piglets (Bagnell and Bartol, 2019) .",

All calves were born during night or in the morning (from 0200 h up to 1200 h). Calves received their first colostrum or formula within 2 h after birth through a nipple attached to a bottle. Second feeding was 10 h later. From d 2 of age, colostrum or formula and MR were fed at 0700 h and 1700 h. During the first 2 d of life, refused liquid feed was tube-fed to attain the desired feed intake. The study lasted either 10 (11 calves: 6 COL and 5 FOR) or 11 d (7 calves; 3 COL and 4 FOR). In 11-d cases, calves were fed 1 additional day with MR before conducting final investigations. Mean age in COL calves was (mean \u00b1 SE) 9.52 \u00b1 0.17 d; mean age in FOR calves was 9.31 \u00b1 0.17 d. During the entire trial, animals had free access to chopped hay and water. Navels were disinfected with 10% povidone iodine solution (Vet-Sept; aniMedica, Senden-B\u00f6sensell, Germany). Calves received an oral dose of 1 g of iron dextran with their first meal on d 1 (Ursoferran; Serumwerk Bernburg, Bernburg, Germany). To support immunological defense during the first 5 d of life in formula-fed calves but avoid differences in medical care between groups, all calves received chicken egg-derived immunoglobulins with the morning feeding (0.25 g/kg of BW; Globigen Life Start 25%, EW Nutrition, Visbek, Germany). To prevent cryptosporidiosis, calves were treated orally with halofuginone (0.1 mg/ kg of BW; Halocur, Intervet, Igoville, France) after the evening feeding from d 1 to 7. All calves received subcutaneous injections of B-vitamins (100 mg nicotinamide/calf, 40 mg thiamin chloride hydrochloride/calf; Vitamin-B-Komplex, Serumwerk Bernburg, Germany).

After the last amplification cycle, a melting curve analysis was performed to generate single PCR products. Agarose gel electrophoresis followed, to confirm product purity and size. Subsequent sequencing was performed using an ABI 3130 Genetic Analyzer (Life Technologies). The efficiency was calculated using LinRegPCR 2013 software (Ruijter et al., 2009) . Samples with an efficiency below 1.8 were discarded, and the preparation was repeated. For each sample, a crossing point (quantification cycle) value, which represents the intersection of a fixed threshold above background fluorescence and the amplification curve, was determined by the LightCycler analysis software, v. 4.05. The quantification cycle values were imported to qBase+ software (Biogazelle NV, Zwijnaarde, Belgium; Saremi et al., 2012) , and selection of appropriate reference genes and quantification of the data were performed using this software.

The chambers were littered with straw. The photo period was 13 h light (from 0600 to 1900 h) and 11 h dark. The respiratory measurements started at 1600 h on d 2 and d 7 of life and ended at 1200 h on the following day. Gas exchange of CO 2 and O 2 was recorded at 6-min intervals. Feeding time was at 1700 h on d 2 and 7 and at 0700 h on d 3 and 8. The respiratory quotient (RQ) was defined as the quotient between the CO 2 production and the O 2 consumption of calves. Heat production, COX, and FOX were calculated using methods described by Derno et al. (2013) . Additionally, an infrared sensor (IS 120; Steinel, Herzbrock-Klarholz, Germany) that was installed in the chamber allowed for registration of the physical activity (standing, lying) of the calves. During feeding, the supporting person wore a face mask connected to the outside of the chamber to avoid falsification of the animals' gaseous exchange.",

The model used for analyses of the postprandial effects on d 1 and 9 included the fixed effects of group, day, and time after feeding, as well as their interactions. For evaluation of respiratory measurements, mean values per hour were calculated. For statistical analyses of respiratory measurements and calf activity, the fixed effects of group, day, and time (hourly means), as well as the corresponding interactions, were included in the statistical model. Repeated measures on every calf were considered, using the REPEATED statement of the MIXED procedure and an unstructured type of block diagonal residual covariance matrix. Least squares means (LSMeans) and their standard errors were computed for each fixed effect in the models, and all pairwise differences in LSMeans were tested with the Tukey-Kramer procedure. The SLICE statement of the MIXED procedure was used to conduct partitioned analyses of the LSMeans for interactions. Data on gene expression and glycogen concentration in the liver were analyzed using a single-factor variance analysis with group as the fixed effect. Effects and differences were defined as significant at P < 0.05 and as a trend at P < 0.1. Values are presented as LSMeans \u00b1 standard error if not stated otherwise in the text.",

In contrast, immunoglobulin concentrations in formula-fed calves remained low until the end of the experiment. The immunoglobulin intake was also reflected by the total plasma protein concentration, as shown in previous studies (Rauprich et al., 2000; Gruse et al., 2016) . The intention of the prophylactic treatments in formula-fed calves was to compensate for the lack of immunological protection by colostrum feeding. Nevertheless, 2 FOR calves got pneumonia and had to be replaced. Apparently, 1 of the 2 calves had swallowed amniotic fluid during the birth process, and formula feeding was probably not the main reason that this calf became sick. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that the second calf contracted pneumonia because it had not been fed colostrum. As known from literature, acute-phase proteins, such as albumin and haptoglobin, indicate inflammatory response and health problems in cattle (G\u00e5nheim et al., 2007; Tothova et al., 2014) . The remaining calves in the study did not demonstrate strong differences in acutephase proteins between groups. The trend for elevated plasma haptoglobin and lower albumin concentrations in colostrum-fed calves could not be associated with an impaired health status in these calves. Interestingly, previous findings in neonatal calves indicated higher plasma haptoglobin concentrations with milk-based formula feeding instead of initial colostrum feeding (Gruse et al., 2016) . In studies with pigs, it was shown data are presented as least squares means \u00b1 SE (n = 9 per group); *designates significant differences between feeding groups (P < 0.05). that haptoglobin is absorbed from colostrum and that endogenous haptoglobin synthesis is stimulated by colostrum feeding (Hiss-Pesch et al., 2011) .

The IGF-I status of calves is more affected by energy and protein intake than by colostrum intake (Frieten et al., 2018; Haisan et al., 2018) . However, postprandial time changes in plasma leptin and adiponectin after first feed intake behaved differently-both hormones increased after first colostrum feeding-showing the same postprandial time pattern as that observed for plasma concentrations of total protein and immunoglobulins. Both hormones are highly concentrated in first colostrum (Kesser et al., 2015 (Kesser et al., , 2017 , and the absorption of adiponectin from first colostrum was recently shown in neonatal calves (Kesser et al., 2015) . Leptin absorption from colostrum was less clear in previous studies, but an elevated plasma concentration of leptin was also associated with colostrum feeding (Blum et al., 2005; Sch\u00e4ff et al., 2014; Kesser et al., 2017) . Absorption of colostral leptin occurs in rats and humans (Szymeczko et al., 2009; Woli\u0144ski et al., 2014; Palou et al., 2018) . Previous studies indicated lower leptin and adiponectin concentrations in milk or milk-based formulas than in colostrum (Kesser et al., 2015 (Kesser et al., , 2017 . The lack of time changes in leptin and adiponectin in blood plasma of formula-fed calves on d 1 of life makes it very clear that the increase in leptin and adiponectin plasma concentrations after first colostrum feeding resulted from intestinal absorption of both hormones and that both hormones behaved differently than colostral IGF-I. Higher plasma concentrations of leptin and adiponectin were observed until the end of the study on d 10 of life. The differences in plasma leptin and adiponectin at the end of the study most likely do not result from different endogenous production due to variable body fat in COL and FOR calves. The body fat content in neonatal calves is low; for instance, percentage of perirenal fat in 2-wk-old calves is about 0.1 to 0.2% of carcass weight but is about 1.1 to 1.7% of carcass weight in dairy cows (Drackley et al., 2014; MacGhee et al., 2017) .",

Interestingly, insulin concentrations in blood plasma on the first day of life were much greater after formula feeding than after colostrum feeding, whereas the plasma glucose concentration was similar between the feeding groups. However, lactose content in the formula was greater than in colostrum, and therefore lactose intake from formula was greater than from colostrum, which may partly explain the greater insulin release after first feeding in FOR than in COL calves. In addition, it is possible that the colostral leptin and adiponectin in COL calves may have supported insulin action on glucose homeostasis and may have contributed to the lower plasma insulin release in colostrum-than in formulafed calves after first feed intake.

Differences in systemic IGF-I and IGBP are more related to changes in energy and protein intake (Sch\u00e4ff et al., 2016; Frieten et al., 2018; Haisan et al., 2018) . Because the nutrient supply was the same in formula-and colostrum-fed calves, IGF-I and IGFBP-2 and -3 plasma concentrations were similar in both groups. Interestingly, the plasma concentration of IGFBP-4 distinctly increased after colostrum feeding and therefore behaved differently between feeding groups, which was not the case for IGFBP-2 or -3. Whether elevated plasma IGFBP-4 indeed resulted from colostral IGFBP-4 absorption cannot be determined from the present study, because we did not measure the IGFBP-4 plasma concentration immediately after colostrum and formula feeding on d 1 of life. The concentration of IGFBP-4 is higher in colostrum than in mature milk (Sejrsen et al., 2001; Blum and Baumrucker, 2008; Meyer et al., 2017) .

The thyroid hormones stimulate thermogenesis, and the decrease in plasma T 3 and T 4 during the neonatal period is in line with the lower heat production at 7 and 8 d of age (Silva, 2006; Hammon et al., 2012; Sch\u00e4ff et al., 2014) . The greater heat production at feeding times might be a result of greater physical activity and, in addition, of stimulating digestive processes in the gastrointestinal tract at that time (Vermorel et al., 1983) . A greater metabolic heat production in formula-fed than in colostrum-fed calves during the first measurements on d 2 and 3 corresponded with an elevated body temperature in formula-fed calves on d 2 and 3. Although a trend oc-curred for higher body temperature in formula-fed than in colostrum-fed calves on d 8 of life, metabolic heat production was only numerically higher in formula-fed calves on d 7 and 8. Because of the prophylactic treatments in formula-fed calves, no clinical signs of disease appeared in this group, and the higher metabolic heat production may explain at least part of the elevated body temperature.",

            "text": "Metabolic heat production significantly differed when calves were fed either colostrum or formula but not when MR was provided to all calves and, surprisingly, was greater in formula-fed than in colostrum-fed calves. Interestingly, adiponectin decreases thermogenesis in mice (Qiao et al., 2014) . Therefore, the elevated adiponectin concentration in the blood plasma of colostrum-fed calves may have contributed to the lower heat production after colostrum feeding on d 2 of life. On the other hand, plasma concentrations of T 3 and leptin were higher in colostrum-fed than in formula-fed calves on d 2 and 3. Because thyroid hormones, leptin, and the sympathetic nervous system are supposed to stimulate thermogenesis and heat production (D\u00f6ring et al., 1998; Houseknecht et al., 1998; Havel, 2002; Silva, 2006) , the lower heat production on d 2 in colostrum-fed than in formula-fed calves is not in agreement with the elevated plasma T 3 and leptin concentrations in COL calves. The plasma concentrations of adrenaline and noradrenaline decreased after feeding but were similar on d 1 between groups. The reasons for this discrepancy in heat production and endocrine changes in calves due to different milk feedings are presently unknown. Considering that colostrum feeding stimulates anabolic processes in calves (Hammon et al., 2012 , the lack of colostrum intake may have impaired the start of postnatal anabolic metabolism in formula-fed calves and may have led to metabolic processes that resulted in elevated heat production. The elevated plasma urea concentration in formula-fed calves compared with colostrum-fed calves on d 1 and 2 may support this assumption by indicating enhanced amino acid degradation and probably less protein synthesis in formulafed calves. Colostrum feeding clearly supports anabolic processes and protein synthesis in neonatal pigs (Reeds et al., 2000) . Elevated plasma urea concentrations in formula-fed compared with colostrum-fed calves with the same protein intake were also reported previously in neonatal calves, indicating less use of amino acids for protein synthesis and elevated amino acid degradation and oxidation (Rauprich et al., 2000; Steinhoff-Wagner et al., 2011) .",

Carbohydrate oxidation increased and FOX decreased postprandially, but FOX increased at the end of the feeding intervals (i.e., before subsequent feed intake) in both groups. This pattern of substrate oxidation relative to feed intake is known from mice (Flatt, 1991) and has also been described in dairy cows (Derno et al., 2013) , and it resulted in an increase in the RQ after feed intake and lowest RQ at the end of the feeding interval. The mean RQ increased from d 2 and 3 to d 7 and 8, indicating that calves of both groups utilize more carbohydrates and less fat at the end of the first week of life. One reason for this change might be the elevated lactose content in MR compared with colostrum and formula on d 1 and 2, respectively. Therefore, different feeding for the first 2 d had no prolonged effects on substrate utilization and heat production in neonatal calves. On the other hand, data from respiratory measurements indicated comparable energy supplies of both groups during the first week of life. This finding is also supported by plasma NEFA concentration, which did not differ between groups and indicated no difference in body fat mobilization between groups.",

However, colostrum contains much more cholesterol than mature milk (Ontsouka et al., 2016) , but cholesterol was not measured in formula. Surprisingly, postprandial plasma concentrations of triglyceride and cholesterol were greater after formula than after colostrum intake on d 1. The relationship of triglyceride and cholesterol plasma concentrations changed with age. Higher concentrations of both metabolites were measured on d 3 in colostrum-fed than in formula-fed calves. Most studies in neonatal calves indicated an elevated triglyceride and cholesterol status after colostrum feeding compared with either formula or MR feeding immediately after birth (Hammon and Blum, 1998; K\u00fchne et al., 2000; Rauprich et al., 2000) . The reasons for these contradictory findings are presently unknown, but the differences may be partly the consequence of variable fat sources in the formulas (as a replacement of colostrum) and MR of the previous studies. Replacement of colostrum by formula or MR may affect cholesterol homeostasis and plasma cholesterol concentration in neonatal calves due to changes in cholesterol absorption, endogenous synthesis, and utilization (Ontsouka et al., 2016) , as reported among neonatal pigs (Ronis et al., 2011) . More studies are needed to clarify the importance of colostrum feeding and replacement of colostrum for cholesterol status in newborn calves.",

In addition, the postprandial decrease in noradrenaline and adrenaline was also described previously (Gruse et al., 2015) . With the exception of plasma noradrenaline on d 9 before feeding, no effects due to different milk diets for the first 2 d of life were observed. The higher plasma concentration of noradrenaline on d 9 cannot be explained by differences in metabolic or physical stress or housing between the groups and requires further verification. In contrast, plasma glucagon increased after the first feeding to a greater extent in formula-fed than in colostrumfed calves. The greater glucagon rise on d 1 of life in formula-fed than in colostrum-fed calves was observed in a previous study and was probably a response of the elevated insulin release in formula-fed calves. Glucagon release is stimulated by insulin in adult and neonatal cattle (Brockman and Laarveld, 1986; Hammon et al., 2012; Zarrin et al., 2015) . From d 3 on, plasma glucagon was higher in colostrum-fed than in formula-fed calves. An elevated plasma glucagon concentration due to colostrum feeding on first day of life has been observed in some (Hammon and Blum, 1998; Gruse et al., 2015) but not all studies with neonatal calves (Rauprich et al., 2000; Hammon et al., 2003; Steinhoff-Wagner et al., 2011) . There is no clear pattern of glucagon changes during the first week of life with respect to colostrum versus formula feeding for first 2 d of life. In addition, the lower hepatic expression of PCK1 on d 10 of life does not fit with the elevated plasma glucagon concentration and glucagonto-insulin ratio in colostrum-fed calves. The PCK1 gene codes for the cytosolic form of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, which is a rate-limiting enzyme for gluconeogenesis, stimulated by glucagon (Pilkis and Granner, 1992) , and its gene expression depends on neonatal maturation in calves (Hammon et al., 2012) . However, neonatal gluconeogenesis is not affected by colostrum versus formula feeding in calves (Scheuer et al., 2006; Steinhoff-Wagner et al., 2011) . Overall, the importance of the postnatal changes in plasma glucagon requires further investigation.",
