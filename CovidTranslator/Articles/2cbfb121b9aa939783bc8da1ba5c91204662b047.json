We used a SlCr release assay to study the susceptibility of oligodendrocyte-enriched glial cells to MHC-restricted and non-restricted immune-mediated cytolysis. Mitogen-activated mononuclear cells induced significant lysis in a lectin-dependent cytotoxicity assay. Mononuclear cells allo-activated in a one-way mixed lymphocyte culture with E-cells from the glial cell donor induced a significantly higher degree of oligodendrocyte cytolysis than mononuclear cells activated with E-cells bearing MHC-class I antigens discordant with the glia. Cytolysis by alloactivated unfractionated lymphocytes and by purified CD8 + lymphocytes was reduced by an anti-class I antibody (W6/32). Our findings suggest that human oligodendrocytes can be susceptible targets for MHC class I-restricted lysis.",

Whether the demyelination reflects a primary injury to the myelin sheath or to the oligodendrocyte (OGC), the myelin producing cell, remains speculative. A possible explanation for damage to myelin and/or the OGCs as observed in MS may be cellular immune-mediated injury. The involvement of such mechanisms is suggested by the presence of activated CD8 + and CD4 + T-lymphocytes and macrophages in the MS lesions and the demonstration that T-lymphocytes are required for the passive transfer of the animal model of MS, experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE) (Mokhtarian et al., 1984) .",

The isolation procedure was adapted from that reported by Kim et al. (1983) . Meninges and blood vessels were removed from the block specimens and the fragmented tissue was washed extensively to remove the blood. The tissue was enzymatically dissociated by use of 0.25% trypsin (Gibco Canada, Burlington, Ont., Canada) in Ca 2+-and Mg2+-free phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 1 h at 37\u00b0C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator. Trypsin was inactivated by addition of fetal calf serum (FCS; Gibco Canada) and the tissue was further mechanically dissociated by passage through two nylon meshes (210 and 132 /~m pore size; Industrial Fabrics Corporation, Minneapolis, MN, U.S.A.). The obtained suspension was washed once and separated on a 30% Percoll (Pharmacia LKB, Montreal, Que., Canada) gradient in a Beckman J2-21M/E centrifuge with a fixed angle 17J rotor (15,000 rpm at 4\u00b0C for 30 min). The gradient resulted in formation of an upper layer of PBS, a layer of densely packed myelin, a clear layer of glial cell suspension and a narrow band of red blood cells at the bottom. Glial cells were recovered, diluted in PBS and washed 3 times at 1800, 1500 and 1200 rpm respectively in a Beckman IEC Centra-8R centrifuge with swinging bucket 216 rotor. Viable cell numbers, usually > 90%, were estimated under a haemocytometer by trypan blue exclusion and cells were resuspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM; Gibco Canada) supplemented with penicillin 2.5 U/ml, streptomycin 2.5/tg/ml, glutamine 2 mM (all from Gibco Canada) and 10% FCS and plated on 80 cm 2 tissue culture flasks (Nunclon, Gibco Canada). After 24-48 h, floating cells were removed and plated on poly-Llysine (10 /xg/ml, Sigma, St. Louis, MO, U.S.A.) coated cell culture flasks at a density of 10 6 per ml in DMEM supplemented with 5% human AB + serum (normal human serum, NHS).",

The cells were labelled with 51Cr (1 ~Ci per well) overnight. Average labelling with 51Cr was approximately 5400 counts per minute (cpm) per well, with a range of approximately 1100-20,000 cpm/well over all experiments. No correlation was observed between total 51Cr labelling and the percentage of OGCs in the culture when assessed in a series of cultures containing 10-90% OGCs. On the day of the assay, cells were gently washed twice and allowed to stand for 30 min before lectin-activated or mixed lymphocyte culture (MLC)-activated lymphocytes (effector cells), prepared as described below, were added to triplicate or quadruplicate wells. In most studies a 10 : 1 effector/target ratio was used, except where indicated in the Results section. After a 5-6 h incubation with the lymphocytes, supernatants (A) were removed and counted in an LKB 1272 Clinigamma counter. Aliquots of 5 N NaOH were added to each well for 20 rain and supernatants (B) removed and counted for remaining radioactivity. The percentage lysis was calculated by dividing the cpm of supernatant A by the total labelling (supernatants A + B). The value for specific lysis was obtained by subtracting the mean percentage of spontaneous release in 51Cr-labelled control wells which had been incubated with media only.",

The levels of specific lysis observed in cultures which contained > 70% and > 80% OGCs ruled out the possibility that a population of non-OGC cells were exclusively the targets of MHC class I-dependent lysis. The observation was confirmed by separate studies showing quantitative reductions in OGCs following exposure to allo-activated MNCs. Our conclusion regarding the susceptibility of OGCs to MHC class I-restricted lysis was further supported by the findings that cytotoxicity by CD8 + class I-dependent lymphocytes exceeded that by CD4 + class II-dependent lymphocytes and specific cell lysis could be reduced by anti-MHC class I antibodies. The residual lysis by CD8 + T-lymphocytes of OGC after pre-incubation with the anti-MHC class I antibody, together with the observation that lymphocytes allo-activated with MHC class I-discordant E-cells induce some specific lysis of OGC, suggest that some degree of lysis mediated by CD8 + cells is not MHC restricted. In previous studies with neonatal murine astrocytes, we have demonstrated that MHC class I-directed cytotoxic lymphocytes could lyse astrocytes. This cytotoxic effect was lost with target astrocytes from mutant animals which lacked the sensitizing MHC class I antigens (Skias et al., 1987) . The observed class I-restricted lysis of OGCs suggests that MHC class I molecules on OGCs could contribute to susceptibility of these cells to either antigenspecific cytotoxicity or to lysis by autoreactive cytotoxic cells (Bimbaum et al., 1984) , if expression of MHC antigens occurred in vivo, as is the case in viral infection in mice (Suzumura et al., 1986c) .",
