This initiative contains important health components. Simultaneously, China launched an unprecedented overseas intervention against Ebola virus in west Africa, dispatching 1200 workers, including Chinese military personnel. The overseas development assistance provided by China has been increasing by 25% annually, reaching US$7 billion in 2013. Development assistance for health from China has particularly been used to develop infrastructure and provide medical supplies to Africa and Asia. China's contributions to multilateral organisations are increasing but are unlikely to bridge substantial gaps, if any, vacated by other donors; China is creating its own multilateral funds and banks and challenging the existing global architecture. These new investment vehicles are more aligned with the geography and type of support of the Belt and Road Initiative. Our analysis concludes that China's Belt and Road Initiative, Ebola response, development assistance for health, and new investment funds are complementary and reinforcing, with China shaping a unique global engagement impacting powerfully on the contours of global health.",

The initiative has increasingly emerged as China's major vehicle for international engagement, with important health dimensions. 2 In January, 2017, China's President Xi signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with WHO that endorsed inter national health regulation and promoted health security on the Silk Road. 3 In May, 2017, China hosted the Road and Belt Summit in Beijing, which was attended by 29 heads of state and, in August, 2017, China launched the first of what will be biennial global conferences of health on the Belt and Road. 4 More than 30 health ministers and leaders of multilateral agencies signed the Beijing Communique of follow-up priorities. 5 What is China's 21st Century Belt and Road Initiative? How does this initiative relate to China's role in global health? How are China's major global health activities, such as Ebola response, ODA, and DAH, related to the initiative? And what are the implications for global health? Through analyses of quantitative and qualitative data, we discuss the rapidly developing Belt and Road Initiative and related global health activities.",

Historically, the Silk Road was an ancient network of routes that facilitated trade and movement of the arts, culture, religion, knowledge, and medicine, and enhanced relations between people and between countries. 6 China's Belt and Road Initiative of the 21st century is primarily a regional plan for economic integration, covering 65 countries that contain 70% of the world's population, 30% of global gross domestic product (GDP), and 75% of world energy reserves. 7 The Silk Road has two routes. The Silk Road Economic Belt is a series of land-based economic corridors connecting China with countries in central and western Asia, the Middle East, and eastern and central Europe. The 21st century Maritime Silk Road will traverse the South China Sea, the Indian Ocean, and the Mediter ranean, covering southeast and south Asia and extending into sub-Saharan Africa. Both the land and maritime routes eventually connect China, across Asia and Africa, to Europe. 8 The initiative is not a single project but a long-term strategy to boost the region's economic development by enhancing trade, infrastructure, and connectivity by building networks of railways, highways, bridges, airports, ports, oil and gas pipelines, and fibre optics. So far, China has reached bilateral agreements with about half of the proposed countries and, in 2016, Chinese enterprises reportedly signed nearly 4000 contracts, valued at US$93 billion, in 60 countries. 9 Previous analyses 8,10 have estimated that China plans to invest up to 9% of its GDP into this initiative, an amount 12 times larger in absolute dollar value than the US-led Marshall Plan for the reconstruction of Europe after World War 2.",

A concluding so-called Beijing Communique was adopted by more than 30 health ministers and high-level representatives from multilateral health agencies. 5 Seventeen bilateral MoUs were signed between China and surrounding Silk Road countries and agencies such as UNAIDS (Joint United Nations Programme on HIV and AIDS), the Global Fund, and Gavi (the Vaccine Alliance). The agreements covered many areas, such as health security, maternal and child health, health policy, health systems, hospital management, human resources, medical research, and traditional medicine. The Chinese Government plans to launch four networks-public health, policy research, hospital alliance, and health industry-to promote continuous exchange in the search for cooperative opportunities under the broader goal of advancing the UN 2030 Sustainable Development Goals.",

Many barriers will have to be overcome, such as buy-in from neighbouring countries, cultural and linguistic differ ences, varying legal frame works, and environmental sustainability. Questions have also been raised about the economic risks and viability of many proposed infra structure investments. 13 Although high-level meetings have provided a clearer scope for the Belt and Road health plans, there is an absence of measurable targets and prescribed indicators to evaluate success. Health appears to be both a valued goal and a necessary diplomatic instrument of the initiative. experts, and military medical officers, were deployed to west Africa. [14] [15] [16] China opened a 100-bed treatment unit and established three field demonstration sites in Sierra Leone. The Chinese medical and public health professionals provided free treatment, and zero infection among these workers was achieved through intensive management and training. 15, [17] [18] [19] In March 2015, China built a biosafety level-3 laboratory, transporting in all construction materials in only 87 days. 14 There are probably several reasons for China's unprecedented response. China has a long-standing friendship and commercial linkages with Africa. Like other countries, China also sought to protect its own citizens, since there are about 1\u00b71 million Chinese people living in Africa and an estimated 100 000 African migrants living in Guangzhou, China. 20, 21 China tightened airport screening to avoid introduction of people with Ebola into the country, which could spoil its hosting of several major international events (eg, the Youth Olympics Games). Perhaps most importantly, the Ebola epidemic was reminiscent of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic in China of 2002-03. SARS originated in China and spread to 37 countries, exerted a catastrophic effect on the Chinese economy, and almost halted its international trade. China's economic loss from this epidemic was estimated at $25\u00b73 billion, slowing down GDP growth by 1-2% in 2003. 16, 22 China was also widely criticised for concealing information and failing to comply with international health regulations. The importance of health security to China seemed to be confirmed when it signed two MoUs with WHO in 2017 on strengthening the international health regulation, especially on the Silk Road.",

In tackling Ebola, China learned the difficulties of overseas operational work: communications and operational barriers across ministries (foreign affairs, commerce, health, and the military), between head quarters and the front lines, and working across cultures. Applying China's experience in domestic disease control to Ebola, China instituted disease surveillance with community-based house-to-house case finding, contact tracing, community mobilisation, and health education in Sierra Leone. 23 The Chinese workers learned that active surveillance and quarantine, which was effective during the SARS epidemic, requires strong management on the ground and compliant health-seeking behaviour, which can differ across cultures. The medical and public health teams concluded that China needs much stronger professional and organisational capability for future overseas work. Few of the Chinese workers sent to Sierra Leone had previous overseas experience. To sustain the newly built biosafety level-3 laboratory, training of local professionals and sustained funding beyond single-year emergency budgets were needed. Chinese professionals dispatched to fight Ebola have admirably published several papers on their experiences. 14, 15, 18, 19 Although their success has been lauded, more systematic monitoring and evalu ation is suggested by these studies.",

The first is the promotion of health security, as illustrated by the Ebola response and follow-up funding. The second is the Belt and Road Initiative, which will be accom panied by new multilateral institutional arrangements. The third is the sharp increase in China's financing of global health through DAH and ODA and new investment vehicles.",

There are important worries about the stability of funding pledges by some donors. Although China's ODA and DAH will remain mostly bilateral and country-focused, China is likely to pursue increasing cooperation with multilateral initiatives like Global Fund, Gavi, and UNAIDS, and to align its relevant health agreements under the Belt and Road Initiative theme, such as the ASEAN-China, Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation, China-Central and Eastern Europe 16 + 1, Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, and the China-Mongolia-Russia Economic Corridor. However, China has also launched its own multilateral funds and banks. Thus, it seems very unlikely that China would simply fill large gaps in funding vacated by other donors. Cooperative ventures might be pursued but not simply on terms established by the existing multilateral framework. For example, increased interconnectivity along the Silk Road Economic Belt and 21st Century Maritime Silk Road will not only bring about international health risks but also new opportunities for cooperation. To this end, China has joined the UN Development Programme in seeking to advance the 2030 UN Sustainable Development Goals, especially in the Silk Road Economic Belt and 21st Century Maritime Silk Road countries. 30 Notably, China has reaffirmed its commitment to the Paris Accord on climate change, although the Belt and Road Initiative plans are largely silent on the health dimensions of global warming.",

Indeed, China has reaffirmed its commitment to the Paris Climate Accord, despite the announced withdrawal of the USA. Like all major powers, China's participation in multilateral governance will be driven by its geopolitical and economic 32 China also has about $3 trillion in foreign reserves, and investing abroad will enable the Chinese to make use of idle reserves and promote the Chinese reminbi as a global currency. The Belt and Road Initiative will also harness China's surplus capacity in steel output and stateowned enterprises for building infrastructure. Chinese firms also are confident that they will be competitive in winning contracts of new projects. Since trade will promote the movement of goods, people, and infectious diseases, health protection against pandemic diseases will be essential to achieve economic goals. 29 Beyond SARs, China has experienced exportation of infectious diseases from adjacent countries on its western borders, such as polio virus from Pakistan and malaria from southeast Asia. 33, 34 The future of China's global health policy will be shaped, in part, by Chinese professional and organisational capabilities. China has few global health professionals with field experience and there are limited career paths or incentives for global health work. Indeed, China has not yet filled its allocated share of positions in UN organisations, given the small pool of its human resources for global health. China's medical universities are just starting work in global health research and education. 35 Global health knowledge, engagement, and support from the Chinese public is just beginning. The Ebola epidemic and the Belt and Road Initiative, nevertheless, sparked the creation of two new departments dedicated to global health. A NHFPC vice minister has been assigned a newly created portfolio in global health, and the Chinese CDC has established a new global health department. A draft statement about China's global health policy has been circulating for review, and there are active discussions about revamping the NHFPC's Department of International Cooperation, traditionally a health aidreceiving agency, into an outward-looking global health agency. These new health bodies will inject a stronger health component into China's ODA policy, which is under the coordination of the Foreign Aid Department of the Ministry of Commerce. For historical reasons, only China's medical teams are managed directly by the NHFPC; all other health-related projects are planned and managed by the Ministry of Commerce.
