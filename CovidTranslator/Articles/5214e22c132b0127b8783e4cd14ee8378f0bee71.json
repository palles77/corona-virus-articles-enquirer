In this study, a recombinant protein (rS268, corresponding to residues 268-1255 of SARS-CoV S protein) was expressed in Escherichia coli and was purified to near homogeneity. After immunization with rS268, S protein-specific BALB/c antisera and mAbs were induced and confirmed using ELISA, Western blot and IFA. Several BALB/c mAbs were found to be effectively to neutralize the infection of Vero E6 cells by SARS-CoV in a dose-dependent manner. Systematic epitope mapping showed that all these neutralizing mAbs recognized a 15-residues peptide (CB-119) corresponding to residues 1143-1157 (SPDVDLGDISGINAS) that was located to the second heptad repeat (HR2) region of the SARS-CoV spike protein. The peptide CB-119 could specifically inhibit the interaction of neutralizing mAbs and spike protein in a dose-dependent manner. Further, neutralizing mAbs, but not control mAbs, could specifically interact with CB-119 in a dose-dependent manner. Results implicated that the second heptad repeat region of spike protein could be a good target for vaccine development against SARS-CoV.",

            "text": "It is now well-documented and strong evidence supporting that a new emerging coronavirus (CoV) is etiologically linked to the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in Asia and Canada last year [1] [2] [3] . SARS associated CoV has several major structural proteins: membrane (M) and spike (S) glycoprotein, and nucleocapsid (N) and envelop (E) proteins [4] . Of these structural proteins, it is thought that the S protein is a multifunctional protein that plays complex and central role in the biology and pathogenesis of SARS infection [4] . Major known properties and functions of the coroavirus S protein had been found to include: (a) binding to specific receptor glycoproteins on the surface of host cells; (b) after binding to receptor the S protein possible conformational changes causing induction of fusion of the viral envelop with the cell membrane; (c) cell fusion facilitating viral RNA entry into host; (d) a target for induction of the neutralizing antibody and (e) elicitation of cell-mediated immunity [4] . It had been demonstrated the N-terminal 600 amino acids (S1 domain) associated with altered antigenicity and virulence [5, 6] . Actually, there were considerable diversity in both the lengths and nucleotide sequences of the S1 derived from different groups of coronaviruses, and sometime even within different strains of a single family of coronavirus [7] [8] [9] [10] . Alignment of the amino acid sequences of the SARS-CoV S (GI 29836496) and HCoV-229E spike proteins (GI 13604334) had revealed only 29% identity. This indicated that there was very considerable diversity of S proteins between SARS-CoV and other human coronavirus (HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43).",

As shown in Figure 4a , neutralizing mAbs (Mab 1, 3, 5, and 8) bound to recombinant S protein fragments common with the trans-membrane domain (D1-TM and D2-TM). Further epitope mapping shown that all these neutralizing mAbs recognized peptides covering residues 1128-1168 (CB 116-123), as illustrated in Figure 4b . Actually, all these neutralizing mAbs specifically bound to an individual synthetic peptide, CB119, which only comprised of a 15-amino acid (SPDVDLGDISGINAS) and was located at the tip of one heptad repeat region (HR2) of the SARS-CoV spike protein (Figure 4c ). The binding of antibodies to this heptad region was specific and sufficiently to neutralize the infection of VERO E6 cells by SARS-CoV, since all strong neutralizing mAbs (Mab 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, and 8) bound to CB119 peptide but not for the weak or non-neutralizing mAbs (4, 6, 9, 12, and 13) (Figure 5a ). Results from this study revealed that mAbs binding to the heptad repeat region of spike protein could sufficiently neutralize the infection of SARS-CoV. ",

As illustrated in Figure 5b , CB119 peptide, but not control peptide SP2, inhibited neutralizing mAbs (Mab 1 and 2) binding to spike protein in a dose-dependent manner. Meanwhile, CB119 peptide could not efficiently inhibit non-neutralizing mAb (Mab 6) binding to spike protein. The competitive inhibition of mAbsspike protein interaction by CB119 was specific, since control peptides (SP2, SP-SGNCD, SP-SGIAA, SP-DLG) had no inhibition effect (Figure 5c ). Further characterization of mAb-HR2 interaction by ELISA, as illustrated in Figure 5d , neutralizing mAbs have differential features for their binding to synthetic peptides mimicking various amino acid residues of heptad repeat region of spike protein. For example, some mAbs (Mab 1, 5, 7, and 8) bound to CB119IA peptide almost equally to wild type peptide (CB119); some did not (Mab 2 and 3) .

To test this hypothesis, an EMSA assay was performed to examine the binding characterization of mAbs to synthetic peptides. This experiment used a Digoxigenin-labeled synthetic peptide (SP 1143-1172 -Dig) as a probe. When there is no binding protein, it should migrate faster in polyacrylamide gel. Once there is binding protein (or antibody), the peptide-antibody complex should migrate slower than free peptide. Both free peptide and peptide-antibody complex should bind to POD-conjugated Anti-Digoxigenin secondary antibody and be detected by ECL substrate. As illustrated in Figure 6 , synthetic peptide probe (SP 1143-1172 -Dig) representing HR2 heptad repeat region specially bound to neutralizing mAb (Mab 5) in a dose-dependent manner (lanes 8-9), but not to non-neutralizing mAb (Mab 6) (lane 10). When lysates of SARS-CoV infected cells was added in, the peptide-mAb complex was competed by SARS-CoV virus-infected cell lysates in a dosedependent manner (lanes 4-6). Result from this study showed that mAbs specifically recognizing the heptad repeat region might neutralize the infection of cells by SARS-CoV in a dose-dependent manner with differential features. Thus, it implicates that it might be practicable to prevent human infection of SARS-CoV by recombinant subunit vaccine or synthetic peptides mimicking amino acid residues of heptad repeat region of spike protein.",

Rabbit antisera generated from recombinant S full immunization had potent virus neutralization activity comparable to SARS patients' sera (data not shown). Meanwhile, mouse immunized with rS 268 did generate virus neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV. In the present studies, some of mAbs against recombinant spike protein had strong neutralization effect as seen in the virus neutralization assay; but some of mAbs had little or no neutralization effect (Table 2, Figure 3a was further supported that different mAbs have various binding activity for synthetic peptides mimicking spike protein (Figure 5c and d) . As 10 lg per 10 4 pfu/10 5 cells monoclonal antibodies [1, 5, 8, 16, 17] recognized the epitope (residues 1143-1157), could sufficiently neutralize SARS-CoV infection through blocking the virus entry into Vero E6 cells. The neutralization epitope (residues 1143-1157) mapped in this study was located at the tip of the heptad repeat region of spike protein, the HR-C domain. Thus, these mAbs likely neutralized the infection of SARS-CoV through inhibiting virus entry into Vero E6 cells with a mechanism that was different from virus-ACE2 receptor binding blocking mechanism reported by others [15] . Because viral-cellular membrane fusion mediated by several type I viral fusion proteins (for example, HIV gp160) could be inhibited by peptide mimicking either the HR-N or HR-C regions [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] . Author suggest that the HR1 and HR2 regions are crucial in the entry of SARS-CoV, and support the assumption that SARS-CoV may employ the same fusion mechanism as HIV-1 and other viruses with class I envelope proteins [28] . Studies indicate that after SARS-CoV binding to the target cell, the transmembrane spike protein might change conformation by association between the HR1 (residues 902-952; 915-950; 889-926) and HR2 (1145-1184; 1151-1185; 1161-1178) regions to form an oligomeric structure, leading to fusion between the viral and target-cell membranes [28] [29] [30] [31] . Therefore, HR2 has been suggested to use as a potent inhibitor peptides or a target for the development of therapeutic drug for SARS-CoV [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] . In this study, mAbs bound to HR-C regions and might inhibit the HR-N and HR-C forming coiled-coil structure that was required for viral-cellular membrane fusion, so neutralized the infection of SARS-CoV by blocking virus entry into Vero cells. However, our data showed rabbit antisera immunized with recombinant spike protein did not react with the CB119 peptide (data not shown). These rabbit antisera could have different virus neutralization effects. Recently, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) was reported as a functional receptor for the SARS coronavirus in Vero E6 cells by Li et al. [34] . ACE2 receptorassociated epitope on SARS-CoV spike protein had been identified to be within residues 310-527 6-7) . The probe-antibody complex was separated from the free probe by electrophoresis on a 5% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel. After this, Western blotting was finished as described in the Materials and Methods. Position of the probe-antibody complexes are indicated on the right. [15] . Further studies should be investigated to map the neutralization epitopes recognized by the rabbit antisera.",

Result from this study showed that mAbs, specifically recognizing the heptad repeat region of spike protein, might neutralize the infection of cells by SARS-CoV through binding to the neutralizing epitope located on the HR-C of spike protein. Further, monoclonal antibodies differently bind to synthetic peptides mimicking HR2 region implicated presence of several potential neutralizing epitopes. Thus, it might be practicable to prevent human infection of SARS-CoV by recombinant subunit vaccine or synthetic peptides mimicking optimal amino acid residues, such as virus neutralization epitope SPDVDLGDISGINAS, of heptad repeat region of spike protein.",

The probe-antibody complex was separated from the probe by electrophoresis on a 5 nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel. After this, Western blotting was finished as described in the Materials and Methods. Position of the probe-antibody complexes are indicated on the right.",
