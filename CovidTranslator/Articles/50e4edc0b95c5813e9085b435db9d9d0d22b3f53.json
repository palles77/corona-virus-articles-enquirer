In the first year of the study, patients received standard optimized care (SOC), according to their underlying disease condition (asthma, allergic rhinitis, or COPD). In the following year, patients received treatment with OM-85 oral bacterial lysate (one 7 mg capsule daily for ten consecutive days per month, for 3 months), with a 6-month follow-up. Medical history, clinical symptoms, serum, and secretory IgA levels, and the number of infections and exacerbations were evaluated before and after treatment. Results There was a decrease in the total number of RTIs before the OM-85 treatment period (SOC only) compared to the year before the study start [69/266 (corresponding to a 74 % reduction)] and an additional decrease [38/69 (corresponding to a 45 % reduction)] after OM-85 treatment; p \\ 0.05. There was also a significant reduction in the total number of exacerbations related to the patients' underlying medical conditions, which decreased from 55 to 35 during OM-85 (?SOC) treatment, corresponding to a reduction of 36 %. In addition, an increase in serum and secretory IgA levels which coincided with the administration of OM-85 was observed. Conclusions Our results showed the clinical benefits of OM-85 in reducing RTIs and exacerbations of the underlying medical condition, in patients with allergic rhinitis, asthma, or COPD.",

There is extensive literature on the synergistic effect between viruses and bacteria in the pathogenesis of respiratory infections [2] . Regardless of whether they are viral or bacterial, the presence of pathogens in the respiratory tract triggers the involvement of the innate and adaptive mucosal immune systems. Innate mucosal immunity is related to the function of the epithelial lining of the respiratory tract, including the production of antimicrobial peptides, the cytotoxic actions of NK cells, and the engulfment of pathogens by monocytes/macrophages and neutrophils. A key event among the actions of the acquired immune system is the production of IgA molecules.",

Immediately after, the sample was incubated with anti-IgE anti-serum labeled with I 125 , for 18-24 h at room temperature. Afterwards, disks were washed and the remaining radioactivity was measured using a Wistar-38 gamma counter.

Of note, normal specific IgE levels are expressed in kU/L or U/mL (same numeric value for both), and in classes (positive or negative). A non-sensitized person has undetectable levels of specific IgE. If IgE is absent, the IgE is said to be negative; and if it is present, it is said to be positive.

Other clinical symptoms that were frequently observed included nasal congestion and odynophagia, which was in some cases accompanied by hoarseness, ocular congestion with tears, retrosternal cough pain, and gastrointestinal symptoms (including nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea). A few patients presented with speech difficulties and alteration of consciousness. Patients who exhibited signs of imminent acute respiratory claudication, including bradycardia, absence of wheezing, paradoxical thoracicoabdominal respiratory movement, cyanosis, and sensory depression were hospitalized immediately in intensive care units.",

Clinical symptoms included nasal congestion with pharyngeal irritation and cough, watery rhinorrhea, and sneezing. All these symptoms are consistent with the underlying allergic rhinitis, although there was an increase in their intensity and these were frequently accompanied by fever. The amount of post-nasal mucus and the transformation from pale to erythematous nasal mucosa are indicators of a stronger inflammatory process, such as that triggered by respiratory infections. There were no cases of acute bacterial rhinitis in our study.",

There is a large body of literature supporting the association between viral infections and asthma, independently of age, phenotype, and asthma stage during which the viral infection occurs [34] . The role of bacterial infections, however, is controversial and is less well-established compared to that of viruses. Of note, we detected the presence of viruses in nearly 60 % of the patients with severe asthma who required intensive care support. Among our patients with asthma who had bacterial infections, we identified the strains H. influenza and C. pneumoniae. Our clinical observations are in agreement with those reported in the literature, indicating that in patients with asthma, viral infections are more frequently associated with asthma crises, regardless of the phenotype, asthma duration, and natural history of the disease, but bacterial infections lead to an increase in inflammation and a worsening of the disease [35, 36] . Recent studies have demonstrated that the use of immunomodulators can shift Th2 responses to Th1 responses [37, 38] , thereby reducing hypersensitivity-associated responses in predisposed patients. Reductions in recurrent infections induced by OM-85 may be attributed to increased secretory IgA levels [21, 39, 40] . There are studies showing that secretory IgA may compensate for IgG immunodeficiencies [41] .",
