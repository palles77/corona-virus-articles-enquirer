            "text": "This meta-analysis synthesized current evidence from 10 trials to evaluate the association between steroid therapy and osteonecrosis incidence in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Our results suggest that higher cumulative doses and longer treatment durations of steroids are more likely to lead to the development of osteonecrosis in SARS patients. Introduction The link between steroid treatment and the risk of osteonecrosis in SARS patients remains unknown. The present meta-analysis aimed to examine the dose-response association between steroid therapy and osteonecrosis incidence in SARS patients. The sex differences in the development of steroid-induced osteonecrosis were also examined. Methods We searched PubMed, Web of Science, CNKI, and WANFANG for studies that involved steroid therapy and reported osteonecrosis data in SARS patients. Two authors independently extracted the data from the individual studies, and the rate ratio (RR) of osteonecrosis was calculated using random-effect models. Results Ten studies with 1137 recovered SARS patients met the inclusion criteria. Close relationships between osteonecrosis incidence and both the cumulative dose and treatment duration of steroids were observed. The summary RR of osteonecrosis was 1.57 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.30-1.89, p < 0.001) per 5.0 g increase in the cumulative dose of steroids and was 1.29 (95% CI 1.09-1.53, p = 0.003) for each 10-day increment of increase in treatment duration. The relationship was non-linear (p non-linear < 0.001 and p non-linear = 0.022). There were no significant differences in the risk of developing osteonecrosis between the male and female patients (RR 0.01, 95% CI \u22120.03 to 0.06, p = 0.582). Conclusions SARS patients who received higher cumulative doses and longer treatment durations of steroids were more likely to develop osteonecrosis, and there were no sex differences in this dose-dependent side effect. Our findings suggest that it is important to reduce osteonecrosis risk by modifying the cumulative dose and the treatment duration of steroids in SARS patients.",

            "text": "Steroids are the most commonly used immunomodulatory agents for modulating immune activities and reducing inflammation in various critical diseases [1] . However, since the introduction of steroids for the treatment of autoimmune diseases, investigators have become aware of injurious effects [2, 3] . There is an abundance of literature documenting steroidrelated osteonecrosis [4, 5] , and a causal relationship has been well established. Steroid use has become the most common non-traumatic cause of osteonecrosis, with a prevalence ranging from 3 to 38% [6] . The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003 caused approximately 8098 people to be infected with SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [7] . The SARS-CoV was a novel virus that human beings were encountering for the first time, and they had no effective antiviral agents for treatment. High-dose steroid treatment was frequently prescribed in severe cases to reduce immune activities and other symptoms [7, 8] . The wide use of steroids resulted in the development of serious side effects in many recovered SARS patients, including osteonecrosis [9, 10] . However, the relationship between steroid therapy and osteonecrosis remains unclear, partly because although a number of studies had reported the prevalence of steroid-related osteonecrosis in recovered patients [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] , some of them failed to address the regimens used [21] [22] [23] . The absence of information regarding steroid administration regimens prevented researchers from making precise evaluations of this link. Additionally, Felson and colleagues [24] reported that there was a dose-response relationship between steroid use and the incidence of osteonecrosis. However, whether there is a similar doseresponse relationship in SARS patients who received steroids remains unknown. Furthermore, we wondered if there were sex differences in the development of steroid-related osteonecrosis in SARS patients. Therefore, in the current meta-analysis, we aimed to examine the effects of steroid therapy on osteonecrosis in recovered SARS patients. The sex differences in the development of steroid-induced osteonecrosis were also examined.",

When we removed the study with the largest positive impact [20] , the summary RR of osteonecrosis was 1.49 (95% CI 1.24-1.81, p < 0.001) for each 5-g increment of the total dose of steroids. We repeated the analysis after excluding the study with the largest negative impact [16] , and the summary RR of osteonecrosis was 1.68 (95% CI 1.36-2.07, p < 0.001) per 5 g increase in cumulative dose. Our visual inspection of the funnel plots of cumulative dose (Electronic Supplementary Material 3) and treatment duration (Electronic Supplementary Material 4) suggested that there was a slight asymmetry; it was likely that the heterogeneity between the studies contributed to the asymmetry because several data points were outside of the 95% confidence limits. Furthermore, our examination of the heterogeneity between studies suggested that the summary estimates of cumulative dose and treatment duration were heterogeneous.",

Our findings indicate that the relationships between osteonecrosis incidence and both cumulative dose and treatment duration of steroids are non-linear. The subgroup analysis revealed that there were no sex differences in the development of steroid-induced osteonecrosis between male and female patients. Although side effects had been reported over the past decade in SARS-recovered patients who had received steroid therapy, a clear link between steroid administration and osteonecrosis incidence was previously unclear. Our study demonstrates for the first time that both cumulative dose and treatment duration of steroids are closely associated with the occurrence of osteonecrosis in recovered SARS patients. A non-linear relationship was observed between cumulative dose and osteonecrosis, and the non-linear regression (Fig. 4) suggested that the risk of osteonecrosis remained rela t i v e l y l o w w h e n t h e t o t a l d o s e o f s t e r o i d s (methylprednisolone) was \u22645 g. However, the incidence of osteonecrosis increased when the total dose increased from 5 up to 10 g and seemed to reach the highest risk with a total dose of approximately 10-15 g. Our findings suggest that lower cumulative doses of steroids (methylprednisolone <5 g) are relatively safe for SARS patients, and physicians should avoid using high doses of steroids, especially for cumulative doses >10 g.",

In a 13-year follow-up study, Nakamura and colleagues [31] reported that approximately 15% of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients requiring increased steroid doses developed osteonecrosis. Shibatani and colleagues [32] evaluated renal-transplant recipients who underwent multiple rejection cycles and demonstrated a close relationship (OR 4.2, p = 0.008) between osteonecrosis and cumulative steroid dose. Felson and colleagues [24] reported a liner dose-response relationship between steroid usage and osteonecrosis incidence, showing a 4.6% increase in the risk of osteonecrosis for every 10 mg/day increase in oral steroids during the first 6 months of therapy. It is difficult to distinguish between the effects of the total dose and mean daily dose of steroids on osteonecrosis because the patients who had received a higher cumulative dose usually had also received a higher mean daily dose. For example, the average total dose of steroids taken by SARS patients in our meta-analysis was approximately 4.6 g, which meant that they had received a mean daily dose of 158 mg. Summarily, our findings suggest that the cumulative dose of steroids is a strong predictor of the risk of osteonecrosis in SARS patients.",

Our work provides more important information concerning this link. Our non-linear regression (Fig. 5) indicated that treatment durations that were \u226430 days remained safe for SARS patients, with an RR for osteonecrosis of approximately 1.0, but the osteonecrosis risk increased with an increase in treatment duration from 30 up to 40 days and appeared to reach its highest risk at approximately 50 days.

In contrast, the mean time of occurrence of osteonecrosis in the renal-transplant cohorts included in Felson's review ranged from 12 to 18.6 months. The onset of osteonecrosis in patients with SLE often occurs later, with a mean time from the initiation of steroid treatment to the occurrence of osteonecrosis of 3.4 to 5.5 years [33, 34] . The differences in the lengths of time for development of osteonecrosis might be due to the high doses of steroids used in SARS patients, with an average total dose of 4.6 g in a mean treatment period of 30 days. Additionally, the discrepancies between the studies might also be due to recent increases in the use of MRI for the diagnosis of early-stage osteonecrosis, which may have otherwise been undetectable by a radiographic assessment. Saito et al. [35] reported that osteonecrosis was closely associated with total steroid dose, and they detected occurrences of osteonecrosis within 2 weeks after renaltransplant surgery. They argued that MRI has a high sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of osteonecrosis compared with a radiographic examination. Therefore, both high-dose steroid usage and MRI use probably contributed to the earlier detection of osteonecrosis in SARS patients.",
