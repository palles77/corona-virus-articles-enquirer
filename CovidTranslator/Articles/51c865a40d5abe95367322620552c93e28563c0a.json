Currently, there is no effective treatment for PRRSV and PEDV, and commercial vaccines do not induce sterilizing immunity. In this study, we screened a library of 1000 compounds and identified two specific inhibitors, designated compounds 2 and 3, which target the PRRSV 3C-like serine protease (3CLSP). First, we evaluated the inhibitory effects of compounds 2 and 3 on PRRSV 3CLSP activity. Next, we determined the anti-PRRSV capacity of compounds 2 and 3 in MARC-145 cells and obtained EC 50 and CC 50 values of 57 \u03bcM (CC 50 = 479.9 \u03bcM) and 56.8 \u03bcM (CC 50 = 482.8 \u03bcM), respectively. Importantly, compounds 2 and 3 also targeted the PEDV 3C-like protease (3CL protease) and inhibited PEDV replication, showing EC 50 and CC 50 values of 100 \u03bcM (CC 50 = 533.8 \u03bcM) and 57.9 \u03bcM (CC 50 = 522.3 \u03bcM), respectively. Finally, our results indicated that the active sites (His39 in 3CLSP and His41 in 3CL protease) were conservative, and contacted compounds 2 and 3 via hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic forces in the putative substrate-binding models. In summary, compounds 2 and 3 exhibit broad-spectrum antiviral activity and may facilitate the development of antiviral drugs against PRRSV and PEDV.",

Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), a member of the family Arteriviridae (Snijder et al., 2013) , has been a major threat to the worldwide swine industry since its discovery in the early 1990s (Wensvoort et al., 1991; Collins et al., 1992) . In 2006, a highly pathogenic porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (HP-PRRSV) emerged and prevailed in mainland China, resulting in devastating damage to swine production (Tian et al., 2007) . Currently, HP-PRRSV causes high morbidity and high mortality in infected pigs of all ages and has remained a major threat to the swine producers in China and surrounding countries (Han et al., 2017) . Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), a member of the genus Alpha-coronavirus (Song and Park, 2012) , was first identified in the 1980s in China (Xuan et al., 1984) . PEDV causes a contagious intestinal disease called porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED), which is characterized by vomiting, diarrhea, and dehydration . In October 2010, a large-scale outbreak of PED caused by a PEDV variant occurred in China, resulting in tremendous economic losses (Li et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2013 Wang et al., , 2016 Tian et al., 2014) . PRRSV and PEDV are highly virulent and contagious porcine pathogens that cause respiratory and enteric disease in pigs and result in significant economic losses for the intensive pig production worldwide (Li et al., 2012; Snijder et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2016) .",

The viral proteases involved in polyprotein cleavage are papain-like proteases (PL1pro and PL2pro) and a 3CL serine protease (PRRSV nsp4; 3CLSP)/3C-like (PEDV nsp5; 3CL) protease (Tian et al., 2009; Ye et al., 2016) . During replication, the PL1pro and PL2pro proteases cleave the N-proximal region of pp1a/pp1ab, and the 3CLSP/3CL protease cleaves the viral polyprotein at other conserved inter-domain junctions (Tian et al., 2009; Ye et al., 2016) . The viral 3CLSP/3CL proteases play an essential role in artertivirus and coronavirus replication; therefore, they have received much attention as potential key antiviral targets (including TGEV, FIPV, IBV and SARS-CoV) (Anand et al., 2002; Kim et al., 2013; Lee et al., 2007; Xue et al., 2008) .",

To date, effective broad-spectrum antiviral drugs for PRRSV and PEDV infections are not available, although antiviral compounds have been reported previously (Karuppannan et al., 2012; St John et al., 2016; Evans et al., 2017) . This remains an impediment to identifying new inhibitors that target the PRRSV and PEDV 3CLSP/3CL proteases for use as antiviral therapies during disease epidemics. In this study, our findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying 3CLSP or 3CL protease-mediated inhibition of viral replication and may also guide the development of new broad-spectrum antiviral drugs.",

Therefore, the potential binding sites were analyzed in detail using molecular simulations to dock compounds 2 and 3 into the PRRSV 3CLSP and PEDV 3CL protease structures ( Fig. 5A and B) .

A population size of 150, mutation rate of 0.02, and crossover rate of 0.8 were set as the parameters. Simulations were performed using up to 2.5 million energy evaluations with a maximum of 27,000 generations. Each simulation was performed 100 times, yielding 256 docked conformations.

            "text": "In our experiment, the compounds screening targeting 3CLSP and 3CL protease was used to identify inhibitors that suppress PRRSV and PEDV replication. Meanwhile, to elucidate the binding mechanism of compounds and 3CLSP or 3CL proteases, we simulated the most likely binding conformations using Autodock 4 software. In the 3CLSP and Y. Shi et al. Veterinary Microbiology 213 (2018) 114-122 3CL protease, the S1 specificity pocket is essential for recognition of the side chain of the substrate P1 residue and determination of the enzyme's preference (Tian et al., 2009; Ye et al., 2016) . Hence, the residues of S1 specificity pockets were selected as targets for molecule docking. A total of 256 binding conformations between the ligands and the proteins were obtained, and the lowest energy conformations were used for further analysis. As shown in Fig. 5A and B, compounds 2 and 3 are illustrated as sticks, and the amino acid residues contacting the compounds are shown as lines. Because there is a significant difference in the residues of S1 specificity pockets between PRRSV nsp4 and PEDV nsp5, compounds 2 and 3 were docked into 3CLSP and 3CL protease with different conformations and interactions ( Fig. 5A and B) . Besides, due to the semi-flexible docking was performed, the binding conformations of compounds 2 and 3 with 3CLSP or 3CL protease also exists subtle differences. Nonetheless, their interactions are highly similar ( Fig. 5A and B) . Otherwise, previous studies have shown that the substrate-binding sites and active sites of the 3CLSP and 3CL protease are located between domains I and II in their structures (Tian et al., 2009; Ye et al., 2016) . The amino acid residue His39 in 3CLSP (corresponding to His41 of 3CL protease) plays a vital role in substrate combination and catalysis. Indeed, our docking analysis results suggested that compounds 2 and 3 bind in the substrate channel between domains I and II, which form strongly hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonds with His39 (or His41) (Fig. 5A) . Hence, compounds 2 and 3 would be broad competitive inhibitors and bind in the substratebinding channel of the 3CLSP and 3CL protease, replacing the substrate. Additionally, our results showed that compounds 2 and 3 could effectively inhibit the replication of PRRSV and PEDV at a micromolar range. Unfortunately, their EC 50 values were high (> 50 \u03bcM), and the selectivity index (SI) values were less than 10 (Figs. 3 and 4; Table 1 ). As lead compounds, compounds 2 and 3 have a low molecular weight (< 250 Da) (Table S1 ). Thus, further medicinal chemistry optimization is available to increase the selectivity index and pharmacokinetic properties (DMPK). Moreover, the substrate-binding channel of the 3CLSP or 3CL protease is a large cavity, supplementary studies may need to more accurately characterize the compound-binding sites to Fig. 2 . Effects of compounds 1-5 on the activity of PRRSV 3CLSP in a FRET assay. Enzymatic activity was measured using substrate at 1 \u03bcM and compounds 1-5 at various concentrations (12.5-500 \u03bcM). Percentage of inhibition (%) = 100 \u00d7 [1 \u2212 RFU of the experimental group (60 min-0 min)/RFU of the control group (60 min-0 min)]. IC 50 was determined using GraphPad Prism software 5.

The compounds and amino acid residues contacting the compounds are represented as sticks and lines, respectively (the protease surface transparency is set at 40%). The amino acid residues are colored according to atom type. Moreover, hydrogen bond interactions are shown as black dashed lines between the respective donor and acceptor atoms, along with the bond distance. (B) Docked conformations of compounds 2 and 3 with PEDV nsp5. The compounds and molecular interactions are represented as in A. (C) Sequence relationships between arterivirus 3CLSP and coronavirus 3CL protease. The amino acid sequence of EAV (GenBank: X53459.3) nsp4 was used for sequence relationship analysis. The residue numbers at the top refer to the PRRSV 3CLSP amino acid sequence. The key residues for potential 3CLSP activity sites and substrate binding sites on PRRSV are marked with red arrows at the bottom. The sequences were aligned using ClustalW2, and the alignment was drawn with ESPript 3.0.
