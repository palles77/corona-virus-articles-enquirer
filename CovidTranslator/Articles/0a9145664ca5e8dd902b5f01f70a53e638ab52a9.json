Simplified methods for rapid BRSV diagnosis would encourage sampling during outbreaks and would consequently lead to an extended understanding of the virus. In this study, a BRSV fluorogenic reverse transcription PCR (fRT-PCR) assay, based on TaqMan principle, was developed and evaluated on a large number of clinical samples, representing various cases of natural and experimental BRSV infections. By using a single-step closed-tube format, the turn-around time was shortened drastically and results were obtained with minimal risk for cross-contamination. According to comparative analyses, the detection limit of the fRT-PCR was on the same level as that of a nested PCR and the sensitivity relatively higher than that of a conventional PCR, antigen ELISA (Ag-ELISA) and virus isolation (VI). Interspersed negative control samples, samples from healthy animals and eight symptomatically or genetically related viruses were all negative, confirming a high specificity of the assay. Taken together, the data indicated that the fRT-PCR assay can be applied to routine virus detection in clinical specimens and provides a rapid and valuable tool in BRSV research.",

The infection consists as a part of a disease complex in calves (Stott et al., 1980) , but it also occurs as outbreaks in na\u00efve populations and may be fatal in adults (Elvander, 1996; Inaba et al., 1972) . BRSV has enveloped virions; it possesses a negative sense, single-stranded RNA genome and exists as a single serotype. Genomic phylo-genetic studies have divided isolates into six subgroups with the highest average percentage of sequence divergence in the glycoprotein (G) coding region of the genome (Valarcher et al., 2000) . The fusion (F) protein coding region is less variable and is therefore a more suitable target for the design of diagnostic tests (Eleraky et al., 2003) .",

The period of virus shedding from the point when clinical signs appear is short in infected animals; the virus is labile and therefore difficult to isolate in cell culture (Valarcher et al., 1999; West et al., 1998) . BRSV-specific antibodies in clinical specimens may interfere with virus isolation (VI) and also with direct detection methods based on serological techniques (West et al., 1998) . Furthermore, the usage of indirect detection by serology (BRSV-specific IgG detection) 0166 is hampered by the suppressive effect of maternal antibodies on the humoral response to infection (Kimman et al., 1987) .",

To our knowledge, this is the first report on the development and application of an fRT-PCR system for the direct diagnosis of respiratory diseases caused by BRSV. Although Werling et al. (2002) published recently a BRSV TaqMan PCR assay, their method was developed for research purposes, in order to measure viral mRNA levels in the context of cytokine responses. Our intention was to develop a simple and high throughput fRT-PCR assay and to investigate its diagnostic applicability by testing clinical samples from experimentally and naturally infected animals. Compared to nested PCR, the single-tube fRT-PCR assay has important advantages. By including rTth DNA polymerase, which acts both as a thermoactive reverse transcriptase and a thermostable DNA polymerase, a separate RT step was avoided and the reactions require less than 3 h to complete (from RT reaction to results), compared to 7-8 h for RT and nested PCR. Unlike other protocols, neither the addition of a second enzyme nor an alteration in buffer composition is required between the reverse transcription and the PCR.",

For a numeric quantitation of viral copies, however, simultaneous detection of a house-keeping gene in RNA extractions would be required (Gueudin et al., 2003) .",

In the field data presented above, animals with acute respiratory signs including high fever or dramatically elevated respiratory rates were tested positive, inferring that this type of clinical cases represent a suitable target group for sampling. It should be noted that calves, but not adults, shed detectable levels of BRSV even with mild clinical signs of disease. BRSV was detected in samples obtained 10 days apart from one animal, indicating that the period of possible detection by fRT-PCR is reasonably long during natural BRSV infections in na\u00efve cattle. Nevertheless, to be assured of a reliable herd diagnosis, nasal swabs should be obtained from more than one animal during an outbreak.",

The detection of targets without opening the reaction vessel and combination of reverse transcription with PCR in a single closed-tube format greatly reduces both the risk for cross-contamination of specimens and the detection time. The sensitivity of the fRT-PCR assay was comparable to that of nested PCR and seemed higher than that of VI or Ag-ELISA. Taking in account that nested PCR is laborious and demands several practical steps to reach the final results, fRT-PCR with its single-step performance is a more suitable tool for detection of BRSV. Another advantage is that multiple results can be obtained with minimal effort. In summary, the results described above indicate that the method is sensitive, simple and can be applied to routine diagnosis.",
