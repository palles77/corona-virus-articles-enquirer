            "text": "The coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) directs the synthesis of viral RNA on discrete membranous complexes that are distributed throughout the cell cytoplasm. These putative replication complexes are composed of intimately associated but biochemically distinct membrane populations, each of which contains proteins processed from the replicase (gene 1) polyprotein. Specifically, one membrane population contains the gene 1 proteins p65 and p1a-22, while the other contains the gene 1 proteins p28 and helicase, as well as the structural nucleocapsid (N) protein and newly synthesized viral RNA. In this study, immunofluorescence confocal microscopy was used to define the relationship of the membrane populations comprising the putative replication complexes at different times of infection in MHV-A59-infected delayed brain tumor cells. At 5.5 h postinfection (p.i.) the membranes containing N and helicase colocalized with the membranes containing p1a-22/p65 at foci distinct from sites of M accumulation. By 8 to 12 h p.i., however, the membranes containing helicase and N had a predominantly perinuclear distribution and colocalized with M. In contrast, the p1a-22/p65-containing membranes retained a peripheral, punctate distribution at all times of infection and did not colocalize with M. By late times of infection, helicase, N, and M each also colocalized with ERGIC p53, a specific marker for the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi-intermediate compartment. These data demonstrated that the putative replication complexes separated into component membranes that relocalized during the course of infection. These results suggest that the membrane populations within the MHV replication complex serve distinct functions both in RNA synthesis and in delivery of replication products to sites of virus assembly.",

The less dense membrane population was LAMP-1 (lysosome-associated membrane protein 1) positive and contained the p65 and p1a-22 proteins (Sims et al., 2000) . In contrast, the more dense population contained markers for ER as well as LAMP-1-positive membranes. The dense population was associated with the viral helicase (hel), p28, and nucleocapsid (N) proteins (Sims et al., 2000) . In addition, the hel/p28/N-positive membranes contained almost all of the viral RNA synthesized between 6 and 8 h p.i. Finally, it has been shown that the putative replication com-plexes were almost entirely discrete from sites of M accumulation (Bost et al., 2000) . Together, these data suggested that the putative MHV replication complex is multipartite, composed of closely associated membrane populations containing hel/N/p28/RNA and p1a-22/p65, respectively (Sims et al., 2000) , and that the multipartite complexes were distinct from sites of virion assembly.",

At 5.5 h p.i., foci of N were entirely distinct from sites of M concentration, but by 12 h p.i., N was extensively colocalized with M in perinuclear foci, in a pattern indistinguishable from that with hel and M. The N/M colocalization was observed both in individual cells (data not shown) and in syncytia. Together these results demonstrated that the intact membranous complexes containing hel and N were relocalized to sites of M accumulation.",

In MHV-infected cells, we first demonstrated that p1a-22 and hel colocalized extensively at 5.5 h p.i., a result consistent with our previous studies (Fig. 3B ) (Bost et al., 2000) . When p1a-22 and M were directly compared at 5.5 h p.i., p1a-22 was detected in characteristic punctate cytoplasmic complexes that were completely distinct from the signal for M, typically found in a focused perinuclear pattern (Fig.  3C ). At 12 h p.i., the pattern of p1a-22 with respect to M was unchanged, remaining completely distinct, and in dramatic contrast to the colocalization of hel and N with M at 12 h p.i. The observed separation of p1a-22 from M was not dependent on cell morphology and was not affected by syncytia formation.",

A 100 g/ml concentration of cycloheximide has been previously determined to be sufficient for inhibition of gene 1 translation in coronavirus-infected cells (Kim et al., 1995; Perlman et al., 1987; Sawicki and Sawicki, 1986) . When infected cells were incubated with cycloheximide beginning at 5.5 h p.i. and continuing throughout the remainder of infection, extensive colocalization of hel or N with M was still observed at 12 h p.i.

However, several important areas of the cell biology of replication complex formation and function of positivestrand RNA viruses have remained undefined. One area critical to understanding virus-host interaction during replication is the changes that occur in viral replication complexes over time. This is important since biochemical and physical changes in the replication complexes may correlate with different stages of RNA transcription, replication, encapsidation, or assembly. The second question concerns the relationship of replication complexes to sites of virus assembly in cells. This is a particularly intriguing area since several positive-strand RNA viruses, such as the alphaviruses and flaviviruses, target replication complexes to sites that are distinct from those of virus assembly, raising questions about how newly synthesized RNA is delivered to these sites of assembly. Therefore, understanding the dynamic virushost interactions is critical to a comprehensive understanding of replication.",

The experiments in this study have demonstrated the physical separation of the hel/N and p1a-22/p65 complexes and relocalization of the hel/N complex during the course of infection, thus confirming in a compelling fashion that the MHV replication complexes are composed of physically distinct but closely associated membrane/protein populations.

Since we previously demonstrated that hel, N, p28, and newly synthesized viral RNA segregate to the same membrane population (Sims et al., 2000) , our present study strongly suggests that viral RNA and the p28 protein are also delivered with hel and N to the ERGIC. We have detected MHV RNA metabolically labeled with BrUTP at sites entirely distinct from the p1a-22/p65 complex at 6 to 8 h p.i. (data not shown); however, it has been more difficult to directly show the translocation of newly synthesized genomic RNA. We presume this is because it would require shut-off of all viral RNA synthesis at 5-6 h p.i., tracking of RNA synthesized before inhibition of RNA synthesis, and stability of RNA over a 3-to 6-h period. Further, it has been reported that viral nucleocapsids are rapidly incorporated into virions and exported from the cell, so that localizing amounts of RNA necessary for detection at late times may be difficult. We are currently using a combination of metabolic labeling, RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization, and immuno-EM approaches to investigate the specific association of genomic RNA with the hel/N complex, as well as the predicted translocation of viral nucleocapsids for assembly over time.",

The separation and translocation observed may therefore be the result of viral or cellular processes or signals that are already under way prior to inhibition of viral protein or RNA synthesis. This is a reasonable possibility since MHV RNA synthesis also begins to decline by 6-8 h p.i. in untreated cells (Kim et al., 1995) .

            "text": "Another question that has arisen from our experiments is the mechanism of translocation of the hel/N complexes. We have previously reported that the membranes with which hel, N, RNA, and p28 segregate contain enzymatic activity found in membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (NADPH-cytochrome C reductase) (Sims et al., 2000) . If the ER is the sole or major membrane component of hel/N complexes, then \"normal\" ER-to-ERGIC trafficking pathways would provide an established mechanism that MHV might exploit to deliver replication products to sites of assembly. It is interesting that the presence of distributed punctate ERGIC or \"ER exit sites\" has been recently described (Rossanese et al., 1999) and that the pattern of expression of these sites is reminiscent of the MHV replication complexes at 5 to 6 h p.i. (Bost et al., 2000; Shi et al., 1999; van der Meer et al., 1999) . ER-to-ERGIC movement appears to be an ongoing process of migration of ER \"packets\" along microtubular highways in normal cells except in the presence of specific inhibitors (Thyberg and Moskalewski, 1999) . Thus the temporal change in hel/N complex association with the p1a-22/p65 complex and the rather specific transition to separation and translocation suggest a regulated process. Since new virus is detected in the supernatant medium of MHV-infected DBT cells before the change in hel/N complex localization is observed, it is likely that translocation of smaller packets of hel/N complexes is occurring earlier than 6 h p.i. The prominent alteration in hel/N complex localization detected in this study may represent a more comprehensive transition from replication to assembly.",

There is no precedent for direct trafficking from endosomes to ERGIC; rather it is thought that endosome-to-ER trafficking occurs via retrograde movement through the Golgi. Specifically, Rab 9-mediated movement from endosomes to the trans-Golgi network (TGN) results in fusion of endosomes with the TGN (Lombardi et al., 1993) . The endosome cargo is then available for movement by retrograde transport mechanisms from the TGN to the ERGIC (White et al., 1999) . Identification of the membranes in the hel/N complex will be useful as a basis for investigating specific pathways of cellular transport.",

In addition to serving as a potential mechanism for delivery of newly synthesized RNA, hel/N migration could serve as a retention signal for M in the ERGIC. Narayanan et al. (2000) have recently reported specific M-N interactions at 8 h p.i. in a pre-Golgi compartment; however, they were unable to re-create this interaction in cells overexpressing M and N. They speculated that a MHV-specific action is required for this interaction (Narayanan et al., 2000) . Our experiments would support the conclusion that the missing MHV action is the translocation of the hel/N complex. Additionally, it was reported that N was associated with all genomic and subgenomic RNA species, but only N in association with genome length RNA was able to be coimmunoprecipitated with M (Narayanan et al., 2000) . Thus hel/N complex translocation provides an attractive model for regulation of packaging of complete viral nucleocapsids.",

            "text": "The events between coronavirus entry and assembly appear to involve a dynamic process of changing protein/membrane interactions. Based on our data, we propose a model in which virus-cell interactions may be divided into temporally distinct stages (Fig. 6 ). The early stage (0 to 6 h p.i.) is characterized by gene 1 replicase protein expression, maturation, and targeting to biochemically separate but intimately associated membrane populations in discrete foci within the cell cytoplasm. These interacting membrane populations are sites for viral RNA synthesis, with the timing of maximal detection of the interacting membrane/protein complexes corresponding to times of maximal viral RNA synthesis. During this stage, newly synthesized viral RNA associates specifically with the membrane population containing hel, N, and p28 (Bost et al., 2000; Kim et al., 1995; Shi et al., 1999; . Finally, during the early stage, M protein can be detected in perinuclear and cytoplasmic foci discrete from the putative replication complexes. During the intermediate stage (6 to 8 h p.i.), the translocation of hel/N complexes to the ERGIC is first observed. The late stage (8 to 12 h p.i.) is characterized by extensive separation of the hel/N complexes from the p1a-22/p65 complexes and colocalization of hel/N complexes with the ERGIC and M. This late stage is temporally associated with decreasing rates of new viral RNA synthesis and maximal rates of new virus production. We speculate that these temporal associations are not coincidental but rather reflect specific transitions in the virus life cycle from replication to assembly. This would further indicate that the association of p1a-22/p65 complexes with hel/N complexes is required for RNA synthesis and that the separation and translocation of the hel/N complexes result in both shutoff of RNA synthesis and delivery of viral nucleocapsids to sites of virion budding.",
