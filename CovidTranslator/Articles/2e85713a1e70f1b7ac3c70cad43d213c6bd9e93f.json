Objective: To determine whether there is a relation between the serostatus of 13 different viruses and parentally reported infections and IgE sensitization in 2-year-old children. To investigate whether there is an interaction between cytomegalovirus (CMV) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) in relation to IgE sensitization. Methods: A total of 246 infants were followed prospectively to 2 years of age with clinical examinations, skin prick test, and specific IgE analyses and through analysis of seropositivity against adenovirus, influenza, parainfluenza, respiratory syncytial virus, CMV, EBV, herpes simplex virus, human herpesvirus 6, and varicella-zoster virus. Results: There was some evidence that IgE sensitization (24%) tended to be more common among children who were seropositive against few compared with children who were seropositive against many viruses, but this was not statistically significant, and there was no consistent trend across the groups. IgE sensitization was statistically significantly less prevalent at 2 years of age among infants who were seropositive against EBV but not other viruses (adjusted odds ratio, 0.34; 95% CI, 0.14-0.86). The interaction of seropositivity against both CMV and EBV antibodies indicated a further reduction in the risk for IgE sensitization (adjusted odds ratio for interaction, 0.10; 95% CI, 0.01-0.92), indicating effect modification associated with seropositivity against CMV. Conclusion: Our results indicate that acquisition of EBV infection during the first 2 years of life is associated with a reduced risk of IgE sensitization, and this effect is enhanced by CMV coinfection.

The study was also designed to investigate the association of IgE sensitization with infectious burden measured as seroprevalence against 13 different viruses, including CMV, EBV, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), as well as parentally reported infections.",

Again, the characteristics of infection may be important, and identification through hospitalization suggests more severe acute infection than the majority of children in our study would have had.

Because we selected children with different family histories of allergy, we believe that the group of children in our study is fairly comparable with children in the general population. Furthermore, the exact sensitivity for seropositivity in some of the assays used to evaluate the respiratory infections is not fully known because they have been used mainly to detect ongoing infections, so the rate of seropositivity is somewhat underestimated, but this should not introduce bias. The optimal approach would have been to perform neutralization assays, but serum samples from infants are inevitably insufficient for tests using low serum dilutions. In contrast, the sensitivity and specificity for seropositivity of the assays used for the herpesvirus infections have been proven reliable, as best demonstrated by the correlation between initial serostatus and clinical outcome found in transplant recipients. 31 It could also be argued that analyzing 13 different viruses could produce some associations with IgE sensitization by chance. However, because an association specifically with EBV was evaluated as a result of an a priori hypothesis based on the results of previous studies, 14 the associations reported for EBV are unlikely to be caused by chance.",

Development of more precise measures of patterns of acute infection and their immunological sequel will assist in our understanding of how early in life viral infections are implicated in the etiology of IgE sensitization.",
