Replication of the helper virus is usually reduced by the replication of the defective RNAs (defective interfering RNAs, Dls) . However, this is a characteristic that primarily is associated with RNA viruses of animals . Although most plant viruses have RNA genomes, a striking feature of these viruses is a general lack of Dls . Only the tombusvirus and carmovirus groups have been found to generate Dls (Hillman et al., 1987 ; Burgyan et al., 1989 ; Li et al., 1989) . However, many RNA plant virus groups do support a different type of dependent replicon : satellite viruses and satellite RNAs . In contrast to Dls, these dependent RNAs have little or no sequence similarity with the helper virus and do not appear to originate from the helper genome (Francki, 1985) .",

Amplification of other small TMV-related RNAs, such as subgenomic mRNAs or fragmented TMV RNAs, which would lack either or both termini, was prevented using these primers . All primer sets, along with the PCR reagents, were always run without any DNA template and none of these control reactions produced any DNA that was detected by electrophoretic analysis in nondenaturing agarose gels (Fig . 5C , lane 1) . Although these primers would also bind to the wild type TMV genomic cDNA, short polymerization times were designed to favor the amplification of smaller DNAs . When cDNA of TMV 204 RNA was used as the template for the PCR reaction, essentially no DNA was detected (Fig . 5C , lane 2) . When cDNA of KKL TMV RNA was amplified by this assay, a heterogeneous pattern, ranging in size from 300 to 2200 bp, with a concentration of bands between 900 and 2200 bp, was observed (Fig . 5C, lane 3) . The 2161-bp standard was the PCR product obtained when cDNA of DNase treated in vitro transcripts of pTMV-KKL were used (shown as the marker to the left of lane 3) . Some of the progeny RNAs of the KKLJTMV infection were the size of the original transcript, but many of the progeny RNAs were smaller.",

One, a procedural modification was to reduce the time of propagation of the dependent RNA . Progeny virions were isolated from the upper leaves of the first plants inoculated . The second modification was to alter the sequences contained within the replicon . One factor now known to greatly affect the stability of sequences within the TMV genome became evident as this work was being done . Directly repeated sequences facilitate the loss of sequences between the repeats if they are not required for the replication of the virus . For example, TMV mutants with additional copies of the coat protein (Beck and Dawson, 1990) , 30-kDa (Lehto and Dawson, 1990) ORFs, or the coat protein subgenomic mRNA promoter region (Dawson et at, 1989) quickly lost the repeats and the intervening sequences upon replication . Thus, the second RNA replicon examined, KL, did not have directly repeated sequences, while the majority of the 126/183-kDa ORF and the 5' half of the 30-kDa ORF (4979 nts) were removed (Fig . 1C) . The 3' half of the 30-kDa ORF, containing the origin of assembly and the subgenomic promoter for the coat protein, was ligated to the 5' 258 nts of TMV resulting in a 1417-nt RNA . The coat protein ORF and the full 3' untranslated region were not changed .",

As in the KKUTMV infection, no significant change in symptomology was observed, compared to plants infected with only TMV 204 . An examination of several electron micrographs suggested that virions from KL/TMV-infected tissue consisted of full-length virions and a heterogeneous population of small virions (Fig . 3C) , which seemed to be less heterogeneous than that observed for the KKUTMV virions (Fig . 3B) . Sucrose gradient profiles of TMV 204 virions resulted in, predominantly, a single peak, while a KUTMV virion profile contained two peaks, essentially as shown for KKUTMV virions (Fig . 2) . A comparison of the relative yields of full-length virions of KUTMV compared to that of TMV 204 alone demonstrated that the support of the defective KL population by the helper, TMV 204, resulted in little or no significant reduction of helper virus yields . In two experiments, the total yield of virions from KKL/TMV-infected leaves was 3 .4 and 4 .3 mg/g fresh weight compared to the yield of virus from TMV 204-infected leaves of 2 .7 and 3 .7 mg/g fresh weight, respectively .",

In most virus-plant associations in which a dependent RNA replicates with the helper virus, the symptoms produced by the virus are also altered . However, neither of the TMV-dependent RNAs that we examined had a noticeable effect on symptoms caused byTMV in tobacco .

This heterogeneity was similar to that described for naturally produced DIs originating from genomic RNAs in numerous virus systems (Kaariainenetal., 1981 ; Jennings etal., 1983 ; Barrettet al., 1984 ; Makino et aL, 1985 ; Kuge et al., 1986 ; Hillman etal., 1987 ; Li etal., 1989) . Sequence analyses of PCR DNA and cDNA clones of the progeny of KL demonstrated that the 5' terminus and a large 3' region, containing the origin of assembly, coat protein subgenomic mRNA promoter, coat protein ORF, and the untranslated 3' end generally were retained, whereas various deletions and occasionally insertions occurred at the original deletion junction . It is possible that replication of mutant transcripts KKL and KL through a single cycle in protoplasts would have resulted in a more homogeneous progeny, as has been demonstrated with bromoviruses (French and Ahlquist, 1987 ; Pacha et at, 1990 ; Pogue et al., 1990) . However, forcing the TMV subgenomic replicon to propagate in intact plants not only required efficient replication, but efficient encapsidation, cell-to-cell movement, and long-distance movement. Because of the probable requirement of encapsidation for efficient long-distance movement (Sanger, 1968 ; Siegel et al., 1962; Dawson et aL, 1988) , our sampling of progeny RNAs was probably prejudiced by our isolation from systemically infected tissue . The heterogeneity observed in the progeny population probably reflects multiple selection pressures resulting from the in p/anta propagation. Some of the sequences retained in these progeny RNAs are cisacting elements required for replication and/or encapsidation . While other sequences might not be absolutely required, they may enhance efficient replication or movement .",

Mutants with the 30-kDa and/or the coat protein ORFs deleted retain the ability to replicate Taka-matsu etat, 1987 ; Dawson etal., 1988) . Also, the virus will replicate with deletion of one of the three (Dawson et al., 1988) or even two of the three (Takamatsu et al., 1990) pseudoknots found in the TMV 3' untranslated region between the coat protein ORF and the tRNA-like region (Van Belkum et al., 1985) . At the 5' end, the terminal 8 nts and nts 48-61 have been found to be required for replication of genomic TMV . However, the experiments reported here with the dependent RNAs measure different requirements . The dependent RNAs were replicated in trans without a requirement for gene expression, butwith the requirement to compete with the wild type population during systemic infection of the plant . These experiments suggest that little 5' sequence is required because some of the progeny RNAs retained less than 100 nt of the 5' end (11 of 30 cDNA clones) with one having only the 5' 23 nts . Even though TMV mutants with deletions in the coat protein ORF and the untranslated 3' end retain the ability to replicate, virtually all of the modified progeny of KL retained a large area of the 3' region unmodified . This might suggest that for a TMV-based replicon to replicate and spread efficiently in tobacco little modification of this region can be tolerated . Other mutants of TMV that we have examined with insertions that separated the coat protein ORF from the 3' untranslated region have replicated much more poorly than similar mutants with the same insertions between the 30-kDa and coat protein ORFs (Dawson et aL, 1989 ; Beck and Dawson, 1990 ; Lehto and Dawson, 1990) . For competitive replication and invasion of intact plants, the requirements of a TMV-based RNA appear to be cis-acting sequences which apparently consist of less than 100 5' nt, but perhaps a large 3' region containing considerably more than the negative-sense strand promoter and the origin of assembly .",

Two types of copy-choice strand switching have been proposed to explain recombination and production of Dls in viral systems (for reviews, see Lazzarinietal., 1981 ; King, 1988) . In homologous recombination, restart is favored by the nascent RNA finding complementary or near-complementary sequences, which would preferentially favor restart at the same sequence within the genome from which the replicase complex dissociated, although not necessarily on the same template molecule. Alternatively, heterologous recombination does not require complementary binding between nascent chain and template chain upon replication restart which can therefore occur at various positions . The deletion of sequences from the TMV dependent RNAs could be the result of the replicase complexes restarting at alternative areas on a dependent RNA or switching to a different dependent RNA, as is thought to occur in the generation of natural Dl populations . The addition of sequences that were not part of the original KL transcript, but were contained in the helper genome, could have resulted from the TMV replicase first producing a nascent chain using the helper as a template and then changing templates to a dependent RNA template .",
