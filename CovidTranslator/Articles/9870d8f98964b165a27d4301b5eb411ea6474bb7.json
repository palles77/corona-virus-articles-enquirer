Chemokines and adhesion molecules orchestrate leukocyte transmigration across the blood-brain barrier (BBB), but the dynamics of chemokine receptor expression during leukocyte transmigration are unclear. We describe an in vitro BBB model system using human brain microvascular endothelial cells that incorporates shear forces mimicking blood flow to elucidate how chemokine receptor expression is modulated during leukocyte transmigration. In the presence of the chemokine CXCL12, we examined modulation of its receptor CXCR4 on human T cells, B cells, and monocytes transmigrating across the BBB under flow conditions. CXCL12 stimulated transmigration of CD4 + and CD8 + T cells, CD19 + B cells, and CD14 + monocytes. Transmigration was blocked by CXCR4-neutralizing antibodies. Unexpectedly, CXCL12 selectively down-regulated CXCR4 on transmigrating monocytes, but not T cells. Monocytes underwent preferential CXCL12-mediated adhesion to the BBB in vitro compared with lymphocytes. These findings provide new insights into leukocyte-endothelial interactions at the BBB under conditions mimicking blood flow and suggest that in vitro BBB models may be useful for identifying chemokine receptors that could be modulated therapeutically to reduce neuroinflammation in diseases such as MS.",

Inflammation initiates the lesions of MS and involves accumulation of blood-derived inflammatory cells in the CNS parenchyma. The inflammatory molecular cascade that leads to CNS tissue infiltration by blood-derived leuko-cytes has been progressively elucidated. This research has led to the hypothesis that leukocytes often initially transmigrate through the blood-brain barrier (BBB) via pial vessels (1, 2) located at the surface of the brain and spinal cord. Pial vessels exhibit interendothelial tight junctions that are characteristic of the BBB. However, being outside the brain parenchyma, pial vessels are not associated with astrocyte end-feet (3) . Other sites where leukocytes enter the CNS include the choroid plexus and the BBB within the brain parenchyma (4) .",

However, available therapies that inhibit leukocyte trafficking by blocking adhesion molecules carry substantial risks (10) , probably related to their action against a wide spectrum of leukocyte populations. More selective means to abrogate leukocyte entry into the CNS of patients with neuroinflammatory diseases such as MS are needed (11) .

            "text": "Immunohistochemical staining of MS lesions for chemokines and chemokine receptors is an attractive way to initiate studies of leukocyte infiltration of the CNS. However, the complexity of leukocyte transmigration and chemokine receptor modulation challenges the use of immunohistochemical data as a stand-alone means for identifying the best targets for inhibition. This complexity is evident at multiple levels: Chemokine receptors expressed by leukocytes recognize ligand on both the luminal and the abluminal surface of endothelial cells during transmigration into tissue from the flowing blood (12) . After ligand exposure, chemokine receptors can be down-regulated and degraded or recycled at different rates (13, 14) , resulting in either the absence or the presence of the receptor on migrating cells. Chemokine receptors on defined cell populations (such as na\u00efve monocytes or memory T cells) differ markedly when circulating cells are compared with tissue-infiltrating cells, suggesting dynamic regulation. For example, very few CCR2-positive mononuclear inflammatory cells have been identified in MS lesions by immunohistochemistry compared to >95% of monocytes expressing variable levels of CCR2 in peripheral blood (15) . CCL2 immunoreactivity is abundant in active and chronic MS lesions despite decreased CCL2 in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of MS patients, suggesting that ligand (CCL2) might be consumed as its receptor (CCR2) is down-regulated (16) . CCR5 + monocytes arrayed in the perivascular spaces around microvessels in MS tissue (an inflammatory finding termed \"perivascular cuffing\") comprise more than 50% of infiltrating myeloid cells, although less than 15% of blood monocytes express CCR5 (8, 17) . Among CXC chemokines, CXCL12 ligand is particularly associated with leukocyte infiltration of the CNS, and regulation of its receptor CXCR4 is complex. CXCL12 is expressed in several cellular contexts in the CNS (18) (19) (20) . Neuropathological studies have demonstrated that CXCL12 immunoreactivity is associated with endothelial cells within microvessels in control autopsy human brain sections and exhibits basolateral (abluminal) localization (20) , where it serves to restrict the transit of infiltrating leukocytes from perivascular cuffs into the parenchyma (20) (21) (22) . During CNS inflammation, this polarized expression is altered with loss of perivascular CXCL12 protein and relocation of this chemokine to the luminal side of the vasculature (20) (21) (22) . CXCR4 and CXCR7, the two receptors that bind to CXCL12, play complementary roles in its function. These receptors belong to a subfamily of heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding protein (G protein)-coupled receptors (GPCRs): CXCR4 ligation triggers G\u03b1 i signaling, whereas CXCR7 is not G protein-linked in most cells (23) (24) (25) (26) and often serves to localize CXCL12 in tissues by internalization or translocation. Studies using knockout mice or small-molecule inhibitors (21, 22) indicate that chemokines and their receptors are crucial for selective infiltration of the CNS by subpopulations of leukocytes (27) (28) (29) (30) . Analyses of chemokines and chemokine receptors in MS lesions, when complemented by mechanistic in vitro transmigration studies to define how individual receptors are regulated on relevant cells, are the best approach for guiding therapeutic development.",

Transfected human brain microvascular endothelial cells (THBMECs) are stable in culture and have BBB features including intercellular tight junction-associated protein expression, modestly elevated transendothelial electrical resistance (compared with HUVECs), and efficient solute exclusion (15, 37, 38) . Under physiological flow rates and cytokine cocktail treatments, THBMECs maintain their BBB characteristics (6) . Using THBMECs in a modified chemotaxis chamber incorporating shear forces, we assayed how the CXCL12 chemokine andits CXCR4 receptor govern leukocyte transmigration under flow conditions, and also defined how CXCR4 expression on leukocytes is modulated during chemokine binding and leukocyte transmigration across the BBB.",

            "text": "The chemotaxis chamber (see Fig. 1 ) was modified from a Neuro Probe AA12 chemotaxis chamber to enable assays to be conducted under physiological shear forces (flow). The chamber comprises a precision-machined acrylic top, middle, and bottom plates, assembly hardware, a silicone top gasket with a flow area of 16 mm wide, 75 mm long, and 0.8 mm thick, and a silicone bottom gasket (Fig. 1 ). The plates have 12 wells in two offset rows. Each well in the middle plate is 6.5 mm in diameter and holds 220 \u03bcl. Framed polycarbonate membrane filters were manufactured by Neuro Probe to our specifications with a pore size of 3 \u03bcm. THBMECs were cultured on rat-tail collagen-coated framed filters to subconfluence and were activated with tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) (10 U/ml) and interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3) (20 U/ml) for 24 hours at 37\u00b0C. The cells were then termed activated THBMECs (aTHBMECs). Transendothelial migration (TEM) buffer containing CXCL12 (25 ng/ml) was incubated with aTHBMECs for 10 min at 37\u00b0C. Excess CXCL12 was removed by two washes, and CXCL12 associated with the human endothelial cells was termed apical CXCL12. Another chemokine, CCL2, is abundant in MS lesions (16) . To simulate inflammatory conditions and create a chemotactic environment, we loaded CCL2 (25 ng/ml) in TEM buffer in the lower chamber on the abluminal side of the THBMECs (termed basolateral CCL2). Basolateral CCL2 was used in all of the transmigration studies including basal migration where CXCL12 was omitted, with the exception of pertussis toxin (PTX) pretreatment experiments where basolateral CCL2 was not used to study direct activation of CXCR4 by CXCL12. The membrane with a confluent layer of aTHBMECs was washed twice with TEM buffer and placed between the top and the bottom plates, and the top gasket was positioned over the filter to create a flow area of about 420 \u03bcl. Narrow raised rims of bottom wells mating the membrane frame enhanced the seal. With the apparatus in a 37\u00b0C incubator, human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were perfused across the THBMECs by a Medfusion 3010a pump through the inlet on the top plate. The wall shear stress (\u03c4 w ) is related to the volumetric flow rate (Q) by \u03c4 w = 6 \u03bcQ/wh 2 , where \u03bc is the fluid viscosity, h is height, and w is width of the flow field (39) . The flow rate was 1 ml/s (46 ml/hour), simulating the estimated flow rate in human cerebral capillaries (40) . The final shear stress was 0.2 dyne/cm 2 . At the end of a defined period of flow, the chamber was disassembled and the framed filter was carefully removed. The cells that had transmigrated across the THBMEC layer were collected from the lower chamber. Flow-through nonmigrating cells were collected from the outlet tubing. Cells that were introduced into the system (termed input cells), migrating cells, and flow-through cells were harvested for quantification and flow cytometry analysis. Chamber calibration was performed every 6 months. Gaskets were replaced regularly to minimize systematic error.",

Addition of CXCL12 to the top chamber on the apical side of the aTHBMEC layer enhanced PBMC migration compared to aTHBMECs without CXCL12 even though we included CCL2 basolaterally (Fig. 2B ). Incubating PBMCs with the anti-CXCR4 antibody 12G5 before the transmigration assay abrogated CXCL12-induced transmigration of immune cells across the aTHBMEC layer (Fig. 2C ). In contrast, CXCL12-induced migration was not affected by preincubating PBMCs with the anti-CXCR7 antibody 11G8 (Fig. 2D ). It is well established that PTX inhibits G\u03b1 i signaling by adenosine diphosphate (ADP) ribosylation. CXCL12-induced migration of PBMCs was inhibited by preincubating PBMCs with PTX ( Fig. 2E ), indicating that apical CXCL12 stimulated PBMC migration by activating G\u03b1 i signaling via CXCR4 receptors.",

The reduction in CXCR4 MFI on a logarithmic scale was demonstrated in single-channel histograms from flow cytometry analyses, which showed a substantial left shift in CD14 + monocyte CXCR4 intensity during apical CXCL12-induced migration, which was not observed for T or B cells (Fig. 3B ). In contrast, when PBMCs were incubated in solution with CXCL12, CXCR4 MFI was reduced on all PBMC subtypes (Fig. 3 , C and D), confirming that CXCR4 was capable of being down-modulated by stimulation with the CXCL12 ligand on all PBMC subpopulations. CXCR4 was down-regulated on transmigrating CD14 + /CD16 \u2212 monocytes (Fig. 3E ) compared to CD16 + /CD14 \u2212 natural killer (NK) cells (Fig. 3F ). To confirm that CXCL12 was associated with the THBMEC surface, we performed live-cell staining. Apical CXCL12 formed larger and more numerous apparent aggregates on aTHBMECs (Fig. 4 , B and D) compared to the staining on aTHBMECs without exogenous CXCL12 (Fig. 4 , A and C). These studies were not performed under flow conditions, because cells were cultured and imaged on coverslips. Tissue staining of luminal CXCL12 in tissue sections also shows punctate staining consistent with aggregation (20) . In summary, the presence of apical CXCL12 in the top chamber induced PBMC transmigration across the aTHBMEC layer and selectively down-regulated CXCR4 expression on monocytes.",

Under flow conditions and in response to CXCL12, monocytes in PBMCs seemed to interact more efficiently with endothelium than did PBMC lymphocytes. This possibility was addressed by parallel plate adhesion assays in which lymphocytes and monocytes were individually isolated by negative selection, differentially labeled with CellTracker dyes, and mixed at a ratio of 4:1 (the ratio normally found in PBMCs). Images at the beginning (Fig. 5D ) and at the end (Fig.  5E ) of the 20-min assay showed that monocytes (yellow) disproportionately adhered to aTHBMECs compared with lymphocytes (magenta). Individual cell motion was further analyzed from a video recording of the adhesion assay (movie S1). Analysis of four experiments showed that monocytes adhered about four times more frequently than did lymphocytes in a 20-min adhesion assay (17 versus 4, P = 0.02) despite their lower numbers in the input cell inoculum (Fig. 5F ). These observations also excluded the possibility that CCL2 (present in transmigration assays but not in the adhesion assays) was required for the preferential response of monocytes to CXCL12 under flow. The focal plane for these videos was set at the endothelial surface and also demonstrated more nonadherent, reversible monocyte-endothelial interactions.",

Next, we showed that the chemokine CXCL12 stimulated lymphocyte and monocyte transmigration across the BBB endothelium. However, CXCL12 induced selective down-regulation of CXCR4 expression by monocytes but not by T and B lymphocytes, which nonetheless expressed functional CXCR4.

The complex molecular mechanisms underlying CXCL12 tissue distribution during neuroinflammation are incompletely understood. Chemokines on endothelial luminal surfaces stimulate leukocyte integrin activation, adhesion, and transmigration of leukocytes across the endothelial layer (48) (49) (50) (51) , whereas chemokines on the abluminal side of the endothelial layer may organize and maintain perivascular leukocyte aggregates (20, 22, 52) . Endothelial cell surface glycosaminoglycans immobilize chemokines, typically in oligomers, and enhance their local availability to rolling and crawling leukocytes (53) (54) (55) . Our live-cell imaging showed apparent CXCL12 aggregates on apical aspects of the cytokine-activated THBMEC layer in vitro that mimics the BBB. CXCL12 distribution is also affected by CXCR7, a nontraditional receptor specific for CXCL11 and CXCL12 that lacks G protein-coupled signaling but internalizes CXCL12 for either lysosomal degradation or transcytosis and redistribution (56, 57) . CXCR7 was not present on monocytes or T cells, and CXCR7-mediated transcytosis was not relevant for our model because CXCL12 was available on the apical surface of the THBMECs, corresponding to the vascular lumen.",

Unexpectedly, we found that CXCR4 was selectively down-regulated on monocytes but not lymphocytes during CXCL12-stimulated transmigration of PBMCs across the BBB in our in vitro model system, implying that monocytes selectively use CXCL12/CXCR4 to generate integrin-dependent interactions with BBB endothelium under flow. There are ample precedents for selective cell-specific responses to CXCL12 via CXCR4. For example, signaling to CXCR4 modulates adult hippocampal neural stem cell proliferation, which is primarily governed by \u03b3-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor stimulation (58) . In contrast, cerebellar granule cell progenitors migrate along a band of CXCL12 at the pial surface and subsequently proliferate through a synergistic response to CXCL12 and sonic hedgehog (59) . Quite differently, CXCR4 signaling activated by CXCL12 governs B lymphocyte retention in bone marrow during development (60) . Illustrating selective signaling by chemokines to receptor-bearing cells, we previously reported that CX3CR1 is broadly expressed on blood lymphocytes and monocytes but only signals to NK cells for recruitment to the CNS in the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) mouse model of MS, despite free CX3CL1 ligand that was available for signaling to other receptor-bearing cells (30) . In separate studies of PBMC migration in vitro under flow, we found that abluminal CCL2 induced lymphocyte and monocyte migration but selectively down-regulated monocyte CCR2. This finding was in agreement with our previous report that infiltrating monocytes in MS lesions lack surface CCR2 (15) .",

This selective response might be dictated in part by the physical state of the immobilized chemokine. A mutant obligate monomer CCL2 peptide that is unable to oligomerize could readily induce chemotaxis of monocytes in a Transwell chamber assay, but was not able to attract monocytes into the inflamed CNS in EAE mice (61) . Mutant CCL5, which was not able to bind to glycosaminoglycans, also activated signaling in solution but was unable to mediate leukocyte recruitment in vivo (61) . Our live-cell imaging analyses suggested that CXCL12 formed aggregates on the apical surface of aTHBMECs. We speculate that CXCL12-mediated differential signaling to monocytes but not lymphocytes under flow was contingent on the \"presentation\" of CXCL12 on the apical surface of aTHBMECs, possibly in the form of oligomeric aggregates. Notably, structural modeling has demonstrated how chemokine polymers could be assembled on tissue surfaces (62) .",

These data suggested that monocytes were induced by CXCL12 to promote lymphocyte transmigration. All PBMC subtypes failed to transmigrate under basal conditions in the absence of CXCL12. Several possibilities exist to account for these observations: First, adherent monocytes might interact physically with lymphocytes, \"trapping\" them before transmigration. Our imaging studies argue against this possibility because monocytes and lymphocytes did not form evident physical contacts (movie S1). Second, monocytes could potentially elaborate cytokines or proteolytic enzymes such as matrix metalloproteinases or cathepsins that might expose ligands mediating adhesion and thereby modify THBMECs to become more permissive for interaction with lymphocytes. CXCL12 might trigger monocytes to secrete chemokines that directly induce lymphocyte adhesion to THBMECs. Physical interaction between adherent monocytes and endothelial cell apical surfaces might induce THBMEC alterations that enhance lymphocyte adhesion. We note that these possibilities are not mutually exclusive given the array of effector properties expressed by monocytes and the complex, stepwise character of leukocyte-endothelial interactions under flow.",
