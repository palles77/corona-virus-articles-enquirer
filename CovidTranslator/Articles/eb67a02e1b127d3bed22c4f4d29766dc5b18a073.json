SARS has caused an outbreak in the world during 2003 and 2004, with 8098 individuals being infected and a death toll of 774 in 28 regions around the world. Specific humoral responses to viral infection remain unclear. Objective: To analyse the antigenicity of the SARS-CoV genome and identify potential antigenic epitopes in the structural proteins. Methods: Potential antigenic epitopes were identified in the structural proteins (nucleocapsid, membrane, spike, and small envelope proteins) and hypothetical proteins (SARS3a, 3b, 6, 7a, and 9b) that are specific for SARS-CoV. A peptide chip platform was created and the profiles of antibodies to these epitopes were investigated in 59 different SARS patients' sera obtained 6-103 days after the onset of the illness. Serial sera from five additional patients were also studied. Results: Epitopes at the N-terminus of the membrane protein and the C-terminus of nucleocapsid protein elicited strong antibody responses. Epitopes on the spike protein were only moderately immunogenic but the effects were persistent. Antibodies were also detected for some putative proteins, noticeably the Ctermini of SARS3a and SARS6.",

In this epidemic, 8098 individuals were being infected, with a cumulative mortality of 9.2%. 1 The clinical and pathological features of SARS have been studied extensively. [2] [3] [4] The specific humoral responses against each of the proteins of the causative agent of SARSa new coronavirus (SARS-CoV)-are, however, poorly understood. 5 The SARS-CoV is an enveloped positive stranded RNA virus. 6 7 The viral genome is ,29.7 kb long and contains 14 open reading frames (ORFs). At the 59 end of the genome, two large ORFs encoding replication proteins are present. These two proteins have relatively higher homology to the other members of the coronavirus. At the 39 end, there are genes for structural proteins (envelope, membrane, nucleocapsid, and spike) as well as the other hypothetical proteins. This latter group of hypothetical proteins has no similarity to any known mammalian or viral proteins and may be specific target for treatment or vaccine developments. 8 In this study, we analysed the 39 end of the SARS-CoV genome and identified some specific, unique, and potentially antigenic sites of sizes ,20 amino acids on each of the structural and hypothetical proteins. Using a peptide chip platform, we determined the antibody profiles against these peptides in the sera of 59 SARS patients at different time points.",

Only one serum was used if multiple specimens were obtained from the same patient on one single day. All these patients were treated with the steroid regime developed at the time of the epidemic. 4 Antigenic peptides in the SARS-CoV genome Antigenicities of epitopes on putative ORF of the SARS-CoV (Genbank Accession No: NC_004718) were evaluated in silico using Clone Manager 5 (Scientific & Educational Software, Cary, North Carolina, USA), Peptide Companion (CSPS Pharmaceuticals Inc, San Diego, California, USA), and DS Gene (Accelrys, San Diego, California, USA), with the following criteria: protein homology and redundant sequences (mostly BLASTing against human and mouse sequences from RefSeq in GenBank); protein hydrophilicity; protein flexibility; protein structure-B-turn, b-sheet, and ahelix; solvent accessibility; charge balance; protein stability; instability index; protein modification; amino acid composition; and peptide synthesis rules for coupling efficiency. These peptides were then compared with other published data of coronavirus (CoV) such as human group 1 and group 2 CoV, bovine-CoV, porcine-CoV, feline-CoV, and canine-CoV, and only SARS-CoV specific sequences were selected. The genomic locations and sequences of the peptides selected are shown in fig 1 and table 1 , respectively.",

Negative controls were 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and 1 mg/ml KLH. The optimum concentration for each peptide (table 1) was determined empirically using serial diluted conjugated peptide from 1 mg/ml to 0.2 mg/ml. Diluted test serum (30 ml, 1/50 in blocking buffer) was incubated for 90 minutes at 37\u02daC on peptide chip blocked with 5% non-fat milk, 0.1% Tween-20 in 20 mM Tris-buffer saline, pH 7.6 for one hour at 37\u02daC. After washing three times with 100 ml TBS buffer (20 mM Tris, pH 7.6), the reactions were then labelled simultaneously with Alexa 546 goat anti-human IgG (1/500 dilution in blocking buffer) and Alexa 647 goat anti-human IgM (1/5000 dilution in blocking buffer) for 30 minutes at 37\u02daC. Fluorescence images were acquired using laser scanner SA5000 coupled with ScanArray software (Perkin Elmer, Norwalk, Connecticut, USA) and QuantArray software (Perkin Elmer). Data between experiments were analysed after signal normalisation with those of normal control samples and negative controls. Data analysis, modelling, and visualisation were undertaken using ''Avadis'' software (Strand Genomics, Bangalore, India).",

Antibodies against conformation or complex structures other than the primary amino acid sequences may not be captured by our peptide chip. For considerations of cost, only SARS-CoV specific peptides were selected for this study. The epitopes identified are, therefore, only a portion of all the antigenic sites of SARS-CoV. We reported strong humoral responses to the membrane, M, and nucleocapsid, N, proteins. Some of the putative hypothetical proteins, noticeably SARS3a and SARS6, were also shown to be important in the humoral responses to SARS-CoV infection. N protein has the strongest immunoreactivity among all other structural proteins. [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] It is the most abundant protein in SARS-CoV and this may explain the high immunoreactivity. 14 To determine some of the immunodominant epitopes on the N protein that are specific to SARS-CoV, eight epitopes from both the C-and N-termini, were studied. At the Cterminus, epitopes s28-30 showed similar signal profiles, with a significant increase in intensity in the first 10 to 20 days and a second peak at .80 days ( fig 5) . Consistent with other studies, antibodies against the whole N protein were produced in all SARS patients and appeared in the early stages of the disease. 13 15 Epitopes from the C-terminus (N-s28, s29 and s30) of N produced greater humoral responses than those from the N-terminus (N-s25 and s26) . The epitopes N-s30 and N-s29 overlapped for only five amino acids but eight-to 10-fold excess signal was detected on N-s29. The N-terminus of N protein is less well investigated. Our data suggested that a small region-defined by N-s25 and N-s26, excluding N-s13 and N-s27-was antigenic. The humoral responses appeared late in the course of the infection.",

[16] [17] [18] Residue amino acids 318 to 510 of the S protein bound specifically to the functional receptor, angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). [19] [20] [21] In our study, seven epitopes were designed along the N-to C-termini of the S protein. Average fluorescence units Only moderate signals were observed in the middle (S-s5 and S-s33, amino acids 540 to 570) and C-terminus (S-s23, amino acids 1236 to 1255). Unlike the N protein and consistent with earlier findings of reactivity to the whole S protein, 14 very low signal was detected at the early stage. However, the signals increased exponentially after 80 days. Among the three epitopes, S-s33 appeared to be the strongest immunodominant antigen in the S protein, supporting earlier reports with a finer resolution. 16 17 The antigenicity detected in the current study for the C-terminus (s23) is novel and, in view of the importance of S proteins in SARS-CoV infection, further exploration of this area will be important. The membrane (M) protein is a relatively small viral structural protein. Two potential epitopes were identified on this protein. Strong epitope was found in the N-terminus with 100-fold increased responses compared with the Cterminus. Theoretically, sequence analysis predicts a single weak epitopic site for the M protein. 13 Our study showed that antibody against M was in fact common among all the subjects and elicited strong, persistent responses. The humoral responses to M protein may be useful in diagnostic tests and in surveillance. Whether antibody against the M protein conveys protection against future SARS-CoV infection awaits further clarification.",
