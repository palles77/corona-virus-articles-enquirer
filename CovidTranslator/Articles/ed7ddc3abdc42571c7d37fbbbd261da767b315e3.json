World Health organization reported in their site on June 14, 2013 that Globally, from September 2012 to date June 14, 2013, WHO has been informed of a total of 58 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV, including 33 deaths. WHO has received reports of laboratory-confirmed cases originating in the following countries in the Middle East to date: Jordan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). France, Germany, Italy, Tunisia and the United Kingdom also reported laboratory-confirmed cases; they were either transferred there for care of the disease or returned from the Middle East and subsequently became ill. In France, Italy, Tunisia and the United Kingdom, there has been limited local transmission among patients who had not been to the Middle East but had been in close contact with the laboratoryconfirmed or probable cases [2] . In Saudi Arabia, ministry of health reported in their site on October 2013 that number of confirmed cases of novel corona viruses was 114 cases, and 49 cases passed away [3] .",

Also Center for disease control and prevention in USA reported that this virus is different from any other coronavirus previously found in people. It is also different from the coronavirus that caused SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) in 2003. However, like the SARS virus, MERS-CoV is most similar to coronaviruses found in bats [4] .",
