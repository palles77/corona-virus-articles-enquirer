            "text": "Background: Current outbreaks of COVID-19 are threatening the health care systems of several countries around the world. Control measures, based on isolation and quarantine, have been shown to decrease and delay the burden of the ongoing epidemic. With respect to the ongoing COVID-19 epidemic, recent modelling work shows that this intervention technique may be inadequate to control local outbreaks, even when perfect isolation is assumed. Furthermore, the effect of infectiousness prior to symptom onset combined with a significant proportion of asymptomatic infectees further complicates the use of contact tracing. Antivirals, which decrease the viral load and reduce the infectiousness, could be integrated in the control measures in order to augment the feasibility of controlling the epidemic. Methods: Using a simulation-based model of viral transmission we tested the efficacy of different intervention measures for the control of COVID-19. For individuals that were identified through contact tracing, we evaluate two procedures: monitoring individuals for symptoms onset and testing of individuals. Moreover, we investigate the effect of a potent antiviral compound on the contact tracing process. Findings: The use of an antiviral drug, in combination with contact tracing, quarantine and isolation, results in a significant decrease of the final size, the peak incidence, and increases the probability that the outbreak will fade out. Interpretation: For an infectious disease in which presymptomatic infections are plausible, an intervention measure based on contact tracing performs better when realized together with testing instead of monitoring, provided that the test is able to detect infections during the incubation period. In addition, in all tested scenarios, the model highlights the benefits of the administration of an antiviral drug in addition to quarantine, isolation and contact tracing. The resulting control measure, could be an effective strategy to control local and re-emerging outbreaks of COVID-19.",

We argue that when an individual is quarantined at home, 26 this will only result in a partial reduction of contacts, accounting for contacts with household 27 members and other isolation imperfectness. To compensate for this imperfect isolation, we consider 28 the use of an antiviral compound. We test these different control measures in a simulation study 29 that aims at representing, given the available information, the current COVID-19 epidemic. While 30 at this phase of the epidemic, many countries are already beyond the point of local containment.

While this is a limitation of our study,126    we argue that in the scenarios where we aggressively trace and treat the contacts of individuals,127    we are more likely to find (and constrain) cases that would otherwise go undetected. To challenge 128 this assumption, we simulate the impact of asymptomatic individuals, defined to be infectives that129 do not show symptoms during their infectious periods.

Furthermore, Sheahan et al. 4 demonstrated that 143 the degree of the clinical benefit of Remdesivir for MERS depends on the viral dose and also on 144 the timing of the treatment of the viral inhibitor. A lethal viral dose and delaying the initiation of 145 antiviral treatment failed to fully prevent viral pathogenesis. Although Remdesivir proved effective 146 at reducing the viral load also in these conditions, the argument for an early start of antiviral 147 treatment is evident. Presumably, reducing the viral load with an antiviral compound loses its 148 efficacy in advanced disease as the tissue damage is sustained by inflammatory processes in absence 149 of the viral initiator. In our implementation, antiviral injections are immediately administered to 150 successfully traced back individuals, mostly in their asymptomatic phase, and to the diagnosed 151 patient. Therefore, we believe that the assumptions on the use of this drug, in the considered 152 scenario, are reasonable.",

In addition, when a proportion of infected individuals requires 156 hospital care, the number of cases at peak should be minimized as much as possible to avoid 157 that regional health care infrastructure is overwhelmed. In the current study we highlight the158 impact of an antiviral compound that reduces the viral load and, consequently, the infectiousness 159 of infectives. For this simulation study we utilized the data on the control of the viral load by 160 Remdesivir in a pathogen challenge experiment, however, this study can be easily extended to other 161 antivirals, given the availability of viral load data upon drug administration. Although the efficacy 162 of administering an antiviral compound, in addition to isolation and quarantine depends on the 163 effectiveness of the respective drug, it is plausible that drugs that interfere with the infection life 164 cycle show a comparable impact on the viral load. We demonstrate that the implementation of 165 such a compound together with quarantine leads to a substantial reduction of the final size and 166 the peak incidence. In addition, the number of outbreaks that are most challenging to contain 167 decreases when the antiviral is administered to diagnosed and traced individuals. Therefore, the 168 administration of an antiviral drug, together with isolation and quarantine, is expected to have 169 a major impact in the control of local COVID-19 outbreaks. Although antiviral compounds are 170 mostly evaluated in clinical trials for their capacity to control the disease manifestations and alter 171 the clinical outcome in individual patients, our study implies that antiviral compounds can be 172 implemented to alter the spread of a viral epidemic by influencing the viral load and infectiousness 173 of infectees upon quarantine. Additionally, it is expected that the implementation of such a strategy 174during an epidemic outbreak might also prove effective to prevent hospitalisation and the pressure 175 on the health care capacity as these antiviral treatment is initiated earlier in the disease.",
