Each module is supported by pipelines that scan newly released GenBank records, annotate genes and proteins and parse sample descriptors and then map them to controlled vocabulary. These processes in turn support a purpose-built search interface where users can select sequences based on standardized gene, protein and metadata terms.

The public databases that comprise the International Nucleotide Sequence Database Consortium (INSDC) are an invaluable resource to a variety of genome-related sequence analysis projects (1) . This collaboration between the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), the European Bioinformatics Institute and the DNA Databank of Japan supports free and unrestricted access to stored sequence data that are maintained as part of the scientific record. As nucleotide sequencing efforts extend into the future, the archival INSDC databases will support comparisons between samples collected over generations and provide infrastructure to study the evolution and impact of viruses in real time. Despite this potential, there are fundamental issues with archival databases that can only be resolved through resources that provide enhanced data such as the NCBI Virus Variation Resource (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/ viruses/variation/), which is described in this manuscript.",

Hence, it is likely that the gene and protein annotations and information about the source of the sequence will remain unchanged after a sequence is deposited in an INSDC database. This is problematic because even if communities develop sequence annotation standards, the pace of biochemical and genetic research effectively guarantees that annotations become outdated as new genetic features are characterized and naming conventions change. For example, while it has been known for some time that flavivirus genomes encode a polyprotein that is cleaved into mature peptides, sometimes with two rounds of cleavage (3) (4) (5) (6) , recently, several flavivirus proteins have been identified that are translated (at least partially) from alternative reading frames (7) . These alternative reading frame proteins and mature peptides, especially the products of the second round of cleavage, are not annotated in the vast majority of current GenBank records for flavivirus genomes.",

In addition, not all genes or proteins are annotated in all database entries, so one would still likely miss some potential sequences. Alternatively, a nucleotide BLAST search could be performed using the RdRp coding region from the Zaire ebolavirus Reference Sequence (RefSeq accession number NC 002549.1).

This resource leveraged machine processing of Gen-Bank records, human curation and a unique search and retrieval interface to build a value-added user experience where researchers could search for sequences using defined, standardized terms (Table 1 ). An annotation pipeline was added later to standardize gene and protein annotation and nomenclature across all sequences. This feature supports not only standardized annotation of sequences when submitted, but also provides a mechanism to update previously submitted sequences as new genes and proteins are described. In many ways, the NCBI Influenza Virus Resource paved a path for a variety of other resources that share the common goal of making viral sequence data more accessible (9) (10) (11) (12) . These include the NCBI Virus Variation Resource where the Influenza Virus Resource data model was extended to include dengue and West Nile viruses (13, 14) . While the initial release of this resource provided a range of functionalities, the necessity of in-house annotation pipelines and internally developed tools imposed long development cycles making it difficult to quickly provide new modules in response to emerging outbreaks and associated nucleotide sequencing efforts.",

Once selected, sequences can then be downloaded with the standardized metadata in a variety of formats or analyzed using web-based alignment and tree building tools. There are currently seven discrete Virus Variation modules--Dengue virus, Ebolavirus, influenza virus, MERS coronavirus, Rotavirus A, West Nile virus, and Zika virus--and these include a total of nearly 550 000 nucleotide sequences (see Table 2 ). Example usages of the resources for dengue virus, Ebolavirus, and rotavirus are Klema et al. ",

This last point has been particularly relevant over the past several years as emerging viral outbreaks of Ebola and Zika viruses and others have quickly led to large sequencing efforts. There was a clear need to support these sequencing efforts with bioinformatics resources, but timelines prevented traditional development paths where new virus modules and features were added over the course of months. The first rapid deployment of a Virus Variation module was during the western African Ebola virus outbreak that began in December of 2013. The outbreak was declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern by the World Health Organization on August 8, 2014 (http://www.who.int/mediacentre/ news/statements/2014/ebola-20140808/en/). By September, a Virus Variation Resource specific to Ebolaviruses was available to help access the sequences that had begun to pour into the INSDC databases. Similarly, a Virus Variation Resource module was developed in September 2014 in response to the outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Most recently, this rapid response model was repeated for the Zika virus module, which was put in place in March 2016. This need-based deployment strategy is likely a model for future efforts, and much of our current development is geared toward harmonizing processes and interfaces among individual data and software modules so as to provide more support for more virus species within the resource and to respond more efficiently to emergent large-scale sequencing efforts.",

The first pipeline uses a reference protein guided approach based on the Prosplign tool as described previously (8, 13, 18) . Here, protein reference sequences are aligned with potential translations of the query sequence. The highest scoring translation alignment to any protein reference is then chosen and parsed to determine that it meets specific criteria -the presence of a start codon, exact matches to mature peptide cleavage sites or premature stop sites. Post transcriptional and translational exceptions can be accounted for by this tool by adjusting parameters and allowing multiple transitions from different open reading frames to be assembled into a single alignment. One advantage of this approach is that new viruses can be incorporated by adding new reference protein sequences and adjusting the criteria used for validating a particular translation. Such was the case for Zika virus annotation where the existing dengue virus pipeline was updated with new Zika virus reference sequences (see Table 3 ).",

Here, there was a need to quickly develop a pipeline that could validate the annotation on GenBank records and assign consistent gene and protein names so that these could be accurately used as search criteria. To accomplish this, a BLAST-based pipeline was developed that compares genes and proteins as annotated on GenBank records to reference proteins derived from the best reference nucleotide match. If a protein matches the reference sequence with >70% identity as measured by BLASTP then the presence of this protein is stored. Genes are validated in the same manner using BLASTN and reference nucleotide sequences. Sequences with genes and proteins that cannot be validated are pushed to the curation interface where they can be manually examined. Ultimately these approaches support both search and analysis functionality but are not capable of generating standardized annotation across all sequences belonging to a particular virus.",

Though our current pipelines are effective, they are also very specific to particular viruses and application to new viruses requires much work developing reference sequences, defining processing parameters and manually reviewing annotation results. With that in mind we are now implementing a new, third approach to annotation that can be adapted rapidly when needed and is scalable to multiple virus groups. This new approach is built around two important considerations. First, it uses annotations contained within the so-call Reference Sequence records (19) that are created by our group to represent important taxonomic and sequence space groups. The nucleotide and protein sequences within these records can be invaluable for the unambiguous assignment of sequences to defined groups and can also serve as repositories of reference sequence feature annotation maintained by in-house curation efforts often in collaboration with other scientists (20) (21) (22) (23) (24) . Second, this approach includes a comprehensive list of error flags that provide extensive information about sequences and can provide warnings about potential problems. This error coding not only allows staff to quickly sort through thousands of annotations during the development of new pipelines, but also provides potential criteria for the selection or filtering of sequences to resource users. This new approach was used to annotate polyprotein and mature peptide genomic intervals in West Nile virus (WNV), and this annotation will be available soon through the Virus Variation Resource. These annotations were calculated as follows: First, GenBank West Nile sequences were classified as one of the two common lineages of WNV (lineage 1 or lineage 2) using a combination of BLASTN (25) against the two RefSeq sequences and expert knowledge. The principal characteristic that distinguishes lineage 1 from lineage 2 is that the additional protein WARF4 occurs only in lineage 1 WNV genomes and is believed to occur in most of them (7) . There is some evidence that a small proportion of WNV genomes do not fit neatly into lineage 1 or lineage 2 (7), but these were classified as lineage 2 in our annotations. Second, the annotation pipeline built a covariance model (CM) for each of 16 mature peptides present in the NC 009942 RefSeq annotation and for the 15 mature peptides in the NC 001563 RefSeq. The CMs are built using the cmbuild program of the Infernal homology search software package (26) . Infernal is typically used for modeling the sequence and secondary structure of RNAs, and because the sequences we are modeling lack structure (i.e. basepairs between positions), the CMs we created are effectively identical to sequence-only profile hidden Markov models. In the current version of our pipeline, each model was derived from the single RefSeq nucleotide sequence encoding each mature peptide. Third, the CMs built from the RefSeq to which that genome was assigned were used to predict each mature peptide coding sequence using Infernal's cmscan program.",

For example, the pipeline checks for the exis-tence of any in-frame stop codons within the predicted regions. If one or more is found, the prediction boundaries are modified to terminate at the 5 -most stop found. Coding sequence (CDS) coordinates are determined implicitly based on the predicted mature peptide coordinates. Lineage 1 (NC 009942) has three CDSs and lineage 2 (NC 001563) has two CDSs. For each CDS, the predictions for the corresponding mature peptides that make up each CDS are tested for consistency by ensuring that mature peptide coding sequences that are adjacent (separated by 0 nucleotides) in the RefSeq are also adjacent in the predictions. The start position of the first mature peptide and end position of the final mature peptide that comprise each CDS are then used as the start and stop position for that CDS. CDS annotations are not made if the mature peptide consistency check fails. In addition to checking for early stop codons and the adjacency of mature peptide coding sequences, the annotation pipeline identifies other unusual or unexpected features in each sequence and reports those as 'error codes'. There are 17 possible error codes, which provide an easy way for users to gauge the quality of each sequence and its annotations, and should facilitate the selection of subsets of the sequence data that meet specific user-defined quality standards. A more detailed description of the new annotation pipeline and error flags will be included in full detail eventually in a separate manuscript, as well as in the help documents available at the Virus Variation Resource.",

In this convention host refers to an organism--and hence has an organism's name that can be mapped to the NCBI taxonomy tree--and isolation source refers to a physical, en-vironmental or local geographic location (1) . For human pathogens isolation source often refers to a host tissue or bodily fluid, and the Virus Variation vocabulary mapping strategy attempts to combine similar clinical terms into biologically relevant groups. For example, the parsed terms 'serum,' 'plasma' and 'lymphocytes' are all mapped to the standardized vocabulary term 'blood'. To support more efficient data retrieval, host terms are mapped in a hierarchy, and once a species term such as 'Accipiter cooperii' is identified, it is mapped to both the group name 'Bird' and the common name 'Accipiter. ' Other metadata terms such as those for disease associations and clinical/laboratory manipulations are more difficult to parse. To this end, laboratory isolates, vaccine strains and environmental samples are identified by searching for key terms, such as 'tissue culture' or 'sewage,' from all fields. Disease terms for dengue virus are also found using a similar strategy. In all cases these strategies require extensive examination of sequence records and documentation of specific terms that can be accurately mapped to controlled vocabulary gleaned from established ontologies such as the Environmental Ontology (https:// bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/ENVO) and the Infectious Disease Ontology (https://bioportal.bioontology. org/ontologies/IDO). This process is supported by a curation interface that lists records where parsing fails to identify expected terms, leading to good old-fashioned manual curation and the identification of new terms, common misspellings, regional spelling differences and the manual incorporation of metadata from relevant literature into the Virus Variation database. In total, these vocabulary remapping strategies can have a profound impact on data usability as large numbers of parsed terms can be mapped to controlled vocabularies (Table 4 ).",

Search parameters are displayed at the top of the results page, and a table displays retrieved sequences and associated metadata. The individual columns within the table can be selected to display specific sets of metadata and hyperlinked GenBank and BioSample accessions (29) . BioSample records store an extended set of sample descriptors and are linked to Sequence Read Archive (SRA) (30) records, allowing users to easily find sequence read data associated with retrieved GenBank sequences when available. One new feature is the ability to collapse identical retrieved sequences for all viruses as described in the preceding section. When identical sequences are collapsed on the query page, they will be represented by a single sequence on the results page with the number of collapsed sequences shown in the 'Identical sequences' column (see Figure 2 ). Clicking the arrows in the 'Identical sequences' column displays the individual sequences and makes them selectable. Users can now customize sequence titles including the FASTA defline of downloaded sequences and tree labels using the 'Customize label' tool. The defline can be modified to include various types of data such as the sequence accession number, calculated genomic The Ebolavirus module search interface with all elements opened and several example searches displayed in the query builder. The search page is divided into three elements. The first element supports selection of protein or nucleotide sequences based on standardized metadata terms generated by processing pipelines described in the text. Menus support filtering of sequences based on gene or protein names, host, isolation country and isolation source, and collection and release dates ranges can be set with text boxes. Additional filters are accessible with a drop-down arrow revealing options for environmental or laboratory isolates, vaccine strains, keyword or sequence string searches, and optional menus tailored to specific viruses. The second element supports searches based on GenBank accessions -either using the text box or by uploading a text file of accessions. The third element includes the query builder where the number of sequences retrieved from individual searches can be viewed by clicking one of the 'Add query' buttons. When multiple searches are added to the Query Builder, the total number of unique sequence records is also summed. A checkbox is provided that allows identical sequences to be collapsed and represented by the oldest sequence on the results table. Clicking the 'Show results' button opens a separate browser tab and displays all of the sequences meeting the criteria in each of the checked queries in the results interface.",

The influenza module uses previously described tools for these functions (8, 13, 31) , but a new set of tools has been developed for other viruses. Multi-ple sequence alignments are constructed using an optimized version of MUSCLE, and rooted trees are generated using the Unweighted Pair Group Method with six base nucleotide or amino acid k-mers (32) (see Figure 3 ). The multiple sequence alignment display includes a navigation map above the alignment, a variation histogram and a consensus sequence. Characters are colored to indicate variable positions. The alignment can be downloaded in FASTA, Clustal, Phylip, NEXUS, or ASN.1 formats. The tree display supports a variety of layouts including rectangular and slanted cladograms, radial trees and circular trees, the image can be downloaded as a PDF, and the tree file can be down- loaded in ASN text or binary, Newick, or NEXUS formats. These options are accessible through the 'Tools' menu in the viewer. The data labels on multi-sequence alignments and trees can be customized from the results table before the tree is calculated using the 'Customize label' options, making it easier to identify the distribution of sample/sequence characteristics. When certain download formats are selected, customized labels will be included in the downloaded files (FASTA and ASN.1 for the multiple alignments, and all files for the trees). A URL is also provided to make sharing a tree easy.",

The resource now includes more than 20% of the GenBank sequences that are assigned viral taxonomy. Further improvement will be dependent on which viruses are added in the future and on updates to the various pipelines, interfaces and tools so that they can further support user needs. Our plan is to increase the pace at which new virus species are added to the Virus Variation Resource, and we are currently developing layers of data processingthe least transformative of which could be applied across all viral sequences but still provide basic information about a sequence. The search interface and data displays will be revised so that they better support user-required comparative genomic functions across a much larger number of viral species from the same query page. We also intend to support searches based on author names and more detailed sample information, such as clinical symptoms or laboratory handling. Though we will begin parsing the potentially rich metadata data sets from BioSample records, the success of this effort will ultimately rest on improved community awareness and more consistent submission of metadata to public databases. Given the unbridled growth and clear potential of nucleotide sequencing efforts, one must assume the current Virus Variation Resource is just scratching the surface of future bioinformatic needs. The current resource model is suited to viruses that have experimentally validated annotation, and similar modules are in development for additional viral species. However, the vast majority of viruses do not have strong experimental evidence for protein coding regions, making it difficult to build a Virus Variation module including an annotation pipeline. In these cases annotation will need to be inferred from related, experimentally studied viruses, requiring new approaches and better ways of standardizing gene and protein information across multiple groups of viruses. Our current annotation pipeline development is directed toward these goals, and we intend to extend public access to these pipelines beyond our current influenza virus module. We also intend to reveal resourcederived annotation as tracks on multiple sequence alignments, making annotated sequences available for download and improving access to our data sets. This will also enable users to limit downloads and multiple sequence alignments to selected mature peptides for polyprotein sequences, and trees to be built from selected genomic regions.",

(A) A sample tree is shown depicting the use of standardized metadata terms as sequence labels. The tree was built from 31 West Nile virus complete polyprotein sequences collected since 2013. Sequence labels are based on GenBank accessions, host, country of isolation and isolation date. Left clicking a node highlights the lineage, and hovering over a node with the cursor displays a menu that includes descriptors for that particular sample, including GenBank accession and available standardized metadata terms for host, country, isolation source, etc. The menu also includes a function to reroot the tree around that sequence. (B) A multi-sequence alignment is shown for the same 31 West Nile polyprotein sequences. Individual GenBank accessions are listed to the left next to sequences. Left clicking the accession displays a menu that includes the standardized metadata label chosen in the results interface, a link to the sequence in GenBank, a function to use that sequence as an anchor for the alignment. Differences between residues in a given sequence and the consensus are highlighted in red. A histogram above the alignment shows coverage in blue and the frequency of changes in red. sophisticated combination of MUSCLE-multiple sequence alignment and phylogenetic tree. We are also interested in supporting BLAST-based searches within our data sets to support more precise sequence associations. Ultimately, the presumed very large sequencing datasets of the future will ultimately require better ways to evaluate data retrieved from searches which, in turn, will require better integration of search functions with data visualizations such as trees.Members of the scientific community are encouraged to contact the NCBI Help Desk (ncbi-help@ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) to make suggestions to improve the Virus Variation Resource, or to assist with establishing annotation or metadata standards.
