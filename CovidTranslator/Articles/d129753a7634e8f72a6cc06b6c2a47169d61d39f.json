HLA-A*3001 and HLA-A*3002 major histocompatibility complex-peptide complexes were recognized in individuals with active TB, irrespective of their homozygous HLA-A*3001 or HLA-A*3002 genetic back- ground. The antigen-specific T cells exhibited the CD45RA \u0609 CCR7 \u0609 precursor phenotype and the inter- leukin-7 receptor (CD127), which were different from the phenotype and receptor exhibited by the parental CD8 \u0609 T-cell population",

We examined the frequency of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles, followed by recombinant expression of the most frequent HLA-A alleles, i.e., HLA-A*3001 and HLA-A*3002, to study differences in mycobacterial peptide presentation and CD8 \u0609 T-cell recognition. We screened a peptide library (9-mer peptides with an 8-amino-acid overlap) for binding, affinity, and off-rate of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis-associated antigen TB10.4 and identified only three TB10.4 peptides with considerable binding to HLA-A*3001. In contrast, 22 peptides bound to HLA-A*3002. This reflects a marked difference in the binding preference between the two alleles, with A*3002 tolerating a more promiscuous peptide-binding pattern and A*3001 accommodating only a very selective peptide repertoire. Subsequent analysis of the affinity and off-rate of the binding peptides revealed a strong affinity (8 nM to 7 M) and moderate off-rate (20 min to 3 h) for both alleles.",

The highest TB incidences are found in sub-Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia (10, 24) . This calls for a better understanding of the immune response directed against Mycobacterium tuberculosis in blood samples obtained from individuals of African descent. This may aid with the development of new and better diagnostics as well as the identification of biomarkers, which will help to monitor novel TB vaccine candidates, since currently, only large and costly phase II and III clinical trials can define the effectiveness of vaccines in African countries with a high TB burden. Dissection of the biology in major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-peptide presentation will contribute to a better profiling of successful immune responses, i.e., the responses in individuals who have been exposed yet who appear to be protected from TB, and less successful responses in individuals with latent or active TB (24) .",

            "text": "Many parts of the immune system play an important roles in M. tuberculosis-directed responses (16) . The adaptive anti-M. tuberculosis immune response is dependent on presentation of disease-associated immunogenic peptides via the MHC molecules to T-cell receptors (TCRs) from CD4 \u03e9 and CD8 \u03e9 T cells (52) . T-cell recognition of a peptide derived from a protein in the presence of a costimulatory signal leads to T-cell activation and proliferation. Identification of novel antigenic peptides recognized by CD8 \u03e9 T cells and presented via the trimeric, heavy-chain \u2424 2 -microglobulin peptide-MHC class I complex (28) will therefore be of great value to better understand the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL)-mediated anti-M. tuberculosis immune response. MHC class I is the most polymorphic molecule in the human body, with over 2,000 different alleles identified in humans to date (39) . The majority of the polymorphism lies within exons 2 and 3, coding for the peptide-binding pocket of the MHC class I molecule. Most of these alleles are associated with different peptide-binding preferences, summarized as a peptide-binding motif (14) . The allele distribution and frequency differ considerably between ethnic populations, and therefore, our efforts to increase our knowledge of the disease-related epitopes associated with population-relevant, different MHC class I molecules and to understand the cellular immune response in individuals of different ethnic backgrounds need to include the most frequent alleles in individuals of African descent. The human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A*30 family is one of the most frequent allele families in individuals from an African background. It consists of 31 alleles, of which the most common are HLA-A*3001 and HLA-A*3002 (9, 34) . Individual MHC class I alleles may have an impact on disease susceptibility, and differences may guide vaccination efforts, as has been described for the antigen-specific (melanoma antigen recognized by T cells 1 ) immunization of patients with melanoma: peptide vaccination elicits cellular immune responses in HLA-A*0202, -A*0204, -A*0205, and -A*0207 but not in individuals with HLA-A*0209 (15) .",

A tetramer (KTKDIVNGL) loaded with a selfepitope derived from F-actin-capping protein beta and an epitope (KIQNFR VYY) from the HIV type 1 (HIV-1) integrase were also constructed as control reagents. Most individuals were found to react to HLA-A*30-KTKDIVNGL-MHC-peptide complexes (up to 1% in CD3 \u03e9 CD8 \u03e9 T cells; data not shown). This reagent was therefore used as a positive-control tetramer; the HIV integrase epitope served as the negative tetramer. MHC class I monomers containing the selected epitopes were incubated together with fluorescence-labeled streptavidin at a ratio of 4:1 at room temperature for 30 min. The following six M. tuberculosis tetramers were constructed and labeled with streptavidin-phycoerythrin (PE) and streptavidin-allophycocyanin (APC): A*3001 QIMYNYPAM -PE, A*3001 LVRAYHAMS -PE, A*3002 QIMYNYPAM -PE, A*3002 QIMYNYPAM -APC, A*3002 IMYNYPAML -PE, and A*3002 AMEDLVRAY -PE. Cellular analyses were performed using a fluorescence-activated cell sorter (Gallios flow cytometer; Beckman Coulter). Tetramer-positive events were identified in the CD3 \u03e9 CD8 \u03e9 CD4 \u03ea lymphocyte population using the following Abs: CD3 peridinin chlorophyll protein (clone SP-34-2; Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ), CD8a Alexa Fluor 750 (clone T8), and CD4 Pacific Blue (clone SFC112T4D11) (Beckman Coulter).

For A*30-positive specimens, we subsequently performed four-digit typing to decipher the nature of the actual allele. The following percentages were identified in the HLA-A*30 cohort: A*3001, 53%; A*3002, 21%; A*3003, 0%; and A*3004, 26%.

Generally, affinities were higher for peptides binding to HLA-A*3002 than for peptides binding to HLA-A*3001 ( Fig. 3 and Table 1 ). This was also found to be true concerning three peptides that bound to both HLA-A*3001 and HLA-A*3002 but which exhibited a higher affinity toward HLA-A*3002 (4 M, 5 M, and 2 M for HLA-A*3001 versus 40 nM, 8 nM, and 2 M for HLA-A*3002, respectively) ( Table 2 ). The dissociation rate was moderately fast and varied from 30 min to 1.8 h for the HLA-A*3001 allele. HLA-A*3002 had a slightly wider range of off-rates, with peptide SQIMYNYPA (TB10.4 2-10 ) dissociating most rapidly with a t 1/2 of only 20 min and with peptide IMYNYPAML (TB10.4 4-12 ) having a t 1/2 value for binding of more than 3 h. No general difference concerning the dissociation rates between the two alleles could be identified ( Fig. 4 and Table 2 ). Cellular analysis of selected TB10.4 epitopes. We constructed tetrameric MHC class I-peptide complexes to evaluate whether the TB10.4 candidate peptides serve as target epitopes for CD8 \u03e9 T cells from patients with pulmonary TB. The peptides were chosen on the basis of their high affinity values and slow dissociation rates, important parameters for tetramer stability. Since the peptide QIMYNYPAM (TB10.4 3-11 ) bound relatively stably to HLA-A*3001 and HLA-A*3002, we constructed two different tetramers presenting the identical peptide. Tetramers were used to stain for epitope-specific CD8 \u03e9 T cells in the HLA-A*30-typed patients.",

We used an alternate way to test whether T cells recognizing HLA-A*3002-or HLA-A*3001-peptide tetramer complexes exhibit the same immune phenotype using markers for CD45RA and CCR7. The majority (70%) of the total CD8 \u03e9 T-cell population in PBMCs obtained from patients with pulmonary TB exhibited a peripheral memory effector phenotype (CD45RA \u03ea CCR7 \u03ea ). In contrast, M. tuberculosis antigen-specific T cells, defined by tetramer staining, showed a different phenotype with a higher percentage of precursor cells (CD45RA \u03e9 CCR7 \u03e9 ) (28 to 43%), central memory cells (CD45RA \u03ea CCR7 \u03e9 ) (13 to 25%), and terminally differentiated cells (CD45RA \u03e9 CCR7 \u03ea ) (8 to 31%) (Fig. 5A) . We did not observe significant differences concerning the phenotype of TB10.4 QIMYNYPAML epitope-specific T cells and the MHC class I-restricting molecule, i.e., HLA-A*3001 and HLA-A*3002 (Fig. 5B) .",

We identified a high prevalence of these two alleles and subsequently proceeded to produce recombinant proteins, which allowed us to identify MHC class I-binding peptides from an M. tuberculosis target protein, which has been reported to induce T-cell responses upon BCG vaccination, upon natural infection, or in response to TB10.4 vaccination (4, 8, 13, 33, 47) .",

            "text": "The biochemical features of HLA-A*3001 concerning peptide presentation are still unsolved. Several conflicting reports exist regarding the peptide-binding specificity. One report suggests the peptide-binding preference reflected in the A*3001 peptide-binding motif to be X(Y/F)XXXXXXL (26), but Lamberth et al. reported another motif for HLA-A*3001, i.e., XX XXXXX(K/V/R) (27) . Both studies indicated that amino acid 9 is the central anchor point concerning peptide binding. A different study suggested that amino acid residue 3 may be important as an anchor residue for peptide-MHC interaction (45) . Our study cannot confirm any of these motifs, since we identified only three positively binding peptides for this allele, (26), indicating a preference for tyrosine residues at the C-terminal position and a preference for hydrophobic or aromatic amino acids at position 2. A similar motif which describes the C-terminal position, with aromatic or hydrophobic amino acids being the most important part for peptide binding, has been proposed by Sidney et al. (46) . Our results agreed in part with these findings; i.e., 20 of the 22 HLA-A*3002-binding peptides evaluated in this study exhibited aromatic, hydrophobic, or small uncharged amino acids in the C-terminal position. We identified 10 different amino acids at position 2 of the HLA-A*3002-binding peptides. The amino acids at positions 1 and 3 also showed great variations. This indicates that HLA-A*3002 appears to utilize multiple secondary anchor residues in the C-and N-terminal regions and may therefore show a promiscuous binding motif. This may explain the large number of positive HLA-A*30binding peptides identified in this study. It also underlines that the use of in silico predictive programs using common binding motifs for the alleles HLA-A*3001 and HLA-A*3002 may underestimate the number of candidate binding peptides. The actual measurement of the MHC class I-peptide interaction appears to be necessary to objectively identify target peptides from a protein.",

            "text": "We found that the major difference between the two HLA-A*30 alleles is the very restricted peptide-binding profile of HLA-A*3001 compared to the profile of HLA-A*3002. HLA-A*3002 has previously been described to be an allele with a broad binding pattern (38) . In contrast, HLA-A*3001 has been proposed to behave similarly to the HLA-A*03 alleles (27) with more restricted peptide-binding patterns, yet no direct comparison has been performed, to our knowledge. It is likely that the amino acid substitutions, which differ between HLA-A*3001 and HLA-A*3002, lead to profound differences in the structure of the peptide-binding cleft, e.g., the introduction of the big and bulky tryptophan at position 152 in HLA-A*3001, a position contributing to the shape of the E pocket. This might affect the ability to accommodate big amino acids at the Cterminal end. In fact, all the identified HLA-A*3001-binding peptides (this study) exhibit relatively small amino acids at positions 8 and 9. The D77N and W152R substitutions lead to a change of electric charge from a more negative charge in HLA-A*3001 to a more positive charge in HLA-A*3002. This may be the reason why one of the A*3001 peptide-binding motifs showed a preference for positively charged amino acids at the C terminus (although we could not denitrify peptides with such characteristics). The confirmation of these theories has to await the crystal structures of these proteins, which are not available at this time. In summary, the substantial differences between HLA-A*3001 and HLA-A*3002 underline the value of accurate four-digit typing of the HLA-A*30 family in the context of susceptibility to or protection from disease (31) . For instance, HLA-A*30 has been identified as one of the risk factors for the development of cytomegalovirus (CMV) disease after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (25) . It is not clear if this association is due instead to the limited capacity of HLA-A*3001 to present CMV peptides to CD8 \u03e9 T cells.",

Previous studies using recombinant MHC molecules have shown that for most MHC alleles the affinity (ED 50 ) lies between 100 M and 10 nM (4, 5) . This is true for the peptides analyzed for HLA-A*3001, yet we identified here some peptides with an even higher affinity (ED 50 , \u03f38 nM). Previous reports suggested a correlation between high affinity and a dominant T-cell response (44) . However, the distinct yet low frequency of tetramer-reactive T cells does not suggest a dominant recognition in the context of acute pulmonary TB. The frequency of these target-specific T cells is similar to that of antigen-specific T cells in cancer; a low frequency of peptide-reactive T cells in the peripheral circulation does not preclude clinical efficacy (3) . Not mutually exclusively, HLA-A*3001-or HLA-A*3002-restricted T cells may show different frequencies after initiation of anti-M. tuberculosis therapy; immune reconstitution, e.g., TCR zeta-chain recovery (42) ; and T-cell redistribution. Tetramer-guided identification of M. tuberculosis-directed T-cell responses may be critical in acute pulmonary TB, often associated with T-cell anergy (36) and dysfunctional cytokine production (36, 51) . It may also be helpful to trace M. tuberculosis-reactive T cells in PBMCs from patients with HIV-M. tuberculosis coinfection, since less than 200 CD4 \u03e9 T cells/l blood are associated with false-negative results in interferon (IFN)-based immunological diagnostic test systems (49) .",

The entire panel of MHC class I-TB10.4 peptide complexes was recognized by antigen-specific T cells in PBMCs from patients with pulmonary TB, irrespective of the HLA-A*3001 or HLA-A*3002 background. This observation differed from that from a previous study, in which no crossrecognition was observed using HIV peptides and CD8 \u03e9 T cells from HLA-A*3002-and HLA-A*3001-positive subjects defined by gamma IFN enzyme-linked immunospot assay (18) . This may reflect either the nature of the HIV peptides (which may not bind to the picky HLA-A*3001 allele) or, not mutually exclusively, the lack of IFN production in HLA-A*3001/HLA-A*3002-restricted T cells. We did not detect general differences in T-cell recognition by applying an A*3001 tetramer with an A*3001-binding peptide using PBMCs from an A*3002-positive patient. This was also true using the same peptide, QIMYNYPAM (TB10.4 [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] ), which bound either to HLA-A*3001 or to HLA-A*3002.",

This finding is in line with previous findings regarding marker analysis of tetramer-specific T cells recognizing another M. tuberculosis antigen, i.e., Ag85B (20) , yet it differs from the findings of other studies which showed that the majority of antigen-specific T cells against M. tuberculosis may reside in the memory (CD45RA \u03ea ) compartment (51) or the terminally differentiated effector population (CD45RA \u03e9 CCR7 \u03ea ) compartment (8) . A possible explanation for the high number of antigen-specific precursor CD8 \u03e9 T cells in our study may be the increase in lymphopoiesis in patients with TB. Not mutually exclusively, it could also be due to the recycling of terminally differentiated cells to precursor CD8 \u03e9 T cells; i.e., the cells revert to a quiescent state indistinguishable from precursor cells, on the basis of CD45RA and CCR7 expression, but they are not truly na\u00efve (2, 6) .

This is also true for expression of the IL-7 receptor and the cytotoxicity marker CD107a (Fig. 5D ). There is a difference of only a single amino acid between HLA-A*3001 and HLA-A*3002 (position 76) protruding out from the peptide-binding pocket. It may therefore be possible that the same T-cell population recognizes the identical peptide bound to either HLA-A*3001 or HLA-A*3002. However, we would require further studies to examine in greater detail the T-cell frequency of HLA-A*3001-restricted T cells reacting to a broader array of HLA-A*3002-presented peptides using tetramer molecules, since certain peptide species may not have been presented to the T-cell repertoire in an HLA-A*3001-homozygous individual. Some TCRs may recognize their target peptides irrespective of the MHC presenting allele, as described for HLA-A3 and HLA-A11 (30) . Not mutually exclusively, the different peptidebinding grooves of HLA-A*3002 and HLA-A*3001 might influence the conformation of the binding peptide, thereby altering the surface exposed to the TCR (32), which influences T-cell recognition. A different exposure of the peptide backbone to responder T cells may affect T-cell recognition and subsequent T-cell effector functions. Flexibility in the TCR itself may even contribute to MHC class I-peptide recognition patterns: some TCR V\u2424 families may even allow effective recognition of point mutations in target peptides and contribute to immune protection (19, 29, 43) .",
