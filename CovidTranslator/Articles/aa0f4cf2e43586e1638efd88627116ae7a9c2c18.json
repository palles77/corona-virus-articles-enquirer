A rapid, specific and sensitive detection method is always needed to control the influenza in its early stages by timely intervention of therapy and early clinical management. Objectives: To develop RT-LAMP assays for detection of influenza A viruses, their further subtyping into seasonal (H1N1, H3N2) and novel pandemic H1N1 viruses and to evaluate clinical applicability of optimized RT-LAMP assays on patients' samples. Study design: In this study, we optimized RT-LAMP assay to detect IAVs by using primers against matrix gene and subtyping of IAVs was done by using primers against hemagglutinin gene. Optimized RT-LAMP assays were applied on clinical samples from patients having influenza like illness and results were compared with conventional one-step RT-PCR and real-time RT-PCR. Results: RT-LAMP assays successfully detected and differentiated IAVs into H1N1, H3N2 and pdm09/H1N1 subtypes. One hundred and sixty seven clinical swab samples from influenza suspected patients were taken and tested with RT-LAMP assay, detecting 30 (17.9%) samples positive for Influenza A virus. Out of 30 samples, 21, 7 and 2 were found positive for pdm09/H1N1, H3N2 and seasonal H1 respectively. Conventional one-step RT-PCR detected a total of 27 (16.2%) samples for influenza A and further subtyping showed 20 and 7 samples positive for pdm09/H1N1 and H3N2 virus respectively whereas none was found positive for seasonal H1N1. RT-LAMP assay demonstrated higher sensitivity (93.8%) than conventional RT-PCR (84.4%) for influenza A viruses detection in clinical samples. Conclusions: RT-LAMP assay is rapid, sensitive, specific and cost effective method for detection of influenza A viruses than conventional one-step RT-PCR and it can serve as a good alternate for diagnosis and surveillance studies during influenza outbreaks in resource-limited setups of developing countries.",

Seasonal outbreaks, epidemics and pandemics have been witnessed for IAVs and have resulted in immense loss to public health and economy (Wright and Neumann, 2013) . The devastating potential of Influenza is shown by the facts that annually there are estimated 3-5 million cases of severe illness and 300,000-500,000 deaths around the globe (WHO, 2016) . Influenza viruses belong to the family Orthomyxoviridae, characterized by segmented, negative-sense, single stranded RNA genome (Shaw and Palese, 2013) . The family contains seven genera viz., Influenzavirus A, Influenzavirus B, Influenzavirus C, Influenzavirus D, Isavirus, Quaranjavirus and Thogotovirus (ICTV, 2016) . Out of the four genera of influenza viruses, influenza A and B are the main cause of seasonal epidemics while influenza C causes mild reparatory illness and influenza D affects cattle and not known to cause any infection in humans (Hause et al., 2014; CDC, 2016; Ferguson et al., 2016) .",

            "text": "Influenza or \"Flu\" is a respiratory illness characterized by high grade fever, myalgia, headache, malaise, sore throat, rhinitis and cough (Cox and Subbarao, 1999 ). Generally influenza is a self limiting disease but may become life-threatening in high risk group individuals including young children, pregnant women, aged people and people with compromised immunity (Cox and Subbarao, 1999; Cox and Subbarao, 2000) . Influenza vaccines are updated annually according to the circulating strains and this information is provided by the surveillance system of WHO's Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS) for both the northern and southern hemispheres (WHO, 2012; Webster and Govorkova, 2014) . Antivirals treatment proved effective against influenza if given within 24-48 h of the onset of disease (Moscona, 2005) . Hence, early and accurate diagnosis of influenza plays a crucial role for timely intervention of therapy, clinical management and thus controlling the spread of disease. Clinical symptoms of influenza and other respiratory infections can be very similar, making it hard to differentiate. Only laboratory diagnosis can provide an accurate influenza diagnosis. These include conventional virus isolation, antigen/antibody detection and molecular methods like reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) (Poddar, 2002) and real time RT-PCR (rRT-PCR) (Spackman and Suarez, 2008; Carr et al., 2009; Wang and Taubenberger, 2010) . Virus isolation and serological assays are time consuming and take days to weeks to get results making them unsuitable during epidemics and also these methods require highly sophisticated biosafety laboratories. Molecular methods such as RT-PCR and rRT-PCR are although rapid, sensitive and specific but need costly equipments and trained laboratory persons making these assays hard to use in resource-limited laboratories of developing countries.",

            "text": "Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) is a specific, efficient and rapid technique that is similar to PCR amplification but the target DNA amplification is under isothermal conditions. This method makes use of a DNA polymerase with strand displacement activity and a set of four specially designed primers that recognize a total of six distinct sequences on the target DNA (Notomi et al., 2000) . The method is applicable to amplification of RNA templates when combined with a reverse transcription reaction (RT-LAMP). RT-LAMP assay has been successfully applied for the detection of various RNA viruses including chikungunya (Parida et al., 2007; Lu et al., 2012) , dengue (Lu et al., 2012; Parida et al., 2005) , Japanese encephalitis (Parida et al., 2006; Toriniwa and Komiya, 2006) , severe acute respiratory syndrome (Thai et al., 2004) and West Nile virus . Influenza viruses and their novel subtypes like H5, H7, H9 and H10, have been effectively detected by RT-LAMP assay (Poon et al., 2005; Ito et al., 2006; Imai et al., 2006; Chen et al., 2008; Zhang et al., 2013; Luo et al., 2015) . The specificity of RT-LAMP is extremely high due to use of four primers that recognize six distinct regions on the target DNA. It is faster than PCR because of single temperature is needed for amplification and also cost effective as costly equipments are not required. The amplification results can be viewed directly by using fluorescent dye like SYBR green, reducing the time of the assay.",

Control of novel influenza A viruses mainly depends of early and accurate identification of virus strain followed by early intervention of antiviral therapy. So, a rapid, sensitive, specific and cost effective method of detection and subtyping of influenza A viruses is always seems fruitful in this scenario. Virus isolation using egg embryo culture or cell culture is considered as 'gold standard' for influenza virus detection but the whole process is labour intensive and lengthy taking 3-7 days for obtaining results (Ellis and Zambon, 2002) . Serological methods are also not very reliable for influenza surveillance as these are time consuming and require analysis of serum samples from both acute phase and recovering phase. Rapid detection kit based assays are although fast but are not very consistent, have low sensitivity and may produce false results (Wang and Taubenberger, 2010; Ellis and Zambon, 2002; Kim and Poudel, 2013) . Molecular detection methods have emerged as very Table 3 Limit of detection of RT-LAMP, conventional one-step RT-PCR and real-time RT-PCR assay using virus titre as plaque forming units (PFU). useful tools in comparison to time consuming conventional virus isolation and serological methods. Molecular methods based on conventional RT-PCR and real-time RT-PCR have been proved useful in diagnosis and surveillance of influenza viruses, but most of these assays require highly sophisticated instruments and are not feasible to conduct in resource-limited settings of developing countries. Therefore, present study was focused on RT-LAMP assay for detection of influenza A viruses and further subtyping into seasonal influenza (H1 and H3) and novel pandemic influenza A virus (pdm09/H1N1). RT-LAMP assay has been successfully applied to detect influenza A viruses like swine flu (H1N1), pdmH1N1, avian influenza H5, H7, H9 and H10 subtypes (Poon et al., 2005; Ito et al., 2006; Imai et al., 2006; Chen et al., 2008; Luo et al., 2015; Kubo et al., 2010; Parida et al., 2011; Bao et al., 2012) . In this study, we used matrix gene based primers for detection of influenza A viruses (Poon et al., 2005) and hemagglutinin gene based primers for their further subtyping. Matrix gene based RT-LAMP assay was able to amplify all three reference strains of influenza A virus and hemagglutinin gene based RT-LAMP assay successfully detected the respective subtypes. No cross-reactivity was observed for other related viruses and influenza subtypes making the reaction highly specific.",

In this study we have compared RT-LAMP with conventional RT-PCR and Taqman real-time RT-PCR. In our study, detection limit of Taqman rRT-PCR was found to be ten times more than RT-LAMP for influenza A and its subtype H1N1 whereas for detection of pdm09/H1N1 and H3N2 both assays showed similar values. Sensitivity comparison of RT-LAMP with conventional RT-PCR showed that RT-LAMP was 10-100 times more sensitive than conventional RT-PCR. Previous studies have also established that RT-LAMP is more sensitive than conventional RT-PCR and has comparable sensitivity with real-time RT-PCR for detection of influenza viruses (Poon et al., 2005; Kubo et al., 2010; Parida et al., 2011; Bao et al., 2012; Sharma and Kaushik, 2016) .",

            "text": "In the present study, a total of 167 clinical samples were analyzed for the presence of IAVs and their further subtyping was done. We have showed that RT-LAMP assay can be applied successfully for the diagnostic and surveillance studies of influenza viruses. Detection time is a crucial factor of any diagnostic assay. RT-LAMP assays were completed in 1 h and results were shown after 30 min of agarose gel electrophoresis. So RT-LAMP assay gave efficient results within one and a half hours of sample processing (RNA extraction) making this assay fast when compared with conventional RT-PCR and real time RT-PCR which gave results within 2-3 h (Gu et al., 2010) . Previous studies have reported that by using two accessory loop primers the amplification time can be reduced from 60 min to 30-40 min (Luo et al., 2015; Kubo et al., 2010; Gu et al., 2010; Imai et al., 2007; Peng et al., 2011) . For the sake of simplicity and making our reaction more cost effective we stuck to the basic protocol of RT-LAMP assay and use only four primers for amplification which didn't compromise with sensitivity of the assay. RT-LAMP assay can be modified to detect samples in real-time by using turbidity measurement by turbidimeter as turbidity of reaction increases due to release of pyrophosphates during amplification. Moreover, addition of a florescent dye like calcein or SYBR green in the reaction can be used for direct visualization of the amplification products under UV light thus eliminating the need of gel electrophoresis making the reaction more rapid and less prone to crosscontaminations (Luo et al., 2015; Kubo et al., 2010; Bao et al., 2012; Gu et al., 2010; Peng et al., 2011) .We used SYBR green I dye (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) for direct visualization under UV light and both visual detection and agarose gel electrophoresis produced similar results. This showed that RT-LAMP assay can be applied as a point-of-care test during influenza outbreaks due to its simplicity, high sensitivity and less turn-around time.",

RT-LAMP assay is highly cost effective and easy to perform as sophisticated instruments like a thermocycler and fluorescent data analyzing computers (as in real-time RT-PCR) are not needed and the whole reaction can be done in a controlled temperature water bath or dry heating block. The results of the study clearly showed that RT-LAMP assay can be applied successfully to the clinical samples and the results were compatible with that of the WHO's recommended real-time RT-PCR. The RT-LAMP assay is a simple, rapid, specific, sensitive and cost effective method for detection and subtyping of influenza A viruses and may prove useful in the resource-poor laboratories of the developing countries during influenza outbreaks.",

Sensitivity and specificity were calculated by taking rRT-PCR as standard. The numbers in parentheses indicate the real-time RT-PCR results. ND: not determined.Detection and subtyping of influenza A viruses used RT-LAMP assay, conventional RT-PCR and rRT-PCR assay in parallel reactions for diagnosis of influenza in clinical samples. Real-time RT-PCR reaction was performed using WHO recommended primers(WHO, 2014)  and was used as standard to compare RT-LAMP and conventional RT-PCR assay. Real-time RT-PCR detected 32 samples positive for influenza A viruses, which on further subtyping showed 2, 7 and 23 samples for influenza H1N1, H3N2 and pdm09/H1N1 respectively. Sensitivity of conventional RT-PCR for detection of influenza A viruses and subtype pdm09/H1N1 was 84.4% (27/32) and 86.9% (20/ 23) respectively. Whereas RT-LAMP assay showed sensitivity of 93.8% (30/32) for influenza A viruses and 91.3% (21/23) for subtype pdm09/ H1N1 detection, indicating higher sensitivity than conventional RT-PCR. Both these assays detected H3 subtype with equal sensitivity of 100% (7/7). For seasonal H1 subtype, sensitivity and specificity could not be determined due to small number of positive samples.
