We aim to summarize the proteomics technologies currently used for global identification and quantification of body fluid proteins, and elaborate the putative biomarkers discovered for a variety of human diseases through human body fluid proteome (HBFP) analysis. Some critical concerns and perspectives in this emerging field are also discussed. With the advances made in proteomics technologies, the impact of HBFP analysis in the search for clinically relevant disease biomarkers would be realized in the future.",

With the significant advances in MS and proteomics technologies [1] [2] [3] , protein biomarker discovery has become one of the central applications of proteomics. One might think tissue biopsy is the ideal specimen for disease biomarker study. However, in terms of disease diagnosis and prognosis, a human body fluid (e.g., blood, urine, or saliva) appears to be more attractive because body fluid testing provides several key advantages including low invasiveness, minimum cost, and easy sample collection and processing [4] . Analysis of human body fluid proteome (HBFP) has become one of the most promising approaches to discovery of biomarkers for human diseases.",

Numerous biomedical studies have demonstrated that plasma protein levels reflect human physiological or pathological states and can be used for disease diagnosis and prognosis [5, 6] . Sample preparation and handling is critical for plasma/serum proteome analysis. A plasma sample is obtained if the blood is withdrawn in the presence of an anticoagulant (EDTA, sodium citrate, or heparin) and centrifuged to remove blood cells. However, in the absence of an anticoagulant, a serum sample is obtained after the blood clots and cellular elements are centrifuged and removed. Serum protein composition largely differs from that plasma [7] . How to standardize the sample handling and preparation, and whether to use plasma or serum for proteome analysis are the questions that remain to be answered. A second critical issue is the complexity of the proteome. Plasma/serum contains a huge number of proteins differing by the extraordinary dynamic range of at least 9-10 orders of magnitude [8] . Many of these proteins are glycosylated or bound to other carrier proteins. How to globally quantify the proteins in free, bound, or modified forms remains a critical challenge.",

This is presumably because there are a wide range of preanalytical variables and also too many technology platforms currently used in the plasma/serum proteome analysis. Thus, it is not practical to define a single list of standard sample preparation and handling procedures for all the proteomics platforms [9] . However, in reality, this is extremely important during the biomarker development process, considering that a candidate biomarker needs to be repeatedly validated on large and independent sample cohorts usually in a format of multicenter studies. Several recent studies clearly indicated that sample handling variables such as clotting conditions and time, storage temperature, storage time, storage tube, freeze/thaw cycles, and protease inhibitors have significant effects on the results of plasma/serum proteome analysis. In general, the samples should be aliquoted and stored with minimization of thaw/refreeze cycles, preferably in frozen liquid nitrogen. Protease inhibitors would be desirable but inhibitor cocktails should be used with caution. Peptide inhibitors, e.g., high-concentration aprotinin, may interfere with MS analysis and several small molecule inhibitors such as PMSF and AEBSF form covalent bond with proteins [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] . In the process of whole blood coagulation, the cellular elements, especially platelets, can secrete a variety of components. Therefore, the blood cells should be removed immediately to provide optimal analyte stability. For investigators concerned about platelet contamination, options include filtration of the plasma through a 0.2-\u03bcm membrane filter double centrifugation of the specimen, and use of additives that minimize platelet activation, such as a mixture of citrate, theophylline, adenosine, and dipyridamole [12] . Overall, sample collection, preparation, and handling procedures should be consistent across the whole study. It is strongly recommended that one should carefully document the conditions of sample preparation and handling and diligently track all preanalytical variables. Certified reference materials can be developed for sample quality control and quality assurance [9] .",

Depletion of these highly abundant proteins is often desired prior to proteome analysis. The Cibacron blue dye method is a traditional way to deplete albumin. However, the binding of albumin to Cibacron blue dyes is nonspecific, and the sensitivity and specificity are not as effective as mAb-based immunoaffinity resin or columns [15] [16] [17] [18] . Removal of IgG can be realized with Protein G resins or columns [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] . Comparing to Cibacron blue dye and Protein G methods, immunoaffinity depletion using multiple affinity removal columns (MARC) is more effective because it can simultaneously remove multiple abundant proteins, with minimal carryover, high longevity, and minimal nonspecific binding [16, 17, 21, 22] . Immunodepletion can be effectively realized with IgY antibody microbeads or peptidebased affinity medium [23, 24] . Protein precipitation with TCA/acetone or NaCl/ethanol also appears to be useful for depletion of albumins [25, 26] .",

Those immunodepletion methods remove a good portion, but not all of the highly abundant proteins; however, more problematic is that these columns may also remove other proteins (e.g., cytokines) by \"nonspecific\" binding [27, 28] . A possible approach to address this problem is to disrupt the binding of low molecular weight (LMW) proteins to the carrier proteins albumin/IgG. For instance, partly denaturing conditions by adding 5 or 20% ACN may disrupt the binding between LMW and albumin/IgG, resulting in increased number of proteins detected under denaturing conditions when compared to native conditions. The presence of 5% ACN in serum provided better enrichment of LMW proteins compared to 20% ACN condition [26] . In addition, rather than depletion of highly abundant proteins, it would be promising to develop methods such as functionalized nanoparticles [29] to enrich the low abundant proteins/peptides or reduce the protein concentration range [30] .",

Multiplexing of these techniques, e.g., combining SEC with AEC or solution IEF with SDS-PAGE, can further enhance the resolving power [37] [38] [39] . In order to conclude which separation technique is more efficient for pre-fractionation of plasma/serum proteins, an HUPO/PPP study was carried out to compare SCX, slicing of SDS-PAGE gel bands, and liquid-phase IEF. Prefractionation based on SCX resulted in the largest number of identified proteins, followed by gel slices and then liquid-phase IEF. An important observation was that each of the methods revealed a set of unique proteins. Therefore, for comprehensive identification of plasma/serum proteins, several different pre-fractionation methods should be used in parallel [44] . Liquidphase IEF (ampholyte-free) appeared to be very effective for prefractionation of peptides. By using liquid IEF prior to LC-MS/MS analysis, 844 unique peptides were identified, corresponding to 437 serum proteins [45] . A total of 1444 proteins were identified when the liquid IEF fractions were further fractionated by SCX and then analyzed by LC-MS/MS [46] .",

The proteomics platforms tested included LC-FT-ICR MS [50] , antibody array [51] , [42] , and SELDI-TOF-MS [54] (Table 1 ). An important observation was that different platforms revealed a distinct subset of proteins and were more likely complementary toward identification of serum proteins [52] . A re-evaluation of three published plasma proteomic studies also indicated that there was minimum overlapping of proteins identified from different proteomics platforms. The proteins found through the literature search are strongly biased toward signal sequence-containing extracellular proteins, while the three proteomics methods showed a much higher representation of cellular proteins, including nuclear, cytoplasmic, and kinesin complex proteins [55] .",

Lectin affinity chromatography (LAC) is often used for enrichment of either glycoproteins or glycopeptides prior to MS analysis [67] [68] [69] [70] . The use of multilectin affinity column maximized the capturing of glycoproteins and therefore yielded a significant list of 150 glycoproteins in serum/plasma. A close correlation in glycoprotein profiles was observed between serum and plasma, except for the absence of fibrinogen found in plasma as a result of the clotting process. The glycoprotein profiles from three ethnic specimens, Caucasian American, Asian American, and African American, were found very similar except a higher angiotensinogen level and a lower histidine-rich glycoprotein level in Caucasian American samples, and a lower vitronectin level in African American blood samples [67] . The use of LAC for isolating both intact glycoproteins and glycopeptides (after proteolytic digestion) can further enhance the identification of glycoproteins. Using these affinity capturing steps and LC-MS/MS, a total of 86 Nglycosylation sites in 77 proteins in human serum were identified [70] . SEC was also found useful for significant enrichment of N-linked glycopeptides relative to nonglycosylated peptides because the N-linked glycans expressed on tryptic glycopeptides contribute substantially to their mass [71] . Recently, a new approach based on hydrazide chemistry for covalent capturing of glycoproteins was reported for broad analysis of human plasma Nglycoproteins [72] [73] [74] . Following the enzymatic digestion of the N-linked glycopeptides with N-glycosidase F, a 2-D LC-MS/MS analysis of the deglycosylated peptides resulted in the identification of a total of 2053 N-glycopeptides, representing 303 nonredundant Nglycoproteins [74] . This glycoprotein pull-down method can be incorporated with stable isotope labeling for quantitative analysis of glycoproteins in serum using MS/MS methods, such as LC-MS/MS or MALDI-TOF/TOF-MS [72, 73] . Serial LAC coupled with stable isotope labeling or global internal standard quantification strategy was reported for comparative analysis of sialylated glycoforms of proteins containing differentially branched complex-type glycans. The relative degree of sialylation among human serum glycoproteins or separated glycosylation sites within the same proteins were characterized and compared [75, 76] .",

The method requires comparison of identical proteolytic peptides in each of the two experiments to accurately determine relative ratios of the proteins. This relies on the accuracy of mass measurement and chromatographic reproducibility. Although relative quantification monitors changes in protein abundance between two conditions, it does not determine the absolute quantity of these proteins. Therefore, informatics tools are required for alignment of the LC-MS data. A number of factors need to be considered such as denoising, mass and charge state estimation, chromatographic reproducibility, and peptide quantification via integration of extracted ion chromatograms. An open-source software suite, SpecArray, was recently introduced to generate and visualize peptide arrays (signals) from LC-MS datasets, providing a useful software platform for quantitative LC-MS profiling [92] . LC-MS was also tested for absolute quantification of proteins without requiring the use of external reference peptides. A single point calibration was obtained for the mass spectrometer that was applicable to the subsequent absolute quantification of all other proteins within a complex mixture [94] . Multidimensional LC-MS/MS was demonstrated for the identification of 32 proteins significantly increased in concentration following in vivo lipopolysaccharide (LPS) administration, including inflammatory and acute-phase proteins [95] .",

A new method termed as intact-protein analysis system (IPAS), coupled with Cy dye labeling, was reported for quantitative profiling of human plasma proteome. Following immunodepletion, paired plasma samples were labeled with different Cy dyes and subsequently separated in multiple dimensions according to their charge, hydrophobicity, and molecular mass.

Quantitative MS analysis using multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) has been demonstrated for accurate analysis of a target protein and may serve as a powerful tool for the validation purpose [105] [106] [107] [108] .

The experimental formats for antibody array can be broadly categorized into two classes: (i) direct labeling experiments and (ii) dual antibody sandwich assays [109, 110] . In the direct labeling method, the covalent labeling of all proteins in a complex mixture provides a means for detecting bound proteins after incubation on an antibody microarray. If proteins are labeled with a tag, such as biotin, the signal from bound proteins can be amplified. A two-color rolling-circle amplification (RCA) method on antibody microarrays has been developed for measuring the relative levels of proteins captured on the arrays from two serum samples, labeled with biotin and digoxigenin, respectively. Two-color RCA can produce fluorescence up to 30-fold higher than directlabeling and indirect-detection methods on antibody microarrays, providing sensitive analysis of low abundant serum proteins [111] . In the sandwich assays such as cytokine and ELISA arrays, proteins captured on an antibody microarray are detected by a cocktail of detection antibodies, each antibody matched to one of the spotted antibodies. These sandwich-based arrays are extremely sensitive for low abundant cytokines or growth factors [112] [113] [114] [115] . The correct use and interpretation of antibody microarray data requires proper normalization of the data. A recent study compared seven different normalization methods for antibody microarray analysis and suggested that normalization with ELISA-determined concentrations of IgM resulted in the most accurate, reproducible, and reliable data [116] .",

A glomerular proteome array of 30 antigens known to be expressed in the glomerular milieu was constructed for studying serum autoantibodies in lupus. Human lupus sera displayed two distinct IgM autoantibody clusters, one reactive to DNA and the other polyreactive. This antigen array is promising for uncovering novel autoantibody disease associations and distinguishing patients at high-risk [124] . Recently, a novel phage protein array using a phage-display library derived from prostate-cancer tissue has been developed for detection of serum autoantibody signatures in prostate cancer. To construct a phage-display library of prostate-cancer peptides, mRNAs were isolated from prostate-cancer tissues of six patients with clinically localized disease. After the insertion of the cDNA fragments into the T7 phage system, peptides that were encoded by the prostate cancer cDNA were expressed and displayed on the surface of the phage fused to the C-terminal of the capsid 10B protein of the phage. This surface complex functioned as a bait to capture autoantibodies in serum. A 22-phage-peptide prediction model yielded 88.2% specificity and 81.6% in discriminating between prostate cancer and the control [125] .",

This study points to a new source of producing thousands of purified proteins for protein array fabrication. Peptide microarrays displaying biologically active small peptides in a high-density format provide an attractive technique to probe complex samples such as serum [141] [142] [143] . A technical difficulty in fabrication of peptide arrays is that peptides, usually with small molecular mass, are not easily accessible when adsorbed onto solid supports. Peptides also lack a well-defined 3-D structure, and therefore a correct orientation is essential to promote the interaction between peptides and their targets. Incorporation of elongated spacer molecules or modification of the solid substrate can significantly improve the accessibility of a target molecule [142] . In addition, protein arrays can also be prepared with the cellular proteins expressed in a cell line or the proteins expressed in a cell-free in vitro transcription/translation system [144, 145] .",

One strategy to overcome the shortcomings of single tumor biomarkers is to measure a combination of proteomic bio-markers to enhance the sensitivity and specificity.",

Most of the studies listed in Table 2 were performed using 2-DE/ MS or SELDI-MS. With the new advances in quantitative proteomics, we may expect more applications of isotope tagging/MS/MS, label-free LC-MS, or CE-MS methods in serum biomarker discovery. In addition, aberrant glycosylation of proteins is known to be closely associated with cancer progression. Considering many clinical bio-markers and therapeutic targets are glycoproteins (e.g., Her2/Neu, CEA, PSA, CA19-9, CA15-3, CA125, etc.), quantitative serum glycoproteome analysis using affinity capturing agents, and isotope labeling could be a promising approach in searching for cancer biomarkers.",

Acetone appears to precipitate more acidic and hydrophilic proteins, whereas ultracentrifugation fractionates more basic, hydrophobic, and membrane proteins [266] . The efficiency for precipitation of urinary proteins varies among different organic solvents. The highest recovery rate for urinary proteins was obtained from 90% ethanol and the lowest one was from 10% acetic acid. The ACN-precipitated urine sample produced the greatest number of spots on a 2-D gel, whereas the acetic-precipitated sample yielded the smallest number of spots [268] .",

In a CE-MS study, 16 differentially excreted polypeptides formed a pattern as early indicators of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), allowing discrimination of GVHD from patients without complications with 82% specificity and 100% sensitivity (crossvalidation) [307] . Similar CE-MS method was also applied to the assessment of renal damage in patients with Type I or II diabetes as well as in patients with IgA nephropathy [310] [311] [312] [313] . In a large-scale proteomic study, both 2-DE/MS and quantitative proteomics (isotope-coded affinity tags (ICAT)/2-D LC-MS/MS) approaches were used to compare the urinary proteomes between patients with Dent's disease and normal subjects. Several vitamin and prosthetic group carrier proteins, apolipoproteins, and complement components were found at higher levels in Dent's urine compared with normal urine, suggesting that such proteins are reabsorbed more efficiently than other classes of proteins. Conversely, proteins of renal origin were found in proportionately higher amounts in normal urine [308] . The urinary proteomic changes associated with interstitial and bacterial cystitis [314] , urolithiasis [315] , and pancreatitis [316] were also investigated. Differential expression of pancreatic secretory trypsin inhibitor and its proteolytic fragment was observed between patients with pancreatitis and normal control subjects, suggesting a possible role of the protein as a cause of hereditary pancreatitis.",

Analysis of brain-specific proteins in CSF is complicated by the fact that most of the CSF proteins are derived from the plasma, and highly abundant proteins tend to obscure less abundant proteins. In addition, the total protein concentration in CSF is very low at 0.3-0.7 mg/mL. Depletion of highly abundant proteins and sample pre-enrichment and desalting (e.g., precipitation or ultrafiltration) are often required prior to CSF proteome analysis [319] [320] [321] [322] [323] [324] . Two immunodepletion methods, IgY antibody microbeads and MARC, were recently evaluated. IgY antibody microbeads removed six CSF proteins: HSA, transferrin, IgG, IgA, IgM, and fibrinogen, whereas MARC removed HSA, transferrin, IgG, IgA, A1AT, and HG. 2-DE comparison indicated that MARC removed the major proteins more effectively, and approximately 50% more spots were visualized when compared to the 2-D gel of CSF without protein depletion [325] .",

Quantitative proteomics using ICAT was applied to the comparative analysis of CSF proteins from younger adults with those of older adults. More than 300 CSF proteins were identified, and 30 proteins exhibited >20% change in concentrations between older and younger individuals. These data supplied the necessary information to appropriately interpret protein biomarkers of age-related neurodegenerative diseases [331] .

Early diagnosis of degenerative diseases is important in initiating symptomatic treatment, and will be of even greater significance if drugs with a potential to slow down the degenerative process prove to have a clinical effect with the use of specific CSF markers. Discrimination of AD from controls and from other neurological diseases has been improved by simultaneous analysis of beta-amyloid (1-42), total-tau, and phosphorylated tau, where a combination of low levels of CSF-beta-amyloid 1-42 and high levels of CSF-tau and CSF-phospho-tau is associated with an AD diagnosis [335] [336] [337] . This may be further strengthened by the recent discovery of a number of putative CSF markers including apo A1, apo E, apo J, retinol-binding protein (RBP), kininogen, A1AT, cell cycle progression eight protein, alpha-2-HS glycoprotein (A2HSG), alpha-1 beta-glycoprotein, cathepsin B, amyloid precursor, complement proteins, glutathione independent prostaglandin D synthase [338] [339] [340] [341] [342] [343] . Developing these proteins as new biomarkers may lead to the early diagnosis of AD and provide useful information in drug trials. Another observation from these proteomic studies is that when investigating a CSF protein as a possible biomarker, it may be useful to compare individual protein isoform expression levels in addition to the more commonly measured total protein expression level [343] .",

Several proteins involved in FTD pathology were not influenced in the CSF of AD patients, and vice versa, establishing differences in the pathophysiological mechanisms between FTD and AD. Since FTD is commonly misdiagnosed as AD, these differentially expressed proteins may be used as indicators to distinguish FTD and AD, two of the most common neurodegenerative disorders [344] . MS is an autoimmune inflammatory demyelinating disease of the CNS. Disease mechanisms of MS at the molecular level remain poorly understood and the diagnosis of MS is challenging because of the lack of a specific diagnostic test [345] . CSF proteins, such as cartilage acidic protein, tetranectin, SPARC-like protein, autotaxin t, and a cleavage product of cystatin C, could be potential markers for MS diagnosis because they were predominantly identified in MS patients but not in the patients with non-MS inflammatory CNS disorders [346, 347] .",

The diagnosis of CJD is based on clinical and electroencephalographic criteria, and there is no practical and reliable premortem test for CJD and related TSEs. Early studies by immunoassay and 2-DE suggested that the 14-3-3 protein levels in CJD patients' CSF correlated with NSE levels, and therefore might serve as a marker for CJD disease [348, 349] . A follow-up study by 2-DE/Western blotting revealed multiple isoforms of 14-3-3 protein (14-3-3 beta, gamma, epsilon, and eta) were all present in the CSF of patients with CJD, and specific 14-3-3 isoform patterns could be used to differentiate CJD from other neurodegenerative diseases [350] . A panel of seven CSF proteins, including apo E, were found capable of distinguishing ante mortem variant CJD from ante mortem sporadic CJD [351] . The cellular prion protein (PrPc) is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored glycoprotein, which represents the substrate for the generation of a conformational pathogenic isoform (PrPsc) in prion diseases. Incredible microheterogeneity of PrPc in human CSF (60 2-D Western spots) was observed, presumably resulting from the PrPc glycosylated isoforms as well as N-terminally truncated fragments [352, 353] .",

Compared to non-SS subjects, parotid B2MG, lactoferrin, IgG kappa light chain, polymeric Ig receptor, lysozyme C, and cystatin C were found significantly increased whereas two proline-rich proteins, amylase, and carbonic anhydrase VI were found significantly decreased in the patient group [396] .

The current master gel of BALF proteins comprises more than 1200 spots visualized by silver staining [402] . Identification of proteins on 2-D gels was initially performed using immunoblotting, Edman sequencing, or matching to a reference gel [403, 404] , and this was significantly improved through the use of advanced MS identification techniques [405] [406] [407] [408] [409] . A large-scale proteomic analysis by using immunoaffinity depletion, SDS-PAGE fractionation, protein in-gel digestion, and subsequent nano-LC-MS/MS was reported for identification and semiquantitation of more than 1500 distinct proteins in BALF. Around 10% proteins displayed significant upregulation specific to the asthmatic patients after segmental allergen challenge. The differentially expressed proteins represent a wide spectrum of functional classes and the majority of the expression changes are closely associated with many aspects of the pathophysiology of asthma. This large portion of newly identified proteins in BALF has provided new insights for finding novel pathological mediators and biomarkers of asthma [408] .",

Patients of sarcoidosis, an inflammatory lung disease, exhibited an altered BALF proteome profile and many proteins at altered levels were identified as nonplasma proteins involved in the inflammatory and oxidant-antioxidant processes [411] . Differential BALF proteomic profiles were observed between patients suffering from sarcoidosis and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), two forms of interstitial lung disease characterized by different pathogenesis and clinical evolution. Sarcoidosis patients exhibited higher amount of plasma proteins, while IPF patients showed significant higher levels of LMW proteins, either involved in inflammatory processes (e.g., calgranulin) or antioxidant response (e.g., antioxidant peroxysomal enzyme and thioredoxin peroxidase) [412, 413] . A comparative analysis of BALFs from patients with sarcoidosis, IPF, and systemic sclerosis revealed that carbonylated proteins were up-regulated in BALFs of all disease patients and a greater number of protein targets of oxidation were present in BALF of IPF patients. This predicts that oxygen-derived free radicals produced by phagocytes may contribute to lung tissue damage occurring during diffuse lung diseases [414] .",

Distinct changes in protein patterns were observed between RA and OA patients, and altered levels of acute-phase proteins in SF were observed for the RA patients treated with antibody to CD4 [426] . Unlike other human body fluids, removal of abundant albumin and \u03b3-globulins from SF samples did not significantly improve 2-DE separation of SF proteins [423] . LC-MS screening of peptides in human SF indicated the presence of a peptide AGLPEKY (SAA (98) (99) (100) (101) (102) (103) (104) ) derived from SAA.

To confirm the finding about calgranulin B and to examine its applicability as a diagnostic marker, levels of the calgranulin A/B heterocomplex in plasma and in SF were further validated by immunoassays on patients of RA, OA, and other inflammatory joint diseases. It was found that plasma levels of the calgranulin A/B heterocomplex correlated well with levels in SF, and hence, determination of plasma levels could be used to distinguish RA patients from controls and patients with other inflammatory joint diseases. The plasma level of calgranulin A/B heterocomplex might also be useful for monitoring anti-TNFalpha therapy [429] . SF proteins, trappin-2, and anti-TPI autoantibody could be potential markers for OA diagnosis as they were detected predominantly in the OA patients [431, 432] .",

However, the identity of these proteins is not known. There are concerns about the reproducibility and reliability of peak quantifications using SELDI-MS. Therefore, new algorithms have been introduced to address the quality control, peak detection, or quantification in SELID. It was found that data denoising with the undecimated discrete wavelet transform improved the reproducibility of quantifications and detected more peaks than the method implemented in Ciphergen software [436, 438] . A 2-DE/MALDI-TOF-MS approach was used to characterize NAF proteome and discover potential NSF markers for breast cancer. A total of 41 distinct proteins were identified, including 25 ones known to be secreted [439] . Three proteins, gross cystic disease fluid protein (GCDFP)-15, apo D, and A1AG, were proposed as putative biomarkers and further validation confirmed the significantly altered levels of GCDFP-15 (down-regulated) and A1AG (up-regulated) in breast cancer. Recently, a quantitative proteomic approach, based on ICAT, SDS-PAGE, and LC-MS/MS, was employed to identify differentially expressed proteins in NAF from the tumor-bearing and contralateral disease-free breasts of patients with unilateral early-stage breast cancer.

A standard tear proteomic pattern from healthy individuals may serve as a reference to measure the success of treatment. Tear proteome profiling can also generate useful information for the understanding of the interaction between an eye and its contacting objects, such as a contact lens or a lens implant. This is important for designing improved eye-care devices and maintaining the health of an eye. TF analysis may be challenging because only a small volume of TF (<5 \u03bcL) can be collected in a clinical laboratory under normal operational conditions [441] . For some disease patients with minimum tear production, a saline \"flushing\" method can be used for collection of \"eye flush fluid.\" The content of TF can then be concentrated by ultracentrifugation for subsequent proteome analysis [442] .",

Two basement membrane-specific heparan sulfate proteoglycan proteins, perlecan and agrin, were found present in AF while they were absent from plasma samples of pregnant women [449, 450] . Presence of intra-amniotic infection (IAI) is often associated with preterm birth and adverse neonatal sequelae. Early diagnosis of IAI, however, has been hindered by insensitive or non-specific tests. By using SELDI-MS for AF profiling, a few putative markers, including human neutrophil protein (HNP) 1-3, calgranulin A, B, C, and insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 1, were found potentially useful for diagnosis of IAI [451] [452] [453] [454] .

However, there has been concern about the use of immunoaffinity depletion because it may remove associated proteins (e.g., cytokines) as well.

In order to develop robust protein markers in body fluids, some general steps and procedures should be followed: (i) analysis and characterization of the body fluid proteome, (ii) differential proteomic profiling, data analysis (normalization and statistical analysis), and prioritization of identified markers, (iii) validation on the new independent sample cohorts, (iv) establishment of prediction models, and (v) clinical utility testing. In these steps, a reasonable sample size (patient group and matched controls) should be warranted and a comprehensive and quantitative profiling of the body fluid is the key. Statistics is indispensable for data analysis and model building. Reliability of the data also highly depends on proper normalization of the data and aggressive validation on large sample cohorts.",

Unlike genomic profiling with microarray, current proteome analysis is far from comprehensive as evidenced by that the deepest portion of HBFP has not been probed by MS-based proteomics. Meanwhile, a majority of current proteomic technologies are not as rapid and high-throughput as microarray profiling. In order to meet the requirement for profiling a large number of clinical specimens, it is critical to advance the proteomics technologies toward a significantly higher level of comprehensiveness, throughput, speed, and accuracy. Quantitative proteome profiling is the key to unveil differentially expressed proteins associated with diseases. Isotope tagging/MS/MS and LC-MS in label-free format represent two promising methods for quantitative MS profiling of body fluids. Immunoassays are still extensively used for marker validation following proteomic discovery. However, these assays require a specific antibody or antigen to the protein of interest and therefore are not always available. Quantitative LC-MRM MS using synthetic isotope-labeled peptide as internal standard has been well demonstrated for protein quantification. This method may prove to be a powerful approach for the validation of biomarkers.",

Human cancers of epithelial origin may share similar molecular features at late stages. However, precancers or early-stage cancers are often localized and distinct.

In many cases, statistical tools can be used to estimate the minimum sample size needed, based on the random variations of proteins among proteomic samples and desired true-positive rate and falsenegative rate [462] .
