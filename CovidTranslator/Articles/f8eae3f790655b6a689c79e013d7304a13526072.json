            "text": "The purpose of this study was to develop a sensitive, rapid, and inexpensive immunofluorescence assay (IFA) using a recombinant porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) nucleocapsid protein for the serological detection of PCV2-specific antibodies in pig sera. The viral nucleocapsid protein encoded by the PCV2 ORF2 gene has recently been identified as the most immunoreactive viral protein that carries type-specific antigenic determinants. The ORF2 sequence of the IAF-2897 strain of PCV2 has been cloned into a pCEP5 eucaryotic expression vector under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter, downstream of a polyhistidine sequence tag. The recombinant plasmid was used in transfection experiments with human epithelial kidney 293 cells that were further tested, and positive expression of the viral nucleocapsid protein was confirmed by IFA and Western blotting. Strong, specific fluorescence was observed in the nuclei of transfected cells. Test specificity to PCV2 was verified with several related infectious agents. Sensitivity was compared to that of standard IFA using PCV2-infected cells by evaluating the reactivities of 44 field serum samples from pigs on farms with a porcine population suffering from postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome. The recombinant nucleocapsid-based test was able to detect 15 more positive-testing pigs than the PCV2-based IFA. Therefore, the relative sensitivity of the latter test was estimated at only 57.1% compared to that of the recombinant nucleocapsidbased test. The recombinant fusion protein has been purified by affinity chromatography and is being used to develop further sensitive serological tests.",

            "text": "Postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS) is an emerging swine disease first described in Canada in 1991 (7, 13) ; subsequent outbreaks have frequently struck pig farms in North and South America and in Europe and Asia (2, 3, 6, 15, 22, 28) . The disease affects 5-to 12-week-old piglets and is characterized in part by weight loss, dyspnea, jaundice, and enlarged lymph nodes as well as by degeneration and necrosis of hepatocytes, multifocal lymphohistiocytic pneumonia, lymphocytic depletion, and multinucleated giant cell formation (13) . Typically, morbidity rates can reach 5 to 50% in affected herds, and mortality is close to 100% in pigs that develop the full spectrum of symptoms associated with the disease (19) . The rapid and simultaneous emergence of the disease in many different parts of the world as well as the uncertain mode of transmission and high rates of mortality in pigs suffering from PMWS has caused great concern throughout the swine industry. The agent thought to be mainly responsible for PMWS has been identified; a circovirus-like particle isolated from diseased pigs was associated with the syndrome and named recombinant (rec) porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) (2, 11, 12) .",

            "text": "The first porcine circovirus, now known as PCV1, was discovered in 1974 as a nonpathogenic contaminant of the porcine kidney PK-15 cell line (27) . It has since been characterized as a small nonenveloped single-stranded DNA virus with a 1.76-kb ambisense genome (25) . Antibodies against the virus have been found in pigs worldwide, but no discernible pathogenic properties have been associated with PCV1 infection in swine (8, 10, 24) . PCV2 isolated from pigs suffering from PMWS displays a 76 to 83% amino acid identity with nonpathogenic PCV1 and shares the same genomic organization, consisting of two major open reading frames (ORFs) coding for the replicase protein (Rep) and the nucleocapsid (NC) protein, respectively (12, 18, 19) . The 702-nucleotide ORF2 sequence coding for the PCV2 NC protein is located on the complementary strand of the double-stranded replicative form of the PCV2 genome and shares only 66% amino acid identity with the sequence of the PCV1 ORF2, compared with an 85% identity between the ORF1s of both viruses (12) . These data have led scientists to speculate that the PCV2 NC protein may be at least in part responsible for the pathogenicity associated with PCV2. Recently, several studies have suggested that the 28-kDa PCV2 NC protein is the major immunogenic protein of the virus and the principal bearer of type-specific epitopes (14, 20) .",

Afshar (Animal Diseases Research Institute, Agriculture Canada, Nepean, Ontario, Canada). Cells were infected at a very low level of confluence with purified virus and grown in monolayers for 3 to 4 days in GIBCO minimal essential medium (Invitrogen, Burlington, Ontario, Canada) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum, 1 mM glutamine, 1% sodium pyruvate, and 100 M penicillin-streptomycin. When cells reached confluence, supernatant was removed and cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The virus was harvested by freezing and thawing the infected cells three times in a small volume of PBS. The resulting cell lysate was then clarified by centrifugation. Viral genomic DNA was extracted from stocks of virus with TriPure DNA isolation reagent (Roche Diagnostics, Laval, Quebec, Canada) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Transfection experiments were carried out with the human embryonic kidney 293 cell line (ATCC CRL-1573).

            "text": "The dramatic increase in reported outbreaks of PMWS in pig farms in recent years has been an additional burden for pig producers already under pressure from the threat of other pig pathogens, increased public scrutiny, and intense competition in the marketplace. Early detection of PCV2 in pigs is essential to help contain the spread of the virus and of PMWS. The goal of the present study was to conceive a very specific and extremely sensitive but low-cost and easy-to-use test to help in the diagnosis of cases of early PCV2 infection in pigs. The IFA is probably the most commonly used method for the detection of PCV2 antibodies in pig serum, as it is faster and less expensive than PCR tests and does not require specialized equipment. However, the use of live PCV2 to infect cells used in IFA has always been problematic at best. Because the virus does not produce a visible cytopathic effect in infected cells and replicates only in cells currently undergoing mitosis, PCV2 infections yield very small amounts of virus (1). The use of D-glucosamine to stimulate the entry of cells in the S phase of mitosis to accelerate the replication of PCV2 has been suggested previously (26) . However, it was also reported to be problematic because of its high level of cellular toxicity and therefore should generally be avoided when possible (1) . There is also evidence of antigenic cross-reactivity between the Rep proteins of PCV1 and PCV2, which could generate false diagnostic results. Recent studies have demonstrated that the ORF1-encoded proteins in the two viruses were antigenically related whereas the ORF2 proteins were recognized differentially by polyclonal anti-PCV2 antibodies (4, 16, 17) . No crossreactivity was demonstrated between the NC proteins of the two viruses (29) .",

In addition, transfections of 293 cells in 60-mm-diameter petri dishes under the same transfection conditions yielded significantly larger quantities of NC product than transfection of PKA cells infected with PCV2 under the same culture conditions. The addition of a polyhistidine tag to the recNC protein allowed quick and easy purification and concentration of the protein by affinity chromatography with a metal chelate affinity column. Purified and nonpurified recNC from cell lysate analyzed by Western blotting reacted strongly with PCV2-specific antibodies (Fig. 3) . As expected, the addition of the polyhistidine tag and the enterokinase restriction site to the NC amino acid sequence increased the molecular mass of the protein to roughly 32 kDa compared to about 29 kDa for the native protein. These results suggest that the recNC protein expressed in transfected cells is immunogenically identical to the native protein.",

            "text": "To determine whether recNC IFA using cells transfected with the pCEP-6H-ORF2 plasmid can be used as an accurate diagnostic tool for the detection of PCV2-specific antibodies in pigs, 44 swine serum samples from several porcine farms in southern Quebec that have had recurrent problems with PMWS outbreaks in the past years have been analyzed. Each serum sample was tested by classic IFA using a diagnostic protocol from local laboratories and by recNC IFA as described in the present study ( Table 2 ). The results strongly indicate that the recNC IFA was able to detect much smaller amounts of antibodies in serum, as evidenced by comparing several serial serum dilutions in each test, and it is therefore a much more sensitive assay. The sensitivity of the classic IFA was only 57.1% compared to that of the recNC IFA. Of the 44 serum samples tested, only three samples that were considered to be positive using the classic IFA were shown to be negative with the recNC IFA. This could be explained by the high amount of background fluorescence often observed in classic IFA, particularly at low serum dilutions. However, fluorescence in transfected cells is strongly localized in the cell nucleus even under conditions of incubation with low serum dilutions. It is noteworthy that both IFA tests were also used with sera collected at different times postinfection from piglets experimentally infected with PCV2. The recNC IFA was able to detect the presence of PCV2-specific antibodies in serum as early as 7 dpi compared to 14 dpi for the classic IFA.",

The sensitivity of the assay is much improved compared to that of the classic IFA method using virus-infected cells. This system is particularly advantageous, because very large amounts of protein can be rapidly and inexpensively produced compared to the results seen with PCV2 infections, which can be relatively difficult to perform and produce only small quantities of virus. In addition, the recNC protein can be immediately purified and con-centrated by affinity chromatography and can subsequently be used as an antigen for enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays and Western blot analyses and for further characterization studies. Additional work is necessary to determine whether the protein might be used as a subunit vaccine in pigs to prevent infection by PCV2.",
