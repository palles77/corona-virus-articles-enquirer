Twelve preweaned Holstein bull calves were blocked in pairs and randomly assigned as unexposed controls (n = 6) bedded with control sand, or exposed calves (n = 6) bedded with sand previously positive for M. bovis at a dairy farm. Bedding sand was cultured weekly. Nasal and ear swabs and sera were collected weekly, tracheal swabs were collected monthly, and by the end of the 105-d study, all calves were euthanized (n = 10) or died (n = 2). Sera were tested for M. bovis-specific antibody. Mycoplasma spp. culture was performed on nasal and ear swabs; culture and a PCR differentiating multiple Mycoplasma spp. were performed on postmortem samples of lung, retropharyngeal lymph node, and trachea from each calf. A complete necropsy also was performed. During 6 wk, mycoplasma concentration in exposed group sand was between 200 and 32,000 cfu/g. All 166 tracheal swabs, nasal and ear swabs, and postmortem tests from all calves were negative for mycoplasma. All 94 sera were negative for M. bovis-specific antibody. No gross pathology suggestive of mycoplasma disease was detected. The probability of mycoplasma detection, if an exposed calf had become infected 4 wk after exposure, ranged between 97 and 99% depending on time of exposure for individual calves. There was no evidence that sand bedding contaminated with M. bovis might serve as a source of transmission to na\u00efve dairy calves.",

            "text": "Holstein bull calves (n = 12) from a few days to 2 wk old from a farm with no evidence of mycoplasma in any cows or calves were sought. Mycoplasma among dairy calves is common; the percentage of dairy herds with at least 1 calf that has positive results for microbial culture of nasal swabs for Mycoplasma spp. has been reported between 80 and 92% (Springer et al., 1982; ter Laak et al., 1992) . Prevalence of Mycoplasma spp. (M. bovis is the single most common species isolated) among young dairy calves from 3 to 60 d old has been reported as greater than 50% (Muenster et al., 1979; Catry et al., 2008) . The sensitivity of diagnostic methods for detection of mycoplasma in an infected calf has been reported as approximately 25% for nasal or ear swabs (Thomas et al., 2002) and 75% for tracheal swabs (Marois et al., 2007) . Therefore, some assumptions were made to screen for a mycoplasma-free herd. Multiple dairy farms were visited, and 8 calves per farm from 7 to 60 d old were sampled using nasal and ear swabs. Sensitivity of mycoplasma detection was estimated as 25%, and mycoplasma prevalence (if the herd had any mycoplasma infections) was estimated at 50% of the calves; therefore, each calf tested was assumed to have a 12.5% probability (0.25 \u00d7 0.50) of testing positive for Mycoplasma spp. if the herd was positive. The probability of failure to detect the disease at the herd level in any given calf was (1 -0.125) = 0.875; using sequential probability, the probability of failing to detect mycoplasma in a positive herd (false negative herd status) if 8 of 8 calves tested negative was (0.875) 8 = 0.34 (i.e., a 66% probability that the herd was truly free of mycoplasma in calves). A dairy farm was eventually found where all 8 calves tested negative; the farm was revisited and 24 additional young calves were nasal and ear swabbed for mycoplasma and also all tested negative. With all 32 calves testing negative, the probability that the herd was truly infected and all mycoplasma test results were false-negative was (0.875) 32 = 0.013 (i.e., a 99% probability that the herd was truly free of mycoplasma in calves). After selection of the source herd, 12 additional bull calves were obtained for study on d 1 (n = 7), 31 (n = 3), and 38 (n = 2) of the study based on availability and physical examination by 2 of the authors (D. Wilson and A. Justice-Allen) . The study protocol was approved by the Utah State University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.",

For each calf, the probability of being detected positive by at least 1 diagnostic test if they truly became infected with mycoplasma beginning 4 wk after exposure to positive bedding sand was calculated. Because most calves are infected within 1 to 3 wk after exposure to mycoplasma, the assumption that 4 wk of exposure would be necessary before detectable disease resulted was a conservative estimate (Stipkovits et al., 1993; Catry et al., 2008) . Sequential probability was used to calculate the probability of all test results for a given calf being falsely negative if the calf became infected (failure to detect a true positive animal at least once). Beginning 4 wk after exposure to positive bedding sand, false-negative probabilities of 0.75 for nasal/ear swab tests were multiplied, and falsenegative probabilities of 0.25 for tracheal swab tests were multiplied. For example, 4 wk after calf 4 was exposed to mycoplasma-positive bedding, he was tested over the next 62 d with 7 weekly nasal/ear swabs and 2 monthly tracheal swabs; the probability of complete failure to detect infection if present was ( ",

This has practical implications considering mycoplasma has been found in bedding of dairy herds, including recycled bedding following a manure-separation process in association with mycoplasma mastitis (Justice-Allen et al., 2010) . Dairy producers whose herds have been found with mycoplasma mastitis, and whose farms have concurrently had mycoplasma detected in 1 Treatment group = exposed or control (not exposed) to mycoplasma-positive bedding. 2 Days after first exposure to mycoplasma = Remaining days the calf lived following the first exposure to mycoplasma-positive bedding, the time during which the calf could have contracted mycoplasma infection. 3 Days on mycoplasma-positive sand = Actual days the calf was bedded with mycoplasma-positive bedding; bedding was intermittently culture-positive. 4 Probability of detection if infected = Probability that the calf would have been detected as mycoplasmapositive (by at least one positive test result) if they had become truly infected 4 wk postexposure. This is calculated for control as well as exposed calves to allow for the possibility that they may have somehow become exposed to mycoplasma at the same time that exposed group calves did by contamination between calf treatment groups despite precautions taken. This shows the probability that calves would have been detected with mycoplasma if indeed they became truly infected. NA = Not applicable because the calf did not live until at least 4 wk after exposure.",

Intermittently positive culture results over time in the pile of sand used in this study had been observed previously as well; the earlier study found that mycoplasma was more likely to be recovered from the sand when the ambient temperature was between 15 and 20\u00b0C, and mycoplasma also was isolated on 2 occasions after the sand pile was moved, including the move to the location for the calf study reported here (Justice-Allen et al., 2010). Mycoplasma recovery from sand in the present study increased following the movement of the sand pile to the calf facility just before the start of the trial, and decreased and later ceased as colder winter temperatures arrived during the late weeks of the project. Nevertheless, the dose of Mycoplasma spp. found in the sand pile when it cultured positive during this experiment ranged between 200 and approximately 30,000 cfu/g. The infectious dose of M. bovis required for nasal transmission of disease to calves has not been demonstrated, but is presumed to be 100 cfu (Rosenbusch, 2003) . Therefore, every ounce of mycoplasma-positive bedding sand was likely to contain between 120 and 18,000 times the proposed infectious dose for mycoplasmal calf disease. Conditions in the calf hutches in this study were like those on commercial farms, and failure of mycoplasma-positive sand to be associated with disease was probably not caused by insufficient dose of the organism.",

Many calves in most dairy herds have an antibody against M. bovis by between 4 and 8 wk of age (Maunsell et al., 2009 ).
