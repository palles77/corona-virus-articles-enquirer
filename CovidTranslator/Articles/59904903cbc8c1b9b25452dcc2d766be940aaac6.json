The related feline enteric coronavirus (FECV) causes mild enteritis. Why these feline coronaviruses manifest so differently in vivo is not known. In this study, infection kinetics (titres and antigen expression) of FIPV 79-1146, and FECV 79-1683, were determined in peripheral blood monocytes from 3 donor cats and compared to those in Crandell feline kidney (CrFK) cells. The infection kinetics in monocytes were host dependent. Monocytes from 1 cat were resistant to both FIPV-and FECV-infection. Monocytes from the other 2 cats could initially be infected by both FIPV and FECV but FIPV infection was sustained in monocytes of only one cat. FECV-infection was never sustained and viral production was up to 100 times lower than in FIPVinfected monocytes. In CrFK cells, FIPV and FECV infection kinetics did not differ. In monocytes of a larger cat population (n = 19) the 3 infection patterns were also found. Considering all 22 investigated cats, 3/22 were not susceptible for FIPV and FECV. The rest could be infected with FECV and FIPV but 10/22 cats had monocytes that only sustained FIPV infection and 9/22 sustained neither FIPV nor FECV infection. * Both authors contributed equally.",

These feline coronaviruses are spread world-wide and infect cats and other members of the family Felidae. An infection with FECV is usually subclinical, except in young kittens where it may cause mild to severe diarrhoea [23] . In contrast, FIPV infection causes a chronic and very often fatal pleuritis/peritonitis. It is the most important cause of death of infectious origin in cats. Two forms of FIP exist: the effusive or wet form with the typical effusions in body cavities and the less common non-effusive or dry form [232] . Characteristic lesions of both forms are granulomas on the surface of target tissues. Despite the large biological differences, more than 98% of the genome is identical in FIPV and FECV isolates from the same environment [33] . Therefore, it has been proposed that FIPV arises from FECV by mutation but the exact mutation and the inducing factors have not yet been clarified [24, 34] .",

            "text": "The main difference between FECV and FIPV is the invasive nature of FIPV. FECV replicates mainly locally, in enterocytes of the intestine, whereas FIPV also infects blood monocytes and spreads systemically [37, 38] . The reason for this pathogenic difference is not understood. After infiltration of infected monocytes in the perivascular tissue, the infected monocytes and surrounding cells release numerous chemotactic and vasoactive factors [8, 9, 39] . This leads to vasodilatation and increased vascular permeability and attraction of new monocytes to the area, which can be infected in turn. The outcome of the inflammatory reaction is a characteristic vasculitis which causes the venules to leak large amounts of protein rich plasma into the body cavity. The release of progeny virus also leads to the formation of virus-antibody-complement complexes which are concentrated around the small venules in the target organs [15] . These complexes further activate inflammation.",

They found similar growth curves for FIPV and FECV. The replication of FIPV and FECV was also studied in peritoneal macrophages [29] . It was reported that FECV infected fewer macrophages and reached lower production titres than FIPV. The in vivo relevance of these infection studies is most likely higher than those performed in a continuous cell line.

Figures 3a and 4a show that the production of FIPV started between 3 and 6 h post inoculation for both cat 1 and 2. Between 12 and 24 h post inoculation there was a slight increase in virus titre for cat 1 whereas the curve from cat 2 (Figs. 3c and 4c) . The growth curves of cat 1 for FECV showed a low-level production ( Fig. 3b and d) . The growth curves of cat 2 for FECV began with a slight titre increase, similar to the FIPV growth curve, but then the virus titre decreased with a slope comparable to the inactivation curve ( Fig. 4b and d) . These findings suggest that monocytes could be infected by FECV but that the cells did not sustain a productive infection. Figure 5 shows that the growth curves for cat 3 followed the inactivation curve, suggesting that there was no progeny virus produced. (Fig. 6, lane 1) . Some showed a larger amount of surface-expressed viral proteins (Fig. 6, lane 2) . The antigen expression kinetics varied between the donor cats. Figure 3e and f show the FIPV and FECV cytoplasmic expression kinetics for cat 1. The percentage of FIPV infected cells with cytoplasmic expression increased till 24 hpi. The infection of monocytes with FECV initiated in the same manner but at 12 hpi the curve started to decline. The cytoplasmic expression in monocytes of cat 2 is shown in Fig. 4e and f. Infection with FIPV or FECV led to the same expression kinetics. After an increase till 6 or 12 h post inoculation the percentage of cells with viral expression decreased rapidly. The number of FECV infected monocytes was lower than the FIPV-infected monocytes. The FIPV and FECV surface expression, for both cat 1 and 2, followed the same curve as the cytoplasmic (Fig. 3g and h; Fig. 4g and h) . The results of cat 3 were quite different from cat 1 and 2. Here, viral antigen positive monocytes were not found.",

Virus particles were detected in the cells shortly after inoculation of the cells but no production of viral antigens was observed using polyclonal antibodies (data not shown). Thus, it seems that new viral proteins were not formed. This suggests that the block of infection is located after entry of the virus but before (or at) the translation step. In vivo, resistance to FIPV infection has been observed in experimental inoculations. After inoculation with a lethal dose of FIPV, a varying part of the cats (depending on experiment 8-50%) showed no clinical signs and some of them remained seronegative [24, 36] . This was also seen in control groups of vaccination trials (no vaccination, only FIPV challenged) [16, 27] . Resistance to FCoV infection has also been suggested to occur in natural infections in the field [1] . A small percentage of cats in FCoV endemic households had no shedding, remained seronegative or had a low antibody titre over a time period of 5 years. It would be most interesting to investigate the correlation between in vitro and in vivo resistance to FCoV. This might give perspectives for selection of cats insusceptible for FIP.",

This shows that the FIPV infection was sustained whereas the FECV infection was not sustained (second pattern). Monocytes from 9 cats did not sustain both FIPV and FECV infection since the number of viral antigen positive cells dropped after 6 or 12 hpi (third pattern). The drop in antigen positive cells after 6 or 12 hours post inoculation may be explained by the fact that the infected cells died due to infection and were washed away during the staining. However, the same kinetics were found with staining in suspension, a technique which prevents cell loss (data not shown). Another explanation is that monocytes stopped producing viral proteins and assembling new virions. The extracellular virus titres showed indeed that (almost) no new progeny virus was produced between 12 and 24 hours post inoculation. Some graphs show differences in virus titres between 2 experiments (with the same virus and with monocytes from the same donor cat) of up to 2 log 10 units. These differences are intrinsic to working with primary cells and are reported in viral infection studies with porcine and equine monocytes as well [21, 30] .",

In several studies, healthy cats from FCoV endemic households were investigated [5, 10, 13, 14, 19, 28] . In such households, where the FCoV was most likely FECV, a part of these healthy cats were viraemic for FCoV. FCoV was detected both in plasma and in monocytes. Therefore, it may be hypothesised that when FECV reaches the blood circulation, the lack of sustainability and long-term production of progeny virus (the total virus production was up to 100 times lower in FECVinfected monocytes) may be the reason for the lack of disease progress. This might form the basis for the difference with FIPV since FIPV infection is sustained and reaches higher titres. However, the non-sustained FECV infection, might also be attributed to the virus strain that was used. Although FECV 79-1683 is a reference strain, it may act differently from other FECV strains due to its deletion in the 7b ORF [35] . It has been described that loss of the 7ab ORFs results in loss in virulence [11] . It could be that this loss in virulence is translated in loss of the ability to replicate efficiently in monocytes. Thus, whether the hampered replication of strain 79-1683 in monocytes is a universal property of FECV strains or only of 7b deleted/mutated strains, remains to be determined.",

In an infection kinetics study where another cell type, feline peritoneal macrophages, was used, different results in the antigen expression kinetics were obtained [29] . The number of FECV infected peritoneal macrophages was lower than the number of FIPV infected peritoneal macrophages throughout the infection kinetics. Since the viral antigen kinetics was only performed till 14 hours post inoculation, a possible drop in antigen expression, like reported here, could not be evaluated. In contrast, our results suggest that FIPV and FECV can initially infect the same amount of cells but at 24 h post inoculation, differences in sustainability of the infection are prominent. Since the same viruses were used as in our study, the different results are most probably due to cellular factors and/or a different differentiation status of the cells. Differences in susceptibility depending on the differentiation and/or activation status of the monocytes/macrophages has been reported for different viruses such as porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus, caprine arthritis-encephalitis virus, suid herpes virus 1, herpes simplex virus, human immunodeficiency virus type 1 and maedi-visna virus [4, 20, 40] .

            "text": "What this variation in susceptibility and sustainability means for the pathogenesis of FECV and FIPV in vivo, remains to be elucidated. In an inoculation study using FIPV 79-1146, different patterns of disease progression were detected, based upon survival time: progressors (rapid, intermediate and delayed) and survivors (prolonged and long-term) [3] . With natural in vivo FCoV infection, different clinical outcomes (besides resistance to FCoV) have been described: persistent carrier, transiently infection and development of FIP [2] . It is not clear what the viral and host factors are that determine the different clinical outcomes. Since in the inoculation study the same strain (FIPV-79-1146) was used and considering the fact that in the field cats are often infected with the same strain of FCoV, it is likely that genomic variation between cats contributes to a different clinical outcome. A genetic background was also suggested during a field study with pure-bred cats, in which it was shown that susceptibility to FIP is indeed inheritable [7] . A possible explanation for the different disease progression is the possibility of the cats to develop an efficient T-cell response [3] . However, it could also be that the susceptibility of the monocytes to FIPV plays a role, considering the results presented here. It would be interesting to investigate if cats that show a different outcome to an experimental or natural infection also show different infection kinetics in vitro. This might be important since a correlation between in vitro and in vivo infection kinetics would allow easy screening and selection.",

However, only a part of the infected cells showed surfaceexpressed viral antigens. On 24 hpi, 87% of the infected CrFK cells and 49% of the infected monocytes showed surface-expressed viral antigens. S-and Mproteins, but no N-proteins were found on the cell surface of both CrFK cells and monocytes using specific monoclonal antibodies (data not shown). This indicates that the observed surface expression does not represent virus particles. Possible explanations for the observed differences in amount of surface-expressed viral antigens could be the retention of a part of the viral proteins or spontaneous internalisation of the surface-expressed viral antigens. Retention of viral proteins has been described for porcine coronavirus [26] . Spontaneous internalisation of viral proteins has been described for suid herpes virus 1 [32] .",

Binding of virus-specific antibodies to viral proteins present on the surface, makes infected cells recognisable for the classical complement pathway, phagocytes and natural killer cells, which will lead to lysis of the infected cell [12] . Interestingly, not all FIPV-and FECV-infected monocytes/macrophages showed surface expression. Absence of viral proteins on the cell surface has been described for other viruses, such as human cytomegalovirus and equine herpesvirus 1 as a strategy to avoid recognition by the antibody-dependent immune responses [6, 31] . Why only half of the infected cells showed surface expression and whether the cells without surface expression are indeed less susceptible towards antibody-dependent complement mediated lysis, remains to be elucidated.",

The results of this study reveal that the CrFK cell line is not the best suitable in vitro model for the study of FIPV and FECV replication at a cellular level. Firstly, the course of infection of FIPV and FECV is similar in CrFK cells, whereas in monocytes there is a clear difference (as there is in vivo). Secondly, a high percentage of infected cells can be reached in CrFK cells (up to 90% of the inoculated cells) with each cell producing and releasing a relatively small amount of infectious virus (<10 viruses/cell). In monocytes on the other hand, less than 1% of the cells can be infected, but a single FIPV-infected monocyte releases up to 200 new infectious viruses. Thirdly, CrFK cells showed surface expression in almost all infected cells, in contrast to monocytes, which showed surface expression in only half of the infected cells.",

If monocytes are susceptible to FCoV infection, then both FIPV and FECV can infect them. However, FECV infections are never sustained and production of viral antigens and progeny virus ceases at 24 h post inoculation. Sustainability of a FIPV infection depends on the origin of the host cells. FIPV production in susceptible monocytes was always 10 to 100 times higher than FECV production. What this variation in susceptibility and sustainability implicates for the development and pathogenesis of FIP and/or FECV in vivo, remains to be elucidated.",

Between 12 and 24 hpi, there was a vast increase of infected cells. At 24 hpi, 86% of the cells showed cytoplasmic expression of viral proteins and 75% surface expression. There is no significant difference (area under the curve) between the FIPV curve and the FECV curve. The amount of infectious virus produced per cell can, theoretically, be calculated from the virus titres and the percentage of infected cells. For both FIPV-and FECVinfected CrFK cells, productivity was less than 10 infectious viruses per infected cell.",

Surface expression was only detected in an average of 49% of the infected monocytes (24 hpi). No differences in the amount of infected cells with surface expression were seen between the cats or between FIPV and FECV infection.
