            "text": "Redirecting the splicing machinery through the hybridization of high affinity, RNase H-incompetent oligonucleotide analogs such as phosphoramidate morpholino oligonucleotides (PMO) might lead to important clinical applications. Chemical conjugation of PMO to arginine-rich cell penetrating peptides (CPP) such as (R-Ahx-R) 4 (with Ahx standing for 6-aminohexanoic acid) leads to sequencespecific splicing correction in the absence of endosomolytic agents in cell culture at variance with most conventional CPPs. Importantly, (R-Ahx-R) 4 -PMO conjugates are effective in mouse models of various viral infections and Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Unfortunately, active doses in some applications might be close to cytotoxic ones thus presenting challenge for systemic administration of the conjugates in those clinical settings. Structureactivity relationship studies have thus been undertaken to unravel CPP structural features important for the efficient nuclear delivery of the conjugated PMO and limiting steps in their internalization pathway. Affinity for heparin (taken as a model heparan sulfate), hydrophobicity, cellular uptake, intracellular distribution and splicing correction have been monitored. Spacing between the charges, hydrophobicity of the linker between the Arg-groups and Arg-stereochemistry influence splicing correction efficiency. A significant correlation between splicing correction efficiency, affinity for heparin and ability to destabilize model synthetic vesicles has been observed but no correlation with cellular uptake has been found. Efforts will have to focus on endosomal escape since it appears to remain the limiting factor for the delivery of these splice-redirecting ON analogs.",

Both assumptions have had to be re-visited since cellular uptake does involve endocytosis (2) and transport of biomolecules does not occur as efficiently as anticipated at least at low concentrations. In a series of experiments carried out independently by several groups, CPPs mentioned above turned out inefficient in transporting uncharged splice correcting oligonucleotide (ON) analogs as peptide nucleic acids (PNA) or phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers (PMO) for a large part because CPP-conjugated material remained entrapped in endocytic vesicles (3) . Accordingly, peptides or drugs (such as chloroquine) leading to endosome destabilization did significantly increase splicing correction.",

Increased cellular uptake could not be the answer since, on the contrary, (R-Ahx-R) 4 -PMO conjugates were taken up less efficiently than Tat-PMO and (Arg) n -PMO conjugates in our model system (3) . Differences could originate from a different mechanism of cellular uptake with (R-Ahx-R) 4 -PMO conjugates taking profit of a more favorable route than the other CPP conjugates. Again available data did not support this hypothesis since all three conjugates were taken up by an energy-dependent pathway involving binding to cell surface proteoglycans. Along the same lines, we recently established that blocking energy-dependent processes through incubation of cells at low temperature or through ATP depletion decreased splicing correction by (R-Ahx-R) 4 -PMO conjugates and by Tat-PMO or (Arg) n -PMO ones to the same extent (10) .",

Fluorescence microscopy evaluation of the intracellular distribution of FAM-labeled (R-Ahx-R) 4 -PMO conjugates indicated that the majority of the material was entrapped in endocytic vesicles even at concentrations leading to efficient splicing correction. It implies that the biological activity of these conjugates is due to the small (and not detectable by fluorescence microscopy) portion of material escaping from endocytic vesicles. Finally, (R-Ahx-R) 4 -PMO conjugates have shown signs of toxicity when injected to mice at >20 mg/kg dose despite their absence of cytotoxicity in cell culture experiments (12) .

(18) in particular have shown that a 6-carbon 6-aminohexanoic acid linker seemed optimal for cellular uptake as measured by the whole cell fluorescence but no data concerning efficiency in terms of cytoplasmic or nuclear delivery of a biologically functional payload was provided. We therefore designed a series of (R-X-R) 4 -PMO conjugates with X varying from 2 to 8 carbons (compounds 1-7 in Figure 1A ). The present study revealed a dependence of charge spacing with an optimum for (R-Ahx-R) 4 (in which X = 6) in terms of nuclear delivery of the PMO payload as illustrated below. Based on this first set of data, we designed a series of C6 linked-Arg peptides differing in terms of hydrophobicity (compounds 8-11 in Figure 2A ).",

All (R-X-R) 4 -PMO conjugates have therefore been synthesized as FAM-labeled derivatives and their intracellular distribution has been analyzed by fluorescence microscopy on live cells to avoid artefactual redistribution upon cell fixation. As shown in Figure 6A for the parent (R-Ahx-R) 4 -PMO-FAM conjugate, most of the material was distributed as punctate cytoplasmic material and none was detected in the nuclei. Splicing correction is probably due to the small amount of material which has escaped from the endocytic vesicles and remains undetectable by fluorescence microscopy analysis. Not surprisingly, a similar situation has been observed for other (R-X-R) 4 -PMO-FAM conjugates from our SAR studies and no concluding data have been provided by fluorescence microscopy comparative analysis (data not shown). Likewise, previous work from several groups including our own one had documented an increase in splicing correction upon treatment with endosomolytic agents such as chloroquine or calcium ions (3) . However, splicing correction never reached levels achieved with 2-OMe ON analogs transfected as lipoplexes and accordingly redistribution of the endosome-entrapped material could not be documented (21) . We now capitalize on a saponin treatment protocol which allows to gently permeabilize the plasma membrane. It was shown to open transient holes in the plasma membrane and to allow the passage of macromolecules while not damaging membranes from intracellular organelles (22) .",

Late endosomes are characterized by a rather unusual lipid composition enriched in LBPA (23) and have a pH 5.5 lumen (24) . We therefore prepared liposomes from a lipid mixture mimicking the lipid composition of late endosomes DOPC/DOPE/PI/LBPA (5:2:1:2) and monitored the effect of low pH on the CPP-PMO induced leakage of a fluorescent dye entrapped in the lipid vesicles. We compared conjugates 1, 5, 9 and (Arg) 8 -PMO. All conjugates induced a fairly modest leakage that was strongly promoted at pH 5.5. In correlation with the data on splicing activity, (R-Ahx-R) 4 -PMO conjugate was by far the most active in this group, followed by (R-G-R) 4 endosomal escape is a major contributing factor for the efficient nuclear delivery of these CPP-PMO conjugates.",

Importantly as well, (R-Ahx-R) 4 -PMO conjugates lead to a sustained expression of dystrophin in skeletal muscles when injected intraperitoneally (5 mg/kg) in DMD mice (25, 26) .

A series of (R-X-R) 4 -PMO conjugates with a X linker extending from two to eight atoms have been compared in terms of cellular uptake, splicing correction efficiency and affinity for heparin ( Figure 1B and R. Abes and H. Moulton). As expected, heparin (chosen as a model heparan sulfate) affinity decreased significantly with an increase in X linker length and with a decrease in cationic charges density ( Figure 1B ). In keeping with this observation, cellular uptake as monitored by FACS analysis decreased in parallel ( Figure 4) . However, the ranking of these (R-X-R) 4 -PMO conjugates in terms of splicing correction efficiency had a bell-shaped profile with (R-Ahx-R) 4 -PMO being significantly more efficient than (R-G-R) 4 -PMO ( Figure 1C and data not shown).

Being too hydrophobic might conceivably lead to entrapment into membranes and as a consequence might be detrimental to endosomal release. The parent and most active (R-Ahx-R) 4 -PMO conjugate was rather resistant to proteolytic degradation in serum but was still cleaved by cellular proteases (11) . It was thus anticipated that the (r-Ahx-R) 4 -PMO in which some L-Arg residues have been replaced by their D-analog would become more protease-resistant and as a consequence more active in the splicing correction assay. Unexpectedly, (r-Ahx-R) 4 -PMO was significantly less active than (R-Ahx-R) 4 -PMO thus indicating that metabolic stability is not a limiting factor at least in these in vitro experiments. Whether (r-Ahx-R) 4 -PMO might be of interest for in vivo applications will have to be evaluated using transgenic murine models for splicing correction. Whether the lower biological activity of (r-Ahx-R) 4 -PMO could be due to its increased affinity for heparin is a possibility. Alternatively, earlier work from our group (11) has shown that the peptide part of (R-Ahx-R) 4 -PMO was rapidly degraded in cells thus releasing free PMOs. It is fully possible that the more stable CPP entity may decrease the rate of endosomal release of PMO. Along the same lines, linking a splice correcting PNA and a CPP (R 6 Pen in this case) by a stable linker gave rise to a lower efficiency than in the case of a reducible disulfide linker (27) .",
