Treatment is the same as for the non-pregnant population and most drugs are safe in pregnancy. Educating women to continue preventer inhaled corticosteroid therapy will reduce the risk of attacks. Respiratory infections are associated with a higher morbidity in pregnancy and should be treated aggressively. Most chronic pulmonary diseases do not alter fertility. Large reserves in respiratory function allow the fetus and mother to survive without compromise in most cases. The use of chest X-rays should not be avoided in pregnancy. Women with a chronic respiratory disease should receive pre-pregnancy counselling and education. Women should be managed in a multidisciplinary setting with the respiratory team. The presence of pulmonary hypertension and cor pulmonale is associated with a high risk of death in pregnancy.",

This is in part an effect of the physiological adaptation of the respiratory and vascular systems to pregnancy and in part because of limited functional capacity and mobility from diaphragmatic elevation by the gravid uterus in late gestation. Oxygen consumption is increased by 20% from early pregnancy, minute ventilation by 40-50% secondary to tidal volume increase, and maternal hyperventilation results in a mild fully compensated respiratory alkalosis (increased arterial pO 2 and decreased arterial pCO 2 , compensatory fall in serum bicarbonate to 18-22 mmol/l; arterial pH 7.44).",

It affects up to 7% of women of childbearing age. It may present with episodes of wheeze, shortness of breath, chest tightness or cough. Signs classically include a diffuse, bilateral, expiratory (7inspiratory) wheeze and tachypnoea but are often absent. There may be an associated personal or family history of atopy and recognised triggers include pollen, dust, animals and infections. Objectively the diagnosis may be confirmed by measuring the peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) or forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV 1 ) as an indication of the degree of bronchoconstriction. A 420% diurnal variation on X3 days in a week for 2 weeks on PEF diary or FEV 1 X15% increase after a trial of a b 2 agonist or steroid tablets or a similar decrease after 6 minutes of exercise are diagnostic.

Severe poorly controlled asthma resulting in episodes of maternal hypoxaemia could, however, give rise to such complications. It is therefore of concern that many women stop their medication at the start of the pregnancy because of concerns regarding the safety profile of these drugs for the fetus.

It results from a gene deletion in 70% of cases and has a carrier frequency of 1 in 25 caucasians. A resultant defect in the CF transmembrane conductance regulator protein causes impaired movement of water and electrolytes across epithelial surfaces. Formerly, CF patients rarely lived to adulthood, but improvements in treatment have meant more women with CF are now reaching reproductive age and wish to become pregnant. The signs and symptoms of CF vary, depending on the severity of the disease and the degree of bacterial infection. Some cases are very mild and may not be diagnosed until adulthood. CF is characterised by the production of very thick and sticky mucus. The ducts leading from the pancreas become obstructed, causing pancreatic insufficiency, diabetes and malnutrition. About 90% of CF cases involve the lungs with recurrent or persistent infections, development of bronchiectasis and respiratory failure. A productive cough is almost always present, and very often patients appear barrel-chested. Frequent hospitalisations are a result of recurring respiratory, gastrointestinal and nutritional problems.",
