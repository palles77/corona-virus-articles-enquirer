We calculated the proportion of children randomized who were HIV infected, as the average (weighted by annual enrolment into the study) of the HIV seroprevalence of antenatal women in this community from the national seroprevalence survey of women attending public antenatal clinics in South Africa (Department of Health, Pretoria, South Africa). From 1998 -2000 the seroprevalence for this community increased from 22.5% -27.8% with a weighted average of 24.87%. Using a vertical transmission rate in this community at that time estimated at 26% (Gray, GE, McIntyre JA, Lyons, SF, XI th International Conference on AIDS, Vancouver, 1997, Abstract Th.C.413), the estimate of the prevalence of HIV infection in children in this community is 6.47%. No respiratory viral vaccine, including influenza vaccine, was provided during the course of the study, and there was little likelihood of access to these vaccines by children in the study as children receive their immunizations from the Expanded Programme on Immunization in South Africa which does not provide influenza vaccine. Parents or legal guardians signed written informed consent prior to enrollment of the children and approval for the study was obtained from the Committee for the Study of Human Study doctors examined all admitted children, and were responsible for determining the presence/absence of clinical signs, on the day of admission. Study-doctors were not however involved in the management of children. We performed blood cultures on all hospitalized children using an automated system (BacT -Alert, Organon, Teknika).",

We performed viral testing until September 1998 at the National Institute of Virology, South Africa, and thereafter at the Respiratory and Meningeal Pathogens Research Unit. Briefly stated, we performed respiratory viral screening using an indirect immunofluorescence assay (Light Diagnostics Respiratory Panel 1 Vital Screening and Identification Kit, Chemicon International Inc, Temecula, CA, USA) that included a pool-screen for any of the investigated viruses, which was followed by screening for influenza A, influenza B, PIV 1-3 and adenovirus. As we did not subtype PIV consistently throughout the study, the results for PIV type 1-3 include virus due any of the PIV subtypes. We screened all specimens for RSV. We performed shell-vial culture of samples testing negative for RSV, but positive on the respiratory viral panel pool screen when specimens were processed at the National Institute of Virology. We performed only indirect immunofluorescence without shell-vial culture on specimens processed at the Respiratory and Meningeal Pathogens Research Unit.",

We compared proportions using the Pearson Chi square test or the 2tailed Fischer exact test if the expected cell value for any observation was \u22645. We designed the trial to end follow-up with the occurrence in the per protocol analysis of invasive disease cases in the non-HIV+ population sufficient to obtain 80% power to detect 70% vaccine efficacy. We determined that simultaneously with this endpoint approximately 380 cases of WHO-AC pneumonia cases would be obtained in the non-HIV+ve population. This provided 80% power to detect 26% vaccine efficacy. WE thus designed the trial with sample sizes large enough to detect quite low VE against WHO-AC pneumonia. The power available with 95% confidence to make the observations found on vaccine efficacy against total clinical pneumonia, and pneumonia with any identified virus in fully immunized HIV uninfected children are 95.8% and 91.5%",
