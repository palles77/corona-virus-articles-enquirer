The involved viruses cluster together with isolates from China from 2011 and 2012 (5) .

One nonsynonymous single-nucleotide variant (variant position G19042U, amino acid substitution S6348I) was detected in the polyprotein coding sequences. Of note, 7 single-nucleotide variants are located in the aforementioned variable region in the S protein coding sequences, 5 of which are nonsynonymous (Table) , thereby confirming the high variability in the N terminal part of the S protein. Because quite extensive differences (\u224850 aa) were found between the recent N terminal S protein region of the isolates from Germany and the highly virulent PEDV strains from the United States and China, the isolates from Germany described in this article seem to not be directly linked to the highly virulent PEDV strains circulating in the United States (Figure 2 ). In contrast, the recent isolates from Germany and strain OH851 share not only high identity over the entire genome, including the highly variable 5\u2032 region of the S protein coding sequences, but also their clinical phenotype observed under field conditions.",

Comparative analyses of full-length sequences revealed that the isolates from these pigs in Germany show very high nucleotide similarity with strain OH851 found in the United States in 2014. However, differences exist that distinguish the strains from Germany from the highly virulent PEDV strains that caused the major losses in the United States. Given the fact that PEDV surveillance has been lacking in Germany, we cannot exclude the possibility that the strains described here have already been circulating in Europe for a longer time or were indeed recently introduced from the United States or Asia to Europe. Therefore, our report provides useful information about recent PEDV strains in Europe, but a comprehensive evaluation is still difficult because of a lack of data about additional strains. Future studies should therefore concentrate on analysis of additional PEDV from different years and locations. ",
