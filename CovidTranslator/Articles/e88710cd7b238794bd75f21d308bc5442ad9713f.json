            "text": "The common cold is one of the most prevalent acute illnesses worldwide. It is implicated in about 40% of time lost from employment and 30% of time lost from education. 1 Most adults contract two to four colds per year, whereas children can have as many as 10 colds per year, producing substantial expenditure for physician office visits and over-the-counter cold and cough remedies. 1, 2 The infection is self-limiting. It usually resolves within 7 days, but many colds persist for up to 3 weeks and are due to various viruses. Although it is known that rhinovirus infections cause 10%-40% of colds, 1 with coronavirus, parainfluenza virus, adenovirus, echovirus, and coxsackie virus accounting for the remainder of cases, 3, 4 these viruses produce clinically indistinguishable disease, 5, 6 making specific viral diagnosis difficult. Available remedies act only to alleviate the cold symptoms (sneezing, nasal stuffiness and discharge, and myalgia) and have no true therapeutic benefit toward eliminating the viral challenge. 2, 7, 8 Echinacea, a member of the Compositae family, is a herb widely used to treat and prevent common illnesses, 9 as it has been shown to have immunostimulatory properties. 10 Three out of the nine species in this family are of medicinal interest (Echinacea angustifolia, E. pallida, and E. purpurea). They are commonly used to treat viral upper respiratory tract infections. 11 Echinacea causes an increase in numbers of circulating white blood cells, activation of phagocytosis by human granulocytes, and elevation of body temperature, 12 resulting primarily from the aerial portion of E. purpurea 13 and the root portion of E. pallida. 13 Previous research suggests that Echinacea may be most effective at reducing the severity and duration of the common cold when taken early in the illness 14, 15 but has little to no preventive benefit. 16 A review of five randomized, clinical trials investigating the immunomodulatory activity of Echinacea concluded that Echinacea may be an efficacious immune stimulator. 17 Garlic (Allium sativum) is one of the oldest medicinal plants used by different cultures. The oldest reports of healthpromoting properties of garlic date back to the16th century BC, when in the Ebers Papyrus from Egypt over 20 ailments were purported to be efficiently cured by garlic. 18 Garlic stimulates the immune system and acts as a natural antibiotic not harmful to friendly bacterial flora. Many laboratory studies have confirmed the antibacterial, antifungal, antivirus, immunostimulating, and antioxidant properties of garlic. [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] In 1990, the US National Cancer Institute initiated the Designer Food Program to determine which foods played an important role in cancer prevention; they concluded that garlic may be the most potent food with cancer-preventive properties. 24 Nigella sativa is the black seed referred to by the prophet Mohammed as having healing powers. It is also identified as the curative black cumin in the Holy Bible and is described as the Melanthion of Hippocrates and Discroides and as the Gith of Pliny. 25 The effect of N. sativa on immune responses was evaluated in human volunteers. The results showed that black seed enhanced by 55% the ratio between helper T cells (CD4) and the suppressor T cells (CD8), and a 30% average enhancement of the natural killer (NK) cell activity. 26 N. sativa has also established efficacy against several species of pathogenic bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa) and pathogenic yeast (Candida albicans). 27 Extracts of American ginseng (Panax quinquefolium) have been shown to have immunomodulatory effects. [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] These extracts have been shown to enhance immune responses such as immunoglobulin production by lymphocytes and natural immune responses by peritoneal exudate macrophages. 28 They have also been found to enhance anticomplementary and reticuloendothelial system activities, 29 enhance macrophage Fc receptor expression, 30 increase the phagocytosis index along with phagocytosis fraction, 31 and induce messenger RNA expression of interleukin-2 (IL-2), interferon-gamma (IFN-\u03b3), interleukin-1, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor as well as lymphokine-activated killer cells and CD8+ cells. 32 In addition, these extracts appear to stimulate cell-mediated immune response and NK cell cytotoxicity, 33 as well as to have cytotoxic effects on a wide range of tumor cell lines without major histocompatibility complex restriction. 34 Ginseng extract was found to effectively prevent acute respiratory illness due to influenza and respiratory syncytial virus by 89% in a clinical trial involving elderly people living in institutions. 35 Vitamin C, (ascorbic acid), is a water-soluble vitamin found in fruit and vegetables, particularly citrus fruit. It is necessary for iron absorption, wound healing, and collagen formation. 36 Vitamin C is also recognized as being important to the successful production of neurotransmitters and improvement of glucose metabolism; its deficiency results in the neurological disease of scurvy. 37 Vitamin C's association with immune strengthening is derived from its ability to enhance the function of the immune system, including antimicrobial and NK cell activities, macrophages, lymphocyte proliferation, chemotaxis, and delayed-type hypersensitivity. 38 Zinc salts have been found to inhibit rhinovirus replication in vitro at concentrations of ,0.1 mmol/L, 39 possibly by interfering with rhinovirus protein cleavage. 38 Alternatively, it has been suggested that zinc salts may protect plasma membranes against lysis by cytotoxic agents such as microbial toxins and complement. 40 The proposed protective mechanism is either via immunomodulation 41, 42 or via the binding of zinc ions to rhinovirus surface canyons, thus inhibiting viral interactions with intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), the site of rhinovirus binding to cells. 43 Because ICAM-1 is also the binding site for leukocyte function associated antigen-1 (LFA-1), the block of LFA-1/ICAM-1 binding has been postulated to possibly suppress inflammation. 43 Several randomized, controlled clinical studies showed a beneficial effect of using zinc for treating the common cold, particularly when zinc is started within the first 24 hours of onset of symptoms. [44] [45] [46] [47] Immumax in management of common cold Immumax, a product of Beovita-Safe Pharma, an Egyptian-German pharmaceutical company, is a combination of natural herbal extracts, including Echinacea extract 120 mg, garlic powder 100 mg, Nigella sativa oil 200 mg, and Panax ginseng extract 50 mg plus vitamin C 50 mg and elemental zinc 7.5 mg.",

The first capsule was administered just after enrollment at the clinic to assess initial tolerability. Participants were asked to take no other cold preparations during the study period apart from acetaminophen for symptomatic relief of pain or fever on an as-needed basis. Oral thermometers were given to the patients at the time of enrollment. All patients were asked to revisit at day 1 after the start of treatment and within 1 day of noting that their cold symptoms had resolved. At this visit, they returned unused capsules so that adherence to the protocol could be checked through capsule counts and the treating physician could confirm that cold symptoms had resolved.",
