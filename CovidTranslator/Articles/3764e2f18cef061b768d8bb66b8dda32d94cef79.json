            "text": "Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) has caused enormous economic losses to the swine industry worldwide in recent years. Puerarin (PR), a major isoflavonoid isolated from the Chinese herb Gegen, possesses many pharmacological activities, including anti-inflammatory, and anti-viral activities. This study was conducted with both PEDV-infected African green monkey kidney cells (Vero) and neonatal pigs to determine the effect of PR on PEDV infection and to elucidate the underlying mechanisms by using proteomic analyses. Twenty-four piglets fed a milk replacer were randomly allocated into one of three groups (Control, PEDV, and PEDV + PR). After a 5-day period of adaption, piglets (n = 8/group) in the PEDV + PR were orally administered with PR (0.5 mg/kg body weight) between days 5 and 9, whereas piglets in the other two groups received the same volume of liquid milk replacer. On day 9, piglets were orally administered with either sterile saline or PEDV (Yunnan province strain) at 10 4.5 TCID 50 (50% tissue culture infectious dose) per pig. On day 12 of the trial, jugular vein blood and intestinal samples were collected. In addition, Vero cells were assigned randomly into three groups (Control, PEDV, PEDV + PR). Cells in the PEDV and PEDV + PR groups were infected with PEDV at a multiplicity of infection of 0.01, while cells in the control group were treated with the same volume of sterile saline. One hour later, cells in the Control and PEDV groups were cultured in serum-free DMEM, while cells in the PEDV + PR group were supplemented with PR. After 36 h of culture, cells were harvested. PR attenuated the reductions in cell proliferation in vitro and growth performance in PEDV-infected piglets, and inhibited PEDV replication and the expression of several cytokines (including IL-8) both in vitro and in vivo. Proteomic analyses identified that the abundances of 29 proteins in the ileum were altered by PEDV infection and restored to the control level by PR. Pathway analyses revealed that PR restored the expression of several interferon-stimulated genes and selectively upregulated the expression of guanylate-binding proteins. Western blot analyses showed that PR supplementation inhibited the PEDV-induced NF-\u03baB activation.",

The soluble protein was collected after the removal of tissue debris by centrifugation (12,000 \u00d7 g, 20 min, 4 \u2022 C). The protein concentration was quantified by the bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay (25) . Approximately 200 \u00b5g of proteins from each sample was subjected to filter-aided sample preparation (FASP) trypsin digestion to generate peptides. Briefly, protein samples were diluted to 100 \u00b5l with 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate, and disulfide bonds in protein were reduced by treating the sample with 2 \u00b5l of 500 mM DL-dithiothreitol (DTT) in 100 \u00b5l of 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate for 150 min at 37 \u2022 C (the final concentration of DDT was 10 mM), and then alkylated with 14 \u00b5l of 500 mM iodoacetamide (IAA) at room temperature (25 \u2022 C) for 40 min in the dark (the final concentration of IAA was 60 mM). The detergent, DTT, and other low-molecular-weight components were removed by repeated dilution in 100 mM Tris-HCl UA buffer (containing 8 M urea, pH 8.5), followed by filtration through 10-kDa ultrafiltration units (Pall Corporation, USA). The filters were washed three times with 100 \u00b5l of UA buffer, followed by twice washes with 100 \u00b5l of 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate. Proteins were then digested using mass spectrometry-grade trypsin (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) in 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate by incubation overnight at 37 \u2022 C and 800 rpm. The enzyme:substrate ratio was 1:50. The effluent was collected after centrifugation at 10,000 \u00d7 g for 15 min and filtered twice with 50 \u00b5l of 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate. The effluent was combined and then acidified with 10% trifluoroacetate (TFA) to stop the reaction (the final concentration of TFA was 0.4%). The resulting peptides were desalted using a Pierce C18 Tips (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) and vacuum-dried. Prior to LC-MS/MS analysis, peptide samples were re-suspended in 40 \u00b5l of 0.1% v/v formic acid (FA) and 5% v/v acetonitrile (ACN) solution.",

Owing to the lack of the appropriate antibodies for porcine tissues, qRT-PCR was alternatively used to validate the expression of IFIT3, OAS1, and GBP2. Likewise, a consistent trend of gene expression was observed among these groups of piglets ( Figure 10B) .

Traditional vaccine strategy cannot either provide a full protection for piglets or ensure a satisfying control of PEDV infection and spreading. Therefore, the development of safe, effective, and inexpensive antiviral drugs remains a great challenge to modern medicine. PR is a natural isoflavonoid extracted from Gegen in the traditional Chinese herb medicine. As a potential antiviral drug, effects of PR on PEDV infection are unknown. To date, although the proteomic technique has been widely applied to virushost interaction studies, little information is available about the protein profiles of piglets infected with PEDV. In the current work, we determine the effect of PR on PEDV both in vitro and in vivo with the goal of elucidating the underlying mechanisms by a proteomic analysis. PEDV can cause acute and watery diarrhea, vomiting, dehydration, and high mortality in neonatal piglets (43) , and its adverse effect on growth performance of piglets was demonstrated by Curry et al. (44) . Consistently, in the present study, PEDV infection resulted in a significant reduction in piglet ADG, but PR administration substantially alleviated the reduction of ADG, indicating that PR has a positive effect on the growth performance of PEDV-infected piglets. Although the reduction in diarrhea rate was not statistically significant due to the small sample size, the decreasing trend in diarrhea rate and the weaker clinical symptoms indicated that the piglets in the PEDV + PR group were recovering better from illness. Similarly, dietary supplementation with soy isoflavone increased ADG and reduced the incidence of diarrhea in weaned piglets challenged with lipopolysaccharide (45) . These results support the notion that isoflavonoid could be used to treat diarrhea (46) . Our findings further demonstrated that PR could alleviate reduction in the growth performance of PEDV-infected piglets.",

Similar results were found for the N and M protein levels, which were determined by the proteomic analysis (data not shown). These results indicated that PR could inhibit the replication of PEDV at different stages of its life cycle. Nevertheless, additional comprehensive studies are needed to verify this notion. In the current work, in vitro studies were performed with monkey cells and in vivo studies with piglets. Although they are different species, both of them are highly susceptible to PEDV, and PR could inhibit the replication of PEDV in both species. This suggests that PR was effective against PEDV in vitro and in vivo. Jejunal and ileal villus enterocytes are the main targets of PEDV replication (47) , and PEDV also appears in feces and mesenteric lymph nodes (48) . Consistently, we found that the piglet small intestine was the main target of PEDV.

This result indicated that PR possessed an anti-inflammatory effect, which is consistent with the previous reports that the expression of genes for inflammatory mediators (e.g., IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and TNF-\u03b1) were reduced by PR administration under inflammatory conditions (11, 54) .

In this study, nearly all of the overlapped DRPs (29/31) between the PEDV and Control groups or between the PEDV + PR and PEDV groups were reversely regulated by PR intervention, which could be clearly visualized by the heat-maps. Several functional enrichment analyses highlighted the importance of the interferon signaling pathway. Specifically, IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 and several ISGs were selectively upregulated at mRNA or protein levels in response to PEDV infection. This result is inconsistent with the previous report that PEDV antagonized interferon response (10, 55) . Because almost all of the previous studies were conducted in vitro, the inconsistency may be attributed to the fact that results of in vitro experiments may not accurately reflect the situation in vivo. Moreover, an in vivo study performed by Annamalai et al. (56) demonstrated that serum IFN-\u03b1 could be augmented at the early stage of PEDV infection. Of particular interest, PR administration appeared to regulate the interferon signaling pathway by maintaining the expression of IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 and ISGs at their normal physiological levels. It is noteworthy that GBP2, interferon-inducible guanylate-binding protein 2, was markedly upregulated in the PEDV + PR group. GBPs play an important role in antiviral infection (57) . Further studies are warranted to determine whether PR exerts an antiviral effect by regulating GBP2 expression. Overall, these results indicated that PR regulated the interferon signaling pathway in PEDVinfected piglets.",

Additionally, the quantitative proteomic analysis revealed that PR administration regulated the interferon signaling pathway in PEDV-infected piglets. Furthermore, PR attenuated NF-\u03baB activation in the ileum. Taken together, these findings suggest that PR protected against PEDV infection via regulating the interferon and NF-\u03baB signaling pathway. Our results are expected to aid in the development of effective antiviral feed additives and also have important implications for the production of veterinary drugs and human medicine.",
