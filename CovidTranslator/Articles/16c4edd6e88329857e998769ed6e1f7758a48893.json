The criteria for proving causality are complex and include (besides recognition of the clinical syndrome) serological diagnosis, identification of specific viral antigenemia, and detection in glomerular structures of viral antigens and host antibodies. According to Koch's postulates, the etiological link should be confirmed by complete cure following eradication of the virus, but this is not always possible. The concentration of viral antigens is higher in tissue than in the circulation, where antigens are complexed with specific autoantibodies. Virological and molecular analy sis of pathologic tissues by in situ hybridiza tion, polymerase chain reaction and ultra structural analysis led to successful detection and identifica tion of the virus. It should be noted that tubular uptake of viral particles is common and does not necessarily establish an etiological link with renal disease. Improvement of the renal disease concomitant with clearance of the suspected antigen, or recurrence of glomerulonephritis following reinfection, are additional clinical criteria.",

            "text": "Different mechanisms are operative in different viral nephropathies (Box 1). In acute glomerulonephritis, direct viral infection of the glomerulus induces proliferative changes following release of cytokines. 1 The nephropathy is reversible in most cases if the virus is rapidly cleared. In chronic forms of glomerulonephritis, persistent viral infection provides continuous antigenic stimulation, resulting in antibody production and formation of immune complexes. Studies indicate a role in the disease pathogenesis for these immune complexes, which can be derived from the circulation or formed in situ. 2,3 Viral proteins cause inflammatory renal diseases via synthesis of various mediators that can cause sclerosis and worsen glomerulopathy. 4, 5 Viral infections can cause many glomerular diseases. The diagnostic criteria for virus-related nephropathy include detailed clinical and laboratory data, and tissue molecular analysis. Several mechanisms are involved in the pathogenesis of virus-related nephropathy, including tropism of the virus in the kidney, induction of abnormal immune complexes, direct cytopathogenic effects, and multiorgan failure. Hepatitis B virus is associated with membranous nephropathy and mesangiocapillary glomerulonephritis in endemic areas. Hepatitis C virus causes various forms of glomerulonephritis, including cryoglobulinemia-mediated glomerulonephritis. Infection with HIV is associated with a collapsing focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, a distinctive disease that affects mainly Africans and African Americans. In the course of HIV infection, other types of immune complex glomerulonephritis can occur, most frequently in whites. Recent reports indicate a role for parvovirus B19 in 'idiopathic' collapsing focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. Both hantaviruses, and coronaviruses associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome, can lead to acute renal failure. Renal biopsy followed by appropriate serological and molecular testing is essential for defining virus-related glomerular lesions and guiding prognostic and therapeutic evaluation.",

HBV itself is not cytopathic; hepatitis develops as a result of the host's immune reaction to infected hepatocytes. HBV uses reverse transcriptase to transcribe RNA into DNA. Unlike retroviruses, however, HBV DNA is not integrated into host cell DNA during replication. After an HBV particle binds to and enters a hepatocyte, HBV DNA enters the cell's nucleus and is converted into covalently closed circular DNA. This highly stable genetic material acts as the intermediate template for transcription of RNA copies. This pregenomic messenger RNA is transported to the cytoplasm. It has dual functions: acting as a template for synthesis of new HBV DNA, and carrying genetic information to direct synthesis of viral proteins.",

Treatment for HBVassociated renal disease should ideally achieve the following objectives: (i) amelioration of nephrotic syndrome and its complications; (ii) preservation of renal function; (iii) normalization of liver function and prevention of hepatic complications of HBV; and (iv) permanent eradication of HBV. Because of the involvement of immune complexes in the disease, immunosuppressive therapy-similar to that used in the idiopathic form of the disease-was once fashionable. Corticosteroids were reported to provide symptomatic relief in isolated cases. The contemporary view, however, is that steroid and cytotoxic agents can cause deleterious hepatic flares or even fatal decompensation by enhancing viral replication when the drugs are withdrawn. 31 Another approach is treatment with an antiviral agent. Interferon-\u03b1 is a naturally occurring cytokine produced by B lymphocytes, null lymphocytes, and macrophages that exerts antiviral, antiproliferative and immuno modulatory effects. While reportedly useful in children, 32 interferon-\u03b1 has produced mixed results in adults with HBV-associated membranous nephropathy. 21, 26 Introduction of the nucleoside analog lamivudine has revolutionized the treatment of chronic HBV infection. 33 Lamivudine is the (-)-enantiomer of 3'-thiacytidine. This analog inhibits DNA synthesis by terminating the nascent proviral DNA chain through inter ference with the reverse transcriptase activity of HBV. In children and adults with HBV-asso ciated membranous nephropathy, lamivudine has been anecdotally reported to induce remission of nephrotic syndrome and to suppress viral replication. 24, 34 In a recent analysis comparing 10 adult nephrotic patients with HBV-related membranous nephropathy who received lamivudine with 12 matched historical control subjects who presented in the pre-lamivudine era, lamivudine significantly improved proteinuria, aminotransferase levels, and renal outcome over a 3-year period. 25 Randomized studies in a larger cohort of patients are needed to prove this effect.",

Before the association between HCV and cryo globulinemic MCGN was established, steroids and cyclophosphamide were the mainstays of treatment. Our awareness of this link has facilitated a more rational approach to management of this condition. Controlled trials have shown that antiviral therapy with interferon-\u03b1 is asso ciated with improvements in systemic symptoms of immune complex disease. Unfortunately, posttherapy relapse occurs in a large pro portion of patients, particularly when interferon monotherapy is administered in short courses. Introduction of combination therapy with interferon-\u03b12b plus ribavirin was an important milestone in the treatment of chronic hepatitis C. 48 This cocktail has also produced favorable results in mixed cryo globulinemia, although non-responses and relapses after initial improvements still occur. 49 The introduction of pegylated forms of interferon (peginterferon) in 2000 was another breakthrough in treatment of chronic hepatitis C. Recent data on peginterferon and ribavirin combination therapy are encouraging. 50 An increased rate of treatment failure in carriers of HCV genotype 1 has been recognized. 51 Observational studies support the effectiveness of peginterferon and ribavirin combination therapy in HCV-associated cryoglobulinemic MCGN. One therapeutic drawback is the hemolytic effect that complicates ribavirin therapy, particularly in patients with functional renal impairment. This difficulty has been overcome by adjusting the dose according to glomerular filtration rate instead of body weight alone, and utilizing recombinant erythropoietin to combat anemia. Post-treatment renal biopsy showed histological improvement in two of three patients who received combination therapy for 12 months. 52",
