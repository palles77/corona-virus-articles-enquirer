In particular, it articulates the changing competitive dynamics between LCCs and full-service carriers (FSCs). The Lotka-Volterra (LV) model, utilising the newly proposed moving-window concept, is used for the assessment of the influence of LCCs on the South Korean and airline industry. Analysis results demonstrate that the competitive dynamics between LCCs and FSCs are not static and have evolved over time. The study proposes an efficient and effective change analysis and enables strategic planning for aviation industries.",

            "text": "Since the launch of Southwest Airlines in 1971, the concept of lowcost carriers (LCCs) has flourished across the globe. One of the most prominent consequences of the emergence of LCCs is the growth of the tourism industry (Chung and Whang, 2011; Olipra, 2012; Tsui, 2017) . Numerous authors have explored the impact of LCCs on tourism in different countries, such as Saudi Arabia, Poland, Spain, New Zealand, and Italy (Alsumairi and Tsui, 2017; Olipra, 2012; Pulina and Cort\u00e9s-Jim\u00e9nez, 2010; Rey et al., 2011; Tsui, 2017; Vera Rebollo and Ivars Baidal, 2009 ). Regardless of the geography of the assessed markets, all these studies unanimously conclude that the introduction of the LCCs increases tourism demand. In other words, it can be said that LCCs induce their own new market. LCCs have also altered the business dynamics of the entire aviation industry by competing against the previously dominant full service carriers (FSCs) (Pels, 2008) . Researchers have also explored the impact of LCCs on different aviation markets; however, the conclusions are conflicting and vary across regions. For example, some researchers reported that LCCs have failed to compete against the FSCs in Australia, as happened earlier in the USA, and UK (Forsyth, 2003; Graham and Vowles, 2006; UK Civil Aviation Authority, 2006) . However, studies assessing South Korea, Europe, Western Europe, South Africa, and Taiwan show LCCs competing successfully against FSCs (Alderighi et al., 2012; Chung and Whang, 2011; Dobruszkes, 2006; Fourie and Lubbe, 2006; Lu, 2017) . This indicates that LCCs may have different impact on the aviation markets in different geographies, as highlighted by authors such as Zhang et al. (2008) . However, few attempts have been made to refine the approach for assessing the dynamics of LCC-FSC competition and address the element of conflict; this lacuna is addressed in this study.",

            "text": "This study is advanced with the recognition that the success and failure of the LCCs may vary across geographies, and the dynamics of the aviation market are yet to be fully analysed. We build our study on the assumption that the competitive nature of LCC-FSC competition is not static; this leads to different conclusions, depending on the interval chosen for the analysis period. With this, we attempt to answer the following questions: 1) for the general aviation market, do LCCs induce their own new market without competing with the FSCs or do they, in fact, compete with FSCs in the same market? (2) can both these phenomena occur simultaneously because of non-static competition dynamics over time? (3) how does LCC-FSC competition fare in the presence of other means of fast transport, such as high-speed train? (4) how does the market growth (shrinking or expanding) affect the competition? To answer these questions, we apply the Lotka-Volterra (LV) model to the South Korean aviation market and address its enhanced scope by applying a moving-window LV model. The LV model is the first, and by far the most commonly used model to investigate competition dynamics. As the LV model cannot detect changes in competition dynamics over time, a moving-window technique is used to overcome this limitation.",

This impact is usually known as \"Southwest effect\" as the term first coined by the US Department of Transportation (Freiberg and Freiberg, 1998) . Freiberg and Freiberg (1998) explained that Southwest effect has three main elements; i) increased supply with low costs creating competition for existing airlines, ii) pre-existing airlines decreasing the air fare, and iii) sales rise for all airlines. Donzelli (2010) explains the economic side of LCCs by presenting how LCCs have played an important role in the regional economic development by promoting an increase in traffic demand, international tourists, and job opportunities.",

Despite many studies, it is still not confirmed whether LCCs compete with FSCs or the LCCs market is completely different from the FSCs market. Some researchers concluded that LCCs do not compete against FSCs, and if they do, they do so only partially (Forsyth, 2003; Gillen and Morrison, 2003; UK Civil Aviation Authority, 2006) . In contrast, some authors are convinced that LCCs have succeeded in gaining a competitive advantage over FSCs (Chung and Whang, 2011; Franke, 2004; Fu et al., 2006) . Franke (2004) reported that LCCs compete with FSCs, and can deliver 80% of the service quality at half the cost of conventional carriers. In addition, Skeels and General (2005) showed that LCCs compete with FSCs, and also create their own new market demand. However, these studies lacked an explanation of how and why these two phenomena occur simultaneously. This study proposes that the literature which does not find competitive behaviour between LCCs and FSCs basically refers to the early stages of LCC development when LCCs had a very niche product. This study addresses the fact that competition dynamics may change over time, and in the case of South Korea, these two phenomena occurred in two stages; initially, LCCs competed against FSCs and once LCCs established their own new market, the LCC-FSC competition reduced.",

By 2005, when it was already evident that the price had overtaken comfort as the main factor in the aviation market, Hansung Airlines adopted the low-cost business strategy and claimed to be the pioneering LCC of South Korea. Full emergence of LCCs occurred after the global economic crisis of 2008, when three more LCCs emerged in the South Korean aviation industry.

Seoul has another airport, Incheon airport, but it operates mainly international flights, and as depicted in Fig. 2 the domestic load is very low. The Gimpo-Jeju route has emerged the busiest in the world (Smith, 2016) . The thirdranked airport is Gimhae, located in Busan. The Gimpo-Busan route has been shrinking after the emergence of the Korean Train Express (KTX) in 2004; however, the line between Seoul and Busan is the busiest of all lines (see Table 2 ). Fig. 3 shows the monthly passenger demand data for KTX on the Seoul-Busan route. Based on the statistics depicted in Fig. 2 and Table 2 , we consider three different scenarios, as illustrated in Table 3 . In the first case, to get an insight into the overall market, we attempt to evaluate cumulatively the LCC-FSC competition for all the air routes originating from the Gimpo airport; the routes are highlighted by dotted lines in Fig. 2 . In the second case, we analyse the busiest route in the world (Gimpo-Jeju) as its represents the South Korean tourism market from an aviation perspective; other tourism spots are usually accessed by other means of fast transport, such as rail and road.

We plotted passenger demand during the last 20 years for this case in Fig. 4 ; this shows that the traffic on the route fluctuated between 1997 and 2003. After 2003, it dropped remarkably till 2009 and finally began to expand after 2013. Initial fluctuations are due to improvements in bus services, particularly in 1998, whereas later drop is due to the 2004 introduction of KTX on this route. However, the market initially stabilised and finally began growing after the strategy shift of Asiana Air (premium services) to Air Busan (LCC owned by Asiana Air) in 2008-2009. As it can be observed that Asiana Air stopped its premium services right after the launch of its LCC services in the form of Air Busan, we consider Asiana Air and Air Busan as a single entity against Korean Air. Therefore, we attempt to evaluate the competition between Korean Air and Asiana Air/Air Busan in case 3 to observe how the competition dynamics change in shrinking market considering the presence of potential competition from KTX and the change in Asiana Air's business strategy from premium services to LCC. 3.1.

However, if the c 1 is negative, x will have a negative growth with increase in the y. The signs of c i determine the type of interaction, and its magnitude depicts the strength of the interaction. Based on the combination of signs of c i , there can be three types of possible interactions-cooperation, competition and predator-prey. Cooperation and competition can each be further divided into two sub-categories. Table 5 summarizes these relationships from airline perspectives. Using the conventional method LV data fit for case 1 is presented in Fig. 5 . From the figure, it can be seen that from the beginning, LCCs has a continuous upward trend and seasonality. FSCs data are also seasonal and show that the entrance of LCC led to a drop in FSCs demand till 2012-2103 but it is now regaining its previous volumes. The interaction parameters presented in Table 6 are both positive; therefore, referring to Table 5 , it can be inferred that LCCs and FSCs cooperate with each other in case 1 (mutualism). However, it can be easily observed from a visual inspection of Fig. 5 that FSCs demand fluctuated after the emergence of LCCs. Such changes in competition dynamics are not detectable by using the conventional LV model. The conventional LV model is developed using (1) and (2) for all three cases, where the non-linear least square method is used to determine the modal parameters. The resulting equations are represented as (2), (4), (5), (6), (7), and (8). Where, f represents monthly passenger demand for FSCs, l represents for monthly passenger demand for LCCs. Similarly, K represents monthly passenger demand for Korean Air and A represents combine monthly passenger demand for Asiana Air and Air Busan. Table 6 represents the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) between data and predicted values, and p-values for all three cases; reflecting the goodness of fit and significance of interaction parameters, respectively.",

This study addresses this limitation by integrating the moving-window technique with the LV model. This approach involves consecutively moving a data segment of a fixed length interval by one period through the entire data set to calculate the interaction parameters for each data segment, as illustrated in Fig. 6 . We selected 4 years of data as the starting window and moved it by one month to calculate interaction parameters. Selection of window size is critical as too small a window may provide wider values for 95% confidence intervals (CI), which implies poor precision in the estimation of parameters. However, too wide a window may provide narrow CI but it reduces the number of observations for estimated parameters; this results in information loss. We performed experiments with 3-and 5-year windows as well, but finally selected the 4-year window based on narrow CI.",

Fig. 7 shows that the relationship is not mutualism for all periods, but rather shows a parasitic relationship (commensalism) for some time then a switch in roles halfway through; this supports our motivation of observing changing dynamics over time. Fig. 7 (a) represents dependence of the growth of FSCs on LCCs demand; it shows that FSC did not gain any benefit from of LCCs initially, but began to do so later. The opposite is true for LCCs, where the dependency of LCCs growth on FSCs has decreased over time (Fig. 7[b] ). We can summarise our results by saying that in the early years of the emergence of LCCs within the FSC-dominant market, a parasitic behaviour of LCCs on FSCs is observed. However, the role is reversed in the subsequent years and the competitive dynamics between FSCs and LCCs evolved to a parasitic behaviour of FSCs on LCCs. It is important to understand that dependency of the growth of LCCs on FSCs decreased over time but the growth of LCCs kept increasing (see Fig. 5 ), which indicates that LCCs created their own new market by attracting the new customers.",

The FSC-LCC competition analysis was divided into three different cases. The analysis of the overall domestic market was followed by a more in-depth analysis of Gimpo-Jeju route (expanding market) that connects the country's capital and a key national tourism hotspot (case 2). The analysis of first two cases revealed a similar mutual cooperative relationship (+, +) between LCCs and FSCs; in this situation both entities (LCCs and FSCs) benefit from each other's growth. In both of these cases the market is expanding. In this situation there is a competition between carrier types and that is the reason average fares decrease and volumes increase. So the mutual benefit is probably due to the fact that market is not saturated yet and still expanding. This situation changes over time, as was detected by the 4-year moving-window assessment to both datasets. The analysis results showed that relationship is not consistently mutual (+, +); rather, there is alternating commensalism (+, 0 to 0, +), which means FSCs growth did not depend on LCCs at first, while LCCs enjoyed a synergistic growth, along with that of FSCs. The earlier commensalism relationship (+, 0) of LCCs and FSCs is the reflection of the real-world case, where both Korean Air and Asiana Air failed to react to the sudden emergence of LCCs. Therefore, LCCs succeeded in abruptly gaining market share. In effect, LCCs generated a market of their own. Right after the economic crisis of 2008, there was an explosive growth in the aviation market. As a temporary approach to deal with the emergence of LCCs, Asiana Air and Korean Air deployed their own low-cost and premium-service flights. Meanwhile, both airlines adopted the strategy of airline-within-airline strategy as well. The effect of both the reactive measures can be observed in our LV model. The result is that FSCs now enjoy the benefit from growth of LCCs, whereas LCCs do not benefit from FSCs. Despite such a relationship, LCCs are growing consistently, which supports the argument of their own induced demand.",

Eventually, Asiana Air stopped its conventional services in 2009 and then switched to LCCs by introducing its own LCC. This led to Korean Air having a parasitic relationship with Asiana Air (0, +). The latter relationship shows that Korean Air became totally dependent on Air Busan's growth, which is also reflected in Fig. 4 . It is also seen from Fig. 4 that Asiana Air struggled and always lagged behind Korean Air in terms of market gain until its transformation to Air Busan. After its transformation to an LCC, its market share increased, eventually surpassing that of Korean Air. Such a strategy change did not only benefit Air Busan itself but also stabilised the previously shrinking market owing to the presence of KTX, which further supports the argument of LCCs inducing their own market development in cases 1 and 2. It seems that an introduction of its own LCC by Korean Air, similar to Asiana Air, can excite the competition dynamics. Such step by Korean Air may help it to regain its previous market position and overall market may grow even further.",

Second, we explore how South Korean LCCs and FSCs have operated in the domestic aviation market over time. In the context of domestic tourism, we demonstrate that LCCs have flourished on leisure routes by creating their own new market.
