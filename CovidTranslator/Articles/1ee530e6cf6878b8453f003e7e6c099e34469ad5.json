Serial dilutions of serum were added to the wells and bound antibody was detected with species appropriate HRP-conjugated anti-human antibody (1:20,000) (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories). Optical densities were read at 450nm (DynaTech MR5000). The optimal conditions were determined by checker board titrations using serum that tested positive for HCoV-229E (by western blot and infected cell lysates-based ELISA). The criteria for a positive ELISA were defined as an OD450 > 0.2 (above background) at a dilution of 1:80 or greater for recombinant protein ELISA and OD450 > 0.25 for HCoV-229E infected whole cell lysates ELISA.",

We chose to use recombinant proteins rather than whole virus for this assay for several reasons. First, use of whole virus or infected cell lysates as antigens would require efficient replication of these viruses in vitro. HCoV-NL63 replicates poorly in cell culture and this would limit the ability to screen a large number of serum specimens. Second, whole virus or infected cell lysates may detect cross-reactivity antibody, complicating the use of these materials for seroepidemiology. Indeed, portions of the nucleocapsid of HCoV-NL63 were detected by a goat anti-HCoV-229E suggesting that cross reactive antibody to the 2 group I human coronaviruses may be elicited after infection with these viruses.

Although maternally-acquired N-directed antibodies to both HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 appeared to wane by 4-5 months of life, >30% of children have serological evidence of infection with either of the 2 group I human coronaviruses by the age of 12 months. The most likely explanation for this is the exposure and infection with these viruses in the first year of life. Our cross-sectional study revealed that the percentage of seropositive individuals 2 years of age was much greater for HCoV-229E as compared to HCoV-NL63 suggesting that HCoV-229E was more prevalent in the 1-2 years prior to the acquisition of the serum for these children. Our findings are similar to that of Hofmann et al who found, with the use of pseudotype virus expressing the S protein, that most sera from adults had HCoV-NL63-neutralizing antibodies (Hofmann et al., 2005) . Indeed, the youngest children who had detectable HCoV-NL63specific antibodies were ~1.5 years old and by age 8 years, the sera from most of the children screened had HCoV-NL63-specific antibodies, which are consistent with our findings. Furthermore, HCoV-229E specific antibodies were infrequently detected in the adult sera screened by Hofmann et al. and by our group suggesting that the circulation of the 2 group I coronaviruses differ.",
