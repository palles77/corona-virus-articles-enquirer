It is closely related to the anatomical and physiological characteristics of infants and young children and is more frequent during winter and spring, or sudden changes in temperature. Pneumonia is a serious disease that poses a threat to children's health and its morbidity and mortality rank first, accounting for 24.5-65.2% of pediatric inpatients. Due to juvenile age, severe illness and rapid changes, children often suffer acute heart failure, respiratory failure and even toxic encephalopathy at the same time. The concurrence in different stages of the process of emergency treatment tends to relapse, which directly places the lives of these children at risk. Severe pneumonia constitutes one of the main causes of infant mortality. In the process of nursing children with severe pneumonia, intensive care was provided, including condition assessment and diagnosis, close observation of disease, keeping the airway unblocked, rational oxygen therapy, prevention and treatment of respiratory and circulatory failure, support of vital organs, complications, and health education. The inflammatory response was proactively controlled, to prevent suffocation and reduce mortality. In summary, positive and effective nursing can promote the rehabilitation of children patients, which can be reinforced with adequate communication with the parents and/or caretakers.",

Drowsiness, convulsions or coma in sick children suggested an occurrence of toxic encephalopathy. Medicines such as antibiotics, antiasthmatic drugs, cardiac drugs and other medications were administered to patients at the appropriate dosage, the appropriate time and in an accurate manner. Side effects of various drugs were observed, and if children patients showed signs of dysphoria, quickening heart rate, worsening asthma, or enlarged liver in a short period of time, indicating heart failure, then the infusion rate was reduced. In our study, close observation of consciousness, pupil changes and muscle tension was carried out, and if manifestations of intracranial pressure such as drowsiness, convulsions, irregular breathing and increased muscle tension appeared, immediate rescue steps were taken. Abdominal distension and decreased or disappearing bowel sounds were observed, in order to detect toxic intestinal paralysis in time (23) .",

The dual role of the aforementioned ultrasonic aerosol inhalation was useful to reinforce treatment of children with severe pneumonia. According to the disease, aerosol inhalation was conducted every 4 or 6 h, with sputum suction ensuing, which produced a good suction effect for children patients with many sticky respiratory secretions. It should be noted that if patients had excessive sputum, the sputum suction was also carried out once prior to using ultrasound aerosol inhalation therapy, followed by thorough sputum suction. In the whole process of aerosol inhalation, providing oxygen inhalation or enhancing oxygen concentration effectively prevented the occurrence of hypoxemia (31) . iii) Hypocalcemia may produce laryngospasm and tongue tenesmus, which causes obstruction and sudden suffocation. First, the child patient's tongue tip was pulled outside the mouth, and then artificial respiration was conducted, with most patients being able to relieve themselves spontaneously. Pressurized oxygen was given, endotracheal intubation was carried out if necessary and calcium was replenished immediately. iv) When nasal obstruction caused breathing difficulties, 1% ephedrine drops were used after clearing away nasal secretions with a cotton swab, to maintain the airway patency. v) The diet of children with severe pneumonia was affected due to high fever, vomiting, diarrhea and other factors. When children patients were unable to eat, it was appropriate to supplement water, electrolytes, vitamins, and give them high-calorie, high protein, digestible food, that was eaten in small amounts but frequently, to prevent satiety from interfering with respiratory function. vi) Previous findings showed that, ambroxol and low-dose heparin coupled with aerosol inhalation significantly shortened the time of the disappearance of all the clinical signs and improved overall efficiency of the clinical treatment (32, 33) . There was no bleeding and other adverse reactions involved in the clinical treatment process, which had advantages such as easy administration, safe use, inexpensiveness, a significant effect, and less adverse effects in the treatment of children with severe pneumonia, and was thus worthy of wider application.",

However, two points are important when applying it to infants: i) grasp indications and standard of respiratory failure that the children comply with; ii) over NCPAP application process, nasal and oral secretions should be immediately removed, raising the neck high, to strengthen expectoration in order to maintain airway patency. Operating parameters of using the NCPAP oxygen therapy machine in our department: i) Oxygen concentration inhaled (FiO2) 40 or 90%; ii) the oxygen flow 4-12 l/min; and iii) the beginning pressure was maintained at 3-4 cm H 2 O. After observing 2-4 h, the adjustment of pressure was determined by clinical symptoms, signs and blood gas analysis. NCPAP is an effective treatment for severe pneumonia with respiratory and heart failure, and can quickly correct hypoxemia, reduce endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation demand (35) . It has a positive effect and can reduce the stimulation of children, thus decreasing any occurrence of ventilator pneumonia. In addition, parents readily accepted this treatment (36) .",
