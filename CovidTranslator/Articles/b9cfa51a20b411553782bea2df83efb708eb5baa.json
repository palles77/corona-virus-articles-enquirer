            "text": "To better understand the immunopathogenesis of chronic inflammatory lung disease, we established a mouse model of disease that develops after respiratory viral infection. The disease that develops in this model is similar to chronic obstructive lung disease in humans. Using this model we have characterized two distinct phases in the chronic disease process. The first phase appears at three weeks after viral infection and depends on type I interferon-dependent expression and then subsequent activation of the high-affinity IgE receptor (Fc\u03b5RI) on conventional lung dendritic cells, which in turn recruit IL-13-producing CD4 + T cells to the lower airways. The second phase becomes maximal at seven weeks after infection and depends on invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells and lung macrophages. Cellular cross-talk relies on interactions between the semi-invariant V\u03b114J\u03b118 T-cell receptor on lung iNKT cells and CD1d on macrophages as well as iNKT cell-derived IL-13 and IL-13 receptor on macrophages. These interactions drive macrophages to a pattern of alternative activation and overproduction of IL-13. This innate immune axis is also activated in patients with chronic obstructive lung disease, as evidenced by increased numbers of iNKT cells and IL-13-producing alternatively activated macrophages marked by chitinase 1 production. Together the findings identify two new immune pathways responsible for early and late phases of chronic inflammatory lung disease in experimental and clinical settings. These findings extend our understanding of the complex mechanisms that underlie chronic obstructive lung disease and provide useful targets for diagnosis and therapy of this common disorder.",

            "text": "Chronic inflammation is critical to the pathogenesis of many common diseases and is generally attributed to persistent activation of the immune system. This type of long-term immune activation is often linked to aberrations of the adaptive immune system, involving antigen-specific antibodies or effector T-cell responses that react against endogenous stimuli. 1,2 It is possible, however, that components of the innate immune system also contribute to the development of chronic inflammatory disease. 3 Thus, precisely how the immune system drives chronic inflammatory disease still needs to be fully defined. In that context, lung disease offers a useful paradigm for investigating mechanisms underlying chronic inflammation as chronic obstructive lung disease represents one of the most common types of chronic illness that affects humans. In particular, asthma affects approximately 10% of the population, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the fourth leading cause of death in the United States and worldwide. 4 Although asthma and COPD are regarded as separate clinical entities, it is evident that overlapping airway pathology can occur in both diseases. 5 It is even possible that patients diagnosed initially with asthma may be at risk for developing COPD later in life. 6 Thus, asthma and COPD may constitute discrete manifestations of a disease continuum resulting from a common pathological process that should be defined in molecular, rather than clinical, terms.",

Of special interest to this review, several clinical studies have proposed a role for respiratory viral infection in precipitating as well as contributing to the pathogenesis of chronic obstructive lung disease. Perhaps the strongest disease association for virus-induced lung disease exists for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), 7 a member of the Paramyxoviridae family that commonly infects the bronchial airways of infants and adults, causing severe bronchiolitis in a subpopulation of individuals. 8 A number of prospective case-controlled studies provide evidence that severe RSVinduced bronchiolitis in early infancy constitutes a significant risk factor for the subsequent development of childhood asthma. [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] Putative etiological associations have also been made for other respiratory viruses, but most of these (especially human metapneumovirus [hMPV] , rhinovirus [RV] , human parainfluenza virus [hPIV] , adenovirus, and coronavirus) are more likely associated with exacerbation of existing disease. 14 Furthermore, a number of clinical studies suggest that respiratory viral infections are the major trigger for exacerbations of asthma and COPD. [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] This association has been confirmed experimentally using mouse models that have demonstrated that viral infection can cause features of inflammatory lower airway disease in susceptible strains of mice. 22, 23 However, these observations did not fully develop a causal relationship between respiratory viral infection and chronic airway disease or define the precise mechanism by which viral infections contribute to the development and persistence of this type of disease.",

            "text": "Respiratory tolerance, and mucosal immunity in general, is maintained by a complex system of host defense mechanisms aimed at eliminating aeropathogens while tolerating innocuous airborne antigens and commensal microorganisms. Presumably, this immune balance of reaction versus tolerance may become permanently skewed and thereby progress to chronic inflammation. A scheme that is commonly used to describe inflammation in the lung (and other sites) is based on a model of immune polarity for the T helper (Th) cell system. Within this system, CD4 + Th cell-dependent responses are classified into Th type 1 (Th1) or type 2 (Th2). Th1 cells characteristically mediate delayed-type hypersensitivity reactions and selectively produce interleukin (IL)-2 and interferon (IFN)-\u03b3. This type of response is also found during respiratory viral infection. In contrast, Th2 cells promote B-cell-dependent humoral immunity, IgE class switching, eosinophil recruitment, mast cell proliferation, alternative activation of macrophages, and selective production of IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 that are all typical of an infection with an extracellular parasite and are commonly found during an allergic response. 24 Indeed, this type of response can be detected in allergen-challenged mice as well as allergic asthmatics, 5, [25] [26] [27] and Th2 cytokine production is often a prominent feature of asthma. [28] [29] [30] [31] For example, IL-13 is increased in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluids of allergen-provoked asthmatic subjects 30 and IL-13 mRNA and protein expression has been detected in bronchial biopsies obtained from allergic and nonallergic asthmatic patients. 32, 33 In addition, polymorphisms at the IL-13 gene locus have been shown to confer an enhanced risk of asthma and COPD. [34] [35] [36] Increased IL-13 expression is also found in some but not all studies of subjects with COPD. [37] [38] [39] This discrepancy is likely a result of the heterogeneity of disease within and between individuals and is a challenge for current clinical trials of anti-IL-13 therapy in subjects with asthma. 40 Some investigators have proposed that Th2-biased immune deviation may also influence the response to viral infection. For example, RSV infection may elicit Th2 cytokine production in allergen-sensitized mice. [41] [42] [43] Whether RSV infection can drive persistent production of IL-13 remains uncertain. Moreover, allergic inflammation is not characteristic of all forms of asthma or COPD. For example, bronchial biopsy specimens obtained from subjects with severe asthma and COPD often contain increased numbers of CD8 + T cells, macrophages, and neutrophils. 44, 45 Moreover, subjects with even moderate asthma exhibit activation of IFN-signaling proteins, indicative of a Th1-type response. 46 Furthermore, studies in mice using adoptive transfer protocols indicate that pro-inflammatory cells, such as Th1 CD4 + and CD8 + T-cell subsets, can potentiate allergic airway disease. 47, 48 Concerning as well is the observation that many forms of airway disease that are \"Th2-polarized\" are in fact precipitated by exposure to nonallergic stimuli (such as respiratory viruses) that would ordinarily elicit a Th1 response. Lastly, the Th1 versus Th2 paradigm has been further challenged by the discovery of Th17 (IL-17-producing) and T regulatory or Th3 (IL-10-and transforming growth factor [TGF]-\u03b2-producing) subsets of T cells, which appear to influence allergic inflammation of the airways. 49, 50 Thus, the immune response underlying chronic airway disease does not strictly adhere to the Th2 paradigm as aspects of both Th1 and Th2 immune responses appear to drive disease. [51] [52] [53] Because the Th1 versus Th2 model of adaptive immunity did not fully explain the subsequent development and maintenance of chronic inflammatory disease, we questioned whether other aspects of immunity and inflammation might also be critical for the pathogenesis of chronic airway disease following viral infection. Accordingly, we sought to establish an experimental model that would enable us to precisely assess the role of the innate and adaptive systems in the development and maintenance of chronic obstructive lung disease.",

The most common approach for these models involves sensitization and subsequent airway challenge using chicken ovalbumin, but others have also applied allergens derived from insects, e.g., house dust mite and cockroach, as well as infectious agents, e.g., Schistosoma mansoni, Nippostrongylus brasilensis, and Aspergillus fumigatus. Although these models do not fully replicate the features of asthma in humans, they serve to identify cellular and molecular determinants of allergen-induced inflammation. [54] [55] [56] [57] [58] A critical drawback to acute allergen challenge models is the transient nature of the airway disease. Allergen-driven models of airway disease therefore fundamentally limit study of the immune mechanisms that contribute to persistent inflammation found in chronic obstructive lung disease in humans. In addition, these models are unlikely to account for the nonallergic component of lung disease found after viral infection or other inflammatory stimuli, such as cigarette smoke.",

            "text": "Thus, to better understand how the immune response drives chronic airway disease, we developed a new model of chronic airway disease that develops after viral infection. The rationale for developing this type of model is rooted in epidemiological evidence linking acute viral infection with chronic airway disease. [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] Because infection with RSV is most strongly linked to the development of asthma, investigators have often used RSV as the etiological agent for study. In fact, RSV infection alone or in combination with allergen challenge has now been studied as a model for airway inflammation in guinea pigs, ferrets, rats, and mice. [59] [60] [61] [62] [63] On the basis of similar associations with exacerbations of asthma, others have also studied human rhinovirus (RV) and metapneumovirus (hMPV). The limitation of these models is that human pathogens often replicate poorly in other species. In the case of RSV, an extremely high inoculum of virus must be administered in order to cause disease in mice, resulting in an all-or-none pattern of illness. 64 Accordingly, we have advanced a model based on a natural mouse pathogen known as Sendai virus (SeV), a parainfluenza virus closely related to other human paramyxoviruses (e.g., RSV, hMPV, and hPIV). In contrast to RSV, SeV replicates at high efficiency in the lower airway of mice, resulting in acute inflammation of the small airways that maintains high fidelity to viral bronchiolitis in humans. Administration of a modest SeV inoculum (e.g., 1 \u00d7 10 5 plaqueforming cells) to young immunocompetent mice (e.g., 6-10 weeks of age) elicits a top-down pattern of infection that is limited to airway epithelial cells and neighboring macrophages. [65] [66] [67] This illness is therefore remarkably similar to the one observed in severe RSV infections in humans. It appears likely that this pattern of infection is necessary for the subsequent development of chronic lung disease in this model and perhaps in humans as well.",

Initial analysis of our model using mice with a targeted deletion of intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1), a widelyexpressed adhesion molecule, revealed that acute disease could be genetically segregated from chronic disease. 23 In particular, ICAM-1 \u2212/\u2212 mice failed to develop a robust inflammatory response and concomitant airway hyper-reactivity at 3 weeks after viral infection. Nonetheless, ICAM-1 \u2212/\u2212 mice remained susceptible to the development of chronic inflammatory lung disease. These observations thereby established the concept that separate pathogenic mechanisms could account for acute versus chronic inflammatory disease, laying the conceptual framework for our model of immune-based chronic lung disease. A significant breakthrough in our understanding of virus-induced lung disease came with the discovery that the acute and chronic disease that developed after viral infection required the production of IL-13 in the lung. 68 Using a combination of high-speed fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) and real-time PCR analysis, we were able to identify CD4 + T cells as the chief cellular source of IL-13 production at 3 weeks after viral infection. 37 This finding raised the possibility that elements of an adaptive immune response that are characteristically involved in allergen-induced airway disease might also contribute to virusinduced airway disease. To address this prospect, we pursued the underlying mechanism for CD4 + T-cell production of IL-13 in our model and in doing so uncovered a novel immune axis that links the antiviral response to lung disease. 70 In brief, we found that IL-13 production by CD4 + T cells following acute SeV infection is dependent upon induction of type I IFN production. Type I IFN drives expression of high-affinity IgE receptor Fc\u03b5RI on the surface of conventional dendritic cells (cDCs). Subsequent activation of cDCs through Fc\u03b5RI cross-linking then drives the production of CCL28 that mediates recruitment of IL-13-producing CD4 + T cells to the lung. These findings establish a novel mechanism whereby the antiviral adaptive immune response, which is characteristically proinflammatory or Th1 in character, can be transformed into an allergic Th2 response marked by the chronic production of IL-13 by CD4 + T cells. The next section provides some of the pertinent evidence to support this mechanism.",

We recognized the influence of serum IgE level on the expression of the high-affinity IgE receptor on mast cells in allergy. 80 We therefore reasoned that SeV-specific IgE could drive Fc\u03b5RI expression on lung cDCs after SeV infection as well. However, we found that total serum IgE and SeV-specific IgE did not appreciably increase until 7 days after infection. As the onset of expression of Fc\u03b5RI\u03b1 on lung cDCs predicates the induction of IgE expression, factors other than IgE must drive Fc\u03b5RI\u03b1 expression in our model. Indeed, even IgE-deficient mice exhibit the same increase in Fc\u03b5RI\u03b1 expression on lung cDCs as wild-type mice after viral infection. 81 We therefore focused our attention on the role of type I interferon signaling in regulating Fc\u03b5RI expression as these events occur in concert after viral infection. We directly examined whether type I interferon signaling was necessary for induction of Fc\u03b5RI\u03b1 expression on lung cDCs using type I IFN receptor (IFNAR)-deficient (IFNAR \u2212/\u2212 ) mice. We found that lung cDCs from IFNAR \u2212/\u2212 mice did not manifest induction of Fc\u03b5RI\u03b1 expression after SeV infection. Adoptive transfer using either IFNAR \u2212/\u2212 or wild-type purified cDCs established that IFNAR expression on cDCs was not necessary for induction of FceRIa expression on lung cDCs. This finding suggested that IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 functions through additional cellular intermediates and so we expanded our assessment to include additional adoptive transfer studies that identified neutrophils as a critical link between upstream type I interferon signaling and downstream cDC activation. 82",

Indeed, we were able to demonstrate that cell supernatants derived from cross-linked cDCs were capable of stimulating the migration of CD4 + T cells in a chemotaxis assay system. Ligand desensitization and blocking antibody assays revealed that CCL28-CCR10 interactions were responsible for mediating this process. Of relevance to this finding, increased expression of CCL28 is associated with both human asthma and mouse models of allergic airway disease. [83] [84] [85] This immune axis therefore provides an additional mechanism for CCL28 production and action in the setting of inflammatory airway disease.",

Furthermore, the increase in Ccl28 gene expression after infection was blocked in Fc\u03b5RI \u2212/\u2212 mice, suggesting that Fc\u03b5RI-mediated signals drove this process. We also found that the relative numbers of IL-13-producing CD4 + T cells were significantly reduced in SeVinfected Fc\u03b5RI\u03b1 \u2212/\u2212 mice compared to wild-type mice. In addition, Fc\u03b5RI\u03b1 \u2212/\u2212 mice demonstrated a marked decrease in the number of Muc5ac-expressing epithelial cells and total lung Muc5ac mRNA levels at 3 weeks after viral infection. To confirm that FceRI expression on cDCs is necessary for lung disease, we performed adoptive cell-transfer experiments using cDCs derived from wild-type or FceRIa \u2212/\u2212 mice transferred into FceRIa \u2212/\u2212 recipients. We found that reconstitution with wild-type but not FceRIa \u2212/\u2212 cDCs restored post-viral mucous cell metaplasia in FceRIa \u2212/\u2212 -recipient mice. The significance of Fc\u03b5RI-dependent CCL28-mediated disease was verified using mice that were treated with anti-CCL28 blocking mAb. In these experiments, mice treated with anti-CCL28 mAb were prevented from developing mucous cell metaplasia relative to control IgG2b-treated mice. Together these findings establish a direct role for Fc\u03b5RI in mediating the airway disease that develops after viral infection. These findings support the proposal that mucous cell metaplasia after viral infection depends on an adaptive immune response that begins with IFN-mediated expression of Fc\u03b5RI on resident cDCs and continues to activation of Fc\u03b5RI\u03b1, presumably through SeV-specific IgE, to transduce signals in these cDCs to drive production of Ccl28 and subsequent recruitment of IL-13-producing CD4 + T cells to the lungs. This model of disease is relevant to a clinical understanding of post-viral inflammatory airway disease, a condition that is marked by airway hyper-reactivity and is sometimes associated with elements of atopy, including elevated levels of serum IgE. 86 This condition often resolves by several weeks after viral infection (in humans and in the mouse model), but it is possible that a chronic inflammatory condition might develop in the face of ongoing infectious or allergic stimuli.",

However, mice deficient in FceRIa \u2212/\u2212 still develop chronic disease that peaks at 7 weeks after infection (unpublished observations, L.A. Benoit, D. Byers, M.H. Grayson, and M.J. Holtzman), thus suggesting that this adaptive immune axis does not mediate the later phase of chronic disease. We therefore speculated that components of the innate immune system might drive the continued disease process that also depends on IL-13-expressing macrophages. 37 When we pursued the underlying mechanism for macrophage production of IL-13 in this model, we uncovered a second novel immune pathway leading to chronic inflammatory lung disease. Unexpectedly, this pathway occurred independently of an adaptive immune response, as evidenced by disease progression in MHC-II \u2212/\u2212 , Cd4 \u2212/\u2212 , and Cd8 \u2212/\u2212 mice 37 as well as in B-cell-deficient (muMT) mice (unpublished observations). FACS-based analysis of the lung immune infiltrates in chronically affected mice revealed a substantial increase in the number of natural killer T (NKT) cells. Further assessment revealed that CD4 \u2212 NKT cells were directly responsible for the production of IL-13 by macrophages. Assessment of lung tissue from patients with severe asthma and COPD indicated that this innate immune response axis was also activated in humans with chronic obstructive lung disease. Collectively these findings indicate that the switch between acute antiviral immune responses to chronic inflammatory disease requires the persistent activation of a novel macrophage-NKT-cell innate immune response axis and thereby provides mechanistic insight into the pathogenesis of chronic inflammatory disease that is distinct from other reports of NKT-cell activation in asthma and asthma models.

Coinciding with the disease time course, significant IL-13 production is observed at 3 weeks and is maximal at 7 weeks after inoculation. A direct causative role for IL-13 in mediating chronic airway disease was established when mice treated with an IL-13 decoy receptor (sIL-13-R\u03b12-Fc) and IL-13 gene-targeted mice failed to develop mucous cell metaplasia or airway hyper-reactivity after viral infection. We detected comparable levels of remnant viral RNA in Il-13 \u2212/\u2212 and wild-type mice, indicating that chronic lung disease depends on immune cell production of IL-13 rather than differences in viral RNA levels between mouse strains. We next investigated the cellular sources of chronic IL-13 production in the lung after viral infection. Whereas CD4 + T cells contributed the highest amount of Il-13 mRNA at 3 weeks, we found that macrophages became the predominant source of Il-13 mRNA at 7 weeks after inoculation. In each case, the individual cellular contribution to total lung Il-13 mRNA levels was based on an increased number of cells recruited to the lung as well as increased production of Il-13 mRNA per cell. Secondary sources of Il-13 mRNA included NK cells and NKT cells, although no detectable Il-13 mRNA was found in mast cells, basophils, neutrophils, DCs, B cells, or CD8 + T cells. We also found that lung macrophages isolated from SeV-infected mice produced corresponding increases in IL-13 protein. In addition, immunohistochemical analysis detected IL-13 + cells with typical macrophage morphology and CD68 expression in alveolar, interstitial, and epithelial locations.",

However, there are notable immune defects in these mice that could complicate the interpretation of our results, and so we applied a clodronate-containing liposome delivery protocol to our model to selectively deplete lung macrophages. 66 Clodronate treatment was initiated after clearance of infectious virus to avoid any possible effects on the acute infection process. Using this system, we found no differences in the levels of Il-13 or Muc5ac mRNA at 3 weeks after viral inoculation, consistent with a lack of IL-13 production by macrophages at this early time. However, macrophage-depleted mice demonstrated significantly decreased levels of Il-13 and Muc5ac gene expression compared to control mice at 7 weeks after inoculation. Furthermore, immunohistochemical analysis of lung sections indicated that IL-13-producing macrophages were no longer found in clodronate-treated mice.

To assess this issue more thoroughly, we performed T-cell depletion studies using antibody treatment that was initiated following clearance of infectious virus to circumvent the possibility that these primary immune deficiencies could somehow be interfering with the acute antiviral response. Similar to mice with genetic T-cell deficiencies, mice that were depleted of CD4 + T cells, CD8 + T cells, or both CD4 + and CD8 + T cells demonstrated increased numbers of IL-13-producing macrophages, significant induction of Il-13 and Muc5ac gene expression, and mucous cell metaplasia after viral infection.

Analysis of whole lung NKT-cell populations indicated that CD4 \u2212 predominated over CD4 + cells and that both populations of NKT cells produced Il-13 without a corresponding increase in Il-4 mRNA. Although the relative contribution of NKT cells to the overall levels of Il-13 mRNA in the lung was relatively small compared to macrophages, the persistent production of Il-13 mRNA by CD4 \u2212 NKT cells might still regulate downstream macrophage activation and production of IL-13. In fact, mice that were genetically deficient in NKT cells as a result of Cd1d or J \u03b1 18 gene targeting 92, 93 were largely protected from the usual increase in IL-13expressing macrophages as well as Il-13 and Muc5ac mRNA and airway hyper-reactivity at 7 weeks after viral inoculation.

Cells used in this assay system were principally derived from the lungs because NKT cells and macrophages isolated from other compartments proved less capable of inducing IL-13 production. In addition, the cells were derived from uninfected mice to avoid downregulation of T-cell receptor (TCR) function and background production of IL-13. Using this co-culture system, we found that direct NKT-cell-macrophage interaction resulted in production of Il-13 mRNA and IL-13 protein by adherent macrophages within 24 h of co-culture. The NKT-cell effect on macrophage production of IL-13 was relatively specific for lung NKT cells as naive CD4 + T cells failed to induce IL-13 production by macrophages. Furthermore, NKT-cell-induced production of IL-13 by macrophages was significantly inhibited by treatment with an anti-CD1d-blocking mAb and markedly increased by addition of \u03b1-GalCer, a synthetic CD1d ligand. These results indicated that NKT-cell-dependent activation of macrophages required interaction of V\u03b114-J\u03b118 invariant TCR on the NKT cell with CD1d on the macrophage. We also found that NKT cells from Il-13 \u2212/\u2212 mice were no longer capable of driving macrophage production of IL-13 in the coculture system. This finding established a new role for IL-13-IL-13 receptor (IL-13R) signaling in controlling the NKT-cell-macrophage interaction. Co-culture analysis also indicated that NK1.1 + NKT cells were primarily responsible for driving IL-13 production by macrophages (unpublished observations). Analysis of liver NKT cells indicated that these cells were less effective than lung NKT cells for macrophage activation, requiring the addition of \u03b1-GalCer to stimulate macrophage production of IL-13. Nonetheless, preparations of either CD4 + or CD4 \u2212 liver NKT cells were equally capable of activating lung macrophages to produce IL-13 following addition of \u03b1-GalCer. Thus, while CD4 + NKT cells have been the focus for studies of the response to allergens in the lung, 88 it appears that CD4 expression is not necessary for NKT cells to drive macrophage-dependent disease after viral infection. Instead, the NKT-cell-macrophage pathway is primarily dependent on invariant iTCR-CD1d and IL-13-IL-13R interactions as well as NK1.1 expression.",

Increased Il-13ra1 expression no longer developed in Cd1d \u2212/\u2212 mice, suggesting that NKT cells stimulate an increase in Il-13ra1 mRNA. The increase in lung Il-13ra1 mRNA expression after viral infection was relatively small, further suggesting that increased expression of Il-13ra1 might be restricted to a subpopulation of cells. In fact, Il-13ra1 mRNA expression was restricted mainly to lung macrophages, and this expression was significantly decreased in macrophages isolated from Cd1d \u2212/\u2212 mice. These observations suggested that the interaction of IL-13 produced by NKT cells with IL-13R on the surface of the macrophage could serve to amplify macrophage production of IL-13. Indeed, we found that blockade of IL-13 signaling by delivery of sIl-13R\u03b12-Fc caused a marked decrease in the levels of IL-13-producing macrophages, which in turn caused a decrease in total Il-13 mRNA levels in the lung.

In particular we have found that bronchoalveolar lavage samples derived from severe asthmatics contain an increased number of IL-13 + CD68 + macrophages compared to samples obtained from healthy control subjects. In addition, we observed that lung samples obtained from patients with severe COPD exhibit significant mucous cell metaplasia and a corresponding increase in IL-13 mRNA and protein relative to control lungs. IL-13 + cells in the lungs of COPD subjects were identified as lung macrophages on the basis of typical cell morphology and CD68 immunostaining. The increase in IL-13 + CD68 + macrophages is accompanied by an increased number of invariant V\u03b124-TCR NKT cells in lung samples from COPD subjects relative to non-COPD controls.

However, there is no homologue for Chi3l3/4 in the human genome. Thus, the mouse model cannot predict which chitinase or chitinase-like family member may be equivalently increased in humans with corresponding lung disease. This circumstance, therefore, requires a comprehensive analysis of this family in humans with chronic lung disease. When this type of analysis was performed, we found instead that chitinase 1 is selectively increased in subjects with severe COPD. Similar to the mouse model, chitinase 1 expression was localized to lung macrophages. In addition, the increase in chitinase levels in the lung was reflected by an increase in circulating levels that could be detected in plasma samples from COPD subjects. In these subjects, the plasma levels of chitinase 1 were correlated significantly with disease severity. This level thereby provides a means to noninvasively track the status of alternatively activated macrophages in chronic lung disease and better differentiate molecular phenotypes in heterogeneous patient populations. In addition, these observations provide further evidence that the innate iNKT-cell-alternatively activated macrophage immune axis may constitute a significant pathway for chronic obstructive lung disease.",

The disease that develops in this model is manifest by mucous cell metaplasia and airway hyper-reactivity that are characteristic features of asthma and COPD in humans. The first phase of chronic disease develops at 3 weeks after viral infection and depends on type I IFN-dependent expression of the high-affinity IgE receptor (Fc\u03b5R1) on lung cDCs. Engagement of the Fc\u03b5RI causes the release of CCL28 to drive the recruitment of IL-13-producing Th2 cells to the airways, resulting in local action of IL-13 on airway epithelial cells to produce mucous cells and on airway smooth muscle cells to promote hyper-reactivity. This mechanism fits with the conventional proposal that the adaptive immune system is responsible for chronic inflammatory disease but raises the novel concept that an antiviral (Th1) response can be closely coupled to an allergic (Th2) response. Thus, the findings challenge the existing paradigm for separation of Th1 and Th2 responses, at least in the setting of post-viral disease.",

These two cell types are specially programmed to allow for interactions between the semi-invariant TCR on the NKT cell and CD1d on the macrophage as well as NKT-cell-derived, IL-13 derived, and IL-13R on the macrophage. Together these ligand-receptor interactions drive macrophages to a pattern of alternative activation and overproduction of IL-13. This model thereby provides for how the innate immune system can be solely responsible for mediating a chronic inflammatory disease. The relevance of this NKT-cell-macrophage immune axis is underscored by our additional findings of increased numbers of iNKT cells and IL-13producing alternatively activated macrophages in the lungs of subjects with chronic obstructive lung disease. Moreover, the mouse model guided the identification of a biomarker of this innate immune pathway, i.e., macrophage-derived chitinase 1. Initial results indicate that plasma levels of chitinase 1 correlate with disease severity in a subset of subjects with severe COPD. These findings reinforce the role of this new NKT-cellmacrophage pathway in the development of chronic obstructive lung disease and provide a new line of investigation for linking acute viral infection to chronic inflammatory disease.",

            "text": "In that regard, we recognize that the present insights into new immune pathways also raise substantial questions that need to be addressed to better define the basis for chronic inflammatory disease. Perhaps the most immediate issue raised by these studies is the need to identify the mechanism for persistent activation of NKT cells after viral infection and in chronic disease. One possible explanation is that remnant virus may provide ongoing stimulation to NKT cells, perhaps through activation of the retinoic acid inducible gene protein 1-like or Toll-like receptor family members. In support of this possibility, we find evidence of viral persistence of SeV that is similar to reports of RSV in animal models. 37, 100, 101 Additional work must be directed at the possibility that viral remnants contained in cDCs, macrophages, or other cell types might drive chronic NKT-cell activation after viral infection. A second question relates to the role of alternative activation of macrophages in chronic inflammatory disease. In that regard, our data and that of others suggest both proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory actions of alternatively activated macrophages may be found under experimental and clinical conditions. 96, 97, 102 At present, we view these macrophage products as potentially useful biomarkers of immune-mediated disease, but further definition of macrophage function is needed if the same products are pursued as targets for therapeutic intervention. Thus, the role of alternatively activated macrophages in the propagation of chronic airway disease also requires further assessment. The insights obtained from the present high-fidelity model of post-viral disease should serve to guide these future studies. Cellular and molecular scheme for immune pathways leading to chronic lung disease after viral infection. (A) For the first phase of chronic disease, viruses cause airway epithelial cell (AEC) and plasmacytoid dendritic cell (pDC) production of type I interferon (IFN). Subsequent type I IFN receptor(IFNAR) signaling leads to upregulation of Fc\u03b5RI expression on resident lung conventional (c)DCs. In turn, Fc\u03b5RI activation by viral antigen and antiviral IgE leads to production of CCL28 and recruitment of CCR10-expressing IL-13-producing T helper (Th)2 cells to the lung. The actions of IL-13 drive differentiation of airway epithelial cell precursors toward mucous cells (mucous cell metaplasia) and airway smooth muscle cells to become more reactive to contractile agonists (airway hyper-reactivity [AHR]). (B) For the second phase of chronic disease, viral remnants activate antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and thereby facilitate CD1d-dependent antigen presentation and consequent activation of invariant CD4 \u2212 natural killer T (NKT) cells. NKT cells then interact directly with lung macrophages via IL-13 production and binding to the IL-13 receptor (IL-13R) as well as contact between invariant Va14 T-cell receptor (TCR) and glycolipid-loaded CD1d. This interaction leads to increased expression of IL-13R and production of IL-13 that drives a positive feedback loop to amplify IL-13 production and alternative activation of macrophages, including Chi3l3/4, Fizz1, Mmp12, Arg1, and Alox12e gene expression in mice and Chit1, Arg1, and Alox15 in humans.",
