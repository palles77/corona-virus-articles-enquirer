In this study, we demonstrate that only the first domain, PLPD-1, is responsible for this cleavage, as deletion of the second domain did not affect the formation of the 87-kDa protein. Site-directed mutagenesis studies further showed that a previously predicted nucleophilic cysteine residue (Cys 1274 ) and a histidine residue (His 1437 ) were essential for the proteinase activity, indicating that they may be important components of the catalytic center of the proteinase. Meanwhile, expression of a series of deletion mutants revealed that the 87-kDa protein was encoded by the 5\u0408-most 2.6 kb of ORF 1a. Deletion and amino acid substitution mutation studies demonstrated that the Gly 673 \u00b1Gly 674 dipeptide bond was most likely the cleavage site responsible for releasing the C-terminus of the 87-kDa protein from the 1a and 1a/1b polyproteins.",

Sitedirected mutagenesis studies confirmed that the previously predicted Cys 1274 and His 1437 residues of PLPD-1 are essential for the proteinase activity, suggesting that they may be components of the catalytic center of the proteinase. Meanwhile, expression of a series of Cterminal deletion mutants indicated that the Gly 673 \u00b1Gly 674 dipeptide bond encoded by nucleotides 2545 to 2550 may be responsible for releasing the C-terminus of the 87-kDa protein. Site-directed mutagenesis and internal deletion studies further demonstrated that this dipeptide bond was indeed the C-terminal cleavage site of the 87-kDa protein. As no further N-terminal cleavage of the 1a polyprotein was observed, it is therefore established that the 87-kDa protein is encoded by the ORF 1a sequence between nucleotides 529 and 2547.",

However, when the IBV sequence from nucleotides 362 to 4858 (pIBV1a1) was expressed, no processing of the full-length 220-kDa protein to smaller products was observed .

HMW, high-molecular-mass markers (numbers indicate kilodaltons). expression of pIBV1a2\u232c4 led to the detection of three products of approximately 190, 100, and 87 kDa. Both the 190-and 87-kDa protein species were efficiently immunoprecipitated by antiserum V59; only weak immunoprecipitation of the 100-kDa protein, however, was observed ( Fig. 2b) . This result demonstrates that the IBV sequence between nucleotides 3047 and 3997 is not essential for processing to the 87-kDa protein species and suggests that the C-terminal cleavage site of the 87-kDa protein is encoded between nucleotides 2251 and 3047.",

By comparative analysis of the cleavage sites used by other viral papain-like proteinases, it seems likely that either of the two sites could be the scissile bond of PLPD-1 (Bonilla et al., , 1997 Dong and Baker, 1994; Hughes et al., 1995) . To explore these possibilities, substitution mutations of the Gly 673 residue with an Ala and the Thr 676 residue with a Ser were made, giving rise to the mutant constructs pIBV1a2\u232c4G 673 -A and pIBV1a2\u232c4T 676 -S. As can be seen, expression of pIBV1a2\u232c4G 673 -A led to the detection of the full-length 190-kDa protein; no processing to the FIG. 4 .

However, both the 190-and 87-kDa proteins were observed when pIBV1a2\u232c4T 676 -S was expressed (Fig. 5) . Furthermore, the relative amount of the 87-kDa protein to the 190-kDa protein expressed from this mutant construct was very similar to that expressed from the wild-type construct pIBV1a2\u232c4 (Fig. 5) , indicating that the production of the 87-kDa protein was not affected by mutation of the Thr 676 to a Ser residue.

In an early communication, Brierley et al., (1990) noted that Western blots of IBV-infected chicken kidney cells and Vero cells with antiserum V59 led to the detection of a virus-specific polypeptide of 75 kDa. This 75-kDa protein was subsequently shown to migrate on linear SDS\u00b1PAGE at the same position as the 87-kDa product . It is likely that the gradient SDS\u00b1PAGE system used in the original report may reflect more accurately the real molecular mass of the protein. To test this possibility, lysates prepared from pIBV1a2\u232c4-and pIBV1a2\u232c14-transfected cells were immunoprecipitated with antiserum V59 and separated on an SDS\u00b17.5 to 15% polyacrylamide gradient gel. Once again, comigration of the 87-kDa protein expressed from both plasmids was observed (Fig. 6) . It was also noted that the 87-kDa protein and the full-length product migrated slightly more rapidly in this gel system; the estimated molecular masses are approximately 78 and 180 kDa, respectively. Obviously, the migration of the 87-kDa protein in this gel system is closer to its calculated molecular mass of 75 kDa.",

Three viral proteinase domains, i.e., two overlapping PLPDs and a picornavirus 3C-like proteinase domain, have been predicted to be involved in these processing events (Gorbalenya et al., 1989 Lee et al., 1991) . PLPD-1, the so-called`main'' proteinase, is encoded by ORF 1a from nucleotides 4243 to 5019 and located downstream of the``X'' domain (Lee et al., 1991; Gorbalenya et al., 1991) . The second PLPD, which shares similarity with the streptococcus proteinase, is encoded by nucleotides 4681 to 5553 (Gorbalenya et al., 1989 . In a previous communication, we reported that the region coding for the two putative PLPDs was required for processing of the 1a and 1a/1b polyproteins to an 87-kDa mature viral product . Evidence presented in this report demonstrates that only PLPD-1 is responsible for cleavage of the 87-kDa protein from its polyprotein precursors. This conclusion is supported by two observations. Firstly, production of similar amount of the 87-kDa protein was observed from expression of constructs with or without the second proteinase domain. Second, mutation of the two predicted catalytic residues of PLPD-1, the Cys 1274 and His 1437 , totally abolished the proteinase activity required for processing to the 87-kDa protein. As the second PLPD is still present in these mutants, this result reinforces the conclusion that only PLPD-1 is required for cleavage of the 1a and 1a/1b polyproteins to the 87-kDa protein species.",

The significance of this region in the formation of the catalytic center, substrate binding, and overall folding of the proteinase remains to be understood. As for the second PLPD, no functional role has been reported so far. This lack of activity hampers its further characterization by mutagenesis study. In fact, no proteinase activity has been documented for the second PLPD of human coronavirus and mouse hepatitis virus strains JHM and A59 (Baker et al., 1993; Bonilla et al., 1995 Bonilla et al., , 1997 Dong and Baker, 1994; Hughes et al., 1995; Herold et al., 1998) .

            "text": "Deletion and mutagenesis studies demonstrated convincingly that cleavage of the C-terminus of the 87-kDa protein may occur between the Gly 673 \u00b1Gly 674 dipeptide bond. Examination of cleavage sites recognized by other viral papain-like proteinases suggested that they may consist of two small amino acids with short, uncharged side chains; in most cases, the P1 site is a Gly residue and the P1\u0408 a Gly, an Ala, or a Val (Bonilla et al., 1997; Dong and Baker, 1994) . According to these criteria, the Thr 676 \u00b1Val 677 dipeptide bond encoded by nucleotides 2554 to 2559 may also be a cleavage site of PLPD-1. However, as shown in Fig. 5 , mutation of the Thr 676 residue to a Ser did not affect processing to the 87-kDa protein. Another potential cleavage position is the Gly 680 \u00b1Glu 681 dipeptide bond encoded by nucleotides 2566 to 2571. This possibility is ruled out by deletion of the Gly 673 \u00b1Gly 674 dipeptide bond, which totally abolished the release of the 87-kDa protein (Fig. 5 ). As these two residues are located six and seven amino acids, respectively, upstream of the Gly 680 , this deletion should render very little, if any, effect on the cleavability of the Gly 680 \u00b1 Glu 681 dipeptide bond if it were a genuine cleavage site. These results virtually exclude the possibilities that either the Thr 676 \u00b1Val 677 or Gly 680 \u00b1Glu 681 dipeptide bond is the C-terminal cleavage site of the 87-kDa protein. Meanwhile, deletion studies also suggested that no N-terminal cleavage was required for releasing the 87-kDa protein from the 1a and 1a/1b polyproteins, indicating that it is encoded by ORF 1a from the authentic AUG initiation codon at nucleotide positions 529 to 531. Therefore, the 87-kDa protein is released from its polyprotein precursors via a single cleavage mediated by PLPD-1 at the Gly 673 \u00b1Gly 674 scissile bond; it is composed of 673 amino acid residues with a calculated molecular mass of 75 kDa. The reason for the increased apparent molecular masses of this protein (as well as the full-length product encoded by the first 5753 bp of ORF 1a) on SDS\u00b1PAGE is uncertain, but it may reflect the amino acid composition of the products encoded by this region. Examination of the deduced amino acid sequence shows that the region between nucleotides 2300 and 3800 encodes a product with unusually high content of negatively charged amino acid residues (21.8%). This may influence the mobility of the products on SDS\u00b1PAGE. To support this view, it was observed that deletion of this region resulted in synthesis of the full-length protein with an electrophoretic mobility on SDS\u00b1PAGE consistent with its calculated molecular mass (Fig. 2, lane pIBV1a2\u232c3) .

However, three major differences were also observed. First, IBV PLPD-1 exhibits no proteinase activity in cell-free expression systems. Extensive investigation showed that expression of ORF 1a up to nucleotide 5753 in rabbit reticulocyte lysate led to the detection of only the full-length product and several products derived from premature termination of translation. No cleavage of the full-length product to the 87-kDa protein was observed. Interestingly, no proteinase activity could be detected when the IBV 3C-like proteinase was expressed in cell-free expression systems (Liu et al., 1994) . Second, although the general recognition pattern of the three coronavirus PLPD described so far is similar, IBV PLPD-1 shows unique features. The most notable difference of the IBV PLPD-1 recognition site is in the P5 position. Instead of a basic amino acid, a Val residue was located at this position. This indicates that IBV PLPD-1 may be more distantly related to other coronavirus PLPD. In fact, the nucleotide sequences around the IBV PLPD-1 recognition site are not compatible with either alignment model proposed to explain the evolutionary relationship among proteins of human coronavirus 229E, mouse hepatitis virus, and transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (Herold et al., 1998) . Finally, no trans-cleavage activity has been detected so far for IBV PLPD-1 either in cell-free translation systems or in intact cells (unpublished observations). Once again, this is markedly different from PLPD of both human coronavirus and mouse hepatitis virus. It is therefore likely that IBV PLPD-1 may be a unique member among the coronavirus papain-like proteinase domains.",

Subsequently, we observed that the same cell lysate was able to mediate cleavage of the 1a and 1a/1b polyproteins at other positions (unpublished observations). However, none of the cleavage products released from these positions corresponds to genuine mature cleavage products, if compared with products generated from virusinfected or transfected cells. Cleavage at these positions does not therefore reflect real cleavage events that occurred in virus life cycles.",

This cleavage led to the production of the N-terminal 87-kDa and the C-terminal 160-kDa cleavage products. It was intriguing to note that the 160-kDa protein can also be efficiently immunoprecipitated by the N-terminal specific antiserum V59 (see Fig. 2 ). We have also observed that the 87-kDa protein can be coimmunoprecipitated by a region-specific antiserum recognizing the IBV sequence encoded between nucleotides 4868 and 5576 (unpublished observations) . The coimmunoprecipitation of the 160-kDa protein by antiserum V59 is likely due to the interaction between the N-and C-terminal cleavage products. Further investigation is underway to characterize this interaction.",

Plasmid pIBV1a2\u232c4G 673 -A contains a substitution mutation of the Gly 673 residue to an Ala, and pIBV1a2\u232c4T 676 -S contains a mutation of the Thr 676 residue to a Ser. The sequences of the mutation primers, LKP-11/LKP-12 and LKP-13/LKP-14, are shown in Table 1 . Plasmid pIBV1a2\u232c4\u232cG 673 -G 674 contains a deletion of six nucleotides coding for Gly 673 and Gly 674 residues. The pair of primers used was LKP\u00b115/ LKP\u00b116 (Table 1) .",
