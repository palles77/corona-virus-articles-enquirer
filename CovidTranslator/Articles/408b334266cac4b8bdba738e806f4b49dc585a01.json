Immunol. Irnmunopathol., The effect of recombinant porcine interferon-gamma (rPoIFNT) on in vitro production of interleukin 1 (IL-1) by porcine blood monocytes was studied. Three-day-old cultures of porcine adherent blood mononuclear cells were treated by doses of rPoIFN7 for 3 or 6 days befi~re lipupolysaccharide (LPS)-induction. While rPoIFN7 alone had no effect, a combined treatment by rPolFN7 and LPS enhanced the IL-1 secretory potential of adherent mononuclear ceils and, to a lesser extent, the level of cell-associated IL-1. The IL-1 activity was neutralized by anti porcine IL-lo~ and/? antisera. These results demonstrate that rPoIFN7 has immunomodulatory effects in vitro on porcine monokine production.",

However, little is known about the immunomodulatory properties of rPoIFN),. In this report, we present results of a study on porcine monocyte activation in vitro by rPoIFN7. The functional criterion of monocyte activation analyzed was the production of interleukin 1 {IL-1 ) by aged monocyte cultures treated with IFNy and subsequently induced by endotoxin, as described for human IFN7 by Arenzana-Seisdedos et al. {1985) . They showed that aged monocyte cultures do not respond well to lipopolysaccharide stimulation and thus provide a sensitive model to use when evaluating monocyte activation by immunomodulating substances, such as IFNy. Additionally, the use of aged monocyte cultures provides assurance that endotoxin contamination does not yield confusing results in monocyte activation . We report that rPoIFN7 has enhancing effects on the IL-1 secretory potential of aged cultures of porcine blood adherent mononuclear cells.",

The experimental protocol used, which follows the description by Arenzana-Seisdedos et al. (1985) for human monocytes, allows the preparation of aged (3 days) cultures which poorly respond to LPS alone (Fig. 1 ) . Thus, 3-to 6-day-old porcine adherent PBMC cultures, containing a large majority (74%) of esterase-positive cells, provide a sensitive assay system to evaluate monocyte activation. A seroneutralization experiment conducted with anti-porcine IL-1 indicated that the mitogenic activity produced by rPoIFNT-treated cells, although lower than that shown in Figs. 1 and 2, could be assigned to IL-I~ and to a lesser extent to ILlfl (Table 1 ) . Since rPoIFNy alone is unable to induce IL-1 secretion (Fig. 2 ), it appears that rPoIFN;~ causes a modification to the cells that renders them responsive to LPS. IFNr has been shown, in other animal species, to exert numerous effects on several monocyte-macrophage functions, such as increased expression of membrane receptors and class II molecules, increased phagocytic and antimicrobial activities, or enhanced secretory potential, including cytokine production. In fact, IFN), clearly appears to be one of the macrophage-activating factors (MAF) (reviewed by Trinchieri and Perussia, 1985; Virelizier and Arenzana-Seisdedos, 1985; Russell and Pace, 1987) . Using IL-1 secretion as a functional parameter for monocyte activation, we provide experimental evidence that rPoIFN), has MAF properties in the porcine species. The complete state of activation requires a two step procedure, IFN~ providing, after a long incubation period (Fig. 2) , a first putatively differentiating signal whereas LPS provides the final triggering signal.",

            "text": "The ability of rPoIFN7 to increase LPS-induced IL-1 secretion may have important potential implications. IL-1 is known to play a crucial role in the initiation of a specific immune response. It is likely, therefore, that rPoIFN7 could modulate in vivo the immune responsiveness of treated animals, leading to improved antibody production and/or T-cell functions following vaccination. In addition, since IFN~ has been shown to activate microbicidal and tumoricidal functions of rat and bovine alveolar macrophages in vivo (Badger et al., 1988; Bielefeldt Ohmann et al., 1987) , it will be very important to evaluate the ability of rPoIFN~ to activate porcine alveolar macrophages, in order to increase the lung defense mechanisms. Indeed, previous studies have indicated that porcine alveolar macrophages could respond to immunomodulatory compou,nds such as LPS or muramyldipeptide (Charley et al., 1983) and recently porcine somatotropin (Edwards et al., 1988) . The present report provides initial evidence for the potential imm~noenhancing effects of recently available recombinant PoIFNy. In vivo studies are, therefore, currently undertaken in our laboratory to evaluate the influence of rPoIFNy treatment in immunosuppressed pigs.",
