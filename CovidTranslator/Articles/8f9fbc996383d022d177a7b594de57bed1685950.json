            "text": "The prevalence of asthma has increased even in the last decade but a better understanding of the mechanisms of asthma and the availability of more effective treatment may be responsible for the stabilization of the steady increase in asthma morbidity and mortality noted since the 1980s. 1 From data in the recent National Surveillance of Asthma, 2 current asthma was reported in 6% of children between 0 and 4 years old, with at least two thirds having at least one asthma attack in the previous year. The most important reason why asthma in infants and younger children deserves special consideration is the fact that healthcare utilization (ambulatory, emergency department visits and inpatient hospital admissions) for children under the age of 4 years is greater than those of other age groups. 2 In addition, younger children with asthma are also more likely to be readmitted to the hospital for acute exacerbations. 3 In a retrospective analysis of 49 asthmatic children whose mean age was 5.2 years (range 2 months to 16 years) admitted to a community-based pediatric intensive care unit over a 10-year period, as many as 75% were 6 years or younger. 4 The public health consequences of dealing with asthma in children include the number of missed work days parents/guardians incur in order to care for an acutely ill child. Some studies have hinted that pulmonary development in infancy can be adversely affected by asthma, resulting in a decrease in lung function of approximately 20% by adulthood. 5 Relevant clinical practice guidelines developed in recent years have addressed special challenges in the management of asthma in this age group. 6, 7 Many issues are unique to this age group: identifying very young children with recurrent episodes of cough and wheeze associated with viral illnesses who will develop persistent asthma later in life, presence of confounding factors or disease masqueraders, who needs controller therapy and when to start treatment, what medications to use, how best to deliver the medications and how to monitor the response to treatment.",

Viral infections (respiratory syncytial virus, rhinovirus, coronavirus, human metapneumovirus, adenovirus, parainfluenza and adenovirus) are common triggers of wheezing in preschool age children, even in those who will not develop persistent asthma later on. Factors or exposures early in life such as prematurity, fetal nutrition, duration of pregnancy, viral lower respiratory tract infections in the first years of life, cigarette smoke exposure, air pollution, postnatal nutrition, breastfeeding, family size, maternal age, socioeconomic status and allergen exposure have been implicated to varying degrees. Observational studies have also demonstrated an increased risk of asthma attributed to acetaminophen exposure during prenatal periods, infancy, childhood and even adulthood.

Hence, other phenotypes may have greater relevance when management decisions have to be made or clinical trials are undertaken. For example, a symptom-based classification, i.e. episodic (wheeze only in discrete time periods, mostly associated with upper respiratory infection) vs multi-trigger (symptom also occurs with activity, laughing, crying or even at night outside of an acute illness), was proposed by the European Task Force in 2008. 20 However its clinical applicability is limited as children can switch between the two categories at different times, and this classification does not consider the frequency, seasonality and severity of the episodes. 21 A preschool child may have exercise-induced wheeze only when he/she is also having an acute episode or shortly after. During the late fall, winter and early spring in most areas in the northern hemisphere, preschool children who are in regular contact with other children can develop back to back viral respiratory illnesses that can each last up to 2 weeks or even longer. A child with a viral illness requiring a hospital admission is in the same classification as a child whose viral-induced wheezing illness is treated with a bronchodilator alone. Lastly, it is not known if there is a unique immunopathologic difference that can affect treatment between the two phenotypes. Therefore, clinical guidelines suggest starting treatment based on frequency of symptoms, severity of episodes and presence of risk factors.",

            "text": "The first practical consideration in approaching the wheezing child is to ensure that an alternative diagnosis is not present. In addition, infants and small children have a greater degree of bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR), which may predispose them to wheeze. 22 The differential diagnosis of wheezing in infants and young children includes conditions such as foreign body aspiration, structural airway anomalies, congenital lobar emphysema, abnormalities of the great vessels (e.g. vascular rings), congenital heart disease, cystic fibrosis, recurrent aspiration, immunodeficiency, infections, ciliary dyskinesia and mediastinal masses. Other clinical features, such as neonatal onset of symptoms, associated failure to thrive, diarrhea or vomiting, focal lung or cardiovascular findings, clubbing, constant wheezing, and hypoxemia outside of an acute illness, suggest an alternative diagnosis and require special investigations. Additional factors in addition to age at onset of symptoms that should be taken into consideration include triggers for the respiratory symptoms and aggravating conditions such as nighttime occurrences, environmental exposure, physical exertion, feeding, positioning and infections. Clearly, making the correct diagnosis is essential because the treatment for these conditions can vary substantially. For example, in children with significant gastroesophageal reflux, improvement in asthma symptoms with concomitant reduction in asthma medication use occurred after a prokinetic agent was instituted. 23 A practical approach that can be considered for a young child in whom asthma is strongly suspected is an empiric trial of asthma controller therapy while other evaluations are still being pursued (Figure 32-1) . enrolled over 1,000 newborns served by a large health maintenance organization to evaluate factors involved in early-onset wheezing in relationship to persistent wheezing at 6 years of life. 13 About half of the children had at least one episode of wheezing by 6 years of age. Nearly one third of the cohort had at least one episode of wheezing by 3 years of age. Only 40% of children who wheezed early had persistent wheezing at age 6 years. Of the total group, 20% had at least one episode of wheezing associated with a respiratory tract infection during the first 3 years of life but had no wheezing at 6 years ('transient wheezers'), 14% did not wheeze during the first 3 years of life but had wheezing at 6 years ('late-onset wheezers'), and 15% had wheezing at age 3 and 6 years ('persistent wheezers'). The 'transient wheezers' were more likely to have diminished airway function and a history of maternal smoking and were less likely to be atopic. The 'late-onset wheezers' had a similar percentage of atopic children to 'persistent wheezers' and were likely to have mothers with asthma. Hence, there seems to be a similar genetic predisposition for the asthma phenotype characterizing both 'persistent' and 'late-onset wheezers' . Essentially all of the current natural history studies have found that allergic disease and evidence of pro-allergic immune development are significant risk factors for persistent asthma.",

Two indices were used to classify the children. The stringent index required recurrent wheezing in the first 3 years plus one major (parental history of asthma or physician-diagnosed eczema) or two of three minor (eosinophilia, wheezing without colds, allergic rhinitis) risk factors, whereas the loose index required any episode of wheezing in the first 3 years plus one major or two of three minor risk factors. Children with a positive loose index were 2.6 to 5.5 times more likely to have active asthma sometime during the school years. In contrast, risk of asthma increased to 4.3 to 9.8 times when the stringent criteria were used.

Over 80% of the respondents rated five factors as necessary or important in establishing the diagnosis of asthma: recurrent wheezing, symptomatic improvement following bronchodilator use, presence of recurrent cough, exclusion of other diagnoses, and suggestive peak expiratory flow rate findings. Of note, 27% of the respondents indicated that a child had to be older than 2 years; 18% indicated that fever must be absent during an exacerbation. The diagnosis of asthma in young children is based largely on clinical judgment and an assessment of symptoms and physical findings. The following characteristics are suggestive of asthma: wheezing or recurrent or persistent nonproductive cough or difficult breathing that may be worse at night or occurring with exercise, laughing, crying or exposure to tobacco smoke in the absence of a respiratory infection; reduced activity or interest in running or playing compared to other children with easy fatigability during walks; presence of other personal allergic diseases (atopic dermatitis or allergic rhinitis) or family history of asthma in first degree relatives; and response to either therapeutic trial of a corticosteroid or a short-acting bronchodilator as needed. 7 Because lung function measurements in infants and small children are difficult to obtain, a trial of treatment is often a practical way to make a diagnosis of asthma in young children.",

It involves the application of sine waves through a loudspeaker to the airway opening via a mouthpiece, through which the subject breathes normally for short periods of time. Measurements are carried out during tidal breathing over a 30-second interval with at least three efforts recorded. Given its relative ease of use, it is a reproducible and suitable measure of lung function in younger children. 26 Marotta et al performed pre-and post-bronchodilator spirometry and forced oscillometry in young children at risk for asthma and found no difference in baseline FEV 1 or resistance between children with asthma versus those without; the degree of bronchodilator response differentiated the two groups. 27 Some investigators believe that reactance at low frequencies is a reflection of peripheral airways function. 28 Using three different lung function measures, Nielsen and Bisgaard evaluated the bronchodilator response of 92 children 2 to 5 years old, 55 of whom had asthma. 29 Children with asthma had diminished lung function compared to nonasthmatic children using any of the following measures: specific airway resistance (sRaw) utilizing whole body plethysmography, or respiratory resistance utilizing either an interrupter technique (Rint) or impulse oscillation technique at 5 Hz (Rrs5). Both asthmatic and nonasthmatic children responded to terbutaline, although children with asthma reversed to a greater extent than the nonasthmatic children. The investigators found that sRaw utilizing body plethysmography best distinguished asthmatics from nonasthmatics based on bronchodilator response. They concluded that assessment of bronchodilator responsiveness using sRaw may help define asthma in young children.",

Reference values using an offline tidal breathing method in healthy preschool children have recently been published. 39 Higher mean (\u00b1SEM) eNO concentrations (14.1 \u00b1 1.8 ppb) were found in infants and young children (age 7 to 33 months) presenting with an acute wheeze and a history of at least three prior wheezing episodes compared to first-time viral wheezers (age 9 to 14 months) (8.3 \u00b1 1.3 ppb, P < .05) and healthy matched controls (5.6 \u00b1 0.5 ppb, P < .001). No differences in eNO measurements were seen between the last two groups. In addition, eNO levels were reduced by 52% after steroid therapy to a level comparable to those of the healthy controls and first-time wheezers. 38 Unlike sophisticated measures of lung function and BHR, eNO can be easily and quickly measured. An elevated eNO in preschool age children has been shown to predict asthma in school age. 40 In one of the few studies designed specifically to address the role of eosinophil cationic protein (ECP) in young children with recurrent wheezing, Carlsen et al 41 found a strong correlation between serum ECP and response to albuterol/salbutamol using the tidal flow volume loop technique in children 0 to 2 years of age. These investigators suggested that ECP may be measuring airway inflammation and may have some prognostic value in diagnosing asthma in infants and toddlers with recurrent wheezing. The major drawback for ECP is its lack of sensitivity and blood sample collection.",

For preschool children already on a controller medication, management is tailored based on the child's level of control. As with the classification of asthma severity, assessment of asthma control is based on both impairment and risk (Table 32 -2). The three levels of asthma control are 'well controlled' , 'not well controlled' and 'very poorly controlled' . Children whose asthma is not well controlled have daytime symptoms or need for rescue albuterol >2 days/week, nighttime symptoms more than once a month but not more than once a week, 'some limitation' with normal activity, had two to three exacerbations in the past year, and an FEV 1 of 60-80% of predicted (or FEV 1 /FVC ratio 75-80%) for children 5 years of age or older. Children with very poorly controlled asthma have symptoms 'throughout the day' , nocturnal symptoms more than once weekly, need for rescue albuterol several times per day, 'extreme limitations' with normal activity, had \u22653 exacerbations in the past year, and for children at least aged 5 years, an inflammation, it has limited clinical applicability, except when other pulmonary abnormalities are being considered. Understanding the underlying pathophysiology of the disease in children is critical in order to identify processes that can be impacted by interventions. Thickening of the bronchial epithelial reticular basement membrane (RBM) and eosinophilic airway inflammation are characteristic pathologic features of asthma found in children as young as 3 years old, but typically occurring between the ages of 6 to 16 years. 42 It is unclear when airway thickening begins since routine biopsy studies are not performed in infants. 43 Studies on bronchoalveolar lavages obtained from wheezing infants and preschool children revealed an overall increase in airway inflammation, though it is rarely eosinophilic. In one study in which bronchial biopsies were performed on symptomatic infants, there was no consistent relationship between RBM thickening and inflammation, clinical symptoms and variable airflow obstruction, 44 similar to findings from biopsy studies in older school aged children with asthma. 45 The use of sensitive, noninvasive physiologic and biologic markers is very limited in the clinical evaluation of young children with asthma and recurrent wheezing.",

A comprehensive management is outlined in several components and/or sections and generally includes: establishment of patient/doctor partnership and provision of education to enhance the patient's/family's knowledge and skills for self-management (appropriate use of devices and medications); identification and management of risk and precipitating factors and co-morbid conditions that may worsen asthma; adequate assessment and monitoring of disease activity (including symptom monitoring by parent/caregiver); appropriate selection of medications to address the patient's needs; and management of asthma exacerbations (with provision of a written asthma action plan).

Initially, airflow limitation and the pathology of asthma may limit the delivery and efficacy of ICS such that stepping up to higher doses and/or combination therapy may be needed to gain asthma control. Asthma therapy can be stepped down after good asthma control has been achieved and ICS has had time to achieve optimal efficacy, by determining the least number or dose of daily controller medications that can maintain good control, thereby reducing the potential for medication adverse effects.

For patients who are already on controller therapy, modification of treatment is based on assessment of asthma control and responsiveness to therapy. A major objective of this approach is to identify and treat all 'persistent' and uncontrolled asthma with antiinflammatory controller medication. Management of intermittent asthma is short-acting inhaled \u03b2-agonist as needed for symptoms and for pre-treatment for those with exerciseinduced bronchospasm (Step 1). The type(s) and amount(s) of daily controller medications to be used are determined by the asthma severity and control rating. Even for young children, the preferred treatment for 'persistent asthma' is daily ICS therapy, with or without an additional medication. Alternative medications for Step 2 include a leukotriene receptor antagonist (montelukast) or a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agent (cromolyn). For young children (\u22644 years of age) with moderate and severe persistent asthma, medium-dose ICS monotherapy is recommended and combination therapy of medium-dose ICS plus either a long-acting \u03b2-agonist (LABA) or montelukast is to be initiated only as a Step 4 treatment for uncontrolled asthma. \u2022 The stepwise approach is meant to assist, not replace, the clinical decision-making required to meet individual patient needs. \u2022 Level of severity is determined by both impairment and risk.

Assessing Asthma Control and Adjusting Therapy in Children Aged 0 to 4 Years (ACT) for children 12 years of age and older, and the Childhood ACT (cACT) for children 4 to 11 years of age are examples of self-administered questionnaires that have been developed and validated with the objective of addressing multiple domains of asthma control such as frequency of daytime and nocturnal symptoms, use of reliever medications, functional status, missed school or work and so on. 49, 50 Recently, a five-item caregiveradministered instrument, the Test for Respiratory and Asthma Control in Kids (TRACK), is the first of its kind to have been validated as a tool to assess asthma control in young children with recurrent wheezing or respiratory symptoms consistent with asthma. 51 This questionnaire includes an assessment of both impairment and risk reflected in the NAEPP EPR3 asthma management guidelines. 6 The items include four impairment questions (three on symptom burden and activity limitations over a 4-week period and one on rescue medication use over a 3-month period) and one risk question on oral corticosteroid use over a 12-month period. Each item has five descriptive ordinal responses which can be scored over a 5-point scale (0, 5, 10, 15, and 20; total score range 0-100). The screening ability of the entire scale showed areas under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of 0.88 and 0.82, respectively, in the development and validation samples, with a include adding a leukotriene receptor antagonist, theophylline or a low-dose oral corticosteroid (for a few weeks only) until control improves, increasing the dose or frequency of ICS delivery or adding intermittent ICS to regular daily ICS, particularly if exacerbations are the main concern. Through all these, the process of assessing, adjusting treatment and reviewing response should be actively enforced. Regular assessment of symptom control and risk of exacerbations, inhaler technique, adherence and parents' understanding and preference should be undertaken. The need for controller therapy should be evaluated and treatment should be adjusted as symptoms in this age group may remit at certain times of the year or even over time. Once therapy is discontinued, a close follow-up within 3 to 6 weeks is ideal, and caregivers should be provided with a written asthma action plan that incorporates early warning signs of worsening asthma control and what to do or who to contact when the child's condition deteriorates.",

ICS have the potential for adverse effects, so it is important to deliver the smallest amount of drug required for response. Agertoft et al evaluated the systemic availability and pharmacokinetics of nebulized budesonide in a group of preschool children (mean age 4.7 years) with chronic asthma. 57 Ten children underwent pharmacokinetic studies of both intravenously administered (125 \u00b5g) and inhaled budesonide (1 mg delivered by nebulization). The amount of nebulized budesonide delivered to the patient was calculated by subtracting the amount of drug remaining in the nebulizer, the amount emitted into the ambient air, and the amount found in the mouth after rinsing from the initial amount of budesonide in the nebulizer (the nominal dose). The mean dose to the subject was found to be 23% of the nominal dose (231 \u00b5g), while the systemic availability was only 6.1% of the nominal dose, or 61 \u00b5g. The clearance of budesonide was calculated to be 0.54 L/min with a t 1/2 of 2.3 hours, and V dss of 55 L. The systemic availability in these small children was approximately half that seen in adults. In addition, the clearance of budesonide in these children was twice that of adults. Recommended doses of different ICS formulations for children 5 years and younger according to low, medium and high doses in the NAEPP EPR3 and low-dose formulations in the GINA 2014 global strategy are shown in Table 32 -5. 6, 7 What type of patient will respond favorably to ICS in this age group is an important question that has yet to be answered. A study by Roorda et al using data from two large placebocontrolled studies evaluated the clinical features of preschool children likely to respond to fluticasone administered via a diagnostic accuracy of 81% and 78%, respectively. Based on the highest area under the ROC curve, a score of less than 80 provided the best cut-off between sensitivity and specificity for uncontrolled asthma for this group.

Although there are six ICS available, nebulized budesonide is the only US Federal Drug Administration (FDA)-approved ICS for children less than 4 years of age. The initial studies with nebulized budesonide in young children with moderate to severe persistent asthma found it to be superior to placebo in improving symptoms, decreasing exacerbations, reducing chronic oral prednisone use or improving overall asthma control. 52, 53 Studies have also evaluated the efficacy and safety of nebulized budesonide in children with mild to moderate persistent asthma. [54] [55] [56] The efficacy of nebulized budesonide over placebo was consistently demonstrated with improvement in symptom scores, reduction in rescue medication use and improvement in morning peak expiratory flow rates in patients who could adequately perform the procedure. Improvement in symptom scores occurred as early as 2 weeks after starting budesonide. 56 Twice-daily dosing of 0.5 mg appeared to be somewhat more effective than 1 mg administered once daily. The investigators suggested that a dose of 0.25 mg/day may be sufficient for mild asthma, whereas subjects with moderate asthma should be treated with 0.5 to 1 mg/day and those with severe asthma dependent on oral steroids should be treated with 1-2 mg/day.

The investigators found a modest impairment in growth in only one of the three extension studies. The extension study where a decline in growth was noted consisted primarily of young children with milder asthma who had not been on ICS before entry into the initial study. In contrast, the two extension studies that did not find growth impairment consisted of children with more severe disease and had allowed for ICS use as part of the conventional asthma therapy algorithm. The Skoner study suggests that modest growth suppression can occur in young children receiving nebulized budesonide who have not required ICS therapy in the past and that children with milder asthma may be at greater risk for growth suppression secondary to increased intrapulmonary deposition. Alternatively, the findings may be attributable to the fact that over twice as many children randomized to the conventional asthma therapy arm withdrew from the study because of poor asthma control.",

A follow-up study of PEAK participants 2 years after the clinical trial was completed showed no difference in growth between children who were on active ICS therapy compared to those who were randomized to placebo. 64 However, in a post hoc analysis, lower growth velocity was found among participants who were younger and weighed less, probably due to a relatively greater drug exposure. For young children with poor asthma control, the disease itself can negatively impact growth. The growth of 58 children (mean age 3.5 years for males, 4.4 years for females) with asthma was followed over a 5-year period. 65 Each child's asthma was classified as being in good, moderate or poor control according to asthma symptoms during a 2-year observational period before the institution of ICS therapy. The group as a whole had diminished growth velocity to start the study, with a mean height velocity standard deviation (HVSD) score of \u22120.51. Children whose asthma was in good control had the least evidence for growth suppression before ICS therapy was instituted and continued to grow at the same rate as when on therapy (HVSD score \u22120.01 pre-vs \u22120.07 during treatment). In contrast, the subjects whose asthma was poorly controlled grew poorly before and after institution of ICS therapy (HVSD score \u22121.50 pre-vs \u22121.55 during treatment). Of interest, those with moderately controlled asthma demonstrated improved growth velocity while on ICS therapy, with their HVSD score increasing from \u22120.83 to \u22120.49.

The presence of eczema and the number of previous acute exacerbations were not associated with response to fluticasone. Eczema predisposes a child with recurrent wheezing to subsequent asthma, 14 but it does not appear to predict response to ICS therapy. It should be noted that a lack of response over a short course of treatment (12 weeks) does not necessarily mean that a response would not be seen over a much longer period of time (months to years). An NHLBI-sponsored AsthmaNet clinical trial which will be completed in 2015 is evaluating predictors of response to different interventions, specifically daily vs intermitting ICS therapy vs leukotriene receptor antagonist, in preschool aged children with persistent asthma. 59 The clinical efficacy and safety of intermittent ICS or systemic corticosteroid for young children with associated upper respiratory infection or viral induced wheeze remain controversial. A 2009 study which evaluated 'as needed' high-dose fluticasone propionate (750 \u00b5g twice daily) given at the onset of an upper respiratory tract illness found lower rescue oral corticosteroid use in those on active treatment compared to placebo (8% vs 18%, respectively); however this was accompanied by a statistically significant difference in height and weight gain. 46 In another 2009 study, oral prednisolone was found not to be superior to placebo with respect to duration of hospitalization, clinician and parent symptom severity assessment, and hospital readmission for preschool children presenting to a hospital with viral-induced mild to moderate wheezing. 60 A 2011study which evaluated daily vs intermittent high-dose ICS therapy given at the onset of a respiratory illness in preschool aged children with recurrent wheezing and atopic risk factors found no difference between the two treatments with respect to prevention of severe exacerbations. 48 ICS and Growth in Small Children. Few published studies have evaluated the effects of ICS on the linear growth of preschool children. Reid et al, in an open-label study, measured linear growth velocity in 40 children (mean age 1.4 years) before and during treatment with nebulized budesonide. 61 All of the children had 'troublesome' asthma despite treatment with an ICS administered with a pMDI with spacer and facemask or nebulized cromolyn before entry into the study. They were then administered 1 to 4 mg/day of nebulized budesonide depending on their level of asthma severity. The median intervals of time for linear growth determinations during the run-in period and nebulized budesonide treatments were 6 months and 1 year, respectively. The height standard deviation scores (SDSs) for the group during the run-in period were \u22120.21, at baseline \u22120.46, and after at least 6 months of nebulized budesonide \u22120.17. Note that an SDS of less than 0 denotes impaired growth velocity. Thus the subjects were growing at less than an impaired rate before nebulized budesonide therapy, and the institution of nebulized budesonide did not result in further growth suppression. In fact, there was a trend toward improved growth velocity while on nebulized budesonide.",

The GINA 2014 global strategy does not include LABAs as controller therapy in any of their stepwise algorithms for very young children. 7 They are not viewed as 'rescue' medications for acute episodes of bronchospasm, nor are they meant to replace inhaled antiinflammatory agents. Salmeterol has a prolonged onset of action with maximal bronchodilation approximately 1 hour following administration; formoterol has an onset of effect within minutes. Both medications have a prolonged duration of action of at least 12 hours. As such, they are especially well suited for patients with nocturnal asthma 83 and for individuals who require frequent use of short-acting \u03b2-agonist inhalations during the day to prevent exercise-induced asthma. 84 There is an added advantage to the use of these alternative therapies for preschool children who may deserve an extended bronchodilatory coverage for exercise because they are constantly active. Salmeterol via the Diskus\u2122 device is FDA approved for children as young as 4 years of age (50 \u00b5g blister every 12 hours), whereas formoterol delivered via the Aerolizer\u2122 is approved for use in children 6 years of age and older (12 \u00b5g capsule every 12 hours). Both LABAs are also available as combination pMDI with an ICS (salmeterol and fluticasone [Advair], budesonide and formoterol [Symbicort] , and mometasone and formoterol [Dulera]). Although LABAs combined with ICS are recommended for young children in Steps 4 to 6 of the NAEPP EPR3 guidelines (Figure 32-2) , they have limited application. 6 The Diskus\u2122 combination product is FDA approved down to 4 years of age but its use requires adequate inspiratory effort to get an optimal delivery of the dry powder. While the pMDI can be used with a holding chamber, it is not currently approved for children younger than 12 years of age. The efficacy and safety of LABA or combination products in younger children with asthma are still uncertain due to lack of studies.",

It inhibits both the early-and late-phase pulmonary components of the allergic response following inhalation of an allergen in sensitized subjects. A few studies have shown no added benefit with the use of cromolyn over placebo in young children with more severe disease. [66] [67] [68] [69] Several efficacy studies that have found cromolyn to have beneficial effects were short-term trials and employed small numbers. 70, 71 A meta-analysis of 22 control studies evaluating cromolyn in childhood asthma found it no better than placebo. 72 A multicenter, randomized, parallel-group, 52- week, open-label study in preschool children found nebulized cromolyn (20 mg four times daily) (N = 335) to be inferior to nebulized budesonide suspension (0.5 mg daily) (N = 168) using several outcome parameters. 73 Children who received inhaled budesonide suspension had a reduced rate of asthma exacerbations per year, longer time to first asthma exacerbation and first use of additional long-term controller therapy; nearly doubled improvements in nighttime and daytime symptom scores by the second week of treatment; and lower use of rescue medications. Although there were no significant differences in the rates of hospitalization and emergency room visits between the two groups, significantly lower urgent care or unscheduled physician visits and oral corticosteroid use were found in children who received the ICS. However, mean height increases from baseline in children randomized to inhaled budesonide and inhaled cromolyn were 6.69 and 7.55 cm, respectively. This difference of 0.86 cm is similar to the difference in height measurements seen in other studies with ICS therapy after 1 year of treatment in both younger and older children. 19, 74, 75 Leukotriene Modifying Agents. Leukotrienes are potent proinflammatory mediators that induce bronchospasm, mucus secretion and airway edema. In addition, they may be involved in eosinophil recruitment into the asthmatic airway. 76 Leukotriene modifiers (synthesis inhibitor or receptor antagonist) have beneficial effects in terms of reducing asthma symptoms and supplemental \u03b2-agonist use while improving baseline pulmonary function. [77] [78] [79] The leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRA) prevent the binding of LTD 4 to its receptor. This class has a pediatric indication and includes both montelukast (given once daily; has been approved for treatment of chronic asthma for children age 1 year and older) and zafirlukast (administered twice daily; approved for children 7 years and older).",

The GINA global strategy prefers the administration of ICS via a pressurized metered dose inhaler (pMDI) with a spacer and either a facemask (for 0 to 3 years of age) or a mouthpiece (for \u22654 years old) for young children with asthma but the dose delivered is variable between spacers. 7 These guidelines mention the use of nebulizers as an alternative delivery system for children who are unable to use the spacer device effectively. Since young children are only expected to perform tidal breathing, the optimal number of breaths to empty the spacer device varies with the tidal volume, dead space and volume of the device. Important measures to maximize delivery of medication to very young alone. Montelukast may be effective for up to 24 hours. Salmeterol and formoterol may block exercise-induced bronchospasm for up to 12 hours. There is one study that has evaluated single-dose bronchoprotective effects of salmeterol given through a Babyhaler spacer device using a methacholine provocation challenge in infants less than 4 years old with recurrent episodes of wheezing. 85 Originally 42 preschool children (age range 8 to 45 months) received one of the 25-, 50-or 100-\u00b5g dose of salmeterol and a placebo dose 2 to 7 days apart in a double-blind, randomized fashion, but only 33 completed the study. The investigators found a dose-dependent bronchoprotective effect of salmeterol measured by treatment/placebo methacholine dose ratios. Significant improvements from placebo were found only for the 50 (2.5 fold) and 100 (fourfold) \u00b5g doses.",

Obviously, liquid preparations are tolerated by infants but chewable tablets/pills can already be consumed by toddlers. Montelukast is available as oral granules or chewable tablet and prednisone/prednisolone comes in either liquid formulations or orally disintegrating tablet preparations. With regard to inhaled medications, certain anatomic and physiologic characteristics of children younger than 6 years are worth considering. First, because infants display preferential nasal breathing and have small airways, low tidal volume and high respiratory frequency, delivery of the drug to the lower airways is often inadequate. 86 Second, it is difficult if not impossible for young children to perform the maneuvers specified for optimal delivery of aerosol therapy such as slow inhalation through the mouth with a period of breath-holding for pMDIs or rapid and forceful inhalation required in the case of dry-powder inhalers (DPIs). Third, delivery devices appropriate for the young child are limited to those that require minimum cooperation from the child and must allow ease of administration for the caregivers. Although at present there are at least three inhaled aerosol delivery systems available for older children and adults, only two are used in this age group: the nebulizer and the pMDI with spacer/holding chamber and facemask. Because of the reliance on the subject's ability to generate a sufficient inspiratory flow and overcome the resistance required of DPIs, preschool age children are unable to use them.",

The pMDI with spacer or holding chamber is portable and inexpensive, takes less time to administer and is likely to be better tolerated than delivery with a nebulizer. Dolovich et al 87 published a comprehensive systematic review to determine if device selection affects clinical efficacy and safety. Randomized placebo-controlled trials that involved various devices for the delivery of \u03b2-agonists, ICS and anticholinergic agents in different clinical settings (emergency department, inpatient, intensive care and outpatient) and patient populations (pediatric and adult asthma, and COPD) were included. Reports in which the same drug was delivered with different devices were analyzed. Their findings indicated that the drugs delivered via different formats are equally effective. Appropriate secondary prevention of asthma. [97] [98] [99] The first and likely the most important step toward controlling asthma in sensitized children is to avoid or reduce the patient's exposure to the offending allergen. The environmental interventions that seem to hold the most promise are those that target reducing exposure to indoor allergens and tobacco smoke. Specific environmental control measures are covered in Chapter 21.",

For older children and adults with severe exacerbation having no response to initial inhaled therapy, or for those not merely to prevent hospitalization but also to avert a lower respiratory tract illness from RSV. In addition, the protective effect of palivizumab appeared to be found in those children without a family history of asthma or atopy. 119 A bacterial lysate, OM-85 BV, containing standardized lyophilized fractions per capsule from eight bacteria (Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella ozaenae, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus viridans and Neisseria) is widely used in Europe to reduce acute respiratory tract infections. In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group study it has been found to be effective at reducing acute wheezing illnesses in children with a history of recurrent wheezing by 38% compared with placebo. 120 It remains to be evaluated in larger clinical trials if this can be an effective primary intervention modality that will prevent the development of asthma. Immunomodulators, including this immunostimulant, along with probiotics, prebiotics, anti-IgE and specific immunotherapy, are proposed as potential primary prevention interventions by a National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute workshop committee. 121 There has been a recent trend toward intervening early in the course of the disease with the hope of altering the natural history of asthma, and clinical trials of what can be considered secondary prevention measures have provided important observations. There have been studies that sought to determine if treatment with an ICS soon after the onset of early indicators of the disease would modify the course of asthma. 19, 47, 63, 102 The study designs varied with respect to the eligibility criteria, age at entry, frequency of past wheezing episodes and manner and duration of treatment (e.g. maintenance vs intermittent or as needed intervention).",

The other study, called the Early Treatment of the Atopic Child, was a randomized, double-blind, parallel group trial that compared cetirizine (0.25 mg/kg twice daily) and placebo. 106 The medications were administered for 18 months to infants between 1 and 2 years of age with atopic dermatitis and a family history of atopy. The primary outcome, which was the time to onset of asthma in the next 18 months after discontinuation of treatment, was not different between the two groups. Half the children in both cetirizine and placebo groups developed asthma (defined as three episodes of wheezing during the 36 months of follow-up) (P = .7). However, in the cetirizine group, infants with evidence of dust mite or grass pollen sensitivity were less likely to have asthma over the 18 months of treatment with a sustained effect for grass-sensitized infants over the 36 months of follow-up compared with those treated with placebo. Furthermore, in the placebo group there was an increased risk of developing asthma in those with baseline sensitivity to egg, house dust mite, grass pollen or cat allergen. These two studies support the role of easily administered preventive measures in delaying or even preventing the development of asthma in genetically predisposed children.",

Given the relevance of environmental and allergen exposure in airway inflammation characteristic of asthma, interventions that can reduce these exposures (e.g. reducing tobacco smoke, dust mite or pet avoidance, and dietary modifications) have been undertaken, with modest overall results, and applicability may be limited by location and individual exposures. [107] [108] [109] [110] [111] [112] [113] [114] [115] [116] In addition, the success of interventions targeting reduction of exposure may be dependent on a multifaceted approach, and not just a single measure alone. 117 Recognizing the role of airway infection (including serious respiratory syncytial virus [RSV] and rhinovirus infections in early life) in the development of recurrent wheezing and asthma susceptibility in childhood, perhaps prophylaxis against them might help reduce asthma development. A lower incidence of recurrent wheezing (and even physiciandocumented episodes) over a 2-year follow-up period was found among preterm infants without chronic lung disease who had received palivizumab (a humanized monoclonal antibody against the RSV fusion protein) compared with preterm infants who had not received palivizumab, prior to enrollment. 118 There was also a significant difference in outcomes between palivizumab-treated and untreated children who were not hospitalized for RSV, suggesting that the effect of palivizumab was corticosteroid rescue, asthma healthcare utilization or quality of life was found. Nevertheless, both active study treatments demonstrated modest reductions in symptom severity score (such as wheezing, trouble breathing or activity limitation) relative to conventional therapy, particularly among children with positive API or prior oral corticosteroid use.",

For those with a more persistent pattern, controller therapy is indicated. A significant subset have a severe, intermittent course, and for these patients daily controller therapy may still be beneficial. However, recent studies have suggested the efficacy of 'as needed' high-dose inhaled corticosteroid started at the onset of a respiratory illness, particularly in very young children who have atopic risk factors. The development of persistent asthma and requirement for long-term controller therapy in a very young child can be predicted to a limited degree. Currently no clinically available objective and reliable measure of lung function, bronchial hyperreactivity or airway inflammation exists that is applicable to this age group, hence monitoring the effects of interventions or treatment on prevention of asthma inception, modulation of underlying inflammation, perhaps airway remodeling, prevention of deterioration in lung function over time and induction of physiologic or immunologic remission is not feasible. The need to evaluate objectively the efficiency and safety of the various delivery devices and HFA formulation available for inhaled therapies to infants and young children remains. Only a few medications have been approved for use in this population, and studies have demonstrated effects on asthma control using short-term parameters. Studies on prevention of asthma development are warranted, especially in those who are deemed susceptible. Yet these are the ultimate goals that may motivate patients and families, if indeed interventions can really alter the development and the natural history of their disease. These studies often require large sample size and monitoring over longer periods of time which require enormous resources and the use of practical, objective measures of disease activity which are still lacking.",

Participants were randomized to receive one of the following for 7 days at the onset of symptoms: budesonide inhalation suspension (1.0 mg twice daily) or montelukast group (4 mg once daily) or conventional rescue bronchodilator therapy. The primary outcome was the proportion of episodefree days (i.e. days free from cough, wheeze, trouble breathing, asthma-associated interference with daily activities or awakening from sleep, healthcare utilization due to wheezing, and use of asthma-related non-study medications) over the entire study period. Compared to conventional rescue bronchodilator therapy, neither budesonide nor montelukast initiated at early signs of illness increased the proportion of episode-free days over a 1-year period. In addition, no differential effect on oral",
