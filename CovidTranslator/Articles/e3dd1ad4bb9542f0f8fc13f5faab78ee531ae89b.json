Pol b expression has been previously shown to be regulated at the level of transcription, but there is also evidence of post-transcriptional regulation, since rat transcripts undergo alternative polyadenylation, and the resulting 3 0 UTR contain at least one regulatory element. Data presented here indicate that RNA of the short 3 0 UTR folds to form a strong secondary structure (hairpin). Its regulatory role was established utilizing a luciferase-based reporter system. Further studies led to the identification of a protein factor, which binds to this element-the antiapoptotic, cytoskeleton-related protein Hax-1. The results of in vitro binding analysis indicate that the formation of the RNA-protein complex is significantly impaired by disruption of the hairpin motif. We demonstrate that Hax-1 binds to Pol b mRNA exclusively in the form of a dimer. Biochemical analysis revealed the presence of Hax-1 in mitochondria, but also in the nuclear matrix, which, along with its transcript-binding properties, suggests that Hax-1 plays a role in post-transcriptional regulation of expression of Pol b.",

Conversely, cells deficient in DNA polymerase b display hypersensitvity to alkylating agent-induced apoptosis and chromosomal breakage (7) . Sugo et al.

Although regulation at the transcription level is apparent, expression of the Pol b transcripts might also be controlled at the posttranscriptional level. In rat cells there are two alternatively polyadenylated Pol b transcripts, with 3 0 UTRs of significantly different lengths (12) . The expression of the two transcripts is tissue specific. The short transcript is present in most tissues, with significantly higher expression in testis, while the long transcript is expressed mostly in the brain and lungs (13) .

We demonstrate that binding occurs only for a Hax-1 dimer, though RNA binding is not a prerequisite for the dimerization itself. We confirm the importance of the hairpin structure for binding of Hax-1 by its mutagenic disruption, which impairs the RNA-protein interaction. We also report strong association of Hax-1 with the nuclear matrix, which is a novel finding, consistent with its transcript-binding properties.

Module M3 contains the polyadenylation signal, followed by the cleavage and polyadenylation site, so only a part of it is present in the mature short Pol b transcript, which implies minor importance of the whole M3 module as a post-transcriptional regulatory element.",

The longest helical region includes as many as six non-WC, U-G and G-U base pairs. Four of these exist as two tandems: U-G, G-U and U-G, U-G, which are known to be potential metal-or protein-binding sites. The hairpin structure contains a small 3-nt terminal loop (5 0 -UAU), which is also well recognized by both lead ions and enzymes ( Figure 1A and B) .

A vector bearing the unmodified luciferase gene served as a control (pCMLuc). To asses mRNA levels of the reporter, quantitative PCR was performed for cDNA preparations obtained from cells subjected to the same transfections as for luciferase assays. The results (Figure 4) show a significant decrease of mRNA levels for the construct with the hairpin structure (H), compared with almost unchanged mRNA levels for the mutated hairpin (Hmut). These differences, however, are not reflected at the protein level: both constructs (H and Hmut) caused an increase in luciferase expression, although only for the Hmut is this increase significant. The relative increase of protein levels in respect to mRNA levels is therefore more than 3-fold for the construct with the intact hairpin, while only a slight relative increase ($1.7-fold) was observed for the mutated construct. These changes in expression indicate a complex posttranscriptional regulation in which the hairpin element has a key function.",

The free energy increment for the two structures varies considerably, and amounts to \u00c014.1 for the M2 hairpin and \u00c03.6 for the mutant. Presence of the hairpin-containing 3 0 UTR confers mRNA instability but also enhances expression at the protein level. Disruption of the hairpin prevents mRNA degradation, but a mutation-containing construct still slightly enhances expression at the protein level. Constructs used for transfections: control vector (pCMLuc), hairpin-containing construct (pCMLucH) and mutated hairpin (pCMLucHmut). mRNA levels were quantitated for each construct by RQ-PCR in cDNA isolated from transfected cells (8 independent transfections), in triplicate, normalized with respect to Renilla luciferase mRNA levels. Firefly luciferase levels were assessed for the same eight transfections (in six repeats) and normalized with respect to Renilla luciferase levels, which served as a control of transfection efficiency. Statistical significance is reported as P-value: \u00c3 P50.01, \u00c3\u00c3 non-significant. UV-cross-linking was performed using the purified recombinant Hax-1 and in vitro transcripts of the hairpin-containing region (H), a control antisense transcript of the same region (A), and the mutated transcript (Hmut). Bovine serum albumin and purified thioredoxin served as controls for interaction specificity. Hax-1 demonstrated a specific interaction only with the hairpin-containing RNA, and this transcript did not interact with either BSA or thioredoxin ( Figure 6) . The cross-linked band migrated at a molecular weight of $100 kDa, which corresponds to a recombinant Hax-1 dimer (the recombinant protein has a higher molecular mass than endogenous Hax-1 [35 kDa], due to its fusion with the thioredoxin sequence). The protein dimer is likely formed during the UV-cross-linking procedure, as has been previously documented (34) . No band corresponding in size to monomeric recombinant Hax-1 (ca. 50 kDa) was observed, which indicates that the protein interacts with RNA exclusively in the form of a dimer.",

Since dimer formation was detected in an in vitro experiment performed with purified protein, one can conclude that the RNA molecule is not necessary for dimerization. As deduced from the UV-cross-linking experiments, RNA is bound exclusively by dimeric Hax-1, hence the dimerization rate may represent an important factor for RNA-protein complex formation.

Only M2 is evolutionary conserved, the rest of the untranslated region has high interspecies sequence variation, which suggests lesser functional importance.

Lowering of luciferase mRNA levels for the construct with an intact hairpin structure in contrast with almost unchanged mRNA levels for the mutated structure indicate that the hairpin is in fact an RNA destabilizing element. However, at the protein level, expression for both constructs exceeds the expression of the control. This indicates the presence of at least two regulatory events in which the hairpin structure is involved: (i) mRNA degradation, (ii) enhanced mRNA transport (possibly coupled with mRNA stabilization) and/or enhanced translation. These effects may be the consequence of the competitive binding of trans-acting factors for the binding site within the hairpin. Thus, identification of the hairpin-binding factors is important for assessment of its physiological role.",

From these results, we deduce that BH domains (BH1 and BH2) present in the N-terminal part of the protein do not take part in the dimerization. BH domains and a transmembrane domain (present at the C-terminus of Hax-1) represent the features of Bcl-2 family proteins, but there is no significant sequence homology between these proteins and Hax-1only a weak, partial homology to pro-apoptotic Nip3 (35) .
