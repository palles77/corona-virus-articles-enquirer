Our investigation revealed that the reaction between isatin and indoles in [BMIM] [BF 4 ]-LiCl or TMGT f media stops at the step of addition of the two components providing 3-indolyl-3-hydroxyindolin-2-ones while the ionic liquid TMGT runs the reaction further through accompanying Friedel-Crafts substitution to afford symmetrical 3,3-di(indol-3-yl)indolin-2-ones. To take advantage of the difference between the effects of these ionic liquids on the reaction progress, we planned a two-step protocol for the efficient synthesis of unsymmetrical 3,3-di(indol-3-yl)indolin-2-ones.",

            "text": "The versatile properties and the variety of available ionic liquids have made them promising substances for application in most chemistry areas. [1] [2] [3] Ionic liquids are new generation solvents composed of bulky organic cations having liquid range at/or close to room temperature, hence they are well positioned to fill the polarity gap between molecular liquids and the molten metal salts. The unique nature of ionic liquids allows virtually all possible interactions between the solutes and the ions thus have an ability to dissolve both organic and inorganic materials. On other hand, the high polarity of ionic liquids ensures immiscibility with many organic solvents, offering unique opportunities for phase separation and recycling. An important feature of ionic liquids is the possibility to tune their chemical properties and also to adjust their solubility to enable phase separation. Today, ionic liquids have been shown to be more than simple solvents, showing significant roles in controlling reactions as catalysts. 4, 5 The early use of ionic liquids as catalysts was merely based on their role as polar media to facilitate organic reactions having polar transition states. The application now is extended by the so-called task-specific ionic liquids either through immobilization of the effective ionic catalysts in ionic liquids 6, 7 or by incorporating a functional group responsible for catalysis in their ionic partners. [8] [9] [10] Synthesis by the aid of immobilized metal catalysts in ionic liquids 11, 12 recently has received considerable attention because such 'liquid phase' synthesis retains the advantages of homogenous catalysis, and still permits the fairly facile purification of the products and recycling of the catalysts.",

During these investigations, the indolin-2-one (oxindole) moiety has been recognized as a biologically active framework. 25, 26 Oxindole is an integral constituent of many natural products. [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] Thus, it is not surprising that access to several members of this class may be the goal of many research laboratories. Oxindole derivatives have been prepared by the reaction of isatin or its derivatives with barbituric acid, 32 aromatics in triflic acid, 33 pyrazolones, 34 and other routes. [35] [36] [37] [38] The 3,3-di(indol-3-yl)indolin-2-ones can be formed by the reaction of isatin and indoles in acidic conditions and several methods have been developed for the synthesis of these compounds.

This recognition implies that the reaction could be assisted by enhancing the nucleophilic character of indoles in basic media, or by activating the carbonyl group of isatin with the aid of acidic species. In this view, we envisaged that the acid-base guanidinium ionic liquids could be suitable choices for performing the dual role. Our initial trials on the model reaction between indole and isatin in TMGT f was very encouraging as it proceeds smoothly at room temperature and stops at the stage of monoindolylation of isatin to afford 3-(indol-3yl)-3-hydroxyindolin-2-one 3a in fairly high yield. We have also performed the model reaction in either of the neutral ionic liquids, [BMIM]Cl and [BMIM]BF 4 or in the absence of ionic liquids to respond the issue if the high polarity of TMGT f is responsible for catalysis of the reaction. Of note, the model reaction has not proceeded in either of the above imidazolium ionic liquids or absence of them, confirming the functional role of TMGT f in catalysis of the reaction. To learn more about this function and on expectation that Li \u00fe could play the same role as H \u00fe in TMGT f we intended to test our model reaction in [BMIM]BF 4 doped with LiCl. As expected, the LiCl contained in [BMIM]BF 4 efficiently catalyzed the addition of indole onto isatin to provide 3-(indol-3-yl)-3-hydroxyindolin-2-one 3a in a few minutes (Table 1) .",

For this purpose the reaction involving a 1:1 mmol ratio of isatin and indole was similarly carried out in N,N,N,N-tetramethylguanidinium trifluoroacetate (TMGT), in place of TMGT f , at room temperature. Monitoring of this reaction by TLC revealed a rather slow disappearance of the reactants, compared to the reaction in TMGT f or [BMIM]BF 4 -LiCl, and still signifying an efficient conversion giving both 3-(indol-3-yl)-3hydroxyindolin-2-one 3a and 3,3-di(indol-3-yl)indolin-2-one 4a in about an hour. Formation of 3,3-di(indol-3-yl)indolin-2-one 4a as a by-product obviously accounts for the capability of TMGT to catalyze the Friedel-Crafts reaction between 3-(indol-3-yl)-3hydroxyindolin-2-one 3a and another indole molecule, meanwhile showing a need for optimization of conditions to gain better yield of 4a. In order to optimize the reaction conditions, we performed the model reaction using different quantities of reactants and the ionic liquid. The best results were obtained with 1:2 mmol ratios of isatin and indoles in the presence of 1 mL of TMGT at room temperature. Therefore, we set out a method comprising the room temperature reaction of a 2:1 mixture of indole 1 and isatin 2 without using any solvent or additional catalyst in TMGT and thereby 3,3-di(indol-3-yl)indolin-2-ones 4a-f were obtained in fairly high yields (Table 3) .

In the next phase of this investigation we planned to take advantage of the difference between catalytic activities of TMGT and TMGT f for the synthesis of unsymmetrical 3,3-di(indol-3-yl)indolin-2-ones in a more controlled manner. In this protocol the initially synthesized 3-(indol-3-yl)-3-hydroxyindolin-2-ones 3, on reaction of an isatin derivatve with an indole in TMGT f or [BMIM]BF 4 -LiCl ionic liquids, was treated with 1 equiv of another indole derivate in TMGT to give the desired unsymmetrical 3,3-di(indol-3-yl)indolin-2-one 5.
