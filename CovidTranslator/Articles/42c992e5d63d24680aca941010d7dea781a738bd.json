Detailed physiologic descriptions of serous body cavity homeostasis are available (Bouvy et al., 1991; Forrester, 1988; Kirby, 2003) . These serous body cavities are lined by specialized cells, termed mesothelial cells. Clinical signs of the presence of increased amounts of fl uid include abdominal distension, abdominal pain, dyspnea, muffl ed heart sounds, and cardiac arrhythmia. Collection and evaluation of fl uid from these sites may be therapeutic as well as diagnostic for the presence of infl ammatory, hemorrhagic, neoplastic, lymphatic, or bilious conditions. Additionally, further diagnostic tests may be indicated by the cytologic characteristics. Removal and examination of fl uid is highly recommended unless anesthetic risks or bleeding diathesis are present or further injury is likely.",

It has been shown with canine effusions that refractometry underestimates the protein content when \u03fd 2.0 g/dl and that the spectrophotometry using the biuret method is more accurate when there is high protein content (Braun et al., 2001) . Others have found that refractometry can be used accurately down to 1.0 g/dl (George and O'Neill, 2001) . A similar fi nding of underestimating protein content in feline effusions with refractometry may occur (Papasouliotis et al., 2002) . In that same study, a dry chemistry analyzer produced increased globulin concentration and therefore lower Albumin:Globulin (A:G) ratios when compared with a reference wet analyzer using the same biuret and bromocresol green methodologies (Papasouliotis et al., 2002) . This fi nding is particularly important since decreased A:G ratios support a diagnosis of feline infectious peritonitis (Hartmann et al., 2003) .",

With this information, one can begin to narrow down the list of possible causes for the abnormal fl uid accumulation. For samples being submitted to a reference laboratory, placing some of the sample in a lavender-top tube (EDTA) and some in a red-top tube is recommended. The lavender-top tube contains anticoagulant, which prevents the sample from clotting if there is a high protein content. EDTA is bactericidal, however, and is contraindicated if a sample is to be cultured (Songer and Post, 2005) . Thus, some of the fl uid should also be put into a red-top tube or sterile tube without additives. The cell counts will be done either with a hemocytometer or an automated cell-counting instrument.

These fl uids increase in volume in response to physiologic mechanisms, such as increased hydrostatic vascular pressure or decreased colloidal osmotic pressure, that cause the normal homeostatic mechanisms of fl uid production and resorption to be overwhelmed. Some causes for transudate accumulation include severe hypoalbuminemia, portal hypertension, hepatic insuffi ciency, portosystemic shunt, and early myocardial insuffi ciency. The cells commonly found in transudates are similar to those in normal fl uid, which are mostly mononuclear cells consisting of macrophages, small lymphocytes, and mesothelial cells (see Fig. 6 -6A). Neutrophils may compose a small proportion of the population. Note a large macrophage, many small lymphocytes, and nondegenerate neutrophils. This fl uid had a protein of 2.5g/dl and an increased nucleated cell count of 4000 cells/\u03bcl. The macrophage has phagocytized a red blood cell. (Romanowsky; HP oil.)",

The accumulation of transudative fl uid in a body cavity causes increased pressure, which is irritating to the mesothelial cells lining the space. They respond by proliferating and sloughing into the effusion. With time, the sloughed mesothelial cells die and in so doing release chemoattractants that draw small numbers of phagocytes into the effusion to remove cellular debris. The result is a mild increase in both total protein (\u05462.5 g/dl) and nucleated cell count (less than 5,000/\u03bcl). Thus, modifi ed transudates are generally transudates that have been present long enough to elicit a mild infl ammatory reaction (see Fig. 6 -6B). It is most often associated with cardiovascular disease or neoplastic conditions. In cases of extended duration, modifi ed transudates can have a cloudy to almost milky gross appearance. Such fl uids strongly resemble chyle and, in fact, have in the past been called \"pseudochylous effusions\" (a term no longer used). The gross appearance of these fl uids is the result of high lipid content (due to higher cholesterol content than serum) but is in no way related to a true chylous effusion, as there are no triglycerides or chylomicrons present (Hillerdal, 1997; Tyler and Cowell, 1989) . The phagocytes attracted to remove cellular debris from transudates are rich in enzymes that digest protein but are virtually devoid of enzymes that will break down complex lipids. Consequently, while most of the constituents of dying cells are removed by phagocytosis, lipid content of the cells simply accumulates in the effusion. Effusions formed in this manner are easily distinguished cytologically from true chylous effusions.",

Classifi cation as an infl ammatory effusion is based primarily on the presence of high total protein (often \u03fe4.5 g/dl) which is a refl ection of a similar elevation in serum protein. Electrophoresis of either the effusion fl uid or the serum reveals a polyclonal gammopathy. An albumin-to-globulin ratio of less than 0.8 on the fl uid is very suggestive for FIP. It has been reported that if gamma globulin is greater than 32% of the protein in the effusion fl uid, this is suggestive of FIP (Shelly et al., 1988 ). An additional test that can help rule in or rule out FIP is the Rivalta test. To perform this relatively simple test, place one drop of 98% acetic acid into 5 ml distilled water and mix well in a reagent tube. Then add slowly one drop of the effusion fl uid to the surface of the acetic acid solution. A positive test requires that the drop of effusion retain its form on the surface or slowly sink to the bottom as a droplet or jellyfi sh-like shape ( Fig. 6-9A ). This test indicates a high protein content as well as fi brin and infl ammatory mediators. This test has a positive predictive value of 86% and a negative predictive value of 97% (Hartmann et al., 2003) . A more specifi c cytologic test for FIP involves immunofl uorescence of intracellular feline coronavirus (FCo V) within effusion macrophages. When positive (Fig 6-9B ), this test is diagnostic for FIP; however, the negative predictive value is 57%, so a negative test may miss cases of FIP (Hartmann et al., 2003) .",

In the more chronic reactions, there is generally a signifi cant reactive mesothelial cell component to the response. A striking feature of the infl ammatory response is the morphology of the neutrophils. Whereas most cases of septic pleuritis and peritonitis are signaled by the presence of predominantly degenerating neutrophils, in nocardial and actinomycotic effusions the majority of the neutrophils away from the organisms are nondegenerate. Degenerating neutrophils are only seen immediately in the vicinity of the bacterial organisms because these agents, in contrast to most other bacteria, produce only weak local toxins. The net effect of this phenomenon is that smears in these cases may be easily misinterpreted as noninfectious, particularly if the organisms are not widespread. Because the particles seen grossly often are composed of bacterial colonies, it is extremely important that squash preparations of these particles be examined to ensure that the diagnosis is not missed (Fig. 6-10A&B) .",

In reactions of greater duration, bile granules may have all been converted to rhomboidal to amorphous golden crystals of bile pigment. When such crystals are found in the cytoplasm of effusion phagocytes in the absence of evidence of prior hemorrhage (e.g., erythrophagocytosis), the possibility of bilious effusion should be strongly considered. In addition to the typical appearance of bilious effusions, acellular, amorphous, fi brillar blue-grey mucinous material ( Fig. 6-13A ) has been associated with biliary tree rupture, particularly of the common bile duct in dogs (Owens et al., 2003) .

Causes for chylous effusions in the thoracic cavity include cardiovascular disease, neoplasia (e.g., lymphoma, thymoma, and lymphangiosarcoma), heartworm disease, diaphragmatic hernia, lung torsion, mediastinal fungal granulomas, chronic coughing, vomiting, or idiopathic (Fossum, 1993; Fossum et al., 1986a; Forrester et al., 1991; Waddle and Giger, 1990) .

            "text": "Cytologic evaluation of pericardial effusion is challenging, but is most valuable in ruling out infection and infl ammation. The pericardium is notorious for eliciting mesothelial hyperplasia. These mesothelial cells become very large and basophilic, often binucleate with prominent nucleoli (see Fig. 6 -3B) and mitotic fi gures. It is often not possible to distinguish these reactive mesothelial cells from possible neoplastic cells. In addition, hemangiosarcoma may cause pericardial hemorrhage, but neoplasia of mesenchymal origin typically will not shed neoplastic cells into effusions. In one study (Sisson et al., 1984) , 74% of 19 neoplastic effusions were not detected on the basis of cytologic fi ndings and 13% of 31 non-neoplastic effusions were falsely reported as positive, leading the authors to conclude that pericardial fl uid analysis did not reliably distinguish neoplastic from non-neoplastic disorders. More recently, cardiac troponins I (cTnI) and T (cTnT) have been evaluated in Observe the erythrophagia, reactive mesothelial cells, macrophage, and small lymphocytes with many red blood cells. Also note that one macrophage contains brown hemosiderin pigment. One mesothelial cell contains two nuclei. Cytologic evaluation of pericardial fl uid is important to rule out infection and some types of neoplasia. Often additional testing is required to determine the cause of hemorrhagic pericardial effusion. (Romanowsky; HP oil.) pericardial fl uid. Results from this study involving 37 dogs suggest that cTNI may be useful in differentiating idiopathic pericardial effusions from those caused by hemangiosarcoma (Shaw et al., 2004) . Further testing is often required (e.g., ultrasonography, coagulation testing, pericardiectomy, fi nding other evidence of trauma) to determine the underlying cause for the effusion. In a study of 51 dogs with pericardial effusions, the pH of the fl uid was examined and compared with a fi nal diagnosis (Edwards, 1996) . When measured by precise instrumentation, the pH indicated that a reading greater than 7.3 was likely due to noninfl ammatory conditions, usually neoplasia. Using a less accurate urinary dipstick, pericardial fl uid pH \u03ed 7.0 was associated with neoplasia in 93% of the cases, while \u03fd7.0 suggested benign or non-neoplastic conditions. The pH of the fl uid needs to be measured shortly after obtaining the sample. A recent study found similar results; however, considerable overlap was detected, thus limiting the usefulness of pH to differentiate the etiology of pericardial effusions (Fine et al., 2003) .",
