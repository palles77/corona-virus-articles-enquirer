The authors have summarised many issues concerning the COVID-19 outbreak including the clinical presentation, epidemiology, treatment, prognosis, prevalence, prevention and response to the outbreak. More importantly, while highlighting lessons learned, they have highlighted a number of important issues particularly delayed release of information about the COVID-19 infection, slowness in preventative measures such as quarantine and travel restrictions to contain the outbreak as well as measures to stop spread of misinformation about the COVID-19 [1] .",

In addition, national and international (public) health organisations have issued guidelines and preventative measures against the coronavirus infection. In addition, some countries have banned large public gathering to contain spread of coronavirus. For example, France has put a ban on crowds of more than 5000 people [9] and Saudi Arabia has temporarily stopped foreign religious pilgrims from visiting Islam's two holiest places in Makkah and Madinah in the country [10] . However, the gender public also needs to follow the public health advice, adopt the suggested preventative measures and comply with the official guidance and measures.",
