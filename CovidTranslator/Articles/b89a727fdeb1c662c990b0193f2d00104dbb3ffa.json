The number of hospitals, number of hospital beds and the average number of hospital beds per hospital were employed to measure the supply capacity. The visit number, inpatients number and bed occupancy rate (BOR) were used to measure the healthcare delivery. The number of outpatients in hospitals by ownership is not available in the dataset of China Health Statistics Yearbook, so we used the visit number and inpatient number instead of the outpatient number [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] . The share of private/public hospitals' number (in all hospitals) was calculated by dividing the number of private/public hospitals by overall number of all types of hospital in China. The share of private/ public hospital beds (in all hospitals) was calculated by dividing the number of private/public hospital beds by overall number of hospital beds in all types of hospitals. The average number of hospital beds per hospital was calculated by dividing the overall number of private or publicly owned hospital beds by overall number of private or publicly owned hospital numbers [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] .

The OECD has included major developed countries in the world. Their experience developing private hospitals can provide reference for China. Table 1 showed the time trend in hospital size on average by private and public hospitals. Both of the private and public hospitals increased in size by year. The average number of hospital beds of the private and public hospitals increased from 45 and 149 beds per hospital in 2005 to 75 and 351 in 2016, respectively. However, the disparity in size between private and public hospitals was increasing. The average publicly owned hospital bed number was around 3.32 times of private in 2005, while 4.67 times in 2016. Combining the results in Figure 1 and Table 1 relatively smaller than the public ones during this period. It should be noticed that, from the aspect of inpatients, the growth of the delivery (represented by the share of inpatients) caught up with the growth of private hospital's supply capacity (represented by the share of private hospital beds). During 2005-2016, the share ratio of private hospital' inpatients and beds maintained around 70%. However, from the aspect of visits, the delivery (represented by the share of visits) lagged behind the growth of private hospital's supply capacity. The share ratio of private hospital's visits and beds decreased from around 80% (4.80%/5.89%) in 2005, to 60% (12.9%/21.69%) in 2016. Figure 4 further compared the BOR of hospital beds between private and public hospitals in China during 2005-2016. The BOR of both private and public hospitals increased from 49.80% and 71.50% in 2005, to 62.80% and 91.00% in 2016, respectively. From Figure 4 , we could fi nd that the BOR of private hospitals reached the highest in 2013 (63.40%), and then slightly decreased in the following years. And the publicly owned hospital had the similar trend and reached the highest in 2012 (94.20%), then went back down a bit. Although the bed occupancy rate of private hospitals was increasing in general, it was still much lower than public hospitals. In 2016, the bed",

Although individual countries, like Chile, had a decline in hospital number, but a growth in hospital beds, showed the expanding size of private hospitals. Second, the new private hospitals' size would be smaller than the public, which was similar with China.

The economic development has greatly improved consumption capacity and boosted the demand for health care [27] , in both the level of individuals and At the individual level, along with the income improvement, people have increasing expectation for health care quality and life quality. As a result, the demand of healthcare is increasing tremendously. In addition, Chinese government also made great efforts to adjust to economic development and growing demands, which put signifi cant pressure on its health care system to become more accessible, affordable, and effi cient. Firstly, the government developed and further improved a system of universal medical insurance with three major insurance programs: Urban Employee Basic Medical Insurance (Urban Employee Insurance) covering individuals employed in the formal sector in cities; Urban Resident Basic Medical Insurance (Urban Resident Insurance) for urban residents, defi ned by household registration status, who are unemployed or who work in the informal sector; and the New Rural Cooperative Medical Insurance (Rural Resident Insurance) for rural residents. In 2002, less than 10% of rural populations and even fewer urban residents had insurance coverage. Currently, more than 95% of citizens are covered by basic medical insurance [27] . Secondly, after the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome virus (SARS) in 2003, the Chinese government has put more budget outlay into health care and changed the financing model from supply-side to demand-side, where government fi nancial support went directly to the demand side (patients) through medical insurance or subsidies rather than public providers (hospitals). Under such circumstances, the average per capita fi nancing level of the basic medical insurance has been elevated. Both the increasing coverage rate and average per capita fi nancing level of basic medical insurance can lessen individual's medical burden significantly, and then lead to more demand of health care [28] .",

In the reform, it was clearly pointed out to \"encourage and guide social sector to develop medical and health undertakings\" [1] . Further, in December 3, 2010, five ministries jointly issued the Optnions on further encourage and guide social sector to hold medical institutions [9] . Since then, series of policies have been implemented to encourage the development of private hospitals in aspects of entry restriction, future planning, evaluation of the basic health insurance programs' appointed hospitals, and tax exemption. For example, to solve the problem of entry restriction, it is clearly pointed out that all the fields where laws permit should be open to the social sector and all the fi elds open to local capital must be open to foreign capital [11] . As for the future planning, if social sectors can meet the standard of entry, they would have the priority to be chosen when confi guring, adjusting and allocating medical and health resources [29] .",

It can be inferred that the new private hospitals would be almost in small size. Besides, most of them are assessed to be primary hospitals. Compared with the high-grade hospitals, which are always the publicly owned hospitals, private hospitals cannot receive patients with serious disease. The policies aiming to control the cost inflation, for example, the promotion of Diagnosis Related Groups (DRGs), also limit the development of private hospitals. DRGs are one of the most striking prospective payment systems around the world in recent years [31] . It groups patients into several DRG categories according to principal diagnosis, type of treatment, age, surgery, and discharge status. Under such circumstances, hospitals are paid a set fee for treating patients in a single DRG category, regardless of the actual cost of care accrued for the individual, as to create incentives for hospitals to control cost and to increase number of inpatient admissions.",

The strict supervision is always thought to be a limitation to the private hospital's development. However, a strict but necessary supervision is important for their sustainable development, for example, the supervision on the classifi cation of non-profi t and for-profit hospitals. In most developed countries, they have a clear definition of \"non-profit\" and \"forprofi t\". In the United States, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) defined the private hospital as \"An organization must be organized and operated exclusively for exempt purposes set forth in section 501(c)(3), including charitable, religious, educational, scientific, literary, testing for public safety, fostering national or international amateur sports competition, and preventing cruelty to children or animals\" [45] . In China, the defi nition of nonprofit hospital is unclear. Meanwhile, social sectors are suggested to be non-profit [46, 47] while whether nonprofi t hospitals perform better in quality [48] , charge [49] and effi ciency [50] is still a controversial question abroad. Considering the reputation, tax policy, a lot of private hospitals that should be defi ned as for-profi t hospitals are defi ned as the non-profi t hospitals mistakenly [51] . Thus, they can be tax-exempt and then transfer profi ts through varies channels [52] . They leave the bad impression in people's mind and then go from bad to worse fi nally. In this case, efforts on stricter supervision should be made to prevent such things and improve the competitiveness of private hospitals.",
