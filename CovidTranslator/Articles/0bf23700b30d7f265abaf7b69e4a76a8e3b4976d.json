The aim of the present study was to investigate the potential effects of overexpressed endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) on cell proliferation and apoptosis with SIRT1 activation in the Min6 mouse pancreatic \u03b2 cell line. A pcDNA3.0-eNOS plasmid was constructed and transfected into Min6 cells for 24 h prior to harvesting. eNOS expression was validated and SIRT1 expression was detected following plasmid transfection using reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blot analysis, which demonstrated that the expression levels of eNOS and SIRT1 were significantly upregulated. Furthermore, the cell proliferation and cell apoptosis of the Min6 cells were evaluated, using a cell counting kit-8 assay and flow cytometry, respectively. The results suggested that overexpressed eNOS promoted cell proliferation and inhibited cell apoptosis in Min6 cells. The interaction between eNOS and SIRT1 was explored through co-immunoprecipitation, and it found that there was a strong interaction between eNOS and SIRT1. In conclusion, overexpressed eNOS may induce SIRT1 activation, which is implied to play a protective role in Min6 cells, and eNOS may be a new therapeutic target for diseases such as type 2 diabetes.",

This suggests that SIRT1 may be a promising novel therapeutic target for diabetic complications and recognized as a key regulator of vascular endothelial homeostasis, controlling angiogenesis, endothelial senescence and dysfunction (8) . It is reported that the activation of SIRT1 prevents hyperglycemia-induced vascular cell senescence and protects against vascular dysfunction in mice with diabetes, which suggests a protective role of SIRT1 in the pathogenesis of diabetic vasculopathy (9) . According to another study, mitochondrial biogenesis can be enhanced by resveratrol through the 5'-adenosine monophosphate-activated kinase/SIRT1 pathway in muscle and liver, resulting in extension of life span or amelioration of high-fat diet-induced metabolic impairment, including obesity and insulin resistance (10) .",

Firstly, evidence that SIRT1 was activated by overexpressed eNOS was provided, which was achieved through recombinant plasmid transfection. Secondly, overexpressed eNOS promoted mouse pancreatic \u03b2 cell proliferation and protected mouse pancreatic \u03b2 cells from cell apoptosis. Thirdly, a strong protein-protein interaction between eNOS and SIRT1 was demonstrated. Furthermore, the present study implied that overexpressed eNOS may induce SIRT1 activation, which is indicated to have a protective role in Min6 cells. NO is produced by three isoforms of NO synthase (NOS): Neuronal nNOS (NOS I), inducible iNOS (NOS II) and endothelial eNOS (NOS III) (17) . Under physiological conditions, vascular NO is mostly produced by eNOS. It is known that NO reduces oxidative stress and the progression of atherosclerosis (18) , and exerts cardioprotective and vasoprotective effects in endothelial cells though a regulatory effect for inhibition of platelet aggregation, blood flow and inflammatory cell adhesion (19, 20) , while SIRT1 has previously been identified as a critical regulator of vascular endothelial homeostasis, controlling angiogenesis, endothelial senescence and dysfunction (8, 21) . A recent study has shown that SIRT1 is an endogenous protective molecule and a promising novel therapeutic target against myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (MI/R)-induced injury, which reduces oxidative stress and diabetes-exacerbated injury via the activation of eNOS in diabetic rats (11) . As Lemarie et al (22) reported, some effective antioxidants, including resveratrol, have been shown to act via the stimulation of endothelial SIRT1, which regulates endothelium-dependent vasodilation and bioavailable NO, stimulates eNOS activity and increases endothelial NO. However, eNOS-mediated NO also regulates SIRT1 expression during the aging of endothelial cells; the uncoupling of eNOS results in decreased expression of SIRT1, and ultimately to increased stress-induced senescence (22) . It has also been reported that the interaction of SIRT1 with eNOS is important in the augmentation of the protective effect of statins against endothelial senescence, as it was shown that testosterone induced eNOS activity, and subsequently increased SIRT1 expression in endothelial cells (23) . In type 2 diabetic rats, . Interaction between eNOS and SIRT1. Min6 cells were treated with pcDNA3.0-eNOS for 24 h, and proteins were extracted for co-immunoprecipitation with anti-SIRT1 and probed with anti-eNOS or anti-SIRT1. The bands for SIRT1-immunoprecipitated eNOS were scanned and normalized with GAPDH. All experiments were repeated independently three times. eNOS, endothelial nitric oxide synthase; SIRT1, sirtuin 1. Figure 3 . Upregulation of eNOS promoted the growth of Min6 cells in vitro. Cell numbers were counted at the following time points: 12, 24, 48 and 72 h. Cell viability was measured using a cell counting kit-8 assay. Data are shown as the mean \u00b1 standard deviation. All experiments were repeated independently three times. * P<0.05, ** P<0.01 and *** P<0.001 vs. the data from pcDNA3.0 only group detected at the same time. eNOS, endothelial nitric oxide synthase. a reduction in the cellular redox status and an increase in oxidant stress may work together to reduce vascular SIRT1 expression (24) (25) (26) . Furthermore, eNOS expression levels have also been shown to be low within cerebral arteries, which implies a connection between SIRT1 and eNOS (27) .",

Effect of overexpressed eNOS on SIRT1 expression at the mRNA and protein levels. In order to determine the effect of eNOS on SIRT1, SIRT1 expression at the mRNA and protein levels was detected, as shown in Fig. 2.

Effect of overexpressed eNOS on Min6 cell proliferation. The effects of eNOS overexpression on Min6 cell proliferation were examined. As shown in the CCK-8 assay results in Fig. 3, the cellular population was increased time-dependently in the pcDNA3.0-eNOS transfection group compared with the negative control (pcDNA3.0) group, particularly at 48 h (P<0.01) and 72 h (P<0.001).Overexpression of eNOS reduced apoptosis of the Min6 cell line. Cell apoptosis was analyzed using flow cytometry following pcDNA3.0-eNOS transfection for 24 h based on the CCK-8 results. Exposure of Min6 cells to the recombinant eNOS plasmid inhibited the apoptosis of the cells compared with that in the negative control group. Furthermore, the occurrence of apoptosis was significantly lower (P<0.001) in the pcDNA3.0-eNOS group compared with the pcDNA3.0 group (negative control), as shown inFig. 4.",
