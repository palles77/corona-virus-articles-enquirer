In addition to the viruses examined in our study, rhinovirus may upregulate pneumococcal adherence to respiratory epithelial cells 9 , and it is possible that coronavirus and human metapneumovirus (an important cause of virus-associated pneumonia in this population 10 ) may be also involved in the pathogenesis of bacterial pneumonia.

The data in Table 1 suggest that the population-based effect of the vaccine on total pneumonia, including virus-associated pneumonias, should be considered in terms of total cases prevented and the cost-effectiveness of the vaccine. We have also shown that the vaccine is a useful probe that has established, for the first time to our knowledge, that a significant fraction of viral pneumonia is attributable to bacterial coinfection and is preventable by a bacterial vaccine. Because immunization of children has been shown to reduce invasive pneumococcal disease in adults 13 , our data suggest that studies should be developed to investigate the strategy of infant immunization with pneumococcal conjugate vaccine to reduce morbidity and mortality associated with influenza and other viral pneumonias in both children and adults. There are no studies so far linking molecular regulation of lymphangiogenesis and induction of adaptive immunity. Here, we show that blockade of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-3 (VEGFR-3) signaling significantly suppresses corneal antigen-presenting (dendritic) cell trafficking to draining lymph nodes, induction of delayed-type hypersensitivity and rejection of corneal transplants. Regulating the function of VEGFR-3 may therefore be a mechanism for modulating adaptive immunity in the periphery.",

In its center, the normal cornea is devoid of mature dendritic cells, which are capable of stimulating T cells 1 , and lymphatic vessels, which allow efficient trafficking of antigen-presenting cells (APC) to lymphoid organs 2 . By contrast, the inflamed cornea eventually acquires both of these factors 1 to induce immunogenic inflammation that can jeopardize vision. To investigate the relationship between corneal inflammation and lymphangiogenesis and to determine the functional relevance of 4) to corneal immunity, we induced corneal inflammation using a mouse model of corneal hemangiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis 1 (Fig. 1a) . After 7-14 d, we collected eyes for immunofluorescence confocal microscopic studies 1 . A sharp increase in VEGFR-3 expression was evident in the stroma of these inflamed corneas. Expression was present on both stromal dendritic cells 5 and newly developed lymphatics in the center of these inflamed corneas (Fig.  1b) . Staining with lymphatic vessel endothelial hyaluronan receptor 6 (LYVE-1) confirmed the growth of new lymphatic vessels (Fig. 1c) , which also stained positive for VEGFR-3 (Fig. 1d) , into the periphery of the normally lymphatic-free corneas. Flow cytometric studies showed that 90% of cultured corneal dendritic cells 1 expressed VEGFR-3 (Fig. 1e) , similar to these cells' acquisition of major histocompatibility class II expression as they mature in culture 1 . Control stromal fibroblasts (keratocytes) 7 did not show expression of VEGFR-3 (Fig. 1e) . Our results from the transwell chemotaxis assay 8, 9 demonstrated that these dendritic cells migrated in response to VEGF-C, a principal VEGFR-3 ligand, in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1f) . This migration was blocked by a VEGFR-3/immunoglobulin (Ig) chimeric molecule that prevents VEGFR-3 ligation (Fig. 1g) .",

Corneal transplantation is a particularly suitable model because it allows for quantification of graft-derived APC trafficking to regional lymph nodes by identification of donor type (H-2I-A b ) MHC class II cells 1 . Our data revealed that local (ocular) blockade of VEGFR-3 reduced corneal dendritic cell trafficking to draining lymph nodes of the host in a dose-dependent fashion (Fig. 2a) . To confirm this effect by flow cytometry, bilateral submandibular lymph nodes were harvested for quantification of cornea-derived cells. Such cells were readily seen in ipsilateral, but not contralateral, nodes after transplantation under cover of control Fc/Ig (Fig. 2b) . However, administration of blocking VEGFR-3/Ig led to a significant suppression in graft-derived cell flow (Fig. 2b) to ipsilateral lymph nodes.",
