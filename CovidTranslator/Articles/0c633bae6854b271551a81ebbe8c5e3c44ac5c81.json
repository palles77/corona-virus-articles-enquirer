Traditional methods of diagnosing respiratory viruses including direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) and enzyme immunoassay (EIA) provide results within hours, but are limited in scope, sensitivity, and positive predictive value. Viral cultures are very specific, but are time consuming and technically demanding. New molecular techniques to detect respiratory viruses are gaining popularity. Compared with traditional methods, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), or nucleic acid tests (NATs), can increase sensitivity of detecting common respiratory viruses, such as rhinovirus and enterovirus as well as identify emerging viruses, including human metapneumovirus (hMPV), coronavirus, and bocavirus. As molecular laboratory techniques become more widespread, we have the potential to detect a wide range of established and newly discovered viruses. However, interpretation of a positive result must be made cautiously in the context of a patient's clinical illness as a positive result may signify the presence of the virus, but does not necessarily indicate that the virus is causing a patient's clinical symptoms 10 . Our objective was to compare the results of molecular techniques and conventional diagnostic methods in a cohort of hospitalized children with and without symptoms of respiratory viral illness (RVI).",

The infant and toddler ward cares primarily for children three years of age and younger with a wide range of underlying medical issues. The Johns Hopkins Hospital has a comprehensive 2-stage program to identify and isolate children with contagious respiratory viruses 9, 11 .

We categorized patient presentations into 'with RVI symptoms' if they exhibited upper/lower respiratory tract symptoms consistent with a respiratory viral illness (e.g. rhinorrhea, congestion, cough, apnea, wheezing, tachypnea, hypoxia) or subtle symptoms like unexplained fever at the time of admission or within 4 days of hospitalization, and 'without RVI symptoms' if there were no symptoms consistent with a respiratory viral illness at the time of admission or within 4 days of hospitalization.",

ResPlexII panel amplification and detection were performed as per manufacturer's instructions. The software does not define a cut-off for positivity. Several studies have used a variety of cutoff values for analysis. In our study, ResPlexII results were initially analyzed using four cutoff values-three times background, \u226550, \u2265100, or \u2265150 MFI values. The three times background cut-off was selected because it demonstrated excellent overall agreement with the other methods and it allowed inter-run data normalization by accounting for run-to-run variability in background fluorescence. For the purposes of this study, Flu A and B were not differentiated, and coronaviruses were combined due to small numbers. Also, RSV A and B were not differentiated and bocavirus was not included in the analysis. Bocaviruses can be detected with ResPlexII and detection reagents were initially available in the RVS/MS panel but were dropped from the product during the course of this study. Due to the change in the RVS/MS product and to the unresolved diagnostic utility of bocavirus testing, we elected not to perform an analysis of bocavirus detection by ResPlexII.",

This increased detection was largely due to the 25% of patients identified with a Group 2 virus that were not detected by conventional methods. Conventional and molecular assays detected a similar percent of patients with Group 1 viruses (48.6% v 57.4%, p=0.13). However, when comparing positive results from NATs and conventional tests that provide results within 48 hours (EIA, DFA, shell vial culture), then NATs increased virus detection (57.4% v 43.2%, p=0.01).",

In our cohort, molecular tests did not increase the overall detection of Group 1 viruses compared with conventional tests in children with RVI symptoms. This increased sensitivity of conventional tests may be attributed to the use of tube culture for virus detection in our laboratory. However, when compared with the results from conventional testing available within 48 hours, there was an increase in detection of Group 1 viruses by NATs.

Interestingly, molecular assays detected an almost equal percentage of Group 2 viruses in both symptomatic and asymptomatic children, suggesting that these viruses may commonly be present in the respiratory tracts of young children. This has been shown previously with rhinovirus 18, [24] [25] [26] .

We have confirmed prior reports that molecular tests increase sensitivity and rapidity of detection when compared with traditional methods 4, [14] [15] [16] [17] 27 . However, increased sensitivity may not always improve clinical outcomes and influence clinician behavior. A few randomized trials have studied the impact of viral testing on patient management [28] [29] [30] . Bonner et al showed no differences in management for children with respiratory viral illness, except for influenza. Another randomized trial of influenza rapid testing showed that the use of a rapid test did not influence clinician behavior 31 . Molecular testing can increase detection of Group 2 viruses like rhinovirus and enterovirus, but in the absence of available therapeutics, unless a positive test limits antibiotic usage or further diagnostic testing, the testing results may not change the course of treatment or improve patient outcomes. Recent research suggests that there may be an association between rhinovirus induced wheezing and childhood asthma [32] [33] [34] , but the role and availability of antiviral therapy in these children remains in question. Rapid detection of respiratory viruses is used to isolate contagious patients to prevent transmission of viruses between hospitalized patients. Increased detection of PCR positive but culture negative patients may have negative consequences, such as unnecessary isolation of hospitalized patients. Further studies are needed to assess the impact of these diagnostic tests on patient outcomes as more clinical labs begin to use molecular tests to detect respiratory viruses.",

However, the groups with and without available specimens were otherwise similar and had equal proportions of children with RVI symptoms, so our study population and findings should reflect the entire the cohort. Second, there is no standard method for detection of respiratory viruses. Because NATs can have false positives, we compared results from 2 large multiplex NATs, and found overall good concordance. When these NATs were discordant, we used a third molecular assay such as singleplex RT-PCR or x-TAG RVP to confirm the result. Also, ResPlexII demonstrated some cross reactivity in detecting rhinovirus and enterovirus and hence their positive results are reported in combination as rhinovirus/enterovirus. Finally, this is a single institution study of hospitalized patients and our findings may not be generalizable to other institutions and settings, but the general advantages and disadvantages of molecular testing still likely remain.",
