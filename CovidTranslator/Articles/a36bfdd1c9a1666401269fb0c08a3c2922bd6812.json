Twelve (50.0%) cases showed typical CT images of ground-glass chest and 5 (20.8%) presented stripe shadowing in the lungs. The remaining 7 (29.2%) cases showed normal CT image and had no symptoms during hospitalization. These 7 cases were younger (median age: 14.0 years; P = 0.012) than the rest. None of the 24 cases developed severe COVID-19 pneumonia or died. The median communicable period, defined as the interval from the first day of positive nucleic acid tests to the first day of continuous negative tests, was 9.5 days (up to 21 days among the 24 asymptomatic cases). Through epidemiological investigation, we observed a typical asymptomatic transmission to the cohabiting family members, which even caused severe COVID-19 pneumonia. All rights reserved.

Genetic analysis of COVID-19 revealed that the virus was similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) 7 . Unlike SARS-CoV, transmission of COVID-19 occurs during the prodromal period when those infected are mildly ill, and carry on usual activities, which contributes to the spread of infection 8, 9 . According to the report on \"Diamond Princess\", among the 1,723 tested travelers, 189 asymptomatic individuals were positive for the COVID-19 virus as of 17 February 2020 10 , which indicated that a large number of asymptomatic carriers and mild patients remain undiscovered in the community. It is crucial to identify and isolate asymptomatic carriers and mild patients in order to contain the outbreaks in later stages.",

We collected the contact history and followed longitudinal nucleic acid tests of the close contacts during their hospitalization, which provided a relatively reliable communicable period of asymptomatic cases. However, it is notable that the real communicable period was longer than was calculated, due to the censored data of 6 patients and the indeterminate date of the exact first infection.

To date, accumulated evidence has indicated person-to-person transmission both in hospital and family settings 2-6 . Since January 23, 2020, the source city was locked down to suppress the spread of the disease; however, the massive human movement during the traditional Chinese New Year holidays might have fueled the spread of the disease. At present, there were at least 10,000 cases in other provinces, mostly identified through symptoms plus recent travel history to Hubei province, China.",
