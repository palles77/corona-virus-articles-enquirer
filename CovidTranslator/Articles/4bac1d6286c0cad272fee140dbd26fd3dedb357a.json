An analysis of 480 BALF samples was performed in patients with hematological malignancies over a period of 7 years. The results of culture methods, PCR, and immunoenzymatic sandwich microplate assays for Aspergillus galactomannan (GM) in BALF were analyzed. Further, the diagnostic thresholds for Aspergillus GM and Pneumocystis jiroveci were also calculated. Microbiological findings were present in 87% of BALF samples. Possible infectious pathogens were detected in 55% of cases; 32% were classified as colonizing. No significant difference in diagnostic yield or pathogen spectrum was found between non-neutropenic and neutropenic patients. There was one significant difference in BALF findings among intensive care units (ICU) versus non-ICU patients for Aspergillus spp. (22% versus 9%, p = 0.03). The most common pathogens were Aspergillus spp. (n = 86, 33% of BAL with causative pathogens) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 46, 18%); polymicrobial etiology was documented in 20% of cases. A quantitative PCR value of > 1860 cp/mL for Pneumocystis jirovecii was set as a diagnostic threshold for pneumocystis pneumonia. The absorbance index of GM in BALF of 0.5 was set as a diagnostic threshold for aspergillosis. The examination of BAL fluid revealed the presence of pathogen in more than 50% of cases and is, therefore, highly useful in this regard when concerning pulmonary infiltrates.",

Since 2013, commercial kits for the detection of these respiratory viruses have been available using the PCR Anyplex\u2122 II RV 16 kit (Seegene, Inc., South Korea): influenza (INF) A, B, parainfluenza (PIV) 1-4, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) A, B, human metapneumovirus (hMPV), human rhinovirus (HRV) A/B/C, human adenovirus, human coronavirus 229E, NL63, OC 43, human enterovirus, human bocavirus 1/2/3/4. The Platelia\u00ae Aspergillus EIA (Bio-Rad Laboratories, USA) immunoenzymatic sandwich microplate assay was used for detection of Aspergillus GM. The absorbance is determined with a spectrophotometer set at 450-and 620-nm wavelength. The presence of herpes simplex virus (HSV) and human cytomegalovirus (CMV) was tested using a Gene Proof system, whereas Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex and non-tuberculous mycobacteria were detected using the Anyplex MTB/NTM Real-time PCR kit (Seegene Inc., South Korea). All real-time PCR assays were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions using Rotor Gene (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and Light Cycler realtime PCR machines (Roche, AG, Switzerland). While the sensitivity of both techniques is comparable, the commercial methods offer a quicker analysis and reduced workload. All described PCR methods were validated annually and verified and controlled by an international system of quality control, QCMD (Quality Control for Molecular Diagnostics, Glasgow, UK). The quantitative tests express the pathogen load as number of DNA copies per milliliter of BALF (cp/mL). The limit of detection for each test was HSV type 1 = 213 cp/mL; HSV type 2 = 275 cp/mL; CMV = 100 cp/mL (equivalent of 79.4 IU/mL), Pneumocystis jirovecii = 100 cp/mL; Aspergillus spp. = 50 cp/mL.

The relatively minor difference between both groups might be attributed to the fact that these non-neutropenic patients were immunocompromised; further, most of them had undergone chemotherapy and had previous episodes of (Kuehnhardt et al. 2009 ). Detection of Aspergillus spp. (by any method) was more frequent in ICU patients. The fact that Aspergillus is a common finding in BALF of ICU patients has been previously reported (Zarrinfar et al. 2013; Khodavaisy et al. 2015) and might be the reflection of the overall severity of ICU patients. The etiological agents of pneumonia were considered polymicrobial in 20% of our cases. The incidence of pulmonary polymicrobial infections in patients with hematological malignancies and pulmonary infiltrates can vary from 20 to 60% (Rolston et al. 2007; Hardak et al. 2016) . This wide range is likely due to different definitions for bacterial and viral pneumonia, as well as differences in laboratory methods. An Israel study ) that included PCR methods reported the same proportion of polymicrobial pneumonia (21%) in similar patients' cohort. A recent Beijing study (Tang et al. 2018 ) using various flexible bronchoscopy methods determined the polymicrobial etiology in 47% of cases. Contrasting to our work, this work also described viruses as the most common infectious etiology of pneumonia (70%). These results were influenced by their patients' cohort (allogeneic HSCT recipients only), different definition of the Bacteria plus fungi plus virus infectious pneumonia as well as different PCR diagnostic criteria (much lower cutoff for significant PCR DNA CMV quantity in BALF and larger diagnostic spectrum including of EBV, polyomavirus, and others). Another work focusing on HSCT recipients admitted to the ICU described the polymicrobial findings in 30% of patients and worked with results from blood cultures, low PCR DNA CMV cutoff and serum GM. All these differences explain higher reported percentage of polymicrobial etiology of pneumonia.",

The microbiological agents isolated from BALF samples are not always relevant for etiology of pulmonary infiltrates and should therefore be interpreted critically (Maschmeyer et al. 2015) . We report coagulase-negative staphylococci, alpha-hemolytic streptococci, and enterococci as the most common bacteria found in BALF samples, same as with other authors (Eriksson et al. 1996; Kuehnhardt et al. 2009 ). The significance of these organisms obtained from BAL samples remains unclear as most of them occur as commensals and rarely cause pneumonia (Kuehnhardt et al. 2009 ). However, some authors suggest that immunocompromised patients can develop pneumonia from these agents regardless (Kuehnhardt et al. 2009 ). All of these bacteria are abundant in mouth or oropharynx and can adhere to the bronchoscope during examination; therefore, we considered them as contaminating/colonizing agents. In similar manner, detected anaerobic bacteria were considered to be contamination from the oral flora since none of our patients had a lung abscess.",

The diagnosis of HSV pneumonia needs to be confirmed by isolating the virus from respiratory secretions, either BALF samples or lung tissue, and by demonstrating viral cytopathic effects through histopathology (Azoulay 2011) . Molecular detection techniques may be too sensitive and detect HSV in the lungs of asymptomatic individuals (Gooskens et al. 2007; Agusti and Torres 2009) . Oral contamination following mucosal reactivation may also play a role in HSV detection in BALF samples (Gooskens et al. 2007) .

In this regard, viral load in BAL samples and their association with CMV pneumonitis in solid organ transplant recipients were studied with contradictory results (Tan et al. 2016 ). We could not correlate viral load with CMV pneumonia itself (defined by Ljungman et al. (2002) ), as the final diagnosis was not confirmed for any cases in our cohort. Based on an expert panel discussion, \u2265 10,000 cp CMV DNA/ mL per BALF sample was considered clinically significant. All patients with such CMV DNA quantity in their BALF samples had generally lower (100 cp/mL) or negative viral load in peripheral blood at the time of BAL collection.",

Malcolm et al. (2001) and Parody et al. (2007) mentioned the common appearance of picornaviruses with other ongoing co-pathogens.

Our patient cohorts were similar, but the strict criteria used in the definition of bacterial or viral pneumonia in Hardak's work may have played a crucial role in the observed difference. On the other hand, Kuehnhardt et al. (2009) reported only 16% mortality related to pneumonia. Their cohort of 58 examinations contained 2 allogenic HSCT recipients, compared to our 82, which may explain the mortality difference. Multiple factors contribute to the high mortality and morbidity of HSCT recipients with pulmonary complications, e.g., T and B cell status and reconstitution after HSCT, immunosuppressive therapy, degree of neutropenia, presence and grade of graft versus host disease and its treatment, and status of the hematological disease at the time of HSCT.",

Some BALF results can be available as quickly as in a few hours (direct microscopy examination, some PCR methods), some can take up to days to weeks (e.g. 7 days for fungal culture, up to 6 weeks for mycobacteria cultivation). It is impossible in retrospective work to find out whether a change of antimicrobial treatment was based mainly on BAL results or on a change of patient's clinical status along with other examinations results. Hence, we analyzed the most important unbiased outcome: mortality. It remains undetermined whether acting on BALF results reduces mortality rates. Mortality related to ongoing pneumonia in our cohort was not influenced by positive nor negative microbiological results of BAL, nor type of agents or agranulocytosis < 1000/\u03bcL. The only significant mortality predictor was prior HSCT (p = 0.023), but it was independent on BAL results. A Beijing work (Tang et al. 2018 ) studying an impact of flexible bronchoscopy in patients after allogeneic HSCT showed no difference in 30-day mortality between patients in positive and negative FB groups. Rano et al. (2001) demonstrated a decreased mortality rate if treatment was adjusted as soon as possible based on the results from early diagnostics combining several methods, including BAL. Another study (Kuehnhardt et al. 2009 ) described the change in antibiotic treatment based on BAL results in a minority of patients with no difference in mortality rate.",
