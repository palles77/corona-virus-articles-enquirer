This study aimed to describe secondary cases of MERS-CoV infection among healthcare workers and to identify risk factors for death. Methods: A retrospective analysis was conducted on epidemiological data of laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV cases reported to the World Health Organization from September 2012 to 2 June 2018. We compared all secondary cases among healthcare workers with secondary cases among non-healthcare workers. Multivariable logistic regression identified risk factors for death. Results: Of the 2223 laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV cases reported to WHO, 415 were healthcare workers and 1783 were non-healthcare workers. Compared with non-healthcare workers cases, healthcare workers cases were younger (P < 0.001), more likely to be female (P < 0.001), non-nationals (P < 0.001) and asymptomatic (P < 0.001), and have fewer comorbidities (P < 0.001) and higher rates of survival (P < 0.001).",

Conclusion: Being able to protect healthcare workers from high threat respiratory pathogens, such as MERS-CoV is important for being able to reduce secondary transmission of MERS-CoV in healthcareassociated outbreaks. By extension, reducing infection in healthcare workers improves continuity of care for all patients within healthcare facilities.",

Healthcare-associated transmission of MERS-CoV has been reported in France, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Republic of Korea and the United Kingdom and has on occasion resulted in large outbreaks [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] . Secondary transmission has occurred between patients, from patients to healthcare workers, and from patients to visitors of the hospital. To date, there has been limited evidence of transmission documented between healthcare workers in Saudi Arabia [10] and anecdotal evidence from healthcare workers to patients in Saudi Arabia [10] . Because HCW have not been consistently tested for MERS-CoV infection, nor has detailed outbreak investigations occurred within all hospital outbreaks, the role of healthcare workers in onward transmission remains unclear. Given the large number of HCWs infected to date, it is possible that HCW can propagate an outbreak within a healthcare facility. Among reported secondary MERS cases in such outbreaks, a substantial proportion have been healthcare workers [3, 4, [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] .",

This is similar to other respiratory pathogens: in the 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome, 23% of cases in Hong Kong, 40% in Canada and 41% in Singapore were healthcare workers [19] . Protecting health care workers from infectious hazards is paramount to ensuring their safety in delivering health care. In addition, being able to protect healthcare workers, constituting the front line response against high-threat respiratory pathogens, such as MERS-CoV, is important for reducing secondary transmission in healthcare-associated outbreaks.

The highest burden of MERS cases to date is in Saudi Arabia where healthcare workers are more likely to be female, a large proportion of whom are expatriates. The younger age and fewer comorbidities may partly explain the higher survival observed among healthcare workers, as well as the possibility of earlier identification or suspicion of MERS among healthcare workers. Indeed, the case fatality rate among all healthcare workers was 5.8% compared with 42.8% among all non-healthcare workers. This is the first study to perform multivariable logistic regression to identify risk factors for death among 338 healthcare workers with secondary infections reported to date. The analysis showed that year of infection (2013-2018) and having no comorbidities were independent protective factors against death. The decline in risk of death since 2013 may reflect the substantial improvements in surveillance and the infection prevention and control measures that have been introduced in affected countries in recent years. In Saudi Arabia, for example, the Ministry of Health regularly review and update national infection prevention and control guidelines, according to which, healthcare workers who had unprotected \"high-risk exposure\" (within 1.5 m of the patient) or have suggestive symptoms regardless of exposure type are required to stop performing their duties immediately; to have a nasopharyngeal swab tested for MERS-CoV; to not resume their duties until cleared by the infection control team and to delay travel until cleared by infection control team [20] . Any healthcare worker who tests positive for MERS, any healthcare worker who develops MERS suggestive symptoms and any healthcare worker who had unprotected high-risk exposure are considered clear and able to resume work if they meet all of the following criteria: asymptomatic for at least 48 h, and the 14-day observation period is over, and they have at least one negative RT-PCR [20] .",
