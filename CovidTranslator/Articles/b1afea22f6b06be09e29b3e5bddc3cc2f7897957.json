This study finds that one additional day with a maximum temperature of 30-32\u00b0C (86-89.6\u00b0F), relative to a day with a temperature of 28-30\u00b0C (82.4-86\u00b0F), decreases the birth rate 9 months later by 0.24%, or 92 babies per month in South Korea.

The effect of rising temperatures due to greenhouse gas emissions has become even more pronounced. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (2014) found that, in 2010, global emissions of carbon dioxide were twice that of 1970. Greenhouse gas emissions increase the ambient temperature as they absorb and release radiation in the thermal infrared range. Previous literature has documented the fact that summers have become increasingly hot due to this phenomenon. For example, Habeeb et al. (2015) found that the frequency and intensity of heat waves increased significantly between 1961 and 2010 across 50 US cities.",

First, this study analyzes relatively recent data, obtained between 2009 and 2013. Presenting results based on recent data can be a valuable addition to the literature because populations adapt to extreme weather; thus, a prediction of the effect of future temperature is likely to be more reliable when it is based on recent data. Second, when estimating the temperature effect, this study compares birth rate and birth outcomes within the same city/month over time. This prevents the possibility of bias when comparing different months in the same city or different cities within the same month. Thus, the analysis is a cohort analysis. According to Hsiang (2016) , this is a strengthening of the unit homogeneity assumption because different cohorts within the same unit are comparable. Since the data does not span a long period, the same city/month can be assumed to be homogeneous over time. Third, this study focuses on the influence of summer heat because rising temperatures impact people. Therefore, this study employs daily maximum temperatures rather than the daily average temperatures used in prior studies, because average temperatures may not accurately reflect the extent of the summer heat, as experienced by people.",

Avoidance or lack of pregnancy because of hot weather decreases the number of newborns 9 months after a heat exposure event. 4 Resuming efforts to become pregnant immediately thereafter increases the number of newborns 10 months after the heat exposure event (delayed pregnancy). If the pregnancy period is shortened, the number of newborns in the expected month will decrease. For example, if the pregnancy period is shortened by 1 month, babies that were expected to be born 1 month later will be born in this month. In this case, this month will see an increase in the number of newborns, and the next month will see a decrease. 5 Studies on the effect of temperature on birth outcomes have shown mixed results. Some studies found that high temperatures cause a low birth weight (Desch\u00eanes et al. 2009; Andal\u00f3n et al. 2016; Barreca et al. 2018 ) and preterm births (Dadvand et al. 2011; Strand et al. 2011; Barreca et al. 2018) , possibly because, at high temperatures, blood flow to the uterus decreases (Basu et al. 2010 ) and the body secretes stress hormones, such as cortisol (Yackerson et al. 2008) . However, other studies found no significant effect on birth outcomes (Porter et al. 1999; Tustin et al. 2004; Lee et al. 2008) . 6",

Temp is a variable representing the daily maximum temperature of each month and consists of the following six categories: < 22\u00b0C, 22-24\u00b0C, 24-26\u00b0C, 26-28\u00b0C, 30-32\u00b0C, and \u2265 32\u00b0C. Using categorical variables for temperature is now standard across the literature (Dell et al. 2014) . For example, \u2265 32\u00b0C indicates the number of days in a month for which the daily maximum temperature is equal to or greater than 32\u00b0C. The superscript 6 of the Temp variable represents \u2265 32\u00b0C, and 1 represents < 22\u00b0C. The bin of 28-30\u00b0C is excluded from the equation and is used as a comparison category. 10 If no bin is excluded, the coefficients for each temperature bin indicate the value of the dependent variable, and, therefore, one should compare the coefficients to examine how a temperature bin affects the birth rate relative to another temperature bin. Excluding a bin exempts us from doing so. This study includes the temperature of the current month and past temperatures from up to 12 months prior in the equation. If, for example, Temp 6 ct-9 has a value of 3, then city c experienced 3 days of maximum temperature of \u2265 32\u00b0C 9 months previously. In addition, Rain is a variable representing the total precipitation of each month and consists of the following three categories: < The number for each city is calculated by dividing the number of days for each bin in a city in a year by 60 (= 12 months \u00d7 5 years). The number for the month is calculated by dividing the weighted sum of days for each bin in a city in a month by 810 (= 162 cities \u00d7 5 years).

This variable is included because it is known to affect health outcomes (Dell et al. 2014 ). The vector X includes the mothers' average age and education at the city/year-month level. Education is the proportion of mothers with no college degree. These variables are included because the mother's characteristics are likely to affect the number of births. Although the maximum temperature in a city on a given day is determined randomly, following Barreca et al. (2018) , this study includes a variety of fixed effects in the regression to address the confounding of unobserved factors. In the equation, \u03b7 is the city/month fixed effect, and thus the birth rate of the same city/month is compared over time. That is to say, the January birth rate of a city in a year is compared with the January birth rate of the city in other years. Without this variable, it is difficult to know whether the differences in birth rates are due to variations in temperature or variations in characteristics of the month or of cities. \u03b3 is the year/month fixed effect. This variable controls for factors affecting the whole country in a certain year/month. For example, avoiding pregnancy when suspecting, say, a Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus infection will reduce the number of newborns 9 months later. If we do not control for this variable, we cannot tell whether the low number of newborns can be attributed to the virus or to the weather.",

That is, air pollution occurring in a certain month is not likely to affect temperature in the near future and thus is not likely to bias the estimates.

The difference may arise because the present study examines relatively recent data, while Barreca et al. (2018) analyze data obtained from 1931 to 2010. That is to say, people in modern times may respond differently to summer heat than people in the past. The former may use air conditioning more frequently than the latter and might be more accustomed to summer heat because they experience hot days more frequently. In fact, Barreca et al. (2018) found that the effect size declined after the 1960s. One additional factor that may make a difference in the two studies is that the mothers included in this study have a relatively high level of education. As shown in Table 2 , mothers with no college degree account only for 39%, and the rest have a higher degree. Assuming that highly educated people have more knowledge about heat avoidance and more resources to follow through on this knowledge, this study should find smaller temperature effects.",
