            "text": "Influenza A viruses are zoonotic pathogens that infect a variety of domestic poultry such as chickens, turkeys, ducks, and geese. [1] [2] [3] From the mid-1970s, investigations have revealed reservoirs of influenza viruses present in wild bird populations and domestic poultry. 2, 4, 5 Surveillance for influenza viruses within live bird markets (LBMs) has been recognized as an effective tool for detecting circulating influenza subtypes in the poultry population. 6 Live bird markets are ideal sites for virus mixing and transmission because of their nature of congregating birds from various farms coupled with the practices of mixing newly arrived birds with those that have been in the market for extended periods. Since the 1970s, influenza viruses have been isolated from birds in LBMs in multiple countries. From 7% to 30% of fecal swabs from ducks were positive for circulating H3, H4, H5, H6, H7, and H9 influenza virus subtypes in LBMs in Taiwan, Vietnam, and Hong Kong in the 1980s before the onset of the H5N1, H7N2, and H9N2 poultry epidemics in Southeast Asia. 7, 8 Influenza viruses have also been detected in various environmental specimens collected in contaminated areas in LBMs including drinking water troughs, and surfaces in the delivery, holding and slaughter areas in markets. 9, 10 In a study in Hong Kong, influenza A (H9N2) was isolated in 1% of fecal swabs and 7% of drinking water samples collected in eight live poultry markets. 11 Most (56%) of LBMs in Indonesia were found to have \u20216 sites contaminated with avian influenza virus (H5N1) by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rt RT-PCR) with slaughter and sale areas being the most heavily contaminated. 9 Although avian influenza viruses (AIVs) in the poultry population have not been described in Kenya, qualitative risk assessment studies carried out in 2007-2008 following the 2005 threat of introduction of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 in the country suggested a significant risk of transmission of AIVs if the virus were introduced into the poultry population. 12 The risk assessment identified complex marketing chains of poultry involving multiple middle men and markets coupled with unsatisfactory levels of biosecurity along the poultry chain as important factors that could contribute to the spread and transmission of influenza viruses through the poultry population and potentially to the human population. 12 In March 2009, the Kenya Medical Research Institute \u2044 US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention -Kenya (KE-MRI \u2044 CDC-K) in collaboration with the Kenya Department of Veterinary services (DVS) initiated surveillance to assess the presence of avian influenza viruses in birds traded in LBMs in Kenya. Additionally, we investigated market practices that could contribute to mixing and transmission of virus within the market.",

Half (51%) of the ducks traded originated from the Western province districts of Bungoma, Busia, Kakamega, and Malaba, while 16% originated from the neighboring country of Uganda. Forty-three percent of the geese originated from the Rift Valley province (Nakuru district) and 22% from Central province (Nyandarua district). A majority (68%) of the turkeys originated from the Western province [Bungoma (25%), Kakamega (17%), Malaba (9AE4%), Busia (14%), and Teso (2AE6%) districts].",

            "text": "We detected influenza A viruses in poultry traded in all five LBMs in Kenya. The influenza A viral RNA was detected in geese, turkeys, and chicken. To our knowledge, this is the first time influenza A RNA has been detected in poultry traded in LBMs in Kenya. In our study, the overall influenza A RNA detection rate among the birds sampled was 1AE6%. Surveillance studies on influenza viruses have recorded variable prevalence of AIVs in poultry traded in LBMs in different countries around the world. In a study conducted in Korea in 2003, 6% of chicken specimens were positive for AIVs, 14 whereas 31% and 6AE1% of duck and geese specimens, respectively, were positive for AIVs in Vietnamese markets in 2001. 7 In the Vietnam study, AIVs were not detected from chicken specimens. 7 We did not detect influenza A in any of the duck specimens. This finding was unexpected, because ducks are associated with maintenance of influenza virus in domestic birds. In fact, many studies conducted in LBMs and farms reported a higher prevalence of influenza in ducks compared with other poultry species. 7,15-17 It is not clear why influenza A virus was not detected in ducks in the markets in Kenya, particularly in light of the fact that the ducks stayed for longer periods of time in the market and were housed in the market together with geese and turkeys. However, all of the ducks sampled were adults of market age, and it is possible that they had already been exposed to influenza viruses early in life and therefore may have developed some immunity to the circulating viruses. Screening for anti-influenza A antibodies in these species would have helped to clarify this, but this was beyond the scope of our surveillance project. In our surveillance, in all avian species, influenza A virus was more commonly detected in oropharyngeal specimens than in cloacal specimens by rt RT-PCR. In a study of AI in backyard poultry in Mali in 2007, 2AE2% of tracheal swabs and 1AE3% of cloacal swabs tested positive for influenza A by rt RT-PCR. 16 Experimental studies in ducks showed that viruses replicated to higher levels in the trachea than in the cloaca of both inoculated and contact birds, suggesting that the digestive tract is not the main site of H5N1 influenza virus replication in ducks. 18, 19 Likewise, experimentally inoculated geese and chicken shed higher virus titers in oropharyngeal swabs than in cloacal swabs. 20, 21 Naturally occurring inhibitors present in cloacal and environmental swabs have been shown to limit the sensitivity of rt RT-PCR in detection of influenza A. 22 To minimize this effect in our study, we used the MagMAX extraction kit, which has been shown to be more effective in removing inhibitors, though the effect of inhibitors cannot be completely ruled out. 22 In the five markets, we observed several practices that could promote influenza transmission among birds. These included keeping markets open for 7 days a week, limited cleaning and disinfection of the market, mixing of new and old birds, trading multiple poultry species in the same market, and mixing with wild birds. These factors were found to be associated with transmission of low pathogenic avian influenza viruses in markets in North America. 23 Environmental sampling, where specimens are collected from contaminated areas of the market, has been suggested as an effective surveillance method for influenza virus circulation. As part of our surveillance, we collected specimens from fecal droppings on the ground in the markets. However, we did not detect influenza A viruses in any of the specimens. One study in Hong Kong detected AIVs in up to 1% of fecal swab specimens. 11 The reason for lack of detection in the environmental specimens is not clear, but we suspect that the high environmental temperatures in Kenya may limit the survival of any virus shed in feces by the birds. Reduced viability of several AIV subtypes has been shown to be associated with increases in temperature. [24] [25] [26] The presence of rt RT-PCR inhibitors could also have limited influenza A viral RNA detection in these samples. 22 Our surveillance was subject to certain limitations. We did not carry out subtyping of the influenza A specimens or virus isolation; hence, we are not able to report influenza subtypes from the birds sampled. We used rt RT-PCR for screening of the specimens for influenza A virus to determine positivity. Although this method has high sensitivity and specificity for detection of type A influenza matrix gene, we may have missed some infections; in one study, virus isolation in embryonated chicken eggs was found to detect an additional 2AE3% of specimens that were negative by rt RT-PCR. 27 The authors attributed the reduced sensitivity of rt RT-PCR in part to the presence of rt RT-PCR inhibitory substances in the samples and the less volume used in rt RT-PCR assays compared with virus isolation. 27 Additionally, virological studies only establish the prevalence of active infections. Serology testing would have provided more information about the extent of previous exposure at the farms and markets. However, in our case, we sampled poultry in the market destined for sale, and bleeding of the birds would have been undesirable for the traders.",

Continued monitoring of influenza viruses in poultry in LBMs would help in detecting new introductions of AIVs in the poultry population that would be of public health and socioeconomic significance to the poultry industry in the country. Early detection of new potentially dangerous influenza viruses could lead to early application of control measures that could minimize the public health impact of outbreaks of HPAI viruses and decrease the impact on the livelihoods along the poultry value chain. position of the US Centers for Diseases Control and Prevention.",
