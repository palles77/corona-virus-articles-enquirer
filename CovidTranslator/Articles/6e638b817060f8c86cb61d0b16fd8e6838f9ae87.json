During rainy seasons, proliferating insect vectors, especially the biting midge Culicoides paraensis, facilitate transmission of the virus from animal reservoirs to human hosts, with rapid spread in populations of villages and towns and significant public health impact. Human infection is clinically characterized by fever, myalgia, headache, arthralgia, skin rash and malaise, which may be long lasting (Pinheiro et al., 1981) . While ORO fever has been registered almost exclusively in the Amazon, global warming, deforestation and redistribution of vectors and reservoirs increase the risk of ORO spreading to others areas of the Americas.",

PMA (Sigma) also inhibits caveolae, by activating phosphokinase C (PKC). The caveolae inhibitory effect of nystatin and PMA in HeLa cells was confirmed using cholera toxin B subunit (CTB) as positive control ( Figure S3 ). Inhibition of ORO by nystatin and PMA was tested following the same protocol used with chlorpromazine, except that PMA incubation was carried out for 4 h. PMA did not inhibit ORO production even when used at concentrations as high as 3 g/mL (Fig. 3E) , suggesting that ORO entry is independent of caveolae. Nystatin inhibited ORO in a dose-dependent fashion and at 40 g/ml significantly reduced virus production by more than 90%. Neither nystatin or PMA had significant cytotoxicity ( Figure S1 ). Timing of addition assays showed that nystatin inhibited ORO production when added 1 h prior to (\u22121) and at the time of ORO infection (0). However, ORO titers in supernatants did not return to control levels even when drug was added as late as 4 h postinfection (Fig. 3B) . Remarkably, significant accumulation of infectious intracellular virus continued to be observed while ORO titers in supernatants remained low, suggesting that, in addition to cholesterol-rich domains associated with caveolae, nystatin may inhibit other cholesteroldependent processes, like constitutive exocytosis (Salaun et al., 2004 ) that may be involved in later steps of the ORO replication cycle.",

Both chloroquine and bafilomycin inhibited endosomal acidification in HeLa cells as confirmed by experiments with Lysotracker ( Figure S4 ). In timing of addition assays, chloroquine and bafilomycin at the above concentrations inhibited ORO production in HeLa cells when added 1 h prior to (\u22121) and at the time of infection (0), but ORO titers tended to resume control levels when the drugs were added at subsequent times ( Fig. 3C and D) . This suggests that ORO entry requires acidic compartments, probably for uncoating.",

These results are in agreement with previously published data on the entry mechanisms of other Bunyaviridae, such as Hantaan virus, which also enters cells by clathrin-dependent mechanism and requires low pH (Jin et al., 2002) . It has also been suggested that Uukuniemi and California Encephalitis viruses require low pH for entry (Hacker et al., 1995; Ronka et al., 1995) . It is reasonable to investigate inhibitors of endosomal acidification as possible adjuvants for therapy of ORO infections.",
