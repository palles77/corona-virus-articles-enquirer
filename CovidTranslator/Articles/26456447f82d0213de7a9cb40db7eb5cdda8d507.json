Secondary nucleotide peaks identified in the chromatogram for the S1 gene sequence revealed that all original vaccines (H120 and Ma5) were composed by different subpopulations of IBV. Moreover, new viral subpopulations were also found in vaccines after a single passage in chicken embryonated eggs. These findings indicate that H120 and Ma5 viral strains used in vaccines market in Brazil can still mutate very rapidly during replication, leading to amino acid substitutions in proteins involved in the stimulation of the immune response, such as the S1 glycoprotein. Therefore, our data suggest that the genetic variability of these viral strains should be taken into consideration to ensure an effective immune response against IBV.",

The most commonly used control measures against IBV infection in the world, including Brazil, are based on the combination of biosafety and immunoprophylactic programs. In Brazil, IBV vaccination is performed since the early 80's and the Massachusetts serotype is the only one approved by the Ministry of Agriculture and Supply [2] . Different laboratories produce IBV vaccines containing the H120 viral strain, which are attenuated after going through 120 passages in specific Abstract Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is currently one of the most important pathogens in the poultry industry. The H120 and Ma5 are the only viral strains approved by the Brazilian government as the constituent of vaccines. Despite the systematic vaccination in Brazil, IBV has not yet been controlled and diseases associated with this virus have been reported in vaccinated chickens. Here, we investigated the genetic variability of H120 and Ma5 strains present in the IBV vaccines from different Brazilian manufacturers. We performed DNA sequencing analyses of the S1 spike glycoprotein gene to investigate its genetic variability and the presence of viral subpopulations among vaccines, between batches, and also in each vaccine after a single passage was performed in chicken embryonated eggs.

The main reason for that is the lack of a proofreading mechanism by the RNA polymerase during viral RNA replication, resulting in a heterogeneous progeny [11] [12] [13] . When high-performance genomic sequencing shows two or more nucleotide peaks on the chromatogram for the same position, this information can be used to identify any variance in the viral RNA genome within an isolate [14] [15] [16] . Furthermore, the ambiguous heights of these peaks can be used to identify predominant and minor viral subpopulations in the same isolate [17, 18] . The spike glycoprotein S1 binds the virus to the host cell and it contains important epitopes that induce the formation of neutralizing antibodies [5] .",

Figure 3 depicts the genetic variations observed in other vaccines; the S1 sequence from the original vaccine C exhibited a main peak of cytosine (shown in blue) at the position 345, which represented the predominant viral subpopulation, and a secondary peak of thymine (shown in red), indicating the presence of a smaller subpopulation. On the contrary, after viral reisolation, this smaller subpopulation stood out, even as the predominant subpopulation in one of the sequencing reactions. On the other hand, the original vaccine A only exhibited one peak of adenine (shown in green) at the position 366, but after the reisolation, a secondary peak of guanine (shown in black) was also identified, indicating that a point mutation happened during that extra passage in embryonated chicken eggs before viral reisolation.",

            "text": "Some researchers have suggested that the genetic variability found in the IBV vaccines provides an advantage to the virus, allowing it to adapt to changes in the environment and to infect different host tissues [43] while others have suggested that it increases antigenic diversity, and thus, broadening the spectrum of protection, although this has not been demonstrated [35] . IBV vaccine strains from the same serotype that exhibit differences in the S1 gene sequence and are manufactured by different laboratories may present features that point to the original virus seed strain selected to produce the vaccine, as well as the number of passages performed in embryonated chicken eggs to attenuate the virus. However, it was not clear how IBV vaccines produced from the same virus seed by different manufacturers could exhibit important genetic variability and differences in the S1 gene sequence. Therefore, to investigate that, we performed a single additional passage of each H120 viral strain vaccine in embryonated chicken eggs, which is the same standard procedure used by manufacturers. Our results showed that after viral reisolation, two of the four commercial vaccines exhibited differences in the S1 gene sequence compared to Table 1 Polymorphisms found in the S1 gene sequences of six clones selected by High-Resolution Melting analyses (HRM) compared to the one from the original Ma5 vaccine Sequencing alignments indicated a common polymorphism in all clones in the nucleotide position T129C. Additional polymorphisms were also found on clones 20, 5, and 11. The polymorphisms are highlighted in bold",

For instance, vaccine C exhibited a minor viral subpopulation that was detected as a secondary nucleotide peak in the original vaccine but it turned out to be even as a predominant subpopulation after reisolation. On the other hand, a new viral subpopulation emerged in the vaccine A after reisolation since a secondary nucleotide peak was detected at the 366 position; however, the original vaccine A did not contain any viral subpopulations in that position. The S1 gene sequence was also amplified directly from the commercial Ma5 vaccine, in which the results matched 100% with the reference strain (AY561713, GenBank). However, chromatogram analyses of the S1 gene sequence showed a secondary peak at the nucleotide position 125, indicating the presence of two viral subpopulations in the vaccine. A major peak of thymine and a minor peak of guanine were detected, in which the predominant viral subpopulation encoded for the amino acid asparagine and the minor viral subpopulation encoded for threonine.",

Out of 38 clones obtained, 6 were selected for DNA sequencing. This clone selection was based on the HRM results, in which selected clones exhibited different melting profiles for the same amplicon compared to the original Ma5 vaccine. The minor viral subpopulation initially identified in the chromatogram analyses of the S1 gene sequence due to the presence of a secondary nucleotide peak at the position 125 was not confirmed by HRM analyses, suggesting that perhaps its DNA melting profile might be very similar to the original Ma5 vaccine. Nevertheless, the HRM analyses identified other four viral subpopulations, indicating that the Ma5 vaccine is constituted by different IBV strains.",

Nevertheless, when we tested consecutive batches of original vaccines from the same manufacturer, additional genetic variations in the S1 gene sequence between batches were not found. The genetic variabilities found in the H120 and Ma5 viral strains used in Brazilian commercial vaccines should be a reason of concern to manufacturers to ensure an effective immune response against IBV, especially because outbreaks are still common in vaccinated poultry farms in Brazil.",
