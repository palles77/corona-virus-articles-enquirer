E proteins are small (74-109 amino acids) hydrophobic viroporins (Hogue and Machamer, 2008; Ruch and Machamer, 2012a; Wilson et al., 2006 Wilson et al., , 2004 . The proteins consist of two distinct structural domains, a longer than typical hydrophobic domain and a charged cytoplasmic tail. E proteins from across the virus family exhibit amino acid sequence variability. However, E proteins from other coronaviruses can replace MHV E (Kuo et al., 2007) . This suggests that the proteins provide a common function that is interchangeable among the viruses, but this has not been tested yet for other CoVs. Surprisingly, a truncated variant of the M protein was shown to also enhance the growth of MHV lacking the E gene (Kuo and Masters, 2010) . Even though the effect on growth was positive, infectious virus titers in the presence of the M variant were 100-fold lower than for wild-type MHV and the mutant viruses appeared to be less stable.",

Deletion of the E proteins from the \u03b1 genus transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) results in replication-competent, but propagation-defective viruses, as is the case with the \u03b2 genus Middle Eastern Syndrome virus (MERS) (Curtis et al., 2002) (Almazan et al., 2013; Ortego et al., 2007 Ortego et al., , 2002 .

To help further our understanding of the mechanistic role(s) in virus assembly and egress or other roles that CoV E proteins play, we carried out a study to precisely define the cellular localization and expression dynamics of E from MHV A59, one of the long-standing prototype members of the \u03b2 genus. We show that MHV E localizes in both the ERGIC and Golgi and that the protein does not traffic to the cell surface during infection. The protein is oriented with its carboxy end on the cytoplasmic side of the membranes and the amino end on the luminal side, as was suggested some years ago. To investigate the kinetics of E trafficking, MHV was genetically engineered with a tetracysteine (TC) tag appended to the carboxy end of the protein to allow for real-time imaging during infection. When monitored in real-time, the E protein was found to be mobile in ER/ERGIC membranes. Additionally, using correlative light electron microscopy E was visualized directly in Golgi stacks. The results provide further support showing that CoV E proteins carry out their functions at intracellular membranes where virus assembly occurs. This is the first report to describe live-cell imaging of a CoV E protein, which expands opportunities to analyze the interplay between E proteins and their host cells to help further understanding of the functions they provide during morphogenesis and pathogenesis.",

The S and M proteins were analyzed in parallel as controls (data not shown). The S protein is known to colocalize with M at the site of assembly, but it is also transported to the cell surface (Heald-Sargent and Gallagher, 2012) . The M protein localizes in the Golgi (Corse and Machamer, 2002; Klumperman et al., 1994) . At 8 h p.i. the E and M proteins continued to colocalize as was observed at 6 h p.i. (Fig. 2) . By 12 h p.i. the M protein was localized in areas of the cell distant from the ERGIC/Golgi region, whereas the E protein remained localized at the perinuclear site. Additionally, E did not localize with the M or S proteins distant to the perinuclear sites when all three proteins were analyzed at 12 h p.i. (data not shown). At 16 h p.i., and more prominently at 24 h p.i., a large portion of the M protein was visualized throughout the cytoplasm, presumably as virus output increased and virions are being transported out of the cell. In contrast, at the late time points E continued to remain localized primarily in the ERGIC/ Golgi region. Only a few small punctate dots were seen outside of these regions, presumably due to the extensive fusion that is Fig. 1 . MHV E localizes in the ERGIC and Golgi. Mouse 17Cl1 cells were infected with MHV A59 at a MOI of 1 and analyzed at 6 h p.i. (A) Cells were processed for dual-label immunofluorescence detection of E and protein disulfide isomerase (PDI), ERGIC-53, or mannosidase II (Mann-II), as ER, ERGIC, and Golgi markers, respectively. The bottom panels were probed for M and E proteins using rabbit polyclonal anti-E 9410 and mouse monoclonal J1.3 and J2.7 antibodies, respectively. Alexa-Fluor tagged secondary antibodies were used to counter stain the primary antibodies. Merged images are shown in the far right column, with enlarged insets of selected cells.

Biotinylated surface proteins were isolated with streptavidin agarose beads. Both surface and intracellular fractions were then analyzed by Western blotting for the viral proteins.

Cells infected with MHV E-TC were initially viewed by confocal microscopy after addition of Lumio\u2122 Red (Fig. 7A) . Photoexcitation of the Lumio\u2122 Red reagent bound to a TC tag results in release of singlet oxygen, which in turn polymerizes added diaminobenzidine (DAB). The precipitate that forms can be visualized directly by EM following i., surface proteins were biotinylated. Surface (S) and intracellular (I) proteins were analyzed for spike (S) and envelope (E) proteins by Western blotting. For the analysis 10% and 20% of the intracellular and surface fractions, respectively were loaded. The Western blot for the E protein was exposed 15 \u00c2 longer than that for the S protein. (B) 17Cl1 mouse cells were infected with MHV at an MOI of 0.1 (top three panels) and probed with antibodies specific for S, M and E after cells were permeabilized with digitonin or TX-100 to reveal the cytoplasmic or both luminal and cytoplasmic epitope of the protein. (C) BHK-21 cells were transfected with pCAGGS vector expressing MHV E with a Strep-tag at the amino end. The amino and carboxy ends of E were detected with an anti-Strep monoclonal, StrepMAB-Classic and rabbit anti-E 9410 antibodies, respectively. Scale bar, 5 \u03bcm. osmimum tetroxide staining. In MHV E-TC virus infected cells a precipitate was visible that colocalized with the Lumio\u2122 Red labeling, as expected in a perinuclear position, consistent with the ERGIC/Golgi localization described earlier (Fig. 5A ). When examined by EM the electron-dense precipitate was localized in Golgi stacks (Fig. 7B ). In some cells Golgi fragmentation was evident and E was associated with $ 20-nm vesicles, apparently derived from the stacks (data not shown).",

Our confocal imaging, in parallel with a full panel of exocytic pathway cellular markers, clearly shows that MHV E is not in the ER, but is present in both the ERGIC and Golgi, primarily in the cis and medial cisternae of the latter, early during infection. Based on the apparent similar roles that the E proteins play in virus assembly, it stands to reason that they likely share common localization characteristics. IBV and SARS-CoV E proteins were previously reported to localize in the ER and/or Golgi (Corse and Machamer, 2000; Liao et al., 2006; Lim and Liu, 2001; Nal et al., 2005) . Recent studies have shown that SARS-CoV E colocalizes with ERGIC-53 in infected cells and also when expressed transiently Teoh et al., 2010) . Strong transient expression of SARS-CoV E in the cis-Golgi, but hardly any expression in the ERGIC and trans-Golgi was also recently reported (Cohen et al., 2011; Nieto-Torres et al., 2011; Teoh et al., 2010) . We previously showed as well that HA-tagged SARS-CoV E localized in both the ERGIC and Golgi during transient expression (Lopez et al., 2006) . Collectively, it can be concluded that coronavirus E proteins are expressed in both ERGIC and Golgi compartments, though the distribution may vary depending on the virus and cell type.",

In addition to surface immunofluorescence, cellular permeabilization by E proteins and whole-cell patch clamp measurement of ion channel activity in cells expressing SARS-CoV E were suggestive of surface expression (Liao et al., 2004 Madan Fig. 4 . Characterization of TC-tagged E. The schematic illustrates the location of TC tag at the carboxy ends of WT E. 293T cells were transfected with pCAGGS E-TC, fixed at 8 h posttransfection and processed for immunofluorescence to detect E using Lumio\u2122 Green (left images), and ER, ERGIC or Golgi (red) markers (middle images). Yellow in the merged images indicates colocalization of signals. Enlarged inserts of selected cells are shown at the far right. Scale bar, 5 \u03bcm. We did not detect MHV E on the surface of nonpermeabilized transfected or infected cells. This is consistent with the recent report which clearly demonstrated that SARS-CoV E is not present at the plasma membrane . Our confocal microscopy analysis over a time course following infection strongly illustrates that E remains in its perinuclear location even late during infection. Results from our live-cell and CLEM imaging also support the conclusion that MHV E remains at the site of assembly in ERGIC/Golgi membranes and does not transport to the plasma membrane. Our surface expression results yielded additional information confirming that MHV E assumes an orientation with the amino end located in the lumen and the cytoplasmic tail in the cytoplasm, consistent with the recently described topology of SARS-CoV E (Nieto-Torres et al., 2011). The cytoplasmic tail of MHV E was previously determined to reside in the cytoplasm in infected cells and thus, outside of the virion, but with a FLAG tag placed at the amino end it was suggested that the protein spans the lipid bilayer twice with both the amino and carboxy ends in the cytoplasm (Maeda et al., 2001; Raamsman et al., 2000) . Our results clearly show that the aminoterminal Strep tag does not alter the single pass topology with a luminal amino end and cytoplasmic carboxy end in the cellular membranes.",

            "text": "The E protein actually displayed a range of mobilities (M f \u00bc 41-87%) at 6 h p.i., the point at which virus assembly is actively ongoing. Several factors may account for the M f range. The population of E molecules that are actively involved in assembly maybe associated with other structural proteins or possibly host factors that differently restrict lateral diffusion in membranes. The E protein assembles into oligomeric ion channels that could affect the proteins mobility. Possibly only a fraction of molecules exists as part of a channel at any given time. The E protein is palmitoylated (Boscarino et al., 2008; Lopez et al., 2008) . We do not know if all potential cysteine residues are modified at the same time or if possibly the protein undergoes dynamic palmitoylation/depalmitoylation cycling during infection. The conserved cysteines are located adjacent to the transmembrane domain, which when palmitoylated may influence interaction of the protein tail with membranes and thus, its mobility. The HA protein of influenza virus is a transmembrane protein that is both palmitoylation and myristoylated. Yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) tagged HA exhibits different diffusion coefficients that vary based on the acylation state of the protein. WT HA-YFP has a diffusion coefficient of 0.14 \u03bcm/s 2 while a non-acylated mutant has a diffusion coefficient of 0.30 \u03bcm/s 2 . The acylation greatly reduces the mobility of the protein (Engel et al., 2010) . Depending on the number of sites that are palmitoylated, this may affect the mobility of E molecules. If E plays a role in membrane curvature or in scission, lateral movement of the protein in membranes at the site of assembly could facilitate the budding process. This might also contribute to the range of mobilities observed in this study.",

VLPs were assembled with chimeric N and S proteins containing a fluorescent protein (cyan -eCFP or green -eGFP) tag fused at their carboxy termini, but similarly tagged M protein could not be incorporated. Data was not shown, but the authors indicated that the E protein did not tolerate addition of the large fluorescent protein tags (Siu et al., 2008) . Our study highlights the potential utility and tolerance of the smaller TC tag since we were able to generate a recombinant virus with the tag fused to the carboxy end of E. The recombinant virus produced smaller plaques and reached titers of only 1 \u00c2 10 6 PFU/ ml, compared with wild-type MHV A59 that generally yields titers in the range of 1 \u00c2 10 7 -1 \u00c2 10 8 PFU/ml. Nonetheless, virus stability over multiple passages provides the opportunity to use the tagged virus for live cell studies. When the E gene is deleted or knocked out from MHV a small plaque phenotype and titers at least three orders of magnitude lower than the wild-type virus are produced (Kuo et al., 2007; Kuo and Masters, 2003) . Thus, the virus with the TC-tagged E grows better than the E-null virus.",

More extensive and higher resolution views of ultrastructural changes that occur during replication and assembly were recently described . Three membranous structures, including large virion-containing vacuoles (LVCVs), tubular bodies (TBs) and cubic membrane structures (CMSs), were associated with virus assembly/release. The E protein was present with two of these structures, the LVCVs that are derived from ERGIC/Golgi membranes and TBs thought to form late in infection as a result of excess protein self-aggregation (Raamsman et al., 2000; Ulasli et al., 2010) . The latter are thought to be equivalent to previously described smooth tubular membranous structures that are induced by E protein expression late during coronavirus infection (Raamsman et al., 2000) . During the time frame in which our CLEM studies were conducted, we did not detect these tubular structures. It is possible that the lower yield of the E-TC virus might account for this. We did find E associated with Golgi cisternae and in some cells association with Golgi fragmentation was noted. Golgi fragmentation has been observed by confocal microscopy in cells infected with MHV or TGEV and also when IBV E was overexpressed (Lavi et al., 1996; Ortego et al., 2007; Ruch and Machamer, 2011; Ulasli et al., 2010) . Golgi disruption was not observed in cells infected with a recombinant TGEV lacking the E gene, but fragmentation occurred when E was provided in trans, thus providing strong support for contribution of the protein to this process (Ortego et al., 2007) . Our CLEM results illustrate the potential to follow E during infection and to monitor changes at the ultrastructural level that are associated with the protein, a direction that will be pursued further in future studies.",

            "text": "The accumulation of E in ERGIC/Golgi membranes and the fact that only a few molecules are incorporated into virions suggest that E likely provides a function(s) that is peripheral to or limited at most in the area where virion particles bud. Lack of E trafficking to the cell surface during infection lends additional support for the protein's participation in virus assembly and morphogenesis and possible other roles during infection from its position in the internal membranes. At these membranes E may through its ion channel transport of cations directly influence the immediate microenvironment in the ERGIC lumen by alteration of Na\u00fe or K\u00fe or other ion concentrations that could in turn result in luminal pH changes that are balanced by activation of vacuolar H \u00fe ATPase. The ERGIC does contain an active H \u00fe ATPase that has been suggested to be possibly involved in directional transport and concentration of cargo molecules (Ying et al., 2000) . A second, previously suggested, possibility is that E plays a role in helping mediate membrane curvature or scission (Vennema et al., 1996) . Influenza M2, a well characterized multifunctional small integral membrane protein with protonselective ion channel activity, plays a significant role in entry during infection, but it is also involved in virus assembly (Chen et al., 2008; Iwatsuki-Horimoto et al., 2006; McCown and Pekosz, 2006; Pinto and Lamb, 2006) . Recently M2 was shown to mediate membrane curvature and scission during budding (Rossman et al., 2010) . Coronavirus E proteins could play a similar role. Thirdly, coronavirus E proteins may through interactions with host proteins facilitate virus budding or vesicular transport. A large number of host proteins copurify with SARS virions and recently host and viral proteins that interact with E were identified Neuman et al., 2008; Teoh et al., 2010) . Finally, E ion channel activity at internal membranes may result in signaling that activates ion channel activity at the cell surface. While the latter is only speculative at this point, measurement of ion channel activity at the surface of cells expressing SARS-CoV E might reflect a response to such signaling and while such activity might be less likely to play a role in virus assembly and transport of LVCVs, such activity could impact a role of the protein as a virulence factor during infection (DeDiego et al., 2007 (DeDiego et al., , 2008 Pervushin et al., 2009; Teoh et al., 2010) . SARS-CoV lacking the E gene is attenuated in animal models, thus the protein, at least for this virus, is a virulence factor (DeDiego et al., 2007 (DeDiego et al., , 2008 Netland et al., 2010) . Recent results indicate that ion channel activity is an important contributor to virulence Nieto-Torres et al., 2011) . Thus, there are a large number of potential functions for the E protein which makes it an attractive target for antiviral therapeutic development.",

The ability to monitor E directly in live cells and to extend this to ultrastructural studies using CLEM should expand the opportunities to analyze interactions between the protein and the cell during infection to help increase our understanding of its role(s) and mechanistically how it functions.",
