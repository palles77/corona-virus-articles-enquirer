Therefore, we conducted a comprehensive study of reporting completeness with an analysis of 53 diseases reported by 8 health care systems across North Carolina, USA, during 1995USA, during -1997USA, during and 2000USA, during -2006. All patients who were assigned an International Classifi cation of Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical Modifi cation, diagnosis code for a state-required reportable communicable disease were matched to surveillance records. We used logistic regression techniques to estimate reporting completeness by disease, year, and health care system. The completeness of reporting varied among the health care systems from 2% to 30% and improved over time. Disease-specifi c reporting completeness proportions ranged from 0% to 82%, but were generally low even for diseases with great public health importance and opportunity for interventions.",

Currently, all states conduct notifi able disease surveillance following guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Council for State and Territorial Epidemiologists. The current list of nationally notifi able communicable diseases has expanded to >60 diseases and includes vaccine-preventable diseases (e.g., pertussis, measles), emerging infectious diseases (e.g., severe acute respiratory syndrome, West Nile virus encephalitis), foodborne diseases (e.g., Shiga toxinproducing Escherichia coli and Salmonella spp. infections), sexually transmitted diseases (e.g., syphilis, HIV), and aerosol and droplet transmitted diseases (e.g., tuberculosis, meningococcal meningitis). Active surveillance programs conducted by CDC in conjunction with certain states include Active Bacterial Core surveillance, FoodNet, and infl uenza-related hospitalization surveillance. Surveillance of epidemiologically important diseases provides critical information to clinicians and public health offi cials for use in measuring disease incidence in communities, recognizing disease outbreaks, assessing prevention and control measure effectiveness, allocating public health resources, and further clarifying the epidemiology of new and emerging pathogens (1) .",

The state relies on physicians and laboratories to comply with the directive to report diseases and laboratory results indicative of diseases considered a threat to public health. During the periods of this study (1995) (1996) (1997) (2000) (2001) (2002) (2003) (2004) (2005) (2006) , mandatory reporting was required for >60 diseases. Conditions and disease reports consisted of paper communicable-disease report forms that contained demographic, clinical, and risk factor data for the case-patient. These reports were required to be submitted to the health department within a specifi ed period (i.e., immediately, within 24 hours, or within 7 days), depending on the disease. An important change to the communicable disease surveillance system of the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services (NC DHHS) occurred when the state administrative code was amended in September 1998 to require that persons in charge of diagnostic laboratories report positive laboratory results for most diseases already reportable by physicians (2) . This dual reporting mechanism was intended to improve completeness, timeliness, and accuracy of surveillance. More recently, in 2002, surveillance efforts have also expanded with the introduction of 7 regional public health teams and 11 hospital-based public health epidemiologists.",

To date, only 2 evaluations have examined reporting proportions for >5 diseases (5, 6) . Previous studies examining the completeness of disease reporting have differed considerably in terms of the following factors: size of geographic region (e.g., from clinics at a single university to multiple states), range of study period (e.g., several months to several years), heterogeneity of reporting systems (e.g., health care provider-based passive reporting vs. health care provider-and laboratory-based passive reporting), and various patient ascertainment methods (e.g., laboratory records, billing records, active surveillance, death certifi cates). This variability renders study results diffi cult to compare or aggregate. Therefore, we undertook a comprehensive study of reporting completeness with an analysis of 53 reportable diseases and conditions in selected health care systems across North Carolina over a 10-year period to estimate disease-specifi c reporting proportions, describe changes to reporting over time, and examine the variability of reporting completeness between health care facilities.",

            "text": "Variations in disease reporting can occur for several reasons. First, clinicians may have the perception that some diseases are a greater public health threat based on communicability or severity of the illness and the likelihood of death (e.g., tuberculosis vs. salmonellosis). Second, some diseases have relatively straightforward and primarily laboratory-based case defi nitions (e.g., stool culture positive for Salmonella spp. infections with a clinically compatible illness), whereas others are more complex, either requiring multiple laboratory results (e.g., 4-fold increase between acute-phase and convalescent-phase serologic results for Rocky Mountain spotted fever) or a combination of multiple clinical signs and symptoms without any specifi c laboratory result (e.g., toxic shock syndrome which, requires the presence of at least 4 symptoms). One clear pattern that emerged in our fi ndings was that diseases with fewer clini- cal criteria and laboratory-based case defi nitions tended to have higher reporting rates (e.g., salmonellosis 44.8% vs. toxic shock syndrome 3.2%). Laboratory-based case defi nitions ensure that a dual reporting system exists, and the process is more straightforward because less time is required for reviewing medical records for clinical signs and symptoms. This fi nding underscores the need for simplicity of case defi nitions, an essential attribute in surveillance system development and maintenance. Future research on predictors for reporting completeness would be useful for designing interventions to improve reporting and for guiding the future direction of surveillance. Notably, we identifi ed some patients by ICD-9-CM diagnostic codes for some diseases known to be eliminated in the United States (e.g., smallpox and polio) and others that were highly unlikely to have occurred (e.g., anthrax and human rabies). Numerous previous studies that have evaluated reporting completeness have also used ICD-9-CM codes (5,6,11) because they are standard codes that can be queried relatively easily and should capture clinical cases of disease regardless of laboratory confi rmation. The accuracy of the ICD-9-CM codes was a potential limitation in our study. Therefore, we also conducted a separate validation study of the positive predictive values of ICD-9-CM codes for communicable disease surveillance by using as the standard a complete medical record review and concordance with published CDC case classifi cation criteria (12) . These results showed that for most diseases with higher incidence and relatively straightforward diagnoses, the positive predictive values (PPVs) were high (>80%) with the exception of tuberculosis, which had a PPV of 29% (13) . For diseases with low PPVs, the estimates we present here are likely to be underestimates of the true reporting completeness because the completeness proportion denominator, or the number of patients identifi ed by ICD-9-CM codes for reportable diseases, is likely to be an overestimate (i.e., contain false-positive cases). However, an additional limitation of this study was that we were unable to assess the sensitivity of ICD-9-CM codes (i.e., false-negative cases) for communicable disease reporting. Quantifi cation of the sensitivity and PPVs of ICD-9-CM codes for communicable disease surveillance is essential in the interpretation of all ICD-9-CM data because these codes are used frequently for research studies and have been proposed as adjuncts to electronic, automated surveillance systems.",

The use of semi-Bayesian methods enables us to incorporate additional prior covariate data to produce results that are likely better and more plausible than maximumlikelihood estimation results.

Specifi cally, we did note a dramatic shift in the reporting completeness proportions after semi-Bayesian adjustments for several diseases, including staphylococcal foodborne disease and V. vulnifi cus and other Vibrio spp. infections. This shift refl ects the imprecision in each disease's measured estimates of reporting completeness and the adjustment or shrinkage of their proportions to the mean of the prior covariate probability groups (i.e., food/water-borne transmission, and reporting time of 24 hours). These estimates are shrunk toward the mean of the food/water-borne transmission group of diseases which includes many of those with the highest reporting proportion (e.g., campylobacteriosis, salmonellosis).

            "text": "The reporting variation seen among health care systems ( Figure 2 ) may be explained in part by health care systems' internal policies that assign the responsibility for communicable disease reporting to the infection prevention department. For example, the health care system with the highest reporting proportion (health care system A) has hospital-based public health epidemiologists or infection preventionists responsible for disease reporting, and the health care system with the lowest reporting proportion (health care system G) does not assign any additional reporting responsibility beyond the state-mandated reporting by physicians and laboratories. However, adjusting for these Emerging Infectious Diseases \u2022 www.cdc.gov/eid \u2022 Vol. 17 health care system policies did not modify the reporting completeness proportions. Currently, the North Carolina general statute states that medical facilities may report (16) as opposed to physicians and persons in charge of laboratories who shall report (17, 18) . Because infection preventionists typically receive laboratory data daily, are well-trained on case defi nition application, and share disease prevention goals with the health department, they can serve as partners to the local health department in ensuring that diseases are reported and investigated appropriately. However, redundancy in disease reporting responsibilities could also cause reporting fatigue and the mistaken assumption that someone else has reported the case-patient (19, 20) . In addition, external generalizations of these fi ndings to other health care systems should be approached with caution because the participating sites were part of an existing network that includes the largest health care systems in North Carolina and therefore may have been more likely to treat patients who had more severe illnesses or who did not receive a diagnosis at a local clinic or smaller hospital.",

Several notable changes occurred in North Carolina's surveillance system during this period. First, in 1998, the inclusion of laboratory-mandated reporting served as a secondary reporting mechanism in addition to the already mandated physician-based reporting. Regional public health teams were established in 2002 to assist health departments with outbreak investigations. In 2003, a network of public health epidemiologists (funded through the state's Public Health Emergency Preparedness cooperative agreement with CDC) were placed in hospitals to facilitate disease reporting and case investigation, and, also in 2003, a statewide emergency department-based syndromic surveillance system (North Carolina Disease Event Tracking and Epidemiologic Collection Tool) was created for early case identifi cation. Despite the likely positive effects of these regulatory and programmatic changes on disease reporting, the proportion of diseases reported remains low, as is consistent with data from other passive reporting surveillance systems (21) .",

Although North Carolina, like many states, has developed and implemented an electronic disease surveillance system, the reporting of communicable diseases by local health departments still remains largely passive in that reporting is accomplished by accessing a secure Internet site and entering patient information. Physicians who practice outside local health departments currently use paper-based reporting.",

Upon recognition of these potential casepatients, automating surveillance data collection directly from electronic health records to populate data fi elds for basic patient demographics and laboratory results could also reduce administrative time for physicians and health department offi cials and expedite communicable disease investigations.",

In fact, the recent draft recommendations for defi ning \"meaningful use\" from the Health Information Technology Policy Council to the National Coordinator propose that hospitals be capable of providing electronic submission of reportable laboratory results to public health agencies by 2011 (24) . Such an undertaking will require implementation of national laboratory reporting standards for hospitals and can only be accomplished with resource allocation and partnerships between health departments and health care systems. Furthermore, additional surveillance research should investigate the sensitivity, specifi c- ity, and feasibility of using different key laboratory results and proxy clinical case defi nitions (e.g., ICD-9-CM codes) for automating the identifi cation of potential case-patients. The \"meaningful use\" of the electronic health record for automated case-fi nding and data collection will transition our current public health surveillance system from passive to active and thereby overcome the major barriers to complete, accurate and timely communicable disease reporting and surveillance.",
