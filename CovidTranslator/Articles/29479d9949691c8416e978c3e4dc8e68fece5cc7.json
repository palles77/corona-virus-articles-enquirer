Significant progress has been made from studying this area, including the identification of PRRs, such as Toll-like receptors and RIG-I-like receptors, and the description of the molecular basis of their signalling pathways, which lead to the production of interferons and other cytokines. In parallel, common mechanisms used by viruses to evade PRR-mediated responses or to actively subvert these pathways for their own benefit are emerging. Accumulating evidence on how viral infection and PRR signalling pathways intersect is providing further insights into the function of the pathways involved, their constituent proteins and ways in which they could be manipulated therapeutically.

Paradoxically, viruses are obligate parasites that depend on host cells for survival and, throughout evolution, they have developed strategies to evade and subvert the immune response, and to use host proteins for their own life cycle. Viral infection of host cells leads to the initiation of antiviral innate immune responses, which results in the induction of expression of the type I interferons (IFNs) IFN\u03b1 and IFN\u03b2, and of pro-inflammatory cytokines. The importance of type I IFNs in directing the antiviral response has been characterized in detail 1 and validated in vivo. For example, mice that are deficient in the type I IFN receptor have increased susceptibility to many viruses, and humans with genetic defects in IFN signalling components die of viral infections 1 . Some of the important IFN antiviral effector pathways, which comprise host mechanisms to directly target the viral life cycle and to amplify host detection of viruses and IFN production, are shown in FIG. 1 . In addition to influencing innate immune responses, type I IFNs direct the adaptive immune response by priming T helper cells and cytotoxic T cells (CTLs), thereby resulting in the induction of antigen-specific responses.",

            "text": "Eight years ago, almost nothing was known about the cellular mechanisms that are used to detect viruses and to subsequently produce IFNs and pro-inflammatory cytokines. It is now known that viruses, similar to bacteria and fungi, are initially recognized by host pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs), as was predicted by Janeway almost 20 years ago 2 . In a short time, a large body of research has accumulated and now provides a detailed understanding of the molecular basis of PRR-mediated recognition of viral nucleic acids, and of the subsequent activation of signalling pathways that lead to the transcription of genes that encode pro-inflammatory cytokines and IFNs. Two families of PRRs that recognize viral nucleic acid have been characterized in detail. The first is a subfamily of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) that is made up of TLR3, TLR7, TLR8 and TLR9, which are mainly expressed in the endosomes of some cell types. The second family of receptors comprises the retinoic-acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I)-like receptors (RLRs), encompassing RIG-I, melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA5; also known as IFIH1) and laboratory of genetics and physiology 2 (LGP2), which are ubiquitously expressed in the cytoplasm (FIG. 1 ). An additional family of intracellular PRRs that is probably important in the sensing of viral DNA in the cytoplasm is also emerging [3] [4] [5] . Viral nucleic acid (both RNA and DNA) is the most important pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) that is recognized by the host (BOX 1) , and there is now an excellent understanding of how viral nucleic acids bind to and activate PRRs at the molecular level (reviewed in ReFs 6, 7) . In addition, the fundamental aspects of the PRR signalling pathways, and the components that are involved, have also been well characterized 8,9 . There has long been a substantial amount of literature on how the IFN effector phase of the antiviral response is antagonized by viruses, but with the more recent discoveries identifying how virus triggering of PRRs leads to IFN induction, the mechanisms by which viruses evade early events in PRR signalling pathways have become apparent. It is now clear that, following infection, viruses can induce complex intracellular events that affect many components of host signalling pathways. The effects of viruses on host defence not only inhibit viral detection, but also allow the virus to manipulate host signalling pathways for their own benefit. So, the activation of a certain PRR by a virus can be either part of the host's protective immune response or a mechanism that is used by the virus to aid its replication and spread. owing to the fine-tuning of immune signalling by both virus and host, different viruses may activate the same PRR with either positive or negative outcomes on disease progression and immune response.",

            "text": "Elucidating the strategies that are used by viruses to inhibit and to manipulate host responses is important for two reasons. First, this knowledge will contribute to our understanding of viral pathogenesis. As viruses (especially RNA viruses) mutate very rapidly, the identification of mutations that increase or decrease the activity of a viral protein that targets the immune response may help to define the virulence factors of different strains or species of viruses that infect humans. For example, Ebola virus, which is usually highly virulent in humans and triggers lethal haemorrhagic fever, induces a minimal adaptive immune response (which requires innate immune detection of the virus by PRRs) in patients who succumb to infection, whereas those who survive infection mount an effective adaptive immune response 10 . Figure 1 | Activation of the interferon response triggered by the detection of viral pathogen-associated molecular patterns. All of the pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs) initiate signalling pathways that converge at the activation of the transcription factors interferon (IFN)-regulatory factor 3 (IRF3), IRF7 and/or nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF\u03baB); this leads to the expression of IFN\u03b2. IFN\u03b2 then initiates an antiviral effector programme in the infected cell and neighbouring cells, which involves the expression of numerous IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). Some of the ISGs shown here, such as RIG-I (retinoic-acid-inducible gene I), MDA5 (melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5), DAI (DNA-dependent activator of IRFs), some microRNAs and the TRIM (tripartite motif-containing) family of proteins, are involved in the amplification and regulation of the IFN response. Other ISGs shown here, such as 2\u20325\u2032-oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS) and ribonuclease L (RNaseL), IFN-inducible dsRNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR), myxovirus resistance (Mx) protein, adenosine deaminase RNA-specific (ADAR) and apolipoprotein B mRNA-editing enzyme, catalytic polypeptide 3 (APOBEC3), are involved in antiviral mechanisms that interfere with the life cycle of individual viruses .

The identification of TLR4 as the signalling receptor for bacterial lipopolysaccharide was a major breakthrough in the field of innate immune research. The first evidence that TLRs might also respond to viruses came with the finding that the fusion protein of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) stimulated the secretion of interleukin-6 (IL-6) from mouse macrophages, and this depended on TLR4 signalling 13 . In addition, it was discovered that proteins from vaccinia virus (VACV) antagonized TLR signalling in cultured cells 14 , further supporting a role for TLRs in sensing viruses 15 . In 2001, TLR3 was identified as a PRR for viral double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) based on the observation that mice deficient in IFN-inducible dsRNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR; also known as EIF2AK2 and previously the only known dsRNA receptor) still responded to the synthetic dsRNA mimic polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (polyI:C) 16 . As stimulation of cells with polyI:C was known to mimic many aspects of viral infection, TLR3 was expected to have a broad and crucial role in antiviral immunity. However, it soon became clear that this was not the case, as viral infection of hosts that were deficient in TLR3 did not alter viral pathogenesis or impair the host immune response to several viruses 17 . It now seems that the absence of TLR3 is actually protective in the case of some viral infections (see later). Nonetheless, important and specific roles for TLR3 in the antiviral response have been shown, including host defence against certain viruses (reviewed in .",

The cytoplasmic region of TLRs contains the conserved Toll/IL-1 receptor (IL-1R) (TIR) domain, which is common to the IL-1R family and is essential for signalling that is mediated by TLRs and IL-1Rs 25 . Receptor dimerization triggers homotypic interactions between the receptor TIR domain and TIR-domain-containing adaptor proteins. There are five TIR-domain-containing adaptor proteins that control signalling from activated TLRs, namely myeloid differentiation primary-response gene 88 (MyD88), MyD88-adaptor-like (MAL; also known as TIRAP), TIR-domain-containing adaptor protein inducing IFN\u03b2 (TRIF), TRIF-related adaptor molecule (TRAM) and sterile-\u03b1-and armadillo-motif-containing protein (SARM) 25 . MyD88 is required for signalling from all mouse TLRs except TLR3, as well as signalling from the IL-1R 25 , although different TLRs signal through different repertoires of TIR-domain-containing adaptors. For example, TLR2 signalling requires MyD88 and MAL, TLR3 signalling needs TRIF, and TLR7 and TLR9 signalling requires only MyD88 (ReF. 25 ). The TLR-induced signalling pathways that lead to IRF3, IRF7 and NF\u03bab activation are outlined in FIG. 2 . Some of the factors that are involved in TLR signalling are shared with other signalling pathways. More specifically, it has recently been shown that TRADD (tumour-necrosis factor receptor (TNFR)-associated via death domain) is required for the signalling pathways that are downstream of the TNFR, for TRIF-dependent TLR signalling and for both RIG-I and MDA5 signalling pathways [26] [27] [28] .

VACV, a large dsDNA virus of the Poxviridae family, is now known to encode many inhibitors of innate immune signalling pathways, many of which also have a nonredundant, independent role in virulence 29, 30 . A46R contains a TIR domain, which allows it to interact with TIR-domain-containing complexes and to bind directly to the TIR-domain-containing adaptors MyD88, MAL, TRIF and TRAM; it can therefore inhibit the activation of both NF\u03bab and IRFs that is normally triggered by multiple TLR pathways 31 . The affinity of the interaction between A46R and TIR-domain-containing adaptors in an infected cell may be sufficient to prevent the recruitment of adaptors to TLRs and thereby inhibit host defence, although this theory has not yet been supported experimentally. when the gene that encodes A46R was deleted from VACV, the virus was attenuated 31 . In keeping with this observation several TLRs have been shown to participate in the host cytokine and IFN response to poxvirus infection 30 . It is worth noting that A46R does not interact with SARM, which is a negative regulator of TLR signalling 32 and is therefore favourable in the context of VACV infection.",

NS3-4A has serine protease activity, is essential for the survival of the virus and has many functions in evading or subverting PRR signalling pathways (TABLe 1) . one function is to cleave an HCV precursor polypeptide to generate mature structural proteins during viral replication. Further work showed that TRIF was also specifically cleaved by NS3-4A into two polypeptides that could no longer activate TLR-dependent transcription from the IFNB promoter 35 . NS3-4A expression potently decreased the polyI:C-induced activity of the IFNB promoter, the polyI:C-mediated activation of NF\u03bab and IRF3, and the induction of IRF3-dependent genes 35 . Therefore, by targeting TRIF, HCV inhibits TLR3-mediated antiviral signalling. Although the importance of TLR3 in the host immune response to HCV infection is currently unclear, the targeting of TRIF by HCV indicated that TLR3 has an important role in the antiviral response to HCV. Furthermore, it has recently been shown that when four different HCV proteins (one of which was NS3-4A) were expressed individually in a mouse macrophage cell line, they inhibited TLR-induced cytokine production. The target of the HCV protein NS5A was found to be MyD88 (ReF. 36 ).",

Although TRAF6 was known to have a central role in TLR signalling that leads to NF\u03bab activation, the role of the pseudokinase IRAK2 was unknown. Surprisingly, it was shown that a mutant version of A52R, which could interact with IRAK2 but not TRAF6, induced maximal inhibition of NF\u03bab 38 . This key observation led to a study which showed that IRAK2 is more important for NF\u03bab activation than was previously appreciated, and certainly more important than IRAK1 for some TLR signalling pathways 38 . because A52R, unlike A46R, had no effect on TLR-induced IRF activation, this suggested that IRAK2 was not involved in the TLR-IRF axis. Indeed, it is now appreciated that IRAK1 has a crucial role in this signalling pathway (FIG. 2) , whereas IRAK2 is involved in NF\u03bab activation, as confirmed by the study of IRAK2-deficient mice 39 . So, the study of A52R is a clear example of what we can learn about PRR signalling pathways by investigating viral evasion strategies (BOX 2) . Similar to NS3-4A, A52R also has many functions in evading or subverting PRR signalling (TABLe 1) , and its ability to interact with TRAF6 might represent subversion (rather than evasion) of the TLR pathways by VACV (see later).",

            "text": "In addition to VACV and HCV, other viruses that target TLR signalling pathways include human T-cell leukaemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) and west Nile virus (wNV). HTLV-I downregulates the host cell-surface expression of TLR4 through the viral protein p30, which binds to and disables the transcription factor Pu.1 (which is normally required for TLR4 expression) 40 . by contrast, the wNV protein non-structural protein 1 (NS1) inhibits TLR3-mediated induction of IFN\u03b2 expression by preventing the translocation of NF\u03bab and IRF3 to the nucleus 41 . However, it is currently unclear whether inhibition that is mediated by NS1 is specific to the TLR3 signalling pathway or whether it also affects the induction of IFN\u03b2 expression downstream of other PRRs. Important principles of viral evasion are illustrated by VACV and HCV targeting of TLR signalling pathways. Viral antagonists of innate immunity often have a similar sequence to the host proteins they target (as in the case of A46R), which can provide clues about their function, or they can be completely unrelated in sequence to host proteins (as in the case of NS3-4A). Furthermore, viral proteins with known functions (such as NS5A 42 ) may have additional roles, which illustrates the high efficiency with which viruses use their limited protein-coding resources (TABLe 1) . As viruses target host proteins for the specific purpose of gaining an advantage over the host, newly discovered or ill-defined host proteins that interact with viral proteins can be implicated in the innate immune response. Recent examples show how understanding these virus-host interactions has clarified aspects of the pattern-recognition receptor (PRR) response. Vaccinia virus (VACV) protein A52R was found to be an inhibitor of Toll-like receptor (TLR)-mediated activation of nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF\u03baB), through an interaction with interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 2 (IRAK2) 38 . Prior to this it was unclear whether IRAK2 had a non-redundant role in PRR signalling, but further study of A52R showed that IRAK2 has a crucial role in human TLR signalling pathways 38 , and the study of IRAK2-deficient mice recently confirmed that it also has a role in mouse TLR signalling 39 . Studies using another VACV PRR signalling inhibitor, K7R, showed that human DEAD-box protein 3 (DDX3) is involved in PRR signalling that leads to the expression of interferon-\u03b2 (IFN\u03b2). More specifically, DDX3 was found to be the host target of K7R, which explained the ability of K7R to inhibit PRR-induced activation of IFN-regulatory factors (IRFs) 81 . It is now clear that DDX3 is a component of the IRF-activating complex that contains TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) and inhibitor of NF\u03baB kinase-\u03b5 (IKK\u03b5), which is essential for signalling by many PRRs. Additional aspects about PRR signalling were revealed by studies of the influenza A virus nonstructural protein 1 (NS1), this time clarifying the nature of the ligand for the PRR retinoic-acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I), which at that time was thought to be double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). NS1 was known to suppress the induction of type I IFN expression, and this was thought to be mediated through dsRNA binding. However, studies that aimed to elucidate the mechanism of action of NS1 revealed that influenza A virus infection produces very little dsRNA, and instead NS1 binds to and inhibits RIG-I directly 51 . This led the authors to conclude that RIG-I actually recognized influenza A virus genomic single-stranded RNA containing a 5\u2032 triphosphate 51 . domain. The CARDs of RIG-I and MDA5 recruit the signalling adaptor protein IFNB-promoter stimulator 1 (IPS1; also known as CARDIF, VISA or MAVS) [46] [47] [48] [49] . IPS1 resides at the outer mitochondrial membrane and interacts with RIG-I and MDA5 through its CARD. This interaction provides the link between the RLRs and the downstream kinases TANK-binding kinase 1 (TbK1) and I\u03bab kinase-\u03b5 (IKK\u03b5), which phosphorylate and activate IRF3 and IRF7 (FIG. 3) . Recently, a protein known as stimulator of IFN genes (STING) has been identified as an additional factor in the RIG-I-IPS1 signalling complex, but not in the complex containing MDA5 (ReF. 50 ). STING is located in the endoplasmic reticulum, which suggests that this intracellular compartment is also involved in RIG-I-mediated signalling.",

Recently, however, the exact nature of their nucleic acid ligands has been defined and shown to be distinct. Characterization of the mechanism by which the influenza virus A nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) inhibited RIG-I-mediated detection of viral RNA revealed that the main ligand for RIG-I is ssRNA that has a 5\u2032 triphosphate [51] [52] [53] , such as that generated by many viral RNA polymerases. Although the 5\u2032 triphosphate is necessary, it is not sufficient for RIG-I activation 54 ; the composition of the RNA sequence also has a role, as viral RNAs that contain a 5\u2032 triphosphate and a sequence of poly-uridine or riboadenine are particularly potent activators of RIG-I 54 . RIG-I can also be activated by short fragments of dsRNA 55 The vaccinia virus (VACV) protein A46R sequesters all these adaptor proteins, whereas the hepatitis C virus (HCV) protein NS5A selectively binds MyD88 and the HCV NS3-4A protease cleaves TRIF.

More specifically, the protease precursor protein 3AbC of hepatitis A virus triggers the degradation of IPS1 at the mitochondrial membrane, which disrupts RIG-I-and MDA5mediated activation of IRF3 (ReF. 68 ). In addition, as well as targeting TRIF (as discussed earlier), HCV uses the protease NS3-4A to cleave the short C-terminal RIG-I (retinoic-acid-inducible gene I) and MDA5 (melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5), termed RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs), are activated by cytoplasmic RNA during viral infection. Both signal using IFNB-promoter stimulator 1 (IPS1), which is tethered to the mitochondrial membrane. When IPS1 is engaged by RLRs, it recruits downstream signalling complexes that lead to the activation of the IFN-regulatory factors (IRFs) and nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF\u03baB). In addition, signalling through RIG-I requires the adaptor STING (stimulator of IFN genes), which resides in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER).

DAI is one such cytoplasmic DNA receptor 4 , but its role in the in vivo recognition of cytoplasmic DNA has been controversial; additional cytoplasmic DNA receptors also probably have an important role 5, 74 . Interestingly, the VACV dsRNAbinding protein E3L also has a Z-DNA-binding domain, which can inhibit the DNA-induced expression of IFN\u03b2 and prevent the interaction of DAI with DNA 5 . So, E3L may protect the VACV DNA genome from recognition by DNA receptors. As the DNAresponsive pathways are currently being investigated in more detail, additional virus-encoded inhibitors will probably be identified. Elucidating the mechanisms by which viruses disrupt DNA receptor signalling in host cells will probably be instrumental in defining the signalling mechanisms of these receptors.",

            "text": "Many PRR signalling pathways converge at the level of IKKs. All of the PRRs described previously, namely the TLRs, RLRs and cytoplasmic DNA receptor (or receptors), activate signalling cascades that converge at the level of the IKK family of proteins (FIGs 2,3). IKK\u03b1 and IKK\u03b2, which form a complex with the regulatory subunit IKK\u03b3 (also known as NEMo), phosphorylate inhibitor of NF\u03bab (I\u03bab), which leads to its degradation and consequently the release and nuclear translocation of active NF\u03bab. A second IKK complex, which is especially important for the induction of type I IFN expression, consists of IKK\u03b5, TbK1 and associated proteins. IKK\u03b5 and TbK1 phosphorylate and activate IRF3 and IRF7, which homodimerize and translocate to the nucleus (FIG. 3) . In addition to activating the IKKs, PRR signalling also activates mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signalling cascades, thereby leading to the activation of activator protein 1 (AP1) family members. Together, NF\u03bab, IRF3, IRF7 and AP1 form an active complex on the IFNB promoter that leads to transcriptional activation of this promoter. In the case of TLR7, TLR8 and TLR9, induction of IFN\u03b1 expression is largely mediated through IRF7 activation, which involves IKK\u03b1. Thus, the IKK family and the transcription factors they activate are an attractive target for inhibition by viral proteins, allowing viruses to disable the pathways that are triggered by many PRRs at the same time. 77, 78 . Furthermore, the G1 protein of pathogenic hantaviruses can inhibit TbK1 function by disrupting the TRAF3-TbK1 interaction that is required for signalling 79 (FIG. 3) . In cells in which the activity of TbK1 is inhibited, IRF3 is not phosphorylated and cannot dimerize or translocate to the nucleus 77, 79 . The dimerization and nuclear translocation of IRF3 is also inhibited by papain-like protease (PLpro) of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-associated coronavirus, which directly interacts with it 80 . A compelling example of how the study of viral evasion can reveal new host signalling mechanisms is a recent study of the VACV protein K7R 81 . K7R was found to inhibit the PRR-mediated induction of IFN\u03b2 by preventing the TbK1-IKK\u03b5-mediated activation of IRFs owing to its ability to target human DEAD-box protein 3 (DDX3) 81 . Further work confirmed that DDX3 is part of the TbK1-IKK\u03b5 complex downstream of both RLRs and cytoplasmic DNA receptors, showing for the first time that a DEAD-box helicase is involved in TbK1-IKK\u03b5mediated activation of IRFs 81 . The role of DDX3 in the activation of the IFNB promoter downstream of PRR signalling was confirmed by another recent study 82 .",

Virus-induced IRF3 degradation is a commonly used mechanism of viral evasion -other IRF3-interacting viral proteins that mediate this effect include the HIV-1 proteins Vpr and Vif 89 , and the Flaviviridae family protease N 90 . The rotavirus non-structural protein 1 (NSP1) targets IRF5 and IRF7, in addition to IRF3, for degradation 91 . Therefore, during viral infection the expression levels of the IRFs are dynamically regulated by viral factors. In fact, it has been suggested that one crucial function of the IFN effector protein ISG15 (IFN-stimulated protein of 15 kDa) (FIG. 1) is to counteract virus-mediated proteolysis of IRF3, as ISG15 covalently binds to and stabilizes IRF3, and can prevent its ubiquitin-mediated degradation by Newcastle disease virus 92 . Interestingly, VACV E3L protein has recently been shown to directly target and disable ISG15 function, which adds to the impressive repertoire of inhibitory strategies used by this viral protein 93 (TABLe 1) .",

Therefore, some viruses activate NF\u03bab to prevent the cell from undergoing apoptosis 94 . However, at early stages of infection viruses can temporarily block NF\u03bab activity to delay the innate immune response until an infection is established and the virus is less vulnerable to elimination. An example of this biphasic regulation of NF\u03bab activity is observed during infection with African swine fever virus (ASFV). The ASFV protein A238L is an early expressed degradationresistant I\u03bab\u03b1 homologue that inhibits NF\u03bab activity at early stages of infection by sequestering host NF\u03bab in the cytoplasm 95 .

For example, infection with wNV led to the TLR3-dependent production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and the subsequent disruption of the bloodbrain barrier, which facilitated entry of the virus into the brain. by contrast, infection in the absence of TLR3 led to a reduced viral load and dampened inflammatory responses in the brain 99 . However, this may have been a consequence of mouse experimental models of viral infection in which the high viral titres that are used may lead to an overpronounced inflammatory response compared with the more protective TLR3-mediated host response that occurs during natural infections 102 . Evidence for a protective role for TLR3 in natural infections comes from recent studies showing that human patients that bear mutations in TLR3 are predisposed to HSV-associated encephalitis 103 .",

For example, the VACV protein A52R inhibits the activation of NF\u03bab by interacting with IRAK2 (as discussed earlier), but it also interacts with TRAF6 in a way that leads to the activation of the MAPK p38 and the subsequent activation of the IL10 promoter 106 . Thus, under conditions of TLR stimulation (as may occur during VACV infection), A52R inhibits the expression of NF\u03bab-dependent genes, such as IL8, and instead enhances the production of IL-10 (ReF. 106) , which might contribute to the role of A52R in VACV virulence 37 . The HTLV-I protein p30 achieves the same effect as A52R, but using a different mechanism 40 . Furthermore, mouse mammary tumour virus was shown to induce IL-10 production through Figure 4 | inhibition of interferon-regulatory factor 3 (iRF3) and iRF7 by viral proteins. IRF3 and IRF7 are activated by phosphorylation, they then homodimerize and translocate to the nucleus, where they interact with their co-activators CREB-binding protein (CBP) and p300 and induce the expression of genes such as interferon-\u03b1 (IFNA) and IFNB. Viruses inhibit IRFs by inducing their degradation, sequestering them or competing with them for binding to promoter sequences.

In mice lacking functional TLR4, the virus was eliminated by the cytotoxic immune response 107 . Viruses can also use signalling proteins to support their life cycle. Although VACV K7R binds to DDX3 to inhibit its ability to enhance IFN\u03b2 expression 81 , HIV-1 and HCV go a step further as they manipulate host DDX3 for different purposes. both viruses have proteins that are known to interact with DDX3: HCV requires DDX3 for replication 108 and HIV-1 uses DDX3 to shuttle viral mRNAs out of the host-cell nucleus 109 . Therefore, for these viruses, targeting DDX3 may provide the dual benefit of suppressing the host type I IFN response in parallel to facilitating the viral life cycle.",

In the near future, we can expect a more complete description of a new family of PRRs, the cytoplasmic DNA receptors, and it will be of interest to decipher how large DNA viruses, such as poxviruses and herpesviruses, interact with these receptors.",

            "text": "Further studies that aim to understand PRR evasion and subversion will have several implications in human health. First, the molecular mechanisms that are revealed by such studies are relevant to other pathogens and diseases, as the signalling components are shared among PRRs that sense other types of pathogen. For example, in addition to its recently described role in RLR-mediated IRF3 and IRF7 activation 81 , DDX3 was also found to be important for the induction of IFN\u03b2 expression by Listeria monocytogenes 82 . Second, PRR signalling discoveries are also relevant to nonpathogen-induced disease, as many PRR pathways can contribute to autoimmunity and inflammatory disease if they inappropriately sense host molecules. So, some of the identified targets of viral proteins (such as IRAK2 and DDX3) might turn out to be new drug targets for treating a range of diseases. Third, the viral proteins themselves, or derivatives of them, may have therapeutic uses in suppressing inappropriate PRR signalling; viruses have been 'examining' the host immune machinery for millions of years, so their proteins are optimized to specifically and maximally inhibit their targets, which is analogous to a naturally occurring drug-development programme. Finally, targeting viral inhibitors therapeutically may be beneficial for restoring innate immune defences during chronic viral infections, as has been shown in in vitro studies of HCV in which NS3-4A protease inhibitors restored RIG-I signalling during infection 111 .",
