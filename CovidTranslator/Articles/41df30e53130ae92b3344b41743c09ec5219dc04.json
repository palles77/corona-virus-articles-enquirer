But fully understanding the intricacies of virus-host interactions, the first step in achieving this goal, requires the ability to view the process on a grand scale. The advent of high-throughput technologies, such as DNA microarrays and mass spectrometry, provided the first opportunities to obtain such a view. Here, we describe our efforts to use these tools to focus on the changes in cellular gene expression and protein abundance that occur in response to virus infection. By examining these changes in a comprehensive manner, we have been able to discover exciting new insights into innate immunity, interferon and cytokine signaling, and the strategies used by viruses to overcome these cellular defenses. Functional genomics may yet save the world from killer viruses. #",

I had become fascinated by the novel opportunities that were becoming available through the sequencing of the human genome and the advent of high-throughput technologies such as DNA microarrays and mass spectrometry [1] . Because these technologies provided a way to obtain a nearly comprehensive view of a biological system, I was convinced they offered the best chance to learn everything there is to know about the complex interplay between viruses and the cells they infect. Over the past eight years, my laboratory has worked tirelessly, and even obsessively, to incorporate genomic, proteomic, and information technologies into our research. Although we certainly do not yet know everything there is to know about virus-host interactions, we have made tremendous progress, and I remain convinced that genomic and proteomic approaches will be a fundamental force for pushing the field of virology forward in the years to come. In this paper, we provide a sampling of how we are using these technologies, the discoveries we have made, and how the technologies themselves have continued to evolve.",

Getting this new technology up and running required months of work. But after seemingly endless frustration, Gary Geiss was finally able to use these arrays, representing all of 1500 human genes, to evaluate the changes in cellular gene expression that occurred in a CD4+ T-cell line infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) [2] . This was a straightforward study in which we analyzed two time points after infection, and we were thrilled to observe the temporal regulation of genes involved in T-cell signaling, www.elsevier.com/locate/cytogfr Cytokine & Growth Factor Reviews 18 (2007) [441] [442] [443] [444] [445] [446] [447] [448] [449] [450] subcellular trafficking, and transcriptional regulation. Despite how simplistic this study now appears, it was the first ever to apply genomics to AIDS research and it was the cover article when published in Virology. With the technology now in place, we were eager to apply it to a broad range of experimental systems. The possibilities seemed endless (as indeed they are), and we rapidly began ''doing arrays'' on cells infected with a variety of different viruses or exposed to double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), interferon, or other treatments (Fig. 1) .",

This time, we profiled the cellular gene expression changes that occurred in HeLa cells infected with influenza virus, again analyzing two time points after infection [3] . In addition, we evaluated the cellular response to a heat-inactivated virus, allowing us to identify gene expression changes that were independent of viral replication. Genes involved in protein synthesis, transcriptional regulation, and cytokine signaling were induced by the replicating virus, and many of these changes suggested an active cellular antiviral response. Interestingly, viral replication also resulted in the down-regulation of many cellular genes, particularly at the later time point. The gene expression pattern induced by the inactivated virus included the induction of the cellular metallothionein genes, which may represent a protective response to virus-induced oxidative stress.",

Our dsRNA study identified 175 dsRNA-stimulated genes, which encoded proteins involved in a broad range of cellular functions and metabolic pathways. In addition, this study showed for the first time that many genes are also downregulated by dsRNA. Our polysome fractionation studies, headed by John Kash, revealed that many of the cellular mRNAs that are recruited to polyribosomes during influenza virus infection are involved in the control of cell proliferation and survival, mitogenesis, or the inflammatory response. In addition, many of these mRNAs contain a putative binding site for GRSF-1, a cellular mRNA-binding protein that also specifically interacts with a discrete and conserved region of the viral 5 0 untranslated region [6] .",

Our first application of gene expression profiling to HCV research was therefore to evaluate the effects of interferon treatment on cellular gene expression and to determine whether NS5A was able to alter this pattern of expression [9] . Gary Geiss again headed these studies in which we examined the effects of interferon treatment by using several types of human cells, including HeLa cells, liver cell lines, and primary fetal hepatocytes. In response to interferon, 50 of the approximately 4600 genes examined were consistently induced in each of these cell types and another 60 were induced in a cell type-specific manner. A search for interferon-stimulated response elements (ISREs) in genomic DNA located upstream of interferon-stimulated genes revealed both previously identified and novel putative ISREs. The expression of NS5A partially blocked the interferon-mediated induction of interferon-stimulated genes and inhibited the induction of a reporter gene driven from an ISRE-containing promoter, further suggesting that NS5A may play a role in HCV resistance to interferon. This study also set the stage for our use of genomics to better understand the interferon response and the varied mechanisms used by viruses to evade the effects of interferon.",

Liver transplant recipients infected with HCV develop recurrent hepatitis soon after transplantation and, in some cases, progress to fibrosis within two years of the transplant. Our goals are to identify molecular processes influencing liver disease progression and to find potential gene expression markers of early fibrosis. To achieve these goals, we are working closely with clinicians in the liver transplant unit at the University of Washington, including Anne Larson, Robert Carithers, and James Perkins, to collect biopsy samples and to integrate the gene expression data obtained from these samples with clinical observations. Our initial analyses were performed on serial liver biopsy specimens obtained from 13 transplant recipients at 0, 3, 6, and 12 months after transplantation [12] . Gene expression data were compared with clinical observations and with gene expression data obtained from 55 nontransplant HCVinfected and uninfected liver samples. Our analyses revealed several specific gene expression patterns, the first of which was unique for the transplant recipients regardless of their infection status. The corresponding genes encoded stress response proteins and blood proteins involved in coagulation that were differentially expressed in response to posttransplantation graft recovery. The second pattern was specific to HCV-infected samples and included the increased expression of genes encoding components of the interferonmediated antiviral response and immune system. This pattern was absent or suppressed in the patients who developed early fibrosis, indicating that disease progression might result from an impaired liver response to infection. Finally, we identified gene expression patterns that were specific for the 12-month biopsy specimens of all four HCVinfected patients who developed early fibrosis after transplantation. The identified gene expression patterns may prove useful for diagnostic and prognostic applications in HCV-infected patients, including predicting early progression to fibrosis. We are continuing to collect and analyze biopsy samples as new patients are recruited into the study, which should enable us to obtain increasing levels of confidence in the predictive power of the markers that we identify.",

We found that global gene expression patterns vary significantly depending upon the etiology of liver disease and that stages of liver cirrhosis can be differentiated based on gene expression patterns in ethanol-induced, but not HCV-induced, disease. Many of the gene expression changes specifically observed in HCV-infected cirrhotic livers are associated with activation of the innate immune response. In contrast, we found that intrahepatic global gene expression profiles do not differ between HCV-and HCV/HIV-1 co-infected individuals. However, a specific gene expression pattern that may be associated with HCV-induced pathogenesis was identified. This pattern has similarities to the gene expression profiles in transplant patients who progress to fibrosis within one year of transplantation, suggesting it may also be relevant to predicting disease progression.",

These types of studies typically require an animal model that can be experimentally manipulated. In this regard, research in the HCV field has been significantly enhanced by the development of a mouse model of HCV infection. This model, developed by Lorne Tyrrell and Norman Kneteman at the University of Alberta, Canada, is based on the severe combined immunodeficiency disorder (SCID)-beige/albumin (Alb)-urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) transgenic mouse. Intrasplenic injection of freshly isolated human hepatocytes into these mice leads to the repopulation of the mouse liver with human hepatocytes. The result is a mouse containing a chimeric mouse-human liver and these animals can be persistently infected with a variety of HCV genotypes [15] . The chimeric mouse model provides a number of features that make it a useful system in which to study HCV-host interactions. Because groups of mice are transplanted with hepatocytes from different donors, we have the opportunity to analyze host-specific responses to HCV. In addition, the lack of an adaptive immune response in these animals makes it possible to distinguish between virus-mediated and immune-mediated effects on gene expression. Kathie Walters is using this model to characterize the host transcriptional response to HCV infection. Because liver samples from these animals typically have small percentages of contaminating mouse liver tissue, she first evaluated the level of cross-hybridization of mouse liver mRNA to the human probes present on the microarray [16] . The small set of genes identified (less than 2% of the genes present on the array) is either removed from subsequent data analysis or changes in the expression of these genes are validated using human-specific quantitative real-time PCR.",

These results indicate that host genetic factors contribute to the variation in the host response to HCV, including the activation of innate antiviral signaling pathways. Mice with weak interferon responses also tended to have high levels of intrahepatic HCV RNA, indicating that an ineffective interferon response may allow increased levels of viral replication. These animals also accumulated higher numbers of differentially expressed genes than did mice with strong interferon responses. Interestingly, we have also observed impaired interferon responses and the accumulation of increased numbers of differentially expressed genes in the intrahepatic gene expression profiles of transplant patients who develop fibrosis within one year of transplantation.",

Gene expression profiling performed on lung tissue and tracheobronchial lymph nodes revealed that numerous genes associated with the interferon response were differentially expressed, particularly at day 4 after inoculation. We also observed an increase in the expression of genes encoding various mediators of chemotaxis, adhesion, and the transmigration of immune cells, suggesting the trafficking of these cells into the lungs and tracheobronchial lymph nodes, which was confirmed by histopathology.

In our first experiments associated with the 1918 virus, we evaluated global gene expression patterns in cells infected with wildtype influenza, engineered viruses lacking all or part of the NS1 gene, or with a virus containing the NS1 gene of the 1918 pandemic virus [31] . Deletion of the NS1 gene increased the magnitude of expression of cellular genes implicated in the interferon, NF-kB, and other antiviral pathways, and a virus with a C-terminal deletion in its NS1 gene induced a cellular gene expression pattern intermediate between the patterns induced by wild-type and NS1 knockout viruses. In contrast, a virus containing the NS1 gene from the 1918 pandemic virus was more efficient at blocking the expression of interferon-regulated genes than its parental virus. Together, these results suggested that the cellular response to influenza virus is significantly influenced by the NS1 gene and that the 1918 NS1 is a particularly effective interferon antagonist. Of course, we have since learned that the story is much more complicated.",

Significantly, these genes remained activated until the death of the animal. This was in contrast to less dramatic and delayed host immune responses (and less severe disease pathology) in mice infected with influenza viruses containing only subsets of genes from the 1918 virus. These findings indicate a cooperative interaction between the 1918 influenza genes and suggest that enhanced inflammatory and cell-death responses may contribute to severe immunopathology.",

In these studies, we evaluated the host response to the reconstructed virus using a cynomolgus macaque infection model [35] . The 1918 virus replicated to high levels and spread rapidly throughout the respiratory tract of infected animals, causing severe damage and masses of infiltrating immune cells throughout the course of infection. Genomic analyses revealed that the 1918 virus triggered an aberrantly high and sustained expression of numerous genes involved in the innate immune response, including proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines. The early and sustained host response in macaques infected with the 1918 virus was similar to what we observed in mice, indicating that critical host responses that influence disease outcome may occur very early after infection. Interestingly, the 1918 virus also appeared to selectively attenuate the expression of specific innate immune response genes, including certain genes associated with the type 1 interferon response. We have not determined the mechanism for this attenuation, but it is possible that the viral NS1 gene may play a role in regulating this response. Although the details remain to be uncovered, the atypical innate immune response induced by the 1918 virus was insufficient for protection and may actually contribute to the lethality of the virus.",

We also have the opportunity to better understand how gene expression changes in response to infection translate into changes in protein abundance and function, and how these changes correlate with clinical outcome. Moreover, we have the opportunity to assess how changes in gene expression and protein abundance affect immune cell function, and how the innate immune response develops and its link to adaptive immunity. Ultimately, we believe this integrated approach will translate into molecular signatures that predict protective immunity or pathology, biomarkers for diagnostic or prognostic assays, and a rational base for improvements to antiviral therapies or vaccine strategies.",

As an example, we are continuing to take our use of genomics in new directions and Robert Palermo is working together with Marjorie Robert-Guroff (National Cancer Institute) to pursue genomic approaches to improving AIDS vaccine development. Genomic analyses during vaccine trials may reveal gene expression markers of protective immunity or gene expression changes that are indicative of a predisposition to a particular response to immunization and subsequent challenge.
