The large number of RV types, classified into species A, B and C, hampers clear insights into the epidemiology and clinical significance of each RV type. The aim of this study was to map the circulation of RV types in the Amsterdam area. RV-positive nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal samples, collected from 2007 to 2012 in the Academic Medical Centre (Amsterdam, the Netherlands), were typed based on the sequence of the region coding for capsid proteins VP4 and VP2. RV-A, RV-B and RV-C were found in proportions of of 52.4% (334/637), 11.3% (72/ 637), and 36.2% (231/637), respectively. We detected 129 of the 167 currently classified types. RVs circulated throughout the entire year with a peak in the autumn and a decline in the summer. Some RV types were observed throughout the entire sampling period and others had a more seasonal pattern. Nine RV-A and four RV-B novel provisionally assigned types were identified. This study provides an insight into the molecular epidemiology of RVs in the Amsterdam area. The RVs circulating are diverse and include several provisionally new types.

The Academic Medical Centre receives mainly samples from the southeast area of Amsterdam. The samples were acquired from hospitalized patients and non-hospitalized patients visiting the outpatient clinics or emergency room. The reason for sampling was not systematically documented on the accompanying form for the laboratory and so could not be adequately monitored or analysed. Respiratory samples collected for research purposes and those that were not tested for RV were excluded from the analyses. A total of 1102 (17.6%) respiratory samples were positive for RV. There was no material available from five samples for additional gene sequencing. All available RV-positive samples were further characterized by sequencing the VP4/VP2 region. The sampling and virological testing were part of routine care and were executed according to hospital ethical guidelines and the Dutch code of conduct for responsible use of human tissue and medical research 2011.",

Our observation that RVs circulate during the whole year has been found repeatedly [1, 8] . Interestingly, Linder et al. also reported a dominance of RV-C in the winter months [30] . We found that some types circulate persistently, but for other types we saw a different circulation pattern where the type was detected mainly in the winter months and occasionally early spring but not throughout the rest of the year. Further studies are required to determine if this circulation pattern is typespecific or due to the small sample size of specific RV types in our study.",

Theoretically, the large amount of new PATs could be the result of local circulation of specific RV types, but as widespread occurrence has been reported for most RV types [14] , we hypothesize that there may be many more RV types to be discovered and classified.",

Because of the limited clinical information and heterogeneous composition of our study group, we were not able to evaluate the prevalence of various RV types in specific populations. A selection bias is that our study is composed of individuals attending the hospital and therefore might not completely reflect the prevalence of RV types in the general population.
