These challenges are complicated by the lack of basic epidemiological data, which makes it difficult to predict epidemics. Thus, it is important to quantify actual outbreaks as novel infectious diseases emerge. Disease severity and rate of transmission can be predicted by mathematical models using the basic reproduction number (R 0 ) [1] . For example, R 0 has been used extensively to assess pathogen transmissibility, outbreak severity and epidemiological control [2e4] .",

However, these studies typically considered community-acquired MERS infections. In this context, nosocomial infections can exhibit different R 0 values as the transmission routes for community-acquired and nosocomial infections often differ [9] . Recent studies have examined large nosocomial outbreaks of MERS-CoV infection in Jeddah and Riyadh within the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). One study reported higher nosocomial R 0 values than those from community-acquired infections when using the incidence decay with exponential adjustment (IDEA) model, which yielded values of 3.5e6.7 in Jeddah and 2.0e2.8 in Riyadh [10] . The IDEA model is simple because it does not consider the population-level immune status, which makes it especially useful for modelling emerging infectious diseases in resourcelimited settings.",

The date of symptom onset for Patient 0 was 11 th May 2015; however, he was admitted to the Pyeongtaek hospital on 15 th May 2015. Therefore, the outbreak was assumed to start on 15 th May 2015 via a simulation of the Pyeongtaek hospital outbreak. The outbreak start date for the Samsung hospital was determined to be 25 th May 2015, following the same logic ( Figure 1 ). Figure 2 shows the results of the 2014 KSA outbreak. Squares, circles and asterisks represent data aggregation of the number of cases by serial intervals of six, seven and eight days, respectively; the curves represent model fits for best-fit parameters. The estimated R 0 values for Jeddah and Riyadh were in the range of 3.95e6.68 and 1.92e2.52, respectively, using serial intervals of six to eight days. The estimated R 0 values for the Korea MERS outbreak were 3.96, 4.91 and 5.95 for serial intervals of six, seven and eight days, respectively (Figure 3 ). Since most cases were related to nosocomial infections, R 0 for each hospital was also considered.

The Pyeongtaek hospital exhibited best-fit R 0 values of 4.04, 4.23 and 4.39 for serial intervals of six, seven and eight days, respectively, while the Samsung hospital exhibited greater R 0 values of 5.0, 6.8 and 8.11 for serial intervals of six, seven and eight days, respectively.

In this context, Hsieh used the Richards model to estimate R 0 values for the Korean outbreak as 7.0e19.3. However, the Richards model does not consider any countermeasures implemented during an outbreak; therefore, it can only be used after an outbreak has peaked.",

This time period depends on the temporal relationship between the infectiousness of the disease, the clinical onset of the source case, and the incubation period of the receiving case [17] . As MERS becomes infectious with the onset of clinical symptoms, the MERS latency period equals the incubation period. Therefore, the shortest serial interval could be the same as the incubation period, and the longest serial interval could be the sum of the incubation period and the maximum duration of infectiousness. During the Korean MERS outbreak, several superspreading events occurred because the MERS cases were not isolated immediately upon presentation of clinical symptoms [18] . Thus, these cases contacted susceptible individuals for up to one week after the onset of their clinical symptoms. However, most MERS cases with laboratory confirmation were isolated immediately after onset of clinical symptoms [19, 20] . In this study, as the incubation period was two to 14 days (median: six days), the serial interval was slightly longer than the incubation period. The IDEA model with several serial intervals (four to 12 days) was used and found that intervals of six to eight days provided the best fit. For KSA data, even though the reported date was used instead of the onset date, R 0 was not affected because aggregated data by serial intervals was used in the analysis.",

Based on these findings, it appears that nosocomial MERS-CoV outbreaks in KSA and South Korea had higher R 0 values than the previously assumed values of <1. Although community-acquired infections are caused by contact, nosocomial infections are caused by a combination of contact and aerosol transmission; therefore, R 0 values for nosocomial infections can be higher than those for communityacquired infections. Hence, more comprehensive countermeasures are needed to address nosocomial MERS infections and prevent spread.",
