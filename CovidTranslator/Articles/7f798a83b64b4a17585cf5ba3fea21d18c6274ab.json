            "text": "Viral enteric diseases in poultry, especially in turkeys and chickens, have an important economic impact because of production losses due to poor weight gain. The most important viruses associated with poult enteritis are adenoviruses, astroviruses, turkey coronavirus, enterovirus-like viruses, reovirus, rotavirus (RV) and turkey torovirus (Fitzgerald, 2008; Jones, 2008; Reynolds et al., 1987a; Reynolds and Schultz-Cherry, 2008; . RV infection is suspected to be a cause of diarrhoea and it has been associated with runting and stunting syndrome (RSS) in chicken or turkey broilers (Otto et al., 2006; Pantin-Jackwood et al., 2007; Reynolds et al., 1987a,b; Saif et al., 1985; Spackman et al., 2010; Schat, 1986, 1987) . Numerous surveys of virus incidence have shown that poultry flocks are frequently infected with RV (Alfieri et al., 1989; Bellinzoni et al., 1987; Gough et al., 1992; Legrottaglie et al., 1997; McNulty et al., 1978 McNulty et al., , 1979 McNulty et al., , 1984a Minamoto et al., 1988; Otto et al., 2006; Pantin-Jackwood et al., 2007; Reynolds et al., 1987b,c; Saif et al., 1985; Takase et al., 1990) . Veterinary Microbiology 156 (2012) 8-15 Avian rotaviruses (AvRVs) represent a diverse group of intestinal viruses, which are suspected as the cause of several diseases in poultry with symptoms of diarrhoea, growth retardation or runting and stunting syndrome (RSS). To assess the distribution of AvRVs in chickens and turkeys, we have developed specific PCR protocols. These protocols were applied in two field studies investigating faecal samples or intestinal contents of diseased birds derived from several European countries and Bangladesh. In the first study, samples of 166 chickens and 33 turkeys collected between 2005 and 2008 were tested by PAGE and conventional RT-PCR and AvRVs were detected in 46.2%. In detail, 16.1% and 39.2% were positive for AvRVs of groups A or D, respectively. 11.1% of the samples contained both of them and only four samples (2.0%) contained rotaviruses showing a PAGE pattern typical for groups F and G. In the second study, samples from 375 chickens and 18 turkeys collected between 2009 and 2010 were analyzed using a more sensitive group A-specific and a new group D-specific real-time RT-PCR. In this survey, 85.0% were AvRV-positive, 58.8% for group A AvRVs, 65.9% for group D AvRVs and 38.9% for both of them. Although geographical differences exist, the results generally indicate a very high prevalence of group A and D rotaviruses in chicken and turkey flocks with cases of diarrhoea, growth retardation or RSS. The newly developed diagnostic tools will help to investigate the epidemiology and clinical significance of AvRV infections in poultry.",

            "text": "Rotaviruses belong to the family Reoviridae and have a non-enveloped viral capsid containing 11 segments of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) (Estes and Kapikian, 2007) . Viral particles consist of three protein layers. The intermediate layer consists of the viral structure protein (VP) 6, which is used for serological grouping of RVs. The electrophoretic migration pattern of the genome segments separated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) was also used for a rapid grouping of RVs (Bridger, 1994; Estes and Kapikian, 2007; Johne et al., 2011; Theil et al., 1986; Trojnar et al., 2010) . Most of the RV strains detected in humans and animals belong to group A (RV-A). Accordingly, a high percentage of avian RVs (AvRVs) belong to group A, but group D (RV-D) strains have also been frequently detected in avian species. Furthermore, AvRVs of group F and group G have been occasionally found. Commonly, electron microscopy, PAGE, or enzymelinked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) are used to detect AvRVs (Bellinzoni et al., 1987; Elschner et al., 2002; Legrottaglie et al., 1997; McNulty et al., 1979; Otto et al., 2006; Theil et al., 1986; Todd and McNulty, 1986) . More recently, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) protocols have been employed Pantin-Jackwood et al., 2007) . However, until now the examination of poultry samples by the latter method was restricted to detection of AvRVs of group A, because sequence data of other AvRV groups were lacking.",

Two studies were performed with samples derived from a variety of European countries and Bangladesh. In the first study, PAGE and conventional RT-PCR were applied to AvRV RNA detection. The PAGE is almost as sensitive as electron microscopy and enables identification of non-AvRV-A or-D strains (Otto et al., 2006; Johne et al., 2011) . In the second study, more sensitive real-time RT-PCR assays were used for AvRV-A and -D detection.",

The cell culture adapted AvRV-A strains from chicken and turkey were used for infectivity titrations by preparing serial 10fold dilutions of supernatants from infected MA-104 cells (Schumann et al., 2009 ). Aliquots of each dilution were inoculated onto four wells containing a confluent MA-104 cell monolayer. The presence of a cytopathic effect was observed daily and the 50% tissue culture infective dose (TCID 50 ) was estimated according to Spearman and K\u00e4 rber (Mayr et al., 1974) at day 4 post inoculation. Thereafter, the RNA was isolated from the undiluted cell culture supernatants using the QIAamp Viral RNA Kit 1 (Qiagen) and serial 10-fold RNA dilutions were prepared in duplicate. The preparations were subsequently tested in parallel using the different real-time RT-PCR protocols and the detection limits were correlated with the TCID 50 of the corresponding dilutions. To compare the sensitivity of AvRV-D-specific real-time and conventional PCR protocols, a similar dilution series was prepared from RNA of a faecal sample containing AvRV-D strain and the dilutions were tested in parallel by the assays.",

In these studies, a range of rotavirus detection systems with different specificity and sensitivity was applied leading to high variations in the estimation of the prevalence of AvRV in poultry. Only a few RT-PCR protocols are available for detection of AvRVs and all of them exclusively detect AvRV-A Elschner et al., 2002; Pantin-Jackwood et al., 2007) . Therefore, the main objective of this study was the identification of the most prevalent AvRV groups and the subsequent development of RT-PCR methods for their detection. As it became evident, that AvRV-D occurs with high very frequency in chickens and turkeys, sensitive realtime RT-PCR assays for detection of both, AvRV-A and AvRV-D have been successfully developed. To our knowledge, this is the first study applying such assays to assess of the distribution of AvRV in diseased chicken and turkey.",

As reported in several previous studies, AvRV-D was the most commonly found rotavirus in turkeys (McNulty and Reynolds, 2008; Reynolds et al., 1987a,b; Theil et al., 1986) . Co-infections with AvRV-D and astrovirus in turkeys have also been frequently detected . In contrast, very little information is available on the occurrence of AvRV-D in chicken. Here, we show that AvRV-D is also frequently present in chicken, representing the most abundant AvRV group in many of the investigated chicken flocks. In contrast, only 4 chicken samples contained AvRV particles with electropherotypes typically for AvRV-F and AvRV-G groups. Prototype viruses of these RV groups, the A4 and 555 isolates, were first observed in gut contents of chicken in Northern Ireland (McNulty et al., 1984a; Ramig et al., 2005) . Based on our results, AvRV-F and AvRV-G seem to represent rare rotavirus groups in chickens, at least in the timeframe and the geographical regions investigated in this study. It should be taken into account, however, that identification of RV groups by PAGE is difficult as genome rearrangements may occur in rotaviruses (Desselberger, 1996) . In addition, the sensitivity of PAGE is generally low. The availability of genomic sequences of AvRV-F and AvRV-G may enable the future development of RT-PCR methods for detection of these RV groups, which could be more sensitive and specific than PAGE.",

As a result, the detection rates of both AvRV groups were very high, with 65.9% of the samples positive for AvRV-D and 58.8% for AvRV-A. Although differences between the flocks of different geographical origin exist, these high detection rates were found in all countries tested. As only 2 out of the analyzed 30 flocks did not contain birds showing diarrhoea, growth retardation or RSS, the clinical significance of the rotaviruses detected cannot be inferred from this study. However, the relatively low AvRV incidence combined with the low virus amount detected in the samples from these clinically healthy flocks may give a first indication for involvement of these viruses in disease development.",

Indeed, the realtime RT-PCR assay for detection of the AvRV-A turned out to be about 1000-fold more sensitive than the conventional RT-PCR assay as assessed by using an infectious AvRV-A strain from chicken. This difference in sensitivity might be due to the use of different primer binding sequences in the two assays. In contrast, the real-time RT-PCR assay for detection of AvRV-D showed the same sensitivity as compared to the respective conventional RT-PCR protocol as assessed by using a defined AvRV-D-containing intestinal sample. This might be explained by the fact, that both assays used the same primer pair. In concordance with this result, the relative low sensitivity of the AvRV-Dspecific real-time RT-PCR was confirmed by using in vitrotranscribed RNA. Therefore, a further optimization of this assay might be useful in future.",

A recent sequence analysis of AvRV-A strains showed that isolates from chickens and turkeys cluster into two different phylogenetic lineages (Schumann et al., 2009) . These sequence differences were also observed, when the VP6-encoding genome segment was compared, which is the target used for the RT-PCR assays. Therefore, it might be necessary to use separate assays for sensitive detection of chicken and turkey RV-A strains. The additional real-time RT-PCR protocol developed here with modified primers and probes for detection of the turkey strains showed a high sensitivity with the cell-culturederived turkey virus and may be applied in future field studies.",
