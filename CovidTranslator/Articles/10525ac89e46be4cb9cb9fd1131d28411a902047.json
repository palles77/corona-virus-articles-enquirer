The rapid growth of the internet has fostered a corresponding increase in tools for internet based disease detection and monitoring that lie at the other end of the spectrum. Digital disease surveillance consists of monitoring online information sources to collate relevant information about diseases. The sources of information can be formal such as advisories posted by a ministry of health, or informal such as news media items, blogs or tweets. Digital surveillance makes data collection less expensive and time consuming but the acquired data often contain more noise than those collected through traditional public health surveillance. While traditional surveillance systems report on select pathogens and depend on a well-functioning public health infrastructure, digital surveillance in contrast typically monitor a wide range of pathogens using little to no additional infrastructure. Thus, digital surveillance tools can play a significant role in the rapid recognition of public health emergencies [9, 10] .",

ProMED collates information from various sources that include media reports, official reports, local observers, and a network of clinicians throughout the world. The reports generated through bottom-up surveillance are reviewed by a team of subject matter experts before being posted to the ProMED network.

In addition to ProMED alerts, HealthMap utilises online news aggregators, eyewitness reports and other formal and informal sources of information and allows for visualisation of alerts on a map [12] . The surveillance data collected by HealthMap has been incorporated into the Epidemic Intelligence from Open Sources (EIOS) surveillance system, developed by WHO. Both ProMED and HealthMap are used by key public health bodies, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and surveillance process. Compiling the data, conducting analyses, and generating reports that are easily understood and actionable are equally important. For instance, one of the ProMED outbreak analysts reported in March 2014 on the likely spread of Zika to the Americas [13] , well before the epidemic surfaced in South America in February 2015. However, lacking an easy to use and openly accessible tool to quantify and visualize the reported risk of disease spread, this report did not have any significant impact on public health resource allocation and decision making. While there has been a growing interest in using various internet data streams for epidemiological investigations [14, 15] and in using data from digital surveillance tools [16] , there is as yet a dearth of a framework that can automatically combine such data with other streams of information, analyse them in a statistically robust manner, and produce actionable reports, particularly in real time during an outbreak where such analyses would be most useful.",

Our approach relies on a relatively simple statistical framework that integrates multiple data streams to predict the future incidence trajectory, and quantifies spatial heterogeneity in the risk of disease spread. In this paper, we present the model implemented in this framework and as a case study, we report the analysis of ProMED and HealthMap data for the 2013-16 West African Ebola epidemic. To assess the robustness of the digital surveillance data, we also applied the framework to the data collated by WHO and made available at the end of the epidemic. We present a comparison of the near real-time ProMED/HealthMap data with the retrospective WHO data and the results of the spatio-temporal analysis carried out on these three data sources.",

There were substantial differences between the incidence time series derived from the three data sources, particularly at the peak of the epidemic. There may be multiple reasons underpinning such discrepancy, including potential variability in digital surveillance reporting during the course of the epidemic. It is also worth highlighting that the WHO data used here are an extensively cleaned version of the data collected during the epidemic [17, 18] , published more than a year after the epidemic was declared to be over. Moreover, while ProMED and HealthMap did not record probable cases for this epidemic, the WHO data contained confirmed, probable and suspected cases. However, despite these discrepancies, the weekly incidence derived from ProMED and HealthMap was moderately to highly correlated with that reported by WHO later (Pearson's correlation coefficients aggregated across the three countries 0.44 and 0.74 respectively, p value < 0.001, also see Fig 2 for weekly trends).",

R t was estimated independently for each country using the R package EpiEstim [20] over a sliding time window of 4 weeks.

For each week and each country in Africa, our model generated an alert if the predicted incidence (using a predetermined percentile of the forecast interval) was greater than 0. We classified an alert for a given week as a true alert when the observed incidence was also greater than 0, as a false alert when no cases were observed, and as a missed alert if cases were observed but were not predicted by the model. Using different percentiles of the forecast (e.g., the median or the 95 th percentile) yielded different rates of true, false and missed alerts, which were summarised in a ROC curve ( Fig 4A) . Overall, our model achieved high sensitivity (i.e., true alert rate) but variable specificity (i.e., 1 -false alert rate). Maximising the average between sensitivity and specificity led to 93.7% sensitivity and 96.0% specificity at 42.5% threshold ( Fig 4A) . The sensitivity of the model remained high over longer forecast horizon while the specificity deteriorated with more false alerts being raised 4 week ahead (Fig 47) . Both the sensitivity and the specificity of the model remained high when the analysis was restricted to all countries in Africa other than the three majorly affected countries (Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone) . The average of sensitivity and specificity was maximum at 92.5% threshold in this case with 85.7% sensitivity and 81.7% specificity (Fig 48) . The model exhibited high sensitivity (83.3%) and specificity (82.0%) in predicting presence of cases in weeks following a week with no observed cases in all countries in Africa (Fig 49) at 93% threshold (similarly chosen to maximise the average between sensitivity and specificity). Out of the 9 one-week ahead missed alerts in this case, 3 are in Liberia towards the end of the epidemic, after Liberia had been declared Ebola free on two separate occasions [22, 23] . The serial interval distribution that we have used does not account for very long intervals between infections such as that associated with sexual transmission. Using the latest available data on pairs of primary and secondary infections and models that allow for more heterogeneity in the distribution of cases e.g., using Negative Binomial distributions could potentially improve the assessment of risk of spread in such cases [24, 25] .",

Our method also provides estimates of the probability of a case staying within a country throughout their infectious period, and the extent to which distance between two locations affects the flow of infectious cases between them. The real-time estimates of these parameters over the course of the epidemic (Fig 34) , suggest that while the relative flow of cases between locations did not vary substantially over time, the probability of travel across national borders may have decreased after the initial phase of the epidemic. Finally, we quantify the relative risk of importation of a case into a country from any other currently affected country. The risk of importation is proportional to the population flow into a country from all other countries estimated using a mobility model (here, gravity model) weighted by the infectivity at each country (which depends on the number of cases and time at which they were infected, see Methods). Our estimates of the countries with higher risk of acting as source of importations are largely consistent with the reported source of cases (Fig 5) . In 4 out of the 5 reported cases of international spread of the epidemic in West Africa, the model correctly attributed the highest relative risk of acting as a source of importation (relative risk > 0.9 for importation into Liberia, Nigeria and Sierra Leone and 0.49 in case of Mali) to the actual source identified through retrospective epidemiological and genomic investigations [26] .",

In this study, we propose a statistical framework that relies on digital surveillance data from ProMED or HealthMap to 1) predict the short-term epidemic trajectory in currently affected countries, 2) quantify the short-term risk of spread to other countries and 3) for countries at risk of importation, quantify where the risk comes from. We apply our model to data collected during the West African Ebola epidemic of 2013-2016, curated by the outbreak analysts at ProMED/HealthMap, and we compare the model's outputs to those obtained when using the data collated by the WHO and made available at the end of the epidemic.",

Despite these challenges, we show the potential of digital surveillance tools to 1) inform early detection, 2) characterise the spread, and 3) forecast the future trajectory of outbreaks. Particularly in an evolving outbreak scenario, when information from traditional surveillance is limited and only available with a significant delay, digital surveillance data can be used to complement the information gap. For instance, during the West African Ebola epidemic, the first situation report by the WHO was published only at the end of August 2014 [27] , reporting on cases between January and August 2014. On the other hand, the first post on ProMED on Ebola cases in Guinea appeared in March 2014 [28] . Development of tools that can directly be plugged into the current digital surveillance ecosystem should therefore be a growing area of focus.",

We fitted a spatially explicit branching process model to the daily incidence data derived from ProMED/HealthMap feeds. The estimated model parameters were used to simulate the future outbreak trajectory over 4, 6 or 8 weeks. The model performs relatively well at short forecast horizon, i.e. up to two weeks. At a longer time scale, the model performance starts to deteriorate. A likely explanation for this is that our model assumes that transmissibility remains constant over the entire projection window. This assumption may not hold as we project over longer horizons, for example due to interventions being implemented. Model performance was also highly dependent on the phase of the epidemic in which projections were made. During the growing phase, the model tended to over-predict. This is likely due to interventions implemented throughout the growing phase to reduce transmissibility, leading to a reduced observed incidence compared to our model's expectation. In the declining phase on the other hand, our model tended to under-predict the observed incidence. This could be due to control efforts being relaxed too early as case numbers decline. Another contributing factor could be super-spreading, a phenomenon observed in many epidemics including Ebola epidemics [29, 30] whereby a small number of cases generate a large number of secondary infections, implying that when case numbers are small, epidemic trajectory may be difficult to predict and not well described by Poisson likelihood. Models using more complex likelihoods, e.g. using Negative Binomial distributions, 10 should be explored in future work, but will present additional challenges as analytical results underpinning the estimation of the reproduction number will no longer hold [20] . Such variability in model performance throughout an epidemic could have important implications if the model predictions are used to inform resource allocation. Model estimates should therefore be interpreted with caution, particularly as an outbreak is observed to be declining, and if the forecast horizon is long.",

Choosing a cut-off to maximise sensitivity led to low model specificity. On occasions the model predicted cases in countries, such as C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, where neither WHO nor ProMED reported any case. However this may also be due to imperfect case reporting. Thus our method could be used with a high cut-off as a highly sensitive surveillance system with an alert triggering further epidemiological investigations and implementation of epidemic preparedness measures.",

The collection of case incidence data and rapid dissemination through digital surveillance systems was further hampered by the limited information technology and internet service in the countries most affected. Thus, for the West African Ebola epidemic, ProMED and HealthMap data were available at a coarse spatial scale with the sub-national level information for cases missing in most of the records. This limited our analysis to the spread of the outbreak across national borders only, although in principle our model could 11 deal with data at any spatial scale. Both ProMED and HealthMap collect more granular data for most outbreaks. Utilizing these data to investigate outbreaks and regions would provide further evidence of the ability of digital surveillance data to usefully complement data collected from traditional surveillance. Another interesting research avenue would be to explore ways of integrating timely data from ProMED and HealthMap with delayed data from ground surveillance to generate timely insights into the spatial spread of an outbreak.",

To further develop such approaches, it is important to establish an automated pipeline from data collection to curation to analysis, which currently requires manual intervention at each of these steps. Another factor that could enhance the usability of our model in near real time is to improve the running time of the fitting and forward simulation. In the current implementation, the running time varies from approximately 0.5 CPU hours when 100 days of incidence data are being used to approximately 335 CPU hours using 462 days of incidence data using a 3.3 GHz Intel Xeon X5680 processor.

In addition to utilising other possible data sources, future work could consider other models of human population movement [33] . When relevant, spatially-explicit data on population-level immunity to the circulating pathogen (e.g. following previous epidemics and/or due to vaccination) could also be used to refine our transmission model. Finally, the impact of the health capacity of a region to respond to a public health emergency could also be accounted for in future iterations of the model. Ongoing efforts to collate quantitative information on the performance of health systems and the ability of regions or countries to respond to an epidemic [34], [35] can potentially provide valuable data for future work.

The top panel shows the weekly incidence derived from ProMED data and the 4 weeks incidence forecast on log scale. The solid dots represent the observed weekly incidence where the light blue dots show weeks for which all data points were obtained using interpolation. The projections are made over 4 week windows, based on the reproduction number estimated in the previous 2 weeks. The middle figure in each panel shows the reproduction number used to make forecasts over each 4 week forecast horizon. The bottom figure shows the effective reproduction number estimated retrospectively using the full dataset up to the length of one calibration window before the end. In each case, the solid black line is the median estimate and the shaded region represents the 95% Credible Interval. The red horizontal dashed line indicates the R t = 1 threshold. Results are shown for the three mainly affected countries although the analysis was done jointly using data for all countries in Africa.",

The performance metrics are (A) the percentage of weeks for which the 95% forecast interval contained the observed incidence, (B) relative mean absolute error, (C) bias, and (D) sharpness. In forecasting ahead, we assumed transmissibility to be constant over the forecast horizon. If the 97.5 th percentile of the R estimate used for forecasting was less than 1, we defined the epidemic to be in the declining phase during this period. Similarly, if the 2.5 th percentile of R was greater than 1, we defined the epidemic to be in a growing phase. The phase was set to stable where the 95% Credible Interval of the R estimates contained 1. See Methods for definitions of each metric.",

The left panel shows the True and False alert rates using different thresholds for classification for alerts raised 1 (violet), 2 (light violet), 3 (dark pink) and 4 (green) weeks ahead. The black curve depicts the overall True and False alert rates. On each curve, the dot shows the True and False Alert rates at 42.5% threshold. For a given threshold (x th percentile of the forecast interval), we defined a True alert for a week where the x th percentile of the forecast interval and the observed incidence for a country were both greater than 0; false alert for a week where the threshold for a country was greater than 0 but the observed incidence for that country was 0; and missed alert for a week where the threshold for a country was 0 but the observed incidence for that country was greater than 0. True alert rate is the ratio of correctly classified true alerts to the total number of true and missed alerts (i.e., (true alerts)/(true alerts + missed alerts)). False alert rate is similarly the ratio of false alerts to the total number of false alerts and weeks of no alert (where the observed and the threshold incidence are both 0). The right panel shows the True (green), False (orange) and Missed (red) 1 week ahead alerts using the 42.5 th percentile of the forecast interval as threshold. The figure only shows countries on the African continent for which either the 42.5 th percentile of the predicted incidence or the observed incidence was greater than 0 at least once. The first alert in each country is shown using larger squares. Alerts in a country in a week where there were no observed cases in the previous week are shown using triangles. In each case, weeks for which all observed points were imputed are shown in lighter shades. Country codes, shown on the yaxis, are as follows: CIV -C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, GHA -Ghana, GIN -Guinea, LBR -Liberia, MLI -Mali, NGA -Nigeria, SEN -Senegal, SLE -Sierra Leone, BFA -Burkina Faso. The alerts are based on forecasts using ProMED data, a 2-week calibration window and a 4 week forecast horizon.",

Since we forecasted every 7 th day, the risk of importation was estimated using forecasts closest to and before the date of the first case in that country reported in the data used. The date on which risk was estimated for each country is shown in the figure. Blue indicates low relative risk while deeper shades of red represent higher relative risk of acting as a source of importation. White is used to denote no risk. The estimates presented here use ProMED data with a 2 week calibration window. The country for which risk is estimated is shown in gray. The black circle represents the actual source of importation as retrospectively identified through epidemiological and genomic investigations. For each country, the figure shows only the risk of importation from other countries and does not show the risk of transmission within the country.",

The solid dots represent the observed weekly incidence where the light green dots show weeks for which all data points were obtained using interpolation. The projections are made over 6 week windows, based on the reproduction number estimated in the previous 4 weeks. The middle figure in each panel shows the reproduction number used to make forecasts over each 6 week forecast horizon. The bottom figure shows the effective reproduction number estimated retrospectively using the full dataset up to the length of one calibration window before the end. In each case, the solid black line is the median estimate and the shaded region represents the 95% Credible Interval. The red horizontal dashed line indicates the R t = 1 threshold.

As the epidemic progressed, the parameter p stay assumed larger values suggesting a decreased probability of travel over time (Figures 34, 35) . As p stay assumes large values, the estimated flow is more strongly influenced by p stay than by \u03b3. Furthermore, p stay is likely to depend on the spatial scale of the model. Our analyses were carried out at the national scale; we expect that \u03b3 will be more sensitive to p stay at a finer spatial resolution. Overall, the flow between locations using the parameters estimated using the two alternative priors did not vary much (Fig 36) . Figures 37 to 45 present the model forecasts using the alternative priors for \u03b3 and Figure 46 presents a comparison of model performance metrics using the two priors. Although the analysis was carried out for the three data sources (ProMED, HealthMap and WHO), for brevity we present results using ProMED data only. Here \u03b3 is allowed to vary between 1 and 10. p stay represents the probability of an individual to stay in a given location during their infectious period. The solid lines represents the median estimates obtained using ProMED (blue), HealthMap (green) and WHO (yellow) data. The shaded regions represent the 95% CrI.",

Classification of alerts raised 1, 2, 3, and 4 weeks ahead are shown in Fig 47. We also assessed the sensitivity of the model when the analysis was restricted to countries other than Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone (Fig 48) . At 93% threshold, the model exhibited high specificity (83.3%) and sensitivity (82.0%) in predicting presence of cases in weeks following a week with no observed cases in each country (Fig 49) . In predicting presence of cases in countries with no or low incidence, or in a week following a week in which no cases were observed, the sensitivity improved at higher thresholds with a reasonably low false alert rate (Fig 50) . Finally, we find that the model is able to attain a high sensitivity and specificity relatively early in the epidemic using all three data sources (Fig 51) . Since WHO data used here were only available for Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, we affixed data from ProMED for all countries other than these three to WHO data for the purpose of classifying alerts.",

The left panel shows the True and False alert rates using different thresholds for classification for alerts raised 1 (violet), 2 (light violet), 3 (dark pink) and 4 (light pink) weeks ahead. The black curve depicts the overall True and False alert rates. On each curve, the dot shows the True and False Alert rates at 93% threshold. For a given threshold (x th percentile of the forecast interval), we defined a True alert for a week where the x th percentile of the forecast interval and the observed incidence for a country were both greater than 0; false alert for a week where the threshold for a country was greater than 0 but the observed incidence for that country was 0; and missed alert for a week where the threshold for a country was 0 but the observed incidence for that country was greater than 0. True alert rate is the ratio of correctly classified true alerts to the total number of true and missed alerts (i.e., (true alerts)/(true alerts + missed alerts)). False alert rate is similarly the ratio of false alerts to the total number of false alerts and weeks of no alert (where the observed and the threshold incidence are both 0). The right panel shows the True (green), False (orange) and Missed (red) 1 week ahead alerts using the 93 rd percentile of the forecast interval as threshold. The figure only shows countries on the African continent for which either the 93 rd percentile of the predicted incidence or the observed incidence was greater than 0 at least once. The first alert in each country is shown using larger symbols (square or triangle). Alerts in a country in a week where there were no observed cases in the previous week are shown using hollow triangles. In each case, weeks for which all observed points were imputed are shown in lighter shades. Country codes, shown on the y-axis, are as follows: BFA -Burkina Faso, CIV -C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, GHA -Ghana, GIN -Guinea, LBR -Liberia, MLI -Mali, NGA -Nigeria, SEN -Senegal, SLE -Sierra Leone. The alerts are based on forecasts using the ProMED data, a 2-week calibration window and a 4 week forecast horizon.",

In forecasting ahead, we assumed transmissibility to be constant over the forecast horizon. If the 97.5 th percentile of the R estimate used for forecasting was less than 1, we defined the epidemic to be in the declining phase during this period. Similarly, if the 2.5 th percentile of R was greater than 1, we defined the epidemic to be in a growing phase.

The left panel shows the True and False alert rates using different thresholds for classification for alerts raised 1 (violet), 2 (light violet), 3 (dark pink) and 4 (light pink) weeks ahead. The black curve depicts the overall True and False alert rates. On each curve, the dot shows the True and False Alert rates at 93% threshold. For a given threshold (x th percentile of the forecast interval), we defined a True alert for a week where the x th percentile of the forecast interval and the observed incidence for a country were both greater than 0; false alert for a week where the threshold for a country was greater than 0 but the observed incidence for that country was 0; and missed alert for a week where the threshold for a country was 0 but the observed incidence for that country was greater than 0. True alert rate is the ratio of correctly classified true alerts to the total number of true and missed alerts (i.e., (true alerts)/(true alerts + missed alerts)). False alert rate is similarly the ratio of false alerts to the total number of false alerts and weeks of no alert (where the observed and the threshold incidence are both 0). The right panel shows the True (green), False (orange) and Missed (red) 1 week ahead alerts using the 93 rd percentile of the forecast interval as threshold. The figure only shows countries on the African continent for which either the 93 rd percentile of the predicted incidence or the observed incidence was greater than 0 at least once. The first alert in each country is shown using larger symbols (square or triangle). Alerts in a country in a week where there were no observed cases in the previous week are shown using hollow triangles. In each case, weeks for which all observed points were imputed are shown in lighter shades. Country codes, shown on the y-axis, are as follows: BFA -Burkina Faso, CIV -C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, GHA -Ghana, GIN -Guinea, LBR -Liberia, MLI -Mali, NGA -Nigeria, SEN -Senegal, SLE -Sierra Leone. The alerts are based on forecasts using the ProMED data, a 2-week calibration window and a 4 week forecast horizon.",
