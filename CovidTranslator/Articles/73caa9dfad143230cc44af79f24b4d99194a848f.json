NSP2 exists as stable doughnut-shaped octamers within the infected cell, representing the tail-to-tail interaction of two tetramers. Extending diagonally across the surface of each octamer are four highly basic grooves that function as binding sites for single-stranded RNA. Between the N and C-terminal domains of each monomer is a deep electropositive cleft containing a catalytic site that hydrolyzes the \u03b3-\u03b2 phosphoanhydride bond of any NTP. The catalytic site has similarity to those of the histidine triad (HIT) family of nucleotide-binding proteins. Due to the close proximity of the grooves and clefts, we investigated the possibility that the RNA-binding activity of the groove promoted the insertion of the 5\u2032-triphosphate moiety of the RNA into the cleft, and the subsequent hydrolysis of its \u03b3-\u03b2 phosphoanhydride bond. Our results show that NSP2 hydrolyzes the \u03b3P from RNAs and NTPs through Mg 2+dependent activities that proceed with similar reaction velocities, that require the catalytic His225 residue, and that produce a phosphorylated intermediate. Competition assays indicate that although both substrates enter the active site, RNA is the preferred substrate due to its higher affinity for the octamer. The RNA triphosphatase (RTPase) activity of NSP2 may account for the absence of the 5\u2032-terminal \u03b3P on the (\u2212) strands of the double-stranded RNA genome segments. This is the first report of a HIT-like protein with a multifunctional catalytic site, capable of accommodating both NTPs and RNAs during \u03b3P hydrolysis.",

            "text": "Rotaviruses, members of the Reoviridae family, are the leading cause of acute gastroenteritis in young children throughout the world. 1 The rotavirus virion is a triple-layered icosahedral particle containing 11 segments of double-stranded (ds)RNA. 2, 3 Loss of the outer-most layer during entry give rises to a transcriptionally active double-layered particle (DLP) that directs the synthesis of viral (+)-strand RNAs. 4 The (+)-strand RNAs are replicated to dsRNAs and packaged into pre-virion core particles within large inclusion bodies (viroplasms) that form in the cytoplasm of the infected cell. [5] [6] [7] Interactions between two abundant non-structural proteins, NSP2 and NSP5, are essential for the formation of such inclusions. [8] [9] [10] These proteins are also components of the replication intermediates that synthesize dsRNAs in viroplasms. 5, 11, 12 The association of NSP2 with such intermediates may be mediated by interaction with the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP), VP1. 13 NSP2 is a basic protein (M r = 35,000) that selfassembles into stable doughnut-shaped octamers, formed by the tail-to-tail interaction of two tetramers ( Figure 1 ). 14 The overall architecture of such octamers is highly conserved even among distantly related groups of rotaviruses. 15 The octamers possess single-stranded (ss)RNA-binding activity capable of destabilizing RNA-RNA duplexes by an ATP and Mg 2+ independent mechanism. 16, 17 In addition, the octamers have a Mg 2+ -dependent nucleosidetriphosphate phosphohydrolase (NTPase) activity that cleaves the \u03b3-\u03b2 phosphoanhydride bond of any nucleoside triphosphate (NTP), yielding the products NDP and P i . 16 Following cleavage, the \u03b3P is transferred to NSP2, generating a short-lived phosphorylated form of the protein. 16, 18 The hydrolitic activity of NSP2 is essential for genome replication. 15 NSP2 octamers in the presence of NTPs undergo a conformational transition, shifting from a relaxed to a more condensed state as is typical of molecular motors. 19 Collectively, these properties have led to the suggestion that the NSP2 octamer may facilitate genome packaging and replication by relaxing secondary structures in viral template RNAs that impede polymerase function and by assisting in the translocation of viral RNAs into pre-virion cores.",

            "text": "The NSP2 monomer has two distinct domains (N and C-terminal), separated by an electropositive 25 \u00c5 deep cleft that contains residues involved in the binding and hydrolysis of NTPs. The location of the NTP-binding site was initially proposed based on the structural similarity of the C-terminal domain with the catalytic core of protein kinase C-interacting protein (PKCI), a prototypical member of the histidine triad (HIT) family of nucleotide-binding proteins. 14, 20 Although lacking a precise signature HIT motif (H\u00d8H\u00d8H\u00d8\u00d8, where is \u00d8 is a hydrophobic residue), mutagenesis has indicated that conserved basic residues in the NSP2 cleft form a HIT-like motif (H 221 -G-(K/H)-\u00d8-H 225 -\u00d8-R-V) responsible for the binding and hydrolysis of NTPs. 18 More recently, data obtained by co-crystallization of NSP2 with nucleotide analogs has shown that His225 is the catalytic residue of the motif, becoming phosphorylated through the covalent attachment of the \u03b3P released during attack on the \u03b3-\u03b2 phosphoanhydride bond of the NTP. 21 In contrast, the catalytic histidine of HIT proteins traditionally undergoes nucleotidylation by way of an \u03b1P linkage formed during attack of the \u03b2-\u03b1 phosphoanhydride bond of the nucleotide substrate. 20 Extending diagonally across the NSP2 octamer surface are four highly basic grooves, 30 \u00c5 wide and 25 \u00c5 deep, that function as ssRNA-binding sites. 14, 22 Each groove is lined by two 24-residue electropositive loops, originating between the two subdomains of the N terminus of each monomer ( Figure  1 ). The location of these loops is such that they position the electropositive residues at the entrance of the catalytic clefts containing the HIT-like motif. Due to the close proximity of the grooves and clefts, binding of ssRNA in a groove may impact the passage of NTPs into or out of the cleft and, therefore, may influence the NTPase activity of the octamer.

To examine this possibility further, we performed competition experiments that measured how the addition of GTP, GDP, or GMP to reaction mixtures containing wtNSP2 and [\u03b3-32 P]5\u2032 g8 RNA affected RTPase activity. The results showed that at high molar ratios of GTP to the RNA substrate, GTP successfully inhibited RTPase activity in a concentration dependent manner ( Figure 6 ). The fact that a 50% reduction in 32 P i formation required a ratio of RNA to GTP of 1:2500-3000 may reflect, in part, the higher affinity of NSP2 for the RNA substrate of its RTPase activity as compared to the affinity of NSP2 for the NTP substrate of its NTPase activity. Competition assays performed with GDP showed that this nucleotide was approximately one-third as effective in reducing 32 P i formation as GTP, producing a 50% reduction in RTPase activity at a ratio of RNA to GDP of \u223c1:6000. In contrast to GTP and GDP, GMP had little or no effect on the RTPase activity even at very high concentrations. These results indicate that GTP, and to a lesser extent GDP, compete with ssRNA as substrates for hydrolysis, supporting the concept that a common active site directs both the RTPase and NTPase activities of NSP2. The fact that a high concentration of nucleotide relative to RNA is required to reduce RTPase levels supports the concept that RNA is the preferred substrate of NSP2.",

This structural arrangement raises the possibility that binding of RNA to the groove, enhances the RTPase activity of the octamer by recruiting the substrate for the reaction to a position near the catalytic site. In order to test this possibility, two mutant species of the NSP2 octamer were prepared, in which either three (mt3Q (Lys59, Arg60, Arg68)) or six (mt6Q (Lys37, Lys38, Lys58, Lys59, Arg60, Arg68)) conserved and solventexposed electropositive residues along the grooves and proximal to the catalytic clefts were replaced with glutamine, a polar non-charged amino acid (Figures 1(d) and 7(a)).

Among the most favored energetic positions (lowest energy) were those suggesting the insertion of the 5\u2032 end of the RNA deep within the cleft, with its 5\u2032-terminal triphosphate group situated in the active site. The remainder of the RNA was oriented such that its 3\u2032 end extended from the cleft. One representative position was selected and subjected for molecular dynamics simulation using CHARMM to define possible interactions formed between the protein and the ligand. The results suggested that several electropositive residues in the RNA-binding loop interacted with the 5-mer RNA, including residues shown above to be important in the RNAbinding and RTPase activities of NSP2 ( Figure  8(a) ). Analysis of the RNA-protein complexes after simulation indicated a web of interactions (mainly hydrogen bonds) between Lys59, Arg60, and Arg68 and the oxygen moieties present at positions three and four of the RNA molecule backbone (third and fourth nucleoside) ( Figure  8(b) ). The simulation also indicated that Lys37 interacted with the fifth position of the RNA (last nucleoside). The simulation failed to suggest any interaction between Lys38 and Lys58 and the RNA.

Immunofluorescence analysis of these cells using NSP2 and NSP5-specific antisera revealed that the charge-deletion mutations in mtQ3 had only a partial effect on the ability of the protein to support the formation of VLSs ( Figure 10 ). In particular, while mt3Q supported VLS formation, these inclusions were generally smaller than those formed with wtNSP2, and there was a conspicuous increase in the amount of NSP2 and NSP5 distributed throughout the cytosol, that failed to localize to viroplasms. In contrast, the mutations in mtQ6 prevented this protein from supporting the formation of VLSs. Instead of localizing to inclusions, mtQ6 and NSP5 were distributed throughout the cytosol in a manner that was only partially overlapping, with mt6Q having a somewhat granular appearance. Thus, in addition to the importance of the electropositive residues adjacent to the groove in the RTPase and RNA-binding activities of NSP2, these residues have critical function in the formation of viroplasms. Most likely, the charge-deletion mutations of mt3Q and mt6Q altered the surface charge of NSP2 in such a way that the protein could no longer interact appropriately with NSP5 to support viroplasm formation. Alternatively, the charge-deletion mutations prevented NSP2 from binding RNA, and therefore prevented the RNAmediated bridging of NSP2 and NSP5 that may have a role in viroplasm formation. The failure of viroplasms to form with the mt3Q and mt6Q species is not due to their failure to efficiently hydrolyze the \u03b3-\u03b2 phosphoanhydride bond of RNA, since previous studies showed that the NTPase and RTPase-defective mutant H225A supported the formation of viroplasms as efficiently as wtNSP2. 18",

The results of a recent study suggest that the default (RNA-free) function of the NSP2 octamer may be to act as an independent NTP generation system in the viroplasm, whereby the NTPase activity of the protein produces the P i required by its associated kinase activity to recycle spent NDPs back to NTPs. 21 In the presence of RNA substrate, the low K m value of its RTPase activity could be anticipated to induce NSP2 to switch from such an NTPase/NDP kinase function to an alternative function more directly linked to RNA replication, translocation, or packaging.",

RTPase defective NSP2 mutants are deficient in the formation of VLS in transfected mammalian cells. MA104 cells were transfected with pCI vectors encoding wt or mt forms of NSP2 and/or NSP5. Localization of proteins was detected using NSP2 and NSP5 specific antisera in combination with fluorescent dye labeled secondary antibodies. Alexa 488 (green) and Alexa 594 (red) were used to detect NSP2 and NSP5, respectively. Nuclei were visualized by staining with DAPI. Immunostained cells were analyzed by confocal laser scanning microscopy. Co-localization of the proteins is observed by yellow color in the superimposed images (right panel). of a \u03b3P on this residue raises the possibility that during replication, NSP2 uses nascent (\u2212)-strand RNAs as substrates for its RTPase activity. Indeed, earlier studies have indicated that NSP2 is a component of viral replication intermediates, interacts with the RdRP VP1, and is bound to partially replicated RNA, features that are consistent with the direct participation of NSP2 in (\u2212)-strand synthesis. 5, [11] [12] [13] One possibility is that soon after (\u2212)-strand initiation, the nascent RNA product interacts with NSP2 in such a way that its 5\u2032 end enters into one of the clefts of an octamer, where it engages the active site. This interaction may anchor the nascent (\u2212) strand as the RdRP carries out elongation. As the RdRP nears completion of the (\u2212) strand, the affinity of the RdRP and NSP2 for each other, combined with the interaction of NSP2 with the 5\u2032 end of the (\u2212) strand, and the interaction of the RdRP with the 3\u2032 end of the (\u2212) strand may generate a complex in which the dsRNA product is circularized. Interestingly, the high efficiency of transcription by DLPs has led to the suggestion that the dsRNAs are circularized within the capsid, an organization allowing the polymerase to move expeditiously from the 5\u2032 to the 3\u2032 end of the (\u2212)-strand template following rounds of (+)-strand synthesis. 25, 26 The NSP2-RdRP -mediated bridging of the ends of the dsRNA product may be responsible for initially establishing the circularized form of the genome segments.",

            "text": "Through its affinity for ssRNA, NSP2 can be expected to form complexes with the (+)-strand RNAs that accumulate in viroplasms. Despite such interactions, our in vitro assays indicate that NSP2 cannot use methylated capped (+)-strand RNAs as substrates for hydrolysis. Interestingly, one of the well-characterized HIT-family proteins, DcpS, possesses a 7-methyl guanosine specific hydrolase activity that is responsible for mRNA decapping during exosome-mediated decay. 27 The failure of NSP2 to utilize a methylated capped RNA as a substrate for hydrolysis despite sharing a HIT-like motif and a HIT-like fold similar to those of DcpS, may have multiple explanations. Perhaps most importantly is the observation that in the HIT site of DcpS, side-chain interactions are established that mediate the specific recognition of methylated guanosine residue of the cap structure, and as consequence, the engagement of the phosphate residues of the cap structure with the catalytic residues of the active site. 28 It should also be noted that DcpS, like other HIT proteins, exists as an asymmetric dimer when bound to a cap, a conformation that leaves its catalytic cleft in a structurally open and solvent accessible form. 28 In contrast, NSP2 is an octamer with a 4-2-2 symmetry, in which substrate binding and hydrolysis occur within the deep clefts that divide each monomer. In contrast to the openness of the HIT site of DcpS, the constrained accessibility and rigidity of the deep clefts in the NSP2 octamer may restrict capped RNAs from gaining entry to the HIT site. It is also possible that the NSP2 cleft may not have appropriate dimensions to spatially accommodate the inverted guanosine of the cap in such a way that the triphosphate linkage can engage the catalytic residues needed for nucleophilic attack. The lack of a common substrate between proteins in the large HIT superfamily despite shared catalytic HIT motif and a C-terminal HIT fold in their structures has been reported. 20 Interestingly, NSP2 is the only rotavirus protein known to have an RTPase activity, an observation that could be interpreted to mean that NSP2 participates in the capping process by removing the \u03b3P from RNA prior to guanylylation. However, this possibility can be excluded, since NSP2 is not a component of the transcriptionally active DLPs that produce the m7 GpppG-capped (+)-strand RNAs. 29 More likely, the capping-related RTPase activity is provided by VP3, a protein within DLPs shown previously to have guanylyltransferase and methyltransferase-like activities. 30, 31 In cell-free replication assays, where VP1 can carry out (\u2212)-strand initiation and elongation, the \u03b3P is not removed from the (+)-strand template, indicating that the rotavirus RdRP lacks RTPase activity and that there is not a direct need for an RTPase activity in the polymerization of the (\u2212)-strand. 32 Transient expression of NSP2 and NSP5 leads to the formation of inclusion bodies that are similar to those that form in rotavirus-infected cells. 8 In our analysis, we found that the formation of such VLSs was abrogated when NSP2 was replaced with the glutamine charge-deletion mutant mtQ6. Although mtQ6 is defective in RTPase activity, and to a lesser extent in NTPase activity, it is unlikely that these deficiencies contributed to the defect in VLSs formation, given the results of an earlier study showing that the catalytically inactive NSP2 mutant H225A supported inclusion formation. 18 Instead, it is more likely that mtQ6 failed to support VLSs formation because of the loss of critical electropositive charges needed to support its stable interaction with the acidic protein NSP5 or with ssRNA, or a combination of the two. Because NSP2 and NSP5 both have affinity for ssRNA, 13, 47 mutations that reduce the RNA-binding activity of NSP2 may also interfere with viroplasm formation by preventing effective RNA-mediated bridging of NSP2 and NSP5.",

            "text": "Cellular and viral RTPases can be divided into two groups based on their catalytic requirement for a divalent cation. Metal-dependent RTPases have been described for metazoan DNA viruses (e.g. Poxvirus, Chlorella virus), fungi, and protozoan parasites. 33, 34 These RTPases are known to remove the \u03b3P from not only RNAs, but also NTPs, via hydrolysis reactions taking place at a common active site. The X-ray structure of the Sacharomyces cerevisiae Cet 1 RTPase suggests that the active site of the fungal and Chlorella virus enzymes is contained in an open hydrophilic tunnel formed by eight antiparallel \u03b2-strands, in which two conserved glutamates residues are critical for hydrolysis of the \u03b3-\u03b2 phosphate bond. 34, 35 Metal-independent RTPases have been identified in mammals and other metazoan organisms. Characteristically, these RTPases undergo phosphorylation during the hydrolysis reaction due to the transfer of the \u03b3P to a residue at the active site (e.g. phosphotyrosine). These RTPases are usually incapable of using NTPs as substrates. 36 The recently solved structures of mouse Mce1 and Baculovirus BVP RTPases suggests the existence of another class of RTPases, wherein the active site is located at the bottom of a deep positively charged pocket containing a conserved cysteine residue that acts as the catalytic amino acid. 37, 38 Several other enzymes with dual RTPase and NTPase activities have been identified, including some belonging to RNA virus families (e.g. NS3 of dengue virus, NS13 of coronavirus, Nsp2 of alphavirus). [39] [40] [41] [42] The relationship of these dual functioning enzymes, if any, to previously described RTPases is uncertain, in part due to the lack of sufficient biochemical and structural information.",

Other viruses belonging to the Reoviridae family encode non-structural proteins with characteristics similar to that of NSP2, including the well-studied NS2 protein of bluetongue virus (BTV) and \u03c3NS protein of orthoreovirus. 43 Like the NSP2 protein, NS2 and \u03c3NS self-assemble into homomultimeric complexes with associated ssRNA-binding and helix-unwinding activities and are components of viral replication intermediates. [43] [44] [45] Furthermore, both NS2 and \u03c3NS participate in viroplasm formation in BTV-and reovirusinfected cells, respectively. In contrast to the RTPase/NTPase activity of rotavirus NSP2, BTV NS2 has an associated phosphatase activity, allowing it to remove all three phosphates from an NTP. Unlike NSP2 and NS2, \u03c3NS has no known enzymatic activity. However, during assembly of viroplasms in reovirus-infected cells, \u03c3NS interacts with \u03bc2, a non-structural protein with RTPase/ NTPase activity. 46 Thus, a common feature of Reoviridae viroplasms appears to be the presence of non-structural proteins with catalytic activity capable of hydrolyzing phosphate groups from NTPs, and in at least some cases, from the 5\u2032 end of ssRNAs. Despite their related activity, only rotavirus NSP2 is known to contain a HIT-like fold and motif, and hence its mechanism of hydrolytic attack can be expected to unlike that of NS2 and \u03c3NS.",
