PRCV, a spike (S) gene deletion mutant of TGEV with an altered respiratory tissue tropism, causes mild or subclinical respiratory infections. Comparisons of TGEV and PRCV strains suggest that tropism and pathogenicity are influenced by the S gene and ORF3, respectively. Recently, outbreaks of TGE of reduced virulence were reported in the field. We investigated a similar suspect TGEV outbreak of reduced virulence in nursery pigs from a swine herd in the Midwest. A TGEV strain (BW021898B) was isolated in swine testicular cells from gut contents of a diarrheic pig and three PRCV strains (BW126, BW154, BW155) were isolated from nasal swabs from normal TGEV-seronegative sentinel pigs in contact with the diarrheic pigs. Sequence analysis of the TGEV isolate in the partial S gene and ORF3/3a and ORF3-1/3b revealed high homology with enteropathogenic TGEV strains. Gnotobiotic pig inoculation and histopathological results revealed that this TGEV isolate retained virulence even though in the field outbreak the diarrheal disease was of reduced severity. Sequence analysis of the S gene deletion region of the three PRCV isolates revealed identical deletions between nt 105-752, which differ from deletions previously reported among PRCV strains. The three PRCV isolates had variable sequence changes in ORF 3/3a and ORF 3-1/3b, affecting the ORF size and amino acid sequence. Thus, sequence analysis and pathogenicity studies indicate that this TGEV isolate resembles other enteropathogenic TGEV strains. Therefore, the reduced severity of TGE observed in this herd may be due to the ongoing PRCV infections, which induce antibodies",

The porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV) is a deletion mutant of TGEV with altered respiratory tissue tropism [13, 20] . TGEV replicates primarily in small intestinal enterocytes and to a lesser extent in the respiratory tract [20] . PRCV replicates almost exclusively in the respiratory tract [13] . These viruses have 3 major structural proteins: the spike (S), the integral membrane (M) glycoprotein, and the nucleocapsid (N) protein [13, 24] . TGEV and PRCV strains produce 7-8 subgenomic mRNAs during viral replication and each mRNA consists of 3 co-terminal nested sets [13, 26] . The S, M and N proteins are translated from mRNAs 2, 5 and 6, respectively. The mRNA 3, 3-1 (designated for Miller strain of TGEV) or mRNA 3a, 3b (designated for Purdue-115, FS722 strains of TGEV) encode two putative nonstructural proteins [13, 26] .",

The deletions in the PRCV S gene and ORF 3a region differ slightly between the European and US PRCV isolates [16, 26] . Some investigators have suggested that mutations or deletions in ORF 3a play a role in the reduced ability of PRCV to multiply in the intestine [18] . The consensus recognition sequences CTAAAC exist upstream of each open reading frame [13, 26] . In PRCV, this sequence upstream of ORF 3/3a gene is partially deleted or altered [22, 26] . The S protein has a membrane anchoring domain, is highly glycosylated and is thought to be the viral attachment protein which interacts with the cell receptor, porcine aminopeptidase N (APN) [11, 22] . The S protein of TGEV has four major antigenic sites, with site A being the major inducer of neutralizing antibodies [21] . Site A has been found to be highly conserved among TGEV and PRCV strains [7] . Because most viral neutralization (VN) antibodies are directed to antigenic site A, VN or most conventional serologic assays fail to differentiate between pigs infected with PRCV or TGEV. The deletion size in the S gene of PRCV ranges from 621-681 nt depending on the strain [13, 21, 26] and due to this deletion, there is a loss of one to two antigenic sites (C and B, or D) depending on the nomenclature [11, 21] . Loss of this antigenic site(s) is the basis for a differential blocking ELISA test to serologically differentiate between pigs infected with PRCV or TGEV [23] .",

Point mutations in certain regions (amino acids 145-155) of the S gene may lead to loss of sialic acid binding activity affecting hemag-glutination (HA) [11, 22] . These mutations/recombinations may affect viral tissue tropism and virulence of strains [1] . Studies have suggested that amino acid changes at the N-terminal region of the TGEV S protein are important for TGEV enteric tropism [1, 2] . Alterations in an S gene region (around nucleotide number 655) were reported to affect the enteric tropism of the PUR46 strain of TGEV [1] . The ORF 3/3a and ORF 3-1/3b genes of virulent TGEV remain intact with only a few amino acid changes, but there is variability among the same genes of PRCV [13, 26, 27] . The size and location of deletions in these PRCV genes varied depending on the strain [26] . It has also been hypothesized that ORF 3/3a and ORF3-1/3b may be related to viral virulence and pathogenesis [18, 26, 27] , but a recent study described a virulent strain of TGEV which has a large deletion in the ORF 3a gene [14] .",

As a control, an uninfected pig was also included in this study. Clinical parameters including diarrhea and fecal scores (0 = normal, 1 = pasty, 2 = semiliquid, 3 = liquid) were recorded. Rectal and nasal viral shedding were assayed by CCIF and RT-PCR/nested PCR (Kim L. et al., unpubl.) from days post inoculation (DPI) 1 to 4. Pigs were euthanized at the onset of diarrhea or at 7 DPI. Sections of duodenum, jejunum, ileum and lung were collected for immunofluorescence assay (IFA). Impression smears were made on glass microscope slides, air dried and fixed in acetone [3] . For histopathology studies, tissues were processed in Prefer fixative solution (Anatech LTD, Battle Creek, MI), embedded in paraffin, sectioned at 5 m and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (HE), before examining microscopically [3] . At least seven villi and crypts of each intestinal tissue were observed. Villous atrophy was scored for each villous section, and assigned a value as follows: 0 = normal, 2 = moderate, 3 = marked, 4 = severe. Villous: crypt ratios were determined by measuring the heights of the villi, the lengths of adjacent crypts and then calculating the ratios.",

The sequences for comparison were obtained from GenBank or previously published reports. TGEV: virulent CHV [26] and PRCV: AR310, IA1894 and ISU-1 [26] . Antigenic sites: Paris [13] and Madrid [21] Fig . 4 . Deduced amino acid sequences of the ORF3/3a gene of TGEV isolate BW021898B and PRCV isolates BW126, BW154, BW155 from the midwestern swine herd were compared to the published TGEV: virulent CHV [26] and Purdue and PRCV: AR310 and IA1894 [26] . PRCV isolates BW126, BW154 and BW155 had identical amino acid sequences in this region. The nucleotide sequence data of the TGEV isolate BW021898B and PRCV isolates BW126, BW154, BW155 reported in this paper have been submitted to the Gen-Bank nucleotide sequence database. The accession numbers are: AF179886 (BW021898B); AF179887 (BW126); AF179888 (BW154); and AF179889 (BW155) and TGEV field isolates had higher homology to each other outside the deletion area than to the sequences for other TGEV and PRCV strains (Fig. 3) . The three PRCV isolates had the same 90 nucleotide deletion including the leader sequence binding site (CTAAAC), with conservation of the ATG initiation codon in the ORF 3/3a (Fig. 4) . The three PRCV isolates had identical 180 nucleotides in the ORF3/3a gene with 13 nt deletions. These deletions changed the amino acid sequence and the size of the ORF3/3a gene causing a frameshift with an early stop codon (Fig. 4) . Because of this frameshift, aa residues 51 to 60 of all three PRCV strains were different from previously published PRCV strains and the TGEV strain, BW021898B (from the same herd) (Fig. 4) . The three PRCV isolates had 3 nucleotide deletions upstream of ORF3-1/3b, but had intact leader sequence binding sites (CTAAAC) (data not shown). The three PRCV isolates had variable nucleotide deletions in ORF3-1/3b and these deletions influenced amino acid changes and ORF sizes in this gene area. The PRCV strain, BW126, had a 4 nucleotide deletion and 178 amino acid residues in ORF 3-1/3b (Figs. 2, 5). The PRCV strain, BW154, had 249 amino acids residues in ORF 3-1/3b and a 15 nucleotide insertion at the end of this gene (Figs. 2, 5 ). Because of a 37 nucleotide deletion in ORF 3-1/3b, which resulted in an early stop codon, the ORF 3-1/3b of BW155 retained only 52 amino acids (Figs. 2, 5) . Using the IFA with monoclonal antibodies 25C9 and 44C11 against antigenic sites A and D [23] , respectively, BW021898B, BW126, BW154, BW155 had positive reactions with 25C9, but only BW021898B had a positive reaction using the differential monoclonal antibody (site D), 44C11.",

Using nested PCR, virus was detected from nasal swab samples from DPI 1-4, but CCIF and RT-PCR failed to detect viral shedding from nasal swab samples. The highest TGEV titers determined by CCIF in small and large intestinal contents were at 30 hour post-inoculation of gnotobiotic pig 4-10 and were 2.4\u00d710 10 FFU/ml and 5.2\u00d710 8 FFU/ml, respectively ( Table 1 ). The IFA results for mucosal smears are summarized in Table 1 . Segments of the duodenum, jejunum and ileum from infected animals or the control were sectioned and histopathological lesions were recorded and summarized (Table 1) . Severe villous atrophy was noted in the jejunum and lesions characteristic of virulent TGEV were observed (Table 1) . For the normal control piglet and the TGEV infected piglets, the villi-crypt ratios were also computed as summarized in Table 1 . There were no gross or macroscopic lesions in the lungs or any respiratory signs with the BW021898B TGEV strain (data not shown). IFA smear results on the lungs were negative.",

            "text": "TGEV is a major cause of neonatal diarrhea in swine and also causes enzootic diarrhea in older pigs. Recently in the UK, isolated sporadic outbreaks of TGE in herds seropositive for PRCV antibodies were reported [19] . Unlike classical TGE, there was no evidence for high piglet mortality or disease spread to neighboring farms, even though the seroprevalence of TGEV antibodies in area herds was low (7.1%). In addition weaned pigs that shed TGEV antigen in feces detected by ELISA had \"non-specific looseness\" resembling mild epidemic TGE: other swine had subclinical infections evident only by seroconversion to TGEV by differential ELISA. Unfortunately no TGEV isolates from these herds were available for study, but the investigators speculated that variant forms of TGEV or PRCV might be circulating in these infected herds. Similarly, atypical TGEV infections characterized by lower virulence and less rapid spread occurred recently in large nurseries in the midwestern U.S. in which some animals tested positive for antibodies to PRCV. Although such TGEV infections may be moderated by the presence of PRCV antibodies, it is conceivable that PRCV antibodies may also exert selective pressure for naturally-occurring variants of TGEV or for recombinants between TGEV and PRCV strains coinfecting the same pig. Such variants or recombinants may possess an intestinal tropism, but may be of reduced virulence. In this study we obtained field TGEV/PRCV specimens from a herd with a suspect TGEV infection of reduced disease severity and characterized these strains by cell culture adaptation, sequence analysis, antigen-based assays and histopathology. Our overall goal was to clarify if these field strains represented TGEV variants or natural recombinants between TGEV and PRCV strains or if the severity of diarrheal disease was reduced due to cross-reacting antibodies to TGEV from prior PRCV infections. We were also interested to see if these PRCV strains isolated from a single herd were identical or similar to one another and how related they were to TGEV isolates from the same herd. This type of information about the molecular epidemiology of naturally occurring TGEV/PRCV strains and their variability in disease severity is very important for understanding mechanisms of disease and the molecular identity of field strains.",

            "text": "We isolated a TGEV strain, BW021898B from the large intestinal contents of a diarrheic pig and three PRCV strains, BW126, BW154, BW155 from nasal swabs of clinically normal TGEV-seronegative sentinel nursery pigs placed in contact with the diarrheic pigs. We hypothesized that natural PRCV/TGEV recombinants or point mutations in TGEV (TGEV variants) may have been the cause of the reduced severity of diarrhea noted among pigs from the midwestern herd. We focused on analysis of the amino-terminal portion of the S gene and the entire ORF 3 gene because both tropism and virulence differences among TGEV and PRCV strains have been attributed to deletions in these two genes [1, 13, 14, 18, 26] . All PRCV strains sequenced to date have 621-681 nt deletions within the amino-terminal S gene resulting in loss of hemagglutination activity [11] and 2 antigenic sites [7, 13, 21] including site D recognized by our Mab 44C11 [23] . In contrast enteric TGEV strains have intact S genes. Generally, virulent TGEV strains have intact ORF 3 genes, but attenuated TGEV strains have deletions or insertions that alter ORF 3 [13, 18, 26] . Similarly, virulent PRCV strains have an intact ORF 3a gene, whereas non-pathogenic PRCV strains have altered ORF 3 genes that render the gene or gene product non-functional [13, 18, 26] . Recently however, McGoldrick et al. [14] characterized a virulent TGEV strain (96-1033) with a major deletion in ORF 3a and suggested that ORF 3a may not be essential for enteric virulence. However, this deletion reduced the ability of the TGEV strain to grow in cell culture. Thus studies with a plaque-purified or cloned TGEV isolate were not possible to exclude the possibility of other virulent TGEVs in their original sample [14] . Similarly, Ballestros et al. [1] showed that changes in 2 amino acids in the amino-terminal portion of the S protein resulted in the loss of the enteric tropism of TGEV without changes downstream of the S protein. Therefore, the role of ORF 3/3a and ORF 3-1/3b in viral replication and pathogenesis remains unclear.",

Our findings suggest that the mild diarrhea associated with TGEV in these nurseries is not related to attenuation of this TGEV strain because of point mutations or deletions in the partial S gene or to deletions in the ORF 3, but may be due to the partial crossprotective immunity induced in these pigs by PRCV which moderates the disease severity [25] and may influence the transmission of TGEV strains co-circulating in such herds.",

The three PRCV isolates also had greater sequence homology in the partial S gene area with the BW021898B strain compared to other TGEV strains suggesting that these PRCV strains may have co-evolved with the BW021898B strain. The three PRCV strains retained ORF 3a but had a complete deletion of the leader sequence binding site and had variable deletions in ORF 3b, that may make the mRNAs undetectable or nonfunctional. All three PRCV strains were readily adapted to ST cells, suggesting that intact ORF 3 genes are not essential for viral growth in cell culture. However, additional sequence from the entire genome and from other strains from this herd should be analyzed to further confirm these observations.",

Findings from studies such as ones described here improve our understanding of changes in the molecular epidemiology of PRCV/TGEV infections under natural conditions and should be useful for the design of more efficacious vaccines.",
