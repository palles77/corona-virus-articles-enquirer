            "text": "An immunochromatographic test strip (ICTS) for detecting antibodies to rabies virus was developed, using colloidal gold particles labeled with rabies virus glycoprotein as the tracer. The assay was evaluated using sera from dogs immunized with various commercial rabies vaccines, or from dogs in the clinics and sera from dogs immunized with vaccines against pathogens other than rabies virus, and negative sera from a wide variety of animal sources, including dogs, mice, and cats which had never been vaccinated. The ICTS was found to be highly specific for antibodies against rabies virus, with a detection limit of 0.5 IU/ml as measured by the fluorescent antibody virus neutralization (FAVN) test. Compared with the FAVN test, the specificity and sensitivity of ICTS were 98.2% and 90.4%, respectively. There was an excellent agreement between results obtained by the ICTS and FAVN tests (kappa = 0.888). Strips stored at 4 \u2022 C in a plastic bag with a desiccant retained their specificity and sensitivity for at least 15 months, and strips stored at ambient temperature remained stable for 12 months. The immunochromatographic test strip may therefore be useful for clinical laboratories lacking specialized equipment and for diagnosis in the field for rapid detection of rabies virus-specific antibodies.",

            "text": "The measurement of seroneutralizing antibodies has been used commonly for many years to assess the level of immunity to rabies (Aubert, 1992; Cliquet et al., 1998) and a virus-neutralizing antibody titer of 0.5 IU/ml in sera is the threshold of seroconversion to rabies vaccination as recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO). Detection and quantitation of antibodies against rabies virus (RABV) are also of prime importance for assessing the efficacy of rabies vaccination campaigns. The rapid fluorescent focus inhibition test (RFFIT) (Smith et al., 1973) and the fluorescent antibody virus neutralization (FAVN) test (Cliquet et al., 1998) are the only in vitro methods recommended by the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) for measuring virus neutralizing antibodies. However, such assays require a considerable level of expertise and are generally undertaken only in reference laboratories with suitable biocontainment facilities. In addition, the procedures are time-consuming, and only a limited number of samples can be processed at one time. They are therefore inefficient and expensive for human and animal clinics in developing countries without trained personnel. The challenges in the 21st century for diagnostic test developers are two-fold: first, to achieve internationally accepted validation of a test; and second, to overcome financial and logistical barriers that prevent implementation of a test in the developing countries with the greatest need (Fooks et al., 2009) . A more convenient and affordable diagnostic test for antibodies against rabies virus should be developed in countries where rabies is endemic and where resources are limited.",

Although this method has only been used for qualitative analysis so far, it provides rapid detection of antigens and antibodies, and thus possesses advantages over the conventional immunoassays, such as low cost, inexpensive equipment, simplicity of procedure, rapid operation, and long-term stability over a wide range of environmental conditions. These characteristics render a test ideally suited for on-site testing by untrained personnel (Peng et al., 2007) .

MNA cells were infected with CVS-11 at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.1, and incubated at 32 \u2022 C for 4 d. Culture fluid was collected, cells were removed by centrifugation (1500 \u00d7 g, 20 min, 4 \u2022 C), and the virus was pelleted by ultracentrifugation at 45,000 \u00d7 g for 2 h at 4 \u2022 C. Pellets were resuspended in PBS and left overnight at 4 \u2022 C. Betapropiolactone (BPL, Sigma, Inc.) was added to the virus solution to a final BPL dilution of 1:3000. Incubation continued overnight at 4 \u2022 C, followed by 2 h at 37 \u2022 C to permit complete hydrolysis of the remaining BPL. Inactivated virus was then layered over a sucrose gradient and pelleted by ultracentrifugation (61,000 \u00d7 g, 90 min, 4 \u2022 C). The pelleted virus was resuspended in Tris-buffered saline containing EDTA (0.13 M NaCl/0.05 M Tris, pH 7.2/0.001 M EDTA). The glycoprotein was dissociated from the virus by incubation (1 h, 24 \u2022 C) with 1% Triton X-100 in Tris-buffered saline. The soluble G protein fraction was separated from the residual suspension by sedimentation of the latter into a 25% sucrose cushion (55,000 \u00d7 g, 160 min) and was collected by aspiration of the layer just above the cushion. After dialysis against a phosphate buffer (PB, 20 mM pH 7.2), Sephadex G-50 (GE Healthcare, UK) filtration was used to remove excess ampholine. Then the G protein was dialyzed extensively against phosphate buffer (PB, 20 mM pH 7.2) and stored in aliquots at \u221280 \u2022 C until used. Protein concentration was determined using a BCA kit (Pierce, Inc., Rockford, IL).",

Rabies virus glycoprotein is the only structural protein of the virus that induces the formation of virus-neutralizing antibodies, which confer immunity to animals. The protective activity was shown to be associated only with the G protein and not with the membrane associated protein M and P, although they contain residual traces of G protein (Cox et al., 1977) . Competitive ELISA that utilizes a cell line stably expressing the rabies virus G protein as the coating antigen has higher specificity and sensitivity than that of ELISA based on whole rabies virus antigen (Bahloul et al., 2005; Servat and Cliquet, 2006) . Also, there is an excellent agreement between the FAVN test and competitive ELISA. In the study presented here, the virus was cultured at 32 \u2022 C for 4 d, and this was sufficient to obtain more G protein than virus grown at 37 \u2022 C. In order to reduce the false-positive results, sucrose gradient centrifugation was used to purify the virus. Subsequently the G protein was dissociated from the purified virus by incubation with Triton X-100, which could have a higher biological and protective activity than that solubilized by deoxycholate or by Nonidet P-40 (Cox et al., 1977) . The sensitivity and specificity of ICTS in this study did not produce any difference between serum samples derived from dogs vaccinated with inactivated Pasteur virus (PV) strain, inactivated Evelyn-Rokitnicki-Abelseth (ERA) strain, Flury-LEP vaccines and commercial vaccines (Intervet Nobivac) (Table 1) , and there was also an excellent correlation with the FAVN test. This might be attributed to using the same strain of RABV (CVS-11) as an antigen in both of the ICTS and FAVN test.",

In this study, SPA was immobilized on the membrane and used as the test line, and it showed high affinity to serum samples from dogs.

Those methods are simple and rapid for clinical use. However, they are still not suitable for use outside the research laboratory because of the requirement of special equipment such as a microplate reader or incubator. A RAPId Neutralizing Antibody (RAPINA) test has been described for quantitatively measuring neutralizing antibody against rabies virus (Shiota et al., 2009) . In this method, serum is incubated with inactivated rabies virus, and then used for a RABV G detection kit based on the principle of immunochromatography as described previously (Nishizono et al., 2008) . In comparison with ELISAs, the RAPINA has an advantage of convenience, safety and rapidity. No special equipment, cultured cells, live virus, or trained operators are needed, and the results are easy to read. Sera with virus neutralizing antibody titers \u2265 0.5 IU/ml could neutralize the rabies virus and would not produce a test line; however, sera with titers < 0.5 IU/ml would not inhibit the band formation on the test line when detected by the RABV G detection kit. In the ICTS, 50 l serum sample was applied to the test, two red-purple lines on the membrane indicate that the serum sample possesses a virus neutralizing antibody titer \u2265 0.5 IU/ml. If only one line appears at the control location, the serum sample is negative for rabies virus or has a virus neutralizing antibody titer < 0.5 IU/ml. Also, the stronger the test line appears, the more virus specific antibodies are present in the sample. It should be pointed out that one disadvantage of ICTS is that the intensity of the test lines could reach to a plateau when test the serum samples with titers higher than 8.0 IU/ml. This is because the amounts of colloidal gold-RABV G dispensed onto the fiberglass and Staphylococcal protein A immobilized on the membrane are constant, and even though more virus neutralizing antibodies are present in the sample, the colloidal gold-RABV G-RABV antibody complex trapped by the Staphylococcal protein A immobilized at the test line is limited, so the color cannot become stronger. In this case, the serum sample should be diluted further.",
