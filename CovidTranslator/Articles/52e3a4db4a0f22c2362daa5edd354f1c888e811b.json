Mammalian 2-Cys peroxiredoxins have been shown to eliminate efficiently the H 2 O 2 generated in response to receptor stimulation. 2-Cys peroxiredoxins are members of a novel peroxidase family that catalyze the H 2 O 2 reduction reaction in the presence of thioredoxin, thioredoxin reductase and NADPH. Several lines of evidence suggest that 2-Cys peroxiredoxins have dual roles as regulators of the H 2 O 2 signal and as defenders of oxidative stress. In particular, 2-Cys peroxiredoxin appears to provide selective, specific and localized control of receptor-mediated signal transduction. Thus, the therapeutic potential of 2-Cys peroxiredoxins is clear for diseases, such as cancer and cardiovascular diseases, that involve reactive oxygen species.",

The discovery of these facts led to a change in the general concept of the role of H 2 O 2 , from a cytotoxic reactive oxygen species (ROS; Box 1) variant to a signaling messenger. Since then, several studies have shown that the intracellular H 2 O 2 can be generated via the stimulation of a variety of growth factors, cytokines and G-protein-coupled receptors [3, 4] . Thus, it is now generally accepted that membrane receptor-dependent signaling is accompanied by transient and intracellular H 2 O 2 production. Yet there is no quantitative measurement method that gives an accurate concentration of intracellular H 2 O 2 . It is therefore difficult to resolve whether the cell is being subjected to H 2 O 2 -dependent signaling or to oxidative stress (Box 1).",

            "text": "Mammals have a diverse set of peroxidases that collectively function to reduce H 2 O 2 to water. There are three classes of peroxidases: catalase, glutathione peroxidases (GPxs) and peroxiredoxins (Prxs). Catalase is a heme-containing H 2 O 2 dismutase, exclusively localized in the peroxisome, a subcellular organelle devoted to oxidizing organic substances, and catalase is believed either to remove H 2 O 2 that passively diffuses into the organelle or to prevent H 2 O 2 leakage [5] . Five GPx isoforms are distinguishable by their tissue and subcellular distribution and substrate specificity [6] [7] [8] . Among them, GPx1, also called cGPx, is the only cytosolic enzyme that reduces H 2 O 2 by utilizing the electrons donated by NADPH via the glutathione-glutathione reductase system. GPx1 is a selenoprotein that is produced at low levels and is dispensable in unstressed animals [6] . 2-Cys Prxs represent a new type of peroxidase, because they are coupled with thioredoxin and thioredoxin reductase, forming an electron-conveying system [9] . Thioredoxin reductase transfers electrons from NADPH to thioredoxin, which in turn reduces a disulfide linkage formed during the peroxidase reaction in 2-Cys Prxs. Thus far, five 2-Cys Prx isoforms have been recognized in mammals. On the basis of the peptide regions that harbor a conserved cysteine residue, they can be classified into typical and atypical 2-Cys Prxs (Figure 1 ) [10] .",

            "text": "Distinct from catalase and glutathione peroxidase, the 2-Cys Prxs have several interesting molecular features. Firstly, their peroxidase activity relies exclusively on a cysteine residue in the N-terminal region. Secondly, they are fairly abundant proteins, present in an approximate range of 100 nanograms to a few micrograms per milligram of cellular protein [11] . Thirdly, they are distributed broadly in intracellular compartments: they are present in the cytosol, mitochondria, peroxisome, endoplasmic reticulum and, more importantly in the plasma membrane [10] . Fourthly, members of the 2-Cys Prx subgroup have a high degree of affinity for H 2 O 2 ; that is, the H 2 O 2 concentration to achieve half maximal activity is !20 mM in the presence of thioredoxin and thioredoxin reductase [11] . It is believed that the receptor stimulation triggers the generation of H 2 O 2 intracellularly from the plasma membrane, so that H 2 O 2 meets its target signaling molecules immediately. Indeed, non-phagocytic isoforms of NADPH oxidase that are integral membrane proteins with six transmembrane a helices are implicated in PDGF-, angiotensin II-and insulin-dependent signaling [12] . For example, the PDGF receptor signals to NADPH oxidase via phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and Rac [13, 14] . The direct interaction of Toll-like receptor 4 with the NADPH oxidase 4 isoform has been reported [15] . It is also believed that intracellular H 2 O 2 generated in response to receptor stimulation is in the sub-lethal range, that is, several micromolar or less. In this context, the molecular features of 2-Cys Prxs implicate them as prime candidates for H 2 O 2 signal regulators, although their catalytic efficiencies are less than those of catalase and GPxs [10] .",

Similar studies have since followed using other ligands, such as thyrotropin (TSH), TNF-a, and TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), as well as further work on EGFdependent H 2 O 2 production, in various cell types [17] [18] [19] [20] . Collectively, these studies show that 2-Cys Prxs not only eliminate the levels of intracellular H 2 O 2 that were increased upon receptor stimulation, but also suppress the downstream signaling responses, including NF-kB transcriptional activity, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) activity and apoptosis.

            "text": "Recently, systematic studies on the signaling role of 2-Cys Prxs have been published. One of these found the differential regulation of different MAP kinases by Prx II [21] . Under conditions of TNF-a stimulation in which Prx II activity was either partially blocked using a dominant negative mutant version or was completely abolished by gene knockout, JNK and p38 MAP kinase activation was enhanced whereas the activation of extracellular signalrelated kinase (ERK) was suppressed. Given the fact that all three MAP kinases are activated by exogenously added H 2 O 2 [22] , this is a surprising result in that, although it is structurally simple and reactive, endogenously produced H 2 O 2 has a differential selectivity for different target signaling pathways. Another study demonstrated the regulation of PDGF signaling by Prx II [23] . It was asserted that the endogenous H 2 O 2 regulated by Prx II targets the phosphorylation of the tyrosines at sites 579/ 581 and 857 in the PDGF receptor, but has no effect on any of the other tyrosine sites that are known to be phosphorylated ( Figure 2 ), whereas exogenously added H 2 O 2 was shown to induce the phosphorylation of all possible tyrosine sites. It was also shown that the siteselective response is controlled solely by Prx II and not by other peroxidases, and is achieved through the inactivation of the membrane-associated protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs). Although these studies delineate the selective and specific roles of H 2 O 2 as a second messenger and Prx II as a signal regulator in PDGF signaling, they are unsuccessful in elucidating the exact molecular identity of H 2 O 2 targets.

They include the superoxide anion (O K 2 $), hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ), hydroxyl radical (OH%), singlet oxygen (O%) and ozone (O 3 ) in nature; in biological systems, the former three species are significant. The superoxide anion is not freely diffusible through the lipid membrane because of its negative charge, but probably can penetrate cells via anion channels. The superoxide anion attacks iron-sulfur centers in respiratory chains and iron-responsive proteins. NADPH oxidases actively produce superoxide at the expense of NADPH in mammalian cells. H 2 O 2 is both membrane permeable and relatively stable and oxidizes proteins, particularly methionine to methione sulfoxide or on highly reactive cysteine residues to cysteine sulfenic, sulfinic and sulfonic acids in sequence. Among the ROS, the hydroxyl radical is known to be the most reactive and toxic, and it rapidly attacks proteins, lipids and nucleic acids via a free radical chain reaction. [11] . Whether or not this unusual biochemical property is meaningful in a cellular context has recently been addressed intensively by several laboratories. An acidic shift of the 2-Cys Prxs has been shown with the use of 2D gel analysis of H 2 O 2 -treated cell lines [26] [27] [28] [29] . Mass spectrometric analysis of the shifted acidic spot indicated that the reduced active site cysteine in one 2-Cys Prx was overoxidized to cysteine sulfinic acid (-SO 2 ). More importantly, this overoxidation was the cause of irreversible inactivation and was shown to require the complete peroxidase reaction cycle, such that 0.017% of active enzyme was overoxidized per reaction cycle [29] . The overoxidation is observed in cells challenged with oxidative stress or with long treatment with TNF-a [27, 29] , but not in growth factor-treated cells [23] .",

Although the chaperone activity of the overoxidized 2-Cys Prx in cells has yet to be proven, it seems to be crucial for the survival of oxidatively damaged cells.

The generated H 2 O 2 immediately oxidizes, however, and then inactivates the PTP. Phosphorylation at both sites is preserved, thereby activating the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK). The RTK actively propagates the phosphorylation signal to downstream molecules, which eventually induces cell proliferation. Because of the necessity for signal attenuation (c), Prx II is recruited by the activated receptor complex, eliminating H 2 O 2 . PTP is therefore activated and removes the phosphoryl groups from sites 579/581 and 857. RTK activity is consequently reduced, and the growth signal is diminished. In this model, the exact location of H 2 O 2 generation and the presence of PTP responsible for dephosphorylating tyrosine 579/581 and 857 are tentative.",

By contrast, a 2-Cys Prx appears to be recruited to the receptor in PDGF stimulation [23] , suggesting that 2-Cys Prxs stay in the cytosol in resting cells.

Prx I expression is elevated in most cancers, and is increased as the result of carcinogen phorbol ester treatment, which affects the protein kinase C and p38 MAP kinase pathways [63] . Prx I is also known to be involved in tumor suppression, however, functioning as a c-Abl tyrosine kinase inhibitor [64] and as an inhibitor of Myc-mediated signaling by interacting with the Myc Box II domain of Myc [65] . Prx I-deficient mice consistently develop malignant tumors when aged [66] .

Given that growth factor-induced tyrosine phosphorylation is dependent on the generation of intracellular H 2 O 2 [1, 2] , it has been hypothesized that self-sufficiency in growth signals, one of the crucial factors for tumorigenesis [67] , is accompanied by the ligandindependent amplification of H 2 O 2 signal. In this context, Prx II has been surmised to be a fundamental intracellular regulator that determines the amplitude of intracellular H 2 O 2 appropriate for hyperproliferation but insufficient for apoptosis. In support of this hypothesis, the suppression of Prx II expression using antisense cDNA has been demonstrated to render cancer cells more susceptible to radiation-induced apoptosis [68] . Prx III knockdown by RNA interference also appears to sensitize cervical cancer cells to death receptor-and stressmediated apoptosis, possibly through the disruption of mitochondrial function [69] . Prx III has been reported to be a Myc target gene product [70] . Considering these data collectively, a plausible therapeutic strategy for the treatment of cancer might be to screen for chemical drugs that target Prx II or Prx III activity, rather than targeting their transcriptional control.

Briefly, the N-terminal active site cysteine residue is deeply buried, whereas the counterpart C-terminal cysteine residue is partially exposed to the solvent. In all three structures, the sulfur atoms of the Review active site and the resolving cysteine residues are relatively far part (w13 \u00c5 ), so the formation of intermolecular or intramolecular disulfide linkage needs a conformational change. The active site cysteine residue interacts with Arg127 (numbering is based on the Prx II amino acid sequence), which appears to contribute to the active site reactivity, that is, lowering the pKa of the active site cysteine, at a distance of 3.3 \u00c5 .",

What is the bona fide target molecule of endogenous H 2 O 2 in a particular signaling pathway? This will provide new insights into the mechanism by which 2-Cys Prxs regulate H 2 O 2 signaling. And finally, what is the quantitative level of H 2 O 2 that triggers the switch between signaling and stress?

Catalytic response: In normally growing cells, in which H 2 O 2 generation is transient or pulsed, 2-Cys Prx efficiently controls H 2 O 2 concentration through a canonical reaction cycle coupling with thioredoxin (Trx) and thioredoxin reductase (TrxR). Stress response: Under oxidative stress, however, 2-Cys Prx initially undergoes a canonical reaction cycle but cannot avoid overoxidation to cysteine sulfinic acid (-SO 2 H), as a result of the persistent peroxidase reaction. The overoxidized 2-Cys Prx proteins then multimerize into a high molecular weight chaperone complex, which presumably protects the cells from protein aggregation. If the oxidative stress is weakened, the overoxidized 2-Cys Prx is gradually converted to active enzyme by sulfiredoxin in the presence of ATP. This model would be confirmed when it has been proved that 2-Cys Prx overoxidation does not occur during receptor-mediated signaling, which is a highly controversial issue.",
