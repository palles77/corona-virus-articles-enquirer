The total flavonoids of Sophora tonkinensis (TFST) were inactive on the complement system but showed obvious anticomplement activity after incubated with human intestinal bacteria in vitro. In order to discover the metabolic activation of TFST by intestinal flora, the constituents of TFST and its metabolites were identified by UPLC-ESI-LTQ/MS. Their anticomplement activities were evaluated through the classical and alternative pathway. As a result, eighteen flavonoids were identified, including seven flavonoid glycosides, five aglycones and six isoprenylated flavonoids. All the glycosides (daidzein-4 -glucosiderhamnoside, sophorabioside, rutin, isoquercitrin, quercitrin, ononin, trifolirhizin) were metabolized into their corresponding aglycones in different extent by human intestinal bacteria, resulting in the contents of the five aglycones were highly increased in 24 h. However, no changes have occurred on the six isoprenylated flavonoids. Interestingly, three aglycones (quercetin, formononetin and maackiain) had significantly more potent anticomplement activities than their prototype glycosides. The results indicated that the enhancement of TFST anticomplement activity was attributed to the active aglycones, especially formononetin and quercetin, produced by human intestinal bacteria. These aglycones are likely to be among the potential active components of S. tonkinensis for its inhibiting inflammation effects.",

Ononin and quercitrin were further metabolized by specific human intestinal bacteria from these three groups, including Bacteroides, Escherichia coli, Lactobacillus and Enterococcus faecalis. The results showed that ononin could be transformed by all the four bacteria into formononetin (Fig. S6) . However, only Bacteroides could convert quercitrin to quercetin (Fig. S7) . The reason might be the different glycosidic bonds of the two compounds. The \u2424-glucoside in ononin is more common in nature than the \u2423-rhamnoside in quercitrin and thus could be metabolized more easily by most intestinal bacteria. On the other hand, the four bacteria had quite differnt efficinecies on metabolizing ononin, in which Enterococcus faecalis transformed almost all the compound into its aglycone. Besides, the roots of sophora flavescens Ait, another commonly used medicinal plant from Sophora, are found to contain similar chemical constituents as S. tonkinensis, including isoprenylated flavonoids and quinolizidine alkaloids. However, their clinical applications are completely different [28, 29] . S. tonkinensis is frequently used internally to treat acute throat infections while S. flavescens is mostly used externally for the treatment of skin diseases, such as eczema and dermatitis [30] . And their different flavonoid constituents could serve as the qualitative markers for identification of S. tonkinensis and S. flavescens. S. flavescens roots barely contain flavonoid glycosides but mainly contain isoprenylated flavonoids (Fig. S8) , which are inactive on the complement system and unable to be metabolized by intestinal bacteria. As expected, almost no change was detected when the flavonoids of S. flavescens were incubated with human intestinal bacteria, except trifolirhizin (1) metabolized to maackiain (1 ) (Fig. S9, Table S3 ). These results further explain the different effects and administration routes of S. flavescens and S. tonkinensis.",

The contents of flavonoid aglycones with potent anticomplement activity were enhanced significantly under the hydrolytic action of intestinal flora on the flavonoid glycosides. Among the eighteen flavonoids identified using UPLC-ESI-LTQ/MS method, isoflavone and flavonol aglycones (formononetin and quercetin) and three flavonol glycosides (rutin, isoquercitrin and quercitrin) were the major anticomplement constituents of TFST and should be taken as the quality markers of S. tonkinensis roots. The in vivo anti-inflammatory and anticomplement effects of formononetin, the most potent constitent and metabolite of TFST, will be investigated in the near future. ",

The ion at m/z 419.10 was generated by losing a molecule of water and the ion at m/z 313.17 was corresponding to the loss of lavandulyl group in a similar pathway. The ion at m/z 300.98 ( 1,3 A -) was attributed to RDA cleavage of flavanone and the ion at m/z 176.96 was corresponding to the loss of lavandulyl group ( 1,3 A --lavandulyl) sequentially. By matching experimental MS/MS spectra with those reported in the literature[21], compounds 8 was identified as kurarinone.Compound9 showed the [M-H] \u2212 ion at m/z 459.09, and the fragment ions at m/z 403.13, 205.21, 204.07, 176.05 and 149.04, which were corresponding to [M-H-isopentenyl]-, ( 1,3 A -), [ 1,3 A --H]-, [ 1,3 A --H-CO] \u2212 and ( 1,3 A --isopentenyl) respectively. The fragmentation pathways were consistent with sophoradin [22]. Compound 10 gave the [M-H] \u2212 ion at m/z 457.03, the fragment ions at m/z 401.08, 253.08, 205.13, 204.09, 176.05 and 149.22, which were the typical fragmentation pattern of isoprenylated flavonoid. The ion at m/z 401.08 was corresponding to the loss of isopentene group. The ions at m/z 253.08 ( 1,3 B -) and 205.13 ( 1,3 A -) were attributed to RDA Cleavage of flavanone and the ion at m/z 149.22 was corresponding to the loss of isopentene group ( 1,3 A -isopentenyl) sequentially. Based on MS/MS spectra with those reported in literature and database [23], compounds 10 was identified as sophoradochromene. Compounds 11, 12 and 13 showed the [M-H] \u2212 ions at m/z 475.14, 459.05 and 457.11, the fragment ions at m/z 419.15, 269.21,  203.11, 147.14; 403.08, 255.19, 203.14, 147.06 and 401.21, 253.11,  203.13, 147.06, which were corresponding to [M-H-isopentenyl] \u2212 , ( 1,3 B -), ( 1,3 A -) and ( 1,3 A --isopentenyl), respectively. The fragmentation pathways of these three compounds were consistent with 2-(3-Hydroxy-2, 2-dimethyl-8-prenyl-6-chromanyl)-7-hydroxy-8-prenyl-4-chromanone, sophoranone and sophoranochromene[23][24][25][26].",
