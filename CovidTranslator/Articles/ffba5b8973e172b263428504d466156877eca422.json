            "text": "Th ere has been considerable recent interest into the causes and mechanisms of exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) as COPD exacerbations are an important cause of the considerable morbidity and mortality found in COPD [1] . COPD exacerbations increase with increasing severity of COPD. Some patients are prone to frequent exacerbations that are an important cause of hospital admission and readmission, and these frequent exacerbations may have considerable impact on quality of life, disease progression, and mortality [2] ( Fig. 67.1 ). COPD exacerbations are also associated with considerable physiological deterioration and increased airway infl ammatory changes [3] that are caused by a variety of factors such as viruses, bacteria, and possibly common pollutants. COPD exacerbations are commoner in the winter months and there may be important interactions between cold temperatures and exacerbations caused by viruses or pollutants [4] .",

            "text": "Earlier descriptions of COPD exacerbations had concentrated mainly on studies of hospital admission, though most COPD exacerbations are treated in the community and not associated with hospital admission. A cohort of moderate-to-severe COPD patients was followed in East London, UK (East London COPD study) with daily diary cards and peak fl ow readings, who were asked to report exacerbations as soon as possible after symptomatic onset [2] . Th e diagnosis of COPD exacerbation was based on criteria modifi ed from those described by Anthonisen and colleagues [5] , which require two symptoms for diagnosis, one of which must be a major symptom of increased dyspnoea, sputum volume, or sputum purulence. Minor exacerbation symptoms included cough, wheeze, sore throat, nasal discharge, or fever ( Table 67 .1 ). Th e study found that about 50% of exacerbations were unreported to the research team, despite considerable encouragement provided and only diagnosed from diary cards. But there were no diff erences in major symptoms or physiological parameters between reported and unreported exacerbations [2] . Patients with COPD are accustomed to frequent symptom changes and thus may tend to underreport exacerbations to physicians. Th ese patients have high levels of anxiety and depression and may accept their situation [6, 7] . Th e tendency of patients to underreport exacerbations may explain the higher total rate of exacerbation at 2.7 per patient per year, which is higher than that of previously reported by Anthonisen and co-workers at 1.1 per patient per year [5] . However in the latter study, exacerbations were unreported and diagnosed from patients ' recall of symptoms.",

Th is suggests that exacerbation frequency is an important determinant of health status in COPD and is thus one of the important outcome measures in COPD. Factors predictive of frequent exacerbations included daily cough and sputum and frequent exacerbations in the previous year. A previous of colds, and longer recovery time from exacerbations. Symptoms of dyspnoea, common colds, sore throat, and cough increased signifi cantly during the prodromal phase, and this suggests that respiratory viruses may have early eff ects at exacerbations. Th e median time to recovery of peak expiratory fl ow was 6 days and 7 days for symptoms, but at 35 days peak expiratory fl ow had returned to normal in only 75% of exacerbations, while at 91 days, 7.1% of exacerbations had not returned to baseline lung function. Recovery was longer in the presence of increased dyspnoea or symptoms of a common cold at exacerbation. Th e changes observed in lung function at exacerbation were smaller than those observed at asthmatic exacerbations, though the average duration of an asthmatic exacerbation was longer at 9.6 days [10, 11] .",

Th e incomplete physiological recovery after an exacerbation could contribute to the decline in lung function with time in patients with COPD. However to date, there is no evidence that patients with incomplete recovery of their exacerbation have a greater decline in lung function, and further studies on the natural history of COPD exacerbations are required. A recent audit performed by the Royal College of Physicians, London, showed that \u03f330% of patients seen at hospital with an index exacerbation will be seen again and possibly readmitted with a recurrent exacerbation within 8 weeks [12] . In a cohort of moderate-to-severe COPD patients 22% of patients had a recurrent exacerbation within 50 days of the fi rst (index) exacerbation, and this event can be separated discretely from the index exacerbation [13] . Th us, exacerbations are complex events and careful follow-up is essential to ensure complete recovery.",

Studies have shown that at least one-third of COPD exacerbations were associated with viral infections, and that the majority of these were due to human rhinovirus, the cause of the common cold [19, 22, 23] . Viral exacerbations were associated with symptomatic colds and prolonged recovery of the exacerbation [9] . Using molecular techniques, Seemungal and colleagues also showed that rhinovirus can be recovered from induced sputum more frequently than from nasal aspirates at exacerbation, suggesting that wild-type rhinovirus can infect the lower airway and contribute to infl ammatory changes at exacerbation [22] . Th ey also found that exacerbations associated with the presence of rhinovirus in induced sputum had larger increases in airway IL-6 levels [22] , suggesting that viruses increase the severity of airway infl ammation at exacerbation. Th is fi nding is in agreement with the data that respiratory viruses produce longer and more severe exacerbations and have a major impact on health care utilization [9, 24] . Other viruses may trigger COPD exacerbation, though coronavirus was associated with only a small proportion of asthmatic exacerbations and is unlikely to play a major role in COPD [25] . RSV (respiratory syncytial virus), infl uenza, parainfl uenza, and adenovirus can all trigger exacerbations. Infl uenza has become a less prominent cause of exacerbation with the introduction of immunization, though this is still likely to be an important factor at times of infl uenza epidemics. RSV infection has been found at COPD exacerbation [26] , but it is not clear if RSV is a cause of COPD exacerbation as RSV can be frequently detected in the airways of COPD patients when stable [27] .",

            "text": "Over the past years, the role of bacterial infection at COPD exacerbation has been somewhat controversial as airway bacterial colonization is found when patients are stable state and the same organisms are isolated exacerbations . Th ese include Haemophilus Infl uenzae, Streptococcus Pneumoniae , Branhamella cattarhalis, Staphylococcus aureus , and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. [28] . In a study in patients with moderate-to-severe COPD, bacteria were found in 48.2% of patients in the stable state and at exacerbation, bacterial detection rose to 69.6%, with an associated rise in airway bacterial load [29] . Th e case for involvement of bacteria has come from the studies of antibiotic therapy as exacerbations often present with increased sputum purulence and volume and antibiotics have traditionally been used as fi rst-line therapy in such exacerbations. Anthonisen and colleagues in a classical paper investigating the benefi t of antibiotics in over 300 acute exacerbations demonstrated a greater treatment success rate in patients treated with antibiotics, especially if their initial presentation was with the symptoms of increased dyspnoea, sputum volume, and purulence [5] . Patients with mild COPD obtained less benefi t from antibiotic therapy. A meta-analysis of trials of antibiotic therapy in COPD has concluded that antibiotic therapy off ered a small but signifi cant benefi t in outcome in exacerbations [30] . Sethi and colleagues have suggested that isolation of a new bacterial strain in COPD patients who were regularly sampled was associated with an increased risk of exacerbation [31] , though this also does not conclusively prove that bacteria are direct causes of exacerbations as not all exacerbations were associated with strain change, and not all strain changes resulted in exacerbation.",

Th is has been confi rmed in a further study demonstrating greater lung function impairment and longer hospitalizatons in exacerbations associated with viral and bacterial co-infection [32] .

With an exacerbation of COPD, the increase in airfl ow obstruction will further increase the load on the respiratory muscles and increase the work of breathing, precipitating respiratory failure in more severe cases.

Th ere was a reduction in hospital stay from a mean of 6.1 days to 3.2 days. In another larger study by Skwarska and colleagues, patients were randomized to discharge on the day of assessment or conventional management [62] . Again there were no diff erences in readmission rates, no diff erences in visits to primary care physicians and health status measured 8 weeks after discharge was similar in the two groups. Th e authors also demonstrated that there were signifi cant cost savings of around 50% for the home support group, compared to the admitted group. However, other considerations need to be taken into account in organizing an assisted discharge service in that resources have to be released for the nurses to follow the patients and the benefi ts may be seasonal, as COPD admissions are a particular problem in the winter. Further work is required on the diff erent models of supported discharge available and the cost eff ectiveness of these programmes.",

In the recently reported TORCH (Towards a Revolution in COPD Health) study, salmeterol, a long-acting beta agonist, reduced the frequency of exacerbations [66] , while a number of other studies have shown that the long-acting anticholinergic tiotropium reduces the exacerbation rate and also a trend to reduction in hospital admission [67] [68] [69] . However, there is no good evidence at present that long-acting anticholinergic agents possess anti-infl ammatory activity [70] , and it is likely that tiotropium reduces exacerbations by reducing dynamic hyperinfl ation and thus dyspnoea. Combinations of long-acting beta agonists and inhaled corticosteroids have been also evaluated and reduced exacerbations more than the individual components [66] . A direct comparison of inhaled tiotropium with the salmeterol/fl uticasone (SFC) combination in the recently reported INSPIRE study in moderate-to-severe COPD patients showed that both interventions had an equal eff ect on exacerbation rates [71] . However, patients taking tiotropium required more courses of oral corticosteroids with exacerbations whereas patients on the SFC combination required more courses of antibiotics [71] . Th is for the fi rst time, it has been shown that different interventions have diff erent eff ects on exacerbations.",
