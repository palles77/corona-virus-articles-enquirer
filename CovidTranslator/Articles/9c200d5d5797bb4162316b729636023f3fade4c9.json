Proposed mechanisms include VZV dissemination associated with diffuse lymphocytic infiltration along the course of the VII nerve beyond the geniculate ganglion [6] , the X nerve anatomic communication with the VII and VIII nerves [11] . It is also proposed that inflammatory spread along the vascular system may result in polyneuropathy [12, 13] , since the nerves VIII, X, XI, and XII are supplied by the ascending pharyngeal artery [14] . Kiyokawa et al. demonstrated various communications among nerve branches around the acoustic meatus and the auricle before reaching the central nervous system; the X nerve distributing to the posterior wall of the external acoustic meatus had communications with the VII nerve and the IX nerve [15] .",

Clinical findings in patients with laryngitis due to herpesviruses include edema, ulcerative lesions, and vesicles in the glottic or supraglottic region [18] . Although the diagnosis of acute laryngitis caused by common respiratory pathogens can often be made by history alone, laryngoscopic examination of the larynx may be necessary to differentiate zoster laryngitis from other rare etiologies of laryngitis, such as laryngeal tumor, in the presence of multiple cranial nerve involvement.",
