Patients and methods: We prospectively included all adult and pediatric patients admitted to Necker hospital (Paris) between October 2018 and February 2019 with a diagnosis of RSV-associated ALRI. We compared characteristics of ALRIs between patients with community-acquired versus nosocomial infections and, in each group, between children and adults. Results: Community-acquired and nosocomial RSV-associated ALRIs were diagnosed in 229 and 11 inpatients, respectively. The burden of community-acquired infections was higher in children than in adults: 2.1% versus 0.2% of the total number of pediatric and adult inpatients, respectively (p < 0.0001); 4.2% versus 0.2% of the total number of hospitalization days in pediatric and adult units, respectively (p < 0.0001). Compared to inpatients with community-acquired ALRIs, those with nosocomial infections were more frequently adults (45.5% versus 2.6%, p \u00bc 0.0005) and subjects with at least one chronic complex condition (100.0% versus 41.0%, p < 0.0001). The total number of hospitalization days due to nosocomial ALRIs was higher in adults than in children (0.32% versus 0.11%, p < 0.0001).",

In infants, a severe course of nosocomial disease has been described, especially in subjects with comorbidities [5] , even more severe than community-acquired RSV infections [6] . In adults, RSV acquisition seems to be frequently nosocomial or healthcare-related, with a higher mortality than with influenza virus infection [7] .

The median length of hospital stay was in the range of that reported in previous pediatric studies (between 2 and 11 days). However, the prevalence of admission to ICU and the mortality rate were higher than previously described in high-income countries (41.0% versus 2e12%, and 1.3% versus < 0.5%, respectively) [1] . This could be explained by the high prevalence of CCC in the population of children followed in our tertiary hospital, and, consequently, in those admitted for community-acquired RSV infections. This proportion was higher than in previous studies, where typically > 70% of children hospitalized with RSV-related ALRI/bronchiolitis had no underlying medical conditions [16e18,22e24]. Thus, the epidemiological characteristics of patients admitted at our hospital with community-acquired RSV infections cannot be extrapolated to other French pediatric centers.",

However, the retrospective evaluation of the medical files of all RSV-infected inpatients revealed that no other patient required palivizumab according to the 2007 French and the 2014 American guidelines [8, 12] . Our results suggest that guidelines of antiviral prophylaxis are appropriately applied in our center but that most of the patients admitted for RSV infections (and most of those admitted to pediatric ICU), did not fall into the recognized indications for RSV prophylaxis, as recently reported by Ghazaly et al. [26] . In light with the ongoing research into the development of new and more cost-effective strategies against RSV infections than palivizumab (including long acting monoclonal antibodies and vaccines), further larger studies defining the characteristics of patients hospitalized with severe RSV infections, may help to rethink the guidelines of RSV prophylactic strategies. RSV is known to be a major nosocomial hazard on paediatric wards, especially in cases of age less than 5 months, prematurity and chronic lung disease of prematurity [6] . Previous studies described rates of nosocomial RSV infections between 0.4 and 9.6% [6,27e29] , with poorer clinical outcomes than community-acquired RSV infections [6] . Contrasting with these results, we observed in our pediatric wards a low rate of nosocomial RSV-related ALRIs (0.06% of inpatients) and no death related to nosocomial RSV infection. This low rate of nosocomial infections could be related to our multifaceted infection control strategy including a high proportion of single-patient rooms (for both infected and uninfected patients), staff training repeated before each season of viral epidemics, screening of symptomatic patients, isolation/cohorting, hand washing, gloves and masks, gowns (for staff attending infants with respiratory symptoms) and restriction of visitors.",

Indeed, nosocomial infections were proportionately more frequently diagnosed in adults than community-acquired ALRIs (p < 0.0001) and the total number of hospitalization days due to nosocomial RSV infection was higher in adults than in children (0.32% versus 0.11%, p < 0.0001). Similarly, Kestler M et al. recently described that RSV acquisition was frequently nosocomial or healthcarerelated in adults during flu season [7] . Although we did not observe the high RSV-related mortality described in adults by Kestler (14.7%), we described longer length of hospital stay in case of nosocomial versus community-acquired infections in adults. Our results suggest that, despite a low rate of nosocomial infections observed in adults (0.15% of inpatients), our multifaceted infection control strategy may be reinforced in adults wards in order to obtain similar results seen in pediatric units. Because of the low number of nosocomial infections during the 2018/2019 RSV epidemic, it could be interesting to repeat this study during several successive seasonal epidemics in order to evaluate the effectiveness of our bundle of measures in a larger population.",

            "text": "This study has five main limitations. First, RSV-related ALRIs were defined from the data provided by the virology laboratory. Because RSV may not have been screened in a significant proportion of patients with ALRI, this study may underestimate the real burden of RSV infection in our center. This underestimation may be more pronounced in patients with mild symptoms (especially those with isolated upper respiratory tract infection), where RSV may have been less frequently screened than in case of severe infection. However this potential limitation does not hamper evaluation of the efficacy of our infection control strategy, which mainly aims to prevent severe infections. Second, although the ALRIs were primarily attributed to RSV by clinicians in all patients described in this study, we cannot exclude that viral and bacterial co-infections may have influenced their clinical outcome. This confounding factor cannot be excluded in our non interventional study because all other respiratory pathogens may not have been screened for. In order to evaluate the impact of this potential bias, further prospective studies are needed with systematic screening of all potential viral and bacterial coinfections. Third, this observational study does not allow the effectiveness of individual components of our multicomponent control measures to be assessed. Similar observation was done by French CE et al. in the recent review of published and unpublished literature about the effectiveness of control measures to prevent nosocomial RSV transmission events [30] . However, because similar preventive strategies were applied in all units of our center, this limitation does not hamper the comparison of their efficacy on pediatric versus adult wards. Further studies are needed in order to evaluate to what extent the compliance with each measure of our infection control bundle differs between adult and paediatric populations. Because nosocomial infections may be transmitted by healthcare personnel, visitors and patients, it would be interesting to differentiate the compliance to measures targeting each of these populations in such further studies. Fourth, as previously discussed, the high prevalence of CCC among patients followed in our tertiary hospital hampers extrapolation of our results to other French hospitals. The higher prevalence of CCC among patients with nosocomial versus community-acquired RSV infections (100.0% versus 41.0%) may at least partly explain the longer length of stay in the former than in the latter. Fifth, we used a very large definition of a nosocomial case, by pooling \"possibly\" and \"definitely\" nosocomial infections. In previous studies investigating the risk of RSV transmission to patients and providing a clear definition of a nosocomial case, various cut-off were used to define it (mostly 5 days or more after hospital admission) [30] . Here, we chose a wider definition of a nosocomial case (i.e. infection occurring in a patient hospitalized continuously ! 2 days before the onset of respiratory symptoms), because (i) the RSV incubation period may be as short as 2 days [9] , and (ii) we did not want to minimize the real burden of RSV nosocomial ALRIs. Interestingly, although we used such a wide cut-off, the burden was not high in our center. This limitation does not hamper comparison of the burden of nosocomial infections between pediatric and adult wards at our center.",

However, the burden of nosocomial infection was higher in adults than in children, suggesting that education and training of healthcare workers, patients and visitors about the risk of nosocomial respiratory viral disease should be reinforced on adult wards. The fact than > 97% of patients hospitalized with communityacquired or nosocomial RSV-associated ALRI were not considered at \"high-risk\" (i.e. requiring immunoprophylaxis with palivizumab) according to the French and American guidelines, highlights the urgent need to develop new and more cost-effective antiviral preventive strategies, in order to decrease the burden of RSV infections requiring hospitalizations.",
