To gain insights into the indicating effect of PBM to osteoporosis, this study focused on characterizing the PBM networks and identifying key genes. One biological data set with 12 monocyte low PBM samples and 11 high PBM samples was derived to construct protein-protein interaction networks (PPINs). Based on clique-merging, module-identification algorithm was used to identify modules from PPINs. The systematic calculation and comparison were performed to test whether the network entropy can discriminate the low PBM network from high PBM network. We constructed 32 destination networks with 66 modules divided from monocyte low and high PBM networks. Among them, network 11 was the only significantly differential one (P<0.05) with 8 nodes and 28 edges. All genes belonged to precursors of osteoclasts, which were related to calcium transport as well as blood monocytes. In conclusion, based on the entropy in PBM PPINs, the differential network appears to be a novel therapeutic indicator for osteoporosis during the bone monocyte progression; these findings are helpful in disclosing the pathogenetic mechanisms of osteoporosis.",

An integrated network method was applied to predict conserved regulators related to high and low viral pathogenicity, leading to therapeutic targets for intervention (17) . In addition, recent study confirmed that signaling entropy computable from integrating a gene expression profile with a protein-protein interaction network (PPIN), correlate with phenotypic plasticity and is increased in disease compared to normal controls (18) . Based on information theory, entropy opens new perspectives for gene inference methods and increases the accuracy of PPINs (19) . Jin et al (20) compared the IAV-induced inflammatory regulatory networks and normal cellular networks by integrating the data from the highly pathogenic avian H5N1 and the pandemic H1N1 with PPINs, and these findings provide significant hypotheses for further exploring the molecular mechanisms of infectious diseases and developing control strategies.",

Based on the landscape, functional network entropy can be readily detected to facilitate the valuable application of PPIs on disease research. Previous studies have revealed that increased entropy appears to be a hallmark of cancer systems (27, 28) . Thus we utilized the previous hypothesis that the network entropy could discriminate the inflammatory network from the normal network (20) . The systematic calculation and comparison were performed to test whether the network entropy can also discriminate the low PBM network from high PBM network. By applying a significance test for the difference in global network entropy of low and high PBM networks, we found the global network entropy of PBM networks is significantly differential (P<0.05). The result claimed that the network entropy provided good discrimination between low and high PBM networks. Moreover, this method can serve as a significant foundation for further exploring the molecular mechanisms of other diseases and developing control strategies. One unique advantage of the present method compared with custom networks identifying analysis is that the entropy performs better than other topological metrics of the network in characterizing the inflammatory disease, which was detected by the Network Analyzer plug-in in Cytoscape (20, 29) . Thereby, the significantly different network we captured was more valuable and promising in understanding molecular mechanisms of diseases and reliable in therapeutic options.",

In a previous study, the surplus/PSMD5 was found to inhibit the assembly and activity of 26S proteasome in human disease (32) . Importantly, neuronal activity and calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II could regulate the expression of proteasome (33) . Intracellular calcium mobilization regulates the activity of 26S proteasome during the metaphase-anaphase transition in meiotic cell cycle (34) .
