            "text": "Hydrogen sulfide is produced endogenously by a variety of enzymes involved in cysteine metabolism. Clinical data indicate that endogenous levels of hydrogen sulfide are diminished in various forms of cardiovascular diseases. The aim of the current study was to investigate the effects of hydrogen sulfide supplementation on cardiac function during reperfusion in a clinically relevant experimental model of cardiopulmonary bypass. Twelve anesthetized dogs underwent hypothermic cardiopulmonary bypass. After 60 minutes of hypothermic cardiac arrest, reperfusion was started after application of either saline vehicle (control, n = 6), or the sodium sulfide infusion (1 mg/kg/hour, n = 6). Biventricular hemodynamic variables were measured by combined pressure-volume-conductance catheters. Coronary and pulmonary blood flow, vasodilator responses to acetylcholine and sodiumnitroprusside and pulmonary function were also determined. Administration of sodium sulfide led to a significantly better recovery of left and right ventricular systolic function (P < 0.05) after 60 minutes of reperfusion. Coronary blood flow was also significantly higher in the sodium sulfide-treated group (P < 0.05). Sodium sulfide treatment improved coronary blood flow, and preserved the acetylcholine-induced increases in coronary and pulmonary blood (P < 0.05). Myocardial ATP levels were markedly improved in the sulfide-treated group. Thus, supplementation of sulfide improves the recovery of myocardial and endothelial function and energetic status after hypothermic cardiac arrest during cardiopulmonary bypass. These beneficial effects occurred without any detectable adverse hemodynamic or cardiovascular effects of sulfide at the dose used in the current study.",

Murine J774 macrophages were grown in culture and exposed to cytotoxic concentrations of nitrosoglutathione, or peroxynitrite (a reactive species formed from the reaction of nitric oxide and superoxide). Pretreatment of the cells with sodium sulfide (60-300 \u00b5M) reduced the loss of cell viability elicited by the nitric oxide donor compound (3 mM) or by peroxynitrite (3 mM), as measured by the MTT method. Sodium sulfide did not affect cell viability in the concentration range tested. In mice subjected to bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 5 mg/kg i.p.), treatment of the animals with sodium sulfide (0.2 mg/kg/hour for 4 hours, administered in Alzet minipumps) reduced the LPSinduced increase in plasma IL-1\u03b2 and TNF\u03b1 levels. These responses were attenuated when animals were pretreated with the heme oxygenase inhibitor tin-protoporphyrin IX (6 mg/kg). The current results point to the cytoprotective and anti-inflammatory effects of hydrogen sulfide, in cells exposed to nitrosative stress, and in animals subjected to endotoxemia.",

            "text": "Introduction Extracellular release of ATP is an important modulator of immune response. ATP plasma concentration is increased in sepsis [1] . IFN\u03b3 plays a critical role in host defense by promoting Th1 phenotype and bacterial clearance. Low IFN\u03b3 levels are associated with the Th2 phenotype consistent with critical illness anergy [2] . It has been reported that 100 and 300 mM ATP increased LPS/PHA-stimulated IL-10 secretion in human blood [3] . Higher IL-10/IFN\u03b3 ratio shifts the immune phenotype from Th1 to Th2 response. We studied the effect of ATP on LPS-stimulated IL-10 and IFN\u03b3 secretion in a standardized ex-vivo whole human blood culture. Methods Venous blood from 10 healthy volunteers was drawn into tubes containing 10 ng LPS/ml (ILCS\u00d2; EDI GmBH, Reutlingen, Germany) and incubated with or without 100 mM ATP, respectively, at 37\u00b0C for 24 hours. The supernates were separated and frozen at -20\u00b0C. Cytokine levels were analysed on a robotic workstation (epMotion 5075; Eppendorf AG, Hamburg, Germany) in duplicate using the ELISA Cytokine kit (Luminex; Biosource Int., Camarillo, CA, USA). Results Added ATP reduced the mean concentration of IFN\u03b3 in LPSstimulated blood from 1,206 \u00b1 1,667 pg/ml to 140 \u00b1 128 pg/ml; P = 0.006. There was no consistent effect of ATP on IL-10 secretion in our study (21.6 \u00b1 16.9 pg/ml to 17.2 \u00b1 18.8 pg/ml). Interestingly, three subjects of Indian/Indonesian origin had IL-10 levels below the assay detection limit. The mean IL-10/IFN\u03b3 ratio was increased from 0.05 \u00b1 0.04 to 0.16 \u00b1 0.09 in the remaining Caucasian subjects (P = 0.015). See Figure 1 . Conclusions Our results suggest an immunosuppressive effect of extracellular ATP that is evident by the decrease of IFN\u03b3 and therefore the relative shift of the immune response towards Th2 phenotype. Although this may represent a self-protective mechanism, it may contribute to critical illness anergy. ",

Consequently they might be involved in the pathophysiology of acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in sepsis patients. We hypothesized that plasma Ang2 levels are associated with pulmonary capillary protein permeability, the lung injury score (LIS), length of stay on the ICU, the APACHE II score and survival in septic patients with ALI or ARDS. Methods A prospective observational study was performed in an ICU of an university hospital on 112 patients: 38 after elective cardiac surgery, 26 after major vascular surgery, 24 with sepsis and 24 with trauma. Plasma levels of Ang1, Ang2 and VEGF were measured and a mobile probe system was used to measure the pulmonary leak index (PLI) (that is, the transvascular transport rate of gallium-67-radiolabeled transferrin).",

All candidate genes will be validated by quantitative PCR. associated with proximal tubule injury. In several in vitro and animal studies alkaline phosphatase (AP) was found to be effective in attenuating the inflammatory response by dephosphorylating LPS and may prevent organ damage. The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of AP on renal iNOS expression and kidney damage in patients with severe sepsis or septic shock. Fifteen patients (nine male/six female, age 55 \u00b1 5 years) with Gram-negative bacterial infection, two out of four SIRS criteria (<24 hours) and acute onset of end-organ dysfunction (<12 hours) were included in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase IIa study (2:1 ratio). An intravenous bolus injection of 67.5 U/kg bovine intestinal AP was followed by a maintenance dose of 177.5 U/kg for 24 hours. Arterial blood and urine were collected at different time points and analyzed for stable metabolites of NO. iNOS mRNA was determined by quantitative real-time RT-PCR using RNA isolated from renal cells in urine. The urinary excretion of the cytosolic glutathione S-transferase-A1 (GSTA1-1), a marker for proximal tubule damage, was measured using an ELISA. Data are depicted as the median (25-75% range). NO metabolites in blood were not significantly different between AP-treated (n = 10) and placebo-treated (n = 5) patients. However, the urinary excretion of NO metabolites decreased by 80% (75-85) from 227 (166-531) at baseline to 41 (28-84) \u00b5mol/ 10 mmol creatinine (P < 0.05) after 24 hours of AP administration. After placebo treatment, the amount of urinary NO metabolites increased by 70% (45-570) (from 81 (64-419) to 628 (65-1,479) \u00b5mol/10 mmol creatinine, P < 0.05). Baseline expression levels of iNOS in renal cells were 42-fold induced at baseline (vs healthy subjects), and AP administration reduced this induction by 80 \u00b1 5% ( Figure 1 ). Creatinine clearance improved by 45% (30-180) in patients treated with AP and declined by 25% (15-35) in placebo-treated patients. During the first 24 hours the amount of GSTA1-1 in urine of AP-treated patients decreased by 70% (50-80), compared with an increase of 200% (45-525) in placebo-treated patients, which correlated with urinary NO metabolites, indicating NO-induced proximal tubular damage.",

In Japan, sivelestat sodium hydrate (Elaspol), a selective elastase inhibitor, was approved in 2002 for ALI/ARDS accompanied by SIRS, and this medicine has been evaluated in a clinical situation. In this study, we performed a retrospective comparison of the sivelestat sodium administration between two groups of patients: Group Elaspol, consisting of 308 patients(209 males and 99 females, aged 66 \u00b1 15 years) with ALI/ARDS accompanied by SIRS who were treated with sivelestat sodium at a dose of 0.2 mg/kg/hour for 72 hours or more, after approval of this drug; and Group Control, consisting of 41 patients (28 males and 13 females, aged 66 \u00b1 14 years) with ALI/ARDS accompanied by SIRS who were treated in the ICU under similar conditions, but using traditional methods for respiratory control, prior to approval sivelestat sodium. The APACHE II scores of Group Elaspol and Group Control were 23 \u00b1 9 and 23 \u00b1 8, SOFA scores were 8.7 \u00b1 3.8 and 8.9 \u00b1 4.1, and the lung injury scores were 2.1 \u00b1 0.7 and 2.1 \u00b1 0.6, respectively, with no significant differences between the groups. The initial PEEP value of Group Elaspol was 5.9 \u00b1 3.3, which was significantly higher than that of Group Control (3.4 \u00b1 2.7 cmH 2 O). The PaO 2 /FIO 2 ratios under mechanical ventilation management 24, 48 and 72 hours after the beginning of drug administration were 209 \u00b1 87, 222 \u00b1 92, and 222 \u00b1 82 mmHg in Group Elaspol, and were 191 \u00b1 91, 207 \u00b1 91, and 211 \u00b1 100 mmHg in Group Control. The ventilator-free days of Group Elaspol and Group Control were 18 \u00b1 9 and 10 \u00b1 12 days, respectively, and these values showed a significant difference (P < 0.001). Furthermore, the survival rate after 28 days was significantly higher in Group Elaspol than in Group Control (Group Elaspol: 75%, Group Control: 52%; P < 0.001).

We developed a murine model of septic ALI after burn insult and examined the effects of prolonged administration of moderate doses of steroid. Methods Male BALB/c mice were divided into three groups. Group I served for sham burns. In groups II and III, a 15% BSA fullthickness burn was made on the dorsum under ether anesthesia, followed by adequate fluid resuscitation. After the burn injury, 3 mg/kg prednisolone (PSL) in group III was administered subcutaneously daily for 10 days. On the 11th day, 10 mg/kg lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was injected intravenously.

We tested the hypothesis that a volume resuscitation strategy may modify liver mitochondrial function and outcome. Methods Twenty-nine anesthetized pigs received for 24 hours either endotoxin or placebo, and either Ringer's lactate 10 ml/kg/hour or 15 ml/kg/hour + 5 ml/hour HES. Systemic and regional hemodynamics were measured. Liver mitochondrial state 3 and state 4 oxygen consumption were determined. Results Hepatosplanchnic oxygen delivery was similar in endotoxic pigs with high (2.97 \u00b1 1.58 ml/min/kg) vs moderate volume administration (3.06 \u00b1 0.6 ml/min/kg), but hepatosplanchnic VO 2 was lower in animals with high (1.32 \u00b1 0.4 ml/min/kg) vs moderate volume administration (1.75 \u00b1 0.3 ml/min/kg, P = 0.019). Endotoxin high-volume pigs exhibited a decrease in state 3 respiration for complex I and complex II (not significant) in comparison with control high-volume and with endotoxin low-volume pigs ( Figure 1 ). They also had an increased mortality rate during the 24-hour study period (60% vs 0% in controls). Conclusion A prolonged high-volume resuscitation approach during endotoxemia may be associated with impaired hepatosplanchnic oxygen consumption, liver mitochondrial dysfunction and high mortality. The impact of aggressive and prolonged volume administration on hepatosplanchnic oxygenation and mitochondrial function in human sepsis should be determined. Multiple studies have stressed the importance of the contribution of activated complement to the pathology of reperfusion injury after tissue ischemia. Using intravital microscopy, this study explores functional consequences of the inhibition of the classical pathway of complement activation with C1-esterase inhibitor (C1-INH) in the context of superior mesenteric artery occlusion (SMAO)/ reperfusion. Thirty anesthetized, spontaneously breathing, male Sprague-Dawley rats underwent SMAO for 60 minutes followed by reperfusion (4 hours). C1-esterase inhibitor (100 IU/kg, 200 IU/kg body weight) or saline (0.9%) was given as a single bolus before reperfusion. Sham-operated animals (n = 10) without SMAO served as controls. Systemic hemodynamics were monitored continuously, arterial blood gases analyzed intermittently, and leukocyte/ endothelial interactions in the mesenteric microcirculation quantified at intervals using intravital microscopy. Ileal lipid-binding protein (I-LBP) levels were measured from serum samples with an ELISA at the end of the experiments. C1-INH restored microcirculatory perfusion of postcapillary venules to baseline levels in a dose-dependent manner and reduced leukocyte adhesion following SMAO/reperfusion to similar levels in both C1-INH-treated groups during reperfusion. Furthermore, C1-INH treatment efficiently prevented metabolic acidosis, and reduced the need for intravenous fluids to support blood pressure. Furthermore, I-LBP levels decreased in a dose-dependent manner, and were comparable with the levels of sham-operated animals at the end of the experiments. Survival rates were 100% in controls and after 200 IU/kg C1-INH, 90% after 100 IU/kg C1-INH, and 30% in saline-treated animals.",

The peak early diastolic mitral annulus velocity (E\u2032) offers a relatively preload-insensitive measure of LV relaxation. There are scant data regarding its use in sepsis or endotoxemia. This study sought to determine the effect of endotoxemia upon TDI variables. Methods With ethics committee approval, 10 male Sprague-Dawley rats were studied. Anesthesia was induced with alfaxalone and maintained with isofluorane. Mechanical ventilation was performed via tracheostomy. All rats received 0.9% NaCl 3 ml/hour via a carotid line. Immediately after baseline assessment (T = 0), rats received 1 ml/kg i.v. infusion over 30 minutes (study group (n = 5), endotoxin 10 mg/ml (Escherichia coli O55:B5; Sigma, MO, USA); control group, 0.9% NaCl). Echocardiography was performed (15 MHz transducer, Vivid5; GE Healthcare) at T = 0, 60 minutes (T = 60) and 2.5 hours (T = 150). Measurements included the heart rate, mean arterial pressure (MAP), femoral venous pressure, LV outflow tract diameter and flow (peak velocity (V peak ), cardiac output (CO)), peak early diastolic mitral inflow (E), peak systolic mitral annulus velocity (S\u2032) and E\u2032. Results There was no significant difference in mean \u00b1 SD weight (study 539 \u00b1 88 g, control 504 \u00b1 108 g, P = 0.6) or hemodynamic variables at T = 0. At T = 60, only V peak was higher in the study group compared with controls (1.29 \u00b1 0.24 vs 0.86 \u00b1 0.21 m/s, P = 0.03). The study group demonstrated lower MAP, E and E\u2032 at T = 150 (Table 1) . Introduction The aim of this retrospective study is to evaluate hemodynamic and neurohormonal effects of levosimendan in cardiac patients with sepsis-induced cardiac dysfunction. Septic shock is characterized by profound cardiovascular alterations including myocardial depression. Levosimendan has recently been shown to improve cardiac function in septic shock. Methods Fifteen patients with myocardial depression related to septic shock were enrolled. All patients had SIRS criteria, culture isolation of one or more pathogens, positive procalcitonin, SBP < 90 mmHg unresponsive to load challenge. We defined myocardial depression as a reduced SvO 2 in the presence of increased brain natriuretic peptide secretion and Troponin I release, and systolic and/or diastolic dysfunction by transoesophageal echo evaluation of ejection fraction and mitral annulus tissue Doppler imaging velocities. All patients received levosimendan infusion for 24 hours at 0.1 \u00b5g/kg/min combined with norepinephrine. Results Data were obtained by evaluating the average of the percentage variation between T 0 (starting infusion) and T 1 (24 hours after infusion), T 2 (48 hours), T 3 (72 hours), T 4 (96 hours), T 5 (120 hours) and T 6 (144 hours). Levosimendan significantly increased SvO 2 and ejection fraction, and decreased S16 Troponin I and brain natriuretic peptide. Levosimendan improved diastolic function by increasing the E\u2032 velocity at tissue Doppler imaging at 48 hours. All data were analysed by the Fisher F test. Introduction Sickeuthroid syndrome is very frequent in critically ill patients. Cytokines may have a role in this syndrome. IL-12 is involved in the central regulation of the hypothalamic-pituitarythyroid (HPT) axis during illness. The aim of this study is to evaluate the relationship of IL-12 and thyroid functions in septic patients. Materials and methods Twenty-four septic patients and 18 healthy controls were enrolled into the study with the mean ages of 49.9 \u00b1 20.6 and 45.8 \u00b1 22.3 years, respectively. Hyperthyroid and hypothyroid patients were excluded. Free triiodothyronine (fT3), free thyroxine (fT4) and TSH were measured simultaneously with IL-12.",

Group B. Sepsis was defined in 24/324 (7.4%) patients. PCT > 2 ng/ml was in 53/324 (16%) cases, including all patients with clinically diagnosed sepsis. Early ABT with meropenem, combined with vancomycin or linezolid, allowed one to decrease sepsis-related mortality in these patients to 29%, which used to be as high as 74% before the introduction of this algorithm (P = 0.0028).

Methods One hundred and four nonselect patients were recruited. Patients were excluded if they were admitted during the weekend or from another ICU and if they were on chronic dialysis. Within 4 hours of admission functional data were collected and severity scores (APACHE, SOFA) calculated. Arterial blood samples were also taken and processed according to Spectral Diagnostics' endotoxin activity (EA) assay [1] . The method allows one to express EA as a function of each patient's neutrophil chemiluminescence activity (on a scale from 0 to 1). An EA level of 0.4 is approximately equivalent to an endotoxin concentration of 25-50 pg/ml, and a level of 0.6 is approximately equivalent to a LPS concentration of 100-200 pg/ml. Data were analysed according to EA ranges: low (EA < 0.4), intermediate (0.4 \u2264 EA < 0.6), and high (EA \u2265 0.6). Differences between ranges of EA were assessed by analysis of variance (Sigma Stat, SPSS), accepting P < 0.05 as significant. Data are expressed as the mean \u00b1 SD. Results In our case mix, patients were 68 (65%) in the low group, 17 (17%) in the intermediate group and 19 (18%) in the high group. Age (61 \u00b1 17 years) was not significantly different in the three groups (P = 0.493). Functional and severity scores were not significantly different between groups. Average values were as follows: WBC 11,093 \u00b1 4605 n/mm 3 (P = 0.385), HR 76 \u00b1 16 bpm (P = 0.898), MAP 88.8 \u00b1 13.6 mmHg (P = 0.576), lactate 1.18 \u00b1 0.77 mmol/l (P = 0.370), PaO 2 /FiO 2 383 \u00b1 109 mmHg (P = 0.474), APACHE II score 8.3 \u00b1 3.7 (P = 0.542) and SOFA score 1.5 \u00b1 1.4 (P = 0.245). Interestingly, those patients with higher levels of EA were characterized by longer length of stay in the ICU. The ICU length of stay was 1.9 \u00b1 3.1 days in the low group, 8.7 \u00b1 6.7 days in the intermediate group and 4.7 \u00b1 7.7 days in the high group (P = 0.038).",

Recent evidence suggests that the plasma-free DNA concentration has potential use as a prognostic marker in many clinical situations including sepsis, trauma, and acute stroke [1] . However, its predictive value is arguable. We hypothesized that plasma DNA is increased in septic patients admitted to the ICU compared with nonseptic ICU patients, and it is correlated with disease severity and clinical outcome. Forty-two consecutive patients (11 septic, 31 nonseptic) admitted to a mixed ICU and mechanically ventilated were recruited. Plasmafree DNA concentration was measured by real-time PCR assay for the \u03b2-globin gene, and the APACHE II score, SOFA score, serum C-reactive protein (CRP) concentrations, procalcitonin (PCT) concentrations, serum lipid concentrations, and clinical outcome (ICU/hospital days and mortality) were assessed on admission to the ICU. Assessments and samplings were repeated as the diagnosis of the patients changed (sepsis, severe sepsis and septic shock). Finally, 86 plasma samples were collected. Descriptive statistics, Mann-Whitney U, Kruskall-Wallis and Spearman's tests, and receiver operating characteristic analysis were used when appropriate. Demographic data were similar. ICU and hospital mortalities were 26.2% and 33.3%, respectively. The mean DNA concentrations on admission were significantly higher in ICU patients compared with healthy subjects (n = 11) (13,405 GE/ml versus 390 GE/ml, P < 0.05) and septic patients compared with nonseptic patients (33,170 GE/ml versus 1,171 GE/ml, P < 0.001). Furthermore, during the overall ICU stay, increased DNA concentration associated with the increase of severity of illness was noted; however, this increase was statistically significant only between septic and septic shock samples (26,624 GE/ml versus 42,861 GE/ml, P < 0.05). The area under the curve obtained for the plasma-free DNA concentration in distinguishing between septic and nonseptic patients on admission was 0.9 (sensitivity 84%, specificity, 95%; cutoff 4,083 GE/ml). Also, the plasma-free DNA concentration was found to be higher in patients who died in the ICU compared with patients who survived, although not statistically significant. The DNA concentration demonstrated a significant correlation with CRP (P = 0.037, r = 0.365), PCT (P = 0.007, r = 0.457) and highdensity lipoprotein (P = 0.015, r = -0.415) concentrations.",

The biphasic aPTT waveform (BPW), which results from rapid complexing of VLDL and C-reactive protein during aPTT testing, has demonstrated promise as an early diagnostic test for sepsis. Methods A prospective, observational study was designed in which all patients presenting to the ED of an urban university hospital were screened for SIRS. Patients with SIRS unrelated to trauma or myocardial infarction were eligible. Plasma for BPW testing was obtained at the time of enrollment and daily for 7 days in admitted subjects. The primary outcome was a diagnosis of sepsis related to the presence of a BPW at enrollment. Secondary measures were mortality related to the BPW, correlation of any positive BPW with sepsis, and of the BPW with statin therapy. Two criteria for a positive test, light transmittance at 18 seconds (TL18) and the initial slope of the waveform (slope) are used. Two independent experts made the final diagnosis. Results We screened 5,400 consecutive admissions to the ED, identified 207 eligible subjects and enrolled 105 participants. The BPW was present at enrollment in 12 subjects by TL18 and in 28 subjects by slope. Forty-six out of 105 subjects eventually developed a BPW, 54 were diagnosed with sepsis. The sensitivity and specificity for sepsis were 17% (95% CI, 7-27.6) and 93.8% (95% CI, 87-100) by TL18 and 26.9% (95% CI, 14.9-38.9) and 71.4% (95% CI, 58.7-84.1) by slope.

The development of a BPW at any time during the hospital stay correlates with an increased risk of sepsis and mortality. Baseline statin therapy may reduce the chance of developing a BPW. Objective To know whether functional protein C (FPC) levels in critical septic patients could be intended as an evolution marker correlated with prognosis and mortality. Materials and methods A prospective study with determination of FPC levels in all septic patients admitted to the ICU. We used the IL test\u2122 PC kit (Instrumentation Laboratory; synthetic chromogenic substrate). We considered an abnormal low FPC when levels were below 40%, normal FPC when levels were above 80% and low FPC when levels where between 40% and 80%. Data included patient age, diagnosis, SAPS II, SOFA score, OSF and mortality. The analytical data included serum lactate and FPC. Patients were divided into three groups: group I (FPC below 40%), group II (FPC 40-80%) and group III (FPC above 80%). The statistical study was performed with the Analyse-it \u00ae program. The severity was defined by the usual criteria of SAPS II score and lactate levels and then compared with the different FPC groups. Mortality was considered. Results We included 65 patients. The total mortality rate was 16.9% (11 patients). Conclusions We found a direct and a progressive relation with statistical significance between the higher mortality rate and the lower protein C values. The results could mean that the level of protein C can be used as an evolution marker in septic patients. In severe sepsis, microcirculatory dysfunction caused by inflammation, endothelial activation and procoagulant response leads to mithocondrial dysfunction (termed microcirculatory and mitochondrial distress syndrome). If undetected, this condition can lead to parenchymal cellular distress and so to organ failure. As regional and microcirculatory distress are independent of systemic hemodynamic-derived and oxygen-derived variables, we recorded the course of microvascular parameters with a Microscan Video Microscope (Microvision, The Netherlands) in four patients with severe sepsis. We studied the sublingual region because of its embryologic correlation to splanchnic circulation, its thin mucosa. The instrument used a new improved imaging modality for observation of the microcirculation called sidestream dark-field imaging. We consider here four patients with severe sepsis related to esophagectomy, severe polytrauma with splanchnic organ damage and mediastinitis treated with drotrecogin alpha (activated) (DA) at 24 \u00b5g/kg/hour for 96 hours. The patients were admitted to the ICU, ventilated mechanically, monitored hemodynamically via a PICCO system and supported with dobutamine. Videomicroscopy was made before administration of DA and was repeated every 24 hours during the treatment with DA and at 24 hours after its suspension. We recorded values of blood pressure, cardiac function, lactate levels, acid-base balance, temperature and dobutamine dosage. At admission the sublingual microcirculation showed a low capillary density, vessel heterogeneity with a qualitative low flow and flow-no flow. After the first 24 hours from the beginning of DA infusion, sublingual flow showed an increase of vessel density, particularly of the number of small vessels, and the number of continuously perfused vessels increased during and post therapy with DA. We analyzed the microvascular flow with a simple semiquantitative method dividing the images into four equal quadrants and quantificating flow (hyperdynamic, continuous, sluggish, flow-no flow, no flow) for each cohort of vessel diameter (small, medium, large). We analyzed the mean value of results of three images for each patient pre and post DA therapy. Data are presented as the median. Before starting therapy with DA, the microvascular flow index (MFI) was 2.06 for small vessels, 2.09 for medium vessels, and 2.37 for large vessels. After DA infusion, the MFI was 3, 3, and 3, respectively, for small, medium and large Available online http://ccforum.com/supplements/11/S2 vessels. Differences between groups were assessed using the Mann-Whitney U test. We showed a statistically significant difference with P < 0.0001 between MFI before and post DA therapy. We demonstrated a quantitative and qualitative improvement of sublingual microcirculation with an increase of capillary density distribution (area-width) and average velocity versus vessel width. The course of microvascular blood flow may play an important role in sepsis and septic shock because of its relation to the development of multiple organ failure and death. Several studies have demonstrated that changes in microvascular perfusion are an independent predictor of outcome. The improvement of the microcirculation and vascular tone in septic shock by DA is probably related to its anticoagulant/antithrombotic and antiinflammatory action, to the decrease of TNF\u03b1 production and inhibition of iNOS induction, and to improvement of endothelial barrier function and inhibition of chemotaxis, but further investigations are required to elucidate the exact mechanisms. These observations could suggest that DA could have a particular interest in the early management of severe sepsis. Discussion During 4 years of treatment of severe sepsis in the ICU with APC, important changes were observed: faster recognition and diagnosis, transfer to the reference hospital, and introduction of adequate therapy. The decrease in the surviving ratio in 2006 is probably due to a more serious state of the admitted patients -more initial infection located in the abdomen after surgery. Conclusion The education program is essential in increasing the number of fast recognitions, which influences the surviving ratio.",

However, concerns regarding the potential for serious bleeding events have helped sustain a degree of scepticism regarding the use of DrotAA [2] . As early adopters of evidence-based medicine, Cardiff Critical Care Unit has prescribed DrotAA since late 2002 and has considerable experience with S23 respect to its use. The aim of this study was to demonstrate the safety profile and efficacy of DrotAA treatment within a large, 29bed university hospital critical care unit. Methods Demographic data were obtained from the unit's daily updated Riyadh ICU programme database and clinical data were collected from patients' medical notes and observation charts. All data were prospectively entered into our DrotAA registry, the results of which are shown below. Results Between October 2002 and November 2005, 133 patients with severe sepsis were treated with DrotAA. The mean age was 61 years (range: 20-87 years) and 54% were male. The mean admission APACHE II score was 22 (range: 11-48), and on day 1 of DrotAA infusion the median number of organs that failed was 2.0 (range: 0-4), 129/133 (97%) were mechanically ventilated and 131/133 (98.5%) were on vasopressors. The median time to start DrotAA after documented diagnosis of severe sepsis was 12.6 hours (range: 0-41 hours) and the median duration of DrotAA infusion was 89.5 hours (range: 10-105 hours). The incidence of serious (life-threatening) bleeding events was 2.3% (n = 3): gastrointestinal (n = 1), intraabdominal (n = 1) and intrathoracic (n = 1); all were nonfatal and there were no intracranial bleeds. The 28-day mortality was 31.6%, the ICU mortality was 33.1%, the hospital mortality was 36.8% and the 1-year mortality was 47%.",

This detail, combined with our low median time to start DrotAA infusion (which has steadily decreased over the past 4 years), would suggest the presence of a learning curve for DrotAA usage on ICUs. It is also encouraging to note that our overall hospital mortality was lower than the predicted APACHE II hospital mortality for these patients (36.8% vs 42.4%). Finally, this is one of the first UK studies to describe long-term mortality outcome in patients receiving DrotAA therapy. Further studies are required to more formally assess the impact of DrotAA treatment on long-term survival from severe sepsis. ",

APC has been used in the treatment of IAS in our hospital since 2003. Fears persist regarding the potential for clinically significant bleeding in this surgical subgroup of patients. Methods Forty-four patients with IAS received APC as a standardized regime between March 2003 and August 2006. A retrospective medical and ICU chart review was undertaken. Data collected included clinically significant bleeding episodes and mortality. Descriptive subgroup analysis of unexpected nonsurvivors(died in the ICU with APACHE II (APII) predicted mortality < 50%) and unexpected survivors (survived to ICU discharge with APII predicted mortality > 50%) was performed as statistical analysis of such small patient numbers was inappropriate. Results There was one episode of clinically significant bleeding (from a mucous fistula: self-limiting). There were no intracranial haemorrhagic events. ICU mortality was 38.6% with mean APII predicted mortality of 37.16% and inhospital mortality of 47.7%. These exceeded rates for APC-treated surgical cohorts in the literature [1] . Unexpected survivors (5/44) were more likely to have been admitted from theatre. They had a shorter mean time from hospital-ICU admission (10.5 vs 5.6 days), duration on a ventilator (10.8 vs 17.5 days), vasopressor (9 vs 17.7 days) and renal replacement therapy (10.5 vs 23.5 days) dependence. All unexpected nonsurvivors (11/44) had a diagnosis of fistula or perforation. They were more likely to have been transferred to the ICU from another hospital or ward than from theatre. Comorbidities were more severe. Conclusion 1. APC was very safe to use in this group of critically ill surgical patients. 2. Although patients may fulfil standard criteria for APC use, if there is no definitive surgical cure for the IAS, then APC is inappropriate. 3 . Delay in commencement of APC in surgical patients due to bleeding concerns may be contributing to the high mortality. Earlier perioperative use of APC in selected cases may offer improved mortality benefit, and we are undertaking a prospective audit to investigate this. Results A total of 444 patients were admitted to the ICU with the diagnosis of sepsis or severe sepsis. One hundred and forty-nine severe septic patients were assessed for APC: 85 patients received APC, and 64 patients could not receive APC due to financial problems or due to bleeding, coagulation derangement or very recent surgeries. In the total 444 septic patients admitted to the ICU, 152 patients expired (mortality 34.2%) and 141 had positive blood culture; 233 patients received inotrops. The total average APACHE II score was 28.9 and for expired patients was 35.1.",

We tried to identify how many of the patients with positive blood cultures had evidence of concomitant SIRS/sepsis, as described by the modified Bone criteria, and the severity of this. An attempt was made to identify the most frequent microorganisms involved in this problem as well as their antibiotic susceptibility. As a secondary aim of our study we described the number of fatalities in the patients with bacteraemia. We tried to focus our approach to the fact that we serve a large neurological/surgical population as well as general patients and to see whether we could pinpoint differences in these two groups. Results There were 201 patients admitted to the unit during the period of our study; 140 of these were neurosciences (NS) patients and the rest (61) were general (G) (either medical or surgical). Most of the patients were men and had a mean APACHE II score of 39 (NS group 33, G group 45).There were in total 64 episodes of positive blood cultures (BC); 39 of these episodes were accompanied by inflammatory signs (incidence of bloodstream infections of 19.4% of total admissions). Twenty-five of the episodes were not associated to clinical signs of infection. There were more patients with at least one episode of positive BC in the NS group (29 (20.7%)) than in the G group (10 (16.39%)). Out of 49 episodes in the NS group, 59.18% (29) were associated to some degree of inflammatory response (SIRS, severe sepsis, and MODS). Out of 15 episodes in the G group, 66.6% (10) developed inflammatory response. In 59% (25) of the positive BCs, the organism isolated was coagulase-negative staphylococcus (CNS). In the G group, 47% (7) Due to the specialist origin of our unit, we had more cases in the neurosciences group than in the general group. However, the incidence of sepsis and MOF in these patients was almost the same for both groups. We noted, as well, a larger number of deaths in the patients with sepsis and MOF. There needs to be more studies aiming to establish a casual relationship to explain this. CNS was the most frequently isolated organism and there was no difference among the groups. There is a potential for increased mortality in the patients that develop bloodstream infections in our unit, and we need to implement urgent measures to decrease them while further research is done in this area.",

Results of this study found statistically significant differences between the standard screen and horizons screen participant groups in the speed in which clinicians were able to reach each measured outcome.

Early broadspectrum antimicrobial therapy with appropriate diagnostic studies to ascertain causative organisms is well established; there should be reassessment with the aim of using narrow-spectrum antibiotics to prevent the development of antimicrobial resistance, to reduce toxicity and to reduce costs [1] . In systematic analysis of ward rounds in ICUs the information most commonly missing from a patient's file concerned microbiology findings [2] . . When asked to rate the value of this ward round, the mean score was 8.6 out of a possible 10 (range 10-5, mode 9). In those units without a microbiology ward round the desirability of such a service was scored on average at 8.5 out of 10 (range 10-3, mode 9). Conclusion Direct microbiological advice at the bedside is highly valued by ICU consultants. Antibiotic prescribing is generally well controlled, with two-thirds of units having an agreed antibiotic policy in place. Work will continue to determine whether these results reflect the national picture in the United Kingdom. ",

Some concerns have been raised about the risk of selection of resistant bacteria. We evaluated the impact of a SDD regimen on the incidence of VAP and the development of resistant pathogens. Methods In a polyvalent eight-bed ICU, a retrospective analysis was performed of two periods of 8 months before (no-SDD, 178 patients, mean SAPS II 44.8) and after (SDD, 110 patients, mean SAPS II 48.9) the use of SDD with amphotericin, tobramycin and colistin for oropharyngeal and gastric decontamination and mupirocin for nasal decontamination. The results were analyzed with the chi-square test. Results The incidence of VAP was reduced in the SDD group, even though it was not statistically significant (26.9% vs 16.3%, P = 0.138). The mortality of VAP and septic shock was reduced respectively from 39.6% to 16.7% (P = 0.312) and from 60% to 37.5% (P = 0.835). During the SDD period, Gram-positive infections increased while Gram-negative infections and Candida infections showed a reduction. The percentage of resistant species showed a reduction from 49.1% to 30.5% in all the categories of pathogens (Table 1) . Results Ninety-three CT critical care patients received a tunnelled subclavian CVC. The indications were inotropes (n = 40 (43%)), antibiotic administration (n = 27 (29%)), RRT (n = 14 (15.1%)) and unknown (n = 10 (10.8%)). The mean duration of the catheter remaining in situ was 36 days (SD 44.0, range 1-164). Culture results are presented in Table 1 . Twelve patients had an established CVC-related BSI. The mean infection rate/1,000 catheter-days was 3.6. Results Of 120 catheters inserted, 100 could be evaluated for colonization and CR-BSI. Forty-nine in the uncoated group and 51 in the coated group. Clinical characteristics of patients and risk for infection were similar in the two groups, use of propofol was more frequent in the uncoated group and the presence of a vascular device, other than the study catheter, was more frequent in the antibiotic-coated group. Three RM-coated catheters (5.9%) were colonized compared with nine (18.4%) control catheters (relative risk, 0,28; 95% confidence interval, 0.07-1.096; P = 0.05). Three cases of CR-BSI (5.9%) occurred in patients who received RM catheters compared with five in the control group (10.2%). There was no significant differences in the incidence of CR-BSI between RM-coated and uncoated catheters. Uncoated catheters were more frequently colonized but this difference just failed to show statistical significance. When the duration of catheter placement were taken into consideration, Kaplan-Meier analysis showed no significant differences in the risk of colonization or CR-BSI between RM-coated and uncoated catheters. Rates of CR-BSI were seven per 1,000 catheter-days in the RM-coated group compared with 11.4 per 1,000 catheter-days in the uncoated group (P = 0.7). Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms were similarly responsible for colonizing catheters in our study; there was no difference in rates of colonization by Candida species. Conclusion In this pilot study, we showed a trend toward lower rates of colonization in RM-coated catheters when compared with uncoated control catheters. The incidence and rates of CR-BSI were similar in the two groups, probably because of a small number of catheters studied. Development of a prospective randomized trial with a larger number of patients is underway to confirm or refute these results. ",

Patients with MDRO or Pseudomonas had higher 28-day mortality (RR 1.59, 95% CI 1.07-2.37, P = 0.04) and inhospital mortality (RR 1.48, 95% CI 1.05-2.07, P = 0.05) and a trend towards higher ICU mortality (RR 1.42, 95% CI 0.90-2.23, P = 0.14) than those whose specimens did not grow these organisms. Median duration of MV (12.6 vs 8.7 days), ICU length of stay (16.2 vs 12.0 days) and hospital length of stay (55.0 vs 41.8 days) was greater in patients with MDRO or Pseudomonas than in those whose specimens did not grow these pathogens (P = 0.05). Adequacy of initial empiric therapy was 68.5% in patients whose specimens grew MDRO or Pseudomonas compared with 93.9% in those without these organisms (P < 0.001). Conclusion The isolation of MDRO or Pseudomonas from respiratory tract specimens of patients with suspected VAP is associated with prolonged MV, increased ICU and hospital stay, and increased risk of death. Inadequate initial empiric antibiotic treatment may be a contributing factor.",

            "text": "Introduction Cytokines play an important role in pulmonary host defense. However, nonuniform findings have been reported about the correlation between bronchoalveolar bacterial burden and the lung inflammatory response. Objective The aim of the present study was to evaluate the relationship between bronchoalveolar cytokine expression and bacterial burden in mechanically ventilated patients with suspected pneumonia. Methods Mechanically ventilated patients with suspected pneumonia admitted to the ICU from November 2004 to January 2006 were prospectively enrolled. Fiberoptic bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was performed with 150 ml sterile isotonic saline in three aliquots of 50 ml; local anesthetic was not used. BAL samples for microbiologic quantitative cultures and BAL cytokines -IL-6, IL 8, TNF\u03b1, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and granulocyte-monocyte colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF)were measured. Results Fifty-nine patients were included, and most of the patients (79.7%) had prior antibiotic therapy. Twenty-two patients (37.2%) had a positive bacterial culture defined as a diagnostic threshold >10,000 colony-forming units/ml. Only the concentration of TNF\u03b1 was significantly higher in the group of patients with positive BAL (Table 1) . Conclusions (1) There is a significant correlation between TNF\u03b1 in BAL fluid and the lung bacterial burden. (2) BAL TNF\u03b1 is an early marker of pneumonia in mechanical ventilated patients despite prior antibiotic therapy. Clinical implication Cytokine measurements in BAL may be a diagnostic tool to support the diagnosis of the initial phase of pneumonia. Excluding fungi and unspecified isolates, we had 8/45 multisensitive isolates and 32/45 isolates sensitive to colistin (32), meropenem (26) and gentamicin (21). According to these data in early and late VAP the most adequate therapeutic combination to cover possible pathogens is meropenem + colistin. Using this combination we cover all possible pathogens and then de-escalate according to susceptibility results. Following the ATS/IDSA guidelines we would cover only 8/45 isolates. Conclusions ATS/IDSA [1] guidelines may not be applicable in all institutions or countries and thus clinicians should incorporate local microbiologic data into institution-specific guidelines [2] .",

An historic control group with VAP caused by P. aeruginosa who received initial empiric antibiotic therapy with meropenem by BII (n = 32) was compared with a prospective cohort treated with meropenem by CIA (n = 20) in a 12-bed surgical ICU, at a 400-bed surgical complex of a district hospital. We looked for demography, APACHE II score, mortality, attributable mortality for VAP, days on mechanical ventilation (MV), and ICU length of stay. VAP was treated during 14 days with meropenem (1 g/6 hours intravenously). The antibiotic clinical effect was categorized as cure or failure. Difference between groups were tested by means of Student's t test end exact chi-square test, using the MedCalc program. We consider values of P < 0.05 as a significant difference. Results Significant differences were not found between both groups of patients in sex, age, APACHE II score, and diagnosis. The CIA group showed significantly greater clinical cure than the BII group (CIA 18/20 (90%) vs BII 21/32 965.6%), P = 0.041) and smaller but not significant attributable mortality to VAP (2 of 20 (10%) vs 10 of 32 (31.3%), P = 0.288).

However, indiscriminant use of broad-spectrum antibiotics is associated with the emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, fungal infections, and increased healthcare costs. The purpose of this study was to determine optimal empiric treatment of VAP by comparing a strategy of combination therapy to monotherapy with broad-spectrum antibiotics. Methods In a multicenter trial, we randomized mechanically ventilated adult patients with suspected VAP that developed after 96 hours in the ICU to receive either meropenem and ciprofloxacin or meropenem alone, as initial therapy. In addition, before starting antibiotics, diagnostic specimens were obtained using either bronchoalveolar lavage with quantitative cultures or standard endotracheal aspirates. Results We randomized 740 patients in 28 ICUs in Canada and the United States. The baseline characteristics and etiologies of VAP were similar between groups. There was no difference in 28day mortality between the combination and monotherapy groups (RR = 1.05, 95% confidence interval 0.78-1.42; P = 0.74). The duration of ICU and hospital stay, clinical and microbiological response to treatment, emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, isolation of Clostridium difficile, and fungal colonization were similar between groups. Combination therapy resulted in a higher rate of adequate empiric therapy compared with monotherapy (93.1% vs 85.3%, P = 0.01). In a subgroup of patients with infection due to pseudomonas species, acinetobacter species and multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacilli at enrollment (n = 56), the adequacy of initial antibiotics was 82.4% in the combination group versus 18.8% in the monotherapy group (P < 0.001); this difference was associated with an increase in the microbiological eradication of the infecting organisms (64.1% vs 29.4%, P = 0.05) but no differences in clinical outcomes. Conclusion In patients who have suspected VAP, empiric treatment with combination therapy, as compared with monotherapy, is safe and is associated with a higher rate of adequate antimicrobial coverage but has no effect on clinical outcomes.",

For this purpose, male adult greyhounds were used in an animal research laboratory. Methods The animals were anaesthetised, orally intubated and mechanically ventilated. An inoculum of P. aeruginosa (strain PA01) was instilled into the oropharynx at 1 hour and 8 hours postintubation. The animals were terminated at 78 hours. Results Pneumonia was evaluated based on macroscopic grading and microbiological (bacterial count) findings. We were able to maintain anaesthetic, haemodynamic and respiratory support for the study duration of 78 hours. A monobacterial pulmonary infection was established in four out of five animals. Administration of ceftriaxone 1 g daily effectively suppressed all other bacteria. This allowed proliferation of the single strain P. aeruginosa (PA01) we had inoculated with no culture of other organisms. Conclusions Over a short period of time we were able to reproduce a monoculture ventilator-associated pneumonia in a significant percentage of animals. We successfully developed an animal ICU model that we were able to sustain for 78 hours.

Methods A double-blind, placebo-controlled, study of aerosol AMK delivered via the Pulmonary Drug Delivery System (PDDS \u00ae ; Nektar Therapeutics) in ventilated patients with Gram-negative pneumonia as an adjunctive to i.v. therapy per ATS guidelines. Patients were randomized to receive aerosol containing 400 mg AMK daily with placebo (normal saline) 12 hours later, 400 mg AMK twice daily or placebo twice daily. The i.v. antibiotics (agent and duration) were determined by the attending physician. The AMK peak serum concentration, trough concentrations and tracheal aspirates were drawn. Results The mean number of i.v. antibiotics at the end of the study (mean 7 days) were two times greater with placebo than with twice-daily AMK (P < 0.02) ( Figure 1 ). For daily and twice-daily AMK, the serum C max were 1.3 and 1.8 \u00b5g/ml (respectively) on day 1, and 2.3 and 3.2 \u00b5g/ml on day 3. Mean trough levels were 0.87 and 1.49 \u00b5g/ml. Tracheal aspirate levels (mean) on day 3 were 6.9 mg/ml (daily) and 16.2 mg/ml (twice daily). Aerosol AMK was well tolerated with no difference in adverse events across treatment groups. Conclusion Repeated doses of adjunctive inhaled AMK to mechanically ventilated patients with Gram-negative pneumonia was safe, well tolerated, and associated with less i.v. antibiotic use than placebo. Despite isolation, MRAB spread over and infected eight more patients in separate rooms and different sections of the ICU 32 days later. Further transmission occurred within a few days: three male patients with multiple trauma (42, 20, and 62 years old; patients 2, 3, and 4), cardia carcinoma (female, 66 years old; patient 5), necrotizing pancreatitis (female, 78 years old; patient 6), splenomegaly owing to polycythaemia vera (male, 74 years old; patient 7 -MRAB diagnosis postmortem), rectal carcinoma (female, 76 years old; patient 8 -isolation because of MRSA infection even before) and respiratory failure after gastric banding (female, 41 years; patient 9). All patients suffered from septic shock with high fever, needed high volume replacement and catecholamines several times and prolonged mechanical ventilation. MRAB was isolated in the tracheal secretion or BAL in all patients, in abdominal drainage (patient 6), and in central venous catheter (patient 5). Environmental investigations showed no problematic circumstances. Colistin i.v. is not available in Germany so it had to be procured from the USA, which caused a delay of treatment for a few days. Another delay occurred because of the rapid growing number of patients who needed Colistin. Patients were treated with an adjusted dosage for 16 days. All patients of the ICU were isolated to avoid new infections as a precaution. After convalescence of two patients, all MRAB patients were moved to the IMC, which was converted to an ICU for this period, to isolate infected patients from uninfected. Three out of nine patients died. All these laborious measures with a great expenditure of logistics worked well; no further transmissions were observed. Objectives Gram-negative bacilli including multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (MDR-AB) are responsible for severe ICU-acquired infections, mainly pneumonia and bacteraemia. The aim of this study was to determine the incidence and mortality of this multiresistant strain of Acinetobacter in patients undergoing cardiac surgery, to elucidate the effectiveness of treatment with colistin and to identify whether additional measures were able to prevent and control the dissemination of MDR-AB isolates in our institution. Methods A total of 1,451 patients attended the surgical ICU (SICU) after cardiovascular surgery from 1 September 2005 to 31 August 2006. We reviewed the prophylactic measures of the SICU and tried to identify epidemiological links between MDR-ABinfected patients. We implemented a two-scale multiple program. Scale 1 included classical infection control measures (that is, strict contact and droplet isolation, surveillance of throat, nasal and anal flora for MDR pathogens on all patients transferred from other hospitals, separate nursing staff for each infected or colonized case and strict antibiotic policy), while Scale 2 referred to geographic isolation of MDR-AB cases with exclusive medical and nursing personnel, use of separate supplies and facilities and intense environmental surveillance. Results Fifteen patients were infected by MDR-AB, of which 13 presented respiratory tract infection, one suffered deep surgical site infection and bacteraemia and one from catheter-related infection. They were all treated with intravenous and aerolized colistin in combination with rifampicin or ampicillin and sulbactam.",

Following this infection control strategy we achieved intermittent eradication of the pathogen during a 12-month period with continuous function of the SICU.

Unexpected changes in routine hematology or serum chemistry have not been reported. Methods All patients were managed within the liver ICU and received standard care. Laboratory data were collected daily and entered onto a specialist database. MDRA-positive cultures from blood, bronchoalveolar lavage, drain fluid or samples taken at laparotomy in the context of systemic inflammatory response syndrome resulted in the initiation of tigecycline 100 mg i.v. followed by 50 mg i.v. 12 hourly. Results Eleven patients received tigecycline treatment for MDRA infections (seven male). Ten patients had a single course whilst one patient had three courses. Underlying disease states were necrotising pancreatitis (one), polytrauma (one), post hepatectomy (one), acute and acute on chronic liver failure (four), and postorthotopic liver transplant (four). The median duration of treatment was 9 days (range 4-23 days); courses <7 days were because of patient death (2/11). The mean APACHE II score at initiation of therapy was 18 (range 13-26). Four out of 11 survived to ICU discharge and 3/11 to hospital discharge. Tigecycline was well tolerated but increases in corrected calcium were observed in 9/11 patients. The patient that received three courses of treatment had elevations in corrected calcium after each course. For the 11 patients, the mean corrected calcium before treatment with tigecycline was 2.41 mmol/l. The mean corrected calcium on finishing the course increased to 2.59 mmol/l (P = 0.012). There was no correlation between duration of treatment with tigecycline and degree of change in the corrected calcium level (r = 0.08). Hypercalcaemia resolved on discontinuation of the drug; 7/11 survived >7 days after treatment and had a mean corrected calcium of 2.46 mmol/l, which was not significantly different from pretreatment levels (P = 0.94). Conclusion Tigecycline is well tolerated but appears to be associated with an elevated corrected calcium in critically ill patients. This returns to baseline values on discontinuation of the drug. Introduction The objective of this study was to quantify the impact of continuous venovenous haemodiafiltration (CVVHDF) on aminoglycoside pharmacokinetics and to suggest dosing strategies to improve therapeutic outcomes for these drugs in critically ill patients treated with CVVHDF. There has been limited published data on aminoglycoside pharmacokinetics during CRRT. This data deficit had led to subtherapeutic dosing, identified by a retrospective evaluation of amikacin and gentamicin serum concentrations, in patients treated with CVVHDF, undertaken as part of this research. Methods A prospective pharmacokinetic evaluation of aminoglycoside pharmacokinetics during CVVHDF was undertaken. Pharmacokinetic profiles of once-daily doses of intravenous amikacin and gentamicin were obtained from blood and dialysate/ ultrafiltrate samples for 12 critically ill patients treated with CVVHDF using varying flow rates (1 l/hour dialysate plus 2 l/hour filtration fluid or 2 l/hour dialysate plus 2 l/hour filtration fluid, extracorporeal blood flow 200 ml/min). Drug concentrations were measured using an immunoassay. Results The mean clearance of gentamicin due to CVVHDF was 2.3 \u00b1 0.3 l/hour (82.1 \u00b1 11.3% of total body clearance (TBC)). The sieving coefficient (SC) was 0.85 \u00b1 0.05. The CVVHDF clearance of amikacin was 2.8 \u00b1 0.5 l/hour (93.0 \u00b1 7.8% TBC). The SC for amikacin was 0.88 \u00b1 0.06. The difference in gentamicin clearance versus amikacin clearance reflects differences in CVVHDF conditions. The mean effluent flow rate among the patient sample treated with gentamicin was 2.7 l/hour compared with 3.5 l/hour for amikacin. There was a strong correlation between creatinine clearance by the filter and measured drug clearance (P < 0.001). Individual patient estimates of aminoglycoside pharmacokinetic parameters (k, Vd) obtained during CVVHDF were used to allow appropriate dosage adjustment. Individualized pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic goals (e.g. Cpmax/MIC ratio) were used as indicators of adequate aminoglycoside dosing. The mean gentamicin and amikacin halflives (approximately 8 hours) during CVVHDF therapy were far shorter than those previously reported in the literature for less efficient forms of renal replacement therapy. Failure to adjust for increased aminoglycoside clearance capacity due to CVVHDF carries a risk of subtherapeutic dosing and therapy failure. Conclusion Dosing strategies on the basis of pharmacokinetic analysis of serum drug concentrations, effluent fluid drug concentrations and CVVHDF conditions improved therapeutic outcomes for aminoglycoside drug therapy.",

There are no data to determine the elimination of oseltamivir carboxylate (the active metabolite) by haemofiltration. An in vitro study to determine elimination by measuring the adsorption and sieving coefficient of oseltamivir carboxylate using two haemofilter types was undertaken. Methods An in vitro one-compartment model of continuous venovenous haemofiltration was used. In phase 1 oseltamivir carboxylate adsorption to the haemofilter and circuit was studied by circulating a blood-crystalloid mixture containing clinically relevant concentrations of oseltamivir carboxylate through a haemofilter circuit and returning the ultrafiltrate to the mixing chamber. In phase 2 the ultrafiltrate was removed and replaced with a bicarbonate-based fluid to enable calculation of the sieving coefficient. The study was repeated 10 times with two haemofilter types: polyamide and polyacrylonitrile (PAN). Finally, oseltamivir carboxylate was added to the blood-crystalloid mixture without circulation through the circuit to determine its stability in solution. Blood samples collected were assayed by HPLC-MS/MS. Results Oseltamivir carboxylate remained stable in solution (mean percentage change from baseline at 30 min: +3.97%, at 60 min: +1.91%, at 90 min: +2.36%). The mean \u00b1 SD initial oseltamivir carboxylate concentrations for the PAN (346 \u00b1 85 \u00b5g/l) and polyamide (453 \u00b1 185 \u00b5g/l) showed no significant difference. The mean \u00b1 SD adsorption at 90 min was 58.18 \u00b1 17.84 \u00b5g for PAN and 75.22 \u00b1 36.88 \u00b5g for polyamide haemofilters. There was no statistical difference in adsorption between the haemofilters. The initial drug concentration was a significant predictor of adsorption (r 2 = 0.734). The mean \u00b1 SD sieving coefficient of oseltamivir carboxylate for PAN (1.06 \u00b1 0.04) and polyamide (1.03 \u00b1 0.06) haemofilters showed no statistical difference between the haemofilters. Conclusions Total adsorption is low and unlikely to be of clinical significance. Adsorption and the sieving coefficient are independent of the type of haemofilter membrane. The sieving coefficient of oseltamivir carboxylate is 1, therefore clearance during haemofiltration can be estimated from the ultrafiltration rate. ",

Levels were determined with an Abbott TDx \u00ae /FLx \u00ae analyzer and Seradyn Teicoplanin Innofluor assay kits. Seradyn internal teicoplanin controls were run within and between each batch. Mean trough and peak plasma levels were calculated for 4 days of therapy. Results Seventy-four patients with complete records were analyzed and whilst all patients received an 800 mg loading dose on day 1, 40 received 400 mg twice daily thereafter (BD group) and 34 once daily (OD group), for nosocomial pneumonia (n = 14), skin and soft tissue infection (burn and nonburn including diabetic foot) (n = 13), bacteraemia (n = 10), intra-abdominal infection (n = 8), bone and joint infection (n = 6) and as pre-emptive therapy for severe trauma (n = 13). In the OD group, mean trough levels remained at 9.64 \u00b5g/ml from days 2 to 4 and peak levels remained at a mean of 24.84 \u00b5g/ml.

Because of advanced immune suppression, slower responses to antibacterial treatment, and increased risk of bacteraemia relative to noninfected patients, the choice of initial appropriate empiric antibacterial therapy is an important aspect of care for HIV-infected patients. However, in recent years a dramatic increase of the resistance among Staphylococci to all classes of antimicrobial agents, including glycopeptides, has been reported. Patients and methods We studied 146 patients with skin and soft tissue infections co-infected by HIV and 72 noninfected patients with soft tissue infections aged 18-45 years. All of the patients underwent operations aimed at surgical removal of the dead tissues and pus and received different combinations of antibacterial agents. Twenty-three patients after adequate surgery received Linezolid in doses of 600 mg twice a day intravenously during 3-4 days with oral follow-up of 600 mg twice a day. Results The most frequent pathogens are Staphylococci in both groups of patients with soft tissue infections: 56% was noted among the noninfected patients and 61% among the HIV-infected patients. MRSA was identified in 30% of Staphylococci in HIVinfected patients. Among the patients receiving Linezolid, MRSA was identified in nine cases; in two cases vancomycin-intermediate S. aureus strains, and in one case vancomycin-resistant S. aureus strain. In three cases we revealed Staphylococcus bacteraemia, in one case MRSA bacteraemia in patient with retroperitoneal phlegmon. A statistical difference was identified in duration of high temperature, purulence and wound healing in comparison with patients receiving different combinations of antibacterial agents. All patients receiving Linezolid were discharged from the hospital. The length of stay was 17 \u00b1 1.67 days in comparison with patients receiving other antibacterial agents (from 19.52 \u00b1 1.37 to 20.3 \u00b1 1.46 days). The length of stay in hospital among the noninfected patients with soft tissue infection was 9.5 days. Modification of antibacterial treatment was not required in the group of patients Available online http://ccforum.com/supplements/11/S2 S42 receiving Linezolid. No significant laboratory abnormalities and side effects were noted. We did not reveal statistical differences in the platelet count in group of patients receiving Linezolid (5 days after operation 213 \u00b1 26.0/mm 3 ) in comparison with the group receiving other antibacterial agents (256 \u00b1 32/mm 3 ). Thrompocytopenia is characterized to HIV-infected patients, but did not deteriorate in patients receiving Linezolid Conclusion Linezolid in the complex treatment of HIV-infected patients with complicated skin and soft tissue infections may improve the results of therapy and may be used for initial empirical intravenous-to-oral antibacterial therapy.",

Early detection and prevention of spread is the primary measure to overcome the challenge posed by these difficult to treat ESBL infections. The aim of this study was to find the incidence, risk factors and microbiological and clinical outcome of patients infected with ESBL producing Escherichia coli and Klebsiellae in the ICU of a tertiary care cardiac center in India. Methods A prospective, observational, case-control study of 150 patients was conducted from August 2004 to July 2005. ESBL testing was performed by the phenotypic confirmatory disc diffusion method. Clinical data and risk factors for ESBL acquisition were analysed as well as the antimicrobial therapy, and clinical and microbiological outcomes were studied. Results A high incidence of ESBL producing E. coli and Klebsiellae was observed (85.8%). Meropenem (9.3%) and imipenem (2.8%) resistance in the ESBL producers was seen. On multivariate analysis with logistic regression, a central venous catheter was an independent risk factor for ESBL acquisition (P = 0.01, OR 3.55, 95% CI 1.4-9.02). The median ICU length of stay was 3.5 days and 3 days in the ESBL and non-ESBL groups, respectively. The overall mortality was 13.28% and 13.6% in the two groups, respectively. Microbiological outcomes were similar to clinical outcome, with 83.6% microbiologic success rate among ESBL producers. Conclusion ESBL producing E. coli and Klebsiellae are problematic pathogens in our ICUs. Emergence of carbapenem resistance is of serious concern. Stringent infection control practices such as aseptic insertion and proper handling of central lines within the ICU should be followed by all. Introduction Antibiotic resistance patterns are continually changing; a new problem has been the emergence of Gram-negative bacteria, primarily Escherichia coli and Klebsiellae pneumoniae, producing extended spectrum \u03b2-lactamase enzymes (ESBL). Antibiotic use measures are presumably the most important intervention in preventing their clonal outbreak, and the risk factors for ESBL include intensive antibiotic exposure (especially third-generation cephalosporin monotherapy). The present study was performed to determine the impact of using piperacillin/tazobactum in reducing the acquisition rate of ESBL producing Gram-negative bacteria in the ICU. Methods This open-label, prospective study was carried out in 140 adult patients admitted to the ICU over a period of 9 months, and was divided into two phases. Phase I (pre-intervention phase, 0-3 months): upon admission to the ICU, besides standard investigations, additional rectal swab cultures were taken for detection of ESBL within and after 48 hours of admission, and were repeated every 7 days of the stay in the ICU. Routinely prescribed antibiotics were allowed. Phase II (intervention phase, 4-9 months): this was subdivided into (a) first 3 months (4-6 months): piperacillin/tazobactum was the primary antibiotic used (more than 50% replacement of cephalosporins), and (b) last 3 months (7-9 months): here again, rectal swab cultures were taken and piperacillin/tazobactum was the primary antibiotic used. McNemar's test and Fisher's exact test were used for statistical analysis.",

The incidence of ESBL was 62.3% in phase I and it came down to 34.5% in intervention phase II (P < 0.01). Conclusion Data from this intervention study support the concept that third-generation cephalosporins are of substantial importance in the emergence of ESBL; by decreasing the level of thirdgeneration cephalosporin use and increasing the piperacillin/ tazobactum use, their was a notable reduction in the acquisition rate of ESBL producing E. coli.",

Objective To determine the incidence of colonization and infection by MRSA in critically ill patients. Methods A prospective study during 30 months of the patients admitted to the ICU for 24 hours or more. Throat swab, tracheal aspirate and urine were taken on admission and twice weekly. The colonization and infection by MRSA were registered. The infections were diagnosed according to CDC criteria. The infections were classified based on throat flora as: primary endogenous (PE) when they were caused by germs that were already colonizing the throat on the ICU admission; secondary endogenous (SE) when they were caused by germs that were not colonizing the throat on the ICU admission but were acquired during the stay in ICU; or exogenous (EX) when they were caused by germs that were not colonizing the throat. The infections were classified based on the onset moment: early onset (EO) were those developed during the first 4 days of the ICU stay; and late onset (LO) were those developed 5 days after ICU admission. Introduction An emergency department (ED) is a major hospital entrance and its case mix consists of patients at high risk of both introducing and acquiring infections. Alerted by the rise of hospitalacquired MRSA infections, the ED of a teaching hospital set up an ED infection control (IC) programme. The programme and its impact are discussed. Methods The campaign consisted of the appliance of a proactive MRSA admission screening protocol, selective contact isolation (quarantine) and improving hand hygiene (HH). The MRSA admission screening strategy took into account past medical history or actual suspicion of MRSA carriage, transfers from other hospitals and long-term care facilities and admission of hospitalised patients to the ED for upgrading of care. According to their critical illness status, some patients were subject to quarantine. Improving HH was achieved by promoting alcoholbased hand disinfection, refraining all health care workers (HCW) from wearing hand jewellery or artificial fingernails, supplying HCW with clip watches and by developing promotional material. Education of HCW regarding principles and techniques of HH was provided by the IC department, supervised by link persons selected among medical, nursing and domestic staff. The number of new hospital-acquired MRSA infections per 1,000 admissions was recorded. Compliance to HH was measured by observation, microbiological analysis of total counts of colony-forming units on fingerprints, and by monitoring the consumption of hand-rub solutions (HH moments per patient-care day). Results A selective MRSA admission screening policy increased the carrier detection rate up to 15%, compared with 1-2% in our preoperative outpatient clinic. The observed compliance to HH increased from 49% to 79% and consumption of hand-rub solution from 6 to 33 l per 1,000 patient-days. The number of HH moments increased from 19 to 47. Total counts of colony-forming units less than 50 improved from 39% of the analyses to 55%. Concomitantly, a decrease in MRSA attack rate from six to one new case per 1,000 patient-days was seen. Conclusion An ED tailored selective MRSA screening and contact isolation protocol and a change in HH behaviour in the ED have mainly contributed to a decrease of the MRSA attack rates in our hospital far below the national rate.",

We aimed to describe Candida airway colonization and assess clinical outcomes of patients with a clinical suspicion of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) colonized with Candida. Methods A retrospective post-hoc analysis of the prospective, multicentre VAP study, which enrolled patients with a clinical suspicion of VAP, admitted to an ICU for > 96 hours and on mechanical ventilation (MV) for > 48 hours. Airway cultures were done on randomization. Patients with positive Candida cultures from other sites were excluded. The remaining patients were divided into two groups according to their Candida airway culture status. Demographics, admission diagnosis, comorbidities, PaO 2 / FiO 2 ratio and APACHE II score were recorded at randomization. The length of MV, ICU and hospital stay were compared, as well as hospital, ICU and 28-day mortality. Appropriate parametric statistical tests were applied according to data. Results Of the 739 patients enrolled in the VAP study, 639 were included for analysis: 114 had Candida airway colonization (C) and 525 did not (NC). No significant differences were noted in demographics and APACHE II score (20 \u00b1 6 vs 20 \u00b1 6, P = 0.37) except more frequent admission for sepsis (7.0% vs 2.1%, P = 0.005) and respiratory conditions (21.9% vs 14.3%, P = 0.04) in group C. More colonized patients were on antibiotics at randomization (81.6% vs 56.7%, P < 0.001). A trend for increased S44 ICU (21.1% vs 13.9%, P = 0.06) and 28-day mortality (23.7% vs 16.4%, P = 0.08) and a significant difference in hospital mortality (34.2% vs 21.1%, P = 0.003) was observed in group C. A trend was found for increased median length of ICU stay (14.1 vs 11.6 days, P = 0.07) and duration of MV (10.9 vs 8.1, P = 0.06). Hospital stay was significantly longer (59.9 vs 38.6 days, P = 0.006) in group C. Conclusion Respiratory tract Candida colonization in patients with clinical suspicion of VAP is associated with an increased burden of illness. Whether Candida colonization is responsible for worse outcomes remains to be established. Introduction Candida spp. is the third most common reason for sepsis in the ICU, not differentiating our results from the classic pattern of ICU-acquired infection. Prevention of sepsis development and identification of potentially modifiable risk factors are important goals in intensive care patents. Preemptive treatment of Candida sepsis accepted by some authors is defined as an early antifungal treatment given to patients with evidence of substantial colonization in the presence of multiple risk factors for Candida infection prior to establishing the diagnosis by cultures. Our aim was to form a focused group of patients with significant risk for Candida sepsis; to prove the feasibility and efficacy of our preemptive scheme for antimycotic treatment in order to reduce the risk of development of proved Candida sepsis. Methods During a 2-year period (2005-2006), a study was performed in a 17-bed general ICU, divided into two phases: a case-control retrospective study in which controls comprising a representative subpopulation with severe bacterial sepsis were compared with cases (patients with Candida sepsis) with respect to multiple demographic and clinical factors in a univariate analysis; and a prospective phase creating a preemptive scheme based on results from the retrospective part followed by progressively implementing it among targeted patients. Results Identified were 28 cases with Candida sepsis and 50 controls with severe bacterial sepsis with an all-cause mortality rate of 40.2%. The mortality rate for Candida sepsis was 46.4% with an attributable risk of 10/100 and was associated with a worse score of systemic injury (SAPS II = 51.7 \u00b1 15.0), comparing with a mortality rate of 35.7% and SAPS II = 38.8 \u00b1 13.3 for bacterial sepsis. Candida sepsis was always accompanied by concurrent bacterial sepsis (2.8 \u00b1 1.1 microorganisms/patient isolated from blood cultures). Identified were risk factors with great significance in addition to already known ones: Candida colonization (OR = 3.4), diabetes (OR = 3.2), number of antibiotics used (OR = 2.9), a nothing per os regimen (OR = 2.63), ICU length of stay (OR = 1.97), length of antibiotic use (OR = 1.74), pancreatitis (OR = 1.7), shock at admission (OR = 1.54), ventilator days/ICU stay ratio (days)(OR = 1.4), multiple resistant bacterial strains (OR = 1.5). Patients with gastrointestinal surgery were at risk for development of early fungal sepsis -by the 10th day of admissioncompared with the other clinical cases -by the 21st day of admission. The incidence rate of positive blood cultures for Candida in the group exposed to our scheme was calculated as 6.7% vs 18.5% in the control group.",

            "text": "The aim of the study was to evaluate the incidence of Candida colonization in a cardiac surgical ICU, the predisposing risk factors and the impact of candidemia on outcome. Methods In an effort to answer this question a prospective study was conducted among patients admitted to our 16-bed cardiac surgical intensive care unit ICU during 1 December 2004-30 October 2005. Candida colonization and candidemia were identified. Fungal colonization was defined as colonization index exceeding 0.20 (3 g, at least two samples of seven growing Candida spp.). Candidemia was defined as the isolation Candida spp. in at least one blood culture in a patient with temporally related clinical signs. The demographic characteristics of patients who developed candidemia, as well as the underlying disease and comorbidities, were recorded. Results Over a 22-month period, 2,509 critically ill patients were evaluated. Candida spp. was isolated from any site in 141 patients (5.6%), while 10 patients (0.4%) presented ICU-acquired candidemia. They were all hospitalized for more than 7 days (range 7-34 days) in the ICU and had been exposed to broad-spectrum antibiotics (>3 agents). The mean age was 68 years (range 50-82 years) and the mean ICU stay 28 days. Candidemia appeared at a mean of 15.8 days after ICU admission. Candida albicans was the most common isolated pathogen. Candiduria in any count was detected in 12 patients but none of them experienced candidemia, while in seven patients Candida was isolated from urine and the respiratory tract. Six patients had major postoperative complications. Mortality due to candidemia was 60%. All patients received appropriate antifungal treatment. Prophylactic antifungal treatment was used in patients with multifocality colonization and in patients spending more than 7 days in the ICU after cardiac surgery. Conclusion C. albicans is the most common fungal pathogen in our ICU. Seven percent of colonized patients developed candidemia. Major postoperative complications, excessive antibiotic exposure and acute renal failure seem to predispose to the development of candidemia. Patients with candidemia have high inhospital mortality, perhaps as a reflection of illness severity. Objective To evaluate utilization patterns and outcomes associated with i.v. fluconazole therapy within ICUs in Spain and Germany. Methods A prospective longitudinal observational study was conducted within 14 hospital ICUs in Spain and five in Germany. Patients on i.v. fluconazole therapy were included and were followed over one hospitalization period (admission until discharge). Data were collected during 2004, using electronic case report forms. Data included patient disease characteristics, patient risk status (APACHE scores), type of fluconazole therapy, drug-related adverse events, length of fluconazole therapy, and length of hospital stay. Switches in fluconazole therapy, dosing changes, additional concomitant antifungal therapy, overall mortality, and clinical outcomes were also evaluated. Logistic regression models determined univariate and multivariate associations with mortality. Results A total of 303 patients were enrolled. Fluconazole was used initially as prophylaxis in 29 (9.6%) patients, preemptive therapy in 85 (28.1%) patients, empiric therapy in 140 (46.2%) patients and as definitive therapy in 49 (16.2%) patients. Thirty-six patients switched from fluconazole to a broader spectrum antifungal agent, and seven received a second concomitant antifungal drug. Reasons for switching therapies included lack of response due to suspected resistance, documented resistance or clinical reasons other than resistance. Thirty-two patients (10.6%) experienced fluconazole-related adverse events. The overall study mortality rate was 41.9% (127/303 patients). Mortality was significantly associated with switching i.v. treatment (odds ratio 5.0; 95% CI 2.3-11.1) and the presence of adverse events (odds ratio 4.1; 95% CI 1.8-9.2). Conclusion The observational nature of this study precludes the establishment of any causality. This research merely documents the experiences of ICU patients who have been prescribed i.v. fluconazole therapy. Our results showed high mortality rates in the enrolled ICU patients. Patients developing adverse events and complications requiring a switch in fluconazole experienced worse outcomes Introduction Toxoplasma gondii, a worldwide-distributed parasite, could cause opportunistic infection with high mortality in immunosuppressive individuals. Its association with severe manifestations of immunosuppression has been known for several decades, and the occurrence of encephalitis and disseminated disease has since been observed in different clinical conditions such as lympho-reticular neoplasias, solid organ transplants, and mainly in patients with AIDS [1] . To our knowledge, the toxoplasmosis seropositivity rate in ICU patients who have critical illness induced immunosuppression is not yet investigated. We studied the seropositivity incidence of T. gondii in ICU patients by assessing IgG and IgM antibodies. Materials and methods One hundred and three ICU patients with the mean age of 53.9 \u00b1 13.9 years (51 men, 52 women) and 78 healthy volunteers with the mean age of 51.4 \u00b1 9.2 years (39 men, 29 women) as a control group were included in the study. Anti-T. gondii IgG and IgM antibodies were determined by ELISA. Statistical analyses were done with the chi-square test and Kolmogorov-Smirnov one-sample test. P < 0.05 was considered as statistical significance. Results T. gondii IgG antibodies were positive in 56.3% of ICU patients (n = 58) and in 24.3% of healthy volunteers (n = 19) (P < 0.031). IgM antibodies were positive in 13.8% of ICU patients (n = 15) and in 6.4% of healthy volunteers (n = 5); however, this difference could not reach statistical significance. increased mortality in CMV+ patients, although CMV disease did not occur. There was a striking difference between the groups in respect to the period on ventilator: 21.5 days vs 8.0 days (median) in CMV+ and CMV-patients, respectively (P < 0.005). Similarly, CMV+ patients had a longer median LOS after enrollment either in the ICU (29.5 days vs 10 days, P < 0.001) and in the hospital (49 days vs 23 days, P < 0.001). This difference was assured when the analysis was restricted to survivors. Conclusion Our data suggest that CMV reactivation leads to increased morbidity and treatment expenditure independently from CMV disease. Further analysis points at a crucial role of lung pathology due to CMV reactivation.",

These were repeated on day 3 (D3), day 7 (D7) and discharge (D/C). Routine bloods ordered were also used. Data on the ICU charts were also used. No changes to ICU protocols were required. Of note, insulin infusions were started for blood glucose concentrations greater than 6 mmol/l. Exclusion criteria included all patients with diabetes mellitus, chronic renal failure and liver failure or cirrhosis. Results Forty patients admitted to the ICU were enrolled and followed up to discharge. The median age was 35.5 years (minimum 18, maximum 66). The median APACHE II score was 10.5 (minimum 2, maximum 28) and the median duration was 6 days (minimum 1, maximum 43).

As Adipo increases, insulin needs are decreased (inverse correlation with InsAd). Also, TNF contributes to increase TG indicating increased free fatty acids (FFA) by lipolysis, which impairs glucose clearance. Adipo, an insulin sensitizing protein, is known to negatively regulate TNF levels as was indicated by our study. Adipo contributed to a decrease in TG indicating lower FFA and better glucose clearance. IL-6 at D/C also contributed to a higher glucose concentration at D/C. Increasing age contributed to lower Adipo levels at D/C, indicating lower insulin sensitivity. A higher BMI contributed to a higher glucose level at D0 and increased insulin needs at D0. Finally, a higher TNF level appears to be related to increased mortality Objective The aim of the study was to investigate the effectiveness of octreotide at different doses in reducing the hypoglycemic attacks and the need for dextrose in treatment of refractory and recurrence hypoglycemia related to the toxicity of sulfonylurea. Methods In the study, 40 New Zealand type of rabbits were used weighing between 2,500 and 3,000 g. The rabbits were randomly divided into four groups consisting of 10 animals. All the animals were given gliclazide 100 mg orally. For the treatment of hypoglycemic attacks in Group I, only 15 cm 3 50% dextrose (7.5 g) intravenously (i.v.) was used; in Group II, Group III and Group IV octreotide 25 \u00b5g, 50 \u00b5g and 100 \u00b5g single doses were used subcutaneously, respectively. Octreotide was given in Groups II and III and Group IV at the eighth hour (when hypoglycemic attacks onset). Groups II, III and IV were given an additional 15 cm 3 50% dextrose (7.5 g) i.v. infusion for each hypoglycemic attack developed. Following the toxic dose, animals were given the amount of dextrose used before and after octreotide administration and the number of hypoglycemic attacks were recorded.

By triggering a cellular energetic dysfunction, and by promoting proinflammatory gene expression, PARP activation significantly contributes to the pathogenesis of shock. The activation of PARP is usually triggered by DNA strand breakage, which is typically the result of the overproduction of reactive oxidant species. In the present study we tested whether endotoxin-induced PARP activation and pro-inflammatory mediator production can be modified by insulin therapy. Rats subjected to bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) with or without insulin pretreatment were studied. LPS-induced PARP activation in circulating leukocytes was measured by flow cytometry, and production of TNF\u03b1 was measured by ELISA. LPS induced a significant hyperglycemic response, activated PARP in circulating leukocytes and induced the production of TNF\u03b1. Insulin treatment prevented the LPS-induced hyperglycemic response, blocked the activation of PARP and blunted the LPS-induced TNF\u03b1 response. As hyperglycemia is known to induce the cellular formation of reactive species, we propose that PARP activation in endotoxin shock occurs as a result of hyperglycemia-induced reactive oxidant and free radical generation. The current findings may have significant implications in the context of the emerging concept of tight glycemic control for critically ill patients.",

Recently, we reported improved survival and prevention of MOF of critically ill patients with the use of intensive insulin therapy to maintain normoglycemia for at least several days [1, 2] . We hypothesize that intensive insulin therapy also prevents severe coagulation abnormalities, thereby contributing to less organ failure and better survival. We studied a subgroup of long-stay critically ill patients with a respiratory disease upon ICU admission, who had been enrolled in a randomized controlled trial evaluating the impact of intensive insulin therapy in medical ICU patients [2] . Plasma samples were analyzed for a panel of coagulation markers (prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, fibrinogen and D-dimer levels) that were used to assign points towards the International Society of Thrombosis and Haemostasis overt disseminate intravascular coagulation (DIC) score. Circulating plasma thrombin-antithrombin complexes and plasminogen inhibitor type 1 levels were also determined.

There was no effect of insulin therapy on any of the fibrinolytic, coagulation or inflammatory parameters tested.

Also, circulating plasminogen inhibitor type 1 or thrombin-antithrombin complexes levels did not correlate well with mortality or DIC score. These findings indicate that the coagulation system did not play a key role in mediating the survival benefit of intensive insulin therapy. Introduction Intensive insulin therapy reduces morbidity and mortality in postoperative critical care; however, this treatment also increases the risk of hypoglycemia. A possible cause for unstable blood glucose (BG) levels could be a variable adsorption of insulin at plastic material of infusion tubings. We evaluated in vitro and in vivo the adsorption of insulin at standard tubing materials (polyethylene (PE) and polyurethane (PU)) and the effects of this adsorption process on blood glucose levels. Methods (1) In vitro, a standard perfusor syringe (Perfusor \u00ae ; BBraun, Germany) was filled with 50 IE normal insulin (Actrapid \u00ae ; NovoNordisk, Germany) dissolved in 50 ml saline 0.9%. The syringe was connected to PE or PU tubings (BBraun) and, at an infusion rate of 1 ml/hour, the insulin concentration in the syringe and at the end of the tubings was measured at hourly intervals for 5 hours and again after 24 hours by the Bradford protein assay.

All blood BG values, total infused insulin solution volume, and critical care scores were documented and statistically analysed by the Wilcoxon test. Results (1) The insulin concentration in all syringes was always >97% of the estimated value. The initial concentrations of insulin at the end of PE and PU tubings were lower than expected (23 \u00b1 4% of anticipated concentration in the first 6 min). In PE, the concentration rose to 37 \u00b1 2% and in PU to 78 \u00b1 4% after 24 hours (P < 0.0001). (2) In vivo the mean BG values did not differ between PE and PU (PE 141 \u00b1 17 mg/dl; PU 132 \u00b1 23 mg/dl (not significant)). Severity of illness was not different between the groups: TISS 37 \u00b1 5 (PE) vs 39 \u00b1 5 (PU), SAPS 43 \u00b1 13 (PE) vs 41 \u00b1 15 (PU) on both days; neither were catecholamine doses and 24-hour fluid balance. However, significantly more insulin solution was infused in PE (66 \u00b1 18 ml/ 24 hours) compared with PU (44 \u00b1 15 ml/24 hours) (P = 0.0015). Conclusion Infusion of insulin using PE and PU tubings leads to a relevant adsorption of the drug in both materials. Adsorption to PE is significantly higher compared with PU. Thus, a large variation of insulin application to the patient is possible if different tubing materials are used. Furthermore, variability of adsorption, a competitive adsorption with other drugs if insulin is not infused via a single line as well as changes of effective insulin application following routine change of tubings, may be one cause of unexpected hypoglycemia that can be deleterious to the patient. Introduction Hyperglycemia in critically ill patients is frequently related to a hypermetabolic stress-response and has been associated with increased morbidity and mortality. The aim of this study was to assess the relationship between blood glucose levels and clinical outcome in a mixed cohort of critically ill patients with a nosocomial bloodstream infection (BSI). Methods A retrospective observational cohort study was conducted including 130 adult patients with a microbiologically documented BSI admitted over a 2-year period (2003) (2004) to the ICU. Blood glucose levels were evaluated from 1 day prior to onset of BSI (d-1) until 5 days after onset of BSI (d+5). The contribution of hyperglycemia, divided into three subgroups (\u2265150 mg/dl, \u2265175 mg/dl, and \u2265200 mg/dl, respectively), to inhospital mortality was estimated by logistic regression.",

Conclusion The automated discontinuous blood withdrawing system provides reproducible blood samples from peripheral venous blood. In combination with a glucose sensor and an algorithm it might be used in future as a closed loop system for insulin and glucose infusion at the ICU. Introduction It has been proposed that intensive insulin therapy (IIT) aiming for a blood glucose (BG) of 4.4-6.1 mmol/l reduces mortality in critically ill patients when compared with conventional insulin therapy (CIT) targeting BG at 10.0-11.1 mmol/l. Difficulties with IIT include inadvertent hypoglycaemia and low efficacy at achieving the target BG. We proposed that computerised decision support may mitigate these problems. Objective To comprehensively describe BG and outcome from decision-supported IIT. Methods A clinical information system at each bedspace guided staff through the IIT algorithm. The time spent within glucose ranges was calculated assuming a linear trend between successive measurements. Results Patient characteristics are shown in Table 1 . The IIT group had more frequent BG evaluation (7,007 over 8,944 patient-hours, 0.78 tests/hour) than the CIT group (3,609 over 8,617 hours, 0.42 tests/hour). The median (interquartile range (IQR)) proportion of time spent in the target range 4.4-6.1 mmol/l was similar in the IIT and CIT groups (23.21% (15.4-29.8) vs 17.9% (9.8-29.3), respectively; P = 0.17). Similarly, time spent with a BG between 6.2 and 7.99 mmol/l was no different for the two groups (48.5% (IQR 36.9-59.3) for IIT and 43.9% (IQR 34.7-60.9), P = 0.72). In the IIT and CIT groups, five and six patients experienced a BG below 2.2 mmol/l, respectively. Discussion Computerised decision-support and more intensive monitoring did not improve BG control or reduce the incidence of hypoglycaemia. Introduction The objective of this study was to determine the efficacy and safety of subcutaneous (s.c.) once-daily (OD) glargine insulin, a long-acting insulin, in comparison with a s.c. regular insulin, based on a protocolized sliding scale regimen for achieving glycemic control in patients admitted to the ICU. Methods One hundred patients admitted to the ICU with an admission capillary blood glucose (CBG) >150 mg/dl (8.3 mmol/l) were involved in this prospective, randomized study. Patients with age <18 years, pregnancy, shock, requiring continuous intravenous insulin infusion, renal failure were excluded. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either s.c. glargine insulin 10 U (CBG \u2264 9.9 mmol/l) or 18 U (CBG \u2265 10.1 mmol/l) s.c. OD (Group G, n = 50), or s.c. regular insulin based on a 6-hourly sliding scale (Group R, n = 50). CBGs were recorded at 6-hour intervals up to 96 hours or until ICU discharge, whichever was earlier. The target CBG in both groups was <150 mg/dl (8.3 mmol/l). Patients in group G received rescue doses of regular insulin, as required. Demographic characteristics, mean and median CBG, and episodes of hypoglycemia were studied. Results Demographic profiles were comparable between the two groups. There was no significant difference in mean CBG in both groups (Group G 152.1 mg/dl (8.4 mmol/l), Group R 149.9 mg/dl (8.3 mmol/l), P = 0.66). Median CBGs were comparable at 6hourly time points in both the groups except at 0 and 6 hours in the glargine arm (CBG at 0 and 6 hours, Group G 10.0 mmol/l and Median capillary blood glucose (CBG) at different time points. S53 9.9 mmol/l, Group R 9.4 mmol/l and 8.3 mmol/l, P = 0.04 and 0.02, respectively) ( Figure 1 ). There were three episodes of hypoglycemia in Group G and one in Group R, which were corrected. Conclusion OD s.c. glargine insulin is a safe and effective alternative to regular insulin for glycemic control in critically ill patients.",

We investigated relationships among insulin clearance (IC), which is considered to be one of the factors related to effectiveness of insulin therapy, and glucose tolerance, glucose intolerance, and severity of the diseases, in order to clarify the significance of IC on the severity of the diseases including glucose intolerance and on the therapies. Materials and methods Twenty-three ICU patients with glucose intolerance in whom strict blood glucose control was performed by means of a bedside-type artificial pancreas (NIKKISO Corp., Japan) were investigated. The diabetics were excluded. The items investigated were IC (ml/kg/min) measured by the glucose clamp method, daily mean blood glucose level as a parameter of glucose intolerance (BGm, mg/dl), proportion of septic patients (%), SOFA score and mortality (%) as indicators of the severity of the diseases, and blood concentration of free fatty acid (FFA) and stress hormones (glucagon, growth hormone, cortisol, adrenalin, noradrenalin) as factors that might affect glucose intolerance. The method of investigation involved patients being classified into four groups according to IC, and those groups were compared with each other; low IC group (group L: IC < 9, n = 2), normal IC group (group N: 9 < IC < 15, n = 13), high IC group (group H: 15 < IC, n = 8), and severely high IC group (group S: 19 < IC, n = 5) (group S was a subgroup of group H). Results (1) FFA values were low or normal in all groups. (2) There were no significant differences in stress hormones among group N, group H, and group S. Those hormones in group L were significantly higher than, or had a tendency to be higher than, those in group N, group H, and group S. (3) The mean values of BGm in the groups had a tendency to be higher in the order of group S (179 \u00b1 30), group H (172 \u00b1 25), group N (162 \u00b1 26), and group L (153 \u00b1 8). (4) The severities of the diseases (sepsis (%)/SOFA score/mortality (%)) in the groups were significantly higher in the order group L (100%/20.0 \u00b1 1.4/100%), group S (100%/ 9.6 \u00b1 7.0/40%), group H (88%/7.0 \u00b1 6.5/25%), and group N (54%/5.8 \u00b1 5.2/15%).",

In the most severe state, or in a near-terminal state, however, IC decreased and glucose intolerance improved, although stress hormones increased significantly. Therapies focused on the improvement of IC were considered important in acutely ill severe patients with glucose intolerance as well as blood glucose control by insulin therapy. Results We compared the 6:00 a.m. glucose value with those collected at all other times in 149 consecutive patients. The 6:00 a.m. values were lower than the remaining values (mean \u00b1 SD: 112 \u00b1 30 mg/dl (n = 477) vs 119 \u00b1 35 mg/dl (n = 10,364); P < 0.0001) and as hypothesized had a smaller variance by F test (P < 0.0001). Inspection of the time-averaged data (\u00b1SE) revealed a diurnal variation in the blood glucose with peaks occurring at 11:00 a.m. and 10:00 p.m. (Figure 1 ). This diurnal pattern may account for some of the observed variation in insulin requirements and contribute to episodes of hypoglycemia in the critically ill. Conclusion Glucose variance is increased if all time values are considered rather than a single time point and there is a diurnal pattern to glucose in ICU patients receiving insulin. Consideration of this diurnal variation when treating hyperglycemia in the ICU may avoid hypoglycemia and so facilitate better glucose control with insulin infusions.",

All patients treated between 7 February 2005 and 30 June 2006 were included in the study. A nurse-driven intensive insulin protocol with a target blood glucose level of 4-6.1 mmol/l had been introduced in 2004. All blood glucose measurements performed during the ICU treatment were analysed. The patients were divided into two groups according to the lowest detected blood glucose value (\u22642.2 or \u22652.3 mmol/l). Results A total of 1,024 patients (1,124 treatment periods) were included in the study. Thirty patients were excluded due to incompleteness of the data. During the study period 61,203 blood glucose measurements were performed, 1,578 (2.6%) of which were below the target value of 4 mmol/l. Severe hypoglycaemia (\u22642.2 mmol/l) occurred in 25 patients (36 measurements). The incidence was 0.059% of the measurements and 2.3% of the patients. The median age, sex, APACHE II score, SAPS II or diagnosis category did not differ between the groups. The median (IQR) ICU and hospital length of stay was 4.3 (1.8-10.6) and 18 (8.5-39.5) days in patients with lowest blood glucose \u22642.2, and 2.7 (1.2-5.7) and 13 (7-23) days in patients with lowest blood glucose \u22652.3 (P = 0.058 and P = 0.077, respectively). The hospital mortalities were 25% and 15%, respectively; the difference was not statistically significant. Introduction Insulin resistance and hyperglycemia are common in critically ill patients, and are associated with higher morbidity and mortality in these patients if not controlled. Intensive insulin therapy has been shown to reduce morbidity and mortality. It is not clear, however, whether the patients' indication for admission into the ICU is related to the time to achieve glycaemic control or the total dose of insulin required. This study was designed to audit the efficacy of an intensive insulin therapy protocol in achieving glycaemic control in patients presenting with different conditions. Methods A prospective observational study was performed over 8 weeks on patients admitted to an adult ICU who received nutrition support for up to 48 hours. Intensive insulin therapy was administered to those patients who developed hyperglycemia. The demographics, blood glucose and insulin doses were documented. Haemoglobin, white cell count, neutrophil count, antioxidants, CRP and prealbumin were measured. Outcome measures were the mean and total insulin dose and the time to achieve glycaemic control.",

Enteral feeding was given in 32 (80%) and parenteral feeding in 14 (35%) patients, while six (15%) patients received both enteral and parenteral feeding. The mean (SD) energy in 48 hours was 3,307.4 (527.0) kcal, mean (SD) insulin was 1.37 (1.23) IU, mean (SD) blood glucose was 7.76 (0.9) mmol/dl and total insulin to achieve glycaemic control was 65.51 (58.6) IU. The time taken (SD) to achieve glycaemic control was 15.16 (12.65) hours. As expected, there was a relationship between the total insulin dose and the time to achieve three consecutive glycaemic controls (r = -0.43, P = 0.023). Also, between the total insulin dose and mean blood glucose r = 0.508, P = 0.001. There was no significant relationship between the total insulin dose and indication for ICU admission, and the total insulin dose and body mass index. Conclusion Findings from this study showed that the indication for admission did not affect either the total dose of insulin required to achieve glycaemic control or the time it takes to achieve three consecutive glycaemic controls. Introduction Glycaemic control is another example of protocoldriven therapy in intensive care medicine to improve outcome in critically ill patients.

            "text": "Since insulin sensitivity showed enormous variability, glycaemic control required a high nursing effort. Impeding aspects to titrate blood glucose into the target range were the absence of a nutritional protocol (high carbohydrate intake, despite inflammation/infection leading to hyperglycaemia that was difficult to S55 control) and fear of hypoglycaemia (<60 mg%) leading to low-dose insulin with consecutive hyperglycaemia. Lack of communication (and therefore a loss of information) between critical care nurses and the intensivists and poor acceptance from physicians to leave this field of intensive care medicine to the nurses were additional factors that slowed the implementation process. Conclusion Implementation of protocol-driven medicine requires a high quality of information flow. The lack of linearity between blood glucose and insulin dose (variability of insulin sensitivity) required a sometimes intuitive (experienced) decision to titrate the insulin dose. The conflict of physicians with this new role of critical care nurses might be due to the lack of understanding of the evolution of the nursing profession. Introduction Tight blood glucose (BG) control has been shown to decrease morbidity and mortality in patients in the surgical ICU [1] but is difficult to achieve using standard insulin infusion protocols. We previously evaluated a software model predictive control (MPC) insulin administration algorithm in postcardiac surgery patients [2] . This study investigated the use of an enhanced MPC algorithm (eMPC) in more severely ill patients over 72 hours. Methods Fourteen (seven male) critically ill ventilated medical and surgical patients, mean age 65 years, with an arterial BG > 6.7 mmol/l within 24 hours of ICU admission (RBH) or already receiving insulin infusion, and expected to require mechanical ventilation for more than 72 hours, were treated either with BG control by the standard ICU insulin intravenous infusion protocol [2] or eMPC-advised insulin infusion (n = 6) for 72 hours. The eMPC algorithm, installed on a bedside computer, requires input of current insulin requirements, bodyweight, carbohydrate intake and BG concentration. The algorithm advises the time to next BG sample (up to 4 hours) and the insulin infusion rate, targeted to maintain BG at 4.4-6.1 mmol/l. Patients in the eMPC group had BG measured hourly (for safety) but values were only entered if requested by the algorithm.",

Fast and precise glucose measurements are therefore mandatory. Our aim was to evaluate the accuracy of two methods of bedside point-of-care testing for glucose measurements using arterial, capillary and venous blood samples in ICU patients. Methods A cross-sectional study with prospective data collection included 86 patients admitted to a 40-bed clinical-surgical ICU of a tertiary care hospital. Results from two different methods of glucose measurement were compared with central laboratory arterial blood measurements: Accu-chek Advantage \u00ae (Roche) arterial, venous and capillary samples; and Precision PCx \u00ae (Abbott) arterial samples. All samples were collected simultaneously. Agreement between measurements was tested with the Bland-Altman method. Results Comparisons between pairs of measurements are shown in Figure 1 . Conclusions The two glucose meters evaluated might not be sufficiently reliable to be used in the ICU setting, especially for patients under strict blood glucose control. Moreover, there are marked differences between the equipment and a decrease in precision if capillary or venous samples are used. Introduction Implementing tight glycaemic control (TGC) in the ICU requires accurate blood glucose (BG) monitoring. We evaluated the performance of two bedside glucometers (GM) in ICU patients. Methods Four hundred and fifty-two arterial blood samples were prospectively analysed in 37 adult ICU patients subjected to TGC. Arterial BG was simultaneously determined using a reference test (ABL \u00ae ) and two GM (Accu-Chek \u00ae and HemoCue \u00ae ). Data were Results Correlation between the reference method and both GM in the overall BG range was reasonable, but not perfect (r 2 \u2265 0.93). This was further underlined by BA analysis (Figures 1 and 2) , showing a bias to overestimate BG with GM. In the TGC range (80-110 mg/dl) correlation was low for both GM (r 2 \u2264 0.66). This was confirmed by BA analysis, demonstrating broad limits of agreement: +14.2 and -26.6 mg/dl for Accu-Chek \u00ae and +5.5 and -31.1 mg/dl for HemoCue \u00ae .",

Currently investigated is whether the subcutaneous tissue is an adequate and representative site for glucose monitoring. We have designed and tested a novel system that allows continuous measurement of glucose concentration in whole blood based on MD. Methods Na-heparin is pumped to the tip of a double lumen catheter and the blood-heparin mixture is withdrawn continuously at a mixing ratio of 1:1 at a flow of 4 ml/hour. The blood-heparin mixture is microdialysed in a planar flow-through MD unit and is discarded thereafter. The dialysate is collected and analysed for glucose concentration via Beckman analysis and referred to venous blood samples taken from the reference arm. Eight healthy volunteers underwent a 12-hour investigation including an OGTT. Glucose readings from dialysate and venous blood were obtained in a 15-30 minute interval. Results All eight subjects successfully completed the 12-hour trial. The coefficient of correlation between continuously withdrawn microdialysed blood and venously taken reference blood samples was r = 0.9834 (0.9753-0.9958). The Clark Error Grid Analysis (EGA) revealed that 99.5% of all data pairs are in the A range (220 of 221). Applying the novel Insulin Titration EGA yielded in 100% of data pairs the 'acceptable treatment' area. Conclusions Blood MD based on continuous blood withdrawal and extracorporeal MD is a promising approach to obtain dialysate reliably, safely and continuously for long-term determination of blood glucose concentration with online sensors. The correlation between glucose concentration of dialysate and reference venous blood samples is excellent. The patency of the double lumen catheter in the current form could be improved by introducing Available online http://ccforum.com/supplements/11/S2 Introduction Early adequate nutritional support (NS) in critically ill patients can improve clinical outcome [1] . Although enteral nutrition is considered the best method, it carries a risk for developing ventilator-associated pneumonia, particularly if patients are nursed horizontally [1] . The aim of this prospective audit is to assess the compliance of nutritional practise in our ICU with some aspects of recommendations of Canadian Clinical Guidelines. Method Demographic data, head elevation (HE) from the horizontal position, daily nitrogen and calorie intake were recorded. Daily recommended calorie requirements were calculated according to body weights on admission. The nasogastric tube size and the gastric residual volume threshold (GRVT) before abandoning enteral feeds were also recorded. Results During 2 months 55 patients (male 47%, female 53%) were admitted, including 47 (85%) emergency admissions. Thirtythree (60%) patients stayed in the unit for >48 hours with an average stay of 7.1 days. Thirty-two (58%) patients received NS, and 26 (81%) of these were within 48 hours of admission. Enteral and parenteral routes were used in 26 (81%) and six (18%) patients, respectively. In five (15%) patients both methods were used during the change of route of administration. The daily calorie intake expressed as a percentage of the recommended intake is presented in Table 1 . HE was more than 300 in 70% of the 570 measurements. Blood sugar was between 6.3 and 6.9 mmol/l. Gastro Prokinetics was used in 80%. There was no feeding protocol in the unit and low GRVTs were used before abandonment of the enteral regime. Results Thirty-one patients were included. Figure 1 shows the PDR of all patients under the different prokinetic drugs. Table 1 presents the average percentage of GE improvement over BM with different therapies, and the average improvement of individuals' best combination. Comparing 20 patients, BM first, with 11 at different timings, revealed no difference of baseline or best combination (P = 0.1, P = 0.2, respectively). Conclusions In this population: 1. Metoclopramide is poor in improving GE. 2. The combination of metoclopramide and continuous erythromycin is the most effective. 3. The BreathID is a convenient and novel way to monitor GE in order to study and individually tailor the most effective (up to 85% over BM) prokinetic combination. Introduction For critically ill patients unable to eat, enteral tube feeding (ETF) is the preferred mode of feeding. The study aimed to investigate the amount of enteral feed obtained by patients on ICU in a busy London Teaching Hospital, the efficiency of initiation of feeding, and possible reasons for the failure of the above. Methods A prospective observational study was carried out over 1 month on patients admitted to a general and cardiothoracic ICU, who received ETF. Baseline data including age, reason for admission and illness severity score (SOFA) were documented. Length of time from admission to start of feeding was noted, and the volume of feed delivered to patients was recorded. The quantity of calories delivered to the patient was compared with the patient's ideal nutritional requirement (determined by the ICU ETF protocol). Feeding interruptions were also recorded.",

Corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) in peripheral blood/tissue may induce intestinal barrier dysfunction via receptor-mediated mechanisms independently of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. This mechanism seems to involve interactions of CRF with enteric nerves and mast cells, which results in increased gut intercellular tight junction permeability to macromolecules, as well as increased epithelial cell apoptosis leading to loss of mucosal integrity. We investigated whether blood and intestinal tissue CRF is associated with postoperative gut dysfunction in shock. Methods CRF analysis was performed on full-thickness bowel specimens obtained from shocked trauma patients requiring emergency abdominal surgery for penetrating injury, and from patients undergoing small bowel resection during elective bowel surgery. Venous blood was taken before anaesthesia, intraoperatively and on postoperative day 1. CRF extracted from tissue and blood was quantified using radioimmunoassay. On day 1 postoperatively, intestinal permeability was tested by urinary lactulose:mannitol (L:M) measurement. Institutional ethical approval was granted and patients gave written informed consent. Results Trauma patients (n = 6, male/female = 6/0, age 27 \u00b1 10.2 years, ISS 23 \u00b1 6.8) were younger than elective patients (n = 6, male/female = 4/2, age 52.8 \u00b1 7.7 years, P < 0.0006), and had significantly lower mean tissue [CRF] (0.034 \u00b1 0.015 x 10 -3 % total protein (TP)) than elective patients (0.117 \u00b1 0.075 x 10 -3 %TP, P = 0.023).

There was a 1. Background The aim of this study was to determine the effect of propranolol on infections and clinical parameters during the acute phase postburn. Severe thermal injury is followed by a period of hypermetabolism that is directly proportional to the size of insult sustained. Infection and multiorgan failure are now the leading cause of death from severe thermal injuries. Propranolol, an anticatabolic agent, improves hypermetabolism postburn. However, there is evidence that propranolol worsens immune function and increases the incidence of infection in critically ill patients. Methods Sixty-six patients with burns >40% total body surface area were enrolled into the study and randomized to receive standard burn care (controls, n = 33) or standard burn plus propranolol for more than 21 days (propranolol, 0.5-1.5 mg/kg every 6 hours, n = 33). Biopsies were taken three times a week for microbiological determination. Clinical parameters were collected and blood was drawn at regular intervals throughout the hospital course and analyzed for IGF-1, IGFBP-3, and HGH. Patients underwent weekly resting energy-expenditure measurements. Statistical analysis was performed using analysis of variance with Bonferoni's correction and Student's t test where applicable. Results Propranolol treatment reduced heart rates by 10% and significantly improved stroke volume throughout the acute hospital stay compared with controls (P < 0.05). Resting energy expenditure was significantly decreased in the propranolol group when compared with controls at discharge (P < 0.05). Infection rates on admission were the same for both groups (17% propranolol vs 22% control). The incidence of infection throughout hospital course was significantly lower in the propranolol group (60%) compared with controls (87%) (P < 0.05). Propranolol significantly increased IGF-I, IGFBP-3, GH, and prealbumin, while it significantly decreased CRP and fatty acids (P < 0.05).",

Near the end of the surgery procedure a percutaneous jejunostomy was performed in 20 patients (G1), and enteral nutrition started on the first postoperative day with small doses of immunonutrient (Reconvan) 10 ml/hour. After every 12 hours the tolerance was estimated (abdominal distension, diarrhoea, vomiting). After every 24 hours the immunonutrient dose was increased by 20 ml/hour until we reached the maximum of 80 ml/hour. In the first three postoperative days the patients were also administered total parenteral nutrition, and after that only enteral nutrition. The other group of 20 patients (G2) was administered only parenteral nutrition from the first postoperative day. Preoperatively, every patient was measured for body weight, body height and body mass index, and using laboratory tests we established the levels of albumin, transferine, blood urea nitrogen and creatinine. On the third and ninth postoperative days we repeated the same laboratory tests, and measured the daily loss of nitrogen by excretion of urea in urine. Results and discussion Patient recovery was faster in G1. The average patient stay in ICU was 5 \u00b1 1 days (G1) vs 10 \u00b1 2 days (G2). The average hospital stay was 22 \u00b1 3 days (G1) vs 29 \u00b1 5 days. Peristalsis was detected on the third day as an average (G1) vs 4.5 days (G2). A decrease in pulmonary complications was achieved in G1 (one pleural effusion) vs G2 (eight pleural effusions). Laboratory tests show that patients in G1 are in lower catabolism compared with G2 patients. Conclusion Early enteral immunonutrition through jejunostomy is an efficient and safe method of patient nutrition with fewer postoperative complications, and also accounts for a hospital cost decrease of 50%. Introduction A large randomized trial is needed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of glutamine (GLN) and antioxidant (AOX) supplements. However, high doses of such nutrients via enteral and parenteral routes early in the course of critical illness is often interrupted by high illness acuity and other treatment priorities. The purpose of this pilot trial was to evaluate the feasibility of delivering high-dose GLN and AOX supplements early on in the course of critical illness, and to estimate recruitment for the larger REDOXS study.",

Supplementation was continued for a minimum of 5 days up to 28 days and was provided independent of nutrition support. We recorded the time from ICU admission to randomization, the time to start of supplements and nutrition support parameters. Results From April 2005 to April 2006, 80 patients were randomized (average 2.1/site/month). The median time from ICU admission to randomization was 18.2 hours (range 11.6-21.1 hours). All patients received parenteral supplements, the median (range) time to start was 2.7 hours (2.0-3.8 hours) and 78/80 (98%) received enteral supplements with a median (range) of 2.6 hours (1.9-4.5 hours) from randomization. The mean duration of supplements was 11.1 days (enteral) and 12.2 days (parenteral). The mean volumes of enteral and parenteral supplements received were 84% (range 45-102%) and 93% (range 54-100%) prescribed volumes, respectively. The average prescribed energy and protein intakes were 1,802 kcal/day and 86 g protein/day but the average daily percentage energy and protein received from nutrition support was only 65% (range 4-95%) and 62% (range 2-97%) of that prescribed, respectively. Conclusion In critically ill patients with organ failure we provided adequate amounts of study supplements via both enteral and parenteral routes in the early phases of acute illness, independent of nutrition support.

Introduction Nutrition therapy is an integrant aspect of ICU support and can influence outcomes. A delay to starting nutrition support after 24 hours of ICU admission is associated with increased morbidity and mortality [1] , and certain lipid emulsions can exacerbate the inflammatory cascade. For an appropriate evaluation of the impact of these and other recent research findings, information regarding the use of parenteral nutrition (PN) in the ICU is needed. Methods This is the interim analysis of a multicenter, prospective, cohort study aimed to obtain information regarding the use of PN. Data were collected during 3 months from ICU patients over 18 years of age on the use of PN in 20 adult ICUs in Brazil using a web-based clinical research form.",

Nonetheless, it is not clear whether US guidance (USG) (so-called 'dynamic' or 'real-time' US techniques: that is, venipuncture under direct US control) may be better than US assistance (USA) (socalled 'static' or 'indirect' US techniques: that is, US imaging of the vein, with or without skin marking, and then blind venipuncture). Methods From February 2005 to September 2006, our CVC Team adopted the following protocol for internal jugular vein (IJV) catheterization: (a) both IJVs were evaluated to assess position, dimensions, and other features known to affect the risk of catheterization; (b) then, a decision was made whether to continue with USA or USG; (c) the IJV was accessed via the low lateral Jernigan approach; (d) after two failed USA attempts, USG venipuncture was adopted; (d) when IJVs were not available, USG venipuncture of other central veins was the second choice; and (e) fluoroscopy was used only in paediatric patients, but all patients had a postoperative chest X-ray to rule out pneumothorax and malposition. Results In 20 months, 821 central venous catheters (CVCs) were inserted in adults (181 short-term CVC + 218 tunnelled + 316 ports) and in paediatric patients (age range 20 days-13 years, average 5.5 years: 20 short-term + 84 tunnelled + two ports). In adults, the procedure started as USA in 522 and as USG in 299 cases: a shift from USA to USG was necessary in 8%. USG was the first choice in all paediatric cases. The IJV was successfully cannulated in most adult patients, with very few exceptions (innominate vein in 12 cases, axillary vein in two cases, femoral vein in one case, all by USG). In one paediatric patient, the CVC was inserted in the subclavian vein, via a supraclavicular USG approach. Complications were: failure 0%; pneumothorax 0%; haemothorax 0%; accidental arterial puncture 1.1% (1.7% USA vs 0.3% USG); haematoma 0.4% (only for USA); malposition (0.8%, exclusively with the left IJV). Conclusion In conclusion, (a) we had a minimal incidence of complications, (b) USG was associated with a relevant reduction of the risk of accidental arterial puncture and haematoma, if compared with USA, and (c) choosing the left IJV was associated with a higher risk of malposition.",

Nonetheless, access may be difficult or may carry a significant risk of complications (pneumothorax, central line infection, etc.). Peripherally inserted venous catheters -either central (PICC) or peripheral (midline catheters (MC)) -are associated with a low risk of catheter-related bacteremia; also, using the ultrasound guidance and the microintroducer technique (UG + MIT), they can be inserted in any patient, regardless of the availability of superficial veins. We have reviewed our experience of 56 peripherally inserted catheters in 53 patients in different ICUs (surgical ICU, trauma unit, coronary unit, neurosurgical ICU, stroke unit, pediatric ICU, etc.); all catheters were positioned at the mid-arm, in the basilic vein or in the brachial veins, using UG + MIT.

We used both silicone and polyurethane 4 Fr catheters. Procedures were performed by a team of trained physicians and nurses. Catheter insertion was easy in most cases, and immediate complications were few (no failure; one hematoma; no arterial or nerve injury). Late complications were: one local infection; three thrombosis (two requiring removal); four cases of damage of the external catheter (due to poor nursing or to inappropriate use of the catheter during rx procedures), all easily repaired; one dislocation; no catheter occlusion; no catheter-related bacteremia. Most catheters stayed in place for a prolonged time (range 9-65 days, median 19 days); only three were removed because of complications. Conclusion Our experience with PICC and MC was characterized by an extremely low rate of infective and thrombotic complications. Venous access was achieved in any patient, even with limited availability of peripheral veins. The use of US-inserted PICC and MC should be considered when central access is not advisable or is contraindicated. Introduction Ultrasound has been introduced in the insertion of central venous lines to reduce the complications associated with the conventional landmark technique [1] . We compared both techniques; we noted the number of attempts, the duration of insertion and complications. Methods Thirty patients were randomly selected, from the operating theatre and ICU, who required placement of a central venous catheter. The central venous catheter placement was performed by two experienced anaesthetists with more than 6 years experience in anaesthesia and intensive care. In 15 patients the internal jugular venous catheter placement was performed using the external anatomical landmark technique, and in the other 15 patients the placement was under ultrasound guidance. The duration of insertion was recorded from the moment the needle touched the skin until insertion of the catheter and removal of the guide wire. The numbers of attempts as well as immediate or delayed complications were recorded. Results The central venous catheter placement was successfully performed from the first attempt in both groups. There were no immediate or delayed complications noted; however, the mean time of insertion was longer in the ultrasound-guided group (4.55 min) compared with the external anatomical landmark group (2 min) ( Figure 1 ). Discussion Some studies have been designed to evaluate ultrasound-guided central venous catheter placement compared with the conventional method based on external anatomical landmarks. These studies demonstrated the superiority of ultrasound-guided central venous line placement over the external anatomical landmark technique. However, there was no time gain demonstrated in ultrasound-guided placement [2] . On the other hand, a number of studies have expressed several reservations concerning the systematic use of ultrasound guidance for central line placement [3] . In our patients we found that the use of ultrasound neither altered the rate of complication nor the number of attempts in central venous catheter placement. Also the duration of placement of the central line catheter using the external We recently demonstrated in isolated blood perfused rat lungs subjected to i.t. LPS-induced pulmonary oedema that the continuous measurement of inspiratory resistive work is a good indirect indicator of progressive lung oedema [1] . Here we extend these findings to two other types of pulmonary oedema: hydrostatic oedema induced by elevation of the left atrial pressure, and alveolar oedema (ALV) by infusing normal saline into the trachea at two different infusion rates (2 and 4 ml/hour for 120 min). See Table 1 . Our results indicate that the continuous measurement of inspiratory resistive work is a good indicator of both permeability and hydrostatic lung oedema, but not of pure alveolar oedema (absence of interstitial oedema ",

The number of patients receiving respiratory support at home has been increasing nationally since 1990 [1] ; however, no local data exist. This trend is likely to continue as domiciliary ventilation gains popularity for the treatment of obstructive sleep apnoea and certain groups of COPD patients [2] . Method A postal survey was sent out to practice managers in the local catchment area. They were asked to provide data for: patients on home ventilatory support for any reason, patients with long-term tracheostomies, patients with COPD who are on home oxygen or who you would classify as end stage, and the total number of patients registered to the practice. This was followed up with a telephone call approximately 2 weeks later. Many were then emailed the same questionnaire. A further two telephone calls to each practice were made as necessary in order to obtain data. Results Out of 67 surgeries contacted, we achieved a response rate of 65%. Thirty-three practices (49%) were able to provide complete data, six (9%) provided partial data, and a further five (7%) were unable or unwilling to provide any data. Twenty-three (34%) practices did not respond. A total of 318,130 patients were listed by the responding practices. Of these: 23 patients live with long-term tracheostomies, a prevalence of 1 in 13,800; 65 patients receive mechanical respiratory support at home, a prevalence of 1 in 4,900; and 207 patients receive oxygen therapy at home, a prevalence of 1 in 1,500. Discussion This study suggests that the Frimley Park Hospital population of 350,000 currently contains about 100 individuals requiring mechanical respiratory support at home. This is of concern as currently there is no formal support for any of these high-risk patients other than ventilator maintenance. Simple problems precipitate hospital admission and rapidly trigger outreach or intensive care review. The current position is clearly unsatisfactory and must be addressed by PCTs if patient numbers increase. Results The frequency of MV was 30%; the overall and specific mortality rates were 15% and 50%, respectively. The mean (\u00b1SD) age was 57 \u00b1 21 years; 52% were males; the mean APACHE II score was 22.2 \u00b1 8.2; 69% were medical patients; the mean duration of MV was 11 \u00b1 7.9 days; 93% were on invasive MV.

These included sepsis (P = 0.02), MV duration (P < 0.001), renal failure (P = 0.006) prior to MV, and the following variables that occurred during the MV period: sepsis (P = 0.004), acute lung injury/acute respiratory distress syndrome (P = 0.001), renal failure (P < 0.001), haematological failure (P = 0.02) and vasoactive drug use (P < 0.001). It should be noted that selected ventilatory monitored variables were included in the multivariate model. However, they were not associated with mortality in our study sample.",

We tested the hypothesis that adaptive pressure ventilation-synchronised intermittent mandatory ventilation (APV-SIMV) may provide better pulmonary mechanics, CO 2 homeostasis and pulmonary gas exchanges with less frequent ventilatory settings (tidal volume (TV), respiratory rate (RR)) and lower peak inspiratory pressure (P peak ) and plateau pressure (P plat ) than pressure-controlled synchronised intermittent mandatory ventilation (P-SIMV) in patients undergoing laparocopic cholecystectomy (LP). Method The study group consisted of 40 patients (APV-SIMV n = 20, P-SIMV n = 20). LP was performed under total intravenous anesthesia. After induction of anesthesia, a RR of 12 breaths/ minute, and an inspiratory:expiratory rate of 1:2 and PEEP of 6 cmH 2 O were set for both groups. APV-SIMV was started with a target TV of 8 ml/kg. P-SIMV was started with the inspiratory pressure (P ins ) that will provide 8 ml/kg TV. The settings were changed until target parameters to maintain normocapnia and normoxia were achieved (ETCO 2 30-35 mmHg, PaCO 2 35-45 mmHg and SaO 2 >90%).

An RSBI <105 has been widely accepted by healthcare professionals as a criteria for weaning to extubation and has been integrated into most mechanical ventilation weaning protocols. We hypothesized that the converse of using the RSBI for weaning might be useful in predicting the need for noninvasive ventilation. (Figure 1 ).

Rhythm analysis of plasma levels and activity data used single cosinor analysis and nonparametric parameters, respectively. Results Both groups were well matched. There were no significant differences between the groups in any of the rest-activity measures, which were abnormal and comparable with those previously reported [1] . There was a weak inverse correlation between plasma melatonin and cortisol levels (r = -0.22, P = 0.015). Seven of 18 patients had a circadian rhythm of plasma cortisol levels, while only two patients had a normal acrophase. Four of the nine placebo patients had a circadian rhythm of melatonin, but only one of these had a normal amplitude and acrophase.

There is, however, limited evidence linking the use of bundles to demonstrable changes in patient outcomes.

Methods Data were extracted for mechanically ventilated admissions from a single unit participating in the Case Mix Programme that was an early adopter of the ventilator bundle. A risk prediction model was developed using data from admissions during the 3.5 years prior to the introduction of the bundle and applied to admissions during the 3 years since introduction to estimate the cumulative excess mortality (observed minus expected deaths). Results There were 762 ventilated admissions prior to the introduction of the bundle and 618 since. The cumulative excess mortality plot suggested a reduction in mortality after introduction of the bundle (Figure 1 ) but this was not statistically significant (relative risk reduction 10.9%, 95% confidence interval -10.2% to 31.8%).",

Cyclic surface area changes and a carboxylesterase activity (surfactant convertase) are thought to mediate this subtype conversion. However, data concerning regulation of surfactant convertase are scarce. We therefore investigated the expression and activity of lung surfactant convertase and HMSE-1, a potential macrophage-derived human convertase, under normal and acute inflammatory conditions. Methods Convertase activity in lavage fluid (BALF) was assessed using the in vitro cycling assay. The relative large surfactant aggregate content was determined by phospholipid quantification in the pellet following centrifugation at 48,000 x g. Esterase activity was assessed by means of a chromogenic substrate assay. Expression of both convertase and HMSE upon LPS challenge was assessed by real-time (TaqMan) PCR in murine alveolar macrophages, murine primary type II cells, and the human monocytic cell line U937, respectively. Results Lavage fluid from ARDS patients displayed an increased esterase activity when compared with BALF from healthy controls. In addition, a pronounced large to small aggregate conversion was observed for BALF from LPS-challenged mice or BALF from ARDS patients. Incubation with LPS resulted in a significant increase in convertase gene expression in primary mouse type II cells as well as in HMSE-1 gene expression in U937 cells and monocytes from peripheral blood. No convertase expression was found in cultured murine alveolar macrophages. Conclusions An increased convertase activity was found under acute inflammatory conditions of the alveolar compartment, and type II cells seem to be a relevant source of this increased convertase activity. However, leakage of esterase activity from the vascular space and other inflammatory cells cannot be ruled out. ",

Additionally, a computer-driven weaning protocol was successfully performed and a reduction of mechanical ventilation duration could be demonstrated [2] . The implementation of the ARDS Network protocol in routine ICU practice remains modest [3] . A possible reason is the increased organisational and temporal burden. An automated execution of the protocol would help to propagate its day-to-day use. To test the ability to automate such a complex protocol, we designed a pilot study in porcine acute lung injury using an experimental medical expert system capable of continuously controlling respiratory parameters and global as well as regional ventilation with electrical impedance tomography (EIT). Methods After induction of saline lavage-induced lung injury in pigs (n = 3), automated mechanical ventilation was initiated. The medical expert system used a closed-loop fuzzy controller with a rule base of if/then rules based on the ARDS Network protocol reference card. The protocol's algorithmic rules and therapeutic goals (oxygenation, pH, I:E, VT) were continuously controlled and ventilatory settings electronically adjusted accordingly. The medical attendant personnel was constantly informed with status messages about the decisions made. During the trial, all measurements were made using an online blood gas monitor (TrendCare Satellite; Diametrics Medical Inc., UK), a monitor for hemodynamic parameters (Sirecust 1281; Siemens, Germany), a capnograph (CO 2 SMO+; Respironics, Inc., USA), and an EIT prototype system (EIT Evaluation Kit; Draeger Medical, Germany).

Compared with the beginning of the study, a reduction in ventilation pressure and PaCO 2 could be observed. Despite the initial low PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio (<200 mmHg) of the subjects, FiO 2 could be decreased by the system in the given time without penetrating the thresholds for oxygenation. Conclusion Robust execution of an automated ARDS Network protocol with an electronically controlled ventilator is possible and leads to pulmonary stabilisation. Further trials have to be undertaken before this successful approach can be realised in ARDS patients. Introduction The optimal duration of prone position ventilation (PPV) in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is uncertain. It has been pointed out that pulmonary ARDS patients respond less than extrapulmonary ARDS patients. Objective To study effects of continuous long-term PPV on gas exchange, PEEP, lung injury score and multiorgan failure in pulmonary ARDS patients. Materials and methods The design was a prospective (cohort). We studied 42 PPV periods in 33 pulmonary ARDS patients. Measures were taken in the supine position before PPV and at 1 hour after PPV, and then every 6 hours until the end of PPV. Statistical values are expressed as the median and interquartile range. Wilcoxon and Kruskal-Wallis tests were used. P < 0.05 was considered significant. Results The mean age was 44 (25-57) years, the initial lung injury score (LIS) was 3.1 (2.75-3.6), and PPV was maintained for 91 (51-117) hours. The PaO 2 /FIO 2 ratio was 125 (99-181) mmHg before PPV and 256 (170-298) mmHg after 1 hour of PPV (P = 0.001). This difference with the supine PaO 2 /FIO 2 ratio was sustained until the end of PPV. Initial values of PEEP were set at 15 (12-18) cmH 2 O by constructing a PEEP-compliance curve; there were no differences in PEEP values along the study. Initial values of PaCO 2 were 47 (41-69) mmHg and there were no significant differences along the study period. After 24 hours of PPV, the LIS was significantly decreased in comparison with the supine value before PPV: 3 (2.25-2.7) vs 2.5 (2.25-2.75), P = 0.001. There were no significant complications. Conclusions PPV had a positive effect on gas exchange even after 6 hours. This effect lasts through the PPV period. Because of its effect on the LIS, a duration of 24 hours for continuous PPV could be useful in this patient setting.",

Dynamic effects of regional ventilation can be monitored by electrical impedance tomography (EIT) at the bedside [1] .

After stabilization of the lung injury model (> 1 hour) a stepwise PEEP trial was performed consisting of 2-minute steps of tidal ventilation (10-30 cmH 2 O; 30-5 cmH 2 O). During the PEEP trial subjects were ventilated pressure-controlled. Global ventilatory and gas exchange parameters were continuously recorded. Offline we analysed EIT data by computing the amount of breath by breath recruitment (\u2206V EIT) at each pressure level before and after lung lavage. Nondependent and dependent regions of interest were defined in the tomograms. \u2206V EIT was defined as the mean increase or decrease in end-expiratory global impedance per breath. Results Ventilatory parameters clearly showed a recruitment of nonaerated lung areas at the descending part of the pressure ramp. The shape of the P-V curve from EIT data, in particular the increasing slope (lower level > upper level), reflected the recruitment of poorly ventilated lung regions. The flattening of the curve at higher pressures, especially at the upper level, reflected less amount of recruitment but more overdistension. Regional pulmonary recruitment/derecruitment was very high in the lower level. These phenomena were more impressive after induced lung injury. S79 of ventilator settings and respiratory mechanics is crucial for further developments of protective lung ventilation. Up to now, the nonlinearity of compliance has mainly been the focus of interest. We hypothesized that airway resistance also changes intratidally. Therefore, this study was performed to analyze the dependence of resistance on tidal gas volume. Methods After induction of anesthesia and tracheotomy, the lungs of 14 surfactant-depleted piglets were ventilated at zero endexpiratory pressure with three different tidal volumes (8, 12, 16 ml/kg) in a randomized order. In addition, baseline measurements (12 ml/kg) were performed before saline lavage. Before any change of the ventilator settings a recruitment maneuver was performed. The nonlinear intratidal airway resistance was analyzed using the SLICE method [1] . Results Figure 1 shows the intratidal resistance before lavage (grey) and after surfactant depletion (black) plotted against the alveolar pressure. Each curve in the diagram represents the intratidal course of resistance for one ventilator setting.

The objective of this study was to evaluate plasma cytokine behavior after an ARM in healthy volunteers. Methods After obtaining ethical committee approval and informed consent, a basal blood sample was collected in 10 healthy volunteers. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) was noninvasively applied (BiPAP Vision \u00ae ; Respironics, USA) using a total face mask. CPAP was increased by 3 cmH 2 O from 5 to 20 cmH 2 O every five breaths. At CPAP of 20 cmH 2 O, an inspiratory pressure of 20 cmH 2 O above CPAP was implemented during 10 breaths. After that, CPAP was stepwise decreased in an inverse fashion. Pulse oximetry, arterial pressure and heart rate were measured before and after ARM. Additional blood samples were drawn at 30 minutes, 2 and 12 hours. TNF\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10 and IL-12 were measured by the flow cytometry technique (Cytometric Bead Array BD\u2122 Kit).

VRI offers the potential to rapidly and noninvasively determine endobronchial intubation.

Introduction Airflow into a mechanically ventilated patient is easily measured in the inspiratory limb of the ventilator. Regional airflow inside the lungs, up to this point, is a black box. Vibration response imaging (VRI) is a novel technology that measures vibration energy from the lungs to create a real-time structural and functional image of regional vibration during respiration. Sophisticated surface skin sensors are placed on the subject's back to record, analyze and display vibrations noninvasively. Our goal was to assess the correlation of vibration measured at the chest wall with airflow into the lungs. Methods To assess the effect of constant inspiratory flow on lung vibration, VRI was performed on a mechanically ventilated patient on assist volume control, and airflow in the tubing was recorded concurrently. To assess the effect of increasing flow rates on lung vibration, healthy subjects were recorded several times with VRI while taking tidal volumes of 200-1,300 ml at the same respiratory rate. The inspiratory tidal volume was recorded.",

S85 decrease after PEEP was reduced from 15 to 5 cmH 2 O but decreased after PEEP was reduced from 5 to 0 cmH 2 O. Conclusion Accurate measurements of FRC are obtained during a constant breathing pattern that is easier to obtain during controlled ventilation in comparison with pressure-support ventilation.

Introduction Respiratory physiotherapy is ever more utilized for the treatment of critical patients. However, it is known that there are few studies on the effect on gas exchange in patients with acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and physiotherapy techniques. The purpose of this study was to assess the effect of a pulmonary expansion and disobstruction maneuver with a closed system on the gas exchange of patients with ALI and ARDS. Methods The patients with the diagnosis of ALI and ARDS who met the inclusion criteria were randomized to one of the two groups: those of the intervention group were subjected to a pulmonary expansion and bronchial disobstruction maneuvers, for approximately 10 minutes by the association of the following physiotherapy techniques: sighs, side-lying position, expiratory rib-cage compression and endotracheal suctioning with a closed system and after observed for 10 minutes; the patients of the control group did not receive any treatment, they were only observed for 20 minutes. Ventilatory parameters and arterial blood gases were measured before (Time 1) and 10 minutes after the procedures (Time 2 Methods The nebulizer device consists of a cylindrical glass housing that, at the bottom, ends up in a spherical lower housing part that serves as the dry powder reservoir. A gas inlet portion with a nozzle at its end is coaxially aligned with the housing, almost reaches the bottom of the dry powder reservoir, and induces aerosol generation when gas pressures between 1 and 2 bar are applied. The upper portion of the housing contains a cap with an aerosol exit port. Several nozzles ensure a discharge of unsuitably large aerosol particles. Aerosol characteristics were determined by laser diffractometry. The efficacy of an inhalative rSP-C surfactant application was assessed in three animal models of acute lung injury, including rabbits with acute lung injury due to either repetitive lavage with prolonged and injurious ventilation, or due to inhalative application of bleomycin at day 4, and bleomycinchallenged, spontaneously breathing mice.",

Respiratory mechanics (static compliance and airway resistance) was measured using the rapid airway occlusion technique immediately before and after the BAL and 90 minutes later. The heart rate, arterial blood pressure and body temperature were recorded continuously in all patients. Patients were classified according to the presence of unilateral or bilateral infiltrates. Results Fifty-eight critically ill patients undergoing mechanical ventilation were included. Following the BAL, compliance of the respiratory system (Crs) decreased from 50.9 \u00b1 36.1 to 35.6 \u00b1 14.8 ml/cmH 2 O (P < 0.01) and airway resistance increased from 16.2 \u00b1 7.6 to 18.1 \u00b1 11.3 cm H 2 O/l/seg (P < 0.05); 90 minutes later, both parameters had returned to pre-BAL values (P = not significant). Patients who showed >20% decrease in Crs had higher pre-BAL Crs than patients with less severe decrease (55.8 \u00b1 20.1 vs 36.9 \u00b1 14.1; P < 0.001). On the contrary, neither pre-BAL airway resistance nor the extension of the radiographic infiltrates were related to the changes in respiratory mechanics.",

Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT scan) is the gold standard. CT scan has limitations: it takes time to be performed, implies transport of severely injured patients, and has ionising effects. Thoracic ultrasonography (US) can be quickly performed at the bedside in the emergency room. It has good diagnosis accuracy in ARDS patients [2] . The purpose of this study is to evaluate the diagnosis accuracy of US in severely injured patients in the emergency room. Methods We prospectively evaluated 90 patients (median age: 41 (7-89) years) who were admitted to the emergency room of the Grenoble University Hospital over a period of 9 months. Pneumothorax, hemothorax and alveolar consolidation were diagnosed by CE, X-ray and US. The physician who performed the US was not involved in the patient's management. Results During 123 missions, 15 adult patients underwent prehospital endotracheal intubation (cardiac arrest n = 9, multiple injuries n = 4, drug poisoning n = 1, pulmonary edema n = 1) with the Bonfils intubation fiberscope, the use of which was either planned (n = 13) or unplanned (n = 2). All intubations were successful in the first attempt, even in two cardiac arrest victims who had an unexpected difficult airway (Cormack&Lehane grade IV under direct laryngoscopy). In those patients with multiple injuries the cervical immobilization collar did not need to be unfastened or removed for endotracheal intubation. Sufficient retropharyngeal space -which is mandatory for sufficient use of the Bonfils -was created by a digital jaw thrust maneuver in the first three patients. Using a standard Mackintosh laryngoscope blade significantly enhanced ease of insertion of the Bonfils fiberscope and visualization of the glottic aperture, thereby decreasing the procedure time from 35-40 seconds to 20-25 seconds.",

The interview was designed to follow the Difficult Airway Society (DAS) guidelines. We designed six equipment-related questions that identified a unit as achieving the minimum levels of equipment necessary. These included availability of laryngoscopes, capnography, LMA/ILMA, and rescue techniques. Introduction Occasionally, rescuers are confronted with a hard situation to establish tracheal intubation compared with doctors in the anesthetic room. Especially in the confined space, the tracheal intubation must enter technical difficulties with any supporting device. This may be caused by the fact that there was no device developed specially from a standpoint in the clinical emergency use. Objective The AirWay Scope (AWS) is one of the newest intubation devices, manufactured using modern technology to alleviate the tracheal intubation in emergency scenes. The AWS is equipped with a full-colored CCD, a LCD monitor and a specially configured introducer guiding a tracheal tube into the glottis (Figure 1 ). The aim of this study is to confirm the potential of the AWS as an intubation-supporting device in emergency scenes. Method Six doctors in the emergency department were enrolled in this study.

            "text": "In conclusion, our study shows that the Uniblocker\u2122 is more useful than the Coopdech bronchial blocker tube. is a new tracheal tube designed for use for mechanical ventilation in the critically ill. The LoTrach has been shown to prevent the ubiquitous problem of micro-aspiration of secretions associated with conventional HVLP cuffs [1] . Aspiration prevention is achieved by the properties of the LoTrach's low-volume low-pressure (LVLP) cuff, and these have been previously described [1, 2] . It is important that, alongside achieving aspiration prevention, there is also tracheal wall pressure control. Results Conventional HVLP cuffs do not prevent leakage of fluid past the cuff, hence the negative slope on the graphs. The LoTrach cuff does not leak and therefore the line is horizontal (see Figure  1 ). The clinical study shows that both the LoTrach and Portex cuffs demonstrate a gross air leak at equal and acceptable tracheal wall pressures at 33.4 and 29.7 cmH 2 O, respectively (see Table 1 ). Introduction Lung injury and generalized edema from a burn and resuscitation complicates airway management and patient care. The need for long-term ventilation and multiple surgeries warrant early tracheostomy. Percutaneous techniques are well described; however, the burned and swollen neck increases all of its recognized complications. We report a modified semi-open technique for performing percutaneous tracheotomies (PT) in acutely burned patients, which we consider safer. Methods We reviewed the medical records of 20 patients admitted to a regional burn center requiring tracheostomy for prolonged mechanical ventilation. The procedure took place in the OR if burn excision was planned; otherwise it was performed at the bedside. The Blue Rhino tracheostomy kit was used for all PT. Major differences from other approaches included dissecting down to the pretracheal fascia, allowing the trachea to be seen and palpated; bleeding was controlled using an electrocautery, and blood vessels were retracted from the field or ligated. The trachea was palpated as the endotracheal tube was withdrawn into the proximal trachea and a flexible bronchoscope was used only to confirm the proper placement of the guidewire. Proper placement of the tracheal tube was confirmed by capnography. In patients with a deep trachea due to severe neck swelling, a proximal-long tracheostomy tube was substituted for the standard one. In the event that the airway or ventilation became compromised, this technique could be converted rapidly to an open procedure.",

There were no short-term complications associated with this method. Conclusion PT can be performed safely in severely burned patients using a semi-open percutaneous technique.

The following variables were collected: patient demographics; diagnosis; number of days of tracheostomy in situ; number of days on noninvasive ventilation (CPAP); and tracheostomy-related complications. A review of the risk management database was performed to identify any tracheostomy-related reported adverse events. Results One hundred and eight tracheostomies were performed in intensive care in the 2-year period. Sixty-two patients were discharged with tracheostomy in situ and were reviewed by the outreach team for a cumulative total of 710 days until decannulation. There were 383 days whereby patients with a tracheostomy in situ had been noninvasively ventilated. There were three reported critical events relating to tracheostomy and no deaths. Conclusion More than 60% of patients who had a tracheostomy inserted are discharged from critical care with a tracheostomy in situ. With the support of the outreach team these patients were successfully managed in Level 2 and Level 1 areas. This reduced the requirement for critical care (Level 3) bed-days. There was a low rate of complications. We concluded that outreach services can facilitate early and safe discharge of tracheostomy patients from critical care. Indication of levosimendan therapy was acute heart failure due to myocardial infarction in 23 cases and acute progression of chronic heart failure (NYHA III-IV) in 18 cases.

Conclusion With these results the authors would like to draw attention to the proarrhythmic effects of levosimendan during acute heart failure therapy, especially in the case of parallel usage with catecholamines.

However, most of these events occurred in the first month after the admission, the mortality between 1 month and 3 years being low ( Figure 1 ). Conclusion Our data show that the octogenarian patients with STEMI treated by primary PCA developed a very high mortality. However, this mortality especially concentrates in the first month after the procedure, being low between 1 month and 3 years. Purpose Although invasive management of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) has improved the clinical outcome, early mortality remains an important issue. Our purpose is to assess the utility of the initial electrocardiographic (ECG) pattern in detecting patients who are at increased risk despite the current recommendations of revascularization. Methods We analyzed 446 consecutive patients (age 61.9 \u00b1 13.8 years, 76.5% male) admitted in the first 12 hours of STEMI to our coronary unit. Exclusion criteria were left bundle branch block at admission or previous myocardial infarction. Most patients (87%) were treated with primary angioplasty. Patients treated with thrombolytics and with early reperfusion criteria were programmed to coronary angiography the following day. Two groups were defined according to the presence of ST-segment elevation (STE) together with distortion of the terminal portion of the QRS in two or more adjacent leads (group 1) or the absence of this pattern (group 2) (Figure 1) . Results ST elevation with distortion of the terminal portion of QRS were present at initial ECG in 55 patients (23%). This group had a lower incidence of Rentrop grade 2/3 than group 2 (P = 0.006, Figure 1 ). Moreover, group 1 had higher enzyme release, worse maximal Killip class and more frequently the combined variable death/shock. Group 1 more often had proximal occlusion of the infarction-related artery and nonreflow. Multivariate analysis found ECG to be an independent predictor of outcome.

Compared with patients with hemoglobin concentrations of 140-159 g/l, those with hemoglobin concentrations <140 g/l had more inhospital complications and those with hemoglobin concentrations \u2265160 g/l also had more arrhythmia and pneumonia (P < 0.001, respectively). As expected, a significant inverse correlation between hemoglobin concentrations and ages (r = -0.51; P < 0.001) was observed, and a significant positive correlation between hemoglobin concentrations and albumin concentrations and in the patients with acute myocardial infarction. Conclusion It is demonstrated in this study that a reverse J-shaped relationship between baseline hemoglobin values and major adverse cardiovascular events is observed in patients with acute myocardial infarction. There is a greater incidence of patients with a hemoglobin concentration on admission in the elderly population than that in the younger one.",

Introduction The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between blood pressure and plasma magnesium levels in patients referred to the emergency department with hypertensive attack. Epidemiological evidence on the effects of magnesium on blood pressure is inconsistent. Metabolic and experimental studies suggest that magnesium may have a role in the regulation of blood pressure. Magnesium regulates various ion channels in many tissues, including those of the cardiovascular system. Magnesium is the second most abundant intracellular cation, and the important element that has numerous biological functions in the cardiovascular system. Furthermore, magnesium acts as a calcium antagonist, regulating the calcium metabolism. Methods Patients were included who were taken to the emergency department due to hypertensive attack. Their age, gender, systolic and diastolic blood pressure were recorded. In order to see the plasma magnesium levels, venous blood samples were taken. The results were compared with a chi-square test. The values P < 0.05 were accepted as significant.",

In addition to revascularisation, long-term prognosis is dependent on successful implementation of secondary prevention, in particular the use of aspirin, statins, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and, in many, \u03b2-blockers. Previous studies have highlighted the under-utilisation of secondary preventative strategies in this patient population. A focused review of secondary preventative medication at the time of revascularisation provides an excellent opportunity to ensure optimal use of these agents.

In total, 2,302 isolated coronary artery bypass grafting procedures and 447 combined procedures were performed. See Table 1 . Introduction Under normal resting conditions, the oxygen delivery (DO 2 ) matches the overall metabolic demands of the organs, the oxygen consumption (VO 2 ) is about 25% of the DO 2 , and energy is produced basically through the aerobic mechanism. In cardiac surgery with extracorporeal circulation (ECC), several factors (for example, hemodilutional anemia, myocardial stunning resulting in a low cardiac output (CO)) can determine an imbalance between O 2 demand and DO 2 and may affect the outcome. Below the critical DO 2 there is a linear decrease of both VO 2 and CO 2 production (VCO 2 ), but due to the anaerobic VCO 2 the respiratory quotient increases. This study is aimed to evaluate the role of O 2 and CO 2 derived parameters to predict postoperative morbidity in cardiac surgery.",

Morbidity was defined as one or more of the following events: cardiovascular, respiratory, neurological, renal, infectious, and hemorrhagic complications. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed. ROC curve analysis was also used to define the best predictive variables. Results Seventeen (34%) patients had VS, 11 (65%) men and six (35%) women. Longer aortic clamping time (P = 0.007) and CPB time (P = 0.013) were associated with VS. These patients showed a higher cardiac index at 4 hours (P < 0.001) and lactic acid within the first 24 hours. Seven of these patients (41%) fulfilled vasoplegic shock criteria (P < 0.001). We found higher levels of IL-6 at 0 hours (P = 0.02) and 4 hours (P = 0.001), and soluble TNF receptor at 0 hours (P = 0.044).

The only one associated with VS was the PAI-1 polymorphism, and its distribution in the study population was: 4G/G genotype in 10 (20%) patients, 4G/5G in 26 (52%) patients, and 5G/G in 14 Introduction Body mass index (BMI) has been described as a risk factor for coronary artery disease, but association with postoperative bleeding after cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) has been found in several studies recently. Nevertheless the strong relationship between a low BMI and excessive bleeding remains unexplained. We sought to investigate the BMI role on postoperative bleeding and its relationship with leptin levels, coagulation, fibrinolysis and complement parameters. Methods We performed a nested case-control study of 26 patients, who did not receive antifibrinolytic prophylaxis. We used Bray's classification for BMI: lower than 27 kg/m 2 ; 27-30 kg/m 2 ; higher than 30 kg/m 2 . Variables were collected preoperatively, at ICU admission (0 hours), and at 4 and 24 hours after surgery. Excessive bleeding was defined as blood loss higher than 1 l in the first 24 hours after intervention. Figure 1 ). BMI presented a direct correlation with leptins, fibrinogen and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) on arrival, meanwhile 24-hour bleeding showed an inverse correlation with the same parameters and BMI (Table 1) . Patients with BMI < 27 kg/m 2 had significantly greater coagulation, fibrinolysis and complement activation. Therefore these patients required significantly greater hemoderivatives. Conclusions Lower BMI was associated with higher postoperative bleeding and lower procoagulant factor levels. 49) ), respiratory control ratio (11 (7-15) vs 10 (9-11)) (not significant). Hepatic mitochondrial state 4 was higher (27 (16-31) vs 19 (13-22)) and respiratory control ratio lower (3 (3-4) vs 5 (4-6)) in the hemorrhage/endotoxemia group, compared with controls. Background Sepsis-induced multiple organ failure may crucially depend on the development of mitochondrial dysfunction and consequent cellular energetic failure. We investigated whether hepatic mitochondrial dysfunction was present in a clinically relevant porcine model of fluid-resuscitated septic shock. Methods Anesthetized and ventilated pigs (40 \u00b1 3 kg) were randomly assigned to septic shock by fecal peritonitis (F, n = 3) or control (C, n = 3) after placement of portal/hepatic vein catheters and portal vein and hepatic artery flow probes. F and C received 8 \u00b1 13 ml/kg/hour and 5 \u00b1 7 ml/kg/hour ringer lactate + starch, respectively. The mean arterial pressure (MAP), total liver flow (TLF), hepatic O 2 delivery (DO 2,h ) and hepatic O 2 consumption (VO 2,h ) were recorded at baseline (BL), 12 and 24 hours (ml/kg/min). Activities of mitochondrial respiratory chain enzymes (complex I-IV) were assessed by spectrophotometry in snapfrozen liver samples. Data are presented as the mean \u00b1 SD. Results Hyperdynamic circulation developed in F with increasing DO 2,h and decreasing VO 2,h ( Table 1) . Complex II activity significantly decreased from 19.3 \u00b1 4.2 to 9.5 \u00b1 2.6 (P < 0.05 vs BL and between groups) in F compared with C. Complex I-III-IV function decreased in parallel in F. Monitoring of the mitochondrial NADH redox state (an indicator of intracellular oxygen levels) together with microcirculatory blood flow (TBF) and with oxygenation (HbO 2 ) could serve as a preferred approach to evaluate tissue O 2 balance or viability. We hypothesize that in the presence of reduced oxygen delivery and extraction, blood flow will be redistributed in order to protect the most vital organs by increasing their regional blood flow, while O 2 delivery to the less vital organs will diminish. Thus, the NADH redox state of less vital organs could serve as an indicator of overall O 2 imbalance as well as an endpoint of resuscitation. We have therefore developed an optical device embedded in a Foley catheter to provide real-time data on the NADH redox state, TBF and HbO 2 in critically ill patients. The CritiView is a computerized optical device that integrates hardware and software in order to provide real-time information of S107 tissue viability [1] . A modified three-way Foley catheter that contains a fiberoptic probe connects the CritiView to the mucosal side of the urethral wall. We have used this device in five female pigs that underwent graded hemorrhage, and in four patients who were monitored during aortic abdominal aneurysm operations. These preliminary swine model and human studies confirm the feasibility of collecting information about mitochondrial function from the urethral wall. The main effects of graded hemorrhage started when the blood volume decreased by 30%. At 40% blood loss, minimal levels of TBF and HbO 2 were correlated to the maximal NADH levels. The values of the three parameters returned to baseline after retransfusion of the shed blood. Aortic clamping in patients led to a significant decrease in TBF and HbO 2 while NADH levels increased. After aortic declamping, the parameters recovered to normal values.",

The flowmotion frequency observed in reactive hyperemia was associated with the severity of the MODS (P = 0.009), and -although not statistically significant -arterial lactate concentration (P = 0.052). Conclusion An increased skin microvascular oscillation frequency during rest and after an ischemic stimulus is associated with increased mortality in patients suffering from MODS. We suggest that the underlying mechanism of the increased flowmotion could be a response of the skin microvasculature to hypoxia or to an impaired oxygen utilization of the skin tissue.

Methods Ten animals were tracheostomized and prepared for microcirculation study; after tissue preparation, five rats were allowed to breath spontaneously (Group SB = spontaneous breathing), and five rats (Group IPPV) were connected to a small animal ventilator (IPPV: FiO 2 0.21, respiratory rate 60/min, tidal volume 10 ml/kg, inspiratory time 50% of respiratory cycle, and 2 cmH 2 O PEEP).

In the experimental group, the mean arterial pressure (MAP) remained fairly stable until 300 minutes after injection of LPS, and the MAP gradually decreased subsequently. While the MAP was maintained, the PtO 2 gradually decreased linearly ( Figure 1 ). TL increased with time linearly. Meanwhile, BL did not change from 150 to 250 minutes; after 300 minutes it increased abruptly in the experimental group ( Figure 2 ). Conclusions In our experimental endotoxemia model it has been shown that partial pressure of oxygen in subcutaneous tissue decreased even if systemic blood pressure was maintained. Boekstegers and colleagues [1] revealed that mean skeletal muscle PO 2 was increased in patients with sepsis compared with patients with limited infection. We obtained conflicting results to those of Boekstegers and colleagues. The reason for this is unknown. BL abruptly increased during 50-150 minutes, probably from abnormal metabolism induced by LPS in whole-body organs. It is considered that BL did not show a rise during 150-250 minutes due to metabolization of lactate in liver and muscle. TL, which is insusceptible of lactate metabolism by other organs, may reflect abnormality of tissue metabolism precisely. Shunting of the microcirculation contributes to the pathology of sepsis and septic shock. In this study, we hypothesize that shunting of the microcirculation occurs after superior mesenteric artery (SMA) ischemia (occlusion) and reperfusion, and we explore functional consequences using intravital microscopy. Spontaneously breathing animals (rats) (n = 30) underwent occlusion of the SMA for 0 (controls), 30 or 60 minutes followed by reperfusion (4 hours) with normal saline. Leukocyte-endothelial interactions in mesenteric venules were quantified in an exteriorized ileal loop using intravital microscopy. Abdominal blood flow was recorded continuously, and arterial blood gases were analyzed at intervals. Continuous SMA blood flow measurements were performed in comparable groups without exteriorizing an ileal loop. Adherent leukocytes increased shortly after reperfusion in ischemia groups, and plateaued in these groups. The centerline velocity and shear rate in the recorded venules were significantly reduced after reperfusion down to low-flow/no-flow in animals undergoing 60 minutes of mesenteric artery occlusion compared with animals with 30 minutes occlusion and controls, whereas perfusion of the SMA and ileal vessels persisted. The microcirculatory changes in animals with 60 minutes occlusion were accompanied by progressive metabolic acidosis, substantially larger volumes of intravenous fluids needed to support arterial blood pressure and significantly reduced survival (30%). In the groups with continuous SMA blood flow measurements, SMA blood flow increased in SMA occlusion for 60 minutes and subsequent reperfusion causes perfusion abnormalities in the mesenteric microcirculation as often seen in sepsis and septic shock with increased microcirculation shunting, progressive metabolic acidosis and increased mortality.",

Introduction Traditionally invasive haemodynamic measurements of pulmonary artery occlusion pressures have been used to assess the volume status in critically ill patients. The vascular pedicle, as seen on chest X-ray scan, is the mediastinal silhouette of the great vessels. We hypothesized that the vascular pedicle width (VPW) on supine, portable chest X-ray scans could be used to predict intravascular volume overloaded status in critically ill patients. Methods We conducted a prospective, blinded observational trial where both pulmonary artery occlusion pressures (PAOP) and VPWs were measured in patients admitted to the ICU. We used measurements of PAOP \u2265 18 mmHg as indicative of a fluid overloaded state, and measurements of PAOP < 18 mmHg as normal or low volume states. Standardized, portable chest X-ray scans in the supine position were obtained within 1 hour of PAOP measurement. Receiver-operating characteristics (ROC) curves were constructed using different cutoffs of the VPW measurement to identify sensitivities and specificities for each value (see Figure 1 ). Results Measurements were obtained from 50 patients. Using ROC-derived cutoffs, a VPW measurement of 74.5 mm was found to have a sensitivity of 83% and a specificity of 78% for correctly predicting a fluid overloaded state.",

Methods Our study includes 140 measurements in 10 critically ill patients (eight males, two females, age 37-84 years, mean 64.1 \u00b1 13.0 years) requiring hemodynamic monitoring with the PiCCO system. Five patients had septic shock, three hepatorenal syndrome and two acute heart failure.

The average of two lithium dilution measurements improves the precision by 30% and shows an excellent CV (that is, 8.6%).

The mean APACHE II score was 20.8 \u00b1 2.3. Ten paired results were obtained (see Table 1 ). The mean difference of LiDCO from PiCCO overall was -5.49 \u00b1 21.3%. The correlation coefficient r = 0.73 (P = 0.0166). Conclusion There was general agreement between LiDCO and PiCCO. There were significant differences (>30%) in only three out of 10 measurements. Combining the results of >1 lithium calibration may improve accuracy. These results are promising but a larger trial will be required.",

The thoracic fluid content (TFC) is a parameter deriving from the electric conductivity of the thorax, determined from intravascular, alveolar and interstitial fluids [2, 3] . Introduction A new device may be used in intensive care to measure the cardiac output (CO) by arterial pulse pressure waveform analysis, but few studies have evaluated the reliability of this method and the correlation with other methods of CO determination. The aims of this study were to evaluate the CO obtained using the Flow Trac\u2122 Vigileo\u2122 and the correlation with CO obtained by transthoracic echocardiography (TTE). Materials and methods Ten critical care patients admitted to a general ICU were enrolled in the study. All patients were mechanically ventilated (tidal volume 6-8 ml/kg, plateau pressure < 30 cmH 2 O) and connected to an integrated monitoring system (Flow Trac\u2122/Vigileo\u2122; Ewdards Lifescience, Irvine, CA, USA) that attaches to an arterial cannula. After haemodynamic stabilization the CO was calculated from an arterial pressure-based algorithm that utilises the relationship between pulse pressure and stroke volume. At the same time a TTE examination was performed (Hewlett Packard, SONO 1000) and the CO was calculated by Doppler measurement of the left ventricular outflow area (LVOT) and the velocity-time integral (VTI LVOT), assuming stroke volume = cross-sectional area x VTI. Every patient had two CO determinations by TTE during Flow Trac\u2122 measurement. A regression analysis and Bland-Altman analysis were used to compare the two methods of CO determination. Results A total of 40 CO determinations were performed in 10 patients. Table 1 reports the main results. Figure 1 and use in severe sepsis compared with 2003 can be seen in Table 1 . ",

The HLOS and the incidence of complications were determined for patients with low (<70%) or normal (\u226570%) ScVO 2 . Results Sixty-three postoperative patients were screened and 23 patients were analysed. Patients were excluded if they did not have a central line positioned in the superior vena cava or blood had not been sampled at both time points. Patients with pre-ICU HLOS > 5 days (n = 10), acute spinal cord injury (n = 3), or admitted for postoperative airway management (n = 4) were omitted. ScVO 2 was low in 7/23 patients at T2 and six of these had lower gastrointestinal surgery. The HLOS (median (IQR)) was longer in those with low ScVO 2 at T2 (17 (37.8) v 9.5 (5.0) days, P = 0.04). The incidence of complications was not different. There were no differences between the ScVO 2 groups at T2 with respect to age, gender, standard base excess, lactate, haemoglobin, mean arterial pressure or central venous pressure. The volume of colloid the two groups received in the 8-hour observation period was not different although there was a trend for the low group to receive more crystalloid (P = 0.08). Conclusion A significant proportion of patients had a low ScVO 2 , which was associated with increased HLOS. The results provide a basis for the trial of postoperative early goal-directed therapy for high-risk surgical patients admitted to our ICU. However, ScvO 2 is also affected by arterial oxygen saturation (SpO 2 ), oxygen consumption, and hemoglobin (Hb) according to the formula: ScvO 2 = SpO 2 -(VO 2 / Q*1/Hb). The aim of this study was to investigate the relative influence of hypoxemia and anemia on the measurement of ScvO 2 . Methods A database of 700 pairs of arterial and central venous blood gases drawn from 300 patients admitted to the ICU of a university hospital was considered. After assessing for the technical adequacy of sampling (defined as a discrepancy of hematocrit and blood glucose between arterial and venous samples lower than 5%), 462 couples were selected for analysis. Samples were then clustered according to ScvO 2 : <70% (low), \u226570% (high). SpO 2 , partial pressure of oxygen (PaO 2 ) and Hb were considered. Venous to arterial difference of partial pressure of CO 2 (DpCO 2 ), arterial to venous difference of oxygen content (DavO 2 ) and the oxygen extraction ratio (ER) were also considered as measures of perfusion adequacy. Differences between low and high ScvO 2 samples were estimated by Mann-Whitney rank sum test (Sigma Stat, SPSS), accepting P < 0.05 as significant. Data are presented as median (25th-75th percentile). As expected, DpCO 2 , DavO 2 and ER were different between high and low ScvO 2 groups (P < 0.001). However, while Hb was similar (P = 0.670), SpO 2 and PaO 2 were significantly lower when ScvO 2 was below 70% (P < 0.001). Normalization of ScvO 2 to SpO 2 (ScvO 2 /SpO 2 ) allowed one to overcome the effects of hypoxemia. Values were: 0.662 (0.603-0.693) in the low group and 0.794 (0.757-0.828) in the high group (P < 0.001).",

Yet, it is still not widely practised due to logistical difficulties associated with its use. We aimed to evaluate whether pulse power analysis calibrated by the lithium dilution technique, a pragmatic minimally invasive technique, can be used to optimize the oxygen delivery index (DO 2 I) in high-risk patients during major surgery. Methods Lithium indicator dilution and pulse power analysis were used to measure cardiac output and to calculate DO 2 I (LiDCOplus system). We prospectively evaluated the oxygen delivery pattern and perfusion variables of 26 high-risk patients (LiDCO group) submitted to major surgeries and goal-directed therapy during surgery and 8 hours postoperatively, aiming to maximize the DO 2 I to levels higher than 600 ml/min/m 2 using dobutamine and either 'restrictive' (4 ml/kg/min) or 'liberal' (12 ml/kg/min) strategies of intraoperative fluid management (partial results). Postoperatively both groups received 1.5 ml/kg/min lactated ringer. Fluid challenge with 250 ml colloid was done in the presence of signs of hypovolemia and additional fluids were given if necessary. Patients were considered responders if they achieved the therapeutic goal. A historical group of 42 high-risk surgical patients in whom the therapeutic goals were to keep a mean arterial pressure between 80 and 110 mmHg, a central venous pressure between 6 and 12 cmH 2 O, hematocrit > 30% and urine output > 0.5 ml/kg/hour in the first 24 hours after ICU admission was used as control.

Methods In this prospective, intervention and response study, 30\u00b0P LR of both legs was performed in 20 supine patients receiving mechanical ventilation after elective cardiothoracic surgery. The thermodilution cardiac output (COtd), heart rate, central venous pressure (CVP), MAP, PP, SP and SVV measurements were performed before, during and after PLR. Results The COtd, MAP, CVP, PP and SP increased after PLR. No change in heart rate and systemic vascular resistance was observed. We found a significant correlation between PLRinduced changes in COtd versus SVV during baseline (slope = 0.902, P = 0.003), changes in MAP (slope = 0.499, P = 0.003), PP (slope = 0.190, P = 0.024) and SP (slope = 0.276, P = 0.021).

We hypothesized that the SCD Response System could shift blood volume toward the thoracic compartment comparable with a volume challenge, with an increase in preload index such as the intrathoracic blood volume index (ITBVI) and stroke volume index (SVI). The aim of the study was to evaluate the relationships between changes in SVI (\u2206SVI) induced by SCD and \u2206SVI induced by rapid fluid loading (RFL) in critically ill patients. Methods Twenty-seven patients (mean age 60 \u00b1 9.1 years) admitted to the ICU were studied. Each patient received conventional monitoring plus hemodynamic-volumetric monitoring (PiCCO System; Pulsion Medical Systems, Munich, Germany). The heart rate, mean arterial pressure, central venous pressure, cardiac index, ITBVI, and SVI were recorded in the supine position before and after treatment with the SCD Express Compression System \u00ae . The same data where collected before and after a RFL performed with 3 ml/kg hydroxyethyl starch 6%. The relationships between \u2206SVI induced by SCD and \u2206SVI induced by RFL were analyzed by linear regression analysis. Statistical significance was considered to be at P <0.05. Results Linear regression analysis between \u2206SVI induced by SCD (\u2206SCD) and \u2206SVI induced by RFL (\u2206RFL) showed r 2 = 0.50 (P = 0.0002). When analyzed in a subgroup of spontaneously breathing versus mechanically ventilated patients, the relationships observed were respectively r 2 = 0.41 (P < 0.01) ( Figure 1 ) and r 2 = 0.73 (P < 0.007) (Figure 2 ). Conclusions The SCD Response System could shift blood volume toward the thoracic compartment comparable with RFL better in mechanically ventilated than in spontaneously breathing patients. Larger population studies are needed to confirm these preliminary data. S127 amplitude, as they both depend on the stroke volume. We designed a prospective study to evaluate the correlation between respiratory arterial PP variation and POP waveform amplitude variations in ventilated patients and the influence of acute lung injury (ALI) in this relationship. Methods Sixty patients were included in the study. Thirty-nine (65%) had diagnosis of ALI and 21 (35%) had normal gas exchange, defined as a relation of PaO 2 to FiO 2 (P/F) below and above 300, respectively. Respiratory variation in arterial PP and POP waveform amplitude were recorded simultaneously on a beatto-beat basis, and mean values of two measures for each parameter were compared for correlation and agreement. Results Respiratory variation in POP waveform amplitude could accurately predict variation in arterial PP with a sensibility of 83.3%, specificity of 85.7%, positive predictive value (PPV) of 71.4 and negative predictive value (NPV) of 92.3. The area under the ROC curve was 0.88 (0.79-0.97) with a best cutoff value of 14% to predict a variation in arterial PP of 13%. The kappa index of agreement was 0.65 (P < 0.001). Eighteen (30%) patients had variations in arterial PP above 13%, and 21 (35%) showed variations in POP waveform amplitude above 14%. In patients without ALI (P/F > 300) the sensibility was 100%, specificity was 93.3%, NPV was 100% and PPV was 80%. In the group with ALI (P/F < 300) the kappa index measure of agreement was 0.55, and in the group without ALI the kappa index was 0.85. PEEP levels were not different between the groups. Conclusion Respiratory variation in arterial PP above 13% can be accurately predicted by a variation in POP waveform amplitude of 14% with good correlation and agreement. Our results confirm the findings of a recent trial and suggest that the correlation is even stronger when ALI is absent. These findings raise potential clinical applications of respiratory variation in POP waveform amplitude for haemodynamic management of patients without an arterial catheter. Introduction Goal-directed intraoperative fluid therapy reduced the hospital stay after major surgery [1] . Aortic vascular surgery is associated with excessive blood loss and massive fluid shift [2] . We found that postoperative urea and creatinine improved when intravascular fluid volume was maintained using transoesophageal Doppler. Methods We randomly selected 40 patients who underwent elective infrarenal aortic surgery (aortic aneurysm repair/aortobifemoral grafting). All patients' cardiac output was continuously monitored using a transoesophageal Doppler probe (EDM\u2122; Deltex Medical, Inc., Irving, TX, USA). The corrected flow time (FTc) was recorded immediately after induction as a baseline and recorded again pre-extubation. A target FTc of 375-425 ms was aimed for. The estimated total blood loss was calculated for each patient at the end of surgery. Preoperative and 24-hour postoperative urea and creatinine were recorded for comparison.",

Results All pharmaceutical-grade products show a purity ranging from 95% to 108%. The main contaminant proteins are prealbumin, transferrin, \u03b1-1 acid glycoprotein, haptoglobulin, and retinol-binding protein. All of them are in conformity with the European Pharmacopeia specifications. The warfarin-binding capacity of the 10 albumin preparations was studied. An average binding constant of 2.6 (\u00b10.3) x 10 5 M -1 (n = 1) was found. The presence of stabilisers reduced the binding of dansylsarcosine significantly (by 27-40%). The esterase-like activity toward pnitrophenyl acetate and the reactivity of Cys34 differed from product to product. Interesting is the absence of free Cys34 in the recombinant albumin. Conclusion Significant differences were observed between the 10 different human albumin preparations, recombinant or not. We confirm that the presence of stabilisers such as tryptophan derivatives significantly reduces the binding capacity of Sudlow's site II. Two important physiological properties of albumin, the esterase-like and antioxidant activities, were also found to be modified to different extents in all pharmaceutical-grade products in comparison with the albumin without stabiliser. The benefits of albumin administration should be considered carefully, taking into account the different functions and properties of albumin. Aims and methods A clinical scenario was used to assess current knowledge among medical staff regarding i.v. fluid therapy. 'An 85year-old lady is brought into A&E semiconscious. Temperature 32\u00b0C, blood pressure 90/50 mmHg and BM 6.5 mmol/l. Arterial blood gases (ABG) on room air: pH 7.12 pO 2 10.8 kPa, pCO 2 2.6 kPa, HCO 3 -12 mmol/l, O 2 saturation 94% and base excess -19'. Medical staff were asked to complete a questionnaire relating to the case under supervised conditions. Results Eighty-seven questionnaires were completed by seven SpR/consultants, 48 F2/senior house officers, 13 F1 and 19 finalyear medical students. ABG interpretation was correct in 80/87 (92%). Only 52/87 (59.8%) could calculate the anion gap and only 1/87 listed fluid as a cause of a metabolic acidosis. Eighty-three staff (93.4%) knew that a metabolic acidosis caused an increased respiratory rate. Normal saline was the first-choice fluid for resuscitation in almost 60% (52/87) cases. The chloride concentration of normal saline was known by 12/87 staff (13.8%). The serum chloride concentration was known by 28/87 staff (32%). Conclusion The majority of medical staff prescribe normal saline as their first-choice intravenous fluid. Many medical staff are unaware of the electrolyte composition of normal saline, the phenomenon of hyperchloraemic metabolic acidosis, or how to differentiate hyperchloraemic metabolic acidosis from lactic acidosis by calculating the anion gap. A good understanding of fluid therapy is important for all medical staff.",

            "text": "Introduction Postoperative outcomes may be improved if cardiac output and oxygen delivery are maintained at optimal levels. Trials of the use of dopexamine for this purpose have yielded inconsistent results. This may relate to the use of high doses in some trials. A meta-analysis of data from these trials may therefore identify a benefit of low-dose dopexamine on postoperative mortality and length of stay. Methods A comprehensive literature review was performed to identify published randomised trials of perioperative dopexamine infusion in patients undergoing major surgery. Individual patient S129 data were obtained, allowing a meta-regression approach to explore mortality outcomes after correction for age and dose of dopexamine. A Cox proportional hazards model was constructed to examine the length of stay. Results Five studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] . Low-dose dopexamine (\u22641 \u00b5g/kg/min) was associated with a 49% reduction in 28-day mortality (6.3% vs 12.3%; OR = 0.51 (95% CI 0.29-0.89), P = 0.008). The length of postoperative stay was also reduced in the low-dose dopexamine group compared with control (median 13 vs 15 days, HR 0.75 (95% CI 0.65-0.88), P = 0.004). High-dose dopexamine (>1 \u00b5g/kg/min) was not associated with a difference in mortality (14.5% vs 12.3%; OR = 1.18 (95% CI 0.67-2.08), P = 0.37) or length of stay (median 17 vs 15 days, HR 1.10 (95% CI 0.90-1.34), P = 0.37) when compared with controls. Conclusions Perioperative use of low-dose dopexamine decreases mortality and duration of hospital stay in patients undergoing major surgery. The blood pressure waveform carries information about the cardiac contraction and the impedance characteristics of the vascular bed. Here, we demonstrate that the start of isovolumic ventricular contraction is persistently reflected as an inflection point in the pressure wave as recorded in the aortic root (TPIC) as well as in the carotid artery distension waveform (TDIC) as it travels down the arterial tree. In a group of six patients with normal pressure gradients across the aortic valve after valve replacement, the TPIC had a small delay with respect to the onset of isovolumic ventricular contraction (<10 ms). In a group (n = 21) of young, presumably healthy, volunteers, the inflection point occurred persistently in the carotid distension waveform, as recorded by means of ultrasound, before the systolic foot (intersubject delay between inflection point and systolic foot: mean \u00b1 SD = 40.0 \u00b1 9.4 ms, intrasubject SD 4.6 ms). Retrograde coronary blood flow during isovolumic ventricular contraction may be the origin of the persistent end-diastolic pressure and distension perturbation. This study shows that the duration of the isovolumic contraction can be reliably extracted from the carotid artery distension waveform.",

Method All admissions for bariatric surgery between 1 April 2003 and 30 April 2006 were reviewed retrospectively. These procedures were performed on two sites, the Royal Hallamshire Hospital (RHH) and Thornbury Hospital (TH). The critical care admissions and length of hospital stay (LOS) were reviewed. Results A total of 497 patients were identified as having had bariatric surgery. After review of hospital and critical care admission data, a total of 473 were identified with complete data. Of these, 94 (19.9%) were open procedures (OP), 260 (55.0%) laparoscopic bandings (LB) and 119 (25.1%) laparoscopic gastric bypasses (LGB). The age range was 16-68 years. The average hospital LOS for OP was 6.8 days, for LGB 4.0 days and for LB 1.9 days. Surgical procedures and HDU admissions increased annually (2003) (2004) (2005) (2006) from 74 to 249, and 21 to 107, respectively. As a proportion, open procedures declined from 60% to 7%, and laparoscopic interventions increased (LB from 40% to 63% and LGB from 0% to 30%). There were a total of 14 admissions to the ITU by 10 patients, of which seven had undergone an initial OP. No admissions were elective and eight patients required further surgical interventions. HDU admissions occurred on both sites, with 148/277 (53.4%) of patients admitted to HDU at TH, and 53/196 (27.6%) at RHH. At TH only three patients required level 2 care, and 95 were discharged within 26 hours. At RHH, 16 patients required level 2 care, and 38 were discharged within 26 hours. Discussion The requirement for ITU admission in this surgical group is, and has remained, low, despite a significant increase in bariatric surgical procedures. This increase is predominantly laparoscopic surgery. HDU activity has increased as the service has expanded; however, 90.4% of this is level 1 care, particularly at TH, where admission to the HDU is a matter of policy rather than clinical necessity. Availability of a level 1 facility would significantly decrease the requirement for HDU provision -an important consideration when introducing a new bariatric service.

Introduction Critically ill patients with severe sepsis or septic shock have a very high mortality rate. The aim of our study was to investigate the impact of intra-abdominal hypertension (IAH) on the outcome of patients with or without severe sepsis/septic shock. Methods Two hundred and fifty-three mechanically ventilated patients admitted to the general ICU of Tartu University Hospital were prospectively studied. Patients who had severe sepsis or septic shock at admission or developed it during their first week of stay were compared with patients not suffering from severe sepsis. IAH was defined as sustained intra-abdominal pressure above or equal to 12 mmHg developing within the first week in the ICU. Results Severe sepsis or septic shock was observed in 123 patients (48.6%). The ICU mortality among these patients was 33.3% compared with 18.5% in nonseptic patients (P = 0.005). IAH developed in 95 patients (37.0%). The incidence of IAH was higher among septic patients (45.5% vs 28.5%, P = 0.004). Those septic patients who developed IAH had a mortality rate of 50.0% compared with 19.4% in septic patients without IAH (P < 0.001). Mortality among nonseptic patients was not different between the patients with or without IAH (18.9% vs 18.3%). Development of IAH was a significant risk factor for death in septic patients (OR 4.15; 95% CI 1.87-9.26), but not in nonseptic patients (OR 1.04; 95% CI 0.39-2.77).",

The abdominal pressure-volume relation can be described by a linear relation giving an elastance (E) and a pressure at zero volume (P V0 ). The goal of this study was to measure this relation in a large group of patients with different characteristics looking for the factors that influence and explain this relation. It is believed that obese persons have higher abdominal pressures and it is unclear whether muscle relaxation lowers it. A large group of 70 patients, ASA class I or II, between 21 and 75 years old and scheduled for laparoscopic surgery were included in this study with approval from the hospital ethical committee. Anaesthesia was induced with propofol 200 mg, sufentanil 20 \u00b5g, and sevoflurane 1.5 Mac in 50% O 2 /N 2 O. Some patients were fully muscle relaxed with nimbex 20 mg while others not. Patients were asked to empty the bladder before surgery. The stomach was emptied by suction through a gastric tube. An Olympus insufflator UHI-3 was initialised and the abdomen was inflated with a stepwise flow to 7, 10, 13 and 16 mmHg. When the pressure was reached, flow was stopped and the actual pressure and volume measured giving four data points. E and P V0 were calculated by fitting to a linear relation. The following recorded determinants were evaluated by regression analysis for their effect: age, length, weight, BMI, sex, gravidity and muscle relaxation. P V0 increases significantly with body weight and decreases significantly with muscle relaxation. ",

The present study assesses whether this might be explained by differences in patient factor or in factors at resuscitation. Methods An analysis of IHCA data collected from one Swedish tertiary hospital and from five Finnish secondary hospitals over a 10-year period. The study was limited to patients surviving to be discharged from the hospital. Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to identify factors associated with survival at 1 year from the arrest. . There was no difference in initial rhythm, delay to defibrillation or delay to return of spontaneous circulation between survivors and nonsurvivors at 12 months. Conclusion Several patient factors, mainly age, functional status and co-morbid disease, influence long-term survival following IHCA. Location of the arrest also influences survival, but the initial rhythm, the delays to defibrillation and return of spontaneous circulation do not. Introduction Mild hypothermia (32-34\u00b0C) is a promising new therapy for patients resuscitated from cardiac arrest. Animal studies suggest that early and fast cooling is crucial for beneficial effect on neurological outcome. Inducing mild hypothermia immediately after successful restoration of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) in the out-of-hospital setting remains a challenge. Therefore, a novel cooling-blanket (EMCOOLSpad \u00ae ), independent of any energy source during use, was developed. The aim of the study was to evaluate feasibility and safety of out-of-hospital surface cooling with EMCOOLSpad \u00ae in patients successfully resuscitated from cardiac arrest. Methods We included patients successfully resuscitated from outof-hospital cardiac arrest with an oesophageal temperature (T es ) >34\u00b0C. The EMCOOLSpad \u00ae consists of multiple cooling units (12 mm thick), filled with a mixture of graphite/water, which are stored in a cooling box at -3\u00b0C in the ambulance car. Cooling was initiated as soon as feasible by the first treating paramedics and emergency physicians, and was continued in the emergency room. The cooling-blanket was removed when the T es reached 34\u00b0C. The target temperature of T es 33\u00b0C was maintained for 24 hours. Data are presented as the median and interquartile range (25-75%).",

Methods We performed retrospective analysis of all consecutive cardiac arrest survivors treated by MH in our CCU from November 2002 to August 2006. They were classified into two groups, according to whether they met the criteria for cardiogenic shock or not after ROSC and just before MH initiation.

Following a 10-minute baseline, subjects received 30 minutes head cooling followed by 30 minutes head and neck cooling. The cooling device delivered air at 11\u00baC and 15 m/s through a hood and separate neck collar made of a double layer of nylon sheeting, the inner layer pierced with holes. Subjects wore a windproof waistcoat taped round the base of their neck and were wrapped in blankets from the base of the neck down. Bilateral foot warming with chemical hot packs was used to encourage heat loss in the presence of normothermia. MRS temperature data were collected at the level of the basal ganglia over the baseline and the last 10 minutes of each cooling intervention. MRS detects naturally occurring brain metabolites and interpretation of the relative frequencies of N-acetyl aspartate and water allows estimation of tissue temperature in 1 cm 3 voxels. For assessment of regional cooling, voxels lying within the region formed by joining the tips of the lateral ventricles were defined as 'core', voxels within approximately one voxel of the brain surface were defined as 'outer', and all other voxels were defined as 'intermediate'. The oesophageal temperature was measured continuously with a fluoroptic thermometer. The mean baseline-corrected MRS brain temperature over all voxels reduced by -0.45\u00baC (SD 0.23\u00baC, P = 0.01, 5% CI -0.74 to -0.17\u00baC) with head cooling and -0.37\u00baC (SD 0.30\u00baC, P = 0.049, 95% CI -0.74 to 0.00\u00baC) with head and neck cooling. Head cooling reduced the mean baseline-corrected MRS brain temperature in core voxels in all subjects. The formal test for gradient was not significant (P = 0.43; 95% CI -0.15 to 0.29\u00baC). Head and neck cooling reduced the temperature in core voxels in three subjects; the test for gradient was not significant (P = 0.07; 95% CI -0.03 to 0.58\u00baC).

Preclinical introduction of mild hypothermia by means of 4\u00b0C cold solutions could be a beneficial criteria in the future treatment, and probably affects the outcome of these patients. Introduction Therapeutic hypothermia (TH) following cardiac arrest is associated with several complications including symptomatic bradycardia, coagulopathy, and pneumonia [1] . Furthermore, hyperthermia is associated with poor outcome following brain injury. The incidence of these complications may be increased by excessive temperature fluctuations. We sought to compare complications between two techniques used to induce TH; surface cooling (SC) using ice packs, and endovascular cooling (EV), using the Coolgard\u2122 system (Alsius Corp., USA). Methods A retrospective review was performed of all cardiac arrest patients undergoing TH and surviving \u226548 hours between June 2005 and November 2006. Results Thirty-five patients underwent our TH protocol (SC group = 21, EV group = 14). The incidence of overcooling (<32\u00b0C) in the SC group was significantly higher than the EV group (10 vs 1, P = 0.01), whilst a trend towards more episodes of symptomatic bradycardia (SC 9 vs EV 2, P = 0.07) and rebound hyperthermia (SC 9 vs EV 2, P = 0.07) was also present. The incidence of pneumonia (SC 7 vs EV 4, P = 0.77) and coagulopathy/bleeding (SC 2 vs EV 3, P = 0.32) were similar between groups. Conclusions (1) SC is associated with a significantly higher incidence of overcooling than EC and may be associated with an increase in complications such as symptomatic bradycardia. (2) SC may also be associated with an increase in rebound hyperthermia. Introduction Hypothermia may be therapeutically beneficial in stroke victims; however, it provokes vigorous shivering. Buspirone, a partial serotonin 1A antagonist, and dexmedetomidine, an \u03b1 2 agonist, linearly reduce the shivering threshold (triggering core temperature) with minimal sedation and respiratory depression. We tested the hypothesis that buspirone and dexmedetomidine synergistically reduce the shivering threshold without producing substantial sedation or respiratory depression. Methods We studied four healthy male volunteers (18-40) on 4 days: (1) control (no drug); (2) buspirone only (60 mg orally); (3) dexmedetomidine only (target plasma concentration 0.6 ng/ml); and (4) combined buspirone and dexmedetomidine in the same doses. Lactated Ringer's solution (3\u00b0C) was infused via a central venous catheter to decrease tympanic membrane temperature by \u22482.2\u00b0C/hour; the mean skin temperature was maintained at 31\u00b0C. An increase in oxygen consumption more than 25% of baseline identified the shivering threshold. Sedation was evaluated using the Observer's Assessment Sedation/Alertness scale. Two-way repeated-measures analysis of variance was used to identify interactions between drugs. Data are presented as means \u00b1 SDs; P < 0.05 was statistically significant.",

No survivor recalled the period of NMB. First NMB was administered a median of 5 hours after cardiac arrest or 87 minutes after initiation of TH, at 35.6 \u00b1 1.7\u00b0C. Patients with GO had a higher first post-NMB BIS (39 \u00b1 6 vs 13 \u00b1 14, P < 0.001) and a lower SR (10 \u00b1 12 vs 69 \u00b1 29, P < 0.001) than those with CPC 3-5. Initial NMB reduced frontotemporal electromyogram (EMG) power from 52 \u00b1 8 to 27 \u00b1 1 db, P < 0.001. In 17 of the patients with downloaded EEG data, an increase in EMG power of 17 dB (IQR 10-27) from baseline was associated with clinically detectable shivering. Epileptiform discharges were noted on the monitor during NMB in two patients, and seizure activity was confirmed by formal EEG in both.",

            "text": "Conclusions In cardiac arrest survivors receiving TH, a higher post-NMB BIS score and a lower SR are very early predictors of neurological outcome. The potential benefits of monitoring BIS and SR, as well as EMG power for early recognition of shivering, and continuous frontotemporal EEG to detect seizures, warrant further study. Electroencephalogram (EEG) is an appropriate monitoring tool in intensive care because it is linked to cerebral metabolism, is sensitive to ischaemia/hypoxia, can detect neuronal dysfunction at a reversible stage and is the best method to detect seizure activity. Scientific data have proved utility of continuous EEG monitoring in intensive care [1, 2] . But there is a paucity of data relating to single recordings of EEG especially in general ICUs. A retrospective chart review of patients who had bedside EEG in a medical-surgical ICU was done. Data were collected with a focus on: indication for requesting EEG, technical difficulties during the study, the report and its influence on subsequent clinical management. Forty-two charts were reviewed. The indications were: evaluation of persistent comatose state (n = 27), to diagnose/exclude seizure activity and nonconvulsive status epilepsy (n = 12), and as an adjunct to support clinical diagnosis of suspected brain death prior to formal testing (n = 3). Movement artifacts led to technical difficulty in four studies. EEG confirmed: moderate to severe nonspecific brain dysfunction as the cause for persistent comatose state by the presence of either diffuse slowing with theta/delta activity, absence of cerebral activity, continuous rhythmic and semi rhythmic lateralized/bilateral epileptiform discharges, burst suppression pattern or continuous bilateral slow U-shaped waves; anoxic brain damage by absence of changes in electrical signals following external application of noxious stimuli; and seizure activity by epileptiform discharges. Twelve reports stated that use of sedation interfered with EEG interpretation.",

We also found that the end diastolic velocities (V min ) were significant lower during the pump deflation. None of our patients had a significant diastolic flow velocity reversal during the pump deflation. Conclusions Left ventricular support with IABP significantly changed the flow velocity pattern of our patients. The pump significantly increased the V max and the V mean at the 1:2 and 1:3 settings because of pump inflation during the diastole. We suggest that the velocities did not change at the 1:1 setting because the end-diastolic flow velocities reduce during every pulse, according to pump deflation. Background Patients with critical illness can acquire a syndrome of weakness and dependence on mechanical ventilation that has been linked to peripheral nerve and muscle injury. Our aim was to systematically review published data on the diagnosis, risk factors and outcomes of patients with critical illness neuromuscular abnormalities (CINMA). Methods MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and the Cochrane Library were searched, and studies were included if they reported on ICU patients > 16 years old who were evaluated for CINMA clinically and electrophysiologically, and they contained sufficient data to quantitatively measure the association between CINMA and clinically relevant exposures and/or outcomes. Two reviewers independently extracted data on study methodology and quality, methods for diagnosing CINMA, and CINMA prevalence, risk factors, and outcomes. Results In 1,421 ICU patients who were evaluated in 24 studies, 655 (46%) were diagnosed with CINMA. All enrolled patients were receiving protracted mechanical ventilation, had sepsis, or had multiple organ failure. Diagnostic criteria for CINMA were heterogeneous and few reports explicitly differentiated between the polyneuropathic, myopathic and mixed types of CINMA. CINMA was linked in several studies to hyperglycemia, the systemic inflammatory response syndrome, sepsis, renal replacement therapy, and catecholamine administration. In contrast, across studies there was no consistent relationship between CINMA and patient age, gender, severity of illness, multiple organ failure, and use of glucocorticoids, neuromuscular blockers, aminoglycosides, or midazolam. Mortality was not increased in patients with CINMA, but mechanical ventilation and ICU and hospital stays were prolonged. Conclusions The risk of CINMA is nearly 50% in a subset of ICU patients with sepsis, multiorgan failure, or protracted mechanical ventilation, but there were no data to support CINMA as an independent predictor of death. The impact of frequently cited risk factors is uncertain, but emerging data indicate glycemic control decreases CINMA risk in vulnerable patients.",

However, patients with intraperitoneal extravasation required more aggressive transfusion with packed red cells and had a higher mortality rate in the first 24 hours. Techniques suggested during primary survey include Xray of C-spine, chest and pelvis. This can be time consuming and radiation intensive. In comparison with conventional multiple radiographs, Lodox (Statscan), a full-body digital radiology device, performs a.p. and lateral whole-body examinations in 3-5 minutes with about one-third of the irradiation and without the necessity for lifting patients. This is the first device installed in Europe. Methods This paper describes our experience with the use of a new low-dose X-ray technique as part of our modified ATLS algorithm, where single-total a.p./lateral body radiographs have been implemented as adjuncts to primary survey in favour of several conventional X-rays. Results There were 94 patients (males = 59; females = 35) between 4 October and 9 December 2006; age range from 1 to 86 years. The ISS ranged from 3 to 75 (ISS > 16 in 54/94 patients). The average time for obtaining LODOX radiographs was 3.5 minutes (range 3-6 min). The mean time in the resuscitation room (during primary and secondary surveys) was 28.7 minutes with the new technique compared with 29 minutes before implementing LODOX (median time 27 min to 24 min). In 54/94 patients an additional full body CT scan was performed as adjunct to secondary survey. In only 14/54 patients were additional conventional X-rays necessary to visualize the skeleton. Conclusion The implementation of a modified ATLS algorithm using LODOX allows a complete a.p. and lateral whole-body examination without a significant increase in the time taken for resuscitation.",

Method In a retrospective study performed at a Level I trauma center, we considered all adult patients with major trauma (ISS > 15) and femoral shaft fracture admitted between January 2003 and July 2006. Patients were separated into two groups according to the management strategies for the femoral fracture: group 1, no surgery within 72 hours after primary admission; group 2, surgical stabilization within 72 hours (DCO). To compare the two groups we considered age, ISS, RTS, TRISS, SAPS II, GCS, comorbidity, and other associated surgery. Parameters of evaluation were: mortality in the ICU, ICU length of stay, respiratory failure and length of ventilation, and daily SOFA collected for 8 days.",

Method All the consecutive patients admitted to the ER of Careggi Hospital that evolved to brain death after head trauma during the period January 2004-June 2006 were considered (n = 54). The following parameters were considered for the study: prehospital phase: hypoxemia (SaO 2 < 95%), hypotension (SAPS II < 90 mmHg), orotracheal intubation, fluids (>1,000 or \u22641,000 ml), and GCS; ER phase (ATLS approach): hypoxemia, hypotension, orotracheal intubation, fluids, GCS, blood lactate, pharyngeal temperature, and ISS; ICU stay: SAPS II, daily SOFA score, blood lactate, core temperature, glycaemia, and ScVO 2 (>75% or \u226475%). On the basis of the timing of brain death, the patients were divided into two groups: group 1 (n = 27), brain death occurred in the first 3 days; group 2 (n = 27), brain death occurred in the days after. Statistics were determined with the Student t and chi-squared tests; P < 0.05 was considered significant. Results The significant differences between the two groups are reported in Table 1 . A strict relationship exists between early brain death and prehospital treatment. During the ICU stay low levels of ScVO 2 and high levels of glycaemia are related to early brain death. Conclusion The results of the study confirm that prehospital hypotension is the main risk factor for an early evolution to brain death in head trauma. Also, patients that have prolonged hypoperfusion and neurohormonal imbalance after the postresuscitation phase present an increased risk of brain death.",

The decreases in haemostatic activity and postoperative bleeding are probably due to anticoagulant therapy as well as fibrinogen and platelet consumption. An increased preoperative haemostatic activity is probably due to an acute phase reaction associated with advanced atherosclerosis, and the high intraoperative bleeding in these patients might be due to the atherosclerotic vessels rather than due to an insufficient haemostasis. Objective Cardiac surgery, in particular when done with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), is frequently associated with excessive intraoperative and postoperative bleeding. Here we employed the Technothrombin \u00ae thrombin generation assay (TGA; Technoclone) to monitor changes in perioperative haemostasis. Methods One hundred and forty-eight patients (age 66.0 \u00b1 9.8 years; 103 males, 45 females) with elective cardiac surgery and a CPB time >45 minutes (mean 114 \u00b1 56 min) were enrolled. Arterial blood samples were obtained preoperative, postoperative and 14-18 hours postoperative and centrifuged within 30 minutes after withdrawal, for 5 minutes at 5,000 x g. Plasma samples were stored until analysis at -80\u00b0C. Thrombin generation (TG) induced by the TGA RC low reagent (71.6 pM tissue factor) was measured in 96-well multiplates using a FLUOstar OPTIMA fluorescence reader (MWG Labtech). Results Due to cardiac surgery, the lag-phase and time-to-peak of TG increased by 45% and 35%, respectively. In parallel, the peak thrombin concentration and maximum slope decreased by 42% and 51%, respectively (P < 0.000001). Both the lag-phase and time-to-peak returned to basal values within 14-18 hours postoperative, but the peak thrombin and maximum slope of TG rose above the preoperative values (+39% and +68%, P < 0.0005). The on-pump time was positively correlated with lag phase and time to peak and negatively correlated with peak thrombin and maximum slope of TG when measured at 14-18 hours postoperative, but there was no correlation at early postoperative. With respect to classical coagulation parameters, significant correlations were observed between TG and activated partial thromboplastin time at preoperative and 14-18 hours postoperative, and between TG and prothrombin time at postoperative (P < 0.025-0.001). At 14-18 hours postoperative there was a significant correlation of TG with platelet as well as leukocyte counts (P < 0.025).",

Methods A before-and-after, observational, single-centre study. Subjects were 211 consecutive patients undergoing open repair of a ruptured AAA between 1998 and 2006. Primary outcome was development of ALI (PaO 2 /FiO 2 < 300 and bilateral pulmonary infiltrates on chest X-ray) in the first 6 hours after surgery.

Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), a member of the lipocalin family of proteins, has been shown to be an early biomarker of ischaemic renal damage. We prospectively investigated the use of these proteins as markers of severity of illness and prognostication in acute and acute-on-chronic liver failure requiring intensive care. Methods NGAL and Gc globulin were measured on admission to our unit using a sandwich ELISA technique (AntibodyShop \u00ae ) in 17 patients with acute liver failure (ALF) and 11 patients with acute-onchronic liver disease (ACLD). Biochemical and physiological variables were collected prospectively and entered into a physiological database (ICARE). All measurements were taken on day 1 of admission. Results are expressed as the median and interquartile range. Results The mean number of PDRs/patient was three. The mean PDR was 17% (range: 3.3-51%).

This study aimed to analyse the incidence of relative adrenal insufficiency (RAI) in these patients, to identify factors associated with relative adrenal insufficiency and to describe how adrenal responsiveness affects outcome. Methods In a prospective observational multicenter study, a short Synacthen test (SST) was performed within 5 days after admission to the hospital in 25 patients with severe acute pancreatitis, after signed informed consent was obtained. The incidence of RAI, defined as an increment after SST of less than 9 \u00b5g/dl, was the primary endpoint of the study.

The type and amount of fluid used in resuscitation may be important determinants of the amount of edema formed. Ringers' lactate (RL) and normal saline (NS) remain common resuscitative fluids. These experiments were designed to measure the extravascular lung water (EVLW) after resuscitation from hemorrhagic shock with RL vs NS, to determine whether the fluid type results in differences in the amount of EVLW, and to determine whether there exists a threshold amount of fluid that results in the development of edema. Methods This was a randomized controlled trial using 20 female Yorkshire crossbred pigs. Animals were mechanically ventilated. Anesthesia was maintained using 2% isofluorane in 100% oxygen. Continuous hemodynamic monitoring, blood sampling, and determination of EVLW by single indicator transpulmonary dilution was done using a PiCCO plus monitor (Pulsion Medical System, Munich, Germany). The animals underwent a midline celiotomy, S163 suprapubic Foley catheter placement, and splenectomy. The spleen was weighed and, based on randomization, either LR or NS solution was infused to replace three times the spleen weight in grams. Following a 15-minute stabilization period, a standardized Grade V liver injury (injury to a central hepatic vein) was then created using a specialized clamp. Following 30 minutes of uncontrolled hemorrhage, we blindly randomized the swine to receive either NS or RL resuscitation at 165 ml/min. Resuscitation fluid was administered to achieve and maintain the baseline mean arterial pressure (MAP) for 90 minutes post injury.

The toxicity was determined by plasma membrane integrity, DNA fragmentation, phosphatidylserine externalization, mitochondrial depolarization, production of reactive oxygen species and neutral lipid accumulation. Results Both lipid emulsions decreased lymphocyte proliferation and induced cell death, but the effects of soybean oil-based emulsion were more pronounced. Soybean oil-based emulsion provoked apoptosis and necrosis, whereas olive oil-based emulsion caused neutrophil and lymphocyte necrosis only.

Forty-seven per cent were from university hospitals. Twenty-six per cent had a sedation protocol, 37% of the physicians and 14% of the nurses. Only one-third of the ICUs had a protocol for sedation. Sixty-eight per cent having a protocol used it always or often, whereas 32% never use it. Sixtyseven per cent had a sedation scoring system in their departments. The scoring systems used was: Ramsay 49%, Sedation Agitation Score 10% and own (locally made) scoring system 41%. Twentytwo per cent answered that the scoring systems was always used, 58% often and in 20% the scoring systems was seldom used. Forty per sent use the 'wake-up call' test, 63% physicians and 37% nurses. Sixty per cent answered 'no we do not use' the wake-up call test, 47% physicians and 53% nurses. Withdrawal symptoms were experienced more than three times as frequently by nurses compared with physicians (31% vs 9%). Five times as many experienced withdrawal symptoms in the group not having a sedation and analgesia protocol (84% vs 16%). Conclusions There is still a great educational potential for improving the use of sedation protocols and implementing sedation scoring systems and the wake up test in Danish ICUs. This potential could perhaps reduce the incidence of withdrawal symptoms. Effort should also be placed in implementing the sedation protocol in the ICU, illustrated by the differences in numbers of doctors and nurses having a sedation protocol. We compare the efficacy, adverse events, and recovery duration of etomidate and propofol for use in procedural sedation in the emergency department (ED).

Methods After approval of the local ethics committee and written informed consent, 315 patients scheduled for elective 'on-pump' CABGS were enrolled in the study.

We hope others may consider it for their centres. The Capital Health Region provides advanced healthcare for 2 million people, but spread over 9,800 km. We therefore rely heavily on transportation of critically ill patients to a single urban centre. In addition to geographic and climatic factors, bed pressures complicate how we triage, stabilize, transport and receive those patients. A major strategy is the 'Critical-Care-Line': a 24-hour telephone service with teleconference capabilities and contact numbers. However, experience suggests it takes practice to become proficient with its use. Given the importance of optimal communication, we arrange simulated calls. Senior trainees are paged during a normal workday by the Critical-Care-Line: just as they will be once in independent practice. The facilitator then assumes the role of a referring doctor in a small town. Peer-reviewed cases are used that include pertinent teaching points. Applicable staff at the teaching centre are briefed of this exercise and asked to act as they normally would. For example, emergency physicians, internists, senior nurses and administrators are notified that they may be brought into the call, depending on whether the trainee decides to involve other services (for example, if he/she decides a patient requires further work-up before deciding upon ICU or if he/she decides to bring the patient to emergency if no ICU bed is currently available). All calls are recorded to aid debriefing. This method allows us to ascertain how trainees ask focused histories, offer practical advice based upon the variable skill set of referring physicians, and deal with complex ethical decisions (for example, if a family wishes to override a patient's previous wish; or how aggressively to treat the terminal patient for whom no prior discussions have occurred). It allows us to test the trainees' knowledge, but more importantly we can determine how well that knowledge is applied in everyday practice. In Canada, the Royal College of Physician and Surgeons has decreed that trainees become not just medical experts, but also proficient communicators, collaborators, and managers [1] . These goals, while laudable, have been very difficult to capture without novel approaches such as the one outlined. This simple and costfree addition to our training has been very well received. Initial success means it will now be expanded throughout acute care specialist training. Conclusion Although this study is small with only two observers who were investigated, it clearly shows that there is a significant intra-individual and inter-individual variability in the classification of monitoring events done by experienced clinicians. These findings are supported by studies into image analysis that also found high intra-individual and inter-individual variability. High inter-observer and intra-observer variability is a challenge for clinical studies into new alarm algorithms. Our findings also show a need for reliable classification methods.",

Methods Data recording is done through a laptop connected to the medical devices, allowing analogical and digital signal transmission through a high-speed network. Several servers are dedicated to specialised tasks: mass storage, model generation, artificial intelligence (AI), telecommunications, and security. A 3 Teraflops supercomputer is dedicated to intensive computation when necessary. Twenty applications are dedicated to elective tasks, most of them running using the Linux operating system. The 'Aiddiag' data-acquisition software is a standalone application adapted to patient data recording from the biomedical devices and caregiver's inputs. It has a friendly designed user-interface touchscreen at the bedside and was adapted according to caregivers' feedback. Data are also stored in a repository and a selective secondary extraction is possible. Online and offline analysis by the AI engine is allowed. Software had to consider time specifications and uses distributed computation to achieve high workload tasks. We complied to the French legal patient data management constraints. Results After 2 years, our system is fully deployed. It recorded more than 2,500 patient-hours over a 3-month period. Signal loss is less than 1%. Our tool allows recording of more than 40 digital signals, eight analogical signals sampled at a rate of 1 kHz, and caregiver comments and actions. CPU resources of the laptop are available for supplemental AI developments during data acquisition. Transfer of data to the repository is either a hotplugautomated process or delayed with 5 days of buffering in the laptop. Automated artefacts' cleaning allows time-series analysis (GARCH method) to extract behavioural models after intensive computation. The AI engine is used for medical guideline implementation (that is, severe brain trauma care algorithms) and later comparison with caregiver's behaviour. Remote use of our system is possible and schedulable, allowing other research teams to work on the data. Limitations have been detected during intensive calculation. Fine-tuning of the network will suppress these limitations. Conclusion ISIS is the first program to achieve an easy-to-use recording tool able to build a very large medical repository. Data analysis methods and AI-controlled automated complex medical guidelines are under evaluation.",

Over the last 5 years a number of initiatives have been adopted to reduce mobilisation times (the time from retrieval acceptance and activation to departure from the lead centre) and improve service delivery to surrounding district general hospitals (DGHs). The aim of this study was to evaluate whether these initiatives led to a reduction in mobilisation time between January 2002 and December 2006. Methods The STRS covers 24 DGHs within an 80 mile range serving a population of 1.6 million children in the South Thames region of Greater London. All calls to the service were logged on a detailed database. Retrieval requests for potential PICU patients were triaged and coordinated via a retrieval-specific telephone line. Once accepted, the onsite retrieval team was mobilised and dispatched via a dedicated ambulance to the DGH. Mobilisation includes assimilating and checking pre-packed equipment bags (ventilators, drugs, intubation kit, monitors, and so on) and organising a team of at least one retrieval nurse, doctor and ambulance driver. Details of each retrieval request to the STRS, including the time of the call, were captured on a database containing the patient demographic and clinical details. The interval between accepting the patient for retrieval and team departure from the unit was termed the 'mobilisation time' (minutes). Data were analysed over two time periods, before (n = 976 retrievals) and after 2004 (n = 1,785), coincident with a dedicated ambulance and driver on site. Nonparametric tests were used for continuous data (Kruskall-Wallis test or Mann-Whitney test) and the chi-squared test for categorical 2 x 2 comparisons. Results A total of 2,761 retrievals (median age 12 months, 78% ventilated) were performed and included for analysis during the study period, 33 were excluded (missing mobilisation times (n = 30) or elective transfers (n = 3). Figure 1 shows the process introduced to improve mobilisation times with a dedicated onsite ambulance service in 2004. There was a significant reduction in Available online http://ccforum.com/supplements/11/S2 There was also a significant increase in the incidence of sub-30-minute mobilisation times, which almost doubled after 2004 with the availability of an onsite dedicated ambulance service (14.3% to 25.9%, P < 0.0001). Conclusion There has been a significant decrease in the mobilisation time of the STRS over the last 5 years. Although the presence of an onsite ambulance service in 2004 had a significant impact on reducing retrieval mobilisation times, a number of other factors and initiatives contributed to steadily reducing mobilisation times over the study period.",

It is recognised that the respiratory rate is a particularly useful predictor of significant deterioration and should be measured with every set of observations. This audit aimed to assess the use of the track and trigger system on the medical wards and ensure that deteriorating critically ill patients are promptly reviewed. Methods Patient observation charts were reviewed for a specified 24-hour period. Data were gathered on the frequency and type of observations taken. For patients who met criteria to trigger a review, further data were abstracted about the nature of the deterioration and the promptness of the review. Results One hundred and sixty patient-days of observations were evaluated over seven medical wards. Twenty-nine patients met the trigger criteria and in 16 cases this represented a deterioration. Doctors were called in two cases. Observations were recorded with different frequency on different wards. One ward managed to record the respiratory rate with every set of observations. Conclusions Documented deteriorations in physiological observations did not trigger medical review. This may be a communication failure or failure to recognise recorded observations as abnormal. For this process to work well relevant observations must be recorded regularly and accurately. The respiratory rate was not consistently recorded between wards and the frequency of measurement of observations was variable. Further education and training is needed to improve recording of the respiratory rate and work needs to be done to establish why doctors were not called appropriately. Concerns about the volume of work generated by the system are unfounded. A positive predictive value of 55% is acceptable and 29 'triggers' in a 24-hour period are manageable. Median retrieval mobilisation times. Background Critical care outreach services (CCOS) have been introduced in the United Kingdom with aims to: avert or ensure timely admission to critical care; enable discharge from critical care; and share skills with ward staff. We aimed to assess the impact of the introduction of CCOS at the critical care unit level, as characterised by the case mix, outcome and activity of critical care unit admissions. Methods An interrupted time-series analysis was carried out using data from 108 units participating in the Case Mix Programme that had completed a survey on CCOS provision. Individual patientlevel data were collapsed into monthly time series for each unit (panel data). Population-averaged panel-data models were fitted using a generalised estimating equation approach. Various outcomes reflecting the stated aims of CCOS were considered for three groups of admissions: all admissions to the unit; admissions from the ward; and unit survivors discharged to the ward. The primary exposure variable was the presence of a formal CCOS with secondary exposures of CCOS activities, coverage and staffing, identified from the survey data.",

The lack of fully representative genetic animal models increases the importance of analyzing the impact of defensin gene polymorphisms on the courses of infectious and inflammatory diseases such as sepsis. This study was designed to investigate whether DEFB1 genomic variations are associated with incidence and outcome of severe sepsis. Six reported polymorphisms were detected in 211 patients with severe sepsis and 157 control individuals using diverse analytic methods. Linkage disequilibrium (LD), haplotype frequency, and statistical power for this association study were analyzed. The -44G-allele and -44G-allele carrying genotypes were significantly associated with incidence and outcome of severe sepsis. There was enough statistical power (1 -\u03b2 > 0.8 at type I level of 0.05) to demonstrate a significant contribution of the -44G allele to severe sepsis. The -20G allele and GG genotype were associated with susceptibility to severe sepsis, while the -1816Gallele and -1816G-allele carrying genotypes influenced the outcome of severe sepsis. SNPs -20A/G, -44C/G and -52A/G were in strong LD. Haplotype -20A/-44C/-52G showed a protective role against severe sepsis, whereas haplotype -20G/-44G/-52G served as a risk factor for fatal outcome of severe sepsis.

There were no differences in CIG with respect to mortality on admission or day 2 (P = 0.273 and 0.104, respectively). The mean hospital stay was significantly longer in patients with a CIG > 10 mmol/l (46.6 vs 18.7 days, P = 0.015, t test) ( Table 1) . Conclusion We describe the CIG for the first time in the critically ill surgical patient, and quantify it using simple bedside calculations derived from routine blood investigations. Failure to normalise the CIG by day 1 after admission to the HDU is an excellent marker for mortality and length of hospital stay, and should be used to guide resuscitation. ",

Results were expressed as median and interquartile range. Receiver operator curves were constructed to compare the predictive value of NO x values in BALF at admission with other variables. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to compare survival between high and low BALF NO x levels at admission. A P value less than 0.05 was considered significant. Results At study admission in the sepsis group, nonsurvivors had higher levels of BALF NO Introduction Myocyte stretch is the main stimulus of brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) synthesis and release. During septic shock, important variations of volemia can occur and a correlation has been described between the cardiac index and the BNP level [1] . However, the relation between the echocardiographic left ventricule area and the BNP level has never been described. The aim of our study was to evaluate BNP and left ventricule area variations after an acute fluid loading in septic shock. Methods Mechanical ventilated patients with septic shock, and without anterior cardiac disease, were included in our study. A fluid challenge was performed with colloid (500 ml) in 30 minutes. A BNP blood sample was drawn before and 1 hour after fluid loading. The primary endpoint was BNP variation after fluid challenge. Median values (25-75th percentiles) were compared with the Wilcoxon test (P < 0.05). The end-diastolic left ventricule area was recorded before and 1 hour after fluid challenge. Linear regression of BNP variation and left ventricular area variation was determined and r 2 was calculated. ",

Conclusions Risk of weaning failure is increased four times in patients with HD. BNP values of group B patients are higher than normal people probably because the heart of ICU patients is submitted to different kinds of stress; therefore the BNP cutoff value to consider for discrimination of patients with HD from patients without HD in the ICU should be higher. BNP production in ICU patients with good performance of the heart is the right protective response to stress performed by therapy adopted during the ICU stay, this response is absent in patients with HD because their hearts already work in safety mode.",

All these patients were treated with artesunate and/or quinine as per the WHO antimalarial treatment schedule, along with standard ICU care. The APACHE II and SOFA scores were calculated on admission. PCT levels were measured semiquantitatively on admission. The parasite index was confirmed by two pathologists. Results Nine out of 11 patients survived without any residual organ damage, and the remaining two died due to MODS (Figure 1 ). Both these patients had five organ dysfunctions on admission, and their SOFA scores were 18 and 20, respectively.

The mortality of patients that were readmitted more than once (from a total 160 patients, 41 died -25.6%) was bigger than the mortality of patients readmitted just once (from a total 696 patients, 131 died -18.96%) (P = 0.12). The length of stay of nonsurviving readmitted patients in other departments before readmission was higher than the length of stay of survivors (mean 7.64 days vs mean 5.71 days). Conclusion Sex and age older than 70 years of patients readmitted to the ICU, readmission during 24 hours, and length of stay in other departments before readmission could be used for simple prediction of mortality of patients readmitted into the ICU. The amount of single patient readmissions to the ICU cannot be used as a predictor of death of patients readmitted to the ICU. Introduction The aim of this study was to assess the role of absolute risk reduction (ARR) to measure ICU performance as an alternative to the standardized mortality ratio (SMR). Methods This retrospective study involves patients admitted to three ICUs of a single tertiary medical center from January 2003 through December 2005. Only the first ICU admission of each patient was included in the study. The ICUs were staffed similarly. We abstracted data from the APACHE III database. For each ICU, the SMR and ARR with their 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated. ICU performance was categorized as shown in Table 1 . When comparing ICUs, if the 95% CI of the SMR or the ARR overlap between the units, the performances were considered similar. If there was no overlap, the differences in performance were considered statistically significant. Results During the study period, 12,447 patients were admitted to the three ICUs: 4,334 to the medical ICU, 3,275 to the mixed ICU and 4,838 to the surgical ICU. The predicted mortality rates were 19.5%, 16.0% and 9.0% and the observed mortality rates 14.8%, 9.7% and 4.3% for the medical, mixed and surgical ICUs, respectively. The SMR and ARR in mortality for each ICU are presented in Table 2 .",

The study population consisted of all patients who were discharged alive from our 28-bed surgical, thoracic-surgical and medical ICU in a university teaching hospital in a 1-year period. A case was defined as a patient readmitted to the ICU within 48 hours after discharge. For each case, three control patients were randomly selected from the study population. The following information was collected: demographic parameters and APACHE II score, parameters of hemodynamic, respiratory and renal function, length of ICU stay, duration of invasive ventilatory support (ventilator time), and time between extubation and discharge. To determine a predictive model, covariate selection was done by the two-sample t test, Mann-Whitney test and univariate logistic regression.

The aim of this study was to estimate the real costs of IC in two hospitals in The Netherlands using a micro-costing methodology. Methods The costing study was undertaken at two hospitals in The Netherlands. We conducted a retrospective cost analysis of 200 consecutive patients admitted to a 32-bed mixed adult ICU at an academic hospital during two periods in 2006: 16 April-15 May and 5 June-23 June. For comparison, we collected detailed data at a general hospital that has a 10 bed-adult general ICU for the period 1 January-1 July 2003. The costs were adjusted to 2005 using the general price index. Both times, we applied a micro-costing approach, implying that all relevant resources were identified and valued at a detailed level. Data on resource use of diagnostics, drugs, fluids, materials, admission and discharge were acquired from the computerized Patient Data Management System in both hospitals. Hotel and nutrition costs were collected from the respective financial departments. These costs were divided by the annual number of patient-days to calculate the cost per day. The NEMS or TISS scores in the academic or general hospital, respectively, were used to estimate nursing time per patient per day. The costs of medical specialists were based on the labour costs and the number of ICU days per year. In the academic hospital, time for consultations of medical staff attributable to each individual patient-day was prospectively collected using patient record forms. These costs we assumed to be comparable in the general hospital in the absence of detailed data. Unit costs of diagnostics and consumables were derived from the financial hospital databases. Labour costs were based on standardised costs per minute, which equalled the normative income divided by the number of workable minutes per year.",

Of 352 patients originally not sent to the ICU, 43 (12.2%) were subsequently admitted to the ICU. These patients had higher APACHE III scores and were more likely to have 'aspiration' documented, although their mortality was not higher than direct ICU admissions.

Methods Eight healthy volunteers and 10 patients with severe sepsis were included. One 18-gauge open-flow microperfusion double-lumen catheter was inserted into SAT of the abdominal wall and perfused with an isotonic solution at a flow rate of 1 \u00b5l/min. Blood samples and probe effluent samples from interstitial fluid of SAT were withdrawn in two hourly intervals for a period of 8 hours and retrospectively analysed using a Multiplex ELISA system for IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-8 and TNF\u03b1. Results Concentrations of IL-1\u03b2, IL-6 and IL-8 were substantially higher in SAT (13.pg/ml) for both groups, whereas TNF\u03b1 concentrations were similar in serum and SAT(Figure 1). Serum concentrations of all cytokines remained stable over time. However, a significant increase was observed for IL-1\u03b2 and IL-8 in SAT in both groups. This increase was significantly in septic patients vs healthy controls. Conclusion Insertion of a catheter into subcutaneous adipose tissue promotes a local inflammatory response in both healthy individuals and critically ill patients. The attenuated response in patients with severe sepsis might be caused by reduced inflammatory reactivity in this group.P22The evaluation of sivelestat sodium hydrate in acute lung injury/acute respiratory distress syndrome patients in the intensive care unitT Ikeda, K Ikeda, T Ueno, Y Kuroki, T Yokoyama, K Yoshikawa Hachiouji Medical Center, Tokyo Medical University, Tokyo, Japan Critical Care 2007, 11(Suppl 2):P22 (doi: 10.1186/cc5182)",

At this time, ICNARC commenced an audit to monitor the diffusion of the drug into routine UK practice and to undertake a nonrandomised evaluation of its effectiveness. Methods A data collection form was developed and tested to mirror the information collected in PROWESS. This form was completed for every admission that received DrotAA and a senior clinician confirmed completeness. Data were entered centrally and validated. Analysis Admissions receiving DrotAA and with severe sepsis and two or more organ dysfunctions in the first 24 hours following admission to the unit were matched to controls on: source of admission; organ dysfunctions; ICNARC physiology score; and age. Four pools of control patients were used for matching: (a) historic admissions (January 2000-August 2002) from the same unit; (b) contemporaneous admissions from the same unit; (c) contemporaneous admissions from units that never used DrotAA; and (d) contemporaneous admissions from units prior to their first use of DrotAA. Analyses were undertaken using conditional, fixedeffects, Poisson regression. Results One hundred and twelve units participated in the audit; 1,079 admissions (one in 16) with severe sepsis and two or more organ dysfunctions in the first 24 hours following admission to the unit received DrotAA. For the four control pools, matching was successful for: (a) 657 (61%); (b) 820 (76%); (c) 702 (65%); and (d) 965 (89%). Matched cases were older, more acutely ill and had higher hospital mortality than unmatched cases. The relative risks (95% confidence interval) associated with DrotAA were: (a) 0.84 (0.77-0.92); (b) 0.85 (0.78-0.93); (c) 0.75 (0.68-0.83); and (d) 0.80 (0.73-0.86). A priori subgroup analyses indicated greater effect for patients with three or more organ dysfunctions.Interpretation All results were consistent with PROWESS, but need to be interpreted with caution due to their nonrandomised nature and the potential existence of important unknown confounders. In addition, the fact that only one in 16 potentially suitable admissions received DrotAA suggests a strong possibility for treatment bias.",

From 2003 the number of treated patients increased significantly. This is due to better recognition. The introduced program consists of education of working staff in all hospitals in the region. Barlicki Hospital is a reference hospital for treatment of sepsis, and patients with diagnosis of sepsis are transferred to this ICU. University ICU doctors are teaching workshops how to recognize and treat sepsis. Methods The surviving ratio in patients treated with APC was estimated retrospectively. Analysis included the years from 2003 to 10 December 2006. Results A total number of 61 patients, aged 18-65 years, were included in the analysis. The pathogens and infection location were different. Patients were diagnosed according to recommendations of the Polish Sepsis Group and treatment with APC was introduced. The increase in number was: in 2004 vs 2003, 200%; in 2005 vs 2004, 111%; in 2006 up to 10 December vs 2005, 57.8%. The surviving ratio increased every year but in 2006 it decreased compared with 2005.",

Results From 1996 to 2005 the percentage of contamination from S. epidermidis has been 24.7% (22% in respiratory tracts, 8% in the urinary system, 41% in central venous catheter, 19% in the blood, 10% in other places). From 2000 to 2005 there has been a sensible reduction of 3%. Conclusion The introduction in the last 5 years of strict protocols in order to control asepsis in our ICU, combined with the use of Clorexidina and alcoholic gel, have drastically reduced the contamination from S. epidermidis.

Method A total of 1,187 patients suffering from high-risk acute coronary syndrome (hrACS) were treated in our center in 2005. States Killip 3 and 4 have developed perioperatively in 186 of these patients. International studies have proven high mortality in these patient groups -especially in state Killip 4. Our aim was to analyze the inhospital mortality of the state Killip 3 and 4 patient group treated in our center in 2005. Results Seven hundred and two patients with STEMI and 485 patients with hrACS were admitted to our center in 2005. The mortality of these patients was 4.84% (STEMI) and 3.71% (hrACS), and the main cause of this mortality (37.7%) was the Killip 3/4 state, which was observed in 11.9% of the STEMI patients and in 17.9% of hrACS patients (n = 84 and 87). The mean age of the Killip 3/4 patients was 70 \u00b1 10 years. Angiologically successful PCI was performed in 97.9% of the cases. The ratio of revascularized coronaries was left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD): 66 (35.9%), right coronary artery (RCA): 33 (17.9%), circumflex coronary artery (CX): 28 (15.2%), PCI in left main coronary artery: 28 (12.5%), LAD + CX: 15 (8.15%), RCA + LAD: 7 (3.8%), CX + RCA: 6 (3.26%), venous bypass graft: 2 (1.1%). No PCI was performed in two cases. Adjuvant therapies of intraaortic balloon counterpulsation in 67 (36%), mechanical ventilation in 62 (33.3%), continuous veno-venous hemofiltration in 12 (6.45%), and levosimendan therapy in 86 (46.2%) patients were used. Ten (5.4%) of the patients had advanced adult life support (cardiopulmonary resuscitation) (AALS) before arrival at our center, and AALS was performed in the perioperative period in 16 (8.6%) patients. The early inhospital mortality of hrACS aggravated by state Killip 3/4 was 10.7% (20 patients)according to subgroup: Killip 3: 0.06%; Killip 4: 30.5%. The prognosis of state Killip 3/4 and successive multiorgan failure as the high-mortality complication of hrACS can be improved by early successful PCI, and the concomitant pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic supportive therapy.

Methods Retrospectively (January 1998-August 2004), we studied 558 consecutive patients with STEMI treated by PCA. The symptom to balloon time (SBT) was defined as the elapsed time between symptom onset and the first balloon inflation, and the procedural success (PS) as the TIMI III flow post-PCA with estenosis <50%. ResultsTable 1summarises clinical features according to SBT. After adjustment of potentially confounding variables, SBT was the variable associated with less ST-segment resolution (HR 1.772, 95% CI 1.46-4.15, P = 0.02).",

The plasma Ddimer level was measured immediately after admission to the ICU. Results In 38 patients (84%) cardial reasons for cardiac arrest were found. Marked activation of blood coagulation was found in all patients. After prolonged cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ROSC not within the first 30 min) patients showed significant elevated serum D-dimer level compared with patients after ROSC in the first 30 minutes (663 \u00b5g/l vs 3,328 \u00b5g/ml, P < 0.0001; normal range <0.25 \u00b5g/ml). The time period between cardiac arrest and ROSC and plasma D-dimer level correlated significantly (r = 0.8, P < 0.01) after CPR. Patients who died showed significant elevated serum D-dimer level compared with the surviving patients (1,258 \u00b1 1,587 \u00b5g/l vs 3,164 \u00b1 1,974 \u00b5g/l, P = 0.026 median). The plasma Ddimer level correlated significantly to the negative outcome in these patients (r = 0.55, P < 0.01). Conclusions Our data demonstrate a marked time-dependent activation of blood coagulation and fibrin formation after prolonged cardiac arrest and CPR in humans. These changes of the coagulation system may contribute to reperfusion disorders and possibly affect the outcome of these patients. Further studies need to show whether elevation of the D-dimer level in patients after CPR could be a prognostic marker.P323Vasopressin alone or with epinephrine may be superior to epinephrine in asystolic out-of-hospital cardiac arrest: an observational study M \u00d0 \u00d0pindler, \u00d0 \u00d0 Grmec, \u00d0 \u00d0 Mally Center for Emergency Medicine Maribor, Slovenia Critical Care 2007, 11(Suppl 2):P323 (doi: 10.1186/cc5483)Background In patients undergoing cardiopulmonary resuscitation, circulating endogenous vasopressin concentrations were significantly higher in successfully resuscitated patients than in patients who died. Clinical data considering vasopressin to be an equivalent option to epinephrine in cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) are limited. The studies of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) confirm an increasing part of asystole as the initial rhythm. The hypothesis of this study was that vasopressin improves the rate of return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) and the survival rate in asystolic OHCA, when used early in the resuscitation effort. Methods This was a prospective cohort study, with a historic group compared trial set in an urban emergency medical services system, serving a population of 200,000. All nonpregnant, normothermic adults (>18 years) suffering nontraumatic OHCA with asystole were eligible. We compared two treatment groups of resuscitated patients with OHCA. In the epinephrine group (EPI) patients received epinephrine 1 mg i.v. every 3 minutes only. In the vasopressin group (VASO) patients received arginine vasopressin 40 IU i.v. only or followed by epinephrine 1 mg every 3 minutes during CPR. Statistics. Exact Fisher test, Wilcoxon rank-sum test, and analysis of independent predictors with multivariate logistic regression were used; P < 0.05. Results The investigators enrolled 227 consecutive patients: in the EPI group 183 patients(years 2001-2003)  and in the VASO group 44 patients (year 2004). Baseline (demographic and clinical) characteristics were similar for the two groups. Comparing the EPI and VASO groups, any ROSC was achieved in 81/183 (44%) and 34/44 (77%), P = 0.04; ROSC with admission in 61/183 (33%) and 27/44 (61%), P = 0.03; 24-hour survival in 44/183 (24%) and 23/44 (52%), P = 0.01; and discharge from hospital in 17/183 (9%) and 10/44 (23%), P = 0.04. Vasopressin was an independent predictor of ROSC with admission with an odds ratio of 2.4 (95% CI = 1.24-4.98).",

Combination of digital wide-range neurosonography and transcranial energetic Doppler scan provides a possibility of effective monitoring of cerebral blood flow. The goal of this study was to analyze cerebral flow disturbances in pregnant patients with preeclampsia. Methods Eighty-eight patients with severe preeclampsia, age 17-32 years (mean age 26 \u00b1 4.6 years), and 90 patients with normal pregnancy, third trimester, without significant co-morbid states, age 19-34 years (mean age 25.9 \u00b1 4.2 years), were included in the study. Patients with the following features were excluded from both groups: potentially haemodynamically significant stenosis or occlusion of magistral arteries of the head and basilar region; clinical features of congestive heart failure; arrhythmia. All patients underwent duplex scan of extracranial portions of brachiocephalic arteries with a linear probe and transcranial duplex scan (TCDS) in the area of the middle cerebral artery (MCA). By the transtemporal approach in the MCA M1 segment we determined the peak systolic flow velocity (V ps ), maximal enddiastolic velocity (V ed ), time-adjusted maximal velocity (TAMX), resistance index (RI), pulsative index (PI), and systolic/diastolic ratio (S/D). Significance of mean values differences in groups was estimated using Student t criteria. Results All haemodynamic values in preeclamptic patients were decreased in comparison with the same values in healthy pregnant women: PI (mean 0.71 vs 0.84, P < 0.0001); RI (mean 0.49 vs 0.54, P < 0.0001); V ps (mean 72.8 vs 104.8 cm/s, P < 0.0001); V ed (mean 34.7 vs 48.7 cm/s, P < 0.0001); TAMX (mean 48.5 vs 67.5 cm/s, P < 0.0001); S/D (mean 1.94 vs 2.05, P < 0.001). These pathophysiological changes of cerebral haemodynamics were consistent with the Dopplerographic pattern of diminished perfusion and are typical for vascular segments, which are located proximally to the zone of abnormally high haemodynamic resistance. Conclusion The results of the performed study showed that patients with severe preeclampsia had decreased cerebral perfusion and TCDS is an effective method for estimation of preeclampsia severity.P383 HELLP syndrome: utility of specific classifications as prognostic tools R Souissi, Z Haddad, W Trabelsi, N Baffoun, M Boubaker, C Kaddour, L Skandrani National Institute of Neurology, Tunis, Tunisia Critical Care 2007, 11(Suppl 2):P383 (doi: 10.1186/cc5543) Introduction HELLP syndrome is a specific complication of pregnancy characterized by hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes and abstract P381)",

Only patients with community-acquired sepsis, who fulfilled the criteria of septic shock and were admitted directly from the ED to the ICU, were included. Conclusions The adoption of EGDT protocol was poor in Finnish hospitals. The impaired early recognition of sepsis may lead to a delay in ICU admission. The rate of reached EGDT targets reflected mortality. In this study the most critical EGDT target was the measurement of lactate during first 6 hours after arrival in the ED. A forthcoming follow-up study will evaluate the impact of guidelines to treatment and outcome of septic shock in Finland. The aim of this study was to determine the level of awareness of the SSC guidelines in surgical and EM trainees. Methods A questionnaire-based survey was undertaken of all EM and surgical trainees in the Eastern region of the United Kingdom. Participants were recruited by post, telephone, email and in person. The questionnaire assessed whether participants had experience in critical care, were aware of the campaign or its guidelines and assessed the level of familiarity of key concepts of the resuscitation bundle of the guidelines. In addition, participants were encouraged to comment on any aspect of sepsis management. Results Summarised inTable 1. There are 29 EM and 52 surgical trainees in the Eastern region; responses were obtained from 22 and 34, respectively. The responses to the key concepts of the resuscitation bundle varied greatly, even between different participants from the same speciality in the same institution, suggesting a lack of clear direction. Free text responses included 'the only people that know about guidelines for sepsis are the ICU physicians' and 'the only time I have heard of early goal directed therapy was on ER'. Conclusion Awareness is reasonable amongst EM trainees but poor amongst surgeons. If the aims of the SSC are to be met, consideration must be given to differences in healthcare systems in different countries. In the United Kingdom, educational activities should be directed towards EM and surgical trainees as well as those working in intensive care.ConclusionThe majority of units have an infection control policy, utilize glucose control regimens and have access to a microbiologist. Sedation, analgesia and neuromuscular blockade are infrequently utilized. Despite the availability of guidelines, it is common for many recommendations not to be implemented. Further work is required to determine the reasons for noncompliance with attention to educational programs and other strategies to improve practice.

Conclusion In ICU patients, the development of BSI due to A. baumannii is associated with a higher severity of illness on admission compared with those due to P. aeruginosa and K. pneumoniae.

The bacteremia was classified as true bacteremia or contamination, based on the presence of clinical signs and symptoms and also on the criteria of MacGregor. For the true bacteremia group, we further investigated the changes that occurred with the previously administered antibiotic therapy according to the results of blood culture. Conclusion The blood cultures, as were usually ordered for febrile immunocompetent patients in the Emergency Department, rarely altered patient management and the results had limited usefulness. The emergency physician who initially treats these patients has to consider this limitation of blood culture. Also, eliminating blood cultures for immunocompetent patients may hold down unnecessary medical expenses. specific data were collected. The patient was followed until subsequent death or discharge. The primary outcome variable was survival to hospital discharge and the secondary outcome was length of hospitalization. An independent t-test analysis was carried out for the primary independent variable (timing of administration of antibiotics) and primary outcome (mortality) for significant differences between the groups. A twosided P value <0.05 was considered as statistical significance. Logistic regression modeling was used to examine survival as a function of timing of antibiotic administration. in periods A and B. In multivariate analysis, tobacco, cardiac arrest and ischaemic stroke were independent risk factors of pneumonia. Conclusion In our study, contrary to previous ones[1,2], antibioprophylaxy did not show a decrease in the incidence of nosocomial pneumonia in medical comatose patients with Glasgow Coma Score < 8 under mechanical ventilation.

SeeTable 2for concordance of SQTA-BAL when only multiresistant microorganisms are considered. Negative BAL cultures with SQTA growth were never found. Polymicrobial SQTA cultures: 13 concordant, seven only partial concordant, four not concordant. There was no incidence in our results related to previous antibiotic therapy: 33% of the concordant, 24% of the partial concordant and 29% of the no concordant were on antibiotics when SQTA was obtained.IntroductionThe medical literature shows that the most important prognosis factor in nosocomial pneumonia is the correct empirical antimicrobial therapy. Recently the microorganisms have been becoming more resistant to the usual antibiotics and there are many reports of Gram-negative bacilli (GNB) only susceptible to Polimixyn b (PB). The ATS guideline does not suggest the use of PB as an empirical therapy, while the Brazilian Sepsis Guideline (BG) allows the use of this antibiotic in special circumstances. The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy of both guidelines, based on the microbiological data. Methods This is a retrospective study with 93 cases of nosocomial pneumonia diagnosed according to the ATS criteria, managed in our ICU from 1 February 2005 to 16 September 2006. We analyzed the efficacy of both guidelines, using them during all the study period or stratifying the patients into two groups according to the research median period (24 November 2005). Conclusions Our data show that the more restrictive ATS guideline can significantly lead to a wrong empirical therapy in MR GNB high-prevalence situations. The use of the BG can lead to a better empirical treatment in this situation. This information enhances the need for ICU flora knowledge, which are seasonal, so there is no 'all time and place perfect guideline', although the BG was a better option in our ICU than the ATS guideline.",

Changes in the cycling-off flow criteria of PSV can modify the expiratory synchrony between the mechanical and neural inspiration termination. The influences of the slope changes on the respiratory parameters in ICU patients are still under investigation.Objectives To compare the effects of two different flow cycling-off criteria and the effects of two different pressure slopes (150 ms or 300 ms) of PSV on the respiratory parameters of ICU mechanically ventilated patients. Methods We prospectively evaluated 20 intubated and mechanically ventilated adult ICU patients recovering from acute respiratory failure who could be comfortably ventilated on pressure support mode (PSV) with pressure support of 15 cmH 2 O, PEEP of 5 cmH 2 O and FIO 2 of 40%. Patients were ventilated on PSV, with 25% and 40% of peak expiratory flow cycling criteria, and were submitted to 150 ms and 300 ms pressure slope delay. We evaluated the respiratory rate, expiratory tidal volume, minute ventilation, VCO 2 , VTCO 2 , ETCO 2 , mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate and SpO 2 .ResultsComparisons between different slope and cycling-off values did not result in any statistically significant changes for the evaluated variables(Table 1).

They were randomized to the control group or to the threshold group and followed daily until extubation, tracheostomy or death. The threshold group was trained twice daily.

Methods One hundred and forty-four patients (79 EG and 65 AG) were studied. The primary outcome was weaning success (48 hours of spontaneous ventilation after extubation). The secondary outcome was differences in the conventional weaning predictors. Parameters studied included: respiratory rate (f), tidal volume (VT), frequency-tidal volume ratio (f/VT), gasometric and ventilatory parameters. The weaning method was a spontaneous breathing trial. Measurements were performed twice: just before the spontaneous breathing trial (T1) and 30 minutes after (T2). The S71 chi-square test, analysis of variance and t test were used in the analysis.

The behavior is not yet known of HR variability during weaning from MV comparing pressure support ventilation (PSV) and the T-tube (TT) in patients with and without heart disease. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact on heart rate variability (HRV) in these groups of patients during PSV and TT. Methods Patients with (group 1, n = 8) and without (group 2, n = 22) heart disease, under MV for at least 48 hours, were observed during 30 minutes of PSV or TT, in a random order. Variables analyzed were: APACHE score, length of stay in the ICU (LOS), and cardiorespiratory variables including the HR, respiratory rate (RR), rapid shallow breathing index (f/VT), maximum inspiratory (PImax) and expiratory (PEmax) pressure. Continuous ECG was recorded by the Holter method. The data of HRV were accomplished by analysis of the frequency domain. For statistical analyses, analysis of variance and t test were used. The level of significance was P < 0.05. Results Values for the APACHE score, LOS, PImax and PEmax did not show significant differences comparing groups.

We retrospectively compared the treatment effects of mini-BAL only and mini-BAL combined with surfactant in the treatment of pediatric ICU patients with recurrent atelectasis. Methods A retrospective analysis included a heterogeneous group of 18 mechanically ventilated pediatric ICU patients with recurrent atelectasis. Nine patients (mean age, 4.4 \u00b1 3.4 years) who received surfactant after standard mini-BAL were compared with nine patients (mean age, 4.7 \u00b1 3.0 years) who underwent only standard mini-BAL. Gas exchange and pulmonary mechanic parameters in the two groups were compared. The peak inspiratory pressure (PIP), positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), paO 2 /FiO 2 , and partial arterial carbon dioxide pressure (paCO 2 ) were analyzed with 3 x 2 multivariate analysis of variance, with the time of measurement (before treatment, 6 and 12 hours after treatment) as a withinsubject factor and the type of treatment (mini-BAL only vs mini-BAL with surfactant) as a between-subject factor. Results The groups did not differ in age (independent sample t test = 0.698). The parameters significantly changed with time after treatment (Wilks' \u03bb = 0.027, F = 25.277, P < 0.001), and the treatment procedures had significantly different effects (time x treatment, Wilks' \u03bb = 0.103, F = 6.070, P = 0.013). A significant univariate time-treatment interaction was not present only for SpO 2 (F(2,32) = 2.167, P = 0.629). Subsequent analyses showed different effect of surfactant administration on PEEP compared with mini-BAL alone. In the mini-BAL only group, PEEP changed from 6.44 \u00b1 1.13 cmH 2 O before treatment to 5.22 \u00b1 0.83 cmH 2 O 6 hours after the treatment (P = 0.019), and remained the same 12 hours after the treatment.

The last mean measurements before initiation of HFOV were: pH 7.24, PaO 2 116, PCO 2 67.4, FiO 2 0.899. No significant hemodynamic instability was associated with initiation and administration of HFOV. The mean frequency was 4.3 (mode 4), mean power was 8.5, mean FiO 2 was 0.83. The successful weaning rate from HFOV to extubation or trach mask was 70%, and mean total time of mechanical ventilation (conventional + HFOV) was 347.76 hours and the time spent on HFOV was 107.5 hours. Conclusion HFOV is a possible alternative for safely correcting oxygenation failure associated with ARDS in trauma patients. Further research is necessary to identify the best strategy and patients for HFOV.Introduction High-frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV) is a promising ventilatory modality for ARDS patients having refractory hypoxemia despite standard ARDS ventilation. Hemodynamic alterations while switching the patient from volume-controlled ventilation (VCV) to HFOV are not yet well studied. Objective To evaluate immediate (within 3 hours) hemodynamic effects of HFOV in ARDS patients with septic shock needing vasopressor support.Methods Patients having a PO 2 /FiO 2 ratio \u2264150, PEEP >12 cm and FiO 2 requirement \u22650.7 on VCV (6 ml/kg) were switched to HFOV. The initial continuous distending pressure (CDP) of HFOV was 5 cm above the mean airway pressure during VCV. Other HFOV settings were FiO 2 1, bias flow 30 l/min, amplitude 70 cm and frequency 7 Hz. The CDP was adjusted to maintain oxygen saturation >88%. Fluid bolus before switching to HFOV was avoided. All the patients were sedated and paralysed during the study period. A drop in the mean arterial pressure (MAP) \u226465 mm or cardiac index (CI) \u22642.5 l/min/m 2 were treated with escalation of inotrope if required. Hemodynamic monitoring was done with the Flotrac-Vigileo monitoring system. Results Eight ARDS patients needing vasopressor support were switched to HFOV from VCV. Baseline data of these patients were: age 58.87 \u00b1 11.69 years, APACHE II score 21.02 \u00b1 8.14, mean CDP of HFOV 26.67 \u00b1 3.22 cm, frequency 7 Hz, amplitude 70 cm.Figure 1presents the trends of hemodynamic parameters during the study period. Only one patient needed escalation of the dopamine dose during the trial period.Conclusion Switching of an ARDS patient from VCV to HFOV does not impart significant hemodynamic instabilities and can be safely done. Outcome predictors of high-frequency oscillatory ventilation in acute respiratory distress syndrome S Jog, P Akole, P Rajhans, B Pawar Deenanath Mangeshkar Hospital and Research Centre, Pune, India Critical Care 2007, 11(Suppl 2):P199 (doi: 10.1186/cc5359) Introduction Outcome predictors of high-frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV) in severe ARDS are not well studied. Objective To evaluate outcome predictors of HFOV in adult patients with ARDS.Methods ARDS patients receiving mechanical ventilation as per the ARDSnet protocol with PO 2 /FiO 2 <150, PEEP \u226512 cm and FiO 2 \u22650.7 were considered for HFOV. The continuous distending pressure (CDP), frequency, amplitude, inspiratory time and bias flow of HFOV were optimised, guided by frequent blood gas analysis. Weaning from HFOV to pressure support ventilation was attempted once the PO 2 /FiO 2 ratio remained \u2265200 with CDP \u226418 cm FiO 2 \u22640.5. Responders (R) were defined as patients who were successfully weaned to a state without any ventilatory support for >12 hours. Nonresponders (NR) could not be weaned off any ventilatory assistance.",

Methods SRM were performed by progressive increases of continuing distending pressure (CDP) starting from the mean airway pressure on CMV + 5 cmH 2 O, by increments of 3 cmH 2 O every 10 minutes until a CDP of 50 cmH 2 O was reached or haemodynamic instability ensued. Subsequently, CDP was reduced by 2 cmH 2 O every 5 minutes until optimal CDP was established on gas exchange. EIT measurements were performed using 16 electrodes, acquired via the Goe-MF II EIT system (Viasys Healthcare, USA). Offline analysis of EIT measurements was performed using the AUSPEX software (University of Amsterdam). Changes in impedance (\u2206Z) during tidal breathing were calibrated against set tidal volumes during conventional mechanical ventilation. Changes in lung volume after each increase in CDP on HFOV were expressed as the fold change compared with the previous CDP level. Results Four patients with ARDS, who underwent rescue HFOV, were enrolled. Following the SRM, there was a mean 2.38-fold increase in PaO 2 /FiO 2 and a 19.7% reduction in PaCO 2 . EIT showed a mean 4.66-fold increase in global lung volume, with preferential ventilation of the ventral regions (59.4% of global volume change). Despite these differences, both dorsal and ventral regions showed a similar degree of volume change compared with their own baseline (V/D of 4.7/4.5-fold). This may be consistent with a more homogeneous recruitment with HFOV. The inflation limb of the changes in lung volumes during SRM fitted the Venegas-Harris equation (r 2 = 0.99).Conclusion EIT can noninvasively assess lung recruitability and quantify the changes in global and regional lung volume during SRM with HFOV in ARDS patients.Introduction High-frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV) is used for patients with refractory hypoxia and or severe oxygenation failure in our ICU. There is a unit policy regarding the timing of initiation of HFOV, and all patients were initiated with a single static recruitment manoeuvre and then managed according to local guidelines. The aim of this study was to understand which ventilatory parameters best predicted successful outcome following HFOV. Methods After institutional approval, we retrospectively reviewed the case notes all the adult patients who were ventilated with HFOV during the 18-month period between January 2005 and July 2006. The data were analysed using SPSS \u00ae version 13 software. Results There were 33 episodes of HFOV in 31 patients; 19 females and 12 males; mean age of 56 years. First-day median APACHE II scores and predicted mortality were 23 and 41%, respectively. All the patients had acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) at the time of initiation of HFOV. The main causes of ARDS were pneumonia leading to sepsis (50%), sepsis from other sources (18%), postoperative emergency laparotomy and abdominal aortic aneurysm repair (18%). Patients were ventilated with conventional ventilation for a median period of 35 hours (0-519 hours) before being ventilated with HFOV for a median period of 58 hours (7-1,080 hours). Fourteen patients (45%) were successfully weaned to conventional ventilation while two (7%) died because of cardiac arrest and in the remaining 15 patients (48%) treatment was withdrawn.

It has become clear that these patients require sufficient levels of PEEP to prevent alveolar derecruitment, but also not too much PEEP that alveolar overdistension occur. To achieve the optimal level of PEEP in patients with ALI/ARDS, different concepts have been introduced. GE Healthcare, along with Dr Ola Stenqvist, has developed a technology to measure functional residual capacity (FRC) in ventilated patients without interruption of the ventilation. The aim of this study was to test the feasibility of this device and to test whether decreasing the PEEP affects FRC in mechanically ventilated patients with and without lung disease. Methods For this survey we examined 10 patients under mechanical ventilation. The FRC examinations were performed with the Engstr\u00f6m Carestation equipped with the FRC Inview\u2122 monitoring feature.

In total, 10 surgical procedures were cancelled based on poor CPX performance. Two patients with low AT underwent surgery after preoptimisation with no complications. There are no deaths related to cardiopulmonary complications in any patient deemed fit for major cancer surgery and intensive care management, as determined by CPX testing. Discussion CPX testing is an important screening test for major surgery to determine the cardiorespiratory risk factors. It is useful in reducing surgical perioperative mortality and avoids unnecessary intensive care admissions after major body cavity surgeries. The CPX test is also useful in perioperative anaesthetic management. It may not predict morbidity and the average intensive care stay. It is very useful in selecting patients for preoptimisation before major cancer surgery. Conclusion Preoperative screening using CPX testing is useful in identification of high-risk cancer surgical patients and the appropriate selection of perioperative management.Introduction Intestinal complications after cardiopulmonary bypass procedures are infrequent but they carry a significant incidence of morbidity and mortality. Predictors of these complications are not well developed, and the role of fundamental variables remains controversial. The purpose of this study was to ascertain the frequency of intestinal complications following open heart surgery, to assess preoperative predisposing factors and to elucidate that prompt diagnosis and institution of therapy are the most common factors to improve the outcome. Methods A prospective survey was conducted among 4,588 patients undergoing cardiac surgery and attending the surgical ICU from 1 January 2002 to 31 December 2004. All case histories of patients were objected to meticulous analysis searching for complications involving gastrointestinal tract and requiring surgical consultation.

There were significant differences between median Gc globulin in ALF patients compared with ACLD: 25 mg/l (10-50) vs 50 mg/l (25-129), P = 0.036. No significant differences were seen for NGAL. Gc globulin correlated with admission creatinine (r = 0.44, P < 0.01), INR (r = 0.68, P < 0.01), and SOFA score (r = 0.419, P < 0.01) in both patient groups. These relationships persisted when admission Gc globulin was examined in regard to day 5 parameters. Admission Gc globulin correlated with D3 urine output (r = 0.619, P < 0.001). NGAL correlated with urine output throughout the first 5 days of admission (r = -0.593 on day 1, r = -0.674 on day 3, P < 0.001) and also with SOFA score. High admission NGAL was associated with requirement for renal replacement therapy on day 3 (ROC AUC 0.91 (0.895-1.022, P < 0.001)), outperforming both admission Gc globulin and admission creatinine. A low admission Gc globulin more accurately predicted the need for haemofiltration on day 5 (AUC 0.889, 0.734-1.044, P < 0.007) than either NGAL or creatinine on admission. There were significant differences observed for Gc globulin examining 30-day survival (transplantation from ITU being analysed as 'death'): 50 mg/l (29-94) vs 18 (4-40), respectively, AUC S159 0.813, P = 0.006. There were no significant differences in NGAL values between survivors and nonsurvivors for the whole group. NGAL was significantly lower in survivors than nonsurvivors in the ACLD group (AUC 0.875, P = 0.47). Conclusion Gc globulin and NGAL are potentially useful methods of identifying patients with a particularly poor prognosis and those needing renal replacement therapy. Further larger prospective studies are needed to elucidate their exact role not only in liver disease but also in the general ITU population.Introduction Fibrinogen as a prognostic test of mortality in acute hepatic failure has not been reported. Two hundred and sixty patients admitted to the liver intensive therapy unit (LITU) with hepatic failure (that is, subacute, acute and fulminant) between1 January 2004 and 30 September 2006 were identified from the LITU database (I-Care, UK). Twelve patients without fibrinogen testing on admission were excluded from the analysis. Methods The mean (\u00b1SD) age was 38.1 (14) years. Ninety-seven patients were male and 151 female; 116 had taken a paracetamol overdose (POD). The mean (\u00b1SD) fibrinogen on admission was 1.88 (1.24) g/l. Overall ICU mortality was 30.2% (POD 43.4%; non-POD 26.1%). Forty-nine patients received a transplant (14 POD and 35 non-POD). Results Fibrinogen levels (all in g/l) in survivors were higher than in nonsurvivors (1.98 \u00b1 1.26 vs 1.63 \u00b1 1.15; P = 0.033). Fibrinogen was higher in survivors of POD (1.81 \u00b1 1.0 vs 1.41 \u00b1 0.94; P = 0.039) and not significantly different between groups in non-POD hepatic failure (2.13 \u00b1 1.43 vs 1.85 \u00b1 1.31; P = 0.28). Fibrinogen was higher in those who survived after transplant (1.49 \u00b1 0.83 vs 1.23 \u00b1 0.23; P = 0.27). A cutoff value of fibrinogen of \u22641 g/l has sensitivity 0.47 and specificity 0.74 (positive predictive value (PPV) 0.44) for prediction of death in acute hepatic failure. In POD the sensitivity is 0.51, specificity 0.81 and PPV 0.59; in non-POD hepatic failure the values are 0.29, 0.73 and 0.31 respectively. In those POD who did not receive a transplant, fibrinogen \u22641 g/l has sensitivity 0.61, specificity 0.78 and PPV of 0.57 for death. Fibrinogen is higher in survivors of hepatic failure after POD. Conclusion Fibrinogen \u22641 g/l performs better than INR > 6.5 in predicting mortality after POD (sensitivity 0.69, specificity 0.61), but not as well as the combined King's College Criteria (sensitivity 0.69, specificity 0.96). Fibrinogen of \u22641 g/l in POD not meeting King's College Criteria for transplantation may identify a group with poor prognosis. A low fibrinogen level on admission may predict death after transplant (more data required).A Chan-Dominy, G Auzinger, W Bernal, E Sizer, J Wendon King's College Hospital, London, UK Critical Care 2007, 11(Suppl 2):P396 (doi: 10.1186/cc5556) Objective To determine the referral pattern and organ dysfunction severity of interhospital consultations, and triage practice at a specialised liver intensive therapy unit (LITU). Methods A prospective audit was conducted from 1 March to 30 November 2006, for all interhospital telephone referrals to ourBackground Patients with liver failure have haemodynamic and respiratory instability, the aetiology of which is unclear. Unregulated vasoactive mediators may have an important role in this physiological phenomenon. Carbon monoxide, a vasodilator, has been extensively studied and is easily measured using circulating carboxyhaemoglobin (COHb). The levels of circulating COHb have been reported as being elevated in patients with stable cirrhosis and hepatopulmonary syndrome. It is unknown whether the levels of COHb are elevated in patients with liver failure. Methods Patients admitted with acute liver dysfunction to the ITU between January 2003 and December 2005 were considered. Sixtyeight patients with acute liver failure (ALF) and 132 patients with decompensated chronic liver failure (DCLF) had a full dataset available on day 1 of admission. Patient demographics, physiological parameters, blood results and organ dysfunction were recorded prospectively and entered into a patient management system database (ICARE). Results There was no statistical difference in patient demographics, organ failure scores or physiological parameters between the groups. The median COHb percentage for ALF was 0.9% (0.7-1.2) and for DCLF 1.5% (1.2-1.8). In patients with DCLF, COHb negatively correlated with PaO 2 (r = -0.4, P = 0.05) and child Pugh (r = -0.4, P = 0.07). There was significant difference between grouped COHb and MAP in patients with ALF; there was a trend towards statistical significance with higher COHb. The arterial pH correlated with COHb in ALF (r = 0.4, P = 0.01). Conclusions These results suggest that COHb maybe an important mediator in haemodynamic and metabolic instability in ALF. In DCLF, COHb is an important factor in hypoxia and possible pulmonary shunting.Introduction Indocyanine green clearance (ICG), measured by the percentage disappearance rate (PDR), detects alterations in liver function and may be used as a noninvasive determinant of hepatic reserve in liver failure as well as a marker of graft function following liver transplantation. The administration of blood products does not interfere with the ICG-PDR as occurs with other prognostic scores (King's College and Clichy scores). The aims of this study were to compare in acute liver failure the ICG-PDR with King's College and Clichy scores and to determinate its predictive value. Methodology Between 2003 and 2006, 114 ICG-PDRs were performed in 38 children (mean age 2.6 years (range 1 month-16 years)) with acute liver damage. ICG was administrated intravenously and its blood concentration was detected over time by transcutaneous pulse densitometry using a commercially available bedside monitor. The PDR was performed under hemodynamic stability (systolic mean pressure >60 mmHg; saturation of central venous blood saturation >70% and CO 2 arterio-venous difference <8 mmHg).",

Seven randomly assigned pigs (DFX group) were treated with intravenous desferrioxamine (14.5 mg/kg/hour for 6 hours and 2.4 mg/kg/hour for the next 18 hours), whereas the remaining (control group) received standard care. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was obtained after central line placement, after surgery, at 7 hours, and 24 hours postoperatively and was analysed for cell counts, biochemical and oxidative markers of lung injury. Results DFX resulted in maintenance of blood pressure (mmHg) (84 \u00b1 27 in DFX vs 51 \u00b1 16 in control, P < 0.05) and attenuated the increase of intracranial pressure (mmHg) (19 \u00b1 10 in DFX vs 36 \u00b1 9 in control, P < 0.01) at 24 hours. Protein levels in BALF were increased in controls whereas in the DFX group protein (\u00b5g/ml) was significantly lower (at 7 hours 398 \u00b1 219 vs 187 \u00b1 67, respectively, P < 0.01; and at 24 hours 261 \u00b1 112 vs 162 \u00b1 52, respectively, P < 0.05). Nitrites in BALF were elevated at 7 hours in controls whereas a reduction was observed in the DFX group (3.924 \u00b1 3.67 \u00b5M vs 0.590 \u00b1 0.69 \u00b5M, respectively, P < 0.05). Phospholipase A 2 , platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase, nitrates, total cell counts, neutrophils and macrophages in BALF all increased in the control and DFX groups but did not differ significantly between them. Conclusion Treatment of ALF with DFX attenuates the increase of protein and nitrites in BALF, but does not seem to significantly affect phospholipase A 2 , platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase, nitrates, macrophages or neutrophils. The observed effects may suggest a protective role of DFX on lung inflammation during the first 24 hours of ALF.References 1. Crit Care Med 2004, 32:2079. 2. Am J Respir Cell Mol Biol 2003, 29:427. P400 Comparison of terlipressin and norepinephrine on cerebral perfusion, intracranial pressure and cerebral concentrations of lactate and pyruvate in patients with acute liver failure: a microdialysis study M Eefsen, T Dethloff, H Frederiksen, J Hauerberg, B Adel Hansen, F Stolze Larsen Rigshospitalet, University Hospital of Copenhagen, Denmark Critical Care 2007, 11(Suppl 2):P400 (doi: 10.1186/cc5560) Introduction Volume expansion and inotropic support with catecholamines are often insufficient to ensure adequate blood pressure and cerebral blood flow in acute liver failure (ALF). The Critical Care March 2007 Vol 11 Suppl 2 27th International Symposium on Intensive Care and Emergency Medicine S161aim of this study was to determine whether terlipressin increases cerebral perfusion and to compare the effect with that of norepinephrine (NE). Furthermore, the effect on intracranial pressure (ICP) and cerebral concentrations of lactate and pyruvate were recorded. Methods A retrospective study in a national four-bed liver ICU that treated 127 patients with ALF between 2001 and 2006. Thirty-eight of these patients were treated with terlipressin, and 10 patients (median age 42.5 years; range 15-66 years; five females) who also had an ICP and a microdialysis catheter placed in the cerebral cortex were included in this study. Concomitant measurements of mean arterial pressure (MAP), ICP, cerebral perfusion using transcranial Doppler sonography (V mean ) and cerebral concentrations of lactate and pyruvate were made before and after an increase in the NE infusion rate and i.v. injection of 1 mg terlipressin. Results NE infusion and terlipressin injection increased the MAP and V mean (P < 0.01). Also, the ICP increased during NE infusion (P < 0.01) but not after terlipressin. The cerebral lactate concentration was unchanged during NE infusion, while it decreased after terlipressin (P < 0.05). Conclusion This study shows that terlipressin increases the MAP and cerebral perfusion in patients with ALF with no influence upon ICP and the cerebral concentrations of lactate and pyruvate. These findings indicate that terlipressin may be valuable, as an additive, or alternative, treatment of arterial hypotension in patients with ALF to secure brain viability.P401 Relative adrenal insufficiency in patients with severe acute pancreatitis J De Waele 1 , E Hoste 1 , D Baert 2 , K Heyndrickx 3 , D Rijkckaert 4 , P Thibo 5 , P Van Biervliet 6 , F Colardyn 1 1 Ghent University Hospital, Ghent, Belgium; 2 AZ Maria Middelares, Ghent, Belgium; 3 OLV, Aalst, Belgium; 4 AZ St Lucas, Ghent, Belgium; 5 AZ Palfijn, Ghent, Belgium; 6 AZ Aurora, Oudenaarde, Belgium Critical Care 2007, 11(Suppl 2):P401 (doi: 10.1186/cc5561) Background Inadequate cortisol levels and adrenal dysfunction may play a role in the pathophysiology of severe acute pancreatitis.",

We compared the relative sensitivities of lipase and amylase at their upper limit of normal values for image-positive pancreatitis in a large consecutive series of patients who had simultaneous tests of amylase and lipase. Methods Consecutive patients with a clinical diagnosis of pancreatitis defined by constant epigastric pain and elevation of the amylase or lipase to greater than 106 U/l or 59 U/l, respectively, were imaged by abdominal sonography or computerized axial tomography (CAT) scan. All included patients had positive radiological evidence of acute pancreatitis.ResultsThe pancreas was visualized in 399/473 (84%) patients with suspected pancreatitis and 127/399 (38%) had radiological evidence of pancreatitis. Elevation of the lipase to >59 U/l detected 127/127 cases of image-positive pancreatitis, while elevation of the amylase to >106 U/l detected 113/127 cases (88% sensitive (0.82-0.94)). All cases of acute biliary pancreatitis were detected by both the lipase and amylase. The amylase missed 14 of 65 patients with nonbiliary etiologies of pancreatitis. Four of these were alcoholics. Conclusion Our study shows a high degree of relative sensitivity of the lipase compared with amylase for pancreatic injury that is demonstrable on CAT or sonographic imaging. Our findings demonstrate a relative lack of sensitivity of amylase for nonbiliary etiologies of pancreatitis. We recognize that the absolute sensitivity of lipase for image-positive pancreatitis cannot be determined by this retrospective methodology that required elevation of one marker for inclusion. The significance of gallbladder sludge in the patient with acute pancreatitisK  Delaney, L Velez UT Southwestern Medical School, Dallas, TX, USA Critical Care 2007, 11(Suppl 2):P403 (doi: 10.1186/cc5563)BackgroundThe significance of gallbladder sludge as a potential cause of acute biliary pancreatitis is debated. We report the incidence and outcome of patients with gallbladder sludge in a large population of patients with pancreatitis. Methods Pancreatitis was defined as constant epigastric pain with lipase greater than three times the upper reference value for our laboratory (177 U/l). Consecutive patients with first episodes of acute pancreatitis were identified over a 2-year period and data were evaluated retrospectively. Patients were followed prospectively for 2 years more. Results All patients had gallbladder ultrasound examinations. First episodes of acute pancreatitis were identified in 356 patients. Initially 236 patients had stones directly visualized in the gallbladder. Of the remaining 120 patients, 13 had sludge, 11 had a dilated common bile duct, one had a positive sonographic Murphy sign, and 95 had no abnormalities. During the time course of the study, 23 of these 120 patients were demonstrated to have stones; by the surgical pathology report (12), endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatography (10), and cholecystostomy (one). Seven of 13 patients with sludge underwent cholestectomy and all had evidence of stones. Four of six nonoperated patients with sludge (67%) returned with recurrent pancreatitis over the course of the study. Ten of 97 patients (10%) with suspected nonbiliary etiology of the pancreatitis returned with recurrent pancreatitis over the same period. The nonoperated patients with sludge were more likely to have other risk factors for nonbiliary pancreatitis than were the operated patients.Conclusions The presence of sludge on the gallbladder ultrasound suggests the presence of stones and is associated with a high rate of recurrence of pancreatitis in nonoperated patients.",

During the resuscitative phase the NS group required more fluid to maintain the goal MAP than the RL group: 330.8 \u00b1 38.1 ml/kg vs 148.4 \u00b1 20.2 ml/kg, P = 0.001. There was nearly a fourfold increase in mean EVLW between the groups: 5.24 \u00b1 1.26 ml/kg NS vs 1.46 \u00b1 0.57 ml/kg RL, P = 0.013. The difference in EVLW was accounted for entirely by the difference in the volume infused (P = 0.008), with no difference seen with fluid type (P = 0.7). The EVLW began to increase immediately with fluid administration without exhibiting a threshold effect. An increase of 1 ml/kg EVLW occurred at a resuscitative volume of 63 \u00b1 25 ml/kg. Conclusion In this swine model of traumatic hemorrhagic shock, resuscitation with RL as compared with NS required less fluid to maintain goal MAP and resulted in less EVLW formation. The near fourfold difference in EVLW increase was accounted for entirely by the differences in volumes needed to maintain goal MAP with no differences seen with fluid type. This study suggests that, in order to limit increases in EVLW during early resuscitation of hemorrhagic shock prior to the arrival of blood products, RL should be used preferentially instead of NS and the volume infused limited to approximately 60 ml/kg. The aim of this study was to compare the effect of hydroxyethylstarch (HES) and human albumin solution (HAS) on human neutrophil elastase (HNE) release in patients undergoing elective knee replacement surgery. Forty-three patients (ASA 1 or 2) were randomly allocated into two groups. Group A (n = 21) received 5 ml/kg of 4.5% HAS preoperatively and a further 5 ml/kg HAS as an intraoperative replacement. Postoperatively the patients received Ringers' lactate at the discretion of the anaesthetic team. Group B was given 5 ml/kg HES (Fresenius-Kabi) preoperatively and a further 5 ml/kg HES intra-operatively. Thereafter fluid management was as in group A. Arterial blood samples were taken preoperatively and at 5 minutes, 30 minutes, 60 minutes, 120 minutes, 240 minutes and 24 hours post-tourniquet release for HNE and arterial blood gas analysis. Repeated measures of analysis of variance established a significant difference in the pattern of change of HNE levels (log transformed) and the PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratios with time between the two groups. Follow-up t tests revealed significantly lower levels of HNE(Table 1) and also significantly higher PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratios in Group B post-tourniquet release.In conclusion, the results suggest that infusion of HES lowers HNE release from activated neutrophils in postoperative knee replacement patients and may lead to less lung injury.",

            "text": "abstract P407)Introduction Chloride and bicarbonate concentrations share an inverse reciprocal relationship during either acidosis or alkalosis. This relationship is, in part, due to the red cell chloride shift. However, according to the Stewart quantitative approach to acidbase balance, it seems conceivable to expect a greater relationship between the strong ion difference (SID) and bicarbonate, rather then between chloride and bicarbonate. We propose that, with decreasing haemoglobin (Hb) levels, the SID preserves its independent role with respect to bicarbonate, while chloride gradually loses its relationship. Methods We retrospectively collected blood gas analysis and electrolytes, from 206 patients, measured on a single blood sample taken on admission. We calculated the apparent SID through the following formula:[Na + ] + [K + ] + [Ca 2+ ] + [Mg 2+ ] -[Cl -] -[Lact -] (mEq/l).

Transfusion from male-only vs female donors in critically ill recipients of high plasma volume componentsO Gajic 1 , M Yilmaz 1 , R Iscimen 1 , D Kor 1 , J Winters 1 , B Afessa 2 , J Farmer 1 1 Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA; 2 Mayo Clinic College of Medicine, Rochester, MN, USA Critical Care 2007, 11(Suppl 2):P410 (doi: 10.1186/cc5570)Objective To reduce the incidence of transfusion-related acute lung injury (ALI), the American Association of Blood Banks (AABB) has recently recommended rapid implementation of strategies to minimize transfusion of high plasma volume components, fresh frozen plasma and apheresis platelets, from potentially alloimunized donors, especially females. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of transfusing components from male-only vs female donors on development of ALI, gas exchange, and outcome in critically ill patients. Methods In this retrospective case-control study we identified patients who received more than two units of high plasma volume components from male-only donors and compared them with patients matched by severity of illness, postoperative state and number of transfusions but who received high plasma volume components from female donors. Results From a database of 3,567 patients who received a total of 46,101 units fresh frozen plasma and 6,251 units apheresis platelets, we identified 112 patients who received three or more male-only donor components and 112 matched controls. Baseline characteristics, ALI risk factors and development of ALI were similar between the two groups. Arterial oxygenation (PaO 2 /FiO 2 ) worsened after the female donor components (mean difference -52, 95% CI -14 to -91, P = 0.008) but not after male-only donor product transfusion (mean difference +22, 95% CI -23 to + 67, P = 0.325). Male-only component recipients had more ventilatorfree days (median 28 vs 27, P = 0.006) and a trend towards lower hospital mortality (14% vs 24%, P = 0.054).Conclusion In critically ill recipients of high plasma volume components, gas exchange worsened significantly after transfusion of female but not male donor components. Prospective studies are needed to evaluate the effect of AABB recommendations on outcome of transfused critically ill patients. Evaluation of red blood cell transfusion effects in lactate and central venous oxygen saturation in patients with severe sepsis and septic shock B Mazza, M Assuncao, F Freitas, M Jackiu, H Fernandes, F Machado Escola Paulista de Medicina -Universidade Federal de S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil Critical Care 2007, 11(Suppl 2):P411 (doi: 10.1186/cc5571)Introduction Red blood cell (RBC) transfusion is very often performed in critically ill patients despite its potential complications. Its effects on oxygen delivery and microcirculation are not well known. This study aimed at evaluating RBC effects in blood lactate levels (LAC) and central venous oxygen saturation (SvcO 2 ) in patients with severe sepsis and septic shock. Methods A prospective study enrolling patients admitted to an ICU at a university hospital with severe sepsis and septic shock presenting hemoglobin (Hb) levels below 9.0 g/dl. These patients were randomized for maintaining Hb >9 g/dl (Group 1) or >7 g/dl (Group 2). Before (preT) and at least 1 hour after each transfusion (postT) LAC, SvcO 2 and Hb data were collected. Data were analysed by analysis of variance, paired t test and paired Wilcoxon test. Results were considered significant if P \u2264 0.05. Results Thirty-six transfusions were evaluated in 21 patients (mean age 59.0 \u00b1 15.8 years, 11 females/10 males) with APACHE II score of 13.8 \u00b1 4.1. Each group included 18 patients. The levels of Hb preT and postT were 7.51 \u00b1 1.03 and 8.48 \u00b1 1.15 (P < 0.05). There was a significant difference between preT and postT SvcO 2 (70.9 \u00b1 8.66 and 73.6 \u00b1 7.2, P = 0.01) but not in LAC levels (24.1 \u00b1 8.9 and 22.9 \u00b1 7.6, P = 0.45). When groups were analyzed separately, only in Group 2 was a significant difference found (P = 0.0005 and 0.05, respectively for SvcO 2 and LAC). In 10 transfusions a worsening of SvcO 2 postT was S165 observed and all these patients had preT SvcO 2 > 70%. Although there was no significant correlation between a worsening in SvcO 2 and preT Hb, eight of these patients were allocated to Group 1. Another 13 transfusions were done with a SvcO 2 preT < 70, and 10 of them improved (> 5%) after transfusion (mean percentage of improvement = 18.9%). Only four of these patients were allocated to Group 1. Patients with high levels of preT LAC (n = 21) only improved (reduction > 10%) in 42.9% of cases. A total 53.3% of patients with normal preT LAC levels worsened (rising > 10%) postT. The mean preT Hb from these patients was 8.18 \u00b1 0.9. Conclusion In patients with SvcO 2 < 70 and/or Hb < 7.0 g/dl, transfusion seems to result in an improvement of perfusion parameters. However, in patients with SvcO 2 > 70 or normal lactate levels, transfusion seems to impair tissue perfusion.Introduction Red blood cell (RBC) transfusion is very often performed in critically ill patients despite its potential complications. New guidelines recommend that doctors should have conservative behavior regarding its use. The objective of this study was to evaluate the transfusion profile among patients in ICUs at a university hospital in Brazil. Methods A prospective evaluation of all patients admitted to six ICUs (surgical-medical, private, neurosurgery, medical, pneumology and coronary units) that have received a RBC transfusion as indicated by assistant physicians during October/November 2005. Clinical data as well as the characteristics of the transfusion were collected and submitted to univariate statistical analysis (chisquared and Student's t test). Results were considered significant if P \u2264 0.05. Results Four hundred and eight transfusions were made in 71 patients (38 females, 33 males), 35 medical/36 surgical, with a mean age 57.2 \u00b1 8.4 years, mean APACHE II score 17.7 \u00b1 5.3, and mean SOFA score on the day of transfusion 6.09 \u00b1 3.99. At admission, 60 patients (84.5%) had comorbidities, 10 (14.1%) had chronic coronary disease. At transfusion, 54.9% had sepsis, severe sepsis or septic shock, and 9.9% had acute coronary syndrome. The mean hemoglobin (Hb) level at ICU admission was 9.69 \u00b1 2.3 g/dl and the mean level that triggered transfusion was 6.88 \u00b1 1.1 g/dl. The most important transfusion indication was Hb levels (49.8%), followed by active bleeding (31.8%). The mean number of RBC transfused per time was 1.68 \u00b1 0.96 and the mean age of RBC was 14.3 \u00b1 7.83 days (46.6% had more than 14 days). Adverse events occurred in 3.4%. The 28-day mortality rate was 47.1%. Only the SOFA score at the day of transfusion correlated with mortality (P = 0.004). There was no correlation with age, type of ICU, APACHE II score, total number or age of RBC, Hb at admission or Hb pretransfusion. There was a significant difference between the pretransfusion Hb (P < 0.00001) and the number of RBC transfused at the same time considering all ICU enrolled in the study (P < 0.00001). Conclusions The Hb level that triggered transfusion was in agreement with recent guidelines regarding critically ill patients, although there was a difference between all ICUs. Despite the fact that there is a scarceness of RBC, the RBC were higher in age.The missing correlation with mortality can be due to the small sample size.

The aim of the study was to assess the transfusion practices in Tunisia. Patients and methods A multicentric prospective observational study of about 1,000 transfusions practiced during 2004 in Tunisia. Data were determined by the prescriptor of the transfusion. The data were analyzed with SPSS 12.0. Results The mean age of the transfused patients was 35.78 years. The sex ratio was 1.2. A total of 48.3% of the patients had transfusion history. Allogeneic immunization and viral serology conversion were reported in 2.1% of these patients. The indications were generally carried in front of chronic medical pathologies (36.9%), acute medical pathologies (28.2%) and surgical pathologies (elective 11.7%, urgent 11.2%). The haemoglobin threshold for transfusion was 7.29 g/dl and depended on the indication of the red cell transfusion: 6.16 g/dl for urgent medical pathologies, 6.22 g/dl for chronic medical pathologies, 7.74 g/dl for urgent surgical pathologies, 10.38 g/dl for elective surgery, 6.15 g/dl for urgent obstetrical pathologies. The mean platelet count was 24,000 (patients transfused by platelet units). The ABO and rhesus determination were made in 99% of the cases. A phenotypic determination was required in only 34.5% of the cases. The search for irregular agglutinins was made in 20.7% of the cases. The test of compatibility at the laboratory was practiced in 95.4% of the cases. The amount of blood transfused was 2 units.",

On the other hand, the bleeding time (BT), the only comprehensive test to explore primary haemostasis, detects otherwise unknown defects in plateletvessel wall interactions. The present study was undertaken in order to clarify whether the BT and platelet function tested preoperatively could predict the perioperative transfusion requirements in cardiac surgery patients.Patients and methodsSixty-eight patients (54 males/14 females) participated in the study. Thirty-two patients underwent valve(s) replacement (group A) and the remaining underwent coronary artery bypass grafting(s) (group B). The BT determination was performed according to the Mielke technique using Surgicutt devices (ITC, USA). Platelet function was evaluated by the aggregation procedure using four agonists: ADP, arachidonic acid, collagen and ristocetin at a final concentration of 4 x 10 -6 M, 0.5 mg/ml, 0.19 mg/ml and 1.2 mg/ml, respectively. Results (1) In the immediate postoperative time, a significant reduction in haemoglobulin levels was observed in both groups compared with that of the preoperative time (13.3%, P < 0.05 for group A and 28.4%, P < 0.01 for group B). No difference existed in haemoglobulin levels between groups postoperatively. (2) Platelet values were slightly different between the groups. A significant decrease in platelet count was observed in both groups postoperatively (28.7%, P < 0.03 for group A and 22.4%, P < 0.05 for group B).(3)The results of BT and platelet activation (performed preoperatively) were similar for patients who underwent valve replacement and patients who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting -although in this group platelet activation with arachidonic acid and ADP was ~11% lower with both agonists. (4) The transfusion requirements were slightly higher for patients in group A, and more patients in group B received no transfusion (one vs four patients). Conclusion In patients undergoing cardiac surgery with a negative history of bleeding and early interruption of antiplatelet treatment, the BT and platelet function do not offer much in the setting to predict perioperative bleeding.Adana State Hospital, Adana, Turkey; 2 Dokuz Eylul University, School of Medicine, Izmir, Turkey Critical Care 2007, 11(Suppl 2):P415 (doi: 10.1186/cc5575)Objective To investigate the ratio and characteristics of aggression, threat and physical violence directed towards staff in emergency departments as a model of state hospitals. Methods A questionnaire were filled in by the staff working in the emergency department of three high-volume inner-city state hospitals. The individualized data collected were relevant to the pattern of violence, age, sex, number of years in the profession, nature of the job, and the behavioral characteristics of assailants, and outcome of incidents. The data were abstracted between 1 May and 31 May 2006. Results A total of 109 staff reports were reviewed. The relationship of aggression with sex, age and years of experience were insignificant (P values were 0.464, 0.692, and 0.298, respectively), while profession was very significantly related (P = 0.000). The relation between threat and sex is P = 0.311, experience 0.994, profession 0.326, age 0.278. The relationship of threat with sex, years of experience, profession and age were insignificant (P values were 0.311, 0.994, 0.326, and 0.278, respectively). On the other hand, physical assault was found significantly related to sex, years of experience, profession and age (P values were 0.042, 0.011, 0.000, and 0.000, respectively). Conclusion Violence to the staff is common. There is not a significant relationship between aggression, threat and personal characters. However, male sex, >5 years experience, emergency doctor, \u226531 years of age are the risk factors for physical violence. Shaken baby syndrome: the classical clinical triad is still valid in recent court rulings Introduction Subdural haemorrhage, retinal bleeding and hypoxaemic encephalopathy have long been considered a diagnostic clinical triad for the so-called shaken baby syndrome (SBS). The classical triad, however, has been challenged in the recent past by the socalled 'unified hypothesis' by Geddes and colleagues[1]  with subsequent implications in court rulings in suspected cases of SBS. Judicial and scientific dilemma The unified hypothesis by Geddes suggested an alternative cause for SBS injuries that did not involve significant shaking. The Geddes theory led to the speculation that subdural and retinal haemorrhage was not caused by traumatic shearing of subdural and retinal veins but by a combination of cerebral hypoxia, raised intracranial pressure and raised arterial and central venous pressure. The publication of this theory was met with scepticism by many forensic and paediatric pathologists but was enthusiastically embraced by defence attorneys. This dilemma resulted in the UK with several appeals against prior convictions of murder/manslaughter because of alleged traumatic shaking of young children. The forensic community awaited with great interest the ruling of the Court of Appeal in London on 21 July 2005. Court ruling of 21 July 2005 Four cases of alleged SBS were brought to the Court of Appeal in London. Two convictions were upheld, one conviction was dismissed and one conviction was reduced from murder to manslaughter. In their written judgement their Lordships clearly stated: 'In our judgment, it follows that the unified hypothesis can no longer be regarded as a credible or alternative cause of the triad of injuries'. The Crown Prosecution Service made a press release that 'Today's judgement sends a clear signal validating the CPS in prosecuting Shaken Baby Syndrome cases. The Geddes theory will no longer be used by the defence.' Conclusions Diagnosing SBS is a very complex and delicate matter.The mere presence of the classic triad does not automatically or necessarily lead to a diagnosis of nonaccidental head injury or a conclusion of unlawful killing. Diagnosis of (intentional) SBS must be based on the combination of: medical elements, elements from police inquiry, and forensic and crime scene elements. Physicians, particularly those working at the medico-legal interface (such as emergency physicians), should realise that medical observations may play a pivotal role in the diagnosis of SBS.As important is the realisation that, despite alternative hypothesis in medical literature, the classical triad of symptoms (subdural haemorrhage, retinal bleeding, hypoxaemic encephalopathy) is still valid as diagnostic for SBS according to recent (UK) court ruling.

Introduction A retrospective study performed between 1 January 2001 and 31 October 2006 in patients admitted to the ICU with S167 organophosphate poisoning (OPP). The aim of the study was to determine the relation between mortality and: (a) toxicity of organophosphate, (b) time between ingestion and management of the patient, (c) coligernic manifestations, (d) time and doses of oximes and atropine. Methods Were admitted to the ICU 29 patients with OPP. The data were treated by SPSS 14 for Windows and the analysis consisted of a descriptive study, analytic study (chi-square analysis, Spearman association analysis) and comparison between groups (Student t analysis, Wilcoxon Mann-Whitney and Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests). The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) was applied for the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score. Results Twenty-nine patients were included in the study, 21 males and eight females. The mean age of the males was 47.71 years (SD = 13.58) and of females was 41.0 years (SD = 11.66), and 62.7% were from a rural area and 37.3% from an urban area. Mortality does not have a significant statistic relation (P > 0.05) with toxicity of organophosphate, time and doses of atropine. However, statistical significance was found between mortality and: (a) time between ingestion of the poison and treatment (Spearman test, r s = -0.596, P < 0.05), (b) muscarinic manifestations (chisquare test, \u03c7 2 = 4.152, P < 0.05), (c) time of oximes (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test with Z = 1.439, P < 0.05) and doses of oximes (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test with Z = 1.412, P < 0.05). The ROC analysis reveals that for the respiratory SOFA at 9 days, the area under the ROC curve was 0.917; this means that this SOFA score can predict correctly in 91.7% of the cases. Conclusion In our study we concluded that the mortality rate was increased with prolonged perfusion of oximes and with muscarinic manifestations of OPP but not with the time and dose of atropine. The respiratory SOFA score at 9 days matches with prediction in above 90% of the cases. Approaches of Turkish anesthesiologists to delirium observed in intensive care unit patients N Gokmen, L Iyilikci, S Kucukguclu, B Kuvaki, L Ciftci, A Gunerli Dokuz Eylul University, School of Medicine, Izmir, Turkey Critical Care 2007, 11(Suppl 2):P418 (doi: 10.1186/cc5578) Objective To determine attitudes and practices of the Turkish anesthesiologists and residents about delirium in the ICU. Methods An anonymous questionnaire consisting of 22 questions [1] was mailed to 258 anesthesiologists and residents.Results One hundred and fifty-four questionnaires were returned (60% response). Of the respondents, 57% were male and 61% were residents. One-half of respondents work in hospitals with more than 800 beds; 65% of respondents had an ICU facility of 7-12 beds. Seventy-two percent of the respondents had seen delirium in the ICU and also 70.2% of these respondents observed delirium in <25% of patients who were on mechanical ventilation. Although delirium was accepted a significant or very serious problem by 92.5% of the respondents, underdiagnosis was acknowledged by 74%. Routine screening for delirium was performed by 41.6% of the anesthesiologists and 88.1% of them were repeating daily. Clinical assessment was used in 76.7% of the screenings. Delirium was treated with haloperidol and benzodiazepine by 61.5% and 24% of the respondents. Of the respondents, 93.4% were not able to attend a meeting related to delirium and 67.6% did not read even an article about delirium.Conclusions Turkish anesthesiologists and residents consider delirium a relatively common and serious problem. However, they seldom perform screening tests and try to update their knowledge regarding delirium.Reference 1. Ely EW, et al.: Crit Care Med 2004, 32:106-112.P419A comparison of the confusion assessment method for the intensive care unit and the NEECHAM confusion scale in intensive care delirium assessmentIntroduction Reports indicate an incidence of intensive care delirium of 11-87%. The confusion assessment method for the intensive care unit (CAM-ICU) is widely used in delirium assessment in ICUs. However, its binomial results constrain the evaluation of severity. The NEECHAM confusion scale has recently been validated for use in the ICU and uses a numeric assessment. This scale allows the patients to be classified in four categories of delirium severity (normal, at-risk, mild to early, moderate to severe).In this study we investigated the diagnostic value of the NEECHAM referring to the CAM-ICU. Methods A consecutive sample of 106 patients in a mixed ICU (cardiac surgery (CS) 35%, noncardiac surgery (NCS) 26%, internal medicine (IM) 39%, age 62 \u00b1 14 years, male 63%) was assessed after a stay in the ICU \u226524 hours. All patients with a Glasgow Coma Scale \u2265 10 and age \u2265 18 years were included. A nurse researcher simultaneously assessed both scales once daily in the morning. A total of 272 paired observations were made. Data were analyzed using the NEECHAM cut-off values of \u226426 (at-risk), \u226424 (mild delirium), and \u226419 (severe delirium). Results Using the CAM-ICU the overall prevalence was 15%. Prevalences in CS, NCS and IM were 9%, 14% and 21%, respectively. Using the NEECHAM scale, the overall prevalence was 33% (16.5% mild, 16.5% severe) and 36%, 21% and 38% for the three patient categories, respectively. Sensitivity was 100%, specificity was 79%, positive predictive value was 46% and negative predictive value was 100%. Using the cut-off value \u226419, sensitivity was 83% and specificity was 96%. All positive CAM-ICU patients were detected by the NEECHAM (85% severe, 15% mild). However, 21% of the CAM-ICU negative patients had a NEECHAM value that diagnoses delirium (4% severe, 17% mild). Consequently, 27% of the CS group (19% severe, 8% mild), 7% of the NCS group (7% mild) and 17% of the IM group (2% severe, 15% mild) were diagnosed to be delirious using the NEECHAM and not delirious using the CAM-ICU. Conclusion The NEECHAM delirium scale identified all cases of delirium that were detected by the CAM-ICU. Moreover, additional delirious patients were identified, especially in the CS group. In this pilot experience, the NEECHAM scale was a valuable screening tool for intensive care. S168 process and prolong the ICU stay. We investigated whether intensivists and ICU nurses could clinically identify the presence of delirium in ICU patients during daily care. Methods All patients in a 3-month period who stayed >48 hours in the ICU were evaluated daily for the presence or absence of delirium by treating intensivists and ICU nurses responsible for daily care. Patients were evaluated independently for the occurrence of delirium by a trained group of ICU nurses who were not involved in the daily care of the patients under study. Since communication with ventilated patients is compromised due to the inability to speak, a specific scoring system was used (confusion assessment method for the intensive care unit (CAM-ICU)), which has been developed for the evaluation of the presence of delirium. Delirium as judged present by this CAM-ICU correlates well with a DSM-IV delirium diagnosis by a trained psychiatrist. Values are expressed as the median and interquartile range (IQR).Results During the study period, 46 patients (30 males, 16 females), age 73 (IQR = 64-80) years with an ICU stay of 6 (4-11) days were evaluated. CAM-ICU scores were obtained during 481 patient-days. Considering the CAM-ICU as the gold standard, delirium occurred in 50% of the patients with a duration of 3 (1-9) days. Days with delirium were poorly recognized by doctors (sensitivity = 29.8%; specificity = 99.7%; PPV = 99.6%) and ICU nurses (sensitivity = 35.6%; specificity = 97.8%; PPV = 84%). Patients with a delirium were longer on the ventilator (6 (4-25) days), and had a longer ICU (9 (6-26) days) and hospital stay (29 (21-41) days) than those without delirium during their ICU stay (4 (1-6), P = 0.01; 5 (3-8), P = 0.002; and 19 (7-30), P = 0.01), respectively. APACHE II and SAPS II scores were comparable in both groups. Conclusion Delirium is badly recognized in the ICU by intensivists and ICU nurses. In view of the impact of delirium on ICU and hospital stay, more attention should be paid to the implementation of a delirium screening instrument during daily ICU care.IntroductionThe interest of sedation in ICU patients has been increasing the last 10 years.

            "text": "Introduction The goal of this study was to compare the duration of mechanical ventilation (MV), the length of stay (LOS) and the direct medical costs of remifentanil-based sedation (RS) vs conventional sedation (CS) in ICU patients requiring MV. Methods A Markov model was developed based on UltiSAFE, a recent Dutch open-label randomized controlled study that included patients with an expected MV time of 2-3 days. Study medication was either CS (morphine or fentanyl combined with propofol, midazolam or lorazepam according to Dutch guidelines) or RS (remifentanil, combined with propofol when required). The LOS on the ICU, the time at which the patient was eligible for weaning or extubation and the actual time of weaning and extubation, plus all study drugs with all adjustments in dosage, were recorded. The model describes the patient flow on the ICU. Three states were defined: MV before weaning, MV after weaning has started before extubation, post-MV before discharge. At every hour, patients either stay at the current state, move to the next state or die. Transition probabilities and the costs of the study drugs were derived from UltiSAFE, whereas all other direct medical costs on the ICU were estimated in a separate Dutch monocenter micro-costing study. All costs were measured from the hospital perspective with 2006 as the reference year. The time horizon used in the model was 28 days. Results From the trial data, it was estimated that the costs of RS on MV before the start of weaning amount to \u20ac22 per hour, compared with \u20ac15 for the CS treatment. After the start of weaning, these costs decrease to \u20ac8 per hour for RS and \u20ac2 per hour for CS. The LOS on the ICU was 9.2 days in the CS group vs 8.1 days in the RS group (difference 1.1, 95% CI 0.6-1.5), whereas the length of time on MV was 6.3 days and 5.2 days, respectively, with a difference of 1.1 day (95% CI 0.6-1.6). The average total 28-day costs were \u20ac15,911 in the CS group vs \u20ac14,855 in the RS group, resulting in RS related cost-savings of \u20ac1,056 (95% CI \u20ac58-2,054). Conclusion Compared with CS, RS seems to be the preferred regimen for patients with an expected MV time of 2-3 days. It not only significantly decreases the length of ICU stay and the total costs but also significantly reduces the duration of MV, which is a risk factor for ventilator-associated morbidity. Assessment and management of pain in children in A&E: are we doing it the right way?Introduction Pain management is one of the most important components in patient care. The severity of the pain should be assessed effectively and weight-based analgesia should be given. The BAEM Clinical Effectiveness Committee standard of analgesia for moderate and severe pain within 20 minutes of arrival in A&E should be applied to children in all A&E Departments Methods A retrospective study. Five casualty cards with soft tissue injury and fractures in children under 16 years old were picked randomly every day from January 2005. The assessment and management of pain was recorded in each case. A validated pain score tool -Alder Hey triage pain score -was introduced April S171 2005. Five casualty cards were picked randomly every day from May 2005. The assessment and management of pain in each case was recorded. Results There were 155 patients in each month. In January, none of the patients were assessed for the severity of their pain; 34 patients received analgesia, of which 15 received weight-based and 19 received age-based analgesia. In May, 84 patients were assessed for the severity of their pain with the Alder Hey triage pain score; 63 received weight-based and two received age-based analgesia. The rest had no pain. Conclusion The Alder Hey triage pain score should be introduced in A&E as it serves as an effective means of assessing pain in children of all age groups. Analgesia should be prescribed based on the weight of the children.",

A comprehensive, individualized assessment of pain that incorporates activity levels is necessary to promote satisfactory management of pain. We recommend the use of remifentanil infusion for postoperative pain relief in suitable cardiac surgery patients.Introduction Opioids and endogenous opioid peptides possess immunomodulating properties and are involved in the regulation of immunocyte activity. These effects are mediated by opioid receptors (OR) on peripheral white blood cells that can be detected and quantified by flow cytometry. We investigated OR expression on neutrophils using polyclonal antibodies against \u03b4-opioid, \u03ba-opioid and \u00b5-opioid receptors (DOR, KOR, MOR) to assess spontaneous and TNF\u03b1-induced OR expression on neutrophils. Methods After approval by the local ethics committee and informed consent, 100 \u00b5l whole blood samples from 11 healthy volunteers (EDTA served as anticoagulant) was incubated with 10 \u00b5l TNF-\u03b1 (100 ng/ml) for 3, 6, 12 and 24 hours. Samples were washed and incubated with 5 \u00b5l fluorescein-isothiocynate (FITC)labelled polyclonal antibodies against human MOR, KOR and DOR. Rabbit IgG antibodies served as a negative control. After red cell lysis, flow cytometry was performed to quantify OR expression using live gating on neutrophils. The percentage of positive cells as well as mean fluorescent intensities (MFIs) were determined. Results Stimulation with TNF\u03b1 increased the percentage of DORexpressing cells significantly from 2.1% to 12.8% positive cells after 6 hours. After 12 hours of stimulation 28.6%, and after 24 hours even 68.1%, of neutrophils expressed DOR. The MFI increased during TNF\u03b1 stimulation from 47.6 \u00b1 15.7 to 254.8 \u00b1 110 after 6 hours, staying levelled at this height. After 6 hours of stimulation, the MFI for KOR reached a maximum, rising from 59.5 \u00b1 19.4 to 513.9 \u00b1 162. During TNF\u03b1 stimulation, the percentage of positive cells increased from 5.4 to 65.0% after 24 hours (17.5% at 6 hours). Fourteen per cent of neutrophils expressed MOR after 6 hours (initially 5.4%) and up to 57.2% after 24 hours. The MOR MFI was measured at 43.4 \u00b1 16.3 to 410 \u00b1 263.6 6 hours after stimulation with TNF\u03b1. Conclusion Our results display that stimulation of whole blood with TNF\u03b1 amplifies OR expression of all subtypes significantly on neutrophils. We suggest further studies to clarify the specific actions of opioids and their receptors in health and acute inflammation.

Objectives for the program were to reduce mortality and improve efficiency of ICU resource use through early identification of patients at risk of deterioration and the provision of rapid resuscitation to abort avoidable ICU admissions. The program was designed to train nonphysician responders (primarily nurses and respiratory therapists) supported by remote physician oversight, especially in centres where ICU-trained physicians were not available. Methods Following an educational needs assessment of learners, a multicomponent critical care response team (CCRT) training course was developed. The 2-day course consisted of a series of small group, interactive, case-based seminars, high-fidelity simulation training, and the publication of a CCRT Provider Manual and Quick Reference Cards. A database for monitoring the effectiveness and impact of the CCRTs was also developed.ResultsBeginning in October 2005, 24 CCRT physician instructors were trained in one of two streams: (i) simulator instructors with skills in constructive feedback and assessment of crisis management skills; (ii) instructors who further refined the case-based seminars and edited the Quick Reference Cards. Acquisition of equipment, liaisons with participating hospitals and creation of the CCRT database were completed in the spring of 2006. Since June 2006, 12 CCRT courses have been run, and 263 participants have been trained as CCRT Providers (87% nurses, and 13% respiratory therapists). Local hospital implementation and preceptored programs occurred over a 12-week period before CCRTs we made available full time (24/7). Conclusions It has been demonstrated that unmet needs in critical care education and training for allied healthcare professionals can be identified and corrected through the development and implementation of a multidisciplinary course designed to facilitate creation of CCRTs in the Province of Ontario.

Blood from a peripheral venous puncture, central venous line and arterial line were collected, at the same timepoint each 12 hours. Peripheral lactate collection was performed carefully with the left superior limb garroted for a maximal of 2 minutes. Data were analysed by linear correlation test, and a Bland-Altman test was done to verify the degree of agreement between values from different samples. A P value <0.05 was considered significant.

To insure clinical effect and to avoid side-effects, it is crucial to monitor concentrations very carefully. Prediction models can save time and resources, enabling clinicians and nurses to improve clinical care. The performance of linear and nonlinear support vector machines (SVM) as prediction models for the tacrolimus blood concentration in liver transplantation patients is compared with linear regression analysis. Methods Five hundred and twenty-three tacrolimus blood concentration levels, together with 35 other relevant variables from 56 liver transplantation patients between 2002 and 2006, were extracted from Ghent University Hospital database (ICU Information System IZIS) (Centricity Critical Care Clinisoft; GE Healthcare).",

Aging is associated with decreased cardiopulmonary and renal reserve as well as the development of progressive organ failure. Objective To evaluate outcomes of very old patients in mechanical ventilation. Patients and methods A prospective cohort study in the medical/surgical ICU of a tertiary-care Brazilian hospital. Two hundred and forty-four patients aged 85 years old or more were selected from 7,410 patients admitted to the ICU from October 2002 to September 2006. Data were extracted from the QUATI (Dixtal-Brazil) database and included sex, age, APACHE II score, ventilation-days, length of stay, incidence of sepsis, tracheotomy, dialysis therapy and hemodynamic monitoring. For statistical analysis we used the chi-square test for evaluated difference of proportion, and considered statistical significance as P < 0.05. Results There were 168 female (68.9%) and 75 male (30.7%) patients. The mean age of the study population and the APACHE II score were 89.55 \u00b1 3.61 years and 17.98 \u00b1 6.3, respectively. Median ventilation-days and length of stay were 6 and 8.14 days, respectively. Tracheotomy was performed in 44.1%, dialysis therapy in 15.2% and hemodynamic monitoring in 19.8%. Only the group above 95 years old had a significant increase of days of ventilation and length of stay: 18.77 vs 10.47 days (P = 0.01) and 19.74 vs 12.86 days (P = 0.07), respectively. The predicted APACHE II mortality for the studied population was 26.9 \u00b1 17.21% and the present rate to the population studied was 47.7%. Patients in dialysis and with diagnosis of sepsis at admission had poorer prognosis (respectively a 1.6 and 1.52 times likely ratio to die). Care March 2007 Vol 11 Suppl 2 27th International Symposium on Intensive Care and Emergency Medicine S193 Conclusion The percentage of older patients admitted to the ICU is increasing. The need for tracheotomy and dialysis as well as the length of stay are increasing with this population. APACHE scores do not seem to present a good relationship with mortality in this population. Dialysis and sepsis were associated with a significant increase in mortality.

Methods From 1 January 1997 to 1 December 2006, the AIIPM, LOS and hospital mortality were prospectively recorded and the standardised mortality ratio (SMR) was calculated. Patients were categorised in cohorts of AIIPM. Results Hospital mortality in the NO group was 58.9%, and in the O group was 75.4% (P = 0.001, chi-square).

We carried out a multicentre survey to evaluate visiting policies in Italian ICUs. Methods An email questionnaire was sent to all 303 ICUs (general and specialized) in the Italian collaborative Gruppo Italiano per la Valutazione degli Interventi in Terapia Intensiva, asking about their visiting policies. Results The response rate was 84.8% (257/303). The median daily visiting time was 60 minutes (10th percentile: 30 minutes; 90th percentile: 120 minutes); however, 2% of ICUs allowed no visiting whatsoever. A total 54.8% of ICUs surveyed had only one daily visiting slot, and 44% two. Only 1.2% had more than two visiting slots. The number of visitors was restricted in 91.8% of ICUs. The type of visitors (immediate family only) was restricted in 17.5% of ICUs. Children were not permitted to visit in 69.1% of ICUs and 17.5% had a minimum age limit for visitors. In the case of a dying patient, 20.6% of ICUs did not alter the visiting policy; 49% extended visiting hours; 44% increased the number of slots; and 53% allowed more visitors. A gowning procedure was compulsory for visitors in 95.3% of ICUs. No waiting room was provided by 25.4% of ICUs. Conclusions This is the first survey on visiting policies in Italian ICUs. Despite the widely-held conviction that there is no sound scientific basis for restricting visitors in ICUs [1-3], our findings show a clear tendency in Italian ICUs to apply restricted visiting policies (concerning visiting hours, number and type of visitors), which are only partially liberalized when the patient is dying. Our survey could contribute towards modifying current policies in favour of opening ICUs that are still 'closed' and promoting more appropriate and attentive care for the patient and his/her family. Benchmarking has been an essential part of intensive care medicine in Finland since 1994. At present, web-based quality/performance reports are shared with the 24 members of the Finnish Intensive Care Quality Consortium (FICQC). Thirteen ICUs collect FICQC data manually and 11 ICUs utilize data collection software (IVT) integrated with the Clinical Information System (CIS). In recent literature, the completeness of data between centralized medical benchmarking registries varies widely [1,2]. We hypothesized that: (1) the completeness of data in FICQC has Critical Care March 2007 Vol 11 Suppl 2 27th International Symposium on Intensive Care and Emergency Medicine Figure 1 (abstract P500) S199 increased over the years and (2) the variation between the different units still exists.

            "text": "Acute renal failure in obstetrics: risk factors and outcome Z Introduction Acute renal failure (ARF) was newly recognized as a specific mortality risk factor [1] and is in general associated with a high mortality rate. Hypothesis Identifying risk factors for ARF could help reduce mortality. We shall try to describe them in critically ill obstetric patients, and explain ARF association with multiple organ failure (MOF) and outcome using the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score and Logistic Organ Dysfunction (LOD) score. Methods An open prospective observational cohort study in a multidisciplinary ICU. All critically ill obstetric patients were analysed unless diagnosed with chronic renal failure or kidney transplant. ARF was defined as serum creatinine \u2265 100 \u00b5mol/l and/or urine output \u2264 500 ml/day and/or doubling of baseline serum creatinine levels. Results Six hundred and forty patients were reviewed (mortality rate 13.3%). ARF was diagnosed in 223 patients. Main risk factors present at admission were: acute circulatory failure, transfusion and association with haemolysis elevated liver enzyme and low platelet count (HELLP) syndrome. ARF patients with HELLP syndrome on admission were most likely to develop and alter multiple organ dysfunctions/failures. ARF is associated with an elevated relative risk of mortality (x1.5). Anuria and a serum creatinine level > 300 \u00b5mol/l were independent risk factors for mortality (OR 2 and 7, respectively). The ICU mortality of ARF patients increased with the number of failing organs on admission, especially persistent circulatory failure over time. The LOD score is at least as good as the SOFA score in evaluating the association MOF-ARF with mortality. In fact, LOD cutoff values defining cardiovascular, respiratory hepatic and hematologic organ failures fit particularly our obstetric population. Conclusions Most important risk factors for ARF or mortality are often present on admission. During the ICU stay, other organ failures (especially cardiovascular) are important risk factors to develop or alter renal function, especially persistence of circulatory shock; thus, aggressive fluid challenge and volume infusion policy could help ARF prevention. HELLP syndrome and ARF is a particularly morbid association because of accumulating organ failures. ",

Recurrence rates of pancreatitis in patients with biliary lithiasis are compared in operated and nonoperated patients. Recurrences in patients with suspected nonbiliary pancreatitis are also reported. Methods First episodes of acute pancreatitis were identified in consecutive emergency department patients over a 2-year period. Data were evaluated retrospectively and then the identified patients were then followed prospectively for 2 years more. Results Pancreatitis was defined clinically as constant epigastric pain associated with elevation of the serum lipase to greater than three times the upper reference value (177 U/l) and no other identified cause of abdominal pain. Of 356 patients with first episodes of acute pancreatitis, 259 had pancreatitis that was ultimately associated with biliary lithiasis based on abdominal ultrasound (n = 236), positive endoscopic retrograde pancreotography (n = 11), surgical pathology report (n = 11), or cholecystostomy (n = 1). Ninety-seven patients had no identified stones during the study period. Cholecystectomy was performed in 235/259 at the time of admission for pancreatitis. Reasons for nonoperative management were death (three cases), medical contraindications (15 cases), pregnancy (two cases) and delayed diagnosis due to negative abdominal sonogram (four cases). During the study period 10% (10/97) of patients without demonstrated stones returned with recurrent episodes of pancreatitis. There were two recurrences in 235 operated patients with stones (0.85%). Twelve of 19 nonoperated survivors with biliary lithiasis returned with complications of biliary lithiasis, including 10 recurrences of biliary pancreatitis (53%) and two episodes of common bile duct obstruction, one of which resulted in death from cholangitis. The median time to recurrence of pancreatitis in nonoperated patients with stones was 50 days, range 26-581 days. Conclusion Cholecystectomy reduced the incidence of recurrence of pancreatitis in patients with biliary lithiasis. Introduction Replacement of albumin in hypoalbuminemic patients is not proven to reduce postoperative morbidity and mortality but no broad consensus is reached yet on abandoning the use of albumin in intensive care and perioperative settings for the bad prognostic value of hypoalbuminemia. As the albumin decrease in major surgery is mostly due to extravascular leakage of albumin (systemic inflammatory response), we regard hypoalbuminemia just as a marker of inflammatory response to surgery that albumin replacement cannot change. So the postoperative morbidity, mortality and length of stay would not differ in patients without albumin replacement. Materials and methods We retrospectively studied 76 successive patients operated on in the abdomen at the Oncologic Institute in Ljubljana in 1997/98 (group 1 -postoperative hypoalbuminemia treated with 20% albumin solution) and in 2000/01 (group 2 -no albumin treatment), because of abandoning albumin use in our surgical department. We compared serum albumin concentrations in the first week after surgery (three values) as well as the postoperative complication rate and the length of hospital stay. We looked for correlation between the postoperative albumin concentration and the duration of surgery, amount of transfusion and amount of infusion during surgery. Results The two groups of 38 patients were comparable in age (52.4 and 56.5 years), ASA physical status (1.9 and 2.0), preoperative albumin concentration (39.0 and 38.1 g/l), duration of operation (5.9 and 6.1 hours), transfused red blood cells (3.3 and 2.0 l) and crystalloid infusion during surgery (5.3 and 4.5 l). In both groups there was very significant drop of albumin concentration in the first week after surgery (P < 0.001). In group 2 albumin concentrations were very significantly lower than in group 1 until the fifth postoperative day (P < 0.001). The difference diminished after the sixth postoperative day (P < 0.03). There was negative correlation between the postoperative albumin concentration and the duration of surgery (r = -0.44, P < 0.008). We found no difference in the postoperative complication rate (surgical or medical), length of stay and mortality between the groups. Conclusion Postoperative serum albumin concentrations were reduced in both groups, but more in group 2 with no albumin treatment, and in longer operations. Morbidity, mortality and length of stay were not influenced by albumin replacement.Introduction Sedation is a major problem in long-stay intensive care patients despite use of sedation stops and scores. We hypothesized that the \u03b1 2 -adrenoceptor agonist dexmedetomidine (DEX) is at least equivalent to standard-of-care sedation (SOC), and may reduce the length of ICU stay and improve other clinically relevant outcomes. Methods We performed a pilot (n = 85), phase III, multicenter, prospective, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, active comparator (SOC: either propofol or midazolam) study to define the feasibility and size of a pivotal trial. Patients with expected ICU stays \u226548 hours and a need for sedation for at least 24 hours after randomization were included within the first 72 hours of ICU stay. The maximum duration of study sedation was 14 days, with a 45day follow-up from randomization. Sedation was Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale (RASS)-score targeted, with daily sedation stops. Results Forty-one patients received DEX and 44 SOC (28 propofol). The goal was moderate (RASS 0 to -3) sedation in most patients (78% in DEX and 80% in SOC). Patients were at the target RASS 55% (DEX) and 57% (SOC) of the sedation time (not significant): for RASS target 0 to -3, 68% (DEX) and 64% (SOC) of the time (not significant) and for RASS target -4, 31% (DEX) and 63% (SOC), respectively (P = 0.006). Median time from admission/randomization to ICU discharge was similar (DEX 6.6/5.7 days, SOC 6.7/5.5 days, not significant). Mechanical ventilation was shorter for DEX with RASS target 0 to -3 (DEX 70.2 hours, SOC 92.5 hours, P = 0.027), and patients' ability to communicate (multidimensional visual analog scale) was better with DEX (P < 0.001). Occurrence rates and number of patients with overall and serious adverse events were similar. Conclusion DEX is well tolerated and comparable with SOC in long-term sedation, but not suitable as the sole agent for deep sedation. DEX enhances the patient's ability to communicate. Its effects on relevant outcomes (for example, duration of mechanical ventilation) should be tested in a large randomized controlled trial.",

Methods Sixty-eight ventilated brain trauma patients (mean Glasgow Coma Scale: 5 \u00b1 3) with controlled invasive ventilation during 6.4 (\u00b1 4) days were prospectively randomized into two groups (G1 n = 32; G2 n = 36) using different sedation protocols to reach a mean hourly Ramsay Score of 4. Sedation in G1 was based on morphine (0.1 \u00b1 0.1 mg/kg/hour) and midazolam (0.4 \u00b1 0.4 mg/kg/hour); in G2 on remifentanil (0.25 \u00b1 0.25 \u00b5g/kg/min), magnesium (0.08 g/kg/day), ketamine (0.15 \u00b1 0.15 \u00b5g/kg/min), clonidine (0.001 \u00b1 0.001 \u00b5g/kg/min) and propofol (2 \u00b1 1.5 mg/kg/ hour). The cerebral parameters (mean intracranial continuous pressure (mICP); mean cerebral perfusion pressure (mCPP)) and the needs of norepinephrine (Ne) were evaluated hourly. Preloading was adapted by a continuous central venous pressure measurement before Ne adaptation requirements to keep the mCPP over 60 mmHg. For statistical analysis a Shapiro-Wilk test, a Wilcox test and a Student t test were used. Results Demographic data (age, gender, trauma severity score) were comparable in both groups. The waking time was significantly shorter in G2 (5 \u00b1 8 min) compared with G1 (35 \u00b1 20 min) (P < 0.05). The mICP was more stable in G2 (9 \u00b1 4 mmHg) compared with G1 (10 \u00b1 9 mmHg) (P = 0.02). The mCPP were comparable in G1 (62 \u00b1 10 mmHg) and in G2 (63 \u00b1 0.2 mmHg) but with a 24% swing in dose requirement adaptation of Ne in G1 compared with a 6% daily swing in G2 (P < 0.02). Conclusion By using a multimodal short-acting sedation protocol based on remifentanil and NMDA-antagonist receptors we were able to provide adequate sedation in brain trauma patients. Neurological parameters were respected with this regimen, avoiding the risk of secondary patient hemodynamic destabilisation during the waking periods. Introduction Inhalational ICU sedation is increasingly applied since the introduction of AnaConDa \u00ae (Sedana Medical, Sweden). This anaesthetic-conserving device (ACD) retains exhaled sevofluorane (SEV) and resupplies it during inspiration [1] . A syringe pump delivers liquid SEV into the device. Since January 2004 we have used the ACD as a standard practice. Our patients anaesthetised with SEV in the OR and scheduled for ICU sedation with SEV only need propofol on transport. Could this be avoided when using the ACD during transport? Methods Forty-one patients after major abdominal surgery were included in this quality assurance project. In 20 patients the ACD was inserted into the anaesthesia circuit to take up warmth, humidity and SEV for 15 minutes and used for transport. SEV infusion was started in the ICU after gas monitoring. Twenty-one patients scheduled for propofol sedation served as controls. During transport all patients were ventilated with Oxylog2000 (Dr\u00e4ger, Germany), vital parameters were monitored, and the Ramsay Score (RS) was assessed at five time points. If necessary, propofol injections of 0.5 mg/kg were given. Statistics were t test for parametric data (mean \u00b1 standard deviation), U test for nonparametric data (median (interquartile range)), SPSS 11.04. Results The age, weight, duration of anaesthesia (ACD/controls 7.3 \u00b1 2.0/6.3 \u00b1 2.2 hours), total sufentanil (124 \u00b1 75/118 \u00b1 57 \u00b5g) and transport time (16.3 \u00b1 2.7/17.0 \u00b1 2.7 min) were not different between groups, and neither were heart rates, mean arterial pressures and RS at five time points during transport. ACD patients needed less propofol injections (0 (0-1)/3 (2-4), P < 0.001) Results Groups (SSP: n = 106; SP: n = 108, KMP: n = 101) did not differ in preoperative data (for example, biometry, cardiac and coronary profile and risk). Intraoperative management was comparable among groups. Tropinin T levels were rather lower in the KMP group, but did not differ significantly between groups at 24 hours after aortic unclamping. Cardiovascular adverse events showed the same low incidence in all groups. Hemodynamic data were comparable; however, the heart rate (HR) and mean arterial pressure (MAP) after induction were significantly higher in the KMP group (HR: 59 \u00b1 11 vs 63 \u00b1 32 vs 66 \u00b1 13 beats/min (P < 0.01); MAP: 74 \u00b1 12 vs 81 \u00b1 16 vs 83 \u00b1 16 mmHg (P < 0.01)). Conclusion In our study, KMP anesthesia was safe to use for CABGS. In comparison with SSP and SP anesthesia, no significant rise in troponin T as a marker of myocardial damage was observed. All three regimens resulted in stable hemodynamics. However, the use of S-(+)-ketamine as an induction agent in patients with coronary artery disease may be limited due to its sympathomimetic effects leading to raised HR and MAP, even if supplemented by midazolam or propofol. Introduction Computer management systems and treatment protocols (CMS/P) have been recommended for their potential to improve patient safety and outcome. Computer management systems require substantial investments in the ICUs. In return, a high-quality, standardised ICU treatment with software-implemented protocols as well as decreased hand-written documentation has been aimed at. The objective of this study was to systematically review the literature on CMS/P to evaluate their impact on outcome benefit. Methods A Medline search from 1996 to 2006 with the following key words was performed: critical care or intensive care, and protocol, and data management system or computer management system or computerized documentation. Results The search revealed 21 potential articles. The language was English in 18 of the articles, two in German and one in Japanese. Of those 21, 10 articles were not studying CMS/P. Of those 11 that fulfilled the criteria, computer management systems were studied in four articles and treatment protocols in 11 articles. The combination of ICU treatment protocol and computer management system was studied in four of the 21 articles. Of those 11, three of the studies demonstrated that the implementation of a protocol to computer management system increases staff compliance to the protocol. The newer studies showed also that the costs were not increased by the computerised protocol. However, no definite benefit in patient survival or ICU length of stay could be demonstrated (11 of 21 studies). The combined absolute reduction rate in hospital mortality was 2% (95% CI 0-4%) in those four (19% of 21) studies. CMS/P increased the ICU length of stay 3.5 days (95% CI 1.6-5.4 days) and decreased the hospital length of stay 5.9 days (95% CI 1.0-10.8 days), in two different studies. Conclusion Our results could not confirm any definite benefit from computerised data management systems or treatment protocols regarding outcome. The ICU personnel adherence to treatment protocols seems to increase when implemented into the computerised data management systems. Further research on this topic is needed to justify the investments in computer management systems. Introduction Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in critically ill patients. We implemented a performance improvement project over 2 years to reduce VAP incidence in the medical ICU (MICU) and surgical ICU (SICU). Methods From 1 January 2004 to 31 December 2005 a prospective intervention was undertaken. Results were compared with historic controls (2003) . In year 1 we introduced aggressive oral care using chlorhexidine mouthwash, an early extubation strategy, changing respiratory equipment only when visibly soiled or malfunctioning, and aggressive enforcement of hand-washing and barrier protection methods. At the end of year 1 we augmented the project with the addition of the FAST-HUG (feeding, analgesia, sedation, thromboembolic prevention, head of bed elevation, ulcer prophylaxis, and glucose control) evaluation. During year 2 FAST-HUG was emphasized daily on patient rounds by the intensivists. The CDC VAP definition was used; the Friedman test and Wilcoxon signed ranks test were used for data analysis. Results The VAP rates in the MICU and SICU for the control period, 1 January-31 December 2003, were 13.41 and 19.37 VAPs/1,000 ventilator-days, respectively. The MICU VAP rate declined to 3.02 VAPs/1,000 ventilator-days and the SICU rate declined to 8.16 VAPs/1,000 ventilator-days over 2 years. The greatest declines occurred during year 2 ( Table 1) . Introduction Although carpertide, a synthetic \u03b1-human atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), reduces ischemia/reperfusion (I/R)induced tissue injury, the precise therapeutic mechanism(s) remains to be elucidated. Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) released from sensory neurons reduces I/R-induced liver injury by inhibiting neutrophil activation through an increase in the endothelial production of prostacyclin (PGI 2 ). In the present study, we examined in rats whether ANP reduces I/R-induced renal injury by enhancing sensory neuron activation. Methods The right renal vessels were clamped in rats for 45 minutes after left nephrectomy. ANP (0.3 \u00b5g/kg/min) was continuously infused from 30 minutes before ischemia to 60 minutes after reperfusion. We attempted to determine whether ANP promotes CGRP release from cultured dorsal root ganglion neurons isolated from adult rats in vitro.",

ANP inhibited I/R-induced increases in renal tissue levels of TNF and myeloperoxidase at 3 and 6 hours after reperfusion, respectively. ANP significantly enhanced I/R-induced increases in renal tissue levels of CGRP and 6-keto-PGF 1\u03b1 , a stable metabolite of PGI 2 , at 1 hour after reperfusion. ANP-induced increases in renal tissue levels of CGRP were significantly inhibited by pretreatment with SB366791, a specific vanilloid receptor-1 antagonist. ANP-induced increases in renal tissue levels of 6-keto-PGF 1\u03b1 were significantly inhibited by pretreatment with SB366791, CGRP(8-37), a CGRP receptor antagonist, and indomethacin. Reduction of I/R-induced increases in serum levels of blood urea nitrogen and creatinine and those in renal tissue levels of TNF and myeloperoxidase in rats treated with ANP were completely abrogated by pretreatment with SB366791, CGRP(8-37), and indomethacin. ANP significantly increased CGRP release from dorsal root ganglion neurons in vitro.Conclusions These results strongly suggested that ANP might reduce I/R-induced renal injury in rats by inhibiting neutrophil activation through enhancement of sensory neuron activation. Introduction Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) is a strong predictor of outcome in patients with heart failure, various other cardiovascular diseases and in patients with systemic inflammatory response syndrome and sepsis. Furthermore, ANP is elevated in patients with kidney disease. We aimed to test the prognostic potency of the precursor molecule mid-regional pro-atrial natriuretic peptide (MR-pro-ANP) in an unselected cohort of critically ill patients.Methods Between August 2004 and February 2006, a total of 294 patients (191 males, age 63.8 \u00b1 14.7 years) admitted to our ICU were studied. The mean SAPS2 and APACHE II score were 52 \u00b1 23 and 24 \u00b1 11, respectively. Two hundred and three patients (69.1%) were on intravenous inotropic support, 30 patients had additional mechanical circulatory support (23 intraaortic balloon counterpulsation (7.8%), eight extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (2.7%), three left ventricular assist device (0.9%)). Two hundred and five patients (69.7%) were mechanically ventilated, and 59 patients (20.1%) presented with acute renal failure. Plasma samples for determination of MR-pro-ANP were obtained on admission in all patients. As MR-pro-ANP values were not normally distributed, log MR-pro-ANP values were used for analysis.Results Two hundred and thirty-five patients (79.9%) survived to ICU discharge and 59 patients died (21.1%). Log MR-pro-ANP plasma levels were significantly higher in patients who died than in ICU survivors (2.76 \u00b1 0.39 pmol/l vs 2.50 \u00b1 0.38 pmol/l, respectively, P < 0.0001). In the Kaplan-Meier analysis of 28-day survival, patients with log MR-pro-ANP plasma-levels above the median had significantly lower survival rates compared with patients with log MR-pro-ANP plasma levels below the median (P = 0.02). Conclusion Our data show that elevated plasma levels of MR-pro-ANP at ICU admission are associated with an adverse outcome in an unselected cohort of critically ill patients.",

The use of a patient's MEWS score to predict outcome in a high-dependency unit (HDU) has not been previously described.Method Approval for the study was granted by the local ethics committee. We reviewed MEWS scores from all patients (n = 2,974) admitted to a six-bed medical and surgical adult HDU in a general hospital from July 2002 to October 2005. The MEWS score was calculated from observations of heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, urine output, conscious level and temperature recorded within 24 hours of admission to the HDU. Results Of the 2,974 patients reviewed, 2,447 patients had sufficient data. Analysis using logistic regression shows a strong relationship between the probability of death and the MEWS score: the odds of death increase by 1.48 (confidence interval 1.41-1.56; P < 0.001) for each unit increase in the MEWS score. However, there is no reason that these data should follow a logistic form and the estimates of uncertainty around the point estimates from logistic regression are poor. More accurate estimates of the death rate for each of the MEWS scores were achieved using a 'bootstrapping' technique (repeated sampling, with replacement, from the dataset) 1,000 times (see Figure 1 ). The median death rate (%) for each MEWS score was: 3 = 1.5%; 4 = 0.7%; 5 = 2.2%; 6 = 3.0%; 7 = 3.0%; 8 = 5.6%; 9 = 9.7%; 10 = 13.3%; 11 = Critical Care March 2007 Vol 11 Suppl 2 27th International Symposium on Intensive Care and Emergency Medicine ",

Local research experience suggests that existing measures may fail to capture the broad spectrum of morbidity that survivors experience. The purpose of this research is to explore, through predominantly qualitative methods, critical-illness mediated morbidity among survivors of prolonged critical illness; a group in whom this type of morbidity appears to be most prevalent. An important secondary aim is to explore the contribution of the processes of rehabilitation and recovery to perceptions of HRQoL. Methods Survivors who experienced prolonged critical illness (defined as \u226514 days mechanical ventilation) were identified from the Scottish Intensive Care Society Audit Group (SICSAG) database, Wardwatcher \u00ae . Participants were contacted \u22646 months following ICU discharge, and were invited to complete professionally recommended quality-of-life questionnaires (the Short Form 36 and EuroQol-5D) and to participate in a semistructured interview. Interviews explored everyday experiences of ongoing morbidity and were analysed with regard to their correlation with the domains and scores of the HRQoL questionnaires. Purposive sampling provided clinically important insights into experiences and perceptions of health and pre-existing morbidity and, importantly, the processes of rehabilitation and recovery; that is, through comparison of (i) patients with/without appreciable pre-existing disease and (ii) patients receiving ward-based rehabilitation with those who receive formalised rehabilitation in dedicated facilities. Preliminary results Ten of the required 40 interviewees have so far been recruited. Preliminary analysis confirms that survivors experience a range of morbidity not well captured by professionally recommended measures, and that pre-existing disease is an important factor in both coping with new morbidity superimposed by critical illness, and in marshalling support. The process of rehabilitation appears to have important effects on perceptions of recovery, self-management strategies, and perceptions of HRQoL. Conclusions This qualitative enquiry has already provided, and will continue to provide, new and clinically relevant insights into patients' experiences of morbidity, the processes of rehabilitation, recovery and perceived HRQoL following discharge into the community.",

Patients admitted to the ICU for >48 hours were included. Close relatives completed the Short-form 36 (SF-36) within the first 48 hours of admission to assess the premorbid HRQOL of the patient. Mortality was evaluated from ICU admittance until 6 months after ICU discharge. Logistic regression and ROC analysis were used to assess the predictive value for mortality of the first general health question of the SF-36 ('in general would you say the health of your relative is excellent, very good, good, fair or poor'), as well as HRQOL measured by the complete SF-36. The Acute Physiologic and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score was used as an accepted mortality prediction model in ICU patients. Three models were constructed including the HRQOL (model A), APACHE II score (model B), or both (model C) to age and gender. Percentages of correct survival/death predictions were calculated. Results Four hundred and fifty-one patients were included at admission to the ICU. At 6 months follow-up, 159 patients had died and 40 patients were lost to follow-up. When the general health item was used as an estimate of HRQOL, the area under the curve (AUC) for model A (0.719) was comparable with model B (0.721), and slightly better in model C (0.760). The percentage of wrong predictions was lower in model C (survival 27%; death 37%) compared with model A (30% and 41%). Similar results were found when using the complete SF-36.Conclusions This study shows that the pre-admission HRQOL measured with either the one-item general health question or the complete SF-36 are as good in predicting survival/mortality in ICU patients as the APACHE II score and improves prediction slightly when combined. As the one-item general health question is easily and quickly obtained, assessment of HRQOL before admission to the ICU may facilitate the decision process in determining which patients will benefit from ICU treatment.

They selfconsidered around grade 6 for cognitive aspects, procedural skills and competence and near grade 8 for communication and relationship (see Figure 1 ). Cardiopulmonary resuscitation, mechanical ventilation, haemodynamics and neurointensivism are the most desirable subjects. Conclusions Doctors are mainly from the fourth decade, want to improve their qualification, and are usually working in ICUs. The low number of specialists who works in ICU is a reality and there is a need to expand it. The self-evaluation points to problems with knowledge and ability; however, communications and relationships were well adjusted. The diversity of data will assist the AMIB to provide continuous education and qualify doctors to attend the demand of intensivists in Brazil. Introduction In this study we created a database to analyse the incidence and types of critical incidents that occurred during the interhospital transfer of critically ill patients. The transfer of critically ill patients presents important risks and the safety of patients has been shown to be facilitated by the development of standard equipment and specialist teams [1] . The West of Scotland Shock team is a designated regional transfer service based in Glasgow. We are involved in the interhospital transfer of patients and not primary retrieval. A recent study looking at critical incidents during the intrahospital transport of the critically ill highlighted the risks posed, and recommended the monitoring of incidents in order to aid the continuous improvement in patient safety [2] . No similar study has been carried out looking at the interhospital transport of the critically ill patient. Methods The study was a cross-sectional analysis of critical incidents occurring during interhospital transport that were reported to the West of Scotland Shock Team critical incident database set up in September 2005. The information obtained was categorised into: (a) where the incident took place, (b) type of incident, (c) written description of events, (d) outcome (potential or actual harm to the patient) and (e) designation of the staff member reporting the incident. Results A total of 199 transfers were performed over the 6-month period. Thirty-four critical incidents were reported. Twenty-four (70%) incidents took place before, seven (21%) during and three (9%) after transfer. No patients sustained actual harm, 29 (85%) were perceived by the reporter to have suffered potential harm and the most common cause of this were delays in the transfer. No potential or actual harm was perceived in five (15%) of the incidents. Fifty-three per cent of events were reported by senior house officer grade and 47% of incidents were reported by a specialist registrar. Only one incident was reported by a nurse on the team. Conclusions Interhospital transport of critically ill patients can pose important risks. In our study no actual patient harm occurred although most incidents had the potential to cause harm. The majority of incidents were caused by system-based factors. This database has allowed us to perform continuous service development and education of staff. them had previous cardiac disease. All three had disturbances in cardiac rhythm closely related to the occurrence of cerebral death. Two of these three patients also developed neurogenic pulmonary edema. We speculate that in all five patients the instability leading to the decision not to perform heart and lung donation was caused by excessive sympathic stimulation at the time of cerebral death leading to impaired myocardial function and neurogenic pulmonary edema. These disturbances may be reversible within a few hours. Inotropic therapy, judicious fluid administration guided by close hemodynamic monitoring together with a trial of treatment with triple hormonal therapy (corticosteroid, vasopressin and thyroid hormone) might have improved cardiac and pulmonary function, rendering heart and lung donation possible. Conclusion On the basis of this retrospective study we conclude that donor management in our ICU can be improved. A management protocol with special attention for treatment of disturbance in cardiac and pulmonary function caused by sympathic overstimulation might considerably increase the amount of hearts and lungs donated, contributing to a decrease in organ shortage. practices have been offered more frequently in Latin American pediatric intensive care units (PICUs). We hypothesize that, depending on the Brazilian region, the incidence of LSL and the medical management may differ. Objective To evaluate the incidence of LSL practices and the medical management during the last 48 hours of life of children admitted to seven PICUs located in regions of Brazil. Methods A multicenter, observational and retrospective chart review study. The medical chart of all deaths occurring between January 2003 and December 2004 in seven Brazilian PICUs located in Porto Alegre (two), Sao Paulo (two) and Salvador (three) were evaluated. Two pediatric intensive care residents of each service filled a standard protocol searching for: demographic data, mode of death (full reanimation, nonreanimation orders or withdrawn treatment) and medical management during the last 48 hours of life. Student's t test, analysis of variance, chi-square test and relative risk were used for comparing the data. Results There were 561 deaths, 36 being excluded that died with less than 24 hours, 61 with brain death and 36 missing charts. Full cardiopulmonary reanimation was offered to 56.5%, with differences between the northeast and southeast regions (P < 0.001). Higher age (P = 0.02) and long length of PICU stay were associated with nonreanimation orders. The plan for LSL was recorded in a clear manner in just 52.7%. No respiratory support was observed in 14 dying children. For 66% patients with do-notresuscitate orders the inotrope drugs were maintained or increased in the last 48 hours. Conclusions The incidence of LSV has increased among the Brazilian PICUs with a difference between the regions. The nonreanimation order is still the most common practice with scarce initiative for withdrawn life support. Introduction As the numbers of people admitted to ICUs are increasing, physicians are faced with obligations beyond attempting to reverse illness and include providing quality end-oflife care. Barriers to this include inadequate understanding of the dying patient and withdrawal or limitation of care. The objectives of this study were to document the comprehensions of physicians and nurses dealing with these situations. Methods We carried out a cross-sectional survey of clinicians working at three hospitals in Karachi (one private, university hospital, one mixed public and private, tertiary care hospital and one large government-funded hospital). A 13-question instrument was developed to assess recognition of end-of-life in the ICU, knowledge of commonly used terms to describe limitations of care, and attitudes and practices towards withdrawal and limitation of life-support measures and organ harvest for transplantation. After measuring the frequencies for presentation of the data, differences between the three respondent subgroups were compared using a chi-square analysis. Fisher's exact test was used where the individual cell count was <5. A one-way analysis of variance was used to compare differences in age and years of practice. A twosided P value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results A total of 137 physicians and critical care nurses completed the survey. The average age was 34 years and 58% were males. 'Brain death' was defined as an 'irreversible cessation of brainstem function' by 85% of respondents; 77% relying on clinical examination, 49.6% consulting neurophysicians and 28.3% ordering further testing to confirm the diagnosis. Withdrawal of life support is practiced by 83.2%; most frequently in the setting of absent brainstem and cortical functioning (74.3%), followed by acute, progressive multiorgan failure (39.8%). Physicians are more likely (P value 0.000) to withdraw mechanical ventilation, compared with nurses who would withdraw vasopressors (P value 0.006). The primary physician is the most frequent caregiver (60.2%) to start a discussion on withdrawal of life support, with 72.6% respondents consulting the Hospital Ethics Committee. Only 13.3% respondents never withdraw life support; 28.3% considered it their responsibility to 'sustain life at all costs' and only 8% gave religious beliefs as a reason. Only 56.6% favored organ harvest for transplantation from cadavers, while 64.6% supported harvest from brain dead individuals. Nurses were significantly more likely to support organ harvest for transplant from heart-beating, brain dead individuals (P value 0.025) than cadavers (P value 0.000). Conclusion There are deficiencies and disparities in the understandings of physicians and nurses on the recognition and management of end-of-life in the ICU.",
