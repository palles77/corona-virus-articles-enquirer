In 151 the tri-hexamer interface, three sets of CA CTD residues E212 and E213 from three adjacent 152 symmetry-related monomers form the floor of this negatively charged well. MxB binding to 153 CA E213A was significantly reduced, and CA E212A/E213A drastically reduced binding to the 154 background level (Fig 2C and 2D ).

MxB 1-187 35 -MBPdi binding to CA G208R was indistinguishable from the MxB 1-35-AAA -MBPdi background 188 signal. Binding to CA T210K was also substantially reduced. By neutralizing the strong negative 189 charge at the tri-hexamer interface, these mutations likely disrupt charge-charge interactions that 190 are required for MxB binding. It is also possible that the bulkiness of these residues occludes the 191 well at the tri-hexamer interface and sterically blocks MxB access. The relatively modest 192 mutation P207S had a minor effect on MxB interaction ( Fig 3B) . These data lend strong support 193 to our mapping results that identify the MxB targeting site to the tri-hexamer interface on capsid.

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/444067 doi: bioRxiv preprint 233 Results from our MD analysis show that MxB 1-35 binds persistently in the tri-hexamer 234 region throughout the entirety of the simulation, with extensive molecular contacts between MxB 235 N-terminal region and CA residues (Table 2) . Importantly, CA residues in the tri-hexamer 236 interface, E71, E75 and E213, interact with the 11 RRR 13 motif of MxB with high occupancies (Fig   237 4D and Table 2 ), which is in good agreement with our co-pelleting assay data (Fig 2C and 2D ). In 238 fact, there is a remarkable agreement between the MD results with the experimental binding data 239 obtained independently. For example, contacts between E212 and the MxB N-terminus were 240 observed less frequently, which is consistent with the experimental finding that the E212A 241 mutation has a smaller disruption of MxB binding than other glutamate mutations do at the tri-242 hexamer interface ( Fig 2D) . Moreover, we observe CA residues T210, G208, and P207 243 interacting with the 11 RRR 13 motif of MxB, which accounts for the importance of these sites in 244 MxB binding ( Fig 3B) and sensitivity [9] . In addition, we found contacts between CA and 245 residues outside of the 11 RRR 13 motif ( Table 2, The MxB-binding pocket revealed by the simulation is primarily formed by key CA 253 residues located in adjacent CA hexamers (Table 2 and Fig 4D and SI Appendix 3) . The MxB 254 11 RRR 13 motif is anchored to the bottom of the pocket, primarily interacting with the negatively-255 charged CA E213 residues, while the rest of the MxB 1-35 peptide exhibits significantly higher 256 flexibility (Fig 4D and SI Video 1) . This observation is supported by the experimental finding 257 that the E213A mutation shows the largest effect on MxB binding ( Fig 2D) . Notably, the 258 significant difference in effect between E212A and E213A on MxB binding is consistent 259 experimentally and computationally. This is likely due to their relative positions at the interface: 260 E213 is closer to the 3-fold symmetry axis (Fig 2b) and other E213 residues from adjacent 261 hexamers, such that MxB can bind E213 from multiple CA monomers simultaneously ( Fig 4D) .

Consistently, we found that the tri-303 hexamer interface mutations that escape MxB restriction, G208R and T210K, also significantly 304 disrupted the binding of MxB, likely due to a combined result of steric clash and charge repulsion 305 with the 11 RRR 13 motif. In contrast, mutations in the di-hexamer interface and around the CypA-306 binding loop on the hexamer surface had little effect on MxB binding. Our structural studies 307 showed these mutations had no apparent effect on the structure of CA lattice assemblies, 308 supporting that the mutagenesis results revealed a direct binding of MxB at the tri-hexamer 309 interface.",

Notably, it has been reported that the mutation E213A leads to 313 decreased infectivity in cellular assays, and while Gag processing and viral cores appear normal, 314 the core remains stable longer than wild-type upon entry into the target cell [31]. This is 315 consistent with our observation during protein purification that E213A appeared to produce more 316 stable CA assemblies and prone to precipitation. Viruses containing the CA mutations E71A and 317 E180A had reduced infectivity relative to wild-type [32, 33] . The latter suggests that these two 318 mutations are not tolerated well by the virus, and perhaps coping with MxB restriction is a lower-319 cost measure than evolving resistance. 320 Our all-atom molecular dynamics simulations identified the same important tri-hexamer 321 interface independent of the experimental biochemistry. In the simulation, the bound MxB 322 peptide interacts with many CA residues that were tested biochemically to be critical for MxB 323 interaction (E71, E75, E212 and E213) and shown to be functionally important for MxB 324 sensitivity (P207, G208, and T210). The extensive contacts between the MxB peptide and CA 325 residues illustrate where and how MxB targets the CA lattice.

We defined the HIV-1 capsid site recognized by the MxB 11 RRR 13 motif to be 349 the interface between three CA hexamers. This represents a residue-level mapping of a HIV-1 350 capsid lattice-sensing restriction factor. Further work is needed to structurally characterize the 351 interaction of MxB N-terminus and its interaction with CA. In addition, a better understanding of 352 the binding affinity and behavior of the MxB oligomer will shed more light on its restriction.

The model is composed of three dimers from adjacent CA hexamers, a 229 structural motif commonly referred as a trimer-of-dimers. Subsequently, the model was subjected 230 to thirty microseconds of all-atom MD simulation without any experimental restraints (SI Video 231 1).

Our secondary structure 264 analysis(Fig 4B)shows that while the bound MxB 1-35 still contains large disordered areas, the 265 region near 11 RRR 13 motif maintains a stable conformation during the simulation (SI Video 1), 266 which further supports the importance of the 11 RRR 13 motif in MxB-capsid interaction.267In addition, the MD simulation provides insight into the structure of the MxB 1-35 upon 268 binding to capsid and its influence on the ionic environment. The simulation shows that binding 269 of MxB 1-35 in the tri-hexamer interface decreases the sodium ion occupancies in the CA lattice.270 Based on the trajectory analysis, when the MxB N-terminal region occupies one of the three 271 grooves between hexamers at the tri-hexamer interface, the calculated occupancy of sodium ions 272 in the groove proximal to the bound region are lower than corresponding regions in the other two 273 unoccupied grooves (SI Appendix 4). On the other hand, the chloride ion occupancy does not 274 show appreciable difference in three grooves. Together with the high-occupancy molecular between the positively charged 11 RRR 13 and the CA glutamates in the tri-hexamer 276 region, these data agree with the experimental observation that MxB binding is salt-dependent, 277 the interaction may lead to displacement of sodium ions at both the binding interface a potent restriction factor of HIV-1 infection. It restricts the nuclear important 282 step of the viral life cycle. The inhibition requires an interaction with the HIV-1 capsid. Previous 283 studies suggested that MxB recognized features present only in assembled capsid: interfaces 284 between CA hexamers forming a lattice. Despite extensive work to identify CA mutations which 285 affect MxB activity [5-7, 9, 11, 13, 18, 28], the interaction site and mechanism of interaction 286 remain unclear. While cellular assays are efficient ways to identify mutations, they often fall short 287 of disentangling the pleomorphic effects of CA mutations, where a functional defect in MxB 288 sensitivity may not be directly related to MxB binding to capsid. Instead, it could be due to 289 altered capsid stability or affecting other cellular factors that are also important in the MxB 290 restriction pathway. Our biochemical and biophysical experimental system provides a stringent 291 test to identify and verify mutations that have a direct effect on the MxB-capsid interaction. 292 Combined with all-atom molecular dynamic simulations, our results demonstrate the molecular 293 basis of how capsid mutations evade MxB restriction and provide insight into how MxB 294 recognizes the capsid (Fig 5A). 295 Our results paint a clear picture of MxB targeting HIV capsid at the interface between 296 CA hexamers. To map the site of the MxB-capsid interaction, we performed systematic alanine 297 scanning guided by an analysis of the electrostatic surface of the CA lattice, as well as previously 298 reported MxB-escape mutations [9, 29, 30]. Mutations of the negatively charge residues 299 surrounding the 3-fold axis on capsid, including E71/E75/E212/E213, had substantial deleterious 300 effect on MxB interaction. These residues line a negatively charge well at the tri-hexamer",

In the lentiviral family, available structures of Equine Infectious Anemia Virus (EIAV) 341 and Feline Immunodeficiency Virus (FIV) capsid overlay well with the wild-type HIV capsid 342 structure (Fig 5B) [36, 37]. Though non-primate lentiviruses appear to have the necessary capsid 343 surface for MxB biding, they are not restricted by MxB, perhaps because they use different 344 nuclear import pathways [38]. These observations suggest that the presence of a negatively-345 charged lattice interface may be necessary for MxB restriction, but that restriction may be 346 dependent on other factors like nuclear import pathways.",

Flasks were cooled, and 0.5mM IPTG was 359 added to express the MxB-MBP protein at 18C overnight. Cells were centrifuged and pellets were 360 resuspended in 40mL lysis buffer (50mM Tris pH8, 300mM NaCl, 0.2mM TCEP) with one 361 cOmplete EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma) and lysed using a microfluidizer. Lysate 362 was cleared (13,500RPM in an SS-34 rotor at 4C for 35 min) and loaded onto a 10mL gravity 363 column of Ni-NTA agarose beads equilibrated in lysis buffer. The column was washed with 3 364 volumes of lysis buffer, and protein was eluted in 30mL of Nickel B (50mM Tris pH8, 300mM 365 NaCl, 400mM Imidazole, 0.2mM TCEP). The elute was concentrated to a volume of 5-10mL and 366 diluted 10-fold with buffer S A (50mM HEPES pH7, 0.2mM TCEP). This was loaded onto a 5mL 367 Separhose Q HP columns on an FPLC and eluted using a gradient of buffer S B (S A + 1M NaCl).368 Peak fractions were concentrated to a volume of <2mL and loaded onto a size exclusion column 369 (S200PG) equilibrated in 50mM Tris pH 8 and 300mM NaCl. Peak fractions were collected, 370 concentrated, and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. Purity of the sample was checked by SDS-371 PAGE at each step. At each step, phenylmethane sulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) was added to a final 372 concentration of 1mM to reduce proteolysis. 373 374 CA expression and purification 375 To improve solubility, we expressed all variants of our 14C/45C/WM proteins as CA-Mpro-376 MBP-6xHis fusions, with a SARS Mpro protease cleavage site and 6xHis tag to aid in 377 purification. BL21(DE3) cells containing the plasmid encoding variants of CA 14C/45C -mpro-378 MBP6xHis were grown in Terrific Broth at 37\uf0b0C to an OD 600 of 0.4-0.6, then protein expression 28ul were centrifuged for 15 minutes at 4\uf0b0C, 20,000RPM in an SS-34 rotor. The 407 soluble fraction was subsequently removed and the pellet resuspended in 28ul of 50mM Tris pH8. 408 Gel samples of the soluble fraction were made by taking 14ul of the soluble fraction and adding 409 loading dye. 4ul of each gel sample was analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Invitrogen) and stained using 410 SimplyBlue stain (Thermo Fisher). ImageStudioLite was used to quantify proteins of interest in 411 the total and soluble fractions. The fraction of protein bound to CA was calculated by subtracting 412 the ratio of soluble to total protein of interest from 1. The data were graphed with standard 413 deviation using Prism 7. 414 415 Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations 416 The 3D structure of first 35 residues of MxB (MxB 1-35 ) was built de novo in Rosetta3 [40] and 417 then equilibrated in a water box for 500 ns. The structure of native HIV-1 CA monomer 418 (PDB:4XFX) was used to build the CA tri-hexamer model(Fig 4A, B). The equilibrated MxB 1-35 419 was initially placed above the tri-hexamer region. The combined structure was then solvated with 420 TIP3P water [41] and neutralized by NaCl at 150 mM concentration. The resulting model had a 421 total atom number of about 150,000(Fig 4B), included protein, ions and water, building, the systems were initially subjected to a minimization and 424 thermalization step. During thermalization the system was heated from 50K to 310K in 20K 425 increments. Subsequently, the whole systems were equilibrated for over 20 ns, while the carbon 426 alpha of the peripheral helices of CA monomer and one end of MxB 1-35 were restrained. The 427 minimization, thermalization and equilibration steps were completed in NAMD2.12[42].",

Therefore, these MxB-CA contacts imply that the 328 MxB N-terminus may stabilize the CA lattice by screening charge repulsions between inter-329 hexamer glutamates, introducing additional contacts connecting neighboring hexamers and 330 reinforcing the tri-hexamer region in CA lattice. The inter-hexamer interactions give the capsid 331 structural plasticity, which affects its stability[25]. It is possible that CA stabilization is related to 332 how MxB restricts HIV, as altering the capsid stability likely disrupts the timing of uncoating and 333 capsid-modulated processes such as nuclear import. Further study is necessary to test this 334 hypothesis.",
