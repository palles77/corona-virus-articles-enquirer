Reverse genetics technology is currently widely used to study the pathogenesis of the virus. The aim of this work was to determine and evaluate the factors which can contribute to infectivity of EV 71 RNA transcripts in vitro. Two strategies, overlapping RT-PCR and long distance RT-PCR, were employed to obtain the full-length genome cDNA clones of the virus. The length of the poly(A) tail and the presence of non-viral 3 -terminal sequences were studied in regard to their effects on infectivity of the in vitro RNA transcripts of EV 71 in cell culture. The data revealed that only cDNA clones obtained after long distance RT-PCR were infectious. No differences were observed in virus titres after transfection with in vitro RNA harbouring a poly(A) tail of 18 or 30 adenines in length, irrespective of the non-viral sequences at the 3 -terminus.",

Many of these studies involve genetic manipulations of EV 71 and cannot be conducted without a DNA clone of the viral genome or the targeted genes. Construction of a DNA clone of RNA viruses, including EV 71, utilizes reverse genetics and recombinant DNA techniques, when viral RNA genome or its parts are converted into a complementary DNA (cDNA) followed by cloning of the cDNA molecules into a suitable DNA vector (Boyer and Haenni, 1994; Lai, 2000) .",

            "text": "The EV 71 genome is a single-stranded positive RNA of approximately 7.4 kb in length, and comprises a 5 untranslated region (UTR), a single open reading frame (ORF) and a short 3 UTR followed by a polyadenylated (poly(A)) tail (Brown and Pallansch, 1995) . To generate an infectious EV 71 cDNA clone, the entire viral genome including its 5 and 3 terminus must be amplified and inserted into a plasmid. To date, several research groups have succeeded in production of the full-length EV 71 cDNA clones by assembling several cDNA fragments of the viral genome into a single DNA vector via specific cleavage sites, and by using conventional stepby-step cloning procedures (Arita et al., 2005; Chua et al., 2008; Shang et al., 2013a) . Additional steps such as screening of the subgenomic cDNA clones, restriction digestion and purification of the cDNA fragments make the process tedious and time-consuming. In some cases, traditional multi-step cloning strategies could be simplified by the utilization of overlapping/fusion PCR which yields full-length viral cDNA, and eliminates the necessity of construction of the sub-genomic cDNA clones. Although successfully employed with a number of viruses (Ohsugi et al., 2004; Desbiez et al., 2012) , this method has not been applied to EV 71. Another approach used in cDNA production of the full length viral genomes is long distance RT-PCR. EV 71 RNA transcripts synthesized from RT-PCR amplicons bearing a SP6 promoter were shown to be infectious both in cell culture and mice (Han et al., 2010) . The performance of long distance PCR might vary with different viral strains and, therefore, would require optimization in order to amplify the entire viral genome in a single reaction (Boot et al., 2004) . To date, long distance PCR used in the production of the full-length EV 71 cDNA was based on 35-40 PCR cycles and utilized DNA polymerases exhibiting various error rates (Han et al., 2010; Meng et al., 2012) . Unfortunately, there is no information available on genetic diversity of the cDNA clones produced by those methods when compared to the original viral stocks. In general, it could be anticipated that an amplification strategy with a higher fidelity DNA polymerase and a lower number of PCR cycles will be advantageous when preservation of the viral genome sequences is essential. Success in the generation of full-length cDNA viral clones does not necessary guarantee infectivity of those constructs (Arita et al., 2005; Desbiez et al., 2012) . A number of factors might account for this problem, including additional nucleotides incorporated at the 5 and 3 ends of viral genome, length of the poly(A) tail, artificial mutations introduced into viral genome during RT-PCR, cell culture transfection conditions, proportion of infectious and non-infectious genomes in the original viral population (Moormann et al., 1996; Yanagi et al., 1997; Feuer et al., 2002; Kusov et al., 2005; Silvestri et al., 2006) .",

Even though several experimental approaches have been successful, the information regarding the proportion of the infectious and non-infectious viral clones generated by those approaches is often missing. In this context, the main objective of this study was to compare the efficacy of two experimental strategies, namely overlapping and long distance RT-PCR, when used in the production of full-length cDNA of EV 71 genome. Our results demonstrated the crucial importance of the chosen amplification method on rescuing the infectious virus progeny from the cDNA clones. Additionally, other factors such as a length of the poly(A) tail and presence of non-viral sequences at the 3 terminus of the viral genome were examined in relation to infectivity of the cDNA constructs. The present work emphasized a number of factors which should be considered in order to succeed in the production of an infectious cDNA clone of EV 71. Practically, this study demonstrated that some steps can be eliminated from the procedure to make it rapid and less labour-intensive with no adverse effects on infectivity. Although the described method was applied to EV 71, it can be potentially used in a rapid production of infectious cDNA clones of other enteroviruses with genome organization similar to that of EV 71.",

In the first round of the overlapping PCR the 5 half of the EV 71 genome was produced at a lower amount compared to the 3 fragment (data not shown). That could be due to incomplete extension of the cDNA during reverse transcription or to inefficient annealing of the Ft7/R3991 primers whose individual melting temperatures differed to a greater degree when compared to the F3821/RMluI primers used for amplification of the 3 half. However, combining an equal amount of the 5 and 3 DNA fragments in the second round of the overlapping PCR resulted in an abundant DNA product comprising the full-length EV 71 genome (Fig. 1A) . In contrast to the overlapping PCR, the long distance PCR approach required optimization of PCR conditions in order to obtain sufficient amounts of DNA from a single round for downstream analyses, gel purification and cloning. Additionally, a number of DNA polymerases recommended for long template amplification were used unsuccessfully (LongAmp TM Taq from New England Bio-Labs, Ipswich, MA, USA; Expand Long Template PCR System from Roche Applied Science, Upper Bavaria, Germany; and an in-house mix of Pfu DNA Pol and GoTaq \u00ae DNA Pol which were supplied from Promega, Madison, WI, USA) prior to obtaining positive results with iProof High-Fidelity DNA Pol.

This indicates that this mutation was highly unlikely to be an RT-PCR error and existed prior to RT-PCR amplification. Additionally, several VP1 mutations (A275G, A292G, A293C and C848T) observed in viral clones corresponded to double peaks (R275, R292, M293 and Y848) within the VP1 sequence of an RT-PCR product amplified independently from the cDNA used in cloning.

When VP1sequences of viral clones were compared to that of the original viral stock, the average number of nucleotide substitutions per site was 0.003 and 0.001 for Strategy 1 and 2, respectively. Thus, the greater number of mutations and the higher average distance calculated for Strategy 1 were likely as a result of more nucleotide mis-incorporations introduced during the RT-PCR when compared to Strategy 2. It was impossible to conclude, at least without conducting additional site-directed mutagenesis experiments, if some of the mutations produced by Strategy 1resulted in non-infectious EV 71 clones. Additionally, even if single mutations did not affect infectivity, the recombination occurring during the second round of the overlapping PCR could have a negative effect on infectivity of the full-length EV 71 cDNA.

In this study, we could not rescue EV 71 from in vitro RNA harbouring an A 18 -tail (Strategy 1), whereas in vitro RNA with an A 30 -tail (Strategy 2) could produce infectious virus upon transfection of cell culture. To examine if poly(A) tail length, but not the RT-PCR amplification procedure, abolished infectivity of the EV 71 clones from Strategy 1, RNA transcripts harbouring A 18 -or A 30 -tails were obtained in vitro from ds cDNA templates amplified by the RT-PCR protocol used in Strategy 2. Additionally, there was experimental evidence that non-viral sequences downstream of the poly(A) tail had a negative effect on infectivity of poliovirus RNA molecules (Sarnow, 1989) . To investigate if extra nucleotides at the end of the poly(A) tract reduced infectivity of EV 71 RNA in our study, we obtained in vitro RNA transcripts from ds cDNA templates with or without 3 -terminal extensions following the A 18or A 30 -tails (Table 2 ). Comparing the infectivity of in vitro RNA transcripts derived from those ds cDNA molecules would allow us to determine if extra steps, including treatment of the full-length PCR product with endonucleases, are necessary. As a result, six ds cDNA templates containing different 3 termini were created. Although the 3 -terminal sequences of those cDNAs have not been determined by sequencing, the size of the DNA fragments (approximately 100 nt in length) excised from the 3 -end of the cDNA templates by DraI endonuclease was estimated by the polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (data not shown). Clear difference in size was observed between 3 -DNA fragments derived from DNA 18++ [poly(A) 18 ",

In most cases, construction of EV 71 cDNA clones has been based on subcloning techniques which are typically laborious and timeconsuming (Arita et al., 2005; Chua et al., 2008; Shang et al., 2013a) . Recent advances in reverse genetics and availability of long template DNA polymerases allowed amplification of the full length viral genome in a single PCR (Han et al., 2010; Meng et al., 2012) . Unfortunately, there is little or no information available on the proportion of infectious and non-infectious cDNA viral clones produced by those methods. In this study, we compared two amplification strategies which theoretically were expected to be successful in the production of infectious EV 71 cDNA clones. First, overlapping PCR which was conducted in two rounds, allowing the generation of an abundant amount of the full-length viral cDNA. The PCR enzyme blend utilized offered 3-times higher fidelity than Thermus aquaticus DNA polymerase (Taq DNA Pol) alone and, at the same time, could produce a PCR product with 3 A-overhangs, ready for TAcloning. The second strategy was based on a long distance PCR with iProof High-Fidelity DNA Pol which possesses a rapid extension capacity and a 52-fold lower error rate than Taq DNA Pol. The cDNA amplified in this strategy was blunt-ended and 3 A-overhangs had to be added in an additional step prior to cloning. Although both amplification methods allowed generation of the full-length cDNA of EV 71 genome, the subsequent cloning and cell culture transfection experiments revealed that only viral clones containing the cDNA amplified by the long distance PCR were infectious.",

One of the factors could be deleterious mutations introduced into the viral genome during the RT-PCR step. Even though both experimental strategies used DNA polymerases with proof-reading activity, the overall fidelity of a chosen amplification method depends both on enzyme error rate and the number of PCR cycles. The overlapping PCR performed in two rounds resulted in an increase of the total number of the PCR cycles required for amplification of the full-length viral genome. With the long distance PCR and, additionally, utilizing a highly processive DNA polymerase, the number of required PCR cycles could be minimized to 20. As a result, when the overall number of mutations was compared, it was found to be lower in the infectious clones produced in Strategy 2 (Table 3) .",

Those primers, RMluI or RMluI-30, allowed production of the cDNA harbouring the T 18 or T 30 -tail, respectively, with various non-viral sequences at the 3 terminus. It has been previously shown that inhibition of infectivity by extra non-viral nucleotides at the 3 end depends on the length and nature of the sequence (Sarnow, 1989) . Long heteropolymeric 3 end extensions decreased or abolished infectivity whereas short extra sequences were usually tolerated. With some viruses, the biological activity of the in vitro RNA transcripts was affected by the length of the poly(A) tail as well. A shortened poly(A) tail was shown to decrease virus replication for a number of viruses (e.g. poliovirus, hepatitis A virus and coronavirus) (Sarnow, 1989; Kusov et al., 2005; Silvestri et al., 2006) . With poliovirus, a stretch of at least 20A residues was essential in order to approach the level of the negative strand RNA synthesis similar to that of the wild-type RNA transcripts. It was suggested that the poly(A) tail should be long enough in order to interact with the PABP and initiate the VPg uridylation (Silvestri et al., 2006) . Additionally, the poly(A) tail probably plays some role in the protection of the RNA transcripts in vivo against host cell ribonucleases (Kusov et al., 2005) . Interestingly, with some other viruses, an absence of the poly(A) tail or an addition of long non-viral sequence downstream of the viral genome did not have any effect on infectivity of the RNA transcripts (Eggen et al., 1989; Liu et al., 2008) .",

Subsequently, this site can be used to linearize the plasmid DNA downstream of the poly(A) tail rather than using the multiple restriction sites existing in a vector. In this study, the MluI restriction enzyme was optimal for this purpose as it does not have a recognition site within the EV 71 genome and leaves an extension of only 4 nucleotides at the 5 end of the digested DNA. Those extra bases (5 -CGCG) can be removed by a single-strand nuclease in order to produce a template with no extraneous sequence downstream of the poly(A) tail. However, introduction of this enzymatic reaction would require an additional DNA purification step which, in the end, makes the approach more laborious. To understand if non-viral sequences and/or length of the poly(A) tract plays a certain role in infectivity of the cloned EV 71, six different cDNA templates of the EV 71 genome were constructed and used in the production of the in vitro RNA transcripts ( Table 2 ). The cDNA templates had the identical 5 ends and differed only in their sequences downstream of the 3 UTR. Vero cell cultures were transfected with the same amount of the in vitro RNA transcripts and viral titres of the rescued viruses were estimated in TCID 50 assay. Our results demonstrated insignificant variations among the viral titres (Fig. 5) . Thus, it could be concluded that under experimental conditions the length of the poly(A) tail or the presence of the non-viral 3 -terminal sequences did not account for the loss in infectivity of the EV 71 RNA transcripts produced in Strategy 1.",

Our results highlight the importance of the amplification method on the overall success. Using a DNA polymerase with high fidelity and reducing the number of PCR cycles are absolutely essential in order to minimize the number of undesirable deleterious mutations and to ensure infectivity of the cloned viruses. This approach can be useful if the genetic diversity of the viral population is to be preserved. To the best of our knowledge, and for the first time, a sufficient amount of the full length 7.4 kb cDNA of EV 71 was amplified in 20 PCR cycles. Additionally, when designing the PCR reverse primer, the length of the poly-thymidine stretch can be shortened to 18 residues, as a longer poly(A) tail did not result in higher infectivity. Incorporation of the unique restriction site into the reverse PCR primer can allow the linearization of a cDNA clone and, finally, non-viral sequences remaining at the end of the poly(A) tail after restriction digestion do not interfere with infectivity. In conclusion, an experimental approach described in this paper as Strategy 2 represents a convenient and reliable method allowing production of infectious EV 71 clones and will enable further molecular genetic studies of the virus.",
