The results are summarized in Table 2 . The prodrugs 9a and 9b showed markedly enhanced replicon activity when compared to the parent nucleosides. These monophosphate prodrugs afforded >100-fold higher levels of the TP species than the parent nucleosides. Corresponding to the increased potency, an increase in cytotoxicity was also observed for the 4 prepared prodrugs. The selectivity indices (CC 50 /EC 50 ) of 9b, 9c and 9d were less than 10-fold making it difficult to differentiate HCV activity from cellular toxicity. The greater potency and selectivity observed for 9a (EC 50 of 0.085 lM and selectivity of 40-fold) likely reflects a combination of the potent enzyme activity and the high intracellular TP concentration (4220 pmol/million cells when cells were incubated with 10 lM of 9a).
