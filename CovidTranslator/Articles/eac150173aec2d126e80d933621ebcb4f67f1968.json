Because of these differences, it, is now calear that El and E2 belong to two distinct glycoprotein classes. Glycoprotein E2 has carbohydrate side-chains with N-glycosidic linkages, as is the case with glycoproteins of rhabdoviruses, ortho-and paramyxoviruses. alphaviruses, and oncornaviruses. This conclusion is based on the following observations. (1) We show by metabolic labeling and by chemical analysis that E2 contains glucosamine. mannose, galactose, fucose and neuraminic acid. Basically. the same carbohydrate composition has been found with the glycoproteins of all t'he other viruses. Most of the E2 side-chains are of the complex type. About 15% of the glycopeptides derived from E2 are sensitive to treatment with endoglycosidase H and show strong binding to concanavalin A, indicating t,hat these side-chains belong to t,he mannose-rich type.",

It is therefore, tempting to speculate that E2 initiates infection as do the glycoproteins of ortho-and paramyxoviruses. Glycoprotein E 1, on the other hand, has been suggested to play an important role in envelope formation and in the interaction between the envelope and the nucleocapsid (Sturman et al., 1980) . In this respect, it is interesting to note that, in contrast to most other enveloped viruses, coronaviruses mature by budding from the endoplasmic reticulum (McIntosh, 1974) . Whether the unusual carbohydrate pattern of El can be correlated to the unusual budding site remains to be seen. Despite the fact that a large variety of secretory and membrane proteins of great biological interest are glycoproteins with O-glycosidic linkages (for a review. see Montreuil, 1980) . int,racellular transport and processing of these glycoproteins is still only poorly understood.",

Glucosamine has been observed occasionally in such oligosaccharides: e.g. in glycoproteins with blood group I activity(F&i  et al..   1971) and in rat sublingual glycoprotein (Slomiany & Slomiany. 1978). The 0. glycosidic nature of the carbohydrate-protein linkages in El was further substantiated by the finding that the oligosaccharide side-chains can be removed AND H.-D.KLENK glycosidic side-chains. The exact structure of the side-chains is not known, but our data show that there are at least four differently sized oligosaccharides that can be distinguished as two groups by t,heir affinity to wheat germ agglutinin.",
