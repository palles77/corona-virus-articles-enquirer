There have been 36 deaths (19.4%) among the confirmed cases. A few more deaths might occur from the 12 cases who are still under treatment. Starting from the index case, who received confirmatory diagnosis on May 20, the outbreak showed the characteristics of a hospital-associated epidemic. Transmission occurred across Korea's network of hospitals, as infective patients moved from one hospital to another [2] . Hospitals often served as amplification points that generated clusters of new cases. As a result, 82 (44%) of the MERS cases were patients being treated in the hospitals, 65 (35%) were family members or visitors of the patients, and the other 39 (21%) were medical personnels including physicians and nurses.",

However, it took several weeks to catch up with the spread, because of the initial delays in identifying infective cases. Overall, 16 693 persons have been cumulatively quarantined because of potential contact with infective cases. Significant public fear and economic impact have been documented over the course of the outbreak.",

JPMPH strongly encourages researchers to submit study results in diverse forms, ranging from case reports, to epidemiologic studies, policy perspectives, economic analyses, and any other types of contributions. JPMPH hopes to be a vehicle of scholarly and practical communications and collaborations that will help overcome the challenges of global infectious diseases, including MERS-CoV.",
