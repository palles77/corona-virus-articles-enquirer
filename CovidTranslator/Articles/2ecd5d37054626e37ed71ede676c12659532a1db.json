The study was carried out with 32 fecal samples collected just before inoculation and at 28 days postinoculation. Five groups were studied: naturally infected dogs, experimentally infected dogs, dogs inoculated with a modified live (ML) CCV vaccine by the intramuscular route, dogs inoculated with an ML CCV vaccine by the oronasal route, and dogs given an inactivated CCV vaccine. Both the naturally and the experimentally infected dogs developed high levels of fecal IgAs. Interestingly, dogs inoculated with the ML CCV vaccine by the oronasal route developed levels of fecal IgA that were higher than those observed in the dogs inoculated with the same CCV vaccine by the intramuscular route or those observed in dogs inoculated with the inactivated vaccine. A relationship between the level of fecal IgAs to CCV and the degree of protection against CCV infection was observed.",

Although serum antibody titers in pups infected or vaccinated by the intramuscular route are generally higher than those in orally exposed pups, immunity does not occur after subsequent oral infection by CCV (1) . It is known that the mucosal surface of the gastrointestinal tract is replete with organized follicles and antigen-reactive lymphoid tissues, including B cells, T lymphocytes, plasma cells, and other cellular elements involved in the induction and maintenance of the immune response. This gut-associated lymphoid tissue is considered the principal inductive site for mucosal immune responses (20) . In external secretions, secretory immunoglobulin A (IgA) is involved in defending external surfaces by inhibiting the adherence of several pathogens to the surfaces of mucosal cells, thereby preventing the entry of these pathogens. Secretory IgAs contribute to immune exclusion by complexing with the antigen and limiting its luminal uptake. Consequently, protection against mucosal infections has generally been correlated with the presence of specific antibodies in the mucosal surface (7, 8) . Several studies have suggested the importance of antibodies on the mucosal surface of the small intestine as a major determinant of resistance to rotavirus illness (6) . Therefore, it appears that local immunity (IgA in the gut mucosa) is essential for protection against CCV infection (1) .",
