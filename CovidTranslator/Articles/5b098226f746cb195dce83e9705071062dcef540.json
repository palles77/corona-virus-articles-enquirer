We retrospectively studied the serial infection control measures to determine factors most effective in preventing nosocomial infections of healthcare workers (HCWs) during the 2003 Taiwanese severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic. Fever screening stations, triage of fever patients, separating SARS patients from other patients, separation of entrances and passageways between patients and HCWs, and increasing handwashing facilities all demonstrated a protective effect for HCWs (univariate analysis; P < 0.05). By multiple logistic regression: (i) checkpoint alcohol dispensers for glove-on hand rubbing between zones of risk, and (ii) fever screening at the fever screen station outside the emergency department, were the significant methods effectively minimising nosocomial SARS infection of HCWs (P < 0.05). The traffic control bundle should be implemented in future epidemics as a tool to achieve strict infection control measures.",

Then SARS spread to the community. 1e6 Medical facilities responded with infection control measures to mitigate nosocomial infections.",

Stage 1 began on 8 March 2003, when the first index case, who had recently returned from Guangdong, entered National Taiwan University Hospital. The patient was intubated and was admitted to the intensive care unit without a nosocomial transmission. 7 In April 2003, a woman who had no history of traveling abroad entered Taipei Municipal Hoping Hospital (TMHH), leading to a nosocomial outbreak of SARS that eventually affected 113 patients and 37 HCWs. 3, 5, 6 Suspecting nosocomial transmission, in Stage 2 officials quarantined TMHH on 24 April and on 26 April transferred most patients to a special isolation hospital converted from a military hospital. 3, 5, 8 The special isolation hospital did not have negative pressure isolation rooms (NPIRs), but was equipped with modifications that provided a 'negative-pressure like' environment. 5 In addition, the traffic control bundle (Figure 1 ) was implemented, comprising triage of patients before entering the hospital, division of the hospital into zones of risk, and requiring HCWs to use alcohol from dispensers for glove-on hand rubbing as they went between zones of risk. 5 Meanwhile, the pattern of nosocomial superspread of SARS was repeating at other newly infected hospitals, and spread throughout the Taiwanese community. 3 To test our hypothesis that the traffic control bundle significantly minimised nosocomial spread of SARS infection, we compared the rate of nosocomial SARS infection in HCWs at the special isolation hospital with that in 86 other Taiwanese hospitals that were not using the traffic control bundle. 5 During three weeks (27 April to 21 May 2003) in the middle of the SARS epidemic, the special isolation hospital had only two SARS infections in HCWs (0.03 cases per bed), one of which was due to failure to follow precautions, whereas the comparison group had 43 suspected and 50 probable HCW SARS cases (0.13 cases per bed). 5, 8 Following the success of the traffic control bundle at the special isolation hospital, in Stage 3 the Taiwan Center for Disease Control mandated nationwide use of the traffic control bundle at all Taiwanese hospitals after 21 May 2003. Within two weeks, the SARS epidemic was under control in Taiwan. 3, 5, 8 Here we report a more comprehensive retrospective study that evaluates the impact of using the traffic control bundle throughout Taiwan during the 2003 Taiwanese SARS epidemic.",

HCWs became the amplifier in the chain of transmission in the 2003 outbreak. Although PPE and NPIRs were implemented as recommended by health authorities, nosocomial SARS infections still occurred among HCWs. Given that PPE and NPIRs were available throughout Taiwan in the early phase of the Taiwanese SARS epidemic, we postulated that PPE and NPIRs do not effectively protect HCWs from becoming infected with SARS-CoV. The present study demonstrated that neither the frequency of change and double layers of gowns and gloves, nor use of NPIRs alone, were effective protection. Similar situations had been observed in Canada and Hong Kong during the second wave of SARS outbreaks. 1, 10 We hypothesised that the traffic control bundle was responsible for almost completely eliminating nosocomial SARS infections among HCWs in Taiwan. The results of our multivariate analysis of control measures used during the Taiwanese SARS epidemic showed that outdoor fever triage and checkpoint glove-on alcohol disinfection were effective protection against nosocomial SARS transmission (Table II) . Because checkpoints for glove-on alcohol disinfection were set between zones of risk, gloveon alcohol disinfection could be effective only after the zone of risk was delineated. Therefore, the three integrated components of the traffic control bundle were all effective. None of the other standard control measures, including NPIRs and PPE usage alone, was effective without implementing the traffic control bundle.",

Instead, the government conducted a trial in a special isolation hospital, which was converted from a military hospital in Taipei city. Following success of the traffic control bundle at the trial hospital, the Taiwan Center for Disease Control finally mandated nationwide use of the traffic control bundle at all Taiwanese hospitals after 21 May 2003. That was two-and-a-half months after the first case of SARS in Taiwan. Before that time, most of the hospitals used only traditional infectious disease control measures, such as setting up simplified NPIRs within a hospital or NPIR with anteroom design ( Table I) . Some of the hospitals did not even strictly require wearing a mask when entering the hospital or wearing a surgical mask in a ward. That could be the reason different institutions implemented different parts of the system at the early stage of the SARS epidemic. During the Taiwanese SARS epidemic, fever screening was originally at the entrance of the hospital and ED, but later in an outdoor fever screening station due to the upsurge of fever patients coming to the hospital and crowding the ED. A report on the ED of the National Taiwan University Hospital demonstrated that when there was no outdoor fever screening and triage, all fever patients were managed and triaged within the ED of the hospital. 7 Triage was also found to be a significant protective control measure in Singapore during the SARS epidemic. 2 During the height of the epidemic, with crowded space, HCWs tended to spread the virus unintentionally despite being gowned and gloved, contaminating the environment. 7 A minimum distance between beds of 1 m was found to be a risk factor for acquiring SARS. 6 However, a different result was found in the study at the National Taiwan University Hospital where a distance <1 m from the SARS patient helped to protect HCWs from contracting symptoms of fever and diarrhoea. 11 It is intriguing because <1 m is considered as a zone of risk in a hospital even without implementing the traffic control bundle, and is more cautious in terms of infection control. A distance >1 m from SARS beds would blur the zones of risk, and there would be more chance to contract SARS-CoV through casual contact with the contaminated environment. In that case, the traffic control bundle would be an effective tool to achieve strict infection control measures. The effect of bed spacing on spread of infectious disease in hospitals highlights the importance of the traffic control bundle.",

Finally, susceptibility of individual HCWs to SARS infection was not taken into consideration.
