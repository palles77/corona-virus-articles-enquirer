            "text": "Incomplete neutralization of virus, especially when it occurs in the presence of excess neutralizing antibody, represents a biological phenomenon that impacts greatly on antibody-mediated immune prophylaxis of viral infection and on successful vaccine design. To understand the mechanism by which a virus escapes from antibody-mediated neutralization, we have investigated the interactions of non-neutralizing and neutralizing antibodies at an epitope cluster on the spike protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). The epitope cluster was mapped at the C-terminus of the spike protein; it consists of structurally intertwined epitopes recognized by two neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), 341C and 540C, and a non-neutralizing mAb, 240C. While mAb 341C binds to a mostly linear epitope composed of residues 507 PAT 509 and V 349 , mAb 240C binds to an epitope that partially overlaps the former by at least two residues (P 507 and A 508 ). The epitope corresponding to mAb 540C is a conformational one, involving residues L 504 and N 505 . In neutralization assays, non-neutralizing 240C disrupted virus neutralization by mAb 341C and/or mAb 540C, whereas a combination of mAbs 341C and 540C blocked virus infectivity synergistically. These findings indicate that the epitope cluster on the spike protein may serve as an evolutionarily conserved platform at which a dynamic interplay between neutralizing and non-neutralizing antibodies occurs, thereby determining the outcome of SARS-CoV infection.",

            "text": "Patients suffering from infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [1] often have appreciable levels of virus-specific antibody [2] [3] [4] [5] . This situation is similar to that encountered in other viral diseases such as chronic hepatitis C or HIV, where the infection persists despite the presence of antibodies [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] . One of the mechanisms proposed originally by Dulbecco et al. [11] to account for apparent inhibition of virus neutralization was that the serum of infected individuals might contain non-neutralizing antibodies. When combined with the corresponding virus, the non-neutralizing antibody could presumably interfere with the attachment of neutralizing antibody, thereby diminishing its neutralizing activity. Massey and Schochetman subsequently showed that non-neutralizing antibody binds to virus and sterically blocks the binding of neutralizing antibodies [12] . Recently, we found two Epitopes I and II, within a short peptide between the hypervariable regions I and II of the hepatitis C virus E2 protein. Epitope I, but not Epitope II, was implicated in virus neutralization. The binding of a non-neutralizing antibody to Epitope II disrupted virus neutralization mediated by antibody binding at Epitope I [9, 13] .",

We have characterized three previously isolated monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that recognize the spike protein of SARS-CoV between residues 491 and 510 [14] . We found that the two neutralizing mAbs, 341C and 540C, could act synergistically to inhibit SARS-CoV infection in vitro, while the non-neutralizing antibody, 240C, disrupted the neutralizing activity of both 341C and 540C. These findings suggest that this epitope cluster may provide a viral escape mechanism whereby the neutralization of virus is thwarted by an interfering, non-neutralizing antibody. E6 cells, while mAb 240C did not. The epitopes of these mAbs were located within residues 491-510 on the spike protein.

Replacement of N 505 A 506 with RR in the peptide spanning residues 491-510 had no detectable effect on the binding of mAb 341C, suggesting that neither N 505 nor A 506 was involved in the epitope for mAb 341C. However, a single mutation of P 507 to R resulted in significant loss of binding by mAb 341C (p < 0.05) (Fig. 1C) . Similarly, a reduction of binding was observed following the replacement of T 509 V 510 with RR (p < 0.05) (Fig. 1C) . The results indicated that residue P 507 , as well as T 509 and/or V 510 within peptide 491-510, is important for mAb 341C Fig. 1 . Epitope mapping. (A) Epitope mapping by ELISA.

Indeed, by inserting residues 505 NAPATV 510 into a synthetic peptide derived from the HCV E2 protein, we confirmed that 505 NAPATV 510 alone could be recognized by mAb 341C [9] . The inability of mAbs 240C and 540C to bind to the synthetic peptide 491-510 implied that the epitopes might be conformational in nature. To map the epitopes corresponding to mAbs 240C and 540C, random peptide phage display libraries were used. Two commercially available libraries, C7C and 12-mer, were used in the present study. The C7C library displays 7 amino acids flanked by two cysteine residues, permitting the formation of a disulfide bond. In such a configuration, the peptide residues can be presented on a loop structure, allowing them to be recognized by a single antibody. To complement the C7C approach, screening the 12-mer peptide library by an antibody could assist in identifying the core sequence [18] , as defined by at least two connected residues within the displayed peptide, highly similar to, if not identical with, the linear sequence of the spike protein. We found that A, P, and V were the key residues present in the selected peptides following the screening of the C7C library with mAb 240C (Fig. 2A) . When the 12-mer library was screened, three connected residues (APA) were found as the core sequence ( Fig. 2A) . As these linear residues were found in peptide 491-510, we were able to determine that the epitope corresponding to 240C was composed of the residues 506 APA 508 (Fig. 2B) .",

Knowing that V 510 is neither exposed on the surface nor solvent-accessible, we argue that V 349 , rather than V 510 , is a key residue for mAb 341C binding.

These data indicated that residues L 504 and N 505 are the residues for mAb 540C binding. Interestingly, our analysis of the structure of the spike protein revealed that several residues including M 416 , P 413 and L 412 , i.e., three of those identified by phage display, were exposed on the surface and located on a loop adjacent to the epitopes for mAbs 240C and 341C (Fig. 3C and D) .

First, we observed that the three identified epitopes form a closely packed cluster and thus are located proximal to each other on the surface of the spike protein (Fig. 3A ), yet distal from the ACE2 receptor binding site. The epitope for mAb 240C partially overlaps with that for mAb 341C by at least two amino acids, i.e., P 507 and A 508 . Presumably, by competing for residues (Fig. 3B) , the non-neutralizing antibody mAb 240C could inhibit the binding of neutralizing mAb 341C in an equilibrium-related fashion. Second, the epitope for mAb 240C is also located in close proximity to that recognized by mAb 540C. Binding of mAb 240C may block accessibility to mAb 540C (Fig. 3C) as a large surface area of the antigen is often buried upon antibody binding. Davies and Cohen calculate that the buried area can range from 500 \u00c5 2 to more than 800 \u00c5 2 , encompassing 21-32 amino acid residues, although only 9-20 amino acids (i.e., the epitope) make direct contacts with the antibody [24] . Thus, upon antibody binding, the buried surface area contains more than just the epitope regions that undergo direct interaction with the antibody. It includes also the area adjacent to the epitope regions, plus the area with solvent accessibility blocked by the antibody occupying the surface of the antigen. Third, although the epitopes for mAbs 341C and 540C are located on a single loop in the spike protein, they are spatially separated, thereby providing distinct interfaces for independent antibody binding (Fig. 3D) .",

            "text": "In this study, we have identified a cluster of epitopes on the spike protein of SARS-CoV. Within this cluster an interplay occurs among non-neutralizing and neutralizing antibodies. First, the antibody-specific epitopes are spatially close to each other. This arrangement creates a unique platform for competition. One of possible mechanisms is that the steric block by non-neutralizing antibodies reduces the amount of virion-bound neutralizing antibody on the spike protein to a suboptimal level of occupancy that can disable neutralization, as concluded by Klasse and co-workers from their studies of human and animal viruses [25, 26] . Such condition has been reported for West Nile Virus that antibodymediated neutralization can be achieved only at relatively high concentrations of virion-bound antibody, whereas an enhancement of infection is observed at lower concentrations through conformational triggering of entry functions or through complement-or Fc receptor-dependent mechanisms [27] . Steric interference between mAb 240C and mAb 341C through the proposed mechanisms of residue sharing and spatial occupancy. The residues in cyan are bound by mAb 240C, the residues in magenta are bound by mAb 341C, and the residues in brown are the shared ones for the binding of both antibodies. (C) Steric interference between mAb 240C and mAb 540C through the proposed mechanism of spatial occupancy. The residues in cyan are bound by mAb 240C, while the residues in orange are bound by mAb 540C. (D) Structural and mechanistic model for synergistic virus neutralization between mAb 341C and mAb 540C. The residues in magenta are bound by mAb 341C, while the residues in orange are bound by mAb 540C. Second, although the epitopes of the neutralizing mAbs 341C and 540C are situated spatially close, partly sharing a single loop structure, they represent two separate interfaces for antibody binding. The synergistic neutralization we observed in our mixing experiments may thus be understood as that these two antibodies are able to bind to their respective epitopes without competition.",

This finding is not unprecedented; antibodies such as those specific for influenza hemagglutinin neutralize by binding outside the virus receptor binding site [29] . In addition, alternative or auxiliary receptors for SARS-CoV could exist [30] [31] [32] . Further study on whether mAb 341C or mAb 540C sufficiently blocks other receptor binding sites or if the binding of each of these mAbs can cause subtle indirect conformational changes in the RBD should provide insights into the mechanism of synergy.",

If this mechanism operates in vivo, it should provide an explanation for the immune evasion by viruses regardless of whether the virus causes acute or chronic infection. On the other hand, it may also be possible for a host to mount a vigorous neutralizing antibody response against virus infection by producing antibodies that recognize distinct epitopes and act synergistically. Understanding the mechanisms of antibody synergy and interference could serve as a prerequisite to the design of an effective vaccine and the development of effective immune prophylactic treatments against virus infections.",
