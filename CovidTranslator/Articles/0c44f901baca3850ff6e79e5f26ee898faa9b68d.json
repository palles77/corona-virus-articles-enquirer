HIV/AIDS, severe acute respiratory syndrome, H5N1 avian influenza, and many other emerging diseases have either proved fatal or caused international alarm. Common and interactive co-determinants of disease emergence, including population growth, travel, and environmental disruption, have been increasingly documented and studied. Are emerging infections a new phenomenon related to modern life, or do more basic determinants, transcending time, place, and human progress, govern disease generation? By examining a number of historically notable epidemics, we suggest that emerging diseases, similar in their novelty, impact, and elicitation of control responses, have occurred throughout recorded history. Fundamental determinants, typically acting in concert, seem to underlie their emergence, and infections such as these are likely to continue to remain challenges to human survival.",

Noting universal susceptibility, multiple independent importations, and an association with war, crowding, and the breakdown of public-health measures, Thucydides also distinguished between signs, symptoms, complications, and variant clinical courses, and presented attack and case-fatality rates. His compelling clinical, public-health, and societally contextual description of an emerging disease was studied by virtually all western and middle eastern medical students for centuries, and profoundly influenced concepts of, approaches to, and even terminology of emerging infections well into the 19th century.",

Spanish adventurers under Hernando Cort\u00e9s landed on the Yucatan Coast 25 years later and marched to the capital of Tenochtitlan (now Mexico City), humiliating and imprisoning the Aztec ruler Moctezuma. Before Cort\u00e9s could defeat rival Spanish soldiers sailing from Cuba to restore Moctezuma's authority, the rival soldiers landed a former slave infected with smallpox. Over the next year the hueyzahautal (great eruption) raged over central America. [44] [45] [46] [47] Although smallpox may have first emerged in central Africa 5000 years previously-when an animal orthopoxvirus jumped into human beings 48 -the disease had probably not reached the New World. Historians believe that about 3\u00b75 million people in central Mexico died in the first year of the hueyzahautal. By the end of the century some 18\u00b75 (74%) of the 25 million population had died, 49 presumably largely because of smallpox and additional imported diseases. Smallpox spread southward into South America, ultimately destroying two great civilizations, the Aztec and Inca empires, facilitating Spanish conquests that greatly altered history. Francisco Pizarro, who continued Spanish conquests of South America in the 1530s, is alleged to have undertaken a bioterrorist attack on native peoples using smallpoxcontaminated blankets. 50 Mexico became a regional geographic reservoir for smallpox and was the source of repeated exportations until the 1940s.",

More recently, it has served as a benchmark for pandemic \"worst-case scenario\" planning. 81 While work on the potential for emerging influenza pandemics continues, other worrisome diseases continue to emerge-eg, SARS, appearing in 2003 and caused by a virus genetically unrelated to influenza that nonetheless mimics it in its means of spread and its threat to public-health control. Since at least the time of Thucydides, one of the first human responses to disease emergence has been to question its origin. When identified in 1981, AIDS seemed to be a completely new disease. Its early recognition in a peripatetic airline steward suggested (only partly correctly) that its emergence might have resulted from increased human movement resulting from ever decreasing travel times to multiple destinations. 84 Moreover, rapid spread via blood and body fluids within risk groups most capable of supporting such transmission (men who have sex with men, injection drug users, and transfusion recipients) seemed to support recent emergence. Surprisingly, however, phylogenetic analyses of the virus suggest that HIV infection emerged as a human disease around 1900, 85 and by complex pathways. Multiple jumps, into chimpanzees, of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) strains restricted to different primate species, 86 were apparently followed by SIV genetic recombinations that produced new chimpanzee-adapted SIVs. It is likely that three of these recombinants then transferred independently into human beings, leading to parallel HIV emergences now represented by different HIV clades. 85",

More than two centuries before the 2001 anthrax attacks in the USA, 55 unscrupulous farmers in Saint-Domingue, Hispaniola, intentionally sent to market the meats of infected livestock, producing in 1770 the deadliest anthrax epidemic on record. 15 000 people are said to have died of the disease, and another 15 000 from the slave revolt it precipitated. 23,56 During World War I, a German agent set up a laboratory in Chevy Chase, MD, USA (a mile from the current National Institutes of Health, and several miles from the White House), to make anthrax and other microbial weapons that were then used by paid agents to infect US and Romanian cavalry horses.35 In World War II, Japanese scientists undertook a human bioterrorist campaign with anthrax and other agents.35 A Sverdlovsk (Yekaterinburg, Russia) bioweapon facility accidentally released anthrax spores in 1979, killing more than 60 people. 57 \"\u2026.much light might be thrown on the causes of violent epidemics, by a series of careful observations, on their beginning and progress\u2026about the time the yellow fever made its appearance in this city\u2026it was observed that musquetoes invaded us in numberless swarms\u2026\" Noah Webster, Dec 1 and 6, 1797 10 6 months after delivering his 1793 inaugural address, US President George Washington was fleeing a deadly emerging epidemic. The entire federal government, along with physicians, merchants, and the middle and upper classes, quickly followed. Philadelphia, then the nation's capital, became a ghost town with an empty harbour, deserted streets, shuttered shops, and rotting corpses.18 Within a few weeks yellow fever, or as Europeans called it \"In 1793, a young belle, Dolley Todd, watched both her husband and infant son die in her arms of yellow fever, then nearly died of it herself. 20 years later the remarried Dolley Madison nursed her second husband-President James Madison-when he nearly died in office of what might have been yellow fever. 60 Historians have claimed that deep social and political fault lines were opened up by the American plague of 1793-98, stamping the nation's character and \"[shaking] the newly laid foundations of the Republic\u2026[so that] the crises they aroused have never been entirely put to rest\". 58But the epidemics also led to important advances in public health, such as the establishment by Congress in 1798 of the Marine Hospital System, 65 the forerunner of the US Public Health Service. In 1797, America's first medical journal, The Medical Repository ,66 was founded by three physicians who had survived the epidemic. By emphasising emerging epidemics and in publishing bills of mortality and other epidemiological information, the new journal foreshadowed by two centuries the modern journal Emerging Infectious Diseases. Acad\u00e9mie royale de m\u00e9decine was appointed; teams of scientists were sent to Russia and Poland to observe cholera first-hand. Coastal health agencies and new quarantine stations were set up; 35 health inspection offices and commissions in the d\u00e9partements (administrative divisions) were established as well.",
