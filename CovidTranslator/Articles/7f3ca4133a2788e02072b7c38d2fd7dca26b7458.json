Given the fastidious isolation of emerging PEDV in cell culture and difficulties in retaining the isolate infectivity upon further in vitro passage, highly attenuated recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (rVSV MT ) was used as a vector to express the PEDV spike (S) protein, aiming to develop a subunit vaccine against G2b viruses. An S protein with 19 of its cytoplasmic domain amino acids deleted could be incorporated into VSV particles, generating rVSV MT (VSV MT -S \u039419 ) with high efficiency. Our results suggest that VSV MT -S \u039419 could effectively induce PEDV-specific immunity in pigs via intramuscular, but not intranasal, immunization. Notably, immunizations of sows with VSV MT -S \u039419 provided protective lactogenic immunity against a virulent G2b PEDV challenge in piglets. Consequently, recombinant VSV MT may be a promising platform for preparing a subunit vaccine against PEDV.",

            "text": "Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is a coronavirus that was initially identified in 1978 (Pensaert and de Bouck, 1978) and is endemic mainly in Asia. In 2010, a PEDV outbreak emerged in China and then spread to other countries in Asia and North America Vlasova et al., 2014) . The PEDV genome consists of a singlestranded positive-sense RNA molecule. Its structural proteins include the spike (S), membrane (M), envelope (E), and the nucleocapsid (N) proteins. The S protein, which is responsible for virus attachment, receptor binding, cell membrane fusion, and entry, can induce neutralizing antibodies in the host (Lai et al., 2007) . A phylogenetic analysis based on S gene alignment indicated that PEDVs can be categorized into two genotypes: genotype 1 (G1) and genotype 2 (G2). These genotypes each consist of two subgroups: G1a and G1b for G1, and G2a and G2b for G2. Isolates of G2 are usually more pathogenic than those of G1 (Lee, 2015) . G1 PEDVs include classic strains such as CV777 and DR13. G2a isolates have been found in Asia. Notably, G2b isolates were responsible for the recent pandemic outbreaks in North America and Asia, which were characterized by high mortality in piglets (Huang et al., 2013; Vlasova et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2016) . Although inactivated and attenuated vaccines based on the classical CV777 strain have been widely used in China, porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) is still not controlled effectively (Wang et al., 2016) . The low-to-moderate effectiveness of the current CV777-based vaccines may be attributed to antigenic differences between the S protein of the vaccine and those of field epizootic strains (Lee, 2015) . Currently, a commercial vaccine against G2b strains remains unavailable. The isolation of PEDV in cell culture has proven fastidious, and a successfully isolated virus may still be incapable of retaining its infectivity upon further in vitro passage (Hofmann and Wyler, 1988; Oka et al., 2014) . This laboratory hurdle makes the production of an efficacious vaccine challenging.",

Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) is a promising viral vector for expressing foreign antigens, which are capable of potently stimulating host humoral and cellular immune responses (Roberts et al., 1998; Tan et al., 2005) . In the present study, a highly attenuated recombinant VSV with triple amino acid mutations in the M protein (\u0394M51, V221F, and S226R) (VSV MT ) was used to express the S protein of PEDV, with the aim of developing a mucosal vaccine against the predominant epidemic isolates of G2b (Fang et al., 2015) . Our data indicate that, when 19 amino acids of its cytoplasmic domain were deleted, the S protein could be efficiently incorporated into VSV particles and lead to the generation of a recombinant VSV (VSV MT -S \u039419 ) with high efficiency. Our in vivo studies revealed that VSV MT -S \u039419 could effectively induce anti-PEDV immunity in pigs via intramuscular, but not intranasal, immunization. Notably, the administration of VSV MT -S \u039419 in sows stimulated robust passive immunity in neonatal piglets, which could resist a lethal-dose challenge by a virulent homologous PEDV strain. Thus, together with the advantages that VSV MT -S \u039419 can replicate in BHK21 cells at titers above 10 8 PFU/ml and that BHK21 cells can grow in suspension in disposable bioreactors at cell concentrations of higher than 1 \u00d7 10 7 cells/ml, our findings indicate that recombinant VSV MT could be a promising platform for rapidly developing vaccines against emerging or reemerging epidemic strains of PEDV.",

After 48 h of transfection, the culture supernatants were collected and filtered into fresh BHK21 cells through a 0.2-\u03bcm membrane. These cells were checked daily for infection. If a typical cytopathic effect was observed 2-3 days afterwards, the supernatants were collected, and the viruses were plaque-purified in Vero cells. Individual plaques were isolated, and seed stocks were amplified in BHK21 cells. The rescued viruses were initially confirmed with RT-PCR, and the viral stocks were amplified by passage at multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.01 in BHK21 cells. For purifying recombinant VSV, cell culture fluids were clarified by centrifugation at 3000 r/min for 30 min.

Similarities of S1 amino acid sequences among SH 2012, AH 2012, and the US representative strain Colorado 2013 could reach 100%, whereas their similarity to CV777 was only 82.71%, typically with 5 AA insertion at two sites (AA59-62, AA140) and 2 AA deletions at site AA160 in the S protein of G2b strains (SH 2012 , AH 2012 , or Corolado 2013 in contrast to CV777 (Supl. Fig. 1 ). There were a total of 11 mutations existing in the COE and S1D regions of SH2012 compared with CV777, of which three were located in S1D and eight in the COE domain. The Cterminal epitope is a highly conserved epitope; not surprisingly, no difference was identified among CV777 and the G2b strains included in our study. The observed differences, especially within the neutralizing epitope(s), may have contributed to the current CV777 vaccine failure in the field . Thus, given the high similarity of the SH2012 S protein to the predominant PEDV G2b strains, it was used to construct a VSV-based PEDV subunit vaccine.",

            "text": "Because of its close relatedness with the predominant isolates of G2b in China and other countries, we chose the S protein of SH2012 for use in vaccine development. We initially constructed the rVSV plasmid with the full-length PEDV S gene; however, no replication-competent rVSV was rescued. Next, we generated rVSV plasmids encoding Cterminal-truncated versions of the SH2012 S protein (deletions of AA 19-26) ( Fig. 2A and B) . However, only the resulting plasmids, pVSV MT -S \u039419 , which encodes the full-length PEDV S protein except for the Cterminal 19 amino acids, was found to be capable of rescuing rVSV. The resulting virus caused typical cytopathic effects in freshly prepared BHK-21 cells and was named as VSV MT -S \u039419 . To further confirm the recovery of VSV MT -S \u039419 , RNA was extracted from a plaque-purified rVSV clone, and an RT-PCR assay was performed to amplify the S gene, which was identified via DNA sequencing (data not shown). To confirm that the S protein was indeed expressed and incorporated into VSV particles, VSV MT -S \u039419 was purified by ultracentrifugation and then analyzed by western blotting. Using convalescent sera from a PEDVinfected pig as the primary antibody, the \u223c200 kDa PEDV S protein was detected in purified VSV MT -S \u039419 but not in VSV MT . In the positive control PEDV strain CV777, in addition to the S protein (\u223c200 kDa), the N protein (\u223c55 kDa) was also detected (Fig. 2C ). Using convalescent sera from a VSV-infected mouse as the primary antibody, typical bands of VSV structural proteins L, G, N/P, as well as M were detected as previously reported (Roberts et al., 1999) in both VSV MT -S \u039419 and VSV MT but not in CV777 or mock control (Fig. 2D) . These results indicated that VSV MT -S \u039419 was successfully rescued, with the PEDV S \u039419 protein incorporated efficiently into VSV particles.",

As shown in Fig. 3 , no virus-specific antibody was detected in the control mice and pigs. However, when emulsified with Freund's adjuvants, VSV MT -S \u039419 could induce PEDV-and VSV-specific immunity via the IM route in both pigs and mice in a dose-and time-dependent manner. In the IM high-dose mouse group, the PEDV-specific VN titers peaked at 1:100 at 10 days after the second immunization, whereas the VSV-specific VN titers were 1:1200 (Fig. 3A) . Notably, although PEDV-specific VN antibodies could not be induced via the IN route by either high or low-dose live VSV MT -S \u039419 in mice, VSV-specific VN antibodies could still be detected in inoculated mice, with peak titers of \u223c1:2000 in the high-dose group at 10 days post-booster vaccination (Fig. 3A) . The humoral immune responses elicited by VSV MT -S \u039419 in pigs were examined by ELISA and neutralization assay.

To formulate a clinically useable vaccine with VSV MT -S \u039419 , the following three commercial adjuvants were tested: MONTANIDE\u2122 IMS 1313 VG NPR adjuvant (IMS 1313); MONTANIDE\u2122 ISA 206 VG adjuvant (ISA 206), and MONTANIDE\u2122 ISA15A VG adjuvant (ISA15A). IMS1313 is a nanoparticle adjuvant, ISA206 is a Water-Oil-Water emulsion, and ISA15A is an Oil-Water emulsion. Purified VSV MT -S \u039419 was separately mixed with each of these adjuvants. Each pig was intramuscularly inoculated twice, 10 days apart (days 0 and 10), at a dose of 10 7 PFU. As shown in Fig. 3C , PEDV-and VSV-specific neutralizing antibodies were effectively stimulated in pigs. After the first immunization, the PEDVspecific VN titers in the ISA15A and ISA206 groups were 1:10 and 1:40, respectively, whereas those in the IMS1313 group reached 1:80. The PEDV-specific VN titers in the ISA206 group eventually peaked at 1:200 at 30 days after the second immunization and then declined rapidly; in contrast, the PEDV-specific VN titers in the IMS1313 and ISA15A groups each reached 1:200 and maintained this level until 30 days after the second immunization. Sera IgG levels in pigs vaccinated with VSV MT -S \u039419 emulsified with IMS1313 were positive at only 10 days after the first immunization, with an S/P value that was significantly higher than those of the other adjuvants (p < 0.01) (Fig. 3C ). In addition, no adverse reaction was observed at the injection sites when IMS1313 was used as the adjuvant, whereas adverse effects on the skin occurred in some pigs when using ISA206 or ISA15A as adjuvants (data not shown). Together, these results indicated that IMS1313 is suitable for use as an adjuvant for future studies on this vaccine.",

The phylogenetic tree, which includes classical strains, global emerging strains, and epidemic strains in China, was constructed by using MEGA 7.0 with the neighbor-joining (NJ) method. Bootstrap resampling (1000 replications) was performed, and bootstrap values are indicated for each node. The TGEV strain (accession number DQ811785) was set as the out-group. the mock-challenge control. All the piglets were monitored daily until 10 days post-challenge (dpc) for clinical symptoms, fecal grade, body weight, and mortality. PEDV RNA was extracted from daily rectal swabs of piglets and assessed by RT-qPCR. As shown in Fig. 5 , following the challenge with SH 2012, the body weights of piglets from mock-vaccination sows dropped \u223c30% at 4 dpc, to a level that is significantly lower than that of the other two groups (p < 0.05) (Fig. 5A) . Severe watery diarrhea with vomiting could be observed in these animals, with clinical scores reached as high as 4. Virus shedding in their feces was confirmed by RT-qPCR, with the Ct values reaching as low as 12 at 2 dpc and remaining less than 15 at 4 dpc; these levels were also significantly lower than those in the other two groups (Fig. 5D ) (p < 0.01).

Challenged piglets from vaccinated sows had mild diarrhea beginning at 2 dpc, with clinical scores around 2.5. However, at 9 dpc, no watery diarrhea was observed in these animals (Fig. 5C) . Additionally, reduced virus shedding was observed in piglets from vaccinated sows following oral challenge, with the mean Ct value increasing from 15 to 30 between 2 and 10 dpc (Fig. 5D ).

It had a high mortality of almost 100% in infected neonatal piglets and caused a serious clinical disease with symptoms such as watery diarrhea in nursing pigs and sows. An antigenic analysis showed that the major differences among various G1 and G2 genotype PEDV strains were mainly located within the S1 region, especially within the NTD domain. A phylogenetic analysis based on the S gene indicated that SH2012 maps into the G2b subtype. Additionally, an analysis of the S protein amino acid sequences further confirmed its close relationship to other emerging strains of G2b PEDV, including AH 2012, which is considered to be the origin of the PEDV strains that have caused large-scale outbreaks in the USA since 2013 (Huang et al., 2013) .

            "text": "Presently, one of the major hurdles for PEDV vaccine development is that isolating PEDV in cell culture has proven fastidious and timeconsuming, and an isolated virus may still be incapable of retaining infectivity upon further in vitro passage. Because of these issues, Gerdts et al. claimed that research on next-generation vaccines, such as subunit and viral-vectored approaches, is critical for the prevention of future outbreaks of emerging coronavirus diseases (Gerdts and Zakhartchouk, 2017) . Hain et al. has developed a recombinant parapoxvirus as the vector to express S protein (Hain et al., 2016) . Recombinant VSV is a promising vaccine vector for expressing foreign antigens, and has been used as the platform for construction of human vaccines, such as the well-known VSV-based Ebola virus vaccine (Regules et al., 2017) . It has been shown that the cytoplasmic tail of coroanvirus spike protein can play key roles for its incorporation into VSV particles (Schwegmann-Wessels et al., 2009) . In our study, full-length S gene of SH2012 was initially cloned into genome of highly attenuated VSV MT , with the aim of making mucosal vaccine based on replication-competent VSV for pigs. However, no rVSV MT -S FL recovery was observed. Both PEDV and TGEV belong to Alphacoronavirus genus within the Coronaviridae family. A tyrosine-based motif (YxxI) within cytoplasmic tail of TGEV spike protein can lead to its intracellular retention and thus interfere with its incorporation into VSV particles (Schwegmann-Wessels et al., 2004) . Deletion of the YxxI motif results in successful recovery of recombinant VSV pseudotyped with truncated TGEV S (S \u039414 ) (Schwegmann-Wessels et al., 2009) . It is noteworthy that there is a conserved dibasic motif of KxHxx within PEDV S cytoplasmic tail (KVHVQ), which can also lead to retention of S protein to the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=Shirato%20K %5BAuthor%5D&cauthor=true&cauthor_uid=21840351, Shirato et al., 2011) . As shown by Hou et al., the YxxI and KxHxx motifs within PEDV S tail can synergistically regulate its expression on cell surface (Hou, et al., 2019) . Consequently, as with TGEV S, the failure of fulllength PEDV S incorporation into VSV particles might also be due to its intracellular retention, rather than presence at the plasma membrane, where VSV should be assembled by a budding process. Thus\uff0cto remove the YxxI and KxHxx motifs, we generated rVSV MT plasmids expressing S mutants with 19-26 AA of the cytoplasmic domain deleted ( Fig. 2A and B) . The resulting plasmid pVSV MT -S \u039419 , which encodes S except for its C-terminal 19 amino acids, achieved successful rescue, whereas the other constructs (S \u039420-26 ) failed. The results suggested that, some structural features within the truncated S protein, such as an optimal length of the truncated cytoplasmic tail, might also be essential for its incorporation into VSV particles even though the intracellular retention signals have been removed. However, the detailed mechanism still need clarification in future study. Notably, although inserted with a large-sized foreign protein, VSV MT -S \u039419 still could replicate as efficiently as its parental virus VSV MT in vitro, with the maximum titer Data are presented as means \u00b1 SD. Statistical analyses were conducted using a one-way ANOVA, and significant differences between means were determined using Duncan's multiple range tests. **statistically significant at the 0.01 level when the mean of the IMS1313 VG group was compared with the means of the ISA15A VG and ISA206 VG groups.

Together with the advantages that BHK21 cells can grow in suspension in disposable bioreactors at cell concentrations higher than 1 \u00d7 10 7 cells/mL (Genzel, 2015) , recombinant VSV could be an ideal platform for conveniently preparing vaccines against emerging or reemerging PEDV. At present, it is still difficult to construct recombinant PEDV using reverse genetics. However, with helps by VSV-based PEDV S protein, epitopes, especially conformational epitopes on S protein might be mapped accurately, even to the level of single amino acid. In addition, the role of S protein in loss of cross-protection between G1 and G2 genotypes isolates might also be identified with the technique.",

            "text": "Foreign antigens delivered by live VSV vector via IN route of immunization have been shown to be capable of inducing mucosal immunity against enteroviruses, like enterovirus coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3), in mice (Wu et al., 2014) . However, the induction of mucosal immunity in this manner has not yet been confirmed in a natural host of VSV, such as pigs. Here, we hypothesized that VSV MT -S \u039419 could also stimulate PEDV-specific gut immunity in pigs when administered via the IN route. Our observation of robust VSV-specific humoral immune responses following immunization suggest that the administered VSV MT -S \u039419 replicated in the nasal mucosa. However, to our surprise, PEDV-specific humoral responses could not be detected. The reason for the failure of VSV MT -S \u039419 to stimulate PEDV-specific antibodies when administered via the IN route still needs clarification; it is possible that the S protein was not expressed in tissue cells or not successfully presented to host antigen-presenting cells, thus failing to stimulate the production of PEDV-specific antibodies. Similar results were found in a recombinant parapox virus-based PEDV vaccine, which was reported to stimulate PEDV-specific immunity when administered via the IM route but not the transcutaneous route, which is the natural infection route of parapox virus (Hain et al., 2016) . In addition, it was demonstrated that PEDV-specific immune responses could be stimulated effectively in sows immunized via the IM route with VSV MT -expressed PEDV S protein. Notably, among the adjuvants tested in our present study, the nanoparticle adjuvant IMS1313 was the most potent for formulating a VSV-based PEDV vaccine. Neutralization antibody titers, as well as serum IgG, against PEDV were positively detected as early as 10 days post-primary immunization. Furthermore, the passive transfer of antibodies from immunized sows to piglets was observed, as PEDV-specific neutralization antibodies were detected in the serum of piglets born to immunized sows following their ingestion of colostrum and milk.",

The remaining CT regions are shown in red. SS: signal peptide sequence, ET: ectodomian, TM: transmembrane domain, CT: cytoplasmic tail. (B) Construction of recombinant VSV MT expressing the PEDV S protein. The parental VSV MT genome encodes the nucleoprotein (N), phosphoprotein (P), glycoprotein (G), RNA polymerase (L), and mutant M protein (MT) that harbors three mutations (M51 deletion, V221F, and S226R). The gene for the PEDV S protein or its truncations were inserted into the cloning sites between the G and L genes of the VSV genome through XhoI and NheI restriction enzyme digestion. (C) VSV MT -S \u039419 identification with PEDV convalescent sera. 1. Protein ladder; 2. Purified VSV MT -S \u039419 ; 3. Purified VSV MT ; 4. Mock control; 5. Purified CV777.
