A date range of January 1, 2018, through June 30, 2019, was included so as to maximize identification and in-depth discussion of recent research. A total of 726 distinct manuscripts were identified upon initial search. Following review by two researchers (C.D., J.H.L.), these papers were reduced to 37 manuscripts of relevance to the current topic. These papers included three review manuscripts and 34 original research studies. We included the reviews in our analysis because they provide important insight and expert consensus as to the direction of important fields (biosecurity for live bird market workers; respiratory exposures and disease among food animal workers; and effectiveness of health and safety trainings and interventions for Latino animal workers). The 37 manuscripts were organized in an Excel spreadsheet and read by two researchers. A narrative synthesis approach was used to extract central themes, findings, and conclusions. Based on our a priori knowledge of the field and an assessment of other recent manuscripts in the literature, we identified manuscripts we believed to be of elevated significance to readers engaged in animal worker health and safety work and research, and we discuss those studies in greater detail.",

A study in Nigeria identified low prevalence of LA-MRSA among abattoir workers (1.1%) and distinguished a diversity of S. aureus spa types in the work environment, including a novel spa type (t16751) [36] . The first published study of LA-MRSA among workers and livestock in Trinidad identified a low prevalence among animals (< 1%) and no worker carriage, indicating limited transmission in this country [42] . A case study of MRSA among swine and workers on an Australian swine farm where workers were affected by skin lesions identified high odds of MRSA nasal carriage among the workers (OR 23.6) and a dose-response relationship of MRSA nasal carriage in association with duration of time spent working with pigs [41] . A study in Italy reinforced the elevated prevalence of ST398 among industrial swine (approx. 65%) and swine workers (17%) in that country and highlighted a component of the production cycle (fattening) in which workers had higher risk of exposure [40] . Cuny and colleagues assessed MRSA nasal colonization among butchers and food preparers in Germany to evaluate whether these persons with contact with raw meat were colonized with livestock-associated MRSA, and found limited evidence of colonization (< 1%) [51] .",

The authors evaluated samples collected from the farms, transport vehicles, slaughterhouses, and retail outlets, as well as fecal and nasal specimen from workers along the production process. The authors document the widespread distribution of MRSA clone ST612-CC8_t1257-SCCmec_type_IVd (2B) throughout the production cycle. They hypothesize that the multidrug resistance of this clone is mediated by mobile genetic elements, due to the similarity of resistance patterns between the human and animal specimen. The identified prevalent clone is considered both nosocomial and community-associated, highlighting the public health risks associated with the poultry industry in South Africa. This work and the study in Cameroon, detailed below, are of relevance due to the rapid intensification and expansion of industrial food animal production into Africa and the limited research to date on the public health consequences of this industrial growth.",

The remaining four cases were associated with mild disease or colonization without disease. Of note, only two of the eight cases had documented exposure to pigs, considered the main CC9 reservoir in the region. This important paper highlights two core concepts: (1) while rare in humans, CC9 may be associated with significant pathogenicity in humans, including death and (2) nosocomial or community transmission for this pathogen should be considered.

The authors conclude that a majority of these workers were exposed to endotoxin concentrations that exceed recommended guidelines (89%). Workers were also exposed to inhalable dust and ammonia at levels above guidelines. The authors also evaluated the correlation between pairs of these exposures by different dairy tasks, another novelty of this work. Lee et al. used 16s RNA amplicon sequencing to evaluate bacterial composition of dust samples recovered from households of active and former farmers recruited in the Agricultural Lung Health Study, a nested study of the Agricultural Health Study in North Carolina and Iowa [55\u2022\u2022] . Current farming was a significant predictor of the composition and diversity of house dust microbiota. Animal farming was uniquely associated with Firmicutes and Proteobacteria phyla, with Bacillaceae, Bacteroidaceae, Xanthomonadaceae, Streptococcaceae, and Lactobacillacae also identified in dust specimen from homes with animal farmers. The authors identified taxa associated with endotoxin concentration. Asthma status was not associated with bacterial diversity or composition. This paper is notable for its integration of traditional exposure assessment approaches to endotoxin and 16s RNA amplicon sequencing technology for evaluating microbiota, and for contributing detail to our understanding of household-level exposures experienced by animal workers and their families.",

While this relationship has been previously assessed in crop farmers, the identification of animal farmers as a population at risk due to shared exposures is a notable contribution of work from this year. Pouchieu and colleagues evaluated the risk of PD among both livestock and crop farmers in France exposed to pesticides in the AGRICAN cohort [60] . The crop matrix PESTIMAT was used to evaluate exposure to active ingredients and duration of lifelong use, and the implementation of this matrix again reinforces the interest in evaluating complex and realistic mixture scenarios for worker exposures. In this study, cattle workers in particular had an elevated risk of PD, with dithiocarbamate fungicides, rotenone and the herbicides diquat and paraquat identified as compounds of concern for this occupational group.",

A small study conducted in Missouri examined self-reported injury and health status among Latino immigrant workers. Their results indicated a high prevalence of workers rating their health as fair or poor, along with high prevalence of occupational injury [63] . Clouser and colleagues found that occupational injury was more likely for Latino farmworkers in the USA if they self-reported work stress, supervisor unfairness, or supervisor inability to speak Spanish [64] .

The expansion of MRSA into Africa is of particular note, as the continent has witnessed rapid intensification of food animal production and demand for industrial meat products in recent years. Given the known consequences of unregulated antibiotic usage in animal production for public health and the emergence of LA-MRSA, surveillance, and regulation of LA-MRSA in this region is a critically important direction for future research.

The incorporation of metagenomics approaches will likely mark exposure assessment studies in the future, given the relevance of these techniques in other research areas and the opportunities to shed new light on existing occupational health problems. In particular, microbiome analyses have the potential to highlight the relationship between occupational exposures and chronic conditions, such as cancers and respiratory diseases, whose etiology has remained elusive. Gene expression studies could elucidate pathways of respiratory irritation among highly exposed workers, with relevance for both the food animal workforce and also the general population. As whole genome sequencing techniques have clarified the role of zoonotic pathogens in the emergence of novel pathogens, such as livestockassociated MRSA and zoonotic influenza viruses, genetic, and genomic techniques hold significant power to clarify pathways of occupational disease for the food animal workforce.
