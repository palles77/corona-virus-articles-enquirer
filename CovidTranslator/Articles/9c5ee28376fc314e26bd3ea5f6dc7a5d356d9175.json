The ideal PCR test detects all variants of the target pathogen, including newly discovered and emerging variants, while closely related pathogens and their variants should not be detected. This is challenging as pathogens show a high degree of genetic variation due to genetic drift, adaptation and evolution. Therefore, frequent re-evaluation of PCR diagnostics is needed to monitor its usefulness. Validation of PCR diagnostics recognizes three stages, in silico, in vitro and in vivo validation. In vitro and in vivo testing are usually costly, labour intensive and imply a risk of handling dangerous pathogens. In silico validation reduces this burden. In silico validation checks primers and probes by comparing their sequences with available nucleotide sequences. In recent years the amount of available sequences has dramatically increased by high throughput and deep sequencing projects. This makes in silico validation more informative, but also more computing intensive. To facilitate validation of PCR tests, a software tool named PCRv was developed. PCRv consists of a user friendly graphical user interface and coordinates the use of the software programs ClustalW and SSEARCH in order to perform in silico validation of PCR tests of different formats. Use of internal control sequences makes the analysis compliant to laboratory quality control systems. Finally, PCRv generates a validation report that includes an overview as well as a list of detailed results. In-house developed, published and OIE-recommended PCR tests were easily (re-) evaluated by use of PCRv. To demonstrate the power of PCRv, in silico validation of several PCR tests are shown and discussed.",

Since the late nineties of the 20 th century, due to the improved sequencing techniques and high throughput sequencing machines, the number of sequences submitted to databases like GenBank \u00ae has increased exponentially. This results in an enormous increase of identified variants and quasi-species as well as sequences of newly discovered pathogens from all over the world. A few examples are the discovery of coronaviruses causing Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), Nipah and Hendra viruses, atypical pestiviruses, atypical and new serotypes of bluetongue virus, Schmallenberg virus and new variants of avian influenza viruses (Chua et al., 2000; Demmler and Ligon, 2003; Drosten et al., 2003; Hoffmann et al., 2012; Hofmann et al., 2008; Maan et al., 2011; Marcacci et al., 2018; Schirrmeier et al., 2004; van Boheemen et al., 2012; Wang, 2011; Zientara et al., 2014) .",

Favourably, PCR tests can be highly sensitive and specific, and are often designed to detect all variants of a defined family, genus or species, while not detecting closely related pathogens. In addition, PCRv can also be used to validate in silico PCR assays that differentiate between lineages, serotypes or variants. Therefore, PCR targets must be unique, and highly conserved. Nonetheless, false negative results can arise by genetic drifting or by emergence of new variants, while false positive results can be caused by new variants of closely related pathogens. It is therefore important to frequently reevaluate and, if necessary, redesign PCR tests taking sequences of newly discovered pathogen variants into account.",

In vitro and in vivo validation include testing of cultured pathogens, and field samples of defined positive and negative status. In vitro and in vivo validation for all virus variants is practically impossible and extremely costly. Even more, not every pathogen variant has been cultured or isolated, and transport and handling of pathogens could imply safety issues. In contrast, sequences are rapidly becoming available by high throughput and deep sequencing, even without culturing of pathogens. Therefore, in silico re-evaluation of validated PCR diagnostics is and will be an attractive alternative to obtain detailed insight in detection of circulating and (re-) emerging virus variants, and should be frequently executed. It will however become an increasing task due to the rapid increase of available sequences and full genome sequences of numerous species.",

This guarantees that all available sequences of the defined taxon in the database are downloaded. To generate a multiple sequence alignment (MSA) of these sequences, a full genome sequence was selected as a reference sequence. Genome segments of pathogens with a segmented genome were concatenated to serve as an artificial full length genome. If a full genome sequence was not available, a representative large sequence of the taxon was selected as a reference sequence. A prerequisite is that this partial sequence contained the full target of the PCR test being validated. In order to drastically reduce computing time, pairwise alignments were calculated for each downloaded sequence to the reference sequence by using software program ClustalW 2.1 (Larkin et al., 2007) . To correct for orientation errors in the database sequences, alignment in the reverse complement orientation was also attempted. A score was calculated using a scoring scheme as follows: match (+1), mismatch (-2), point deletion or gap (-3), every next adjacent point deletion (-2). The aligned orientation with the highest score was selected. To enable efficient alignment of large sequences, these large sequences were segmented in fragments of 10,000 nucleotides in length and individually aligned to the reference sequence and subsequently combined into one pairwise alignment. PCRv combined all individual pairwise alignments into one multiple sequence alignment (MSA), including the pairwise alignments of primers and probes. The calculation of the MSA was performed by a computer with an Intel \u00ae Xeon(R) CPU E5-1650 v2 @ 3.50 GHz processor and 16 Gb of internal computer memory. The regions corresponding to primers and probes were selected from the MSA to construct a conservation plot sorted in decreasing total number of mismatches. The in silico sensitivity was expressed as the percentage of hits with a cut-off value of a maximum of one mismatch per primer or probe.",

The integrity of the download was confirmed by calculation of the MD5 checksum and subsequent comparison with the checksum published on the FTP-website (file nt.gz.md5). PCRv processed the data stream during download by several optimizations to improve the analysis. Nucleotide code 'N' was replaced by the meaningless code 'Z', which prevents infinite number of hits by the alignment search. The data stream was unpacked and subdivided into multiple fasta formatted text files. Fasta files with a maximum size of 500 MB were sequentially numbered and stored because the NCBI nucleotide database is too large to be analysed all at once. To increase the accuracy of the alignment search (see Discussion), large sequences were fragmented in sequences of maximal 3000 nucleotides with an overlap of 50 nucleotides to prevent the loss of hits of primer or probe sequences spanning the split site. Fragmented sequences were tagged with a unique code allowing reconstruction of the original sequence. Any nucleotide database in fasta format is compatible and could be added. Flagged internal control sequences (FICS) were added to enable validation of the alignment search. FICS consisted of randomly generated sequences of 3000 nucleotides in length containing primer and probe sequences of the PCR test being validated. Primer and probe sequences were inserted in all possible combinations and orientations potentially initiating amplification ( Fig. 1 ). Multiple copies of each combination were inserted with an increasing number of randomly introduced mismatches from 0-10 in each primer and probe sequence ( Fig. 1 ). In total, ten copies of each control sequence per number of mismatches were linearly spread in each 500 MB fasta file. An alignment search was performed with the default expectancy threshold value on all fasta files using primers and probes of the PCR test as search queries and the program SSEARCH available in the FASTA sequence analysis package (Brenner et al., 1998; Pearson, 1991; Pearson et al., 2017; . PCRv produced a list of hits of the alignment search of all possible primer/probe combinations potentially leading to detectable amplicons. Hits of FICS were stored separately. The percentage of returned hits of control sequences with an increasing number of mismatches was indicative for the sensitivity and accuracy of the alignment search per 500 MB fasta file. The maximum number of returned mismatches in the control sequences was determined by use of the Spearman-K\u00e4rber method and demonstrated the validity of the computing process (Wulff et al., 2012 ). An aborted search caused by an unknown error was visible by the incompleteness of returned FICS. If the accuracy of the alignment search was not acceptable, the alignment search was repeated with a higher expectancy threshold value, which usually resulted in a longer analysis time. The specificity check was limited to a maximum of 5000 nucleotides in amplicon length and up to four mismatches per primer or probe. This limitation was however not applied to the FICS in order to",

Because of the availability of sequences of pathogens in databases, checking conservation and uniqueness of primer and probe sequences, so-called in silico validation, has become an attractive and reliable alternative to (re-) evaluate specificity and sensitivity of molecular diagnostics. Exponential expansion of available sequences, genetic drift of pathogens, and discovery of new pathogens drive the need to frequently validate established PCR tests. This, however, will also become an increasing significant effort. We automated the in silico validation process by integrating freely available software programs into a single tool named PCRv.

This strategy exponentially reduces calculation time, in particular for large numbers of sequences. Additionally, more than one reference sequence could be used to improve the generation of a MSA in case of extreme variability among a group of pathogens. The MSA is used to determine the in silico sensitivity, since this is less prone to mismatches in primers or probes (not shown). For example, sequences with numerous mismatches in one of the primers or probes will not be found by an alignment search using these primer or probe sequences as search queries. However, such sequences will be present in the MSA, see conservation plots of WNV PCR tests. Supplemented data A shows the summarised -without accession numbers -conservation plots of the three WNV PCR tests. PCRv generates a conservation plot listing all hits according to decreasing number of mismatches. Hits with the most mismatches needs attention as these could lead to false negative PCR results.

            "text": "Viral pathogens belonging to the same taxon showing an extreme variation in their sequence cannot be aggregated in one MSA using one reference sequence. Further, large scale genomic rearrangements, such as duplication, deletion, insertion, inversion, and translocation, are very common in genomes of bacterial pathogens, and will undoubtedly challenge the calculation of a MSA, if this is even possible. Currently, we are investigating alignment-free analysis methods to address these challenges. Even more, we foresee the development of a next generation in silico tool, partially based on PCRv, to find highly conserved targets for new or confirmatory PCR tests. Fig. 4 . Overview of the in silico sensitivity and specificity of several real time PCR tests at WBVR as determined by PCRv. The in silico sensitivity of PCR tests is expressed as the percentage of hits with a maximum of one mismatch per primer or probe (squares, line). The in silico specificity is expressed as the percentage of specific hits with 0 mismatches (black) and 1 mismatch per primer of probe (grey). Real time PCR tests are indicated: WNV; West-Nile virus (Eiden et al., 2010; Johnson et al., 2001) , BTV; bluetongue virus (van Rijn et al., 2012; 2013) , PPRV; peste des petits ruminants virus (van Rijn et al., 2018a) , ASHV_S4; African horse sickness virus segment 4 (van Rijn et al., 2018b) , ASHV_S5; African horse sickness virus segment 5 (van Rijn et al., 2018b) ; in-house developed assays: RVFV; Rift Valley fever virus, SGPV; sheepand-goat pox virus, EHDV-a; epizootic haemorrhagic disease virus test a, EHDV-b; epizootic haemorrhagic disease virus test b, EAV; equine arteritis virus, EBLV-1; European bat lyssa virus type 1, CSFV; classical swine fever virus, ASFV; African swine fever virus, PRV-gB; pseudorabies virus glycoprotein gene gB, PRV-gE; pseudorabies virus glycoprotein gene gE. Results of PCRv could demonstrate the need to optimize or redesign a PCR test, like for EHDV-a and AHSV_S4. Note: hits of non-natural sequences were not discarded.
