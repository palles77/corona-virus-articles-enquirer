The addition of trypsin to the media permitted the adaptation of human and bovine astroviruses to cell culture (Lee and Kurtz, 1981; Aroonprasert et al., 1989) . The morphology of each astrovirus isolate is similar (Fig. 173) . Herring et al. (1981) reported on the purification and characterization from gut contents of ovine astrovirus. The virus has a density in CsCl 2 of 1.35-1.37 g/ ml and a single-stranded RNA genome with an S value of 34 and a poly (A) tract. There are two major capsid polypeptides with a similar mol. wt. of approximately 3.3 \u03c7 10 4 . They conclude that astroviruses must be considered a separate group with a polypeptide composition intermediate between the Picornaviridae and Caliciviridae. In contrast, the human astrovirus has four polypeptides, suggesting a classification in the Picornaviridae. It is stable at pH 3 and in chloroform (Kurtz and Lee, 1987; Aroonprasert et al., 1989) .",

In the opinion of these authors astrovirus does not cause a clinical syndrome in calves, and for this reason the virus has not been studied extensively. However, studies in the USA have shown that although gnotobiotic calves infected with astrovirus do not develop clinical illness, cytopathic changes are observed in the dome epithelium of the Peyer's patches (Woode et al., 1984 (Woode et al., , 1985 . Experimentally, infection is transmissible by the fecal-oral route. Virus infectivity persists several years at 4\u00b0C in fecal contents and at least 6 months as a 25% suspension of feces in phosphate buffered saline. Serological surveys for bovine astrovirus infection in the UK and USA reported 27% and 31% of sera, respectively, to be antibody positive (Woode and Bridger, 1978; Woode et al., 1984 Woode et al., , 1985 .

Most of the M cells of the dome epithelium are positive in immunofluorescence for astrovirus antigen. The tips of most domes are covered by cell debris containing swollen and degenerated epithelial cells, mononuclear cells and eosinophilic cells. Other domes are covered by flat to cuboidal epithelium. The Peyer's patches associated with infected domes show central cellular depletion and contain large cells with dark nuclei and eosinophilic cytoplasm. Ultrastructurally the virus is observed in both M cells and enteroabsorptive cells of the dome epithelium; its mean diameter is 30 nm.",

The virus was isolated from 8 to 17 lambs and probably spread by the fecal-oral route. Experimentally there is an incubation period of 2-3 days before virus is excreted in the feces, and this coincides approximately with the onset of diarrhea or softening of the feces (Snodgrass and Gray, 1977) .",

These viruses are probably widespread in nature, with perhaps each animal species possessing a population unrelated antigenically to astroviruses of other species, and different serotypes being common for each species.
