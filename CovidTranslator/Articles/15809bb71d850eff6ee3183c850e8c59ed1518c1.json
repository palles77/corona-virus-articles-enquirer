The nucleoprotein (N), phosphoprotein (P), large protein (L), and genomic RNA constitute the ribonucleoprotein complex (RNP) as transcription and replication units. Two envelope spike glycoproteins, hemagglutinin (H) and fusion (F), are present on the surface of infectious particles and execute the process of virus attachment and cell fusion. The M protein contributes to viral assembly and maturation [1] . Measles virus was first isolated in 1954 by Enders and Peebles from a patient and the Edmonston strain was further propagated in human kidney or alantoic fluid fibroblastic cells [2] . The AIK-C measles vaccine strain was developed from the wild-type Edmonston strain through small plaque cloning in sheep kidney cells and chick embryonic cells at 32.5 \u2022 C [3, 4] . The AIK-C strain is one of the candidate vaccine strains for the Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI) to overcome maternally conferred immunity, thereby resulting in a high seroconversion rate in young infants at 6 months of age [5] [6] [7] . Over 20 million doses have been administered mainly in Japan, and no serious adverse events have been reported in post marketing surveillance.",

These biological markers have been used to validate vaccine production and some responsible genes were identified [3, 4] . The AIK-C vaccine strain was developed from the Edmonston strain and its full-length sequence was reported, in which 31 amino acid substitutions were found relative to the Edmonston wild-type [8] . The recent development of molecular genomic analysis has allowed reverse genetics to be performed in order to generate the infectious measles virus [9] . The reverse genetics of the AIK-C vaccine strain was explored to investigate the specific genome regions responsible for its unique biological characteristics. F and HA protein expression experiments revealed that Leu at position 278 of the F protein was responsible for the formation of small plaques in Vero cells and Phe at position 278 of the F protein of the Edmonston strain induced large plaques in Vero cells [10] . Infectious cDNA clones having F278Leu and F278Phe were generated: a recombinant virus having F278Leu induced small plaques, whereas large plaques were generated by a virus having F278Phe. However, this position did not influence the ts characteristics [10] .",

Inactivated vaccines principally induce humoral antibodies, whereas both humoral and cellular immune responses are induced by live attenuated vaccines. Therefore, a live attenuated vaccine has clinical benefits in addition to strong immunity: a basically single or two-dose immunization provides long-term immunity with a relatively lower cost. Clinical adverse events are more frequently observed with live vaccines than with inactivated vaccines because of the growth of the vaccine strain in the body. Numerous difficulties are associated with developing a new live vaccine by conventional procedures through consecutive passages in primary cell cultures. Immunogenicity and safety profiles are confirmed in experimental animal models. Final availability is established in a large-scale phase III clinical trial; however, the number of participants can be limited. Many effective live attenuated vaccines are known to be effective and safe through a long history of clinical use. Therefore, currently available live vaccine-based vectored vaccines are also expected to be theoretically safe and immunogenic.",

            "text": "The live attenuated measles vaccine is a more popular than the yellow fever vaccine. It induces efficient humoral and cellular immunity and its long clinical use has guaranteed its safety [20] . In addition, the measles virus theoretically replicates in the cytoplasm and there is no evidence to suggest that the genome is integrated into host DNA. Recent developments in the reverse genetics of the measles virus have allowed recombinant measles virus cDNA to be artificially manipulated, thereby, contributing to a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying virus replication, transcription, and pathogenesis. The live attenuated measles vaccine has been investigated for the recombinant virus vector besides the yellow fever vaccine. Several strains are now available throughout the world and attenuation mechanisms are supposedly different for each strain [21] . Two groups are now extensively working on recombinant measles vaccine candidates using licensed measles vaccine strains from Dr. Naim, Berna Biotech [22] [23] [24] [25] , Dr. Tangy, Pasteur Institute [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] , and others [33, 34] . Their construction strategies, targets, and experimental models are summarized in Table 1 . They targeted the unmet needs of the vaccines against HIV, SARS corona, West Nile, dengue, Nipah, chikungunya, and hepatitis C viruses. Through conventional strategy, effective live or inactivated vaccines were not developed against these targets. The targeted genome regions were inserted at the N/P, P/M, or H/L junctions. Most popular insertion site is at the P/M junction. When a heterologous gene was inserted at the N/P junction, amounts of mRNA of the P gene decreased, causing poor virus growth. Mourez et al. [31] reported a different strategy by which the F and H genome regions of the measles virus were replaced by the chimeric DNA fragment of the simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) gp160 genome fused with the cytoplasmic region of measles F protein genome, which interacted with the M protein. The immunogenicity of the recombinants was examined in transgenic mice expressing human CD46 with the deletion of the IFN-\u2423/\u2424 receptor or non-human primates. There is no proper experimental animal for evaluating immune responses for measles. Transgenic mice depleted of IFN systems are not appropriate to investigate the immunogenicity following administration of recombinant measles-vectored vaccine candidates. In our preliminary experiments, cotton rats (Sigmodon hispidus) were susceptible for measles virus infection. Measles virus genome was detected from regional draining lymph nodes and virus was isolated. Neutralizing antibodies were produced in cotton rats three weeks after immunization of AIK-C measles vaccine strain [35] .",

However, it failed to induce protective immunity and resulted in a paradoxical tragedy of increasing the severity of subsequent RSV infections [36] . Since then, many challenges were performed. The classical biological selection of cold-adapted or ts mutants or reverse genetically engineered vaccine candidates were not appropriately attenuated, and subunit vaccines of the fusion (F) or glycoprotein (G) did not provide longterm protective immunity [38] . The reasons for the serious outcome of FI-RSV were extensively investigated, and FI-RSV was found to induce a skewed Th2 response. A balanced Th1 and Th2 response is essential for the development of a RSV vaccine [38] . Therefore, livevectored vaccine candidates have been investigated using human parainfluenza, bovine parainfluenza, and Sendai viruses [38] . The measles vaccine-vectored RSV vaccine has also been reported. Mok et al. [39] reported recombinant measles virus cDNA with the insertion of RSV F at the P/M junction and Epstein-Barr (EB) virus gp350 protein at the H/L junction. The infectious virus was recovered and induced neutralizing antibodies against RSV but not against EBV.",

A cloning vector was constructed from nucleotide position 2040 of the Sac II site and at 7238 of the EcoT22I site.
