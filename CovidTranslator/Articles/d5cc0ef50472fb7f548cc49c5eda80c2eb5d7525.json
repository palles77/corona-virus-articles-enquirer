            "text": "Ethnopharmacological relevance: Qing Dai, a famous traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), is prepared by a traditional fermentation process with the aerial part of Strobilanthes cusia. Currently, this TCM could treat various clinical inflammatory diseases, such as ulcerative colitis and psoriasis, however, the bioactive components of Qing Dai are unknown clearly. Aim of the study: To isolate and identify the anti-IL-17A components of Qing Dai. Materials and methods: Silica, RP-18 gels, and size exclusion resin were used for column chromatography to isolate the pure compounds. The structures of isolates were elucidated by NMR, MS, UV, IR spectra, and optical rotation. IL-17A protein and gene expressions were also evaluated in the Th17 cell model and luciferase reporter assay, respectively. Results: Two indole alkaloids, including one new indigodole D and cephalandole B, were isolated from Qing Dai. Indigodole D could inhibit IL-17A protein production during the Th17 polarization (EC 50 : 2.16 \u03bcg/mL) or after the polarization (EC 50 : 5.99 \u03bcg/mL) without cytotoxicity toward Th17 cells. Cephalandole B did not inhibit the IL-17A protein secretion. Nevertheless, both isolates notably inhibited IL-17A gene expression, especially cephalandole B, in a dose-dependent manner in Jukat cells with IL-17A luciferase reporter. Conclusions: Indole alkaloids, indigodoles A, C, D, tryptanthrin, and indirubin could contribute to anti-IL 17A properties of Qing Dai. The possible biogenetic mechanisms of above-mentioned indoles were also speculated in this investigation for further promising anti-IL-17 lead drugs development.",

Currently, this TCM could treat various clinical inflammatory diseases, such as ulcerative colitis and psoriasis (Naganuma, 2019; Sugimoto et al., 2016) . The aerial part of Strobilanthes cusia (Nees) Kuntze (Acanthaceae) recorded in Taiwan Herbal Pharmacopeia is the one of candidate materials that have been used to manufacture Qing Dai (Lee et al., 2019; Lin, 2016) . The crude extracts and pure phytochemicals of S. cusia leave (Da-Ching-Yeh or Nan-Ban-Lan-Yeh) and root (Na-Ban-Lan-Gen) showed many pharmacological properties, including antiviral (anti-herpes simplex virus type-1, anti-influenza A virus), antisevere acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), antifungal, anti-inflammatory, antinociceptive, and antipyretic effects (Feng et al., 2016;  https://doi.org/10. 1016/j.jep.2020.112772 Received 3 September 2019; Received in revised form 5 March 2020; Accepted 15 March 2020 Gu et al., 2015; Ho et al., 2003; Honda and Tabata, 1979; Tanaka et al., 2004; Zhou et al., 2017) . To date many secondary metabolites, such as alkaloids, terpenoids, flavonoids, sterols, lignans, phenylethanoids, and isocoumarin have been isolated from this species (Feng et al., 2016; Gu et al., 2015; Honda and Tabata, 1979; Tanaka et al., 2004; Zhou et al., 2017) . However, interleukin 17 (IL-17) inhibitions of S. cusia and its processed drug, Qing Dai are not known. Qing Dai could provide a highly effective approach for not only psoriasis (topical use), but inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) (oral use) in modern clinical therapy (Lee et al., 2019; Sugimoto et al., 2016) . In addition, Qing Dai ointment could significantly reverse the IL-17A gene expression in psoriatic skin lesions in our previous studies (Cheng et al., 2017) . Therefore, Qing Dai and its anti-IL-17 components are interesting for us and this TCM is needed to clarify the active phytochemicals for further clinical application. Our previous investigation indicated that indole alkaloids could contribute to anti-IL-17 properties of Qing Dai that was prepared from the aerial parts of S. cusia (Lee et al., 2019) . Continuing studies on bioactive constituents of Qing Dai resulted in isolation of two compounds; besides, their IL-17 inhibitory effects and possible biogenetic pathways of active components were also discussed within.",

Those active components were applied to chemical profile analyses using HPLC/PDA chromatograms. As shown in Fig. 7 , the HPLC chemical analysis of this TCM methanolic extract indicated active compounds 1-6 at retention times of 21-27 min (Table S1) . For the co-treated experiment, CD4 + T cells were cultured for five days with or without compound 2 in the skewing medium during Th17 cell polarization. After five days, cell viability was measured by staining with 1 \u03bcg/mL propidium iodide (A). The IL-17 secreting cells were stained with anti-CD4 Ab and anti-IL-17 Ab and then analyzed by flow cytometry (B). For the post-treated experiment, the polarized Th17 cells were treated with or without compound 2 for 16 h. After incubation, cells were restimulated with PMA and ionomycin for 5 h, and then cell viability was measured by staining with 1 \u03bcg/mL propidium iodide (C). The IL-17 secreting cells were stained with anti-CD4 Ab and anti-IL-17 Ab and then analyzed by flow cytometry (D). The data shown are representative of three independent experiments.

Compounds 1 and 2 inhibited the IL-17 gene expression in the IL-17 luciferase reporter assay. IL-17Luc cells were stimulated with PMA and ionomycin, and co-treated with DMSO or indicating compounds for 5 h. Then the activity of luciferase in the transfected cells was measured with the microplate reader. Vector was control vector (pGL4.18) transfected cells. IL 17A was IL-17 promoter-luciferase gene (pGL4-hIL-17prom) transfected cells. P + I: PMA and ionomycin. The data shown are representative of three independent experiments.

In this study, two indole alkaloids, including new indigodole D (1), were obtained from Qing Dai and both isolates showed inhibition against IL-17A gene expression, especially 1 also showed dose-dependent inhibition on IL-17A protein production. Besides, indole alkaloids indigodole A, indigodole C, tryptanthrin, and indirubin could contribute to the anti-IL-17A properties of Qing Dai as well. The possible biogenetic mechanisms of above-mentioned indoles were also speculated by us and could provide valuable information for medicinal chemists to make more active Qing Dai indole analogues. Structure-activity relationships and IL-17 mechanism of action will be needed to further evaluate and clearly clarify for further clinical application.",

The MS and NMR data of 1 were similar to those of indigodole A(Lee et al., 2019), except that 1 has an ethyl moiety instead of methyl group in indigodole A. On the basis of HMBC [\u03b4 H 0.74 (H 3 -2\u2034)/\u03b4 C 27.7 (C-1\u2034) and 82.9 (C-2), \u03b4 H 2.15, 2.38 (H 2 -1\u2034)/\u03b4 C 7.6 (C-2\u2034), 74.2 (C-2\u2033), 82.9 (C-2), and 199.9 (C-3)] and COSY correlations [\u03b4 2.15, 2.38 (H 2 -1\u2034)/0.74 (H 3 -2\u2034)], the ethyl group was assigned at C-2 (\u03b4 82.9)(Fig. 2). In the HMBC spectrum, the methyl protons at \u03b4 0.67 (3H, d) exhibited 2 J interactions with C-1\u2034\u2032 (\u03b4 52.1) as well as 3 J interactions with C-2\u2033 (\u03b4 74.2) and C-2\u2032 (\u03b4 85.9). Additionally, the methine proton \u03b4 3.64 had HMBC correlations with C-2\u2032\u2032\u2032\u2032 (\u03b4 7.3), C-2\u2033 (\u03b4 74.2), C-2\u2032 (\u03b4 85.9), C-3\u2033 (\u03b4 197.4), and C-3\u2032 (\u03b4 200.3). These and other key HMBC connections are shown inFig. 2. The NOESY spectrum showed the correlations of NH-1\u2033/H 3 -2\u2032\u2032\u2032\u2032 and H-1\u2033\u2032\u2032/ NH-1\u2032, H 2 -1\u2034(Fig. 3) and the relative configurations of 1 were temporarily determined as \u03b2-NH-1\u2032, \u03b1-NH-1\u2033, \u03b2-CH 2 -1\u2034, and \u03b1-CH 3 -2\u2032\u2032\u2032\u2032.
