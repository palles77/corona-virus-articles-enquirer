            "text": "The aldehyde inhibitor Z-Ala-Ala-Phe-CHO has been synthesized and shown by 13 C-NMR to react with the active site serine hydroxyl group of alpha-chymotrypsin to form two diastereomeric hemiacetals. For both hemiacetals oxyanion formation occurs with a pK a value of~7 showing that chymotrypsin reduces the oxyanion pK a values b\u1ef9 5.6 pK a units and stabilizes the oxyanions of both diastereoisomers by~32 kJ mol \u22121 . As pH has only a small effect on binding we conclude that oxyanion formation does not have a significant effect on binding the aldehyde inhibitor. By comparing the binding of Z-Ala-Ala-Phe-CHO with that of Z-Ala-Ala-Phe-H we estimate that the aldehyde group increases binding~100 fold. At pH 7.2 the effective molarity of the active site serine hydroxy group is~6000 which is~7\u00d7 less effective than with the corresponding glyoxal inhibitor. Using 1 H-NMR we have shown that at both 4 and 25\u00b0C the histidine pK a is~7.3 in free chymotrypsin and it is raised to~8 when Z-Ala-Ala-Phe-CHO is bound. We conclude that oxyanion formation only has a minor role in raising the histidine pK a and that the aldehyde hydrogen must be replaced by a larger group to raise the histidine pK a N 10 and give stereospecific formation of tetrahedral intermediates. The results show that a large increase in the pK a of the active site histidine is not needed for the active site serine hydroxyl group to have an effective molarity of 6000.",

            "text": "The rate-limiting step in peptide catalysis by the serine proteases is thought to be either formation or breakdown of a tetrahedral intermediate formed by the addition of the hydroxyl group of the catalytic serine to the carbonyl carbon of the peptide bond being hydrolysed. The tight binding of aldehydes to the cysteine protease papain was attributed to the formation of a thiohemiacetal by the addition of the thiolate ion of the catalytic cysteine to the carbonyl of the peptide bond being hydrolysed analogous to the tetrahedral intermediate formed during catalysis [5] . Similar proposals were made when aldehydes were found to be potent inhibitors of the serine protease elastase [6] . Using 1 H-NMR indirect evidence for hemiacetal formation with the serine protease chymotrypsin was obtained using saturation transfer [7] [8] [9] . Direct observation of a hemiacetal signal was reported using 19 F-NMR with N-Acetyl-p-fluorophenylalinals and \u03b1-chymotrypsin [10, 11] . 13 C-NMR studies of the aldehyde inhibitor Acetyl-Phe-CHO binding to \u03b1chymotrypsin have shown two hemiacetals are formed [12] . 13 C-NMR has shown that the aldehyde inhibitor leupeptin (N-Acetyl-Leu-Leu-Leu-Arg-CHO) also forms two diastereomeric hemiacetals with trypsin [13] . However, with Acetyl-Leu-Phe-CHO it was reported that only one hemiacetal signal was observed [14] . The fact that only small changes (\u22644 fold) in K i values have been observed from pH 3-8 when aldehyde inhibitors bind to chymotrypsin, has led to the suggestion that the hemiacetal formed with chymotrypsin remains neutral from pH 3-8 [11, 15] . Likewise, the fact that the chemical shifts of the hemiacetals observed with Acetyl-Phe-CHO [12] or Acetyl-Leu-Phe-CHO [14] did not titrate significantly at pHs N 7 has been used to support the suggestion that the hemiacetals are neutral from pH 3-8. However, with trypsin the hydroxy groups of both the diastereomeric hemiacetals formed with leupeptin and Acetyl-Leu-Phe-CHO ionized showing oxyanion formation with pKa values of 4.69 and 5.67 [13] . We have also shown that there is oxyanion formation (pKa~5) in chymotrypsin glyoxal inhibitor complexes formed with Z-Ala-Ala-Phe-COCHO (Scheme 1D) [16] . Therefore in this study we use 13 C-NMR to determine whether there is oxyanion formation in the corresponding chymotrypsin-aldehyde inhibitor complexes formed with Z-Ala-Ala-Phe-CHO (Scheme 1C) from pH 3 to 11. This allows us to compare how chymotrypsin stabilizes oxyanion formation in hemiacetals and hemiketals [16, 17] .",

The signal at 38.7 ppm is due the d 6 = DMSO (1.8% (v/v)) used to make the inhibitor stock solution and the signal at 91.2 ppm (J CH 163.4 Hz) (Fig. 1c ) is due to a small excess of the inhibitor (Fig. 1a) .

A hydrate cannot form diastereoisomers and would only give one NMR signal. Therefore the fact that we observe two 13 C-NMR signals confirms that two diastereomeric hemiacetals have been formed and that the inhibitor is not bound as a hydrate.

K H1 is calculated by dividing K H1(obs) (K H1(obs) = [hemiacetal] / [aldehyde]) by the molarity of water.

The total titration shift of 3.44 ppm is similar to that of 3.53 ppm observed for formation of the hemiketal oxyanion with the corresponding hemiketal formed by the glyoxal inhibitor Z-Ala-Ala-Phe- 13 COCHO reacting with chymotrypsin (Table 3) . Therefore the titration shift is assigned to formation of the hemiacetal oxyanion when Z-Ala-Ala-Phe-CHO forms a hemiacetal with chymotrypsin. Ionization of the isoleucine-16/aspartate-194 ion pair causes a conformational change which inactivates chymotrypsin [19, 24] . The binding of ligands and or chemical modification of the active site serine hydroxyl is known to raise the pKa of the isoleucine-16/aspartate-194 ion pair to a value of 10.5-11.0 [16, 19] and so we assign the pKa of 10.65 to ionization of the isoleucine-16/aspartate-194 ion pair. The smaller signal at 99.2 ppm (Fig. 1c) titrated with a similar pKa of 7.0( Fig. 2C ) but the titration shift (\u03b4 2 -\u03b4 1 ) was smaller (Table 3 ).",

This shows that chymotrypsin is stabilizing the hemiacetal oxyanion of both diastereoisomers by similar amounts. In order to quantify this stabilization we need to determine the hemiacetal pK a in the absence of enzyme stabilization. This can be done using free energy relationships [25] . The pK a of ZAAF-13 COOH (Scheme 1B) was determined by 13 C-NMR to be 3.52 \u00b1 0.03. Using the relationship \u03c3* = (4.644-pKa)/1.7 [26] for ZAAF-COOH the substituent constant, \u03c3* = 0.66 for the substituent ZAAF\\. The substituent constant for EO\\ is 1.68 [27] and using these \u03c3* values and the relationship pK a = 15.9-1.42 \u03a3\u03c3* [28] we estimate that the pK a of the oxyanion of the hemiacetal formed when chymotrypsin and Z-Ala-Ala-Phe-CHO react will be 12.6. Therefore chymotrypsin has lowered the pK a of the larger hemiacetal-1 (Fig. 1c ) by 12.6-7.0 = 5.6 pK a units and the pK a of the smaller hemiacetal-2 (Fig. 1c) by a similar amount ( Table 4 ).

            "text": "In chymotrypsin signals at~18 and~13 ppm have been assigned to the N\u03b41 and N\u03b52 protons of the positively charged imidazolium ring of histidine-57 and the signal at~15 ppm has been assigned to the N\u03b41 proton of the neutral imidazole ring [16, [29] [30] [31] [32] . In the glyoxal complex of \u03b1-chymotrypsin with Z-Ala-Ala-Phe-COCHO the signals at~18 ppm and~13 ppm are present at both low and high pHs at 25\u00b0C demonstrating that the binding of the glyoxal inhibitor has raised the pKa of the active site histidine to a value N 11 [16] . In contrast, in the aldehyde complex of \u03b1-chymotrypsin and Z-Ala-Ala-Phe-CHO the signals were barely discernable at 25\u00b0C (Fig. 3A) and they were similar to those observed from free \u03b1-chymotrypsin under the same conditions (Fig. 3B) . However, at 4\u00b0C the signals at 17.9 ppm and~13.0 ppm were clearly visible at low pH, both in the presence (Fig. 3C1) and absence (Fig. 3D1 ) of Z-Ala-Ala-Phe-CHO. Unlike with the analogous glyoxal inhibitor [16] these signals disappeared on increasing the pH and were replaced by a single large signal at 14.7 ppm at pHs N 9.4 and 4\u00b0C (Fig. 3C8 ). This signal (Fig. 3C8 ) was similar to those observed with free \u03b1-chymotrypsin at 4\u00b0C (Fig. 3D8) . These signals were barely visible at 25\u00b0C (Fig. 3A8,B8 ). This shows that there is more exchange broadening with the aldehyde inhibitor compared to its glyoxal analogue. Therefore the exchange rates are faster with the aldehyde inhibitor than with the glyoxal inhibitor. It also shows that with the aldehyde inhibitor the histidine pKa must be in the range 5-9. These spectra and the glyoxal inhibitor spectra were obtained using the Watergate W5 pulse sequence [20] . The 1331 water suppression pulse sequence [21] is effective over a smaller chemical shift range of 14-20 ppm, but it is more effective at detecting exchange broadened signals [14] . Therefore we have used the 1331 pulse sequence to follow the ionization of the imidazolium ion of histidine-57 by the pH titration of the N\u03b41 proton from~18 to~15 ppm in the presence and absence of Z-Ala-Ala-Phe-CHO at 25 and 4\u00b0C (Fig. 4) . From the pH dependence of the chemical shifts of the H-bonded protons (Fig. 5 ) the histidine-57 pK a values in free chymotrypsin and in the Z-Ala-Ala-Phe-CHOchymotrypsin complex were 7.32 \u00b1 0.18 (Fig. 5D) and 7 .97 \u00b1 0.20 (Fig. 5C ) respectively at 4\u00b0C. Similar values of 7.35 \u00b1 0.09 and 7.87 \u00b1 0.18 were obtained for the free chymotrypsin (Fig. 5B ) and the Z-Ala-Ala-Phe-CHO-chymotrypsin complex (Fig. 5A) respectively at 25\u00b0C. The histidine pK a value for the free enzyme is similar to the values of 6.7 and 7.5 reported for \u03b1and \u03b4-chymotrypsin respectively [16, 32] . The increase in the histidine pK a from 7.3 to 7.9 on adding Z-Ala-Ala-Phe-CHO to \u03b1-chymotrypsin contrasts with the observed decrease in the histidine pKa to 6.5 when Acetyl-Leu-Phe-CHO binds to \u03b1-chymotrypsin [14] .",

The potency of this inhibition is usually attributed to the ability of the aldehyde group to react with active site serine hydroxyl group to form a hemiacetal that mimics the tetrahedral intermediate formed during substrate catalysis [6, 15] . The fact that the aldehyde group of ZAAF-CHO is readily hydrated (K H1obs = 13.9) illustrates how readily hydroxyl groups react with aldehyde carbonyl carbon to give a tetrahedral species. However, solvent water hydroxyl groups compete with the enzymes catalytic serine hydroxyl decreasing the concentration of the non-hydrated aldehyde group which reacts with hydroxyl group of the catalytic serine residue. Therefore the observed K i values are normally corrected to allow for this using K iobs = K i (1 + K HYD ). In our case the K i value for ZAAF-CHO would be decreased by a factor of 14.9 to 0.11 \u03bcM. For ZAAFCOCHO we have shown that the active site serine hydroxyl group of chymotrypsin reacts with the keto carbonyl of the glyoxal group which has a lower K H1obs = 1.58 therefore the observed K i will only be reduced by a factor of 2.58 to 0.14 \u03bcM which is similar to the corrected K i value of 0.11 \u03bcM obtained with the aldehyde inhibitor. Therefore the fact that glyoxal inhibitors are bound~4 fold more tightly than the corresponding aldehyde inhibitor is due to the fact that with the glyoxal inhibitors hemiketal formation occurs at the less effectively hydrated keto carbon as opposed to the more heavily hydrated aldehyde carbon.",

X-ray crystallographic studies of aldehyde inhibitors binding to serine proteases [14, 34, 35] has shown that hemiacetal formation is not stereospecific with aldehyde inhibitors with two diastereomeric hemiacetals being formed. One of these has the oxyanion in the oxyanion hole while in the other diastereoisomer the oxyanion points towards the active site histidine [14, 34, 35] and is hydrogen bonded to N\u03b52 of histidine-57. The oxyanion in the oxyanion hole is about 2.8 \u00c5 from the backbone amide nitrogens of serine-195 and glycine-193. However, in the other diastereoisomer the oxyanion is about 2.9 \u00c5 from the N\u03b52 nitrogen of the positively charged imidazolium ion of histidine-57. Therefore the oxyanions are in different electrostatic environments in the two diastereoisomers and so we would expect that they would have significantly different pK a values as is observed for the two diastereoisomeric hemiacetals observed in the Acetyl-Leu-Phe-CHO/trypsin complex [14] . The fact that in the Z-Ala-Ala-Phe-CHO/chymotrypsin complex the oxyanion pK a values were~7 for both diastereoisomers suggests that the oxyanions in both diastereoisomers are in similar electrostatic environments.",

            "text": "Since the binding Z-Ala-Ala-Phe-CHO raised the pK a of histidine-57 to~8 (Fig. 5) and the oxyanion pK a values of the diastereomeric hemiacetals were both~7 (Fig. 2) it is expected that the positively charged histidine residue will play an important role in lowering the oxyanion pK a to~7. The binding of Acetyl-Leu-Phe-CHO to \u03b1-chymotrypsin resulted in the formation of a hemiacetal signal at 102 ppm which did not titrate from pH 7 to 13 [14] . The chemical shift value of 102 ppm is larger than that observed (~100 ppm) when the oxyanion with Z-Ala-Ala-Phe-CHO is fully formed (Fig. 2B,C) . This suggests that the oxyanion is fully formed at pH 7 with Acetyl-Leu-Phe-CHO and so should have a pK a b 6. The histidine pK a of 6.5 in the Acetyl-Leu-Phe-CHO complex [14] shows that it should be able to stabilize the oxyanion. However, with glyoxal inhibitors the histidine pKa is raised to N 11 therefore it is clear that while aldehyde inhibitors like glyoxal inhibitors are bound tightly to chymotrypsin, they are much less effective at raising the pKa of the active site histidine in chymotrypsin. Although oxyanion stabilization is more effective with the aldehyde hemiacetal oxyanion than with the glyoxal hemiketal oxyanion ( Table 4 ) the pKa of the imidazolium ion of histidine-57 is only raised to~8 with hemiacetal formation (Table 6 ) while it is raised to N 11 with hemiketal formation in glyoxal complexes [16] inhibitor and to N 10 when peptidyl trifluoromethyl ketones [36] or peptidyl boronic acid [37] inhibitors form negatively charged tetrahedral adducts with chymotrypsin. This shows that oxyanion formation only has a minor role in raising the pKa of the imidazolium ion of histidine-57 in aldehyde inhibitor complexes. Therefore replacing the aldehyde hydrogen with an aldehyde group [16, 17] or trifluoromethylene group [38] is the major factor in strengthening the hydrogen bond between histidine-57 and aspartate-102, raising the pK a of the imidazolium ion of histidine-57 and ensuring that tetrahedral intermediate formation is stereospecific. Similar effects are expected during catalysis with substrates.",

Table 6 Titration constants from pH dependent changes in the chemical shift of the N \u03b41 proton of histidine-57 in \u03b1-chymotrypsin and in the Z-Ala-Ala-Phe-CHO/\u03b1-chymotrypsin complex at 4 and 25\u00b0C. binds [4, 22] . If the aldehyde inhibitor has only a small effect on the pK a of the active site histidine before tetrahedral adduct formation, then the fact that the effective molarity of the hydroxyl group of the catalytic serine group is only~7\u00d7 lower with the aldehyde inhibitor compared with its equivalent glyoxal inhibitor (Table 2) shows that a large increase in the pK a of histidine-57 is not required to increase the reactivity of the serine hydroxyl group for formation of the tetrahedral hemiacetal. This suggests that the expected increase in the effective molarity of the active site serine hydroxyl required for tetrahedral intermediate formation during catalysis cannot be solely attributed to a large increase in the pK a of histidine-57. Therefore we propose that the primary reason for the increase in the effective molarity of the catalytic hydroxyl when it binds substrates will be the entropic advantage achieved by optimally aligning the catalytic serine's hydroxy group with the carbonyl carbon of the peptide being hydrolysed. We conclude that a moiety larger than the aldehydic proton must be present if the pK a of the active site histidine is to be raised to a value N10 and if there is to be stereospecific formation of a tetrahedral adduct. With aldehyde inhibitors there is stabilization of the hemiacetal oxyanion with its pK a being reduced by~5.6 pK a units while the pK a of the active site histidine is only raised~0.5 pKa units. Therefore we conclude that a large increase in the pK a of the active site histidine is not required for oxyanion stabilization or for the active site serine hydroxyl group to have an effective molarity of 6000. As the active site serine hydroxyl group is expected to have a pKa~15 then we have argued [4, 16] that the large increase in the pKa of the active site histidine (i.e. pKa N 11) observed on binding glyoxal inhibitor is required for it to increase the reactivity of the serine hydroxyl group by general acid catalysis. But, with the aldehyde inhibitor there is only a small increase in the pKa of the active site histidine pKa to~8. However, the effective molarity of the serine hydroxyl group with the aldehyde inhibitor is only~7 fold smaller than that observed with the corresponding glyoxal inhibitor ( Table 2 ). This clearly demonstrates that only a small part of the high reactivity of the serine hydroxyl group can be attributed to general base catalysis by the catalytic histidine residue of chymotrypsin.",
