However, the ability of this approach to confidently reconstruct transmission trees is limited by the knowledge of the genetic diversity of viruses that exist within different epidemiological units. In order to address this question, this study investigated the variability of 45 foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) genome sequences (from 33 animals) that were collected during 2007 from eight premises (10 different herds) in the United Kingdom. Bayesian and statistical parsimony analysis demonstrated that these sequences exhibited clustering which was consistent with a transmission scenario describing herd-to-herd spread of the virus. As an alternative to analysing all of the available samples in future epidemics, the impact of randomly selecting one sequence from each of these herds was used to assess costeffective methods that might be used to infer transmission trees during FMD outbreaks. Using these approaches, 85% and 91% of the resulting topologies were either identical or differed by only one edge from a reference tree comprising all of the sequences generated within the outbreak. The sequence distances that accrued during sequential transmission events between epidemiological units was estimated to be 4.6 nucleotides, although the genetic variability between viruses recovered from chronic carrier animals was higher than between viruses from animals with acute-stage infection: an observation which poses challenges for the use of simple approaches to infer transmission trees. This study helps to develop strategies for sampling during FMD outbreaks, and provides data that will guide the development of further models to support control policies in the event of virus incursions into FMD free countries.",

These rates are estimated to range from 10 \u00c05 to 2 \u00c2 10 \u00c03 mutations per nucleotide per replication event (Thebaud et al., 2010) . As a consequence, these viruses evolve rapidly and have high degrees of genome variability, which is a constant challenge for molecular diagnosic tests, as well as for prophylaxis and control methods such as vaccines and antivirals. Nevertheless, these high evolution rates have been exploited to understand the transmission of human and animal RNA virus infections across fine spatial and temporal scales (Cottam et al., 2006; Baillie et al., 2011; Bataille et al., 2011; Cotten et al., 2013; Gray et al., 2011; Hughes et al., 2012; Li et al., 2010; Orton et al., 2013) . These studies help to increase the knowledge on virus evolution and to identify and analyse the potential origins, patterns of transmission and spread and risks of virus infections to be ready for the prediction, early detection and/or control of the disease.",

Full genome sequences of FMDV can be generated and analysed in real-time to discern the origin of outbreaks, the transmission links between infected premises, and to predict undisclosed infection to support control and eradication policies in free-without-vaccination countries (Cottam et al., 2008b; Valdazo-Gonz\u00e1lez et al., 2012) . Furthermore, these approaches have also been used to monitor the genetic evolution of FMD viruses at the finest scales: such as within an individual animal (Wright et al., 2011) transmission in experimental studies . The interpretation of these data can be enhanced by using a range of models that have been recently developed that integrate sequence data with epidemiological information (Cottam et al., 2008a; Morelli et al., 2012) . However, the practical use of these tools to confidently reconstruct transmission trees during FMD outbreaks is limited by our understanding of the genetic diversity of viruses that exist within different epidemiological units under field conditions (within-herd diversity) (Orton et al., 2013) .",

FMDV sequences from the O/EURO-SA topotype were generated and analysed from samples within each of the eight infected premises (IPs) from 10 separate locations (with individual herds/flocks of animals grazing together) confirmed in a series of FMD outbreaks that occurred in two phases (that were geographically 17 km and temporally 34 days apart). Information regarding these herds and the clinical and laboratory investigations of these outbreaks has been described previously (Cottam et al., 2008b; Reid et al., 2009; Ryan et al., 2008) . A particular focus of this work has been to consider the impact of sequencing only a single sample from each epidemiological unit upon the inferred transmission trees in order to help to design rapid and cost effective sequencing approaches that can be used in the event of FMD outbreaks, when sequencing all of the infected animals within the outbreak might not be possible.",

The MST was computed on the basis of Hamming distance trees (number of sites in which two sequences differ). The cumulative adjacency matrices record, for each possible edge (pair of premises), the number of times it occurred in the TCS transmission trees and the MSTs. These trees were further analysed by determining the frequency of all topologies obtained with the one thousand datasets and each method. For each topology, the number of edges that were not consistent with the reference tree (inferred from the TCS tree with all the 45 sequences) was determined. In order to determine genetic distance that might be expected for individual herd-to-herd transmission events in an FMD outbreak when using a single random sequencing strategy, the Hamming distance between each source and target premise, according to the reference tree, was calculated for each of the one thousand randomly generated sequence sets.

The MST approach produced fewer tree topologies (18) than the TCS approach (42).

Bayesian maximum-clade-credibility time-scaled phylogenetic tree (BEAST) generated using 45 sequenced FMDV full genomes obtained from infected animals during the 2007 outbreak in UK. Sequences from the same holdings are coloured with the same colour as follows: in dark blue, sequences from IP1b; in light and dark green, sequences from IP2b and c, respectively; in brown, sequences from IP5; in light blue and orange, sequences from IP3b and c, respectively; in purple, sequences from IP4b; in red, sequences from IP6; in pink, sequences from IP7; and in green pistachio, sequences from IP8. The analysis was undertaken using the HKY model of base substitution (gamma model of site heterogeneity), exponential relaxed molecular clock, Bayesian skyline plot, sampling 30,000 trees from 30 million generations. Uncertainty for the date of each node (95% highest posterior density -HPD --intervals) is displayed in bars. Only node labels with posterior over 0.7 are indicated. Overall, a rate of nucleotide substitution of 4.94 \u00c2 10 \u00c05 (95% HPD: 2.92 \u00c2 10 \u00c05 -7.02 \u00c2 10 \u00c05 ) per site per day was estimated. The ancestor is estimated to be on the 01/08 Fig. 1 . The sequences in yellow belonged to isolates used at the Pirbright campus during July 2007. When two or more samples within the same premise provided identical sequences, the number of samples represented is shown in brackets in the same colour than the premise to which the sequences belong to. Samples that contained sequence ambiguities are shown as larger labelled circles with the actual number of sites in which ambiguities were present. Lines in bold correspond to non-synonymous nucleotide substitutions. The two intermittent lines represent the two options corresponding to one ambiguity in one site of a virus sequence from IP5. The lines in red correspond to a nucleotide substitution causing an amino acid change (His to Arg) important for heparan sulphate binding (cell culture adaptation). Finally, the lines in blue correspond to nucleotide substitutions causing an amino acid change (Asp to Gly) associated with, but not critical for, heparan sulphate binding. In the right down square a simplified view of the tree (reference tree) was drawn.

A particular epidemiological feature of these cases was the role played by IP5 to link the two distinct phases of outbreaks that occurred during August and September. All the sequences generated from convalescent animals on this premise had phylogenetic ancestors between the two phases of the outbreaks, close to the main line of infection. An alternative hypothesis has suggested that the different phases of these outbreaks were seeded by two separate releases from the Pirbright complex (Schley et al., 2008) . However, this scenario is only possible if two unlikely events had occurred: firstly un-sampled cases on IP5 would need to have identical sequences to the node shared by IP1b and IP2b (at sites different to the closest root of IP5 sequences); and secondly, and most importantly, the six nt substitutions separating the closest source to IP1b would need to have arisen independently in the proposed second release to IP5, findings that are not supported by data from experimentally infected cattle with a FMD virus from the same lineage .",

These results provide confidence in the use of single samples and corresponding sequences to represent each epidemiological unit as a costeffective approach in FMD outbreaks. In line with general limitations of sequence analysis, these approaches and alternative analysis of these datasets using a Bayesian inference framework (modified from (Morelli et al., 2012) : data not shown) cannot resolve transmission events where genome sequences are too similar (and they may also be confounded by accumulation of nucleotide differences during chronic infection).",

Only samples from chronically infected animals were available in IP5 and acutely infected animals from the other herds were slaughtered as soon as the disease was suspected. A previous study showed that sequences obtained from probang samples were difficult to interpret since they had a high number of sites containing ambiguities, and that the phylogenetic relationship of these sequences were divergent from the main animal-to-animal transmission line . This was not the case for all the probangs processed in this study, as only one of the five sequences obtained from these probangs (with similar CT values by real-time RT-PCR (Reid et al., 2009 ) between each other) had more than two sites with ambiguities, and although sequences with ambiguities diverged in long-length branches, they shared the same ancestor within the main line of transmission together with other sequences from probangs within IP5.",

These methods are applicable in real-time during an outbreak, as they are only limited by the speed of sequencing. The computational analyses (alignment, TCS and MST) are highly efficient and well scalable, and they require only FG sequences as their input. Further support for using sequences to reconstruct transmission trees at high resolution has been generated for other RNA viruses infecting humans, such as influenza virus (Baillie et al., 2011) , hepatitis C virus (Gray et al., 2011) , HIV (Li et al., 2010) or Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) (Cotten et al., 2013) which have focussed on sequencing samples from individuals (all those available infected individuals or a representative subset of them) to determine host-to-host transmission events, or even reveal intra host infection pathways. However, the ability to resolve these events is dependent upon two factors: the sequence length (i.e. number of available substitution sites) adopted for the study, and the evolutionary rate of the pathogen. Previous transmission studies of equine influenza virus have indicated that more than one sequence per individual was considered to be required to reliably reconstruct the transmission dynamics of the outbreak (Hughes et al., 2012) . However, this study was based on comparison of only 6% of the full genome of the virus, and in other work, transmission studies based on full genome analysis of avian influenza provided data to confidently define inter-herd transmission events (Bataille et al., 2011) . This present study was based on consensus data from Sanger sequencing protocols. Future work in this area will need to accommodate next-generation sequencing data (Logan et al., 2014) using new protocols that may increase the number of sequences that can be handled and processed, as well as providing deep-sequencing data with high resolution of polymorphisms at individual sites (Wright et al., 2011) .",

            "text": "For the first time, this study describes the within-herd genetic variability of FMDV within an outbreak, and how this genetic variability affects the herd-to-herd transmission tree when sequencing one virus per epidemiological unit. These data indicate that inferred transmission trees generated using single viral sequences from epidemiological units are robust, although attention should be paid when using the sequences of samples from chronically infected animals. This study is useful to design cost-effective sampling approaches in case of FMDV epidemics and will help to develop further models to support control policies in case of exotic incursions of FMDV in FMDV free countries.

Bars were plotted including (light grey colour) and excluding (dark grey colour) the Hamming distances between the sequences of IP5 and the rest of the sequences.",
