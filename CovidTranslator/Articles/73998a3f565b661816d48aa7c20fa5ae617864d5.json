Its fast spreading to other provinces in China and overseas is very likely causing a pandemic. Since the novel coronavirus has been reported to be capable of endangering thousands of lives, it is extremely important to find out how the coronavirus is transmitted in human organs. Apart from fever and respiratory complications, gastrointestinal symptoms are observed in some patients with 2019-nCoV but the significance remains undetermined. The cell receptor angiotensin covering enzyme II (ACE2), which is the major receptor of SARS-nCoV, has been reported to be a cellular entry receptor of 2019-nCoV as well. Here, to more precisely explore the potential pathogen transmission route of the 2019-nCoV infections in the gastrointestinal tract, we analyzed the ACE2 RNA expression profile in the colon tissue of healthy adults and colorectal cancer patients of our cohort and other databases. The data indicates that ACE2 is mainly expressed in epithelial cells of the colon. The expression of ACE2 is gradually increased from healthy control, adenoma to colorectal cancer patients in our cohort as well as in the external Asian datasets.",

In December 2019, a series of unidentified pneumonia disease outbreaks was reported in Wuhan, Hubei province, China. In a subsequent pathogen identification process, 2019-nCoV (2019 novel coronavirus) was identified from the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of these pneumonia disease patients(6, 7). This virus was identified as the cause of the deadly pneumonia disease in human (7). As of Feb 11, 2020, China has reported more than 42747 confirmed and more than 21675 suspected cases of 2019-nCoV infections across 33 Chinese provinces or municipalities, with 1017 fatalities.

In addition, some patients with diarrhea were constantly diagnosed in subsequent newly discovered 2019-nCoV infected cases, which indicate that 2019-nCoV may infect people via digestive systems. Although other groups have shown ACE2 expression profile in digestive system and lung by single-cell transcriptomes bioinformatics analysis from external datasets(9, 10)\uff0c unfortunately, most data of these datasets are not from Asian adults. Therefore, to provide more implications of viral transmission in clinical diagnosis and treatment, it's urgent to explore ACE2 expression in the digestive system of Asian people.",

Following the quality control procedure, the dataset consisted of 21,686 cells expressing 22,760 genes. The filtered gene expression matrix was normalized using Scanpy's sc.pp.normalize_total function. A single-cell neighborhood graph was computed on the 50 first principal components that sufficiently explain the variation in the data using 15 nearest neighbors.

            "text": "addition to being a functional receptor for SARS-virus to enter mammal cells, ACE2 contributes substantially to the efficiency of SARS-CoV replication as well(22). Recently, 2019-nCoV was confirmed to share the same cell entry receptor, ACE2, as SARS-CoV(6). In addition, J. Byrnes et al. found that inhibition of ACE2 with GL1001, which is a selective inhibitor of this enzyme significantly reduced DSS-induced distal colon pathology, indicating that ACE2 may mediate the mucosal inflammation in DSS-induced inflammatory bowl disease (IBD) of mouse(23). Inhibition of ACE2 may increase the level of its substrates, such as gherlin and further block the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines(24). In a recent clinical report, 2019-nCoV may cause cytokine storm and multi-organ failure in severe pneumonia patients(8). Therefore, we speculates that 2019-nCoV may interact with ACE2 receptor in gastrointestinal tract, then further impair the intestinal mucous membrane barrier and increase the inflammatory cytokines production. With the intensification infection of 2019-nCoV, more inflammatory factors are produced, which eventually leads to a storm of",

ACE2 expression is much higher in epithelia cells of colorectal cancer tissues than health control, which indicates that 2019-nCoV may be more harmful to colorectal cancer patients than health control people. Understanding of the tissue tropism of 2019-CoV on intestinal cells may also help to elucidate the pathogenetic mechanism of this virus and possibly help in the development of novel antiviral therapy. Future studies have to elucidate whether the replication of 2019-nCoV is depend on ACE2 in host cells, and whether 2019-nCoV binding to a co-receptor in addition to ACE2 might be involved in the specific infection of lung, gastrointestinal tract and other organs.
