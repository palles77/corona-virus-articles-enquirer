We contrasted the binding interactions between human ACE2 and coronavirus spike protein receptor binding domains (RBDs) from (i) SARS-CoV2, (ii) the related but less virulent OC43 (Singapore COVID-19 strain), and (iii) the 2002 epidemiccausing SARS-CoV1. We find that the RBDs of the spike protein of SARS-CoV2 are highly optimized to achieve the strongest possible binding interaction with ACE2 which is consistent with its enhanced pathogenicity. SARS-CoV2 RBDs form the most stable complex with ACE2 (64.91%, and 28.07% higher binding scores than SARS-CoV1 and OC43, respectively) while occupying the greatest number of residues in the ATR1 binding site. In fact, the spike protein RBDs from SARS-CoV2 out-compete the angiotensin 2 receptor type I (ATR1) which is the native binding partner of ACE2 by 64% in terms of binding affinity (quantified using the Rosetta scoring function). They accomplish this through strong electrostatic attachments with every fourth residue on the N-terminus alpha-helix (starting from Ser19 to Asn53) as the turn of the helix makes these residues solvent accessible. These results offer a computational explanation for the increased pathogenicity of SARS-CoV2 and allude to therapeutic modalities by identifying and rank-ordering the ACE2 residues involved in binding with the virus.",

Even a single alanine mutation in any of these reduces the binding score by ~60%. These results imply that the SARS-CoV2 RBD of the spike protein are highly optimized for binding with ACE2. We note that positions Lys417 and Gly502 have the strongest impact on binding (75% and 83% reduction upon mutation to Ala, respectively). This is because they help establish one strong electrostatic contact with Asp30, and three with Gln325, Lys353, and Gly354 (as listed in Table   1 ).

We calculated that Phe486, Gln493, and Asn501 establish three new contacts each (see Table 1 for interaction partners and inter-residue distances), and their mutation to Ala (even for only one of them) leads to loss of ACE2 binding by more than ~62.5%. coronavirus.

            "text": "We reported on the differences between three viral ACE2-RBD complexes and how they exploit the contact map of RBD-binding domain of human ACE2 receptor to facilitate binding. In an uninfected cell, through the action of the renin angiotensin system (RAS), ACE2 forms a complex with the angiotensin 2 receptor type I (ATR1) 4 . Due to the lack of an experimentally resolved structure for the ACE2-ATR1 complex, we used protein-protein docking and Rosetta-binding score screening to identify the most stable configuration of the complex. Analysis of the ACE2-ATR1 binding interface reveals 41 ACE2 residues and 26 ATR1 residues at the interface connected by five strong electrostatic contacts and several long range weak electrostatic contacts. We find that eleven SARS-CoV2 RBD binding residues of ACE2 are shared by the ATR1 binding region. Moreover, SARS-CoV2 RBD binds ACE2 with ~64% better binding score than ATR1. In contrast, SARS-CoV1 show ~2.1% worse binding score with ACE2 compared to the ACE2-ATR1 complex while sharing only nine residues with the ATR1 binding interface of ACE2 (see We computationally explored the potential margin of improvement for the binding affinity of SARS-CoV2 with ACE2 using the IPRO 5 protein design software. We allowed all 21 contacting residues of the RBD of the spike protein to simultaneously mutate. We run two separate design trajectories (see The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.30.015891 doi: bioRxiv preprint supplementary information) and, in both cases the best design achieved an approximately 25% improvement in binding affinity using the Rosetta scoring function. This improvement is less than the difference between the calculated binding scores of SARS-CoV1 and SARS-CoV2 implying that SARS-CoV2 has already achieved over 50% of the theoretically possible binding affinity gain with ACE2 compared to SARS-CoV1. Interestingly, the network of glycine residues in SARS-CoV2 is conserved in all redesigned RBDs.",

OC43 RBD was isolated from the crystal structure of the whole OC43 spike (PDB: 6OHW 7 ). Similarly, unbound ATR1 structure (PDB: 4YAY 8 ) was also separately downloaded and docked against ACE2 using protein-protein docking scripts from Z-DOCK 3.0 9 . ZDOCK uses pairwise shape-complementarity, electrostatics, and implicit solvation terms in scoring the docked poses. Implicit solvation treats the water as a dielectric continuum. The rotational sampling interval was set to 10\u00b0. Clustering of the docked poses were done at an 8 \u00c5 cutoff. Subsequently, PyRosetta 10 scripts were written to rank and identify the most stable complexes from each cluster which were then energy-minimized and re-ranked. Finally, the complex which ranked high in stability and binding scores was chosen as the model. An alanine scan was again performed using PyRosetta scripts, where the computational models of the alanine variants were first generated, energy minimized, and ACE2 binding scores computed. The ACE2 interface definitions for each binding partner (RBDs and ATR1) were obtained by feeding the energy minimized protein-protein complexes through the find_contacts module of OptMAVEn-2.0 11 .",
