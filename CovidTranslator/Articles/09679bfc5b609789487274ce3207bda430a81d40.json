These domains have previously been cloned and expressed as single domain antibodies (sdAbs); they comprise the smallest known antigen binding fragments. SdAbs have been shown to bind antigens at >90\u00b0C and to refold after being denatured. To take advantage of the remarkable properties of sdAbs we constructed a large, semisynthetic llama sdAb library. This library facilitated the rapid selection of binders to an array of biothreat targets. We selected sdAb specific for live vaccinia virus (a smallpox virus surrogate), hen egg lysozyme, cholera toxin, ricin, and staphylococcal enterotoxin B. The selected sdAb possessed high specificity as well as enhanced thermal stability in comparison to conventional IgG and scFv antibodies. We also determined equilibrium dissociation constants as well as demonstrated the use of several anti-toxin sdAbs as effective capture and reporter molecules in sandwich assays on the Luminex instrument. The ability to rapidly select such rugged antibodies will enhance the reliability of immunoassays by extending shelf-life, and the capacity to function in hostile environments.",

Most rapid environmental diagnostic assays rely on monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies (IgG) as their recognition elements. These antibodies are large complex 150 kDa molecules made up of 2 heavy chains and 2 light chains with the antigen binding site formed by combinations of amino acids in both the variable (V) light and heavy domains. Their multi-domain complexity is their Achilles heel since at high temperatures >60-70\u00b0C the heavy and light chains unfold and aggregate, causing the antibody to precipitate irreversibly 13 . Furthermore, IgG are time-consuming and costly to produce, requiring large amounts of antigen to immunize animals to deliver polyclonal sera or hybridomas for monoclonal antibodies. While in vitro derived libraries of IgG fragments composed of the antigen binding arms (Fab) or V domains alone (scFv) can rapidly bypass the requirement for immunizations and high antigen concentrations 14 the final molecules are usually more unstable than an equivalent IgG. Consequently, immunoassays relying on conventional immunoglobulins or their recombinant derivatives often require refrigeration to extend shelflife and may have limited lifespan in the field before needing replacement.",

The V domains of these antibodies represent the smallest naturally occurring antigen binding domains known and have 3 (camels and llamas) or 2 (sharks) recognizable hypervariable regions or complementarity determining regions (CDRs) that mediate antigen contact and are borne on a relatively conserved scaffold of framework regions (FRs). These V domains have been cloned and expressed as 12-15kDa proteins known as single domain antibodies (sdAb) (see figure 1a ). SdAbs have been found to be inherently thermostable, with antigen binding of llama sdAbs being demonstrated at 90\u00b0C 17 , which suggests they will be well suited for long-term field applications where refrigeration is often not possible. SdAbs have also shown to be extremely plastic in that when they do eventually undergo denaturation, they are often capable of quantitative refolding 18, 19 . Such beneficial properties have already been utilized for an immunoaffinity chromatography column that withstood >2000 regenerations 20 indicating sdAb are well suited for the establishment of recyclable immunoassays.",

Since the range of germline sequences is somewhat restricted and no antigen specific in vivo affinity maturation has occurred, these libraries tend to yield \u03bcM affinity clones 24, 25 . CDRs may also be randomized during assembly of sdAb genes to confer more diversity at the antigen binding surfaces than occurs naturally to increase the probability of the libraries containing clones with higher affinities 26-28 . Once made, such \"single-pot\" non-immune libraries can be stored indefinitely and used to generate binding clones against an unlimited number of antigens since the library can be reamplified and the \"pot\" replenished with relatively simple techniques. However, the dual role that several CDR3 amino acids play in both antigen binding and structural interaction with neighboring FR residues, can make it difficult to expand antigen binding diversity using typical CDR randomization strategies without losing sdAb ruggedness unless consideration is paid to each and every position 29 .",

Our approach was geared towards having sufficient antigen binding diversity yet retaining ruggedness. First, we gently diversified the CDR and local framework amino acid sequences by error prone PCR. Second, we spliced these sequences together through the common FR overlaps to randomly shuffle them. From this novel library, we could isolate sdAb proteins to a range of targets in a matter of days. Our targets included live vaccinia virus (a smallpox virus surrogate), the model protein hen egg lysozyme (HEL), and the toxins cholera toxin (CTX), ricin, and staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB). The panel of sdAb proteins was evaluated for their target specificity and heat stability in comparison to conventional antibodies and scFv. In addition, the equilibrium dissociation constants for the toxin-specific sdAbs were determined, their ability to bind soluble target was evaluated, and their potential as both capture and recognition molecules in Luminex fluid array sandwich immunoassays was demonstrated.",

Small blood samples (6 ml) were drawn from the left jugular vein of three research na\u00efve mature llamas (1 male, 2 female) and combined with RNALater (Ambion, TX). RNA was extracted using RiboPure blood extraction kit (Ambion, TX), and cDNA synthesized using oligo-dT primed reverse transcription with a RETROscript kit (Ambion, TX). Primers for the PCR amplification of llama heavy chain only V domains were based on the findings of Ghahroudi and van der Linden and colleagues 17, 30 and were modified to allow unidirectional cloning using SfiI sites. SdAb genes were cloned into a chloramphenicol resistant open reading frame (ORF) selection vector which fuses inserts to B-lactamase and confers conditional ampicillin resistance to transformants plated on IPTG containing media. Clones were selected on media containing IPTG and ampicillin to make an initial \"megalibrary\" of approximately 10 6 sdAb ORFs which was scraped, combined with glycerol and frozen. Forty eight clones of the megalibrary were sequenced and found to be unique with diverse CDRs. Highly conserved regions within FR2 and FR3 were used to design forward and reverse primers to segment the sdAb gene. These primers in concert with primers flanking the sdAb inserts were used in error prone PCR 31 of phagemid DNA extracted from the megalibrary to amplify each segment of the sdAb insert. These segments were gel purified and used in splice overlap extension (SOE) PCR to create hyperdiversified full-length sdAb gene repertoires. The sdAb repertoire was cloned into pecan21 which is a phage display vector with the low expression capacity of pAK100 32 borne on the ampicillin resistant pMoPac10 33 . The vector has a full length gene III protein (g3p) PCR amplified from M13KO7 with two tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease cleavage sites encoded between insert and g3p to allow protease elution of phage. Approximately 10 9 individual transformants were obtained in XL1-Blue to create a \"gigalibrary\" Nomad#1. Following rescue with M13KO7 and phagemid purification 34 , the library was resuspended in PBS, combined with an equal volume of glycerol, aliquoted and stored at -80\u00b0C.",

Antibodies utilized as fluorescent reporters were labeled with Cy3 (GE Healthcare) by addition of 1 vial of Cy3 dye as supplied to 3 mg of antibody in PBS with 1/2 volume of sodium borate + 100 mM sodium chloride pH 9.1. After 1 hour labeling at room temperature, the Cy3-labeled antibody was separated from free dye by gel filtration on a Bio-gel P10 column (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). We determined the antibody concentration and the dye-to-protein ratio (which varied between 2 to 4) by UV-Vis absorption as described by the manufacturer. Antibodies were biotinylated using NHS-LC-Biotin (Pierce) dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (1.4 g/L). The antibodies were reacted with a 5:1 molar excess of the NHS-LC-Biotin; the pH was increased by the addition of \u00bd volume of 100 mM sodium borate + 100 mM sodium chloride pH 9.1. After 1 hour at room temperature, the biotinylated antibodies were separated from free biotin by gel filtration and concentrations determined by absorbance at 280 nm.",

Starting with small blood samples taken from 3 research na\u00efve llamas, we constructed a 10 6 member mega-library of diverse sdAb open reading frames. Forty eight randomly chosen clones were sequenced and shown to have residues characteristic of heavy chain only antibodies at positions 42, 49, 50 and 52 37 . The sdAb amino acid residues at these positions compensate for the lack of a pairing to a VL domain. The sequence results indicated that the library could serve as a rich source of sdAbs. Only a single clone had an extra cysteine pair that is known to link CDR1 with CDR3, yet this has been shown to be a minor component of llama heavy chain only subfamilies 37 and is not required for thermostability and plasticity. While all of the sdAbs sequenced had unique and diverse CDR1, 2 and 3 sequences, attempts to select antigen binding clones from a phage displayed version of this initial megalibrary failed. Limited size and diversity is known to be a problem afflicting even large na\u00efve based sdAb libraries 24, 25, 38 . In the absence of an enormous diversity of germline variants and the recombinatorial diversity afforded by VH:VL pairing, affinity maturation in camelids relies to a larger extent on somatic hypermutation geared towards fine tuning the CDRs to the immunogen 39, 40 . In an effort to mimic such in vivo diversification to yield a diverse enough library capable of generating sdAb to any given antigen, we hyperdiversified the mega-library using a combination of error-prone PCR and SOE-PCR assembly of the various sequence combinations (Figure 1b) . Our strategy was aimed at trying to conserve the framework regions surrounding the CDRs which may be crucial in conserving the structural integrity of sdAb, especially for CDR3 29 . Through this unique combinatorial strategy, we created Nomad#1, a library containing over 10 9 sdAb members.",

Both LCTG3 and LSEBE3 retained specificity during the heating, showing negligible signal on the control bead sets (data not shown). We speculate that loss of activity may be due to an aggregation event perhaps nucleated by small amounts of contaminating proteins, or proteolytically nicked sdAb which is unable to refold correctly, in the preparations.

For these initial tests we utilized the sdAb as either the capture or the reporter molecule, while maintaining a conventional antibody as the assay partner. Eventually, we hope to evaluate sdAb only assays; for some targets such as SEB or ricin this will require two different sdAb each specific for a distinct epitope to establish a sandwich assay. When we utilized sdAb as the reporter molecule, we found that when combined with highly fluorescent Ni-SA-PE as secondary conjugates the resulting complex functioned as highly effective reporter molecules in sandwich assays (Fig. 6 ). When paired with goat anti-CTX, the anti-CTX sdAb LCTA9 functioned well as a reporter, detecting levels of toxin comparable to rabbit anti-CTX reporter (Fig. 6a) . Similarly, we showed the ricin binding sdAb LRE7 to be an effective reporter molecule in a sandwich assay when paired with two separate A-chain binding monoclonal antibodies, detecting ricin down to 4 ng/ml toxin (Fig. 6b) . Competition assays indicated that the 2 anti-SEB sdAbs isolated have overlapping epitopes and would not function as a pair in a sandwich assay (data not shown). We then screened available anti-SEB monoclonal antibodies to identify clones that did not overlap with our sdAb and used these as the capture motif. SEB concentrations down to 0.05 ng/ml and 0.5 ng/ml could be detected using either the LSEBE3 or LSEBG6 reporter respectively while the conventional antibody reporter Sh-anti-SEB, was able to detect 0.01 ng/ml toxin (Fig. 6c) .",

The sdAb were covalently immobilized to the luminex microsphere surface using a two step carbodiimide chemistry. This method however was found to be effective for many of the sdAb, however more orientationally directed methods maybe required for universal application. Figure 7 shows that LCTG4, LRE7, and LSEBE3 were each effective as capture molecules for their respective targets, cholera toxin, ricin, and SEB, while at the same time showing minimal cross reactivity with irrelevant toxins. The limit of detection for each of the toxins was about 130 ng/mL, a reasonable limit considering the Kds determined. While not as sensitive as conventional antibodies, the sdAb gave limits of detection that would be useful in all but trace detection scenarios. For development of sdAb only assays towards monomeric and heterooligomeric proteins such as SEB and ricin will require sdAb targeting non-overlapping epitopes for capture and detection. Detection of CTX, which contains 5 copies of the B subunit, may be possible using the same sdAb as both a capture and reporter reagent. We are assembling second generation libraries that will allow us to deliver a broader range of sdAb so that we may use them as both capture and reporter elements in sandwich assays and ruggedize the overall assay to extreme temperatures. Furthermore, we are applying in vitro evolution 26, 48 and multimerisation strategies 49, 50 to affinity mature the sdAbs isolated here to drive the limits of detection lower.",
