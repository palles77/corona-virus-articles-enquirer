The initial clinical presentation can mimic other pediatric inflammatory conditions, which often leads to significant delays in diagnosis and appropriate therapy. SJIA biomarker development is an unmet diagnostic/prognostic need to prevent disease complications. Experimental Design We profiled the urine peptidome to analyze a set of 102 urine samples, from patients with SJIA, Kawasaki disease (KD), febrile illnesses (FI), and healthy controls. A set of 91 plasma samples, from SJIA flare and quiescent patients, were profiled using a customized antibody array against 43 proteins known to be involved in inflammatory and protein catabolic processes. Results We identified a 17-urine-peptide biomarker panel that could effectively discriminate SJIA patients at active, quiescent, and remission disease states, and patients with active SJIA from confounding conditions including KD and FI. Targeted sequencing of these peptides revealed that they fall into several tight clusters from seven different proteins, suggesting diseasespecific proteolytic activities. The antibody array plasma profiling identified an SJIA plasma flare signature consisting of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP1), interleukin (IL)-18, regulated upon activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted (RANTES), P-Selectin, MMP9, and L-Selectin.",

Early treatment may reduce the risk of long-term complications and subsequent disabilities. In addition, biomarkers that distinguish intercurrent SJIA flare from infection in patients with known SJIA would be clinically useful, as would markers that predict impending disease flare or responder status to particular therapies, or provide an early indication of a treatment response. Finally, biomarkers may provide clues to unanswered questions concerning SJIA pathogenesis. Our comparative analysis of SJIA, KD, and FI urine peptidomes identified a small subset of the urine peptidome that effectively discriminates SJIA patients in the active, quiescent, and remission disease states, and also discriminates patients with active SJIA from confounding conditions including KD and FI. Urine peptide diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers could be of clinical use, especially for serial sampling of pediatric SJIA patients. Targeted sequencing revealed that these peptide markers fall into several tight clusters indicating SJIA-specific proteolytic events. Plasma cataloging analysis of the normal plasma peptidome shows that at least some of these nested peptide markers originate in the circulation. A customized antibody array was used to compare the plasma abundance of proteins known to be involved in inflammatory and protein catabolic processes, revealing a SJIA flare signature. Taken altogether, the urine peptidomic and plasma protein and peptide analyses suggest a testable model that SJIA urine peptide biomarkers may be an outcome of inflammation-driven effects on catabolic pathways operating at multiple sites.",

            "text": "Systemic onset juvenile idiopathic arthritis is a chronic inflammatory disease of childhood characterized by a combination of systemic features [fever, rash, serositis (e.g., pericarditis, pleuritis)] and arthritis. Current diagnosis of SJIA is based solely on clinical findings [1] and requires arthritis, daily fever for at least 2 weeks, and at least one of the following: evanescent erythematous rash, generalized lymph node enlargement, hepatomegaly and/or splenomegaly, or serositis. This makes early diagnosis of SJIA challenging, as its clinical manifestations are similar to other diseases, including malignancy, infection, Kawasaki disease (KD), and other autoimmune or inflammatory disorders. Long-term disease outcome in SJIA is variable. About 50% of patients experience a single episode that resolves. However, the other half experience either polycyclic or non-remitting disease. Sensitive and specific diagnostic biomarkers for SJIA would allow its differentiation from other febrile illnesses, such as KD or acute infections (febrile illness (FI)), and facilitate prompt initiation of appropriate treatment at disease onset. Early treatment may reduce the risk of long-term complications and subsequent disabilities.

Such markers would permit frequent tests, which would be of use, especially in children, for a chronic pediatric disease with a polycyclic course. A normal adult human excretes 30-130 mg of protein and 22 mg of peptides per day in urine [14, 15] . Urine proteomic analysis has identified more than 1,500 proteins including a large proportion of membrane proteins [16] . Urine peptidomic analysis revealed over 100,000 different peptides [17] . Our own in-depth 2D mass spectra (MS)/MSMS analysis led to the identification of 11,988 different urine peptide sequences from 8,519 unique protein precursors in normal human urine [18] . Recent reviews have indicated that analysis of the urinary proteome/peptidome can be highly informative for both urogenital and systemic diseases and used for disease classification [18, 19] . Naturally processed urine peptides have certain advantages over proteins as biomarkers. The roughly equal mass of protein and peptide in urine translates into at least a tenfold greater molar abundance of peptides. While the urine proteome contains a number of abundant proteins that obscure the lower abundance proteins more likely to be biomarkers, this problem does not complicate analysis of peptides in urine. A one-dimensional HPLC separation is sufficient for the analysis of greater than 25,000 urine distinct peptides.",

However, due to its limited throughput and current cost, iTRAQ is not feasible for simultaneous comparison of the large number of disease subjects needed to achieve the discovery of differential features with sufficient statistical power. As an alternative, a label-free liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS)-based approach has been applied as a quantitative biomarker discovery method. The label-free LC-MS approach can compare and quantify peptides with precision and accuracy comparable to those based on isotope labeling [21] . Although LC/ESI mass spectrometry is typically used in label-free quantitative proteomics, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-timeof-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry is increasingly being used and demonstrates low average coefficients of variation for all peptide signals across the entire intensity range in all technical replicates [22, 23] . Using the label-free LC/MALDI-TOF profiling approach, we previously discovered candidate urine peptide biomarkers of renal transplant rejection [19, 24] . Subsequent urine peptide biomarker validation [19] by multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) [25, 26] showed significant correlation between the urine peptide measurements obtained from label-free MALDI-TOF and from MRM using stable isotope-labeled synthetic marker analogues to derive absolute quantification.",

This table, reduced from LC-MS spectra of all samples, can be subjected to downstream statistical learning including transformation, normalization, and unsupervised/supervised analyses suited to the experimental design to mine for a differential subset of the P peptides, which will then be subjected to MSMS protein sequence identification and future quantitative prospective MRM [25, 26] or antibodybased validation.",

The m/z ranges were from 800 to 4,000 with peak density of maximum 30 peaks per 200 Da, minimal S/N ratio of 5, minimal area of 10, minimal intensity of 150, and 200 maximum peaks per spot. We previously had developed an informatics platform [18] which contains an integrated set of algorithms, statistical methods, and computer applications, to allow for MS data processing and statistical analysis of LC-MS-based urine peptide profiling. The MS peaks were located in the raw spectra of the MALDI data by an algorithm that identifies sites (mass-to-charge ratio, m/z values) whose intensities are higher than the estimated average background and the~100 surrounding sites, with peak widths~0.5% of the corresponding m/z value. To align peaks from the set of spectra of the assayed samples, we applied linkage hierarchical clustering to the collection of all peaks from the individual spectra. The clustering, computed on a 24-node LINUX cluster, is two dimensional, using both the distance along the m/z axis and the HPLC fractionation time, with the concept that tight clusters represent the same biological peak that have been slightly shifted in different spectra. We then extracted the centroid (mean position) of each cluster, to represent the \"consensus\" position as the peak index (bin) across all spectra. The normalization of the MALDI-TOF signal intensity for each peptide feature was performed at two steps: (1) within each LC fraction (MALDI plate spot), all peptide peak signal intensities were normalized to the externally spiked reference peptide (30 fmol/\u03bcl glu-fibrinopeptide) at each MALDI plate spot; (2) each clustered peptide, with unique m/ z and LC fraction time, was normalized to the total signal intensity of all the clustered peptides within the same sample.",

To control the number of false significant features found during NSC mining, we permuted the data set 500 times to calculate GFDR [33] .

In order to test whether the selected discriminated features could serve as a diagnostic biomarker panel, a logistic regression model was used to find a linear combination of the biomarkers that minimizes the total classification error. In order to avoid bias in data sets, we utilized a bootstrapping technique to bootstrap 500 times to evaluate the impact of the data construction on overall classification performance of the biomarker panel. For each of the bootstrapping sets, we used the LDA-derived prediction scores for each sample to construct receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves [35, 36] .

The plotted ROC curve is the vertical average of the 500 bootstrapping runs, and the box and whisker plots show the vertical spread around the average. d Distribution of the standardized ROC AUC values of the 500 falsely discovered panels upon the 500 class-label permutated data set of the cohort of SJIA F and KD/FI urine peptidomes. Examining all the 500 falsely discovered biomarker panel ROC AUC values, the number of falsely discovered same-size panels that have ROC AUC values greater than that of the original urine biomarker panel (represented by the red vertical line) dividing the total number of the \"falsely discovered\" biomarker panels led to the estimation of false discovery rate FDR Seventeen-Urine-Peptide Biomarker Panel Effectively Discriminates SJIA Flare from KD and FI In order to test whether the 17-peptide biomarkers could collectively serve as a diagnostic biomarker panel, a logistic regression model was then used to find a linear combination of the 17-peptide biomarkers that minimizes the total classification error discriminating SJIA systemic ND and SAF patients from KD and FI patients.

            "text": "As observed in other high throughput analyses, e.g., microarray expression profiling, where the number of profiled features greatly exceeds that of the assayed samples, concurrent analysis of MALDI-TOF spectral peaks to evaluate null hypotheses for differential urine peptide biomarkers leads to the multiple-testing problem. To address the multiple-hypothesis testing problem, we estimated the FDR in concurrent statistical tests of peptide panels, of the same size as our biomarker panel; multiple permutated \"random\" training data sets were constructed. The class labels of our training samples in either cohorts of SJIA F and QOM/RD, or cohorts of SJIA F and KD/FI, were permutated 500 times such that each time every sample would be randomly assigned a new class label (SJIA F or QOM/RD in F and QOM/RD discrimination; SJIA F or KD/FI in SJIA F and KD/FI discrimination). For each of the 500 simulated \"training\" sets, NSC algorithm was applied to rank all the MALDI-TOF spectral peak features based upon their ability to discriminate the binary classes: SJIA F versus QOM/RD; and SJIA F versus KD/ FI, respectively. The NSC-selected top 17-peak features were then designated as the \"panel\" for LDA analysis. ROC analysis subsequently was used to calculate the AUC for this \"falsely discovered panel\". The AUC values of the 500 falsely discovered panels were standardized, and the density distribution was plotted in Figs. 2 and 3d. FDR was calculated as the number of AUC values greater than that of our 17-urine-peptide panel divided by the total number of AUC values of the \"falsely\" discovered panels. As shown in Figs. 2 and 3d , the FDRs of our urine peptide biomarker panel are estimated as 0.2% in SJIA F versus QOM/RD discrimination, and 0.2% in SJIA F versus KD/ FI discrimination respectively. These results support the notion that the discovery of our peptide biomarker panel is Fig. 3 Evaluation of the 17-peptide biomarker panel as a classifier of active SJIA versus inactive (quiescent or remitted) SJIA. a A logistic regression model was used to find a panel-based algorithm that minimizes the total classification error discriminating active systemic SJIA from inactive SJIA. The maximum estimated probabilities for each of the wrongly classified samples, are labeled with arrows. b A modified 2\u00d72 contingency table shows the percentage of classifications that agreed with clinical diagnosis. c The discriminant analysis-derived prediction scores for each sample were used to construct a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve; 500 testing data sets, generated by bootstrapping, from the SJIA systemic flare, and inactive SJIA data were used to derive estimates of standard errors and confidence intervals for our ROC analysis. The plotted ROC curve is the vertical average of the 500 bootstrapping runs, and the box and whisker plots show the vertical spread around the average. d Distribution of the standardized ROC AUC values of the 500 falsely discovered panels upon the 500 classlabel permutated data set of the cohort of SJIA F and QOM/RD urine peptidomes. Examining all the 500 falsely discovered biomarker panel ROC AUC values, the number of falsely discovered same-size panels that have ROC AUC values greater than that of the original urine biomarker panel (represented by the red vertical line) dividing the total number of the \"falsely discovered\" biomarker panels led to the estimation of false discovery rate FDR unlikely to be the outcome of chance in multiple hypothesis testing.",

The urinary FGA peptides found in active SJIA samples (Table 8 ) lack one or two Cterminal residues compared with a related plasma peptide and thus appear to derive from exopeptidase activity. The urinary COL1A1 peptide that is most differentially expressed in active SJIA (Table 8) extends beyond the C terminus of a closely related peptide found in normal plasma, suggesting it may be generated by inhibition of normal protease activity during SJIA. A urinary FGB peptide found in SJIA (at similar levels in KD, but not comparison groups with less systemic inflammation) is identical to a peptide found in normal plasma, suggesting that the precursor protein is increased during inflammation.",

Given new and emerging analytical technologies and data mining algorithms, the urine peptidome has become a rich resource for the discovery of naturally occurring peptide biomarkers. For pediatric diseases, urine is expected to become one of the most useful body fluids in clinical proteomics for diagnosis and risk-stratification. Mass spectrometry-based urinary protein and peptide profiling has led to the discovery of highly informative biomarkers for both urogenital and non-urogenital diseases [43] . At the current time, urine proteomics have been applied primarily to diseases affecting the kidney and urinary tract. Our focus on changes in urine that reflect systemic inflammation is novel and potentially of broad use [18] . One of our long-term goals is to use urine biomarkers to develop clinical tests that are non-invasive and feasible for frequent sampling and determination. With this in mind, urine peptidomes from SJIA patients were profiled to identify naturally processed urine peptide biomarkers and 17-urine peptides emerged as a candidate SJIA flare panel. This panel was found to be robust using statistical analyses. Nonetheless, the panel requires validation using a new sample set of sufficient size, guided by power analysis.",

Similar to other molecular changes, such as plasma protein profiles [44] , this urine peptide panel may detect incipient SJIA disease activity prior to clinical evidence of disease. In order to offer a significant clinical advantage to justify routine monitoring of urine biomarkers, a test would have to be more sensitive than the history and physical exam at predicting impending flare, and would need to predict those disease flares which do not self-resolve and therefore require escalation of medical therapy. Serial evaluation of urine samples from SJIA subjects using MRM analysis will be performed to test this hypothesis.",

Our ability to discriminate between SJIA patients and other acute systemic inflammatory conditions is promising for future development of diagnostic tools. However, the SJIA patients in this study, except for the two new onset patients, are older than KD and FI patients. Collagens, bone growth and other connective tissue production may differ substantially. Therefore, development of diagnostic markers discriminating new onset SJIA from confounding acute inflammatory diseases, e.g., KD and FI, requires agematched subjects. To continue the discovery efforts and to validate the current biomarker panel, we plan to assemble a larger cohort of new onset SJIA. Another potential utility of the SJIA urine biomarker panel is to distinguish SJIA flare from infection in a patient with known SJIA, as these scenarios require different therapeutic responses. Urine samples from cohorts of both SJIA flare and SJIA patients with known infection will be assembled to validate the urine peptide biomarker panel revealed from this study.",

            "text": "The parent proteins of the urine peptide biomarkers can be found in the circulation or kidney. For example, A1AT, FGA, and FGB are all acute-phase plasma proteins, which are synthesized by hepatocytes and megakaryocytes [45] and are found at high levels in the circulation in the setting of acute or chronic inflammation. Increased fibrinogen and fibrin deposition within joints are prominent indicators of active SJIA flare [46] and arthritis [47] . We hypothesize that the SJIA urine peptide biomarkers may result from changes in the concentrations of inflammatory mediators and protein catabolism regulators, altering the levels of peptides that are ultimately filtered into urine or generated in the urinary tract from local protease activity. The consequence is the generation of a disease-specific molecular phenotype in SJIA urine. In support of this model, we and others [38] have found urine FGA peptide biomarkers in plasma. This would suggest that the FGA urine peptide biomarkers are likely to be present in circulation. Future prospective studies are needed to determine whether the plasma A1AT, FGA, and FGB peptides have diagnostic or prognostic value in SJIA disease management. However, UMOD protein is not derived from blood, but is produced by the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle in kidney. Our plasma analysis failed to find any UMOD peptides, suggesting that UMOD peptide biomarkers are coming from kidney. The differential abundance of UMOD urine peptide biomarkers in SJIA suggests that SJIA is likely to have an impact on normal kidney function. Renal disorders in SJIA patients are not well characterized. One 9-year-old SJIA patient was characterized by an aggressive disease course and developed renal amyloidosis just 2 years after the disease onset [48] . A variety of renal disorders can occur in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), which may due to the underlying disease. The most common disorders associated with RA are membranous nephropathy, secondary amyloidosis, a focal, mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis, rheumatoid vasculitis, and analgesic nephropathy [49, 50] . It is unclear whether SJIA directly affects renal function or indirectly causes renal inflammation.",

            "text": "It would have been of interest to assess changes in total protein or peptide excretion in our tested SJIA and contrasting KD/FI samples. Amounts of inflammatory proteins excreted in urine can change dramatically, and febrile states have often been associated with increased protein excretion [51, 52] . Future characterization of the SJIA and KD/FI urine proteomes can help determine whether disease-related changes in total of protein excretion explain the changes in urine peptide profiles we observe in SJIA. Disease-specific alterations of gene transcription in the affected tissue and change in the balance of proteolytic and anti-proteolytic activities in urine, as we have proposed previously [18] , may also contribute to the altered pattern of urine peptides in SJIA. To further explore the possible underlying mechanisms related to urine peptide generation, we used an antibody array with 43 proteins known to be involved in the inflammation of SJIA, including certain proteases and their regulators. Plasma profiling of SJIA flare and quiescent samples using this antibody array identified a biomarker panel of TIMP1, IL-18, RANTES, P-Selectin, MMP9, and L-Selectin, all of which are present at higher abundance in SJIA flare than in quiescence. Given that fibrinogen is a substrate of MMP9 [39] [40] [41] , it is possible that up regulation of MMP9 and TIMP1 in circulation may be directly associated to the generation of FGA peptide biomarkers that ultimately are enriched in urine during active SJIA. It has been shown that treatment of active rheumatoid arthritis with golimumab (human monoclonal antibody to TNF-\u03b1) plus methotrexate significantly decreases serum IL-18, E-selectin, TIMP1 and MMP9 levels [53] . IL-18 also has been reported to be a candidate for a key cytokine in the pathogenesis of SJIA [54] . Notably, IL-18 synthesis is increased in SJIA, but not in KD [55] , indicating that there are differences in the inflammatory milieu in these (sometimes clinically similar) diseases. Such differences may explain the differences in expression of the FGA peptide biomarkers in urine between SJIA flare and Kawasaki disease. The observation of P/L-Selectins as part of the plasma biomarker panel suggests that P/L-Selectin-mediated leukocyte migration might be important in SJIA pathogenesis, possibly by mediating the recruitment and/or trafficking of specific leukocyte subtypes into inflammatory foci. Previously analysis [56] of rheumatoid arthritis (RH)-specific collagen breakdown products indicates that RH-specific fragments are formed locally in synovial fluids during diseases process and then released into the circulation. It is likely that the SJIA urine peptide biomarkers, in a similar formation mechanism as RH-specific collagen degradation products, originate due to local inflammation, and then are released in the circulation, which are ultimately enriched and ended in urine.",

Long-term goals: Aim #1, identification of diagnostic urine peptide profile that distinguishes new onset SJIA patients from other systemic inflammatory states, including Kawasaki disease (KD) and febrile illness (FI). Aim #2, prediction of impending flare during quiescent periods of SJIA between disease classes, as indicated, and between active systemic disease (ND/SAF) and contrasting AF, QOM, RD, and HC samples respectively.

Clinical parameters indicative of systemic disease activity (i.e., ESR (erythrocyte sedimentation rate), C-reactive protein (CRP), white blood cell count (WBC), platelets (PLT)) were increased in ND and SAF groups compared with the subjects in the AF, QOM, and RD groups (Tables 1, 2, and 3). Among patient groups with systemic inflammatory conditions, SJIA (ND and SAF) and KD patients have increased values for ESR compared with FI patients, and the SJIA patients (ND and SAF) have higher CRP values than either KD or FI groups (ESR, ND: mean of 54, SAF mean of 52, KD, mean of 51, FI, mean of 31; CRP, ND: mean of 29.4, SAF mean of 28.05, KD, mean of 7.4, FI, mean of 3.39). However, active SJIA patients, KD patients and FI patients do not differ significantly (Student's t test, P value>0.01) in WBC, ESR, CRP, and PLT, respectively.
