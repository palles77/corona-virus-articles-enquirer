            "text": "Trade of bushmeat and other wildlife for human consumption presents a unique set of challenges to policymakers who are confronted with multiple trade-offs between conservation, food security, food safety, culture and tradition. In the face of these complex issues, risk assessments supported by quantitative information would facilitate evidence-based decision making. We propose a conceptual model for disease transmission risk analysis, inclusive of these multiple other facets. To quantify several processes included in this conceptual model we conducted questionnaire surveys with wildlife consumers and vendors in semi-urban centers in Lao People's Democratic Republic (Lao PDR, Laos) and direct observations of consumer behaviors. Direct observation of market stalls indicated an estimated average of 10 kg j o u r n a l h o m e p a g e : w w w . e l s e v i e r . c o m / l o c a t e / s c i t o t e n v bushmeat biomass per stall per hour. The socio-demographic data suggested that consumption of bushmeat in urban areas was not for subsistence but rather driven by dietary preference and tradition. Consumer behavioral observations indicated that each animal receives an average of 7 contacts per hour. We provide other key parameters to estimate the risk of disease transmission from bushmeat consumption and illustrate their use in assessing the total public health and socio-economic impact of bushmeat consumption. Pursuing integrative approaches to the study of bushmeat consumption is essential to develop effective and balanced policies that support conservation, public health, and rural development goals.",

There is growing evidence for the presence of zoonotic pathogens in traded and consumed bushmeat (Kilonzo et al., 2013; Kurpiers et al., 2016; Schoder et al., 2015; Smith et al., 2012) , and pathogen spillovers into humans have repeatedly occurred as a result of wild meat consumption (Calattini et al., 2007; Kalish et al., 2005; Mouinga-Ondeme et al., 2012; Wolfe et al., 2004) . When the anthropic factors (i.e. socio-economic, behavioral) and the pathogen characteristics allowed it Plowright et al., 2017) , some of these spillover events resulted in significant outbreaks and pandemics. Indeed, the contacts of hunters with great ape carcasses likely caused Ebola virus spillovers to humans and subsequent human outbreaks in Gabon and the Democratic Republic of Congo (Georges-Courbot et al., 1997; Leroy et al., 2004) . The 2002 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus (SARS-Co) outbreak was linked to contacts with traded masked palm civets (Paguma larvata) likely infected from a bat reservoir (Bell et al., 2004; Li et al., 2005; Wang et al., 2006) . Notoriously, the emergence of Human Immunodeficiency Viruses (HIV) was linked to repeated spillover of Simian Immunodeficiency Viruses from sooty mangabeys (Cercocebus atys) and chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes), including the pandemic virus from the HIV1-group M (Hahn et al., 2000) . Moreover, the high contamination of carcasses and the lack of inspection and cold chain increase the risk that bushmeat carries and transmits diverse foodborne pathogens (Bachand et al., 2012) .",

            "text": "The impact of wildlife hunting, trade and consumption are obviously not limited to zoonotic disease transmission. The increasing demand for wild meat, combined with intense demographic, environmental, and climatic changes, is resulting in what is now referred to as the sixth mass extinction (Ceballos et al., 2015; Dirzo et al., 2014; Milner-Gulland and Bennett, 2003) . The situation is particularly critical in the humid tropics where low productivity of tropical forest can only sustain levels of offtake well below current demand (Robinson and Bennett, 2004) , resulting in large scale depletion and extirpation of wildlife species (Dirzo et al., 2014; Ripple et al., 2016) , and eventually in \"empty forests\" (Harrison, 2011; Redford, 1992) . The Lao People's Democratic Republic (Lao PDR, Laos) is following this path, with sparse but clear evidence of wildlife over-harvesting, even in protected areas (Claridge and Nooren, 2001; Clendon, 2001; Johnson et al., 2012; Krahn and Johnson, 2007) . For instance, the estimated wild pig (Sus scrofa) and muntjac (Muntiacus muntjak) harvest across ten villages in the Nam Et-Phou Louey National Protected Area was at least 63% and 36% of the estimated standing biomass per year, respectively (Johnson et al., 2012) , well above the estimated maximum sustainable yearly offtake of 10% for wild ungulates in tropical forests (Robinson and Bennett, 2004) . As a result, decrease of wildlife abundance and local extirpation of species are observed across the region (Gomez and Shepherd, 2018; Harrison et al., 2016; Tungittiplakorn and Dearden, 2002; Vongkhamheng et al., 2013) . Like in many other parts of Southeast Asia and the world (Mainka and Trivedi, 2002) , over-harvest is amplified by the development of trade routes linking rural areas to urban centers (Clements et al., 2014) , the replacement of traditional hunting equipment for more effective methods (e.g. riffles, electrified wire traps, poisoning), and an increase in food demand due to population growth (Clendon, 2001; Johnson et al., 2012; Krahn, 2005) .",

In communities that derive a significant portion of their protein and micronutrients from bushmeat, as is the case in rural Laos (Johnson et al., 2012; Krahn, 2005; World Food Programme, 2007) , losing access to wild meat (as a result of policy or wildlife depletion) could have severe adverse health effects, and increase food insecurity and malnutrition (Cawthorn and Hoffman, 2015; Golden et al., 2011) . Some rural communities were also shown to derive significant livelihood from bushmeat trade (Schulte-Herbr\u00fcggen et al., 2013) , although the structure of trade networks and the socio-demographic background of their actors are likely to influence the level of reliance on this activity for livelihood. Furthermore, for communities in which wildlife hunting and consumption has deep cultural, social and traditional roots, decreased access to wildlife may affect well-being (Johnson et al., 2003) .",

On a policy level, these aspects can appear as competing priorities between wildlife conservation, sustainable use, food safety, food security, and cultural aspects. In Southeast Asia, these challenges have been further complicated over the past 15-20 years by a shift from subsistence hunting to wildlife trade in rural areas (Bell et al., 2004; Bennet and Robinson, 2000; Duckworth et al., 1999) , along with an urbanization of wildlife consumption (Singh, 2008) . It was previously suggested that wildlife consumption by urban dwellers represents a greater risk for disease emergence as the wildlife pathogens funneled to these urban centers have more opportunities for cross-species transmission, and get introduced into densely populated areas of mostly na\u00efve individuals (Swift et al., 2007) . Furthermore, the blurring of boundaries between subsistence hunting and wildlife trade with urban communities (Bennet and Robinson, 2000; Nasi et al., 2008) challenges wildlife conservation and rural development policy to adequately address the tradeoff between wildlife protection and sustainable use (Krahn and Johnson, 2007; Singh, 2008) . Indeed, maintaining sustainable subsistence hunting for communities that truly rely on these resources depends on the ability to reduce consumption in urban centers where alternatives protein sources are readily available (Rao and McGowan, 2002; Solly, 2004) .",

Furthermore, the formulation of effective evidence-based public health, conservation, and development policies has been hindered by the lack of qualitative and quantitative data across all of these issues. A risk analysis framework can be useful to the multi-disciplinary management of such complex systems, including the joint identification of problems and threats, collection and integration of relevant data, and the facilitation of policy formulation (OIE -World Organisation for Animal Health and International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources, 2014). In particular, quantitative risk analysis (QRA) allows an evaluation of the probability of certain outcomes of interest, under variable and uncertain conditions, as a basis for decision making (Nauta, 2000) , and may be particularly suitable to explore systems with multiple tradeoffs, as long as sufficient quantitative data is available to characterize the system. QRA models have been used in diverse disciplines (Vose, 2008) , but are particularly popular for food safety (Notermans and Teunis, 1996) and foreign animal disease risk assessments (Miller et al., 2017; Peeler et al., 2015) . Although their application to the risk of disease transmission from bushmeat consumption and wildlife trade has been recommended (OIE -World Organisation for Animal Health and International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources, 2014), only a few instances exist to date (Franssen et al., 2017; Simons et al., 2016; Wooldridge et al., 2006) . Given the flexibility of QRA methods such as Monte Carlo simulations, we further recommend their use as a tool for multi-disciplinary data integration for the evaluation of the multiple trade-offs of the bushmeat system.",

We then report on a number of surveys and direct observations aiming at filling information gaps identified during the development of this conceptual model. These surveys document essential quantitative information on demography, behaviors and practices of urban wildlife consumers and vendors, and detailed descriptions of wildlife-consumer interactions. Throughout the manuscript we provide estimates for key parameters that would be required to develop a full QRA model. We also report on the attitude and risk perception of wildlife consumers and vendors, as it is essential to the interpretation of behavioral data and the design of effective intervention strategies (e.g. education, policy). Finally, we discuss the policy relevance of both qualitative and quantitative information to the management of the tradeoffs between food safety, food security, and conservation.",

In a QRA context, the multiple tradeoffs mentioned earlier represent multiple threats for which risk must be assessed. Each threat can be conceptualized as the result of multiple processes (the nodes and links of Fig. 1 ) that emerge from the interaction of four components: wildlife, humans, human behaviors, and pathogens. While Fig. 1 is primarily focused on the risk of zoonotic disease transmission from wildlife to vendors and consumers, the processes related to other threats can be expanded as needed, allowing the integration of these perspectives within the QRA framework. Table 1 provides examples of processes and factors influencing other threats. In this conceptual model, the wildlife/bushmeat distribution chain processes, made up of interacting human and wildlife components, drive the flow of wildlife in and out of the market through a number of intermediaries. It is also influenced by consumer behaviors (frequency and quantity of consumption) which create the demand for bushmeat. The time between each step of the distribution chain can also be useful in estimating the persistence of pathogens within an infected specimen. Within the market, behaviors and practices of vendors and consumers result in diverse interactions with bushmeat, and potential exposure to zoonotic pathogens. The quantity of traded bushmeat, the type of products sold (i.e. live, dead, dried, smoked), the time it takes to sell them, the handling of wildlife and bushmeat, their preparation (e.g. killing, dressing, cooking) according to preference and tradition, and finally their consumption determine the exposure of vendors and consumers to pathogens. For a given pathogen, a proportion of the animals entering the market are infected. Pathogen characteristics influence its persistence in the bushmeat and the dose-response for different transmission routes eventually determines the probability of infection.",

Consumer surveys were conducted in 13 markets previously identified as hotspots for wildlife trade (Greatorex et al., 2016) or more recently discovered as having high volumes of bushmeat during routine monitoring of markets (unpublished data). Between October 2016 and January 2017, each market was visited twice during periods of high attendance by consumers, based on preliminary observations (Greatorex et al., 2016) . Observers were posted at strategic locations in each market that allowed observation of market consumers approaching stalls or purchasing bushmeat. Given the illegal and sensitive nature of wildlife consumption, consumers were not approached until they exited the market. Using a standard scripted introduction we briefly explained the purpose of the study. A total of 182 of 226 consumers (81%) that were approached provided written consent to be interviewed, and were asked 26 questions documenting general socio-demographic information (e.g. age, occupation, origin, salary, education level) (Supplementary document 1), motivations and practices regarding bushmeat consumption, and knowledge and risk perception of wildlife disease. Five staff trained for reliability and consistency conducted the interviews that lasted 10-20 min. For wildlife consumers who declined to participate, minimal essential information was determined (age, sex, origin, profession, purchased items) or guessed when necessary (age, sex). We compared respondents and non-respondents on this information and no difference was observed in their sex, age distribution, nationality, ethnicity (for the respondent of Lao nationality), and the distance between the market and their main living location (Supplementary document 2, Table S1 ). The remaining of this manuscript, therefore, focuses on the 182 respondents who accepted to participate in the full interview.",

The association of this perceived risk with sex, education and prior knowledge of wildlife diseases was assessed using ordinal logistic regressions. Finally, the interview documented the motivations for bushmeat consumption.

For each stall, individual animals, batches of animals, or animal parts were counted and identified by species or closest level of taxonomic classification (hereafter, species). From afar (10-15 m), we then observed and counted contacts established by consumers with these items, for a period of 20 min per stall. Most items were individual animals and contacts were counted for each animal, but when animals were sold as parts (e.g. wild boar, muntjac) or batches (e.g. small squirrels, rats, and bats), contacts were counted per part or per batch. For a subset of these observations, the sex of the consumer making contact with the animal was recorded. Contact counts were conducted by two observers who logged 53 h of direct observation. When restricted to fresh and live animals (i.e. excluding dry, smoked, or pickled animals), this totaled 211 animal-hours of observations (e.g. one animal-hour could represent three animals observed for 20 min each). Average contact rates were estimated by species and by the sex of the consumer. Distributions were also fitted to the number of contacts per observation period (20 min) for several species groups: rodents (excluding live bamboo rats, giant flying squirrels, and porcupines), small carnivores, reptiles, ungulates, birds, and bamboo rats. Concurrently, if any consumer purchased wildlife during the observation time, we recorded the species and number of purchased animals. Over a total of 51 stall-hours of observation (one stall-hour is defined as one market stall observed for 1 h), we reported the total number of purchases (i.e. clients) and purchased animals per species. Based on these counts, the total amount of purchased biomass per species was estimated using previously published average weight of each species (Greatorex et al., 2016) . Based on these total amounts of observed purchased meat, we estimated the yearly total volume and retail value for an average market. We considered an average market to include five stalls and about 4 h of peak activity per day (comparable to activity levels when observations were carried out) and to be open daily (unpublished data), for a yearly total of 7300 stall-hours. The retail value was calculated based on published average value for each species (Greatorex et al., 2016) . As a proxy for exposure of wildlife consumers to bushmeat, we estimated distributions of the quantity of purchased wildlife per consumer and per purchase. This was estimated for small-sized rodents such as rats and squirrels (excluding bamboo rats and giant flying squirrels) as a number of purchased animals, and for all species as an amount of meat purchased (in kg).",

            "text": "From our estimates, wildlife consumption could represent a significant portion of people's protein intake as the median yearly quantity of bushmeat purchase was comparable to average yearly per capita meat consumption (FAOSTAT, 2018) . In absence of information on how the bushmeat is shared within households, it is difficult to fully estimate the proportion of protein needs covered by bushmeat. Nevertheless, in urban settings such as where these surveys were conducted, there is no reason from a nutritional and economic standpoint for consuming wildlife rather than readily available (and cheaper) domestic meat. However, the bushmeat traded in urban wildlife markets diverts precious protein resources from more remote rural communities that truly rely on this nutritional input. The absence of association between the consumption patterns and the socio-economic indicators suggest that wildlife consumption in these urban centers was indeed tied to preference and not necessity, which was confirmed by \"taste preference\" being the primary reported motivation for wildlife consumption. On a conservation and public health perspective, this may be problematic, as taste preference is likely to be a difficult aspect to address and change through communication or education campaigns, and change may only be achieved through law enforcement. Reducing wildlife consumption in urban centers is crucial to reducing the demand and offtake of wildlife from natural areas, and keeping wildlife offtake at sustainable levels so that communities which most depend on it can continue hunting for subsistence. It should be noted that the disruption of this illegal trade may have consequences on the livelihood of the rural community, as the income derived from the sale of bushmeat can sometimes contribute significantly to livelihood and well-being of rural households (Schulte-Herbr\u00fcggen et al., 2013) . However, a previous study in Lao PDR found that the extra income earned by remote rural communities members from selling bushmeat was most often used to purchase Fig. 4 .

The preference for rodents and bats is a concern as these two taxa are particularly significant for the risk of zoonotic disease emergence (Han et al., 2015; Olival et al., 2017; Wang, 2015) . In Lao PDR, rodents were reported to host several zoonotic pathogens of great public health significance, such as Leptospira (Cosson et al., 2014) , Orientia tsutsugamushi (Phetsouvanh et al., 2015; Lerdthusnee et al., 2003) , Rickettsia sp. (Phongmany et al., 2006) , and Hantavirus (Blasdell et al., 2011) . The very high number of wild birds circulating in markets where live poultry and other mammalian hosts can be found may represent an interface for avian influenza transmission, mutation, and re-assortment of domestic and wild viruses (Moon et al., 2010; Nguyen et al., 2005) . The very high volume of monitor lizard and wild boar meat sold on markets may increase the risk of food-borne parasite transmission, such as Taenia solium, Angiostrongylus cantonensis, Trichinella spp., and Hepatitis E virus, all transmitted through consumption of insufficiently cooked meat and present in Laos (Barennes et al., 2008; Holt et al., 2016; Ming et al., 2017) . Finally the occurrence of both bats and civets (live and dead) in the markets is of great concern, as these seem to have been key for the emergence of SARS coronavirus in 2001 (Bell et al., 2004) . Further, we documented the amount of bushmeat obtained at each individual purchase, a significant factor in estimating the exposure of wildlife consumers to particular pathogens. The processing (killing and butchering) of animals was not restricted to wildlife vendors, since most live animals were processed by the consumers themselves. Although the majority of respondents (92%) reported eating the meat well done, the consumption of raw meat and blood for traditional Lao Larb dishes is of particular concern. Given the lack of cold chain and the conditions of meat preparation, foodborne pathogens are likely to be found and cause illness in consumers (Bachand et al., 2012; Jansen et al., 2019; Paulsen, 2016) .",

The majority of wildlife vendors obtained the animals from a third party provider, so for each animal sold on the market, the most basic distribution chain would have at least three people coming in close contact with the animal (hunter, vendor, and consumer), and most often include additional middlemen (TRAFFIC, 2008) . The information obtained on the duration of each step from bushmeat hunting to consumption suggested a rapid transit through the distribution chain, consistent with what would be expected with a poor cold-chain. This indicates that all actors along the distribution chain likely come in contact with relatively fresh animals, of higher risk for pathogen transmission.",

Our direct observations also documented an astounding number of contacts between bushmeat and market consumers, with an average of over seven contacts per animal per hour. To our knowledge, this is the first time that such information has been quantified. In our estimates of contact rates, we purposely separated animals for which estimates may be biased due to a low number of observations. However, it is remarkable that rarer species seem to receive particularly high numbers of contacts. Although these species are rare occurrences on markets, these disproportionately higher number of contacts may still have a significant impact on transmission, analogous to super-spreading events (Stein, 2011) .",

However, the health focus of our project seemed to put respondents at ease with the survey despite the sensitive topics, as indicated by the high response rate for both vendor and consumer surveys. About a third of wildlife consumer respondents were aware of disease transmitted from wildlife to humans. This low level of awareness of zoonotic disease, together with the observation that people with higher level of education were more likely to be aware of this risk, suggest that there may be opportunities to increase knowledge of wildlife diseases through awareness and engagement campaigns. However, it is unclear if greater knowledge of wildlife disease would have any consequence on the wildlife consumption behavior. From our surveys, there seemed to be associations between the knowledge of wildlife disease and the perceived risk of infection, as well as between this perceived risk and the frequency of wildlife consumption. However, it is not clear if this reported frequency of consumption is a good indicator of the behavioral response of interestthe willingness to decrease bushmeat consumption. When asked if they would stop eating wildlife if they learned of a particular disease risk, a higher proportion of respondents with no prior disease knowledge responded 'yes' than respondents with prior disease knowledge. This could be an indication that increasing awareness of infectious disease may be an effective approach for behavioral change, but could also indicate some level of risk tolerance. Nevertheless, these proportions are high regardless of prior knowledge and perception, which points to the value of generating wildlife disease information that has direct local relevance to the wildlife consumers, focusing on priority endemic diseases of local significance.",

Based on our estimates, an average market would generate close to half a million USD in trade for over 71 tons of bushmeat sold per year. Similar surveys should be repeated to assess the seasonal patterns of bushmeat trade. It is also difficult to make conclusions on the sustainability of this trade without additional information on the origin of traded animals and the total size and dynamic of the source populations. Most vendors came from less than 10 km to the market, which suggests that the impact of this type of trade may be quite local and likely to exceed the estimated sustainable offtake in wet tropical forests (Robinson and Bennett, 2004) . Distance between hunting location and market has previously been used as an indicator of wildlife abundance and offtake sustainability, based on the assumption that with decreasing wildlife population, bushmeat needs to be hunted in more remote areas (Crookes et al., 2005; Milner-Gulland and Clayton, 2002) . Further work is required to better characterize the source populations and local trade routes in order to assess the sustainability of this level of wildlife offtake.",

This raises serious concerns about the effectiveness of current law enforcement strategies, which mostly involve wildlife confiscation in markets. Interestingly, the majority of wildlife consumers reported that they would be very likely to stop consuming wildlife if they faced a fine from enforcement authorities. This suggests that the cost of law enforcement can be internalized by wildlife vendors as part of their business operations, while this cost may not be tolerable at the individual level for a wildlife consumer. Hence, a possible effective angle for law enforcement is to reduce demand for wildlife by targeting wildlife consumers in urban centers. Here again, a good understanding of wildlife consumer demography, economic status, and motivations is essential to the design of effective policy with limited unintended consequences on more vulnerable communities.",

Doing so, we demonstrated high rates of direct contact between bushmeat and people visiting the market, highlighting that this may be an under-estimated route of disease transmission in the bushmeat system. This approach and preliminary data are relevant to a broad range of endemic and emerging zoonotic pathogens, and will assist in improving our understanding of the zoonotic disease risk from bushmeat consumption. In particular, we encourage efforts to assess the public health (e.g. in Disability-Adjusted Life Years [DALYs]) and socio-economic impact of common endemic diseases potentially transmitted by bushmeat rather than focusing exclusively on low probability/high impact scenarios (e.g. emerging diseases such as Ebola and SARS). The flexibility of this framework allowed the inclusion of aspects related to nutrition, highlighting the significant portion of dietary needs covered by bushmeat in urban consumers. However, our socio-demographic data on these urban consumers suggested that consumption of bushmeat was motivated by dietary preference and tradition rather than nutritional needs. We were also able to derive information on the conservation impact by providing some indicators of the magnitude of the trade. Fully understanding these tradeoffs between food safety, food security, and conservation will continue to be a challenge, and will require improving the quantification of these multiple risks under integrative frameworks. Although these aspects can be somewhat contradictory from a management point of view, considering them integratively is essential to the articulation of effective and balanced policies that reduce the public health impact of zoonotic diseases, secure the nutritional status and livelihood of rural populations, and protect biodiversity across natural landscapes.",
