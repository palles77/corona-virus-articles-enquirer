This process, known as \"host shutoff\", allows viruses to rapidly restrict gene expression in 30 order to dampen immune responses and provide access to the host's resources for viral 31 replication (2,6,7). One well-studied viral endonuclease is the SOX protein encoded by Kaposi's 32 sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV). SOX is conserved throughout the herpesvirus family, 33 but only gammaherpesviral SOX homologs display ribonuclease activity in cells (8) (9) (10) and 34 studies indicate that SOX activity is important for the in-vivo viral lifecycle (11,12). Although SOX 35 targets a degenerate RNA motif present on most mRNA (13-15), multiple studies have shown 36 that some transcripts robustly escape SOX-induced decay (16-21). Studying these 'escapees' in 37 aggregate is complicated, however, by the fact that multiple mechanisms can promote apparent 38 escape. These include lack of a targeting motif, indirect transcriptional effects, and active 39 evasion of ribonucleolytic cleavage (16,20-24). This latter phenotype, termed \"dominant 40 escape\", is particularly notable as it involves a specific RNA element whose presence in the 3' 41 UTR of an mRNA protects against SOX cleavage, regardless of whether the RNA contains a 42 targeting motif (19-21). This protective RNA element was termed SRE (for SOX Resistance 43 Element), but we recently showed that the SRE is also effective against a broad range of viral 44 endonucleases. Perhaps more surprisingly, the SRE is unable to restrict endonucleolytic 45 cleavage originating from a cellular endonuclease, making it the first identified viral-specific 46 ribonuclease escape element (19) . We showed that this broad-acting RNA element is not 47",

By accelerating RNA decay, viruses can increase their access to the 216 host translation machinery and dampen the host response to infection. RNA degradation is often 217 driven by virally encoded endonucleases that can target a wide array of mRNA by cleaving 218 within a specific structured element (13,15). It is estimated that up to two thirds of total mRNA 219 are degraded upon expression of these viral endonucleases (11,13,16). While recent studies 220 have focused on how these viral endonucleases target mRNA, it remains unclear how and why 221 some mRNA transcripts can escape viral-induced RNA decay. We previously demonstrated that 222 certain transcripts escape by possessing in their 3'UTR an RNA element that protects them from 223 viral endonucleases, while still allowing for normal RNA decay and cellular endonuclease 224 cleavage (19-21). This raised a number of questions regarding how common these RNA escape 225 elements are in the host genome and how their presence impacts the viral lifecycle. Here, we 226",

C19orf66 (also annotated RyDEN, IRAV, and SVA-1) is an interferon stimulated gene 72 (ISG) that has been found to be upregulated upon infection by a number a viruses (35-40), 73 including herpesviruses (41,42) in several large scale screens. Recently, C19ORF66 was 74 demonstrated to repress Dengue Virus (DENV) replication and gene expression by interacting 75 with the cytoplasmic poly-A binding protein, PABPC (43), and the RNA helicase MOV10 (44) 76 suggesting that C19ORF66 may restrict DENV infection by either directly influencing the host 77 gene expression machinery, and/or directly targeting viral RNA for degradation, making it an 78 intriguing candidate dominant escapees during KSHV infection. Here we show that C19ORF66 is upregulated during KSHV infection and accumulates 80 over the course of 96 hours post-reactivation. Knocking down C19ORF66 during KSHV infection 81 leads to higher expression levels of early and delayed early viral genes, which results in higher 82 yields of infectious viral particles and suggests that C19ORF66 has anti-viral activity on KSHV. 83 Taken together, these results demonstrate that SRE and SRE-like elements may be more 84 common than anticipated in the genome, and that transcripts encoding these escape elements 85 may also function as viral restriction factors. 86 Comparative RNA-seq identifies a cluster of common escaping transcripts 89 Prior analyses indicated that certain host mRNA transcripts robustly escape viral-induced 90 RNA decay by encoding an RNA element in their 3'UTRs. We demonstrated that this RNA 91 element, herein referred to as SRE (SOX Resistance Element), provides protection against 92 KSHV SOX as well as a variety of viral endonucleases. To identify mRNA transcripts containing 93 SRE or SRE-like elements, we performed comparative RNA-seq based transcriptomics 94 analyses upon expression of the herpesviral RNA endonucleases.

It is therefore possible that C19ORF66, by interacting with PABPC, slows down 262 PABPC relocalization to nucleus and restricts expression of viral genes. By Interacting with 263 PABPC and LARP, C19ORF66 was also hypothesized to regulate decay of Dengue RNA by 264 possibly influencing either translation or localization to p-bodies and stress granules(53)265 Determining whether C19ORF66 influences the PABPC shuttling pattern is an important future 266 goal, as well as deciphering C19ORF66 interaction pattern upon KSHV infection and lytic 267 Past literature on C19ORF66 has attributed C19ORF66 upregulation upon viral infection 269 to interferon signaling. KSHV encodes multiple proteins that restrict the expression of interferon 270 stimulated genes (ISG) (54) and yet, we observed an increased in C19ORF66 expression 271 during KSHV lytic cycle. This suggests that in addition to escaping SOX-induced mRNA decay, 272 C19ORF66 must have a mechanism to escape the KSHV encoded ISG inhibitors. This 273 reinforces the idea that C19ORF66 is particularly important during KSHV infection and, to date, 274 remains the only known ISG capable of escaping virally induced widespread mRNA decay. 275",
