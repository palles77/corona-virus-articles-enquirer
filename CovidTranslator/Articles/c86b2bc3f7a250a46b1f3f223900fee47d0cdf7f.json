In many of these studies acceptability of self-or parent-collection was preferred to investigator or clinician collection [7, 16] . In the few studies of unsupervised collection, self-collected specimens were collected and returned in the timeframe recommended by the research team [6, 16] . In addition, specimen quality in many studies has been similar regardless of collection method [5, 19] . A Canadian study found that both viral loads and RNaseP were similar between self-collected and investigator-collected specimens [8] . A study in pregnant women found 100% of self-collected specimens detected RNaseP [6] , as we found in the current study. Other measures of specimen quality have also been similar between collection methods [11, 18] . Importantly, many of these feasibility studies were pilot studies with relatively small sample sizes, and self-collection was often completed in the presence of the study investigators. Our study confirms the feasibility and timeliness of unsupervised collection of respiratory specimens in a large, longitudinal cohort study. As we are currently experiencing with COVID-19 pandemic, unsupervised collection Is essential to provide maximum protection to research staff and participants and to comply with social distancing guidelines from public health authorities.",

The difference in agreement with previous studies may be explained by the timing of our collection methods. Many of the previous studies involved concurrent collection of self-and staff-collected specimens, whereas our specimens are collected on onset (home-collected) and again within 7 days of onset (staff-collected). One study of parent-collected specimens found that time from symptom onset to collection was the only factor associated with respiratory virus positivity; collection method and subjective quality of parent-collected specimens were not associated with detection [6] . Likewise, we found that time between home-and staff-collection was an important factor in terms of both Ct value and agreement. Agreement in our study was higher when analyses were restricted to paired specimens collected within 1 day of each other. Our coupling of homecollection with prospective, active surveillance has allowed us to capture viral specimens on the day of onset without the delay inherent in scheduling a visit with research staff. Future applications of this method can include sequential specimen collection for studies of viral shedding over time and virus transmission.",
