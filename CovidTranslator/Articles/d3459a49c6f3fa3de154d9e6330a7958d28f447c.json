            "text": "The basic reproductive ratio, R 0 , is defined as the expected number of secondary infections arising from a single individual during his or her entire infectious period, in a population of susceptibles. This concept is fundamental to the study of epidemiology and within-host pathogen dynamics. Most importantly, R 0 often serves as a threshold parameter that predicts whether an infection will spread. Related parameters which share this threshold behaviour, however, may or may not give the true value of R 0 . In this paper we give a brief overview of common methods of formulating R 0 and surrogate threshold parameters from deterministic, non-structured models. We also review common means of estimating R 0 from epidemiological data. Finally, we survey the recent use of R 0 in assessing emerging diseases, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome and avian influenza, a number of recent livestock diseases, and vector-borne diseases malaria, dengue and West Nile virus.",

Originally developed for the study of demographics (B\u00f6ckh 1886; Sharp & Lotka 1911; Dublin & Lotka 1925; Kuczynski 1928) , it was independently studied for vector-borne diseases such as malaria (Ross 1911; MacDonald 1952) and directly transmitted human infections (Kermack & McKendrick 1927; Dietz 1975; Hethcote 1975) . It is now widely used in the study of infectious disease, and more recently, in models of in-host population dynamics. Two excellent surveys of the tangled history of R 0 can be found in Dietz (1993) and Heesterbeek (2002) . An excellent overview of the demographic history can be found in Smith & Keyfitz (1977) .",

The interpretation of 'secondary', however, depends on context. In demographics and ecology, R 0 is taken to mean the lifetime reproductive success of a typical member of the species. In epidemiology, we take R 0 to mean the number of individuals infected by a single infected individual during his or her entire infectious period, in a population which is entirely susceptible. For in-host dynamics, R 0 gives the number of newly infected cells produced by one infected cell during its lifetime, assuming all other cells are susceptible.",

If R 0 O1, the pathogen is able to invade the susceptible population. This threshold behaviour is the most important and useful aspect of the R 0 concept. In an endemic infection, we can determine which control measures, and at what magnitude, would be most effective in reducing R 0 below one, providing important guidance for public health initiatives.",

For example, the estimation of R 0 was of critical importance in understanding the outbreak and potential danger from severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) (Choi & Pak 2003; Lipsitch et al. 2003; Lloyd-Smith et al. 2003; Riley et al. 2003) . R 0 has been likewise used to characterize bovine spongiform encephalitis (BSE) (Woolhouse & Anderson 1997; Ferguson et al. 1999; de Koeijer et al. 2004) , foot and mouth disease (FMD) (Ferguson et al. 2001; Matthews et al. 2003) , novel strains of influenza (Mills et al. 2004; Stegeman et al. 2004 ) and West Nile virus (Wonham et al. 2004) . The incidence and spread of dengue (Luz et al. 2003) , malaria (Hagmann et al. 2003) , Ebola (Chowell et al. 2004b ) and scrapie (Gravenor et al. 2004 ) have also been assessed using R 0 in recent literature. Topical issues such as the risks of indoor airborne infection (Rudnick & Milton 2003) , bioterrorism (Kaplan et al. 2002; Longini et al. 2004) , and computer viruses (Lloyd & May 2001 ) also rely on this important concept.",

As an example of the latter technique, consider epidemic modelling of malaria. An infected human may pass the infection to a mosquito, which may in turn infect more humans. This complete cycle must be taken into account in our derivation of R 0 , which we might expect to yield the total number of infected humans produced by one infected human. In general, if only two distinct infectious states are involved in such an infection cycle, F(a) can be defined as the probability that an individual in state 1 at time zero produces an individual who is in state 2 until at least time a. Similarly, b(a) is the average number of new individuals in state 1 produced by an individual who has been in state 2 for time a. In modelling malaria, F(a) could be the probability that a human infected at time zero produces an infected mosquito which remains alive until at least time a. In more concrete terms, F(a) would be the integral of the following product: !prob\u00f0infected mosquito lives to be age a K t\u00de dt (2.2) while b(a) would simply be the average number of humans newly infected by a mosquito which has been infected for time a. (Note that we could also take the infected mosquito as state 1, deriving an analogous expression which would yield the same value of R 0 .) Unfortunately, derivations such as equation (2.2) become increasingly cumbersome as this method is extended to infection cycles involving three or more states (Hethcote & Tudor 1980; Lloyd 2001b; Huang et al. 2003) . In these situations, the next generation operator offers an elegant solution, as described in the following section.",

This can easily be done using the characteristic polynomial and the Routh-Hurwitz stability conditions. The Jacobian method clearly allows us to derive a parameter that reflects the stability of the disease-free equilibrium. The parameter obtained in this way, however, may or may not reflect the biologically meaningful value of R 0 . An example where the Jacobian method does not yield R 0 is described in detail in Diekmann & Heesterbeek (2000; exercise 5.43) .

Following Mollison's (1995a) derivation, we consider a single infected individual and note that the number of successful contacts (in which the infection is passed on) for that individual should be given by R 0 p s , where p s is the probability that a given contact is with a susceptible. At equilibrium, the average number of new infections per infected individual must be exactly one, allowing us to write R 0 Z1/p s . Under the assumption of homogenous mixing, the unknown probability, p s , can be estimated as the fraction of the host population that is susceptible at the endemic equilibrium. This yields an extremely simple estimate of the basic reproductive ratio, which has been used extensively (see Anderson & May (1991) for review). An interesting point here is that R 0 reflects not only the behaviour of the system at the uninfected equilibrium (which is apparent by definition), but may also, under certain assumptions, reflect important features of the endemic equilibrium. Similar to other ODE methods, we must first assume that the host population is homogenous, that is, all hosts have intrinsically similar epidemiological properties, independent of age, genetic make-up, geography, and so on. We also assume mass-action transmission, specifically, that the number of contacts per infective is independent of the number of infectives. The accuracy of this estimate will clearly depend on the degree to which these assumptions hold; if infectivity or mortality vary with age, for example, the approximation suffers.",

This is because there is a transcritical bifurcation at R 0 Z1 and the number of susceptibles of the 'endemic' equilibrium is actually negative. During this portion of the bifurcation diagram, the uninfected equilibrium is stable, and hence the initial condition ensures that negative individuals cannot be reached. Practically, this means that when R 0 !1 we would never find a population at the endemic equilibrium, and could not apply this method. (Note that when the assumption of massaction transmission is relaxed, a backward bifurcation may occur at R 0 Z1, and diseases with R 0 !1 may persist (Dushoff 1996; Dushoff et al. 1998).)

They found that to reduce R 0 from approximately 3 to 1, isolation and quarantine must reduce total infectiousness by at least two-thirds. Further analysis of these control policies enabled Lipsitch et al. to conclude that quarantine would impose a large burden on the population if SARS was allowed to spread over a long period with an R 0 O1 in a susceptible population. Individuals could be quarantined multiple times over the course of the infection or for very long periods of time. These conclusions offer useful guidance for public health initiatives, but as several parameters of this model are unknown, Lipsitch et al. were unable to give concrete estimates for the levels of quarantine and isolation necessary to decrease the value of R 0 below one. Chowell et al. (2003) developed a system of ODEs to describe the spread of SARS in the three geographical populations mentioned above. Their model includes two classes of susceptibility, low risk and high risk, and also includes two types of infected individuals, symptomatic and asymptomatic, which differ in their rate of diagnosis and mode of transmission. The main goal of this study was not to determine R 0 , but to estimate the diagnostic rate and isolation effectiveness for the three separate regions, with an emphasis on the Toronto outbreak. These two parameter values were estimated by first determining the exponential growth rates from SARS incidence data in all three regions and fitting the model to the data assuming that all of the other model parameters were roughly constant between regions. In a brief section the parameter estimates were used to calculate R 0 using the next generation approach. R 0 was 1.2 for Hong Kong, approximately 1.2 for Toronto and 1.1 for Singapore. A weakness of this model is that R 0 depends on estimating many (approximately 10) model parameters. These estimates of R 0 are comparable to those estimated by Lipsitch et al. (2003) when the latter group assumed the serial interval to be small, around 4 days. However, the serial interval in this study was taken to be between 7 and 10 days.

The goal of this model was to evaluate contact precautions, quarantine and isolation as containment procedures while assuming a particular value of R 0 . Using a value of R 0 z3 for the Hong Kong and Singapore outbreaks they found that isolation alone could control the spread of SARS if it met very stringent requirements. However, they concluded that the control measures that were most successful were limiting contact between people in hospitals and decreasing the number of contacts between people inside and outside of the hospital.",

Mills et al. (2004) used mortality data to estimate R 0 for the 1918 influenza pandemic in 45 cities in the USA. Interestingly, this approach relied on none of the mathematical techniques described in previous sections; instead, the number of susceptibles, incident infections and infectious hosts were estimated using a discrete time simulation. Using a case fatality proportion of 2%, the total number of deaths was estimated and this was compared with 'excess' mortality data, that is, the number of deaths in 1918 above the median for 1910-1916. A value of R 0 was determined which minimized the sum of squared differences between the simulated and observed data. The median estimate for R 0 was 2.9.",

It seems likely, however, that any heterogenous mixing and intervention measures were in place during these two weeks of rapid epidemic growth as well, since these weeks were not always the first weeks of the epidemic.

The results suggest that control of such a pandemic will be possible, given the 'modest' reproductive number of the 1918 strain. From a statistical point of view, however, R 0 for the 1918 pandemic was a single observation of an extreme value, and it is very difficult to predict the magnitude of a single future extreme value drawn from the same distribution. Thus, the conclusions only hold under the assumption that a future influenza strain will be 'similarly' infectious. Nonetheless, it is important to have demonstrated that even for the worst influenza pandemic in recent history, R 0 was probably not large relative to other diseases. Stegeman et al. (2004) quantified between-flock transmission characteristics of highpathogenicity avian influenza, a virus in the Netherlands that led to the culling of 30 million birds in 2003. R 0 was calculated as the product of the infectious period at flock level and the transmission rate at flock level; however, neither parameter was measured directly. Instead, the infectious period was estimated as the period between the moment of detection and the moment of culling, plus 4 days. The transmission probability of the stochastic SEIR model was estimated by means of a generalized linear model. An estimate of the variance of R 0 was used to calculate the confidence interval for the period of infection and the transmission probability. A variety of potential control measures were evaluated.",

This result has important implications as it shows that the spread of BSE can be controlled for the extreme cases of infectivity, implying that this will be true for all intermediate models. These estimates of R 0 also suggest that BSE will not become endemic in the UK. A drawback of this model is that it assumes that underreporting of BSE cases does not exist after 1988.

They also found that, in order to reduce R 0 to a value less than unity, at least two of the three control measures should be applied.

West Nile virus. Wonham et al. (2004) derived a system of ODEs to describe the behaviour of West Nile virus. Their model consisted of susceptible, infectious, recovered and dead birds, and larval, susceptible, exposed and infectious mosquitoes. The next generation method was used to calculate R 0 from this model in order to evaluate the ability of the virus to invade the system. The calculated value of R 0 was then interpreted biologically as the square root of the product of (i) the disease R 0 from mosquitoes to birds and (ii) the R 0 from birds to mosquitoes. Each of these R 0 values was further analysed as a product of disease transmission and infectious lifespan in case (i) and the product of the transmission probability, the number of initially susceptible mosquitoes per bird that survive the exposed period and the bird's infectious lifespan in case (ii). R 0 was then used to establish a threshold mosquito level, above which the virus will invade a constant population of susceptible mosquitoes.",

Thus, R 0 was used to show that reducing the initial mosquito population below the calculated threshold would have prevented the West Nile outbreak for New York in 2000.

For multiple classes of infectives (e.g. vector-borne disease), we find examples both where R 0 is defined per generation, and examples where it is defined per infection cycle (see \u00a72.2). Owing to the usual limitations in using real data, we note that models typically used 'in the field' are simple, deterministic and nonstructured (but see Ferguson et al. 1999; Lloyd-Smith et al. 2003; Matthews et al. 2003; and Riley et al. 2003 for counter examples).",

First, R 0 is estimated in order to gauge the relative risk associated with a pathogen. These estimates are then used to compare the transmissibility of the disease to other well-known (and better understood) pathogens. Unfortunately, some time is needed to accrue sufficient incidence data for these estimates of R 0 , and typically, R 0 is only quantified after the epidemic has run its course, or is at least well established. The degree to which R 0 for one emerging infectious agent might be predictive of future novel pathogens is questionable (Mills et al. 2004 ). Furthermore, a numerical estimate of R 0 for a specific disease does not, in and of itself, inform public health measures. These values are instead used to justify severe or costly control measures (e.g. FMD; Ferguson et al. 2001; Matthews et al. 2003) , or less severe, more sustainable measures (e.g. malaria on Principe; Hagmann et al. 2003) .",

For example, it is possible that some patterns of quarantine may be roughly equivalent in their effect on R 0 , but may have different effects on the growth rate of the epidemic. Matthews et al. (2003) discuss the trade-off between reducing R 0 and culling as few animals as possible; Lipsitch et al. (2003) discuss similar trade-offs between reducing R 0 and burdening the population with excessive quarantine. These studies suggest that R 0 may not always be the best overall measure of control efficacy. In contrast, the total mortality or morbidity, the total number of affected farms and other such measures may offer more practical indicators of control success, and can be balanced against the associated costs (e.g. Gravenor et al. 2004) . We argue that R 0 may be somewhat overused in evaluating control measures, presumably because it is more readily calculated than these alternative indicators, and is widely recognized and understood.",
