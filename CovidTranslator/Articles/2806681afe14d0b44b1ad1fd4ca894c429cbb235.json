The general adaptations of the group include the development of an upright digital gait with most of the ani mal's weight borne on the central one or two digits, reduction of the medial and lateral digits, elongation of the distal por tions of the extremities for running, and, in some cases, modi fication of the digestive tract for a herbivorous diet. The two orders, Perissodactyla and Artiodactyla, appear to have devel oped hooves independently and are not closely related to each other.",

Even animals that were previously in good health prior to sale may have been substan tially stressed (e.g., by transportation, food or water depriva-tion, cold or heat exposure) and exposed to infectious agents in the process of marketing. The additional stresses of manipula tion, weighing, identification, and changes in husbandry im posed by the research facility may further compromise the ani mal's immune system.

The exact nature of the screening program will vary with the species, geographic area and associated en demic diseases, the needs of the particular research project, and economic considerations. Therefore, incoming animals should be given a thorough physical examination by a clinical veterinarian who is familiar with the particular species and as sociated diseases. In addition, samples of blood, feces, and other pertinent biological materials should be obtained for lab oratory evaluation. General guidelines are given below.

Sewage systems may require larger waste-liquid holding tanks that can be decontaminated and held for a period of time as needed, prior to pumping or release into the standard sewage system. Solid wastes are usually put into garbage cans with sealable lids that can have a liquid decontaminator added or have the outside sprayed with a disinfectant or covered with two autoclavable bags prior to moving into the dirty side exit room for holding or autoclaving. The use of double bagging protocol helps reduce accidental contamination. Autoclaves must be able to draw a complete vacuum to provide the deep steam penetration necessary for baled hay, straw wood shav ings, garbage cans, bagged whole or quartered animals. In some facilities, depending on the type of contaminants, these bagged materials or animals are incinerated instead of autoclaved.
