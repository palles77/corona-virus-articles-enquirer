            "text": "The well-known formula for the final size of an epidemic was published by Kermack and McKendrick in 1927 . Their analysis was based on a simple susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model that assumes exponentially distributed infectious periods. More recent analyses have established that the standard final size formula is valid regardless of the distribution of infectious periods, but that it fails to be correct in the presence of certain kinds of heterogeneous mixing (e.g., if there is a core group, as for sexually transmitted diseases). We review previous work and establish more general conditions under which Kermack and McKendrick's formula is valid. We show that the final size formula is unchanged if there is a latent stage, any number of distinct infectious stages and/or a stage during which infectives are isolated (the durations of each stage can be drawn from any integrable distribution). We also consider the possibility that the transmission rates of infectious individuals are arbitrarily distributed-allowing, in particular, for the existence of super-spreaders-and prove that this potential complexity has no impact on the final size formula. Finally, we show that the final size formula is unchanged even for a general class of spatial contact structures. We conclude that whenever a new respiratory pathogen emerges, an estimate of the expected magnitude of the epidemic can be made as soon the basic reproduction number R 0 can be approximated, and this estimate is likely to be improved only by more accurate estimates of R 0 , not by knowledge of any other epidemiological details.",

(5) below] depends only on the basic reproduction number, R 0 (the expected number of secondary cases caused by a typical primary case in a fully susceptible population).

It is also convenient to use B = (\u03b2 i j ) to denote the n \u00d7 n transmission matrix. Similar to our analysis of other models in previous sections, it is straightforward to prove that S i (\u221e), R i (\u221e), I i (\u221e) exist, that S i (\u221e) + R i (\u221e) = 1 and that I i (\u221e) = 0.

If we linearize the model (26) at the disease free equilibrium (DFE) (S i = 1, I i = 0, R i = 0), we see that the stability of the DFE is determined by \u03bb. If \u03bb/\u03b3 > 1, then the DFE is unstable, otherwise it is stable.

With the assumption that q = 1 \u2212 e \u2212R0 , Von Bahr and Martin-Lof (1980) and Scalia-Tomba (1985) showed that final size distribution for the traditional chain binomial model is asymptotically normal in the limit of large population size.

Infection control measures, such as those adopted during the 2003 SARS epidemic (Lipsitch et al., 2003; Wallinga and Teunis, 2004) , could have a dramatic effect on the final size; in this case, rather than R 0 , the reproduction number that is relevant for the final size formula must be calculated after sustainable precautionary measures have been put into place. Individual behavioral change could alter the transmission rate through time-dependence (\u03b2 = \u03b2(t), as in the case of imposed control measures) or through density-dependence (\u03b2 = \u03b2(I), with \u03b2 decreasing as I increases, which would arise if people tend to be more careful when they are aware of more cases).

This approximation is not valid in circumstances where infectious periods are substantial compared with life expectancy or where immunity decays rapidly. It will, however, typically be relevant whenever a new respiratory pathogen emerges, as in the case of the SARS outbreak in 2003 (Donnelly et al., 2003) or the emergence of a new subtype of influenza (Earn et al., 2002) . We are interested in growth or decay of I(\u03b2, ), which is determined only by Eq. (D.1b). Defining X(t) = \u221e 0 \u03b2 I(\u03b2, t) d\u03b2, multiplying both sides of Eq. (D.1b) by \u03b2, and integrating with respect to \u03b2, we find",

Thus, the DFE is stable if R 0 < 1 and unstable if R 0 > 1. We can expand model (21) to include multiple stages. Using the same techniques, we find that the conclusion that the epidemic threshold is given by R 0 = 1 remains valid.",
