The significantly increased likelihood indicates that a model with positive selection fits better (left panel). Model M7 was tested against M8. These models have categories that follow a beta distribution, while M8 allows for positive selection. The significantly increased likelihood indicates positive selection fits better. Since the likelihood ratios were significant (left panel), posterior probabilities were used to identify sites under positive selection.

Efk3B (wildtype cells) and cr3-8 (E. fuscus IRF3KO kidney) cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with GlutaMax (Gibco), 10% FBS and penicillin/streptomycin. PakiT03, PakiT03-4G (IRF3 KO), PakiT03-IFNAR2-4A and PakiT03-IFNAR2-IRF3-G6 dKO cells (P. alecto kidney cells) were maintained in DMEM supplemented with GlutaMax (Gibco), 10% FBS and penicillin/streptomycin. All cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C in humidified, 5% CO2 incubators. Cell lines were periodically tested for mycoplasma contamination. Stocks of genetically engineered vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV-GFP) carrying a GFP expression cassette (Noyce et al., 2011) were stored at -80\u00b0C. Virus stocks were thawed once and used for an experiment. A fresh vial was used for each experiment to avoid repeated freeze-thaws. Table S1 for gRNA sequence). 6 h post transfection, the transfection mixture was replaced with complete media containing 1% BSA. 60 h post transfection, the supernatant was harvested and virus was concentrated by ultracentrifugation. THF-IRF3 KO cells were infected with the lentivirus in complete media containing 0.1% polybrene. The following day, cells were passaged and seeded in 10 cm dishes in complete media containing hygromycin. 10 days later, single cell clones were selected and cultured over time. To characterize THF-IRF3-IFNAR1 dKO cells, we were unable to validate the knockout of IFNAR1 by immunoblots since commercially available antibodies did not crossreact with human IFNAR1. To overcome this limitation, we performed immunoblots to demonstrate the loss of IFNAR1-mediated downstream IFNa signalling and ISG56 expression in these cells (see supplementary figure S1D ). Briefly, THF-WT, THF-IFNAR1 KO and THF-IRF3-IFNAR1 dKO cells were treated with interferon from human leukocytes (Sigma) for 1 h and cell lysates were harvested for immunoblots. 25 \u00b5g of total protein per sample was analyzed by immunoblot for ISG56 and IRF3 protein expression.

Similarly, previously published P. alecto IFNAR2 knockout (PakiT03-IFNAR2-4A) cells were used to generate IFNAR2 and IRF3 double knockout cells (PakiT03-IFNAR2-IRF3-G6 dKO). To generate guide RNA targeting IRF3, exon sequence of IRF3 was submitted to an online software (http://tools.genomeengineering.org) to obtain potential gRNA targets (see Table S1 for gRNA sequences). The top hits were further subjected to BLAST (NCBI) analysis against P.alecto genome to exclude offtarget effects. Two gRNA sequences with high score and specificity were chosen for plasmid construction. The pSpCas9 (BB)-2A-GFP plasmid was used as a vector as previously published (Ran et al., 2013) . P. alecto immortalized kidney (PaKiT03) cell lines (Crameri et al., 2009) were seeded in 6-well plates at a concentration of 8\u00d710 5 cells/well and transfected with 1.5 \u03bcg of plasmid using Lipofectamine 3000 (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) as per manufacturer's recommendation.
