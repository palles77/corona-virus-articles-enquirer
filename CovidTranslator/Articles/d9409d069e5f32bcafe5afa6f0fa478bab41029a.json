            "text": "Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infections are wide-spread among the general population with manifestations ranging from asymptomatic to severe developmental disabilities in newborns and life-threatening illnesses in individuals with a compromised immune system. Nearly all current drugs suffer from one or more limitations, which emphasizes the critical need to develop new approaches and new molecules. We reasoned that a 'poly-pharmacy' approach relying on simultaneous binding to multiple receptors involved in HCMV entry into host cells could pave the way to a more effective therapeutic outcome. This work presents the study of a synthetic, small molecule displaying pleiotropicity of interactions as a competitive antagonist of viral or cell surface receptors including heparan sulfate proteoglycans and heparan sulfate-binding proteins, which play important roles in HCMV entry and spread. Sulfated pentagalloylglucoside (SPGG), a functional mimetic of heparan sulfate, inhibits HCMV entry into human foreskin fibroblasts and neuroepithelioma cells with high potency. At the same time, SPGG exhibits no toxicity at levels as high as 50-fold more than its inhibition potency. Interestingly, cell-ELISA assays showed downregulation in HCMV immediate-early gene 1 and 2 (IE 1&2) expression in presence of SPGG further supporting inhibition of viral entry. Finally, HCMV foci were observed to decrease significantly in the presence of SPGG suggesting impact on viral spread too. Overall, this work offers the first evidence that pleiotropicity, such as demonstrated by SPGG, may offer a new poly-therapeutic approach toward effective inhibition of HCMV.",

            "text": "Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), also known as human herpesvirus 5, is a widespread pathogen among human populations [1] [2] [3] . To establish a successful infection, HCMV depends on a unique set of immune evasion strategies, using encoded proteins and mRNA to avoid a competent innate and adaptive immune response [4] . HCMV-mediated infections are a recognized cause of morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised individuals as compared to otherwise healthy or immunocompetent individuals [5] [6] [7] . During the early stages of fetus development, HCMV infection in utero can result in disseminated infection with severe neurological impairments [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] . In addition, HCMV infection can also cause visual impairments in the form of retinitis, which is commonly seen in the AIDS population [15] [16] [17] . Interestingly, HCMV is capable of infecting multiple cell and tissue types, which suggests its ability to interact with a diverse array of host cell receptors to establish an infection [18] [19] [20] .",

            "text": "HCMV entry into host cells is extremely dynamic due to the usage of a variety of cellular entry receptors during virus-cell interactions [21] [22] [23] [24] . It has been shown that depending on the cell type, HCMV can utilize multiple target cell receptors, including cell surface heparan sulfate (HS), different cellular integrins, platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGF-R\u03b1), neuropilin-2 and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGF-R), for cellular entry [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] . On the flip side, HCMV's multiple viral glycoproteins, including gB, gO, and gH-gL, engage these structurally and functionally unrelated receptors to penetrate cellular defenses. For example, gB catalyzes membrane fusion between HCMV and infected cells, while gH/gL-containing complexes regulate viral tropism [24] . Interestingly, these viral glycoproteins contribute differently to different cell-types. Whereas the trimer of HCMV's gH-gL-gO is critical for infection in fibroblasts, a pentamer unit of gHgLpUL128-131A is essential for viral entry in epithelial, endothelial, and myeloid cells [32] [33] [34] . The distinctive ability of HCMV to utilize a diversity of cell surface receptors coupled to its exploitation of multiple glycoproteins to mediate entry pose a special challenge for drug discovery because of the possibility of several bypass mechanisms.",

The advantage with these mimetics is that these are fully synthetic, easily characterizable, and highly amenable to advanced rational drug design possibilities. We now have a library of some 150 non-saccharide mimetics of heparin/heparan sulfate with different structural scaffolds, diversity of sulfate groups, and molecular sizes [59, 60] . One of these agents is sulfated pentagalloylglucoside (SPGG) with a distinct structure to simultaneously mimic many different sequences of heparin/heparan sulfate ( Figure 1 ). The unique aspect of SPGG is its globular structure that theoretically can interact with diverse HS-binding proteins. In fact, our earlier work on SPGG has shown that it interacts with coagulation factor XIa [57, 61] and glycoprotein gD [50] , two completely different HS-binding proteins. Thus, we reasoned that the probability of targeting multiple proteins involved in cellular entry of HCMV, e.g., glycoprotein gB, PDGF-R, EGF-R, and neuropilin, would be higher with SPGG than with other non-saccharide mimetics developed so far. groups, and molecular sizes [59, 60] .

Although pleiotropicity, i.e., ability to bind to multiple targets, is dis-favored for drug discovery and development, the case of HCMV is unique. HCMV relies on multiple targets to gain access to different cell types and inhibiting all these pathways with a 'magic' bullet is likely to be extremely challenging. At the same time, without the development of such a pleiotropic inhibitor, the virus would probably find escape routes resulting in sub-optimal activity. Thus, we reasoned that SPGG is likely to afford the highest chance of success against HCMV, which could then become useful springboard for further development.",

HCMV relies on multiple targets to gain access to different cell types and inhibiting all these pathways with a 'magic' bullet is likely to be extremely challenging. At the same time, without the development of such a pleiotropic inhibitor, the virus would probably find escape routes resulting in sub-optimal activity. Thus, we reasoned that SPGG is likely to afford the highest chance of success against HCMV, which could then become useful springboard for further development.",

We utilized lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assay as a surrogate for cell viability, as described in the literature [62] . Briefly, rupture of plasma membranes due to apoptosis, necrosis, and other forms of cellular damage results in release of LDH into the cell culture supernatant, which can be quantified by an NADH coupled chromogenic reaction. We selected two different cell lines, Human Foreskin Fibroblasts (HFF-1) and neuroepithelioma cells (SK-N-MC), as it is well-established that HCMV infects and replicates in fibroblasts and neuronal cell types [18, 19, 63] . Figure 2 shows viability of both cell lines as a function of SPGG concentrations reaching up to 100 \u00b5M. Even after a 24-h incubation period, both cell lines exhibited essentially no morphological changes from the mock-treatment control (not shown). Likewise, neither cell line displayed any measurable increase in LDH activity even at the highest dose of SPGG. These results suggested that SPGG displayed no measurable cytotoxicity up to 100 \u00b5M in the tested cell lines. In fact, the LC 50 (lethal concentration for 50% cell death) is likely to be several fold higher because of complete absence of increase in LDH activity at 100 \u00b5M. necrosis, and other forms of cellular damage results in release of LDH into the cell culture supernatant, which can be quantified by an NADH coupled chromogenic reaction.

The relative decrease in GFP-puncta as a function of SPGG dose followed the traditional semi-log relationship with an IC 50 of 2.0 \u00b1 0.3 \u00b5M for HFF-1 and 1.8 \u00b1 0.2 \u00b5M for SK-N-MC cells (Figure 3 panels C, and F). In fact, at the maximal dose studied (100 \u00b5M), SPGG treatment almost completely abolished BAD32GFP internalization ( Figure 3B ,E). This implied that SPGG exhibit excellent 'therapeutic' window of more than 50 and 55-fold (ratio of LC 50 /IC 50 ), respectively for the two cell lines. . Cells were counterstained with phalloidin (red) and DAPI (blue) and images were processed and enumerated using ImageJ. The number of GFP-positive puncta detected in HFF-1 (C) and SK-N-MC (F) cells infected with HCMV exposed to different concentrations of SPGG was quantified in ImageJ using 3 random views per slide. The Graphs show a clear dose-dependent reduction in number of GFP-positive for both cell lines. Data are shown as mean value and SD for a triplicate experiment. Scale bar (A-E) = 50 \u00b5m.",

To test this expectation, we studied whether SPGG binds to gB using dot-blot hybridization and cell-ELISA assay. Figure 6 (panels A,B) shows the results of the dot-blot in the presence and absence of SPGG. As the concentration of SPGG increased to 100 \u00b5M, the gB signal reduced 30.5 \uf0b1 10% of the untreated control. Although a reduction in signal intensity at lower concentrations (<10 \u00b5M) was noticeable, the inhibition was not as robust as observed with IC50 profiles of viral entry or expression of genes (Figures 3 and 4 above) . To further test whether SPGG engages viral entry glycoprotein gB, we studied Chinese Hamster Ovary cells (CHO-K1) that over-express HCMV gB on cell surface. Dot-blot hybridization and cell-ELISA of CHO-K1 cells in the presence of 100 \u00b5M SPGG also led to reduction in gB signal intensity of 34.6 \uf0b1 20% in comparison to mock-treated controls ( Figure 6C ).",

These results are encouraging and likely support that SPGG binds to glycoprotein gB of HCMV, although its affinity is expected to be weaker (10 to 100 \u00b5M). One explanation for this is that the anti-gB antibody and SPGG do not compete ideally for the same site of binding on gB. It is possible that both competitors bind gB simultaneously, albeit in a partially competitive manner, resulting in a less robust competition. Another possibility is that SPGG mediates HCMV inhibition through multiple viral surface receptors, one of which is gB. The foundation for this expectation is that SPGG has been earlier shown to bind tightly to glycoprotein D of HSV [50, 51] . Likewise, SPGG also inhibits Chlamydia infection through binding to its cell surface receptors [66] . Finally, potential pathways that could be targeted by SPGG do exist, e.g., the engagement of one or more host cell surface receptors (e.g., PDGF-R, EGF-R, neuropilin, or others).

One of these proteins is glycoprotein gB of HCMV, which is a known heparin-binding protein [69, 70] . In fact, the design of this work, was based on the expectation that SPGG would bind to one of the viral surface glycoproteins. To test this expectation, we studied whether SPGG binds to gB using dot-blot hybridization and cell-ELISA assay. Figure 6 (panels A,B) shows the results of the dot-blot in the presence and absence of SPGG. As the concentration of SPGG increased to 100 \u00b5M, the gB signal reduced 30.5 \u00b1 10% of the untreated control. Although a reduction in signal intensity at lower concentrations (<10 \u00b5M) was noticeable, the inhibition was not as robust as observed with IC 50 profiles of viral entry or expression of genes (Figures 3 and 4 above) . To further test whether SPGG engages viral entry glycoprotein gB, we studied Chinese Hamster Ovary cells (CHO-K1) that over-express HCMV gB on cell surface. Dot-blot hybridization and cell-ELISA of CHO-K1 cells in the presence of 100 \u00b5M SPGG also led to reduction in gB signal intensity of 34.6 \u00b1 20% in comparison to mock-treated controls ( Figure 6C ).",

Complex interactions between viral envelope glycoproteins and host cell receptors come into play for successful entry [23, 24] . One reason why nature seems to have engineered multiplicity of such interactions is to ensure probability of success. To significantly reduce efficiency of entry, it is important to simultaneously impact these interactions. Thus, targeting only interactions of 3-O-sulfated or 6-O-sulfated species, inhibition of HCMV entry may not yield a clinically viable agent. Despite being small, SPGG presents a diverse library of sulfated species that could bind all possible heparan sulfate binding receptors, thereby impeding viral recognition. This appears to be the case because SPGG binding to glycoprotein gB explains only part of the inhibition effect. Thus, pleiotropicity of SPGG interactions may be a key reason for its high anti-HCMV potency.",

As yet no sulfated biopolymer has been demonstrated to display this phenomenon. This finding is important because the products of immediate early genes are essential for viral DNA replication. Therefore, SPGG-like small molecule that display this phenomenon may offer novel strategies for inhibiting HCMV. Likewise, the reduction in viral spread adds more value to the inhibitory role of SPGG. It is important to note that the teratogenicity and toxicity of available HCMV antiviral agents make treatment options during early development markedly limited.",

In terms of drug discovery, this is still a considerable limitation and better analogs of SPGG will have to be designed and evaluated. It would also be important to identify the receptor targets engaged by SPGG. Likewise, it would be also important to identify whether certain viral entry pathways are preferentially targeted by SPGG to develop strategies for further drug development. Thus, SPGG is only the first probe for anti-HCMV drug discovery.",
