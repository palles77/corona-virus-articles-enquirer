In this study, we investigated the prevalence and clinical characteristics of children with virus-related ARTIs and determined the spectrum of respiratory viruses and their correlation with meteorological variables in Jiading District, Shanghai, China. Nasopharyngeal swabs from 2819 children with ARTIs were collected from August 2011 to December 2014, and used for detection of respiratory viruses by multiplex RT-PCR. Seventeen respiratory viruses were detected among 691 (24.5 %) of 2819 patients. The highest prevalence of respiratory viruses was detected in the age group of less than 1 year (29.0 %), and the prevalence decreased with age. This suggests that children less than one year old are the most susceptible to infection. Influenza virus (IFV) was the most frequently detected virus (5.8 %), followed by parainfluenza virus (PIV) (5.7 %), enterovirus (EV) (4.3 %), and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (3.6 %). Statistical analysis showed that epidemics of IFV, PIV and EV had distinct seasonal variations. Mean monthly temperature appeared to be the only meteorological factor associated with IFV and PIV infection. These findings will provide valuable information for decisionmaking, prevention and treatment of ARTIs in children.",

The majority of them (1189, 67.4 %) were between 1 and 6 years old. The ratio of boys to girls was 1.32 (Table 1) . Among 2819 clinical samples from the recruited children with ARTIs, 691 (24.5 %) samples were found to be respiratory virus positive. There was no significant difference in the incidence of respiratory viral infection between boys (392/1603; 24.5 %) and girls (299/ 1216; 24.6 %) (v 2 = 0.007, p = 0.934). The respiratory virus positive rate was significantly different among the different age groups (v 2 = 10.967, p = 0.012). The positive rate appeared to decrease with age. Children less than one year old had the highest positive rate of 29.0 % (94/324). The positive rate decreased to 25.9 % (197/762) and 24.7 % (281/1137) for the age groups of 1-3 and 3-6 years old, respectively. The lowest positive rate was observed in the age group of more than 6 years old (119/596; 20.0 %) ( Table 1) . A statistically significant difference was observed between the age group of less than 1 year old and the age group of more than 6 years old (v 2 = 9.653, p = 0.002). No statistically significant difference was observed among the other age groups.",

            "text": "Infections with respiratory viruses are the most common causes of ARTIs in children. They can lead to serious diseases such as bronchiolitis and pneumonia and sometimes even cause death in infants and children worldwide [15] . In China, the positive rates of respiratory viruses in children with ARTIs or influenza-like illness (ILI) range from 37.6 to 78.7 % [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] . The positive rates appear to be slightly different in different regions, which may be attributed to different years and regional variation, as well as a lack of unified methodology. However, a large-scale surveillance based on 39,756 children with ARTIs in central China showed that the prevalence was only 13.1 %, substantially lower than that found in other studies [16] . Similarly, in this study, we found that the prevalence of respiratory viruses was 24.5 % among 2891 children with ARTIs from August 2011 to December 2014 in Jiading district of Shanghai, significantly lower than those (59.5 % and 78.7 %) obtained from two previous studies based on 817 children with ARTIs during 2006 to 2008 [17] (v 2 =353.907, p\\0.001), and 164 children with ARTIs from May 2009 to July 2010 [20] (v 2 =227.960, p\\0.001) in Shanghai. This may imply that it is important to have a large sample size in the investigation. We found that the prevalence of respiratory viruses was similar between boys and girls, suggesting that there was no bias for respiratory viral infection with regard to gender. However, the prevalence appeared to decrease with age, with the highest prevalence of 29.0 % in the age group of less than 1 year old ( Table 1 ). One possible reason is that children younger than 1 year old are more susceptible to infection with respiratory viruses than older children are. Another reason might be that children younger than 1 year old are more likely to be brought to the hospital when exhibiting symptoms of ARTIs than older children are.",

In this study, we investigated 2819 children with ARTIs and found that IFV, PIV and RSV were still the most common viruses, together with EV. Compared to the previous study [6] , we detected a decreasing prevalence (0.6 %) of HRV. One possible reason was that relatively severe cases (e.g., sudden onset of fever [38, cough or sore throat and difficulty breathing) were enrolled in the previous study [6, 7] , which resulted in a higher detection rate. On the other hand, the genotypes of certain respiratory viruses also vary over time. A genotype shift of RSV was observed in Chongqing and Shanghai from 2006 to 2012 [14, 17, 18] .

The prevalence of IFV appeared to be significantly negatively correlated with mean monthly temperature, while the prevalence of PIV was significantly positively correlated with mean monthly temperature. Since 2000, a nationwide surveillance network for influenza has been implemented in the People's Republic of China. Sentinel hospitals of the network are required to upload their daily influenza-like illness case numbers to the database of Chinese Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The national data will help to draw a definite conclusion on the correlation of the prevalence of respiratory viruses with the meteorological variables.",

The high prevalence of RSV in summer differed from what has been observed in previous studies [11] , and the majority of the cases detected in summer were from July 2012, suggesting a partial outbreak of RSV during a short period. Because RSV sequences were not obtained from the samples from July 2012 [14] , we were unable to determine the reason for this unusual RSV outbreak.",

We found that the prevalence of respiratory viruses decreased with age and that the highest prevalence (29.0 %) occurred in children less than 1 year old, suggesting that children younger than 1 year old are the most susceptible to infection with respiratory viruses. Multiple respiratory viruses were detected in children with ARTIs in Jiading district of Shanghai. IFV, PIV, EV, and RSV were the dominant respiratory viruses, with prevalence of 5.8 %, 5.7 %, 4.3 %, and 3.6 %, respectively. The prevalence of IFV, PIV and EV exhibited distinct seasonal variation. The prevalence of IFV and PIV was significantly negatively and positively correlated with mean monthly temperature, which was the only meteorological factor associated with IFV and PIV infection. ",
