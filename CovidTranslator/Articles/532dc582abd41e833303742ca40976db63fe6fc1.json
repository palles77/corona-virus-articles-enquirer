A major driver of these gene expression changes is a virally encoded, messenger RNA (mRNA)-specific endonuclease termed SOX. SOX cleaves the majority of cytoplasmic mRNAs, but does so at specific internal sites loosely defined by a degenerate sequence motif. If and how RNA sequence directs SOX targeting remained unknown. To address these questions, we used recombinant, highly purified SOX endonuclease in a series of biochemical assays to reconstitute the cleavage reaction in vitro and gain significant insight into the biochemical mechanism of both SOX target recognition and endonucleolytic cleavage. Using this system, we determined that cut site specificity is preserved with purified SOX and a validated target RNA and thus does not require additional cellular cofactors.

By changing overall messenger RNA (mRNA) abundance or translation, viruses can redirect host machinery towards viral gene expression while simultaneously dampening immune stimulatory signals (1) (2) (3) . Suppression of host gene expression, termed host shutoff, can occur via a variety of mechanisms, but one common strategy is to accelerate degradation of mRNA (1, 2) . This occurs during infection with DNA viruses such as In cells, the mRNA fragments resulting from the primary SOX endonucleolytic cleavage are predominantly cleared by the host 5'-3' exonuclease XRN1, while in vitro, RNA fragments are rapidly degraded by 5'-3' exonucleolytic activity intrinsic to purified SOX (9) .

The minimum sequence required to directly cut the putative cleavage site in LIMD1 in cells was mapped to a 54 nucleotide segment (LIMD1 54), and we therefore chose this as our model substrate to study SOX targeting in vitro (20) . We first expressed and purified KSHV SOX to greater then 95 percent purity from SF9 insect cells ( fig. S1A ). Using the LIMD1 54 substrate, we plotted the observed rate constant (k obs ) as a function of SOX concentration, yielding a Hill coefficient of n = 1.11 ( Fig. 1A) . Thus, in agreement with previous observations (9, 10) , SOX appears to function predominantly as a monomer. Under conditions of half maximal activity (2 \u00b5M; Fig. 1A ), SOX displayed a strong preference for the \"hard\" divalent metal Mg 2+ and a weaker preference for the \"softer\" and larger metals Mn 2+ , Co 2+ , and Zn 2+ (Fig. 1B) . This is again consistent with other characterized members of the P/DExK family of enzymes (9, 22) .",

This is likely the result of increased coordination partners engaged by Ca 2+ , which decreases the ability of catalytic residues to promote proper base hydrolysis (23-25). Finally, increasing the NaCl concentration above 100 mM led to substantially decreased SOX activity (Fig. 1D ), in accordance with the observation that high salt concentrations frequently inhibit nuclease activity by disrupting protein-protein or protein-substrate interactions (25). Given that recombinant SOX displays robust 5'-3' exonuclease activity (9, 10) , we sought to confirm that LIMD1 54 was subject to endonucleolytic SOX cleavage, as this is the predominant event that directs mRNA turnover in SOX expressing cells (3, 16) . Both the 5' and 3' ends LIMD1 54 were blocked by capping the 5' end with a Cy5 fluorophore and the 3' end with an Iowa Black quencher (LIMD1 54 Flo). We confirmed this RNA was resistant to degradation by the 5'-phosphate dependent exonuclease terminator (Fig. 1E, lane 3) . However, in the presence of SOX, a cleavage product was observed that correlated with an endonucleolytic cut (Fig. 1E, lane 2) .",

However, our data showing a 10-fold difference in binding affinity between two in vivo validated SOX substrates suggested that a more extended interaction surface might distinguish optimal from suboptimal RNA substrates. We therefore used RNA footprinting to map the SOX binding sites on LIMD1 54. Indeed, SOX robustly protected 3 LIMD1 54 adenosines (positions 20-24) from RNase I digestion in a dose dependent manner (Fig. 4) .

We also observed a modest protection of base 27 (G) located directly adjacent to the predicted cleavage site of SOX, which represents the region detected in the crystal structure of K2-31 bound to SOX.

Here, through the development of the first biochemical system to faithfully recapitulate the internal cleavage specificity observed for SOX in cells, we revealed how both RNA sequence and structure contribute to targeting. These findings resolve a central feature of the current model of SOX activity ( Figure 7 ). Previous observations established that sequences flanking the cut site were required to direct cleavage by SOX (16, 20) . However, it was unresolved whether they played a strictly structural role in presenting an exposed loop for cleavage, served as a platform for SOX binding, or created a binding site for one or more cellular factors that then indirectly recruited SOX to its targets. Through a combination of mutational analyses, RNA structure probing, and RNA footprinting assays, we showed that efficient SOX targeting requires both an exposed loop structure and upstream sequences that serve as a SOX binding platform. This combination of sequence and structural features within the targeting motif helps explain why some mRNAs are efficiently cleaved by SOX, whereas others are weaker substrates.",

            "text": "A key open question related to SOX function is how it can target the majority of mRNAs in cells, yet with significant site specificity. These observations suggest that there must be specific mRNA features that influence targeting. Indeed, PARE-seq analyses of cleavage intermediates in SOX expressing cells revealed that cleavage sites were associated with a degenerate sequence motif (20). Sequences proximal to the cleavage .

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/320929 doi: bioRxiv preprint site were predicted to be un-base paired and frequently contained a polyadenosine stretch followed by a purine (20). The importance of these sequence features for SOX targeting was validated for the LIMD1 transcript in cells (20). Because LIMD1 has been established as a particularly robust SOX target in cells (20), we reasoned that it must contain features optimal for SOX processing and therefore would be an ideal substrate to dissect these features biochemically. Indeed, SOX binding to LIMD1 54 was 10-fold better than to the commonly used reporter substrate GFP, and an order of magnitude better than to the K2-31 pre-miRNA, which has not been demonstrated to be processed by SOX in cells. Importantly, these binding differences correlated with the efficiency of SOX cleavage in vitro, arguing that the ability to bind the targeting motif is a key step in target recognition. Through RNA footprinting assays, we were able to show that SOX binds to a bulge structure proximal to the cleavage site containing the polyadenosine stretch previously predicted to be important (20). Mutating either the bulge structure (LIMD1 zipper) or maintaining the bulge but mutating the polyadenosine stretch (LIMD1 3xA-G) resulted in an order of magnitude reduction in binding affinity, correlating with a dramatic decrease in cleavage efficiency. Collectively, these data demonstrate that variability in the efficiency of SOX targeting observed in cells is likely due to differences in RNA sequences that mediate SOX binding.",

Our data suggest that this is likely because the K2-31 RNA lacks the additional residues necessary for SOX binding site found in both LIMD1 and GFP.",

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/320929 doi: bioRxiv preprint While the K2-31 RNA does contain adenosines upstream of the cleavage site, structural predictions indicate these residues are within a stem region (21), rather than in an exposed loop as is the case for LIMD1 and GFP. Together, these observations indicate that while upstream adenosines are important for binding, they must be present in an unpaired state to promote SOX binding. It is notable that prior studies reported much weaker interactions between SOX and RNA (K d = 75 \u00b5M) compared to its DNA substrates (K d = 1 \u00b5m) (9, 10, 21). However, in these cases binding assays were conducted with scrambled RNA sequences.

A FRET probe with excitation at 646 nM and emission at 662 nM (LIMD1 54 Flo) was purchased from Dharmacon. The RNA FRET probe was added at a final concentration of to reactions using a 1:1000 dilution of the enzyme. reactions were quenched at indicated time intervals with equal volumes of stop solution containing 95 % formamide and 10 mM EDTA, then resolved using urea-PAGE and visualized using a Typhoon variable mode imager (GE Halthcare).
