            "text": "Bovine coronavirus (BCV) was detected by reverse transcriptase-PCR, immune electron microscopy or virus isolation from adult cows at 6 out of 6 outbreaks of epizootic diarrhea in Japan. Six BCVs isolated in feces, intestinal content or tracheal exudate of the cows were analyzed for their antigenic properties by cross virus neutralization (VN) tests. The isolates were divided into two groups, one of which had closely related antigenicity with the reference Mebus and Kakegawa strains of BCV, and another which showed significant differences in VN antibody titers from the reference strains. Two isolates in the latter group, which were from the enteric and respiratory tracts of the same cows, respectively, were distinguished from each other by ELISA using monoclonal antibodies against the Kakegawa strain. The isolates showed various hemagglutination and receptor destroying enzyme titers against chicken or mouse erythrocytes. * Bovine coronavirus (BCV) belongs to antigenic group 2 of the Coronaviridae, and possesses four major structural proteins, the nucleocapsid protein N, the integral membrane glycoprotein (gp) M, the hemagglutinin-esterase gp HE and the spike gp S [4]. It is known that both HE and S gps are involved in hemagglutination (HA) activity. The HE gp is a less potent hemagglutinin than the S gp, as it only agglutinates erythrocytes from mice and rats and not those from adult chickens. The HE gp also exhibits receptor destroying enzyme (RDE) activity [4] .",

In each outbreak, diarrhea spread to most of the adult cows at each farm within 1 week. No respiratory symptoms were observed in any cow. A total of 35 field samples were diluted 1:10 in Eagle's minimal essential medium (EMEM), clarified by low-speed centrifugation (2,500 \u00d7 g for 10 min), and used for reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) (30 samples at 5 outbreaks), immune electron microscopy (IEM) (31 samples at 5 outbreaks), and virus isolation (VI) (20 samples at 6 outbreaks). These feces and intestinal contents were also tested for group A rotavirus by latex agglutination tests (Rotascreen; Microgen Bioproducts Ltd., UK), and for Salmonella spp., Campylobacter spp., Coccidium spp. and Cryptosporidium spp. by using standard techniques. Serum samples were also collected from 21 cows at the 3 farms at the acute and convalescent phases of the disease.

CPE characterized by syncytium formation on HRT-18 cells was observed after two to three serial passages. Cross VN tests were performed with antisera against the 5 isolates and 2 reference strains. The antisera against the reference strains showed 8 to 32-fold lower VN antibody titers to the 96C1, 96CT2, 96CE3 and 96C4 strains than to the homologous strains. The antisera against these 4 isolates also showed 4 to 16-fold lower VN antibody titers to the reference strains than to the homologous isolates ( Table  2 ). According to the results, the isolates were divided into two groups. The first group (95C6 and 95C7) showed closely related antigenicity with the reference strains of BCV. The rest of the isolates showed significant antigenic differences from the reference strains of BCV. Although all BCVs reacted in ELISA with 2 Mabs recognizing the N protein (1D11 and 2C8), various reactivities of the isolates with 2 Mabs recognizing the S These results clearly show that the isolates were divided into three groups (Table  3) . Interestingly, the 95C6 and 95C7 strains were distinguished from the reference strains by the reactivities of the Mab 4H4, whereas these two isolates revealed similar antigenicity to the reference strains by VN tests using polyclonal antisera. Similarly, although the 96CE3 strain was differentiated from the reference strains by the VN tests, the reactivities of this isolate to the Mabs were similar to those of the reference strains. Surprisingly, the 96CE3 and 96CT2 strains isolated in the large intestinal content and tracheal exudate from the same cow, respectively, had different reactivity patterns against anti-S gp Mabs. The HA and RDE titers of semipurified BCV strains are summarized in Table  4 . All strains agglutinated mouse erythrocytes at 4 \u2022 C with similar HA titers, and no distinct differences except for the 95C6 and 95C7 strains were observed in HA titers against mouse erythrocytes at 4 \u2022 C and 37 \u2022 C. All strains also agglutinated chicken erythrocytes at 4 \u2022 C, but the HA titers varied among the strains. At 37 \u2022 C, most of the strains did not agglutinate chicken erythrocytes. RDE activity with chicken erythrocytes was detected in all strains of BCV. RDE activity with mouse erythrocytes was detected only in the 95C6 and 95C7 strains. The differences in HA titers at 4 \u2022 C and 37 \u2022 C showed good agreement with the RDE titers. This suggests that comparison of HA titers at 4 \u2022 C and 37 \u2022 C might provide an alternative method for evaluating RDE activity. a Expressed as the reciprocal of the highest dilution of virus causing complete disappearance of HA patterns at 4 \u2022 C after 2 h incubation at 37 \u2022 C b The 96CT2 and 96CE3 strains were isolated from the tracheal exudate and large intestinal content of a dead adult cow, respectively c log 10 TCID 50 /ml Bovine coronavirus is known as a primary pathogen in neonatal calf diarrhea. The virus is also associated with winter dysentery of adult cattle. In Japan, BCV has been reported as the etiological agent in adult cattle with epizootic diarrhea [28] that occurred throughout the entire country. In the present study, we tried to detect BCV in feces, intestinal contents or tracheal exudate from 33 adult cows at 6 outbreaks of epizootic diarrhea by the RT-PCR, IEM and VI tests. The rate of positive reactions was very high in the RT-PCR (16 of 30 samples at 5 of 5 outbreaks) and IEM (19 of 31 samples at 5 of 5 outbreaks), and the results of these 2 tests showed good agreement. No association with other pathogens was observed in these samples. These results suggest that BCV might be associated with epizootic diarrhea of adult cattle at these outbreaks. Also, the RT-PCR developed in this study may be useful for detecting BCV. Interestingly, BCV was detected by RT-PCR and IEM in 4 of 5 fecal samples from adult cows at the outbreak of epizootic diarrhea in August. Several papers have reported that cold stress, e.g. chilling due to low environmental temperatures including cold drinking water or wide fluctuations in temperatures, is a important risk factor to initiate winter dysentery [17, 32] . The present study indicated that cold stress might not always be needed to initiate adult cow diarrhea associated with BCV.",

The HE gp is a less potent hemagglutinin than the S gp, therefore it only agglutinates mouse and rat erythrocytes but not chicken erythrocytes which possess fewer surface receptors [23] . Some BCV-infected cell culture supernatants did not agglutinate chicken erythrocytes at 4 \u2022 C (data not shown), as similar results were reported previously [27] . Thus, the BCV strains were semipurified from infected cell culture supernatants, which were concentrated approximately 50-fold. All semipurified strains agglutinated chicken erythrocytes at 4 \u2022 C, but variations of HA titers were observed among strains. This result suggests that the differences of receptor binding properties of the S gp exist among BCV strains. High RDE activity against mouse erythrocytes was observed in some strains, which was not observed in the previous reports [27, 30] . These high RDE titers with mouse erythrocytes could be explained by the fact that the RDE activity of these strains is higher than other strains because detection of this activity with mouse erythrocytes is harder than with chicken erythrocytes for these abundant surface receptors.",
