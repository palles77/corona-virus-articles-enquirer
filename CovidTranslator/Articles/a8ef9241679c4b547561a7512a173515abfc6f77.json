The VP7 protein is the main coat protein of PoRV, and the S protein is the main structural protein of PEDV, which are capable of inducing neutralizing antibodies in vivo. In this study, a DNA vaccine pPI-2.EGFP.VP7.S co-expressing VP7 protein of PoRV and S protein of PEDV was constructed. Six 8-week-old mice were immunized with the recombinant plasmid pPI-2.EGFP.VP7.S. The high humoral immune responses (virus specific antibody) and cellular immune responses (IFN-\u03b3, IL-4, and spleen lymphocyte proliferation) were evaluated. The immune effect through intramuscular injection increased with plasmid dose when compared with subcutaneous injection. The immune-enhancing effect of IFN-\u03b1 adjuvant was excellent compared with pig spleen transfer factor and IL-12 adjuvant. These results demonstrated that pPI-2.EGFP.VP7.S possess the immunological functions of the VP7 proteins of PoRVand S proteins of PEDV, indicating that pPI-2.EGFP.VP7.S is a candidate vaccine for porcine rotaviral infection (PoR) and porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED).",

PoRV belong to the genus Rotavirus in the family Reoviridae [14] , which can infect pigs of all ages, especially piglets, and cause diarrhea and vomit dehydration. Since it was first isolated from swine waste in 1974, PoRV has become a global epidemic these days [7] . Even though some genes in PoRV genome can limit the host selection, some animal rotavirus is likely across host barrier to infect humans, seriously affecting the health of the human intestine. A previous study of rotaviral strains circulating among Brazilian children provided the evidence of transmission of RVC from swine to human [4] .",

The S gene and VP7 gene fragments were incorporated into pPI-2.EGFP vector. The recombinant plasmid pPI-2.EGFP.VP7.S was characterized by PCR and restriction enzyme analysis (Fig. 1 ). To verify that recombinant plasmid pPI-2.EGFP.VP7.S was capable of expressing proteins in cells, the expression of a target gene of plasmids in BHK-21 cells was detected by Western blot. As shown in Fig. 2 , 98 KD band was observed on the NC membrane (Fig. 2) , which is similar to the predicted molecular weight of VP7-S.",

In this study, Linker engineering was introduced between PoRV VP7 gene and PEDV S gene. Bioinformatics analysis found that the basic biological activities of VP7 gene and S gene in fusion gene kept unchanged, which indicated that linker would not affect the protein structure and biological function.

The results showed that eliciting powerful and long-lasting humoral and cellular immune response can be induced in vaccinated mice. The immune effect of intramuscular injection was better than subcutaneous injection. This phenomenon could be due to the structure of muscle cell, belonging to multinucleated cells that have plenty of sarcoplasmic reticulum and the transverse tubular system containing extracellular fluid, and deeply wear into the muscle cells [2] . So muscle cells are suitable for the intake and expression of DNA. The levels of PEDV and PoRV IgG in mice serum of high dose group (200 \u03bcg) were significantly higher than that of middle (100 \u03bcg) and low (50 \u03bcg) dose groups (P < 0.05).

The effect of IFN-\u03b1 as vaccine adjuvant has been discussed a lot over the years. IFN-\u03b1 can exert its antiviral effect by stimulating the body to produce anti-viral proteins and inducing the body to produce adaptive immune response to eliminate invading pathogens. Meanwhile, IFN-\u03b1 associates with the production of antibody. It is reported that IFN-I is the necessary signal of B cell differentiating into plasma cell. Although there lack of evidence of IFN-I can produce antigen specific B cells, B cells cannot be further activated and produce neutralizing antibody [10] . Cheng G et al. found that IFN-\u03b1 induced strong induction of FMDV-specific neutralizing antibody and significant T cell-mediated immune responses through IFN-a as an adjuvant for a recombinant FMD protein vaccine [3] . The ability of IL-12 to induce protective immunity through enhancing proliferation of T cells and NK cells, increasing cytolytic activities of T cells, NK cells, and macrophages, activating T helper 1 (Th1) cells, and inducing production of IFN-\u03b3 and other cytokines [13] . Transfer factor can activate T lymphocytes and enhance the cellular immunity and humoral immunity. Wang R et al. found that transfer factor of pig spleen could increase cellular immunity function through inactivated porcine parvovirus oil emulsion vaccine by co-inoculating porcine transfer factor in mice, which had wide development value as immune adjuvant [20] . With the restricting of antibiotics, transfer factor will have advantage of epidemic disease preventing and curing on livestock and poultry.",

The effect of the DNA vaccine was evaluated in mice. The DNA vaccine pPI-2.EGFP.VP7.S showed a well immunogenicity through adjust dose, approach, and adjuvant in eliciting a humoral Fig. 6 The mice were immunized with different doses, approaches, and adjuvant. In addition, the empty vector pPI-2.EGFP, PBS, PoRV, and PEDV were used as controls. The proliferation of mouse spleen lymphocytes.was analyzed by MTT assays with ConA. The y-axis represents the lymphocyte proliferation levels (OD490). Different capitals at the same time represent the difference was extremely (P < 0.01), different small letters represent the difference was stastically (P < 0.05) Serum samples were collected at 42 dpi to determine the cytokines IFN-\u03b3 (a) and IL-4 (b). Different capitals represent the difference was extremely significant (P < 0.01), different small letters represent the statistically difference was stastically significant (P < 0.05) and cellular responses against PoRV and PEDV. Results showed the feasibility of using pPI-2.EGFP.VP7.S as a candidate DNA vaccine for PoR and PED. ",
