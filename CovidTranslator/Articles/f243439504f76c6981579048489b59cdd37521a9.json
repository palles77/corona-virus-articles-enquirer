During the interval between 19 February and 23 February 2020, Iran reported its first 43 cases, with 8 deaths. Three exported cases originating in Iran were identified, suggesting an underlying burden of disease in that country greater than that indicated by reported cases. A large epidemic in Iran could further fuel global dissemination of COVID-19.",

Because exported cases were identified in United Arab Emirates (UAE), Lebanon, and Canada, we used the methods of Fraser and colleagues (3) to estimate the size of the underlying epidemic in Iran that would be needed for these cases to be observed with a reasonable probability. To estimate the time at risk for COVID-19 exposure among travelers departing Iran, we obtained data from the United Nations World Tourism Organization for the proportion of international travelers who are residents of Iran (4) and the average length of stay of tourists to Iran (5) , and assumed that the Iranian outbreak began in early January 2020. We evaluated the relationship between the strength of travel links with Iran and the ranking of destination countries on the Infectious Disease Vulnerability Index (IDVI), a validated metric that estimates the capacity of a country to respond to an infectious disease outbreak. Scores range from 0 to 1, with higher scores reflecting greater capacity to manage infectious outbreaks.",

Vulnerability is measured at the country level by using the IDVI score, with a lower value indicating reduced capacity to respond to outbreaks.

As such, we performed exploratory analyses in which we assumed that an unidentified exported case of COVID-19 was present in Iraq, Syria, Azerbaijan, or all 3 countries, in addition to Lebanon, Canada, and UAE, and estimated the outbreak size in Iran that would produce these results (Figure 2) . We also evaluated a scenario in which we assumed perfect case detection in travelers from Iran, such that disease is truly absent in countries not reporting cases. Under this \"best-case\" scenario, the estimated outbreak size in Iran was smaller but still substantial (1820 cases [CI, 380 to 5320 cases]).",

Our analysis would be modified by travel restrictions from Iran due to the recent political situation and by variations in the R 0 value. Further, the lack of identified COVID-19 cases in countries with far closer travel ties to Iran suggests that cases in these countries are probably being missed rather than being truly absent. This is concerning, both for public health in Iran itself and because of the high likelihood for outward dissemination of the disease to neighboring countries with lower capacity to respond to infectious disease epidemics. Supporting capacity for public health initiatives in the region is urgently needed. ",
