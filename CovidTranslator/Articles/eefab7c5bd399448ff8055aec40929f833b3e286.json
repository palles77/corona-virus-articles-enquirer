Protracted development times, a high liability risk (vaccines are given to healthy people) and only a low rate of return have curbed the enthusiasm of big companies for vaccine R&D. Even if the worldwide vaccine market grows to $10 billion by 2006 (ref. 1), as predicted by Merrill Lynch (New York), it will represent only a fraction of the revenues on drugs. But the availability of funding from the US government's biodefense program is making biotech companies take a closer look. The result is a slew of novel treatments and technologies for speeding up the development of new vaccine candidates ( Table 1) .",

Unfortunately, a microbe's surfaceexposed antigens are often ineffective in eliciting protective immunity. In a refinement of this technique, vaccinologists have purified protein subunits of their targets and injected these subunits into laboratory animals or even human volunteers to try to identify the best antigens. In the 1980s, the application of genetic engineering also allowed the first recombinant subunit vaccines to be produced, circumventing the problem of contamination by blood components or products. Results have been mixed. For many pathogens, the most antigenic proteins may be expressed at very low levels, complicating identification and purification, or the purification procedure may destroy the antigen's structure.",

The company's main product is a CpG-containing oligonucleotide, which binds to the complement 'toll-like receptor 9.' As the first companies that tried to develop antisense oligonucleotide therapies discovered, CpG-containing sequences provide a strong but nonspecific boost to the immune system. This was an enormous disappointment for the nascent antisense industry, which had hoped for a highly specific gene-silencing response, but Coley is hoping to make this lemon into lemonade.",

            "text": "\"Years from now, I think that CpG will be the standard adjuvant that's used in all vaccines, because it has so many advantages,\" says Arthur Krieg, Coley's CSO. The oligonucleotides seem to provide a stronger immunological boost than competing products, like aluminum hydroxide (alum), the main adjuvant used in human vaccines for nearly 80 years. \"The current FDA regimen for the anthrax vaccine is six doses over a period of 18 months,\" says Krieg, but with CpG adjuvants, \"you get protective responses within one or at most two doses in the vast majority of people.\" Interestingly, the CpG adjuvant also provides some short-term protection against a wide range of pathogens on its own, suggesting that it could be useful in the immediate aftermath of a disease outbreak, even before the specific pathogen is known. Coley has received biodefense grants to study this aspect of the compound, and the company is also collaborating with several major vaccine manufacturers.",

Meanwhile, the old ways sometimes work surprisingly well, when researchers are given sufficient motivation. Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), for example, is caused by a coronavirus, a family of viruses long familiar to veterinary researchers. One company, Sinovac Biotech (Beijing, China) is already starting clinical trials on a promising SARS vaccine, and several others have gotten positive preclinical results. But Sinovac's product is based on one of the oldest and simplest vaccination strategies: it contains whole, killed virus.",

            "text": "When government officials talk about the new funding for biodefense, they often draw analogies to the space program. For many researchers, even those receiving substantial biodefense funding, the analogy is strained. \"The perception is that the government is putting huge chunks of money into this area, but in reality it seems to be many small chunks, so for a company to really invest a lot of time and effort into a completely novel technology for biodefense...is just something most companies are not doing,\" says James Robl, president of Hematech (Sioux Falls, SD, USA).Biodefense grants can be used only to fund specific products that do not otherwise have commercial potential, but the underlying technologies are often modifiable for other projects. In fact, many companies now working on biodefense have simply borrowed methods that they were already developing for other, more profitable purposes. \"It's a great way to help develop a technology, and it's a great way to potentially test your system and put some products on the market, but you really can't build a business plan around [biodefense],\" says Robl.Others contend that for some types of products, the new funding has been critical. \"The amount of money required to come up with a new adjuvant, plus the risk of coming up with new antigens for a vaccine...makes the risk enormous and the reward capped. If government didn't step in to provide incentives, I don't think it would happen,\" says Robert Bratzler, president and CEO of Coley Pharmaceuticals (Wellesley, MA, USA), who adds, \"I suspect in time we'll look back and say 'it's a good thing we did this.'\" Steven Projan, assistant vice president of discovery research at Wyeth-Ayerst Research (Philadelphia, PA, USA), agrees that government vaccine funding is important, but argues that \"the money we're investing should not be focused narrowly on a subset of pathogens we think would be used as bioterror agents, but we need to broaden our focus to the whole field of microbiology. As we learned with SARS, we never know where the next emerging pathogen is going to come from.\"",
