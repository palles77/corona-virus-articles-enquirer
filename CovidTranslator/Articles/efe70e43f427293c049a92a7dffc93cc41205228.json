            "text": "Respi ratory viral infections (RVI) are common in immunocompromised patients and have been associated with significant morbidity and mortality ap-proaching 20%. 1, 2 Lung transplant recipients have a unique predisposition to infection because of diminished cough reflex, abnormal lymphatic drainage, impaired mucociliary clearance and pre-existing airways damage with obliterative bronchiolitis. 3 Clinical manifestations may include acute self-limiting pharyngitis, bronchiolitis, viral pneumonia and respiratory failure. Secondary bacterial infection is well recognized along with a predisposition to acute allograft rejection and bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS) through local immune upregulation. Early diagnosis is essential to direct therapy of acute graft dysfunction, identify epidemic trends in the transplant community and prevent nosocomial acquisition of infection. Historically, 3 laboratory techniques have been utilized in the diagnosis of RVI: serology; viral culture; and direct antigen detection. Serologic confirmation of infection using acute and convalescent serum has significant drawbacks in transplant recipients including delay in diagnosis, lack of antibody response and possibility of crossreaction. Traditional viral culture remains the \"gold standard\" of diagnosis, although this requires 7 to 10 days of incubation to achieve maximal sensitivity. Isolation in embryonated hen eggs, A549 lung carcinoma, primary monkey kidney or Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cell lines constitutes the classic method of diagnosis of respiratory viruses. 4 Detection of viral antigen within clinical samples using direct or indirect fluorescent antibody (DFA/ IFA) techniques is a proposed alternative to achieve rapid diagnosis in immunocompromised patients. Palmer and colleagues in 1998 described 2 cases of RVI in lung transplant recipients diagnosed by DFA performed on bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid. 5 However, exfoliated epithelial cells derived from the upper respiratory tract may be a more practical, less invasive source of diagnostic material in such patients. Successful examination for influenza virus in nasal smears with fluorescein-labeled antibody was first described over 45 years ago. 6 Although nasopharyngeal aspirates are widely recognized as providing sufficient cells for fluorescent antibody screening, 7,8 they have a number of inherent problems, including inconvenience of collection and a propensity to induce trauma in patients with fragile mucosa or scant nasal secretions. A nasopharyngeal and throat (NT) swab may be the ideal specimen to provide cellular material; however, its application to viral diagnosis in transplant recipients remains poorly described.",

Following NT swabs, blood samples were sent for acute viral serology (influenza A or B and adenovirus) using the complement fixation assay, cytomegalovirus polymerase chain reaction (CMV PCR) analysis, full blood count, biochemistry and immunosuppressant levels. Detailed pulmonary function tests, a chest radiograph and measurement of oxygen saturation were also performed. Selected patients with significant LRT symptoms and/or radiographic infiltrates proceeded to early fiber-optic bronchoscopy with transbronchial lung biopsy (TBB). BAL samples were not processed for viral studies and IFA test results were available within 24 hours of collection. Convalescent serology for respiratory viruses was collected 6 weeks after clinical presentation and lung function charted for 6 months post-infection. Baseline forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV 1 ) was defined as the average of 2 measurements recorded in the 4 months preceding clinical presentation separated by at least 4 weeks. Diagnosis of RVI required a positive viral culture, IFA test or demonstration of a 4-fold rise in serum antibody titer. Study participants received similar immunosuppressive therapy early post-transplantation consisting of oral cyclosporine, azathioprine and prednisolone (maintenance dose on .20 mg/kg). Acute rejection was treated with intravenous methylprednisolone 15 mg/kg per day for 3 days and generally followed by an oral taper commencing at 1 mg/kg. Patients were switched from cyclosporine to tacrolimus 0.15 mg/kg for recurrent or persistent rejection.",

Half of the cells were removed with a Pasteur pipette and placed onto 8-well slides. The IFA test consisted of two immunologic reagents.

Patients ranged in age from 15 to 56 years and were diagnosed 134 to 1,795 days post-transplant (mean 988 days). Prior to influenza infection, the majority of patients had baseline lung function consistent with BOS Grade 0 (n \u03ed 5). No patient had received augmented immunosuppression or anti-rejection treatment before the diagnosis. All subjects, except 1, experienced significant morbidity from infection with LRT symptoms, acute decline in lung function and/or a requirement for hospital admission. Bacterial co-infection was documented on sputum or bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples in 5 of 9 patients, with 7 receiving intravenous antibiotics. Most patients also received anti-inflammatory doses of oral prednisolone commencing at 1 mg/kg tapering by 5 mg/day to their usual maintenance dose. However, a steroid pulse was not given to the patient with symptoms limited to the upper respiratory tract with normal graft function or the patient with significant methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infection. Anti-viral therapy with amantadine or selective neuraminidase inhibitors was not administered to study participants. TBB was performed in 3 patients with radiologic infiltrates and revealed intense airway-centered inflammation with neutrophils in 2 cases. One procedure confirmed moderate acute allograft rejection with associated lymphocytic bronchiolitis Grade B2. 10 As shown in Table III , influenza subjects were of similar age, gender, transplant type and post-operative days to those patients in whom no respiratory virus was isolated (n \u03ed 9). All participants from both groups were on 3 maintenance immunosuppressive agents at the time of clinical infection. However, the decline in FEV 1 for influenza subjects was significantly greater compared with the non-influenza group (p \u03ed 0.0469, Mann-Whitney U-test). Five of 9 influenza patients developed new chest radiograph infiltrates compared with none in the non-influenza group. Although the presence of hypoxemia and leukocytosis showed similar distribution among the groups, fever was particularly characteristic of influenza infection. Non-influenza patients experienced a less severe clinical presentation requiring hospitalization in only 3 cases and augmented oral steroids infrequently.

Figure 2 demonstrates lung function of study participants with BOS Grade 3 at baseline for 6 months before and after clinical presentation. BOS Grade 0 -2 influenza and non-influenza subjects experienced acute reversible declines in FEV 1 with return to baseline at a mean of 3 weeks after clinical presentation. However, influenza patients with BOS Grade 3 failed to return to baseline and suffered a progressive loss in lung function, thereafter, in contrast to those BOS Grade 3 subjects in the noninfluenza group. This occurred despite all BOS Grade 3 subjects having received intravenous cefepime and tobramycin for concurrent Pseudomonas chest infection and an oral pulse of steroids over a 10 to 14-day inpatient stay. Although both non-influenza subjects were hypoxemic at presentation, decline in lung function was less severe and neither had new radiographic infiltrates. One non-influenza BOS Grade 3 patient had concurrent Aspergillus infection that necessitated subjects with influenza over 5 years on lavage samples taken from 176 lung transplant patients. These retrospective reviews incorporated both surveillance and diagnostic biopsy protocols, with BAL fluid the diagnostic specimen. They contrast significantly with prospective evaluations performed in immunocompromised patients with hematologic malignancies before and after bone marrow transplantation (BMT) using upper respiratory tract sampling techniques. Ljungman et al 12 reported that 19% of such patients (15 of 78) had a respiratory virus detectable on nasal wash during a 3-month study period with the vast majority of patients symptomatic. A large prospective study post-BMT, comparing isolation sites for confirmed influenza A infection, showed that only 6% of lavage samples vs 94% of nasal wash/throat swab specimens were DFA-or culturepositive for virus. 13 We report 9 cases of influenza infection over a 3-month period in 18 lung transplant recipients with \"flu-like\" symptoms, from a transplant community of some 115. Several additional factors may explain our higher prevalence of infection such as seasonal and geographic variation along with heightened efforts to diagnose infection. Nonetheless, the incidence of influenza infection in adult lung transplant recipients is likely to be considerably greater than that reported to date, with the more specific application of diagnostic tests obtained from the upper respiratory tract.",

Garantziotis et al 14 reported similar findings with lavage fluid in their small series of 3 cases of influenza pneumonia in lung transplant recipients. Our lower rate of positive viral culture may reflect in vitro viral instability or sub-optimal specimen handling. Although all samples were sent to an outside reference laboratory, inoculation into cell culture and IFA staining was achieved within a few hours. No sample was frozen in transport, which may otherwise promote cellular degradation and reduce viral stability. If we exclude patients with clinical presentation beyond 1 week, the sensitivity of IFA improves significantly to 86%. The possibility of viral isolation is enhanced when specimens are collected within 7 days of clinical onset. 15 The high sensitivity of IFA testing in our series supports the use of the nasopharyngeal and throat swab as a diagnostic specimen. This collection method was well tolerated by all patients and no specimen was discarded or re-collected because of inadequate cell numbers. Nasopharyngeal aspirates and/or washes have been proposed as alternative methods to collect larger numbers of exfoliated epithelial cells. However, these techniques are potentially more invasive and inconvenient to collect compared with NT swabs. In addition, if nasal secretions are minimal or mucosa particularly fragile, as is common with influenza, 15 NT swabs may inflict less local trauma. The stipulation on cellularity applied in our study would likely reduce any disparity in yield between the various upper airway sampling techniques.",

            "text": "Influenza produced significant clinical infection in our lung transplant patients, necessitating hospitalization, single bed isolation and supportive care in the majority of affected individuals. Radiographic anomalies were not predictive of more severe graft dysfunction or development of respiratory failure. No patient required ventilatory support or died as a result of their acute infection. To our knowledge, no anti-viral agents have proven efficacy against influenza infection in transplant recipients. Inhaled zanamivir and oral oseltamivir are selective inhibitors of the neuraminidase glycoprotein essential for replication of influenza A and B viruses. Studies in immunocompetent volunteers have shown that these agents reduce the duration of disease (by up to 1.5 days), severity of illness and secondary complications compared with placebo when initiated within 36 hours of symptom onset. 16, 17 IFA testing may facilitate the broader application of these novel agents in transplant recipients by rapid confirmation of infection. Although we have described influenza as generally self-limiting in the acute setting, strategies to reduce morbidity may prove cost-effective. Further research is needed to define potential subgroups of transplant recipients who may benefit from early introduction of neuraminidase inhibitors. Serology has a low sensitivity in diagnosing recent influenza infection, confirming only 33% percent of cases in our series. This poor response is similar to that achieved after influenza vaccination in patients after thoracic organ transplantation, where protective antibody levels have been seen in 36% to 41% of recipients. 18, 19 The major public health measure for the prevention of influenza infection remains the use of inactivated vaccine administered in autumn each year. Nonetheless, vaccination of lung transplant recipients with a yearly single-dose influenza vaccine may afford minimal protection against viral replication and infection. All except 1 patient was vaccinated for influenza some 4 months prior to the evaluation period. This adds further controversy to the debate regarding the need for booster vaccination and serologic confirmation of antibody response. However, it is feasible that vaccination of our patient group protected individuals from more severe clinical manifestations by inducing low serum levels of protective antibody. Until specific assays to measure antibodies to vaccine constituents become more widely available, we continue to recommend at least the single-dose influenza vaccine.",

            "text": "Retrospective clinical reviews support an association between RVI and the development of BOS. 5 Seasonal clustering of onset of BOS suggests that infectious triggers such as respiratory viruses may play an etiologic role. 20 Obliterative bronchiolitis has recently been described shortly after influenza pneumonia in both pediatric and adult lung transplant recipients. 14,21 Experimentally, the intratracheal instillation of parainfluenza 1 in rat lung allografts induces the typical lesion of obliterative bronchiolitis within 56 days on histologic section. 22 Palmer 5 described 4 of 8 patients developing BOS immediately following RVI or several months after infection. In our study, patients experienced a similar reversible decline in lung function with no progression to BOS or worsening BOS grade on follow-up. However, BOS Grade 3 patients with influenza failed to return to baseline and experienced ongoing loss thereafter. This suggests that patients with severe pre-existing bronchiolar epithelial damage have a limited repertoire of defense mechanisms to respiratory viruses. 22 A component of the pathology in influenza is caused by recruitment of T cells to the site of infection. 23 Perhaps the use of oral prednisolone in treatment regimens for lower BOS grades protected the patients from initiation or amplification of the chronic rejection process. Mechanisms of action of this steroid blockade may include downregulation of lymphocyte alloreactivity or minimization of the sub-epithelial inflammatory reaction. In addition, acute rejection was an infrequent association with influenza infection, with only 1 biopsy-proven Grade A3 rejection on Day 5 of hospitalization.",

Although our study population was relatively small, we believe IFA testing of NT swabs is a low-cost less invasive test of high sensitivity in the diagnosis of infection. Routine viral culture of NT swabs may not be necessary after an initial positive IFA, given its lower sensitivity in our experience. With early diagnosis and institution of intensive supportive treatment, infection is generally selflimiting, showing an infrequent association with acute rejection. With the exception of BOS Grade 3 patients, we found no association with the subsequent development of BOS in 6 months of followup. Although we recommend an annual influenza vaccination, single-dose protocols may provide only minimal protection against disease.",
