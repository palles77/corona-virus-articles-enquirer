            "text": "C57BL/6 mice infected with mouse hepatitis virus, strain JHM (JHMV) develop a rapidly fatal acute encephalitis. Previously, we showed that this disease is partially CD4 T cell-mediated since infection with a recombinant JHMV (rJ) mutated in only a single immunodominant CD4 T cell epitope (epitope M133, rJ. M Y135Q ) results in a nonlethal disease. Increased mortality correlated with a greater number of JHMV-specific CD4 T cells in the brains of rJ compared to rJ.M Y135Q -infected mice. Here, we extend these results to show that the diminished number of virus-specific T cells correlates with a reduced cytokine/chemokine response in the infected brain. We also show that regulatory CD4 T cells (Tregs) are critical for mild disease in rJ.M Y135Qinfected mice because their depletion results in increased mortality. Further, a relative paucity of Tregs characterizes lethal infection because adoptive transfer of Tregs into rJ-infected mice increases survival from 0% to 50%. These results support the notion that clinical disease in coronavirus-induced acute encephalitis results from a balance between factors critical for virus clearance, such as virus-specific effector T cells and anti-inflammatory elements, such as Tregs. These findings also show that unlike chronic infections, in which an excessive number of Tregs contributes to pathogen persistence, Tregs in the setting of acute encephalitis may help to limit immunopathological disease without delaying virus clearance.",

            "text": "The outcome of viral infections is dependent upon complex interactions between the pathogen and host pro-and antiinflammatory immune responses. A dysregulated and overexuberant innate immune response has been implicated in fatal H5N1 influenza (de Jong et al., 2006) and may also be involved in the pathogenesis of SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome), caused by a novel coronavirus (Perlman and Dandekar, 2005) . Excessive T cell responses have also been implicated in disease in mice infected with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), herpes simplex virus or respiratory syncytial virus, with tissue damage occurring during the process of virus clearance (Hussell et al., 2001; Oldstone, 2002; Suvas et al., 2004) . To minimize excessive pro-inflammatory responses, cells with anti-inflammatory activity, such as regulatory T cells and Tr1 cells, which express IL-10 (Roncarolo et al., 2006) , are also induced during a normal immune response. An appropriate anti-inflammatory response will prevent immunopathological disease without adversely affecting virus clearance. Regulatory T cells, which suppress the pro-inflammatory response, encompass several subsets including thymically derived CD4 + CD25 + cells that express the transcription factor Foxp3 (natural Tregs, abbreviated Tregs herein) (Belkaid, 2007; Roncarolo and Battaglia, 2007) . Many studies have assessed the role of Tregs in autoimmunity, where a relative deficiency of these cells occurs, and cancer, where they inhibit antitumor T cell responses (Nomura and Sakaguchi, 2005; Sakaguchi, 2005; Sakaguchi et al., 2006) . These cells have also been implicated in chronic viral diseases. This was first demonstrated in mice infected with Friend's virus or herpes simplex virus and subsequently in humans infected with viruses such as hepatitis C virus (HCV) and HIV (Belkaid, 2007; Belkaid and Rouse, 2005; Iwashiro et al., 2001; MacDonald et al., 2002; Robertson and Hasenkrug, 2006; Suvas et al., 2004) . In infectious settings, Tregs can dampen the immune response, thus minimizing tissue damage but at the cost of inhibiting virus clearance (reviewed in Belkaid, 2007; Belkaid and Rouse, 2005; Robertson and Hasenkrug, 2006) .",

            "text": "Levels of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines are greater in the rJ relative to the rJ.M Y135Q -infected CNS rJ-infected mice develop fatal acute encephalitis, whereas mice infected with rJ.M Y135Q develop a nonlethal mild encephalitis and these differences correlate with numbers of JHMV-specific CD4 T cells in the brain (Anghelina et al., 2006) . Since the host response to infection is determined by relative contributions of pro and anti-inflammatory factors, we reasoned that increased clinical disease in rJ-infected mice, when compared to those infected with rJ.M Y135Q , might result from not only an increased number of virus-specific CD4 Th1 cells, but also higher levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. To investigate this possibility, we measured protein levels of several molecules known to be upregulated in the brains of JHMV-infected mice (IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IFN-\u03b3, TNF\u03b1, CCL2, CCL5) (Bergmann et al., 2006) at days 5 and 7 p.i. (Table 1) . Significantly higher levels of IL-6, CCL2, CCL5 and IFN-\u03b3 , but not IL-1\u03b2 or TNF-\u03b1 were measured in rJ compared to rJ.M Y135Q -infected mice at day 5 p.i. In general, levels of cytokines were lower at day 7 when compared to day 5, in agreement with previous studies (Rempel et al., 2004) , but levels of IL-6, CCL2 and CCL5 remained increased in rJ compared to rJ.M Y135Qinfected brains. Elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, particularly IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1, have been associated with decreased Treg function (Korn et al., 2007) and autoimmunity is diminished in IL6 \u2212/\u2212 mice, in part because Tregs are fully suppressive in the absence of this cytokine (Pasare and Medzhitov, 2003) . IL-6 was significantly lower and disease was milder in rJ.M Y135Q compared to rJ-infected mice, prompting us to assess levels and function of Tregs in infected mice.",

Of note, we previously showed that, at each time point, similar numbers of total CD4 T lymphocytes were detected in rJ and rJ.M Y135Qinfected brains (Anghelina et al., 2006) . We used IFN-\u03b3 expression as a marker for effector Th1 CD4 T cells since virtually no Th2 CD4 T cells are present in infected brains as assayed by expression of IL-5 (Anghelina et al., 2006) . In addition to epitope M133, at least two additional CD4 T cell epitopes, encompassing residues 333-347 and 358-372, are recognized in JHMV-infected B6 mice (Xue and Perlman, 1997) . We were consistently able to detect CD4 + CD25 + Foxp3 + T cells in the brain as early as day 3 after infection with either virus (Fig. 1F , equivalent to approximately 50-100 Tregs/brain) but could not reliably identify JHMV-specific CD4 T cells using an intracellular IFN\u03b3 assay until day 6 p.i. In the rJ-infected brain, the numbers of Tregs decreased and virus-specific effector CD4 T cells greatly increased between 6 and 7 days p.i. These changes coincided with the time when mice become moribund. In contrast, numbers of Tregs predominated in the rJ.M Y135Q -infected brain at all time points up to 14 days p.i.; these mice developed minimal clinical disease with no mortality. Of note, it is striking that the numbers of Tregs in the rJinfected brain was much higher than in the brains of mice infected with rJ.M Y135Q at day 6 p.i. (Figs. 1D,E). However, these cells were unable to protect mice from lethal disease and their number decreased considerably over the next 24 h. While these results may reflect the greater number of virus-specific CD4 T cells present in the rJ-infected brain, it is also possible that the elevated levels of IL-6 present in the brains of rJ-infected mice resulted in a loss of functionality, as previously described in mice with EAE (acute autoimmune encephalomyelitis) (Korn et al., 2007) .",

Because intracellular staining for Foxp3 requires permeabilization, which diminishes tetramer binding, we infected Foxp3gfp knock-in mice (Fontenot et al., 2005) , in which Tregs are identified by GFP expression without a requirement for permeabilization. We found that 8.8 \u00b1 0.9% (n = 10) of Foxp3 \u2212 CD4 T cells in the brain were M133-specific (Fig. 3 ) by tetramer staining.

If Tregs have a significant role in protection, they should be critical for limiting disease in rJ.M Y135Q -infected mice. Consequently, their depletion should result in enhanced disease. Therefore, we depleted Tregs by treatment with anti-CD25 mAb (mAb PC61) three days prior to infection with rJ.M Y135Q ; this treatment resulted in an approximate 90% decrease in Tregs in the infected brain at 5 days p.i. (Fig. 4A) . Anti-CD25-treated mice developed significant weight loss and a mortality of 50% whereas control mice, treated with rat IgG, developed only mild disease and uniformly survived the infection (Figs. 4B,D) . By decreasing the anti-inflammatory environment, Treg depletion might facilitate virus clearance. However, depletion of these cells did not change virus clearance in rJ.M Y135Qinfected mice, as similar levels of infectious virus were measured at day 5 p.i. in control and Treg-depleted mice (Fig. 4C ). Of note, we measured levels of a single representative cytokine, IL-6, at day 5 p.i. to determine whether mAb PC61 treatment resulted in increased cytokine/chemokine levels. Day 5 p.i. was chosen because levels diminish greatly by day 7 p.i. (Fig. 1) . However, we saw no statistically significant differences in IL-6 levels when IgG and anti-CD25-treated mice were compared. This lack of difference may have occurred because only 50% of mice died after PC61 treatment and it was not possible to identify these mice at day 5 p.i.",

To assess this possibility, we adoptively transferred CD4 + CD25 + Tregs from naive B6 spleens into infected animals. The purity of the transferred cells was consistently 95-98% (Fig. 5A) . These cells were functional in in vitro proliferation assays, performed as described in Fig. 2A (data not shown).

Mice were sacrificed at day 5 or 7 p.i. and Tregs from brains, spleens, CLN and peripheral (PLN) lymph nodes were analyzed for Thy1.1/1.2 expression.

To distinguish transferred Tregs from endogenous cells, we transferred Thy1.1 Tregs into B6 (Thy1.2) mice. Unexpectedly, given the clinical effect of the transferred Tregs, only a low percentage of Tregs at any site examined (brain, CLN, peripheral lymph nodes, spleen) were donor in origin (Fig.  5E ). This percentage was not increased in the brain or CLN compared to the spleen or more distant lymph nodes.

            "text": "This study supports the notion that the outcome in coronavirusinduced encephalitis results from a balance between pro-inflammatory modalities required for virus clearance and anti-inflammatory factors, such as Tregs, necessary to prevent an excessive, deleterious host immune response. This response does not necessitate a numerical superiority of Tregs to virus-specific effector T cells, but rather the presence of sufficient numbers of both cell types and of a balanced cytokine environment, which cooperate to clear virus and minimize tissue destruction. The importance of this balance was illustrated when rJ and rJ.M Y135Q -infected mice were compared. Both rJ and rJ.M Y135Q grew equally well in tissue culture cells and to similar titers in B6 mice, with equivalent kinetics of clearance (Anghelina et al., 2006) . However, differences in the balance between virus-specific effector CD4 T cells and Tregs correlated with dramatic differences in survival and depletion or transfer of Tregs also influenced the outcome. Greater numbers of virusspecific effector CD4 T cells (Fig. 2) , associated with increased levels of several pro-inflammatory mediators (Fig. 1) , were detected in the brains of rJ compared to rJ.M Y135Q -infected mice (Anghelina et al., 2006) and likely contributed to more severe disease and a uniformly fatal outcome. IL-6 may be especially important in contributing to a fatal outcome because this cytokine, in conjunction with TNF, is able to inhibit Treg function even when Tregs are present in substantial numbers in the inflamed brain (Korn et al., 2007) . In the presence of fewer virus-specific CD4 Tcells, as occurred in rJ.M Y135Q -mice, the effect of anti-inflammatory factors such as Tregs was dominant. Thus, a nearly ideal balance is present in rJ.M Y135Q -infected mice, in which clearance of a virulent virus occurs with minimal clinical disease.",

Differences in numbers of Tregs in the brains but not the CLN of rJ and rJ.M Y135Q -infected mice suggest that these cells function during the effector stage in ameliorating disease. At the peak of the infection, there were approximately 10,000 and 20,000 Tregs in the rJ.M Y135Q and rJ-infected brain, respectively. While this represents only about 5-15% of all CD4 T cells, these percentages are consistent with those observed in other inflammatory settings in the brain (Korn et al., 2007; O'Connor et al., 2007) . The mechanism of Treg-mediated immunosuppression in the rJ.M Y135Q -infected brain is not known, but may involve production of molecules such as TGF-\u03b2 or IL-35 as occurs in other experimental settings (Vignali et al., 2008) ; our data suggest that Tregs do not function via IL-10 expression (Fig. 5G) .",

First, since mice that do not receive transferred Tregs uniformly die by days 7-8 p.i., all assays must be performed at this time. However, at this time p.i., mice that will survive after Treg transfer cannot be distinguished from those that will not, thus potentially obscuring any effects of the transferred Tregs. Second, as shown in Fig. 4 , only 50% of Treg recipients survive and there are no significant differences in weight loss between recipients of Tregs as opposed to those mice that receive CD4 + CD25 \u2212 cells. Thus the Tregs play an important role in enhancing survival, but all mice, whether they survive or not, have severe disease. Other factors with anti-inflammatory activity, such as IL-10, may also function sub-optimally in rJ-infected mice and enhancing their function, in conjunction with the transfer of Tregs, may contribute to an improved clinical course and more obvious changes in the CD4 + CD25 + 7 12.7 \u00b1 2.7 7.7 \u00b1 1.4(2.4 \u00b1 0.3) 1.4 \u00d7 10 4 \u00b1 0.5 \u00d7 10 4 1.7 \u00b1 0.2 19.1 \u00b1 2.4(4.4 \u00b1 0.7) 4.2 \u00d7 10 3 \u00b1 0.8 \u00d7 10 3 CD4 + CD25 \u2212 9 11.1 \u00b1 1.5 12.2 \u00b1 1.6(3.6 \u00b1 0.5) 1.8 \u00d7 10 4 \u00b1 0.4 \u00d7 10 4 1.9 \u00b1 0.2 18.7 \u00b1 1.3(1.9 \u00b1 0.2) 5.5 \u00d7 10 3 \u00b1 1.1 \u00d7 10 3 immune response. Consistent with this possibility, infection of IL-10 \u2212/\u2212 mice with an attenuated variant of JHMV (Lin et al., 1998) or rJ.M Y135Q (data not shown) resulted in increased mortality and weight loss, showing that IL-10 is required for optimal disease outcome. Our results show, however, that Treg expression of IL-10 is not required for the protective effects of transferred cells in rJ-infected mice (Fig. 5G) , suggesting that IL-10 must be produced by another type of cell in infected mice. In other infections, macrophages, dendritic cells and CD4 + Foxp3 \u2212 T cells have all been shown to express IL-10 (reviewed in Couper et al., 2008) . Third, Tregs function by cell-to-cell contact with either dendritic cells at sites of priming or with effector T cells or other cells in sites of inflammation (Tadokoro et al., 2006; Vignali et al., 2008) . It is possible that the transferred Tregs function to subtly change the immune response in a localized manner without globally affecting total numbers of virus-specific T cells. The importance of virus-specificity of Tregs in JHMV-infected mice is not yet known. Antigen-specific Tregs more effectively suppress the response of T effector cells to cognate antigen than non-antigenspecific Tregs Tarbell et al., 2007) , but our results show that very few virus-specific Tregs are present in the infected brain (Fig. 3) . It is also likely that the effects mediated by transferred natural Tregs in rJ-infected mice do not require virusspecificity, since transfer of a relatively low number (3.7 \u00d7 10 5 cells, Fig.  5 ) reduced mortality. Only a few JHMV-specific naive Tregs should be present in this number of cells, suggesting that if antigen specificity is required for Treg function, virus-specific Tregs would need to expand rapidly in order to dampen the pro-inflammatory immune response. Treg numbers could also be increased by peripheral conversion of CD25 \u2212 CD4 + T cells to Tregs but the extent to which peripheral conversion occurs within the brain is controversial. While Liu et al. reported that neurons are able to induce conversion of effector CD4 T cells to CD25 + TGF\u03b21 + CTL4 + Foxp3 + cells in the context of EAE (Liu et al., 2006) , others have found no evidence for such conversion in the same setting (Korn et al., 2007; O'Connor et al., 2007) . It will be critical in future studies to determine whether JHMV-specific Tregs are derived from virus-specific effector CD4 T cells.",

Similar to our results, a relative deficiency of these cells is present in patients with severe acute dengue infection, when compared to those with mild disease (Luhn et al., 2007) . Our data are concordant with studies of SIV-infected African green monkeys (AGM) and macaques. In infected AGMs, Tregs are detected early after infection and dampen the initial pro-inflammatory immune response. Furthermore, AGMs do not develop the chronic T cell activation that is characteristic of the progression to AIDS (Kornfeld et al., 2005) . In macaques, which develop AIDS, Tregs appear later and may actually inhibit an effective anti-viral CD8 T cell response (Estes et al., 2006) . Collectively, these results suggest that optimization of Treg numbers and function at very early times during the infectious process will diminish the likelihood of an excessive immune response; our results show that this effect may be sufficiently profound to prevent death in an otherwise lethal disease.",
