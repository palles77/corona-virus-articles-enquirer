In this study, we comprehensively analyzed 500 respiratory samples from children with upper or lower respiratory tract infections for viral pathogens using a range of diagnostic techniques, including immunological, and PCR-based assays as well as Roche Genome Sequencer (GS) FLX Titanium pyrosequencing (Roche, Basel Switzerland) of 92 specimens. The identification of a novel variant (from a known viral pathogen) led us to further investigate its prevalence in these samples, and to characterize its genome by Single Molecule Real-Time (SMRTH) sequencing of the original clinical specimen on the PacBioH RS (PacBio) (Pacific Biosciences, Menlo Park, CA). We additionally explore the feasibility of single molecule sequencing, as well as verify the quality of the sequence obtained through this method to the complete Sanger sequenced viral genome.",

Presently, four complete genomes have been sequenced across both HPIV4 subtypes (one HPIV4a and three HPIV4b) [20] [21] [22] .

Following the GS FLX screening and analysis, we sequenced sample 459 on the PacBio RS to recover HPIV4_DK(459) through a viral metagenomic framework. A total of 3,356,192 reads was generated from 5 SMRTcellsH of sequencing. Viral read filtration of HPIV4 was achieved by mapping all sequences using Pacific Biosciences BLASR software to five HPIV reference genomes (x1 HPIV1, x1 HPIV2, x1 HPIV3, x1 HPIV4a, x1 HPIV4b). This resulted in 116,109 reads (,3.5%) mapping to the virus. Contigs were generated from filtered reads by de novo assembly, resulting in an assembly of 29 contigs, which were subsequently taxonomically identified through BLASTn (NCBI's non-redundant database). Despite sequence-independent amplification in the viral metagenomic preparation resulting in predominately short fragments as input (100-500 bp), up to 98% of the genome was covered at 700X average coverage from the contigs alone. A comparison of the coverage obtained from viral metagenomic sequencing of HPIV4_DK(459), (GS FLX and PacBio data) can be seen in Figure 1 . We later confirmed the full genome sequence of HPIV4_DK(459) using conventional primer walking RT-PCR and 1 st generation Sanger sequencing from GS FLX data output (GenBank accession number KF483663). The extremities (39 and 59 ends) of the genome were acquired in similar fashion using a consensus alignment and degenerate PCR amplification and Sanger sequencing. A list of the primers used for primer walking is shown in Supplementary Table S7 . Using a simple majority-rule consensus approach, all positions with more than 100X PacBio coverage were identical to the Sanger sequenced genome, supporting the usefulness of this technique.",

This 57-nt sequence is identical with the corresponding SKPIV4 sequence in all but 3 nucleotides. An initial prediction of this section's RNA folding structure using mfold 26 demonstrates an impressive stem-loop configuration, which folds into the exact same secondary structure (Supplementary Figure  S10 ) as the SKPIV4 isolate, despite the minor differences at the nucleotide level. However, since single sequence secondary structure alone is generally not statistically significant for determining the presence of a structured RNA 27 , we undertook a more elaborate analysis incorporating multi-sequence comparison and structural RNA alignments. We extended the analysis to include 17 additional Figure S11) shows that taxa can be divided into two groups -those with , 100 nts 3' proximal sequences and those with , 150 nts 3' proximal sequences. The insert appears to be present in some Rubulaviruses whereas it is absent in the other genera. In order to estimate the reliability of the potential RNA structure we performed a comparative RNA structure analysis with a number of Rubulaviruses with 3' intergenic regions of similar lengths to the HPIV4_DK(459) sequence. Figure 4 shows the structural alignment produced using StrAl 28 and PETfold 29 via the WAR web server 30 Thirdly, both genomes share an identical stretch of 13 amino-acid residues within the HN gene (TQLLTYISYNGTI), only one of which is conserved in all published complete HPIV4 genomes. Importantly, visual examination of aligned HN ORF nucleotide sequences (from all currently available HPIV4 sequences in GenBank [n 5 29] ) identified this stretch of amino acids in all but nine strains across both HPIV4 subtypes, which suggests a high prevalence among the HPIV4 strains. The differences observed in this section are due to three insertions-deletions (indels) across the strains that result in a frame shift at the amino acid level in this section. Based on this observation, up to five distinct genotypes can be visually identified from this data, three of which differ at only a single amino acid. This information is visually represented in Figure 5 . An amino acid alignment of the HN gene from completely sequenced HPIV4 strains to two other paramyxoviruses (HPIV3, NDV) whose three-dimensional protein structure has been described using X-ray crystallography 32, 33 , places this stretch of 13 residues in the second Beta sheet, third strand (b 2 S 3 ) of the globular head of the molecule. Meaningful inference of this sort is supported by the fact that the position of the protein structures of NDV and HPIV3 are highly conserved even though they are phylogenetically more distant, than either is to HPIV4. This structure is shown for HPIV3 and NDV to be immediately preceded by the a1 helix, which is seemingly crucial for the enzymatic activity of the protein 32 . Lastly, both HPIV4_DK(459) and SKPIV4 have a longer ORF at the C-terminal end of the HN gene, which codes for an extra five amino acids, the two first of which are identical. However, as above, (from a comparison of available HN sequences) the presence of the longer HN ORF appears more prevalent than its absence across strains. Using the same paramyxovirus alignment above, the C-terminal end of the HN gene can be inferred to reside in the end of the 6th Beta sheet, third strand (b 6 S 3 ) of the globular head of the protein molecule. This beta sheet has been identified as having catalytic/active sites in both the first and second strand 32 . The amino acid residue differences within the HN gene of ",

In clinical virology, PCR based assays still remain the gold standard. However, their high specificity and the emergence of divergent strains may cause the assay to fail routine diagnosis, leading to elevated levels of false negatives. High-throughput metagenomic sequencing provides an alternative measure, by supplying added sequence information and revealing details on the divergence to characterized strains. Here we show that not only 2 nd generation sequencing platforms, but also 3 rd generation single molecule sequencing may be used effectively in viral discovery. Although one of the primary strengths of the PacBio lies in the generation of long sequences, the platform can clearly be used for short read sequencing. The pre-sequencing amplification methods used in this study primarily generated short input fragments. However, using few SMRT cells we obtained excellent coverage of the genome. Given its fast turnaround time, the PacBio is well suited for rapid and relatively cheap characterization of novel viruses. In particular, when other more sensitive screening (sequencing) platforms have identified candidate viral reads within the clinical samples tested.",

HPIV4 has been traditionally described as fastidious in nature, and less clinically important than other HPIV serotypes 4 . Overall this has resulted in few epidemiological and case report studies being published 34 , and its infrequent screening in clinical microbiology laboratories 11 . In temperate climates, peak incidence of HPIV4 is often reported during the late fall and late winter months 4, 14, 16, 34 . However, other studies have detected peaks outside the usual seasons 13, 34 , emphasizing a poorly understood epidemiology and seasonality 35 . Aside from this consideration, several other factors may influence its detection including geographical location, sample population, and the year of collection 8, 11 . Although the identified proportion of HPIV4 positive samples in our study was within previously described ranges, the aforementioned factors will likely result in significant differences across spatial and temporal distributions. More importantly, the lack of complete genomes confirms how little is known of circulating HPIV4 viral strains, emphasizing the need for focused full genome studies. In accordance with the above, we recovered the full genome of a divergent HPIV4 in a proof of principle study using 3 rd generation metagenomic sequencing. Despite the short lengths of the amplicons, confirmatory Sanger sequencing later attested to the validity of this approach in virus discovery.",

This included the presence of a 57-nt sequence section at the 39 leader intergenic region prior to the NP gene. Given that conserved promoter sequences in this region of PIV's is believed to drive transcription and replication of nascent RNA into postive-sense RNA replicas 24 , it makes it alluring to speculate on the functional role of this section. Interestingly, a number of the Paramyxoviridae have 3' intergenic regions (up to the start codon of the NP gene) of around 150 nts, approximately the same length as the HPIV4_DK(459) strain and SKPIV4 sequences. In silico generated RNA structure analysis revealed that the only consistent consensus secondary structure overlaps the 57-nt 'insert' region (see Figure 4 ). These results indicate that the insert is potentially necessary for RNA secondary structure formation that seems to be conserved across different members of the Paramyxoviridae. The 3' leader sequence is known to be involved in RNA replication, transcriptional and encapsidation regulation 36 . The potential regulatory consequences of the putative RNA structure in the leader sequence remain to be examined.",

Two additional features shared with the SKPIV4 strain are both located within the HN gene, which encodes one of two proteins expressed on the viral surface. The HN envelope glycoprotein has three important functions. First, it mediates cellular infection through binding of the virus to cell-surface receptors containing sialic acid. Second, it severs the binding of the cells receptor from the glyco-protein conjugates during viral budding. Finally, through interaction with a second surface glycoprotein, it regulates fusion between the virus envelope with the cells plasma membrane 24 . Here, we have provisionally inferred the location of these conserved residues by aligning the HN gene to two members of the Paramyxoviridae (NDV, HPIV3), whose crystallographic three dimensional protein structures have been described 32, 33 . However, the biological and functional relevance, such as the mediation of cellular receptor binding or Fusion protein activation remains unclear.

Amplified material was sent to Macrogen (The Netherlands) for purification and Sanger sequencing in both directions by following the companies recommendations and use of the same PCR amplification primers for sequencing. Following full genome recovery, sequenced fragments were aligned to the four reference genomes and then assembled using Geneious v5.4.2 46 .",
