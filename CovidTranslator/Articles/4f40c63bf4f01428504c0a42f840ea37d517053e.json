Cryptosporidium infection was detected in 43.8%, 71.9%, 63.2% and 6.9% of the calves in the respective age groups. Significant differences in the detection rate of Cryptosporidium were found between the age group 22\u00b130 days and all other age groups, and between the age group 1\u00b17 days and the age groups 8\u00b114 days and 15\u00b121 days. Cryptosporidium was the only enteropathogen detected in 60 of the 114 (52.6%) diarrheic calves. Concurrent infections with other enteropathogen(s) were detected in 64.3%, 46.3%, 39.5% and 0% of the Cryptosporidium-infected calves in the age groups 1\u00b17, 8\u00b114, 15\u00b121 and 22\u00b130 days, respectively. A significant age-associated decrease in the detection rate of mixed infections (p < 0.05) was found. The detection rates of the other enteropathogens considered in calves with Cryptosporidium infection were 87% for rotavirus, 11.1% for coronavirus, 27.8% for F5 E. coli and 1.8% for Salmonella. #",

The diagnosis of diarrhea was made by veterinarians. Faecal samples were collected directly from the rectum in sterile plastic bottles and submitted on the day of sampling to the laboratory by express mail. Submitted samples were accompanied by a record sheet containing information on the size of herd, number of scouring calves and number of calves ( < 30 days) in the herd at sampling time, and age of each sampled calf. Only fecal samples obtained within 48 h of onset of clinical signs from non-treated calves up to 30 days of age were included in this study. Samples were processed within 24 h of reception.",

Moreover, faecal samples were also tested for the presence of rotavirus by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) as described by Herring et al. (1982) , and for the presence of F5 E. coli by bacterial culture as follows. The faeces samples were plated on MacConkey agar. After overnight incubation, four colonies with the typical appearance of E. coli from each sample were randomly chosen. E. coli strains were identified by biochemical tests. The strains were tested for F5 fimbriae by the slide agglutination method with live bacteria grown on Minca-Isovitalex solid media. The production of absorbed antiserum used to detect this fimbrial antigen has been described (Morris et al., 1983; Contrepois et al., 1985) . Salmonella species were isolated by enrichment of faeces in selective broths. Approximately 1 g of faeces was added both to 9 ml of tetrathionate broth and to 7.5 ml of selenite broth. After 24 h of incubation at 378C, samples were plated out on brilliant green agar, and incubated for 24 h at 378C. Lactose-negative colonies were tested on triple sugar iron, urea, and o-nitrophenyl--D-galactopyranoside media. Those that had Salmonella-type reactions were tested for agglutination, using commercial polyvalent O-antisera (Salmonella antiserum, Difco).",

On the other hand, very different results have been reported in prevalence surveys. Thus, in a survey carried out in Arago \u00c2n (Spain), Qu\u00f5 \u00c2lez et al. (1996) found as much as 44.4% of calves aged 3\u00b14 days infected with Cryptosporidium, while in a nation-wide survey performed in USA only 2.5% of < 4 days old calves were positive to Cryptosporidium (Garber et al., 1994) . Two to 4 days are typically required for the first shedding of oocysts in feces. Therefore, the high detection rate found by us in age group 1\u00b17 days indicates that most of these calves were infected immediately after birth, and that the environment was heavily contaminated with oocysts.",

A significant age-associated decrease in the detection rate of mixed infections (p < 0.05) was found. That is in accordance with the age-dependent susceptibility of calves to the other enteropathogens considered except Salmonella. The pathogenic significance of concurrent infections in diarrheic calves, however, is not yet clear. Whether additive or synergistic interactions, that give rise to clinical effect or increase the severity of disease, occur in calves infected with Cryptosporidium and any other agent, or whether other agents extend the risk period for clinical cryptosporidiosis remain to be proved experimentally. Nevertheless, in microbiological surveys of diarrheic and healthy neonatal calves, mixed infections were much more commonly detected in diarrheic than in healthy calves (Morin et al., 1980; Reynolds et al., 1986) . Reynolds et al. (1986) suggested that the presence of more than one enteropathogen may be one of the factors determining whether an infection results in a clinical or subclinical effect. Moreover, mixed infections have been associated with more severe disease (Morin et al., 1980) .",
