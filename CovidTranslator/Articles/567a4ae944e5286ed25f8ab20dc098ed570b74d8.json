            "text": "Feline urethral strictures are uncommon, usually occurring secondary to catheter-induced or pelvic trauma and most commonly within the mid-distal or distal urethra. Although rare, urethral strictures of presumed congenital origin have also been described in young cats. 1 Diagnosis, management and confirmation of the aetiology of non-trauma-induced urethral strictures can be challenging owing to the sparseness of the current literature describing affected cases and a lack of histopathology due to tissue size and difficulty in sampling. [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] Several surgical options have been described for the treatment of urethral strictures. These are invasive procedures with significant complications and variable outcomes. 3, [8] [9] [10] [11] This report describes the successful management of a suspected congenital proximal urethral stricture in a female cat using minimally invasive fluoroscopy-guided balloon dilation. To our knowledge, this treatment modality has not been previously reported in cats. A 2- year-old female neutered domestic shorthair cat was presented with a 5-week history of stranguria, pollakiuria and urinary incontinence. On initial presentation to the primary veterinarian the cat was reported to be excessively licking her vulva. This progressed to urinary incontinence when laying down and stranguria when urinating. Symptomatic treatment with cefovecin ( Vetoquinol]) was subsequently trialled. Owing to ongoing clinical signs, an exploratory coeliotomy was performed 3 weeks later. The primary veterinarian identified a thickened but grossly normal bladder. Ovariohysterectomy and bladder wall biopsy were performed. Histopathology revealed no abnormalities.",

Abdominal ultrasonography showed a focal thickening of the mid dorsal bladder wall. Mild right renal pelvic dilation and diverticuli were noted without ureteral dilation. Based on the clinical history, these findings were suspected to be due to a partial urethral obstruction causing chronic bladder distension. Urethral catheterisation using a 3.5 Fr urinary catheter (KatKath; Vigon Vet) was attempted but not possible. Therefore, cystoscopy was performed under general anaesthesia. This revealed a markedly dilated urethra with an abrupt narrowing near the bladder neck. The cystoscope was unable to traverse this narrowing, precluding visual assessment of the bladder lumen. A retrograde urethrogram was performed, which confirmed the presence of caudal urethral dilation with a sharp reduction in the proximal urethral diameter near the bladder neck ( Figure 1 ). The urethral wall appeared smooth and regular. Based on the urethroscopic and urethrography findings, a diagnosis of urethral stricture was made.",

The stricture was identified as a membranous structure arising from the urethral mucosa, with a very narrow lumen leading to the bladder neck ( Figure 2) . A 0.014-inch guidewire was introduced into the bladder across the urethral Endoscopic image from the urethra at the level of the bladder neck. Membranous structure causing urethral stricture, with a small opening to the urinary bladder (black arrow), can be appreciated, preventing the cystoscope from reaching the bladder stricture, followed by placement of a 4 Fr micro-introducer to minimally dilate the stricture. This allowed passage of a 5 mm percutaneous transluminal angioplasty balloon dilation catheter (Sterling PTA Balloon; Boston Scientific). The positioning of the balloon was confirmed and monitored by fluoroscopy. The stricture was dilated with 5 ml of sterile saline introduced for 15 s into the balloon dilation catheter. Cystoscopic evaluation post-dilation revealed successful dilation of the stricture (Figure 3 ). The bladder lumen was evaluated with no abnormalities identified.",

            "text": "Urethral obstruction is a common condition in cats. 12 It can occur as a result of the presence of urethral plugs, urolithiasis, neoplasia, granuloma formation, bladder displacement or herniation, urethral stricture or idiopathic causes. 1, 13, 14 Strictures are defined as a reduction in the diameter of the lumen of a hollow structure. This occurs owing to the presence of cicatricial tissue as a result of inflammation and has been reported in hollow organs, such as the oesophagus, the rectum, the trachea, ureters and the urethra. 15, 16 In the present case, the lesion was considered a stricture, as its location did not correlate with a natural narrowing point of the urethra. Furthermore, it was located proximally at it widest point. To our knowledge, the proximal nature of the stricture is thought to be a novel clinical finding, as previous literature only describes the presence of distal or mid urethral strictures in cats. 1 Urethral strictures are usually sequelae of malignancy, pelvic trauma, severe inflammation or surgical intervention. 9, 11, 14 From the case history, stricture formation was considered congenital in origin based on signalment and the lack of trauma, urethral catheterisation or surgical intervention prior to presentation. In addition, the presence of the membranous structure separating both cavities suggests a congenital origin. Despite the lack of histopathology, it was considered to be a membrane based on the correlation of its clinical appearance and the definition of a membrane as a 'thin layer of Six-week post-balloon dilation retrograde urethrogram. Marked improvement of the previously reported urethral stricture. Although some degree of reduction of the urethral diameter can be appreciated, good contrast flow into the bladder is noted tissue separating two cavities'. 15 It was hypothesised that the membrane originated from the urethral mucosa. A similar finding has been reported in a dog with partial urethral obstruction, which was also suspected to be congenital in origin. 7 Urethral strictures typically present with clinical signs of dysuria and pollakiuria owing to partial or complete lower urinary tract obstruction. [17] [18] [19] In this case, the cat presented with similar dysuria, stranguria and incontinence. The mild uraemia noted on biochemistry analysis was considered either postprandial in nature or subclinical dehydration. The cat's hydration status appeared clinically correct; however, subclinical dehydration can present with a marginal elevation of urea. 20 Abdominal ultrasound and contrast radiography are common diagnostic tools when investigating urinary tract disorders. 21, 22 In the present case, the abdominal ultrasound showed focal thickening of the dorsal bladder wall. This was suspected to represent the area previously biopsied by the referring veterinarian. The presence and location of the stricture was confirmed via retrograde positive contrast radiography, an imaging modality commonly used to diagnose urethral strictures. 2, 9, 12, 18, 19 Cystourethroscopy can also be used when investigating persistent lower urinary tract signs, providing a magnified internal image of the urinary tract. In this case, it identified the nature of the urethral obstruction, precluding placement of a urinary catheter. Cystourethroscopy also aids in performing interventional treatments. 23, 24 Although considered a minimally invasive procedure, complications associated with cystoscopy include trauma to the urethral wall, urethritis, urethral and/or bladder rupture. 23 Various surgical procedures (perineal, prepubic and subpubic urethrostomy) have been described for the treatment of proximal and distal urethral obstructions, mostly in male cats. Such procedures are rarely performed as they are associated with a high complication rate, including stricture formation, urinary leakage, recurrent urinary tract infections, dehiscence, skin necrosis and urinary incontinence. 8, 25, 26 In the present case, surgical treatment was not considered a valid option due to the proximal location of the stricture near to the bladder neck.",

The main complication is recurrence of the stricture in up to 25% of patients within the first 3 years. 29 Urethroplasty offers the greatest chance for cure in humans and remains the gold standard in management of urethral strictures. 6, 30 In veterinary medicine, limited cases of non-malignant urethral strictures have been reported in dogs 2,7,31,32 and cats. 5, [17] [18] [19] To our knowledge, no other feline cases managed by balloon dilation have been reported. Only two of the canine cases reported were managed by fluoroscopy-and cystoscopy-guided balloon dilation, 2,31 with no associated complications or signs of re-obstruction noted 22 months post treatment. In the current case, follow-up retrograde urethrography showed persistent mild narrowing of the previous stricture site; however, there was normal flow of contrast into the bladder and resolution of clinical signs. This was considered a good outcome and repeat dilation was not necessary. The placement of stents, self-expanding metallic stents (SEMS) and balloon-expandable metallic stents have been reported as treatment for urethral strictures and malignant urethral obstructions in both dogs and cats. Ureteral obstruction is the main concern with placement of SEMS for proximal urethral obstructions in cats, owing to a more caudal entrance of the ureters in the area of the trigone; 17,18 therefore, balloon dilation was the preferred treatment choice in this case.",
