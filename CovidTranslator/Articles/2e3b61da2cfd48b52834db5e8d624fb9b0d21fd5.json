            "text": "The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) pandemic in Toronto resulted in a large number of autopsies on its victims. We describe the pulmonary pathology of patients who died in the 2003 Toronto outbreak. Autopsy material from the lungs of 20 patients who died between March and July 2003 were characterized by histology, molecular biology, and immunohistochemistry for cytokeratins, thyroid transcription factor-1, CD68, Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, and human herpes simplex viruses. Matched controls were obtained from patients who died of other causes over the same interval. The mean duration of illness was 27 days (range 5-108 days). Post-mortem lung tissues from 19 of 20 patients with probable SARS were positive for SARS-associated coronavirus by RT-PCR. Histologically, all patients showed varying degrees of exudative and proliferative phase acute lung injury, evidenced in conventional and immunohistochemical stains by edema, inflammatory infiltrate, pneumocyte hyperplasia, fibrinous exudates, and organization. Eight of 20 patients showed predominantly a diffuse alveolar damage pattern of acute lung injury, six showed predominantly an acute fibrinous and organizing pneumonia pattern, and the remainder showed an admixture of the two patterns. Squamous metaplasia and scattered multinucleate giant cells were present in most cases. Vascular fibrin thrombi were a common finding and were often associated with pulmonary infarcts. Special stains demonstrated vascular endothelial damage of both small-and mid-sized pulmonary vessels. Two cases were complicated by invasive fungal disease consistent with Aspergillosis, and another by coinfection with cytomegalovirus. Our findings indicate that the lungs of patients who die of SARS are almost always positive for the SARS-associated coronavirus by RT-PCR, and may show features of both diffuse alveolar damage and acute fibrinous and organizing pneumonia patterns of acute injury. Cases of SARS may be complicated by coexistent infections and therapy-related lung injury.",

Early in the course of the outbreak, autopsies were restricted to in situ chest examination (three cases). As understanding of the mode of transmission of SARS progressed, complete examinations were performed with appropriate safety precautions (N95/N97 masks, disposable hoods, visors, gowns, aprons, and gloves) (17 cases). Post-mortem tissues were sampled for histology, microbiology, electron microscopy, and molecular biology. Lung tissues from 22 SARS-CoV-negative patients who presented with significant lower respiratory tract symptoms and signs, and who died during the same period were similarly examined for comparison.",

Of these 11 patients, 10 showed a diffuse alveolar damage-predominant pattern, with only one patient showing admixed areas of acute fibrinous and organizing pneumonia (duration of illness \u00bc 16 days). Among these 11 patients, eight (73%) died within 14 days of onset of illness, compared with only five patients (25%) in the SARS group. Of the eight patients in the control group who died within 14 days, at least five showed evidence suggesting underlying bacterial sepsis (three cases severe acute bronchopneumonia, one case acute pyelonephritis, one case pseudomembranous colitis), while two showed evidence of myocardial infarction. The extent of acute diffuse alveolar damage was similar between groups (mean score 1.95 in SARS group vs 1.55 in the comparison group; P \u00bc 0.25), although among patients with duration of illness r14 days, there was more widespread acute diffuse alveolar damage in SARS patients than in the comparison group (mean score 2.80 vs 1.38; P \u00bc 0.001). Consistent with the shorter mean duration of illness among the comparison group, SARS patients as a whole also showed a greater frequency of organizing lung injury than the comparison group (95% of patients vs 36%), and other histologic findings typically associated with organizing phase diffuse alveolar damage were also more prominent in the SARS group as a whole than Within the SARS group, pneumocyte hyperplasia, with or without associated cytologic atypia, was more prominent in SARS cases of longer duration (Table 2) , as were squamous metaplasia and multinucleate giant cells (Table 3 and Figure 4 ). Characterization of the multinucleate giant cells by immunohistochemistry found the cells to be positive for CD68, but cytokeratin or TTF-1-positive multinucleated cells were not identified. Foci of bronchopneumonia were somewhat more frequent in cases of longer duration, but where present, were relatively minimal in their extent. Gram and Ziehl-Nielsen stains failed to identify causative bacterial organisms in these cases. Gomori methenamine silver stain revealed invasive fungal disease consistent with Aspergillosis in two cases (see below).

This injury was, in general, more prevalent and more extensive among SARS patients than among SARS-CoV-negative patients who died with respiratory symptoms over the same period (Table 1) , although there was a significant degree of overlap between the two cohorts. Other associated histologic features, such as pneumocyte hyperplasia, squamous metaplasia, and multinucleated cells, were also present in both groups of patients. Alhough some of these parameters were more prominent in the SARS group as a whole than in the comparison group, this likely reflects differences in duration of illness between the two groups, rather than differences intrinsic to the disease process itself. While not always readily apparent on routine H&E-stained sections, injury of the pulmonary vasculature was also a prominent feature of most SARS cases (Figures 5 and 6 ). This was manifested by intravascular fibrin thrombi and thromboemboli, associated in many cases with parenchymal infarcts. Such findings, however, were by no means unique to SARS cases, as similar findings could also be demonstrated in non-SARS cases showing diffuse alveolar damage. Thus, while lethal SARS-CoV infection was virtually always Pulmonary pathology of SARS DM Hwang et al associated with severe and extensive acute lung injury, we found no specific parameters that would allow definitive diagnosis of SARS-CoV infection prospectively, as opposed to other potential causes of acute respiratory distress syndrome, based on histology alone.",

Described by Beasley and colleagues as a histologic pattern of acute lung injury consisting of intra-alveolar fibrin balls and organizing pneumonia, 17 this was the predominant pattern of injury in one quarter of our cases, but was not reported in several prior studies describing the pulmonary pathology of SARS. [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] In their recent paper, Tse et al comment briefly on mild bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia-like changes in the subpleural region of four of seven SARS patients, 15 but it is unclear from their report whether these show the characteristic acute fibrinous exudates described by Beasley et al, or whether they represent a different process. The reasons for this discrepancy between the present study and prior reports are unclear, but may relate to the longer duration of illness or therapy in patients in the current study compared to previous studies, given that all acute fibrinous and organizing pneumoniapredominant cases in the present series had greater than 20 days' duration of illness (compared to less than 20 days for almost all previously reported cases). The significance of the presence of this pattern of injury, as opposed to classic diffuse alveolar damage alone, is also uncertain. Certainly, the presence of both patterns of injury side-by-side in some cases suggests that the acute fibrinous and organizing pneumonia pattern may simply represent a histologic variant of classic diffuse alveolar damage. However, that some patients exhibited Irrespective of the pattern of injury, patients with longer duration of illness exhibited more fibrosis than those of shorter duration, in keeping with findings from other groups. However, evidence of ongoing acute injury was present in most cases, up to 108 days after the onset of symptoms. Given the persistence of viral RNA in the lungs of all except one patient, such on-going injury could represent the sequelae of persistent SARS-CoV infection, or of injury secondary to other factors such as prolonged mechanical ventilation, or both.",

Despite the prominence of certain features such as vascular-endothelial injury in SARS lungs, the significant overlap between SARS and non-SARS cases makes it difficult, if not impossible, to differentiate diffuse alveolar damage secondary to SARS-CoV infection vs other etiologies, on the basis of histologic parameters alone. Given the persistence of virus in post-mortem lung tissue in the large majority of cases, ancillary tests such as RT-PCR, immunohistochemistry, or in situ hybridization 19 should be performed to rule out other etiologies and properly establish the diagnosis in suspected cases. While persistent infection by SARS-CoV may result in on-going lung injury long after the initial onset of symptoms, iatrogenic injury and coexistent superinfections may also contribute significantly to morbidity and mortality in certain patients.",
