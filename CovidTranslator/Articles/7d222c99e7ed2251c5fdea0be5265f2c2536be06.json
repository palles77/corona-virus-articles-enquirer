Methods: We conducted a prospective study between May 2004 and June 2005. Patients with acute pharyngo-tonsillitis were evaluated for causative pathogens and were assessed clinical symptoms and pharyngo-tonsillar finding by a clinical scoring system. Results: A total 214 adult patients were enrolled in this study. Streptococcus pyogenes were identified at 13.6%. Thirty-one viruses were also identified by PCR. They were adenovirus (4.8%), influenza virus (1.0%), RS virus (6.3%), and human metapneumovirus (2.9%). Numbers of total white blood cells and levels of C-reactive protein showed a significant positive correlation with clinical scores ( p < 0.001) and were also higher in cases with S. pyogenes. The clinical scores rapidly improved after the antimicrobial treatments in moderate cases and severe cases. Conclusion: The current study strongly suggested that the clinical scoring system reflected disease severity well and would be very useful for evaluating clinical course and decision making for the antimicrobial treatment of acute pharyngo-tonisllitis. #",

Most of cases are caused by viral infections and are self-limiting by only symptomatic treatments. Approximately 5-15% of cases in adults are caused by Streptococcus pyogenes (S. pyogenes) and prescribed antimicrobial agents [3, 5, 6, 10, [19] [20] [21] . In contrast to the rationale of managements for pharyngotonsillitis, antibiotics are actually prescribed to a majority of adult patients at approximately 75% [1, 16] . The best way to manage adult patients with pharyngo-tonsillitis has still been controversial among countries [8, 12, [23] [24] [25] 34] . Optimal management depends on both the clinical likelihood of infections with S. pyogenes and the relative importance assigned to the criteria to avoid over-use and/or under-use of antibiotics with preventing complications. It is important to develop a clinical scoring system easy to use and to assess accurate clinical features of acute pharyngo-tonsillitis with special emphasis on infections with S. pyogenes in adults [7, 9] .",

The patients were treated with or without antibiotics according to the severity of illness. Briefly, the mild cases were treated with oral antibiotics or symptomatic management without antibiotics, the moderate cases were treated with oral antibiotics, and the severe cases were treated with oral or parenteral antibiotics. For the evaluation of relationship between doctors' habit of using and selecting antimicrobial agents and the severity of illness, antimicrobial agents were selected and used by physician's own decision.

In the current study, we defined causative pathogens and the severity of acute pharyngo- tonsillitis by a clinical scoring system in adult patients. Most of acute pharyngo-tonsillitis were reported to be caused by viruses such as adenovirus, rhinovirus, corona virus, parainfluenza virus, coxackie virus, influenza virus, herpes virus, and cytomegalovirus and were considered to be selflimiting [4, 19] . In this study, the frequencies of viruses in adult acute pharyngo-tonsillitis were lower rather than those reported in children, when we applied PCR/RT-PCR to identify four important viruses such as RS virus, adenovirus, influenza virus, and hMPV from pharyngeal swab. The implication of viral infections might be low in adult acute pharyngo-tonsillitis [29, 31] . Bacteria were identified in 73.3% of patients studied herein. S. pyogenes that had been reported as an important causative pathogen responsible for acute pharyngo-tonsillitis were identified at 13.6% [15, 28, 32] . Other hemolytic streptococci were also frequently identified from the patients with acute pharyngotonsillitis. However, the pathogenic roles of group C or G streptococci in the upper respiratory tract infections have not been completely studied. The Haemophilus spp. and Staphylococcus spp. are more controversial. Isolation of S. pyogenes was closely related with the high value of inflammatory parameters such as white blood cells and Creactive protein compared to isolation of other pathogens.",

            "text": "Determinations of infections due to S. pyogenes have been an important issue for studying acute pharyngotonsillitis [2, 14, 17, 22] . Several clinical findings have the discriminative value in distinguishing S. pyogenes from other causes of acute pharyngo-tonsillitis. The ability of experienced physicians to predict positive throat cultures of S. pyogenes is moderate with estimated sensitivity and specificity ranging from 55 to 74% and 58 to 76%, respectively. In an attempt to improve clinical sensitivity and specificity, investigators have developed clinical decision rules based on constellation of physical signs and symptoms [13, 30, 33] . The Centor score has been the most reliable predictors for estimating the likelihood of infections of S. pyogenes in a patients presenting with a sore throat [9] . The score is calculated by determining how many of the following four clinical features are present: history of fever, tonsillar exudates, anterior cervical adenopathy, and absence of cough. At the usual clinical setting, the majority of primary care physicians prescribe antimicrobial agents and pain-killers based on the severity of illness [18] . Although the Center score is useful to infer S. pyogenes, the score is not valuable for diagnosis of the severity of the illness. A rapid antigen detection kit for S. pyogenes using a latex agglutination method also applied to determine infections with S. pyogenes. The test showed negative predicting value at 95% and relatively lower positive predicting value at 62% [37] . There has been a general consensus that negative rapid antigen tests for S. pyogenes should be confirmed by the culture test [17] . However, recent guidelines have suggested that confirmation of negative rapid antigen test results for S. pyogenes in adults is either not necessary at all or only if the sensitivity of the rapid antigen test is <80% [11, 28] . The rapid antigen tests has the lower sensitivity compared to a well-performed culture. Therefore, the importance of rapid identification of S. pyogenes is still controversial.",

The scoring system reflected severities of the illness correlated well with numbers of WBC and levels of CRP. Although we could not found any correlations between identification of S. pyogenes and severity of the disease, identification of S. pyogenes clearly correlated with numbers of WBC and levels of CRP. Regarding to antibiotic treatment, it is important to discriminate causative agents such as bacterial and/or virus infection in acute pharyngo-tonsillitis. However, it is sometimes difficult to discriminate them in the usual clinical setting. The current study was also designed to evaluate correlation among clinical parameters such as clinical scores, WBC, and CRP. Viruses were identified in only 21 (9.8%) patients and there were no correlation between identification of viruses and numbers of WBC or levels of CRP. In contrast, the numbers of total WBC and the levels of CRP at the first visit were significantly higher in cases with S. pyogenes indicationg the importance of S. pyogenes as the causative pathogen for acute pharyngotonsillitis. Thus, the clinical scoring system together with blood test could discriminate the possible bacterial infections from virus infections.",

The study on the difference of treatment outcomes among various age groups reported that group A b-hemolytic streptococcus required antibiotic therapy [35, 36] . In this study, a marked reduction of clinical scores after antimicrobial treatments in severe and moderate cases indicated high efficacy of them for the illness with higher severity. On the other hand, mild cases showed decrease of scores regardless of antimicrobial treatments. Thus, the current study strongly suggested that the clinical scoring system reflected disease severity well and would be very useful for evaluating clinical course and decision making for the antimicrobial treatment of acute pharyngo-tonisllitis.",
