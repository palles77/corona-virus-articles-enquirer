The alarming rise of highly virulent and multi-drug-resistant pathogens, their rapid spread leading to frequent global pandemics, fears of bioterrorism, and continued life-threatening nosocomial infections in hospitals remain as major challenges to health care in the USA and worldwide. Early diagnosis and rapid monitoring are essential for appropriate management and control of infections. Tomographic molecular imaging enables rapid, noninvasive visualization, localization, and monitoring of molecular processes deep within the body and offers several advantages over traditional tools used for the study of infectious diseases. Noninvasive, longitudinal assessments could streamline animal studies, allow unique insights into disease pathogenesis, and expedite clinical translation of new therapeutics. Since molecular imaging is already in common use in the clinic, it could also become a valuable tool for clinical studies, for patient care, for public health, and for enabling precision medicine for infectious diseases.",

            "text": "Humans in the modern era are increasingly prone to virulent infections. Selection and dissemination of Bsuper bugs^by overuse (misuse) of antimicrobials, global travel and the rapid spread of infections, and the increasing use of medical procedures-implants, catheters, immunosuppressive/cancer therapies-are leading to life-threatening infections that are a growing threat to humanity [1] [2] [3] [4] . In 2011, about 722,000 Americans developed hospital-acquired infections, resulting in 75,000 deaths in the USA. Bacteria, notably from the Enterobacteriaceae family (26.8 %) , Clostridium difficile (12.1 %), Staphylococcus aureus (10.7 %), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (7.1 %), accounted for the majority of these infections [5, 6] . Similarly, viral infections such as influenza cause millions of new cases and several thousand deaths annually in the USA [7] . The burden of hospital-acquired and other infections is substantially higher globally. For example, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative agent for tuberculosis (TB), was responsible for 10.4 and 1.8 million new cases and deaths in 2015 alone [8] . The alarming rise of multi-drug-resistant (MDR) and extensively drugresistant (XDR) strains, as well as HIV co-infection, continues to fuel this epidemic [8] [9] [10] . Global travel and rapid spread of infections-swine flu, SARS-CoV, Ebola, and Zika virus-have led to several recent global pandemics [11, 12] . Finally, several infectious pathogens, e.g., Yersinia pestis (causes plague) from the Enterobacteriaceae family, are also recognized as biothreat agents [13] . these processes in vivo is a key to controlling infections. Therefore, the World Molecular Imaging Society has made a commitment for advancing imaging tools for infectious diseases and inflammation by creating the Imaging of Infection Interest Group (IOI-IG). This interest group is tasked with the mission to globally advance the development of new imaging technologies for infectious diseases and the translation of effective imaging tools to provide unique insights into disease mechanisms, enable drug and vaccine development, guide treatments, and benefit patients (Fig. 1 ). As part of these efforts, the IOI-IG organized several sessions at the 2016 World Molecular Imaging Congress (WMIC). This included a 1-day workshop focused on imaging of infection and inflammation, which brought together individuals from multiple scientific disciplines and highlighted the latest developments in the field. In addition, the workshop also had a panel discussion on the challenges in funding research, with panelists from the US National Institutes of Health. A similar workshop is planned at the 2017 WMIC (Philadelphia, PA) and will focus on leveraging current resources, promoting collaborations, clinical translation, and finding strategies to overcome the challenges in funding research in this emerging field.",

However, traditional diagnostic tools, namely microscopy, microbiology, and molecular techniques, are dependent upon sampling suspected sites of infection, often blindly, and then performing assays that can be time consuming. While major advances are being made in the application of molecular techniques such as nucleic acid amplification (NAA), deep sequencing, and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization, they are all dependent on the availability of a relevant clinical sample. Easily obtained clinical samples such as blood or urine may lack relevance and not contribute to a specific diagnosis, especially with deep-seated infections, and invasive biopsies are often required. Biopsies can be costly, risky (anesthesia, dangers of surgery), and prone to incorrect sampling (limited to the tip of the biopsy needle) as well as lead to the introduction of artifacts or contamination. Molecular imaging techniques detect crucial biological and biochemical changes at the sites of infection, often at the earliest phase of the disease, thereby allowing the clinician to promptly identify not only the infective or inflammatory focus but also the class of the causative pathogen and establish the best therapeutic approach for patients.",

            "text": "Optical imaging methods have been used extensively to study disease pathogenesis, largely in small laboratory animals. For example, real-time analysis of Mycobacterium marinum infection in the transparent zebrafish has provided new insights into the temporal kinetics of host-pathogen interactions [14] . Similarly, immune responses to central nervous system (CNS) viral infections were visualized in real time using intravital twophoton laser scanning microscopy [15] . While highly sensitive, optical imaging is limited by the depth of the signal and is therefore well suited for the study of laboratory animal models but has limited clinical utility. The limited depth of penetration of signal is not a problem using nuclear medicine tools. For example, 2-deoxy-2-[ 18 F]fluoro-D-glucose ([ 18 F]FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) and computed tomography (CT) were used to monitor the spatial evolution of individual pulmonary lesions in a cohort of infected mice that develops TB lesions akin to humans [16] [17] [18] and study the temporal evolution of reactivation pulmonary TB (relapse) [19] . It was noted that the fate of individual pulmonary lesions in the same animal varied substantially. More interestingly, several lesions also arose de novo within regions with no prior lesions suggesting that dormant bacteria may also reside outside TB lesions. Similar variability of TB lesion within the same host was also reported in non-human primates [20] . Molecular imaging can therefore provide unique insights into disease pathogenesis that are not possible with traditional tools. Other applications include assessing hideouts of infections, defining the diversity of the microbial populations (microbiome), and providing end points to assess antimicrobial or vaccine efficacy or predict stable cure.",

Inadequate drug concentrations in target tissues can lead to treatment failure and selection of drug-resistant organisms. Additionally, altered metabolism in diseased states may lead to organ toxicities. Vancomycin, a widely used antimicrobial to treat drug-resistant, Gram-positive bacteria, highlights these limitations. Studies performed in response to treatment failures noted in patients with standard doses of vancomycin revealed that it penetrates poorly into infected tissues, with levels only one sixth of plasma [21] . Conversely, high levels of vancomycin can cause nephrotoxicity. Based on these data, new recommendations have been developed for vancomycin [22] , which, unfortunately, had been inappropriately under-dosed for decades.",

For example, given the importance of rifampin for successful cure, potential for shortening the duration of TB treatments, and the limited availability of in situ data [23] , dynamic PET imaging was performed over 60 min after injection of 11 C-rifampin in live, M. tuberculosis-infected mice [24] . 11 C-rifampin rapidly distributed and quickly localized to the liver. Areas under the concentration-time curve for the first 60 min (AUC 0-60 ) in infected and uninfected mice were uniformly low in the brain (10 to 20 % of blood values). However, lower concentrations were noted in necrotic lung tissues of infected mice than in healthy lungs, demonstrating the need for higher dosing than those determined by serum levels alone.",

Similarly, highly sensitive, current nuclear imaging tools such as [ 111 In]oxine-tagged white blood cell, single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), and [ 18 F]FDG PET, which are increasingly being used for infections, are non-specific [25] .

For example, phase III TB trials entail treating hundreds of patients \u22656 months and monitoring for \u22651 year thereafter for relapse [48] . As M. tuberculosis can infect any part of the lung (or extra-pulmonary sites), traditional tools such as sputum culture or NAA (e.g., Xpert\u00ae MTB/RIF) do not always correlate with the overall disease burden. Recently, Chen et al. reported that [ 18 F]FDG PET and CT imaging were superior to traditional (sputum) microbiology for monitoring response to treatments in adults with MDR-TB [49] . In this study, quantitative changes in lesion volumes on CT imaging were predictive of treatment responses. Moreover, quantitative changes in [ 18 F]FDG PET not only correlated with treatment responses but were also predictive of long-term treatment outcomes. In another more recent study, given the absence of clinical or microbiological markers of disease, low-radiation exposure pulmonary CT imaging was successfully used to monitor treatment response in a 2-year-old child with XDR-TB and guide an individualized drug regimen [9] . Imaging agents with higher specificity for TB-associated inflammation have been shown to be promising in animal models [45] . Pathogen-specific imaging could be an even better predictor of treatment responses [36] . For example, both 18 F-labeled maltohexaose and [ 18 F]FDS PET could rapidly identify therapeutic failures associated with drug-resistant infections [34, 36] .",

However, recent technological developments have significantly lowered radiation exposure and also allowed rapid scans that avoids the need for sedation in children. For example, the effective dose for each chest CT in the child treated for XDR-TB was 0.4-0.7 mSv [9] . This is equivalent to 3 months of natural background radiation, a single screening mammography, or four trans-Atlantic airplane round trips [55] [56] [57] . Moreover, no sedation was required for this child as scan times were short (3 s). We calculated the risks related to infections, with TB as an example, and compared them to the various imaging techniques used currently (Fig. 2) . The risk of mortality for patients with MDR-and XDR-TB on treatment is similar to that due to cancers [8, 52, 58] . Moreover, even patients with drugsusceptible TB on treatment have several orders of magnitude higher risk of mortality than the theoretical risk due to radiationinduced cancers [59, 60] . Development of nuclear imaging tracers with short half-life isotopes and rapid elimination from the body could further limit radiation exposure. While no studies should be performed without an excellent rationale and clinical indication, we need to be pragmatic about the (minimal) risks of imaging, especially when dealing with infections due to MDR organisms.",

Moreover, CT, MRI, and PET/CT costs are substantially lower,~$50-$100 for CT and MRI and $300 for PET per scan at private (for-profit centers) in developing nations such as India than in the USA [53] . Mobile PET scanners and 68 Ga PET agents that can be generated without the need of a cyclotron hold great promise for use in remote areas [29] . China has already overtaken the USA to become the largest economy in purchasing power parity, with India expected to become the second largest economy in purchasing power parity by 2050 [65] . Infections are rampant in the developing world, and given the considerable number of people living in big cities, advanced imaging has the potential to become a powerful routine clinical tool for the early diagnosis and monitoring of infectious diseases in developing countries.",
