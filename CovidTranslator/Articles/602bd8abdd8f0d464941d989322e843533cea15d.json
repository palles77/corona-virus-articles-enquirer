However, the factors mediating fatal SARS-CoV-2 infections are poorly understood. Here, we show that cigarette smoke causes a dose-dependent upregulation of Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2), the SARS-CoV-2 receptor, in rodent and human lungs. Using single-cell sequencing data, we demonstrate that ACE2 is expressed in a subset of epithelial cells that line the respiratory tract, including goblet cells, club cells, and alveolar type 2 cells. Chronic smoke exposure triggers a protective expansion of mucus-secreting goblet cells and a concomitant increase in ACE2 expression. In contrast, quitting smoking causes a decrease in lung ACE2 levels. Taken together, these results may partially explain why smokers are particularly likely to develop severe SARS-CoV-2 infections, and they suggest that quitting smoking could lessen coronavirus susceptibility.",

            "text": "In December 2019, a novel respiratory disease emerged in a seafood market in Wuhan, China 1 . Genomic sequencing demonstrated that the causative agent was a highly-contagious coronavirus, since named SARS-CoV-2 2,3 . The disease, called COVID-19, rapidly spread worldwide, and as of March 2020, more than 600,000 people have been infected and more than 25,000 people have died 4 . No clinically-validated treatment or vaccine for COVID-19 is currently available. Thus, understanding the factors that mediate susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 is crucial for controlling disease transmission. Molecular analysis has begun to shed light on how SARS-CoV-2 infections occur. Like a related coronavirus that emerged in 2003 5 , SARS-CoV-2 enters human cells by binding to the extracellular domain of Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) 3,6 . Importantly, ACE2 is both necessary and sufficient for infection by SARS-CoV-2: ACE2-targeting antibodies block viral uptake in permissive cells while transgenic expression of human ACE2 allows viral entry in nonhuman cells. ACE2 normally functions in the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) by cleaving the vasoconstrictive hormone angiotensin-II into the vasodilator angiotensin 1-7 7 . Sequestration of ACE2 by coronavirus dysregulates the RAS pathway, contributing to morbidity 8 . Additionally, ACE2 levels are capable of influencing disease progression: among a cohort of mice engineered to express human ACE2, mice expressing the highest levels of ACE2 mRNA exhibited the shortest survival time following coronavirus exposure 9 . Thus, the regulation of ACE2 expression likely has a significant effect on SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility.",

Additionally, cigarette smokers are highly susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 and are significantly more likely to require aggressive clinical interventions: in a study of 1,099 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19, 12.3% of current smokers required mechanical ventilation, were admitted to an ICU, or died, compared to only 4.7% of non-smokers 12 .

ACE2 was consistently expressed at high levels in mouse, rat, and human kidneys, consistent with its role as a regulator of the RAS pathway. ACE2 was also robustly expressed in rodent and human lungs, the predominant location of coronavirus infections. Interestingly, significant ACE2 expression was evident in the mouse and human small intestine. Viral RNA has been detected in stool samples from patients with COVID-19 19 , and gastrointestinal symptoms have been reported in a subset of affected individuals 12 , suggesting a potential alternate route for SARS-CoV-2 transmission. However, as SARS-CoV-2 is primarily spread through viral inhalation, we focused our study on factors that affect ACE2 expression in the lung and associated respiratory tissue.",

Similarly, ACE2 expression in rodent lungs was not significantly different between sexes ( Figure 1C -D) 17,21 . We next assessed the expression of ACE2 in two different human cohorts: 1) lung tissue from the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx) 15, 16 and 2) whole-lung tissue samples from organ donors 22 . These datasets yielded results that were consistent with our rodent analyses: ACE2 expression was equivalent between men and women and between young individuals (<29 years) and elderly individuals (>70 years)( Figure 1E -H). In total, these findings suggest that the increased morbidity of men and older patients with COVID-19 is unlikely to result from inherent differences in ACE2 expression in the respiratory tract.",

Strikingly, we found a dose-dependent increase in ACE2 expression according to smoke exposure ( Figure 2A ). Mice exposed to the highest dose of cigarette smoke expressed ~80% more ACE2 in their lungs compared to sham-treated mice. To determine whether this association was present in humans as well, we assessed three cohorts of current smokers and never-smokers 25-27 . For these analyses, lung epithelial cells were sampled from either the small or large airways by fiberoptic bronchoscopy. In each cohort, we observed that tissue collected from smokers exhibited ~40%-50% more ACE2 compared to tissue from nonsmokers ( Figure 2B -D).",

For patients undergoing cancer-related surgeries, a sample of pathologically-normal tissue distant from the suspected tumor was used for analysis. In both cohorts, lung samples from patients who reported smoking the greatest number of pack-years also expressed the highest levels of ACE2 ( Figure 2E -F). For instance, among smokers undergoing thoracic surgery, patients who had smoked more than 80 pack-years exhibited a ~100% increase in ACE2 expression relative to patients who had smoked less than 20 pack-years ( Figure 2E ). Multivariate linear regression on this dataset further confirmed that smoking history was a significant predictor of ACE2 expression even when controlling for a patient's age, sex, race, and body-mass index (Table 1) . Lastly, we compared the expression level of ACE2 in lung epithelial cells from current smokers and former smokers 30 , and we found that quitting smoking was associated with a 30% decrease in ACE2 expression ( Figure 2F ). In total, our results demonstrate that exposure to cigarette smoke increases the expression of the coronavirus receptor ACE2 in rodent and human respiratory tissue, and this upregulation is potentially reversible.",

However, ACE2 was not up-regulated in lung cells from a large cohort of patients with asthma or from patients with the lung disease sarcoidosis ( Figure S2C-D) 34, 35 . Similarly, ACE2 expression was unaffected in lung tissue from a mouse model of cystic fibrosis or in mice exposed to a variety of carcinogens, including arsenic, ionizing radiation (IR), and 1,3-butadiene ( Figure S2E -G) 36-39 .

ACE2 was expressed solely in the EpCAM+ clusters that comprise the lung epithelium 49 , and was not detected in CD45+ immune cells 50 , PDGFRA+ mesenchymal cells 51 , or TMEM100+ endothelial cells ( Figure 3A ) 52 . We therefore focused on localizing ACE2 within the epithelial lineage. We found that ACE2 was strongly expressed in a cluster of cells that express secretory markers including MUC5AC, GABRP, and SCGB1A1 that we identified as being comprised of closely-related goblet and club cells ( Figure 3B -C) 48,53-55 . Additionally, ACE2 expression was observed in a subset of LAMP3+ alveolar type 2 cells 56 , but was largely absent from RTKN2+ alveolar type 1 cells 48 and FOXJ1+ ciliated cells 57 . We next identified the transcripts whose expression correlated with ACE2. Across all cells, ACE2 levels exhibited the strongest correlation with CLDN10 (Claudin-10), a tight-junction protein that contributes to the formation of the bronchial epithelium and that is expressed by club cells and goblet cells ( Figure 3C ) 58,59 . Gene ontology analysis revealed that ACE2-correlated transcripts were enriched for genes involved in xenobiotic metabolism, antioxidant activity, and cellular detoxification, consistent with the bronchial epithelium's role as a barrier against toxins and foreign matter ( Figure 3D and Table S2A ) 60 .",

To investigate this hypothesis, we examined a dataset of single-cell transcriptomes collected by fiberoptic bronchoscopy from current smokers and never-smokers 59 . Notably, these cells were sorted and enriched for an epithelial cell marker (ALCAM) prior to sequencing. Additionally, they were collected from the main stem bronchus, and subsequently harbor few RTKN2+ or LAMP3+ alveolar cells 59 .

We found that ACE2 expression was observed in both MUC5AC+ goblet cells and SCGB1A1+ club cells, but was largely absent from the basal cell, ciliated cell, and ionocyte clusters ( Figure 4A -B). Next, we separated the cells harvested from current smokers and never-smokers and then analyzed each population separately. Consistent with previous reports 61-63 , we detected an increase in goblet cells in the lungs of current smokers: while 17% of cells from non-smokers expressed the canonical goblet marker MUC5AC 53 , 47% of cells collected from smokers were positive for MUC5AC ( Figure 4C -D). Cells that expressed other mucus-and goblet cell-related genes, including MUC1 67 , AGR2 68 , and SPDEF 69 , were similarly over-represented in the lungs of smokers. KRT5+ basal stem cells were depleted in the smokers' epithelia, likely reflecting their differentiation into secretory cells ( Figure 4C ). However, we note that in this dataset, we observed an increase in the percentage of ACE2+ cells between non-smokers and smokers that was not statistically-significant. This may reflect the small number of cells that were analyzed (~1,000) or the small number of smokers that were profiled (six).",

As our single-cell analysis suggested that the coronavirus receptor ACE2 is expressed in secretory goblet and club cells, we investigated whether in vitro mucociliary differentiation increases ACE2 expression. Indeed, in mouse tracheal extracts 73 and primary human lung cells 74 , mucociliary differentiation resulted in a highly-significant upregulation of ACE2 ( Figure 4E -F). Finally, to investigate the link between smoking, differentiation, and ACE2 expression, we examined data from human bronchial epithelial cells cultured at an ALI in which cells were either exposed to clean air or to diluted cigarette smoke 75 . Remarkably, treatment with cigarette smoke during in vitro differentiation resulted in a significant upregulation of ACE2, MUC5AC, MUC1, and other secretory cell markers, relative to cells that were differentiated in clean air ( Figure 4G ). ACE2 expression was increased by ~42% in smoke-exposed cells, comparable to the increases that we observed between the lungs of non-smokers and smokers ( Figure 2 ). In total, our results demonstrate that a subset of lung secretory cells express the coronavirus receptor ACE2, and cigarette smoke promotes the expansion of this cell population.",

By analyzing datasets from both mice and humans, and by including cells collected from bronchial brushing, we also demonstrate the presence of ACE2 in the secretory cells that participate in mucociliary clearance 42 . As these cells line the upper respiratory tract, they may represent the initial site of coronavirus infections, followed by an eventual spread and migration into the alveoli. Moreover, secretory cell hyperplasia is a well-described consequence of prolonged smoke exposure 61-63 , potentially explaining the consistent up-regulation of ACE2 in smokers' lungs. Interestingly, ACE2-knockout mice have been reported to be particularly vulnerable to lung failure following forced acid inhalation 85 .

Nonetheless, the relevance of increased ACE2 expression as a driver of disease susceptibility in humans or for SARS-CoV-2 remains to be demonstrated. Chronic smokers may exhibit a number of co-morbidities, including emphysema, atherosclerosis, and decreased immune function 86 , that are also likely to affect COVID-19 progression. While the effects of smoking can last for years, smoking cessation causes an improvement in lung function and an overall decrease in disease burden 86 .

Gene expression data was acquired from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) 89 , the GTEx portal 15 , the Broad Institute TCGA Firehose 90 , the Human Cell Atlas 91 , and the Single-Cell Expression Atlas 92 , as described below. For microarray datasets, probeset definitions were downloaded from GEO, and probes mapping to the same gene were collapsed by averaging. For each gene expression comparison, a control population was identified (e.g., young rats, shamtreated mice, non-smokers, etc.), and gene expression values were log2-transformed and normalized by subtraction so that the mean expression of a gene of interest in the control population was 0. Graphs of gene expression values were then generated using Graphpad Prism; all data points are displayed and no outliers were excluded from analysis.",
