There is 28 currently a lack of knowledge in the antibody response elicited from SARS-CoV-2 29 infection. One major immunological question is concerning the antigenic differences 30 between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV. We address this question by using plasma from 31 patients infected by SARS-CoV-2 or SARS-CoV, and plasma obtained from infected or 32 immunized mice. Our results show that while cross-reactivity in antibody binding to the 33 spike protein is common, cross-neutralization of the live viruses is rare, indicating the 34 presence of non-neutralizing antibody response to conserved epitopes in the spike.",

The S protein 55 forms a homotrimer in which each protomer is composed of two subunits, S1 and S2 56 (Figure 1A) . Binding between the receptor-binding domain (RBD) in the S1 subunit and 57 the ACE2 receptor triggers a conformational change in the S protein that subsequently 58 initiates membrane fusion events with the host cell. The RBD is also a primary target of 59 the antibody response in humoral immunity and is believed to be the major protective 60 antigen (Chen et al., 2005) . The prefusion structure of the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 has 61 been recently determined by cryo-EM (Wrapp et al., 2020) , and revealed overall 62 structural similarity to that of SARS-CoV. However, most monoclonal antibodies tested 63 to date that target the RBD of SARS-CoV have failed to bind to the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 64 (Tian et al., 2020; Wrapp et al., 2020) , suggesting that the antigenicity of these two 4 polyclonal human sera from patients to evaluate the antibody response elicited by 67 SARS-CoV-2 infection and to determine whether cross-reactive antibody responses 68 between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV can be generated. In this study, we examined the 69 antibody responses in 15 patients from Hong Kong who were infected by SARS-CoV-2, 70 and seven by SARS-CoV. Mice infected or immunized with SARS-CoV-2 or SARS-CoV 71 were also used to investigate cross-reactivity of antibody responses between SARS-",

These cross-reactive antibody responses mostly target non-162 RBD regions. Consistently, higher sequence conservation is found between the S2 163 subunits of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV (90% amino-acid sequence identity) as 164 compared to that of their RBDs (73% amino-acid sequence identity). Nonetheless, some 165 SARS-CoV-2-infected patients were able to produce cross-reactive antibody responses 166 to SARS-CoV RBD.

Only one out of 15 SARS-CoV-2-infected patients was able to generate a cross-173 neutralizing response to both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV viruses, and this cross-174 reactive response was very weak. Therefore, it is possible that only a subset of the 175 cross-reactive binding epitopes is a bona fide neutralizing epitope. This notion is also 176 supported by our recent study, which showed that the cross-reactive antibody CR3022 177 could not neutralize SARS-CoV-2 despite its strong binding (Yuan et al., 2020) .

To substrate the background noise caused by the unspecific 262 binding of antibodies from the samples, serum-specific background noise (SSBN) 263 normalization approach was used (Moritz et al., 2019). In brief, an additional plate was 264 coated overnight with PBS buffer only. The plates coated with either purified 265 recombinant protein or PBS were then blocked with PBS containing 5% non-fat milk 266 powder at room temperature for 2 hours. Each mouse plasma sample was 1:10 diluted 267 and human sample was serially diluted from 1:100 to 1:12800 in PBS. Each sample was 268 then added into the ELISA plates that were coated with purified recombinant protein or 269 PBS buffer respectively for 2-hour incubation at 37\u00b0C. After extensive washing with PBS 270 containing 0.1% Tween 20, each well in the plate was further incubated with the HRP-271 sheep anti-mouse or anti-human secondary antibody (1:5000, GE Healthcare) for 1 hour 272 at 37\u00b0C. The ELISA plates were then washed five times with PBS containing 0.1% 273 Tween 20. Subsequently, 50 \u00b5L of each solution A and B (R&D Systems) was added wavelength.
