Objectives: To describe the epidemiology and etiologies of respiratory illnesses among pilgrims returning to Jordan after the 2014 Hajj. Study design: Surveillance for respiratory illness among pilgrims returning to Jordan after the 2014 Hajj was conducted at sentinel health care facilities using epidemiologic surveys and molecular diagnostic testing of upper respiratory specimens for multiple respiratory pathogens, including MERS-CoV. Results: Among the 125 subjects, 58% tested positive for at least one virus; 47% tested positive for rhino/enterovirus. No cases of MERS-CoV were detected. Conclusions: The majority of pilgrims returning to Jordan from the 2014 Hajj with respiratory illness were determined to have a viral etiology, but none were due to MERS-CoV. A greater understanding of the epidemiology of acute respiratory infections among returning travelers to other countries after Hajj should help optimize surveillance systems and inform public health response practices.",

The emergence of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) prompted additional travel guidance and enhanced surveillance following Hajj, including in Jordan, which has reported cases of MERS-CoV and shares its eastern and southern borders with KSA [1, 4] . Based upon the number of Hajj visas issued, approximately 5600 pilgrims from Jordan traveled to KSA for the 2014 Hajj. In October 2014, Jordan established targeted surveillance of acute respiratory illnesses in Hajj pilgrims returning to Jordan.",

Persons were considered for enrollment in surveillance if they (1) traveled to the 2014 Hajj, and (2) presented with respiratory illness. Institutional Review Board approval was obtained in Jordan for this public health response, and verbal consent was obtained prior to enrollment. Targeted demographic and clinical information were collected (listed in Table 1 ) by in-person interview using a brief, standardized questionnaire.",

Our surveillance employed geographically diverse sentinel sites and comprehensive targeted health messaging, but it is possible that symptomatic cases were incompletely captured, particularly in pilgrims with milder illness who may have been less likely to present to medical care after their return. Finally, although a minority of subjects refused NP swabs, lower rates of pathogen detection were not observed in these subjects.
