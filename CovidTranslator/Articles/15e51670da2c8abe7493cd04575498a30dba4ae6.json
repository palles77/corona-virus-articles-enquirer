This enzyme plays an essential role in viral replication and transcription since a mutation in the related H229E human coronavirus nsp15 gene can abolish viral RNA synthesis. SARS full-length Nsp15 (346 amino acids) has been cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli with an N-terminal hexahistidine tag and has been purified to homogeneity. The protein was subsequently crystallized using PEG 8000 or 10 000 as precipitants. Small cubic crystals of the apoenzyme were obtained from 100 nl nanodrops. They belong to space group P4 1 32 or P4 3 32, with unit-cell parameters a = b = c = 166.8 \u00c5 . Diffraction data were collected to a maximum resolution of 2.7 \u00c5 .",

These polypeptides are autoproteolytically processed by two viral proteases, yielding 16 non-structural proteins (Nsps) which, together with a number of processing intermediates and host proteins, are thought to form a huge protein complex responsible for viral replication and transcription. Despite the growing interest in coronaviruses, the biochemical and structural characterization of the non-structural proteins still lags behind. In the last two years, despite tremendous efforts worldwide, only three X-ray structures of Nsps were reported: those of Nsp5, the main protease, of Nsp9, a novel RNA-binding protein, and of the complex Nsp7-Nsp8 (Anand et al., 2003; Egloff et al., 2004; Sutton et al., 2004; Zhai et al., 2005) .",

Comparative genomics has made it possible to identify similarity between Nsp15 and only one other protein, XendoU, an endoribonuclease from Xenopus laevis studied by Caffarelli et al. (1997) . XendoU is involved in the processing of U16 small nucleolar RNA from its host pre-mRNA. It is poly(U)specific and requires Mn 2+ as a cofactor (Caffarelli et al., 1997; Laneve et al., 2003) . It has been suggested, therefore, that Nsp15 might be an endoribonuclease (Snijder et al., 2003) , which is unique to nidoviruses within the RNA viral world.",

The main activity of Nsp15 is to cleave 5 0 to uridylates in double-stranded RNA, which requires the presence of divalent cations. Like other endoribonucleases, Nsp15 uses Mn 2+ as cofactor; in the presence of Mg 2+ or other metal cations lower or no activity is detected. Nsp15 has been shown to be highly specific for RNA. DNA is not cleaved and does not inhibit RNA digestion, thus indicating that it does not bind to Nsp15 (Bhardwaj et al., 2004) . Single-stranded RNA is also cleaved, but less specifically and efficiently than doublestranded RNA (Ivanov et al., 2004) . Electron microscopy as well as other biophysical techniques have revealed that Nsp15 monomers form hexameric structures (Guarino et al., 2005) .",

The reaction generates a product carrying a cyclic 2 0 -3 0 phosphodiester terminus. Recent work (Gioia et al., 2005) has suggested that XendoU and the viral endoribonucleases related to it do not belong to either of the previously described groups.

Dobbe and E. J. Snijder (Drosten et al., 2003) using two primers containing the attB sites of the Gateway recombination system (Invitrogen). A sequence encoding a hexahistidine tag was added at the 5 0 end of the gene. The cDNA was cloned in the pDest14 plasmid according to Gateway cloning technology (Invitrogen). Multiparameter expression screening in Escherichia coli was performed using a sparse matrix (Abergel et al., 2003) , followed by the dot blot detection procedure (Vincentelli et al., 2005) . The optimized expression condition used E. coli strain C41(DE3) (Avidis) transformed with the pLysS plasmid (Novagen) and grown in Turbo Broth media (Athena Enzymes) at 298 K. Overnight induction was performed with 0.5 mM IPTG when OD 600 reached 0.5. Expression yielded about 1.5 mg of soluble Nsp15 per litre of culture. The cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in 10 ml of buffer A (50 mM Tris pH 8, 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM imidazole, 1 mM PMSF, 0.2 mg ml \u00c01 lysozyme, 0.1 mg ml \u00c01 DNase, 20 mM MgSO 4 and protease-cocktail inhibitor; Sigma) per OD 600 unit and per litre of culture. Cells were lysed by sonication and centrifuged (20 000g) for 40 min at 277 K. The purification consisted of two steps. Firstly, IMAC (immobilized metal-ion affinity chromatography) was performed on a Hisprep column (Amersham). The protein was eluted with 50 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 250 mM imidazole pH 8.0. Size-exclusion chromatography was performed using a Superdex 200 HiLoad 26/60 (Amersham) in 10 mM Tris, 50 mM NaCl pH 7.5. Nsp15 was eluted with a retention volume corresponding to a molecular weight of about 250 kDa, corresponding to a hexameric association, as also observed by Guarino et al. (2005) . Protein purity was analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The recombinant protein was concentrated using Amicon Ultra (5000 kDa molecular-weight cutoff).",
