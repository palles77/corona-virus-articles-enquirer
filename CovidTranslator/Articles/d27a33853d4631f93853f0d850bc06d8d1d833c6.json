            "text": "The outbreak of the 2019 novel coronavirus disease has caused more than 100,000 people to be infected and has caused thousands of deaths. Currently, the number of infections and deaths is still increasing rapidly. COVID-19 seriously threatens human health, production, life, social functioning and international relations, and has caused widespread concern around the globe. In the fight against COVID-19, geographic information systems (GIS) and big data technologies have played an important role in many aspects, including the rapid aggregation of multisource big data, rapid visualization of epidemic information, spatial tracking of COVID-19, prediction of regional transmission, identification of the spatial allocation of risk and selection of the control level, balance and management of the supply and demand of medical resources, social-emotional guidance and panic elimination, the provision of solid spatial information support for decision-making about COVID-19 prevention and control, measures formulation, and assessment of the effectiveness of COVID-19 prevention and control. GIS has developed and matured relatively quickly and has a complete technological route for data preparation, platform construction, model construction, and map production. However, for the struggle against COVID-19, the main challenge is finding strategies to adjust traditional technical methods and improve speed and accuracy to provide accurate information for rapid social management. Additionally, in the era of big data, data no longer come mainly from the government but are gathered from more diverse enterprises. As a result, the use of GIS faces difficulties in data acquisition and the integration of heterogeneous data, which requires governments, businesses, and academic institutions to jointly promote the formulation of relevant policies. At the technical level, spatial analysis methods for big data are in the ascendancy. Currently and for a long time in the future, the development of GIS should be strengthened to form a data-driven system for rapid knowledge acquisition, which signifies that GIS should be used to reinforce the social operation parameterization of models and methods, especially when providing support for social management.",

Methods to quickly and automatically extract the patient's 209 spatiotemporal trajectory from text data, establish the spatiotemporal 210 comparison method, find the potential spatiotemporal exposure link of 211 patients, support epidemiological investigation and rapid analysis, and 212 realize automatic detection of the cross-regional epidemic infection path 213 are major challenges for GIS. In this research, we 1) developed a recon-214 struction technology for the progress of the spatiotemporal events in 215 a patient's text track data that can automatically convert the track text 216 into quantitative spatiotemporal events; 2) established a spatiotemporal 217 events database with more than 70000 pieces of patient track text cov-218 ering the whole country; 3) constructed an exposure calculation model 219 and a patient-node-patient association model that integrates time, space 220 and text acquaintance, which showed the exposure assessment and site 221 risk assessment of each individual (the exposure analysis of a patient's 222 spatial trajectory is shown in Figure 5 .). Based on the above work, the 223 key epidemic transmission centers were located, including Baodi Mall in 224 Tianjin; Toulong Mall in Harbin, Heilongjiang; and Yintaishimao Mall 225 in Wenzhou, Zhejiang. Assessing the risk of epidemics and transmission in different regions 256 is of great significance for decision-making and the adjustment of pre-257 vention and control efforts. Considering that the epidemic outbreak cen-258 ter was in Wuhan, the correlation between the number of confirmed 259 cases in each province and the population flow from Wuhan to each 260 province was examined first. The research indicated that until 24:00 on 261 February 2, 2020, the severity of the epidemic in each province was 262 highly correlated with the population who travelled there from Wuhan 263 before the city of Wuhan was locked down, with a correlation coefficient 264 of 0.77. A risk assessment model was constructed with the spatial distri-265 bution of the number of confirmed cases and the population migration, 266 and three risk level areas were outlined on the regional scale and on the 267 urban scale for the cities with high risks of epidemics, including Bei-268 jing, Shenzhen, Guangzhou, Shanghai, Chongqing, Wenzhou, Zhuhai, 269 and control. We have integrated multiple datasets, such as provincial 305 epidemic data, online consumption data and postal service data, to an-306 alyze the supply-demand situation and price changes in necessities and 307 food, including vegetables and meat, for every province during the epi-308 demic prevention period, as well as the changing volume and trends of 309 postal and express delivery businesses in each region, to identify the 310 area, type, and transportation support capacity of the material shortage 311 risks. Through this, we provided scientific data for the social manage-312 ment departments to obtain the material supply-demand dynamic infor-313 mation in real time. Meanwhile, by tracking the transportation of ma-314 terials, we identified the highly sensitive nodes that may invoke virus 315 transmission during the transportation process and provided advance 316 warning and decision support for the prevention and control of the re-317 gional spread of the epidemic (the national distribution of risk index 318 is shown in Figure 9 .). Due to the involvement of company business 319 information involved in the data, there were many difficulties in the 320 acquisition process, which revealed that knowledge of how businesses 321 constrain data sharing will become an important research direction. At 322 present, JD.COM, SF Express, and other large domestic online shopping 323 and logistics companies have begun to establish GIS-based logistics mon-324 itoring systems. In the future, with the support of Internet of Things tech-325 nology, a national classified material transportation monitoring system 326 and a national data integration and analysis platform will be gradually 327 established, which will provide more accurate and timely information 328 on the material supply and transportation capacity during emergency 329 policy-making for the whole society. The magnitude and scale of population mobility are essential infor-332 mation for spatial transmission prediction, risk area division, and con-333 trol measure decision-making for infectious diseases ( Wang et al., 2019 ) . 334 Research has shown a strong relationship between the number of train 335 journeys and the number of COVID-19 cases . At the 336 beginning of the outbreak COVID-19 outbreak, especially before the clo-337 sure of Wuhan on January 23, 2020, more than five million people had 338 left Wuhan for other regions ( News China, 2020 ). A better understand-339 ing of the destinations of those people can assist in decision-making and 340 were mainly characterized by a small population inflow ( Figure 10 .).",

However, Figure 11 shows that pop-369 ulation mobility has increased since February 17 (the 24 th of the first 370 lunar month of 2020). The return of people to work will possibly in-371 crease the spread of COVID-19. Baidu migration data were utilized here 372 to predict the risk . We calculated the speed of the pop-373 ulation mobility recovery in each city (shown in Figure 12 When a major epidemic occurs, the negative impact of uncertainty 386 and panic on social operations may exceed that of the viral diseases. 387 Therefore, this research applied massive social media data to track and 388 evaluate the spatial spread of public sentiment ( Miller and Goodchild, 389 2015 ) . Considering that public behavior has the characteristics of irra-390 tionality, strong infectivity and conformity, we needed to build a knowl-391 dational information on public opinion to guide the government. 453 In assessing the contribution of GIS and spatial big data technology 454 to the containment of this epidemic, it is clear that many challenges 455 remain to be studied. For example, the status of big data source restric-456 tions in commercial enterprises may restrict the data supply needed for 457 social management, result in the lack of a mature scheme for big data 458 aggregation, and cause difficulty of rapid online application of deep in-459 tegration, which are ongoing issues. Regarding data-driven knowledge 460 acquisition, the uncertainty of social operations, especially with the high 461 spatial heterogeneity of responses to epidemic development throughout 462 the country, may lead to spatial deviations from the model simulation. 463 Strategies for a technical system of knowledge acquisition based on big 464 spatial data focused on social operations are an ongoing challenge. From 465 the aspect of research expression, the status results can be fully reflected, 466 while the multiscale dynamic presentation driven by big data is urgently 467 needed and promising. ",

By rapidly processing real-time public outbreak data in 34178    provinces and more than 300 prefecture-level cities, we implemented 179 a multiscale map matching database template. By making the thematic 180 map templates in advance, the rapid production and release of large-181 scale epidemic maps were realized. Several color schemes were designed182    to not only reflect thematic knowledge with the use of color but also to 183 provide more emotively intuitive information, such as a red-purple color 184 scheme for the COVID-19 cases, a blue-black color scheme for the cases 185 with mortality, and a yellow-green color scheme for cured cases. Daily186 animation maps were applied to express the spatiotemporal character-187 istics of the spread of the epidemic.

Based on the factors of 286 online hospital help information, local cases and forecasts, and existing 287 resource data, we analyzed the current dynamic situation of medical 288 protective equipment across the country through cross-validation and 289 sampling verification (phone inquiry and web inquiry) and attained the 290 following: 1) the prompt identification of a shortage of medical protec-291 tive equipment in 462 hospitals, including 336 in Hubei Province and 292 the rest in Sichuan, Anhui, Guangdong, Jiangsu and Hunan, among oth-293 ers; and 2) based on the number of confirmed cases, the number of hos-294 pitals that lacked sufficient medical protective equipment and the urban 295 population, the shortage of medical supplies was divided into four levels 296 on a regional scale and three levels on a city scale (the result for Hubei 297 Province is shown in Figure 7 , and the national result is shown in Figure 298 8 ).

This situation requires GIS 416 and big data technology to allow rapid responses and analyses, a quick 417 supply of information about the epidemic dynamics and an understand-418 ing of the epidemic development rules to provide timely support for the 419 prevention and control decisions and actions. 420 In this study, we analyzed the spatial phenomenon of the disease, 421 material, population and social psychology at three scales: individual, 422 group and regional. At the individual scale, the comparison between 423 spatial epidemic tracking and the spatiotemporal trajectories of patients 424 were carried out. At the group scale, the estimation of population flow 425 and the spatial distribution were carried out. At the regional scale, the 426 division of spatial risk, the analysis of balance between the supply and 427 demand of medical resources, and the spatial differentiation analysis of 428 material transportation capacity and social sentiment were carried out. 429 From the perspective of GIS technology, this study revolutionized the 430 data acquisition methods of traditional data from various departments 431 and achieved rapid data acquisition and integration by incorporating 432 big data. The analysis platform was quickly constructed through an in-433 novative construction technology system, which provided the technical 434 platform for timely epidemic analysis. The production of epidemic maps 435 was quickly completed through multiscale dynamic template technol-436 ogy, which allowed timely dissemination of epidemic dynamic informa-437 tion.

The calculation of the overlap between the spatial tracking of 442 the virus and that of patient trajectories was realized based on the ex-443 posure index of fused spatial and text information via text spatialization 444 technology. The estimation of population flow and spatial distribution 445 was realized via the combination of big data and traditional geographic 446 data, which identified the problems in the key risk areas and the spatial 447 mismatching of medical resources in a timely manner, to bring about a 448 rapid supply of information about the delimitation of prevention areas 449 and resource deployment in epidemic control.
