Antiviral effects of diammonium glycyrrhizinate (DG) have been reported on several animal viruses; however, to date it has yet to be tested on PPV. In this study, the antiviral activity of DG on swine testis (ST) cell infection by PPV was investigated using an empirically determined, non-toxic concentration of DG and three different experimental designs: (1) pre-treatment of virus prior to infection; (2) pre-treatment of cells prior to infection; and (3) direct treatment of virus-infected cells. The results showed that DG possesses potent inhibitory effects on PPV when the virus was treated before incubation with ST cells and that virus infectivity decreased in a dose-dependent manner. Results were confirmed by indirect immunofluorescence assays and real-time quantitative PCR. In addition, deoxycholate was used as a control to exclude the possibility that DG acted as a detergent to inhibit PPV infectivity. The study clearly indicates that DG has a direct anti-PPV effect in vitro.",

PPV strain PPV2010 was propagated in ST cells in the absence of serum and used for infection analyses [5, 19] .

Mock-treated cells containing no DG were used as negative controls. The cells were cultured at 37\u00b0C for 72 h, supplemented with 80 ll per well DMEM and 20 ll per well 0.5 % MTT solution and then incubated for an additional 4 h at 37\u00b0C. After washing with PBS, 150 ll of DMSO was added to each well. The plates were shaken gently for 15 min to dissolve the formazan precipitate, and the OD 570 was recorded. Cell survival rates were calculated from mean values according to the following equation: (OD 570 drug)/(OD 570 control) 9 100.

As example, dissimilar effects on viral replication were observed on cultured HIV isolates depending on whether or not the isolate was a syncytiuminducing variant. This difference was linked to the ability of glycyrrhizin to induce certain \u00df-chemokines in the cultured cells used to propagate the virus [20] . Glycyrrhizin inhibited early stage replication of HAV and the penetration of HAV into the plasma membrane in PLC/PRF/5 cells, an Alexander hepatoma cell line, but exhibited no virucidal or inhibitory effects on the adsorption of HAV [4] . In a guinea pigs model, one group found that intravenously administered glycyrrhizin bound to hepatocytes and modified the expression of HBV-related antigens on the hepatocytes and suppressed sialylation of HBsAg. This was proposed as one mechanism by which intravenously injected glycyrrhizin improves liver function resulting in occasional complete recovery from hepatitis [21] .",

            "text": "As noted above, the activities of DG on virus infection and replication are various; however, currently there are no reports on the effects of DG on PPV infection. Our studies showed that the maximum, non-toxic concentration of DG on ST cell viability and proliferation was experimentally determined to be 250 lg/ml as indicated in MTT assay and well below that observed in previous studies [9, 19] . At this concentration, there were no differences between DGtreated cells and mock-treated cells relative to cell morphology (data now shown). DOC was used at a non-toxic concentration of 31.25 lg/ml which was also determined experimentally. When cells were treated with DG prior to PPV infection, minimal anti-viral effects were observed; the cell survival rate was low at 36.6 % and slightly better than virus controls (26.3 %) but not significantly (P [ 0.05) (Fig. 1a) . Significant differences were, however, observed between the cell and virus control groups (P \\ 0.01). The effect of DG on PPV-infected cells indicated that DG also significantly reduced the infectivity of PPV where the cell survival rate was 74.8 % (Fig. 1b) . When PPV pre-treated with DG was used to infect ST cells, a significant decrease in infectivity was observed where the cell survival rate was 96.4 % (P \\ 0.01) relative to controls (Fig. 1c) . The results of this treatment regimen were confirmed by IFA. As shown in Fig. 2 , PPVinfected ST cells generated strong fluorescence signals by 48 h post-infection. In contrast, the fluorescence from ST cells infected with DG-treated PPV decreased in a dosedependent manner. Although the inhibitory effects of DG on PPV-infected cells were lower than those observed on the DG-pretreated virus, high cell survival rates are still important because under most circumstances the antiviral therapy will be used on animals which have been previously diagnosed as positive. Given the difference between the cells pretreated with DG and washed, versus the cells treated with DG postinfection with virus, it is possible that the DG internalized by the cells is functioning intracellularly to bind to and inactivate viral particles within the cells. Indeed, current research is being targeted at finding ways to bind DG to nanoparticles to help better internalize the drug and target specific cell types [17, 25] As such, the presence of DG may have a meaningful effect on the virus even after it has entered the cell. Our results clearly showed that DG deactivated PPV. The use of DOC excluded the possibility that the detergent characteristics of DG were the cause of non-specific, antiviral activity. Indeed, it has been reported recently that the oral bioavailability of glycyrrhizin could be improved by formulation of this drug in association with sodium DOC/phospholipid-mixed nanomicelles (SDC/PL-MMs) [9] . To further support the specific nature of the activity, when the PPV group was treated with DOC the fluorescence signal was not diminished; this observation was quantified by RT-PCR. The results showed that relative amplification of the PPV-derived NS1 gene decreased in a dose-dependent manner to a maximum of 92.3 % in the presence of 250 lg/ml DG and this coincided with a decrease in PPV infectivity (Fig. 3 ). Real-time PCR was performed at 24, 36, and 48 h post-PPV infection, and the results showed at all time points that DG treatment inhibited cell infection (data not shown) with maximum inhibition occurring at 48 h.",

This suggests that the activity of DG is more direct than indirect where contact with the virus is essential to prevent infectivity. This contrasts with hypotheses suggesting that DG interaction with cell-related factors such as viral receptors is critical for preventing infection. This also suggests that maintaining sufficiently high levels of DG will be necessary to prevent any progeny virus from infecting new cells and propagating the infection after a short latent period. This is important and beneficial as a therapeutic drug for PPV. This can be seen in Fig 1b where DG was used to directly treat virus-infected cells for an extended period of time (72 h) during which multiple rounds of virus replication would have occurred. Based on these observations, it becomes important to identify the mechanism of binding of DG to PPV as well as other viruses in order to advance development of newer, more effective therapies against viruses known to be affected by DG treatment. In conclusion, DG has negligible adverse effects on ST cells. Further, this study reveals that DG exhibits direct inhibition on PPV in vitro and may be considered an effective anti-PPV agent.",

Experiments were conducted to assess the effects of changing the order of DG treatment on virus infectivity and, therefore, cell viability. Each of the 3 separate experiments (a, b, and c) consisted of non-DG-treated cells (cell control), cells or virus treated with DG (DG-treated), and non-DG-treated virus (virus control) where the order of DG treatment was varied. All DG treatments were performed with 250 lg/ml DG and porcine parvovirus (PPV) [100 TCID50]. Cell viability was measured using MTT assays. Data were graphed as relative cell viabilities [(OD 570 drug)/(OD 570 virus control)] for each treatment group. t tests were performed by SPSS software; asterisk means P \\ 0.01 relative to non-drug-treated virus control. All experiments were performed in triplicate. a ST cells treated with DG prior to incubation with PPV; b ST cells treated with DG following incubation with PPV; c ST cells infected with PPV pre-treated with DG",
