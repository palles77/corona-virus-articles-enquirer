Others prefer to perform a mesenteric lymphatic dye study similar to what is described for lymphangiography, but using new methylene blue dye rather than radiographic contrast material. This dye is visible at the time of surgery to ease identification. -A postoperative contrast lymphangiogram may be performed through the same mesenteric lymphatic catheter to assess the success of the ligation. A thoracostomy tube is placed postoperatively and removed once the fluid production through the tube falls below 1 ml/kg daily. -There is current debate whether this procedure is useful in idiopathic lymphangiectasia, or whether the lymphatic hypertension continues despite ligation. -Pleuroperitoneal drainage, either with passive drains with diaphragmatic mesh implants, or active sump drains between the pleural and peritoneal cavities have been described, but there is a lack of data on the outcomes of these procedures in cats. Blockage of the drain is a problem. -Some surgeons report success with pericardectomy, as a means to decrease the underlying lymphatic hypertension.
