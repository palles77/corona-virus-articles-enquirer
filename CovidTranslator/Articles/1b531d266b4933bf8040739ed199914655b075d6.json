However, an estimated 5 million 48 individuals had already left Wuhan for the holiday or travelling, some of which rushed 49 out after the lockdown announcement (5). In addition, the novel coronavirus is 50 infectious during the incubation period and when the symptoms are not obvious, 51 which is likely to make the huge floating population potential sources of infection (6). 52 Therefore, it is reasonable to hypothesize that the population transported from Wuhan 53 may have a significant impact on the potential outbreaks in other parts of China. 54 Recent studies on the novel coronavirus pneumonia focused more on its etiology (7, 55 8), transmission route (9, 10), and epidemiological characteristics (11, 12), there is 56 still a lack of investigating the relationship between the migrating population and the 57 outbreak, which is of great importance for making intervention policies.

The overall trend of 2019-nCoV cases is upward. 141 mainland China reported the occurrence of 2019-nCoV infection, of which 144 the number of reported cases from January 20 to 29 increased rapidly from 7 to 313, 145 an increase of nearly 44 times. Among the cities, 97 of them belong to the regions 146 with high population exodus out of Wuhan, and 7138 cases have been reported, 147 accounting for 83\u00b723% of the total reported cases outside Wuhan (appendix). 148 Population outflow of Wuhan could be divided into four periods based on the 149 migration data of Baidu (figure 1 and 2). In the first stage from Jan 1 to Jan10, 150 migrant population flowed out of Wuhan normally and returned to hometown without 151 the influence of the epidemic situation. At this point, the mean daily index of 152 population outflow was 58039\u00b771 (95% CI: 48883\u00b738-66454\u00b700), and 2019-nCoV 153 cases were mainly distributed in Wuhan. From beginning of Spring Festival travel 154 rush on Jan 10 and announcement of 2019-nCoV infection, the mean index of 155 population outflow rose to 66777\u00b798 (95% CI: 61125\u00b790-72962\u00b778), which increased 156 by 15\u00b71% compared with the previous period. Meanwhile, 2019-nCoV cases 157 gradually appeared in Wuhan and several nearby cities. The third period was from 158 January 20 to 23 when Academician Nanshan Zhong disclosed the human-to-human 159 transmission and a large number of Wuhan residents fled from Wuhan with increasing 160 panic. The corresponding mean index of population outflow of this period surged to 161 112385\u00b788 (95% CI: 107367\u00b744-118403\u00b721), which increased by 93\u00b76% comparing to 162 the earlier period. Thereafter, a strict city closure policy was implemented to prohibit 163 91\u00b78% comparing with the third period and the effective controlling of the 166 outflow population prevented suspected cases from spreading to the whole country, 167 however, 2019-nCoV cases has been widely dispersed in all of 31 provinces. 168 We applied scatter diagram to demonstrate the association between the number 169 of 2019-nCoV cases and index of outflow population at the scales of province and city. 170 In general, at the scale of province (figure 3), outflow population from Wuhan was 171 mainly distributed in Henan, Hunan, Guangdong, Anhui, Zhejiang, etc. And the top 172 four provinces with the most serious epidemic were Zhejiang, Guangdong, Henan, 173 and Hunan provinces. Therefore, we could observe that there were more 2019-nCoV 174 cases in the provinces with higher index of outflow population. Nevertheless, the two 175 provinces of Zhejiang and Guangdong with relatively lower index of outflow 176 population had more 2019-nCoV cases compared with Henan and Hunan provinces. 177 In Henan, the index of outflow population was about 50000, while there were fewer 178 than 450 cases, which might be lower than expected. In contrast, about 600 confirmed 179 cases were observed in Zhejiang, which had only one fifth of outflow population of 180 Henan. Similar results were obtained using the number cases per unit outflow 181 population (appendix). The mean value of the number of 2019-nCoV cases per unit 182 outflow population across the whole country was 129\u00b772, however, the value in 183 Zhejiang province was more than 450 and the corresponding result in Henan was 184 lower than average. 185 etc. Overall, the association between the number of 2019-nCoV cases and 188 index of outflow population at the city-level was in line with that at the provincial 189 level, which both showed that the cities with more index of outflow population would 190 trigger more cases. Similarly, we observed some cities deviated from the general trend 191 including Wenzhou, Taizhou, Xuchang, Luoyang, and Guiyang. For instance, the 192 index of outflow population of Wenzhou and Luoyang was close to identical level, 193 whereas there was tremendous difference in the number of 2019-nCoV cases in the 194 two cities. From the city of Taizhou and Xuchang, we could obtain the analogous 195 results. 196 To evaluate the effect of the city closure on the infection transmission one and 197 two days in advance, we used the index of population outflow of January 21-23, 2020 198 when the Wuhan was still open and index of population outflow of January 24-31, 199 2020 when the city closure policy had been implemented, and the calculations gave 200 the reduced index of population outflow: 102206\u00b769 for city closure one day in 201 advance and 211429\u00b760 for city closure two days in advance. In addition, we obtained 202 the reduced index of population outflow of each other province and correspondingly 203 reduced 2019-nCoV cases. Finally, about 687 and 1420 2019-nCoV cases would be 204 avoided with implementing city closure policy one and two days in advance(table 1). 205Consistently, if city closure policy of Wuhan was delayed by one or two days, there 206 would be 722 or 1462 extra 2019-nCoV cases respectively. 207",

Our results revealed a 231 close relationship between the population outflow from Wuhan and the 2019-nCoV 232 infection in other areas of China. We assessed the contributions of the lockdown and 233 explored the potential effects of the measure with different implementation dates. 234 The fluctuation of outflowing population of Wuhan indicated that the lockdown 235 in Wuhan reduced the outward movement of the population effectively. However, the 236 population outflows and cases varied across provinces. Our 240 finding on the effects of population movement on the disease transmission was 241 consistent with other coronaviruses (16-18). Since the infection is transmitted through 242 the respiratory tract and close contact, it is greatly affected by population movements. 243 Firstly, a great number of people flowing out of Wuhan may transmit the virus to the 244 whole country and even worldwide during the Chinese Spring Festival. Secondly, the 245 absence of detectable symptoms during the long incubation period made it difficult to 246 identify the cases in the early stage (13, 19). Thirdly, population movements increase 247 the difficulty of case management and health education. All these factors promoted 248 the transmission of 2019-nCoV. Specially, different from the H1N1 outbreak in 2009 249 (20), the railways might play an important role in the disease transmission. Since 250 railways were widely used before and during the Spring Festival, the area closely 251 connected to Wuhan by railway should be the priority of infection control. 252",

Take Henan for example, great difference between estimated and reported data 263 may imply a great increase of cases in the future, which required enhancement of the 264 surveillance system and rational allocation of resources (18). The medicine supply, 265 personal protective equipment, hospital supplies, and the human resources necessary 266to respond to an outbreak should be always ensured (23). In addition, this study could 267 be used to guide the assessment of the risk of disease transmission and help raise 268public awareness. As a large number of infected people had transported to all of 31 269 provinces, epidemics across the country may be inevitable. To halt the spread of the 270 epidemic, harsh measures including quarantine and isolation of exposed persons, 271 cancellation of mass gatherings, school closures, and travel restriction were needed to 272 reduce transmission in affected areas. Furthermore, screening of people who have 273 been to Wuhan recently was of crucial importance, especially cities with close ties to 274 Wuhan. 275 Considering the impact of population movements on the outbreak, the Wuhan 276 government announced the suspension of public transportation on Jan 23, 2020, with 277 a closure of airports, railway stations, and highways, to prevent further disease 278 transmission (24).
