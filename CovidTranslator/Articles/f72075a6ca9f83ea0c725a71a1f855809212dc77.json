When compared with fluent English speakers, communication problems contribute to adverse events at a higher rate for patients with limited English proficiency. 5 These patients have lower rates of preventive screening and services and higher rates of hospitalization and drug complications. 6 Additionally, language barriers are associated with lower patient satisfaction and a lower rate of adherence to medication regimens. [7] [8] [9] Given the high stakes of medical interpretation and its inherent difficulties of accurately conveying meaning across language and culture, using a trained interpreter is essential. One study compared trained interpreters to ad hoc interpreters (ie, family members, hospital staff, untrained volunteers, and friends) and found significant higher error rates among ad hoc interpreters. 10 In particular, using family members is problematic when it comes to discussing sensitive topics. Moreover, Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Department of Health and Human Services mandate the provision of competent interpreters in all health care settings. 11 Having a face-to-face interpreter is ideal but medical telephonic services are widely available, cheaper, and easier to coordinate without scheduling ahead of time.",

One of the primary purposes of the evaluation is to \"prevent the importation of infectious diseases and other conditions of public health significance. 2 \" Screening for infectious tuberculosis (TB) is the major focus and, if found, the immigrant must be adequately treated with directly observed therapy before a waiver to fly is granted. Other inadmissible conditions include gonorrhea, Hansen disease, syphilis, chancroid, granuloma inguinale, and lymphogranuloma venereum. More recently, severe acute respiratory syndrome, viral hemorrhagic fever, and avian influenza, and Ebola, among others, have been added to the list of quarantinable conditions. In reality, very few refugees have been denied entry due to a medical condition (0.4%) and, of those, almost all had untreated infectious TB (93%). 12 Importantly, as of 2010, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) testing is no longer performed as part of the overseas evaluation and the HIV status is often unknown at the time of arrival. 13 In most cases, refugees are exposed to harsh living conditions with inadequate health care, sanitation, and access to safe water. Due to their increased risk, the CDC recommends presumptive treatment of parasitic infections for many groups. For example, sub-Saharan Africans living in endemic countries receive artemisininbased combination therapy directed at Plasmodium falciparum malaria before departure. 14 Many refugees also are administered presumptive antihelminthic agents directed at Strongyloides stercoralis and Schistosoma species, both of which can persist subclinically for years after immigration and lead to complications. 15 Age-appropriate vaccinations, such as measles-mumps-rubella, tetanus, and pertussis, are required of refugees, the same as for persons born in the United States. There is an effort overseas to provide as many of the vaccines that are available, even though refugees are technically not required to have any before their departure. 16 However, in order to apply for a green card at 1 year after arrival, refugees must complete all vaccination series (except human papillomavirus vaccine, zoster vaccine, and the new 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine). In the cases of hepatitis A and varicella, demonstrating serologic evidence of immunity before vaccination is costeffective. 16 Hepatitis B virus (HBV) testing should also be done before vaccinating to identify those with current infection.",

Ideally, this should occur soon after arrival and includes rescreening for TB, mental health screening, and testing for HBV, anemia, and sexually transmitted infections such as HIV, syphilis, chlamydia, and gonorrhea. It should also confirm, either through the overseas documentation or testing, that the appropriate presumptive anthelminthic therapies were administered. Finally, this evaluation is meant to identify chronic diseases such as diabetes and hypertension and update vaccinations. In many regions of the United States, the local health departments have assumed the responsibility for following-up newly arrived persons with TB within 30 days. However, for non-TB conditions, there is a wide range of models at the state and county levels, and many parts of the country rely on primary care physicians to perform the domestic evaluation. In reality, it is likely that a large proportion of refugees do not receive the recommended evaluation. 17 Even for TB, the actual rates of follow-up after arrival ranged from zero (Montana) to 100% (Delaware) with a median rate of 75% in 2009. 12 Unless there is clear documentation of prior screening and treatment, primary care providers may consider a conservative approach and not assume that any part of the domestic evaluation was previously performed. In the authors' experience, relying on the patient's memory of prior treatments can be fraught with recall errors and the authors tend to err on the side of retesting, even years after immigration. The following discussion is a brief overview of infections with a long latency period that may be less familiar to North American providers: TB, parasites, and HBV. More detailed instructions of diagnosis and treatment can found at the CDC website: http://www. cdc.gov/immigrantrefugeehealth/guidelines/domestic/domestic-guidelines.html.",

The evaluation starts with eliciting symptoms of active TB, such as a cough, fever, hemoptysis, weight loss, and night sweats, usually of several weeks or months duration. If negative, the clinician should proceed to screen for latent TB infection with a tuberculin skin test or interferongamma release assay followed by a 2-view chest radiograph. All patients diagnosed with TB must have their HIV status evaluated. The decision to offer treatment of latent TB infection is based on weighing the risks of reactivation with the risks of treatment. Estimates of these risks can be found using an online calculator, such as www.tstin3d. com from McGill University. Ample time for a clear discussion of the risks and benefits of treatment is important, as well as a 1-month follow-up appointment to check for medication side effects and to confirm an understanding of the pharmacy refill process.",

This unique property of autoinfection allows Strongyloides to persist indefinitely in the human carrier even in the absence of recurrent exposure. The dreaded complication is hyperinfection, which is a process of massive dissemination of Strongyloides larvae and presents dramatically with gram-negative sepsis and carries a high mortality rate. Those who become immunosuppressed (eg, high-dose corticosteroid therapy) are at the greatest risk even many years after leaving the endemic area. Standard stool examination is insensitive for detection (<50% sensitivity). 19 Therefore, all refugees and immigrants from endemic areas should either receive empiric treatment or be screened with serology. Schistosomiasis is extremely prevalent with an estimated 200 million infected persons worldwide. 20 Chronic disease is caused by the host's immune response to migration and entrapment of eggs through tissues, thereby causing inflammation and fibrosis. 21 Infection with S mansoni, S japonicum, and S mekongi typically results in egg deposition in microvasculature of the liver or intestines, causing hepatomegaly, portal hypertension, and polyposis of the small and large bowels. The classic manifestation of S haematobium is within the genitourinary tract and is a major risk factor for renal disease and bladder carcinoma. Diagnostic screening is indicated for individuals from endemic regions, even in the absence of symptoms. Screening tools include serology and stool studies.

Even for inactive carrier state, life-long serial monitoring for liver function and screening for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are necessary. HBV infection is distinct from other hepatitides such as hepatitis C virus infection in that it can lead to the development of HCC in the absence of cirrhosis.

Many accept minimal wage jobs and, from what little earnings they receive, are expected to send a proportion to family members abroad. The stress of day-to-day survival is compounded because many continue to bear the chronic pains of past physical and psychological injuries.

The Amnesty International Report of 2012 found torture and ill treatment in 112 countries, including most countries from which the United States receives refugees. 43 Prevalence of torture varies widely by the population studied; however, a meta-analysis including 42,626 refugees and other conflict-affected groups showed an overall prevalence of 21%. 29 A study of 1134 Somali and Oromo refugees living in the United States showed a prevalence of 44%. 28 Another report found that 56% of Iraqi refugees had been tortured. 44 The psychological and physical impact of torture can be long lasting. Mental health disorders occur frequently in survivors of torture, with rates as high as 81.1% with clinically significant anxiety, 84.5% with clinically significant depression, and 45.7% with symptoms of PTSD. 45 Chronic pain is extremely common. One study reported that 78% reported persistent multiple pains, mainly in the head and low back. 46 Falanga, or beating the soles of the feet, can result in subcutaneous fibrosis or compartment syndrome in the feet, as well as severe pain lasting for years. Sexual dysfunction and chronic pain are common sequelae of genital torture and female genital cutting. Head trauma can result in traumatic brain injury with effects on memory, attention, and behavior. 47 Clinicians should have a high degree of suspicion for a history of torture in refugees, particularly those with symptoms of depression, anxiety, PTSD, or those with chronic physical complaints. The topic should be broached gently to prevent patients from feeling interrogated. Often, a history of torture is revealed over several visits, sometimes over the course of years, as a patient becomes comfortable with their physician. Awareness of a torture history can help prevent traumatization because tests such as phlebotomy, electrocardiograms, gynecologic examinations, and imaging studies may have the unintended effect of triggering negative memories from the past. Asking about a patient's history of torture is also important so that providers can support their process of self-healing. Moreover, it serves as a reminder for us as health providers to remain patient and compassionate while providing necessary medical care.",

For example, the palpitations produced by anxiety can be thought of as a weak heart in China and the resulting fear of cardiac arrest or infarction can predispose the sufferer to be hypervigilant of any cardiac symptom. Among Cambodian patients, symptoms of anxiety and PTSD can present as a sore neck and fear of death due to rupture of the neck vessels can lead patients report any symptom involving the head and neck, including headache, dizziness, and tinnitus. 49 Although chronic pain is often attributed to somatization, organic causes such as osteoarthritis, rheumatologic disorders, and osteomalacia must not be overlooked. When compared with other immigrants, refugees are more likely to have arthritis and activity-limitation due to pain. 50 Treatment of chronic pain and somatization should include evaluation for coexisting mental health disorders and a history of trauma, including torture (Video 1; available online at http://www.medical.theclinics. com/). Current social stressors can be a contributor to somatization and should be addressed. 51 Explaining the limitations of allopathic medicine can help in negotiating what constitutes an appropriate workup of pain complaints, such as in the patients who request multiple tests or procedures. Treatment modalities include acupuncture, trigger point injection, therapeutic massage, antidepressant medications, cognitive behavioral therapy, and relaxation techniques.

The desire to control hypertension will likely be met with some obstacles, whether it is other health conditions, financial issues, or competing life stressors. This will be balanced by respect for the provider and the belief that controlled blood pressure will be of benefit.
