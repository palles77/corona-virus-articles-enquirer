We compiled a representative data set of viruses that infect hosts ranging from bacteria to humans. We consider their respective amino acid and codon usages and compare them among the viruses and their hosts. We show that bacteriainfecting viruses are strongly adapted to their specific hosts, but that they differ from other unrelated bacterial hosts. Viruses that infect humans, but not those that infect other mammals or aves, show a strong resemblance to most mammalian and avian hosts, in terms of both amino acid and codon preferences. In groups of viruses that infect humans or other mammals, the highest observed level of adaptation of viral proteins to host codon usages is for those proteins that appear abundantly in the virion. In contrast, proteins that are known to participate in host-specific recognition do not necessarily adapt to their respective hosts. The implication for the potential of viral infectivity is discussed.",

Some viruses infect a broad range of species, whereas others infect only a single host. A successful viral infection requires that the virus possess the capability to enter the host cell and take over cellular functions and direct them toward the efficient production of new viruses. Most viruses recognize their respective hosts through membrane receptors that have a role in host physiology. Examples of such receptors are gangliosides, heparan sulfate moieties, and integrins (Garrigues et al, 2008) , which act as the cell receptors for simian virus 40 (SV40), human cytomegalovirus (HHV-5), and human herpesvirus 8 (HHV8), respectively. In stark contrast, for some viruses, host range is not limited to the recognition stage (McFadden, 2005) . For example, poxviruses bind to and enter a wide range of mammalian cells, but a fruitful replication cycle occurs only in a restricted set of hosts. Replication of poxviruses involves the host cell cycle, signal transduction, transcription factors, phosphatases, and interferon-induced mediators. Therefore, the features that govern the host range for poxvirus seem to involve a rich collection of host genes (McFadden, 2005) .",

The frequencies with which different codons are used vary significantly between organisms and between proteins within the same organism (Akashi, 2001) . Many studies have focused on the bias in codon usage among species. In single cell organisms (prokaryotes, archaea, and some fungi), the codon usage is strongly tuned for highly expressed genes and was thus concluded to be optimized for translational efficiency (Sharp et al, 1988) . However, the main trends in multicellular organism codon usage were attributed to the isochore-dependent genome composition (GC) content, gene architecture, and chromosomal locations (see discussion in Costantini et al, 2009) . Still, evidence for codon usage bias toward highly expressed genes and its correlation to tRNA abundance argues that translational efficiency does have a role for some plant, fly, and worm proteomes (Duret, 2000 and references within) . Evolutionary forces and multiple molecular processes (e.g., unbiased gene conversion, mutation rates, and genetic drift) have also participated in shaping codon usage in higher eukaryotes (Bernardi, 1986; Duret, 2002) . The molecular determinants that have globally influenced the translational efficiency in Escherichia coli (Kudla et al, 2009) and the evolution of polymerase genes in the influenza A virus (Brower-Sinning et al, 2009) indicate that, in addition to GC content, RNA folding processes also affect the adaptability and translational capacity of viral sequences.",

In a recent study that tested the codon usage adaptation for over 100 bacteriophages infecting 10 different bacterial hosts, it was shown that the bacteriophage genomes are under codon-selective pressure imposed by the translational biases of their respective hosts (Carbone, 2008) .

            "text": "In viruses infecting multicellular animals, such translational biases may lead to increased virion production rates within the infected cell and reduce the accessibility of viruses to the immune response of the host (Bonhoeffer and Nowak, 1994) . However, to the best of our knowledge, the analysis of codon biases of eukaryotic (alongside prokaryotic) viruses compared with their hosts has yet to be undertaken on a large scale. However, related phenomena have been described. Specifically, the codon usage bias in the poxviridae family (dsDNA viruses) was determined by measuring the effective number of codons in the viral proteome. Neither the expression level nor the gene size was shown to be a determinant of the measured codon usage biases. Nonetheless, for most poxviruses, the codon usage was close to the value predicted based on the GC content (Barrett et al, 2006) . Similar results were shown for coronavirus (Gu et al, 2004) and other vertebrate-infecting DNA viruses (Shackelton et al, 2006) . In papillomavirus, the codon bias was attributed to the AT content rather than to host specificity (Zhao et al, 2003) . In the case of retroviruses, it was shown that strong discrimination against CpG sequences directly shapes the codon usage and, as a result, even indirectly restricts the choice of amino acids (Berkhout et al, 2002) . Thus, in general, GC and, specifically, the GC content were thus far found to be the major determinants of codon usage in vertebrate DNA viruses (Shackelton et al, 2006) . It has been found that for many viruses, genome-wide mutational pressures override the selection for specific codons (Jenkins and Holmes, 2003) . Studies of the evolutionary history of viral adaptation propose a cross talk between codon usage, replication mode, genome size, and host range (Koonin et al, 2006) . Furthermore, the observation that there exist both eukaryotic viruses that have adapted their codon usage toward their hosts and those that show little evidence for such adaptation recently prompted the hypothesis that this simply reflects the limited time of the latter for optimization toward their hosts (Barrai et al, 2008) . A contrary view would suggest that the extremely high mutation rates in viruses (especially in RNA viruses) outpace the evolutionary processes of selection that drive such optimization of the virus to the host.",

To this end, we provide a strict virus-to-host mapping using a non-redundant set of representative viruses and hosts, ranging from human to bacteria. We develop a statistical framework for the unbiased assessment of the mutual pairwise distances between all viruses and all recognized hosts. To test the hypothesis of general molecular adaptation of a virus toward its hosts, we focus on codon usage and amino acid preferences within groups of viruses that are unified at varying taxonomical granularities. We observe that all bacteriophages are strongly tuned to match their unique hosts and this correspondence is also evident in their GC contents. However, somewhat surprisingly, viruses that infect humans resemble all mammalian hosts equally, and this similarity even extends to aves and several insects. This observation does not hold for viruses of other mammals, despite a strong similarity among the codon usages of most mammals. Finally, we show that viral selection of codon usage toward that of the host has not occurred uniformly for all proteins of the virus, but it is mainly dominated by the set of proteins expressed in high abundance. The implications of these observations for viral evolution and on the potential for zoonotic epidemics are discussed.",

These factors impose an inherent difficulty in the classification of viruses into taxonomical groupings. Currently, B10% of all sequences in the UniProtKB database (Boutet et al, 2007) (release 14.6) are viral proteins (718 000 proteins). Actually, full-length proteins account for only a third of these, and, following the elimination of sequence redundancy (at the level of 90% identity), the number of proteins is reduced to only B10% of the original number (72 992 proteins) (Figure 1 ). In addition, the low fraction of these proteins that are manually reviewed (based on the SwissProt database) results in only 1% of the initial collection (7416 proteins). Furthermore, the relevance of specific virus families to human health has led to a strong bias in the quality and reliability of genome annotation. The majority of viral sequences in the public databases are derived from only a few viral families, whereas most families remain poorly represented. This point is illustrated for the HIV, which makes up 36% of all viral protein entries ( Figure 1 ). Half of all viral proteins are either from the HIV or hepatitis (Hepadnaviridae) viruses, two families with an indisputable impact on human health. An additional source of bias in analyzing the viral world stems from data that originate from incomplete genomes. The UniProtKB annotation of 'complete proteome' covers only 0.5% of all viral sequences.",

All viruses are classified by their taxonomical order as well as by the accepted index that divides them into seven classes (Baltimore index I-VII), based on their genetic material and mode of replication. One hundred twentyone human-infecting viruses that belong to 50 genera are currently known (Supplementary Table S1 ). The uneven partition for human-infecting viruses among the seven classes is shown ( Figure 1B ). Class I (dsDNA) and class V (ssRNA(\u00c0)) account for 70% of the proteins, but all other classes are also represented among human viruses. By considering all proteins that are known from UniProtKB (a unification of SwissProt and TrEMBL), only 25% of the relevant proteomes are included in classes I and V, whereas the dominating class in terms of the quantity of protein sequences is class VI (ssRNA (RT), including HIV). Proteins belonging to class IV account for B50% of the proteins of human-infecting viruses (total B568 000).

An example of such an uncommon case is the Iridoviridae family (dsDNA viruses), which infects frog, snakes, insects, and fish.

To this end, we compiled an exhaustive representative set (see Materials and methods) and applied the virus-to-host mapping at a high taxonomical level ( Figure 2 , level C). To start with, we focused on two taxonomical groups: mammals (subdivided into human and nonhuman hosts) and bacteria. This analysis is based on 481 779 and 312 201 amino acids from the respective virus groups. The proteomes of virus representatives that infect humans and those that infect bacteria (bacteriophages) are compared ( Figure 3A ). It is evident that some amino acids Figure 2 Mapping of viruses to hosts. (Top) a tree is drawn according to the hierarchical taxonomy of the hosts (from class to genus, based on NCBI taxonomy). The hosts that are unified at the suborder level are framed with an identical color. The four levels (A-D) represent the host grouping at the genus, suborder, order, and class levels, respectively. Below each host, the viruses that infect it are listed. (Bottom) for each taxonomy level, the virus-to-host mapping resulting from the tree is shown. Ambiguity in mapping of viruses to their hosts results from viruses that are annotated to infect a group of hosts that are not uniquely defined at the taxonomical level of interest (e.g., V5 not uniquely defined at level B strongly deviate between these two groups. For example, arginine (R) is more prevalent in the viruses of humans (Po10 \u00c06 , t-test with Bonferroni correction), whereas lysine (K) appears more in bacterial proteomes (Po10 \u00c06 ). A similar trend is seen for isoleucine (I, Po10 \u00c06 ) and leucine (L, Po10 \u00c06 ). The source and biological significance of such differences are under study and beyond the scope of this study. Similarly, we measured the codon usage for each of the 59 codons that code for 1 of the 18 degenerately encoded amino acids (tryptophan and methionine are encoded by only a single codon). As an illustration, we show the codon preferences for arginine (R, 6 codons) and leucine (L, 6 codons), as measured for human-infecting and mammalian (excluding human) virus groups ( Figure 3B ).

As a control experiment, a comparison of the GC content between viruses and their cognate hosts shows that viruses have an overall weak, but significant (R 2 \u00bc0.575, Po10 \u00c05 ), correlation with their host GC content ( Figure 6A ). In fact, for bacteria, the partition by host GC content provides a very strong linear association ( Figure 6A , blue points, R 2 \u00bc0.927, Po10 \u00c05 ). However, no significant associations are found between the GC contents of viruses and their hosts for other taxonomic groups. For example, for the 11 mammals analyzed in this study, the correlation was extremely poor (R 2 \u00bc0.065). This can be explained by the fact that although the GC content in mammal-infecting viruses ranges between 35 and 56%, the GC content of the proteomes of the mammal hosts studied (Supplementary Table S3 ) is rather narrow (50-53%). Thus, we conclude that the correlation between the GC contents of the viruses and their hosts ( Figure 6A ) is dominated by the bacteriophages matching their unique bacteria.",

The adaptation among the bacterial set is very prominent, especially in light of the extreme differences among the different bacterial hosts themselves ( Figure 5B ; Supplementary information S1). In fact, each bacterial virus shows a very different pattern relative to all other bacterial viruses. In addition, significant levels of resemblance are evident among the different plant viruses and their hosts. However, the strongest signal observed is the resemblance of human viruses to all mammalian hosts; at the same time, these viruses remain rather different from any of the other mammalian viruses ( Figure 5A ). Furthermore, the strong similarity of the codon usage of human viruses to all 11 mammalian hosts reaches substantially farther into the taxonomic realm, approaching the insect and bird host species as well (Supplementary Table S3 ). Interestingly, the viruses that actually infect birds do not show strong adaptation to their hosts (based on viruses that infect chickens). We have shown that human viruses show an unexpected similarity to a broad range of host taxonomical groups, including mammals, avians, most insects, and some plants. Among all tested mammals, only human and rat viruses share strong resemblance in their codon usage profiles. However, owing to the relatively weak support for rat-infecting viruses (i.e., few proteins, narrower virus representatives), we will focus only on the adaptation of human viruses.",

Clearly, our analyses are strongly dependent on the correct mapping of viruses to their hosts. We analyzed 122 viruses at the higher taxonomical levels and 64 viruses at the host-species level, where each such virus represents a different viral genus (Table I; Supplementary Table S2 ). By the strict mapping of a set of 30 virus genera that exclusively infect 30 different hosts, we limited the set of viruses and often remained with only one or very few representatives for a unique host. It is possible that the set of viruses that have a restricted range of hosts is skewed. They may reflect (i) poorly studied cases, which leads to partial information regarding the virus and its hosts; and (ii) cases where the dependency on virus-host pair is stronger because of a specific molecular barrier that restricts the host range. We cannot separate these two instances, but for many cases the restricted host assignment is supported by a large body of literature. For example, the observed overwhelming similarity in amino acid distributions and in the codon usage among viruses infecting the tomato, lettuce, rice, and arabidopsis plants ( Figure 4 ) seems more likely to be a result of incomplete annotation in the viral database, where each of these viruses overlap and, in reality, infect the other plants but are simply not yet annotated as such. This is in accord with the current view of plant-infecting viruses (Roossinck, 1997) . Although the statistical power for some analyses may be affected by this 'reduction to representatives,' we argue that the trends observed in this study hold and will be further substantiated when additional viruses with accurate annotations become available. We analyzed a representative set of viruses irrespective of their mode of replication according to a partition to the 7 standard classes (Melnick, 1972) that are indicated by I-VII. Note that host specificity does not determine the class. For example, although most viruses that infect humans (Supplementary Table S1 ) belong to class I, human-infecting viruses are represented in all other classes, including the well-known health-threatening viruses, such as the Coronavirus family (SARS, class IV), Lentivirus (AIDS virus, class VI), and Ebola virus (class V). The genomic structures, nucleotide composition, replicative mode, replication time, and rates of mutation in the different classes are estimated to show great differences, where, for example, RNA viruses mutate much faster than other groups. Despite these differences, the analysis of humaninfecting viruses based on this classification showed that the observed adaptation of human viruses characterizes viruses from a broad range of life cycles and replication modes.",

More likely explanations may be related to the recent expansion of humans and the co-evolution of their viruses, or to the hypothesis that large portions of the human genome are actually of viral origin (Kazazian, 2004) . A high similarity was reported earlier between the codon usage of bacteriophages and their hosts (Lucks et al, 2008) . In that study, the authors analyzed a large set of bacteriophages and isolated the effect of the GC (i.e., GC content) and the adaptation of specific viral codons toward the primary bacterial host. Interestingly, for about 40% of the viruses, host-preferred codons were selected, which suggests that adaptation toward the host has a strong role in viral evolution. In addition, they found that structural proteins show maximal similarity toward the host-preferred codon, in accordance with our finding regarding the high degree of adaptation for highly abundant proteins ( Figure 7C ).",

Similarity in codon usage in different viruses can somewhat be explained by the occurrence of lateral gene transfer (LGT) and other modes of genetic material exchange. Accordingly, recent recombination events between the host and the virus may leave behind similar codon frequencies. Yet we do not believe this phenomenon to be a major determinant in codon usage adaptation as (i) it is unlikely that the codon usage of some functional groups but not of the entire proteome will show differences in the patterns observed ( Figure 7C ); (ii) there is no evidence that among the mammals we tested here some are more likely to be affected by LGT than others, yet human viruses show a significantly different pattern than other mammals; (iii) different classes of viruses (class I-VII) have similar adaptation trends, despite substantial differences in the potential for the exchange of genetic material with the host in RNA and DNA viruses. Thus, although it is unlikely that LGT dominates the observed resemblance of codon usage between eukaryotic viruses and their hosts, this does not hold for bacteria and archaea, which are exposed to high frequencies of LGT events.",

In the case of human viruses, we can see that highly expressed genes in different viruses that infect the same host preferentially use codons similar to that of humans and of each other ( Figure 7C ). On the other hand, the surface proteins that participate in recognition are often expressed in lower quantities displaying a rather low adaptation level toward their hosts (marked 'R'). A complementary explanation may rely on the positive selection paradigm that was proposed in virus-host recognition (Sawyer et al, 2005) . The enzymes (marked 'EC'), which are generally expressed in minute amounts, show only an intermediate codon usage similarity. Thus, overall, these results further strengthen the case for translational selection. Note that earlier studies did not find evidence for translational selection operating on mammalian genes (see discussion in (dos Reis and Wernisch, 2009; Semon et al, 2006 #544 ) and references within). It may be possible that such selection does exist, but these phenomena are weak because of the low effective mammalian population sizes. On the other hand, viruses affecting mammals have larger effective population sizes and a shorter generation time (dos Reis and Wernisch, 2009) . Thus, similar analysis to that performed here may be able to identify translational selection in genomes in which it was impossible to do so earlier.",

Such a shift occurs through a genetic adaptation process that overcomes the hurdles of viral entry and replication in a new cellular environment. FX174 bacteriophage, which normally grows on E. coli, was switched to infect Salmonella, where this shift was attributed to only a very few mutations (2-3) in the major capsid gene (Crill et al, 2000) . This phenomenon is not unique to bacterial viruses, as this has occurred in canine parvovirus, which appeared in the late 1970s as a variant of a feline parvovirus. The host shift was attributed to only two to three substitutions (Truyen et al, 1995) . A shift in host recognition was also shown in the case of HIV-1, where a single mutation in the envelope gene was sufficient to alter cell specificity (Rambaut et al, 2004) . In all these strategies, virus-host shift is based on modifications in the virus receptor recognition step. However, it has been shown that host range is not entirely dependent on the initial recognition stage (McFadden, 2005) .",

In a common vaccination practice, a live, attenuated virus is produced by adaptation to a new host, thereby eliminating its virulence to humans.

Known examples of naturally occurring host-virus shifts are the introduction of HIV-1 to humans in the early 1950s and the shift in the SARS (CoV) virus that crossed over to infect humans only very recently. The worldwide threat of influenza-based epidemics, such as the transmission of avian flu (Influenza A virus, H5N1) to humans and the latest outbreak of swine influenza (H1N1, April 2009) in Mexico, is heightened by the rapid evolution of the Influenza virus witnessed during the last decade; recently, H3N2 and H3N8 were introduced from humans to pigs and from horses to dogs, respectively (Campitelli et al, 1997) . It is likely that the domestication and close interaction between humans, rats, and farm animals for thousands of years has led to the evolution of viruses that infect humans and are adapted toward a broad range of hosts. The similarities in codon usage and amino acid composition that we have observed in this work can somewhat relate to the potential for zoonosis.

Formally, for each virus v, define h(v) to be the set of host species that it can infect. And, let C 1 , y, C k be a disjoint partition of the host organisms under study. Now, for a particular virus v, consider the least common ancestor (LCA) of the host species of v in the host taxonomic tree: LCA(h(v)). If there exists a single cluster C i (1pipk) such that LCA(h(v)) is a descendant of C i (possibly C i itself), then we uniquely map virus v to be among the viruses that infect the taxonomic sub-tree rooted at C i .",
