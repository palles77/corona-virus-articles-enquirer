In this study, we applied a standardized modeling strategy to the mortality and virology data from three Asian cities: subtropical Guangzhou and Hong Kong, and tropical Singapore, to estimate the disease burden of influenza in these cities. We found that influenza was associated with 10.6, 13.4 and 8.3 deaths per 100,000 population in Guangzhou, Hong Kong and Singapore, respectively. The annual rates of excess deaths in the elders were estimated highest in Guangzhou and lowest in Singapore. The excess death rate attributable to A/H1N1 subtype was found slightly higher than the rates attributable to A/H3N2 during the study period of 2004-2006 based on the data from Hong Kong and Guangzhou. Our study revealed a geographical variation in the disease burden of influenza in these subtropical and tropical cities. These results highlight a need to explore the determinants for severity of seasonal influenza.",

However, unspecific presenting symptoms of influenza, absence of timely laboratory tests in clinical practice and frequent secondary bacterial pneumonia make it difficult to estimate the disease burden of influenza directly from the clinical diagnosed cases [1, 2] . It is therefore necessary to assess influenza associated excess mortality or hospitalization by statistical modeling and use the estimate as a measurement for severity of influenza epidemics [3] . Some studies reported that the disease burden of influenza was nearly equivalent across some temperate countries [4] , but others noticed that Abbreviations: ILI, influenza-like illness; ICD, International Classification of Diseases; CRD, cardiorespiratory diseases; P&I, pneumonia and influenza; COPD, chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases; IHD, ischemic heart diseases. effects of influenza occasionally exhibited disparities between geographical areas even in the same influenza season [5] . It has been proposed that socioeconomic factors and various circulating virus strains could play an important role in determining the severity of influenza epidemics [5] [6] [7] . Some environmental factors that are critical for survival and transmission of viruses, such as temperature and humidity, could also be involved as effect modifiers [8] . However, geographical variations in influenza associated disease burden in the tropics and subtropics have not been explored.",

Here we adopted the Poisson regression models to assess the age-disease specific excess mortality rates associated with influenza. Allowing for flexible adjustment of seasonal factors, this Poisson model has been widely used in many other disease burdens studies and is recommended for the subtropical and tropical regions with unpredictable influenza seasonality in a recently published WHO guideline [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] . Our recent validation study using an empirical dataset of laboratory confirmed influenza cases demonstrated that this model was able to provide reliable estimates for disease burden of influenza [25] .

However, these results need careful interpretation as these two studies differed in terms of statistical models, data aggregation and study periods covered. The present study adopted a standardized modeling approach to show that the overall influenza burden was comparable between the two subtropical cities Guangzhou and Hong Kong, but lower in the tropical Singapore. This geographical disparity was particularly evident in the elders, with the highest excess mortality rates associated with influenza found in Guangzhou, which has a smaller proportion of old population than Hong Kong but is the least developed among the three cities. Cohen et al. also found the mortality impact of seasonal influenza was higher in the elders of South Africa than in those of the United States and this difference did not diminish after adjustment for age structures [27] . Together with our findings, it seems that the socioeconomic factors may associate with the mortality burden of influenza, particularly for the elders. Another Fig. 2 . Annual excess all-cause mortality rates associated with influenza (per 100,000 population) between Guangzhou, Hong Kong and Singapore, all-ages group. important factor that needs to be considered in interpreting our results is the different underlying susceptibility of population to severe outcomes of influenza infection across three cities. For example, the lower overall impact of influenza in Singapore may not be due to its tropical climate, but partially due to its younger age structure. This heterogeneity of susceptibility could possibly been adjusted for by calculating age standardized excess mortality rates for each city, as the elders tend to be more fragile and have a higher mortality risk attributable to influenza. However, it is difficult to obtain reliable estimates for younger age groups due to small numbers of deaths. A future study with a longer study period shall be able to provide estimates with proper adjustment for age structures.",

A/H3N2 is believed to transmit more efficiently in human population than A/H1N1 and antigenic drifts occurred more frequently in this subtype [8, 34] . Surprisingly, we found that the disease burden attributable to A/H3N2 was slightly lower than the burden attributable to A/H1N1 in Guangzhou and Hong Kong. We noticed that after the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) viruses in 2003, all the three cities observed dramatically increased vaccination rates for influenza [29] . We compared the excess mortality attributable to each subtype during the pre-SARS period of 1998-2002 in Hong Kong, and the results showed that H3N2 were associated with significantly more deaths than H1N1 (data not shown). Although a new strain A/California/7/04-like gradually became prevalent in the late year of 2004, it did not dramatically increase the mortality risks associated with influenza according to our results. Some studies have shown that this novel strain mainly attacked the young adults and the vaccine recommended for the Northern Hemisphere during the 2003-2004 season was still able to provide crossprotection against it [35, 36] . As a result, those susceptible people (the elders and chronic patients) might have still been benefited from increased vaccination and exempted from deaths. However, the disease burden of A/H1N1 may have long been neglected, probably owing to its less frequent antigenic drifts compared to A/H3N2 in the human community. Recent experimental studies have found that seasonal H1N1 strains can replicate as efficiently as pandemic H1N1 and avian H5N1 strains in ex vivo-infected lung tissues [37, 38] . Further experimental studies on virulence of different subtypes circulating in 2004-2006 may help to solve this mystery. More epidemiology studies with longer time series data from different climates are also needed to compare the relative severity of A/H1N1 and A/H3N2 strains.",

            "text": "Our study has potential caveats. Firstly, these three cities vary in the organization of their influenza surveillance networks. Most specimens in Hong Kong were mainly from the inpatients and therefore more severe cases of influenza infections were recruited into the surveillance. The sentinel doctors of Guangzhou were all from the outpatient sectors, and the virology data exhibited greater variation than the other two cities due to limited numbers of samples taken each week. Singapore had the lowest positive rates of influenza specimens, probably due to the fact this city included a mixture of samples from both inpatient and outpatient settings. Nonetheless, we standardized the comparison procedure by using the age-specific excess mortality rate as measurement for influenza effects, which could at least partially exclude the bias introduced by different surveillance systems in these cities. Secondly, although we carefully controlled for the confounding seasonal factors by building core models a priori, it is possible that there are still many unmeasured confounding factors. Moreover, to what extent such confounding factors should be adjusted for was subject to personal judgement and over-fitting of core models cannot be completely avoided, as revealed by the negative estimates in some disease categories. Thirdly, all three cities in this study might be more socioeconomically developed than the rest of Asian cities; therefore, extra caution is needed to extrapolate our findings to the other cities/countries. Last but not least, we did not quantify the statistical significance of differences between the city specific estimates, because they were derived from different models. But their overlapping confidence intervals suggest that the differences might not be statistically significant.",
