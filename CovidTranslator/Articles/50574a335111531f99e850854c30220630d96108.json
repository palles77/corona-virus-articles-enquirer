In these particular cases, it may be reasonable to first reconstruct the anatomy of the heart chamber during sinus or paced rhythm, adding the local activation times (LATs) to the existing anatomical information within a second step as a so-called remap. Figure 1A exemplarily displays the electrocardiogram of a young patient with long QT syndrome suffering from recurrent episodes of torsade de pointes tachycardia triggered by short-coupled left ventricular PBs. In this particular case, the operator decided to first reconstruct left ventricular anatomy. By obtaining LAT measurements (exemplarily displayed in Figure 1B Motivated by established systematic search routines as, for example, applied for the rescue of avalanche victims, we strived for developing an algorithm for optimized data acquisition to accelerate the mapping procedure in cases of rare arrhythmia occurrence. 4 Our strategy was based on the assumption that when deciding about the localization of each next LAT measurement, the amount of additional information may largely differ depending on the exact location of the measuring point. We therefore developed a mapping algorithm that is able to calculate the amount of additive value at each nodal point of the geometry and automatically position the next LAT measurement at the site of maximum additive information. Furthermore, the algorithm is able to predict earliest activation by extrapolation on the basis of the acquired LAT measurements with high accuracy.",

An example is considering that a number of mapping points have been acquired and the algorithm tries to identify the site of earliest activation. In this case, it would go through all other nodal points each time establishing a regression analysis (see Supplemental Figure 1 ) with all available mapping points. Figure 2 explains the search routine within a simple planar mesh geometry. The red nodal point marks the true origin of excitation, and the black points (labeled a, b, and c) mark the measurement points already obtained at this time point. When assuming the blue point as the possible source, the calculated distances to the measurements points are 1, 3, and 3 numbers of edges. However, as the LATs at the measurement points in fact characterize the distance to the true origin (red point), there is no good correlation between distance and time ( Figure 2C ). In contrast, when assuming the red point as the possible source, the distances as well as the time delays to the measurement points (black points) are 1, 2, and 3. Figure 2D displays the excellent correlation of these points, thereby identifying the red point as true origin.",

The second regression parameter of the regression at nodal point i is t 0i . In other words, we wanted to minimize the variance of the y-intercept for all regressions we perform by picking the next measurement point. The reason for this approach is that every point of the regression curve possesses a certain degree of uncertainty. This is reflected by the variance (see red lines in Supplemental Figure 1 ). In addition to the correlation coefficient, the variance of the y-intercept (at distance 0) provides information about the quality of fit. Therefore, to identify the specific nodal point where a next mapping point would best improve the quality of the map, the algorithm again went through all nodal points checking how much a measurement at this specific point would reduce the variance of the y-intercept of the regression curves at all other points. This specific nodal point that results in the maximum reduction of the variance of the y-intercept of all other nodal points was identified as the next mapping point. The mean overall computing time for the calculation of the optimal position of the next mapping point as well as the revised prediction of earliest activation was 124 ms.",

To identify the point in time, when this second phase of the search routine needed to be entered, the algorithm continuously compared the quality of fit (derived from regression analysis) between the predicted site of origin and all points within 1 cm around it.

We therefore computed the LAT for each nodal point of the mesh geometry using the electroanatomic map created by the operator, the identified origin, the calculated CV, and the individual measurement error. These geometries served as a test environment for the algorithm. At the beginning of the automated mapping procedure, the algorithm had information only about the anatomical situation derived from the mesh geometry, such as the exact localization of the nodal points and the connecting edges, which means that the algorithm was blinded to all LATs of the geometry. At the very beginning of the automated mapping procedure, the first 3 LAT measurements were chosen en bloc because the selection of only 2 points would result in a perfect linear regression fit, rendering all points equally likely to be the origin. These 3 measurements are automatically performed by the algorithm purely on the basis of the shape of the geometry. Now that the LAT and localization of the initial 3 measurement points had been obtained, the algorithm went through all nodal points of the geometry, each time calculating the distance to the 3 initial measurement points and the linear regression for distance and LAT. The nodal point with the best fit was then assumed to be the origin (predicted origin). Figure 4A exemplarily displays the situation for the previously described patient (Figure 1 ) at this exact point in time. The initial 3 measurement points are displayed as black points. The quality of correlation (r 2 ) of each nodal point is color coded, with blue representing strong correlation and white weak correlation. The nodal point with the best correlation (predicted origin) is highlighted as a large blue point. The red point indicates the localization of the true origin. Since only 3 LAT measurements had been performed at this point in time, the predicted origin is still remarkably displaced from the true origin. The correlation between the distance to the measurement points and the LATs for the predicted origin (large blue point) is displayed in Figure 4B .",

Considering that the y-intercept of the regression curve represents the predicted origin, the algorithm searched for that specific nodal point at which an LAT measurement would reduce the variance of the y-intercept for the regression curves of all nodal points most. Figure 4C displays a mesh geometry showing the additive value at each nodal point, with black representing maximum additive information and white minimum additive information. The location of the maximum additive value is marked by an arrow (Figure 4C ). Two itera-tions later and now based on the information of 5 LAT measurements, the predicted origin evidently migrates toward the true origin ( Figures 4D-4F ). Figure 5A displays the situation after the seventh iteration when the algorithm located the true origin by placing the last measurement in this position. Comparable to Figure 3A , the acquired measurement points are color coded, with red representing early activation times and purple late activation times. Again, the search path is displayed on the frontal and sagittal planes. In contrast to the operator (27 measurements), the algorithm identified the true origin with 7 LAT measurements. Figure 5B displays the correlation between the distance to the origin and the LAT. To allow a direct comparison between the map automatically generated by our algorithm with the original CARTO map, we created a color-coded CARTOlike activation map ( Figure 5C ). Identically to the remap displayed in Figure 1B III , our map is based on the spatiotemporal information of 7 LAT measurements.

            "text": "The algorithm outperformed the operator in almost every case in terms of the number of mapping points necessary to locate the site of origin, thereby pointing to shorter procedure times. In our opinion, there are 2 main reasons for this observed effect: (1) When directly comparing the number needed based on iterative linear regression analyses, our algorithm is able to calculate the degree of redundancy from each nodal point of the geometry, thereby identifying the nodal point with maximum additive information. This optimized search routine guarantees that the site of earliest activation can be located with a low number of LAT measurements. (2) Except for optimized data acquisition, our algorithm exhibits a second feature that might contribute to the significant reduction of mapping points. The linear regression analyses calculated for each nodal point are used not only to calculate the amount of additive information but also to predict the site of earliest activation. This means that LATs of any nodal point is extrapolated from the acquired LATs. In contrast, activation maps generated by the CARTO system are based on interpolation between the acquired mapping points. This difference might account for the higher quality of the activation map generated by our algorithm. As an example, when comparing the CARTO map based on the spatiotemporal information of 7 LAT measurements displayed in Figure 1B III with our map based on the same number of LAT measurements ( Figure 5C ), a clear difference in the accuracy is visible. Interestingly, a quite similar approach using regression analyses has been published recently for the identification of the source of network-driven contagion phenomena such as the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic or the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic. 5 In their work the authors report that on the basis of geographical locations, arrival times of infection, and predicted traveling times, the source of the infection can be located using correlation analyses. Compared to our simple 3D electroanatomic model, these simulations are quite complex because of the inhomogeneous network structure and limited knowledge about the exact traveling times. 6 However, motivated by the good results of these studies, it might be a promising approach to further increase the degree of complexity of our models, for example, by including anatomical structures (ie, mitral or tricuspid annulus) or by including areas of scared tissue with reduced CV, for example, to allow fast activation mapping in scar-related ventricular tachycardia.",

Hocini and coworkers 1,2,7 recently published promising data from a multicenter study applying a novel technique of high-resolution noninvasive mapping for the ablation of focal arrhythmia. However, it has to be taken into account that this technique requires a thoracic computed tomography scan, an electrode vest, and an additional mapping system (ECVue, CardioInsight Technologies, Inc., Cleveland, OH). A similar approach of inverse potential mapping based on the combination of a magnetic resonance imaging scan and a body surface potential map has recently been published by Bhagirath and coworkers. 3, 8 However, noninvasive mapping techniques have not yet entered clinical routine. Similar to noninvasive mapping techniques, the use of multielectrode catheters has also been proposed to accelerate endocardial mapping of focal arrhythmias. Using noncontact 4, 9 or contact 1,10,11 acquisition of endocardial electrograms, these systems allow simultaneous assessment of a larger number of LATs using basket or balloon catheters. Compared to all technologies described above, our algorithm offers the advantage that it may easily be implemented into standard 3D electroanatomic mapping systems without any need for additional hardware components or preprocedural imaging modalities.",

B: Because of the infrequent occurrence of PBs during the ablation procedure, an anatomical geometry was first established (image B I ). Excitation propagation during PBs was then analyzed within the previously established anatomic map by point-by-point acquisition of LATs (images B II-IV ). The displayed remaps are based on the spatiotemporal information of 3 (image I), 5 (image II), 7 (image III), and 27 (image IV) mapping points.

On the basis of the electroanatomic maps exported from the CARTO system, simplified mesh geometries were established. A: Within this simple example, the red point represents the true site of origin of a focally spreading electrical activation. The black points (labeled a, b, and c) represent nodal points at which LAT measurements have been performed. Considering a time delay of 1 arbitrary unit for the conduction from one to the next nodal point, the LATs at the measurement points a, b, and c are 1, 2, and 3, respectively (equivalent to the distance to the red point). C: Not knowing the site of origin and questioning whether the blue point might possibly be the source of the arrhythmia, one could draw a simple graph plotting the distance between the blue and black points (3, 1, and 3) in correspondence to the LATs (1, 2, and 3). Regression analysis within this plot reveals no correlation, thereby excluding the blue point as the true site of origin.
