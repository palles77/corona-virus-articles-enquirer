Over time, however, as wild populations declined and source country attitudes toward these faunal treasures changed, animals used in research were more often bred in captivity. Standard operating procedures, sanitation, and lack of intermediate hosts greatly reduced the incidence of parasite infection and infestation, particularly for indirectly transmitted parasites [1] . Now, except for a few directly transmitted parasites, infection and infestation are uncommon. However, the occasional movement of animals from the wild into captive populations, particularly in zoological collections, means that veterinarians and biologists working with NHP, including marmosets, should remain aware of these organisms and the conditions caused by them.",

To retain consistency within the current literature, the organization of this chapter will largely follow the structure used by Strait et al.

Parasites of the genus Giardia are the only parasites known to contain a median body, which appears as a \"claw hammer\" under light microscopy. The presence of this organelle facilitates identification of the genus. Trophozoites are piriform and bilaterally symmetrical, measure 9e21 mm long by 5e15 mm wide, and bear a sucking disc on the anteroventral side (Fig. 17.1A) . The dorsal side is convex. There are two anterior nuclei, two slender axostyles, and four pairs of flagella. The infectious cyst stage is oval in shape. Cysts typically measure 8e12 mm long and 7e10 mm wide [5] (Fig. 17.1B) . Following binary fission, cysts contain two daughter trophozoites, thereby doubling the number of internal organelles [2, 6] . in marmosets. However, a chronic carrier state such as that found in some companion animals and humans may be more common than previously recognized [7, 8] . Occasionally, clinically affected animals may develop malodorous, fatty stool to watery diarrhea, flatulence, abdominal cramping and distension, anorexia, and weight loss [5, 7, 9] .",

Other arthropod hosts capable of being infected experimentally include bed bugs, sheep keds, and soft ticks in the genus Ornithodoros. These therefore represent additional potential vectors [6] . However, triatomes are clearly most important in transmitting the organism, either through defecation of parasite-laden feces, with subsequent trypomastigote penetration of mucus membranes or entry into the feeding site, or via ingestion of infected triatomes by susceptible hosts. Infection is common in South and Central America. Because of the presence of suitable arthropod vectors in the extreme southern United States, T. cruzi has become established in some captive nonhuman primate colonies in Texas, Louisiana, and Georgia. Several species of wild animals serve as reservoirs of the parasite, making eradication of infection difficult once established in a nonhuman primate colony [16,16a] .",

Following ingestion of mature cysts by a suitable host, the trophozoite will emerge from the cyst and both the nuclei and cytoplasm will divide, resulting in eight daughter trophozoites [6] . New World monkeys, including marmosets, are less commonly infected with E. histolytica than are Old World monkeys. However, when infected, clinical disease is generally worse than in Old World monkeys. Other factors influencing severity of disease include the age and nutritional status of the host, with younger animals being more severely affected. In addition, environmental conditions that increase host animal stress and the intestinal microbiota of the host may play a role in disease severity [6, 16, 22] .",

Persons working with marmosets should practice excellent personal hygiene to prevent transmission of pathogens between themselves and the animals under their care [6, 22] .

The authors of that report acknowledged that the cessation of parasite shedding may not have been due to the treatment, but that the marmosets may have simply and coincidentally \"self-cured\" during the course of treatment [27] . Because Cryptosporidium sp. is known to infect humans, scientific and animal care staff should exercise strict personal hygiene when working with potentially infected marmosets.",

For the latter reason, it is likely that the breadth of nematode parasites that may infect marmosets is greater than revealed in the scientific literature. For this reason, the reader should realize that marmosets may be found with parasites that are not on any of the lists of reported marmoset parasitism and so might need to consult the literature on other New World primate species for information regarding specific parasitisms. Furthermore, several nematode superfamilies or species have only infrequently been reported, or have only been reported under somewhat artificial conditions. Uncommonly reported nematode genera parasitizing wild and/or captive marmosets include Angiostrongylus, Enterobius, Filariopsis, Gongylonema, Physaloptera, Primasubulura, Protospirura, Riticularia, Subulura, and Trypanoxyuris [2,4,16,34e39]. However, relatively little is known of the biology or clinical effects of these parasites. Thus, uncommon or little-known parasitisms such as these are not covered in this chapter.

However, as was noted for nematode parasitisms, those caring for and working with marmosets should be watchful for external parasitisms, which have been reported in other species of New World primates, as many of these may also, under proper conditions, infest marmosets. Many external parasites are not highly host specific, though they certainly exhibit host preferences, and thus may infest marmosets as conditions provide opportunity. For example, marmosets may be readily infested with the common dog and cat fleas, Ctenocephalides canis and C. felis, respectively. While these infestations are unlikely to be found in wild marmosets, it is not difficult to envision conditions in which these fleas could move from domestic animals to captive marmosets, especially if housed in outdoor enclosures. Infestations with Ctenocephalides sp. should be prevented and managed using approaches similar to those used for domestic animals. For the purposes of this chapter, general descriptions of infestation will be presented for major groups of external parasites, without, for the most part, direct and specific reference to infestations of marmosets.",
