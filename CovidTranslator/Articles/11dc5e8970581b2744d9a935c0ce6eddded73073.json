Acute renal failure generally refers to cases of sudden decline of glomerular filtration rate resulting in an accumulation of nitrogenous waste products and inability to maintain normal fluid balance. Chronic renal failure generally refers to an insidious onset with slow progression (usually months to years) of azotemia and inadequately concentrated urine. \u2022 It is important to realize that most of the renal diseases discussed can manifest as varying stages of compromise in renal reserve, renal insufficiency, or renal failure.

ETIOLOGY AND PATHOPHYSIOLOGY \u2022 Bacterial dermatitis/ulcerative dermatitis \uf099 Staphylococcus spp. \uf099 Usually secondary to self-trauma due to pruritus from mites or pruritus/pain over skin of salivary glands during sialodacryoadenitis (SDA) virus infection; dermatophytosis, fight wounds \u2022 Abscesses \uf099 Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus spp., Pasteurella pneumotropica, Actinomyces bovis \uf099 Often secondary to conspecific trauma \u2022 Parasites \uf099 All ectoparasitic infections can be complicated by secondary infections and self-mutilation. These secondary complications need to be identified and treated. \uf099 Rat fur mite (Radfordia ensifera): common; mild infestation produces few ill effects, but heavy infestation causes pruritus, leading to self-traumatization, and ulcerative dermatitis. Transmission is by direct contact. \uf099 Sarcoptic mites (e.g., Sarcoptes scabiei, Sarcoptes anacanthos, Trixacarus diversus): less common. Transmission is by direct contact. Leads to pruritus, crusting, and hyperkeratosis. Animals with clinical signs are often immune compromised. \uf099 Notoedres muris: causes typical papulous lesions on ear pinnae \uf099 Tropical rat mite (Ornithonyssus bacoti): Blood sucking mite; opportunistic ectoparasite. It spends a relatively short time on a host (usually at night) and penetrates the skin for feeding only. Cause severe pruritus. Animals appear nervous, particular in evening hours and at night. Severe infestations can cause anemia, debilitation, and death. \uf099 Demodectic mites (Demodex ratti, Demodex norvegicus, Demodex ratticola): rare \uf099 Lice (Polyplax serrata, Polyplax spinulosa): Common; blood sucking lice. Located mainly at neck, at shoulders, and over back; poor fur condition and pruritus, which leads to self-mutilation \uf099 Pinworms (Syphacia obvelata): perianal pruritus and tail base mutilation \u2022 Dermatophytosis \uf099 Microsporum spp., Trichophyton mentagrophytes \uf099 Clinical signs vary: alopecia, erythema, dandruff formation. Animals usually are not pruritic, unless secondary bacterial infection present. \uf099 Immune deficiency or stress may be underlying cause in chronic cases. \u2022 Neoplasia: fibroadenoma of the mammary glands (most common), mammary adenocarcinoma, lymphoma, etc. (see Mammary and Pituitary Tumors)",
