            "text": "The SARS coronavirus is a positive-strand RNA virus. The 5 0 twothirds of the genome encodes two overlapping polyproteins, pp1a and pp1ab, which are processed to generate the viral replication complex. During viral replication, the replicase polyprotein undergoes extensive processing by two viral proteases namely, chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro) and papain-like protease (PLpro). 5, 6 Because of their essential roles in viral replication, both proteases are recognized as attractive targets for development of anti-SARS therapeutics. 7 The structure and activity of the active sites of both SARS-CoV 3CLpro and SARS-CoV PLpro have been elucidated. Thus far, inhibitor design efforts are mostly limited to SARS-CoV 3CLpro and numerous covalent and noncovalent inhibi-tors have been reported. 7 In our continuing interest in the design and development of SARS-CoV 3CLpro inhibitors, we recently reported structure-based design of a number of potent peptidomimetic SARS-CoV 3CLpro inhibitors (1 and 2). 8 The SARS-CoV 3CLpro active site contains a catalytic dyad where a cysteine residue acts as a nucleophile and a histidine residue acts as the general acid base. 9 The inhibitors bind to SARS-CoV 3CLpro through a covalent bond with the active site Cys-145 residue. These inhibitors contain peptidomimetic scaffolds and lacked adequate potency, particularly antiviral activity suitable for drug-development. Recently, Wong and co-workers reported a new class of potent small molecule benzotriazole ester-based 3CLpro inhibitors. Compound 3 is the most potent inhibitor among the benzotriazole esters. 10 The mode of action involves acylation of the active site Cys-145 assisted by the catalytic dyad. This irreversible enzyme acylation was verified by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry of the inhibited enzyme. While these inhibitors have shown very impressive SARS-CoV 3CLpro enzyme inhibitory activity, their antiviral activity required improvement. 11 It seems the indole-5-carboxylate moiety plays an important role in binding with the enzyme active site. Another class of hetereoaromatic ester inhibitors was also identified and studied. 12, 13 The 5-chloropyridine moiety in 4 proved to be the key unit for the activity against 3CLpro. The report however lacked antiviral data. We report herein the development of 3-chloropyridyl ester-based SARS-CoV 3CLpro inhibitors that exhibit potent enzyme inhibitory activity as well as very good 0960-894X/$ -see front matter \u00d3 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

            "text": "To confirm that 3CLpro is covalently modified by 10, we determined enzyme modification using MALDI-TOF. 19 Authentic SARS-CoV 3CLpro was incubated with compound 10 for 20 min and then analyzed in comparison with untreated enzyme. A shift of approximately 217 Da was observed after treatment of SARS-CoV 3CLpro with the inhibitor confirming covalent modification. Covalent modification by similar reactive esters has also been reported. 13a,20 To obtain molecular insight into the binding properties of these active ester-based inhibitors, we conducted docking studies in the 3CLpro active site. GOLD3.2 21 was used to dock our most active compound, 10 (GRL-0496), into the active site of the authentic SARS-CoV 3CLpro structure (PDBID: 2HOB). 22 In search of obtaining a model of the associated complex between the unreacted ester and protein, (i.e. prior to nucleophilic attack by Cys-145), the distance between the carbonyl carbon atom of 10 and the sulfur atom of Cys-145 was constrained to be in the range of 2.5-3.5 \u00c5. This pre-reaction or 'collision complex' is shown in Figures 1 and 2 , and resulted in a distance of 2.8 \u00c5 between the carbonyl carbon of 10 and the sulfur of Cys-145. This orientation of the ligand has the chloropyridyl group situated in the S1 pocket, with the chloro group pointing towards the surface of the protein. The nitrogen of the chloropyridinyl leaving group is in close proximity (2.4 \u00c5) to the imidazole nitrogen of His-163. The carbonyl oxygen is situated between three backbone nitrogens, forming three hydrogen bonds. As shown in Figure 2 : the first hydrogen bond is from Cys-145(NH) (2.3 \u00c5), the second is from Ser-144(NH) (2.4 \u00c5), and the third is from Gly-143(NH) (2.8 \u00c5) . This suggests that a fairly strong hydrogen bonding network is present within the active site which likely aids in positioning and stabilizing the carbonyl group of the ester for nucleophilic attack by the Cys-145. The indole group of 10 is positioned near the more hydrophobic S2 pocket, with the indole nitrogen likely interacting with the imidazole group of His-41, see Figure 2 .",

The product of the reaction of 10 with 3CLpro was docked using a more recently released 3CLpro crystal structure, (PDBID: 2V6N) . 20 This crystal structure contains a benzotriazole ester molecule which has reacted with the thiol of Cys-145, forming a covalently bound ligand similar to the compounds presented in this paper. We have used this crystal structure for the post-reaction complex due to the notable movement of the His-41 in 2V6N, which flips and is able to p stack with the aromatic moiety of the smaller covalently bound ligand. 20 GOLD3. model, as it has the capability for docking covalently bound ligands. Figure 3 is a docked model of 10 covalently attached to the Cys-145 sulfur atom. The model suggests that the indole group of 10 shifts and positions itself where the leaving group was in the complex, more towards the S1 pocket. This positioning of inhibitor 10 in the complex is not surprising as a similar orientation has been proposed before by James' group for similar esters. 23, 24 More importantly though is the obvious p-p stacking of the indolyl of 10 with the imidazole ring of His-41, which is also seen in the benzotriazole group of the referenced crystal structure (2V6N). 20 There is approximately 4 \u00c5 between the aromatic rings of the indolyl and the imidazole of His-41. This interaction clearly determines the position of the indolyl group of our compounds. Other residues shown in Figure 3 , such as Asp-187 and Gln-189 are more than 5 \u00c5 away from the indolyl, but might come into play with larger substituents, such as in compound 11.",

Accordingly, carboxylate substitution on indole rings at 5, 6, 4 and 7 positions resulted in chloropyridinyl esters 5, 9, 10 and 12, respectively. These inhibitors were evaluated and as it turned out, inhibitor 10, with a carboxylate at the 4-position, was the most potent inhibitor with an IC 50 of 30 nM, a 10-fold potency enhancement over 5 containing a carboxylate at the 5-position. Compound 10 also shows the best SARS-CoV antiviral activity with an EC 50 value of 6.9 lM. Acylation of 10-11 resulted in a 30-fold loss of potency. Penicillin-derived chloropyridine 13 did not show any appreciable activity. Tetrahydroisoquinoline derivative 14,",
