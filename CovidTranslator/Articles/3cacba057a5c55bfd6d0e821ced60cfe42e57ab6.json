With few 19 exceptions, genomic epidemiological analysis has focused on geographically distributed data sets 20 with few isolates in any given location. Here we report an analysis of 20 whole SARS-CoV 2 21 genomes from a single relatively small and geographically constrained outbreak in Weifang, 22 People's Republic of China. Using Bayesian model-based phylodynamic methods, we estimate the 23 reproduction number for the outbreak to be 2.6 (95% CI:1.5-5). We further estimate the number of 24 infections through time and compare these estimates to confirmed diagnoses by the Weifang 25 Centers for Disease Control. We find that these estimates are consistent with reported cases and 26 there is unlikely to be a large undiagnosed burden of infection over the period we studied. 27 28 194",

Not peer reviewed. outbreak in Wuhan, China. These data comprise 20 whole genome sequences from confirmed 32 COVID19 infections in Weifang, Shandong Province, People's Republic of China. The data were 33 collected over the course of several weeks up to February 10, 2020 and overlap with a period 34 of intensifying public health and social distancing measures. Phylodynamic analysis allows us to 35 evaluate epidemiological trends after seeding events which took place in mid to late January, 2020. 36 The objective of our analysis is to evaluate epidemiological trends based on national surveillance 37 and response efforts by Weifang Centers for Disease Control (CDC). This analysis provides an 38 estimate of the initial rate of spread and reproduction number in Weifang City. In contrast to the 39 early spread of COVID19 in Hubei Province of China, most community transmissions within Weifang 40 took place after public health interventions and social distancing measures were put in place. We 41 therefore hypothesize that genetic data should reflect a lower growth rate and reproduction number 42 than was observed in Wuhan. A secondary aim is to estimate the total numbers infected and to 43 evaluate the possibility that there is a large unmeasured burden of infection due to imperfect case 44 ascertainment and a large proportion of infections with mild or asymptomatic illness. 45 To analyze the Weifang sequences, we have adapted model-based phylodynamic methods 46 which were previously used to estimate growth rates and reproduction numbers using sequence 47 data from Wuhan and exported international cases (Volz et al., 2020) . This analysis has several 48 constraints and requirements: 49 50 Importation of lineages from Wuhan. The outbreak in Weifang was seeded by multiple lineages 51 imported at various times from the rest of China. We use a phylodynamic model that accounts for 52 location of sampling. Migration is modeled as a bi-directional process with rates proportional to 53 epidemic size in Weifang. The larger international reservoir of COVID19 cases serves as a source of 54 new infections and is assumed to be growing exponentially over this period of time. 55 Nonlinear epidemiological dynamics in Weifang. The maximum number of daily confirmed COVID19 56 cases occurred on February 5, but it is unknown when the maximum prevalence of infection oc-57 curred. We use a susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) model (Keeling and Rohani, 2011) 58 for epidemic dynamics in Weifang. The model accounts for a realistic distribution of generation 59 times and can potentially capture a nonlinear decrease in cases following epidemic peak. 60 Variance in transmission rates (Lloyd-Smith et al., 2005) .To estimate total numbers infected, the 61 phylodynamic model must account for epidemiological variables which are known to significantly 62 influence genetic diversity. Foremost among these is the variance in offspring distribution (number 63 of transmissions per primary case). We draw on previous evidence based on the previous SARS 64 epidemic which indicates that the offspring distribution is highly over-dispersed. High variance of 65 transmission rates will reduce genetic diversity of a sample and failure to account for this factor 66 will lead to highly biased estimates of epidemic size (Li et al., 2017) . Recent analyses of sequence 67 data drawn primarily from Wuhan has found that high over-dispersion was required for estimated 68 cases to be consistent with the epidemiological record (Volz et al., 2020) . Models assuming low 69 variance in transmission rates between people would generate estimates of cases that are lower .

Figure 1A 80 illustrates the phylodynamic model which was co-estimated with the phylogeny which provides 81 estimates of epidemiological parameters summarized in Table 1 . Figure We do not have sufficient data to detect a large decrease in epidemic growth rates as the 93 epidemic progressed. We estimate 0 = 2.6 (95% HPD:1.5-5). The growth rate in estimated 94 infections remained positive but decreased substantially over the sampling period.

Among the 20 Weifang sequences included in 108 this analysis, there is mean pairwise difference of only three single nucleotide polymorphisms and 109 only approximately twice as much diversity observed among the remainder of the sequences we 110 studied. There is correspondingly low confidence in tree topology(Figure Supplement 2), and only 111 three clades had greater than 50% posterior support including one clade which had a monophyletic 112 compoisition of 13 Weifang lineages. The earliest Weifang sequence was sampled on January 25 113 from a patient who showed first symptoms on January 16. These dates cover a similar range as the 114 posterior TMRCA of all Weifang sequences (Figure Supplement 3). 115 Discussion 116 Our analysis of 20 SARS-CoV 2 genomes from Weifang, China has confirmed independent observa-117 tions regarding the rate of spread and burden of infection in the city. Surveillance of COVID19 is 118 rendered difficult by high proportions of illness with mild severity and an unknown proportion of 119 asymptomatic infection(Guan et al., 2020). The extent of under-reporting and case ascertainment 120 rates has been widely debated. Analysis of genetic sequence data provides an alternative source of 121 information about epidemic size which can be more robust to imperfect case ascertainment. We 122 do not find evidence for a very large hidden burden of infection within Weifang. The relatively low 123 estimate of 0 is consistent with a slower rate of spread outside of Wuhan and effective control 124 strategies implemented in late January. 125 While the value of pathogen genomic analyses is widely recognized for estimating dates of 126 emergence(Verity Hill, 2020; Gire et al., 2014) and identifying animal reservoirs(Zhou et al., 2020; 127 Dudas et al., 2018), analysis of pathogen sequences also has potential to inform epidemic surveil-128 lance and intervention efforts. With few exceptions(Stadler, 2020;Bedford, 2020), this potential 129 is currently not being realized for the international response to COVID19. It is worth noting that 130 the analysis described in this report was accomplished in approximately 48 hours and drew on 131 previously developed models and packages for BEAST2(Bouckaert et al., 2019; Volz and Siveroni,   132    2018). It is therefore feasible for phylodynamic analysis to provide a rapid supplement to epidemio-133 logical surveillance, however this requires rapid sequencing and timely sharing of data as well as 134 randomized concentrated sampling of the epidemic within localities such as individual cities.",
