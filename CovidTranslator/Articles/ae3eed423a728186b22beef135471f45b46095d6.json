            "text": "Arenaviruses are a family of enveloped RNA viruses that cause severe human disease. The first step in the arenavirus life cycle is attachment of viral particles to host cells. While virus-cell attachment can be measured through the use of virions labeled with biotin, radioactive isotopes, or fluorescent dyes, these approaches typically require high multiplicities of infection (MOI) to enable detection of bound virus. We describe a quantitative (q)RT-PCR-based assay that measures Junin virus strain Candid 1 attachment via quantitation of virion-packaged viral genomic RNA. This assay has several advantages including its extreme sensitivity and ability to measure attachment over a large dynamic range of MOIs without the need to purify or label input virus. Importantly, this approach can be easily tailored for use with other viruses through the use of virus-specific qRT-PCR reagents. Further, this assay can be modified to permit measurement of particle endocytosis and genome uncoating. In conclusion, we describe a simple, yet robust assay for highly sensitive measurement of arenavirus-cell attachment.",

Therefore, the strong sensitivity of the assay overcomes the requirement for high MOI as well as any virus labeling or concentration steps.

Lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), the prototypic virus of the family 6 , has a worldwide distribution and is responsible for a variety of disease states including aseptic meningitis in immunocompetent individuals 6 , severe birth defects in the developing fetus 7 , or high lethality in immunosuppressed individuals following solid-organ transplantation 8, 9 .

Second, for the virus-cell attachment portion of the protocol, the virus, cells, and media must be kept at 4 \u00b0C to prevent endocytosis of surface-bound virions. Third, the quantity of cells collected for RNA extraction must not exceed the RNA binding capacity of the RNA purification filter. Fourth, purified viral RNA samples must be protected from ribonuclease-mediated degradation through the use of nuclease-free reagents and equipment and by keeping them on ice when thawed. Fifth, the range of the standard curve included in the qPCR assay must be sufficiently large to capture all values observed from the unknown samples. Sixth, technical replicates should be included for both the virus-cell attachment portion of the assay as well as the qPCR of individual RNA samples. Seventh, controls (e.g. cell lines that express hTfR1 or not) can be included to control for the specificity of the assay.

If a probe-independent qPCR approach is used, it would be important to verify that the reaction conditions are stringent enough to ensure specificity of the qPCR primers. It is also important to be aware that arenavirus RNA, whether extracted from cells or virions, can be nonspecifically primed to form cDNA during the RT in the absence of a virus-specific RT primer 12 . Therefore, copy numbers detected using a vRNA-specific RT primer do not strictly reflect just the vRNA species targeted by the RT primer.

While the use of radioactively-labeled particles results in good sensitivity, it necessitates the use of radioactivity, which increases the logistical complexity and safety concerns associated with this particular assay. The qPCR-based method described here requires as little as 20 PFU (MOI of ~0.0004 in a 48-well plate) and can reliably detect attachment over a large dynamic range of MOIs (e.g. MOIs from 0.0004 to at least 40) (Figure 3) . The strong sensitivity of this assay makes it possible to use low MOIs for more accurate measurement of productive binding events by standard infectious virus.

Cells would then be warmed to allow viral particles to be endocytosed, followed by treatment with a protease to strip any externally-bound virions that were not endocytosed as described 22, 24 . Sections 3 and 4 of this protocol would then be followed to extract viral RNA and quantitate copies of viral genomic RNA as a measure of endocytosis. To measure genome uncoating following fusion of viral and endosomal membranes, cells would be prebound with virus at 4 \u00b0C, warmed (to permit endocytosis and fusion) and stripped of external particles, and then collected for analysis. In one approach, cells could be lysed in an isotonic buffer to preserve intracellular vesicles, and then split into 2 fractions: one that would be treated with a cocktail of RNases (uncoated viral RNA is susceptible to degradation) and the other that would not 39 . Alternatively, cells could be separated into cytosolic or endosomal fractions 40 . In both cases, qRT-PCR would be used to quantitate viral genome in the cytoplasm as a measure of viral genome uncoating.

            "text": "To convert JUNV C#1 S segment RNA into cDNA for subsequent qPCR, subject the viral RNA (generated in step 3.1.4) to RT in a total volume of 50 \u00b5l.1. To set up the RT reaction, first create a master mix containing each of the following reagents per reaction: 6.75 \u00b5l of nuclease-free ddH2 O, 5 \u00b5l of a 2 \u00b5M stock of the RT primer S 2098-to 2075-(5'-AAGGGTTTAAAAATGGTAGCAGAC-3'), which is complementary to the NP region of the S segment genomic RNA, 5 \u00b5l of 10X PCR buffer II, 11 \u00b5l of a 25 mM MgCl 2 solution, 1.25 \u00b5l (62.5 Units) of RT enzyme, 1 \u00b5l (0.4 Units) of RNase inhibitor, and 10 \u00b5l of a 500 \u00b5M stock of dNTPs. Note: During the course of arenavirus replication, 4 viral S segment RNA species are generated: a full length genomic RNA (vRNA), a full length antigenomic RNA (vcRNA) (that is the reverse complement of the vRNA), and two subgenomic mRNAs encoding the NP and GP genes, respectively. The RT primer listed here is specific for only the S segment vRNA, but not the vcRNA, NP mRNA, or GP mRNA. 2. Gently mix the RT master mix and then aliquot 40 \u00b5l into individual 0.2 ml PCR tubes. Add 10 \u00b5l of viral RNA to each tube. Include i) a no template control tube (e.g. add 10 \u00b5l of nuclease-free ddH 2 O to 40 \u00b5l of the master mix) and ii) a no RT enzyme control (e.g. add 10 \u00b5l of a known-positive viral RNA sample to 40 \u00b5l of master mix that did not receive any RT enzyme) to screen for contamination of the RT reagents with amplified DNA containing the viral target sequence. Include RNA extracted from uninfected cells with the full RT master mix to control for assay specificity in the presence of cellular RNA. 3. Additionally, include a known-positive viral RNA sample to the full master mix to verify the quality of the RT reagents. Note that the volume of the RT reaction can be reduced to 25 \u00b5l if necessary. 2. Subject the RT tubes to the following cycling conditions: 25 \u00b0C for 10 min, 48 \u00b0C for 30 min, and 95 \u00b0C for 5 min. Note that samples can be stored at -20 \u00b0C at this point or left overnight in the thermocycler by adding a 4 \u00b0C step. 3. Perform qPCR in a total volume of 25 \u00b5l.1. Make a qPCR master mix by combining the following: 2.5 \u00b5l (of a 9 \u00b5M stock) of each the forward PCR primer S1937+ to 1958+ (5'-CATGGAGGTCAAACAACTTCCT-3') and reverse PCR primer S 2001-to 1982-(5'-GCCTCCAGACATGGTTGTGA-3'), 2.5 \u00b5l (of a 2 \u00b5M stock) of the qPCR probe S 1960+ to 1975+ (5'-6FAM-ATGTCATCGGATCCTT-MGBNFQ-3'), and 12.5 \u00b5l of the 2X universal qPCR master mix. Note that the forward primer reported here, which is specific for JUNV C#1, differs by 1 nt from the originally reported primer sequence38 , which targets the virulent JUNV strain Romero. 2. Gently mix the solution and then add 20 \u00b5l to each qPCR well. Add 5 \u00b5l of each RT reaction to the appropriate qPCR wells. Conduct qPCR in triplicate for each sample tested. Note that the PCR reaction volume can be reduced to as little as 12.5 \u00b5l if needed. Note: The software associated with the qPCR machine will generate absolute copy numbers of JUNV C#1 S segment genomic RNA by comparing the value of each unknown sample to a series of standard dilutions of plasmid encoding the JUNV C#1 NP gene, which is the target of the qPCR primer and probe set. The qPCR assay can only provide quantitation for values that fall within the range of the standard curve. For this reason, include the following quantities of plasmid (in triplicate wells)Load the qPCR plate into the thermocycler and run the following reaction conditions: 95 \u00b0C for 10 min and 40 cycles of 95 \u00b0C for 15 sec and 60 \u00b0C for 1 min.1. Collect and analyze the data to determine the quantity of viral RNA present in each sample according to manufacturer's protocol.",
