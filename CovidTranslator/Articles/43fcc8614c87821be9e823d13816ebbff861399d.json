According to the report of the Ministry of Health and Welfare's Central MERS Response Team, as of 11 Jun 2015, the number of South Koreans diagnosed with the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) increased to 122 since the first case was reported, including 9 deaths [1] . More than 2800 persons have been quarantined and hundreds of schools have been closed. The number of MERS cases in South Korea has been the second all around the world, only less than that of Saudi Arabia. As reported, one case occurred in a Korean man who traveled to China and had been confirmed to have close contact with two relatives with MERS-CoV infection, and this patient became the first reported case in China.",

A novel coronavirus was isolated from the sputum of the patient in Erasmus Medical Center (EMC) in Rotterdam, Holland, therefore, initially it was called the EMC coronavirus. According to a retrospective survey, the earliest MERS cases from Jordan were found at April 2012, which were the first cases of cluster. Both the 2 cases were found in medical staffs and they both died later. Since the sources of all the MERS patients were associated with the Middle East, the WHO in May 2013 named it as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome [2,3].",

In April 2013, another cluster of 23 confirmed cases of MERS-CoV was detected in Al-Hasa in the Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia. Almost all cases were directly linked to person-to-person exposure. Most of them are in the hemodialysis (9 cases) or intensive care (4 cases) units of a same hospital. Two cases are healthcare workers. Three family members of over 200 household contacts (all of whom had visited the hospital) were proven infected [1, 5] . More than 500 cases was reported in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates in March and April 2014, the majority represented hospital-based outbreaks in the Saudi Arabian cities of Jeddah (255 cases), Riyadh, Tabuk, and Madinah and in Al Ain City, Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, and included cases in healthcare workers, patients admitted for other medical problems, visitors, and ambulance staff. 75% of those cases had known sources of exposure. However, there has been no clear evidence of sustained community transmission of MERS-CoV. Of the family members, 7 of 554 were infected (1.3%) [4e6].",
