With rapid spreading of COVID-19 in many countries, however, CT volumes of suspicious patients are increasing at a speed much faster than the availability of human experts. Here, we propose an artificial intelligence (AI) system for fast COVID-19 diagnosis with an accuracy comparable to experienced radiologists. A large dataset was constructed by collecting 970 CT volumes of 496 patients with confirmed COVID-19 and 260 negative cases from three hospitals in Wuhan, China, and 1,125 negative cases from two publicly available chest CT datasets. Trained using only 312 cases, our diagnosis system, which is based on deep convolutional neural network, is able to achieve an accuracy of 94.98%, an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 97.91%, a sensitivity of 94.06%, and a specificity of 95.47% on an independent external verification dataset of 1,255 cases. In a reader study involving five radiologists, only one radiologist is slightly more accurate than the AI system. The AI system is two orders of magnitude faster than radiologists and the code is available at https : //github.com",

Even though reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is still ground truth of COVID-19 diagnosis, the sensitivity of RT-PCR is not high enough for low viral load present in test specimens or laboratory error [2] , and kits of RT-PCR are in short of supply in many areas [3] . By contrast, chest CT can show early lesions in the lung and, if diagnosed by experienced radiologists, can achieve high sensitivity [4] . In addition, CT scans are widely available and economic. At present, the diagnosis of chest CT depends on the radiologists, which has some problems. Firstly, chest CT contains hundreds of slices, which takes a long time to diagnose. Secondly, COVID-19, as a new lung disease, has similar manifestations with various types of pneumonia4. Radiologists need to accumulate a lot of CT diagnostic experience to achieve a high diagnostic performance. In some outbreak areas, many suspected patients are in urgent need of diagnosis and proper treatment, and many CT scans are performed every day. There is an urgent shortage of radiologists with high diagnosis performance for COVID- 19 .",

Recent research shows that AI algorithms can even achieve or exceed the performance of human experts in certain medical image diagnosis tasks [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] . The AI diagnosis algorithm also has the advantages of high efficiency, high repeatability and easy large-scale deployment. The current outbreak of COVID-19 is worldwide, and the shortage of specialist radiologists threatens the availability and adequacy of screening services for COVID-19 in affected areas.

Among the five professional readers in the radiology department, only one was able to produce a higher diagnostic accuracy than the AI system. This automatic, high-precision, non-invasive diagnostic system was developed to provide clinicians with easy-to-use tools. Given the chest CT of a suspected patient as input, the AI system can automatically output the diagnosis result. In the reader study, the average reading time of radiologists was 6.5 min, while that of AI system was 2.73 s, which can significantly improve the productivity of radiologists. Meanwhile, we found that 71% (15/21) of errors made by radiologists could be corrected by AI system. It means that AI system can be used as an effective secondary reader to provide reference suggestions when the radiologist is not sure about the case or when multiple radiologists are inconsistent. In general, AI can be adapted to different requirements. According to the highly sensitive settings, it can screen out suspicious patients for confirmation by doctors; In accordance with the highly specific settings, it can warn possible diagnosis errors made by the doctor; or an optimal threshold value is chosen according to the prior probability of infectious diseases and the local prevention and control strategy.",

In the subsets divided by gender, the diagnostic performance of men was higher than that of women. We noticed an obvious difference in the size of lungs and lesions between men and women. This is consistent with the conclusion of Xiong et al. [22] that women have higher antiviral immunity than men, leading to a longer incubation period of COVID-19. In the subsets divided by age, the disease developed rapidly in the elderly patients and the CT findings were more obvious than young patients. This suggests that different thresholds should be adopted according to gender and age. The results on the subsets divided by the number of CT scans showed that diagnosis results by the AI system have little correlation with the stages of CT scans. These observations may provide decision-making references for the diagnosis of COVID-19 in different populations.",

Overall, the proposed AI system has been comprehensively validated on large dataset with diagnosis performance comparable to human experts in diagnosing COVID-19. Unlike classical blackbox deep learning approaches, by visualizing AI system and applying radiomics analysis, it can decode effective representation of COVID-19 on CT imaging, and potentially lead to the discovery of new biomarkers.

For each image after the operation of a transform, six series of features are extracted, including first order features, Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM), Gray Level Size Zone Matrix (GLSZM), Gray Level Run Length Matrix (GLRLM), Neighboring Gray Tone Difference Matrix (NGTDM), Gray Level Dependence Matrix (GLDM). Radiomics analysis was performed using python version 3.6 and the \"pyradiomics\" package [26] . We designed three other features which are distance feature and fractal features of 2D contour and 3D gray level mesh of attentional region. The distance feature was defined as the distance between the center of gravity of the region of interest (obtained by the classification network after Grad-GAM) and the edge of the lung (obtained by the edge of the lung automatically segmentation results). Besides, 2D contour fractal dimension and 3D grayscale mesh fractal dimension of the attentional region was extracted. The fractal dimension describes the de- gree of curvature of the curve and surface. These three extra features were only extracted from the CT images of COVID-19 patients and were not analyzed and compared on the controlled cases. LASSO logistic regression model, heat map of cluster and correlation coefficient matrix were used to extract, select and verify the radiological features of the attentional region in the original CT images, which can interpret AI system. LASSO analysis was performed using python version 3.6 and the \"scikit-learn\" package.",

The SARS-Cov2 is small (60-140 nm in diameter), and when inhaled through the airways, it mainly invades the deep bronchioles, causes inflammation of the bronchioles and their surroundings to damage alveolar [27, 28] . Also, from the pathophysiology and etiology [29] [30] [31] , the SARS-Cov2 mainly invades the bronchioles and lung parenchyma. Lesions tend to occur in the lower and peripheral areas of the lung with abundant capillaries and lymphatics. These areas have well-established immune system and well-developed pulmonary lobules, leading to a strong inflammatory response [32, 33] . Secondly, fractal dimensions of most regional contour are between 1.95-2.00, shows a tortuous outline and conforms to the diffuse description, which corresponds to the fact that most of the cases in the dataset are at early or developmental stage. A few distributions are between 1.87-1.89, the overall contour of attentional regions are smoother or sub-parts are flat and narrow. The appearance of partial flatness at the boundary of the attentional region is a sign of consolidation, indicating the lesion is in the mend. Finally, we obtained some findings on the texture (homogeneity and heterogeneity) of the attentional regions that features for normal and lesion regions show different distributions (Figure 6 b, c) .",

I) Halo pattern and anti-halo pattern were easily formed in the attentional regions. The halo pattern was speculated to be that the lesions (mainly the central node of the lobular) infiltrated into the surrounding interstitium and developed the aggregation of inflammatory cells in the interstitium. Anti-halo pattern is of the center of the ground glass shadow, almost completely surrounding by the high-density consolidation. The appearance of this sign may be that the inflammatory repair is dominated by the edge, leading to the formation of a band shadow tending to consolidation at the edge, while the central repair is relatively slow. II) The attentional region presents pleural parallel signs. The formation mechanism was speculated as follows: when the SARS-Cov2 invaded the interstitium around the alveoli, the lymphatic return direction was subpleural and interlobular septa, and diffused into pleural side and bilateral interlobular septum [34] . Because of the limitation of the pleura at the distal end, the lymph can only cling to the pleura and spread along the reticular structure of the interlobular septal margin on both sides. In addition, the fusion of the subpleural lesions results in the long axis of the lesions parallel to the pleura. III) Vascular thickening was found in the attentional region, which was consistent with the rules of inflammation production, inflammatory stimulation, increased vascular permeability, telangiectasia, further pulmonary artery thickening [33, 35] . IV) The fine mesh feature of large area develops in the attentional region. The SARS-Cov2 mainly invades the interstitium in the lobules, so it appears as confluent fine mesh (crazy paving). V) The density of the ground-glass opacity (GGO) in the attentional regions increases, transforming to consolidation, the consolidation edges are flat or contracted, and fiber strands appear. These are all signs of disease outcome. In addition, when multiple regions of attention are recognized in the lungs of 20 .
