            "text": "Respiratory symptoms are frequently observed in children with KD during the acute phase. 5)11) Jordan-Villegas et al. 12) reported that patients with KD who carry respiratory viruses more frequently showed coronary artery dilatation and were more often diagnosed with incomplete KD. Some studies 5)10)12) determined that specific respiratory viruses were associated with KD. However, other authors insisted that the detection of viruses in KD may not have any associative implications. 13) Tissue Doppler imaging (TDI) may be a superior method to measure the Tei index in children because it is less affected by heart rate variability. 14) The myocardial performance index (Tei index) evaluates global left ventricle (LV) systolic and diastolic function. It is correlated with severity and clinical outcome in children with cardiac disease. 14) There haven't been any reports about an association between respiratory infection and cardiac function in KD patients.",

They found that NT-pro BNP is a reliable marker for the diagnosis of KD and the prediction of IVIG treatment effect. Dahdah et al. 25) reported that NT-pro BNP level was significantly higher in incomplete KD groups than in febrile patients (p<0.05). NT-pro BNP was a useful marker for the diagnosis of KD in patients less than 3 months of age. 26) Our study demonstrated that NT-pro BNP is a valuable diagnostic tool in differentiating KD from other febrile Table 2 ). The clinical manifestations of adenovirus, especially conjunctival injection, throat injection and prolonged fever, are somewhat like those of KD. KD is frequently misdiagnosed as pharyngoconjunctival fever caused by adenovirus because of the clinical similarity of the two diseases, 10) so infusion of IVIG may be delayed.
