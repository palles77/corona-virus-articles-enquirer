Although our understanding of the various etiological agents and the pathogenic mechanisms involved in various respiratory infections has increased, our ability to diagnose accurately the causative agent(s) has not kept pace. This means that often the physician initiates treatment on an empirical basis and in far too many situations antibiotics are used when the infection is viral in nature.",

These can also be thought of as infections involving the airways and the pulmonary parenchyma, respectively. Acute bronchitis is very common and can be viewed as one end of a continuum that extends from bronchitis to pneumonia. While it is generally not a particularly serious infection, it still has a considerable economic impact because of the frequency of physician visits and the fact that despite the lack of any compelling evidence supporting antimicrobial therapy, physicians who diagnose acute bronchitis prescribe antibiotics for 66% of such patients. 1 In the USA it is estimated that acute bronchitis results in approximately 12 000 000 visits to physicians per year at a cost of $200-300 million. 2 ",

However, among those with severe exacerbations requiring admission to an intensive care unit (ICU) and mechanical ventilation, these pathogens seem to be present less frequently and organisms such as H. parainfluenzae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa are more frequently found, and bacteria in this context are often resistant to antibiotics. 12, 13 In most patients treatment is begun empirically. In those with more severe underlying disease or in whom the exacerbations appear to be more serious, it may be worthwhile obtaining sputum samples for culture and susceptibility testing in order to rule out the presence of a resistant pathogen. Data are available suggesting that as the severity of the illness increases (as indicated by markers such as illness lasting longer than 10 years, more than four exacerbations per year, steroid therapy, recent antibiotics, and severe airway obstruction [FEV 1 <35% predicted]) the microbiology becomes more complex. 14, 15 On the basis of a clinical examination, it may be impossible to differentiate between an acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis and pneumonia.

Such mixed infections are well described in hospitalacquired pneumonia, where multiple pathogens are present in more than half of the nosocomial pneumonia patients studied. 30 In CAP, the incidence of mixed infections is lower, ranging from 2.7% to 13% in well-defined studies of inpatients with CAP. [31] [32] [33] The single most important etiological agent is undoubtedly Str. pneumoniae. In a meta-analysis covering a 30-year period and including 7000 cases of pneumonia in which an etiological diagnosis was made, Str. pneumoniae accounted for two-thirds of all cases and for two-thirds of fatalities. 34 At one time it was thought that atypical pathogens such as M. pneumoniae, Ch. pneumoniae and Legionella species were not important causes of pneumonia and that if they did cause infection they were usually mild and affected primarily the young. A study in 1997 of more than 2700 patients admitted to hospital with CAP ranked these pathogens second, third and fourth of all etiological agents meeting the criteria for a 'definite' diagnosis. 35 Another study described three outbreaks of Ch. pneumoniae in nursing homes with high attack and mortality rates. 36 These two studies have helped to dispel the earlier misconceptions surrounding infection with the atypical pathogens.",

The best known and most widely used prognostic tool is that of Fine. 42 This is a two-step rule designed to identify patients at low risk for mortality. Points are given based on age, coexisting disease, and abnormal physical and laboratory findings, and patients are assigned to classes 1-5 based on the total number of points assigned.

            "text": "Antimicrobial resistance among respiratory pathogens has become a major concern and it is important that clinicians understand and appreciate the general mechanisms and implications of this phenomenon. The emergence of resistance to penicillin among Str. pneumoniae isolates represents a gradual reduction in in-vitro susceptibility. The National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards defines strains for which the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of penicillin is <1 mg/L as sensitive, 1.0-2.0 mg/L as intermediate and \u22654 mg/L as resistant. 55 With Str. pneumoniae, the DNA incorporation and remodeling that results in resistance is from the DNA of closely related oral commensal bacteria (see Ch. 3). By such a process, our own flora can develop resistance when we are treated with antibiotics and pathogens such as Str. pneumoniae can subsequently acquire resistance coding DNA from our own colonizing microflora. 56 Pneumococcal resistance to \u03b2-lactams is due solely to the presence of low-affinity penicillin-binding proteins. Macrolide resistance, however, can occur either by target site modification or by an efflux pump (see Chs 3 and 22). The relative frequencies of the two mechanisms vary internationally but in North America account for approximately 45% and 55%, respectively, of resistant isolates. Reports of breakthrough pneumococcal bacteremia in patients treated with macrolides have highlighted concerns about resistance to this class of agents. 57, 58 Resistance to ciprofloxacin and to newer fluoroquinolones among pneumococcal isolates has been reported. 59 Pneumococcal resistance to fluoroquinolones may be mediated by changes in one or both target sites (topoisomerase II and IV), usually resulting from mutations in the gyrA and parC genes, respectively, and possibly also by an efflux pump (see Ch. 3). 60 Of greatest concern, however, are the multidrug-resistant isolates, those that are resistant to two or more antibiotics having different mechanisms of action. In the USA, between 1995 and 1998, the proportion of invasive pneumococcal isolates that were resistant to three or more classes of drugs increased from 9% to 14%; there also were increases in the proportions of isolates that were resistant to penicillin (21% to 25%), cefotaxime (10% to 15%), meropenem (10% to 16%), erythromycin (11% to 16%) and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (25% to 29%). These increases in frequency of resistance to multiple antimicrobial agents occurred in penicillin-resistant isolates only. 61 Drug-resistant Str. pneumoniae is associated with various risk factors including the presence of co-morbidities, such as chronic heart, lung, liver or renal disease, diabetes, alcoholism, immunosuppression or use of antimicrobials within the previous 3 months. 62 Infection with drug-resistant pneumococci results in invasive disease with higher mortality rates amongst hospitalized individuals. 63 Pathogens such as H. influenzae and the Enterobacteriaceae are also important to consider. H. influenzae is the third most common cause of CAP requiring admission to hospital and, while the Enterobacteriaceae are not particularly common, they are important because of the high mortality rates associated with them. Among such pathogens resistance is usually mediated by \u03b2-lactamases, and the highest prevalence of \u03b2-lactamase genes is found on plasmids rather than chromosomes. Members of the TEM and SHV families are the most successful of the plasmidencoded \u03b2-lactamases, and the TEM-1 \u03b2-lactamase accounts for almost 80% of all plasmid-encoded \u03b2-lactamases. 64 The extended-spectrum \u03b2-lactamases include oxyimino enzymes that are TEM and SHV mutants and cephalosporinases unrelated to TEM and SHV enzymes (see Ch. 15).",

In most patients an empirical choice must be made; however, where the infecting pathogen is known, antibiotic choice can be guided by local knowledge of antimicrobial sensitivities and policies. The correct choice of antimicrobial(s) for empirical therapy has generated considerable discussion, and a number of societies have produced guidelines to help physicians with the initial management of patients with CAP. [51] [52] [53] [54] Guidelines have served a number of useful functions. They have codified our management of patients with CAP and (at the very least) they have highlighted the gaps in our knowledge and have helped to direct future studies and research. Adherence to guidelines has had a significant pharmaco-economic effect, lowered mortality rates and shortened hospital stay. 65, 66 The joint guidelines of the IDSA and the ATS 51 make recommendations for outpatient and inpatient treatment of pneumonia, and draw a distinction between those individuals who do or do not have risk factors for drug-resistant Str. pneumoniae (DRSP) ( Table 45. 2). For outpatient treatment of previously healthy individuals with no risk factors for DRSP, these guidelines recommend a macrolide (azithromycin, clarithromycin or erythromycin) or doxycycline. In the presence of risk factors for DRSP, outpatients are recommended a 'respiratory' fluoroquinolone (moxifloxacin, gemifloxacin or levofloxacin [750 mg]) or a high dose \u03b2-lactam plus a macrolide or doxycycline. This latter recommendation also pertains to all inpatients (non-ICU). For inpatients requiring ICU treatment the IDSA/ATS guidelines recommend a \u03b2-lactam (cefotaxime, ceftriaxone or ampicillin-sulbactam) plus either azithromycin or a fluoroquinolone, except where Pseudomonas infection is suspected, in which case an antipneumococcal, antipseudomonal \u03b2-lactam (piperacillintazobactam, cefepime, imipenem or meropenem) plus either ciprofloxacin or levofloxacin (750 mg) is the recommended first-line regimen. Where community-acquired methicillinresistant Staphylococcus aureus infection is suspected to be the cause of the pneumonia, these guidelines recommend the addition of vancomycin or linezolid to the regimen.",

In cases of CAP, the predominant etiological agents are Str. pneumoniae and the atypicals (in selected cases Gram-negative rods may be encountered).

However, studies of stress ulcer prophylaxis have failed to demonstrate a definitive correlation between colonization of the stomach by bacteria and pneumonia. 74, 75 A review of the literature concluded that the stomach should be regarded as an amplifier but not as the primary source of pathogens causing pneumonia and that the oropharyngealpulmonary route is more important than the gastropulmonary route. 76 In patients who are being mechanically ventilated, the endotracheal tube plays an important role in the pathogenesis of ventilator-associated pneumonia. The tube itself breaches the upper airway defenses, and the inflated cuff allows the oropharyngeal secretions containing various pathogens to collect until they eventually pass the inflated cuff to the distal airways.

Higher ratios of peak serum concentrations to MIC (C max /MIC) have been shown to prevent the emergence of resistance during treatment with fluoroquinolones and aminoglycosides. Furthermore, aminoglycosides do not achieve high levels in lung tissue, and this problem is compounded by the fact that they are also relatively inactivated by the acidic pH present at the site of infection in the lung.",

            "text": "The approach to the management of patients with nosocomial pneumonia should take into account the risk factors, severity of illness and time of onset of the illness. 79, 80 The risk factors are for infection with specific pathogens; severity of illness is either mild to moderate or severe; time of onset refers to early versus late (i.e. < 5 or \u2265 5 days, respectively). Based upon these variables, a hierarchical approach to the patient with nosocomial pneumonia has been developed. While it is recognized that a large number of bacteria are potential pathogens, there is a 'core' group of organisms that must be considered for each patient for whom antimicrobial coverage must be provided ( 71 Other countries have produced guidelines for local use which reflect variation in the target pathogens and choice of therapy. Until the evidence base surrounding nosocomial pneumonia improves, variations in practice are likely to continue. The decision to select an agent should be based upon the host, pathogen and drug-related issues outlined earlier. A few specific issues, however, deserve comment. Single-agent therapy is recommended in many situations. Although two drugs should be used to achieve synergistic or additive activity against Ps. aeruginosa, there are no data to support the routine use of combination therapy for other bacterial pathogens in non-neutropenic patients. 81 In patients who are either severely ill with risk factors and early onset or severely ill without risk factors but with late onset, combination therapy should be instituted. If the patient was not receiving any prior antibiotics and deep suction potential pathogen recommended antibiotic a The frequency of penicillin-resistant Str. pneumoniae and multidrug-resistant Str. pneumoniae is increasing; levofloxacin or moxifloxacin is preferred to ciprofloxacin. The role of other new quinolones, such as gatifloxacin, has not been established. Adapted from the American Thoracic Society. 71",

Enterobacter spp. are among the most common causes of Gram-negative bacillary hospital-acquired pneumonia. A major concern with infection caused by this organism is that in the presence of a group 4 cephalosporin it can become a hyperproducer of \u03b2-lactamase. 82 The final issue is that of duration of therapy. Unfortunately, there are no appropriately designed randomized controlled trials that specifically address this issue. The general consensus, however, is that patients with severe infection caused by pathogens such as Ps. aeruginosa or Acinetobacter spp. should be treated for a minimum of 14 days, whereas patients with less severe infection may only require 7-10 days of treatment.

Initial antibiotic therapy should be adjusted or streamlined on the basis of microbiological data and clinical response to therapy. b If an extended spectrum \u03b2-lactamase-positive (ESBL + ) strain, such as K. pneumoniae, or an Acinetobacter species is suspected, a carbapenem is a reliable choice. If L. pneumophila is suspected, the combination antibiotic regimen should include a macrolide (e.g. azithromycin), or a fluoroquinolone (e.g. ciprofloxacin or levofloxacin) should be used rather than an aminoglycoside. c If MRSA risk factors are present or there is a high incidence locally.
