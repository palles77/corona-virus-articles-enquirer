Defects in Treg generation and/or function are closely associated with uncontrolled lymphoproliferative diseases (4) .

Consistent with this, depleting Tregs prior to allergen challenge results in increased IgE production and severe inflammation (7) . Likewise, adoptive transfer of allergen-specific Tregs prevents the development of AHR and airway inflammation (8) . There is growing evidence that Treg homeostasis and functions can be impaired during allergic inflammation. For example, circulating CD25 + Tregs in house dust mite-allergic children exhibit reduced suppressor function compared with nonasthmatic controls (9) . In bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from asthmatic patients, the proportion of Tregs is lower than that from healthy subjects, resulting in altered Treg/effector T cell ratio (10) .

            "text": "IL-27 is an IL-12 family cytokine composed of the p28 and Ebi3 subunits and produced by activated antigen presenting cells (APCs) (11, 12) . IL-27 inhibits Th2 cell differentiation both in vitro and in vivo and Th2-type cytokine production from already-polarized Th2 effector cells (13) (14) (15) . Concordantly, augmented allergic inflammation is observed in mice deficient in IL-27 receptor \u03b1 (IL-27R\u03b1), an IL-27-specific receptor subunit expressed on multiple cell types (16) . While these studies have mainly focused on the impact of IL-27 on conventional T cells, the roles of other IL-27R\u03b1 + cells such as Foxp3 + Tregs, which express higher Foxp3 + CD4 Tregs are central regulators of inflammation, including allergic inflammation in the lung. There is increasing evidence that inflammatory factors undermine adequate Treg functions and homeostasis, resulting in prolonged and exacerbated inflammation. Therefore, identifying the factors is of the utmost important. IL-27 is an antiinflammatory cytokine implicated in immune regulation and tolerance. However, the cellular mechanisms underlying IL-27-mediated immune regulation in vivo remain largely unknown. Utilizing a cockroach antigen-induced allergic inflammation model in mice, we sought to test the roles of Tregs during IL-27-mediated regulation of allergic inflammation. Intranasally delivered IL-27 significantly reduced the development of airway inflammation. Unexpectedly, the IL-27-induced reduction occurred only in the presence of Tregs. Il27ra -/and Treg-specific Il27ra -/mice developed severe airway inflammation, and IL-27 treatment had little impact on diminishing the inflammatory responses. IL-27-induced treatment was restored following transfer of WT Tregs but not of Tregs deficient in Lag3, a molecule induced by IL-27 in Tregs. Finally, Tregs from asthmatic patients exhibited blunted STAT1 phosphorylation following IL-27 stimulation. Taken together, our results uncover that Tregs are the primary target cells of IL-27 in vivo to mediate its antiinflammatory functions, suggesting that altered IL-27 responsiveness in Tregs may underlie inadequate Treg functions and perpetuation of inflammation.",

Intranasal IL-27 administration at allergen challenge significantly attenuated the development of allergic inflammation in the lung. To our surprise, the IL-27-induced inhibition was completely abolished in the absence of Tregs, suggesting that Tregs may be the key target cells of IL-27 in vivo. Indeed, adoptive Treg transfer into endogenous Treg-depleted mice fully restored IL-27-mediated inhibition of allergic inflammation. IL-27 induces the lymphocyte activation gene 3 (Lag3) in Tregs (19) , and Lag3 expression in Tregs was required for IL-27 to inhibit allergic inflammation. The findings that Treg-specific Il27ra -/mice develop severe allergic inflammation that is not attenuated by systemic IL-27 administration further support the key contribution of IL-27 in Treg functions. Lastly, Tregs isolated from asthmatic patients displayed blunted IL-27induced STAT1 phosphorylation compared with those from control subjects, suggesting that such dampened responses may underlie altered Treg functions and further asthmatic inflammation. Taken together, these results highlight a nonreplaceable contribution of Tregs during IL-27-mediated regulation of allergic inflammation in the lung.",

            "text": "Intranasal IL-27 administration attenuates CA-induced allergic airway inflammation. To test the potential of IL-27 in ameliorating experimental allergic inflammation, CA-mediated airway inflammation was induced, as shown in Figure 1A . Mice were sensitized with CA in alum adjuvant and intranasally challenged with CA in the presence or absence of IL-27. Cellular infiltration was determined 24 hours after the last challenge. Approximately >90 % of infiltrating cells in the BAL were eosinophils ( Figure 1B) . The absolute number of eosinophils in the BAL was significantly reduced in IL-27-treated mice compared with PBS-treated controls, while the numbers of neutrophils and CD4 T cells remained unchanged between the groups ( Figure 1B ). IL-27 treatment substantially diminished the number of lung infiltrating CD4 T cells and the accumulation of T cells expressing Th2-type (IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13), as well as other cytokines (IL-17, IFN-\u03b3, IL-10, and IL-2), in the lung tissues compared with PBS-treated controls ( Figure 1C ). Interestingly, the IL-27-induced effects were only seen in the inflamed target tissues because CD4 T cell levels in the draining mediastinal lymph nodes (medLN) ( Figure 1D ) and in the nondraining lymph nodes (data not shown) remained comparable. Consistent with intracellular cytokine expression, IL-27 treatment diminished IL-4 secretion in the BALF ( Figure 1E ). IL-13 is the major driver of AHR in experimental allergic airway disease, acting independently of IL-4 on smooth muscle and epithelial cells (21, 22) . Indeed, IL-13 secretion in the BALF was also reduced by the treatment ( Figure 1E ). Lung inflammation determined by H&E staining and mucus production determined by PAS staining demonstrated that IL-27 treatment substantially diminished inflammation and mucus production ( Figure 1F ). Consistently, Muc5a and Muc5b mRNA expression in the lung tissues were dramatically reduced by the IL-27 treatment ( Figure 1G ). Lung functions (i.e., airway resistance) determined by flexivent experiment further supported the IL-27-mediated attenuation of the inflammation ( Figure 1H ). Therefore, IL-27 treatment reduces the hallmarks associated with allergic airway inflammation. Of note, the proportions of T cell subsets expressing inflammatory cytokines were similar between control and IL-27-treated mice (data not shown), suggesting that IL-27 blocks expansion and tissue infiltration of inflammatory cells rather than inhibits effector cell differentiation. Mice sensitized but not challenged with CA antigen did not develop any signs of inflammation in the lung (data not shown).",

We recently reported that Foxp3 + Tregs control the development of allergic airway inflammation and that IL-27 signaling in Foxp3 + Tregs is essential to control Th17-mediated autoimmune inflammation (19, 20) . Whether Tregs are essential during IL-27-mediated inhibition of allergic airway inflammation was next examined using Foxp3 DTR mice (23) . Tregs were depleted by diphtheria toxin (DTX) injection 1 day prior to and on the first day of CA challenge ( Figure 2A ). DTX-injected B6 WT mice were used as negative controls to ensure that any effects seen following DTX injection were not due to adjuvant effects of DTX. As previously reported (20) , Treg depletion exacerbated allergic airway inflammation. The numbers of eosinophils and CD4 T cells infiltrating the airways were substantially elevated in Treg-depleted mice ( Figure  2B ). Lung-infiltrating CD4 T cells expressing inflammatory cytokines were elevated upon Treg deletion ( Figure  2C ). Interestingly, in the absence of Tregs, intranasal IL-27 treatment had no impact on downregulating inflammatory cell infiltration into the airways ( Figure 2B ) and the accumulation of cytokine-expressing effector CD4 T cells in the lung ( Figure 2C ). Similar Treg-dependent IL-27 treatment effects were also found in IL-4 and IL-13 secretion in the BALF ( Figure 2D ), as well as in lung inflammation ( Figure 2E ).",

To investigate whether Tregs are the primary targets of IL-27 to control airway inflammation in vivo, IL-27R\u03b1-deficient (Il27ra -/-) mice were utilized. Compared with WT controls, Il27ra -/mice developed severe CA-induced lung inflammation. Infiltration of inflammatory cells in the BAL and accumulation of CD4 T cells expressing inflammatory cytokines in the lung were substantially elevated in Il27ra -/mice ( Figure 3 , A and B). Interestingly, the number of neutrophils in the BAL was also increased in these mice ( Figure 3A ). Histopathological examination further revealed substantial lung inflammation in Il27ra -/mice ( Figure 3C ). As expected, intranasal IL-27 administration had no impact on downregulating inflammation ( Figure 3 , A-C). Transferring WT iTregs into Il27ra -/mice alone was sufficient to downregulate inflammatory cell infiltration in the airway ( Figure 3A) , inflammatory CD4 T cell responses in the lung ( Figure 3B ), and lung inflammation ( Figure 3C ). IL-27 cotreatment in these conditions further improved IL-27-mediated inhibition of airway inflammation ( Figure 3 , A-C). Since transferred Tregs are the only IL-27-responding cells in this system, these results suggest that Foxp3 + Tregs alone can mediate inhibitory effects of IL-27. In some experiments, the mice received 2 \u00d7 10 6 in vitro-generated Foxp3 + Tregs 2 days before antigen challenge. Mice were sacrificed 24 hours after the last challenge. (B and C) Granulocytes and CD4 T cells in the BAL (B) and cytokine expressing CD4 T cells in the lung (C) were calculated by FACS analysis. (D) IL-4 and IL-13 secretion in the BALF was determined by a CBA assay. (E) H&E staining of the lung tissues are shown (original magnification \u00d720), and histology score was determined.

To precisely determine the role of IL-27 signaling in Treg functions during allergic airway infiltration, Treg-specific Il27ra -/mice (Treg \u0394Il27ra ) were next used (19) . Treg \u0394Il27ra and littermate Treg WT control mice were induced for allergic airway inflammation. Infiltration of inflammatory cells in the BALF was significantly elevated in Treg \u0394Il27ra mice compared with that in Treg WT mice ( Figure 4A ). Lung-infiltrating CD4 T cells expressing inflammatory cytokines were more abundant in Treg \u0394Il27ra mice ( Figure 4B ). Lung tissues of Treg \u0394Il27ra mice were heavily infiltrated with inflammatory cells ( Figure 4C ). Interestingly, Treg infiltration in the lung of Treg \u0394Il27ra mice was also elevated, suggesting that IL-27 controls Treg functions but not Treg survival or trafficking ( Figure  4D ). IHC analysis further confirmed substantial Treg accumulation in the lung of Treg \u0394Il27ra mice (data not shown). To corroborate that IL-27 signaling in Tregs is instrumental in controlling inflammation, Treg \u0394Il27ra and Treg WT mice induced for allergic airway infiltration received intranasal IL-27, as shown in Figure 1 . IL-27 treatment significantly reduced the numbers of lung-infiltrating inflammatory CD4 T cells in Treg WT but not in Treg \u0394Il27ra mice ( Figure 4E ). These results strongly suggest that IL-27 signaling in Foxp3 + Tregs is essential for Treg function to control allergic airway infiltration.",

One potential mechanism by which Tregs control inflammatory responses is to suppress effector T cell proliferation (25, 26) . We thus investigated whether intranasal delivery of IL-27 suppresses T cell proliferation and whether Tregs are necessary during the process. In vivo proliferation of CD4 T cells was determined by BrdU incorporation. Foxp3 DTR mice induced for the inflammation were injected with BrdU 24 hours before sacrifice. Indeed, the percentage of BrdU + , and histology score was evaluated. The data shown represent the mean \u00b1 SD of 2 independent experiments (n = 6).

BAL, bronchoalveolar lavage; Eos, eosinophils; Neu, neutrophils; iTreg, induced Tregs. effector T cells in the lung was significantly reduced in IL-27-treated mice compared with PBS-treated controls ( Figure 5A ). Interestingly, Treg proliferation itself was also reduced by IL-27 treatment ( Figure  5A ). Upon Treg depletion, effector T cell proliferation was dramatically increased and IL-27 completely lost its inhibitory functions to interfere with effector T cell proliferation, as BrdU incorporation of effector T cells remained increased ( Figure 5A ). Surface expression of molecules implicated in Treg suppression, including ICOS, Nrp1, CD39, and CD73, remained unchanged by IL-27 treatment, suggesting that IL-27 regulates Treg functions by a mechanism independent of these molecules ( Figure 5B ). We recently reported that lung-infiltrating effector CD4 T cells express ICOS and Nrp1 and that the expression correlates with the extent of activation (20) . Concordantly, their expression in effector cells was also reduced by IL-27, while dramatically increased by Treg depletion, regardless of IL-27 ( Figure 5B ). Tregs can exert suppressive function by inactivating APCs (27) . However, we found that surface expression of costimulatory molecules such as CD80, CD86, and ICOS ligand on CD11c + CD11b + and CD11c -CD11b + cells in the lung remained unchanged by IL-27 stimulation (Supplemental Figure 1 ; supplemental material available online with this article; https://doi.org/10.1172/jci.insight.123216DS1).",

To test whether Lag3 expression on Tregs is necessary during IL-27-mediated inhibition of allergic airway inflammation, in vitro-generated Lag3 -/-iTregs were transferred into Treg-depleted mice, followed by intranasal IL-27 treatment. While IL-27 administration significantly diminished inflammatory cell recruitment in the airway of WT Treg recipients, IL-27 treatment failed to do so in Lag3 -/-Treg recipients ( Figure 6A) . Similarly, the accumulation of inflammatory CD4 T cells in the lung was substantially reduced following IL-27 treatment in WT but not in Lag3 -/-Treg recipients ( Figure 6B ), suggesting that Lag3 is indeed a mediator of IL-27 functions for Tregs to control allergic inflammation. In support, Lag3 expression on lung-infiltrating Foxp3 + Tregs was substantially lower in Treg \u0394Il27ra compared with that in Treg WT mice, whereas lung infiltrating effector CD4 T cells expressed comparable levels of Lag3 ( Figure 6C ). Treg-derived IL-10 is considered a key mediator of Treg function (29) . However, we found that IL-10 expression both on lung-infiltrating Foxp3 + Tregs as well as effector CD4 T cells was comparable between Treg \u0394Il27ra and Treg WT mice ( Figure 6C) .

Based on the results that IL-27 stimulation of Tregs is essential for Treg functions to control inflammatory responses, we hypothesize that Tregs from asthmatic patients may exhibit intrinsically altered IL-27 responses, which may affect their adequate function. Since IL-27 delivers its activation signal through phosphorylation of both STAT1 and STAT3 (30-34), we compared IL-27-induced pSTAT1 and pSTAT3 expression ex vivo utilizing Tregs and conventional CD4 T cells isolated from asthmatic patients and control donors. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were incubated with or without IL-27 for the indicated durations. Phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT3 in human Tregs (CD4 + CD25 + CD127 -) and conventional CD4 T cells (CD4 + CD25 -CD127 + ) was determined by flow cytometry. IL-27-induced STAT1 phosphorylation in patient Tregs was significantly reduced compared with that in control donor Tregs ( Figure 7A ). STAT3 phosphorylation seemed slightly lower in patient Tregs, although the difference did not reach statistical significance. Interestingly, conventional CD4 T cells from asthmatic patients also exhibited similarly lower levels of STAT1 and STAT3 phosphorylation compared with control donors ( Figure 7A ). Different susceptibility to IL-27-induced STAT phosphorylation was not due to IL-27 receptor expression level, as the level of the receptor expression was comparable between the groups, regardless of T cell types ( Figure  7B) . Notably, the patient samples analyzed in this study were all from females (4 severe and 2 nonsevere asthmatics), while the control samples were from both sexes (2 females and 4 males). However, pSTAT1 upregulation in female patient Tregs was lower when compared with that in female or male controls (data not shown). We did not notice sex differences in pSTAT expression within control samples. Moreover, pSTAT expression was comparable between severe and nonsevere asthmatics. Taken together, these results demonstrate that Tregs from asthmatic patients exhibit intrinsic defects of STAT1 and STAT3 phosphorylation in response to IL-27 stimulation, possibly contributing to inadequate regulatory functions of Tregs.",

However, we did not find evidence that IL-27 treatment increases the generation of IL-10 + CD4 T cells in vivo. Instead, accumulation of IL-10 + CD4 T cells in the lung was rather decreased after IL-27 administration, and the reduction was dependent on Tregs. While IL-27 is a potent inducer of IL-10 expression in activated T cells in vitro (51, 52) , whether IL-27 is equally capable of doing so in vivo is less clear. IL-27-Fc administered after collagen-induced arthritis induction ameliorates the disease severity and incidence; however, IL-10producing cells remained unchanged by the treatment (53) . Unlike an in vitro cell culture system, there are multiple cell types potentially competing for IL-27 in vivo, among which Foxp3 + Tregs may be favored targets of IL-27. While it is formally possible that the absence of Tregs would then allow other target cells to respond to IL-27, severe inflammation in Treg-specific Il27ra -/mice and the inability of IL-27 to prevent the inflammation in this condition strongly suggest that IL-27 signaling in Tregs, but not in effector T cells, is the main pathway through which IL-27 mediates its function in vivo.",

Liu et al. reported that delayed production of IL-27 limits immunopathology and dampens Th1/Th17 immune responses via IL-10-dependent and -independent pathways, while preserving defense during influenza virus infection (54) . Likewise, Hunter and colleagues reported that endogenous IL-27 regulates Th2-biased immune responses during respiratory paramyxovirus infection (55) . However, these reports did not identify the precise target cells of IL-27 for the protective functions. Pyle et al. demonstrated, using respiratory syncytial virus infection models, that IL-27 produced in the airways following the infection promotes local Treg functions to dampen virus-specific T cell immunity and that IL-27 is a key cytokine to induce molecules associated with Treg-suppressive function, including KLRG1 and GITR (56) . These findings fit very well with the current study that Tregs are important target cells of IL-27, although Lag3 was not found to be induced by IL-27. The discrepancy may be due to the model systems used.",

            "text": "It was previously reported that CD4 T cells from asthmatic patients display impaired STAT1 phosphorylation in response to IL-27 stimulation (57), which is likely attributed to upregulated Socs3 expression by IL-4 stimulation. Similarly, we observed poor STAT1 phosphorylation in CD4 T cells from asthmatic patients after ex vivo IL-27 stimulation. We also found that IL-27-induced STAT1 phosphorylation in Tregs is severely impaired. IL-27 also activates STAT3 pathway, and the IL-27/STAT3 axis has previously been shown to be critical for IL-27-induced proliferation (30) , PD-L1 expression (32) , and inhibition of inducible Treg development (31) . STAT3 phosphorylation in response to IL-27 stimulation was somewhat diminished in conventional CD4 T cells and Tregs from asthmatic patients, although the extent of reduction was less obvious than that of pSTAT1. Given that surface expression of the IL-27R was comparable between the patients and control subjects, the proximal signaling events involving STAT phosphorylation may be selectively impaired in patients. Impaired IL-27-mediated activation in Tregs of asthmatic patients may be responsible for their inadequate regulatory functions, which then perpetuate inflammatory responses. It will be important to explore the molecular basis underlying the defects of IL-27 signaling in different cell types of asthmatics versus control subjects. IL-27 production is increased in asthmatic patients, and there seems to be a combined effect between IL-27 with the chemokine CCL26/CXCL9 expression, which could identify a more severe asthma phenotype (58) . Increased IL-27 production in severe asthma may be the secondary effect resulted from robust inflammatory reactions. It is possible that the magnitude of IL-27 production may have different effects on various target cells and further on the development of allergic inflammation.",
