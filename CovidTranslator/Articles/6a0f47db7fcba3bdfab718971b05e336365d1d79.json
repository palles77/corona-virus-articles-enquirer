            "text": "moderate exercise (eg, 50% of maximal capacity) and platelet adhesion reduces with regular exercise. Although blood pressure often rises acutely during exercise, this response is attenuated by regular exercise. 10 Because reduction of peripheral vascular resistance was thought to be the principal mechanism for acutely lowering blood pressure with exercise, a reduction in cardiac output, stroke volume, and left ventricular end-diastolic volume were found to account for much of the acute blood pressure reduction after exercise in older people with hypertension. 12 Regular exercise improves myocardial contractility and coronary perfusion. In fact, exercise improves arterial compliance and endothelial function, in general. It is thought that greater sheer stress with exercise enhances synthesis of nitric oxide from endothelial cells. This nitric oxide might also slow the development of atherosclerosis, as well as reducing the risk of acute coronary events by relaxing smooth muscle and inhibiting the proliferation of smooth muscle, platelet aggregation, and leucocyte adhesion to vessel walls. 13 Regular moderate exercise can also reverse left ventricular hypertrophy. 10 Despite modest long-term compliance, advice to exercise has been shown to be effective and cost effective at increasing overall exercise levels for at least 12 months, without adverse effects. 14 For the people who can comply, adding exercise prescriptions to the management of hypertension has the extra value of reducing drug-related costs and adverse effects, and at the same time improving cardiovascular risk. Thus the recommended exercise prescription for lowering blood pressure in hypertensive patients can be tailored, and can involve any intermittent or continuous aerobic activity of at least 30 min a day, three or more times a week.",

            "text": "On May 23, 2005, the 58th World Health Assembly, consisting of the 192 Member States of WHO, adopted the revised International Health Regulations (IHR), the code of international regulations for the control of transboundary infectious diseases. 1 The spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome illustrated the rapidity with which a new infectious disease can spread and affect today's interconnected world. The deliberate release of anthrax in the aftermath of the events of Sept 11, 2001 , highlighted another dimension of microbial threats. Neither event was adequately addressed in the previous IHR of 1969. 2 The key constraints of IHR (1969) were the limited scope of diseases (cholera, plague, yellow fever), the dependence on official notification to WHO by affected countries, the scarcity of mechanisms for collaboration in investigating such outbreaks, and the lack of specific riskreduction measures to prevent the international spread of disease. Indeed, there was disincentive to reporting under the IHR because unaffected countries applied travel and trade restrictions far in excess of the true risks of the disease. The new IHR 2005 goes some way toward addressing these issues by establishing expert panels to review the risks to international public health and recommend evidence-based control measures. However, even the revised IHR show an inevitable compromise between national sovereignty and the collective international good; of trying to ensure the maximum security against the international spread of disease with minimum interference to travel and trade.",

In 2000, the WHO Department of Communicable Diseases Surveillance and Response in Geneva initiated the formation of the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN), 5 which provides the operational and technical response arm for control of global outbreaks. In 2000-04, GOARN responded to 34 events in 26 countries, and has grown to a partnership of over 120 institutions and networks, including UN and intergovernmental organisations. The Network provided substantial support to affected countries during the outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome and in response to avian influenza. It was clear that the IHR (1969) also needed to change to allow response to contemporary threats to international health. Efforts towards achieving this response began in 1995. 6 The purpose and scope of the IHR (2005) are to prevent, protect against, control, and provide a public-health response to the international spread of disease in ways that are commensurate with and restricted to publichealth risks, while avoiding unnecessary interference with international traffic and trade. The IHR (2005) affirm the continuing importance of WHO's role in global outbreak alert and response to public-health events. The revised IHR spell out the responsibilities for WHO, other international agencies with a mandate to protect public health (including radiation health and chemical safety), and the Member States themselves.",

Importantly, WHO can now use a range of sources of health intelligence to raise an alarm and begin a process of verification with countries that have not voluntarily reported significant health events. Parties capitalised to the IHR are required to inform WHO within 24 h of the receipt of evidence of a public-health risk that might cause international spread of a disease.

The problems currently faced in confronting the threat to human and animal health posed by the outbreaks of avian influenza A H5N1 in Asia amply illustrate this contention.

            "text": "The nomenclature of epileptic seizures has always been confusing. Many historic terms, still in use by the public and even by some physicians, convey little information about the anatomy or physiology of the event. \"Grand mal\" and \"petit mal\" are hardly preferable to the simpler \"big\" and \"little\". In 1965 the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) formed a commission to develop improved terminology, which led to the International Classification of Epileptic Seizures (ICES), last revised in 1981. 1 This document was supplemented in 1989 by the International Classification of Epilepsies and Epilepsy Syndromes, 2 which takes into account causation and other clinical features. In the ICES scheme, the fundamental dichotomy is between \"partial\" seizures (arising in a focal area of the brain) and \"generalised seizures\" (\"those in which the first clinical changes indicate initial involvement of both hemispheres\"). 1 Despite decades of effort, the ICES terms remain hard to explain to Naming seizures",
