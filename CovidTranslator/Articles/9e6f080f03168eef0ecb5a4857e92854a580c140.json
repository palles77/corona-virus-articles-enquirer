            "text": "Objectives: To determine paediatric emergency department (ED) staff perceptions of the effectiveness and practice of infection control measures against a novel virulent pathogen. Methods: All medical staff of the paediatric ED in a tertiary medical centre completed a written questionnaire near the onset of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak. Level of concern regarding SARS, and perceptions of effectiveness and use of infection control measures were assessed on a 5 point scale. Statistical analysis was performed using x 2 test and one way analysis of variance with significance at p,0.05. Results: Response rate was 97% (116/120). All scores were given out of 5 possible points. Using isolation rooms (mean score 4.6), wearing a mask when examining patients (4.5) , and handwashing (4.5) were considered most effective. Staff physicians reported handwashing more than nurses and trainees (4.9 v 4.5 and 4.5, respectively; p,0.05) while other measures were reported equally. Respondents considering SARS a high public health threat reported higher compliance with handwashing (4.8 v 4.4), always wearing a mask (3.9 vs 3.2) and gloves (3.6 v 2.9) in the ED (p,0.05), but not eye protection (3.4 v 3.0), gown use (4.9 v 4.7), or wearing a mask when examining patients (5.0 v 4.8). Staff who considered combined infection control measures effective in protecting patients and healthcare workers did not report increased compliance. Conclusions: Eye protection was perceived as only moderately effective in protecting against the spread of SARS, and reported compliance was relatively poor among ED staff. Concern of SARS as a public health threat rather than perceived effectiveness of infection control measures appears to have a greater impact on compliance. S evere acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a new illness, 1 which caused significant morbidity and mortality over several months in 2003. One case series from Hong Kong revealed a 23.2% admission rate to the intensive care unit due to respiratory failure, with 13.8% of the patients requiring mechanical ventilation support. 2 Based on Canadian data, the case fatality rate is estimated at 9% of suspect or probable cases. 3 There is strong evidence that a novel coronavirus is the infectious agent causing SARS. [4] [5] [6] [7] SARS is thought to spread by droplet transmission and fomites, although limited airborne transmission cannot be excluded. 1 8 9 Healthcare workers and their close contacts are at particular risk. 1 8-11 The origin of SARS can be traced to the Guangdong province of China. Owing to globalisation and relative ease of travelling, the illness spread internationally. Canada has been among the most heavily affected countries worldwide, with the highest number of probable cases outside Asia, the vast majority in the Greater Toronto area. 12 13 After identification of an index case, 8 the government of Ontario declared SARS a provincial emergency 14 and implemented a rigorous infection control plan for all hospitals in the Greater Toronto area in an attempt to stop the chain of infection. 15 To date, no study has examined healthcare workers' perceptions of the effectiveness of infection control measures during an outbreak of a virulent unidentified pathogen. Interviews of healthcare workers at a major Toronto hospital suggest that working conditions during the SARS outbreak were significantly different from usual, with fear, anxiety, anger, and frustration being commonly reported. 16 The purpose of this study was to determine tertiary paediatric emergency department (ED) staff perceptions of the effectiveness of infection control measures against a novel virulent pathogen near the onset of an evolving outbreak.",

Postponing staff meetings and educational sessions seems prudent where healthcare workers are known to be at particular risk of infection and can act as vectors for disease transmission. 1 6 8 11 Medical staff often work while ill, 22 and many become infected with viruses such as RSV 23 and gastroenteritis 24 in the workplace. Excluding symptomatic staff is not sufficient where viruses such as influenza can spread prior to the onset of illness. 25 Wearing a mask at all times in the ED was also perceived as ineffective. While most SARS infections have been linked to close contact, some have been transmitted over greater distances than that expected with large droplet spread. 1 8 9 Wearing a mask at all times in high risk areas such as the ED therefore seems crucial to protect against a pathogen with possible airborne spread.",

Nurses gave higher ratings of effectiveness for nearly all infection control measures. Why differences of opinion existed between staff physicians, nurses, and trainees remains to be determined. Nursing staff may have benefited from a more organised dissemination of information regarding infection control measures. Alternatively, staff physicians and trainees may have been more guarded in their ratings of infection control measures at a time when many healthcare workers were being diagnosed with SARS despite the use of such precautions, and the number of cases in Toronto was continuing to rise at an alarming rate.
