The etiological agent is the classical swine fever virus (CSFV), a small, enveloped, positive-sense, and single-stranded RNA virus belonging to the family Flaviviridae (1) . Due to the ethical and economic consequences of controlling CSF outbreaks in the European Union (EU) through a stamping-out policy, there is an urgent need for the development of alternative control strategies, such as marker vaccines (2, 3) . Vaccination with live attenuated C-strain vaccines can protect against CSF before the appearance of a neutralizing antibody response but not before virus-specific gamma interferon (IFN-\u2425)secreting cells appear in the peripheral blood (4) . Studies have suggested that C-strain CSFV is a potent inducer of type I T-cell responses, which may play a role in the protection afforded in the absence of antibody responses (5) (6) (7) . An improved understanding of the cellular immune mechanisms triggered by the C-strain vaccine would therefore aid in the development of the next generation of CSFV marker vaccines.",

            "text": "Little is known about the contribution of porcine NK and \u2425\u2426 T cells in the cellular immune response against CSFV. Their activation/inhibition might be crucial, given that swine possess only a small number of cytotoxic T cells but large numbers of lymphocytes with innate cytotoxic activity, especially \u2425\u2426 T cells (8) . In young pigs, \u2425\u2426 T cells and NK cells represent 50% and 10% of the total peripheral blood lymphocyte population, respectively, although their frequencies decrease with age (8, 9) . It is well known that NK cells possess the ability to attack pathogen-infected and malignant cells and to produce immunostimulatory cytokines, such as IFN-\u2425 and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u2423) (9) . Spe-cifically, NK cells are triggered to kill or ignore transformed or pathogen-infected cells, depending on a balance of inhibitory and activating signals received through ligands on potential target cells (10) . Although some pathogens can directly activate NK cells, such as influenza virus activation of human NK cells through hemagglutinin-NKp46 receptor binding (11) or murine cytomegalovirus-activating NK cells via the m157 glycoprotein-Ly49 receptor interaction (12) , the activation of these cells by most pathogens seems to be initiated by antigen-presenting cells (APCs), which provide both indirect (cytokines) and direct (contact-dependent) signals (13) . The cross talk between NK cells and dendritic cells (DCs) may also be bidirectional, and IL-2-activated human NK cells can directly induce the maturation of DCs, thereby enhancing their ability to stimulate naive T cells (14) . Porcine NK cells were originally defined by a CD3 \u03ea CD8\u2423 \u03e9 perforin \u03e9 CD2 \u03e9 CD16 \u03e9 phenotype (8, 9) . Similar to the NK cells from other species, porcine NK cells may be activated with IL-2 or IL-15 or synergistically with interleukin-12 (IL-12) and IL-18, which in addition to inducing cytokine and cytotoxic responses, increase the expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II, which is normally found at low levels in resting NK cells (15, 16) , suggesting that MHC class II may serve as a marker of activated NK cells, as has been proposed for porcine T cells (9) . Cytokine-induced activation of porcine NK cells has been shown to enhance the killing of virus-infected cells (16) . The recent development of monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) against porcine NKp46 unexpectedly revealed both NKp46 \u03e9 and NKp46 \u03ea NK cells in the blood, with NKp46 \u03e9 cells showing capacity for enhanced IFN-\u2425 expression (17) . While absent from the blood, a third NK cell population with a CD8\u2423 \u03ea/low NKp46 high phenotype has been described in porcine spleens, with high cytolytic and cytokine expression capacity (18) . Studies of the role of porcine NK cells in the response to viral infection are limited, but there are data showing that porcine NK cell responses are impaired following infection with foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) (19) and porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) (20, 21) . One study was conducted in the context of virulent CSFV infection and similarly showed diminished NK cell cytolytic activity following the onset stage of disease (22) . Several studies have reported the effects of a related flavivirus, hepatitis C virus (HCV), on human NK cells. Human NK cell activity can be directly inhibited by the recombinant HCV core protein (23) and by the structural protein E2 (24) . The HCV nonstructural protein 5A (NS5A) is able to impair human NK cell activity indirectly by inducing monocytes to secrete cytokines that result in the downregulation of NKG2D expression on NK cells (25) . This inhibition of NK cells, which occurs early in infection, would allow HCV to establish a replicative advantage prior to the induction of the specific immune response and would also destroy NK-DC cross talk, impairing the DC-mediated priming of CD8 \u03e9 cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses (26) .",

They are able to release perforin and granzymes to kill infected or malignant cells (28) . They can produce cytokines involved in the protection against viruses and other intracellular pathogens (IFN-\u2425 and TNF-\u2423), extracellular parasites (IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13), extracellular bacteria (IL-17), or immunoregulation (transforming growth factor beta [TGF-\u2424] and IL-10) (27) . The activation of \u2425\u2426 T cells can be direct or indirect, mediated by the interaction with APCs, such as DCs (29) . Moreover, in humans and pigs, it has been shown that \u2425\u2426 T cells not only interact with DCs but also display characteristics of professional APCs themselves (30, 31) . In swine, \u2425\u2426 T cells can express both CD8\u2423 and MHC-II molecules, which have been proposed to be markers of porcine T-cell activation (9) , and it has been reported that a subpopulation of circulating porcine \u2425\u2426 T cells is able to present antigens to memory helper T cells through MHC-II (31) . \u2425\u2426 T-cell responses to CSFV have not been described; however, in HCVinfected patients, \u2425\u2426 T cells from the liver, but not blood, are able to be expanded in vitro after exposure to cytokines, and it is thought that \u2425\u2426 T cells are activated through the cross-linking of CD81, which binds the HCV structural protein E2 with high affinity (32) .",

However, we hypothesize that these cells play an important role in the lymphoid tissues by contributing to protection at the sites of primary infection and by shaping the T-cell response against the virus. Similar to HCV infection, we might find evidence of cellular activation at the local tissue level, which in the case of CSFV would be the tonsils, as well as in the lymph nodes that drain the oronasal cavity. To explore both the direct and indirect effects, we investigated the interaction of NK and \u2425\u2426 T cells with CSFV virions and CSFV-infected DC populations in vitro, and we extended these findings to an ex vivo analysis of NK and \u2425\u2426 T cells in the tonsils and retropharyngeal lymph nodes from pigs vaccinated with C-strain and/or challenged with virulent CSFV.",

A comparison of the viral loads in these tissues confirmed that the challenge control pigs had significantly larger amounts of viral RNA present on day 5 postchallenge (Fig. 5) . Concomitant with the increased viral loads, we also found that by day 5 postchallenge, the unvaccinated and challenged pigs showed increased numbers of IFN-\u2423-expressing cells, primarily in the interfollicular areas of the tonsils (Fig. 6A) , as well as high levels of type I IFN circulating in serum (Fig. 6B) .",

In response to CSFV infection, the mDCs released significantly smaller amounts of IFN-\u2423 compared to that of pDCs, which is most likely due to the inhibition of the type I IFN induction cascade by CSFV N pro -induced proteasomal degradation of interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) (36) (37) (38) . By virtue of their utilization of IRF7 instead of IRF3, pDCs possess a functional type I IFN response to CSFV infection, although it was recently shown that N pro also interacts with IRF7 and reduces the capacity of pDCs to produce IFN-\u2423 (39) . While IFN-\u2423 is the prototypic antiviral cytokine, it also plays an important immunoregulatory role, enhancing both innate and adaptive immune responses (40) . Moreover, it is well known that IFN-\u2423 can upregulate MHC-II on professional APCs, although there are few reports demonstrating that it can induce expression on nonconventional APCs (41) . For the first time, we report this effect of IFN-\u2423 on two nonconventional APCs, NK and \u2425\u2426 T cells, in pigs. Future work should address whether this effect is mediated specifically by particular porcine IFN-\u2423 subtypes or whether other type I IFNs may also play a role. Seventeen different porcine IFN-\u2423 subtypes have been defined (42) .

Indeed, the activated phenotype was observed in tissues with both the highest levels of CSFV infection and IFN-\u2423-secreting cells, which Enriched NK and \u2425\u2426 T cells were cocultured with attenuated C-strain or virulent Brescia strain CSFV or with culture supernatants from enriched blood DCs previously infected with the two strains (A). To determine whether pDCs or mDCs were responsible for this effect, enriched NK and \u2425\u2426 T cells were cocultured with attenuated C-strain or virulent Brescia strain CSFV, alone or together with sorted pDCs or mDCs, at a ratio 2:1 (B). A mock virus-infected cryolysate supernatant was used as a negative control. Twenty-four hours postculture, the expression of MHC-II was assessed on NK and \u2425\u2426 T cells by flow cytometry. The mean \u03ee SEM data from three independent experiments utilizing different animals are shown.

It is likely that virulent CSFV infection of pDCs is responsible for the type I IFN response, since it has been described that pDCs rapidly increase in numbers in the tonsils following CSFV infection accompanied with high levels of IFN-\u2423 (43) . While there was little evidence for MHC-II upregulation associated with C-strain infection in vivo, our results did show a C-strain-mediated response in vitro. This may be explained by the more limited replication of C-strain in vivo and/or a failure of pDCs to traffic to the tonsils, resulting in the reduced type I IFN levels observed. Alternatively, it is possible that some form of immune regulation is induced by C-strain infection, such as IL-10 induction, which may inhibit the pDC-mediated type I IFN response (44) . Moreover, it has recently been shown that the interaction of pDCs with CSFV-infected cells induces greater IFN-\u2423 production than that from direct infection of pDCs (45) ; therefore, the ability of virulent CSFV strains to rapidly replicate in macrophages and mDCs may potentiate the IFN-\u2423 response by pDCs in the lymphoid tissues. This exacerbated type I IFN response to CSFV mediated by pDCs has been hypothesized as a key driver of the pathogenesis of CSF, including the hallmark trait of leukopenia (46, 47) . A novel subset of porcine NK cells expressing high levels of NKp46 and low levels of CD8\u2423 has recently been described in the spleen, with a highly activated status (18) ; future analyses should assess whether this population resides in other secondary lymphoid tissues, such as the tonsils, and determine if they show evidence of activation following infection with C-strain and/or virulent CSFV.",

A previous study reported that porcine \u2425\u2426 T cells were able to acquire a phenotype similar to that of professional APCs after vaccination against foot-andmouth disease (FMD), and these cells were able to process and present soluble antigen to CD4 \u03e9 T cells, likely modulating the outcome of the adaptive immune response (48) . Human \u2425\u2426 T cells have also been described as gaining APC function following contact with microbes, enabling them to induce conventional CD4 \u03e9 and CD8 \u03e9 T-cell responses (30) . It has been suggested that \u2425\u2426 T cells act as APCs only in the initiation of proinflammatory immune responses, and they are not able to substitute DCs in controlling self-tolerance and immune regulation (30) . The ability of NK cells to express MHC-II after interaction with DCs has been described in mice. Nakayama et al. (49) observed that NK cell acquisition of MHC-II was mediated by intercellular membrane transfer from interacting DCs and that NK cells also acquired costimulatory molecules, such as CD80 and CD86, from DCs through a process of trogocytosis. However, in the present study, we observed that both the recombinant cytokines and superna-tants derived from CSFV-infected pDC cultures induced the upregulation of MHC-II on NK cells, suggesting that this was a consequence of de novo expression of MHC-II by the stimulated cells rather than via \"cross-dressing.\" An assessment of MHC class II transcription levels following NK cell stimulation may help elucidate whether the observed upregulation of surface expression is due to trogocytosis. Interestingly, MHC-II-dressed NK cells have and retropharyngeal lymph nodes were collected longitudinally following C-strain vaccination and challenge 5 days later with CSFV Brescia strain.

CSFV infection of blood-derived pDCs and mDCs induces the maturation of these cells, as assessed by an increase in costimulatory molecule expression (J. C. Edwards and S. P. Graham, unpublished data), and in addition to type I IFN, DCs secrete a range of other cytokines, such as IL-2 and IL-12, with the capacity to activate NK and \u2425\u2426 T cells. Studies of HCV, another member of the Flaviviridae family, have shown that several viral proteins, core, E2, and NS5A, can either directly or indirectly, in the case of NS5A, inhibit human NK cell activation (23) (24) (25) . Since NK cells may also play an important role in the induction of T-cell responses via a reciprocal activating cross talk with DCs, these inhibitory mechanisms may offer the virus a significant advantage in evading immune responses at several levels. However, since we saw a lack of complete activation of NK cells with both C-strain and virulent CSFV, the upregulation of perforin, or the secretion of IFN-\u2425, it is unlikely that this has a negative impact on T-cell induction in vivo, since C-strain induces a virus-specific T-cell response that is undetectable in virulent-CSFV-infected animals (6, 7, 33, 50) . In summary, CSFV induced a partial activation of NK and \u2425\u2426 T cells, as characterized by MHC-II upregulation, which appeared to be mediated by type I IFN produced by infected pDCs in vitro and was most clearly observed in the tissues with high viral loads and accompanying circulating type I IFN. The current data failed to show that these cells gained antiviral effector functions, and it therefore appears unlikely that either population contributes directly to the rapid protection conferred by C-strain CSFV. Further studies should assess cytokine and cytotoxic functions at later time points following interaction with infected DCs and determine whether MHC-II-bearing NK and \u2425\u2426 T cells can function as APCs or rather might inhibit DC-induced T-cell responses against CSFV.",

Serum and tonsils were collected longitudinally following C-strain vaccination and challenge 5 days later with CSFV Brescia strain. Cells expressing IFN-\u2423 were enumerated in the interfollicular areas (closed symbols) and follicles (open symbols) of the tonsils by immunohistochemistry (A), and the levels of type I IFN in serum were determined using an Mx/CAT reporter gene assay (B). The data represent the mean of 3 pigs/group \u03ee SEM. Statistical analyses were performed using a one-way ANOVA",
