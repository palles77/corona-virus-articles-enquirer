The drug did not affect DNA replication of herpes simplex virus. Inhibition of consecutive HCMV DNA synthesis was also observed tbltowing delayed addition of the drug within 12-24 hours postinfeetion, but was fully reversible upon its removal. Viral replication proceeded, however, without impairment in cultures treated with monensin prior to infection. Induction of viral DNA polymerase activity was not impeded by the inhibitor. Analysis of protein-and glyeoprotein synthesis revealed that monensin interfered with the production of a number of HCMV-speeifie polypeptides. Furthermore, evidence was obtained that the drug may hinder intraeellular transport of a 135 kd glyeopolypeptide.",

            "text": "The ionophore monensin, an antibiotic from streptomyces cinnamonensis, has found wide application recently for the study of the biosynthesis of viral glyeoproteins (13, 14, 21, 38) . Although there is evidence for its multiple sites of action (33) this compound apparently does not interfere, like e.g. tunieamyein, with the primary steps of glyeosylation but with glyeoprotein transport within the golgi apparatus and thus with the later stages of their processing (36). For enveloped viruses this mode of action implicates a significant reduction of release of progeny ~us from infected cells (14, 24) . In addition, assembly may be affected of those viruses which bud from the outer plasma membran (12, 15) . With regard to the herpesviruses which receive their envelope at the nuclear and inner cytoplasmic membranes (ll) most authors agree that monensin mainly affects viral egress whereas viral morphogenesis is hardly impaired (13, 14) . Furthermore, the expression in the presence of monensin of herpes simplex virusinduced surface membrane antigens as targets for immunolysis is either reduced or abolished (22, 42) while it appears to be unimpaired in bovine herpes virus-infected cells (38) .",

To prove this conjecture parallel cultures (5 \u00d7 106 cells) of infected HFF were subjected to drug treatment and pulse labelled with 35Smethionine (Fig. 4 A) or with tritiated sugars (Fig. 5 ) from 60-72 hours p.i, At the concentrations used monensin prevented the virus-mediated increase in precursor uptake, i.e. the specific radioactivities of the protein samples from drug-treated infected cells equaled those from uninfected cells in the case of 35S-methionine-labelled extracts (approximately 1500 cpm 35S/Ixg protein), and were decreased to about 50 and 20 per cent, respectively, of those of the control cells following labelling with tritiated sugars (390 and 830 epm 3H/txg protein for aH-mannose-and 3H-glueosamine-labelled extracts, respectively). Analysis by SDS-PAGE and fluorography revealed for the methionine-labelled extracts that monensin inhibited synthesis of the most prominent polypeptides (Fig. 4 A, lanes b and e) of 135 and 67 kilo-daltons (kd) which are assumed to represent known major viral proteins (23, 35, 40) . As compared to the cultures exposed to PAA (Fig. 4 A, lane e; 30) monensin treatment also prevented labelling of polypeptides of about 100 and 50 kd (Fig. 4 A, lanes e and e) . These observations were essentiMly verified a n d e x t e n d e d by immunoblotting of the s a m p l e s with h u m a n HCMV-specific r e e o n v a l e s e e n t sera (Fig. 4 B) .

Immunoblotting (Fig. 6 B) with HCMAT-specific antisera of the extracts from chased cultures again revealed decreased amounts in the presence of monensin of viral polypeptides of 130 and 140 kd (see above), but did not support the assumption from the parallel tluorogram (Fig. 6A ) that monensin affected the intraceHular transport of a I35 kd virus-specific product.",

In addition, monensin showed no inhibitory effect on viral DNA synthesis in HSV-infected HFF. ii) Analysis of the irrfiuence of monensin on viral polypeptide synthesis as determined by precursor incorporation and immunblotting favors a relatively selective ettect which is particularly obvious when a protocol of delayed drug addition was used (e.g. Fig. 6 B) .

Monensin prevented appearance of radioactive bands at the high molecular weight position (150-160 kd) as well as in the 130 and 100 kd position, but again allowed some uptake into a glycopolypeptide of 85/90 kd. In view of Pereira's elaborate analysis of the polymorphism of HCMV-speeific glycoproteins (25) which was performed also using reducing conditions for electrophoretic analysis, gp 140 and 85/90 whose synthesis appears unimpaired in the presence of monensin, may represent partially processed immature forms of gpA (A~, A3) and gpB (B2), respectively. The recent repots of RAs~VSSE~ et al. (32) and B~TT and AUGER (2) support the view that maturation of the gpA complex involves cleavage of complexed precursors.

As for the particular inhibitory effect of monensin on viral DNA synthesis which distinguishes HCMV from HSV, the underlying mechanism is difficult to assess. Previous observations on prevention of HCMV DNA synthesis by glycosylation inhibitors (28, 39) , as well as the findings described here suggest that glyeosylated products participate in the control of viral DNA synthesis. Our observation that monensin impedes synthesis of several virus-specific polypeptides including structural proteins may thus reflect a secondary effect of the drug. It appears pertinent in this context to define the specificity (host-or virus-specific) of the 135 kd gp whose intraeellular distribution is affected by monensin. Analysis of glyeoprotein processing in serum-stimulated HFF whose DNA synthesis is equally sensitive to the action of monensin is hoped to shed light on this question.",
