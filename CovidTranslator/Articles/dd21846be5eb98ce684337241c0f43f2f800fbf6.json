As of March 18, 2020, nearly 210 thousand cases of COVID-19 have been confirmed in more than 100 countries and regions around the world 1 . Phosphorus is one of the essential major elements in the human body. It plays an important role in the phospholipid bilayer that makes up the cell membrane of the body, participates in the synthesis and energy metabolism of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), regulates the enzymatic reaction, and forms a buffer system to maintain acid-base balance in the body 2 Since the outbreak of the epidemic, the situation of blood phosphorus in severe/critically ill patients of COVID-19 has not been reported.

In our study, serum phosphorus levels were lower than normal in 50% of the severe/critical patients, and the level of serum phosphorus in severe / critical patients was lower than that in normal patients. This may be due to the decrease of the level of glycerol 2,3-diphosphate in erythrocytes under the condition of hypophosphatemia, which leads to the left shift of the oxygen dissociation curve, the decrease of oxygen release and the disorder of oxidative phosphorylation process, and finally leads to tissue hypoxia due to the decrease of ATP energy supply 10 . At the same time, the disturbance of lung water absorption is closely related to the metabolic disorder of phosphorus, the lack of phosphorus aggravates the inflammatory level of lung tissue, the ratio of ventilation and blood flow of edematous lung tissue is maladjusted, and the oxygenation function decreases, which can induce fatigue caused by hypoxia in intercostal muscle and diaphragm. At the same time, the production of pulmonary surfactant is reduced, pulmonary alveoli are trapped, and respiratory failure is further aggravated 11 . Some studies have confirmed that timely correction of hypophosphatemia in patients with hypophosphatemia can reverse the above symptoms and improve the prognosis [12] [13] .",

In this study, 85% of patients with severe/critical type had lymphocyte absolute value lower than the reference range, and the lymphocyte level of patients with severe/critical type was lower than that of patients with normal patients. Studies have shown that the immune function of elderly patients with severe pneumonia is significantly lower than that of their healthy peers, while the immune function of patients with hypophosphatemia is lower and generally in the state of immunosuppression. Studies have found that serum phosphorus in elderly patients with severe pneumonia is positively correlated with the ratio of CD4+ / CD8+ 18 . Our study also showed that there was a positive correlation between the absolute value of lymphocyte and the level of serum phosphorus, so the timely treatment with phosphorus supplementation for severe patients with low phosphorus may improve their immune level and promote their recovery. The decrease of blood phosphorus level in clinical practice is commonly seen in chronic diseases such as fasting, malnutrition, parenteral nutrition 19 , metabolic or respiratory alkalosis, diabetic ketoacidosis, alcoholism, chronic alcohol withdrawal, and inadequate phosphorus intake without timely supplementation [20] [21] . Most of the severe/critical COVID-19 patients mentioned in our study were middle-aged, with an overweight BMI and few underlying diseases, and a decrease in blood phosphorus levels was detected 1-10 days after admission. It is more likely that novel coronavirus invades human body, causing a strong stress response and the release of inflammatory factors. On the one hand, gastrointestinal function decline or gastrointestinal mucosal cell integrity and barrier function is impaired, resulting in a reduction in phosphorus intake from food. On the other hand, stress response leads to increased secretion of epinephrine, glucagon, etc., and severely reduced utilization of intracellular phosphorus, leading to the migration of a large amount of phosphorus into the cell to participate in energy metabolism 22 . In addition to following the treatment of COVID-19 (trial version fifth), we also treated patients with hypophosphatemia with phosphorus supplementation. With the recovery of the disease and the transformation of the viral nucleic acid, the blood phosphorus level and the absolute value of lymphocytes in the majority of severe/critical patients returned to normal. In this process, is it caused by exogenous supplement or redistribution of phosphorus inside All rights reserved.
