Here, we demonstrated that PI4KB is also essential for genome replication of another picornavirus, Aichi virus (AiV), but is recruited to the genome replication sites by a different strategy from that utilized by enteroviruses. AiV non-structural proteins, 2B, 2BC, 2C, 3A, and 3AB, interacted with a Golgi protein, acylcoenzyme A binding domain containing 3 (ACBD3). Furthermore, we identified previously unknown interaction between ACBD3 and PI4KB, which provides a novel manner of Golgi recruitment of PI4KB. Knockdown of ACBD3 or PI4KB suppressed AiV RNA replication. The viral proteins, ACBD3, PI4KB, and phophatidylinositol-4phosphate (PI4P) localized to the viral RNA replication sites. AiV replication and recruitment of PI4KB to the RNA replication sites were not affected by brefeldin A, in contrast to those in enterovirus infection. These results indicate that a viral protein/ACBD3/PI4KB complex is formed to synthesize PI4P at the AiV RNA replication sites and plays an essential role in viral RNA replication.",

Virus infection results in remodelling of intracellular membranes, and replication complexes, where viral RNA is replicated, are formed associated with membranes. Virus-induced membrane structures are thought to increase the local concentrations of components required for replication, to provide a scaffold for anchoring the replication complexes, to prevent the activation of certain host defense mechanisms that can be triggered by dsRNA produced during virus RNA replication, and to provide certain lipids required for genome synthesis (reviewed in Miller and Krijnse-Locker, 2008) .",

            "text": "The family Picornaviridae is a group of non-enveloped, single-stranded positive-sense RNA viruses. Picornaviruses include many important pathogens for humans and animals, such as poliovirus, enterovirus 71, rhinoviruses, hepatitis A virus (HAV), and foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV). Each genome is 7200-8500 nucleotides in length, and has a single large open reading frame (ORF) consisting of a capsid-coding P1 region, and non-structural protein-coding P2 and P3 regions. Some viruses encode a non-structural protein, leader (L) protein, upstream of the P1 region. After a large polyprotein has been translated from a single ORF, the polyprotein is processed by virus-encoded proteases into 11-12 final cleavage products. Of the non-structural proteins, 2B, 2C, and 3A, and the cleavage intermediates, 2BC and 3AB, are membrane-associated proteins (Towner et al, 1996; Teterina et al, 1997; Knox et al, 2005; Moffat et al, 2005; Krogerus et al, 2007) , and have been reported to be involved in membrane reorganization (Cho et al, 1994; Aldabe et al, 1996; Egger et al, 2000; Suhy et al, 2000) . In addition, cellular factors are thought to be required for membrane reorganization for picornavirus replication. Many studies have shown the involvement of Golgi-specific Brefeldin A (BFA) resistance factor 1 (GBF1) and ADP-rybosilation factor 1 (Arf1), which participate in the cellular secretory pathway, in the replication of enteroviruses such as poliovirus and coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) (Belov et al, 2005 (Belov et al, , 2007 (Belov et al, , 2008 Lanke et al, 2009; Wessels et al, 2006a, b) . Furthermore, the formation of membranous vesicles by enterovirus infection is also proposed to occur through COPII-mediated vesicle budding from the ER (Rust et al, 2001) , or an autophagy-mediated process (Suhy et al, 2000; Jackson et al, 2005) . Recently, a model by which enteroviruses remodel membranes for viral RNA replication was proposed (Hsu et al, 2010) . According to the model, enterovirus RNA replication begins at the Golgi/trans-Golgi network (TGN). Viral protein 3A anchored to membranes binds and modulates GBF1/Arf1 to enhance recruitment of phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase IIIb (PI4KB) to the sites for viral RNA replication on the membranes, over COPI. PI4KB catalyses the production of phophatidylinositol-4-phosphate (PI4P). The produced PI4P binds to soluble viral 3D RNA polymerase and recruits it to the membranes to facilitate viral RNA synthesis. Enhanced recruitment of PI4KB on the membranes decreases anterograde transport and leads to the emergence of PI4P-enriched organelles for enteroviral RNA replication adjacent to the ER exit sites.",

The virus has been detected in gastroenteritis outbreaks or sporadic cases of diarrhoea not only in Japan, but also in other Asian countries, Brazil, Europe, and Africa, and is suggested to be a causative agent of gastroenteritis (Yamashita et al, 1995 (Yamashita et al, , 2000 Oh et al, 2006; Pham et al, 2007; Ambert-Balay et al, 2008; Goyer et al, 2008; Sdiri-Loulizi et al, 2008; Reuter et al, 2009; Yang et al, 2009) .

However, we found that AiV utilizes a different strategy to recruit PI4KB to the site of genome replication from that used by enteroviruses. We showed that AiV nonstructural proteins, 2B, 2BC, 2C, 3A, and 3AB, interact with a Golgi resident protein, acyl-coenzyme A binding domain containing 3 (ACBD3). In addition, we found that ACBD3 interacts with PI4KB. No direct interaction between PI4KB and the viral proteins was detected. Knockdown of ACBD3 or PI4KB reduced virus RNA replication. Immunofluorescence microscopy revealed colocalization among the viral nonstructural proteins, ACBD3, PI4KB, PI4P lipids, and dsRNA in viral RNA-replicating cells. Thus, these results indicate that a viral protein/ACBD3/PI4KB complex is formed to synthesize PI4P at the AiV RNA replication sites and plays an essential role in viral RNA replication.",

For 2B, 2C, 3A, or 3AB, mut3 and mut5, both of which contain a C-terminal region (aa 327-528), maintained the ability to induce a greater than B15-fold increase in luciferase activity compared with negative controls. Also for 2BC, 7-and 4-fold increases in luciferase activity were detected with mut3 and mut5, respectively. On the other hand, mutants without the C-terminal region lacked the ability to enhance luciferase expression. These results suggest that the C-terminal region of ACBD3 is essential for binding to 2B, 2BC, 2C, 3A, and 3AB. Further detailed experiments to identify the binding domain to these viral proteins were carried out using a series of deletion mutants of mut3 ( Figure 2C and D). For the five viral proteins, mut3D1 with the deletion of aa 328-373 enhanced luciferase expression to a similar level to mut3, but the other mutants did not.

This region overlaps with the region important for binding to the AiV proteins (aa 374-528) ( Figure 2 ). We then examined localization of giantin in viral RNA-replicating cells ( Figure 4A ). To distinguish RNA-trans-fected cells, a viral non-structural protein, the L protein, was immunostained. In mock-transfected cells, both ACBD3 and giantin were located in the Golgi. At 2 h after electroporation with viral RNA, the dispersion of ACBD3 and giantin was observed in some cells; however, the L protein could not be detected, because of its insufficient accumulation. At this time point, ACBD3 colocalized with giantin. As infection progressed, the redistribution of ACBD3 and giantin from the Golgi to the cytoplasm became more apparent. Importantly, at 4 h, giantin was dispersed throughout the cytoplasm, whereas ACBD3 formed clusters. As shown in Figure 3 , ACBD3 colocalized with dsRNA or the viral proteins in such structures. At 4 h after electroporation, the intensity of immunofluorescence for giantin seems to be decreased compared with that in mock-transfected cells; however, no degradation of giantin was observed in an immunoblot analysis using anti-giantin antibody (data not shown).",

We investigated whether BFA inhibits AiV replication. Treatment with 10 mg/ml of BFA inhibited poliovirus RNA replication, as known, but did not affect AiV RNA replication at all ( Figure 5C ). This result suggests that PI4KB is recruited independently of GBF1/Arf1 to the AiV replication sites. As described above, ACBD3 was localized to the Aichi viral RNA replication sites through binding to some viral non-structural proteins. We examined whether ACBD3 interacts with PI4KB. In the mammalian two-hybrid assay, interaction between ACBD3 and PI4KB resulted in a 138-fold increase in luciferase activity, indicating a strong interaction between the two proteins ( Figure 6A ). No apparent activation of luciferase expression was detected for viral non-structural proteins (3.5-fold increase for 3A and less for other proteins). To further confirm the interaction between ACBD3 and PI4KB, HA-tagged PI4KB was co-expressed with FLAG-tagged ACBD3 or FLAG-tagged 3A in 293T cells, and then co-immunoprecipitation analysis was performed.

In this study, we showed that AiV non-structural proteins and cleavage intermediates, 2B, 2BC, 2C, 3A, and 3AB, interact with ACBD3. Furthermore, ACBD3 was shown to interact with PI4KB. Immunofluorescence microscopy showed that dsRNA, which indicates the viral RNA replication sites, colocalized with these viral proteins, ACBD3, PI4KB, and PI4P lipids. In addition, knockdown of ACBD3 or PI4KB using siRNA inhibited AiV RNA replication. These results indicate that the viral protein/ACBD3/PI4KB complex is formed to synthesize PI4P at the viral RNA replication sites and plays an essential role in viral RNA replication. PI4KB has been reported to be an essential host factor for enterovirus RNA replication (Hsu et al, 2010; Arita et al, 2011) . According to the model proposed by Hsu et al (2010) , PI4KB is recruited to the RNA replication sites by GBF1/Arf1/ 3A, and synthesizes PI4P. PI4P can interact with viral RNA polymerase 3D, a soluble protein. Thus, soluble 3D is recruited to the viral RNA replication complex formed on membranes to facilitate viral RNA synthesis. BFA inactivates GBF1 and inhibits the recruitment of GBF1/Arf1 to 3A, thereby inhibiting recruitment of PI4KB to the replication sites of enteroviruses (Belov et al, 2008; Hsu et al, 2010) . The present study showed that AiV replication was insensitive to BFA ( Figure 5C ). The difference in the sensitivity to BFA between AiV and enteroviruses can be explained by the difference in the strategy used to recruit PI4KB to the viral RNA replication sites. In AiV, PI4KB would be recruited to the viral RNA replication sites through the formation of the viral protein/ACBD3/PI4KB complex. Formation of this complex would be resistant to BFA, as indicated by the observation that PI4KB as well as ACBD3 colocalized with dsRNA even in the presence of BFA ( Figure 7E ). This result is in contrast to the observation that PI4KB disperses in BFA-treated CVB3infected cells (Hsu et al, 2010) . It remains to be determined whether PI4P can bind to AiV 3D RNA polymerase.",

ACBD3 is also known as peripheraltype benzodiazepine receptor and cAMP-dependent protein kinase-associated protein 7 (PAP7) (Li et al, 2001) or Golgi complex-associated protein of 60 kDa (GCP60) (Sohda et al, 2001) . ACBD3 is localized to the Golgi and also to mitochondria (Li et al, 2001; Sohda et al, 2001) , and has various biological functions (reviewed in Fan et al, 2010) in the maintenance of the Golgi apparatus structure (Sohda et al, 2001) , apoptosis (Sbodio et al, 2006) , steroidogenesis (Li et al, 2001) , neurogenesis (Cheah et al, 2006) , and embryogenesis (Zhou et al, 2007) .

            "text": "ACBD3 contains no hydrophobic region that can be involved in membrane localization, and is localized to the Golgi through interaction with giantin, which contains a C-terminal membrane-anchoring domain (Sohda et al, 1994 (Sohda et al, , 2001 . The giantin-binding domain of ACBD3 has been mapped to the C-terminal region (aa 373-528). Our mammalian two-hybrid assays indicated that the giantin-binding domain of ACBD3 overlapped with the binding domain for the five viral nonstructural proteins (aa 374-528) (Figure 2 ), but did not overlap with the PI4KB-binding domain, which was mapped to the central region (aa 116-327) ( Figure 6C ). This implies that PI4KB is at least partly present in the Golgi through interaction with the ACBD3/giantin complex. We propose a model for recruitment of PI4KB to the AiV RNA replication sites (Figure 9 ). The viral membrane proteins 2B, 2BC, 2C, 3A, and 3AB will compete with giantin for binding to ACBD3 at the Golgi. As infection progresses, the viral proteins will rob the preexisting giantin/ACBD3/PI4KB complex of the ACBD3/PI4KB complex to form the viral protein/ACBD3/ PI4KB complex. This is also suggested by the subcellular localization of these proteins shown in Figures 3, 4A, and 7 . In addition, binding of multiple viral proteins to ACBD3 that has the ability to associate with PI4KB would lead to efficient recruitment of PI4KB to the viral RNA replication sites. The redistribution of giantin, GM130, and TGN46 to the cytoplasm observed in AiV-replicating cells (Figure 4) indicates Golgi disassembly. It has been reported that ACBD3 is involved in the maintenance of the Golgi structure by interacting with giantin (Sohda et al, 2001) . Dissociation of ACBD3 from giantin through bound by the viral proteins may contribute to Golgi disassembly. At 4 h after electroporation with the replicon RNA, 2B, 2C, and 3A colocalized with ACBD3 in patchy structures in the cytoplasm ( Figure 3A ). On the other hand, giantin, GM130, and TGN46 redistributed to the cytoplasm did not colocalize with ACBD3 ( Figure 4) . Considering that the virus membrane proteins 2B, 2C, and 3A target ACBD3, it is very likely that these viral proteins are first accumulated in the Golgi, and then the replication complexes are formed utilizing Golgi membranes; however, the mechanism of the membrane remodelling for formation of the AiV replication complexes is currently unknown. Interestingly, acyl-coenzyme A (acyl-CoA) has been reported to participate in the budding of transport vesicles from Golgi cisternae and the fusion of transport vesicles with Golgi cisternae (Glick and Rothman, 1987; Pfanner et al, 1989 Pfanner et al, , 1990 . ACBD3bound acyl-CoA may play a role in membrane remodelling for formation of the viral RNA replication complexes. In addition, the absence of three Golgi proteins, giantin, GM130, and TGN46, at the AiV RNA replication sites suggests the sorting or deterring of Golgi components, which has been observed in CVB3-infected cells (Hsu et al, 2010) . TGN46 is present at the sites for CVB3 replication, but was absent at the AiV replication sites. On the other hand, the absence of GM130 was observed in the replication sites for the two viruses. These imply a different manner of sorting or deterring of the Golgi components between AiV and CVB3. Analysis of the subcellular localization of other Golgi components and factors involved in intracellular membrane traffic in AiV-infected cells will be required for elucidation of the mechanism of formation of the AiV replication complexes.",

The coding region of ACBD3 was amplified by PCR from a cDNA clone (Toyobo, FCC137B01), while the PI4KB-coding sequence was amplified by RT-PCR using total RNA prepared from HeLa cells. Each PCR product was cloned into pBIND and pACT (Promega) as described previously (Ishikawa et al, 2010) , yielding pBIND-ACBD3 and -PI4KB, and pACT-ACBD3 and -PI4KB. pBIND and pACT constructs encoding ACBD3 deletion mutants were generated by cloning each DNA fragment amplified by PCR from pACT-ACBD3 into pBIND and pACT. The DNA fragments encoding L, 2B, 2BC, 2C, 3A, and 3AB were obtained by PCR from pAV-FL-Luc-5 0 rzm.

In uninfected cells, the C-terminal region of ACBD3 binds to the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain of giantin that is anchored to the Golgi membrane through the C-terminal anchoring domain. PI4KB is localized to the Golgi through interaction with the central part of ACBD3 (left panel). In AiV-infected cells, viral membrane proteins 2B, 2BC, 2C, 3A, and 3AB compete with giantin at the Golgi for binding to ACBD3. The viral protein/ACBD3/PI4KB complex is formed as infection progresses, whereas giantin no longer colocalizes with ACBD3 (right panel).",
