If the Manual was approved by an authority having jurisdiction, it may include an official approval seal of that agency. The statement ( Figure A9 -4) might be as follows: is noted that the authority having jurisdiction in many cities empowers the fire safety director with full authority to evacuate a building, without the need to obtain approval from building owners or managers. Each unit of the building emergency staff organization will have duties and responsibilities developed and tailored to the specific needs of the building and to each type of emergency it may be required to handle. These duties and responsibilities should be defined clearly so that there is a coordinated and effective response to each emergency situation. For example, the duties and responsibilities of building management, the building fire safety director, \u2666 and the building engineering and security staff \u2666\u2666 in handling a fire emergency include ensuring that the fire department has been immediately notified, all occupants in the affected areas have been advised of the situation, any necessary evacuation of occupants has begun, fire life safety systems are operating under emergency conditions, any investigation or initial suppression of the fire is carried out, and the fire department and other responding personnel are met on \u2666 Some buildings might refer to the fire safety director as the building emergency controller. \u2666\u2666 In addition, building parking staff may be called on to assist in the evacuation of occupants from parking areas.

In contrast, during a bomb threat incident, these personnel may be involved in supervising the evacuation of occupants or assisting in searching certain areas. In a medical incident, security staff, depending on the hotel's policy and the type of situation, may be required to administer cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), an automated external defibrillator (AED), or basic first aid prior to the arrival of emergency medical responders.",

For example, in the city of New York, if a fire occurs in a high-rise building, the fire floor and the floors immediately above are the most critical areas for rapid evacuation. \u2666 However, in Los Angeles, if a fire occurs in a high-rise building and it is serious enough to evacuate one floor, five \u2666\u2666 floors are evacuated (commonly referred to as the \"Rule of 5\" or \"5 Move 5\"): the fire floor, two above it for safety, and two below it (so that the second floor below the fire floor can be used as a staging area for fire department operations). Occupants on these five floors are relocated down five floors, thus being relocated to at least three floors from the fire floor; if the fire is on or below a floor that is six floors from street level, the occupants usually are evacuated from the building. Figure A9 -7 shows the floors from which occupants are usually evacuated or relocated during a fire using the \"Rule of 5\" or \"5 Move 5\" zoned evacuation. During a fire situation, it is usually advisable to evacuate downward in a building. However, if the lower floors or the stairwells are destroyed or untenable because of heat or smoke, only then is it necessary or more desirable to go to an upper floor or to the building's roof. The problems with occupants relocating to a building's roof, particularly in substantial numbers, are its limited space to accommodate people and the difficulty if becomes necessary to evacuate these people from the roof itself. If the building has a helipad or heliport, as some modern high-rise buildings do, there is not only the problem of obtaining a helicopter but also of it landing safely to pick up occupants. During serious building fires, smoke and heated air cause air turbulence and updrafts. \u2666 \u2666\u2666 Individuals with temporary or permanent disabilities \u2666\u2666\u2666 or other conditions that would require them to obtain assistance during an evacuation require special consideration during evacuation.

In designing the scenario, the point of impact was stipulated and the number of occupants killed and injured was specified, including the actual locations of injured persons.

There will be little loss of the tenant's business time, but a morale problem may develop if it is discovered later that a bomb threat was received and occupants were not informed. Using a supervisor to search usually will not be as thorough because of her or his unfamiliarity with certain areas. Using occupants to search their own areas is the best method for a rapid search. It is hoped that concerns for their own personal safety will contribute to a more thorough search. Furthermore, occupants are familiar with what does and does not belong in a particular place. Using occupants to search will result in less loss of time than if all were evacuated prior to the search by trained teams; it also can have a positive effect on morale if a good training program is provided to develop confidence. Of course, this would require training an entire group and, ideally, performing several practical exercises. A drawback of this search method is the increased danger to those persons not evacuated.",

When the team enters the room to be searched, individuals should move to various parts of the room, stand quietly with eyes closed, and listen for a clockwork device ( Figure A9 -10). Frequently this mechanism can be detected quickly without using special equipment. Even if none is detected, the team is now aware of the background noise level within the room itself. Background noise or transferred sound is always disturbing during a building search. A ticking sound that is heard but cannot be located can be unnerving. The sound could come from an unbalanced air-conditioner fan several floors away or from a dripping sink down the hall. Sound transfers through air-conditioning ducts, along water pipes, and through walls. A building that has steam or hot water heat is very difficult to search; it will constantly thump, crack, chatter, and tick because of the expansion and contraction of the pipes as steam or hot water moves through them. Background noise may also include outside traffic sounds, rain, and wind.",

As a result, if a fire occurs, it will be detected early, and notification will be issued by human means or by the building's automatic fire detection system, and the fire usually will be suppressed before it has an opportunity to develop into a major conflagration. However, after normal business hours and on weekends and holidays, the number of people present in the building is severely reduced, so there is more dependence on the building's automatic fire detection and notification systems and security staff. According to Klem, \"The reliability of such protection depends on the completeness of the fixed detection and suppression equipment and the emergency fire procedure training of security staff. If any of these are deficient, severe fires are more likely to occur. For these reasons, high-rise buildings where reliable fixed fire protection systems are not present simply are more vulnerable to the potential for large losses during nonbusiness hours.\" 29 Occupant Response to a Fire When a fire occurs, occupants who discover the fire should know how to protect themselves, how to notify others who may be at risk, how to confine a fire, and how to notify those who will respond to the fire. The notification procedure may include telephoning the fire department and building management or security and activating a manual fire alarm station on the floor where the fire is occurring. 28 \"ASME A 17.4, Guide for Emergency Evacuation of Passengers from Stalled Elevator Cars [ASME, Fairfield, NJ, 1991], details procedures for performing a safe evacuation\" (Donoghue, Edward, A., \"Building transportation Systems,\" Fire Protection Handbook, 18th ed. [National Fire Protection Association, Quincy, MA, 1997, p. 8-57]). \u2666 Despite the fact that fires and fire alarms are rare occurrences, if one occurs, everyone in a building must react quickly. In other emergencies, such as a winter storm or a civil disturbance, the initial reaction to this type of emergency will not necessarily determine its impact on the building. In a fire emergency, however, the first three to four minutes are critical. The timely handling of a fire emergency according to sound procedures can help stop the event from becoming a catastrophe. 29 Klem, Thomas, J., \"Major high-rise fires reveal protection needs,\" NFPA Journal (National Fire Protection Association, Quincy, MA.

[National Fire Protection Association, Quincy, MA, 1997, p. 8-56]). However, \"elevators operated under Phase II recall continue to fail and trap firefighters\" (Routley, J., G., New York Bank Building Fire: Compartmentation vs. Sprinklers, Report 071 in Major Fires Investigation Project, United States Fire Administration, Emmitsburg, Maryland, 1993, as reported in \"High-rise office building evacuation planning: Human factors versus 'Cutting edge' technologies\" by Charles Jennings [J. Applied Fire Science, Vol. 4(4) 289-302, 1994-95, 1995]). According to Jennings, \"The latest and most advanced thought is now devoted to developing pressurization requirements for elevator shafts and lobbies. The objective of these current efforts is to make elevators a useful component of the building evacuation system during a fire.\" (Jennings, Charles, \"High-rise office building evacuation planning: 3. Heat melts or deforms the corridor push button or its wiring at the fire floor. 4. The elevator functions normally at the fire floor, as in high or low call reversal. \u266634 De Vries also commented on the issue, Elevators are subject to disruption and failure due to the heat produced by fires or the water that may be applied to extinguish or control the fire, while the passengers can succumb to smoke that may be drawn into the elevator shaft by stack effect and elevator movement. Furthermore, if disabled in midcycle, passengers can be left stranded in an elevator cab with no means of movement to a place of safety. 35 Such logic does not mean that elevators cannot be used for evacuation of occupants or for emergency responders to travel upward in a high-rise building during a fire situation. \"Once the emergency situation has been sized up and a determination made has been made as to what elevators can be used safely, elevators can be a viable means for evacuation and particularly useful for moving persons with disabilities from an area of refuge (rescue assistance) out of the building or relocating to a safer location.\" 36 Such determination can only be competently made after the issue has been thoroughly examined before an incident occurs and suggested safe courses of action clearly documented in the Building Emergency Procedures Manual.",

Two critical decisions that will need to be made quickly relate to the operation of HVAC systems within a building and whether building occupants need to be evacuated to a safe area (an area of refuge). In a high-rise, the impact of the release of airborne chemical or biological agents is accentuated by the fact that a building's HVAC systems could provide a means for the rapid spread of contaminants throughout a building. This fact has caused considerable debate among industry experts as to what actions should be taken with regard to these complex systems, whose operations often vary from building to building and system to system.",

The operation of each type of portable fire extinguisher varies depending on its type and the type of fire that it is being used to extinguish. (Chapter 6 describes the various types of extinguishers.) Thoroughly review the specific operating procedures for an extinguisher that an occupant may use.

Only in the direst emergency should untrained co-workers attempt to evacuate the disabled. This is particularly critical in going down stairways. 2. The basic objective of evacuating a disabled person should be to have the disabled assistance monitors remove her or him to the nearest safe location. The monitors should stay with the disabled person; report their location to the floor warden, building fire safety director, or other designated member of the building emergency staff organization; and then wait for the fire department to accomplish the actual evacuation if the fire department decides it is required. 3. If the building is equipped with automatic sprinklers, the disabled need only be moved to an adjacent safe area or floor, rather than being carried out of the building. 4. The evacuation procedures should be reviewed with disabled persons prior to an emergency so that they will know what assistance to expect during drills and actual emergencies. 5. Elevators are not generally used to evacuate disabled persons during a fire emergency (see discussion in later section \"Use of Elevators\"). 6. There are specialized devices [sometimes called stair-descent devices \u2666 ], including evacuation chairs, available to provide a controlled descent down steps of disabled persons.Further information on this subject is available in the Emergency Evacuation Planning Guide for People with Disabilities. \"This guide addresses the needs, criteria, and minimum information necessary to integrate the proper planning components for the disabled community into a comprehensive evacuation planning strategy.

The mere presence of materials and a viewer doesn't mean there's always communication. Communication occurs when the viewer \"listens\" to the materials, hears and understands what they say, and remembers their message. 68 In addition to building tenants utilizing written and audiovisual materials to communicate information to building emergency staff, floor wardens, and occupants, certain information must be received from building tenants. For example, tenants always must have trained persons assigned to the positions of floor warden and alternate floor warden, and they must immediately inform building management and the building fire safety director of any disabled/physically impaired individuals who may need assistance during an emergency.Some buildings facilitate feedback of such vital details by including requests for updates of fire life safety information from the tenants within Tenant Manuals and information packages given to new tenants. Others distribute, or can post on the building's website, a Fire Life Safety Information Package (see sample in Appendix 9-4) at least every quarter or six months to remind tenants of the building program and their responsibilities in it. This package could include an explanation of the building fire life safety program and the training available for occupants and floor wardens during the ensuing quarter or six-month period. It also could supply the current versions of building forms such as Floor Wardens and Alternates Roster and Disabled or Physically Impaired Persons List, with a request that tenants update any changes and return the forms to the building fire safety director. (Samples of these forms are in Appendix 9-3.)A computer can be of great assistance in maintaining fire life safety records. A database can be created with names and contact telephone numbers of tenants and building emergency staff, and training details of all participants in the program can be maintained using a learning management system that is part of the building's website. . Present timely and accurate information to the media. An underlying reason for dealing with the media is so that the dissemination of information can be controlled and presented in a light that the organization involved prefers. \"You can control and manipulate the media if and only if you tell the truth. If you lie or withhold, you're dead meat. In the short term, we will quickly know it because we are always in private contact with our offices, which monitor each other, monitor all police and fire frequencies, and have access to wire services and telephone tipsters.\" 74 Guidelines for handling the media during and after a major emergency should be documented in the Building Emergency Procedures Manual. They should designate the spokesperson or public information person who will address the media, outline how media representatives are to be handled and accommodated, and specify what access these representatives are to be granted.",
