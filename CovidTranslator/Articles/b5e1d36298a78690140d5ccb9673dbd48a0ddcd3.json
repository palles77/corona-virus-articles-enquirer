Additionally, this case is unusual in that the translocation 104 event is thought to be prompted by an RNA structure -a predicted RNA hairpin 105 upstream of the S protein gene, rather than a body TRS (12). Body TRSs are located 106 upstream of the three remaining structural protein genes, yet a non-discontinuous 107 mechanism is utilised for their production, as is the case for roniviruses.

Ribo-seq 164 coverage is much higher towards the 3' end of the genome, particularly across the M 165 and N genes, reflecting the translation of abundant subgenomic RNAs in this region 166 ( Figure 2, Figure 3 ). ORFs 1a and 1b contain a considerably lower density of Ribo-seq 167 reads. The relatively low translation efficiencies calculated for ORFs 1a and 1b may 168 be partly due to some gRNA being packaged (or destined for packaging) and 169 unavailable for translation but still contributing to the estimate of gRNA RNA-seq 170 density. ORF1a has a higher Ribo-seq density and a higher translational efficiency 171 than ORF1b, reflecting the proportion of ribosomes terminating at the ORF1a stop 172 codon and not undergoing the -1 frameshift into ORF1b (Figure 2, Figure 3 ). As 173 expected, RNA-seq density is similar across ORF1a and ORF1b, as both are present 174 only on the full-length genomic RNA ( Figure 2 ). The region covering the HE ORF also 175 has low ribosomal coverage (Figure 2 ), which may be due to the fact that the EToV 176 HE gene is nonfunctional due to a large deletion including the canonical AUG (16). HE 177 is not shown in Figure 3 as the HE transcript is much less abundant than the 178 \"upstream\" M transcript which makes the decumulation procedure susceptible to 179 noise (see Irigoyen et al., 2016) . Translational efficiency appears highest for the M 180 and S subgenomic RNAs. The high RNA-seq density in the 5' UTR may be indicative of 181 one or more defective interfering (DI) RNAs in the sample (see below). Ribosome 182 protected fragments (RPFs) were also identified mapping to the second half of the 5' 183 UTR, mostly in the +2/-1 frame with respect to ORF1a ( Figure 2A) . 184",

This confirmed we had high quality RPFs arising from 192 host transcripts, with strong triplet periodicity (\"phasing\") and very few reads 193 mapping to 3' UTRs. As in other datasets, a ramp effect of decreased RPF density was 194 seen over a region of ~30 codons following initiation sites; but, unusually, in this 195 dataset we did not observe a density peak at the initiation site itself (cf. Irigoyen et al 196 2016) . This may be due to the flash freezing without cycloheximide pretreatment 197 used for these samples, as for a later cycloheximide-treated sample this peak is The relative RPF density allowed us to estimate the efficiency of ribosomal 202 frameshifting in the context of virus infection. After translating ORF1a, a proportion 203 of ribosomes undergo a \u22121 ribosomal frameshift to translate ORF1b (17). This is 204 (presumably) required to produce a specific ratio of pp1a to pp1ab, thereby 205 controlling the ratio of RNA-synthesing enzymes such as RdRp and helicase to other 206 components of the replicase complex, including the proteinases and trans-207 membrane subunits encoded in ORF1a. The ORF1a/1b \u22121 ribosomal frameshifting 208 event is stimulated by a pseudoknot structure 3'-adjacent to the U_UUA_AAC 209 slippery heptanucleotide frameshift site. The efficiency of \u22121 ribosomal frameshifting 210 (measured by dividing the mean RPF density in ORF1b by the mean density in ORF1a) 211 was estimated to be 29.9 % for replicate one and 27.5 % for replicate 2, which is in 212 accordance with the rates measured previously outside of the context of virus 213 infection (20 -30 %) (17). 214",
