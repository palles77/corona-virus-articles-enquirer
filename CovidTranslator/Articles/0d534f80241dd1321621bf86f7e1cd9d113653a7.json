Ethical dilemmas known to the specialty arise from the decisions to be made between what can be done and what should be done for varieties of cardiovascular pathologies. Some of the ethical deliberations are resurrection of a patient with acute coronary syndrome or malignant arrhythmias. 1 The practice of cardiology is increasingly constrained by guidelines, regulations, and legal considerations. 2 All doctors, including cardiologists, have a primary duty of care to individual patients, in addition to their responsibilities to society, institutions, and colleagues. Among cardiologists, the propensity to test and treat is closely associated with fear of malpractice suits. 3 Cardiology practice has gained importance as a result of the introduction of advanced diagnostics, drugs, and devices. Early recognition and appropriate intervention minimizes the consequences of cardiac illnesses, which in turn reduces the cardiovascular mortality and morbidity. At the same time, awareness about cardiac care among community members has increased their expectations. When the expectations are not achieved, legal issues creep in. In an analysis of 1899 judicial sentences related to cardiology in Spain, 31% of the decisions were made for plaintiffs and the defects were misdiagnosis including gaps in communication and informed consent. 4, 5 Misuse and unethical practices related to state health insurance in India was reported by a weekly magazine, 6 and it urged medical associations to curtail such violations. Factors linked to malpractice claims are patient dissatisfaction, noncompliance with patients' demands, incorrect diagnosis, complication(s) related to procedures, medical malpractice, and so forth. Even though many physicians recognize impairment and incompetency among coprofessionals, they generally do not bring them to the attention of the respective authorities or report them. 19 ",

However, most students do not have the confidence to do a clinical audit, to find deficiencies in medical records, to correlate the laws related to patient care, and/or to provide legal support to patients. This is because knowledge about the legal issues is suboptimal among medical teachers, and legal and ethical aspects are not discussed during regular ward rounds or grandrounds, nor are they incorporated into lecture classes. Anything that is not learned in medical school is less likely to be remembered and practiced or inculcated. The University of Iowa College of Medicine is among a relative few to offer separate courses in ethics and law as part of their curriculum. 74 ",

Major concerns are how to make a medical faculty impart medical ethics to students of health care sciences. The \"Cardiology Ethics Curriculum\" at the University of Toronto is a useful resource. 93 Ethical components are rarely discussed in during ward rounds. 94 Teaching ethics should be incorporated into all clinically oriented teaching and training activities. Students can also learn ethics through role models and interaction with patients, instead of formal lectures. 95 Because medicine and ethics are inseparable, teaching ethics at the bedside becomes essential but is seldom done. 94 There is a need to introduce bioethics as part of the curriculum at all health science education institutions. 96 The complexity of the technology involved in making a diagnosis and therapy requires a careful search for the right answer under some very difficult situations. Training on descriptive bioethics 96 using various modern medical education technologies and discussion with fellow doctors, hospital administrators, religious leaders, and social scientists in difficult situations, can help to make policy decisions amicable to the patient, family, and society. Achievements in medical practice and health care delivery depend on the status of the medical education system, the nature of medical manpower, economic resources, the health care system, and, importantly, medicolegal law.

Cardiologists should be informed to establish the kind of actions, communication skills, and empathy that are required to build a stronger patient\u00c0health care professional relationship, which improves prognosis, treatment efficacy, and therapeutic adhesion. 97 D. Cardiac report cards should be developed that incorporate an ethical framework, which can identify points of ethical concern for practitioners, patients, policymakers, and researchers 98 E. The integrity and behavior of an individual physician plays a major role in the prevention of liability cases. Professional associations play a major role in the regular monitoring process and for initiating self-regulation of professionals. to provide a written notice of their privacy policy to all those who seek medical care for the first time. Patients must be informed of how the institution may use and disclose information. The written notice must describe patient's rights, including the right to access their medical information and their right to provide feedback or complaint, if they believe their rights were violated. The notice shall be in plain language and presented in an understandable manner. An acknowledgment of receipt of the information notice must be obtained from the patient. 103 The institution shall have a close working relationship among medical personnel, legal, and risk management team. The team, through interaction on case by case basis, can acquire a wealth of information, learn, and meet the needs of clinical dilemma, which are evolving constantly. Such interactions enhance health care and ensure patient safety, and thereby establish a high standard of care. Also, the institution shall ensure quality assurance, organize risk management programs, and conduct routine audits or monitoring as suggested by a specialist's team. Laws generally require that therapeutic interventions be done in a reasonable and medically approved manner, preferably based on clinical evidence or standard guidelines. Medical staff dealing with cases should remember that the issues raised by any one case are complex and application in a real situation is difficult. Hence, staff should review the hospital counsel and the local laws and regulations pertaining to these issues. 103 L. Medical records: Medical personnel should be trained and motivated for proper documentation, adherence to risk management principles, and entry of every aspect related to the case in the respective medical record. The physician is required to write a medical record that will support the basis for the appropriate medical judgment made. The medical record should reveal supporting clinical data or facts, the patient's history available at that time, hemodynamic status, physical examination, investigation reports, and treatment plans administered. One must remember that hospital records are prima facie evidence. 104 Therefore physicians who do not record supporting clinical data and history deprive themselves of a strong \"medical judgment defense.\" 103 Moreover, inappropriate entries or markings on the medical record can weaken the defense in a liability case. 104 If any corrections are required in the medical record, the preferable method is to draw a single line over the word or value to be changed; and at the place where such correction is made, initials or signature should be affixed. However, total obliteration of a number or word may indicate that obliteration was done intentionally. Quality-assurance reviews of records of EDs often reveal inadequate charting by physicians and nurses. 103 A lapse of documentation of patient's clinical condition for 4 hours or more after initial physician and nursing assessment will be utilized by the plaintiffs attorney in a lawsuit to develop the theory that no care was given. The uncooperative acts of the patient and the difficulties encountered in providing care to the patient because of his or her actions should be recorded. Poorly written physicians' notes may become an issue in a medical malpractice action and considered a less-than-caring attitude by the doctor. Descriptions of a patient's behavior and lifestyles should depict compassion and a professional manner. Health care institutions and cardiovascular physicians should realize consumer rights and responsibilities such as information disclosure, choice of providers and plans, access to emergency services, participation in a treatment discussion, respect and nondiscrimination, confidentiality of health information, and complaints and appeals. 83 M. Incentives and ethics: Incentives, in different forms, have been introduced for various services and are not accessible in health care delivery. 105 Incentive mechanisms are based on four types of motives: traditional, selfinterest, affective, and shared purposes. Financial incentives have helped to achieve the quality or efficiency of related targets but have potential adverse consequences including conflicts of interest that threaten patient\u00c0physician trust. The ethical allegations, implications for effectiveness, and mechanisms of different motives were highlighted. Incentive schemes based on a robust sense of shared purposes protect and promote physicians' sense of moral responsibilities and ethical standards. These also enable physicians to take ownership of it rather than make them feel it is imposed on them. 105 N. Patient-centered specialty practice: As a part of a new phase of health care delivery systems, the National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA) launched patient-centered specialty practice (PCSP) in 2013. The objectives of the committee are to reinforce care coordination, improve access to specialty care, reduce the use of unnecessary or duplicate tests, enhance communication, and assess and improve performance. 106 ",

The modern cardiovascular specialist has to explain these spectra, considering individual patients' wishes and best interests, the maleficence of side effects, and the impact of therapeutic interventions in the larger social context. To achieve these things, physicians should acquire skills in the art of medicine and interact with patients and caregivers with empathy, astute observations, acccurate interpretation of clinical and laboratory data, and application of up-to-date knowledge with evidence and ethics. This can strengthen insight into disease and suffering and provide a means to diagnose, treat, and prevent disease; if followed meticulously and documented sincerely, legal liability is less likely to develop. Treatment decisions, in general, should be based on a profound respect for the patient's autonomy, balanced by an appreciation of what may be in the patient's best interest. Decision making involves a wide array of personal, professional, institutional, spiritual, and social values. In routine practice, clinical management decisions should be coupled with outcome analyses and guide physicians' approach to best address the needs and expectations of patients.",
