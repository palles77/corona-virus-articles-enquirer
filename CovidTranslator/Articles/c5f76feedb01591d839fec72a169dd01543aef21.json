It cannot be excluded that because of the COVID-19 less severe clinical picture it can 28 spread in the community more easily than MERS and SARS. The actual basic reproductive number 29 (R 0 ) of COVID-19 (2-2.5) is still controversial. It is probably slightly higher than the R 0 of SARS (1.7-30 1.9) and higher than MERS (<1),. The gastrointestinal route of transmission of SARS-CoV-2, which 31 has been also assumed for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, cannot be ruled out and needs to be further 32 investigated. 33 Implications: There is still much more to know about COVID-19, especially as concerns mortality 34 and capacity of spreading on a pandemic level. Nonetheless, all of the lessons we learned in the 35 past from SARS and MERS epidemics are the best cultural weapons to face this new global threat. (WHO) to range between 2 and 2.5, which is higher than SARS (1.7-1.9) and MERS (<1), suggesting 100 that SARS-CoV-2 has a higher pandemic potential. 19-23 However, it must be noted that some 101 published studies have estimated a R 0 for SARS reaching the value of 4. 24 Interestingly, a recent 102 review by Liu and colleagues has shown that the average reproductive number of SARS-CoV-2 is 103 estimated to be 3.28, with a median value of 2.79, thus exceeding the WHO estimates. 25 where the epidemic has started, is 7-fold higher than other provinces. 26 This could be related to 112 the fact that, among the 44 672 cases reported by CCDC, 10 567 (14.6%) cases were diagnosed 113 only clinically and exclusively in the Hubei province. Therefore, it cannot be excluded that clinically 114 diagnosed cased presented with a more severe clinical picture, thus increasing the case fatality 115 rate. 26 After the change of case definition, the number of cases increased due to the inclusion of 116 cases cumulated over the past weeks. The question is: were mild cases registered at all? It is not a 117 minor matter, because including mild cases will reduce the mortality rate. Indeed, the number of ",

            "text": "-CoV-2 belongs to the same betacoronavirus genus of the coronaviruses responsible50    for the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS)51 (i.e SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, respectively), this novel virus seems to be related to milder52    infections. Moreover, SARS and MERS were mainly associated with nosocomial spread, whereas 53 SARS-CoV-2 is much widely transmitted in the community. 554In this review we aim to analyze the differences in terms of pathogenesis, epidemiology and 55 clinical features between COVID-19, SARS and MERS.56PHYLOGENY57Genome sequence analysis has shown that SARS-CoV-2 belongs to betacoronavirus genus, that58 includes Bat SARS-like coronavirus, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV. 6 59 SARS-CoV-2 possesses a genomic structure which is typical of other betacoronaviruses. Similarly to 60 other coronaviruses, its genome contains 14 open reading frames (ORFs), encoding for 27 61 proteins: the ORF1 and ORF2 at the 5'-terminal region of the genome encode for 15 non-structural 62 proteins important for virus replication. 7,8 The 3'-terminal region of the genome encodes for 63 structural proteins, namely spike (S), envelope protein (E), membrane protein (-CoV and Bat SARS-like coronavirus, to a different clade from MERS-CoV and it is more 67 phylogenetically related to Bat SARS-like coronaviruses isolated in China from horseshoe bats 68 between 2015 and 2018 than to the SARS-CoV (Table 1). This suggests a different viral evolution 69 from SARS and MERS, involving bats as wild reservoir. 9-14 Genomic comparison between SARS and 70 SARS-CoV2 has shown that there are only 380 amino acid substitutions between SARS-CoV-2 and 71 SARS-like coronaviruses, mostly concentrated in the nonstructural protein genes, while 27 72 mutations have been found on genes encoding for viral spike protein S responsible of receptor 73 binding and cell entry. 8 This mutations might explain the apparent lower pathogenicity of SARS-74 CoV-2 than SARS-CoV, but further studies are required. 9 75 PATHOGENICITY 76 Accumulating evidence based on genomic analysis suggest that SARS-CoV-2 shares the same 77 human cell receptor with SARS-CoV, the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), while MERS-CoV 78 uses dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) to enter in host's cells (Table 1). 15 It is well established that 79 SARS-CoV emerged as human pathogen thanks to favorable mutations on the receptor binding 80 domain (RBD) of the S protein, that increased its pathogenicity by strengthening its affinity to the 81 receptor; it is therefore assumed that SARS-CoV-2 has behaved in a similar way. 15 However, in 82 SARS-CoV-2 no amino acid substitutions were present in the RBD that directly interact with human 83 receptor ACE2 compared with SARS-CoV, but six mutations occurred in the other regions of the 84 RBD. 8 The role of such substitutions on the pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 must be further 85 investigated. Analysis of receptor affinity shows that SARS-CoV-2 binds ACE2 more efficiently than 86 the 2003 strain of SARS-CoV, although less efficiently than the 2002 strain. 15 Moreover, it has been predicted that a single nucleotide mutation on RBD of SARSan ectoenzyme anchored to the plasma membrane of the cells of several tissues, 90 especially lower respiratory tract, heart, kidney and gastrointestinal tract. 16 Inoculation of the 91 2019-nCoV onto surface layers of human airway epithelial cells in vitro causes cytopathic effects 92 and cessation of the cilia movements. 17 SARS-CoV highly replicates in the type I and II 93 pneumocytes and in enterocytes, and the SARS-induced down-regulation of ACE2 receptors in 94 lung epithelium contributes to the pathogenesis of acute lung injury and subsequent ARDS. 16,18 It 95 must be further investigated if the higher receptor affinity of SARS-CoV-2 than SARS-CoV for ACE2 96 could lead to a more severe lung involvement in COVID-19 than in SARS. 97 TRANSMISSIBILITY 98 The reproductive number (R 0 ) of the novel infection is estimated by World Health Organization 99",

Of interest, the fatality rate of the novel coronavirus infection increases to an estimated 120 14% when considering only the hospitalized cases, reaching the overall SARS case-fatality rate that 121 was estimated to be around 15%. date, complete clinical data concerning COVID-19 have been reported for 458 cases in the 124 English-language literature, of which 415 from Hubei province in China 2-4,30 , 17 in other Chinese 125 provinces31,32  , 25 in Korea 33,34 and 1 in USA35  . InTable 2the main clinical characteristics from the 126 three most significant case series of COVID-19 cases are listed and compared with the most127    recently available data about SARS and MERS. The median age of the COVID-19 cases ranges from 128 49 to 57 years, similar to SARS and MERS, higher in those admitted to ICU; up to 50% of patients 129 reported a chronic comorbid illness in a slightly lower percentage compared to patients diagnosed130    with MERS. The most common presenting symptoms is fever, followed by cough, sore throat and 131 dyspnea; all of the infected patients had at least one symptom. However, according to the CCDC 132 report, 81% of the cases had mild symptoms and 1.2% were asymptomatic. 26 133 Laboratory findings in patients diagnosed with COVID-19 are not remarkably different from those 134 diagnosed with the other coronavirus infections, with lymphopenia as the most common finding, of COVID-19 is not much different from the other two coronavirus-142 associated pneumonia, even though the proportion of cases with bilateral findings seems to be 143 higher in COVID-19 cases. The most common CT findings in COVID-19 is bilateral pulmonary 144 parenchymal ground-glass, consolidative or \"crazy paving\" pulmonary lesions, often with a 145 rounded shape and a peripheral distribution.36  Interestingly, in a recent study on 167 patients 146 from Hubei province with suspected COVID-19 who underwent chest CT scan and respiratory swab 147 for detection of SARS-CoV-2, five subject (3%) had a CT scan that was strongly suggestive of148 COVID-19, but an initially negative real-time polymerase reaction (RT-PCR). These patients were 149 isolated for presumed COVID-19 pneumonia and the respiratory swab repeated between 2 with COVID-19 may have an unfavorable clinical course with the onset of 152 dyspnea within 5 days, ARDS within 8 days in 30% of cases and need for invasive mechanical 153 ventilation and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) in 17% and 4% of cases, 154 respectively. 3 These findings are in line with SARS percentages, while clinical course of MERS 155 seems to be characterized by a more frequent development of ARDS and needing of invasive life 156 support, especially in elderlies and smokers. 38 In particular, acute kidney injury (AKI), which rarely 157 occurs in SARS and COVID-19, seems to be a peculiar complication of MERS. Although this could be 158 explained by a direct renal cytopathic effect induced by the virus, since DDP4 receptors are largely 159represented in tubules and glomeruli, it seems more probable that the high percentage of AKI160    reported is due to multi-organ failure, which occurs more frequently in MERS than in 19 seems no to be very different from SARS regarding the clinical features; it seems to be 164 less lethal than MERS, which is less related with the other two coronavirus both in terms of 165 phylogenetic and pathogenesis features.166 COVID-19 generally has a less severe clinical pictures, and thus it can spread in the community 167 more easily than MERS and SARS, which have been frequently reported in the nosocomial setting. 168 The previous knowledge learned from SARS and MERS lessons might have contributed to the 169 institution of more efficient preventive measures in the healthcare settings. 170 Which are the causes of such different ability to spread among these three viruses? A first 171 hypothesis is a different viral tropism for the respiratory tract, resulting in a milder but highly 172 transmittable disease when the virus replicates in the upper respiratory tract and a severe 173 pneumonia with lower spreading potential when the viral tropism is higher for the lower 174 respiratory tract. This hypothesis derives from the example of the influenza viruses, namely 175 seasonal influenza viruses H1N1 and H3N2. They preferably bind alpha 2,6-linked sialic acid 176 receptors of the upper respiratory tract, usually causing a less severe but more transmissible 177 disease than avian influenza H5N1 or H7N9, which preferably bind alpha 2,3-linked sialic acid in 178 the lung alveoli, causing severe pneumonia. 40 On the other hand, SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and 179 MERS-CoV use receptors that have been found both in the upper and in the lower respiratory 180 tract. Moreover, other human coronaviruses, such as NL63-CoV, cause a mild illness even if they 181 bind to the same receptor of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV 5 . So, in our opinion, it is likely that the 182 different inoculum dose at the time of infection makes the difference in terms of severity of the disease; heavy inoculum exposures seem to be linked to an higher penetration in are higher at the time of symptoms onset and higher in nose than in throat 187 specimens. 41,42 Furthermore, in patients affected by COVID-19, viral load progressively decreases 188 within days, following a different pattern than SARS, in which the highest shedding is recorded 189 after 10 days from the symptoms' onset. 41-43 These findings suggest that SARS-CoV-2 may spread 190 more easily in the community than SARS even when initial mild symptoms or no in the intrinsic virulence of the viruses themselves can explain the different 193 capacity of spreading. MERS-CoV has a higher mortality but a lower transmissibility probably 194 because it causes a more severe clinical picture than COVID-19 and SARS, requiring hospitalization 195 more frequently, thus reducing the community spreading of the infection and increasing the 196 nosocomial transmission. 5,21 On the other hand, the higher mortality of MERS could be biased by 197 the fact that the largest data available on MERS were derived from hospitalized patients, thus 198 implicating a more severe clinical picture than community acquired cases. 44 This hypothesis is 199 strengthened by the observation that, when the cohort of patients with MERS was derived from 200 the community and not from hospital outbreaks, the mortality rate decreased to 10%, as it has 201 been observed in a cohort study carried out in 2015 in Saudi Arabia. 44 202 Interestingly, despite the high virological similarity between the SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, 203 gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms and diarrhea seem to be much more common in SARS, although 204 the proportion of SARS patients with GI symptoms varies among different studies, from 23% to 205 70% in the Toronto outbreak and in the Hong Kong community outbreak, respectively. 43,45 Such 206 difference could be related to the fact that the Hong Kong outbreak seemed to originate from a 207 fecal contamination of a residence complex due to a faulty sewage system, while the Toronto 208 outbreak was mainly caused by nosocomial hospital droplet transmission. 43,45 The GI route of 209 transmission has been also hypothesized for MERS-CoV, through the consumption of infected 210 camel milk; moreover, GI transmission has been demonstrated in the animal model through 211 intestinal DPP4 receptors. 46 According to this findings, the reported detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA 212 in the loose stools of the first US patient with COVID-19 is not surprising. 35 SARS-CoV replicates in 213 the enteric epithelium by binding to the ACE2 receptor and it cannot be excluded that SARS-CoV-2 214 would behave in the same way. 18 This may contribute to the hypothesis that SARS-CoV-2 could 215 also be transmitted via this route, together with the evidence that SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV 216 remain viable in environmental conditions that could facilitate faecal-oral transmission. 47 In Table 217 3 we provide a synthesis of what is certain to date about COVID-19 and what needs to be , there is still much more to know about COVID-19, especially its epidemiological 220 features, such as mortality and capacity of spreading on a pandemic level. The lessons we have 221 learned in the past from the SARS and MERS epidemics are the best cultural weapons to face this 222 new global threat.",
