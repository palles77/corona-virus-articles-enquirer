There has been no recent systematic characterization of the epidemiology of this disease. Recently, it has been suggested that the incidence of the disease is decreasing. We therefore abstracted data from registers of patients in 21 affected villages and the town of Vratza, Bulgaria maintained from 1964 through 1987. In 1964, the prevalence of BEN was 6.0 per 1000 inhabitants; among residents of the affected villages, the preva-lence was 12.3 per 1000. From 1965 to 1975 the incidence rate was 0.7 per 1000 person-years, and from 1976 to 1987 the incidence rate was 0.3 per 1000 person-years (rate ratio 0.43; p < 0.001). Incidence was much lower in Vratza town; among residents of affected villages, the period-specific rates were 1.7 and 0.8 per 1000 per year, respectively (rate ratio 0.47; p < 0.01). These trends were consistent across all villages for which registers were maintained. Median survival following registration increased from 2.0 to 5.0 years over the same period (p < 0.001). BEN appears to be decreasing in incidence in this region.",

The affected villages were interspersed among villages in which, to the present day, no cases of BEN have been diagnosed. An incidence rate of 30-50 cases per year per 10,000 people in the endemic area in the 1970s has been cited [15] . However, the available reports did not provide an adequate epide-miological profile of this disease. Recently, it has been suggested that the incidence of the disease is decreasing in Serbia [16] , but no similar analyses have been published for other endemic areas. Changes in the epidemiology of BEN over time, if real, would suggest directions for focussing research into the etiology of the disease. We therefore describe the distribution of BEN in the region in which it was first identified, using population-based registers for the period 1964 through 1987 that have never, to our knowledge, been previously analyzed using epidemiological approaches.",

Since the 1960s the population of most villages has decreased, while the population of the town of Vratza has more than doubled and that of the village of Mezdra has increased to over 15,000 inhabitants ( Table 1 ).

Information available included the individual's full name (first, patronymic, family) and age. The registers were maintained in the District Hospital in Vratza, and were updated each year until 1987. Each year's entry for a village consisted initially of an alphabetized list of all surviving BEN patients (prevalent and newly identified) living in the village. New names were added as individuals were identified, and deaths and relocations were recorded. Some individuals were deleted from the register in later years and not subsequently followed -there is no additional information in the registers, but it is our understanding that these individuals were later thought to have a disease other than BEN. No clinical details are available, either of these deleted cases or for those retained in the register.

We considered cases registered in subsequent years to be incident in that year.

Population counts for years in which census data were not available were computed by linear interpolation. Prevalence in 1964, and incidence rates for each year from 1965 to 1987 were computed for each affected village, for all the affected villages of the district taken together, and for the town of Vratza. We also combined the years 1965-1975, and 1976-1987 , to provide larger number of cases in each of two periods of approximately one decade, to compare trends in annual incidence rates and survival over time. For these periods we computed the average incidence rate by summing the new cases that occurred in the period, and then dividing by the total person-years at risk, calculated as the sum over the years 1964-1987 of the population counts for each year. Survival post-registration was calculated as the difference between the recorded date of death and the year of registration, in complete years. Survival was considered censored at 1987. Probability of survival post-registration was computed as the proportion alive among those not known to have previously died or relocated.",

We lack any data to address this concern directly, although we were struck by the higher proportion of individuals in the latter part of the registry for whom age was not known, suggesting less intensive monitoring. We are concerned that we were unable to match in the registers a majority of the patients receiving care at the District Hospital in 2000 who should have been registered based on a reported year of diagnosis prior to 1987. This suggests that these individuals were not ascertained via village-based surveillance, and that the various ascertainment methods may not have been cross-referenced. It is also possible that the cases prevalent in 2000 represent a different form of the disease, given their very long survival and the marked preponderance of women in the prevalent series. Arguing against a deterioration of the surveillance system is our observation that the annual update was maintained consistently for cases who were identified in the villages, with no evidence of increased losses to follow-up. Thus follow-up of registered cases continued with the same rigor (although there may have been a reduced focus on identification of new cases). The age of incident cases increased between 1965-1975 and 1976-1987 , suggesting that cases were being identified at a later age, consistent with less aggressive case finding and screening. However, median time to death following registration was longer among cases identified in the later period, arguing that these later cases do not appear to be weighted towards a later stage of the disease, as might be expected if active surveillance were scaled back.",

A district dialysis unit was opened in 1972 [14] . It might represent a staging effect, as a result of earlier detection. It may also reflect changes in diagnosis, with a higher proportion of severe nephropathies being classified as diseases other than BEN (e.g., end-stage renal disease consequent to diabetes mellitus) in more recent years.

This might indicate that a redistribution of the population of BEN-villages occurred (including current and potential future cases); this likely reduced the prevalence and incidence of the disease in the BENaffected villages. In this regard, the systematic transfer of the population of Karash is noteworthy. The implications of these population transfers to previously BEN-free areas depends on the true underlying etiology. If the cause is related to a localized environmental exposure and indeed out-migration reduces risk, then we would expect incidence in the areas to which these people moved to remain low. If, however, the etiology is viral or genetic, then we might expect to have seen the emergence of BEN in areas previously free of the disease. While we are unaware of new cases of BEN occurring in other regions of Bulgaria, surveillance of the out-migrating population is required to address this question thoroughly.",
