Following this and other instances of unethical medical experimentation, the federal government issued the Belmont Report, providing ethical guidelines for the conduct of research on human subjects (The Belmont Report, 1979) .",

Some of those technologies, such as vaccines to prevent infections and antibiotics to prevent their transmission, are used in public health. But public health differs from clinical health care in a number of significant ways. In medicine, it is the interaction between the care provider and the patient that leads to the most ethical issues. In this interaction, medical ethics seeks to protect the autonomy of the patient. In public health, however, most ethical issues arise from the interaction between an agencysuch as a city health departmentand the population it is serving. A public health agency is often protecting some people within a population from others. For example, it may need to isolate an infectious person in order to prevent transmission to others. In so doing, the autonomy of the infected person is constrained in the interest of the community. Because of these fundamental differences between medicine and public health, the Belmont Report, and policies subsequently derived from the Report, do not adequately address a number of important issues in public health.",

The late emergence of a code of ethics in public health may reflect that, until recent years, many public health institutions were led by physicians who would naturally recognize medical codes of ethics. Moreover, for centuries, physicians were regarded as the overseers of all health-related matters. Only in the past few decades have nonclinical health professionals begun to assume more authority in health care and prevention.",

It focused on strengthening federal, state, and local government agencies in their mission of protecting and promoting the health of the public. The impetus for developing a Public Health Code of Ethics originated within a group of public health practitioners, including providers of public health services, staff of public health nonprofit organizations, government officials, and academics. They had come together for leadership training by the Public Health Leadership Institute. As a leadership exercise, they sought to identify ethical principles that aligned with the issues they were encountering in their work more closely than the common principles of medical ethics. The group began by identifying typical ethical challenges and responses that had surfaced over time from their experiences in public health. From these, they identified principles, such as the use of scientific data for making decisions. These principles led in turn to an initial draft of the code.",

When confronted by an ethical dilemma, such as the use of quarantine to limit transmission of a highly pathogenic infection, lawyers typically reflect first on what the law allows and on the precedents in case history. Philosophers typically expand on the situation to explore all the philosophical threads and identify what various schools of philosophical thought would have to say about the ethical conundrums. Public health practitioners are relatively pragmatic. They commonly seek to minimize the number of people harmed by the epidemic. Although they may not name the philosophy, this perspective is closely aligned with utilitarianism, which seeks the greatest good for the greatest number of people. In some instances, public health practitioners also appeal to human rights, another ethical school of thought, which acts as a counterbalance to a utilitarian calculus that can sideline a minority of the population; for example, the few placed in quarantine for the benefit of the community have a right to have certain basic needs met while in quarantine.",

To ensure compliance with prescribed procedures in federally funded research, there exists an institutional infrastructure reaching from the federal government to individual institutions such as universities. Institutions found not to comply with the prescribed procedures can lose their license to conduct federally funded research until they are found to be compliant once again. Codes of ethics for the practice of public health do not have the enforcement structures seen in research ethics. Rather, the codes are aspirational, articulating the values and expectations of the profession. They are a means of being transparent and enabling the public they serve to hold them accountable for their actions. In addition, they serve as a tool for identifying and addressing ethical issues.

While this accurately reflects the primary relationship between agencies and populations, which makes it difficult for individual practitioners to understand their role as stewards of the Code. Public health oaths, such as the one written by the University of Georgia College of Public Health, may mitigate this limitation of the Code. 2. Public health is as much a consortium of constituent disciplines as it is a field unto itself. A person working at a water purification plant may identify more with the discipline of environmental science than with public health at large. This challenge is perhaps met in part by codes of ethics written by disciplines within public health, as noted above. We encourage those disciplines to reflect on the broader code of ethics as they write or revise their own, to ensure consistency and coverage of the full range of concerns to address. 3. The Code has served as a resource primarily for public health practitioners. However, philosophers and lawyers are more likely to write text books on public health ethics. Thus, the texts for teaching public health ethics may not appeal to future public health practitioners. We encourage public health practitioners who have one foot in academics, perhaps by being an adjunct professor, to develop ethics teaching resources that incorporate the processes of everyday life in various aspect of public health. This might include, for example, how decisions are made and communicated in the context of public health emergencies.",
