The current study was undertaken to characterize the receptor for two members of the murine PSG family, PSG17 and PSG23. Binding of recombinant PSG17 and PSG23 to CHO-K1 and L929 cells and their derived mutants was performed to determine whether these proteins bound to cell surface proteoglycans. We also examined binding of these proteins to cells transfected with syndecans and glypican-1 by flow cytometry. The interaction with glycosaminoglycans was confirmed in solid phase assays. Our results show that PSG17 binds to CD9 and to cell surface proteoglycans while PSG23 binds only to the latter. We found that the amino acids involved in CD9 binding reside in the region of highest divergence between the N1-domains of murine PSGs. For both proteins, the N-terminal domain (designated as N1) is sufficient for binding to cells and the ability to bind cell surface proteoglycans is affected by the cell line employed to generate the recombinant proteins. We conclude that while substantially different at the amino acid level, some murine PSGs share with human PSG1 the ability to bind to cell surface proteoglycans and that at least one PSG binds to more than one type of molecule on the cell surface.",

We found that human PSG1 binds to cell surface proteoglycans and hypothesized that murine PSGs may use the same receptors [16] . The experiments described in this report show that PSG23, one of the highest expressed murine PSG family members [4] , and PSG17 bind to glycosaminoglycans chains presented in syndecans and glypican-1. In addition, we determined that binding to these cell surface proteoglycans is mediated through the N1-domain of these proteins. We have previously shown that PSG17 and PSG19 bind to the tetraspanin CD9 while we did not observe binding of murine PSG23 [15, 17, 18] . Mutagenesis was performed to identify the amino acids in PSG17 which are required for CD9 binding. We found that the amino acids in PSG17 involved in CD9 binding, map to the area of highest divergence between the N1-domains of murine PSGs. Primate and rodent PSGs have undergone independent gene family expansions and structural diversification [19] . Our results indicate that some members of the murine and human PSG family could share biological functions despite their sequence divergence as they bind to the same molecules on cells. Same receptor usage could explain the previously observed species cross-reactivity and validates the use of murine models to better understand PSG function in vivo.",

We hypothesized that PSG17 may also bind to cell surface proteoglycans. Figure 1D shows that PSG17N bound significantly better to L929 and CHO-K1 than to Sog9 and CHO-pgsA-745. Because we previously reported that PSG17 did not bind to bone-marrow derived macrophages (BMDM) generated from CD9-null mice while it bound to the cells derived from wild type mice [17] , we wondered whether BMDM lack HSPG expression. Fig. 2A shows that BMDM from CD9-null or wild type mice do not express detectable levels of HS, compared to L929, which were used as positive control. This is in agreement with the observed lack of binding of PSG23N to BMDM (Fig. 2B ) or PSG23N1A (data not shown), which use proteoglycans as their only receptor. Therefore, PSG17 binds to cells expressing only CD9 or cell surface proteoglycans and these interactions are mediated through the N1-domain. To confirm that murine PSG17N and 23N bind to cell surface proteoglycans and to determine if the nature of the core protein affects the interaction, we performed binding assays in cells stably transfected with syndecans 1-4 or with glypican-1. Expression of the proteoglycans was confirmed with specific antibodies (data not shown). Namalwa cells express very low levels of HSPGs but their membrane expression is greatly increased in the transfected cells [16] . PSG17N and PSG23N bound significantly more to cells expressing syndecans or glypican-1 than to untransfected cells (Fig. 3A) . Identical results were obtained whether the binding experiments were performed with the PSGs comprised of the N1-domain or with proteins containing the N1 and the A-domain (data not shown).",

When the first 75 amino acids of PSG23 were replaced for the corresponding ones in PSG17, resulting in 29 amino acid substitutions (mutant 1 in Fig. 5A ), the chimeric protein bound to Sog-mCD9 cells (Fig.  5B ).

The difference in binding was even more pronounced when PSG23N was analyzed. PSG23N generated in CHO-K1 cells bound to L929 cells while the same protein generated in HEK 293T cells did not bind (Fig. 6B) . The same phenomena was observed when using the Namalwa cell stably transfected with glypican-1 and the recombinant proteins produced in HeLa cells behaved like the ones produced in CHO-K1 cells (data not shown). The difference in binding was not observed when comparing binding of PSG17N made in the three cell lines to Sog9-mCD9, which suggested that binding to CD9 was not affected by the cell type chosen to produce this protein (data not shown). PSGs do not have O-linked oligosaccharides but they are heavily N-linked glycosylated [25] . We have observed that PSG1 purified from human serum binds to syndecans (Dveksler, unpublished). Therefore, we believe that the CHO-K1 or HeLa produced PSGs mimic more closely the proteins secreted by the trophoblasts.",

In addition, we determined that the N1 Ig-variable like domain appeared sufficient for binding to cells and for the observed induction of TGF\u03b2 1 by PSG17 [17, 21] . Recently we showed that PSG1 binds to cell surface proteoglycans including syndecan 1-4 and that this binding mediated the ability of this protein to induce capillary-like tube formation by endothelial cells [16] . We hypothesized that murine PSGs, while having limited amino acid sequence identity with human PSG1, may have conserved the ability to bind to the same molecules on the surface of cells. Our results show that this is indeed the case. Murine PSG17N and PSG23N bound to all four syndecans and to glypican-1. We found that PSG17 and PSG23 comprising the N1 and Adomain and the proteins consisting of just the N1-domain bound to glycosaminoglycans. The same result was obtained with recombinant PSG17 consisting of the N1 and N2 domains followed by the Fc tag and with full length PSG17 fused to secreted alkaline phosphatase (data not shown) [17] . Both recombinant proteins bound to CHO-K1 cells while they did not bind or bound slightly over the control proteins (FLAG-Fc and secreted alkaline phosphatase, respectively) to the heparan and chondroitin sulfate null mutant, CHO-pgsA-745. While we only tested PSG23N1A and PSG23N, we hypothesized that full length PSG23, like full length PSG17, will also bind to GAGs. In addition, our data strongly suggests that the core proteins do not play a critical role in this interaction as these proteins do not share significant homology at the amino acid level. Therefore it is likely that PSGs may interact with GAG chains on other glypicans or cell surface proteoglycans.",

In addition to syndecan-4, syndecan-1 is expressed in endothelial cells in the gestation 8.5 pregnant uteri [29] and syndecan 1-null embryos are smaller than their wild type siblings [30] . These observations, together with the inability of heparinase-treated endothelial cells to form tubes in response to PSG1 [16] , suggests that the interaction between PSGs and syndecans could play an important role in the establishment of the vasculature during pregnancy.

Significant PSG17 binding is demonstrated in L929 which do not express CD9 but express HSPG. Therefore we conclude that PSG17 binds independently to cell surface proteoglycans and to CD9. The biological significance of the CD9-PSG17 and cell surface proteoglycans-PSG17 interactions remains to be elucidated. CD9 and members of the syndecan family are co-expressed in some cell types in the placenta such as trophoblast giant cells and endothelial cells [27, 31] . Different syndecans as well as CD9 have been reported to participate in the regulation of the immune response and in angiogenesis [32] [33] [34] [35] . Interestingly, adeno-associated virus type 2 can bind to cells either using CD9 or HSPG, as we here report for PSG17 [36] . Which signaling mechanisms may be triggered upon binding of PSG17 to one or the other receptor remains to be investigated, but both syndecans and CD9 have been reported to associate with different integrins and modulate their functions [34, [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] .",

The crystal structure of the N-domain of mouse CEACAM1 has been utilized to predict the structure of the N-domain of human and murine PSGs [42] . There is 21.3% identity at the amino acid level between the N1-domains of murine PSGs. The region corresponding to the predicted \u03b2-sheet forming CFG face is the most variable region in this domain [19] . It is in the CFG face that pathogens such as mouse hepatitis virus and Neisseria bind to CEACAM family members [43] [44] [45] . We found that amino acids 37 to 62, which are in the CGF face, are required for the interaction of PSG17 with CD9 and that this region is also likely involved in the ability of PSG17 to bind with higher affinity to GAGs when compared to PSG23 (data not shown). While PSG23 mutants 3 and 4, containing amino acids 37 to 62 of PSG17 bound to CD9, these mutants did not result in the same level of binding as PSG17N or mutant 1. Therefore, a contribution of the first 32 amino acids of PSG17 in the interaction of this protein with CD9 cannot be excluded. We speculated that PSG17 and PSG19 binding to CD9 requires the presence of carbohydrates at position 52, but we found that CD9 binding does not segregate with the presence of this glycosylation site.",

This is likely due to the differences in the ability of HEK 293T cells to add complexed glycans bearing sialic acid, which will impart a more negative charge to the proteins affecting their ability to bind to a negatively charged cell surface molecule such as a proteoglycan [46] . Therefore, as previously observed for other recombinant glycoproteins, the expression system selected to generate recombinant PSGs should be carefully considered as differences in binding and/or activity may be observed.",

            "text": "In conclusion, we found that murine PSG17 and 23, like human PSG1, bind to the GAG chains on cell surface proteoglycans. Whether all PSGs share the ability to interact with these molecules remains to be determined. It is possible that during gene expansion some PSGs have evolved to bind to other receptors such as we observed for PSG17. Whether this dual binding capacity is observed in human PSGs and if it confers an additional function remains to be determined but we have no evidence of this occurring at this time. Understanding the function of PSGs is a complex but worthwhile undertaken as PSGs likely play an important role in angiogenesis and immune regulation, which are essential for successful pregnancy. PSG17 and PSG23 bind to Syndecans 1-4, Glypican-1 and to immobilized glycosaminoglycans. (A) Namalwa and Namalwa cells stably transfected with syndecans 1-4 or glypican-1 were incubated with 30 \u03bcg/ml of PSG17N-Fc, PSG23N-Fc or FLAG-Fc followed by PE-conjugated anti-human Fc\u03b3. The median fluorescence intensity (MFI) of each treatment is shown. (B) 96-well NUNC plates were coated overnight with 200 \u03bcg/well of heparin, heparan sulfate, or chondroitin sulfate. After blocking, proteins were added to the wells. Following extensive washing, bound proteins were detected with HRP-conjugated anti-Fc\u03b3 Ab. All treatments were performed in quadruplicate and data is representative of three independent experiments. Statistical significance between the protein control and the PSG17N and 23N-treated wells was determined by two-tailed Student t-test and error bars represent the S.E.M. (C) PSG17N-Fc or PSG23N1AHisFLAG were applied to a 1 ml heparin-Sepharose column, after washing, the proteins were eluted with a NaCl gradient. Aliquots of each eluted fraction as well as the starting material (SM) and flow through (FT) were assessed by immunoblot analysis with HRP-conjugated anti-Fc\u03b3 Ab for PSG17N-Fc and HRP-conjugated anti-FLAG M2 mAb for PSG23N1AHisFLAG. PSG-mutants and mapping of the CD9-binding site in the N1-domain of PSG17. (A) Identity between amino acids in the N1 domains of PSG17 and PSG23 is shown with a dash. Potential glycosylation sites are boxed. Highlighted amino acids indicate correspondence to the PSG23N1 sequence. \"*\" represents the K 35 to R substitution in PSG17 required to introduce a restriction site and \"\u25b2\" indicates the N 52 to A mutation in mutant 6, which deletes one of the potential N-linked glycosylation sites in PSG17. The \u03b2-strands (A to G) are indicated with lines on the upper part of the figure. Total substitution refers to the number of amino acids changed from the wild type sequence. (B) Sog9 expressing murine CD9 were treated with 30 \u03bcg/ml of the mutants shown in part A, PSG17N-Fc or PSG23N-Fc followed by PE-conjugated anti-human Fc\u03b3. ",
