            "text": "Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is defined as an infection of the lung parenchyma that is not acquired in a hospital, long-term care facility, or other contact with the health care system [1] . CAP continues to be a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Despite the availability of adequate anti biological agents to treat this illness, it has remained the fourth most common cause of death in Japan since 1975 [2] . Common causative agents of pneumonia in ambulatory patients are Streptococcus pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Chlamydia pneumoniae and respiratory viruses (influenza A and B, adenovirus, respiratory syncytial virus and parainfluenza) [3, 4] . Mortality was the highest for Staphylococcus aureus (50%), and the lowest for Chlamydia pneumoniae (4.5%). Mortality was not seen with M. pneumoniae. Pneumonia due to aerobic Gram negative organisms was uncommon, even though empirical therapy with a combination of broad-spectrum antibiotics was often used in this subgroup [5] . Severe community-acquired pneumonia (SCAP) represents a frequent and potentially lifethreatening condition. About 10% of all hospitalized patients with CAP require admission to the intensive care unit (ICU), and the mortality of these patients reaches 20-50% [6] . Severe CAP has been defined as those cases that require admission to the ICU. Direct admission to an ICU is required for patients with septic shock or acute respiratory failure requiring invasive mechanical ventilation, which are defined as major severity criteria in the modified score of the American Thoracic Society (ATS) guidelines that are used to define severe CAP [7] .",

In the study done by Kantor [15] he found the patterns of lobar pneumonia and bronchopneumonia were equally frequent in pneumococcal pneumonia. The radiographic findings of Legionella consist of segmental peripheral consolidations, there may also be lobar involvement, and bilateral disease is seen in more than half of the patients [16] . Viral pneumonia has a radiologic pattern consisting of poorly defined air-space nodules of 4-10 mm, patchy areas of peribronchial ground glass opacity, and air-space consolidation. Hyperinflation is also commonly present because of the associated bronchiolitis. Pneumonia could progress as seen by the rapid confluence of consolidation leading to diffuse alveolar damage, which consists of homogenous or patchy unilateral or bilateral air-space consolidation and groundglass opacity or poorly defined centrilobular nodules [17] . The predominant radiographic patterns in H1N1 pneumonia are bilateral ground glass opacity and alveolar consolidation [18] . Striking characteristic of S. pneumonia is its tendency to involve the pleura, parapneumonic effusions are common in Pneumococcal pneumonia [19] . In the study conducted by Ali Khawaja et al. [20] they found that the most common chest X ray finding in patient with CAP was lobar consolidation in (63%) followed by pleural effusion in (37%) and interstitial infiltrates in (28%). In another study by Seksan et al. [21] they found that the most common pulmonary infiltration pattern of X-ray in patients with CAP was patchy infiltrates in (69.3%), followed by interstitial infiltrations in (22.2%), diffuse alveolar infiltrations in (5.0%) and multilobar infiltrations in (3.5%).",
