This review focuses on the immunotherapeutic strategies that have been used to prevent and treat infections over the past 20 years and outlines different refinements that have been introduced with the goal of moving this therapy beyond specialized academic centers.",

            "text": "Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) can be curative for a variety of malignant and nonmalignant hematologic conditions and congenital diseases [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] . However, serious viral infections remain a major cause of morbidity and are responsible for mortality in up to 39% [6] [7] [8] [9] . An increasing array of viruses have been implicated in post-transplant infectious complications, due in part to more comprehensive patient screening using improved detection methods, but also to the extension of this therapeutic modality to higher-risk patients (i.e., individuals without a human leukocyte antigen [HLA]-matched sibling donor) who receive more extensively manipulated products and/or prolonged immunosuppression. Thus, reactivation of latent viruses including cytomegalovirus (CMV; 20-68%) [10, 11] , Epstein-Barr virus (EBV; 0.5-29%) [12] , herpes simplex virus (HSV 1/2; 80%) [12] , human herpes-virus 6 (HHV-6; 33-48%) [11, 13] , varicella zoster virus (10-68%) [12] , human herpes-virus 7 (HHV-7; 10-57%) [11, 14] and BK virus (BKV; 10-25%) [15, 16] are frequent, while infections associated with an array of community-acquired respiratory viruses, including influenza (1.3-44%) [17], para-influenza (2-7%) [18, 19] , metapneumovirus (2.5-9%) [20], Adenovirus (AdV; 6-28%) [21] and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV; 0. [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [18, 19] are increasingly reported [22] [23] [24] [25] . T-cell therapies that restore virus-specific immunity in the HSCT setting are a viable alternative to the traditional and often toxic antiviral drugs. Here, we explore the immunotherapeutic strategies currently used to provide immediate and long-term antiviral protection to adult-and pediatric-HSCT patients.",

DLI therapy was based on the assumption that unmanipulated lymphocytes isolated from seropositive donors should contain populations of virus-specific T cells that were able to expand in vivo and provide antiviral protection. DLIs have proven effective in treating EBV-associated post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease (EBV-PTLD) [26] , an AdV urinary tract infection [27] , CMV reactivation [28], HHV-6 encephalopathy [29] and persistent RSV pneumonia [30] . However, the efficacy of this approach is limited by the low circulating frequency of T cells directed against many acute viruses, while the substantially higher frequency of alloreactive T cells within the infused product significantly increases the risk of causing graft versus host disease (GvHD). Thus, in order to preserve the benefits and minimize the risks associated with DLI infusions, techniques to selectively deplete alloreactive T cells or to induce anergy have been investigated.",

In preclinical studies, Montagna et al. demonstrated that the co-culture of patient PBMCs with irradiated haploidentical (Haplo) donor PBMCs followed by RFT5-SMPT-dgA exposure resulted in cell populations that retained virus-specific precursors but exhibited diminished cytolytic activity against patient bone marrow [31] . Based on these results, Andre-Schmutz and colleagues performed a Phase I/II clinical study in which 1-8 \u00d7 10 5 allodepleted T cells/ kg were infused to 15 pediatric Haplo or matched unrelated donor (MUD) HSCT recipients between days 15-47 post-transplant. Despite the absence of GvHD prophylaxis, no cases of grade III/IV GvHD were reported, comparing favorably with a rate of 40% grade \u2265 II acute (a) GvHD in patients who were infused with just 1 \u00d7 10 5 unmanipulated DLI cells/kg [43, 44] . Furthermore, the infused cells appeared to provide antiviral protection. In patients with active infections, immune reconstitution was accelerated (absolute T-cell numbers of >1.0 \u00d7 10 9 /l within 4 weeks) and three patients with active CMV, a patient with persistent AdV and one with refractory EBV-PTLD were able to clear their infections post-infusion [33] . Allodepletion with RFT5-SMPT-dgA has also been used in the adult HSCT setting by Solomon and colleagues, who infused 16 recipients of matched-related donor (MRD) transplants (following reduced intensity conditioning) with a median of 1 \u00d7 10 8 allodepleted donor T cells/kg (range 0.2-1.5 \u00d7 10 8 / kg). aGvHD (grade I-IV) occurred in 46 \u00b1 13%, but the rate of grade III/IV GvHD (12 \u00b1 8%) was reduced when compared with a rate of 34% reported in previous studies [45] . Finally, our group has also investigated the safety and antiviral activity of allodepleted T cells and has demonstrated that a dose of 1 \u00d7 10 5 cells/kg was required to promote antiviral immune reconstitution in vivo [37] .",

To assess the potency of this approach clinically, Mielke and colleagues infused 24 HLA-identical sibling HSCT recipients (17-74 years) with 5 \u00d7 10 6 photodepleted-donor T cells/kg on the day of transplantation. Engraftment was rapid for all patients, but unfortunately the incidence of both acute and chronic (c) GvHD was high (38 \u00b1 10% probability of developing aGvHD [grade II-IV] and 65 \u00b1 11% cGvHD). Furthermore, complications associated with viral (20/24 patients reactivated CMV, two patients developed BK-associated hemorrhagic cystitis, AdV [n = 2] and BK + AdV [n = 1] and a patient died of RSV pneumonitis), bacterial and invasive fungal infections were both unexpectedly frequent and severe resulting in early termination of the trial [47]. Further investigation indicated that the high GvHD rates were likely due to the poor alloactivation achieved in the matched-sibling setting, while the photodepletion process preferentially depleted CD4 + and CD8 + memory T cells, including populations responsible for providing protection from infection [48] . Thus in ongoing studies, photodepletion is being utilized only in the Haplo setting and preliminary results are encouraging with only 2 of 12 patients developing aGVHD (grade I) [49, 50] .",

The HSV-tk cell infusions were well tolerated and administration of cell doses of \u22650.9 \u00d7 10 6 /kg supported post-transplant immune reconstitution (defined as circulating CD3 + T-cell numbers of greater than or equal to 100 cells/\u00b5L detected on two consecutive occasions), which occurred in a median of 23 days post-T-cell administration. Indeed, CMV-and EBVspecific immunity in infused patients could be detected within 3 months post-transplant. Interestingly, after a first wave of circulating tk + cells, the majority of T cells supporting long-term immune reconstitution did not carry the suicide gene and displayed a naive phenotype suggesting that the HSV-tk infusions were able to drive the recovery of thymic activity in adults. Of the 11 individuals who developed aGvHD (grade I-IV) and cGvHD and received ganciclovir, all exhibited a significant reduction (p = 0\u00b7005) in the circulating frequency of tk-directed T cells with resolution of GvHD, showing the transgene was functional. Notably, in these patients, the frequency of CD3 + HSV-tk negative lymphocytes was unaffected (p = 0.14) and virus-specific T-cell activity was not diminished. These data suggest that in patients with GvHD but without a viral infection, activation of the suicide switch results in the selective depletion of alloreactive cells but leaves the virus-reactive population untouched [55, 56] .",

Cell killing is restricted to dividing cells and induction of cell death may require several days, both factors that limit the clinical benefit of this approach. Furthermore, dependence on ganciclovir as a prodrug precludes its use as treatment of post-HSCT viral infections. Finally, the virusderived HSV-tk gene can be immunogenic, leading to the unintentional elimination of engineered T cells especially in relatively immunocompetent recipients. Indeed, in the aforementioned trial, all seven of the patients infused late (range 24-278 weeks) after HSCT developed a tk-directed CD8 + T-cell response [57] .",

Ten Haplo HSCT recipients (5-18 years) were infused with iC9 T cells (range 0.1-1 \u00d7 10 7 cells/kg) 30-90 days post-transplant. Four patients developed grade I/ II GvHD, but following a single infusion of CID, the circulating frequency of transgenic cells decreased by >90% within 30 min of drug administration. GvHD rapidly resolved without recurrence, despite subsequent re-expansion of residual transgenic T cells [59] . Remarkably, the residual transgenic cells were capable of providing antiviral benefit as demonstrated in three patients whose endogenous virus-specific T cells controlled CMV reactivation (n = 2) and an AdV infection (n = 1). Furthermore, like HSV-tk infusions, iC9 T cells appeared to promote endogenous immune reconstitution as evidenced by the detection of naive CD4 + T cells of thymic origin with no evidence of an immune response against the transgenic cells [60] .",

In historical controls who did not receive Tregs, the incidence Tzannou of grade II-IV aGVHD was 61%. Here, the rate of GvHD was reduced to 43% and despite the potential for indiscriminate Treg-associated immunosuppressive effects, the risk of viral infections did not increase. On the contrary, there was a reduced risk of infection (35 vs 45% in the control group) [62] . Di Ianni and colleagues also evaluated the activity of adoptively transferred Tregs. In their initial study, 28 Haplo HSCT recipients received both a DLI product (range 0.5-2 \u00d7 10 6 cells/kg) and fresh Tregs (2-4 \u00d7 10 6 cells/kg), which were isolated from a donor apheresis product by first depleting CD8 + and CD19 + cells followed by selection of CD25 + cells. The Tregs appeared to protect against GvHD, since only 2 of 26 evaluable patients developed aGVHD (grade II) and both were among the five that received the highest DLI dose. Moreover, the cell infusions were associated with accelerated-immune reconstitution with pathogen-specific CD4 + and CD8 + T cells detected as early as 2 months post-transplant compared with the previously reported 9-12 month timeframe. The infusions also correlated with a reduced incidence of CMV reactivation/ disease relative to conventional Haplo HSCT recipients (n = 150) [63, 64] . These studies suggest that adoptive immunotherapy with Tregs can limit allore-activity without compromising immune reconstitution and antigen-specific T-cell responses.",

Post-transfer the infused cells were detected as early as day +1 and persisted for up to 76 days in five of six evaluated patients.

To address these concerns, Knabel and colleagues developed a 'next generation' multimeric complex called the streptamer [69] . Streptamers can be easily dissociated from the T-cell receptor by addition of D-biotin, which causes the multimers to monomerize and detach from T cells within seconds, leaving the selected population pheno-typically and functionally identical to unmanipulated cells [70] ( Figure 1A ).",

Feuchtinger and colleagues first used IFN-\u03b3-captured AdV-directed T cells to treat nine pediatric (age 1-11 years) recipients of MUD (n = 3), mismatched (MM)UD (n = 4), MRD (n = 1) and Haplo (n = 1) transplants, all of whom had systemic AdV infections (n = 2) or disease (n = 7). The isolated cells, which represented a mix of CD4 + (63 \u00b1 10%) and CD8 + (29 \u00b1 8%) T cells, were infused between days 40-378 post-transplant at doses ranging from 1.2 to 50 \u00d7 10 3 cells/kg. The infusions were well tolerated with a single report of skin cGvHD aggravation and expanded in vivo, controlling infections/disease in five of six evaluable patients [74] . The same group also treated 18 patients (age 0.4 months to 59 years) with refractory CMV infections (n = 10) or disease (n = 8) after MRD, Haplo, MUD or MMUD HSCT using the same method. T cells reactive against pp65 were infused (mean 21.3 \u00b1 38.8 \u00d7 10 3 CD3/kg) at 19-308 days post-transplant with no side effects or GvHD. The infused cells expanded in vivo and overall 15 of 18 patients cleared or had a significant reduction (>1log) in their viral loads post-infusion, including two patients with encephalitis [75] . Peggs and colleagues reported similar success when using CMV-captured T cells prophylactically (n = 8) or pre-emptively (n = 11) in a Phase I/II clinical trial. In this study, despite the infusion of small cell numbers (median 2840 and 630 CMV-specific CD4 + and CD8 + cells/kg, respectively), the infused cells provided antiviral protection; only one of the prophylactically-infused patients required antiviral drugs within the next 6 months. Furthermore, 9 of 11 pre-emptively infused patients required brief antiviral drug administration (11-33 days), with no instances of reactivation [76] .",

Walter and colleagues used fibroblasts infected with the AD169 strain of CMV to stimulate CD8-enriched PBMCs, which were further expanded with either anti-CD3 antibody or CMV-infected fibroblasts and autologous-feeder cells. The resulting VSTs were administered prophylactically to 14 HLA-identical HSCT recipients in four weekly escalating doses (3.3 \u00d7 10 7 to 1 \u00d7 10 9 /m 2 ) starting 30-40 days post-transplant with no infusion-related toxicity noted. Only mild GvHD (grade I/II) was reported in just three patients, but remarkably none of the infused patients developed CMV viremia or disease. All 14 patients also demonstrated an increase in the circulating frequency of CMV-specific T cells post-infusion. However, in patients without endogenous CMV-specific CD4 + T cells, CD8 + T cell numbers rapidly declined, highlighting the importance of the helper T-cell subset in vivo [79] . Subsequently, Einsele and colleagues used an alternative method to prepare polyclonal CMV-directed VSTs. They incubated donor-derived PBMCs with CMV lysate for 10 days, followed by restimulation with CMV antigen and irradiated autologous feeder cells. After four stimulations, the final product contained both virus-specific IFN-\u03b3producing CD4 + (mean 77 \u00b1 10%) and CD8 + (mean 6 \u00b1 3%) T cells, and lacked alloreactivity even when donor and recipient were mismatched on three HLA alleles. Eight recipients of MRD, MMRD, MUD or MMUD transplants with ganciclovir-resistant CMV were treated with a single dose of 10 7 CMV-specific T cells/m 2 a median of 120 days post-HSCT (range 79-429 days). The infusions were well tolerated with no reported GvHD. All seven evaluable patients had a significant reduction (greater than one log) in CMV-DNA, which was durable in five. In two patients with the highest viral loads, the decrease in CMV-DNA was transient. However, a second infusion was sufficient to produce sustained viral clearance in a patient while the other patient refused a second infusion and eventually succumbed to his/her infection [80] .",

Hence, to activate and expand these naive cells in vitro, one requires professional APCs as well as potent, Th1polarizing cytokines, such as IL-7, IL-15 and IL-12 [100, 101] . Nevertheless, to test whether such VSTs can prevent/treat post-transplant infections, Hanley and colleagues generated trivirus VSTs (CMV, EBV and AdV) from the 20% fraction of the cord blood unit, and infused these into seven cord blood transplant recipients at doses ranging from 0.5-2.5 \u00d7 10 7 cells/m 2 . The infusions were well tolerated, with no early or subsequent GvHD, and protective in all five patients who were treated prophylactically. The two remaining patients had a CMV and AdV infection, respectively, and both were able to clear the viruses, even though a second VST infusion was required for the patient with CMV [102, 103] .

However, while this source is immediately available, one must also consider the potentially greater risk of GvHD associated with the infusion of lines that are mismatched at one or more HLA loci. Nevertheless, Haque and colleagues generated and tested the activity of third-party EBV-STs in 31 solid organ transplant and two HSCT recipients with refractory biopsy-proven EBV-PTLD. The lines for infusion were chosen on the basis of HLA matching and in vitro cytotoxicity of EBV. Patients received products that were matched at two to five HLA alleles in four weekly doses of 2 \u00d7 10 6 cells/kg. The infusions were well tolerated in these refractory patients and resulted in clinical responses in 64% at 5 weeks and 52% at 6 months. Subsequent analysis demonstrated that the level of HLA matching correlated with outcomes at 6 months and overall better response rates (p = 0.048) [104] . In a follow-up study, Vickers and colleagues infused lines matched at 3/10 to 9/10 alleles to 11 patients with EBV-PTLD post solid organ transplant (n = 5) or HSCT (n = 8). Eight of ten evaluable patients achieved a complete remission, including four patients with CNS disease. O'Reilly and colleagues also reported results from five patients with EBV-PTLD who were treated with third-party lines, four of whom were complete responders [105] .",

Since donor-derived VSTs are able to expand and persist long-term without inducing GvHD, our group has recently also explored the possibility of providing dual antiviral and antitumor activity by genetically modifying VSTs to express a tumor-targeted chimeric antigen receptor (CAR). Indeed, Cruz and colleagues modified trivirus-specific T cells with a CAR directed against CD19 and administered these to eight patients with CD19 positive B-cell malignancies (age 9-59 years) post MRD or MUD transplant. There were no infusionrelated toxicities and no GvHD. Since the cells were gene-modified, quantitative PCR was used to track the transgenic populations, which persisted for a median of 8 weeks in blood and up to 9 weeks at disease sites, and in two evaluable patients correlated with objective clinical responses. Moreover, CD19. CAR-VSTs retained antiviral activity in vivo, since two patients who reactivated EBV had a concomitant increase in the frequency of circulating EBV-specific precursors by IFN-\u03b3 ELISPOT and of the CD19.CAR Q-PCR signal, suggesting virus-induced expansion. Thus, this pilot study demonstrates the feasibility of conferring VSTs with the ability to target tumor-expressed antigens and provides preliminary evidence supporting the use of a single product to prevent both relapse and infection [108] .",

T-cell therapy to reconstitute antiviral immunity is beyond doubt a clinically safe and effective treatment strategy. Using rapid isolation techniques, it is possible to select virus-specific populations that can be infused within hours, while expansion protocols can be utilized to prepare cell banks for infusion in the donor-specific and third-party setting. Finally, since current mVST manufacturing platforms can accommodate additional specificities, one can now consider extending immunotherapeutic protection to other clinically problematic viruses including JC, HHV7, influenza, parainfluenza, human metapneumovirus, coronavirus, RSV and bocavirus to provide broad spectrum antiviral protection.
