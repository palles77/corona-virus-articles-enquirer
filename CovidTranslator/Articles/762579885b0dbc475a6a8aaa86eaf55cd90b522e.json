            "text": "HIV-1 Tat protein is an important pathogenic factor in HIV-1-associated neurological diseases. One hallmark of HIV-1 infection of the central nervous system (CNS) is astrocytosis, which is characterized by elevated GFAP expression in astrocytes. We have shown that Tat activates GFAP expression in astrocytes (Zhou, et al., Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 27:296, 2004) and that GFAP is an important regulator of Tat neurotoxicity (Zou, et. al., Am. J. Pathol. 171:1293 , 2007 . However, the underlying mechanisms for Tat-mediated GFAP up-regulation are not understood. In the current study, we reported concurrent up-regulation of adenovirus E1a-associated 300 kDa protein p300 and GFAP in Tat-expressing human astroytoma cells and primary astrocytes. We showed that p300 was indeed induced by Tat expression and HIV-1 infection and that the induction occurred at the transcriptional level through the cis-acting elements of early growth response 1 (Egr-1) within its promoter. Using siRNA, we further showed that p300 regulated both constitutive and Tat-mediated GFAP expression. Moreover, we showed that ectopic expression of p300 potentiated Tat transactivation activity and increased proliferation of HIV-1-infected astrocytes, but had little effect on HIV-1 replication in these cells. Taken together, these results demonstrate for the first time that Tat is a positive regulator of p300 expression, which in turn regulates GFAP expression, and suggest that the Tat-Egr-1-p300-GFAP axis likely contributes to Tat neurotoxicity and predisposes astrocytes to be an HIV-1 sanctuary in the CNS.",

            "text": "HIV-1 infection of the CNS is associated with neurological disorders ranging from mild cognitive disorder to HIV-1-associated dementia The paradox between HIV-1-infected target cells, i.e., microglia/macrophages and astrocytes and HIV-1-affected cells, i.e., neurons in the CNS has led to a number of indirect mechanisms for HIV-1 neuropathogenesis. HIV-1 Tat protein is present in the CNS, it can be directly from HIV-1-infected cells in the CNS, or derived from HIV-1-infected cells outside the CNS (Banks et al. 2005; Chang et al. 1997; Chen et al. 1995) . Tat can be taken up by neighboring neurons and other brain cells (Frankel and Pabo 1988; Liu et al. 2000) . Thus, Tat has been proposed to be one of the most important viral elements responsible for HIV-1 neuropathogenesis. A growing body of evidence has accumulated to support this hypothesis. Firstly, direct exposure to Tat is neurotoxic, so-called acute Tat neurotoxicity, through alterations of neuronal integrity, homeostasis and survival, neuroexcitatory property, endoplasmic reticulum calcium load, and oxidative state (Aprea et al. 2006; Brailoiu et al. 2006; Caporello et al. 2006; Norman et al. 2007 ). Secondly, Tat possesses a chemokine-like activity; its presence results in infiltration of monocytes/macrophages and lymphocytes into the CNS, which in turn causes neurotoxicity (Benelli et al. 2000; de Paulis et al. 2000; Jones et al. 1998; Park et al. 2001) . Thirdly, Tat alters neuronal gene expression through directly regulating gene expression mechanisms or indirectly eliciting intracellular signaling cascades (Liu et al. 2000; Peruzzi 2006 ). In addition to those direct neurotoxic effects, Tat can also affect neuronal function and survival indirectly by interacting with other brain cells such as astrocytes and brain endothelial cells (Andras et al. 2008; Chauhan et al. 2003; Kim et al. 2003b; Price et al. 2006; Toborek et al. 2003; Zhong et al. 2009; . In agreement with these findings, Tat expression in or injection into the CNS in the absence of HIV-1 infection is sufficient to cause neuropathologies similar to most of those noted in the brain of AIDS patients (Jones et al. 1998; Kim et al. 2003a) . It is evident from all these studies that Tat is a major contributing factor to HIV-1 neuropathogenesis.",

It begins to express as astrocytes mature, and its expression is always increased in reactive astrocytes, or astrocytosis, which is one of the main characteristics of the astrocytic reaction commonly observed in the CNS response to physical, pathological, or chemical insults (Norenburg 1997) . Interestingly, both over-expression and disrupted expression of GFAP are problematic and result in neuropathologies. Transgenic mice with higher levels of GFAP expression die prematurely , while GFAP knockout mice exhibit some developmental defects (Gomi et al. 1995) and CNS abnormalities in the white matter, myelination and the blood-brain barrier (Liedtke et al. 1996; Pekny et al. 1998 ). In addition, GFAP mutations have been linked to a fatal disease of infants, juveniles, and adults called Alexander's Disease (AxD) (Brenner et al. 2001) . AxD is pathologically characterized by formation of Rosenthal fibers (cytoplasmic inclusions) in astrocytes, which contain increased amounts of GFAP in association with stress proteins similar to that of GFAP transgenic mice (Eng et al. 1998 ). Thus, tightly regulated GFAP expression in astrocytes appears to be important for maintaining astrocyte function and CNS homeostasis. Nevertheless, the molecular mechanisms of increased GFAP expression during CNS injury are largely unknown.",

To ensure that this product was not an artifact derived from RT-PCR or a selection bias from generation of U373-Tat stable cell lines, we isolated primary embryonic astrocytes from inducible astrocyte-specific Tat transgenic mice (Kim et al. 2003a; ) along with primary astrocytes from wild-type C57BL/6 mice, the breeding congenic strain for Tat transgenic mice. We cultured these cells in vitro in the presence of 5 mg/ml doxycycline to induce Tat expression, which was demonstrated by RT-PCR using Tat specific primers (middle panel, Fig. 1B ). There was a 1 kb RT-PCR product amplified in Tat-expressing primary murine astrocytes (upper panel, Fig. 1B) . We then recovered the DNA from the agarose gel, cloned it into the TA TOPO cloning vector, and sequenced the insert. BLAST searches matched the sequence of this DNA fragment to p300 cDNA between nucleotide (nt.) 6475 and nt. 7436 (GenBank accession # NM_001429).

Meanwhile, we also prepared whole cell lysates from these cells and performed Western blot analysis using an anti-p300 antibody. Compared to U373.MG cells, U373-Tat cells had significantly higher levels of p300 expression at both mRNA and protein levels ( Fig. 2A) . To further ascertain this phenomenon, we also transiently transfected U373.MG cells with HIV-1 Tat expression plasmid and determined p300 expression in those cells and obtained similar results (Fig. 2B) . To further determine the physiological relevance of Tatup-regulated p300 expression, we infected U373.MG cells with VSV-G-pseudotyped HIV-GFP viruses, which were use to override the HIV-1 entry restriction in astrocytes and facilitate HIV-1 infection of these cells. The infection efficiency of these viruses was estimated to be about 40% (Fig. 3A) . We then compared p300 mRNA and protein levels between HIV-infected and mock infected-U373.MG cells. In agreement with the findings obtained from Tat expression, HIV-1 infection resulted in increased p300 expression at both mRNA and protein levels (Fig. 3B) . Moreover, we also infected primary human fetal astrocytes with the HIV viruses and determined p300 expression. The infection efficiency of these cells was about 25%, slightly lower than that of U373.MG cells (data not shown). Nevertheless, increased p300 mRNA and protein were also noted in those cells infected with HIV (Fig. 3C) . Taken together, these results demonstrate that Tat expression alone or in the context of HIV-1 infection leads to up-regulated p300 expression.",

To address this possibility, we transfected U373.MG cells with a luciferase reporter gene under the control of p300 promoter (Yu et al. 2004) along with increasing amounts pcTat.Myc expression plasmid and determined the direct effect of Tat on p300 promoter activity. Tat expression activated the p300 promoter-driven luciferase reporter gene expression in a direct and dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4A ). Since early growth resonse-1 is a major transcriptional regulator of p300 gene transcription and expression and there are a total of four potential Egr-1 DNA binding motifs within the p300 promoter (Yu et al. 2004) , we then performed co-transfections of the Egr-1 motifs-deleted p300 promoter with HIV-1 Tat expressing plasmid to investigate a possible role of Egr-1 in Tat-activated p300 expression. We found that deletion of Egr-1 DNA binding motifs completely abolished the activation activity of Tat on the p300 promoter. These results suggest that Egr-1 was required for Tat activation of p300 promoter and prompted us to further determine the relationship between Tat expression and Egr-1 expression in astrocytes. To this end, we performed Western blot analysis for Egr-1 expression in Tatexpressing astrocytes using an anti-Egr-1 antibody. Compared to U373.MG cells, U373-Tat cells had a much higher level of Egr-1 (Fig. 4B) . Taken together, these findings indicate that Tat activates p300 expression in astrocytes and involves the cis-acting elements of Egr-1 within the p300 promoter.",

We found a significantly elevated level of GFAP in p300-transfected cells (Fig. 5A ). Next, we determined the effect of p300 knockdown on GFAP expression. We took advantage of the siRNA strategy and transfected U373.MG cells with p300 siRNA. p300 siRNA was very effective in knocking down constitutive p300 mRNA as well as p300 protein expression, while the control siRNA had little effect (upper panels, Fig. 5B ). In parallel, p300 knockdown resulted in a significantly lower level of GFAP expression (lower panel, Fig. 5B ). In addition, we performed similar experiments in U373.Tat cells. p300 knockdown also effectively suppressed GFAP expression in Tat-expressing astrocytes (Fig. 5C) . These results indicate that p300 not only plays an important regulatory role in constitutive GFAP expression, but also directly participates in Tat-mediated GFAP up-regulation.",

To further ascertain the role of p300 in Tat-mediated GFAP activation, we also transfected U373.MG cells with p300 siRNA, followed by the pGfa2-luc3 plasmid and pcTat.Myc. As previously shown , Tat expression activated the GFAP promoter-driven luciferase reporter gene expression (Fig. 6B ). In agreement with previous findings (Fig. 5C) , p300 knockdown abolished Tat-mediated activation of the GFAP promoter-driven luciferase reporter gene expression (Fig. 6B) .

We transfected U373.MG cells with increasing amounts of the p300 expression plasmid followed by infection with VSV-Gpseudotyped HIV-GFP viruses, and then monitored HIV-1 replication. Surprisingly, p300 exhibited somewhat inhibitory effects on HIV-1 replication in these cells, although the inhibition was not statistically significant (Fig. 7B) . Meanwhile, we performed the MTT assay to determine whether p300 expression would alter the proliferation of HIV-infected astrocytes.

It is a multifunctional transcriptional co-activator with inherent histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity, mediates various cross-talks between different signaling pathways and participates in cellular functions including DNA repair, cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis (Blobel 2002) . These biological functions are primarily regulated via its HAT activity through phosphorylation and interactions with other cellular proteins (Kalkhoven 2004) . Compared to its well-characterized biological functions, only a very few studies have reported on its transcriptional regulation. Transcription factor early growth response 1 (Egr-1) has been shown to regulate p300 transcription through the Egr-1 DNA-binding cis-acting elements within the p300 promoter, intracellular signaling, or viral infection or expression of viral protein (Cai et al. 2006; Nair et al. 2006; Saegusa et al. 2008; Yu et al. 2004 ). Meanwhile, Tat is known to alter various intracellular signaling pathways Peruzzi 2006 ). In the current study, we showed that Tat expression in or HIV-1 infection of astrocytes led to p300 transactivation ( Fig. 1-3) and that Egr-1 was directly involved in this process (Fig. 4) . Although the underlying mechanisms for Tat-induced Egr-1 or p300 expression remain to be determined, cross-talk among various intracellular signaling pathways is likely involved. Tat-mediated p300 up-regulation appeared to be specific to astrocytes, as the opposite effect was noted in other cell types [our unpublished data and (de la Fuente et al. 2002) ]. Taken together, the current study provides further evidence to support the notion that transcription is indeed a regulatory mechanism for p300 expression and activity. In addition, these findings from the current study suggest that Tat likely exerts its plethora of effects on the host through gene expression involving more general and upstream transcription factors like Egr-1 and p300 (Fan et al.) .",

Our results demonstrated that ectopic expression of p300 resulted in increased levels of GFAP expression, whereas p300 knockdown led to decreased levels of GFAP expression (Fig. 5) . We further showed similar effects using a GFAP promoter-driven reporter gene system and astrocytes stably expressing Tat protein (Fig. 5 and Fig. 6) . These results suggest that p300 is important for both constitutive and Tat-induced GFAP expression. There are several response elements in the upstream region of the GFAP promoter, including nuclear factor (NF)-1, NF-\u03baB, estrogen response element, glucocorticoid response element, activating protein-1 binding site, and 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate response element (Laping et al. 1994) . Accordingly, the main regulators of GFAP expression are hormones such as thyroid hormone and glucocorticoids, growth factors, and inflammatory cytokines (Gomes et al. 1999 ). On the other hand, p300 regulates gene expression mainly through the HAT activity (chromatin remodeling) and/or binding to basal transcription factors and other transcription activators or other cellular proteins (Xu et al. 1999) . Thus, GFAP is probably one of the target genes of p300 in astrocytes. Interestingly, complex formation of p300 with STAT3 and Smads has indeed been shown to be essential for differentiation of neuronal progenitors into astrocytes, as assessed by GFAP expression (Nakashima et al. 1999; Yanagisawa et al. 2001) .",

            "text": "Quite a few studies have documented Tat interaction with p300 and its importance in Tatmediated transactivation of the HIV-1 LTR promoter. p300 acetylates Tat at Lys 50 and Lys 51 and enhances Tat recycling from the TAR complex to activate transcription elongation of the HIV-1 LTR promoter (Bres et al. 2002; Ott et al. 2004) . Meanwhile, Tat binds to and recruits p300 and other proteins to the transcription machinery within the integrated HIV-1 LTR promoter, which subsequently leads to transactivation of the LTR promoter (Marzio et al. 1998; Wong et al. 2005) . Consistent with these findings, our results showed that p300 potentiated Tat-mediated transactivation of the HIV-1 LTR promoter in astrocytes (Fig. 7A) . Interestingly, in the context of HIV-1 infection, p300 expression appeared to inhibit, albeit in an insignificant manner, HIV gene expression (Fig. 7B ). This discrepancy between the LTR-driven reporter gene assay and the HIV gene expression assay may be due to the state of the LTR, i.e., unintegrated LTR in the reporter gene assay vs. integrated LTR in the gene expression assay, or p300 interaction with other HIV gene products that differ between these two assay systems. Nevertheless, p300 expression significantly promoted proliferation of HIV-infected astrocytes (Fig. 7C) , suggesting that p300 up-regulation by Tat may contribute to virus persistence and latency in the CNS following initial HIV infection. It is clear that p300 up-regulation in astrocytes by Tat, as shown in this study, adds another layer of complexity to the axis of Tat-p300 interaction and its role in HIV gene expression and pathogenesis.",
