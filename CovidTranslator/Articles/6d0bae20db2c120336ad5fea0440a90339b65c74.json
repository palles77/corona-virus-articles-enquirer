            "text": "Many viral infections can be prevented by immunizing with live, attenuated vaccines. Early methods of attenuation were hit-and-miss, and these are now much improved by genetic engineering. But even current attenuation methods operate on the principle of genetic harm, reducing the virus's ability to grow, which in turn limits the host immune response below that of infection by wild-type. We use mathematical models of the dynamics of virus and its control by innate and adaptive immunity to explore the tradeoff between attenuation of virus growth and the generation of immunity. Our analysis suggests that directed attenuation that disables key viral defenses against the host immune responses may attenuate viral growth without compromising, and potentially even enhancing the generation of immunity. We explore which immune evasion pathways should be attenuated and how attenuating multiple pathways could lead to robust attenuation of pathology with enhancement of immunity.",

Early methods of attenuation were haphazard, relying on adaptation to viral growth in unnatural, artificial conditions to indirectly evolve a virus with reduced capacity to grow in the natural host. The fact that attenuation by this largely blind method was repeatable at all suggests that there is a broad window of viral growth reduction compatible with practical vaccine attenuation.",

Much of the guesswork in reducing viral growth rate is eliminated with genetic engineering approaches, and the engineering can likewise slow or block the vaccine's ability to reverse the changes and become virulent. Now, genetic engineering may be ushering in a third era, one in which attenuation is designed to enhance the immune response. Such 'directed attenuation' will require genetically altering (engineering) the virus in a manner that reduces pathology while enhancing the level of protective immunity. In this paper we use the term directed attenuation to refer to engineering viral genomes to influence the level of immunity.",

Adaptation to the unnatural conditions often -but unpredictably -reduced growth rate in the primary host (humans), with consequent loss of pathogenesis.

The scale for innate immunity is percent of its maximum possible value, and in this simulation Z attains only about 20% of its maximum. Parameters are chosen for a biologically relevant regime as described earlier [34] and are shown in Table 1. uated virus attains in a smaller peak density before clearance and thus elicits less adaptive immunity. To wit, a single infection with wild-type measles, mumps or rubella viruses typically induces lifelong immunity [35, 36] , while vaccine-induced immunity frequently requires boosting, as indicated by the CDC immunization schedule [17] . This basic trade-off provides a baseline that should be reproduced by any reasonable model of viral-immune dynamics: reduced viral growth rate should result in reduced viral density before clearance (reduced pathogenesis). There should be a consequent reduced stimulation of adaptive immunity and a lower final level of adaptive immunity. Our model indeed generates the expected patterns (Fig. 2 ). This pattern highlights the fundamental question of our study: is it possible to engineer an attenuation that is better than achieved by merely reducing viral growth rate -can we arrange pathogenesis to go down but immunity go up? Our approach to this question involves varying virus-effected parameters and observing changes in pathogenesis and in immunity, as done next.",

Blocking (reducing) any viral immune-evasion pathway leads to attenuation of the virus (Fig 3) . All are thus potential routes for generation of a live attenuated virus vaccine. But how might those changes affect the level of immunity? Blocking pathways that make the virus more sensitive to clearance by either innate (k Z ) or adaptive (k X ) immunity results in more rapid control of the virus but a lower final level of immunity. In contrast, blocking pathways that slow the generation of adaptive immunity (either by changing the immune growth rate, s X , or sensitivity of adaptive immunity, \u03c6 Z ) results in greater stimulation and a higher final level of adaptive immunity. Finally, suppressing the viral pathway accelerating innate immune decay (d Z ) prolongs the stimulation of adaptive immunity and increases its final level. Thus attenuation by modifying immune-evasion pathways described by parameters s X , \u03c6 Z and d Z generates the hoped-for outcome of reduced pathology with increased immunity. Attenuation of other immune-evasion pathways, such as those associated with changes in the stimulation of innate immunity (s Z or \u03c6 V ) or susceptibility to killing by innate or adaptive immunity (k Z and k X ), does not result in higher immunity.

The classical attenuation strategy arising from reductions in the single parameter r is seen to reduce both pathology and immunity (moving left along the horizontal axis in any of the top four panels). However, combining reductions in r with increasing the sensitivity of the adaptive immune response (i.e. decreases \u03c6 Z ) or increasing the duration of innate immunity (i.e. increases d Z ) restores the level of immunity generated by the vaccine to that induced by the wild-type virus (top two rows).",

This approach to attenuation is suggested by the fact that many viruses directly interfere with the immune response [37, 38, 42, 43, 39, 40, 41] , and those interference genes are obvious targets for genetic engineering. Targeting viral immune-evasion pathways compromises the viral load and in general results in a reduction of pathology. However, unlike reducing the virus growth rate which not only reduces pathology but also reduces the immune response, 'directed' attenuation might instead increase the immune response. Using a simple computational model of the immune response to viral infection, we indeed find that disruptions of some, but not all, viral antiimmune responses can attain the desirable goal of reduced pathology without compromising the generation of immunity. Our model allows us to identify characteristics of the immuneevasion pathways that should be targeted to achieve the desired outcome. Changing more than one parameter in the model allows us to explore the consequences of targeting multiple virus pathways. We suggest that an attenuated design that includes reduced viral growth rate together with disabling carefully chosen immune-evasion pathways would be ideal, in that it could provide enhanced immunity compared with natural infection along with reduced pathology, even in immune-compromised individuals.",

Mutant influenza virus lacking NS1 protein are highly attenuated in wild-type (interferon-competent) mice, but not in IFNincompetant systems such as STAT 1 knockout mice [53] . Viruses with a truncation or deletion of their NS1 gene have been shown to be promising candidates for a live attenuated vaccine in chicken [54, 55] . Type 1 interferon plays a role in reducing virus replication, which corresponds to a decrease in the growth rate of the virus (r) in our models without changing parameters that govern the generation of immune responses. Changes in only the parameter r in our model results in less pathology and a smaller immune response. This is consistent with the outcome of experimental infections of chicken with influenza virus vaccines that have deletions in the NS1 protein [55] . We suggest that it might be worth exploring the possibility of targeting other virus immune-evasion pathways so that the immune response is increased.",

These experiments would be along the lines of the studies of NS1 deletion of the influenza virus discussed earlier. The first step would be the generation of potential vaccine viruses by attenuating different immune-evasion genes, ideally in a graded manner. The vaccine candidates would be used to infect animals, allowing quantification of how different attenuation strategies affect both the dynamics of virus (and pathology) and the generation of the immune response. Intuiting the consequences of different mutations is challenging because of the non-linear feedbacks between control of virus and generation of host immunity. Consequently, models that incorporate the relevant details of specific virus immune-evasion pathways may help suggest combinations of pathways to be targeted, and analysis of the results will in turn allow refinement of the models. At a more basic engineering level, we suggest that in addition to compromising virus immune-evasion genes (e.g., knockouts or codon deoptimizations), directed attenuation can involve up-regulation or addition of genes that enhance the generation of immunity. Candidates for up-regulation or addition include pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPS) that induce the appropriate form of immunity. Studies on surrogates of protection [56] could help identify appropriate PAMPS for inclusion in the virus.",

            "text": "We have intentionally used simple models to illustrate the potential for directed attenuation strategies for the development of vaccines. This is because the particularities of each virus and its evasion mechanisms would require a model tailored to the relevant details, and generating one complex and general model is both unrealistic and intractable at the current time. There are some empirical complexities to include when considering the relevant details for a particular virus. At least for viruses with small genomes, genes with antiimmune functions may have pleiotropic effects, and it may be challenging to engineer them to retain other potentially essential functions while disrupting their anti-immune functions. Pleiotropic effects resulting from disruption of an immune-evasion pathway could be incorporated into the models by allowing changes in more than one term and parameter. The current models would need to be extended to include scenarios where the extent of attenuation (which we describe by a change in the relevant parameters) depends on virus density, as has been suggested for some non-selfish virus evasion strategies [58] . Our current models of immunity do not include different branches (e.g., humoral and cellular) or the complex differentiation pathways for the generation of immunological memory. Elaborations of the model are warranted, but any elaborations should be based on detailed consideration of a vaccination scenario for a specific virus. Simple models omit many details but have the advantage that they are often more robust than highly complex ones [32, 33] ; the current model incorporates the feedbacks between viral defenses and immune responses, which may be the key properties relevant to directed attenuation.",

This study uses models to explore the consequences of attenuating a virus by targeting the interaction of the virus with the host's immune response, rather than by the more traditional approach of targeting viral growth rate. This approach allows us to explore how new vaccines may be designed with the goal of maximizing the level of protective immunity generated. Contrary to the conventional view, it should be possible to engineer vaccines that provide stronger protection than that provided by natural infection.",

The sensitivity of innate immunity can be increased by reducing the virus density at which innate immunity is triggered, \u03c6 V or the rate at which innate immunity is stimulated s Z . As seen in Fig 3 In both these scenario's we find that there is a significant reduction in the pathology but only a small reduction in the level of adaptive immunity generated. The reason for this can be seen in the representative simulations shown in Fig 6A&B. We see that the more rapid generation of an innate response results in more rapid control (but not clearance) of the virus by innate immunity. As the adaptive immune response is needed for virus clearance we find that the duration of infection is not significantly affected and consequently the amount of adaptive immunity generated does not substantially. Thus changing these two parameters can lead to a reduction in the level of pathology and smaller reduction in the generation of immunity.",

A vaccine strain of virus that has an increased susceptibility to innate immunity will have lower pathology and lower immunity (as seen in Fig 3) .
