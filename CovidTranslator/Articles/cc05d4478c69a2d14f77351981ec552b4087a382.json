TNF induced MHC class I, but not class II, antigen expression on the surface of astrocytes but not on oligodendrocytes. Gliai cells do not normally express detectable amounts of MHC antigens. Thus TNF may play a role in the immunopathogenesis of neurologic diseases that involve MHC class l-restricted reactions.",

Nevertheless, under certain conditions, cells of the CNS may be subjected to immune-mediated reactions. In order to understand the pathogenesis of neurologic diseases with putative immunemediated mechanisms, it is necessary to identify factors that enhance MHC antigen expression on neural cells. Such expression, along with lymphocytic infiltration of the brain, is a prerequisite for cell-mediated immune reaction against CNS cells (Benacerraf, 1981) . Interferons and viral infections have been capable of inducing MHC class I expression on CNS cells (Lampson and Fisher, 1984; Wong ct al.. 1984; Massa et al., 1986; Suzumura et al., 1986) . In other tissues such as vascular endothelial cells and dermal fibroblasts, tumor necrosis factor has been shown to modulate MHC class I antigen expression (Collins et al., 1986) . Thus we examined the effect of TNF on CNS cells.",

Such diseases may include immune-mediated pathology, neoplastic diseases, and acute, latent, and persistent infections of the nervous system. In an experimental system, MHC class I antigen expression on oligodendrocytes and astrocytes is induced by soluble factors produced by infection of astrocytes with a demyelinating coronavirus MHV-A59 (Suzumura et al., 1986) . Treatment of rat astrocyte cultures with the MHV-JHM or measles virus caused enhanced expression of MHC, class II surface antigens and this could be further enhanced by treatment with TNF (Massa et al., 1986 . Either one of these systems may provide a model for immune-mediated pathology following viral infections. In humans, enhanced expressions of MHC class I antigens in the brain has been found in MS (Lavi et al., 1986) and in brain tumors such as glioblastoma multiform (Lampson and Hickey, 1986) . The possible involvement of TNF in neoplastic conditions in the CNS is intriguing because the most common CNS malignancies arise from astrocytes, the cells which we find to be susceptible to induction of MHC class I antigens.
