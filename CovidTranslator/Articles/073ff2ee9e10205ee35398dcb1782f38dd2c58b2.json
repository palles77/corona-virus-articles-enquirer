Antisera prepared by immunization of mice with the individual viruses were tested for their ability to neutralize both the homologous immunogen and the other viruses. By a plaque reduction neutralization test, each antiserum was found to be specific for the immunizing virus; however, there was substantial cross-reactivity, indicating the viruses were closely related. By kinetic neutralization, two of the viruses tested, MHV-JtIM and MHV-2, were found to be antigenically distinct. MHV-3 and MHV-A59 were found to be antigenieally very similar but distinct. These data show that kinetic neutralization is a more precise method for determining the antigenic relationships between murine coronaviruses.",

In general, MHV infection results in a persistent infection in the gastrointestinal tract of mice (2, 16) . The viruses become clinically apparent following a variety of stressful conditions, and as a group, produce a spectrum of diseases in which many organs are infected and affected. Although most isolates of ~H V exhibit some degree of hepatotropism, the individual members exhibit various J . C . CRILDS, S. A. STO~ILMASr, L. KINOSFORD, and :R. RUSSELL: a m o u n t s of organ tropism. Hepatitis m a y be the p r i m a r y disease produced b y some isolates; however, hepatitis can also be secondary to encephalomyelitis, enteritis, or the so called \"wasting disease\" (16) . I n addition, all MHV's analyzed have extremely variable pathogenicities depending upon the age a n d genetic background of the host. For example, the neurotropie strain, MHV-JHM, is lethal for 6 week old C57BL/6 and SJL mice, b u t it is nonpathogenie for 12 week old SJL (10, 11) .",

Table 1 shows the titers obtained when the antisera prepared by immunization with the individual viruses were tested for their ability to neutralize the homologous immunogen and the heterologous viruses. Each of the antisera tested was most reactive with its homologous immunogen, indicating by this criterion that each of these viruses had unique antigenic determinants.

Fig. l a shows that anti-MHV-JHM serum neutralized the MHV-JHM more rapidly than any of the three other viruses tested. By the kinetic test, the heterologous viruses were all neutralized to some extent by the MHV-JHM antiserum; but, no conclusive interrelationships could be distinguished. Each virus strain was tested after 90 minutes at 37 \u00b0 C for thermal degTadation and no significant heat inactivation occurred. Fig. i b demonstrates that the antisermn prepared against MHV-2 clearly distinguished the homologous virus from the other three MHV strains tested. Interestingly, there was no significant neutralization of the other three strains by this serum in the kinetic test although plaque reductions indicated a high level of cross-reactivity with MHV-3 and MHV-A59 (Table 1) . The antiserum prepared by immunization with MHV-3 exhibited interesting results in the kinetic neutralization test (Fig. 1 c) . As expected from the reciproeM test the antiserum showed little or no ability to neutralize MHV-JHM.

As with anti-MHV-2 and anti-MHV-3, this antiserum was also unable to neutralize MHV-JHM. The reaction with MtlV-2, however, showed an initiM neutralization rate that exceeded the rate with the homologous virus and then little or no subsequent neutralization. I t was therefore possible that the MHV-2 pool contained two populations that eould be distinguished by this antibody population but not by the anti-MHV-2 serum. A similar result, was suggested by the reaction of anti-MHV-3 but the reaction with anti-MHV-A59 was more distinct. To test the possibility that the MHV-2 population contained two groups with antigenically different major envelope glyeoproteins, the MHV-2 population surviving after 90 minutes neutralization with antiserum to MHV-A59 was repropagated in DBT cells. This virus was then tested by kinetic neutralization with antiserum to MHV-A59. The neutralization kinetics were identical to that of the parent virus, thus indicating that the apparent biphasie neutralization of MHV-2 by antiserum to MHV-A59 was a property of the antibody population and not the virus (data not shown). The anti-MHV-A59 antibody could differentiate between MHV-3 and MHV-A59, although even in these tests they are obviously closely related (Fig. 1 d) . Multiple kinetic neutralizations of MHV-A59 and MHV-3 using antiserum to MHV-A59 could distinguish between these two strMns indicating that they are closely related but distinguishable by this technique (data not shown).",

            "text": "strains isolated from laboratory strains of mice cause a variety of diseases in their natural host (16) . MHV-JHM is a neurotropic strain that primarily infects oligodendroglial cells in the central nervous system of mice (12, 13) . MHV-A59 is relatively nonvirulent in mice (9), while MHV-3 and MHV-2 are extremely virulent causing fulminant hepatitis (16) . However, these latter two viruses differ in that MIIV-2 does not form giant cells in vitro, a property characteristic of all other MHV's (4) . Although these isolates have been given different designations and treated as separate strains, there have been few attempts to define the antigenic relationships among these viruses or to conclusively prove that these isolates are antigenically distinct from each other. There have been recent reports of antigenic relationships among MHV strains tha\u00a2 have used plaque reduction as a measure of antigenic relatedness (3, 14, 15) . A careful consideration of the data in these reports as well as the data in Table 1 leads to the conclusion that MHV strains are all antigenicMly related; however, the interrelationships among the strains vary in each of the three studies, probably reflecting differences in the antisera and the use of 1V[ItV strains with different passage histories.",

This result suggests that the major envelope glycoprotein, which has recently been shown to be the site of attachment for neutralizing antibody is highly conserved (1). This is in agreement with oligonucleotide fingerprints of MHV-3 and MHV-A59 which failed to show any difference in the gene encoding of this protein (8) . Both antiserum to MHV-A59 and MHV-3, neutra.lized MttV-2 at a faster rate than either of the homologous viruses. The possibility that there were two populations in the MHV-2 pool was ruled out by retesting the survivors. Although no clear explanation is available, it is possible that the immunization of the C57BL/6J mice elicited a population of heteroclitic antibodies. These antibodies, which are frequently elicited in H-2 b mice, have a higher affinity for a heterologous antigen than for the specific immunogen (5) .",
