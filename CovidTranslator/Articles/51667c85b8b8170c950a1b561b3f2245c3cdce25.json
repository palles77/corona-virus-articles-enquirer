Clinical severity was characterized by composite scores (sum score) of symptoms in four categories: upper respiratory (earache, runny nose, sore throat and sneezing), lower respiratory (cough, breathing difficulty, hoarseness and chest pain), systemic illness (muscle ache, fatigue, headache and chills) and total severity (the above 12 symptoms).

We performed Kruskal-Wallis tests to examine species-specific differences in individual symptom score and composite scores. We then compared symptoms with P value of Kruskal-Wallis tests lower than 0.05 within each HRV species pair (e.g., HRV-A vs. HRV-B) using Wilcoxon rank-sum tests and false discovery rate (FDR) to adjust for multiple comparisons. Last, we compared the pattern of serial HRV detection by performing Cochran-Armitage Trend tests. Detection of HRV at consecutive visits implied ongoing viral shedding during that time period.

However, information on the frequency of HRV-C detection in adults with respiratory illness is less consistent, ranging from 4.8% to 30% [7, 14, [23] [24] [25] , regardless of patients' comorbid status. It is unclear why such variation existed in adult population. While our data, along with others', suggest age differences in the prevalence of HRV species, there are as yet no data explaining reasons of these differences.

While symptoms related to HRV infection are generally mild among patients without underlying health conditions, such species-specific variation implies differences in viral pathogenesis and/or host immunity.

Since we restricted enrollment to children without underlying conditions, it is possible that HRV-C is not more severe than other HRV species in this group. This finding adds context to the literature regarding HRV-C in children, suggesting that the observed higher severity of some HRV infections may be confined to specific risk groups. Persistent viral shedding may indicate different levels of virulence, host immune response and infectiousness [32, 33] . In sharp contradistinction to influenza infection where children shed virus longer than adults [34-36], our data suggest that adults shed HRV longer than children. In addition, we observed adults to shed HRV-A longer than HRV-C. Longer shedding of HRV-A among adults may be correlated to more severe clinical presentation with such species. Further studies are needed to understand interaction of host response and viral virulence. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to describe speciesspecific and age-specific differences in the patterns of viral shedding during natural HRV infection.",

First, the small sample size, especially among children (n=23), may have precluded us from identifying an association between HRV species and clinical outcomes. Second, the study population was comprised of individuals who presented to healthcare facilities with ILI. This may not reflect the epidemiology of HRV infection among individuals in the community who do not seek medical care. In addition, the majority of HRV cases in this study were from a single site. This may limit the generalizability of our results to different geographical regions. On the other hand, our study population also had a relatively small proportion of hospitalized patients and may not be fully representative of severe cases of HRV infection. Third, symptom diaries were not completed by all patients. It is possible that some participants suspended use of their diaries when their symptoms subsided. To address this, we performed a sensitivity analysis using data only from participants who completed the diary per protocol (n=42). The analysis confirmed the results that adult patients with HRV-A had higher composite severity scores than those with HRV-B (data not shown). Finally, shedding of virus was measured by detection of RNA, not using cell culture. The fastidious nature of HRV has led to the use of PCR as the main tool for detection, so we feel this is acceptable, though it is only inferential of infectious particles. In addition, the duration of shedding was measured by consecutive detection of HRV in nasal swabs while genotyping was performed for only the baseline specimen. It is possible that the HRV detected at subsequent visits could have been new infections.",

Our findings may inform development of strategies for prevention of HRV disease and transmission. Moreover, studies are needed to understand host-pathogen interactions across HRV species in different age groups, which will ultimately lead to improved clinical management of severe HRV infection.

This region was selected for sequencing because VP4/VP2 is the most commonly studied region of HRV. For direct sequencing of viral nucleic acids from clinical specimens, gene fragments were amplified and sequenced with the use of a Big Dye terminator cycle sequencing kit (version 3.1, Applied Biosystems) and internal primers Generic F HRV (AGCCTGCGTGGCKGCC) and NCR2 HRV (ACTACTTTGGGTGTCCGTGTTTC) on a Genetic Analyzer system (version 3130xL, Applied Biosystems). Nucleotide sequences of PCR products (n=441 nt) were analyzed by sequencing using Sequencher and BioEdit (version 7.0.0, Isis Pharmaceuticals, Inc.) software and then aligned with the CLUSTAL X version 2.0.1 software to compare with HRV sequences from the GenBank database. Phylogenetic trees were constructed by the neighbor-joining method in MEGA software (version 5). The statistical significance of the tree topology was tested by bootstrapping (1,000 replicas). Pairwise distances between and within the genotypes at the nucleotide level were calculated with Kimura 2 parameters and with Poisson correction at the amino acid level with MEGA software. Nucleotide sequences from our study samples are available at GenBank (accession number: KF957884-KF957967 and KF957971).",
