Acyclovir is excreted by the kidney and the half-life and total body clearance of ACV are dependent on renal function. In patients with normal renal function, the half-life is 2.9 hours; in neonates, it is slightly longer at 3.8 hours; and in anuric patients it increases to 18 hours. 50 After infusion of a 5 mg per kg per 8 hours, peak plasma concentrations average 9.4 f-Lg per ml, with a trough level of 0.7 f-Lg per ml. After 10 mg per kg per 8 hours, the peak is 20. Percutaneous absorption of ACV is poor. 27 Renal excretion of ACV is by glomerular filtration and renal tubular secretion. The kidney excretes mostly unmetabolized acyclovir. Less than 15 per cent is excreted as 9-carboxymethoxy-methylguanine or as other metabolites. Tubular secretion accounts for 60 to 90 per cent of an administered dose.",

Genital herpes simplex infections initially were treated with topical ACV and the duration of viral shedding was significantly reduced. Topical ACV was not effective in reducing time to crusting, time of healing, development of new lesions, or constitutional symptoms, such as pain, however.62 In addition, mild transient burning or pain was associated with topical application. It recently has been shown that the poor clinical response is due to the failure of topical acyclovir in a polyethylene glycol base to penetrate the skin. 27 Treatment with oral ACV has replaced topical acyclovir as the treatment of choice for genital herpes infections. Use of oral ACV shortens the mean duration of viral shedding, time of crusting, time of healing, duration of local pain, and constitutional symptoms. 56 ACV can be given intravenously for severe primary genital herpes simplex infections; it substantially decreases symptoms, duration of lesions, and complications. 18 Treatment with oral ACV has been successful for recurrent genital herpes. When ACV therapy was instituted within 48 hours of the appearance of a lesion, the duration of viral shedding was shortened and healing was faster. In situations where patients started therapy as soon as possible after the appearance of new lesions, there were similar changes in the time to crusting, healing, and duration of viral shedding. In addition, fewer new lesions formed. 63 Oral ACV also suppresses recurrent herpes simplex virus-2 infections; recurrent lesions appear but are significantly fewer in number than in untreated cases. The therapy is well tolerated with long-term use. After 4 months of suppressive therapy, resistant strains have not been found, but long-term suppressive therapy with ACV may result in the development of drug resistance. 48, 76 Most resistant isolates so far have come from immu-nocompromised patients who received multiple courses of therapy for active infection. 3o These resistant strains typically are deficient in thymidine kinase.",

Mortality in Lassa fever has been directly related to two risk factors: high levels of aspartate aminotransferases and viremia. Patient groups with one of these risk factors treated with oral or intravenous ribavirin had mortality reduced from 71 to 31 per cent compared with those groups that were treated with Lassa fever immune plasma. 54 Ribavirin has been shown to be effective in animal models for infections with the Junin virus, the agent of Argentine hemorrhagic fever, and with Machupo virus, the agent of Bolivian hemorrhagic fever. Ribavirin decreased the viremia and increased survival, although the animals ultimately died from subsequent encephalitis.'12 Finally, in animals, ribavirin has been shown to inhibit growth of the vesicular stomatitis virus. 77 Dose and Administration. Ribavirin is delivered by oxygen mask as a small particle aerosol. The drug is administered by means of a specific small particle Collison generator that produces an aerosol with a median particle size of about 1.4 mm. The concentration of ribavirin in the reservoir is 20 mg per ml. The dose of ribavirin delivered is estimated to be 0.8 mg per kg per hour of administration. 17 Aerosol administration in this manner results in high levels in the respiratory secretions with little systemic absorption. For RSV and influenza infections, ribavirin is given continually (12 to 18 hours per day) except during meals. It is given for at least 3 days but no more than 7. The highest concentrations are obtained when administration is via endotracheal tube rather than by oxygen hood, mask, or tent. The Collison generator is supplied by ICN Pharmaceuticals, the manufacturer of ribavirin (Virazole).",

Cellular enzymes convert adenine arabinoside (vidarabine) to adenine arabinoside triphosphate, which directly inhibits the DNA polymerase of herpes simplex virus. It also may act as a substrate for incorporation into herpes virus DNA (Fig. 3) . The triphosphate compound acts as a chain terminator for newly synthesized herpes simplex DNA. The primary metabolite is hypoxanthine arabinoside (Ara-Hx), which has 30 to 50 times less activity than Ara-A.28 Ara-Hx, however, seems to enhance the activity of Ara-A. 13 Ara-A also inhibits S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase in vitro and in red blood cells from patients treated with Ara-A. S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase is an enzyme involved in transmethylation. The effect of Ara-A on this enzyme persists after the cessation of therapy and may explain the toxicity of Ara-A.",

Following infusion, vidarabine rapidly is metabolized by adenosine deaminase to Ara-Hx. Plasma levels peak at 3 to 6 fLg per ml with almost no detectable levels of vidarabine. Ara-Hx crosses the blood-brain barrier and is present in the cerebrospinal fluid at 35 per cent of plasma concentration. Vidarabine is renally cleared, 40 to 53 per cent as Ara-Hx and 1 to 3 per cent as vidarabine. The serum half-life is about 3.5 hours in adults. Vidarabine can be detected in red blood cells 1 to 3 weeks after ending therapy. With renal insufficiency, plasma Ara-Hx concentrations are elevated and may increase the risk of toxicity. A 25 per cent reduction in dosage is recommended for severe renal insufficiency. Vidarabine is removed during hemodialysis. 2 Toxicity and Adverse Reactions. The major side effects of vidarabine are nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, anorexia, and weight loss. Because of poor solubility, the drug must be administered in 1.5 to 2.5 L of fluid. The daily dosage is 15 mg per kg per day. At conventional doses, no liver, renal, or bone marrow toxicity has been seen. But at a dosage of 20 mg per kg per day, megaloblastic bone marrow changes, with anemia, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia have been reported. Infusion-related thrombophlebitis, weakness, rash, hypokalemia, and the inappropriate antidiuretic hormone syndrome also have been reported. 66 Neurotoxicities have been described, including pain syndromes of the extremities that can last up to 6 months after cessation of therapy. Intention tremors, grimaces, myoclonus, ataxia, mood and behavior changes, dysgraphia, disorientation, aphasia, depression, mutism, agitation, and hallucinations also have been seen. Coma and seizures are rare. High dosages and pre-existing hepatic or renal failure are predisposing risk factors and the concomitant use of interferon or allopurinol increases the risk of toxicity. Serum concentrations of Ara-Hx were found to be higher in toxic patients.",

In AIDS patients, maintenance therapy appears to be necessary to prevent reoccurrence.: J Reversal of retinitis has been seen with DHPG, but more often treatment just stabilizes and arrests furthcr progression of retinal damage. [.3.32 In animal studics, comparison of ACV and DHPG for therapy in C~IV pncumonitis showed that DHPG was more effective than ACV in reducing the concentration of live virus in lung tissue and salivary glands. Both drugs reduced the severity of pneumonitis but neither was able to prevent it. 72 - In a study of C~V pneumonitis in transplant patients, DHPG therapy suppressed viral replication with cessation of viremia and viruria; in addition, CMV was eliminated from respiratory secretions. DHPG did not promptly reverse progressive infection despite good in vitro and in vivo antiviral effects, and no improvement in survival occurred.

IFN-a and IFN-!3 are structurally related and are produced in response to viral infections or polyribonucleotide administration. IFN -'Y is structurally different and is produced in response to a specific antigenic stimulus. 24 Mechanism of Action. Interferons act by reversibly binding to a ganglioside and to a second specific cell surface receptor. Then through a series of intermediate metabolic steps, cytoplasmic enzymes (endonuclease, 2-5 oligoadenylate synthetase, and protein kinase) are activated. Finally, these enzymes inhibit transcription, translation, assembly, and release of virus. 80 Cells that do not possess interferon receptors are resistant to the drug. An antiviral state takes several hours to develop and may persist for days.

'9, ~o In our study, intranasal IFN -ex use decreased rhinovirus-induced nasal symptoms by 33 per cent and resulted in 41 per cent fewer episodes of respiratory illness. In another study, treated subjects exposed to rhinovirus had 76 per cent fewer symptomatic days and 86 per cent fewer illnesses than the placebo group. 22 In a further study, interferon helped control the spread of colds among family members.34 Prophylactic use of interferon intranasally has been shown to shorten and reduce the severity of cold symptoms when challenged with a coronavirus. 78 IFN -ex given prophylactically by the subcutaneous route can suppress recurrent genital herpes simplex virus infections. There are a decreased number of recurrences, shorter duration of lesions, and milder symptoms. The beneficial effect of IFN -ex depends on continued administration. Once the prodrome begins, IFN-ex has no effect on the clinical course of recurrent herpes. 4.5 IFN-ex inhibits HIV replication in vitroY Interferon is effective against anogenital warts caused by papilloma virus,12 but infection with HIV seems to reduce the therapeutic response of anogenital warts to the drug. 21 There are abnormal levels or types of IFN in AIDS patients.
