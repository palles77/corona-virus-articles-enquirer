In this study, we describe and update the incidence, risk factors, and outcomes of IPS. We performed a retrospective cohort study of all adults who underwent allogeneic HCT at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center between 2006 and 2013 (n = 1829). IPS was defined using the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute consensus definition: multilobar airspace opacities on chest imaging, absence of lower respiratory tract infection, and hypoxemia. We described IPS incidence and mortality within 120 and 365 days after HCT. We examined conditioning intensity (nonmyeloablative versus myeloablative with high-dose total body irradiation [TBI] versus myeloablative with low-dose TBI) as an IPS risk factor in a time-to-event analysis using Cox models, controlled for age at transplant, HLA matching, stem cell source, and pretransplant Lung function Score (a combined measure of impairment in Forced Expiratory Volume in the first second (FEV 1 ) and Diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO)). Among 1829 HCT recipients, 67 fulfilled IPS criteria within 120 days (3.7%). Individuals who developed IPS were more likely to be black/non-Hispanic versus other racial groups and have severe pulmonary impairment but were otherwise similar to participants without IPS. In adjusted models, myeloablative conditioning with high-dose TBI was associated with increased risk of IPS (hazard ratio, 2.5; 95% confidence interval, 1.2 to 5.2). Thirty-one patients (46.3%) with IPS died within the first 120 days of HCT and 47 patients (70.1%) died within 365 days of HCT. In contrast, among the 1762 patients who did not acquire IPS in the first 120 days, 204 (11.6%) died within 120 days of HCT and 510 (29.9%) died within 365 days of HCT. Our findings suggest that although the incidence of IPS may be declining, it remains associated with post-transplant mortality. Future study should focus on early detection and identifying pathologic mediators of IPS to facilitate timely, targeted therapies for those most susceptible to lung injury post-HCT.",

Using updated molecular techniques for the detection of infectious pathogens in the lung, Seo et al.

The significance of these viruses in the pathogenicity of pneumonia remains unclear, but emerging evidence suggests that at least in the case of Human Herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6), these viruses may lead to lung injury and raise plausible concern that IPS may have been misdiagnosed in earlier studies [4, 7, 8] .",

However, increased utilization of reduced-intensity conditioning regimens, improvements in prevention and treatment of acute GVHD, the introduction of umbilical cord blood stem cells, and improvements in the prevention and control of infectious complications have changed HCT-recipient exposures and may alter the spectrum of lung injury in patients who have undergone allogeneic HCT [5] .",

TBI dose fractionation schedules were tailored to the patient's conditioning protocol. In general, our institution's standard treatment protocol delivers 12-Gy total doses as twice-daily fractions of 2 Gy each over 3 consecutive days and 13.2-Gy total doses as twice-daily fractions of 1.65 Gy each over 4 consecutive days (dose rate, 6 to 25 cGy/min). Reduced-intensity nonmyeloablative regimens contained 2 to 4 Gy TBI with or without fludarabine. Most patients received immunosuppressive drugs, usually a calcineurin inhibitor and mycophenolate mofetil, for GVHD prophylaxis. Antimicrobial prophylaxis consisted of levofloxacin during neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count (ANC) 500 cells/mm 3 ), acyclovir, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and fluconazole or a mold-active triazole. Preemptive therapy was used for cytomegalovirus (CMV) on the basis of weekly antigen or DNA testing [11] .

Serum and BAL were routinely tested for Aspergillus with the galactomannan index using the Bio-Rad Platelia Assay (Hercules, CA) [13] . In addition, a multiplex quantitative reverse-transcriptase PCR panel was used to detect 12 respiratory viruses, including influenza A, influenza B, RSV, parainfluenza virus types 1 to 4, adenovirus, human metapneumovirus, coronavirus, rhinovirus, and bocavirus [14] . Invasive fungal infections were defined according to the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer/Mycoses Study Group criteria [15] . Bacterial pneumonia was diagnosed if the BAL culture grew 10 4 or more colony-forming units per milliliter of pathogenic gram-positive cocci or if any number of gramnegative rods or other pathogens were isolated in the setting of compatible radiographic changes. Viral pneumonia was diagnosed if 40 PCR copies/mL of pneumonia-causing respiratory viruses were isolated. Because HHV-6 is a known human pathogen and may play a role in the pathogenesis of IPS [7] , we retrospectively tested remnants of clinical BAL samples available in local biorepositories for HHV-6 (n = 74). Participants with HHV-6 identified at 40 PCR/copies per microliter were censored on date of bronchoscopy (n = 9).",

Comparing cumulative incidence of IPS among allogeneic HCT patients after nonmyeloablative (blue line, n = 790) versus myeloablative with high-dose TBI (red line, n = 331) versus myeloablative conditioning with low-dose TBI (green line, n = 708) were 3.2% versus 6.6% versus 2.8%, respectively (P = .005). 204 (11.6%) died within 120 days of HCT and 510 (29.9%) died within 365 days of HCT. Among all transplant recipients who died within 365 days of HCT, 11.9% (47/557) died following a diagnosis of IPS. Finally, in the 265 patients who underwent bronchoscopy for pulmonary infiltrates and an alternative diagnosis to IPS was determined, 139 (52.4%) died with 365 days of HCT (Figure 3) .",

We identified that myeloablative conditioning with high-dose TBI (12 Gy) remains an IPS risk factor and are the first to associate pretransplant lung function impairment with risk for IPS development. We observed a lower mortality of patients with IPS 120 days after HCT compared with previous cohorts [1, 2] , but found that 1-year mortality remained high. This observation confirms that IPS continues to be associated with significant morbidity but that refinements in supportive care, advances in the prevention and care of immune-related toxicity, and/or improved classification of disease may be driving improvements in short-term survival.",

Although myeloablative conditioning regimens that used high TBI doses were associated with IPS risk, myeloablative conditioning regimens with lower TBI doses were not. Experimental and observational studies support the role of TBI in IPS development. Murine models demonstrate that high-dose irradiation has multiple harmful effects in the lung. Radiation causes damage to lung endothelial DNA, resulting in cell death and acute lung injury, and simultaneously reduces tolerance to lung injury by promoting death of alveolar macrophage colony-forming cells, important mediators of pulmonary damage repair [25, 26] . In addition to total dose, several other radiation parameters have been identified as risk factors in the pathogenesis of pulmonary toxicity. There is general agreement that fractionated TBI is safer than single-dose TBI with respect to IPS [27] ; therefore, our center and others now use fractionated schedules. The role of the rate of delivering each TBI dose is debated [28] ; lower dose rates are generally preferred, and current American Society for Radiation Oncology guidelines recommend a dose rate of <0.2 Gy per minute [29, 30] . Finally, our center practices lung shielding, a technique to systematically reduce radiation exposure in the lung. The potential benefit from this practice is uncertain [31, 32] , and optimal protocols remain an area of active study.",

We observed that grade III to IV acute GVHD remained highly associated with IPS after adjusting for other risk factors but notably accounted for just a small amount of the observed relationship between conditioning intensity and IPS. One interpretation of this result is that conditioning intensity mediates the development of both acute GVHD and IPS, explaining the high correlation between these 2 syndromes. Interrelated immune mechanisms in GVHD and IPS lend support to this argument. In experimental IPS models, TNF-a and IFN-g mediate signal transduction cascades that orchestrate noninfectious lung inflammation and injury [9, 18, [34] [35] [36] . In models of acute GVHD, similar cytokine dysregulation promotes expansion of alloreactive donor CD4 + cells [19] . Moreover, it is hypothesized that lipopolysaccharide translocation from intestinal damage resulting from conditioning toxicity or acute GVHD may result in the neutrophilic alveolitis observed in the later stages of experimental IPS [9, 37] . Although we agree that immune-mediated lung injury contributes to the development of IPS, our study suggests that GVHD does not account for the totality of risk, and additional factors must be involved in the pathogenesis of early noninfectious lung injury.",

[4] most recently described an 87% (20/23 patients) 1-year mortality in patients who developed IPS within 120 days of HCT (study cohort 1997 to 2007) using similar diagnostic criteria. In the analysis by Zhu et al. [4] , median time to death following diagnosis was just 9 days (range, 3 to 92 days) compared with 43 days in our cohort. Although this may be influenced by longer follow-up in our study, we believe this provides evidence that recent improvements in supportive care along with advances in transplant practices may be responsible for improved short-term mortality. Treatment decisions were at the discretion of the provider, and assessing efficacy of novel treatment strategies was not the aim of this study. However, it should be noted that patients diagnosed with IPS typically received high-dose systemic steroids (2 to 4 mg/kg) and, in select cases of refractory disease, received the addition of etanercept, a soluble TNF-a-binding protein (0.4 mg/kg given twice weekly for a maximum of 8 doses) [38] [39] [40] . Despite improvements in short-term outcomes, 1-year mortality remains high. Firm conclusions cannot be drawn about this observation, but we speculate that profound morbidity resulting from IPS drives poor long-term recovery, and our data confirm that short-term survivors of IPS remain a high-risk group of allogeneic HCT recipients. Finally, the associations we found between the need for mechanical ventilation or other organ injury with poor IPS outcomes are consistent with results reported in larger series of HCT recipients [41, 42] . Organ injury likely reflects overall illness severity and not necessarily a distinct pathologic entity, but these observations are important and may aid physicians as they counsel patients and families regarding prognosis.",

Our single-center, predominantly white sample may limit generalizability, but the single-center design allowed for uniformity in practice pattern that may have improved our ability to assess for novel risk factors. The small number of cases restricted our ability to adjust completely for differences between patients with and without IPS, and it is possible that residual confounding exists; however, our very large cohort of well-characterized allogeneic HCT recipients allowed us to make several clinically relevant observations. Despite rigorous adjudication of cases, misclassification of IPS remains possible. We applied modern molecular techniques to identify previously occult viral pathogens, including HHV-6, but the possibility remains that we overestimated the incidence of IPS. Conversely, some patients with IPS might have been missed because of mild illness or because the patient was too ill to undergo an invasive diagnostic procedure. For these reasons, the incidence of IPS might have been underestimated.",

Future study should focus on improved classification and early detection. Elucidating the pathogenicity of previously occult viral organisms to determine better the balance between infectious and noninfectious HCT pulmonary complications is critical. Study of serum biomarkers to diagnose IPS noninvasively at an earlier stage in disease development has shown promise and would have significant treatment implications but awaits prospective validation [43] . Finally, understanding the pathologic mediators of IPS (and its unique phenotypes) is essential to the discovery of novel treatment modalities and necessary to further improve long-term outcomes. ",
