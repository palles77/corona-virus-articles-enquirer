It is therefore concluded that most, if not all, circulating IFN activity must be derived from lymphoid cells. Moreover, it was shown that a high degree of antigenic homology exists between porcine and human IFN-ct: antibodies to HuIFN-~ could efficiently neutralize PorIFN-~, and they were used for its purification by immunoaffinity.",

Determining which species of IFN is made during the infection may help in understanding its cellular origin, and hence may explain some yet unrecognized aspects of the pathogenesis of coronavirus enteritis (Laude and La Bonnardi~re, to be published).

Each pool was thus loaded on a column of anti-HuIFN-0c globulins (KB163) and eluted at pH 2.4. The patterns of absorption-elution shown in figure 3 demonstrate that a major fraction of input IFN could be retained by the antibodies and eluted at acidic pH. The yield was 80 %0 for urinary IFN and 70% for seric IFN, and the purification factor was 100-fold. tedness of the two preparations was clearly established, considering both their spectrum of antiviral activity in a panel of mammalian cells (table I) and their  neutralization by the same antisera (table II and fig. 1 ). Actually, we could find at least one antiserum (sheep n ~ 166) which allowed a discrimination between PorIFN-endo and PorIFN-~ (table II) , which could suggest the presence of a minor non-alpha IFN fraction in the serum of infected piglets. However, we conclude that most circulating IFN which is synthesized following TGEV infection is alpha-like. This may have implications as to the source of this IFN in vivo, in view of the assumed strict enterotropism of TGEV.",

The extensive binding of PorlFN-a onto a column of anti-HulFN-= monoclonal antibody LO22 has been reported by K. Berg [2] , thus confirming the antigenic resemblance of human and por- The IFN activity eluted from the gel filtration column was directly loaded onto a 5-ml immunoaffinity column; then, washing and elution were performed as described in << Materials and Methods >>.

A = IFN from the blood; B = IFN from the urine. cine molecules. Two other monoclonal antibodies against HulFN-0t, namely HBA [17] and NK2 [18] , did not significantly bind PorlFN. This was not a surprise to us, because there must be at least some epitopes which are very dissimilar between porcine and human molecules. Finally, considering both biological and antigenic characteristics, PorlFN-0t seems to share with the HulFN-ct family the highest known degree of relatedness. Murine IFN-a has been previously shown to be antigenically related to HulFN-0t [9, 11, 19] , and also to be cross-reactive on human cells, but in both cases with a much lesser degree than PorlFN [11, 19] . Cloning and sequencing of novel animal IFN in addition to that of human and mouse species should aid in our understanding of structure-function relationships in the IFN molecular family. From this point of view, PorlFN should be regarded as one interesting basis of comparison.",
