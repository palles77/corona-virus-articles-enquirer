            "text": "Background: Previous studies support a strong association between viral respiratory tract infections and asthma exacerbations. The effect of newly discovered viruses on asthma control is less well defined. Objective: We sought to determine the contribution of respiratory viruses to asthma exacerbations in children with a panel of PCR assays for common and newly discovered respiratory viruses. Methods: Respiratory specimens from children aged 2 to 17 years with asthma exacerbations (case patients, n 5 65) and with well-controlled asthma (control subjects, n 5 77), frequency matched by age and season of enrollment, were tested for rhinoviruses, enteroviruses, respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus, coronaviruses 229E and OC43, parainfluenza viruses 1 to 3, influenza viruses, adenoviruses, and human bocavirus. Results: Infection with respiratory viruses was associated with asthma exacerbations (63.1% in case patients vs 23.4% in control subjects; odds ratio, 5.6; 95% CI, 2.7-11.6). Rhinovirus was by far the most prevalent virus (60% among case patients vs 18.2% among control subjects) and the only virus significantly associated with exacerbations (odds ratio, 6.8; 95% CI, 3.2-14.5). However, in children without clinically manifested viral respiratory tract illness, the prevalence of rhinovirus infection was similar in case patients (29.2%) versus control subjects (23.4%, P > .05). Other viruses detected included human metapneumovirus (4.6% in patients with acute asthma vs 2.6% in control subjects), enteroviruses (4.6% vs 0%), coronavirus 229E (0% vs 1.3%), and respiratory syncytial virus (1.5% vs 0%). Conclusion: Symptomatic rhinovirus infections are an important contributor to asthma exacerbations in children. Clinical implications: These results support the need for therapies effective against rhinovirus as a means to decrease asthma exacerbations. (J Allergy Clin Immunol 2007;119: 314-21.) ",

            "text": "For more than 3 decades, viral respiratory tract infections have been reported as important triggers for exacerbations of asthma in adults and children. 1, 2 In early studies based on nonmolecular means of detection, viral infections were identified in fewer than 25% of acute asthma episodes. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] Results of recent studies based on PCR assays support a much greater role of viral respiratory tract infections in acute asthma. [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] A wide range of respiratory viruses, including rhinoviruses, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza viruses, coronaviruses, human parainfluenza viruses, enteroviruses, human metapneumovirus (HMPV), and the recently discovered human bocavirus, have been detected from patients with asthma exacerbations. [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] Rhinoviruses are currently recognized as the most common respiratory virus associated with acute asthma in school-age children, whereas RSV appears to be the most common respiratory virus associated with wheezing episodes and asthma in young children. [6] [7] [8] [9] 11, 12, 19, 20 Considering the discovery of new viruses and the recent progress in the development of drugs effective against respiratory viruses, 21-25 determining the spectrum of viruses associated with asthma exacerbation and the contribution of potentially treatable agents is important in the evaluation of intervention strategies aimed at decreasing asthma morbidity.",

Legally authorized representatives of the children provided informed consent, and the children, when appropriate, provided assent, after which study coordinators collected clinical information and biologic specimens. All participants fulfilled the study criteria for current persistent asthma (Table I) . Participants were classified as case patients or control subjects by a physician investigator at the time of enrollment. Because of the difficulty in differentiation of asthma from wheezing episodes of other origin in very young children, the lower age limit in the study group was 2 years. Criteria for case patients and control subjects, as well as a clinically manifested respiratory tract viral illness, defined as 2 or more symptoms, are listed in Table I. Because the capacity to detect viral respiratory infections is time sensitive relative to the onset of symptoms, participants with acute exacerbations of asthma were enrolled within 48 hours of admission to the hospital. To account for the known age-related and seasonal variations in occurrence of viral infections, we frequency matched case patients and control subjects by age and season of enrollment.",

            "text": "In this study a high proportion of children with asthma had a rhinovirus detected in respiratory secretions, and rhinoviruses were the only respiratory viruses associated with asthma exacerbations. These results support the findings of previous investigators that acute exacerbations of asthma are significantly associated with rhinovirus infection in both children and adults. 5, 7, 9, 11, 33, 34 However, the association between rhinovirus infection and loss of asthma control was limited in this study to children with clinically manifested symptoms of a viral respiratory tract illness. There was a strong association between asthma exacerbation and symptomatic rhinovirus infections, and the extent of the difference between case patients and control subjects suggests that rhinoviruses might account for approximately 30% of asthma exacerbations in children. The overall rates of rhinovirus detection in our study for both case patients and control subjects were comparable with those reported in other studies of asthmatic patients. [7] [8] [9] [10] 12, 35 A number of factors could contribute to a role for rhinoviruses in asthma exacerbations, including their ability for replication in the cells of the lower airway tract; stimulate an inflammatory response that contributes to asthma exacerbations; or both. 34 It is also possible that patients with asthma are more susceptible to rhinovirus infections. For example, a deficient immune response to rhinovirus infection, such as impaired type 1 cytokine production and defects in IFN-b previously described in asthmatic patients with atopy, might increase susceptibility to rhinovirus infection or impair clearance and result in more frequent or persistent rhinovirus. 34, [36] [37] [38] A substantial proportion of study participants (29.2% of case patients and 18.2% of control subjects) were infected with rhinoviruses but did not meet the study definition of symptomatic. Although the rate of rhinovirus positivity without accompanying acute respiratory illness was higher among case patients than among control subjects, this difference did not reach statistical significance. In a recent longitudinal study of healthy children, 20.6% of all rhinovirus infections were asymptomatic. 39 In our study, the rate of rhinovirus infection in asthmatic children without clinically manifested acute viral illness was substantially higher: 47.8% for all rhinovirus-positive case patients and 100% for rhinovirus-positive control subjects. The basis for this high rate of rhinovirus infections without clinically apparent symptoms of acute respiratory illness in asthma is unclear but could indicate a high rate of persistent infections possible associated with a defect in ability to clear infection.",

In addition, limiting enrollment to children with an established diagnosis of asthma eliminated children with transient wheezing episodes often caused by RSV. Similarly, limiting our study population to children older than 2 years might have also decreased HMPV detections in our study because most children appear to be infected with HMPV at a young age. 48 It does not appear that influenza was a substantial contributor to asthma exacerbation in the Atlanta area during 2003 and 2004. The absence of influenza virus detections in our study can be explained by the shorter than usual duration of the 2003-2004 influenza season in the state of Georgia, which might have reduced its overall effect. According to the Georgia Division of Public Health surveillance data, the peak in influenza activity in the state was limited to a 3-week period in December (http:// health.state.ga.us/epi/flu/fluupdall.asp). We might have missed influenza-positive children because of the small number of participants enrolled during the high-risk period (December enrollment, n 5 8).",

Although it is possible that the use of swab instead of lavage specimens decreased our detection rates for some respiratory viruses, the potential loss in sensitivity with the swab was likely compensated for by the use of very sensitive PCR assays that have proved highly effective in other studies. 27, 49, 50 A major strength of this study is use of a panel of very sensitive PCR assays for a full range of respiratory viruses. By enrolling patients over a full calendar year and frequency matching of case patients and control subjects by age and season of enrollment, we reduced potential biases associated with temporal and age-related differences in respiratory tract viral infections. Although there were certain differences in baseline characteristics between the case patients and control subjects (eg, by recent treatment, race/ethnicity, number of clinic visits, or hospitalizations for asthma in the past 12 months) that might have contributed to the differences in viral infection prevalence, none of these variables was significantly associated with rates of virus positivity and thus should not have confounded our findings.",
