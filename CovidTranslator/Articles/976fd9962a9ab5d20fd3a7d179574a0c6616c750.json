Intrathecal administration of interleuldn-l/~ and interferon-7 to rats p~'sults in a thermal hyperalgesia which peaks at 2 h post-injection but which is undetectable 8 h post-injection. Expression of mRNA for nitric oxide synthase type II (NOS II) was detected by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction followed by Southern hybridization utilizing specific oligonucleotides in spinal cord tissue from animals 4 h and 8 h after cytokine injection, but not at longer time points. NOS II protein was detected in soluble fractions of spinal cords from animals 4 h and 8 h after cytokine injection. In situ hybridization for NOS II mRNA revealed positive cells bilaterally in the spinal cord 4 h after cytokine injection in a perivascular distribution and scattered throughout the gray and white matter. Immunohistochemistry for NOS II showed a similar distribution which could only be partially accounted for by macrophages/microglia. These results provide evidence for induction of NOS II expression under conditions producing thermal hyperalgesia and suggest a possible role in this behavior for the production of NO by a variety of cell types in the CNS.",

Peripheral nociceptors innervating the area of injury exhibit increased activity, leading to neuronai plasticity and a hyperexcitable state in the relevant spinal cord dorsal horn. It is these neuronal changes which are thought to lead to hyperalgesia. The specific mechanism(s) underlying this plasticity are unclear but are thought to involve changes in chemical mediators which influence synaptic transmission in the spinal cord.",

            "text": "One class of chemical mediators which has been the subject of investigation in relationship to pathologic nociceptive processing is the excitatory amino acids. Significant evidence now exists supporting a role for Nmethyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor activation in spinal cord plastic changes, including spinal hyperalgesia (Meller and Gebhart, 1993) . Nitric oxide (NO) is thought to be the mediator of at least some of the effects of NMDA receptor activation; therefore, a role for NO production in nociceptive mechanisms including hyperalgesia has also been the subject of recent investigations. Meller et al. (1992a) showed that i.t. administration of NMDA or L-arginine produced a thermal hyperalgesia in rats as measured by the nociceptive tail-flick reflex which could be reversed with a NOS inhibitor, L-NAME, supporting a role for endogenous NO production in the facilitation of thermal nociceptive reflexes. In addition, histologic studies reported at about the same time showed that neurons in sensory processing areas (superficial dorsal horn and lamina X) are one of the subsets of neurons in the rat spinal cord which ex-hibit NADPH-diaphorase activity and nitric oxide synthase type I (NOS I) immunoreactivity (Dun et al., 1992; Valtschanoff et al., 1992) . Neurons anatomically positioned in the appropriate place for transmission of nociceptive information are therefore capable of releasing NO. Subsequent behavioral and histologic studies provided additional support for a role for NO in the mechanisms underlying spinal hyperalgesia (Meller et al., 1992a; Hama and Sagen, 1994; Steel et al., 1994; Yamamoto and Shimoyama, 1995) .",

            "text": "Following the idea that hyperalgesia results from neuron plastic changes, the presumption exists in all of these studies that spinal cord NO released under hyperalgesic conditions is derived from the activity of constitutive NOS I. However, it is also possible that NO produced via another isoform, nitric oxide synthase type II (NOS II), expressed in neurons, other resident cells, or even infiltrating cells, may contribute to hyperalgesia. In support of a role for sustained NO production in hyperalgesia, Meller at al. (1992b) reported that loose ligation of the sciatic nerve in rats resulted in a marked thermal hyperalgesia on day 3 post-surgery which could be blocked by a NOS inhibitor. Suggestive evidence specifically for the role of NOS II expression in thermal hyperalgesia was reported by Meller at al. (1994) . In these studies, i.t. administration of either interleukin (IL)-I/~ and interferon (IFN)-3, or endotoxin (LPS), compounds known to induce NOS II in resident CNS cells in vitro, produced a time-dependent hyperalgesia. Selective inhibition of glial metabolism with i.t. fluorocitrate resulted in reversible attenuation of the thermal and mechanical hyperalgesia produced by intraplantar zymosan, and selective inhibition of NOS II with i.t. aminoguanidine resulted in inhibition of the thermal hyperalgesia produced by intraplantar zymosan.",

This leads to the release of glutamate and other neuroactive substances from primary afferent central terminals, which results in NMDA receptor activation of neurons in the superficial and deeper dorsal horn areas. As a conse-quence of NMDA receptor activation, neuronal intracellular calcium increases, resulting in the activation of protein kinases, early genes, and NOS I, among other intracellular effects. Released NO diffuses to presynaptic neurons and adjacent cell bodies (neurons, glia, etc.) where it enters the cell(s) and causes an increase in cGMP due to activation of soluble gnanylate cyclase. This increase in cGMP is thought to ultimately produce a potentiation of synaptic transmission or a hyperexcitable state which is manifested by hyperalgesia and expansion of receptive fields.",

The fact that a control animal which received an i.t. catheter but did not receive an injection of fluid did not express NOS II suggests that i.t. injection may induce NOS II in some cells. The RT-PCR method used for these analyses was not quantitative; therefore the relative amounts of message induced with injections could not be assessed.

The cellular pattern and distribution of both NOS II mRNA and protein in 4 h samples was the same, suggesting that at least some of the NOS II expression can be attributed to macrophages/microglia or other inflammatory cells. A mild inflammatory response was also evident in tissue from animals sacrificed 4 h after cytokine injection; inflammatory cells occurred in perivascular locations and scattered in the spinal cord parenchyma, a pattern of distribution similar to that of NOS II mRNA and protein.",

            "text": "Based on these results, one hypothesis that can be offered regarding the involvement of NOS II expression and NO release in this model is that injection of proinflammatory cytokines into the i.t. space induces an inflammatory response in the cord resulting in the upregulation of NOS II in exogenous inflammatory cells as well as perhaps in some resident cells (e.g., microglia). Released NO under these conditions may affect neuronal and/or glial signalling. The time-course of NOS II expression observed in this study does not correlate completely with the time course of behavioral hyperalgesia in this model. While expression of NOS II in cord tissue was observed in animals at 4 h after cytokine injection, a time during which animals express thermal hyperalgesia, NOS II message and protein were also detected 8 h after injection, when thermal hyperalgesia is no longer demonstrable. Additionally, we observed cells positive for NOS II message and protein throughout all regions of the gray and white matter of the cord, not just in regions specific for sensory processing. (However, since we did not perform functional studies, we do not know how much of the observed protein is enzymically active). These observations do not support a causal role for NOS II expression and consequent NO release in the development of thermal hyperalgesia. Previous reports by Solodkin et al. (1992) and Hama and Sagen (1994) describe bilateral expression of NADPH-d activity in dorsal horn neurons after manipulations which result in unilateral behavioral hyperalgesia. These prior observations as well as the observations described in this study suggest that spinal cord NO (released via the activity of any NOS isoform present) may be a correlate of the neuronal hyperexcitable state. NO production may be just one of several neurocbemical changes in the spinal cord which ultimately result in activity-dependent neuronal plasticity expressed as behavioral hyperalgesia; however, the fact that hyperalgesia can be abolished in some models, including this model, with NOS inhibitors underscores the importance of NO in the development of this abnormal behavior.",

The induction of NOS II in this hypothetical scheme would be a parallel event, but one unimportant to the expression of behavioral hyperalgesia. While this hypothesis is possible, the fact that spinal cord NO is known to be important in the hyperalgesic response supports at least a modulatory role for NOS II expression and sustained NO release from any source in the synaptic events resulting in this abnormal nociceptive processing.",

Macrophages and/or microglia are most likely at least one of the cellular sources of NOS II; astrocytes do not appear to express significant amounts of NOS II under these conditions. Multiple hypotheses can be formulated regarding the role of NOS II induction and consequent NO release in the expression of behavioral hyperalgesia in this model. Without specific inhibitors for individual NOS isoforms, it has been impossible to define the exact role NOS II may play in the mechanism(s) underlying the development of specific neuropathologies, including hyperalgesia. With the recent report describing NOS II deficient transgenic mice (MacMicking et al., 1995; Wei et al., 1995) , the opportunity now exists to more specifically define the role of NOS II and NO production in abnormal nociceptive processing.",
