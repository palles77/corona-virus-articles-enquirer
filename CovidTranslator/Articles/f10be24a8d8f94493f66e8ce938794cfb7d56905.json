Second, due to the massive number of patients and the lack of medical resources, the interval from the illness onset to hospital admission was more than 10 days for most patients, which could further complicate and deteriorate the illness, with different extent.

The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared that Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection. WHO characterized COVID-19 as pandemic, as it has spread rapidly throughout China and more than 100 countries in the following two months after outbreak, causing more than 150,000 confirmed cases and thousands of death by March 15, 2020. SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the subgenus Sarbecovirus (\u03b2-CoV lineage B), and shares 79% of sequence with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV), but only 50% homology with Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) [2, 3]. China has a climbing prevalence rate of diabetes in recent decades. According to the latest nationally representative cross-sectional survey among 170287 participants in 2013 in mainland China, the overall prevalence of diabetes was 10.9% in adults and 20.2% in the elderly [4]. Diabetic patients are more susceptible to be infected by bacteria, virus, and fungus than individuals without diabetes owing to relatively lower immune function [5, 6]. As a result, these patients might be at an increased risk of of COVID-19 in Union Hospital of Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan. All patients with COVID-19 enrolled in this study were diagnosed according to World Health Organization interim guidance [10]. This study was approved by the institutional ethics board of Union Hospital of Huazhong University of Science and Technology and ethics board of Xiangya Hospital, Central South University (No.202003049).
