In the subtropics, especially during hot and humid summers, compact building blocks create stagnant air that worsens outdoor urban thermal comfort. The current study adapts the keu SST turbulence model to simulate air flow in urban areas. The accuracy of the keu SST turbulence model in detecting air flow around a rectangular block is validated by comparing it with the data from the wind tunnel experiment. In the computational parametric study, wind speed classification is derived based on Physiological Equivalent Temperature (PET) to evaluate the effect of wind speed on outdoor thermal comfort. Numerical analysis compares the effects of different building morphology modifications on pedestrianlevel natural ventilation. Critical design issues are also identified. From both the accuracy and practical points of view, the current study allows city planners and architects to improve building porosity efficiently for better pedestrian-level urban ventilation, without losing land use efficacy.",

In summer, a decrease in wind speed from 1.0 m/s to 0.3 m/s is equal to 1.9 C temperature increase, and outdoor thermal comfort under typical summer conditions requires 1.6 m/s wind speed [5] . Wind data from an urban observatory station of Hong Kong Observatory (HKO) indicate that the mean wind speed at 20 m above the ground level in urban area, Tseung Kwan O, has decreased by about 40%, from 2.5 m/s to 1.5 m/s over the last 10 years [6] . The frequent occurrence of high concentrations of pollutants, such as NO 2 and respirable particles (RSP), in urban areas like Mong Kok and Causeway Bay has been reported by The Hong Kong Environmental Protection Department because of poor dispersion [7] . After the outbreak of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government strived to improve the local wind environment for better urban living quality. Relevant studies, policies, and technical guidelines, such as Air Ventilation Assessment (AVA) and Sustainable Building Design (SBD) Guidelines (APP-152), have been conducted on the urban planning and design process [8] .",

The layer structure of the air flow above the urban areas has been widely discussed [9, 14, 15] . As shown in Fig. 4 , Oke [9] provided the logarithmic wind profile in a neutral atmosphere, which is a semi-empirical relationship acting as a function of two aerodynamic characteristics, namely, roughness length (z0) and zero-plane displacement height (zd). Grimmond and Oke [11] suggested a physical phenomenon to explain the need for zd in the function. With more and more new roughness elements being added to the surface, the new roughness elements decrease the drag force of those already on the surface because of mutual sheltering. The effective height of the canopy for momentum exchange is reduced. Therefore, to validate the logarithmic wind profile formula in urban areas, a new \"ground surface\" (zero velocity in the wind profile) is set to zd \u00fe z0 [16] , as shown in Fig. 4 . The height of the zero velocity level is found to be about 1.5e2 m below the mean height of buildings; below this level, any wind velocity profile is possible [14] .",

The RSM turbulence model, as an anisotropic model, attempts to consider the effects of Reynolds stress by using six equations to compute the \u00c0 < u 0 i u 0 j > directly. Therefore, RSM computation is more costly than the ke 3 and keu turbulence models, where 3 (turbulence dissipation rate), or u the (specific dissipate rate) is assumed isotropic. RSM is more accurate than the ke 3 realized model in flows with strong anisotropic effects (i.e., swirling flows) [31] . However, in normal flows, the accuracy of RSM is similar to the models by Boussinesq Approach [32] . More validation and crosscomparison studies are required for the application of RSM models in urban wind environment, especially in the low-wind, high-rise, and high-density urban environment. Both turbulence viscosity and RSM models are provided by the commercial CFD code, such as PHOENICS and Fluent. The current study applies the keu SST models in the computational parametric study. The keu SST model is a combination of the standard keu model and ke 3 model. Walls are the main source of turbulence; therefore, the accurate near-wall treatment is significant for useful turbulence models [33] . The standard keu model, as a near-wall model, is more accurate than the ke 3 models in the near-wall layers [34] . However, the standard keu model cannot replace ke 3 models in the simulation of the outer part of the near-wall region [34] . The keu SST model uses the standard keu model for the inner part and gradually changes to the ke 3 model for the outer part [33, 34] .",

Compared with the Mong Kok of 1903, the present Mong Kok is extremely high density; the population density is mean 130,000 per km 2 [38] .

Unlike the abovementioned classifications in which wind is a kind of \"nuisance\", the current study considers wind as a benefit. Therefore, this classification is based on the outdoor thermal comfort and not on the wind force on pedestrians or buildings. Ng et al. [43] conducted a survey to obtain the pedestrian-level wind speed threshold values, especially for outdoor thermal comfort in Hong Kong, using physiological equivalent temperature (PET) [44] . In a typical summer day when air temperature is 27.9 C and relative humidity is about 80%, wind speed of 0.6e1.3 m/s is required to achieve neutral thermal sensation (neutral PET: 28.1 C). In another survey on thermal comfort in Hong Kong [5] , the wind speed settings with and without wind break are 0.3 m and 1.0 m, respectively, which is equal a 1.9 C air temperature difference.",

However, other than these areas, wind speed is significantly decelerated, especially in deep street canyons across the wind direction. When the input wind direction is changed from 90 to 45 , air flow can enter into the streets from both directions (Fig. 13) . Therefore, areas with stagnant air are decreased. In the input wind direction of 0 , as shown in Fig. 13 , air flow can penetrate more deeply into the streets than those in the prevailing wind direction (90 ).

Comparison among Cases 3e5 provides a more detailed understanding. Wind profiles in Cases 3 and 4 suggest that, in high-density urban areas, building setbacks along the street across the prevailing wind direction (Case 3) are less useful than building separations along the prevailing wind direction (Case 4). On the other hand, the Case 5 ( Fig. 18b ) profile suggests that, if building separation is incorporated with building setback, the pedestrian-level wind speed on the leeward outdoor space can be further improved. 4) Wind permeability in the podium layer is very useful in leading air flow to deep street canyons. In Case 6, the building void between towers and podiums significantly accelerates turbulent flows in the podium layer, and the stepped podiums lead air flow to the pedestrian level. Air flow across the building void (10 m) are numerically presented as red lines in Fig. 18b . The mean wind speed on the leeward outdoor space can be improved to approach the condition in 1903.",

However, the levels of efficiency of these strategies differ. Natural ventilation performance in urban area results from the integral effects of buildings, therefore, considering the urban area as a whole is important. As such, air paths in the areas can be efficiently established and organized by applying different strategies to improve building porosity.

Aligning of the streets properly and leaving sufficient open spaces that can be interlinked are equally important, as well as complimenting the urban planning efforts with building level designs. Building gaps, separations, and porosity close to the pedestrian levels are extremely useful in improving air space for urban air ventilation circulation. 8) Increasing urban density has gained attention in recent worldwide discussions. Traditional wisdom attributes the decline of urban air ventilation to increasing urban density because of high urban frontal area density (FAD). This understanding is generally correct, and balancing the need to reduce land resource demand with designing more compact cities is also useful. The current study suggests that more insights should be gained to fine tune and design urban morphologies and building forms that \"optimize\" urban air ventilation. The optimization process can consider further the bio-meteorological needs of air ventilation in different climatic zones [5] . 9) Evidence-based decision making is important, especially for market or policy transformation [46, 47] . This understanding is only possible with scientific and parametric studies that examine the sensitivity and performance of various design and planning options.
