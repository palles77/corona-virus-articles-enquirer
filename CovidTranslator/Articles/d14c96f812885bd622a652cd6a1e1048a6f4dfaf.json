While some may think risk management is a recent phenomenon, a result of global warming and terrorism, it has been associated with resort management for a long time and in a variety of ways. In normal business, financial risk is a regular occurrence that should be recognized and managed like other factors of demand and supply. However, with the taking-in of guests comes an extra responsibility, known as 'duty of care', where management is obliged to protect their guests from harm to the best of their ability.",

Those who seek excitement in adventure tourism, when they challenge themselves or look for an adrenalin rush, purposely place themselves at risk and it is up to resorts to ensure the real risk is minimalized by managing the situation. Even those who have not come to a resort to exert or excite themselves regularly demand spectacular views and sunsets that often require building on risky sites and in nonconformist style. The sounds of the sea and uninterrupted tropical sunsets attract resorts to the water's edge in areas where hurricanes and cyclones occur with regularity. In the mountains, similar demands for spectacular views place buildings at crests or on steep slopes where local climatic conditions are at their extreme and avalanches can occur.",

Risk is present in the location of many resorts on the 'edge of civilization', well removed from regular infrastructure and services that are the basis of quality service experiences. It is present in the operation of resorts where guests come to participate in challenging activities, regular sports or simply to unwind, a process that inevitably leads some of them to leave natural caution and common sense behind at home.",

The consequences are generally limited to some temporary bad publicity, financial compensation, a revision of safety procedures and possibly new equipment. This level of risk is discussed under the heading of 'Security' within this chapter. Accidents are presented in the form of personal injury, where the probability of occurrence can be high when a resort is associated with adventure tourism or dangerous locations. Duty of care is still a major consideration, but if a guest chooses to undertake a risky activity they are expected to assume some of that risk. Under these circumstances resorts are expected to minimize the level of risk by preparing the site properly, instructing the guest where appropriate, and providing warning signs or professional help where warranted. This level of risk has been assigned a low consequences ranking in that it usually applies to individuals or small groups and through the implementation of 'Risk Management' these consequences can be minimized, but not eliminated.",

Bad weather or even the threat of it can reduce visits and sales, but in this era of global warming the signs of severe weather stress are starting to have an impact. The increasing number of Force 5 hurricanes is raising the insurance rates of all tropical resorts and not just those affected directly. The long-term drought in Australia's Alpine areas is creating poor snow seasons and raising questions about the ski industry's viability in these areas. Such events do not have the sudden impact of a site-specific natural disaster, but they can have a major say on the long-term viability of a resort business. In this regard such risks are incorporated into the overall framework of 'Sustainable Management', where the evolving weather patterns are integrated into the long-term resource planning for a resort.",

Staff should be trained to undertake their tasks safely, to keep an eye on guests and the general situation, and to note any external threats. These threats can include vandalism, theft or terrorism. The level of security will be determined by the perceived degree of threat in the local area, but some attention to this matter is necessary everywhere, for insurance and legal purposes alone.",

            "text": "Most businesses, including resorts can absorb small and infrequent losses brought on by seasonal fluctuations or occasional accidents, but will need to transfer the risk of large business interruptions or liability claims to outside suppliers of such coverage, such as insurance companies or brokers. Small losses and claims will still be a matter for management's discretion even when they have insurance coverage, due to the deduction or excess clause associated with their insurance premium. Most personal injury and damage claims can be accommodated within these parameters and involve negotiation with the affected parties rather than court cases, but if it becomes a major contentious court case insurance providers will become involved. Resort owners can also transfer risk to other parties via non-insurance responsibility. In terms of major recreation equipment, like ski lifts or spas, the supplier can be encouraged to guarantee the safety of its equipment if it is properly installed and operated. This often involves the supplier installing the equipment and certifying the operators. In terms of more hazardous adventure tourism activities the resort can sub-contract these activities to specialist operators who carry their own and independent insurance policies. Cloutier (2000: 104-105) provides some insights into actual risk management, as seen through the eyes of Will Leverette, who offers simple guidelines based on the real experience of lawsuits and consultations with adventure tourism companies. According to Leverette there are six basic rules to follow:",

(Glaesser, 2003: 8) This approach places the emphasis of crisis management on the response and recovery phases of a crisis and brings it into line with disaster planning which has its own four-stage process of: assessment-warningimpact-recovery (Foster, 1980) . It is natural disasters which often trigger crisis within the tourism industry be they earthquakes (Kyoto -1995) , volcanic eruptions (Mount St Helens -1980), forest fires (Yellowstone National Park -1988), tsunami (Phuket -2004) or hurricanes (New Orleans -2005) . One should not forget that human beings can and do create their own crises for tourism and the resort industry. Wars, terrorism and political decisions can bring about dramatic declines in visitation due to the prospect of danger or the removal of access. King and Berno (2002) provide a good example of this in their analysis of the impact of Fiji's two coups in 1987 and 2000 on the local tourist trade, which is heavily resort oriented. They note that: like many other tropical island nations, Fiji has long established procedures in place to deal with emergencies such as cyclones. This meant that the overall preparedness in 1987 was relatively good with provision to contact hotels across the country with advice on how to react (King and Berno, 2002: 49) Such an experience demonstrates strong synergistic links can exist between natural disaster and human crisis management.",

For many resort destinations these advisories have both positive and negative features. On the positive side they provide up-to-date and comparable risk assessments for tourists; on the negative side they are susceptible to political influence and may not be as objective as one would hope; plus they paint the risk picture with broad strokes, so that relatively safe enclaves become included in the national summary. Glaesser (2003: 131-132) provides an example of how one crisis, the Bali bombing of 12 October 2002, produced various levels of advisory notice in Europe, ranging from a low level general security advice to warnings against travel under any circumstances.",

Increased liability insurance has put some single owner peripheral tourism operations out of business, regular security insurance as well as liability insurance has risen dramatically for resorts, and resort destinations in vulnerable locations are facing either dramatic increases in premiums or the loss of direct insurance. After a disastrous 2005, with insured losses of $55 billion in the US, of which $38 billion was caused by hurricane Katrina,American insurers 'are cutting back their exposure in coastal areas . . . home owners who can get insurance coverage face sharply higher rates. Some premiums have risen by as much as 200% . . . Many residents cannot get private coverage at all. As a result, state -backed insurance plans, meant to provide coverage as a last resort, are being inundated' (The Economist, 2006a: 74) . This is only the tip of the iceberg according to figures provided by Winn and Kirchgeorg (2005: 245) who quote Table 11 .3 from the Topics GEO 2003 report, which shows 'the number of natural catastrophes rose nearly five fold (and) economic losses nearly 16 fold over the last five decades'.",

They view past and present management interest in environmental management and sustainable development as an 'inside-out' approach, 'one in which the primary perspective is to look from the firm out at the external environment' (Winn and Kirchgeorg, 2005: 240) that includes ecological and social considerations. But given the dramatic external forces in nature, politics and health which are leading to new levels of uncertainty in the ecological and societal realms, they see the need for 'a radical departure from the inside-out perspective of environmental management and its more systems theory-informed cousin from sustainability management' to one where sustainability management should be 'expanded and complemented, and may even need to be substituted by conceptual frameworks fairly new to organization theories, such as \"resilience management\" or \"discontinuity management\"' (Winn and Kirchgeorg, 2005: 250) . This is because if we are facing significant shifts in environmental and political conditions, the balancing nature of sustainable development will no longer apply in an unstable world. Rather, business will need to take on board the possibility or probability of structural shifts and the prospect of facing several global emergencies during their lifetime. 'Since ecological global systems cannot be affected significantly by actors in the short-term (the inside-out approach), broader adaptive behaviors that secure the survivability of the economy and society become increasingly relevant. Crisis management, risk management, and emergency responses need to be supplemented with long term management for survival' (Winn and Kirchgeorg, 2005: 252) .",

Although financial risk has been a constant within business it is only in recent times, with the rise of a litigious society and a less stable natural environment, that it has become a more general and important issue for management. Its increased prominence in business and society now means resorts should make it a key feature of their strategic management, and possibly their central concern.",

The future can be extrapolated from the present if global business conditions change slowly and in a familiar manner, as predicted in the forecast for a growing senior's market for resorts. But what if we are experiencing major changes to the physical well-being of our planet and in human behaviour to one another? The risk factors that we have calculated from the past and present may no longer work so well or even apply, and we will need to enlarge our risk management process to incorporate more fluid business and environmental situations (Part D).",

What was missing was both an early warning system of seismic buoys and a way to convey that information to potentially threatened areas, so they could instigate evacuation plans. While the 'Pacific Tsunami Warning Centre in Hawaii had sent an alert to 26 countries, including Thailand and Indonesia, (it) struggled to reach the right people.Television and radio alerts were not issued in Thailand until 9 a.m. local time -nearly an hour after the waves had hit' (Global Security, 2006: 3) . In this case there had been no regional forecasting or risk analysis and there was no internationally coordinated contingency plan to deal with such a situation. The result was that even if a coastal resort had its own evacuation plan there was nothing to trigger it until the arrival of the first wave, and by then it was too late.",

But this is just the start, for the information needs to get to the areas around the Indian Ocean that are likely to be affected and the people in those areas who need to know what actions to take. Therefore, UNESCO is continuing to work on international coordination and with governments to provide grassroots preparedness (Terra Daily, 2006) . UNESCO is providing expertise to assist with the redevelopment of mangrove, sea grass and coral reef rehabilitation; it is strengthening disaster preparation for cultural and heritage sites and integrating this into its reconstruction processes; and it is teaching tsunami awareness in schools, training decision-makers and broadcasters and staging local practice drills.",

This will clearly require coordination at government levels and the will to maintain vigilance and training over long time periods between natural disaster events -something that will test human nature to the full. One also has to ask, if future tsunamis are associated with the rising sea levels of global warming will such improvements be enough?
