Four dengue serotypes, known as DENV-1, -2, -3, and -4, can cause severe and fatal disease. Dengue typically occurs in tropical and subtropical areas in the world and is transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes; Aedes aegypti is the principal vector worldwide (1) . DF and DHF are the most important arboviral diseases of humans; \u224850-100 million dengue infections and several hundred thousand cases of DHF occur annually (2) .",

First, differences in mosquito species, behavior, and ecology are critical to understanding why the Hawaii outbreak was less severe than that described in the Society Islands, where Ae. aegypti was the principal mosquito vector. Ae. aegypti females are highly anthropophilic and often feed on several persons before obtaining enough blood to complete a gonotrophic cycle. This tendency towards multiple feeding may contribute to the explosive nature of dengue outbreaks in areas where Ae. aegypti is present. Compared with Ae aegypti, Ae. albopictus is considered to be an inefficient epidemic dengue vector because it is less anthropophilic and not as well adapted to urban domestic environments (18) . Ae. albopictus will readily feed on humans, but usually only on a single person, and it also feeds on other animals, which decreases the probability of human contact (19, 20) . Lifestyle factors may also help explain why Hawaii's dengue outbreak was limited (21) . Residences in many affected areas often had dense, uncultivated vegetation near housing and, not infrequently, an abundance of items that could serve as suitable Aedes breeding sites: tires, buckets, and discarded vehicles. Furthermore, dwellings in these areas often lacked window screens and doors. The combination of ample mosquito breeding sites and relatively unrestricted access to residents in some sections of windward Oahu and Hana, Maui, probably enhanced opportunities for mosquito-human contact beyond levels that existed in Hawaii's major population centers.",

One possible explanation for the difference in illness severity observed between these locations is that the number of cases in Hawaii was too small to manifest the extremes of the clinical spectrum. A second explanation is that a history of dengue infection, i.e., antibody-dependent enhancement, may have been important in French Polynesia (22) . A third explanation is that the Hawaiian virus had changed genetically and became less virulent or lost its epidemic potential. This loss of epidemic potential occurred in the 1970s when both DENV-1 and DENV-2 were reintroduced into the Pacific after an absence of 25 years (23) . Despite close similarities in the envelope protein sequences of the 2001 Tahiti and Hawaii viruses, important differences may exist in other areas of the genome that could influence these properties. Recent studies in Sri Lanka and Puerto Rico suggest that the genetic changes associated with epidemic potential occur in the nonstructural virus genes and not the envelope gene commonly usually used to show genetic relatedness between dengue viruses (24, 25) . Full-length genomic sequencing of DENV-1 viruses is pending.",

            "text": "The Hawaii experience demonstrates the potential of Ae. albopictus, under suitable conditions, to transmit small outbreaks of dengue within the United States. During the last 15-20 years, this mosquito has expanded its geographic range within the United States and now is found in at least 24 states on the mainland (26, 27) . From 1986 to 2000, a total 516 laboratory-confirmed and 2,128 suspected dengue infections were imported into the United States (28) (29) (30) (31) (32) (33) . The true incidence of imported dengue infection is probably higher, since dengue may often go undiagnosed in areas where the virus is not endemic (4, 20, 23, 34, 35) . Given the high volume of travel between the US mainland and dengue-endemic areas of the world (an estimated 14 million passengers to and from the Caribbean, Central and South America, and Oceania in 2001), we recommend that health officials keep local clinicians informed of dengue activity in these regions and that clinicians consider the possibility of autochthonous transmission when evaluating febrile rash illnesses, particularly when local vector surveillance indicates high populations of Ae. aegypti or Ae. albopictus mosquitoes (36,37). This investigation has several limitations. First, despite extraordinary efforts to obtain specimens, \u224825% of all persons initially evaluated for dengue did not submit a convalescent-phase specimen (>5 days after illness onset) required for definitive case classification. During followup attempts to obtain convalescent-phase sera, we often learned that patients or their physicians had decided that dengue was unlikely and no further testing was necessary; however, some dengue infections may have been missed. Secondly, because persons acquire dengue from mosquitoes that feed during the daytime, infection might have occurred at a location other than where the patient lived. We mapped the distribution of residences, however, because this information is not subject to recall bias. Thirdly, when investigating newly reported cases, we did not routinely elicit the number of household members and obtain serum samples from them in a standardized manner. Therefore, we cannot calculate the proportion of close contacts who were infected.",
