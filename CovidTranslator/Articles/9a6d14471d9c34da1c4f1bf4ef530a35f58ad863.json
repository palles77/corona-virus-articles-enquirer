            "text": "CD200, a type I membrane glycoprotein, plays an important role in prevention of inflammatory disorders, graft rejection, autoimmune diseases and spontaneous fetal loss. It also regulates tumor immunity. A truncated CD200 (CD200 tr ) resulting from alternative splicing has been identified and characterized as a functional antagonist to full-length CD200. Thus, it is important to explore the mechanism(s) controlling alternative splicing of CD200. In this study, we identified an exonic splicing enhancer (ESE) located in exon 2, which is a putative binding site for a splicing regulatory protein SF2/ ASF. Deletion or mutation of the ESE site decreased expression of the full-length CD200. Direct binding of SF2/ASF to the ESE site was confirmed by RNA electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). Knockdown of expression of SF2/ASF resulted in the same splicing pattern as seen after deletion or mutation of the ESE, whereas overexpression of SF2/ASF increased expression of the full-length CD200. In vivo studies showed that viral infection reversed the alternative splicing pattern of CD200 with increased expression of SF2/ASF and the full-length CD200. Taken together, our data suggest for the first time that SF2/ASF regulates the function of CD200 by controlling CD200 alternative splicing, through direct binding to an ESE located in exon 2 of CD200.",

            "text": "Alternative splicing is a major mechanism for regulating biological systems, producing multiple messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein isoforms. Some of these isoforms have distinct or even opposing functions (19) . Many genes in the immune system have been found to be alternatively spliced (20) (21) (22) and a growing number of human diseases are associated with aberrant splicing of the genes (23) (24) (25) . However, few studies to date have identified the mechanisms that regulate alternative splicing in the immune system. While CD200 exists as a single copy gene, data from Borriello et al. (26) , confirmed by our experiments (27) , have reported that a splice variant of CD200 exists. Although exon 2 deletion of CD200 caused by alternative splicing results in a frame shift and premature translational termination, we noted the existence of a downstream ATG start codon in a perfect Kozak context (27) . When the first start codon is followed shortly by a terminator codon and creates a small open reading frame (ORF; 5 0 -mini-cistron), the 40S ribosomal subunit remains bound to the mRNA, resumes scanning, and potentially reinitiates at the next ATG codon downstream (28) . It is known that the NH2-terminal region of CD200 is important for its biological interaction with CD200Rs (29, 30) , and translation from the second ATG start codon would produce a truncated form of CD200 (CD200 tr ) lacking the NH2-terminal 43 amino acids which includes regions important for the interaction with CD200Rs. Indeed, our previous studies have shown that expressed CD200 tr is a functional antagonist to CD200 (27) .",

In the present study, we have explored the mechanism controlling CD200 alternative splicing and show that SF2/ASF regulates CD200 alternative splicing through its direct binding to an ESE site in exon 2 of this gene. The level of SF2/ASF determines the alternative splicing patterns in different tissues or cells. Interestingly, in a mouse model of viral infection, we detected for the first time that the normal splicing pattern of CD200 was reversed in the lung tissue of A/J mice infected with mouse hepatitis virus strain I (MHV-1), following an increase in expression of SF2/ASF in this MHV-1 susceptible mouse strain.",

As shown in Figure 5 , an RNA-protein complex was detected after the SF2/ASF recombinant protein with \u00c1RS domain was mixed with a radiolabeled RNA oligonucleotide containing the ESE site. This protein/RNA interaction is specific since SF2/ASF did not bind to a radiolabeled RNA oligonucleotide containing mutated ESE site and the above binding was eliminated by competing 100\u00c2 unlabelled oligonucleotide containing the same ESE ( Figure 5 ). Moreover, this binding was not competed by the same level of cold oligonucleotide with the ESE site mutated (data not shown). As previously described, the full-length CD200 was expressed predominantly in brain and neuronal cells. One explanation of this observation is that the expression of SF2/ASF is higher in neuronal cells and brain. To test this hypothesis, we assessed SF2/ASF levels in Daudi and SK-N cells by Western blotting. As shown in Figure 6A , the natural level of SF2/ASF was clearly higher in SK-N cells than in Daudi cells.",

Whether viral infection itself affects the expression of CD200 in host is an issue which remains to be explored. Intranasal infection of A/J mice with the coronavirus murine hepatitis virus strain 1 (MHV-1) has been described to induce pulmonary pathology with features reminiscent of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) (33) . To examine the correlation between the viral (MHV-1) infection and expression of CD200 in host we collected lung tissues from MHV-1 susceptible A/J mice and MHV-1-resistant C57BL/6J mice after infection. RT-PCR was performed using a sense primer located in exon 1 and an antisense primer present in exon 3. Interestingly, we observed a reversal of the normal CD200 splicing pattern in lung tissues of A/J mice postinfection ( Figure 7A ). Real-time RT-PCR provided a more accurate result of this phenomenon. We documented that the full-length CD200 was increased after viral infection and was 2-fold higher at 36 h postinfection compared with that before infection ( Figure 7B ). All the susceptible A/J mice were dead at 96 h postinfection. In contrast, the relative ratio of full-length to truncated CD200 did not change in infected C57BL/6J mice ( Figure 7C and D) . Thus, the pattern of alternative splicing of CD200 was correlated with susceptibility of these strains to viral infection.",

Increased expression of SF2/ASF was detected in lungs of A/J mice 12 h postinfection, whereas no increase of SF2/ASF in C57BL/6J mice even 36 h postinfection, suggesting that the role of virus on host CD200 expression is mediated by SF2/ASF.",

The relative expression of the two isoforms of CD200 is of interest, given our recent evidence that the truncated form (CD200 tr ) can antagonize the functional suppression induced by full-length CD200 (27) . Although Borriello et al. (26) reported no change in the alternative splicing pattern of murine CD200 in lymphoid tissue after stimulation by Con A or LPS in vivo, in our in vivo studies of mouse lung tissues before/after infection of MHV-1 virus we observed that, unlike in the natural condition, following viral infection the expression of total CD200 increased in lung of both MHV-1 susceptible A/J mice and MHV-1-resistant C57BL/6 mice. However, the splicing pattern of CD200 is reversed only in A/J mice, with the full-length transcript, capable of inducing immunosuppresion, becoming the predominant one. In contrast, for C57BL/6J, an MHV-1-resistant mouse strain, no change in the splicing pattern of CD200 was seen in the lung. This result importantly demonstrates that only the splicing pattern, but not the total transcription level, of CD200 determines the murine immune response to MHV-1 and is consistent with the hypothesis that the shift in the balance of expression of CD200/CD200 tr to decrease expression of the truncated product allowing CD200 to function in its immunosuppressive role, possibly contributing to the increased susceptibility to MHV-1 in the A/J mice. Further studies showed an increased expression of SF2/ ASF in A/J mice postinfection and the increase in SF2/ ASF occurred prior to increased full-length CD200, strongly suggesting that the regulation of alternative splicing of CD200 is mediated by SF2/ASF. It remains to be determined what viral proteins of MHV-1 have this effect and how the proteins regulate expression of SF2/ASF. Our studies suggest that viruses escape elimination by the host's immune system not only through producing viral proteins which mimic CD200 but also by inducing host CD200 expression and reducing expression of the antagonist CD200 tr . Posttranscriptional regulation, including mRNA stability, plays an important role for gene expression (42) . Whether the increase of full-length CD200 in A/J mice is also due to differential mRNA stability cannot be ruled out.",

This expression pattern is the reverse of that seen for endogenous CD200 expression in SK-N cells, in which the predominant expression is of full-length CD200. To exclude the possibility that the mutation created a new exonic splicing silencer (ESS) which led to decreased full-length, and increased truncated CD200, we deleted the ESE and examined the changes in CD200:CD200 tr .

Ubiquitously expressed splicing factors, among them is SF2/ASF, are thought to control tissue specific alternative splicing through their different expression levels in different tissues (44) . Our result showed that the natural level of SF2/ASF was higher in the neuronal cell line SK-N than in B cell line Daudi.

In contrast to its roles in transplantation, autoimmune diseases and inflammation, CD200 enhances the growth of malignant tumors and it has been suggested that a novel approach to anticancer therapy might include blockade of CD200 (15, 16, (46) (47) (48) (49) .
