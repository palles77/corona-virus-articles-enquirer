We limit the discussion here to RNA viruses that use RNA as their sole genetic material; therefore, these recombination events must happen at the RNA level, without utilizing a DNA intermediate. The following questions arise. Which RNA viruses undergo recombination and at what frequency? Is the ability to recombine a universal property of RNA viruses? What is the mechanism of RNA recombination, and how does it differ from the known mechanisms of DNA recombination? Is the biological purpose of RNA recombination, if there is one, discernible?",

Initially it appeared that homologous recombination might be limited to the picornaviruses, because several studies failed to find evidence for recombination in other viruses, including Sindbis virus, vesicular stomatitis virus, and RNA phage3. More recent studies, however, have firmly established a high frequency of recombination in mouse hepatitis virus, a coronavirus, both in tissue culture and in the animal host 4. The occurrence of RNA recombination has also been established in two positive-strand plant viruses, brome mosaic virus and cowpea chlorotic mottle virus5, 6. Several methods have been used to measure homologous RNA recombination; each of these methods has limitations, and all rely on the production of viable recombinant viruses. Recombination frequency is typically measured by a virus yield test. Ceils are coinfected under permissive conditions with two different parental viruses bearing genetic markers such as temperature sensitivity or drug resistance. The progeny viruses are then assayed under restrictive conditions to detect recombinants, and the recombination frequency is determined by dividing the yield of recombinants by the sum of the yields of the parental viruses. The sensitivity of this assay is limited by the typically high reversion rate of RNA viruses3; the recombination rate must be higher than the reversion rate to be detectable. The 'infectious center' test detects cells harboring recombinant molecules by plating cells from a mixed infection on confluent c~ll monolayers, followed by growth at the restrictive temperature.

There are no laboratory examples of homologous recombination among alphaviruses, negative-strand viruses or RNA phage, and yet each of these has been demonstrated to produce nonhomologous recombinants, as will be discussed below. Furthermore, the naturally isolated western equine encephalitis virus has recently been shown to be a recombinant alphavirus 7. The apparent lack of homologous recombinants in some viruses could be explained in several ways. First, it is conceivable that some RNA viruses simply do not undergo recombination at any significant frequency. It is also possible, however, that the prevalence of RNA recombination has been underestimated because complementation of parental viruses and the high reversion frequency (10-3 to 10 -4) of RNA viruses mask lowfrequency recombination events. Finally, even though recombinant molecules may be generated during replication they may not be viable, and therefore not detected by any of the laboratory methods discussed above.",

Furthermore, it may allow one to detect recombination between RNA viruses previously reported not to undergo genetic exchange. Is6 ]REVIEWS /-7/GIm Two alternative models for copychoice recombination are depicted (structures adapted from Refi 18). Both models begin with normal synthesis, with the nascent (black) strand positioned in the polymerization site and fully base paired with the donor (pink) template strand. Template switching could then occur via either (A) a nonprocessive (dispersive) mechanism involving dissociation of one or both RNA strands from the re'plicati~Sn complex, or (B) a processive mechanism in which the replication complex remains continuously associated with the RNA, ultimately resulting in synthesis on the acceptor template (red). Although the processive model may initially appear complex, it is kinetically more efficient than the nonprocessive model, and also invokes a lower-energy recombinational intermediate. Thus it is worth considering whether or not the dynamics of the polymerization process are likely to accommodate such a mechanism. From \"a mechanistic standpoint, E. coli DNA polymerase I Klenow fragment is arguably the best-understood polymerase and therefore provides a conceptual basis for understanding the capabilities common to all polymerases. The crystallographic studies of this DNA-dependent DNA polymerase as well as extensive kinetic studies ~8,39 have shown that in order for the 3'-5' exonuclease activity to excise a misincorporated base, the DNA must slide approximately eight nucleotides relative to the protein, and three or four nucleotides at the 3'-end of the nascent strand must unpair and be positioned in a",

It is these proteins that seem to show the highest propensity for template switching (see text). Thus we speculate that the absence of the exonuclease domain (with its single-stranded nucleic acid-binding groove) could in Pact promote efficient processive template switching.

Trans-splicing, yielding recombinant RNA molecules and mediated by a self-splicing yeast group II intron, has been observed in vitro 11. However, this reaction is highly sequence specific and thus is unlikely to provide a universal mechanism of RNA recombination. A protein-mediated strand scission and ligation mechanism similar to that found in DNA recombination systems would not need to be sequence specific. However, no such multienzyme pathway has yet been demonstrated to operate on RNA viruses. Strong genetic evidence has shown that recombination in poliovirus occurs via a copy-choice mechanism in which the viral RNA polymerase switches templates during negative strand synthesis s. Intertypic poliovirus recombinants show significantly elevated homology between the parental RNAs at the 3' side (of the positive sense strand) of the crossover sites, consistent with copy-choice recombination during negative strand synthesis, mediated by homology between the 3' end of the nascent negative strand and the plus strand template of the other parent RNA 9.

Template switching may occur by a nonprocessive mechanism such as that illustrated in Fig. 1A , via dissociation of the polymerase from the template but not from the nascent RNA strand, as suggested by Cascone et al. 14 for recombination between satellite RNAs of turnip crinkle virus. Another nonprocessive mechanism would involve complete dissociation of the polymerase from the RNA, as proposed by Makino et al. 17 for coronavirus recombination (not shown). Alternatively, one can envisage a processive mechanism in which the viral polymerase switches templates without dissociation (Fig. 1B) . We have based our ideas for this processive model on E. coli DNA polymerase I Klenow fragment, the only polymerase for which a three-dimensional structure is known TM. No direct evidence has yet been obtained to support or distinguish these models. In any case, more detailed knowledge of the in vivo structure of the replicative intermediate in each of these viruses, as well as the intrinsic properties of the viral replication apparatus, will be required to understand fully the intricacies of the copy-choice recombination strategy. The most commonly observed incidence of nonhomologous recombination is the production of. DI particles during high multiplicity viral passages. These deleted genomes probably arise by a template-switching mechanism during replication. Sequence analysis of the crossover sites for D1 genomes rules out a simple model in which deletions arise by synthesizing RNA across the base of a hairpin structure in the RNA template. This does not exclude the involvement of fortuitous base pairing in the formation of more complicated recombinational intermediates 15.",

The frequency of nonhomologous recombination has never been quantified, but is probably quite low.

Reverse transcriptases are DNA-or RNA-dependent DNA polymerases, and template-switching events have been invoked to explain three different aspects of retroviral replication and recombination. First, during every infectious cycle, the synthesis of both positive and negative strands of the DNA provims requires a transfer of the replication complex from one RNA template to another. This template switch is undoubtedly facilitated by the degradation of the first RNA template by RNase H as the proviral DNA jf synthesized, promoting base pairing with a second templateS~.5~. Second, Hu and Temin3: found that the generation of recombinant retroviral RNAs in a single replicative cycle was dependent on the presence of heterozygotic virions; a simple mixed infection of two parental viruses was not sufficient to generate recombinants. Thus, a virion core-associated event, probably reverse transcription, is responsible for generating recombinant retrovimses3V. A third example of possible templateswitching events is the transduction of cellular sequences by retroviruses. Although the mechanism of these nonhomologous recombination events remains the subject of some controversy, convincing evidence has been provided that at least some of these events occur by recombination, presumably replicative, between viral and cellular RNAs38 (also discussed by H. Temin in March T/G).",

Whereas in C3 plants only one photosynthetic cell type differentiates, photosynthetic reactions in C4 plants are split between two morphologically distinct cell types. In C3 plants, CO 2 is fixed into C3 acids through the ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase (RuBPCase)-mediated carboxylation of RuBP in the Calvin cycle. This carboxylation reaction is inhibited by 02, which competes with CO 2 at the active site of RuBPCase, in the energywasting process of photorespiration. C4 plants minimize photorespiration by concentrating levels of CO 2 at the active site of RuBPCase. This is achieved through the metabolic cooperation of neighl)ouring bundle sheath and mesophyll cells. CO2 is first fixed into C4 acids by an Oe-insensitive carboxylasc (ph{}sph{}en(}lpyruvate carboxylase, PEPCase) in the mes{)phyll ~ells and then transferred to the bundle sheath.
