Once p28 was cleaved there was little degradation of the protein over a 2-hr period. The intracellular cleavage of p28 was not inhibited by the protease inhibitor leupeptin, in contrast to results obtained during in vitro translation of genome RNA (Denison and Perlman, 1986). These data suggest that different protease activities may be responsible for the cleavage of p28 in vitro and in Go. The 290-kDa protein was an intermediate cleavage product derived from a precursor of greater than 400 kDa. The 290-kDa product was subsequently cleaved into secondary products of 50 and 240 kDa. The intracellular cleavage of the 290-kDa polypeptide was inhibited by leupeptin at concentrations which did not inhibit the early cleavage of p28 or the cleavage of the 290-kDa product from its larger polyprotein precursor. In the presence of zinc chloride, a product of >320 kDa was detected, which appears to incorporate p28 at its amino terminus. This suggests that at least two protease activities may be necessary for processing of ORFl a proteins, one of which cleaves p28 and is sensitive to zinc chloride but resistant to leupeptin, and the other which cleaves the 290-kDa precursor and is sensitive to both inhibitors. Both the 290-and 240-kDa proteins should contain sequences predicted to encode two papain-like prOtesS? activities.",

The replication strategy of MHV includes the transcription of a full-length negative-strand RNA from the input genome RNA, as well as the synthesis of subgenomic mRNAs. The subgenomic mRNAs form a 3' coterminal (nested) set of seven RNAs (including genome length RNA) which extend varying distances in the 5' direction. It is thought that only the 5' most gene of each RNA is translated into protein. Gene 1 of MHV-JHM, a virus strain closely related to MHV A59, has been sequenced and found to be 2 1,798 nt in length (Lee eta/., 1991) . It contains two open reading frames, ORF 1 a and ORF 1 b, which overlap by 75 nt, with ORF 1 b in the -1 frame with respect to ORF la. A signal sequence present in this overlap region and a downstream pseudoknot formation can direct the ribosome to shift from the ORFl a to the ORFl b coding frame (Breedenbeek et a/., 1990; Lee et al., 1991) . Thus, gene 1 could potentially be translated into a polyprotein of >750 kDa.",

MHV, like other positivestrand RNA viruses, does not contain a polymerase activity within the virion and must translate it from the input genome RNA. It is postulated, also by analogy to other positive-strand RNA viruses, that gene 1 is translated soon after infection into proteins containing various activities necessary for transcription and replication. Consistent with this model, in vitro translation of genome RNA results in only gene 1 products being detected (Leibowitz eta/., 1982; Denison and Perlman, 1986) . Further, gene I of the murine coronaviruses A59 and JHM, as well as of the avian coronavirus, IBV, has been shown to contain sequence motifs predicting polymerase, helicase and nucleotide triphosphate binding activities (Boursnell eta/., 1987; Gorbalenya eT a/., 1989; Breedenbeek et a/., 1990; Lee et al., 1991) .",

P250 is detected only in the presence of protease inhibitors (Leibowitzetal., 1982; Denison and Perlman, 1986) . Cleavage of ~28, the extreme N-terminal ORF la product, is a delayed event in vitro, requiring a precursor of at least 160 kDa to be translated before cleavage occurs (Denison and Perlman, 1986; Soe et al., 1987; Baker et a/., 1989) . The cleavage of p28 in vitro may be autoproteolytic, effected by a protease activity encoded in the first 3.9-5.3 kb of ORF 1 a (Baker et al., 1989) . More recent analyses indicates that this portion of MHV-JHM ORF la contains two distinct regions, predicted to encode papain-like proteases, and it has been suggested that one of these regions may be important in p28 cleavage (Baker et al., 1989; Lee et al., 1991) .",

We have used antisera against proteins encoded in ORF 1 a to detect putative polymerase gene products. In this report we describe the intracellular synthesis and processing of p28 and other ORF la polypeptides in MHV-infected cells. We have characterized the kinetics of synthesis of these products, their precursor-product relationships and the sensitivities of the cleavage reactions to protease inhibitors. Our results suggest that the intracellular ORF 1 a products may be substantially different from those identified from in vitro translation of genome RNA, and that more than one protease activity may be necessary for the processing of ORF 1 a translation products.",

The hybridoma cell line, 1.16.1, secreting antibodies against N (nucleocapsid) was used as previously described (Denison et a/., 1991) .

No potential precursors to p28 were detected, with all larger bands being nonspecific products also precipitated by preimmune serum from infected and uninfected DBT cells. Neither antiserum 81043 nor 600A detected ~28. This was expected since they were directed against sequences encoded downstream of p28 (Table 1 , see also Fig. 6) , and indicated that none of the downstream ORF la products was a p28 containing precursor. This was in contrast to the results from in vitro translation of A59 genome RNA, in which p28-containing precursors from 160 to 250 kDa were easily detected by ap28p (Denison et al., 1991) .

A59-infected cells were labeled with [35S]met for 20 min and then chased with excess cold methionine for O-l 20 min, lysed, and immunoprecipitated with antisera (~p28p, 81043, or 600A (Fig. 3) . As in Figs. 1 and 2 , ap28p precipitated only p28 with no detectable precursors. The amount of p28 detected remained constant up to 120 min of chase, with no evidence of processing or degradation. All three antisera detected a band migrating at 278 kDa, just below the 290-kDa virus-specific ORF la product (Fig. 3, 15 min, 600A) . This was a nonspecifically precipitated cellular polypeptide, detected in infected and mock-infected cells by all antisera including preimmune serum (see also Fig. 1) . At the end of the 15-min labeling period (0 min lane), a majority of the labeled products precipitated by both 81043 and 600A were in the heterogeneous band of greater than 400 kDa. The 290-kDa band was first detected by both antisera at 15 min of chase. Subsequently, the 240-and 50-kDa products were first detected at 30 min of chase. Antiserum 600A detected the 290-and 240-kDa products, but not the 50-kDa product, consistent with the results in Figs. 1 and 2 . The sizes of these products, as well as the late, simultaneous appearance of the 240-and 50-kDa products, suggested that they were derived from the 290-kDa polypeptide by a delayed cleavage reaction (50-90 min), with p50 as the amino terminal product and ~240 as the carboxy terminal. The 168-, 125-, and lOO-kDa polypeptides detected by 81043 appeared simultaneously at O-l 5 min, suggesting that they were products of premature translation, which were not processed.",

Leupeptin, a low molecular weight (455 Da) reversible inhibitor of trypsin-like serine proteases, as well as some cysteine proteases, effectively blocks the proteolytic cleavage of p28 during in vitro translation of A59 genome RNA at concentrations of l-2 mM (Denison and Perlman, 1986) . Leupeptin has been shown to penetrate intact cells (Appleyard and Tisdale, 1985) . MHVA59-infected DBT cells were labeled in media containing 2 mM leupeptin followed by immunoprecipitation with preimmune serum, c~p28p, 81043, or 600A. The cleavage of p28 in viva was not inhibited by the presence of up to 2 mM leupeptin in the media. These results differed substantially from those obtained in the cell-free rabbit reticulocyte lysate, in which the cleavage of p28 from its precursors was almost completely inhibited by 2 mM leupeptin (Denison and Perlman, 1986; Denison et al., 1991) , resulting in increased detection of p28-containing precursors, specifically ~250. In contrast, the 240and 50-kDa bands precipitated by 81043 in the absence of leupeptin were not detected when ORF la products were labeled in the presence of leupeptin. An identical pattern was observed in the products precipi-tated by 600A, with the exception that the 50-kDa product was not detected by this antibody under any circumstances. In addition, the 290-kDa band was significantly more dense in the presence of leupeptin as detected by both antibodies, as would be expected if its cleavage into products of 240 and 50 kDa were prevented. Finally, the 168-, 125-, and 1 00-kDa products were not altered in electrophoretic mobility nor relative amount detected by the addition of leupeptin to the cells, supporting the conclusion that these were minor products derived from premature termination of translation rather than post-translational cleavage. Since the cleavages of p28 and the 290-kDa product were not detectably inhibited by leupeptin, the experiment was repeated, instead using E64 (Sigma), a specific, irreversible cysteine protease inhibitor, and also using ZnCI,, which completely inhibits p28 cleavage in vitro at 1 mM concentrations (Denison and Perlman, 1986; Denison and Perlman, 1987) . E64 had no detectable effect on the proteolytic processing of any of the identified ORF la products (data not shown), even though it is a small MW inhibitor and has been shown to be able to penetrate cells (Gordon and Seglen, 1989) . It is not clear whether this lack of inhibition was the result of insensitivity of the protease activities to E64 or was due to insufficient intracellular concentrations. Zinc chloride had a very low working concentration range in the media, with 0.05 mM producing no inhibition of cleavages of the ORF 1 a products and 0.2 mM causing visible toxicity to the cell monolayer and almost complete inhibition of translation of MHV polypeptides. At a ZnCI, media concentration of 0.1 mM, there was a decrease in detectable ~28, as well as the appearance of a new band of >320 kDa (Fig. 5B) . A polypeptide of identical mobility was also detected by antisera 81043 and 600A in the presence of 0.1 m&I ZnCI,, the only band which was detected by all three antisera, suggesting that ZnCI, to a limited extent inhibited the cleavage of p28 from the growing polyprotein precursor, resulting in a product which contained epitopes recognized by each of the three antisera.",

These data suggest a model in which small amount of ORF la gene products are translated from input genome RNA until 1.5-3 hr pi, when copies of genome RNA begin to be transcribed and become available as templates for translation of ORF 1 a products, allowing much greater quantities to be produced. This model is supported by the fact that nucleocapsid protein, the product of subgenomic mRNA 7, demonstrated similar kinetics of appearance. A model of translation of ORF 1 a products from progeny genome RNA is also supported by studies which have demonstrated that continuous cfe nova protein synthesis is necessary for efficient RNA synthesis during virus replication (Sawicki and Sawicki, 1986; Perlman et al., 1987) . It is also possible that the increased detection late in infection of all ORF 1 a products may have been partially the result of intracellular accumulation, since it was demonstrated that all of the polypeptides were stable for at least 2 hr. The terminal diminution in amounts detected probably resulted from loss of cell numbers and viability late in infection, since at that time 100% of cells were involved in syncytia and were beginning to be lost from the plate.",

            "text": "Data from in vitro translation of MHV-JHM ORF la transcripts indicate that p28 is cleaved in vitro by a cis-autoproteolytic mechanism (Baker et a/., 1989) . We were unable to analyze the initial cleavage events in infected cells, since at earliest times pi the quantity of ORF 1 a products present was below the level of detection by the available antisera. It is therefore quite possible that the cleavage of p28 in A59-infected cells at very early times pi may occur by an autoproteolytic mechanism similar to that described during in vitro translation. However, the data presented here indicate that intracellular processing of p28 at late times pi may be effected by an additional or alternative mechanism. We detected no p28containing products of 140 to 180 kDa, in viva, which would be necessary to span the predicted papain-like protease regions (Lee et a/., 1991) . The antiserum crp28p detected only p28 under all conditions of labeling and immunoprecipitation utilized, supporting the conclusion that early, rapid cleavage of p28 was the predominant method of genesis late in infection. In contrast, the processing of p28 from larger N-terminal precursors is easily detected in the rabbit reticulocyte cell-free translation system, in which p28 is clearly not cleaved in vitro until at least 160 kDa of protein has been synthesized (Denison and Perlman, 1986; Soe et a/., 1987; Baker et al., 1989) . We were able to detect in vitro all p28containing precursors up to 250 kDa utilizing cup28p and thus do not believe that epitope masking could account for the lack of p28 containing-precursors in vivo in our experiments.",

During the in vitro translation of A59 genome RNA, the cleavage of p28 is sensitive to inhibition by leupeptin, with essentially complete inhibition of proteolysis occurring at 2-mM concentrations. In contrast, the cleavage of p28 in infected cells was unaffected by leupeptin, even though leupeptin was clearly able to penetrate cells and inhibit the cleavage of other ORF 1 a precursor polypeptides. Both of the predicted papain protease activities, as well as a predicted 3C-like protease in ORF 1 a of JHM, are postulated to be cysteine proteases, which should be inhibited by leupeptin or E64. There is not yet enough data to determine whether this rapid cleavage of p28 resulted from intramolecular self-cleavage of ~28, such as that described in several of the nonstructural proteins of the picornaviruses (Krausslich and Wimmer, 1988; Palmenburg, 1990 ) from one of the described ORF 1 a cis-protease activities (Baker et a/., 1989) which may be acting in Vans within the infected cell, or from an as yet unrecognized viral or cellular transacting protease.",

The first event was the cleavage of p28 from the growing polypeptide chain. Translation on the genome RNA template continued with the synthesis of a variety of products greater than 400 kDa in size. It is not clear whether these large precursors terminated at the end of ORF 1 a or were composed of ORF 1 a-lb fusion polypeptides. It is possible that both were present, based on the demonstrated efficiency of ribosomal frameshifting in the coronaviruses (Brierley et a/., 1987; Breedenbeek et a/., 1990; Lee et a/., 1991) . The probability that ORFl a-l b fusion protein precursors are synthesized is also supported by the fact that up to 60 min of labeling was required for discrete ORFl a products other than p28 to be detected, which was ample time for translation of almost the entirety of ORFl a and ORFl b. The polyprotein was cleaved at 45-60 min into a primary product of 290 kDa. This primary cleavage product was subsequently proteolyzed into secondary products of 50 and 240 kDa.",

Analysis of the JHM ORF la sequence does not predict any regions with similarity to the conserved alphavirus cleavage sites [G, (A, C, G), (A, G, Y)] which could account for the ORF 1 a products identified. However, there are several regions of the ORF 1 a sequence with similarity to known picornavirus 3C protease substrate sites. One of these sites, the lys-arg (KR) at aa 3160-3161, was previously described as a potential cleavage site for the putative 3C-like protease activity in ORF 1 a (Lee et a/., 1991) . A polypeptide extending from the predicted C terminus of p28 to the KR dipeptide at 3160 would have a mass of approximately 323 kDa. This is substantially larger than the 290-kDa polypeptide actually precipitated by antisera 81,043 and 600A and suggests that either p290 is cleaved at a more 5' cleavage site or that an additional cleavage product exists between p28 and ~50, which cannot be detected by the antisera utilized (Fig. 6 ). This latter possibility is supported by the fact that for p50 to be detected by 8 1043, its carboxy terminus would have to extend beyond aa889, thus leaving a gap of approximately 30-60 kDa between the C terminus of p28 and the N terminus of ~50. We speculate that a product of this size may be the first product cleaved from the polyprotein chain of greater than 400 kDa, after the cleavage of p28 but prior to the cleavage of p290.",

The cleavage of p290 from a precursor polyprotein was a delayed event even at late times of infection, suggesting that it may have occurred by an intramolecular or cis proteolytic activity. It is reasonable to postulate that cis proteolysis by the predicted 3C-like protease may have been responsible for the cleavage into p290, since it resides between aa and 3652 of ORF 1 a, and since greater than 400 kDa of polypeptide was translated before the cleavage occurs in the infected cell. The same reasoning applies to the late cleavage of p290 into p50 and ~240, with the exception that this cleavage was quite susceptible to inhibition by leupeptin, suggesting that either an entirely different protease may have been responsible for this delayed cleavage, or that a conformational change may have been necessary before cleavage could occur.",
