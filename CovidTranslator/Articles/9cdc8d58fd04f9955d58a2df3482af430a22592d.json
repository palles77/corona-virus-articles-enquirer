It is a part of modern medical practice and respect for patient autonomy to show respect for different values. We give an account of what it means to respect different values and challenging patients in medical practice. Challenging choices are often choices which are perceived by many to be either irrational or against a person's interests, such as engaging in harmful or excessively risky activities. When the medical profession is involved in such choices, the basic medical principle of acting in a person's best interests is challenged. Often doctors refuse to respect controversial choices on paternalistic grounds. We should all respect and facilitate the controversial choices of competent individuals, subject to resource limitations, our own and others well-being and autonomy, and the public interest. But more importantly, sometimes such choices make for a better, more autonomous life. Sometimes, such choices reflect considerations of global well-being or altruism, or idiosyncratic attitudes to risk. Sometimes, they reflect unusual values. However, in some other cases, controversial choices are irrational and are not expressions of our autonomy. Doctors should assist patients to make rational if individual choices. The patient also bears the responsibility for bringing his beliefs to the attention of the clinician.",

This chapter deals with different challenges which may be in addition to those or in isolation and which arise from other demands made upon the anaesthetist or intensivist as a result of religious or other firmly held beliefs, or other pressures which impact on the clinician. These other stresses could affect the normal clinical practice of that clinician, the care provided or the attitude to that care. Some of these pressures are avoidable; some are present but may be unrecognised. This chapter will attempt to highlight some of these pressures and how they can be understood, approached and managed both ethically and clinically.",

The patients had received psychiatric and psychological treatment prior to the operation, but had failed to respond to these methods. Both operations were carried out privately and not publicly funded, and the patients were satisfied with the results. The NHS Trust responsible for the hospital banned further amputations. 2 Case Example 2. Requests for ''Futile'' Medical Treatment Mr Leslie Burke was 45 years old. 3 He had been diagnosed in 1982 with cerebellar ataxia, a degenerative brain disease. 4 He was wheelchair-bound and his speech was affected 4 , though his mental capacity was intact. 4 Due to the progressive nature of Mr Burke's disease, he would require artificial nutrition and hydration at some point. He sought a court ruling that such treatment be provided if he became incompetent. Mr Burke sought a declaration that the rights enunciated in Articles 2,3,8 and 14 of the European Convention on Human Rights pursuant to the Human Rights Act 1998 (UK) were breached by the General Medical Council's guidance entitled, 'Withholding and Withdrawing Life-Prolonging Treatments: Good Practice in Decision-Making '. 5 Justice Munby ruled in favour of Mr Burke, 6 and declared that parts of the Guidance were unlawful, as a competent person pursuant to Articles 3 7 and 8, is able to demand artificial nutrition and hydration in accordance with the rights of dignity and autonomy which enable a person to die in a manner in accordance with their desires. 8 However, the decision was appealed. 9 The Court of Appeal ruled that Justice Munby erred in law. The Court of Appeal found that the Guidance was lawful and that it did not contravene Articles 2,3 or 8 of the Convention and set aside the six declarations 10 made by Munby.",

            "text": "Patients may challenge their doctors in 5 ways: The importance of consent in law derives from the ethical importance of respecting people's autonomy in liberal democracies. 11 The word, ''autonomy'', comes from the Greek: autos (self) and nomos (rule or law). 12 Respect for autonomy captures the value that people should be the authors of their own lives, free to construct their own conception of the good life and act upon it. Importantly, being autonomous does not merely involving being competent and making a choice e it involves constructing a concept of how one's life should go according to a coherent set of values. Some choices frustrate or undermine our deepest values and autonomy. Thus, even though legally patients can refuse treatment on any grounds, however irrational, there are compelling ethical arguments to suggest that the exercise of full autonomy requires some element of rationality in addition to those elements of information and understanding identified by the courts. 13,14 These arguments are based on the concept of self-determination. The idea of self-determination is not mere choice but an evaluative choice of which of the available courses of actions is better or best. The reason that information is important is to enable an understanding of the true nature of the actions in question and their consequences; but if information is important, so too is a degree of at least rationality to draw correct inferences from these facts and to fully appreciate the options on offer. 14 In upholding maximally autonomous choices, we should therefore distinguish between two kinds of true imprudence:",

There are a number of explanations for this prohibition, the most popular and widely accepted being that this accords with the biblical injunction to refrain from the consumption of blood. 34 Current interpretation also adds that the Jehovah's Witnesses believe that the individual's life is represented by their blood whose consumption would be abhorrent.

Conversely, situations might arise, particularly in an environment with strict financial or resource limitations, when the extra burden of the challenge cannot be accepted. At all times awareness of the rights of the patient by the clinician and vice versa should lead to open and helpful dialogue in order that a mutually acceptable treatment plan can be reached.",
