The cell culture-derived subunit influenza vaccine (OPTAFLU \u00ae , Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics) is produced using Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells to propagate seasonal viral strains, as an alternative to embryonated chicken-eggs. As only a limited range of mammalian viruses can grow in MDCK cells, similar to embryonated eggs, MDCK cells can act as an effective filter for a wide range of adventitious agents that might be introduced during vaccine production. However, the introduction of an alternative cell substrate (for example, MDCK cells) into a vaccine manufacturing process requires thorough investigations to assess the potential for adventitious agent risk in the final product, in the unlikely event that contamination should occur.",

Other potential sources of contamination include raw materials, laboratory/process personnel and other external sources. Any biological process carries an adventitious agent risk and, although incidental introduction of adventitious agents could occur during conventional egg-based production of inactivated influenza vaccines, these vaccines have a well-established safety profile [13] .

This process-specific assessment considers all elements of the manufacturing process, and utilises polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based virus exclusion tests, clearance capability and viral inactivation potential of the vaccine manufacturing process. The assessment starts at the earliest relevant step: the isolation of an influenza virus strain from a human throat sample. It also considers egg passages to isolate influenza virus, MDCK cell passages to prepare viral seeds and PCR detection limits for tested materials, and extends through the entire manufacturing process, including fermentation, purification and blending of the final trivalent vaccine. The risk-assessment model can be applied to a range of potential contaminants and allows an estimation of maximum human infectious doses per vaccine dose to be made. A worst-case scenario is applied to every step of the manufacturing process in order to adequately cover variables such as potential virus titres, virus passage numbers, dilutions or inactivation results that might occur between different virus types of the same virus family.",

During generation of the MDCK 33016 viral seed, a minimum of three passages was assumed, each one using a minimum virus dilution of 1:100. Again, where MDCK 33016 cells cannot support growth of such viruses, this would result in a virus titre reduction of 6 log 10 infectious units/ml of any virus present in the cell culture. However, as stable human agents unable to grow in MDCK 33016 cells may contaminate seed virus passages during open steps carried out by human operators, it was necessary to assume and calculate the possibility of intermittent contamination during these operations. We assumed a contamination of 10 8 infectious units/ml via aerosols or contaminated equipment, of which a total volume of 10 l infects the smallest culture volume used (100 ml). This results in a final virus content of 4 log 10 infectious units/ml culture fluid where, in a worst-case scenario, the virus titre could remain stable without reduction by degradation or by further passage dilutions, particularly if the contamination occurred during the last culture step. This residual virus titre of 4 log 10 infectious units/ml was also assumed for all human viruses and for agents for which no specific data were available but where growth in MDCK 33016 cells would be highly unlikely. For viruses that can grow in MDCK 33016 cells, specific titres that were measured during viral growth studies described previously (and carried out under identical conditions as those applied for MDCK 33016 culture passages with influenza virus) were used (Section 2.2.1).",

Extensive testing of a wide range of viruses has been performed to determine their ability to grow in MDCK cells, and to ascertain their relevance as a potential risk from the perspective of an inactivated MDCK cell culture-derived influenza vaccine (Table 2) . These studies have demonstrated the ability of MDCK 33016 cells to support the growth of a limited number of human viruses; HSV, parainfluenza 3 and mammalian reovirus 3 can grow efficiently in MDCK 33016 cells, in agreement with published data on MDCK cells [16] [17] [18] . HSV and parainfluenza 3 grew to high titres of up to 8 log 10 infectious units/ml, whereas reovirus 3 grew slowly and [19] and the proliferation of well-adapted measles virus strains, albeit with slow growth, has also been reported [20, 21] . There are conflicting reports in the published literature concerning the ability of RSV to grow in MDCK cells. Whereas earlier studies have reported increased RSV titres after inoculation in MDCK cells [22, 23] , others have reported that MDCK cells showed a high degree of resistance to RSV [24] . When evaluating different cell substrates for the isolation of RSV from clinical specimens, only two RSV positive isolates were found in MDCK cells, compared with at least 12, or up to 30, positive isolates in other cell substrates [24] . Our own virus growth studies, monitoring growth of cell culture-adapted RSV-A and RSV-B strains under serum-free conditions in MDCK 33016 suspension cells, did not reveal any evidence of virus growth, and virus titres persistently dropped to below detection limits within 3-5 days. Thus, if possible at all, growth of RSV in MDCK cells seems to be restricted to certain strains and yields only moderate virus titres, especially if MDCK cell cultures are co-infected with influenza virus [23] . MDCK 33016 cells do not support the growth of most avian viruses but may allow replication of avian reovirus to a limited degree. Published studies report an inability of MDCK cells to support avian reovirus propagation [25, 26] ; however our own replication studies demonstrated minor avian reovirus titre increases after inoculation of MDCK 33016 cells with high titres of avian reovirus. Thus, minor and restricted growth was assumed, although the observed titre increase after inoculation of the test cultures could also be due to the dissociation of viral aggregates.",

A further reduction of \u22655.8 log 10 infectious units/ml was assumed to occur during the splitting of the viral envelope, based on data derived from studies on the enveloped viruses HSV and MuLV.

As parainfluenza virus can grow in eggs, a maximum residual titre of 8.0 log 10 infectious units/ml was assumed to be present in the egg-derived inoculum used to inoculate MDCK cells. In our own virus growth studies, parainfluenza 3 has been shown to replicate quickly and to high titres in MDCK cells, with maximum residual titre of 7.9 log 10 infectious units/ml observed after 3 days in culture, using cell cultureadapted parainfluenza 3 strains. This value was taken as the maximum residual titre that could theoretically be present in the MDCK seed virus. PCR testing of the working viral seed is routinely carried out and so the theoretical maximum parainfluenza titre that could remain would correspond to the PCR detection limit of the parainfluenza PCR assay, which is 3 log 10 infectious units/ml. This value may be increased by process concentration to a maximum of 3.7 log 10 , but is significantly reduced by BPL inactivation, detergent treatment, and subunit purification. Complete inactivation of two parainfluenza strains by BPL has been demonstrated during our own inactivation studies, where a reduction \u22659.5 log 10 infectious units/ml was measured. Based on data derived from studies using the enveloped viruses HSV and MuLV, a \u22655.8 log 10 reduction in parainfluenza titres was assumed to occur during the splitting and subunit purification stages of the manufacturing process. It is highly likely that this value underestimates the real capacity of the purification stages to remove parainfluenza virus.

Including subsequent manufacturing steps, a theoretical maximum titre of \u221211.9 log 10 infectious units/ml could remain in the cell culturederived vaccine, should a parainfluenza contamination event occur.

The virus is widespread in nature and after primary infection is likely to remain latent in immunocompetent subjects, but is potentially pathogenic in immunocompromised individuals. BK polyomavirus serves as a good model for assessing viral safety, as it is a particularly stable virus that is extremely difficult to inactivate or remove from contaminated material. No data are available on the permissiveness of embryonated eggs for BK polyomavirus and so a maximum of 6 log 10 infectious units/ml was assumed. BK polyomavirus did not grow in MDCK 33016 cells in our experiments, but intermittent contamination was assumed to occur during the final-stage passage in MDCK 33016 cell culture, resulting in a titre of 4 log 10 infectious units/ml (see Section 2.3.3). The PCR detection limit for BK polyomavirus is \u22642 log 10 infectious units/ml; therefore, the maximum amount of BK polyomavirus that could theoretically remain in the MDCK influenza seed virus is 2 log 10 infectious units/ml. In line with other double-stranded genome viruses, for example herpes, reovirus or birnavirus, BK polyomavirus is very resistant to chemical inactivation. Accordingly, BPL caused a relatively small reduction of 2.05 log 10 steps. Assumptions regarding the removal of BK polyomavirus during the subunit purification stages of the manufacturing process were based on data derived from our own virus-spiking studies carried out on SV40 where a virus titre reduction by 4.8 log 10 was observed.

Although avian reovirus would not be present in the original clinical isolate, a maximum titre of 8 log 10 infectious units/ml was assumed in the egg isolate, as this virus could be present in the embryonated eggs used for influenza viral strain isolation. Previous studies have not demonstrated growth of avian reovirus in MDCK cells [27] , but our own studies have shown titre increases in avian reovirus when inoculated at high titres into trypsin-containing MDCK 33016 cell cultures (5.2 log 10 infectious units/ml rising to 6.75 log 10 infectious units/ml). Although it is unclear whether the titre increases are due to virus growth or are a result of dissociated virus aggregates, a viral titre of 6.8 log 10 infectious units was assumed for repeated seed virus passages in MDCK cells. For the bioreactor harvest, the maximum titre increase as observed for a high virus titre inoculum after 3 days in culture was taken as the resulting end value. No titre reduction due to PCR testing for avian reovirus was calculated. Our own inactivation studies demonstrated a 6.4 log 10 infectious units/ml reduction in avian reovirus (U/Conn 1133 prototype strain) titres following treatment with BPL. Complete inactivation was also achieved with another field isolate of an avian reovirus. This was a much greater inactivation than that seen with BPL treatment of mammalian reovirus 3. Virus reduction by the subunit purification process of \u22657.6 log 10 infectious units/ml as measured for reovirus 3 was also applied to avian reovirus and so a maximum of \u22127.4 log 10 infectious units/ml could theoretically be present at the end of the purification processes. This translates into a worst-case scenario of \u22127.7 log 10 infectious units/ml being present in the final trivalent vaccine or \u22129.7 log 10 human infectious doses per final trivalent vaccine dose, although avian reovirus is not known to infect humans.",

Data derived from replication studies confirm that MDCK 33016 cells support the growth of only a limited range of viruses (in this context the relevant viruses are influenza virus, parainfluenza virus, reovirus, and herpes simplex virus), similar to those viruses that can grow in eggs. Therefore, like embryonated eggs used in current influenza vaccine manufacture, MDCK 33016 cells can act as an effective viral filter for a wide range of adventitious agents. Moreover, MDCK 33016 cells do not support the replication of many avian viruses. This is of particular relevance if an avian virus contaminant is introduced into the process by passaging the vaccine virus strain in eggs. Therefore, using MDCK cells for virus propagation can lower the product-and process-failure risk. Conversely, for those viral agents that have the ability to grow well in MDCK 33016 cells, namely parainfluenza virus, HSV and reovirus, further consideration is needed.",

Virological differences will also impact on the assessment outcome; SV40 is commonly used as a model virus for other polyomaviruses but in our studies the BPL inactivation rate of SV40 exceeded that measured for both BK polyomavirus and avian polyomavirus by 1.0-1.4 log 10 steps.

In the best case, these calculations and the underlying studies may be used as convincing evidence that no action is needed because the process is able to remove and inactivate the contaminant. This can be of critical relevance for influenza vaccines where a seed virus strain cannot be readily exchanged by another strain, and when timeconsuming measures to remove adventitious agents may no longer be possible if a contamination is detected late during the annual vaccine-manufacturing period. Modelling the whole process may also help to identify where virus exclusion tests are needed, for example, for those viruses that grow to high titres and cannot be adequately removed or inactivated. Moreover, virus titres calculated for each relevant step of the entire process can also indicate where such exclusion tests are useful and where they are not. For example, from Table 3 it can be seen that an exclusion test for adenovirus would not be appropriate for the modelled process if it were to be conducted at the bioreactor harvest stage, or further downstream, because the expected worst-case viral titre would be below the method's detection limit. Conversely, the calculations show that testing for reoviruses may be useful to identify any contaminating reovirus, although the comfortably high safety margins of the risk assessment indicate that such measures are not absolutely necessary. The calculations presented here validate the capacity of the cell culture-derived influenza vaccine manufacturing process to remove and/or inactivate any type of potential contaminant, and it can be concluded that the risk of exposure to adventitious agents in vaccines produced in MDCK 33016 cells, using the specific manufacturing processes, is negligible.",
