In addition, the in-hospital management of patients with empyema is associated with substantial economic costs. 2 In the 2000s, the incidence rate of empyema in children increased worldwide as in France without clear explanations. 1,3-6 This trend was not modified by 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV-7) programs, 1,3-7 but hospitalizations for uncomplicated pneumonia clearly declined thereafter. 8 Previous retrospective studies suggested that the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) during community-acquired pneumonia may be associated with an increased risk of empyema, 3,9-13 but a protopathic bias could not be excluded. This case-control study was undertaken to investigate children's risk factors for empyema after acute viral infection and determine whether some viruses, 14, 15 use of NSAIDs, or both were associated.",

When cultures were negative, pneumococcal and universal bacterial PCRs were performed. DNA was extracted from 100 mL of pleural fluid samples previously stored at \u00c080 C with the automated MagNA Pure LC System (Roche Diagnostics, Meylan, France) and eluted in 100 mL of elution buffer using the DNA III Magna Pure DNA Isolation Kit (Roche Diagnostics).

Pneumococcal strains of known serotypes from the Statens Serum Institute and from French NRCP were used as internal controls. When available, DNA from individual pleural fluid samples with positive pneumolysin PCRs also were sent to the NRCP for serotyping with conventional multiplex PCR.

Conditional logistic regression was used to compare cases and matched controls for general characteristics. All variables achieving P # .20 were included in the multivariable analysis. Estimated matched ORs for proposed exposure definitions used the same P-value threshold. The final model was determined via a manual backwardselection procedure. When appropriate, interactions between variables were tested. More specifically, we used subgroup modeling to thoroughly investigate interactions between final significant variables. When the conditional logistic model did not converge, unpaired classical logistic regression was used. In that case, compared with conditional logistic model, greater significance might be observed.

NSAIDs previously have been a suspected risk factor for severe bacterial infections. The biological mechanisms of how NSAID can influence the pathogenesis of bacterial infections remain controversial. Based on the ability of NSAIDS to modify the host's inflammatory pathway and innate immune response, a direct role for NSAIDs in development of severe group A streptococcal infection was proposed by Stevens in 1995. 24 This hypothesis was based on the ability of NSAIDS to induce increased production of cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor, interleukin 1, and interleukin 6.",

[25] [26] [27] [28] [29] Finally, it was observed that low concentrations of ibuprofen, such as those obtained during antipyretic use, may have a proinflammatory action that promotes the recruitment and influx of neutrophils. 30 The use of NSAIDs also reflects delayed effective treatment, because NSAIDs might mask the onset of bacterial disease by decreasing the inflammatory response to infection. Associations between bacterial infections and NSAIDs were reported for necrotizing fasciitis during primary varicella 31, 32 or for invasive group A streptococcal infection. 33 The occurrence of new symptoms or complications were slightly more frequent in children receiving ibuprofen than in those advised to take acetaminophen during respiratory tract infections. 34 Empyema was thought to be associated with outpatient use of NSAIDs in children and adults 3, [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] ; however, NSAIDs could not be causally implicated. These analysis were hampered by protopathic bias, 35 ie, the possibility of more frequent use of NSAIDs because patients who developed empyema had more febrile (severe) early infection than those with uncomplicated acute bacterial pneumonia. It was impossible to clearly state whether NSAIDs had been started before or after empyema onset. The strength of our case-control study is that it was specifically designed to minimize this bias as much as possible. First, paired case and control were from the same source population. Children with initial acute viral infection that could lead to antipyretic exposure were diagnosed by the same physician. Because controls were recruited by the same doctor, physician-related and geographic variations of exposure were controlled. Second, for LRTVIs, to avoid protopathic bias as much as possible, children without at least 24 hours of apyrexia between recovery from LRTVI symptoms and a diagnosis of empyema were excluded. Third, when the time between onset of acute viral infection and diagnosis of empyema was less than 72 hours, children were excluded to avoid drug exposure for pyrexia and/or pain linked with empyema onset. Fourth, the analysis phase considered drug exposure only when first drug intake occurred within 72 hours after the onset of acute viral infection symptoms. The increased risk of empyema associated with NSAID intake during acute viral infection is our primary observation; the fact that the association is significant as of the first day of NSAID use strengthens our results.",

Still, the risk of empyema associated with NSAID exposure was greater for children not prescribed an antibiotic, and antibiotic intake reduced the risk for children given NSAIDs. NSAIDs recommended as antipyretics are used widely during acute viral infections in children and also have been sold over-the-counter for many years. NSAIDS constitute one of the most widely used classes of drugs, with probably several million prescriptions and several billion over-the-counter tablets sold for children as antipyretics in developed countries. Regardless of the efficacies of these drugs to control fever, our results suggest that their use is associated with complicated bacterial infection associated with acute viral infection and should be reconsidered.",

He also argued that PKU screening was disguised research, and no one should be compelled by law to participate in a research project. Nelson's decision to publish Bessman's Commentary as an Editor's Column attests to the legitimacy of Bessman's concerns at the time. Nelson explained that he shared Bessman's \"concern regarding legislative control of medical procedures and policies and especially so when it is based on incomplete and inadequate information",
