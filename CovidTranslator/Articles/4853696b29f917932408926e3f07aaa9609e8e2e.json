In one period, passengers enjoy very low prices, while in another they have to pay prices close to the full published fares, with little or no discount being available. The absence of an effective antitrust law means that such collusive behaviour faces no threat of prosecution, as long as the airfare is not more than the published full fare. However, in the years since price deregulation, for most of the time passengers have enjoyed lower fares than before, thanks to fierce competition among airlines.",

More frequently, the price agreements collapse and surprisingly low prices ensue. Price wars could be discovered in almost all city-pair markets, and led to the consolidation of the state-owned trunk airlines in October 2002. One of the main aims of these amalgamations, as seen by the General Administration of Civil Aviation of China (CAAC) and the relevant merging parties, was to reduce unnecessarily destructive competition and produce a more \"orderly\" market (see Zhang and Round (2008) for more details).",

For example, Youth Times (2004) reports that Air China offered an 80% discount, or 350 yuan (US$44) fare from 15 to 16 December 2004 on the Shenzhen-Beijing route, whereas previously the discount offered was only 30% at most, and the fare was rarely less than 1000 yuan (US$125). China Southern and Shenzhen Airlines matched this low price a few hours later and all flights in the following days were soon fully booked. However, this short price war ended days later after an \"emergency meeting\" between the sales managers of China Southern and Air China. All airlines' prices rose to around 50% (875 yuan or US$109) of the normal price on 19 December 2004. This pattern of behaviour has been repeated on many city-pair routes from time to time in China.",

            "text": "Price fixing and price war dramas in China's airline markets provide an ideal opportunity to study collusion and price war issues. Although there have been a small number of empirical studies on airfare wars which will be reviewed below, research with convincing evidence into collusive activities remains sparse due to the illegal nature of collusion and the unavailability of data for the airline industry. What differentiates our study from previous studies are its unique data sets and our accessibility to airline staff to obtain firsthand opinions on our results and to discover information that cannot be revealed by the data alone. Accordingly, this paper seeks to discover the patterns of price wars and collusion in China's airline markets, and to estimate the conditions that facilitate the two phenomena. In the next section, we will briefly mention the theoretical models relevant to collusion and price wars. From a review of the empirical literature on airline collusion and price wars, we will discuss the identification of price wars and price collusion in Section 3. Section 3 also provides the data and model specification using the factors expected to contribute to these two types of extreme pricing behaviour. Section 4 will analyse the results, and conclusions will be drawn in Section 5.",

            "text": "The prominent collusion and price-war studies include the seminal work of Stigler (1964) and that of game theorists such as Green and Porter (1984) , Abreu et al. (1986) , Haltiwanger and Harrington (1991) , and Slade (1989) . Most of the game theoretical works have modelled the effect of a change in demand on the breakdown of a cartel. Porter's (1983) analysis of the Joint Executive Committee (JEC) cartel contends that firms with imperfect monitoring can only observe their own output and industry-wide price collusion. The trigger price might be activated by an unexpected low demand shock or by cheating. Either could result in a period of punishment in which each firm produces at Cournot-Nash levels and then resumes a collusive phase. The periodical price wars are a result of the firms' inability to perfectly monitor all the other members' behaviour, and are an information cost that a cartel must bear. Price wars here should not be seen as the end of the cartel, but rather they help the cartel to regain stability. In this model, price wars are thought to be more likely to happen during economic downturns. Ellison (1994) re-examined the JEC cartel and provided further findings in support of the Green and Porter theory. Rotemberg and Saloner (1986) show that if demand shocks are observable, price wars could happen in an expanding economy due to the lure of the benefits of cheating in high demand periods compared with the possible costs of punishment. If the cartel could flexibly adjust the agreed-upon price in response to increased demand (by lowering prices in booms), cheating would not happen and the cartel would not break down. Therefore, price collusion never breaks down, but we can still observe fluctuations in cartel prices. This model provides a situation where a competitive outcome occurs in an expanding economy. The JEC case was also considered by the authors who concluded that price wars occurred in winter periods when the Great Lakes were frozen and in the years when grain production was high.",

To attract consumers, a new entrant will provoke a price war by providing a lower price to temporarily compensate consumers for their switching costs. Alternatively, a lower price can be seen as an attempt to influence consumers' expectations, persuading them to switch to an alternative firm by giving up their current preference. Once an entrant has locked in its new consumers, the price war ends and normal prices resume. Unfortunately for our study, there is not a sufficient number of new entrants in the data sets, and so it is impossible to examine systematically the effects of entry or entry deterrence on pricing.",

The war might be \"mild\" or \"severe\", depending on the amount of excess capacity. The larger the excess capacity, the more severe the price wars. It seems that the airlines in China, as in other countries, have historically operated with chronic excess capacity, 3 and this continues to be the case.

            "text": "The identification of a price war is always problematic, owing to the subjectivity and arbitrariness of the process. Heil and Helsen (2001) described a set of qualitative conditions that could be used to identify a price war, which include: first, the actions and reactions largely involve the competitor instead of the consumer; second, pricing interplay is undesirable for the competitors; third, no competitors deliberately ignite a price war; fourth, the pricing behaviour breaches industry norms; fifth, the pricing interaction happens at a much quicker rate than previous interactions; finally, the direction of the pricing is downward but such pricing behaviour is not sustainable. Most of these conditions are easy to observe and, in fact, most reports in the media on price wars are based on observations of these conditions. Ross (1997) pointed out that the problem of defining price wars in the US cannot be mitigated by the wealth of data available, because the quarterly nature of the data from the Origin and Destination Survey in the US does not allow researchers to observe instantaneous changes in prices. Morrison and Winston (1996) claimed that 90% of the fare wars in their samples lasted two or fewer quarters, with an average of 1.8 quarters on the assumption that any rise in the average fare indicated the end of a war, which means that quarterly data are enough to capture fare wars. However, this claim may not be justifiable because it ignores price wars that last for just days, a few weeks or a month. These short-lived wars would not be revealed by quarterly data. To avoid the problem arising from quarterly data, Busse (2002) identified price wars according to reports in the press. The use of monthly price data in our study does not entirely eliminate the problem as it is still not possible to identify all short-lived price wars that stopped within days. Such short price wars are pervasive in China's airline markets because the explicit or implicit coordination mechanisms among airlines do not let any price war last too long. However, by using monthly data, it is believed that most major price wars with substantial drops in prices are covered.",

If there is a price drop from the previous month to the current month of more than 20%, a price war is arbitrarily said to have occurred in that market. Instead of using their signal that the average fare rises by any amount to identify the end of a price war, the end of a price war in this study is defined as a period when an increase in the price by 5% (from the previous month) is observed in a particular market. Ross (1997) raised another problem in identifying price wars, namely, whether it is better to compare a given quarter's price with that of the previous quarter, or with the price in the same quarter in the previous year. The author argued that given the seasonal fluctuations occurring in the airline industry, the annual comparison is more appropriate. However, this might not be appropriate in our case where mergers caused lower price levels in many airline markets in the years following the mergers, as revealed in Zhang and Round (2009a) . Therefore, we prefer the approach used by Morrison and Winston (1996) . Levenstein and Suslow (2006) pointed out that most modern case studies surprisingly have paid little attention to evaluating the success of cartels, or broadly, of any forms of collusion. They surveyed a few studies and reported the existence of three ways to measure a successful cartel: the use of price to measure success, a comparison of good times against price wars to measure success, and using duration as a proxy for success.",

            "text": "Similar to the definition of a price war, we define the formation of a collusive price agreement as a situation when the average airfare in a given month rises by 20% from the previous month. 4 Such collusive conduct is assumed to continue to be successful until the average airfare drops by 5% or more from the previous month. Again, this definition of collusion is subject to arbitrariness. In fact, Levenstein and Suslow (2006) mentioned that many cartels are formed following a drop in prices, which means that cartel prices might be lower, or at least not higher, than those in the pre-cartel period. Clearly, our definition of collusion cannot capture the situation where the airlines set collusive prices at a moderate level, i.e., neither extremely high nor extremely low. 5 However, the lack of effective antitrust laws can in fact justify the appropriateness of our definition of price collusion in the context of China's airline markets. The reason for this is that once an agreement has been reached, the price could be expected to go up quickly, and once a member has been detected cheating, average prices will drop quickly to match these lower fares. The carriers do not have to disguise their price cooperation by formulating a moderate agreedupon price. Therefore, our definition of price collusion is likely to capture most of the important collusive agreements that lead to dramatic changes in airfares in China. In addition, given the ease of engaging in price agreements, communication between airlines could be engaged in on a day-to-day basis, either formally or informally. Even before the beginning of peak seasons, it was common for meetings to be held to discuss pricing issues or for the airlines to tacitly follow the dominant airline's pricing strategy, which means that any significant changes in prices were closely associated with the establishment or breakdown of a formal or informal agreement. A probit equation is employed for the price-war model. The probit model is based on our collusion definition in which the dependent variable takes the value of 1 for successful price collusion in a given month in a particular market, and 0 otherwise. Based on the theoretical insights into price wars, as well as findings in previous studies, a number of factors that might induce price wars in China's 4 Feuerstein (2005) noted that \"[a] possible indicator that could make antitrust authorities suspicious that collusion takes place are substantial price movements that do not seem to have an explanation in cost or demand shifts. We believe that a 20% change in price could be seen as \"substantial\". 5 We acknowledge that the change in prices might reflect the mingling of the shift in demand and the engagement of collusion. However, as will be discussed later in this paper, our interview information revealed that it was a common practice for the airlines to hold talks before the advent of the peak season. In this sense, our definition of price collusion does not lose its accuracy. It might also be argued that fluctuations in prices are a response to changes in costs. However, this concern can be dismissed in our case as an examination of the airlines' financial reports reveals that most costs were relatively stable during our study period [2002] [2003] [2004] . The only possibly significant shock to this industry might have been the rise in fuel prices. However, fuel prices only started to rise significantly in the second half of 2004 and so this increase should not pose a serious problem for assessing competitive behaviour in the period 2002-2004, even without considering that the airlines could hedge their fuel costs. airline markets will be included as independent variables. As a price war is the counterpoint of price collusion, the same set of factors is also used to investigate the occurrence of price collusion. We also discussed these determinants with some major Chinese airlines' sales managers in Shanghai and they agreed on the relevance of these factors to price wars. 6 To better understand our estimation results, we also discussed our findings with the marketing staff of several airlines based in Shanghai, and they largely agreed with our interpretations.",

The conditions that facilitate price wars can also be seen in Morrison and Winston (1996) , in which they categorised the effects of these conditions into two groups: external effects and internal effects. Internal effects come from the characteristics of firms and the routes on which they operate, the firms' reputations, financial conditions and so on, whereas the external economic effects are caused by fluctuations in the economy that influence demand and supply. The external effects also include seasonal and temporal influences as well as uncertainty.

Stigler (1964) first explored the factors that facilitate effective collusion. He concluded that concentrated markets are more likely to produce cooperative outcomes than less concentrated ones, as cheating can be more easily detected. It is also considered that the gain from cheating is smaller in a concentrated market. In an airline market, both route concentration and airport concentration can be expected to influence pricing behaviour. It is expected that price wars are less likely to erupt in a concentrated market. Concentration can be measured by either market share or the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI).",

Multimarket contacts give firms familiarity with the strategies of their rivals and facilitate their tacit coordination and mutual understanding (Scott, 1993; Baum and Korn, 1996) . One of the notable theoretical works on multimarket contact by Bernheim and Whinston (1990) supports the view that mutual forbearance might exist among firms with multimarket contacts. Evans and Kessides (1994) and Singal (1996) find consistent empirical evidence that endorses the mutual forbearance hypothesis as being relevant to the airline industry.

Substantial asymmetry may imply a divergence of views between firms and make successful collusion more difficult (MacGregor, 1906) . Green and Porter's (1984) imperfect monitoring model is not relevant to China's airline industry, as all the carriers use the same type of reservation system and the booking information is almost transparent to each of them. Also, some airlines that wish to enforce their price agreements even exchange details on a flight's revenue immediately after the departure of the flight. 8 One may argue that as they are state-owned companies, some Chinese airlines might receive different forms of subsidies and thus they are in an advantaged position to compete. Asymmetry might arise from such subsidies. It cannot be denied that special subsidies to one airline could intensify price competition. However, following deregulation in the airline industry, the direct subsidies have been lessened. As far as we know, no airline today receives significantly different treatment from the government. 9 Asymmetry arising from subsidies can be excluded from our consideration.",

It is expected that the airline dummies can capture most of the asymmetries in terms of reputation, network size, frequent flyer programs, etc. For China Eastern, in terms of its involvement in price wars and price agreements, the most relevant rival airlines are Air China, China Southern, Shanghai Airlines and Hainan Airlines. These airlines have a heavy presence in China Eastern's sample markets. For China Southern, the most relevant rivals are China Eastern, Shanghai Airlines, Air China, Shenzhen Airlines and Hainan Airlines, and hence their presence is included in the models. 10",

Therefore, price wars are more likely to happen in periods of low demand. An opposing theory, which argues that price wars could happen in an expanding economy owing to the lure of high benefits from cheating compared with the possible costs of punishment, supports a countercyclical pricing pattern (Rotemberg and Saloner, 1986) . Suslow (2005) investigated the stability of cartels by looking at 71 international cartel agreements covering 45 industries during the period 1920-39 in Europe when cartel agreements were legal (these European countries did not have antitrust legislation before World War II), and found that a cartel is more likely to fall apart during economic downturns and in the presence of economic volatility. It seems that frequent macroeconomic fluctuations increase the possibility of the collapse of a cartel (Carlton and Perloff, 2005) .",

There has not been a case where a price war or collusive price rise occurred simultaneously between the two carriers in all the markets they served. This is because pricing decisions were decentralised to the station managers or even the marketing staff at an airport who could closely monitor and respond promptly to rival airlines' prices. Therefore, once an airline significantly cuts the price on a particular route, almost all the airlines that operate on that route will match the price and get involved. Zhang and Round (2009a) have reported that almost identical prices were charged by China Eastern and China Southern on the same routes during 2002-2004. Based on the definition of price wars and price collusion discussed earlier, the average fall when China Eastern participated in a price war, and the average increase when it engaged in a price-fixing collusion, was 26% and 31%, respectively, and 28% and 35%, 8 Our conversations with some of the airline sales managers in Shanghai show that this is one of the enforcement mechanisms employed to prevent cheating. 9 The government has helped the airlines through difficult times, however.

Typically 74% and 86% of the collusions in which China Eastern and China Southern participated, respectively, broke down within one month, while 59% and 69% of the price wars that the two airlines were involved in also ended within one month. The average duration of a price war was 1.7 months for China Eastern and 1.5 for China Southern. This is very different from the findings of Morrison and Winston (1996) , who claimed that nearly 90% of the fare wars lasted two or fewer quarters with an average duration of 1.8 quarters. The price collusions in our study seem to be shorter lived than price wars, with an average of 1.5 months for China Eastern and 1.4 for China Southern. However, it can also be seen in the figures that there was a small number of instances where collusion lasted for more than two months. Longer duration is an indicator of successful collusion. In a country where antitrust laws make explicit pricing agreements illegal and collusion can only be achieved implicitly through repeated interactions, firms might use the lessons they learned from past experience and act cautiously in upsetting an implicit collusion, as they do not know whether they can quickly establish another one. However, given that the price agreements in China were not totally illegal and could be achieved in many ways, a price agreement could be established quickly any time the airlines wished. If one of the members was not happy with the outcome of an agreement, collusion could quickly break down because of the lack of an effective enforcement mechanism, but it was easy enough to form another one soon thereafter. This might explain why price wars and price collusion in China have tended to be short-lived.",

Without resorting to in-depth interviews with the relevant parties, the true causes may never be established by merely relying on statistical data. In fact, as the services provided by different airlines are not perfectly substitutable, there will always be a relatively disadvantaged airline that has lower revenue on a route than that of other members of the collusive group. In most instances, the only choice for a disadvantaged airline to increase its total revenue is to cut prices (owing to the elastic demand at the agreed price level). When all the airlines follow suit, a price war will break out. The base airline (with headquarters in the city) usually plays an important role in coordinating an agreement to end the war on the route out of that city. Our interviewees all expressed the view that the base airline should take the responsibility to call all the relevant parties in for talks. If this did not work, the station managers would report the case to their own top management for action, and communication at senior levels could then terminate a war. This suggests that, quite often, the end of a war implies the formation of a collusive agreement. In this sense, price wars could be interpreted as a means to enforce collusive agreements, sometimes leading to a more stable agreement after lessons had been learned.",

Our data indicate that there was a slight increase in the duration of collusive agreements in 2004. Our interviews suggested that in 2005 on a small number of routes, the agreements using such approach were quite successful. However, given that any collusive contract could not cover all the aspects of the participants' interests and that the outside conditions on a particular route changed from time to time, it was the norm for agreements to collapse frequently, followed by a new one formed soon after the price wars, with new additional conditions to suit each individual airline's needs.",

However, such behaviour could be revealed in some way to rival airlines by the travel agent or the passengers, and a price war would soon follow.

The magnitude of each coefficient is not especially useful in a practical sense. Therefore, the marginal effect (or partial effect), which shows the effect of an infinitesimal change in a continuous independent variable on the probability of a price war or collusion, is usually reported. In the case of a non-continuous variable, such as a dummy variable, the marginal effect reports the discrete change in the probability of this dummy variable changing from 0 to 1. The marginal effects of the significant variables provided in the two tables were computed at the means of the independent variables. 13 For each model, the Wald test statistic shows that the hypothesis that all the coefficients are simultaneously zero can be rejected at the 1% significance level. 14 In our data sets, the number of passengers variable reflects demand fluctuations both across routes and over time. This may not correspond to the theoretical models of price wars in Green and Porter (1984) and Rotemberg and Saloner (1986) , whose models seem to pertain only to demand fluctuations over time. Although not entirely comparable, the negative sign in the price-war model for China Southern gives some support to the view of Green and Porter that a price war is more likely to erupt when demand is low. 15 Also, the collusion model (China Southern) shows that successful collusion is less likely to be maintained in a market where demand is high. This seems to be consistent with the conclusion in Rotemberg and Saloner (1986) that collusion is hard to maintain in booms. The results of the passenger variable suggest that both price wars and price collusion could happen in a low demand period or in a market where air travel demand is relatively low. It could also be the case that when demand was low, some routes were experiencing price wars, while some others were engaging in price-fixing activities.",

Compared with the shoulder season in June, peak seasons such as January (before the Chinese New Year) and April (before the week-long holiday for Labour Day) in all the models show that an inference can be made about a strong tendency towards collusion and less likelihood of a price war. Our interviews suggest that the airlines are well aware of the times of peak and low seasons. The incentive to coordinate pricing during high seasons is stronger as they believe that the profits in this period can cover the losses in the low seasons. Therefore, it was common practice for the sales managers to meet before the advent of the peak season to form an agreement, as they understood that if they lost peak time revenues, they would suffer losses for the whole year, Therefore, most of airlines observed the agreements quite closely when demand was high, even though this sometimes meant that the flights were not full. 16 This again supports the view of Green and Porter (1984) . However, coefficients on the SARS dummy suggest that when air travel demand was extremely low, the probability of collusion significantly increased for both China Eastern and China Southern. As a result, the likelihood of price wars occurring was reduced. This seems to be consistent with the rationale presented in Rotemberg and Saloner (1986) .",

For China Eastern, more price wars could be seen in November, which confirms our interview information. For China Southern, as well as January, April, September and October, price wars are also less likely in December. This can be Fig. 6 . Number of price wars and collusive conduct episodes in China Eastern's markets (base definition). 12 Only the results using the base definition of price wars and collusion are reported, as we believe that, based on the work experience of one of the authors in the Chinese airline industry, the base definition is more representative of the actual facts. The models were estimated using Stata command \"ivprobit\" with a maximum likelihood estimation method. 13 For example, in China Eastern's price-war model, the tourism routes have a 4% higher probability of experiencing a price war (at the means of the independent variables). 14 To avoid the coefficient being too small in magnitude, we rescaled the oapthhi, distance and paxno variables by dividing them by 100. The rescaling will not affect the interpretation of the results (Wooldridge, 2006) . 15 A similar conclusion in support of Green and Porter (1984) was arrived at by Brander and Zhang (1993) who included a macroeconomic variable (real GNP) in their regression and found that it had a significant positive effect on the collusive conduct of United Airlines. 16 This has already been observed in Figs. 6\u22129. Only China Eastern appears to engage in more price wars in 2003 at the 5% significance level. If we could assume that most of the collusive agreements would last for a long time, then most likely we would have seen price increases in 2003 and 2004. However, a previous study (Zhang and Round, 2009a) has shown that on average, 2003 and 2004 experienced substantial drops in airfares on most routes compared with 2002.",

An additional possible reason is that longer routes are usually associated with a route involving a rival's hub airport, and thus competition tends to be strong. In contrast, shorter routes are usually within an airline's sphere of influence and a certain degree of market power could be exercised.

Rather, it is very likely that when there is a price war, price collusion follows in the same market. The market share at the departure airport seems to have no significant impact on the price wars and collusion. Although economic theory suggests that collusion is more likely to occur in concentrated markets, we have not generally found this result in all the models we have estimated. This is consistent with the survey conducted by Levenstein and Suslow (2006) who conclude that there is no simple relationship between industry concentration and the likelihood of collusion. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that firms in China's concentrated airline markets had the ability to alleviate price fluctuations, or to collude with a moderate pricing strategy, and perhaps on other competitive variables such as flight schedules and capacity that cannot be captured by our price-war and collusion models.",

They give the explanation that although multimarket contact might facilitate carrier cooperation that reduces the chance of price wars, it can also facilitate the spread of price wars once the cooperation breaks down. This might also be true in China's airline market. As well, owing to the strong rivalry in China's airline markets, explicit price-fixing agreements generally could not be expected to last long, let alone any implicit collusion implied by mutual forbearance. In addition, airline pricing decisions are generally made locally. A successful and stable collusion is largely dependent on the negotiation skills of the local sales managers as noted earlier, and these will reflect each individual's self-interest. Under these circumstances, mutual forbearance or implicit collusion across the board is quite difficult to achieve.",

By using monthly fare data to study the period from 2002 to 2004, during which airline consolidations eliminated many trunk and local airlines, it has been found that the occurrence of price wars was not tempered by the mergers. Fare wars occurred periodically across routes, but price collusion was still prevalent. 17 However, both tended to be short-lived. Our interview information obtained from airline staff reveals the importance of changes in demand in inducing or promoting collusion in China.

It does not literally mean that collusive conduct occurs simultaneously in most of the airline markets. Southern. For example, high airport concentration measured by HHI may facilitate collusion in certain circumstances, but it may also lead to more price wars under other conditions. The rejection of the existence of mutual forbearance owing to multimarket contact demonstrates that in dealing with airline merger cases, at least in China, there seems to be no major need to attach too much attention to the potential anticompetitive impacts of this variable, in contrast to previous claims made by many economists. It is, therefore, hard to generalise a set of factors that facilitate price wars or collusion as people might like to see. This reflects the nature of oligopolistic interdependence where any outcome could be possible, as reflected by numerous theoretical game models using different assumptions about firm behaviour and responses to rivals' strategies. Therefore, it is recommended that caution is needed in approving or rejecting proposed mergers, at least in China's airline industry, especially if using a \"checklist\" of the factors (for example, the factors listed in the Australian Merger Guidelines 18 ) thought to be necessary to consider assessing the anticompetitive effects of a proposed merger.",

            "text": "The short-lived collusive agreements reported in our paper might represent different policy challenges compared with those needed to deal with the relatively long-lived cartels identified by Porter (1983) , as well as other international cartels surveyed in Levenstein and Suslow (2006) . However, our study also shows that a small number of markets had consistently higher prices for a relatively long time. Stable collusion may exist in a few markets that are vital to profits of the relevant airlines. More dangerously, if the skills of cooperative negotiations improve, and if efficient enforcement mechanisms can be developed, price agreements could become long-lived. China thus needs an operationally effective modern antitrust law in order to develop a culture for competition, and to ban any implicit and explicit collusion between rival firms throughout the economy.
