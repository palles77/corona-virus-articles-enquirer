In the adult volunteers, ribavirin or placebo was started 2 days after intranasal inoculation with RSV and given for a total of 12 h each day for 3 days.l5 Ribavirin had no effect on minor upperrespiratory-tract symptoms (rhinitis, sore throat, sneezing, and lymphadenopathy), but did reduce systemic complaints, cough, and fever. The drug was then evaluated in a doubleblind controlled trial in children aged 1 week to 2 years who were in hospital with RSV pneumonia.16 Treatment was initiated a mean of 41/2 days after onset of symptoms; drug or placebo was administered almost continuously over 3-6 days into an infant oxygen hood, oxygen tent, or inhalation tubing of a respirator at an estimated dosage of 0 -82 mg/kg bodyweight per hour. By the end of treatment, infants receiving ribavirin had significantly greater improvement of cough, rales, intercostal muscle retraction, lethargy, arterial oxygen saturation, and viral shedding, whereas temperature, nasal congestion, rhinorrhoea, and wheezing were unaffected. In another study, daily 12-hour treatments over 5 days were associated with a more rapid resolution of bronchiolitis, and there was a trend towards a more rapid improvement of rhinitis with nasal discharge and obstruction.\" In no study were toxicity or side-effects noted. Ribavirin remains investigational, but there is a good case for its use in certain infants with RSV infection during the first few months of life-for example, those admitted to hospital and those with congenital heart disease or severe combined immunodeficiency disease.",

            "text": "Rhinovirus: Prophylaxis In 1973, Merigan et all8 showed that 1 -4x 10U of partly purified interferon-alpha given as frequent nasal sprays over 4 days could reduce the symptoms and virus shedding resulting from experimental infection with rhinovirus type 4 on the second day. Several groups have confirmed its efficacy in preventing or ameliorating illness, but its influence on the infection rate has varied. Since subclinical infection could confer immunity against reinfection a high infection rate is by no means disappointing. The main drawback is that, in the quantities necessary for a beneficial effect, intranasal interferon may cause local complications, and long-term use is inappropriate for prophylaxis of such a minor illness. Instead, it could be given for short periods to close contacts of an index case; indeed, preliminary data indicate that this approach may be both safe and effective. '9 The prophylactic effect of interferon-beta has been little studied to date. In one experiment 0 -25 ml of 10-10 U/ml was given into each nostril 3 times daily for 4 days, with rhinovirus challenge on the second day, but there was no reduction of symptoms or viral shedding.20 The scarcity of interferon in the past prompted several clinical trials of interferon inducers. Trials with topically applied polyinosinic/polycytidilic acid, a synthetic double-stranded RNA, pointed to some reduction in symptoms in volunteers infected with rhinovirus,21 but this agent is probably too toxic for use in such acute self-limited conditions. An investigational agent, a propanediamine called CP-20,961, seems non-toxic and consistently reduced symptoms of rhinovirus infection when administered as a nasal spray three or four times daily from day 1 before virus challenge. However, in a double-blind placebocontrolled study it was ineffective in the prevention of \"colds\" when given once daily for 30 days.22 The alternative approach of using specific antivirals has not so far yielded encouraging results. Enviroxime, a potent inhibitor of rhinovirus replication in vitro, has been evaluated clinically both in the United States and Britain. Although prophylactic administration of the drug has been associated with a reduction of certain symptoms, clinical scores of treatment and placebo groups have not differed significantly nor has the drug prevented infection.",

Primary ocular infection is acquired in early life and causes vesicles on the lids and a follicular blepharoconjunctivitis; in many instances the initial infection is subclinical. During recurrences viral replication initially produces small vesicular lesions in the corneal epithelial cells which may rupture and coalesce to form a dendritic or amoeboid ulcer, resulting in disability and pain. The condition may eventually progress to a deep stromal keratitis, necrosis, vascularisation, and scarring. Recurrent ocular herpes tends to be more severe than the primary infection: it arises in 26% of patients within 2 years of the initial episode and in 4307o within 2 years of a second attack. 44 Fortunately, there are several drugs with established efficacy in the treatment of ocular herpes.",

Topically applied F3TdR has proved consistently more effective than IDU, with an average cure rate of 97% for dendritic and geographic corneal lesions.&deg; The healing time has also been consistently shorter, by several days, for F3TdR than for IDU.51 It is also better than vidarabine for the treatment of amoeboid ulcers 52-54 but not dendritic or geographic ulcers, though the trend is towards superiority of F3TdR. F3TdR is effective also in the treatment of keratitis unresponsive to IDU or vidarabine, and is preferable to either agent for large ulcers and complicated disease. Adverse reactions to F3TdR are similar to those to IDU but seem less common. Since there are no reports of cross-toxicity between F3TdR and other ocular antivirals the drug can be used after reactions to other agents. Since there is no cross-resistance between these antivirals, an alternative agent can be confidently substituted if there is no clinical improvement within 7 days. In these circumstances, however, other possible causes for delayed healing should be excluded-for example, insufficient drug application, or an underlying stromal reaction.",
