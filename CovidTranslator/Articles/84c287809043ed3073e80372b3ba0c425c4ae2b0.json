Plus cruise ships, tourist attractions, hotels, restaurants, passenger railroads, motor coaches, tour companies, and much more. These components can be categorized into four major sectors: hotels, restaurants, transportation, and destinations/tourist attractions. Twenty years ago, the business of the industry was generally considered by the media to be \"soft\" or feature news. It conjured up travel poster images of children frolicking at Disney World, exotic destinations with swaying palm trees, fine dining at sunset, and bathing beauties basking in the sun on white, sandy beaches next to azure blue seas.",

A fundamental reason for the change is that industry communicators have succeeded in convincing journalists that travel and tourism has a powerful impact on local and national economies. Stories that once were relegated to feature segments on television and in newspaper travel sections today regularly appear on \"prime-time\" business news segments and in the business sections of national publications because of the significant economic implications. In fact, TIA states on its Web site that travel and tourism ranks as America's third largest retail sales industry, is the nation's largest services export industry, and is one of America's largest employers.",

This was established in 1983, when the U.S. Congress passed a joint resolution designating the week.

The travel agent segment in recent years has undergone significant restructuring due to the proliferation of online reservation networks such as Travelocity, Expedia, and Orbitz. These have provided enormous competition for travel agencies-especially in the airline field where all air carriers over the past decade have dropped the 10 percent commissions they used to remit to travel agencies for bookings. These changes have led to the closing of many \"mom and pop\" agencies and to the consolidation of many others. Still more agencies have had to reinvent themselves by charging service fees, developing niche businesses, and expanding trip advisory services. Agents continue strong relationships with the hotel, cruise line, and tour operator communities. (See Sidebar 1-3 for a list of the ten largest travel agencies.)",

For example, on cable TV, CNN devotes considerable time to industry news, and now there are cable channels exclusively devoted to travel and food. Every Friday, USA Today, America's largest circulation daily newspaper, publishes an extensive travel section, and national newspapers such as The Wall Street Journal and The New York Times have also expanded their weekly coverage of travel and tourism. In the magazine sector, influential publications such as Conde Nast Traveler (circ. 779,081) and National Geographic Traveler Giving increased impetus to the proliferation of PR throughout travel and tourism in recent years has been the explosive growth in technology, in particular the Internet and the emergence of hundreds of new channels on cable TV. It used to be that most media outlets worked a typical nine-to-five daily weekday schedule, with only spotty weekend coverage. The changes cited have put many news distribution outlets on a 24 /7 schedule. This has necessitated increased availability of travel and tourism spokespeople as news organizations scramble to fill time and space gaps on an around-the-clock basis.",

Prompting this change were the periodic economic downturns that occurred in the 1990s during which PR had a more difficult time justifying its goodwill benefits for companies, compared to marketing's ability to directly demonstrate its contributions to the bottom line.

Rockefeller, Jr. The U.S. Committee on Public Information during World War I turned out to be an ideal training ground for another noted PR pioneer, Edward L. Bernays, who is widely considered \"the father of public relations.\" During the 1920s, Bernays taught the first college-level PR course at New York University, authored the first PR textbook, Crystallizing Public Opinion, and articulated the social science foundations for the new practice.The Great Depression of the 1930s provided the impetus for corporations to seek public support by telling their stories. PR departments sprang up in scores of major companies, and today 5,300 U.S. companies have these departments. Following World War II, PR experienced explosive growth. For example, the estimated number of U.S. practitioners soared from 15,000 in 1950 to over 200,000 today. The Public Relations Society of America (PRSA) was founded in 1948. Today, that organization boasts a membership of over 20,000.",
