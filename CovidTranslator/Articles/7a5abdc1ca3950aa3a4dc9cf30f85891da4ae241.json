Vantrappen and Janssens (1) proposed a classification of small intestinal motor disorders based upon abnormalities in slow wave activity or in well-established motility patterns. Many of these motor disorders were associated with diarrhea. With the exception of a disorder characterized by absence of phase 3 of the MMC in patients with bacterial overgrowth (2) and the motor equivalent of the MAPC in a patient with laxative abuse (3), these motility patterns were recorded in experimental animals by means of electromyographic techniques.",

Mathias and coworkers (5) (6) (7) (8) induced in rabbit ileum an abnormal myoelectrical pattern, called the migrating action potential complex (MAPC), by intraileal administration of some diarrheogenic bacteria or their toxins and by perfusion of the ileum with castor oil or ricinoleic acid. These bursts of intensive spiking activity led to stripping contractions that progressed distally and emptied the bowel loop. Another electrical pattern, called repetitive Manuscript received December 16, 1985 ; revised manuscript received Jlme 5, 1986 ; accepted August 11, 1986 bursts of action potentials (RBAPs), was observed in ileal loops infected with invasive bacteria such as Shigella dysenteriae, Campylobacter jejuni, and some strains of Escherichia coli (9) (10) (11) . The RBAPs were either stationary or migrating distally. Caudally migrating short repetitive bursts of spikes, closely resembling RBAPs, were observed by Atchison et al (12, 13) in conscious dogs exposed to laxatives such as castor oil, phenolphthalein and magnesium sulfate. Finally, Code (14) observed occasionally in dogs a series of powerful peristaltic contractions replacing phase 3. These bursts of contractions, called type II peristaltic contractions, progressed to the terminal ileum with a velocity that was slower than that of the individual pacesetter potentials. This pattern also closely resembles RBAPs.",

The probe consisted of a polyvinyl tube with an outer diameter of 6 mm and a length of 300 cm. A small latex balloon that could be filled with mercury or air was attached to the tip of the probe. The tube was introduced via the mouth and could easily be passed through the pylorus and distal duodenum under fluoroscopic control. After the tip Of the probe had passed the angle of Treitz, the mercury was removed from the balloon and the probe was allowed to move freely down the intestine. Eight bipolar electrodes were arranged along the tube. The electrodes were built in the rim of a series of suction holes, 10 cm apart. The two discrete conductive surfaced of the electrodes were located at the two poles of the oval suction orifices, which measured 3 and 4 mm ( Figure 1 ). The conductive surfaces consisted of silver powder dispersed in a mixture of tetrahydrofuran and polyvinyl chloride and were connected to the exterior with fine insulated copper wires (diameter 100 Ixm), lying in the lumen of the tube. The strand of 16 copper wires was shielded by polyvinyl tubing (outer diameter 1.2 mm). The electrode wires were fixed to a connector box.",

The signals were amplified by two eight-channel Siemens-Elema Mingographs 82 with universal amplifiers (type 854) and modifiable external electrical time constant. The time constant was kept at 0.002 sec for spike recording and 5 sec for the recording of slow waves. In this way the electrical activity picked up by each electrode was displayed in two different recordings: one well suited for slow wave activity (Figure 2) , the other for spike activity (Figure 3 ). During recording both the patient and the probe were grounded. To obtain uninterrupted detection of slow waves and spikes, a negative pressure of 25-50 cm water was applied on the proximal end of the probe. The intraluminal electromyographic technique used in this study is well tolerated and can routinely be applied in both volunteers and patients. The probe, which is relatively simple to construct, provides uninterrupted recording of slow waves and spikes at eight or more sites along the small intestine. The recordings provide no major difficulties of interpretation.",

The motor equivalent of the MAPC has been reported by Mathias Phillips (15) reported monophasic high-pressure waves extending over 12--48 sec and propagating rapidly (0.6-1.93 cm/sec) throughout long jejunal segments in patients with a still unidentified infectious diarrhea. These manometric complexes, however, have not yet been identified as the motor equivalent of MAPC activity. The MAPC has been identified as a diarrheogenic pattern. Different mechanisms, including \"hypermotility,\" \"hypomotility,\" increased permeability of the intestinal mucosa, hypersecretion, and malabsorption, alone or in association with each other, may play a role in the pathogenesis of diarrhea. Although the contribution of motility to accelerated transit and diarrhea is largely unknown, it seems logical to assume that an increase in the number of stripping peristaltic contractions, progressing over long segments of small bowel during the interdigestive and digestive phases, will result in an accelerated transit and in an increase in the volume of intestinal contents flowing into the colon, which may favor diarrhea.",

            "text": "A number of myoelectric patterns that are known to be associated with diarrhea have been observed in animals (1, 14) . The role of MAPC activity in the pathogenesis of diarrhea is controversial. Intestinal fluid accumulation primarily caused by hypersecre-tion could stimulate secondary peristalsis. However, Mathias et al (5) showed that cholera enterotoxin stimulates myoelectrical activity and results in propulsive ring contractions in the rabbit ileum that were independent of fluid accumulation in the lumen. This altered myoelectric activity, called migrating action potential complexes, is predominantly induced by noninvasive bacteria such as Vibrio cholerae and enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli and their heat-labile toxins, including choleragenoid, the 5-beta subunits of choleragen (6, 16) , and by exposure of the small intestine to castor oil or ricinoleic acid (11) . Although these agents are known to enhance intestinal secretion, the studies of Sinar et al (16) , Burrows and Merritt (17) and Schanbacker et al (18) suggest that, in addition to the secretory state, a motility component has a role in the production of these infectious or laxativeinduced diarrheas. The observation of Sinar et al that choleragenoid induced MAPC activity without stimulating adenylate cyclase and fluid output indicates that, although secretion and motility may occur at the same time, each process is occurring by different \"second messengers\" (16, 19) . In animals with diarrhea following infection with viral enteropathogens and parasites, a disruption of the normal myoelectrical activity was observed, sug- gesting that motility may contribute to the pathogenesis of infectious diarrhea as well (17, 18) . In patients presenting with spontaneous diarrhea or in volunteers with artificially induced diarrhea, abnormal myoelectrical patterns have not been described. With the development of our novel and simple recording technique, it has become possible to study small intestinal electrical activity in hu- ,i,,~ Dis~as,.s ,,,,d s~,,c~s, rot. 32, No. 1o (O,ober 1987) marts. The identification of a characteristic motility pattern in a patient with secretory diarrhea may contribute to the difficult investigation of the role of motility in the pathogenesis of diarrhea in man.",

Similar to the MAPC in experimental animals, the propagated spike bursts recorded in our patient constitute a highly organized and striking pattern that occurs irregularly with widely varying time intervals. It extends over more than one slow wave and migrates distally over long bowel segments, the propagation velocity being that of the slow waves.
