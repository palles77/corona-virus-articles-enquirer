For patients at risk for asthma, or with existing asthma, viral respiratory tract infections can have a profound effect on the expression of disease or loss of control. New evidence has shown that wheezing episodes early in life with the common cold virus, human rhinovirus, is a major risk factor for the later diagnosis of asthma at age six years. For those with existing asthma, exacerbations are a major cause of morbidity, need for acute care and, rarely, death. Viral respiratory tract infections, most frequently with rhinovirus, are the predominant microorganisms associated with asthma exacerbations. Evidence is also emerging that deficiencies in antiviral activity and the integrity of the airway epithelial barrier may make individuals with asthma more likely to have severe viral respiratory infections of the lower airway, and thus increase the risk of exacerbation. Given the influences of respiratory viruses on many aspects of asthma, efforts to understand the mechanisms and risk factors by which these airway infections cause changes in airway pathophysiology are a first step in improved treatment.",

Beginning in 1989, these investigators identified 52 infants who were hospitalized with RSV bronchiolitis and followed them to age 13 years. The hospitalized children were matched with 93 subjects of similar birth date and sex who had not been hospitalized with RSV bronchiolitis. When the children were 7 \u00bd years old, those with both a family history of asthma and bronchiolitis had high rates of asthma (38%) compared with those with only one of these two variables, i.e., family history of allergy/ asthma or RSV bronchiolitis alone.

Additional follow-up revealed that the timing of birth date with respect to the peak of the winter bronchiolitis season was also related to the risk of developing asthma. These findings suggest that infants who are at highest risk for severe viral bronchiolitis are also most likely to go on to develop asthma. Moreover, these findings suggest that several viral wheezing illnesses in infancy contribute to subsequent asthma. Finally, at least two prospective birth cohort studies have also documented the association of early life wheezing illnesses due to RSV and the subsequent expression of persistent wheezing and asthma as the children enter school. 15 , 16 The positive relationship of RSV infections to asthma has not, however, been seen in all investigations. For example, longitudinal data from Tucson Children's Respiratory Study reported RSV lower respiratory tract infections before three years of age were associated with subsequent wheezing and asthma in early childhood, but not beyond age 11 years.17 Furthermore, Thomsen and colleagues evaluated the relationship between RSV hospitalization and asthma using a large twin registry in Denmark. 18 This analysis led to the conclusion that severe RSV infections did not cause asthma, but instead, a common genetic predisposition to both RSV bronchiolitis and asthma exists. In considering these conflicting findings, a resolution of this debate will likely require a randomized, placebo-controlled interventional study to prevent RSV infection during infancy to more fully address this question.",

First, molecular techniques are now available to detect HRV in respiratory secretions.22 , 23 This technique is highly sensitive and specific as well as having the capacity to use secretions obtained with noninvasive techniques, such as a \"nose blow\" into a plastic bag.24 Second, PCR methods are capable of detecting small amounts of virus which may not be accounted for by culture. Third, when HRV, or other viruses, are detected, the viral load can be quantitated. Finally, it has now become possible to differentiate the multiple HRV stains and, as will be discussed later, this has led to the discovery of a new species of HRV, which might have considerable relevance to wheezing illnesses and asthma. 24 -26 To more precisely study and identify the role of respiratory viruses in the development of asthma, Lemanske et al. established a birth cohort of children who are at high risk for asthma.27 These children had at least one parent with asthma or allergic disease. The COAST (Childhood Origins of Asthma) study was formed in 1998, with 289 children enrolled between 1998 and 2000. Nasal washes were obtained at well child visits as well as with respiratory infections over the first year of life ( Figure 2 ). For the next five years, nasal lavage specimens were collected with symptomatic respiratory illnesses. At three years of age, the investigators evaluated the frequency of persistent wheezing.28 Then at six years of age, the 259 children remaining in the study were evaluated for asthma.15 From this study design, the investigators have been able to determine associations of respiratory illnesses with early life wheezing and the eventual development of asthma.",

Infants with both sensitization and RV wheezing had the highest incidence of asthma. There was no additive effect to RV wheezing in the first year of life by aeroallergen sensitization. When these comparisons were made in the third year of life, RV wheezing had the more dominant effect on asthma risk (OR 25.6 [CI, 8.2, 79.6]) compared to the still significant but relatively small influence of aeroallergen sensitization (OR 3.4 [CI, 7.7, 6.9]).

Since HRV infections are so common in the general population, this seems unlikely. These observations suggest several hypotheses relating more severe HRV illnesses to recurrent wheezing and asthma. First, it is conceivable that asthma is fundamentally associated with dysfunctional antiviral immune responses, such as deficient production of interferons.29 , 30 Second, there may be environmental factors (e.g. tobacco smoke exposure) that promote more severe HRV illnesses, recurrent wheezing, and ultimately asthma. Finally, certain viral strains could be more pathogenic or \"asthmagenic\" in affected individuals. These explanations are not necessarily mutually exclusive and will be discussed subsequently.",

For example, Heymann and co-workers7 evaluated the presence of viral respiratory tract infections among infants and children hospitalized for wheezing and the relationship of the patient's atopic status to the asthma admission. In children 3 to 18 years of age, there was a distinct seasonal pattern with a greater percentage of children admitted between September and November. For the children three years and older, HRV was the predominant respiratory virus detected in those hospitalized for wheezing (61% vs. 21% in control subjects). In addition, the wheezing children had substantially and significantly higher serum IgE values compared to control subjects (geometric means, 386 IU/ml vs. 38 IU/ml), and 84% of the children with wheezing were sensitized to at least one aeroallergen in their test panel. These data suggest that allergic sensitization, at least of children, is an important risk factor for wheezing with a HRV infection, and IgE-dependent responses may also contribute to the development of wheezing with a cold. Additional studies in children and adults indicate that allergic individuals who are exposed to allergens have the highest risk for virus-induced wheezing and asthma exacerbations. 59 , 60 In addition, Johnston and Sears61 , 62 have been instrumental in recognizing and describing the September epidemics of asthma which occur with regularity in the Northern Hemisphere and how these events may provide novel insights into both host and environmental factors which lead to asthma exacerbations. In Canada, the sharp increases in emergency department visits for acute asthma and hospitalizations for childhood asthma have been predictable year-to-year As these investigators point out, aeroallergens, air pollution, and interactions with climate can affect asthma exacerbations. To test the hypothesis that the return to school and subsequent asthma exacerbations were related to viral respiratory infections, children presenting to an emergency department (ED) in Canada during three weeks in September along with community-recruited children with equally severe asthma who did not require acute care were evaluated.61 For 62% of the ED cases with asthma, a respiratory virus was identified by PCR detection methods compared to 42% of the asthma controls. Detection of respiratory viruses this frequently during September likely reflects the commonness of this virus at this time of the year; however, only a portion of those with the virus went on to wheeze. As the authors note, the beginning of the school term is often associated with higher stress levels and increased concentrations of aeroallergens in the environment. They go on to conclude, \"Although a viral infection may be the immediate trigger for an asthma exacerbation, it is likely that these factors act together to bring about the September epidemic.\"",

Notably, both HRV infection and allergic inflammation induce epithelial cells to secrete thymic stromal lymphopoeitin (TSLP), a cytokine that can act on dendritic cells and others to promote Th2 differentiation thereby enhancing allergic inflammation.71 Finally, animal models suggest that biased innate immune responses to respiratory viruses in early life may establish overproduction of key cytokines such as IL-13, leading to suboptimal antiviral responses, increased risk for respiratory allergies, and changes in airway structure to promote asthma.72",

To accomplish this goal, 67 children were recruited at the time of emergency treatment for an acute asthma exacerbation. Postnasal aspirates were obtained along with blood samples for microarray assays of cells during the acute and convalescent period and analyses of leukocyte phenotypic features by flow cytometry was performed. Eighty-percent of the children had a respiratory virus detected with HRV accounting for 95% of the infections. Circulating lymphocytes were decreased whereas monocyte/dendritic cell populations displayed an up-regulated CCR2 expression and enhanced potential to provoke inflammation when recruited to the lung. These cells also had an up-regulated expression of Fc\u03b5RI\u03b1 with a concomitant gene expression signature that is representative of the IL-4/IL-13-dependent \"alternatively activated\" phenotype. Together with studies conducted in a rodent model of respiratory virus infection,72 these findings implicate specific components of the innate antiviral response including dendritic cells, alternatively-activated macrophages, and NK T cells, in the pathogenesis of virus-induced wheeze and asthma. Thus, underlying allergic disease appears to be either a risk factor for wheezing with a cold or may \"lay the ground work\" for the respiratory virus to interact with airway epithelium and set into motion the processes leading to an asthma exacerbation.

In this march to asthma, allergic sensitization occurs in the toddler age and become an additional risk factor for asthma. In asthma, viral respiratory infections also contribute significantly to exacerbations. The role of infection in the development of persistence of disease or severity has yet to be established. What factors determine if a respiratory infection provokes asthma? Two major factors, the \"seed\" and the \"soil\" contribute to the patient's susceptibility to an infection and subsequent wheezing. The \"seed\" risks relate to the infectious agent. The \"soil\" represents the multiple patient risk factors including the underlying inflammation and their immune response. It is proposed that it is the collective interaction between the \"seed\" and the \"soil\" which determines the outcome with infections.
