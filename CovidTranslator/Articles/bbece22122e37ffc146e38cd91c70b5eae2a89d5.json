A consumer survey was conducted in Hohhot, China in September 2009, one year after the melamine contamination of milk was disclosed to the public. Households with young children who were not being breast-fed reported that they had reduced milk consumption by at least 1/3 in the immediate aftermath of the melamine disclosure and 39% reported that they cut out milk consumption altogether. A significantly higher percentage of households with children reported being concerned with the effects of melamine in milk and two communicable diseases: SARS and H1N1 influenza than were those with no children. A significantly higher percentage of households with no young children were concerned with the effects of Trace Sudan in chicken, Clenbuterol in pork, chicken eggs with red yolks, and excess iodine in milk powder than were those with young children. All households that reduced consumption of fluid milk following news of the melamine contamination reported a much greater concern with most food safety and health scares than did households that did not reduce consumption of fluid milk. Survey data revealed that most consumers had a relatively low level of knowledge of the Food Safety Law that went into effect just over three months before this survey was conducted.",

            "text": "Less than one month after the August 2008 Olympic Games were concluded in Beijing, Chinese consumers were shocked by the announcement that melamine, an industrial compound usually used in plastics, was present in infant milk formula. The first tainted product that was reported was produced by the Sanlu Dairy Company, one of the largest milk processors with a distribution network throughout China. Although it is clear in hindsight that several Chinese government agencies and at least one dairy company had previous knowledge of melamine contamination and the damaging effects of this chemical on the kidneys of babies (see timeline in Fig. 1 ), the public was not generally aware of the danger until September 16 when the Chinese government announced that melamine had been detected in the infant milk formula of 22 dairy companies. Panic spread when, on the following day (September 17, 2008) , Health Minister Chen Zhu stated tainted infant milk formula had \"sickened more than 6200 children, and that more than 1300 others, mostly newborns, remain hospitalised with 158 suffering from acute kidney failure\" (Chang, 2008) . Consumer confidence plummeted when it was revealed later that six babies had died, almost 300,000 sickened, and more than 50,000 hospitalized (many for several weeks) from consuming the contaminated milk products (Graham-Harrison, 2009; Jacobs, 2009; Qiao, Guo & Klein, 2010) . As most of those hospitalized were less than two years old, parents of young children searched frantically for alternative sources of milk products, including products imported from abroad. The fear extended throughout 2009 as reports periodically appeared in the press about new batches of melamine-contaminated dairy products being discovered for sale (Areddy, 2010; Midler, 2010) and even into 2010 (Qiu, 2010) though no further reports of serious illnesses or deaths of babies appeared.",

Though previous food safety incidents in China had made clear the need for improved food safety throughout the supply chain, the melamine scare seemed to precipitate legislative actions. Less than one year after the melamine problem became widely known, the Chinese government introduced a new Food Safety Law (USDA, 2009) , which replaced the Food Sanitation Law that had been in effect since 1995. The new law notably changed the emphasis from \"Food Sanitation\" to \"Food Safety,\" reflecting the priority placed by the Chinese government on improving the safety and the international reputation of the country's food system (Xiu & Klein, 2010) . The Food Safety Law established improved procedures for supervision and management of food products. It implemented rules for reporting food safety accidents, strengthened risk assessment procedures, improved supervision of food additives (which now must be approved and listed in a government catalogue), implemented improved measures for recall of products, and, importantly, abolished provision of inspection-free food items (which previously had been available to approved enterprises). Violators of the Food Safety Law are subject to severe penalties, including compensation to consumers of ten times the value of their purchases of substandard products plus their economic losses (Xiu & Klein, 2010) .",

Parents of young children everywhere naturally are concerned over the safety of foods ingested by their children. Baker (2003) , in a survey of 2000 consumers in the United States, found that women and members of households with young children were the most likely to have an extreme avoidance response to food risks. Benson (2011) noted that consumer attitudes towards risk of a major food safety hazard are shaped by \"the affected party's feelings regarding the value of what might be lost.\" There can be no greater loss than losing one's child. Worries about the safety of children's foods can even have effects in the labour market. Xue and Sun (2009) found that when risks of food safety for infants exist, Chinese women prefer to increase the time spent bringing up their old children and, consequently, reduce time worked outside the home.",

The carcinogenic red dye Sudan I, widely used as a synthetic colourant in industrial compounds, was found in two chicken products sold by KFC in China in March 2005: New Orleans chicken wings and chicken hamburgers. The Sudan dyes are permitted for use in household and textile products but are not permitted as food colour additives in China (Xu, Wang, Fang, Song, & Zhang, 2010) .

            "text": "Understandably, its discovery in chicken products in a popular fast-food restaurant chain caused widespread anxiety across China. 2) Clenbuterol hydrochloride in pork. This is a drug used to treat bronchial asthma but has been abolished because of its side effects, including increased heart rates, fatigue, hand tremors and vomiting. However, some farmers used it to develop more muscle (and less fat) tissues in pigs before they were sold. Many people became ill following consumption of the tainted pork (BBC News, 2009 ). This problem has been identified almost every year and in every province of China. 3) Inferior milk powder. Substandard milk powder was found in ten provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities in 2004. The substandard milk powder was produced by starch, sugar, milk essence and other cheap ingredients and was deficient in protein, fat, and vitamins that are necessary for growth of children. Several babies died and many more were found to be suffering from malnutrition as a result of consuming the inferior milk powder. Many of the babies harmed by the inferior milk powder were the children of impoverished and poorly educated farm people who have little understanding of nutrition and the dangers of counterfeit products (Li, 2004) . 4) Red yolk chicken eggs. In early 2004, some companies promoted and sold eggs with red yolks. They were advertised as the \"best quality free-range chicken eggs,\" with the red yolks the result of using first-class chicken feed (Lee, 2005) . However, it was soon discovered that the red yolks were not the result of ordinary chicken feed but rather were caused by feed that was mixed with an unknown quantity of poultry feed additive called carophyll red. Carophyll red (with 10% canthaxanthin) is a colouring agent for foods and drugs. The European Commission of Health and Consumer Protection has limited the use of canthaxanthin in chicken feed to no more than 25 mg/kg because long term consumption of high dosages of canthaxanthin has been shown to cause retinal damage, possibly leading to blindness (Lee, 2005) . 5) Injecting meat with water. This involves either forcing water into the stomachs of pigs or cattle shortly before slaughter or injecting water into the hearts of recently slaughtered animals so that the water will quickly flow into the animals' flesh through the blood vessels. This process increases the weight (and, consequently, the returns) of the products. Reports indicate that the practice has been applied to much pork and practically all beef for more than twenty years (WSJ, 2009). Watered meats are less nutritious, spoil more easily, and encourage the growth of toxin-producing bacteria. In some cases, the water may even contain industrial waste. 6) Expired fluid milk. In June 2005, the Zhengzhou subsidiary of dairy company Guangming (also known as Bright Dairy) was found to be re-processing and selling expired milk and pre-dating other products. The news of this incident was followed by a widely circulated report that quoted an unnamed \"industry insider\" as saying that recycling expired milk is the norm in the domestic dairy industry and more than 90 percent of fresh milk had been contaminated before entering processing procedures (China Daily, 2005 ). An online survey following the reporting of this incident showed that 80.5% of nearly 200,000 netizens said they would no longer buy Bright Dairy products although 72.9% once trusted the brand (Asia Times, 2005). 7) Excessive iodine in milk powder. Nestle, the Swiss food industry giant, was found to have allowed excess iodine levels in some of the milk powder sold for consumption by infants and young children in China. It is well-known that excess iodine can cause changes to the thyroid gland. According to the National Food Standards in China, the amounts of iodine in 100 g of milk powder should be between 30 and 100 mg. The Nestle's product reportedly contained as much as 191 mg (Guo, 2005) . Although the company refuted the claims, responding that the products conformed to international standards set by the Codex Alimentarius (Chinadairy, 2005) , the news panicked many of the parents of small children throughout the country.",

SARS (or Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) infection causes fever, coughs and chest tightness. The symptoms of severe respiratory failure occur rapidly, are progressive, and can quickly lead to death. The disease is highly contagious and caused near-panic in places where it was discovered. It was first found in Guangdong Province (in South China) and later was traced to a wild animal (a cat-like civet) that is served as a delicacy food in southern China. Soon, the World Health Organization (WHO) classified SARS as an epidemic in Hong Kong, Singapore, Toronto, Hanoi, Taiwan, as well as in Guangdong and Shanxi provinces. The WHO reported that 349 persons died from SARS on the Chinese mainland and 4941 had the disease but were rehabilitated (WHO, 2004) .",

Those who purchased milk for their children were asked if they bought fresh fluid milk, domestic infant milk formula or imported infant milk formula prior to September 2008. They were then asked whether (and by approximately how much) their household had reduced its consumption of dairy products and were asked to explain why. They were asked if they purchased imported products to replace the domestic dairy products and which dairy products (domestic and imported) they currently used for feeding their children. Those in the sample were asked about how their confidence in the domestic dairy industry had changed in the year since the initial disclosure of melamine contamination. They were asked how the melamine-contaminated food scare compared to seven other recent food safety scares as well as two serious communicable diseases: SARS and H1N1 influenza. They also were asked questions related to their overall level of knowledge and understanding of the Food Safety Law that went into effect three months prior to the survey.

Significantly higher percentages of households with no young children indicated they were seriously concerned with Trace Sudan in chicken, Clenbuterol in pork, expired fluid milk and excess iodine in milk powder than were households with young children. This result might partly be related to the open-ended questions that were posed. Those with young children in the household selected significantly fewer food safety incidents to be of major concern than did those with no young children, possibly due to their focus on getting their families through the two most recent crises: melamine contamination of milk and the H1N1 influenza. Trace Sudan in chicken occurred in a popular fast-food chain of stores, a place where households with small children might be less inclined to visit. Clenbuterol in pork is known to have serious adverse health effects and, since it has been found almost every year in every part of China, has received widespread publicity. Findings from the survey revealed that this food safety issue is more \"top-of-mind\" for those without young children than those with young children, understandable perhaps because most urban families eat pork every day. And, although those with no young children selected expired fluid milk and excess iodine in milk powder more often than did those with young children, overall, only a small percentage of respondents responded that these two food safety incidents caused them much anxiety. Due to the dominance of locally-based Mengniu and Yili dairy companies, sales of products from Bright Dairy Company (headquartered in Shanghai), which was associated with the expired milk problem, are not large in Hohhot so fewer households were affected. In the case of the excess iodine in Nestle's milk powder, the price of imported milk powder always has been much higher than that of domestic products, again resulting in less concern about that incident among the public. Zhou and Wang (2011) reported an inverse relationship between level of education and concern about the melamine scandal from their survey of consumers in Nanjing, China. In other words, the less educated respondents had more concern about melamine and the more educated had less concern. Results from our study provide mild (but statistically insignificant) support for their results. In our study, 38% of respondents with less than 12 years of education selected melamine to be of concern as compared to 35% of those with more than 12 years. We found strong direct correlation between income and expressed concern about melamine: 36% of those earning less than 1000 RMB per month indicated they were concerned about melamine, 44% of those who earned between 1000 and 2000 RMB indicated they were concerned, and 49% of those in the highest income category indicated they were concerned.",

Wang, Yuan, and Gale (2009) noted that increasing concerns of food safety by Chinese consumers with rising incomes and access to improved information may push more companies to implement hazard analysis critical control point (HACCP) systems for products marketed domestically, though the costs of implementing such systems require major up-front investments and substantial operational costs. In a survey of Beijing consumers, it was found that less than 20% were aware of what HACCP represented, and most who had heard of HACCP had learned about it within the previous year (Wang, Mao & Gale, 2008) .",

Brady, Li, and Brown (2009) found that the media had a huge influence in shaping consumers' attitudes and behaviours following two well-publicized outbreaks of Escherichia coli 0157:H7 in the United States in 2006 as those who listened more to news reports had larger changes in their attitudes and behaviours than did those who listened less. Media blitzes that accompanied recent food safety and health scares in China alarmed many households and resulted in significantly changed behaviours in the short run but, as shown by Qiao et al. (2010) and also in this study, a high percentage of households had resumed their earlier consumption levels of dairy products only two months after the initial publicity was delivered.",

There appears to be a lot of trust by a high proportion of households (including many with young children in the home) that governments and businesses will employ the necessary procedures to protect the safety of their food products. This trust has proven misplaced time and again in recent years during the rapid growth of the Chinese economy.",

Just days before the end of 2011 (and three years after the melamine scare), Mengniu, one of the largest dairy companies in China, admitted that a batch of its products was contaminated with flavacin M1, which can cause liver cancer. It blamed the contamination on \"mouldy and deteriorated\" fodder (Best, 2012) . As incomes of most Chinese consumers have increased quickly with the rapidly growing economy and they have expressed increased demand for a greater variety of healthful and safe foods, the seeming repetitiveness of food safety scares in China demonstrates that the Chinese food industry and government agencies that regulate the industry still have a ways to go to provide the level of food safety that increasingly knowledgeable and sophisticated Chinese consumers desire.",
