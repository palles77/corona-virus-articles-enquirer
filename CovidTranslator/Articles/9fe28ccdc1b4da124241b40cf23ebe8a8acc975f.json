Nanotechnology is defined as 'the branch of engineering that deals with things smaller than 100 nm (especially with the manipulation of individual molecules)'. Nano-sized structures can be fabricated through a bottom-up process, where the object is built up molecule by molecule or atom by atom. Alternatively, a top-down approach can be utilized in which the structure is fabricated by removal of unwanted material from a larger block of material. Both microand nanotechnology are finding applications in many different areas of science and engineering [1] [2] [3] [4] . This article reviews recent advances in the application of both micro-and nanotechnology in molecular diagnostics. It surveys the current use of silicon-glass and plastic microchips, and nano-sized structures such as carbon nanotubes, nanopores and nanoparticles, and discusses their prospects and current barriers to implementation in routine molecular diagnostics. Key objectives for innovation in molecular diagnostics include rapid sequencing, multiplexed testing, integrated analysis that combine all steps in the analytical process from sample handling to read-out of the result, and assays that do not require an amplification step. Microchips and a range of nanostructures are gaining in importance as possible technological solutions that will lead to the realization of these ambitious objectives (TABLE 1) .",

Arguably, this could obviate the need for any other mode of nucleic acid analysis.

The voltage across the membrane drives nucleic acids through the membrane. The only locations through which the nucleic acids can traverse the membrane are at the pores. At each pore, a current is generated that is disrupted as DNA or RNA molecules traverse the pore. The characteristics of the time and magnitude of disruption of the crosspore current are dependent on the base composition and length of the DNA or RNA molecule. This is analogous to the Coulter counter that is used in routine hematology analysis of peripheral blood cells [7] . The nanometer-sized pores control the processing of nucleic acid strands as size limits the passage to one DNA or RNA specie at a time. Initial studies with 2.6-nm hemolysin pores showed that single-stranded (ss)DNA but not double-stranded (ds)DNA traversed the pore [8] . The cross-sectional size of a dsDNA molecule is approximately 2 nm, and passage of a dsDNA has been demonstrated using an ion beam-fabricated 3 nm diameter silicon nitride nanopore [9] . In contrast, ssDNA but not dsDNA translocated through a 0.5 nm, ion beamfabricated pore [10] . There is an increasing diversity of sizes of nanopores that are being created and used to process a greater distribution of sizes of DNA [5] . Another type of nanomanipulation uses a nanochannel to stretch genomic DNA and simplify the sequencing. This potential to manipulate genomic DNA directly is at an early stage of development, but is an indication that single-molecule nucleic acid detection and manipulation is a realistic target [11] .",

            "text": "Colloidal gold (gold granules) has been used for electron microscopic localization of nucleic acids since the 1960s [13] . The renaissance in the use of gold and decorated gold nanoparticles as oligonucleotide labels can be traced to the work of Mirkin and his associates in the mid-1990s [14] . At first, the use of gold nanoparticles in DNA assays relied on colorimetric changes that occurred when gold nanoparticles aggregate (e.g., color changes from red to purple) [15] . The introduction of new scanning methods and the re-emergence of surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) have provided considerable impetus to this rapidly evolving field of nanoparticle labels. Fluorescent detection, although the norm, has some disadvantages, such as the high cost of fluorescent scanners, the broad emission spectrum and the photoinstability of the dyes commonly used. Metal nanoparticles have distinct advantages over fluorescent dyes as labels. They have narrow Raman emission peaks, and the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) is directly related to nanoparticle size, which makes for simple multiplexing strategies based on size [16] . The SPR of an object depends on small changes in the refractive index that occur near or at the surface of a metal such as gold, silver or copper [17] . Metal nanoparticles are stabilized by surface ligands (such as citrate) in order to maintain solubility, and the variation in the size of the nanoparticles creates the variation in SPR (thus a 40-nm gold nanoparticle gives off a different SPR than a 15-nm gold nanoparticle, even though they are both made of the same metal).",

Raman spectroscopy relies on detecting a signal that is only 0.0001% of the light that is scattered from the sample, thus the combination of a low signal intensity and fluorescence background could be problematic [21] . SERS solves the problem of autofluorescence and background fluorescence through metal adsorption of the sample with metals such as silver and gold. The resonant excitation of surface plasmons on the metal surface results in a Raman signal enhancement of 10 2 -10 4 compared with the Raman signal generated from the sample alone [22] . The importance of SERS is evident from its diverse applications in genomic and proteomic assays [23, 24] . Another important aspect of SERS is its application in a DNA-gold nanoparticle-based method of detecting unamplified genomic DNA sequences by measuring scattered light [25] , as opposed to the flatbed scanner method that measures reflected light [20] . This unamplified DNA assay relied on monitoring the plasmon shift that occurs when 40-50-nm diameter gold nanoparticles aggregate; the process allows for the detection of aggregates in the presence of a large amount of nonaggregated material and a detection limit of just 333 zmol of target was achieved [25] .",

This approach uses gold nanoparticles derivatized with single-stranded oligonucleotide barcodes and an oligonucleotide complementary to a portion of the target sequence under interrogation, as well as magnetic microparticles that are modified with multiple copies of an oligonucleotide complementary to a second portion of the same target sequence under interrogation. Oligonucleotide complementary to the singlestranded, bound bio-barcodes are hybridized to the gold nanoparticle. The target under interrogation is hybridized to both the nanoparticle and magnetic microparticles. If complementation occurs to both single-stranded, bound oligonucleotide on the nanoparticles as well as the second oligonucleotide from a different region of a target bound to the magnetic microparticle, then the two particles become bridged by hybridization to two different regions in the target DNA. This complex is then trapped on a magnetic column, washed and the single-stranded hybridized nanoparticle barcode is released by heat denaturation and annealed to an array containing one register that is complementary to the released bio-barcode strand. Since there are many bio-barcodes on each gold nanoparticle, hybridization of one target molecule results in release of many bio-barcodes per nanoparticle, which greatly amplifies the detection signal. The released bio-barcode contains a region complementary to one of the array-capture barcodes as well as sequence complementary to an oligonucleotide-bound, gold nanoparticle probe. The biobarcode is captured on the array and hybridized to the universal oligonucleotide-bound nanoparticle. Detection is facilitated by silver enhancement of the bound gold nanoparticle and scanning with a flatbed scanner. The BCA technique allows for the detection of 500 zmol of target DNA, which translates to approximately ten copies in a 30-\u00b5l reaction mixture [26] .",

In the form of microrods, other metals such as indium can also be used as labels for DNA hybridization assays (detection limit 250 zmol). This metal is not normally present in biologic samples, and it can be quantitated by solid-state derivativechronopotentiometric measurements at a thick-film electrode transducer.

Silver nanoparticles can also be used as oligonucleotide labels in DNA hybridization assays and detected using an electrochemical assay [29] . Following hybridization of the target DNA with the silver nanoparticlelabeled oligonucleotide probe, silver ions are released from the nanoparticle labels by oxidative metal dissolution, and the silver ions measured by anodic stripping voltammetry at a carbon fiber ultramicroelectrode.

The narrow emission line widths allow a large number of resolvable bands to be packed into the same spectral bandwidth, and this enables a larger number of uniquely distinguishable combinations (>1 million).

Nanoscale properties apart from particle size, such as particle shape, can also facilitate multiplexing. This leads to the prospect of generating different signals from nanoparticle labels with different shapes but made of the same substance. One of the first examples has been a nanoprism (100 nm edge) made of silver [46, 47] . Nanoprisms interact with light (three surface plasmon bands at \u03bb max = 335 nm [weak], 470 nm [medium] and 670 nm [strong]) differently from spherical particles, and hence have a different color. This difference provides the basis for multiplexed assays in which the nanoparticle labels are all made from exactly the same material but rely on differences in shape to achieve unique optical signals [48] . There is a burgeoning interest in the control of particle shape and prisms, plates, rods, disks, hexagons, multipods, cubes, arrows, teardrops, tetrapods and branched-tetrapods made from a variety of materials (e.g., gold or silver) [49] [50] [51] [52] [53] [54] [55] . Differently shaped particles interact with light in different ways. For example, nanoprisms Rayleigh light scatter in the red range whereas comparably dimensioned spheres scatter in the blue. The prospect for different shaped labels has been explored in a preliminary way in immunoassays, but their potential in molecular diagnostics is uncharted.",

Most clinically available genetic tests only test for single sites of genetic polymorphism. If multiple sites of interest are tested, these sites are each in isolation; there is no easy way to determine if the multiple sites of interest are located on the same chromosome. Short of sequencing long expanses of DNA or indirectly calculating gene assortment by linkage analysis, there has been no previous method for directly determining the assortment of genetic variation on the same chromosome. In a study utilizing the resolution of SWNT probe tips, two polymorphisms were specifically localized to the same strand of DNA. In brief, the two polymorphisms were hybridized with complementary oligonucleotides linked to markers of differing size. When the AFM directly imaged the presence of the two markers of differing size on the same strand of DNA, this was evidence that the two polymorphisms of interest were linked together on the same chromosome.

Bao and his colleagues managed to interrogate SNPs for three genes involved in thrombotic disorders without genome complexity reduction by using allele-specific barcodes for either mutant or wild-type SNPs using 50 fmol of genomic DNA [64] .",

            "text": "Quantitative and qualitative analysis of extracted genomic DNA also has been improved by the recent introduction of novel instrumentation for microscale samples, such as the NanoDrop \u00ae ND-1000 [105] , an ultraviolet-based spectrophotometer that functions as a full-spectrum spectrophotometer over the range of 220 to 750 nm. A 0.2-mm path capability allows the ND-1000 to measure absorbance 50-times greater than that of conventional instruments. It enables highly accurate analyses of extremely small samples (1 \u00b5l) with remarkable reproducibility. A proprietary sample-retention system eliminates the need for cuvettes and capillaries, which decreases the measurement cycle time. In addition, the instrument software facilitates the measurement of DNA concentration and dye-labeling effectiveness. The instrument can measure the absorbance of fluorescent dyes, thereby allowing detection at dye concentrations as low as 0.2 pmol/\u00b5l. The next step after sample preparation in a genetic test is usually PCR to amplify the target. This reaction has become central to most, if not all, genetic testing. Miniaturization of PCR and the development of PCR chips has been a goal since it is a route to rapid PCR that uses less reagent, and it could form part of an integrated miniature genetic testing device. Numerous strategies for miniaturized PCR have been developed that differ in the geometry of the PCR device (e.g., chambers and channels), fabrication material (e.g., glass, silicon-glass or plastic) and the mode of heating/cooling (e.g., external Peltier heater/cooler or thin-film surface heater) [67] . One key issue that has arisen is the adverse effect of the surface of microchip devices on PCR, and this has necessitated development of passivation procedures to eliminate surface-based inhibition of PCR [68] . The goal of integration of the different steps in a genetic test onto a microchip has been achieved by a number of groups. Scientists at Motorola have described a self-contained, fully integrated device for sample preparation, PCR and DNA microarray detection [69] . The 60 \u00d7 100 \u00d7 2-mm device was used to test for the pathogenic bacterium Escherichia coli K12 in blood. On-chip magnetic beads captured bacteria from the blood and thermal cell lysis released DNA for amplification. PCR product was then pumped to a detection chamber where sandwich hybridization occurred with an electroactive ferrocene detection probe and capture probes immobilized on an electrode array (an eSensor chip). The same device was also successfully adapted for a hemochromatosis-associated SNP assay. Other microchip assay devices have integrated PCR and detection of PCR product by DNA probes immobilized on electrodes patterned on the inside surface of the 8-\u00b5l volume, silicon-glass PCR chamber [70] . Another analysis strategy has been to transfer PCR products to an adjacent electrophoretic chip [71] . An integrated system comprising of a silicon-glass PCR chamber and a glass electrophoresis chip has been used to amplify genomic DNA and analyze the PCR product. An on-chip aluminum heater/temperature sensor achieved 16-s PCR cycles, and product was transferred by pressure to the glass electrophoresis channel filled with a hydroxypropylmethylcellulose sieving solution for a 180-s analysis step.",

However, commercialization of these devices is proceeding slowly. A notable exception is the Cepheid GeneXpert \u00ae module for DNA detection [107] . This automated real-time device provides fully integrated cartridge-based sample preparation with PCR amplification in a microchamber and detection, and delivers results from unprocessed sample in less than 30 min. A version of this module that identifies the presence of anthrax from air samples had been installed in US Postal Services sorting centers nationwide. This, together with the success of the microchip CE analyzers, should provide the necessary impetus for investment in the commercialization of more types of microchip analyzers in the future.",

Microtechnology has many beneficial attributes that recommend it for use in the clinical laboratory. Integration of the individual steps in multistep genetic tests into a single easy-to-use microchip device is one of the most appealing advantages. However, microtechnology is complex and requires sophisticated manufacturing techniques, and the same is true for nanotechnology. Thus, the clinical laboratory must rely on the medical diagnostics industry to commercialize microchip-based assays and analyzers. Until now, most microchip companies have focused on the needs of the pharmaceutical industry in massively parallel assays for drug discovery. There are now signs that finally, the potential of microtechnology in medical diagnostics is being seriously evaluated, and the first steps are being taken in the development of diagnostic microchip-based products.",

By 2010, there should be a firm conclusion on the viability of nucleic acid assays based on microchip technology. Most, if not all, of the proof-of-principle microchip experiments have been completed, and the FDA approval of the AmpliChip Cytochrome P450 Genotyping Test, provides a basis for optimism for further expansion of microarray-based genetic tests. Some other factors also must be considered. The current range of routine genetic tests is limited and just a fraction of what might eventually be possible or needed as the genome yields its secrets. However, the full implementation of a wider range of genetic testing services will require appropriate coverage of such testing and reimbursement to a level appropriate for the cost of performing this testing in a clinical laboratory. Generally, reimbursement and the American Medical Association Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes have not kept up with genetic testing, and much of the billing is based instead on the generic molecular diagnostic codes, 83890-83912, from the Pathology and Laboratory Chemistry subsection of the CPT [95, 96] .",
