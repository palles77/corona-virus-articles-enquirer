The epidemiological determinants of spread of SARS can be dealt with as the probabilistic growth curve models, and the parameter estimation procedure for the probabilistic growth curve models may similarly be treated as the lifetime analysis. Thus, we try to do the parameter estimation to the SARS cases for the infected cases, fatal cases, and cured cases here, as we usually do it in the lifetime analysis. Using the truncated data models to the infected and fatal cases with some censoring time, we may estimate the total (or final) numbers of the patients and deaths, and the case fatality ratio may be estimated by these two numbers. We may also estimate the case fatality ratio using the numbers of the patients and recoveries, but this estimate differs from that using the numbers of the patients and deaths, especially when the censoring time is located at early stages.",

The estimate of the case fatality ratio and its confidence interval are easily obtained in a numerical sense. This paper mainly treats the case in Hong Kong. The estimated epidemiological determinants of spread of SARS, fitted to the infected, fatal, and cured cases in Hong Kong, could be the logistic distribution function among the logistic, log-normal, gamma, and Weibull models. Using the proposed method, it would be appropriate that the SARS case fatality ratio is roughly estimated to be 17% in Hong Kong. Worldwide, it is roughly estimated to be about 12-18%, if we consider the safety side without the Chinese case. Unlike the questionably small confidence intervals for the case fatality ratio using the truncated models, the case fatality ratio in the proposed model provides a reasonable confidence interval.",

During almost a month from 21 February the SARS virus spread without isolation of probable patients. Taking into account of the short incubation period which is estimated as 5-8 days (see [23] ), it appears that the virus raged for more than a month without prevention. The number of probable patients appeared to grow exponentially in this period, and then the control of the human-to-human chain of transmission of the disease suppressed the growth rate of spreading. It may be considered that only one seed made a typical epidemic growth curve of the disease spread. Our concern is first what the appropriate probability distribution for the curve is; the logistic, the log-normal, the gamma, or the Weibull distribution may be fitted to the data provided by WHO [37] .",

Since WHO opens the numbers of probable cases and the fatal cases to the public day by day, we can estimate the CFR by some censoring time T using the conditional likelihoods for both the probable and fatal cases; this approach is considered to be the truncated model approach. However, WHO, in addition to these two data cases, gave us the recovery (or cured) cases, which would be the fruitful information for the parameter estimation of the underlying probability distributions; we can also estimate the CFR using the probable and cured cases. We propose here a new estimation method for the parameters of the underlying distributions and the CFR using the three data sets of probable, fatal, and cured cases together. The trunsored model approach (Hirose [16, 18] ) can do this, but the traditional truncated model approach cannot.",

In such cases, r events within T are observed from n samples, but the ratio, p m , of the long-term survivors to the mixed populations is unknown. If n is unknown, the truncated model (e.g. Johnson et al. [22] , Meeker and Escobar [29] , Wallace et al. [36] , and Klein and Moeschberger [24] ) could be applied.

If the censoring time is set to the right far enough, e.g. on 11 July 2003, however, the estimated number of patients,m 1 = 1755.71, and the estimated number of deaths,m 2 = 298.66, become very close to the observed numbers of patients, 1755, and deaths, 298, by that time; in other resampling cases, the results are much the same. Then, the 95% confidence interval for the CFR is computed as 16.90% \u2264 p f \u2264 17.09%. Such very small confidence intervals are also reported elsewhere [6] . After the outbreaks are completely ceased, e.g. based on data as of the 31 Assuming that the CFR of SARS is supposed to be some constant value, then the number of deaths would be varied by chance. The CFRs in various districts could be fluctuated, but they would be covered by some interval, say [0.1, 0.2]. This is the reason why I think that the very small confidence intervals obtained by using the truncated model are paradoxical.",

World-wide, the CFR of about 9.6% (including Chinese cases) has been announced by media. However, this estimate should be treated cautiously; this is caused mainly by the Chinese CFR, and this value, about 6.6%, is very different from those in other countries. There would be reasons for such a very different value of the CFR. One reason would be that Chinese infected cases were counted circumspectly. However, a noticeable reference is also seen (see [5] ), in which Chinese medicine is found to improve the case survival rate in the treatment of SARS. In any case, it would be appropriate that the SARS CFR is estimated without the Chinese case if we consider the safety side. In such a case, it is roughly estimated to be about 12-18%, worldwide.",

The estimated epidemiological determinants of spread of SARS, fitted to the infected, fatal, and cured cases, can be modeled by the generalized logistic distribution function. The truncated data model approach using the infected and fatal cases can estimate the case fatality ratio of the disease, but it also estimates the case fatality ratio using the numbers of the patients and recoveries; these estimates differ from each other in early censoring time stage. To circumvent this inconsistency, and to obtain reasonable estimates, the mixed trunsored model, which is an extension of the censored and truncated unified model, is found to be useful in estimating the case fatality ratio of SARS, when we use the data of the patients, deaths, and recoveries together. Using the proposed method, it would be appropriate that the SARS case fatality ratio is roughly estimated to be about 12-18% worldwide, if we consider the safety side without the Chinese case. Unlike the questionably small confidence intervals for the case fatality ratio using the truncated models, the case fatality ratio in the proposed model provides a reasonable confidence interval.",
