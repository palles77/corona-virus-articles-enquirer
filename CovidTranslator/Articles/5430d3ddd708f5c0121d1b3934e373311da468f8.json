Although SARS was a natural biologic pandemic, it tested the global medical community's ability to recognize and rapidly respond to a potential covert biologic weapon attack. Dispersion of a previously unknown biologic agent produced illness after a relatively short incubation period, when victims had already dispersed to five continents. Effective medical response depended upon the ability of astute clinicians, not sophisticated electronic surveillance, to identify the case cluster announcing the presence of a new illness.",

SARS-CoV, a novel Coronavirus species, produces a rapidly progressive atypical pneumonia. Coronaviruses are a family of enveloped, singlestranded RNA viruses that produce disease in several animal species, including humans. Seroepidemiologic data suggest that SARS-CoV originated as an animal virus, with live game animal markets hypothesized to be the potential site of recent interspecies transmission. [1] [2] [3] Isolation of SARS-CoV from several species, including the palm civet (Paguma larvata), suggests a wide range of host hiding places for SARS between human epidemics. SARS-CoV is the cause of SARS, as it satisfied all four of Koch's postulates. Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and virus isolation demonstrated virus from lung biopsy specimens, feces, urine, and respiratory secretions in SARS patients, but not controls. Seroconversion to SARS-CoV was shown in ill patients. Experimental cynomolgus macaque infection with SARS-CoV produced pneumonia pathologically similar to SARS in humans.

It shows moderate transmission, with two to four secondary cases, and occasional \"super-spreader\" events, involving transmission to multiple individuals.

SARS-CoV has an incubation period of 2 to 10 days (median 4-7 days; range 2-14 days).

            "text": "The primary mode of transmission is via direct or indirect mucous membrane contact with infectious respiratory droplets or fomites. 10 Fecal-oral transmission may be an important secondary means, as virus is found in large quantities in stool and profuse, watery diarrhea is not uncommon. 5,11,12 Transmission is not described before clinical illness onset,which corresponds with peak viral load at day 12 to 14 of symptoms. As such, early patient isolation may facilitate transmission prevention. 11 Transmission occurs with close patient contact, with passage to casual contacts being unusual. Transmission is facilitated by aerosol-generating procedures in medical settings. Seasonality is suspected but remains to be elucidated. SARS affects individuals of all age groups and immune status, although children appeared less severely affected in the 2003 epidemic. Infected individuals initially experience fever, myalgias, and chills. Cough is common early, but tachypnea and shortness of breath are more prominent later in the illness. The elderly may not present with fever but may manifest decreased appetite and malaise. 13 Upper respiratory symptoms are uncommon, perhaps serving as one clinical clue differentiating a cluster of epidemiologically linked SARS patients from those with other atypical pneumonias. Pulmonary findings, such as rales, occurred in less than one third of SARS cases, and often did not correlate clinically with chest radiography (CXR) findings. 7,14 Twenty percent of patients had prominent gastrointestinal symptoms, including watery diarrhea. CXR findings appear to correlate with the rapidity at which patients require hospitalization. The most common initial findings on CXR are ground-glass opacifications or focal consolidations of the peripheral, subpleural lower lung fields. In 67% of patients with an initially normal CXR, findings appear on subsequent high-resolution chest tomography (HRCT). Pleural effusions, mediastinal lymphadenopathy, and cavitation are rare. 16 One third of SARs patients showed improvement, with defervescence and radiographic resolution over several weeks. In the remainder, fever persisted and progressive shortness of breath, hypoxia, tachypnea, increasing auscultative findings, and often diarrhea were noted. Serial radiography, or HDCT, revealed progression to multifocal unilateral or bilateral air-space consolidation, and often non-iatrogenic pneumomediastinum. Approximately 20% to 30% of patients require intensive care. Death is usually due to respiratory failure and/or multiple organ failure, sepsis, or accompanying cardiac decompensation. Later lung findings include diffuse alveolar damage, edema, hyaline membrane formation, pneumocyte desquamation, giant cells, a high viral load, and an inflammatory infiltrate. 6, 14, 17 Mortality risk factors, determined by multivariate regression analysis, include advanced age, co-morbid cardiovascular disease and diabetes, and high neutrophil and lactate dehydrogenase levels on presentation. 17, 18 Between 6% and 20% of recovered patients have some residual respiratory impairment. 3 Clinical manifestations are nonspecific. In one study, the WHO case definition was shown to be 96% specific but only 26% sensitive. 3 Laboratory data are nondiagnostic; however, lymphocytopenia is common and thrombocytopenia may be noted. Alanine aminotransferase, lactate dehydrogenase, and creatine kinase levels may be elevated. Although RT-PCR has been shown to be diagnostic in respiratory and fecal specimens, and viral RNA is detectable in serum and urine, the CDC and WHO do not deem RT-PCR currently reliable to rule out SARS infection. 19 Lower respiratory tract specimens are the most useful but place healthcare providers at the most risk of transmission via aerosol generation. 20 Seroconversion 21 to 28 days after symptom onset (wholevirus immunoassay via IFA or ELISA) remains the gold standard to confirm SARS infection. 21",

Its unique RNA-dependent RNA polymerase allows for mutation and adaptation to adverse conditions. SARS-CoV release into a community could produce a large number of casualties in a relatively short period and allow widespread dispersion of infected individuals before symptoms manifest. Potential disadvantages of SARS-CoV use include the lack of transmission before clinical illness onset, suggesting that early patient isolation may facilitate transmission prevention and its apparent uncommon transmission to casual contacts. An aerosolized SARS-CoV attack would most likely occur in a large urban setting transportation hub, allowing significant spread over large population areas globally. Identification of SARS-CoV as the cause, without the obvious epidemiologic clue of an outbreak in another country, would be delayed because of its clinical similarity to other atypical pneumonias during respiratory virus season.",
