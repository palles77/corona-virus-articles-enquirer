Typical virtual screening (VS) methods involve, for example, filtering of libraries for compounds containing toxic, reactive, or otherwise undesirable groups, or, by contrast, the search for molecules with preferred lead-or drug-like properties and desired activity [5] . In fact, VS is emerging as a key strategy to help filter out those compounds with poor potency, and biological or pharmacological properties [6] [7] [8] . Recent reviews suggest that while VS is often presented as an alternative to PS, both strategies are highly complementary [5, 9] .",

The last column indicates the original references. Table 1 reveals the VS workflow used in most of the studies: (i) preliminary filtering of a virtual library (tens to hundreds of thousands of compounds) using various criteria (e.g. Lipinski's rule of five); (ii) homology and pharmacophore modeling; combined with (iii) docking and scoring of the protein-ligand complexes. For PS methods, assays that are particular to each specific target were applied, most of them being based on fluorescence detection. The outcome of these studies indicates that preliminary VS not only drastically reduces the number of chemicals that are physically screened, but also increases the hit rates.",

Knowing the structure of the biological target macromolecule offers many advantages in comparison with the situation where only information about the geometry of a bioactive (reference) ligand is available. When structural information about the target is available from either fact or inference, we consider this target-based, or structure-based, virtual screening (TBVS). All other cases represent ligand-based virtual screening (LBVS), where the reference compound(s) are known substrates, inhibitors, agonists or antagonists, among others. An important issue in target selection is the druggability of the molecule under consideration, and whether the target is amenable to therapeutic intervention via small molecules. One approach is to assess whether members from the same gene family show similar binding affinity towards drug-like ligands with related physicochemical properties [16] ; the other approach is sometimes referred as 'target fishing' (see J. L. Jenkins, this issue).",

Our Center (New Mexico Molecular Libraries Screening Center: http://screening.health.unm.edu/) has undertaken projects on several classes of receptors, which include two GPCRs listed in Table 1 and an integrin, LFA-1. For the formyl peptide receptor, we compared several strategies including screening of class-focused (GPCR) and target-focused (FPR) libraries (Table 2 ). In the latter case, we used a homology model with pharmacophore docking to select a compound library [18] . We recorded active molecules at the rate of 1/880 from the Prestwick Chemical Library (http://www.prestwickchemical.com/chem_lib.htm), 17/9993 in a diverse set from the NIH Small Molecule Repository (http://mlsmr.glpg.com/ MLSMR_HomePage/), 12/4959 in a GPCR class focused library from ChemDiv (http://www.chemdiv.com/en/products/screening/), and 30/4324 in a target focused library [18] .",

However, if VS technologies can reduce the library size to 10's or 100's of compounds, many of these constraints are lifted allowing the use of more physiologically relevant or complex assays, potentially including whole animal-based assays, which are recognized as a viable alternative in today's search for novel pharmaceuticals. Another issue related to assay implementation is the selection of in vitro vs. in vivo assays. Many of the initial hits in enzyme/protein-based in vitro assays may fail at the cellular or animal level due to stability or metabolism issues. However, with the development of VS and post-HTS analysis methods, this can be minimized. Finally, assay selection has a strong influence on the outcome of the physical screen. For example, the use of a simple binding assay screen can yield both agonists and antagonists of target activity. If only agonists are desired, a functional assay based on target activity might be preferentially selected.",
