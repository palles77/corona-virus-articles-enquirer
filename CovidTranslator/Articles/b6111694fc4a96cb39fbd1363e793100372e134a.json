            "text": "Pharyngitis; Adult; Diagnosis; Treatment; Streptococcus pyogenes; Antibiotics Abstract Acute pharyngitis in adults is one of the most common infectious diseases seen in general practitioners' consultations. Viral aetiology is the most common. Among bacterial causes, the main agent is Streptococcus pyogenes or group A \u2424-haemolytic streptococcus (GABHS), which causes 5%---30% of the episodes. In the diagnostic process, clinical assessment scales can help clinicians to better predict suspected bacterial aetiology by selecting patients who should undergo a rapid antigen detection test. If these techniques are not performed, an overdiagnosis of streptococcal pharyngitis often occurs, resulting in unnecessary prescriptions of antibiotics, most of which are broad spectrum. Consequently, management algorithms that include the use of predictive clinical rules and rapid tests have been set up. The aim of the treatment is speeding up symptom resolution, reducing the contagious time span and preventing local suppurative Introduction Acute pharyngitis (AP) in adults is one of the most common respiratory infections in our environment. AP results in a significant amount of sickness absence from work, each episode resulting in up to an average of 6.5 days' sick leave. 1, 2 It is also one of the most common reasons for prescribing antibiotics in our country, with an approximate prescription rate of 80%. However, the most frequent bacterial agent, Streptococcus pyogenes or group A beta-haemolytic streptococcus (GABHS), is responsible for 20%---30% of all cases of pharyngitis in children and 5%---15% in adults. 2, 3 Establishing a suspected differential aetiological diagnosis on which to base the most appropriate treatment is one of the main problems which AP poses for primary care physicians. Antibiotics are in general overprescribed for AP, as most of its causes are viral. The excessive use of antibiotics results in possible side effects for the patient, resistance selection and the consequent increase in health expenditure. 4---7 In normal practice, a diagnosis is made based on clinical criteria (fever, tonsillar exudate, anterior cervical lymphadenopathy and no cough), which are of low sensitivity in predicting GABHS (49%---74%), and therefore the indication for the prescription of antibiotics increases as there are a great many false positives. 8 The benchmark test for a diagnosis of AP is tonsillar exudate culture, which has very high sensitivity and specificity (90%---95% and >95%, respectively). 9 The time period necessary for reading the culture is its main limitation for regular diagnostic use. For this reason, rapid, easy-to-use, low-cost immunological techniques have been developed which can detect the streptococcal antigen in a few minutes. 10 Most of these tests currently have high specificity (>95%), but their sensitivity is approximately 80%, with a range between 60% and 98%, although it varies according to the commercial brand and the patients' signs and symptoms. 11 In terms of treatment, GABHS continues to be 100% sensitive to penicillin and should remain the treatment of choice. 12 Aetiology Several viruses and bacteria can cause AP in immunocompetent patients. Adenoviruses are the most common.",

Other bacteria involved in AP in our environment are Streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis (\u2424-haemolytic group C and G streptococci). More rarely, AP can be caused by Fusobacterium necrophorum, Borrelia vincentii, Arcanobacterium haemolyticum, Neisseria gonorrhoeae (in adolescents and adults who practice oral-genital sex), Mycoplasma pneumoniae (which also causes acute bronchitis or upper respiratory infection) and Chlamydophila pneumoniae. 13, 14 To date, the streptococci which cause AP remain sensitive to penicillin and other \u2424-lactam antibiotics, despite their massive use. No strain which is resistant to penicillin has been described, and penicillin G minimum inhibitory concentrations have not varied significantly for the past 90 years. Macrolides and lincosamides (clindamycin) are considered the treatment of choice in patients who are allergic, or suspected to be allergic, to \u2424-lactam antibiotics. In recent years, resistance to these groups has increased in different parts of the world, including Spain. However, this problem does not affect everybody in the same way; while 14-atom macrolides (erythromycin, clarithromycin) and 15atom macrolides (azithromycin) present resistance rates of 10%---30%, those of 16 atoms (midecamycin, josamycin) and lincosamides remain below 7% resistance. 15 The prevalence of resistance to macrolides and lincosamides should be known and updated in each area so that alternatives to penicillin can be made available.",

However, these studies have not managed to determine whether this increase was more frequent in the untreated group than in the treated group. 21--- 23 Petersen et al. 24 described that with the use of antibiotics the risk of suppurative complications during the first month after diagnosis decreased significantly, the number needed to treat to prevent one serious complication being over 4000. Little et al. 25 prospectively analysed the predictive factors of suppurative complications after AP. Complications included tonsillitis, peritonsillar abscess, otitis media, sinusitis, impetigo, and the need for a further consultation as a result of unresolved symptoms during the month following diagnosis. Suppurative complications were present in 1.3% of patients, irrespective of whether they had been treated with antibiotics immediately, by delayed prescription, or not treated at all.

The highest percentages are found in studies performed on children aged between 5 and 14, and the lowest in people over the age of 15. Therefore, the use of these scales is not sufficient to establish precisely whether or not the patient presents an AP caused by GABHS. In fact, sensitivity of clinical judgement varies between 29% and 74%, and specificity between 58% and 76%. 8 Furthermore, we as primary care physicians, assess the different Centor criteria differently; thus, in Spain, doctors attach much more importance to pharyngotonsillar exudate in an AP, since we prescribe antibiotics 28 times more if this sign is present, than to the other 3 criteria (fewer than 5 times more if these criteria are present). 29",

However, it is very probable that aetiology due to anaerobic infections has been underestimated to date, since strict anaerobic culture conditions are required to identify them, which few microbiology laboratories possess. Rapid antigen detection tests for GABHS (Strep A) were developed in the eighties in samples taken with swabs. These techniques presented the advantage that the result was available during the consultation. They are based on extracting the carbohydrate antigen from the GABHS from the microorganisms obtained from pharyngeal exudates. They are easy to apply in the surgery; the sample should be taken using a tongue depressor, keeping the tongue immobilised, taking the sample from the tonsil and posterior pharynx area, and from any inflamed or ulcerated area. It is essential to avoid the swab being rubbed by the uvula, oral mucosa, lips or tongue, before and after taking the sample. 30 The swab samples are deposited in cuvettes to which a reagent is added which contains anti-streptococcal antibodies.",

Another aspect to be considered is that Strep A positivity does not distinguish acute carrier state infection, neither does the culture. The percentage of asymptomatic carriers can be up to 20%, but its prevalence in adults does not reach 5%. 31 It has been observed that doctors who use rapid antigen detection tests prescribe fewer antibiotics for AP than those who do not use them. 32 However, although the negative predictive value is very high, a recent clinical study showed that Spanish doctors prescribed antibiotics for little more than 30% of cases with negative Strep A. 30 This could be due to the custom of systematically prescribing antibiotics for patients presenting with at least 2 Centor criteria.",

Antibiotic treatment of group C streptococcus AP might be associated with a slightly shorter duration of symptoms, but only in adults (one day). 39 It has also been proved that group C streptococcus can cause glomerulonephritis and can also cause cases of acute rheumatic fever. There are more questions regarding the benefit of antibiotic treatment in AP caused by group C streptococcus. Another cause which has merited a lot of attention in recent years, is infection by F. necrophorum. However there is no certainty as to whether therapy with antibiotics can reduce the duration of the symptoms of AP caused by this anaerobic bacterium. As we mentioned earlier, the need to treat the aetiology from Streptococci of the anginosus group is not clear either. 19 ",

Flurbiprofen, a local action anti-inflammatory, has been demonstrated to be more effective than a placebo in the relief of sore throat. 42, 43 In this regard, the use of local action anti-inflammatories could be an alternative in the treatment of sore throat symptoms without a high fever. The evidence for the benefit of phytotherapy and acupuncture in AP is inconsistent. 14 There are further doubts about the benefit of oral corticosteroids. In a review of 8 placebocontrolled clinical trials, which included 743 patients, it was observed that a short course of oral or intramuscular corticosteroids was more beneficial than the placebo in relieving pain in AP. This benefit was greater for adult patients, those with greater symptomatology and those with streptococcal AP.

Clinical evaluation scales which enable the selection of patients for a rapid diagnostic test are helpful for aetiological diagnosis. 4. Rapid diagnostic tests should be used according to certain criteria, not for all AP. 5. The Strep A test is recommended when the patient presents 2 or more criteria on the Centor scale. 6. The antibiotic of choice for treatment of streptococcal AP is penicillin V, Phenoxymethylpenicillin. 7. The effectiveness of penicillin is proven and no case of resistant GABHS has been described to date.
