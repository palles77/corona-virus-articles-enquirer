This study examines one source of growth patterns in asset prices by analyzing the integration relationship between stock markets and real estate markets in Asia. Six economies are selected for empirical analysis: China, Hong Kong, Japan, Singapore, South Korea, and Taiwan. Results show that stock markets are integrated with real estate markets in Japan, and partially integrated with real estate markets in China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan. This implies that these two investment vehicles are substitutable in China, Hong Kong, Japan, and Taiwan, and provide diversification potential for investment portfolios in South Korea and Singapore. Examining the timing of market changes, we found the real estate market leading the stock market in some countries, and the stock market leading the real estate market in others. We conclude that stock and real estate markets show a variety of inter-relationships depending on economic and political policy environments.",

The liquidity and the relationship of these two assets have often attracted the attention of both homebuyers and investors. Stock is the most convenient form of investment for many. It offers relatively high liquidity and transparency of transaction information compared with other investment vehicles. For most households, however, real estate is probably the most important and expensive asset to obtain. In Asia real estate is especially preferred, due to traditional values and to the region's high population density.",

            "text": "Stock and real estate values are also influenced strongly by economic conditions (e.g., economic growth, inflation, interest rates, employment, financial crisis, and so on). For example, the 2008 subprime mortgage crisis that began in the U.S. had a significant negative impact on both stock and real estate prices in the six markets surveyed, as shown in Figs. 1 and 2. However, the differential effects of these conditions on these assets have repeatedly drawn the attention of investors, households, and scholars. On the one hand, if there is an integrated relationship between markets for these two assets, this implies that they are substitutable or interchangeable. Investors may be able to predict one market through observing the other's performance. On the other hand, the stock market may also react independently of real estate market due to various market conditions or government intervention, including distortions in supply or demand, taxation, supply or price control, data quality, or other transaction costs. If these two markets are segmented, investors can diversify their portfolios by holding both types of assets simultaneously. Numerous studies have explored the relationship between the stock market and the real estate market in the U.S., but results have been inconsistent, perhaps due to differences in sampling areas, sampling periods, data quality, or economic environments (Ambrose, Ancel and Griffiths, 1992; Chaudhry, Myer, and Webb, 1999; Fraser, Leishman, and Tarbert, 2002; Liow and Yang, 2005; Ling and Naranjo, 1999; Liu et al., 1990; Okunev and Wilson, 1997; Wilson, Okunev, and Ta, 1996; Wilson and Okunev, 1999) . Now that the emerging Asian stock and real estate markets have attracted worldwide attention, trends in the region are extensive enough to merit the same attention previously reserved for the developed economy of the U.S. This study is a preliminary examination of the relationship between Asian stock markets and real estate markets. It examines six Asian economies and the relationship between their stock and real estate markets. This is a timely subject for several reasons. First, stock and real estate markets in Asia are growing with Asian economies, especially compared with markets in most of the developed countries like the United States and most of Europe. Therefore, the relationship between these two markets is worth examining. Second, most research on stock and real estate markets in the past focused on western countries. Studies or comparative research on the Asian region are rare. This study fills this gap. Finally, with the development of the economy in the Asian regions, the growth of stock markets and real estate markets has attracted significant interest from global investors. Therefore, we attempt to discover any relationships and examine what similarities the Asian region shares with other countries. Data for this study comes from six Asian economies: China, Hong Kong, Japan, Singapore, South Korea, and Taiwan. The cointegration test proposed by Johansen (1988) and Johansen and Juselius (1990) is used to examine the relationship between stock markets and real estate markets in these economies from March 1995 to June 2010. If the null hypothesis of no cointegration is rejected, it indicates that these two markets can reach equilibrium in the long run, and implies that the stock market is integrated with the real estate market in these economies. Therefore, we can conclude that these two assets are good substitutes in investment allocation. Conversely, if the null hypothesis of no cointegration is accepted, segmentation between the stock market and the real estate market exists, and these two assets can be held in a portfolio for diversification purpose. If these markets show no cointegration, it is still possible that that there is nonlinear (or fractional) cointegration relationship between the two markets. We therefore employ the model proposed by Okunev and Wilson (1997) to examine possible fractional integration relationships. Finally, we study possible causal relationships between stock markets and real estate markets. This paper is organized as follows: Section 2 discusses and reviews theories and literature related to this study. Section 3 describes the data and methodology used. Section 4 presents the empirical results obtained. Section 5 presents the study's conclusions.",

No additional premium is associated with any of the market. Investors therefore earn the same risk-adjusted return on stock and real estate. \"Segmentation\" arises if the only risk priced for real estate is systematic risk relative to the real estate market. Investors thus do not necessarily earn the same expected return on real estate and stocks. Once the integration relationship is found between two investment vehicles, the two assets are substitutable (Liow and Yang, 2005) .

            "text": "Factors causing the integration or segmentation of assets are also worth exploring. Explanations for the integration relationship can be illustrated by some economic rationales (e.g., the \"substitution effect\", the \"flight to quality\", the \"wealth effect\", business cycle factors, and so on). The \"substitution effect\" occurs when the price of one investment vehicle is too high to make a profit and the investor searches for alternative assets. The alternatives may or may not be as efficient as the original vehicle, but the investor believes they will provide more profit than the original asset. In a similar vein, the \"flight to quality\" phenomenon stimulates investors to switch investment vehicles or move funds to pursue high return or risk aversion (Kim, Moshirian, and Wu, 2006; Bernanke, Gertler, and Gilchrist, 1996) . The \"wealth effect\" implies the causal effect of exogenous changes in wealth upon consumption behavior (Case, Quigley, and Shiller, 2001) . As investors sense an increase in wealth, investments in various assets might simultaneously increase. Quan and Titman (1999) found that the correlation between the returns of stock and real estate will increase if \"business cycle\" variables simultaneously affect corporate profits and rents. Moreover, stock and real estate prices will also move together if expectations (either rational or irrational) of future profits and rents move together. These results suggest that a large fraction of the observed positive correlation is due to economic fundamentals that affect both stock and real estate prices.",

Their results showed that the stock market is segmented from the real estate market when \"appraisal-based\" return analysis is used. However, they also obtained a contradictory result, that the stock market and the real estate market are integrated, if equity REIT returns are employed for testing. Ambrose, Ancel, and Griffiths (1992) , Wilson, Okunev, and Ta (1996) , Okunev and Wilson (1997) , Chaudhry, Myer, and Webb (1999) , and Fraser, Leishman, and Tarbert (2002) conducted similar studies but drew differing conclusions. Ambrose, Ancel, and Griffiths (1992) used rescaled range analysis, developed in the fractal geometry, to re-examine the segmentation relationship between the stock and real estate markets. Contrary to Liu et al. (1990) , they found that segmentation does not exist between these two markets. Okunev and Wilson (1997) provided yet another perspective on the relationship between stock and real estate markets. They argued that the integration between these two markets may not be linear. Thus, they proposed a nonlinear integration framework to test the relationship between the two markets. The nonlinear test supported their view that the markets are fractionally integrated.

Ling and Naranjo (1999) employed the multifactor model to explore the integration relationship between the US commercial real estate market (both exchange-traded and non-exchange-traded) and the stock market. They found that the market for traded real estate companies, including REITs, is integrated with the stock market. However, they also found that, consistent with the results of Liu et al. (1990) , the \"appraisalbased\" real estate returns failed to integrate with the stock market returns, which may indicate that it is not an accurate proxy for commercial real estate returns. Wilson and Okunev (1999) applied the technique of fractional co-integration to explore the relationship between stock and real estate markets in the United States, United Kingdom, and Australia from 1971 to 1993. They found that there was no long-run relationship between the stock and real estate markets in these countries. They further argued that the stock crash of 1987 might have incurred the structural change, and they chose that as a breaking point of the structural change and re-examined the issue. They found that there was a cointegration relationship between the stock and real estate markets in the United States from 1971 to 1987 and in the United Kingdom from 1988 to 1993. Quan and Titman (1999) examined stock and real estate markets in seventeen countries and found that the relationship between real estate and stock returns is not statistically significant, except in Japan.",

They found evidence of co-integration among these markets. These results implied that investors could take advantage of market inefficiency to engage in arbitrage activities. Liow and Li (2006) investigated whether real estate company stock prices deviate from their net asset values (NAVs) which represent the underlying value of real estate assets in Asian-Pacific securitized real estate markets. They took the difference between stock prices and NAVs and divided it by NAV to measure the extent of discounts or premiums of real estate stocks (NAVDISC).

An alternative approach to overcome this shortcoming is to use the index of different regions or cities for further concise conclusions. Second, China's population of over 1.2 billion are all looking for homes after the end of the public ownership system prevailing during the early Communist era. Real state market trends and their relationship with other markets before there is equilibrium between supply and demand is difficult to determine.

In contrast, Hong Kong's real estate market was much more intensely influenced by the political transition in 1997. Emigration and loss of confidence in real estate did not reverse as quickly as recovery in the stock market. 5.5.2.3. Japan. Japan is the most developed economy in Asia; it therefore has a special role as a regional leader. Rapid economic growth from the 1970s to the 1980s in Japan caused the Japanese Yen to appreciate significantly. This appreciation rose sharply in the late 1980s, from an exchange rate of 242 yen to one US dollar in 1985, to 128 yen to the dollar in 1988. Export industries were severely injured by appreciation. To stimulate investment in the hope of continuing economic growth, the government reduced interest rates from 5% to 2.5% in 1986, causing a boom in the stock and real estate markets.",

The Granger test showed no causality relationship between the stock and real estate markets from March 1995 to June 2010 in Japan. From Figs. 1(c) and 2(c), it is obvious that stock markets in Japan fluctuate with the overall economy. Yet the real estate market remained sluggish during the sample period. This may be due to the fact that maximum loan-to-value (LTV) ratio for real estate financing in Japan could reach 120% in the 1980s. The over-leveraging eventually led to a long-term recession in its real estate market. This may be one reason no causality relationship was found between the stock and real estate markets in Japan. 5.5.2.4. Singapore. Asset markets in Singapore were severely affected by the Asian financial crisis in 1997 and the government introduced several measures to stimulate economic growth. Limits on foreign investment were greatly reduced, and international companies were encouraged to go public in Singapore. These measures gradually attracted international investors, and stock and real estate markets revived. In 2000, the overall economy, including the asset markets, was again hit by falls in stock market values of information technology industry (\"dot com\"). Stock and real estate markets did not pick up until 2003, after the end of worldwide deflation [see Fig. 1 (d) and 2 (d)].",

Its economy was severely affected by the Asian financial crisis in 1997, with stock and real estate markets plunging to historic lows. The collapse of the global information technology industry in 2000 and rising default levels on credit card debt further affected the overall economy and asset markets in South Korea. Markets recovered afterwards with the global economy. The government launched a series of financial reforms with the assistance of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), but it was only in 2001 that the economy regained momentum and the stock and real estate markets began to recover.

First, there has been a housing shortage of approximately 7% (70,000 units) in Taipei city for the past decade. The traditional preference for real estate investment is driven by the housing shortage, high population density, and the employment opportunity. Second, metropolitan Taipei accounts for over 1/3 of the population in Taiwan, and the value of the real estate in Taipei represent a significant proportion of the entire country. The combination of these factors encouraged the escalation of housing prices in Taipei, leading to an annual average 10% appreciation for the past decade.
