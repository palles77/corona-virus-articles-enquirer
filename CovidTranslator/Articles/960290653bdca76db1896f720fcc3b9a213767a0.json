            "text": "Mut index 3, day 5 n = 13 S113N + D265V S113N I187T I187T + D265V D265V WT Due to read length limitations of Illumina sequencing, we were unable to determine whether HA mutations S113N and D265V were linked using our haplotype analysis. To determine whether these two mutations were encoded on the same HA molecules in infected animals, we cloned and sequenced full length HA from HA190D225D index and contact 3, and from the Mut index animals on day 5. The fraction of clones containing each mutation combination are shown as different colors within the pie chart and the number of clones sequenced is displayed below each. (a) On day 5 in HA190D225D index animal 3, we acquired 20 HA clones, of which 5/20 (25%) encoded only S113N, 5/20 (25%) encoded only D265V, 2/20 (10%) encoded both S113N and D265V together, and the remaining 8/20 (40%) contained neither mutation (WT). (b) On day 5 in HA190D225D contact animal 3, we sequenced 32 clones, of which 25/32 (78.125%) encoded S113N alone, 4/32 (12.5%) encoded D265V alone, 1/32 (3.125%) encoded both S113N and D265V together and 4/32 (6.25%) encoded neither mutation. (c) For day 5 in Mut index animal 1, we were only able to acquire 6 clones. 2/6 (33%) encoded S113N and D265V together, 2/6 (33%) encoded I187T and D265V together, and 2/6 (33%) encoded D265V alone. I187T and S113N were not detected in any of the 6 clones without D265V also present, although the small number of clones we were able to acquire may not fully capture the diversity present in the viral population at that timepoint. (d) For day 5 in Mut index animal 3, we sequenced 13 clones. 1/13 clones (7.69%) encoded both S113N and D265V, 5/13 (38.46%) encoded both D265V and I187T together, and 7/13 (53.85%) encoded D265V alone. Again, S113N and I187T were not found in any sequences that did not also contain D265V. This figure shows the same data as Fig. 5 , except that the \u03c0 statistic was calculated using PoPoolation software, rather than SNPGenie, and corrected for potential template resampling. (a) The first transmission event is characterized by a loose genetic bottleneck, in which a minor, and not statistically significant, reduction in both synonymous and nonsynonymous nucleotide diversity is observed across almost every gene segment. (b, c) After further adaptation, transmission in both Mut pairs is characterized by a selective sweep over the HA1 region of HA, resulting in a significant reduction in nucleotide diversity centered over HA1. In Mut pair 1 (b), nucleotide diversity is increased or only slightly decreased in all gene segments excluding HA after transmission. In Mut pair 3 (c), nucleotide diversity is reduced most strongly in HA but also across the other gene segments, suggesting the possible combination of a selective sweep and a small founding population size. (d-f) Because the exact day that transmission occurred is not known, we compared changes in nucleotide diversity using both the index animal day 5 and day 3 timepoints. The comparison using day 5 is shown in the main text in Fig. 5 and the same data using the index animal day 3 data are shown here. (d) As in Fig. 5 , during transmission between the HA190D225D pair, both synonymous and nonsynonymous diversity are slightly reduced across the genome, with the exception of a large reduction in M2 synonymous diversity. (e and f) In Mut pairs 1 and 3, nonsynonymous diversity is reduced the most significantly in HA1. In Mut pair 1 (e) synonymous and nonsynonymous diversity are only slightly decreased or increased across the rest of the genome, while in Mut pair 3 (f), diversity is also reduced in other genome segments, possibly due to a founder effect. Table S1 , related to Experimental Procedures. Primer sequences used for PCR. Segments were amplified using specific PCR primers as listed above. Nei and Gojobori's (1986) method of estimating synonymous and nonsynonymous substitutions from next-generation sequencing data (Nelson et al., 2015) . These estimates were performed using deep sequence data subsampled such that each base position is covered by approximately 5000x coverage. The second set of values represent those calculated from deep sequence data subsampled such that each base position is covered by 1000x coverage using PoPoolation. For both, red values highlight genes with \u03c0N/\u03c0S ratios greater than 1, suggesting that diversity is favored at these loci. With the exception of the HA gene, most of the influenza genome is under purifying selection during replication at all time points. Shown are every mutation detected in at least 1% of all sequencing reads for every timepoint in the index and contact animals in the HA190D225D and Mut transmitting pairs. Amino acid changes are represented in H3 mature peptide numbering as is shown in the manuscript. Mutations occurring within the signal peptide are numbered with reference to the amino acid number within the signal peptide and are denoted by \"(SP)\" in the amino acid change column. Mutations occurring before the signal peptide are denoted as \"non-coding\" in the amino acid change column. Nucleotide changes are shown in reference to the original 1918-like avian influenza virus. Syn indicates that the mutation was synonymous, i.e., did not cause a change in amino acid. \"SNP\" denotes a single nucleotide polymorphism and \"fs\" denotes a frameshift mutation. We queried every polymorphic nucleotide site in HA that occurred more than once in the study, i.e., in either more than 1 animal or in more than 1 timepoint. This resulted in a final query of 12 nucleotide positions (400, 507, 550, 634, 640, 644, 648, 653, 747, 748, 749, and 868) , which encode 9 amino acid substitutions (113, 145, 159, 187, 189, 190, 192, 225, and 265) . Due to the limits imposed by the average fragment length of the input sequencing library, we were unable to query all of the sites of interest in HA in a single window. We therefore analyzed each sample with two overlapping windows. Window 1 covered 9 nucleotide sites (634, 640, 644, 648, 653, 747, 748, 749 and 868) and window 2 covered 8 nucleotide sites (400, 507, 550, 634, 640, 644, 648, 653) . Each haplotype was given an arbitrary number as shown in the left-most column. For each window, the nucleotide and amino acid positions queried are displayed in the first row in bold. For each unique haplotype, the identity of the nucleotide and corresponding amino acid identified at that position are shown. We queried every polymorphic nucleotide site in HA that occurred more than once in the study, i.e., in either more than 1 animal or in more than 1 timepoint. This resulted in a final query of 12 nucleotide positions (400, 507, 550, 634, 640, 644, 648, 653, 747, 748, 749, and 868) , which encode 9 amino acid substitutions (113, 145, 159, 187, 189, 190, 192, 225, and 265) . Due to the limits imposed by the average fragment length of the input sequencing library, we were unable to query all of the sites of interest in HA in a single window. We therefore analyzed each sample with two overlapping windows. Window 1 covered 11 nucleotide sites (507, 550, 634, 640, 644, 648, 653, 747, 748, 749 and 868) and window 2 covered 11 nucleotide sites (400, 507, 550, 634, 640, 644, 648, 653,747, 748 and 749) .

(a) 1918-like avian virus replication was low in index animals and transmission did not occur in any of the 3 ferret pairs. (b) In the PB2 E627K animals, viral replication improved and 1 animal (index 3) shed virus for 7 days post-inoculation. Transmission was not observed in any of the 3 pairs. (c) Infectious viral titers for animals infected with the HA190D225D virus remain high throughout replication in index and contact animals. (d) Viral titers in animals infected with the Mut virus also remain high. (e) Comparison of the infectious viral titers from nasal washes for all index animals infected throughout the study show that there are statistically significant differences between the titers in all comparisons except between the HA190D225D and Mut groups. An ANOVA implementing Tukey's multiple comparisons test was used to assess statistical significance. **** p \u2264 0.0001, *** p \u2264 0.001, ** p \u2264 0.01, * p \u2264 0.05, ns p > 0.05. (f) A 1918-like avian reassortant virus was generated from gene segments of currently circulating avian influenza viruses with close sequence identity to the 1918 human pandemic strain. Introduction of PB2 E627K, HA E190D and HA G225D into the 1918-like avian virus backbone resulted in a virus (the \"HA190D225D\" virus) transmissible in 1 of 3 ferret pairs. During this transmission experiment, PB2 A684D, PA V253M, HA S113N, and HA D265V arose and were present at a high frequency in the contact animal. Virus was isolated from the nasal wash fluid from the infected contact ferret on day 9 post-contact, amplified on MDCK cells, and used to inoculate 3 new pairs of ferrets. This virus was called the \"Mut\" virus. Transmission with the Mut virus occurred in 2 of 3 ferret pairs. Virus was isolated from nasal wash fluid from all infected index and contact animals and used for deep sequencing.",

All samples from ferrets infected with 1918-like avian influenza viruses were generated prior to the gain-of-function research pause. Sequences were generated using viral RNA previously isolated from nasal wash samples collected as part of a previously described study (Watanabe et al., 2014) . Briefly, a fully avian reassortant H1N1 virus was generated by combining the gene segments from recently circulating avian influenza viruses that share the closest nucleotide sequence identity to the 1918 human pandemic virus. Plasmids encoding these gene segments were synthesized and used to generate the initial 1918-like avian virus stock by reverse genetics (Hoffmann et al., 2000) . This virus was then used to inoculate 3 index ferrets. One day later, a na\u00efve contact ferret was placed in an adjacent cage separated by wire mesh that allows respiratory droplet transmission but prevents ferrets from coming into direct contact with one another. Transmission was assessed by serology and virus isolation. Live virus was not detectable in any contact ferrets after index animals were inoculated with the original 1918-like avian virus, although the virus replicated to low titer in index animals (Fig. S1 ). Introduction of a glutamate-to-lysine change at position 627 in the PB2 protein (PB2 E627K) increased 1918-like virus replication in index ferrets, but transmission was still not observed in any of 3 ferret pairs and no contact animals seroconverted. Introduction of 2 more amino acid substitutions, aspartates at positions 190 and 225 in HA (HA E190D and G225D), resulted in a virus transmissible in 1 of 3 ferret pairs and seroconversion in the single infected contact animal. We refer to the virus stock containing these 3 substitutions in PB2 and HA (PB2 E627K, HA E190D and HA G225D) as the HA190D225D virus. Virus was isolated from nasal wash fluid from the single HA190D225D-infected contact animal on day 9 post-contact. This viral isolate was amplified on MDCK cells to produce the \"Mut\" stock virus, which was then used to inoculate 3 more index ferrets. Transmission and seroconversion were observed in 2 of 3 contact animals in this experiment. Nasal washes were collected from all infected index ferrets on days 1, 3, and 5 post-inoculation and from contact ferrets on days 5, 7, and 9 post-contact. Viral RNA was isolated from these nasal washes and used for deep sequencing.",

            "text": "The \u03c0 statistic for measuring nucleotide diversity was calculated using two different methods. The first, as displayed in the manuscript (Fig. 3, Fig. 5, Fig. S5b , d and f, and Tables 1 and S2), calculated the synonymous (\u03c0S) and nonsynonymous (\u03c0N) nucleotide diversity using SNPGenie , which adapts Nei and Gojobori's (1986) method of estimating synonymous and nonsynonymous substitutions for next-generation sequencing data (Bailey et al., 2014; Nei and Gojobori, 1986; Wilker et al., 2013) . For this method, reference-based assemblies were used to call SNPs at a 0.0001% frequency cutoff, which allowed us to detect every single SNP in the assembly. To reduce possible effects of resequencing or uneven coverage across samples, assemblies were subsampled using CLC assembly cell such that each gene had approximately 5000x coverage before SNP calling (average coverage after subsampling = 5054 \u00b1 2438). Inherent in this calculation of \u03c0N and \u03c0S is a method of determining the number of nonsynonymous and synonymous sites that weights the sites by the actual frequencies of codons in the population. Thus, if there is any sort of codon bias, this is reflected in the number of sites, which effectively measures the number of possible changes experienced by the codons that are actually present in the population. This method does not incorporate a correction for transition/transversion rate variation. \u03c0N and \u03c0S were also independently estimated using PoPoolation version 1.2.2 for comparison (Kofler et al., 2011) , which is shown in Table S2 and Figure S5a , c and e. For this analysis, SAM files of the referencebased mappings were exported from CLC Genomics Workbench and converted to sorted pileup files using SAMtools (Li et al., 2009) . To reduce possible bias from resequencing for very high coverage samples (samples for which coverage exceeded the known titer at that timepoint), all pileup files were randomly subsampled to ensure even coverage across every nucleotide position using the PoPoolation subsamplepileup.pl script (Kofler et al., 2011) . After subsampling, all bases in each sample were covered to a depth between 100x and 1000x, and these subsampled pileup files were used for all diversity estimates. \u03c0 was calculated using the Variance-at-position.pl script and \u03c0N and \u03c0S estimates were calculated on a genewise level using the Syn-nonsyn-at-position.pl script. Sliding window analysis of nucleotide diversity was performed with the Syn-nonsyn-sliding.pl script using a window size of 150 nucleotides and a step size of 3 nucleotides. Corrections were disabled for all \u03c0 analyses. Results using the SNPGenie and PoPoolation methods were highly concordant; as such, we only reported the former results in the main manuscript with the latter estimates shown in Supplemental tables and figures.",

In order to rigorously assess as much haplotype diversity as possible, we chose to query every polymorphic nucleotide site in HA that occurred more than once in the study, i.e., in either more than 1 animal or in more than 1 timepoint. This resulted in a final query of 12 nucleotide positions (400, 507, 550, 634, 640, 644, 648, 653, 747, 748, 749, and 868) , which correspond to 9 amino acid positions (113, 145, 159, 187, 189, 190, 192, 225, and 265) . Due to the limits imposed by the average fragment length of the input sequencing library, we were unable to query all of the sites of interest in HA in a single window. We therefore analyzed each sample with two overlapping windows, each covering 11 of the 12 nucleotide positions. As such, haplotypes for each sample were enumerated twice, once by querying sites 400, 507, 550, 634, 640, 644, 648, 653, 747, 748, and 749, and again by querying 507, 550, 634, 640, 644, 648, 653, 747, 748, 749, and 868 .

For example, the comparison of \u03c0N and \u03c0S for index animals in the Mut group used \u03c0N and \u03c0S values for all 3 index animals on all 3 timepoints combined, resulting in a final paired comparison of 9 \u03c0N values verses 9 \u03c0S values testing the null hypothesis that \u03c0N = \u03c0S. These were performed using Minitab. For comparing changes in \u03c0N and \u03c0S during transmission, the mean of the differences in \u03c0N and \u03c0S values between index and contact animals were compared using a 1-way ANOVA. If differences were observed among genes, individual comparisons among genes were performed using Dunnett's test. These analyses were performed in Minitab. The ANOVA test comparing infectious viral titers (Fig. S1e ) was performed in Prism version 6.0b for Mac (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA, www.graphpad.com). A one-way ANOVA with Tukey's multiple comparisons test was used to assess statistically significant differences in titers between groups.",
