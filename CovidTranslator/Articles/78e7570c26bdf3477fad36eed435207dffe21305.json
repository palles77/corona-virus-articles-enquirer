To estimate 90% confidence intervals, we ran 1 million nonparametric bootstrap resamples of each dataset, with replacement, and recalculated the R and k estimates for each resample. Then we used a bias-corrected percentile method (1) to construct the confidence intervals. We used the 1-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, adapted for discrete variables (2), to assess goodness of fit, and the null hypothesis that each dataset was generated from the given negative binomial distribution was not rejected (P >0.6 in all cases).",

These results show contrasting interpretations of the parameter k. Although increasing R always increases exceedance probabilities, the effect of increasing k is not always the same, as higher variability (lower k) increases the probability of both below-average and above-average transmissions. For example, with R fixed at a specific value, a lower value of k decreases the probability of >1 transmissions (Technical Appendix Figure, panel A); that is, lower k increases the probability that the initial case will not transmit, which is the best-case scenario for a country experiencing an introduction. However, a lower value of k also increases the probability of worst-case scenarios for certain values of R, for example, the probability of >10 transmissions for R = 0.1 (Technical Appendix Figure, panel C) or the probability of >100 transmissions for R = 0.6 (Technical Appendix Figure, panel D).",
