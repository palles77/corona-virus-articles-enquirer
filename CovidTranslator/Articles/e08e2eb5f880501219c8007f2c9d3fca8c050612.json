Differential localization can be explained by signal sequence. The sequence alignment using Clustal W shows that the signal sequence present at the cytoplasmic tail plays an important role in spike protein localization. A unique GYQEL motif is identified at the cytoplasmic terminal of OC43 spike protein which helps in localization in the lysosome, and a novel KLHYT motif is identified in the cytoplasmic tail of SARS spike protein which helps in ER or ERGIC localization. This study sheds some light on the role of cytoplasmic tail of spike protein in cell-to-cell fusion, coronavirus host cell fusion and subsequent pathogenicity.

Matured virus are thought to move through the vesicles via the secretory pathways and exit the cell when the vesicles fuse with the plasma membrane (Holmes et al. 1984; Tooze et al. 1987) . Mature coronavirus virion normally consists of structural proteins, S (spike), M (matrix), and E (envelope) that surrounds a helical nucleocapsid. An additional protein, HE (hemagglutinin esterase) is expressed in some beta-coronaviruses. M is a triple spanning membrane protein believed to play a key role in maintaining viral core structure; whereas E, a small enveloped glycoprotein, is critical for virion assembly. The S protein is a type I membrane glycoprotein which (Vennema et al. 1990 ) constitutes the characteristic coronavirus spike. HE is also a type I glycoprotein with a single membrane spanning anchor and a short cytoplasmic tail. Detailed studies on virus-like particle formation (VLPs) revealed that only M and E proteins are required for VLP formation.",

Some viral glycoproteins sort to the specialized apical or basolateral plasma membrane of the polarized epithelial cells. For example, glycoprotein gp160 from type 1 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) sorts to the basolateral domain (Owens and Compans 1989) , but a prototype glycoprotein, hemagglutinin from the influenza virus, sorts to the apical domain (Mora et al. 2002) . To mediate budding of infectious viral particles through the intracellular membranes, viral glycoproteins must embed a signal for sorting to an intracellular compartment. For example, Golgi targeting signal (Teasdale and Jackson 1996) in the membrane spanning domains of the M protein of coronaviruses (Machamer and Rose 1987; Swift and Machamer 1991) and the G1 protein of bunya viruses (Matsuoka et al. 1991 ) specify the glycoprotein accumulation at Golgi complex (Andersson and Pettersson 1998) . The dilysine signal (DEKKMP) in adenovirus glycoprotein E19 carboxy terminal localizes it to the ER (Paabo et al. 1987; Nilsson et al. 1989) . A similar dilysine signal partitions human foamy virus maturation to intracytoplasmic compartments (Goepfert et al. 1999) . Proteins containing the dilysine motif have been observed to bind directly to well-characterized coat proteins (COPI) (Cosson and Letourneur 1994; Gaynor et al. 1998; Corse and Machamer 2002) . The COPI coated vesicles mediate retrograded transport of the dilysine signal-containing proteins from the proximal Golgi compartments to the ER.",

            "text": "Recent studies on coronavirus spike protein signals have revealed a dilysine-based ER localization signal in the infectious bronchitis virus (IBV, a gamma-coronavirus) (figure 1). The IBV S protein also carries a tyrosine-based (YYTF) endocytotic signal in its cytoplasmic tail (Corse and Machamer 2002; Bonifacino and Traub 2003) which is more crucial for the intracellular retention of the S protein than its canonical dilysine-based signal (Winter et al. 2008) . A similar dibasic motif (KXHXX) in the cytoplasmic tail of S protein from alpha-coronavirus TGEV and from the newly emerging pathogen SARS, an outlier of beta-coronavirus, localizes the S protein in the ERGIC (Teasdale and Jackson 1996; Lontok et al. 2004) . A tyrosine-based sorting motif (YEPI) has also been shown to be an intracellular localization signal in the cytoplasmic tail of TGEV (Schwegmann-Wessels et al. 2004 ). Very few studies have convincingly demonstrated a localization signal in the cytoplasmic tail of beta-coronaviruses that would lead to their sequestration within the intracellular compartment. The intracellular transport and targeting of proteins from their site of synthesis to their correct destination is a process instrumental to maintenance of virion integrity. A major effort is underway to understand the interplay of factors that guide the envelope proteins to the intracellular budding compartments avoiding the bulk flow through the secretory pathways (Bonifacino and Traub 2003) . There is ample evidence that the localization signalling motifs in the virus mimic those used by the endogenous cellular proteins of the host cell subverting their cellular machinery (Bonifacino and Traub 2003) .",

Full-length SARS S protein when expressed exogenously is observed to accumulate predominantly in intracellular compartments resembling ER and ERGIC with occasional surface staining. HCoV-OC43 S protein is localized in distinct puncta that could represent the endocytic structure. Exogenously expressed HCoV-SARS S protein occasionally induces cell-to-cell fusion when transported to surface in transfected cells, but HCoV-OC43 S protein fail to induce the same. The intracellular distribution of the S protein differs significantly in the two viruses. We identified a unique tyrosine-based motif (GYQEL, an YXX\u00d8 motif where \u00d8 = bulky hydrophobic side chains) at the cytoplasmic tail of HCoV-OC43 (figure 1). YXX\u00d8 is known to function as a signal for rapid internalization (Mellman 1996; Kirchhausen et al. 1997; Marks et al. 1997) , lysosomal targeting and localization to basolateral surface in polarized epithelial cells (Mellman 1996) . The position of this motif in the protein sequence Figure 1 . Alignment of the amino acid sequence in the cytoplasmic tail downstream of the membrane-spanning domain in the coronavirus S proteins. The YXX\u00d8 internalization signals are coloured red, and the di-lysine-based motifs, grey. The di-basic motifs from HCoV-229E and FIPV are putative intracellular signals not experimentally verified (Lontok et al. 2004) . Localization signals experimentally identified from this study are marked in bold. The sequence alignment was done using the program Clustal omega (McWilliam et al. 2013) . Specific virus, localization signal, cellular localization and the authors describing them are elaborated as follows: (SARS; KLHYT; ER/ERGIC; this study, also Lontok et al. 2004 on truncated protein); (OC43; GYQEL; lysosome/internalization; this study); (TGEV; KVHVH, YEPI; ER; (Schwegmann-Wessels et al. 2004) ; (IBV; KKSV, YYTF; ER/Internalization; (Lontok et al. 2004). relative to the transmembrane domain determines its cellular location.

S protein from other alpha-coronavirus (human coronavirus 229E and feline infectious peritonitis virus) also contains the sequence at their C termini (figure 1). The KLHYT fits the criteria for the dibasic KXHXX motif if the histidine residue is protonated. Lontok et al., in their chimeric S protein studies used C terminal 11 amino acids of SARS-S protein attached to the plasma membrane reporter protein VSV-G to show KXHXX motif is an intracellular localization signal for SARS, and the intracellular distribution closely overlapped with ERGIC. They also demonstrated that mutagenesis of the lysine and histidine residues in the KXHXX signal results in the loss of intracellular localization (Lontok et al. 2004 ). In our fulllength SARS spike YFP fusion protein though the KXHXX motif is no more near the C-terminal; it still acts like the KXHXX motif in the C terminal tail of SARS wild-type protein. To test that the internal KXHXX motif could function as a genuine intracellular localization signal, the lysine and histidine residues in SARS-S-Y pCAGG was mutagenized to alanines to construct the SARS-S 2A -Y pCAGGS. Hela cells were transiently transfected with mutated SARS-S 2A -Y pCAGGS and were examined by epifluorescence microscopy (figure 8a, b) . SARS-S 2A -Y pCAGGS fluorescence was observed all through the cell and not localized to any particular organelle. Our studies clearly demonstrated that the KXHXX motif is the major intracellular localization signal of the full-length SARS-S protein and the C-terminal proximity is not essential. 3.7 Mutation of critical tyrosine residues of OC43 lysosomal targeting signal causes HCoV-OC43 spike to traffic to cell surface",

Previous studies have suggested that the presence of dibasic residue pair and its specific location relative to the transmembrane domain and the carboxy terminal is critical for ER localization activity. Specific studies propose a minimum of 5 amino acid residues to be mandatory between the first charged residue of the cytoplasmic tail and the \u22123 lysine such that the signal sequence be exposed from the membrane lipids in order to function (Teasdale and Jackson 1996) . Our alanine mutation studies on the KXHXX motif confirm the importance of the lysine and histidine in the full-length wild-type HCoV-SARS S protein; the mutant protein showed localization in plasma membrane instead of the usual ER and ERGIC. The carboxy terminal proximity of the motif was not found mandatory. The C-terminal S-YFP-tagged fusion protein also showed ER/ERGIC localization. YFP is a 120-residue protein, and when fused to the C-terminal end along with an artificial linker makes the dibasic motif XXX residues carboxy terminal distal. We have not systematically examined the maximum length of a cytoplasmic domain of S protein on which a lysinebased motif still functions. There is putative evidence of dilysine motif 546 amino acids from the predicted membrane-spanning region and X residues from the carboxy terminal end in the ER localizing HMG CoA reductase (Luskey and Stevens 1985) . Other ER localization signals like the RXR motif identified in certain oligomeric ion channels do not require proximity to either the N or C terminus. This suggest carboxy terminal proximity of the dibasic motif is not a general requirement for localization function, although, exposure from the membrane lipids may be necessary.",

            "text": "The dibasic signals are present in the S protein from alpha and gamma and the SARS-coronavirus; there was no such obvious dibasic motif in the cytoplasmic tail of beta-coronavirus. However, we reported that a tyrosine-based signal (GYQEL), at the 23-27 residues of the carboxy terminal tail of HCoV-OC43 S protein, is a motif of the class YXX\u00d8 conferring sorting information onto transmembrane proteins. The Y residue is essential for function in most cases. X can be any amino acid and are highly variable but tend to be hydrophilic. The \u00d8 position can accommodate several residues with bulky hydrophobic side chains, although the exact identity of this residue can specify the properties of the signal (Canfield et al. 1991) . However, the X residues and residues flanking the motif also contribute to the strength and fidelity of the signals. The topological location of the YXX\u00d8 motif on the context of a specific protein is also as important as the actual amino acid sequence. Depending on the context of the YXX\u00d8 motif in the cytoplasmic tail of the protein, YXX\u00d8 motif can function as a rapid internalization from the surface (Mellman 1996; Kirchhausen et al. 1997; Marks et al. 1997) , lysosomal targeting, localization to specialized endosomal-lysosomal organelles such as antigenprocessing compartments as well as basolateral surface in polarized epithelial cells. Purely endocytic YXX\u00d8 signals are most often situated at 10-40 residues from the transmembrane domains, but not at the carboxy termini of the proteins (Bonifacino and Traub 2003) . In contrast, lysosomal targeting YXX\u00d8 signals are conspicuous for their presence at 6-9 residues from the transmembrane domain and are often located at the carboxy terminus of short cytoplasmic tail preceded by a glycine (Bonifacino and Traub 2003) . Their effectiveness may be modified by spacing the GYXX\u00d8 motif relative to the membrane bilayer (Rohrer et al. 1996) . Lysosomal-sorting YXX\u00d8 motifs tend to have acidic residues at the X positions, and these may also contribute to the efficiency of lysosomal targeting (Rous et al. 2002) . These signals can be found in all types of transmembrane protein, including Type I (e.g. LAMP-1 and LAMP-2), Type II (e.g., the transferring and a sialoglycoprotein receptors) and multispanning integral membrane proteins (e.g., CD63 and cystinosin). The importance of the distance from the transmembrane domain has been emphasized by a study showing that changing the spacing of the GYQTI signal from LAMP-1 impairs targeting to lysosomes (Rohrer et al. 1996) . The mutant proteins continue to be internalized at the same rates but recycle to the plasma membrane, a behavior typical of endocytic receptors (Rohrer et al. 1996) . These observations indicate that the placement of YXX\u00d8 signals at 6-9 residues from the transmembrane domain allows their recognition as lysosomal targeting signals at the TGN and/or endosomes.",

It has been reported that this virus HCoV-OC43 has neuroinvasive properties (Arbour et al. 2000) . The molecular determinants that may account for the dramatic difference in pathogenic potential of the two HCoV are currently unknown. Previous attempts to uncover the basis of pathogenicity have shown several directions. The primary target of such studies has been the S proteins which are most amenable for interaction with the host cells due to their convenient location on the mature virion surface. Several evidences support a major role for the S protein in determining the tropism and pathogenesis (Casais et al. 2003 , Das Sarma 2010 . The nucleotide sequencing revealed that alterations in virus virulence were more closely associated with differences in the S protein. The S protein is responsible for attachment to the cellular receptor both for virus cell fusion during viral entry and cell to cell fusion later during infection (reviewed in (Belouzard et al. 2012) . It contains epitopes for viral neutralization and T-cell response. Zinc metallopeptidase, angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) has been identified as the functional receptor for HCoV-SARS (Li et al. 2003) . No functional receptor is yet known for HCoV-OC43. The fate of the S protein during the virion assembly is therefore important in understanding the basis of the host-pathogen interaction and virus infectivity.

In our study exogenously expressed the fulllength HCoV-SARS had a steady state distribution in the ER and ERGIC, and HCoV-OC43 was mostly sorted to lysosomes. The predominant intracellular localization or retention of S protein in the early stage of infection have two implications in pathogenesis: (i) delayed cell-damaging effect which may contribute to maximum virus production, and (ii) absence from the cell surface may help to avoid the defense mechanism, e.g. complement activation. At the same time the surface expression could promote direct cell-to-cell spread of the infection. The low virulence of HCoV-OC43 can be clearly attributed by its restricted surface transport of its S protein during infection. The sorting of the excess S protein of HCoV-OC43 in the lysosomal compartment may hinder its cell-to-cell spread during infection. Viral production is mainly dependent on the intracellular budding. Cellto-cell fusion cannot help to spread the disease.",

The localization of SARS-S-Y partially overlapped the ER resident protein calnexin, the ERGIC protein \u03b2-COP and trans-Golgi marker MannII. The distribution of SARS-S-Y strongly overlapped with the ER (figure 6a-c) indicating its large accumulation in the ER compartment, possibly due to the slow folding of its large luminal domain(Vennema et al. 1990). Additionally, the localization of SARS-S-Y in ERGIC compartment (figure 6g-i) is consistent with the presence of the dibasic KXHXX signaling sequence at the extreme C termini of SARS-S as demonstrated byLontok et al. (2004). The distribution of SARS-S-Y also overlapped with the Golgi marker MannII (figure 6m-o). Unlike SARS-S-Y, OC43-S-Y showed partial overlap with both ER (figure 6df) and ERGIC marker (figure 6j-l), Golgi marker (figure 6p-r)",
