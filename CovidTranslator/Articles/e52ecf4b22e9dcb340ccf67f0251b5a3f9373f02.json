Patients and methods: Full details of the MERS-CoV cases available and published in the disease outbreak news on the WHO website were retrieved. Related details of laboratoryconfirmed MERS-CoV were extracted and analyzed by standard statistical methods. Results: A total of 107 cases of MERS-CoV, including 18 deaths (overall case fatality rate (CFR), 16.8%; male-specific CFR was 17.5% [14/80] and female-specific CFR was 14.8% [4/27]) were reported to WHO from the National International Health Regulation Focal Points of Saudi Arabia and Oman. The overall mean age was 50\u00b117 years and 80 patients (74.8%) were male. The average time from the onset of the symptoms to the first hospitalization was 3\u00b13.3 days; from the first hospitalization to laboratory confirmation was 3.6\u00b16.5 days; from the onset of symptom to death was 17.5\u00b111.7 days; and the mean length of hospitalization for patients with MERS-CoV was 3.5\u00b13.9 days. Males in comparison to females had a 1.5-fold increased chance (adjusted OR =1.5 [95% CI: 1.3-1.8]) of death related to MERS-CoV infection; 1.05 [95% CI: 1.1-3.3], 1.05 [95% CI: 1.2-2.8] and 1.06 [95% CI: 1.2-2.0] for those who had exposure to camels, camel milk consumption, and close contact with MERS-CoV cases, respectively. Health care workers had 2.4 fold [95% CI: 1.2-3.1] greater odds of death compared to other people. Conclusion:",

            "text": "Human coronaviruses (hCoV) usually causes mild-to-moderate upper respiratory tract illnesses. 1 One of these hCoV is the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) which is a viral respiratory disease caused by a novel coronavirus (Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, or MERS-CoV). MERS-CoV belongs to the genus \"Betacoronavirus\" that is an emerging zoonotic virus considered as one of the major public threats and causes severe and fatal respiratory illness in humans. 2, 3 This infection is different from any other known hCoVs that have the possibility of human and zoonotic transmissions. 4 The patterns of transmission and origins of MERS CoV remain unclear, and based on the analysis of different virus genomes, it is declared that it may have originated in bats and was transmitted to camels sometime in the distant past. Although an animal reservoir is suspected, none has been discovered. Meanwhile, global concern rests on the ability of MERS-CoV to cause major illness in close contacts of patients. 5 The clinical spectrum of MERS-CoV infection ranges from subclinical infections to severe respiratory diseases and death. 6 MERS-CoV first isolated in September 2012 from a patient with fatal pneumonia in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. 7 Since then, 27 countries in the worldwide have reported cases of MERS including the United Kingdom, United States, Austria, Algeria, China, France, Greece, Italy, Kuwait, Thailand, Lebanon, Egypt, the Netherlands, Germany, Islamic Republic of Iran, Oman, Philippines, Qatar, Jordan, SouthKorea, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Malaysia, Tunisia, Turkey, United Arab Emirates, Yemen, and Bahrain. 5 Globally, from September 2012 until 24 April 2019, WHO has been notified of 2374 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV including 823 associated deaths from 27 countries worldwide. 8 As per the author's knowledge, since the onset of MERS-CoV outbreak, several studies have been conducted on various aspects of this disease, including genome combinations, clinical manifestations, pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment. However, there are still gaps in the knowledge of this disease, and monitoring and periodical assessment of this emerging infection in an epidemiological study format seem to be necessary. After 8 years from the onset of the MERS-CoVoutbreak, this infection is still considered as a public health threat with no vaccine or specific treatment and also with some unknown epidemiological aspects related to it. Strategies to contain the MERS-CoV depends on providing epidemiological knowledge about this infection. This study represents the current epidemiological status (mortality risk, identify potential risk factor, and geographical distribution) of the MERS-CoV in the world in 2019 and identified and highlighted the most probable risk factors related to this infection.",

Most of the cases reported in Saudi Arabia were from Riyadh (71.9%) and in Oman 8.4% from North Al-Batinah (Figure 2) . The large proportion of reported cases from this mentioned region highlights the importance of implementation of infection control practices to limit transmission in there. The results of this study are in line with the previous published epidemiological studies, [20] [21] [22] those which declared that Saudi Arabia had been the epicenter of MERS-CoV infection, and during the 8 years from the onset of this disease, this country had always ranked first in aspect of the number of MERS cases and deaths related to MERS-CoV infection with >80% of global MERS-CoV burden among all the affected countries worldwide.",

The design of this survey was cross-sectional so that no causal inferences could be made because the evaluation of the temporal relationship between exposure and outcome is limited in such designs. The sample size in this study is low; therefore, there is a probability of a random error occurrence in the results. Possible misclassification in the categorization of MERS cases may be due to the respondents, declaration for example in exposure to camels, camel milk consumption, exposure to MERS-CoV cases, and comorbidity which potentially may occur as a result of the measurement bias. Despite the above limitations, the current global survey may have a number of implications for health care policy by using global data.",

The continuous occurrence of MERS-CoV cases after 8 years from the passes of the disease is critical to a global public health response. Since our knowledge about the epidemiology of MERS-CoV is increasing, there is the need for educational programs, access to the health care setting and early detection of morbid cases with MERS-CoV. By considering the results in the present study, policymakers and local health authorities of the affected countries can modify potential risk factors to reduce the higher mortality rates in MERS patients and also to prevent, respond to and control outbreaks of MERS-CoV.",
