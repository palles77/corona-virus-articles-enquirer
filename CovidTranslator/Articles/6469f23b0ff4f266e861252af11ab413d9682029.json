In this study, a checkpoint blockade vaccine for canine melanoma was tested for safety and immunogenicity. Five healthy adult dogs received a mixture of three replication-defective chimpanzee-derived adenoviral vectors, one expressing mouse fibroblast-associated protein (mFAP) and the others expressing canine melanoma-associated antigens Trp-1 or Trp-2 fused into Herpes Simplex-1 glycoprotein D, a checkpoint inhibitor of herpes virus entry mediator (HVEM) pathways. The vaccine mixture was shown to be well tolerated and increased frequencies of canineTrp-1-specific activated CD8 + and CD4 + T cells secreting interferon-(IFN)-\u03b3, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1, or interleukin (IL)-2 alone or in combinations in four and five out of five dogs, respectively. To avoid excessive bleeds, responses to cTrp-2 were not analyzed. All dogs responded with increased frequencies of mFAP-specific activated CD8 + and CD4 + T cells. The results of this safety/immunogenicity trial invite further testing of this checkpoint blockade vaccine combination in dogs with melanoma.",

Treatment options include radical surgery [3] , immunotherapy [4] , radiation therapy [5] , chemotherapy, [6] or hyperthermia [7] . The two latter treatment options are generally ineffective. Prognosis varies according to tumor stage and treatment [8, 9] . Even after radical surgery, dogs with stage II or III melanoma die on average within less than a year [5] .",

The overall efficacy of cancer vaccines, the most cost-effective option for cancer immunotherapy, warrants further improvement. Major barriers are exhaustion of tumor antigen (TA)-specific CD8 + TILs within the tumor microenvironment (TME) [15, 16] , the recruitment of immunoinhibitory cells [17] , and a metabolically hostile milieu [18] . T-cell exhaustion is characterized by increased expression of immunoinhibitory molecules such as PD-1, LAG-3, BTLA, CTLA-4, and others, leading to loss of functions and eventual cell death. Immunosuppression can in part be reversed by antibodies that block the interactions between the immunoinhibitors on T cells and their ligands [19, 20] . Human checkpoint blockade therapy has mainly focused on treatments with blocking antibodies to PD-1, its ligand PD-L1, or CTLA-4, that have resulted in tumor regression in certain cancer patients [21] .",

The immunoinihbitory milieu of the TME can further be reduced by depleting cells of the tumor stroma, such as fibroblasts, with a vaccine targeting cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAF) with fibroblast-associated protein (FAP) to elicit a vaccine-induced anti-CAF T-cell response [23] , which in turn reduces T-cell exhaustion and delays tumor progression.",

The expression cassette was excised with the rare cutters I-Ceu I and PI-Sce I and cloned into the molecular AdC68 clone cut with the same enzymes. Recombinant molecular clones were identified in transformed bacteria through diagnostic restriction enzyme digests.

The DNA was transfected into semi-confluent monolayers of HEK 293 cells from the American Tissue Culture Collection (ATCC \u00ae CRL-1573 \u2122 ) for viral rescue. When viral plaques became visible, cells were harvested and the virus was released by freeze-thawing. The virus was then expanded over several passages on HEK 293 cells. When a large-scale stock of 40 T175 flasks was produced, the virus was purified by buoyant density ultracentrifugation on CsCl gradients followed by desalting with a Bio-Gel P-6DG column.",

Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were prepared and tested by intracellular cytokine staining (ICS) after a 6-h stimulation period in the presence of a secretion inhibitor with 15-mer peptides overlapping at each end by five amino acids with the adjacent peptide and spanning the sequences of cTrp-1 and mFAP. Positive control cells were stimulated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), negative control cells were cultured without peptide. To avoid excessive bleed volumes, immune responses to Trp-2 were not analyzed. After stimulation, cells were stained with panels of antibodies. CD8 + and CD4 + T cells were identified as cells that were positive for CD3 and CD8 or CD4 and negative for CD14. T cells were further subdivided into activated T cells by stains for CD95, which increases upon stimulation, and CD28, which is higher on resting than activated T cells. Cells were tested for intracellular interferon (IFN)-\u03b3, interleukin (IL)-2, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1. After staining, they were analyzed by flow cytometry and gated by FlowJo as shown in Suppl. Fig. 1 for a positive control sample. Dogs showed increased frequencies of cytokine-producing CD8 + T cells to both cTrp-1 and mFAP. Upon gating of the different cytokine responses, Boolean gating was used to calculate the overall response. The sum of cytokine-producing CD8 + T cells to cTrp-1 was highest on day 7, reflecting mainly increases in TNF-\u03b1 production (Fig. 2a) . Responses to mFAP peaked later by day 14 and were dominated by CD8 + T cells producing IL-2 (Fig. 2b) . Restricting the gate to activated CD95 + CD8 + T cells increased frequencies of cells responding to the cTrp-1 and mFAP peptide pools (Fig. 2c, d) and broadened the cytokine profile with higher frequencies of cells producing IFN-\u03b3 with or without IL-2. CD95 + CD8 + cells also had increased frequencies of IFN-\u03b3producing mFAP-specific cells. Further narrowing the gate by excluding CD28 + cells showed a shift in kinetics with peak frequencies to both peptide pools by day 42, at which time cells secreted mainly IL-2 and IFN-\u03b3 alone or in combination (Fig. 2e, f) .",

Individual dogs showed differences in responses to the two antigens and between the different CD8 + T cell populations as well as between the different cytokines (Fig. 3) . Analyzing responsiveness for the sum of all cytokine-secreting CD8 + T cells showed that only two of the five dogs met the criteria for positive responses to cTrp-1. Both showed increases in IL-2 and IFN-\u03b3, only one was positive for TNF-\u03b1. Upon analysis of CD95 + CD8 + T cells, response rates to cTrp-1 increased to three of five dogs (Fig. 3c, d) and further restricting the gate to CD95 + CD28 \u2212 CD8 + T cells, which markedly reduced baseline responses showed cTrp-1-specific responses in four of five dogs (Fig. 3c, d) . Increases in responses were mainly seen for IFN-\u03b3 and IL-2. Response rates were higher for mFAP. Upon gating on all CD8 + T cells, four of five dogs qualified as responders; the gates for CD95 + CD8 + and CD95 + CD28 \u2212 CD8 + cells showed responses in all animals. Responses again mainly reflected increases in IFN-\u03b3-and IL-2-producing CD8 + T cells. CD4 + T-cell responses to cTrp-1 and mFAP CD4 + T cells, unlike CD8 + T cells, did not show a distinctive population of CD28 \u2212 cells within the CD95 + gate. We therefore only analyzed all CD4 + cells and CD95 + CD4 + cells for cytokine responses. CD4 + T-cell responses to both antigens peaked on day 14 after vaccination with increases seen mainly in cells producing TNF-\u03b1. Responses contracted sharply by day 42 after vaccination (Fig. 4a, b) . Responses of cTrp-1-specific CD95 + CD4 + cells peaked earlier by day 7 and again mainly reflected TNF-\u03b1 + cells, while responses to mFAP were highest on day 14 and showed increases in both TNF-\u03b1-and IFN-\u03b3producing cells (Fig. 4c, d) . Overall the kinetics of CD4 + T-cell peak responses were fairly uniform, in most dogs responses peaked on day 14, cTrp-1-specific CD95 + CD4 + T cells came up earlier and peaked on day 7 in two dogs, while one dog showed a delayed peak response by day 42 (Fig. 5a, b) .",

One canine cancer vaccine, Oncept\u00ae, a xenogeneic DNA vaccine encoding human tyrosinase protein, has been developed and is licensed in the US for treatment of dogs with malignant melanoma [27] . This vaccine, based on a DNA vector, was generally well tolerated in a study of 111 dogs. No systemic reactions occurred other than local hematomas and pain at the injection site [4] . Initial studies indicated that Oncept \u00ae improved the dogs' prognosis [27] . In another retrospective study, medical records from 45 dogs were reviewed, including 30 dogs with stage II and III disease treated with the Oncept \u00ae vaccine after appropriate achievement of locoregional cancer control. The review found that dogs that received the vaccine did not achieve a greater progression-free survival, disease-free interval, or median survival time than dogs that did not receive the vaccine [28] . Similar results were obtained in a study conducted in the UK [29] . The vaccine was shown to induce a B-cell response, which is unlikely to limit melanoma progression. Another canine melanoma vaccine, termed K9-ACV, based on autologous tumor lysate; also induced antibody responses and was reported to improve survival in some dogs [30] . Additional vaccines targeting other types of common canine cancers have produced promising results [31] [32] [33] [34] , underscoring the use of vaccines as a viable option for treatment of dogs with cancer.",

            "text": "Here, we describe the results of a preclinical dog trial that assessed the safety and immunogenicity of a checkpoint blockade cancer vaccine. Our efforts focused on melanoma using a combination melanoma vaccine based on AdC68 vectors expressing MAAs fused into the checkpoint inhibitor gD combined with a second vector expressing mFAP for induction of T cells against CAF. A similar vaccine demonstrated efficacy in melanoma-bearing mice [23] . AdC68 vectors were chosen as vaccine delivery vehicles as previous studies showed that they are exceptionally immunogenic and induce very potent and sustained transgene product-specific CD8 + T-cell responses [35] . It should be pointed out, however, that an AdC68-based vaccine, unlike a DNA vaccine, should only be given once because neutralizing antibodies induced against the vaccine carrier will reduce its efficacy upon repeated administration. This can be overcome using a serologically distinct Ad vector for a booster immunization [36] . Dogs are commonly immunized against canine adenovirus serotype 2 (CAV-2) or acquire neutralizing antibodies to CAV-2 upon natural infections [37] . Neutralizing antibodies to adenoviruses are serotyope-and speciesspecific, and such antibodies should thus not interfere with the immunogenicity of a chimpanzee-derived Ad vector [38] . FAP is highly conserved between different species. It is expressed on fibroblasts within human or canine cancers [39] and was, therefore, selected to target the tumor stroma. To increase responses to FAP, the vaccine expressed the mouse sequence, which shows 87% homology with the corresponding canine protein. FAP is selectively expressed on CAFs and at sites of wound healing or chronic inflammation [40, 41] . Previous studies in mice showed that FAP + fibroblasts are essential drivers of tumor progression [42] . Additional studies are needed to confirm that FAP expression and the role of FAP in targeting CAF are also crucial to inhibiting the growth of canine melanomas. Eliminating FAP + cells by CAR-T cells resulted in significant toxicity in mice [43] . Our approach of inducing T cells by a mFAPexpressing vaccine was well tolerated in mice and, as shown here, in dogs. mFAP was immunogenic in dogs and all the treated dogs developed CD8 + and CD4 + T-cell responses to this protein.",

            "text": "cTrp-1, which was shown to be overexpressed on canine melanoma cells [44] , was used as the vaccine antigen. In mice, this MAA induces a strong CD8 + T-cell response [22, 23] . To further increase the response and to preserve CD8 + T cell functions in dogs with melanoma, cTrp-1 was expressed as a fusion protein within HSV-1 gD. HVEM was first identified as a receptor for HSV-1 [45] . HSV-1 gD is a bimodal switch expressed on many cells, including antigen-presenting cells, that can interact with immunoregulatory molecules on lymphocytes [46] . Binding of HVEM to LIGHT or lymphotoxin provides stimulatory signals; binding to BTLA or CD160 activates inhibitory pathways [46] . Coactivators and coinhibitors bind to different domains of HVEM and can form a trimolar complex, in which signaling through coinhibitors dominates. The N terminus of HSV-1 gD binds to a site on HVEM that is close to the BTLA/CD160 binding site and thereby blocks immunoinhibitory but not costimulatory HVEM signaling [47] . As we have shown previously, vaccines that express antigens fused into the C-terminus of gD elicit enhanced T-cell responses that are linked to the blockade of the immunoinhibitory HVEM pathways [48] . Adjuvanting a vaccine antigen with gD is especially effective to augment CD8 + T-cell responses in aging mice [49] and in mice with advanced cancers [48] . The effect of gD is local at the site of immunization rather than systemic as are antibody-based checkpoint inhibitors, thus minimizing side effects. As expressed within gD, cTrp-1 was immunogenic and elicited both CD4 + and CD8 + T-cell responses in healthy dogs. We did not include a control AdC68 vector, expressing wild-type cTrp-1, and we can thus not assess if gD augmented the T-cell response to cTrp-1.",

In the latter species, activated CD8 + T cells can be identified by increased expression of CD95 while levels of CD28 expression distinguishe CD28 low effector cells from na\u00efve or memory CD8 + T cells that are CD28 high [50, 51] . Using these two additional stains revealed for both CD8 + and CD4 + T cells distinct populations of CD95 low and CD95 high cells with a trend toward increased frequencies of Trp-1and FAP-specific CD8 + T cells in the CD95 high gate. The CD28 stain only showed two distinct populations within the CD95 high gate of the CD8 + T-cell population and here, frequencies of Trp-1 and FAP-specific CD28 \u2212 T cells selectively increased at the day 42 time point, which may suggest that loss of CD28 expression on CD95 + CD8 + T cells might not necessarily reflect canine effector T cells, which would be expected to show maximal frequencies early after immunization.",
