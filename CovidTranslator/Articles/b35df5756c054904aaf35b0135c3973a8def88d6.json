We present sixteen cases of a homozygous IKBKB mutation (c.1292dupG) in infants characterized by early-onset bacterial, viral, fungal and Mycobacterial infections. In most cases, T-and B-cells were quantitatively normal, but phenotypically na\u00efve, with severe hypogammaglobulinemia. T-cell receptor excision circles were normal, meaning newborn screening by TREC analysis would miss IKBKB cases. Although IKBKB immune deficiency does not meet traditional laboratory based definitions for SCID, this combined immune deficiency appears to be at least as profound. Urgent HSCT, performed in eight patients, remains the only known curative therapy, although only three patients are survivors. Ongoing infections after transplant remain a concern, and may be due to combinations of poor social determinants of health, secondary graft failure, and failure of HSCT to replace non-hematopoietic cells important in immune function and dependent upon IKK/NF-\u03baB pathways.",

Infants were initially identified in the 1970s from two small northern Manitoba communities. In later years, infants from the neighboring province of Saskatchewan were also identified. In 2013, our group and collaborators identified the genetic defect in four patients as being due to a homozygous duplication mutation (c.1292dupG) in exon 13 of IKBKB, the gene encoding inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa B kinase subunit beta (IKK\u03b2, also known as IKK2) [1] .",

The active IKK complex, and specifically IKK\u03b2, phosphorylates the inhibitory protein I\u03baB\u03b1, resulting in release of cytoplasmic NF-\u03baB.

            "text": "Given the central role of the IKK/NF-\u03baB pathway in regulating both innate and adaptive immune responses, it is not surprising that patients with mutations in genes from this pathway manifest with primary immunodeficiency disorders [3] . Males with hypomorphic hemizygous mutations in IKBKG, which encodes for the NEMO protein and results in reduced NEMO expression, present with a combined immune deficiency that includes enormous allelic, immunologic and clinical heterogeneity [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] . Patients with hypermorphic gain of function mutations in NFKBIA [10] [11] [12] , resulting in reduced degradation of the I\u03baB\u03b1 protein, have also been shown to exhibit significant combined immune deficiencies. Furthermore, the IKK/NF-\u03baB pathway operates in both hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic cells, leading to the extra-immune findings seen in patients with defects in NEMO and I\u03baB\u03b1, such as ectodermal dysplasia and colitis. Similar to patients with IKBKG and NFKBIA mutations, the first four patients reported by our group with deficiency of IKK\u03b2 due to the c.1292dupG IKBKB mutation also presented with immune deficiency [1] . Since then, six additional patients from various ethnic backgrounds (including Turkey, Qatar, and the Arabian Peninsula) with different nonsense IKBKB mutations have been reported, with all patients presenting with early onset and profound combined immune deficiencies, but typically without findings of ectodermal dysplasia [13] [14] [15] . In our initial report, patients had normal to near-normal numbers of T-and Bcells of an almost exclusively na\u00efve phenotype, severe hypogammaglobulinemia, and activation defects to a variety of stimuli in a number of immune cells, both innate and adaptive, more suggestive of a global functional defect as opposed to a quantitative lymphocyte deficiency [1] .",

Data collected by retrospective chart review included clinical presentation, immunologic features, and HSCT approaches and outcomes. Although data was complete for patients diagnosed in a contemporary era (after 2000), data availability was variable for some patients before this . Young infants of Northern Cree descent from the known affected communities presenting with a clinical picture consistent with a severe immune deficiency but without genetic confirmation of an IKBKB mutation were considered highly suspected if they also had a close familial relationship to a genetically confirmed infant with the mutation (e.g. sibling, or second-degree relative where there was known consanguinity within the family). We chose to report the decade of diagnosis (instead of year) to provide the reader with perspective on the immunologic investigations and treatments available at the time, while protecting against the potential for inadvertently identifying individuals, given that patients and their families reside in small communities. Detailed family trees documenting consanguineous relationships within families have not been included for the same reason.",

We believe that IKBKB immune deficiency, although not meeting conventional laboratory-based diagnostic criteria for SCID [19] (due to higher CD3 T-cell counts, moderately decreased to normal PHA responses, normal TRECs, high proportions of na\u00efve CD45RA+ T-cells, and low CD45RO+ T-cells in IKBKB immune deficiency), is as severe an immune deficiency as SCID at a clinical level. We would suggest therefore, that inclusion of IKBKB deficiency under the descriptive category of \"combined immune deficiencies generally less profound than SCID\" in the most recent 2017 International Union Immunologic Societies classification [20] , likely underestimates the severity of the immune deficiency and should be modified in future iterations.",

At least 14 patients with germline gain of function mutations in NFKBIA have been reported, with a severe but more variable clinical and immune phenotype that appears dependent upon the genotype (with missense mutations resulting in a more severe clinical phenotype) [21] . Like IKBKB immune deficiency, patients with hypermorphic NFKBIA mutations that result in reduced degradation of I\u03baB\u03b1, present with multiple and severe bacterial, fungal and viral infections starting at an early age, typically before 3-months. Infections reported include invasive bacteria such as Klebsiella, Pseudomonas, Haemophilus influenzae, and Staphylococcus aureus, Mycobacteria (including vaccine-strain BCG), as well as chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis, pneumocystis pneumonitis, and severe viral infections (rotavirus, norovirus, parainfluenza, RSV, CMV). Similarly, patients with NFKBIA mutations present with normal to elevated T-cell counts, an excess of na\u00efve CD4 and CD8 cells, and normal mitogen proliferative response to PHA in most. Dysgammaglobulinemia (usually with one or more quantitatively abnormal immunoglobulin isotypes), impaired response to vaccine antigens, and when tested, absent or reduced memory B-cells and class switched memory B-cells have also been reported. Unlike patients with IKBKB immune deficiency, however, almost all patients with I\u03baB\u03b1 defects show some degree of ectodermal dysplasia.",

In addition to infectious predisposition, patients with NEMO deficiency may present with autoimmunity (25%) and inflammatory conditions (most notably inflammatory bowel disease in 21%), features not described in either our cohort of IKBKB immune deficient patients nor in those with hypermorphic I\u03baB\u03b1 defects. As in patients with IKBKB immune deficiency, patients with NEMO deficiency commonly present with infections due to pyogenic bacteria (87%), Mycobacteria (44%), viruses (21%) and fungal and opportunistic pathogens (10%) [22] The median age at HSCT for a large cohort of NEMO deficient patients was 3.3 years old (range: 4.4 months -18.8 years), an age that is older compared to our cohort, suggesting NEMO deficiency may be a less severe immune deficiency relative to IKBKB immune deficiency [23] . NEMO deficiency also has a more variable immunologic phenotype, with hypogammaglobulinemia in only 24/41 (59%) and defects in specific antibody production in 18/28 (64%). Similar to IKBKB immune deficiency, most patients with NEMO deficiency have normal to elevated CD4 and CD8 counts, and 91% have normal mitogen induced proliferations [22] .",

Given the severe clinical phenotype of IKBKB immune deficiency, a pilot project of targeted newborn screening by direct genetic mutation analysis of Guthrie cards for the IKBKB mutation was developed in select Northern Cree communities in Manitoba. This investigation identified a carrier frequency of 1 in 13.1 newborns, with a predicted mutation homozygosity of 1/686 births [24] . Over 5-years (2013-2018), 760 newborns from two communities were screened, with one infant identified at birth (patient 15) and a subsequent sibling (patient 16) identified in-utero. Both were placed in protective isolation after birth and received HSCT at an early age, before the onset of serious infections, important variables associated with excellent outcomes in SCID HSCT [25, 26] . In other populations with founder mutations or high rates of consanguinity, a similar genetic-based newborn screening strategy such as ours might be applicable.",

This illustrates a complex interplay between what we suspect are ongoing defects in immunity post-HSCT, combined with poor social determinants of health. For familial and cultural reasons, our patients often have strong desires to return home soon after HSCT, and the tertiary care HSCT center is not easily accessible from their remote communities. With the death of patient 15, and with the recent transplant of patient 16, we have instituted a program of housing the family close to the tertiary care center for at least 1.5 years post-HSCT, as well as regular immunoglobulin replacement and indefinite daily anti-pneumococcal antibiotic prophylaxis.",

From our previous investigations, the broad immune defects relate to abnormal IKK/NF-\u03baB signaling in T-cells, B-cells and innate immune cells, resulting in generalized activation defects to a variety of stimuli [1] . With the exception of regulatory T-cells and gamma-delta T-cells, which are absent in IKBKB immune deficiency, other lymphocyte subsets appear to develop normally. Despite thymic hypoplasia in five of our patients who died either prior to or after HSCT, six other patients had normal TREC levels at the time of diagnosis, suggesting no intrinsic defect in T-cell development and maturation within the thymus. Unfortunately, none of the patients who had autopsies performed had detailed TREC analysis, making direct correlation with the underdevelopment of the thymus and TREC levels in a single patient impossible. Detailed T-cell studies were not available for most of our patients pre-HSCT, but when previously studied in one patient (and in one additional patient in this series), the T-cell receptor beta-chain variable region repertoire was polyclonal [1] . We are unable to resolve this apparent contradiction in the autopsy and immunologic findings, and believe it warrants further study. Likewise, when studied in two patients, kappa-deleting recombination excision circles (KRECs) in dried blood spots from newborn Guthrie cards of two patients were found to be normal, suggesting normal B cell development.",

Although such cells are not derived from hematopoietic stem cells, they are nonetheless integral to lymphoid organogenesis, such as in the development of lymph nodes, Peyer's patches, splenic marginal zones, follicular dendritic cells, and the formation of germinal centers in the spleen, which were absent. Further, the immune defect in this model was not fully corrected by HSCT. It is reasonable to suspect, therefore, that similar architectural cell dysfunction with resultant disruption of the immunologic niche could also play a role in IKBKB immune deficiency. Failure to correct non-immune cells with HSCT could explain the ongoing infectious complications seen years after an otherwise apparently successful, lymphoid engrafted transplant in IKBKB immune deficiency. The absence of splenic germinal centers and lack of tonsils and lymphoid tissues in the autopsies of patients who died post-HSCT, and absent specific vaccine responses despite excellent donor T-and B-cell chimerism, supports that HSCT does not fully correct all aspects of the immune deficiency in IKBKB.",

In our series, two of the three patients surviving HSCT had serious life-threating infections before transplant, including a case of multiple Serratia marcescens intracerebral abscesses, where the long-term neurocognitive outcome was initially unclear. We have tended to be aggressive with antimicrobials and other supportive care measures, with the goal of reaching HSCT as quickly as possible.

Of interest, one of our long-term survivors who was fully engrafted developed primary Mycobacterium tuberculosis pulmonary disease at 14-months post-HSCT. With appropriate therapy, the infection resolved, suggesting HSCT corrected enough of the immune deficiency. In contrast to our post-HSCT patients with IKBKB immune deficiency, Miot et al. found that bacterial infections only recurred at > 6-months post-HSCT for NEMO deficiency in 2/27 patients [23] . We hypothesize that failure of HSCT to improve all aspects of innate and adaptive immune function after transplant, as shown by the number of ongoing serious bacterial and Mycobacterial infections and lack of protective specific antibody responses to vaccinations, could be because HSCT does not correct cells of non-hematopoietic origin important in the immune response that are also dependent upon IKK/NF-\u03baB signaling. A similar pattern of incomplete immune correction and ongoing bacterial and viral infections after HSCT has been reported in a patient with the related autosomal dominant anhidrotic ectodermal dysplasia with immune deficiency due to hypermorphic I\u03baB\u03b1 defect [28] .",

Median CD4 T-cell count (11 patients) was 2490 cells/\u03bcL (range: 120-6520 cells/\u03bcL) and median CD8 T-cell count (11 patients) was 1660 cells/\u03bcL (range: 100-2654 cells/\u03bcL), with 6/11 patients having at least one of the CD4 and/or CD8 T-cell count above the normal range for age. Maternal engraftment studies were performed at diagnosis in eight patients, with none showing evidence of maternal engraftment. Median CD19 B-cell count (11 patients) was 750 cells/\u03bcL (range: 100-3470 cells/\u03bcL), being low in two, normal in eight, and elevated in one. Median CD56 NK-cell count (10 patients) was 240 cells/\u03bcL (range: undetectable -1090 cells/\u03bcL), being low in three and normal in seven.Despite generally normal to elevated T-and B-cell numbers in most IKBKB immune deficiency patients, all infants presenting with infections were severely hypogammaglobulinemic (n = 12), with a median IgG level of 0.75 g/L (range: undetectable -2.06 g/L). The two infants identified as newborns both had normal IgG levels immediately after birth, likely reflecting maternal placental transfer of IgG.",
