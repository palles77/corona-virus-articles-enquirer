The cytopathic strains of this virus (cpBVDV) induce dramatic cytoplasmic vacuolization in cell cultures, while infection with the non-cytopathic (NCP-BVDV) strains produces no overt changes in the host cells. Our results show that extensive cytoplasmic vacuolization is the earliest morphological change in response to cpBVDV infection in MDBK cells. Cells with extensive vacuolization showed no co-existing chromatin condensation, caspase activation, or loss of membrane integrity. In addition, the caspase inhibitor (zVAD-fmk), although improving cell viability of infected cells from 6.7\u00b12.2% to 18.8\u00b12.2%, did not prevent vacuolization. On the ultrastructural level, the virus-induced cytoplasmic vacuoles are single membrane structures containing organelles and cellular debris, which appear capable of fusing with other vacuoles and engulfing surrounding cytoplasmic materials. LysoTracker Red which marks lysosomes did not stain the virus-induced cytoplasmic vacuoles. In addition, this lysosomal dye could be observed in the cytoplasm of vacuolized cells, suggesting a lysosomal abnormality. Our data demonstrate that cpBVDV induced a novel cell death pathway in MDBK cells that is primarily associated with lysosomal dysfunction and the formation of phagocytic cytoplasmic vacuoles, and this mode of cell death is different from apoptosis and necrosis.",

            "text": "Bovine Viral Diarrhea Virus (BVDV) is a positive sense, single-stranded RNA virus that belongs to the Flaviviridae family (Collett et al., 1988) . BVDV is known to cause severe lesions in the gastrointestinal tract and death in affected animals (Bolin et al., 1985 , Brownlie et al., 1984 . Two biotypes, cytopathic (cpBVDV) and noncytopathic (ncpBVDV), can be isolated from infected animals exhibiting the classical mucosal disease syndrome (Brownlie, 1991) . However, only cpBVDV induces cytopathology in sensitive cell types, such as Madin-Darby bovine kidney cells (MDBK). cpBVDV induces dramatic cytoplasmic vacuolization in infected cell cultures and in tissues of infected calves (Bielefeldt Ohmann & Bloch, 1982) , commonly referred to as cytopathic effects (CPE) of cpBVDV . To date, the nature of this vacuolization during BVDV infection is not understood. Recently, it was suggested that cpBVDV-induced apoptosis is responsible for the virus-associated CPE (Grummer et al., 1998 , Zhang et al., 1996 . However, the morphology of apoptotic cell death is generally not associated with cytoplasmic vacuoles. Furthermore, although inhibitors of apoptosis, including zVAD-fmk, blocked apoptosis in cpBVDV-infected cells and significantly improved cell survival, they failed to achieve suppression of cytoplasmic vacuolization (Bendfeldt et al., 2003 , Grummer et al., 2002a .",

In addition, mitochondria in BVDVinfected cells appear to be normal, unlike mitochondrial abnormalities, such as swelling, that are observed during necrosis and necroptosis (Degterev et al., 2005) .

In addition, cells with extensive cytoplasmic vacuolization have morphologically normal nuclei, which are not brightly stained with the Hoechst dye. These data are in agreement with our electron microscopy study demonstrating that highly vacuolized cells do not show evidence of apoptotic bodies or chromatin condensation. Although, in agreement with other publications (Grummer et al., 2002b , Jordan et al., 2002 , Schweizer & Peterhans, 1999 , caspase activation was also observed at 24h post infection, but cytochemical examination showed an absence of caspase activation in cells with extensive cytoplasmic vacuolization ( Fig 6C) .

This does not appear to be the case for BVDV. Three classes of autophagy have been described: macroautophagy, chaperonemediated autophagy, and microautophagy. Macroautophagy and chaperone-mediated autophagy are normal cellular stress responses designed to remove and recycle misfolded proteins and damaged organelles (Cuervo, 2004 , Shintani & Klionsky, 2004 . Electron microscopy of macroautophagic responses reveals two subtypes of electron-dense macroautophagic vacuoles: autophagosomes and autophagolysosomes (Eskelinen, 2005 , Lawrence & Brown, 1992 both of which are double membrane-bound structures. These macroautophagic structures are also labeled with LysoTracker Red which is easily detected by wide-field and confocal fluorescent microscopy (Moriyasu et al., 2003 , Rideout et al., 2004 . Pharmacologically, macroautophagy can be distinguished from the other types of autophagy by its sensitivity to wortmannin and other phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3-kinase) inhibitors (Finn et al., 2005 , Petiot et al., 2000 . The BVDV-induced vacuoles are single membrane structures not labeled with LysoTracker Red.",

LC3 was found to be co-localized with LysoTracker-stained macroautophagic structures (Bampton et al., 2005) . However, further work on LC3 and macroautophagy indicates that LC3 could be incorporated into protein aggregates independent of autophagy (Kuma et al., 2007) . In addition, detection of macroautophagy-associated LC3 conversion (LC3 I to LC3 II) could be problematic because LC3 II tends to be much more sensitive to detection by immunoblotting than LC3 I (Mizushima & Yoshimori, 2007) . We chose not to pursue LC3 staining for the above reason and because the EM morphological studies, LysoTracker staining, and insensitivity to wortmannin clearly demonstrated that virus-induced vacuolization is inconsistent with macroautophagy. Chaperone-mediated autophagy does not exhibit cytoplasmic vacuoles and can only be detected with specific probes . Microautophagy (Kunz et al., 2004 , Muller et al., 2000 is defined as the sequestration of cytoplasmic components by direct invagination of lysosomal or vesicular membrane, followed by budding of engulfed small vesicular structures into the lumen of the autophagolysosomes containing cellular debris. This process is topologically equivalent to membrane invagination during multivesicular body formation and to the budding of enveloped viruses (Kunz et al., 2004) . Functionally, microautophagy is associated with macroautophagy, thus, counterbalancing macroautophagy-mediated membrane influx, which is essential for resumption of cell growth (Dubouloz et al., 2005) .",

We determined that the vacuoles in infected cells contain organelles' and cytoplasmic debris. Further examination of cytoplasmic vacuoles revealed that they are capable of fusing with each other and engulfing surrounding cytoplasmic components, suggesting that virus-induced vacuoles possess phagocytic properties. This morphological observation correlates well with extensive growth of vacuoles and disappearance of cytoplasm in infected cells, demonstrated at the level of light microscopy. This morphology is consistent with previously described microautophagy, where the cytoplasmic vacuoles seem to be the primary mechanism for sequestering cytoplasm and organelles in cells (Tuttle & Dunn, 1995 , Tuttle et al., 1993 , Veenhuis et al., 1983 , Yokota et al., 1993 . However, the phagocytic vacuolization response induced by the virus seems to be cytotoxic, which is different from postulated functional role of microautophagy for cell survival (Dubouloz et al., 2005) . In addition, because microautophagy is thought to be in a close association with macroautophagy, the absence of BVDV-induced macroautophagy could also suggest the absence of virusinduced microautophagy. Therefore, cpBVDV-induced cytoplasmic phagocytic vacuolization appears to be morphologically similar to microautophagy, but functionally it is different from previously described macroautophagy, chaperon-mediated autophagy, and microautophagy.",

Interestingly, a significant proportion of viral NS3, produced during infection with cytopathic BVDV strains, was found to be associated with smooth endoplasmic reticulum (Zhang et al., 2003) , known to be involved in the formation of lysosomes (Novikoff, 1976) .

Evidence has been presented to suggest that autophagy is induced by viruses to provide intracellular compartments and scaffolds to assist the replication process (Novoa et al., 2005 , Wileman, 2006 . BVDV provides some unique insight into this area in that two biotypes of the virus exist, one that induces extensive vacuole formation (cpBVDV) and the other which does not (ncpBVDV). Both biotypes replicate equally well to produce infectious progeny, which indicates that the formation of vacuoles is irrelevant to virus replication. The autophagy-like response in this instance may be more related to a cellular defense mechanism of an innate or adaptive immune response (Deretic, 2005) .",

            "text": "In conclusion, we demonstrate here that the autophagy-like cellular response is an early response to cpBVDV infection. This cellular response to the virus is different from apoptosis, necrosis, and recently described necroapoptosis. Virus-induced vacuoles possess phagocytic properties, responsible for digestion of cytoplasm and cytoplasmic components, suggesting that this form of vacuole-mediated autolysis could be named phagoptosis. Cytoplasmic vacuolization and apoptotic responses in cpBVDV-infected MDBK cells. Control and cpBVDV-infected cells were stained with Hoechst and FLICA dyes, for chromatin condensation and caspases activation, respectively, at 24 hour post infection. Vacuolized and dye-stained cells, were then analyzed and counted. Error bars indicate standard deviation for each specified analysis (n=3). A) Electron micrographic analysis of representative control, ncpBVDV and cpBVDV-infected MDBK cell 24 hours post infection. Large vacuoles (V), encapsulated by single membranes and containing cellular debris, are found only in the cytoplasm of infected cells. Mitochondria and nuclei appear to be normal in infected cells. B) Ultrastructural analysis of representative cytoplasmic vacuoles found in infected cells. Large encapsulated vacuoles were found to fuse with each other, forming larger vacuoles (left panel). Some of cytoplasmic autophagic vacuoles were found to be in a process of engulfing cytoplasmic material (as indicated by arrows) (right panel). ",
