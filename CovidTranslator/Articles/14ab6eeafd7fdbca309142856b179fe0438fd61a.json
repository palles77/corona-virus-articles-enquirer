In this study, a genetically engineered Lactobacillus strain coexpressing the CSFV-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) epitope 290 and the VP2 antigen of PPV was developed, and its immunopotentiating capacity as an oral vaccine in pigs was analyzed.

            "text": "For vaccines against CSFV, the important role of humoral immune responses has been investigated, particularly in terms of neutralizing antibodies. For instance, pigs that were immunized with recombinant virus expressing CSFV E0 or E2 protein were protected against CSFV challenge (47) . In some cases, immunization of animals with recombinant virus expressing other CSFV proteins failed to induce detectable neutralizing antibodies, whereas the animals were protected against lethal CSFV infection, which indicated that virus-specific T lymphocytes participated in a protective immune response against CSFV (38, 44, 48) . Currently, cellular immune responses, especially production of virus-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL), are receiving more attention for their potential roles in developing efficient epitope vaccines against CSFV (18, 35) . Several CSFV-specific T-cell epitopes have been identified (3, 8, 32) . Of them, the epitope peptide 290 (KHKVRNEVMVHWFDD), located at amino acid residues 1446 to 1460 of the CSFV nonstructural protein NS2-3, could be advantageous, as it harbors a CSFV-specific helper T-cell epitope and a CTL epitope, which could elicit both CD4 \u03e9 and CD8 \u03e9 T-cell responses (3) . Therefore, peptide 290 is a promising candidate for an epitope vaccine for the control of CSF. Among vaccines against PPV, the inactivated vaccine is the one most often used to prevent and control infection, and humoral immune responses, in particular, neutralizing antibodies, play an important role. Therefore, the development of efficient vaccines that induce antibodies which neutralize PPV infection is desirable. The VP2 protein of PPV encompasses major antigenic domains and is therefore regarded as a promising candidate immunogen with the capacity to induce neutralizing antibodies (27, 41) .",

Although parenteral vaccination is usually efficient in eliciting a protective immune response, the parenteral routes generally fail to stimulate mucosal immune responses and cannot efficiently prevent the pathogens from entering the body via the mucosae. Therefore, efficient protection against mucosal invasion requires the development of new vaccines to induce protective mucosal immune responses at the infection point (17, 21) . In this respect, mucosal immunization has been proven to be an effective approach (9, 22) . Thus, it is necessary to develop efficient and safe antigen vectors that could trigger mucosal and systemic immune responses. One promising approach relies on the use of live vehicles (2) . Lactobacillus strains possess many properties that make them attractive candidates as antigens carriers for the presentation to the mucosae of compounds with pharmaceutical interest, in particular, immunomodulators and vaccines. Lactobacilli are well known for having beneficial effects on the health of humans and animals. In addition, lactobacilli can survive in and colonize the intestinal tract (1, 50) and, furthermore, induce a nonspecific immunoadjuvant effect (30) . The potential of live recombinant Lactobacillus to deliver heterologous antigens to the immune system has been investigated (14, 31, 33, 34, 36, 40, 51) , suggesting the feasibility of using lactobacilli as safe oral vaccines.",

In order to analyze the capacity of the recombinant strain Lc393-rE290-VP2 to protect pigs against CSFV infection, the vaccinated pigs were challenged orally with a lethal dose (10 5 TCID 50 /animal) of CSFV strain Shimen on the 35th day after the first immunization, and the pigs immunized orally with Lc393:pPG612.1 or PBS were used as controls. Results demonstrated effective protection (86.7%) against CSFV challenge performed on day 35 in vaccinated pigs, while control groups of pigs developed severe clinical symptoms of CSF after viral challenge and were euthanized when moribund at 9 days after the challenge infection (Fig. 5 ). In addition, the surviving pigs were fully protected against an additional viral challenge performed on day 55, which indicated that the Lc393-rE290-VP2 was able to induce long-term protective immunity against CSFV. Vaccinated groups of pigs showed a virus challengeinduced fever peak from 4 to 6 days postchallenge, and on days 7 to 8 after challenge, the pigs recovered clinically from CSFV clinical signs, while the control groups developed severe symptoms of CSF with a high fever peak at 4 to 7 days after viral infection (Fig. 5) . Little virus was detected in vaccinated groups of surviving pigs on day 15 after challenge, indicating efficient viral clearance ( Table 2) .",

            "text": "At present, CSF is controlled by stamping out-methods and vaccination, or a combination of the two, but the eradication strategy has inevitably resulted in enormous economic losses. Though traditional CSFV avirulent vaccines, in particular the lapinized C strain of CSFV, have been successfully used in several countries to prevent and control CSF, the use of traditional CSFV avirulent vaccines has been banned since 1990 by the European Union, mainly because infections with vaccine and field viruses cannot be distinguished serologically (32) . Therefore, the design of new efficacious vaccines to protect animals against CSFV is being pursued. Previous studies have shown that a cellular immune response, especially production of CSFV-specific CD8 \u03e9 CTLs, represents an important defense mechanism in the elimination of cells infected by Lc393-rE290-VP2 3 10 2.3 10 2.0 10 1. 8 - - CSFV (32, 35) . Thus, further work should focus on the development of inducible CD8 \u03e9 CTL response vaccines against CSFV. PPV is a fairly ubiquitous virus that multiplies normally in the swine intestine without causing clinical signs. Initial PPV infection mainly occurs at the mucosa of the intestines (6). Therefore, the elicitation of an efficient immune response not only at the systemic but also at the mucosal level after vaccination is highly desirable (7, 46) and would represent a significant advantage in preventing PPV infection via the mucosa. This goal can be achieved only when the vaccination is administered by the mucosal route.",

            "text": "For virus vaccine research, one critical step is the identification of immune responses and immune defenses stimulated by antigenic subunits against infection in the host. Most investigations have concentrated on the role of the humoral immune response in CSFV-infected animals (45, 47) , while the cellular immune response is often ignored. The study of the cellular immune response to CSFV in the natural host is of the utmost importance for understanding the interaction between the pathogen and the swine immune system (3, 8, 32) . This is the basis for the development of vaccines to control CSFV infection. In this work, the capacity of Lc393-rE290-VP2 to stimulate CSFV-specific CTL responses in vitro and in vivo was analyzed. In the absence of any adjuvants, a CSFV-specific CTL response was detected in the intestinal mucosal tissues of miniature swine vaccinated orally with the recombinant strain, and no measurable CTL activity was detectable in nonimmunized animals, which indicated that the effector cells were able to recognize naturally processed epitope from the infectious virus and kill peptide 290-coated target cells. This result suggests that the local mucosal immunity induced by the recombinant strain, in particular the induction of a local CD8 \u03e9 cytotoxic T lymphocyte response, may control CSFV replication within local tissues prior to systemic dissemination. We also analyzed whether mucosal immunization with the strain could induce antigen-specific CD8 \u03e9 CTLs systemically, and a significant cytolytic response was observed. The result is consistent with previously described CTL activity in other studies (3) . Due to these promising results in vitro, the protective capacity of Lc393-rE290-VP2 was tested. Pigs immunized orally with this recombinant strain were effectively protected against CSFV challenge through induction of CSFV-specific major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I-restricted CD8 \u03e9 CTLs, while control groups of pigs developed severe clinical symptoms of CSF after viral challenge and were euthanized when moribund. In addition, Lc393-rE290-VP2 was able to induce long-term protective immunity against CSFV.",

Thus, an efficient PPV oral vaccine will have to induce specific immune responses not only at the systemic level but also at the mucosal level, in particular the mucosal IgA response against virus invasion via the mucosa. We evaluated the immunogenicity of Lc393-rE290-VP2 in pigs and found that both mucosal and systemic immune responses could be efficiently elicited after intragastric administration. As experiments to test for protection of gravid pigs against PPV challenge are difficult, in order to confirm the efficacy of the induced antibodies in inhibiting the virus, we determined whether intestinal lavage fluids and sera could inhibit the infection of ST cells in a plaque reduction neutralization assay. Serum and intestinal samples collected from vaccinated pigs demonstrated statistically significant inhibition, which would be a first step to give the proof of principle for the protection efficacy in the target species. Moreover, the availability of a live oral vaccine that can colonize the intestinal tract is important and desirable. In this study, we investigated the colonization potential of Lc393-rE290-VP2 in pig intestines and showed that the recombinant strain was able to persistently colonize the intestinal tracts, similar to its native counterpart, L. casei ATCC 393. As it is a probiotic bacterium, a long residence time in the intestinal tracts would prolong its potential beneficial health effects.",
