PCR may be performed on purified or crude DNA preparations; however, PCR efficiency may be compromised by cellular debris or contaminating extraction reagents in the case of crude preparations. DNA extracts from FFPE specimens are generally degraded. This is most likely due to DNA shearing during extraction as a consequence of DNA-protein cross-linkages induced during formalin fixation. 2 It is convenient to use a standard volume (e.g. 10 \u03bcl) of DNA extract in a PCR, although it may be more accurate to use a standard DNA quantity (e.g. 50-100 ng) as excessive DNA may inhibit amplification; too little DNA may also result in a falsenegative PCR result. 3 Buffer: pH is typically maintained using a Tris-HCl-based buffer at pH 8.3 under standard conditions; at higher temperatures the pH falls to \u223c6.8 which favours Taq DNA polymerase fidelity.

In practice, 100% (exponential) amplification efficiency may occur for only part of a PCR. 4 In the initial cycles, efficiency depends on the ease with which the primers, in a background of human genomic DNA sequences (that may have partial homology with the primers), find and hybridize with their specific target. Thereafter, exponential amplification may occur until limited by saturation events: PCR products outnumber the available thermostable polymerase and/or primers; these reagents are then insufficient to support amplification of each PCR amplicon previously synthesized.

Thus, during a PCR set-up at room temperature, primers may anneal nonspecifically with single-stranded DNA fragments occurring as a consequence of sample extraction procedures; this may seed DNA polymerase activity, resulting in amplification artefacts that become targets for further amplification during PCR cycling proper and significantly compromising amplification efficiency of the intended target. This potential defect can be avoided by using a 'hot-start' PCR approach. In hot-start PCR, thermostable DNA polymerase activity is 'activated' following the initial denaturation step. 5 Originally, this was accomplished by physically adding Taq DNA polymerase into a reaction (overlaid with oil) after a 5-min denaturation step preceding PCR cycling. Thermostable DNA polymerases have since been engineered for 'hotstart' PCR: enzymes are available that undergo a conformational change at high temperature, rendering them biologically active; alternatively, antibody-bound-deactivated Taq enzymes are activated by high temperature denaturation and release of the antibody.",

Empirical testing is usually required to find the optimal temperature. Temperatures at or above the T m may ensure better specificity at the expense of sensitivity. In 'touchdown' PCR, the initial annealing temperature is set some degrees (5-15) above the T m ; thereafter, the annealing temperature is reduced in 0.5-1.0 \u00b0C decrements per PCR cycle until T m\u22125\u00b0C . 6 This approach can help ensure that in the early stages of a PCR, primers anneal with their target with high specificity.

Whilst endpoint PCR can be semi-quantitative, it is essentially a qualitative assay. QPCR is used for the accurate quantification of a DNA or RNA/cDNA target in a sample. 4 QPCR requires a specialized thermal cycler that includes a light excitation source and a recorder of fluorescent signal output generated at each PCR cycle. PCR reactions are set up in microtitre plates rather than microtubes. Light emissions are collected via the thermocycler lid during the exponential PCR phase, where PCR efficiency approaches 100%. The ingredients of a qPCR are similar to a standard PCR but also require the inclusion of a fluorescence emitter. There are two main qPCR strategies. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) refers to a phenomenon whereby a donor fluorophore can transfer non-radiative energy to an acceptor fluorophore that is in close (<10 nm) proximity. 4 There are a variety of qPCR approaches that utilize FRET technology. The first and most widely used approach, 'Taq-Man', requires the use of an oligonucleotide probe that is complementary to a site within the amplicon ( Figure 6 ; and Resources section). The TaqMan probe is labelled with a fluorescent reporter dye (e.g. FAM (6-carboxyfluorescein)) at the 5\u2032-end and at the 3\u2032end with a fluorescent quencher dye (e.g. TAMRA (6-carboxytetramethylrhodamine)). During the annealing step of a PCR cycle, the TaqMan probe hybridizes to its target; FAM fluorescence emission is suppressed despite excitation due to the proximity with TAMRA. During the extension step, Taq DNA polymerase begins synthesizing DNA from the primer upstream of the probe binding site. Taq DNA polymerase possesses a 5\u2032\u21923\u2032 exonuclease activity, which cleaves FAM from the probe and also degrades the probe as extension proceeds. No longer juxtaposed with the TAMARA quencher, FAM fluorophore emissions can be measured. Other FRET-based qPCR assays use 'molecular beacon' or 'scorpion' probes. 4 With both the SYBR \u00ae Green I and FRET approaches, an increase in fluorescence emissions is recorded at each PCR cycle and the cycle-by-cycle data collection is the basis for quantitative interpretations.",

There is also a range of AD disorders characterized by abnormal nucleotide repeat unit expansions. Microsatellite repeat sequences (also called short tandem repeats (STRs) and 2-6 bases in length), are common throughout the human genome. In the early 1990s, it was found that a number of neuromuscular diseases were associated with an abnormally high number of trinucleotide repeat units. For example, patients with Huntington disease (HD) have excess numbers of a (CAG) repeat unit in the HD gene, IT15, located on chromosome 4p16.3. In normal subjects, (CAG) is most commonly repeated 10-26 times; in patients with HD there may be 36-121 repeats. 10 Other AD repeat expansion disorders include myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1), spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) and Friedrich ataxia (FRDA). The abnormal expansions are detected by PCR using primers that flank the region containing the trinucleotide repeats, followed by gel electrophoresis to gauge amplicon size; this assay may also be combined with Southern blot hybridization. Coagulopathy mutation-related disorders can also be screened by PCR: Factor V Leiden or prothrombin G20210A mutations are detectable by PCR-RFLP or by melt curve analysis performed in a real-time thermal cycler. 16 X-linked disorders: abnormal repeat expansions are also found associated with fragile X syndrome; gene duplications may be found with X-linked muscular dystrophy (Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD) or Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD)). X-linked point mutations may be found with BMD, DMD and Xlinked adrenoleucodystophy. ",

PCR is performed using primers that flank the microsatellite repeat region (and also include unique genomic sequences). The microsatellite units are repeated a variable number of times at a given chromosomal locus. Many of these microsatellites are highly polymorphic with respect to the number of repeats at a given allele and are also highly heterozygotic within the population. Analysis of the number of repeats and the extent of population heterozygosity allows calculation of the probability of matched microsatellite amplicons from different individuals. Typically, a minimum of four and up to 12 microsatellite loci are screened in PCR identity tests. For example, the GammaSTR \u00ae Quadriplex assay (Promega Corporation, Madison, WI, USA) amplifies four microsatellite-containing loci ( Figure 9 ); the probability that two Caucasian individuals will have matching amplicons at all four loci is 1 in 16,790. (If an additional eight loci are added, the matching probability is 1 in 3.03 \u00d7 10 11 .) In pathology practice, microsatellite PCR is useful in resolving issues of questionable specimen identity (Figure 9 ). Microsatellite PCR analysis is also performed for paternity testing and for monitoring the establishment of donor bone marrow tissues in a recipient. [10] [11] [12] 18, 19 Quality control Numerous PCR assays associated with pathology practice are in common or ad hoc usage; for example, the Mayo Medical Laboratories (Rochester, MN, USA) MayoAccess Test Catalog lists more than 200 PCR-based tests. 20 The application of these tests may be regulated by individual molecular diagnostic laboratories according to consensus criteria but may nonetheless vary in procedural details and interpretation from one institution to another.",

A patient biopsy sample contained a tissue fragment with features incongruous with other known clinical parameters for the patient. DNA was extracted from this fragment (Sample A) and compared with a DNA sample from the known patient (Sample B) using a microsatellite-based identity assay (GammaSTR \u00ae , Promega Corp, Madison, wi, USA). This multiplex PCR test involves primer pairs to four loci (on chromosomes 5, 7, 13 and 16) that include tetranucleotide repeat units and which generate amplicons in distinctive size ranges. The primers are labelled with a fluorescent dye and are detectable following capillary gel electrophoresis in a genetic analyser system. Although there were matched amplicons from samples A and B at the D13S317 locus, the known patient (B) was heterozygous at each of the four loci (indicated by two peaks (measured in fluorescent units)), whereas sample A was homozygous at two of the loci (indicated by one peak); additionally, there were amplicon size differences as indicated. in this example, allele sizes differ by one or two tetranucleotide repeat units. The data confirmed the pathologist's suspicion of patient sample cross-contamination. (Note: The reduced level of amplification at the D16S539 locus is a consequence of using DNA extracted from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPe) tissues. DNA extracted from FFPe sources tends to be degraded and consequently there are fewer full-length copies of larger target sequences compared to shorter ones in the starting sample.)",

The probe is labelled with a fluorescent reporter molecule (R) and a quencher molecule (Q) that suppresses fluorescence when in juxtaposition with the reporter due to FReT. During the extension phase of PCR, DNA polymerase exonuclease activity degrades and the probe and releases the reporter molecule from the quencher. The fluorescence can be recorded after each PCR cycle following excitation.",

DNA was extracted from this fragment (Sample A) and compared with a DNA sample from the known patient (Sample B) using a microsatellite-based identity assay (GammaSTR \u00ae , Promega Corp, Madison, wi, USA). This multiplex PCR test involves primer pairs to four loci (on chromosomes 5, 7, 13 and 16) that include tetranucleotide repeat units and which generate amplicons in distinctive size ranges. The primers are labelled with a fluorescent dye and are detectable following capillary gel electrophoresis in a genetic analyser system. Although there were matched amplicons from samples A and B at the D13S317 locus, the known patient (B) was heterozygous at each of the four loci (indicated by two peaks (measured in fluorescent units)), whereas sample A was homozygous at two of the loci (indicated by one peak); additionally, there were amplicon size differences as indicated. in this example, allele sizes differ by one or two tetranucleotide repeat units. The data confirmed the pathologist's suspicion of patient sample cross-contamination. (Note: The reduced level of amplification at the D16S539 locus is a consequence of using DNA extracted from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPe) tissues. DNA extracted from FFPe sources tends to be degraded and consequently there are fewer full-length copies of larger target sequences compared to shorter ones in the starting sample.)",

PCR may be combined with SSCP gel analysis or sequencing for the definitive confirmation of mutation status. PCR screenings may also be performed in the diagnosis of hereditary non-polyposis colon cancer (HNPCC) for the detection of microsatellite instability (MSI). PCR is performed for a panel of mono-and di-nucleotide repeats using fluorescent dye-labelled primers. Following polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in conjunction with an LIF detector, MSI is demonstrated by multiple extra 'peaks'. Instead of a single peak indicating an amplicon of predicted size, there are multiple additional peaks differing in size by one or two nucleotides. PCR-based analysis of mutations to mismatch repair (MMR) genes MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS1 or PMS2 may also be performed in the diagnosis of HNPCC. tumours: the search for molecular diagnostic tests with high clinical utility for application to sporadic carcinomas is an ongoing investigation.
