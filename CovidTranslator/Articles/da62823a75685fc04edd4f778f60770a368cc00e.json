            "text": "To define the origin and evolution of recent avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) in Japan, a genetic analysis was performed. By phylogenetic analysis based on the S1 gene including the sequence of the hypervariable regions, IBV isolates in Japan were classified into five genetic groups, which included two already-known groups (Mass and Gray). Among them, three major genetic groups were associated with the recent outbreaks of IB in Japan. One group is indigenous to Japan and could not be placed within the known existing groups in other countries. The remaining two groups, which have emerged recently, are related to isolates in China and Taiwan. * Infectious bronchitis (IB), which is caused by the IB virus (IBV), is one of the most highly infectious and contagious pathogens of chickens worldwide [4] . The primary tissue of IBV infection is the respiratory tract, though some isolates also replicate in the kidney and oviduct, resulting in nephritis and reduced egg production, respectively. Generally, IB has been controlled with serotype-specific vaccines, but outbreaks of IB still occur because vaccines offer little or no crossprotection between serologically distinct viruses [10] . A high mutation frequency and RNA recombination leads to the emergence of new viruses capable of causing disease in vaccinated chickens [24] . It is extremely important to identify field isolates for the selection of vaccines. Members of the Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) species, which is included in the family Coronaviridae, are enveloped and positive-stranded RNA viruses containing a genome of approximately 27-kb [1]. IBV has three major virusencoded structural proteins, which include the spike (S) glycoprotein, the membrane (M) protein, and the nucleocapsid (N) protein. The spike of IBV is formed by",

Moreover, the antigenic variants emerging from wild-type or vaccine viruses by point mutation or RNA recombination cannot be detected by VNTs [11] . Recently, genetic grouping of IBV on the basis of nucleotide sequences have been applied for virus classification [15, 16] . Since anyone can apply the genetic information of viruses deposited into the GenBank, genetic comparison with other virus strains for epidemiological analysis can be performed quickly.",

Dendrogram of the S1 glycoprotein of infectious bronchitis viruses. Amino acids 1-207 (in GenBank accession number P11223) of the Beaudette strain S1 glycoprotein were used for phylogenetic analysis at the amino acid level. The dendrogram is rooted to murine hepatitis virus ML-10 strain. Horizontal distances are proportional to the minimum number of amino acid differences required to join nodes and sequences of the PCR products of the five genetic groups in this study, as revealed by two restriction endonucleases are shown in Table 2 and Fig. 3 . Each Japanese genetic group has a specific profile pattern. The other genetic groups represented, such as Connecticut, D207, UK/4/91, and Ark99, do not have sites for these two enzymes in their reported sequences. Hence, the three major genetic groups in Japan were easily differentiated from other genetic groups. Recently, novel IBV strains have been proliferating abroad, and genetic analysis of these strains have been mainly based on the S1 gene [25] . IBV strains in Japan have been considered variants different from foreign IBVs such as Massachusetts or Connecticut types by VNT or PCR-restriction enzyme fragment length polymorphism based on the S2 gene [9, 17, 18] . Still, it remains unknown whether the current IBV isolates in Japan were newly introduced from other countries or whether they arose by mutations of circulating Japanese IBV strains.",

Although sequencing is recommended to obtain precise genetic information, restriction endonuclease analysis is simple, easy and convenient for primary characterization in routine diagnosis. Among these genetic groups, three major genetic groups were associated with recent outbreaks of IB in Japan. A previously published study divided IBV strains into several distinct genetic groupings by analyzing the S1 gene [25] . However, most IBV isolates in Japan formed genetic groups distinct from these. Among three major genetic groups of IBV in Japan, one group (JP-I) has not been found in other countries; this group may be indigenous and has been prevalent in Japan for a long time, from at least the 1960s. The other two groups that have emerged recently (JP-II and JP-III) are related to isolates in China and Taiwan. Recent IBV isolates in China and Taiwan also form distinct genetic groups [26, 27] . It is unknown whether these genetic groups originated in Japan or in these neighboring countries. Interestingly, recently isolated Newcastle disease viruses in Japan were also closely related, genetically, to those isolated in Taiwan and China [19] . Furthermore, it was recently revealed that the coronavirus isolated from pheasants was genetically closely to IBV [6] . One possibility for the migration of IBV strains into this region is dissemination by some kind of wild birds close to chickens, such as pheasants.",

In Japan, in addition to major Massachusetts (H120 strain) and Connecticut (L2 strain) type live vaccines, local attenuated vaccines isolated from outbreaks of IB in Japan have been developed and used. They proved to derive from the genetic groups, Mass, Gray, JP-I or JP-II, although the genetic backgrounds of these attenuated vaccines have not been clarified. So far, it has been suggested that the recombination events occur between vaccine strains and field strains [27] . It is unknown whether or not vaccine strains in Japan are associated with the emergence of recombinant viruses. To detect recombinant viruses, it would be required to analyze two or more different genetic regions of isolates. Further analysis of viruses would clarify whether recombinant variants have become prevalent in Japan.",
