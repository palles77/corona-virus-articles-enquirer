            "text": "Background: Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is an emerging infection caused by a novel coronavirus known as SARS-CoV, characterized by an over-exuberant immune response with lung lymphomononuclear cells infiltration and proliferation that may account for tissue damage more than the direct effect of viral replication. This study is aimed at investigating the capability of SARS-CoV to activate IFNa and -g expression in lymphomonocytes (PBMC) from healthy donors, evaluating whether viral replication is necessary for this activation. Results: SARS-CoV virus is able to induce both IFN-a and -g mRNA accumulation and protein release in a dose-dependent manner, MOI 10 being the most effective. The time course curve indicated that IFN-a mRNA induction peaked at 24 h.p.i,. whereas IFN-g mRNA was still increasing at 48 h.p.i. Released IFN (both types) reached a plateau after 24 -48 h.p.i. and remained rather stable over a 5-day period. A transient peak of negative strand viral RNA was detected after 1 -2 days of infection, but neither infectious virus progeny yield nor newly produced viral genomic RNA could be evidenced in infected cultures, even after prolonged observation time (up to 13 days). Cocultivation of PBMC with fixed SARS-CoV-infected Vero cells was even more efficient than exposure to live virus in eliciting IFN-a and -g induction. A combination of IFN-a and -g strongly inhibited SARS-CoV replication in Vero cells, while the single cytokines were much less effective. Conclusions: This study provides evidence that SARS-CoV is able to induce in normal PBMC a coordinate induction of IFN-a and -g gene expression. Virus replication is not necessary for IFN induction since efficient IFN expression could be obtained also by the cocultivation of normal PBMC with fixed SARS-CoV-infected cells. Concomitant activation of IFN-a and -g gene expression by SARS-CoV in vivo may be relevant for the pathogenesis of the disease, both for the possible involvement in immunomediated damage of the tissues and for the strong inhibition of SARS-CoV replication as a result of combined cytokine action.

            "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is an emerging infection caused by a novel coronavirus known as SARS-CoV Drosten et al., 2003) . The illness is characterized by inflammatory exudation in the alveoli and interstitial tissue accompanied by hyperplasia of fibrous tissues and fibrosis (Nicholls et al., 2003) . Destruction of lung tissue is thought to result from an over-exuberant immune response rather than from the direct effects of viral replication. Particularly, it has been shown that IFN-g may be activated in SARS patients (Wong et al., 2004; Cameron M.J. International Conference on SARS, Lubeck, May 8-11, 2004) , suggesting that proinflammatory cytokines may be associated with lung infiltration and proliferation of lymphomononuclear cells (Nicholls et al., 2003; Wong et al., 2004; Bauer et al., 2000; Beijing Group of National Research Project for SARS, 2003) . Another clinical feature of SARS is leukopenia (Wong et al., 2003) which may be consequent to the recruitment of lymphomonocytes from the periphery to the inflamed tissue. A short time after the onset of the disease, the presence of the replicative intermediates of SARS-CoV has been shown in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) taken from patients (Li et al., 2003) . In addition, SARS-CoV genome replication has been detected in PBMC in vitro (Ng et al., 2004) , and low titers of infectious progeny production have been observed in cultures of purified monocyte/macrophage (Yilla et al., 2005) . Minute and variable amounts of IFN-a have been detected in these cultures, suggesting a potential role of this cytokine in restricting SARS-CoV replication in monocytes in vitro. Recently, both macrophages (mf) and monocytederived dendritic cells (DC) have been shown to be unable to sustain productive replication of SARS-CoV, although initial phases of virus replication cycle have been detected in the latter cells (Tseng et al., 2005; Law et al., 2005) .",

The levels of IFN-a and -g mRNA in the cells and the corresponding cytokine levels in the supernatants were measured. The results of a representative experiments are shown in Fig. 1 and indicated that SARS-CoV is able to induce both IFN-a and -g mRNA in a dose-dependent manner, being MOI 10 the most effective (Fig. 1a ). In addition, IFN-a mRNA levels reached a peak after 24 h, whereas IFN-g mRNA levels were steadily increasing at 48 h of culture (Fig.  1c) . The dose-dependence and the kinetics of IFN-a and -g release in the supernatants, shown in Figs. 1b and d, were consistent with the mRNA results. Released IFN (both types) reached a plateau after 24 -48 h.p.i. (Fig. 1d) and remained rather stable up to day 4 p.i., then started to decline thereafter (not shown). The response to SARS-CoV infection was consistently found in PBMC from different donors, although with great variation in the extent of response. To give an idea of this variation, individual results from 4 different donors, referring to one representative time and dose, are shown in Figs. 1e and g (for mRNA) and Figs. 1f and h (for immunoreactive cytokines). The stimulation of IFN response to SARS-CoV was observed in all experiments, but, as can be seen, the extent of response for mRNA varied from 3 to 45 stimulation over background and was even more pronounced when measuring cytokine levels by ELISA. The overall pattern of variation was not concordant for mRNA and ELISA at individual PBMC level, suggesting that it did not merely reflect the different activation state of PBMC from different donors.",

In Fig.  2a , the infectious virus concentration in PBMC infected at the various MOI is shown. A decreasing amount of infectious virus was observed along the whole study period, probably resulting from thermal inactivation of residual viral inoculum, suggesting the absence of newly formed progeny yield. Similar results were also obtained with mitogen (phytohemoagglutinin, PHA)-activated PBMC (not shown). To test if at least part of the virus replication cycle took place in PBMC, we measured the levels of both virus-specific minus-RNA strand and genomic RNA. A peak of minus-RNA strand could be visualized only at low MOI 0.1 due to high background in the inoculum at higher MOI, whereas genomic RNA quantification revealed a trend similar to infectious virus yield titration, with a decreasing residual inoculum detected along the whole observation period (not shown). To lower the background noise at high MOI, we repeated the infection experiments in PBMC from 3 additional donors and performed trypsinization and extensive washing of the cells after the adsorbtion phase. Under these conditions, we could clearly appreciate a peak of minus strand viral RNA in 3 out of 3 PBMC samples, ranging from 50-to 250-fold increase over background levels. In two PBMC samples, the peak was observed at day 1 p.i., while in one PBMC sample, it was observed at day 2 p.i. followed by a decline to background levels thereafter in all 3 cases. Fig. 2c shows one representative case. However, also in these conditions, no increase of either infectivity or genomic RNA could be appreciated, as shown in Figs. 2b and c. No damage of PBMC apparently occurred in such cultures, as assessed as both overall mortality and apoptotic cell death (never exceeding the background levels of 5 -6%). These results suggested the occurrence of an incomplete virus replication cycle in PBMC.",

In fact, recent results from another group indicated that SARS-CoV is able to infect in vitro PBMC and to determine virusspecific RNA production (Ng et al., 2004) . However, infectious viral yield was not tested in this paper. Here, we show that, under our experimental conditions, productive viral replication does not occur in PBMC, although initial phases of virus infection take place. In fact, both viral infectivity and genomic RNA progressively decreased along the observation time. Even after removal of background levels by trypsinization, we failed to detect any increase of both infectious progeny yield and genomic RNA. However, removal of background noise allowed us to consistently detect a peak of newly formed negative strand at day 1 or 2 p.i., declining thereafter. These findings suggest that, under these conditions, initial phases of virus replication started in PBMC, but the cycle did not progress to completion. No damage of PBMC apparently occurred in such cultures, as assessed as both overall mortality and apoptotic cell death, further supporting the absence of virus replication in bulk PBMC cultures. These results remind what has been observed in two recent studies in blood mononuclear cell cultures (Tseng et al., 2005; Law et al., 2005) . Particularly, in the study by Tseng et al., the infectious virus titer progressively decreased, and viral subgenomic RNA was not produced in primary mf or monocyte-derived DC. The authors conclude that in these cells SARS-CoV fails to establish productive infection, although affecting some functions of both cell types (Tseng et al., 2005) . Similarly, Law et al. did not observe production of infectious virus yield in DC, although initial phases of viral replication seemed to occur (Law et al., 2005) .",

Virus titration was performed on Vero E6 cells with limiting dilution assay, and the results expressed as TCID 50 /ml (sensitivity 1 Log TCID 50 /ml). The virus stock titer was 10 8 TCID 50 /ml.",

In some experiments, PBMC were exposed to trypsin (0.5 mg/ ml) for 3 min after removal of virus inoculum, washed 3 times, and then reseeded. At days 5 and 10, half amount of medium was replaced with fresh complete medium. At the indicated times, total cellular RNA was extracted by Trizol (Life Technologies, NY, USA), according to the manufacturer's protocol. In parallel, whole clarified culture lysates, obtained by three cycles of freeze -thawing, were assayed for virus titration on Vero cells, according to the method of Reed and Muench. Results were expressed as TCID 50 /ml. In some experiments, both PBMC unstimulated and activated with 0.5 Ag/ml phytohemoagglutinin (PHA) (GIBCO, USA) were used.
