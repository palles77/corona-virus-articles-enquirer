As a consequence, cities around flight hubs have been and are exposed to the rapid dissemination of imported infections, as was reported in the initial dissemination of HIV infection in North America, and more recently in the 2009 influenza pandemic. Similarly, outbreaks of cholera have been reported in travellers after long distance flights, and tourism has also been associated with the dissemination of infections such as measles, rubella, diphtheria, typhoid fever, and chicken pox, in addition to malaria and haemorrhagic fevers. Poor health conditions and crowding are associated with tuberculosis (TB), diarrhoea, tetanus, and other infectious events, which may be imported by migrants from areas devastated by war.",

Because they live longer and have a better quality of life than ever before, they may have more opportunity to travel and potentially encounter travel-associated infections. It has been estimated that up to one third of solid-organ transplant (SOT) recipients may travel to resource-limited countries within the first year post-transplant. 1 In a survey in North American transplant centres, up to 44% of haematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients reported travel outside the USA and Canada after transplantation. 2 A International Journal of Infectious Diseases 48 (2016) 104-112 significant number of immunocompromised patients may also be migrants who may return to their countries of origin to visit friends and relatives, and may acquire travel-associated infections. The increased use of monoclonal antibodies for therapy in immunological and oncological diseases has created another at-risk population, although the actual risk of travel-associated infection in these patients is not well established. 3 Data on the real risk of infection in immunocompromised travellers relative to the general travel population are scarce, 4 and particularly the risk of developing an illness severe enough to warrant admission to an intensive care unit (ICU). The repatriation of immunocompromised patients from hospitals in destination countries also carries the risk of contamination of the receiving hospital with multidrug-resistant (MDR) microorganisms, which requires specific infection control measures. 5 This article also addresses certain specific syndromes, such as pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) occurring after travel.",

The most profound immunosuppression occurs between months 2 to 6; historically, this is the period in which most opportunistic infections were diagnosed, including herpesvirus infections (cytomegalovirus), Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia, and invasive fungal infections. 7 However, with the use of universal antiviral preventive strategies and long-term co-trimoxazole prophylaxis, opportunistic infections are currently rarely seen. After 6-12 months, the risk of infection decreases significantly and infections over this period are usually community-acquired, except in the case of increased immunosuppression (due to allograft rejection or dysfunction) or in the case of chronic surgical complications. Because the incidence of infection is higher early after transplantation, it is recommended to avoid travel during the first year. 8 HSCT recipients are at increased risk for bacterial and fungal infections during the engraftment period in the first month posttransplant. In the case of graft-versus-host disease, cellular immunosuppression is the mechanism responsible for the development of viral infections (particularly cytomegalovirus, adenovirus, and BK virus) and invasive fungal infections. 9 After the second year post-transplant it is considered that the degree of immunosuppression is non-significant if the patient has not developed chronic complications.

Several large cohort studies found patients receiving anti-TNF therapy to be at greatest risk of developing skin infections, although the overall risk of severe infections was similar to that of patients receiving other non-biological therapies. 10 A study from the Netherlands assessed the risk of infection in 75 travellers receiving biological agents relative to their travelling companions. 4 Immunocompromised patients were at significantly higher risk of developing skin infections, fatigue, and abdominal pain, but not fever, diarrhoea, or respiratory infections. Of note, no serious infection developed during or after the trip in these patients. Patients on anti-TNF therapy have an increased risk of developing mycobacterial infections, with several cases of disseminated TB with a fatal outcome reported in the literature. 11 Cutaneous leishmaniasis has also been reported in patients on anti-TNF treatment. 12 ",

While the risk of infection is higher during the first month following splenectomy, the increased risk persists for years. The risk of infection in asplenic patients depends on the underlying condition, being higher in patients with haematological diseases and in those in whom immunization may not be fully successful or is associated with suboptimal protection over long periods of time. Such patients may be instructed to start empirical antibiotics targeted at encapsulated bacteria immediately if any clinical signs or symptoms of infection ensue. 15 ",

A recent systematic review found that up to 45% of published cases of malaria in SOT recipients had at least one criterion for severe malaria (O. Manuel, personal communication). Importantly, malaria may develop through transmission from the organ donor, and as such there may not be a travel history. 16 A case of cerebral malaria with >50% parasitemia has been reported in a patient receiving infliximab; 17 however such severe disease can occur in patients not on biologicals as well. Malaria can also be more severe in splenectomized patients due to the lack of clearance of intraerythrocytic parasites.",

Those with severe disease deteriorate acutely after 4-5 days, with profound hypoxemia, shock, and often multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. The pathological findings are of an intense inflammatory/ haemorrhagic pneumonia, the severity of which seems to be influenced by the presence or absence of associated bacterial CAP. 28 Any patient with the above features, particularly if unvaccinated or having travelled to another hemisphere during the winter season, should be investigated for influenza, with diagnosis based on throat swab or nasal wash and a commercial kit based on antigen or RT-PCR. 29 Unfortunately there is very low uptake of influenza vaccine even amongst healthcare workers, and as such there remains a large pool of susceptible individuals.",

Yet, a recent prospective study from South Africa reported that 1.5% of adults with active TB may require mechanical ventilation because of refractory hypoxemia, which in high TB prevalence countries translates into a significant burden of disease. 40 In this setting, 15% of TB suspects had confirmed TB, and it should be considered if the travel history involves relevant exposure. Standard smear microscopy or culture are used for diagnosis, or rapid PCR if available (GeneXpert MTB/RIF), which has been shown to have increased sensitivity and shorten the time to treatment. 41 Where there is a high clinical suspicion of TB, empiric therapy should be initiated after adequate sampling has been obtained, particularly in the case of life-threatening or disseminated infection. Initial therapy with four drugs (isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol) is generally recommended where there is a low prevalence of resistance, and depending on the patient's origin and the results of the rapid detection of rpoB gene mutations. Patients with MDR-or XDR-TB need to be treated with second-line agents including aminoglycosides, quinolones, para-aminosalicylic acid, cycloserine, and clofazimine, and new drugs such as bedaquiline, linezolid, and delamanid.",

The substitution of coagulation factors is currently unclear due to the lack of appropriate randomized placebo-controlled trials. The use of antifibrinolytics during DIC should be avoided, as this drug class may lead to the deposition of fibrin in the vascular walls. 57 Overall, the prevalence of DIC during viral haemorrhagic fever is high and contributes to morbidity and mortality.
