Practically no compartmentalization was present in any of the enclosures except for a small separated area for kittens in one enclosure and one separated area for treatment of sick cats in the second enclosure. The original cats' population was formed by two main groups of animals: one formed of cats rescued during the evacuation of Israeli settlements in the Gaza strip in late 2005 and the other formed of cats raised in a shelter (cattery B) situated about 100 km to the north of cattery A and that was closed due to poor conditions. Small groups of cats were accepted to cattery A after its establishment. No history of vaccination was available for any of these populations. Prior to entry to the cattery, cats were castrated/neutered, but not vaccinated. The animals were feed with commercial cat food and received water ad libitum. Public access to the cattery was limited. A veterinarian visited the cattery approximately three times Veterinary Microbiology 144 (2010) 236-239 Streptococcus equi subsp. zooepidemicus (S. zooepidemicus) is a commensal of the mucous membranes and skin of animals, notably equine, and is associated with various infections in animals and humans. Here, we describe an outbreak of respiratory disease in a cattery, which, to the best of our knowledge, is the first report of S. zooepidemicus infection in cats. Clinical disease was characterized firstly by abundant purulent nasal discharges and cough, progressing to sinusitis, dyspnea, symptoms of pneumonia and death. Pathological examination revealed different degrees of inflammation of the lower respiratory tract. S. zooepidemicus was the main bacteria isolated. Sequencing of the V2 fragment of the 16S gene revealed that the isolates were distributed in two previously described genogroups.",

Because the vaccination status in cattery A was unknown, the possibility of S. zooepidemicus infection being secondary to viral infections could not be ruled out. Lesions suggesting feline infectious peritonitis were found in a few cases during the pathological examination, but the presence of feline coronavirus was discarded by immunohistochemical stains (data not shown). Lesions resembling feline distemper were also observed in a few cats, but most of these were not included in this report due either to lack of respiratory symptoms or S. zooepidemicus isolation. The prevalence of FHV-1 and FCV was not assessed, but we assumed that these viruses were most probably present in the cattery, as suggested by typical clinical signs of infection with these viruses in some cats. Infections by FHV-1 and FCV are limited mostly to the upper respiratory tract and although they may predispose to secondary infections they do not directly cause pneumonia (Greene, 2006) . Stress caused by the transfer and merging of different populations of cats in a single enclosure may have greatly predisposed to the respiratory infections reported here.",

Analysis of the V2 fragment of the 16S gene sequences and comparison to reference strains and published sequences revealed two genogroups described before (Baverud et al., 2007) (Fig. 1) . Israeli cat isolates belonging to the same genogroup showed 100% homology. Cat isolates in genogroup II showed a two nucleotide difference compared to S. zooepidemicus strain no. 14, which was isolated from a case of metritis in a mare. S. zooepidemicus isolates belonging to genogroup I were closely related to Streptococcus equi subsp. equi reference strains EF 406086, similarly to previous work (Baverud et al., 2007) . No correlation was found between genogroup and time of isolation during the outbreak. The earliest typed strains isolated Ct4/06 and Ct5/06 were clustered in genogroup II, but Ct6/06, which was isolated within 2 months from the above strains, was clustered in genogroup I. Since some strains isolated early in the outbreak were not typed, it is unknown which genogroup appeared first in the outbreak. In addition, no correlation between genogroup and virulence (as determined by source, dead cat or clinical specimen) could be found. One strain of S. zooepidemicus (Ct29/07) included in the molecular analysis was isolated from a fibrin purulent infiltrate in the brainstem region of the skull of a dead cat that was raised close to the place where cattery B was located. The owner of this cat volunteered in cattery B, but it is unknown if this cat was previously raised in that cattery. Cattery B was closed due to poor conditions and all the animals were transferred to cattery A at the time of its establishment. This population constituted most of the cats in cattery A at that time. Close to the place where that cat was raised there was a petting farm, with goats, sheep and other farm animals. It is possible that S. zooepidemicus has been introduced to cattery A by the population of cats brought from cattery B and that those cats were somehow infected either by direct contact with animals in the petting farm or through stray cats in the same region. Strain Ct29/07 was included in genogroup I, whereas early strains in the outbreak were included in both genogroups. By the time this communication has been written, only one other case of S. zooepidemicus outside the aforementioned catteries A and B was found. In this case, S. zooepidemicus was isolated from a nasal swab from a house cat (Ct30/07) and it was apparently not linked to the outbreak described here.",

The direct transmission of S. zooepidemicus from horses to a human has been suggested (Rose et al., 1980) and the zoonotic potential of this pathogen should not be over-looked. Based on the bacteriological and consistent pathological results described above, we concluded that S. zooepidemicus was the main etiological agent in this outbreak of feline respiratory disease. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of an outbreak of S. zooepidemicus infections in cats.",
