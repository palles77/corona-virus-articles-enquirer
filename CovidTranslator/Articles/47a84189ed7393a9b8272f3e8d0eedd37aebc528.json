            "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) presents an unprecedented diagnostic and therapeutic challenge to clinicians. Despite recent progress in identifying and analyzing the coronavirus that is responsible for it, few reports have addressed the clinical complications of SARS. The present study was a two-center retrospective cohort study. All patients in the study had SARS, were managed in the two major Hong Kong hospitals (ie, Prince of Wales Hospital and United Christian Hospital), and had developed spontaneous pneumothorax during their hospitalization between March 10, 2003, and April 28, 2003. Spontaneous pneumothorax was reported in 6 of 356 SARS patients who were treated at the two hospitals during the period. This represents an incidence of 1.7%. None of the six patients had a history of smoking or pulmonary disease. The rate of admission to the ICU was 66.7% and the crude mortality rate was 33.3% in this group of patients. There was a trend for the mean neutrophil count in these patients to be higher than in previously reported cohorts of comparable SARS patients (14.5 \u060b 10 9 vs 4.6 \u060b 10 9 neutrophils per liter, respectively). Conservative measures like tube thoracostomy or observation alone offered satisfactory initial symptomatic management in five of six patients. Spontaneous pneumothorax is a specific and potentially life-threatening complication in SARS patients. Patients with extensive lung injury, as indicated by severe clinical courses, and in particular high neutrophil counts, appear to be most at risk. The benefits of surgical management must be balanced against the potential risks to health-care workers. (CHEST 2004; 125:2345-2351 ",

He was a radiographer at PWH who had been in close contact with SARS patients for the 3 weeks since the initial outbreak. His chest radiograph showed diffuse bilateral pulmonary infiltrates at the time of hospital admission. Treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics, ribavirin, methylprednisolone, and convalescent serum was given with initial clinical improvement. On the 32nd day after hospital admission, he was noted to have a sudden increase in dyspnea. Chest radiography confirmed a left pneumothorax with parts of the left lung adherent to the parietal pleura as a result of postinflammatory adhesions (Fig 1) , creating several loculations of air and fluid within the left pleural space. The pneumothorax was managed with a chest tube. However, despite suction of 10 cm H 2 O from the chest drain, the chest radiograph showed that the left lung had only partially reexpanded, with several large loculations of air still remaining. A CT scan of the thorax confirmed the presence of loculated air pockets, which were not adequately drained, and showed diffuse, patchy inflammatory changes in both lungs, with a \"honeycomb\" appearance that was similar to that of mild bronchiectasis (Fig 2) . A pigtail catheter was inserted into the largest loculation under ultrasound guidance. The pigtail catheter then was replaced with another chest tube for better drainage, and both drains were set to suction at 10 cm H 2 O. Symptomatic relief of the dyspnea was achieved, with improved lung reexpansion seen on chest radiography. An air leak persisted from both drains but eventually resolved with conservative management after 21 days, after which both the drains were successfully removed.",

A left chest tube was inserted immediately with good symptomatic relief of her dyspnea. Suction at 10 cm H 2 O was applied, and subsequent chest radiographs showed complete reexpansion of the left lung and spontaneous resolution of the tiny right apical pneumothorax. She suddenly became more dyspneic again on the 31st day, and a chest radiograph showed a 50% right pneumothorax had recurred. A right chest drain was inserted, and 10 cm H 2 O of suction was applied. Although the chest radiograph showed good reexpansion of the right lung, she developed progressively severe respiratory failure with ground-glass lung infiltrations seen on her subsequent chest radiographs. She was intubated 2 days later and received mechanical ventilation. This appeared to exacerbate the air leakage from the right lung, with chest radiography showing a recurrent right pneumothorax. A second right chest drain was inserted, and both were set on suction of 20 cm H 2 O. Chest radiography confirmed complete right lung reexpansion, but her lung infiltrates progressed and she developed refractory hypoxemia. She died with intractable respiratory failure 4 weeks after ICU admission.",

In the presence of a new infectious disease, the means of transmission of which had not been determined at the time, this represented a serious consideration. In case 1, the abundance of pleural adhesions noted on chest radiograph and CT scan also would give rise to a difficult operation with the possibility of intraoperative bleeding and significant postoperative air leakage.

The ICU admission rate (66.7%) and the crude mortality rate (33.3%) were higher in these six patients than those in the 138 patients in the earlier study from PWH (23.2% and 13.8%, respectively). 2 That previous study from our institute also had identified absolute neutrophil counts and high peak LDH levels as independent predictors of adverse outcome in SARS patients. 2, 9 The mean neutrophil counts and mean peak LDH levels in the 32 patients with poorer clinical courses (those who were either admitted to the ICU or died because of SARS) were significantly higher than those in the other 106 patients not requiring ICU support. In our six patients, the mean neutrophil count was 14.5 \u03eb 10 9 neutrophils per liter, and the mean peak LDH level was 655.5 U/L. In comparison, the mean figures for the 32 patients with poorer clinical courses in the earlier study were 4.6 \u03eb 10 9 neutrophils per liter and 629.7 U/L, respectively. Patients with particularly severe clinical courses, and those with high peak LDH levels and neutrophil counts therefore appear to be the most at risk for developing spontaneous pneumothoraces. In particular, the trend for a higher neutrophil count in our six patients suggests that this may be an indicator for SARS patients who are at risk for developing spontaneous pneumothorax. Histologic findings appear to support the hypothesis of severe pulmonary injury predisposing the patient to spontaneous pneumothorax. In postmortem analyses of other SARS patients, including patients from both PWH and UCH, evidence of histologic damage to the lung tissue by the disease previously has been reported. 2, 9, 14 The pulmonary pathology has been reported to be dominated by diffuse alveolar damage with pulmonary edema and hyaline membrane formation. The diffuse alveolar damage may give rise to dilated, cystic airspaces in severe cases and a gross appearance of honeycombing. Such destructive changes may predispose the lung to air leakage from the rupture of the cystic lesions, with the consequent development of a pneumothorax. The frequent diffuse involvement of both lungs by these changes also could account for the occurrence of the bilateral pneumothoraces seen in three of our six patients in this series.",

It can be speculated as to whether aggressive steroid therapy may have a role to play in the pathogenesis of spontaneous pneumothorax in SARS patients. Indeed, the use of steroids to dampen the harmful inflammatory response has become one of the mainstays in the treatment of patients severely afflicted with SARS in Hong Kong. 7, 8 We note that the doses of methylprednisolone received by the six patients reported on are no higher than those given to other SARS patients at PWH and UCH with similar clinical presentations. However, therapy with steroids may delay wound healing and perpetuate air leakage. The high doses of steroids given to the patients in cases 1, 3, 4, and 5 may be partly responsible for the persistent air leaks observed in these patients.

WLL in patients with PAP has been associated with a reduction in dyspnea and improved physiologic parameters. 4 -6 The clinical and physiologic response to WLL has been attributed to the removal of lipoproteinaceous material from the alveolar space. 3 To maximize the effectiveness of alveolar clearance, we have modified our previously published technique. 6 -8 Our technique now focuses on large-volume WLL (ie, 40 to 70 L per lung), positional clearance with prone positioning for the last 10 to 15 L fluid, and assisted",
