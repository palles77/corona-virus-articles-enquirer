            "text": "Predicting the effect of different programmes designed to control both the morbidity induced by helminth infections and parasite transmission is greatly facilitated by the use of mathematical models of transmission and control impact. In such models, it is essential to account for as many sources of uncertainty-natural, or otherwise -to ensure robustness in prediction and to accurately depict variation around an expected outcome. In this paper, we investigate how well the standard deterministic models match the predictions made using individual-based stochastic simulations. We also explore how well concepts which derive from deterministic models, such as 'breakpoints' in transmission, apply in the stochastic world. Employing an individual based stochastic model framework we also investigate how transmission and control are affected by the migration of infected people into a defined community. To give our study focus we consider the control of soil-transmitted helminths (STH) by mass drug administration (MDA), though our methodology is readily applicable to the other helminth species such as the schistosome parasites and the filarial worms. We show it is possible to define a 'stochastic breakpoint' where much noise surrounds the expected deterministic breakpoint. We also discuss the concept of the 'interruption of transmission' independent of the 'breakpoint' concept where analyses of model behaviour illustrate the current limitations of deterministic models to account for the 'fade-out' or transmission extinction behaviour in simulations. The analyses based on migration confirm a relationship between the infected human migration rate per unit of time and the death rate of infective stages that are released into the free-living environment (eggs or larvae depending on the STH species) that create the reservoir of infection which in turn determines the likelihood that control activities aim at chemotherapeutic treatment of the human host will eliminate transmission. The development of a new stochastic simulation code for STH in the form of a publicly-available open-source python package which includes features to incorporate many population stratifications, different control interventions including mass drug administration (with defined frequency, coverage levels and compliance patterns) and inter-village human migration is also described. : medRxiv preprint",

Much progress in model formulation, * r.hardwick@imperial.ac.uk parameter estimation and application has been made over the last 20 years.

Independent of this breakpoint, a further epidemiological situation arises where only one stable equilibrium exists; namely, parasite and transmission extinction where the rate of infection is always too low to sustain the parasites in the human host. In this case transmission is interrupted, since an adult female worm in the human host on average, produces too few offspring to ensure one of her offspring matures in the human host to perpetuate the lifecycle. For many viral and bacterial infections (the microparasites), this is the situation where the basic reproduction number, R 0 < 1, where R 0 describes the generation of secondary cases. For the macroparasitic helminths, the concept of R 0 needs modification since it describes the average number of female offspring, produced by female worms, that survive to reproductive maturity by infecting a new human host and maturing within it [7] . The concept of R 0 is further modified by two density dependent processes: acting on fecundity as a population regulatory factor and acting via the dioecious nature of the worm. Because of the action of these two processes, the crtical R 0 value to sustain transmission is greater than unity in value. These two concepts are illustrated diagrammatically in Fig. 1 . Note, in particular, how the darker red shaded region -which demarcates the R 0 < 1 region -is replaced with a lighter shaded red 'breakpoint' region once these density dependent processes have been introduced.",

Even when the deterministic breakpoint is crossed, when its value is low due to high degrees of parasite aggregation in the human host (see Ref. [7] ), stochastic noise may induce fluctuations where bounce back or extinction occur [24, 25] . Similarly, even when transmission is interrupted when the average female worm produces too few offspring to ensure the continuation of the life cycle, stochastic noise may not always result in parasite extinction in a defined location. In this paper, we shall analyze these situations with the use of a full individual-based stochastic model and certain approximations to the fully-simulated outcomes. In particular what is novel in our approach, is both looking at noise around the breakpoint and the transmission interruption state, and assessing how the migration of infected humans influences the likelihood of achieving effective control or even transmission interruption by MDA.",

The deterministic predictions for the dynamics of the mean worm burden [7] and the mean of the mean worm burdens derived from individual-based simulations exactly match -see, for instance, the good match between dashed lines plotted in the left and right top panels of Fig. 2 , where we have plotted the dynamics of the mean worm burdens in a community with parameters in configuration C1 (see Table 1 ) for a range of population sizes.

This agreement is not always the case, however, as we illustrate with the same pair of plots but with different transmission parameters on the bottom row of Fig. 2 . Given configuration C2 (see Table 1 ), in which the endemic equilibrium value is situated closer to the unstable 'breakpoint' equilibrium, we find that an important phenomenon which exists in the individual-based stochastic simulation is not present in the deterministic model -this phenomenon is known as 'fade-out' in the parasite population. 'Fade-out' is where transmission is interrupted due to chance events, even when the underlying transmission success (the value of R 0 ) is above the level that deterministic models predict will result in parasite persistence. In other words, values just above the transmission breakpoint of the deterministic model may indeed move to parasite extinction, due to chance effects.",

However, the presence of the unstable 'breakpoint' equilibrium leads to a stronger fade-out effect as one can observe in the drift towards a zero mean worm burden (transmission interruption) of the lower 68% credible interval contour (and mean) in the bottom row plots of Fig. 2 with population sizes of 100 and 350, and which markedly reduces the accuracy of the mean field stochastic approximation. A simple Gaussian approximation notwithstanding, fade-out is a very important phenomenon of considerable practical relevance to the prospect of helminth transmission interruption. Note that the probability of a fade-out event also increases from very small to large as village population size decreases, as is also shown by the results of Fig. 2 . The inability of the stochastic noise approximation model to capture the fade-out phenomenon is of considerable interest and is requires a more detailed mathematical description of the stochastic dynamics of the reservoir of infection.

Furthermore, in the previous section, we highlighted some limitations in the standard formulation of deterministic models to account for the specific phenomena of population 'fade-out' (or spontaneous transmission interruption) which are present in the real world due to chance effects in population growth and decay especially when host population densities are low.

The plots in the left column -which correspond to configuration C2 -the probability for the number of net growers to be above 1 remains low even for a prevalence of 2%, which is to be expected due to this configuration's proximity to the unstable 'breakpoint' equilibrium. Furthermore, from Fig. 5 , it is immediately apparent that the expected number of growers is extremely unlikely to exceed 1 if the prevalence of infection is lower than \u223c 1% in all cases of population number. Hence, this threshold essentially acts as a 'stochastic breakpoint', below which the probability of interrupting transmission in stochastic individual-based simulations becomes very likely. Note that caveats to our analysis here include varying the population number well beyond the prior limits used in our short sensitivity analysis -in such situations it is possible for apparent thresholds to go much lower or higher, e.g., consider the small, but non-negligible probabilities of sustaining transmission below a prevalence of 1% for much larger population numbers than those studied here in Ref. [37] . It is important to also mention that the approximate bound we obtain on the prevalence as a 'stochastic breakpoint' applies as more of a strict bound and hence does not exclude the possibility (or even high likelihood in some specific configurations) of elimination at a higher prevalence of 2%.

(33) which introduces new egg pulses drawn from the ( j \u2212 1)-th age bin and removes eggs from the j-th bin into the ( j + 1)-th bin. The reservoir fluctuation model described above demonstrates how ageing can can only affect the system by a significant variation in k j between bins -furthermore, such fluctuations are can be shown to be damped significantly when the age bins are much wider than 1/(\u00b5 + \u00b5 1 ) due to the relaxation timescale of each individual Poisson walker (see, e.g., Eq. (17)). In light of this fact, we have elected to avoid a direct description of ageing in this work without loss of generality in our Figure 5 : The expected number of individuals who will gain more than one worm, or, 'net growers' given that effectively only one individual is contributing to the reservoir of infection per unit time for a range of different system configurations. These values have been obtained by randomly sampling configurations of Eq.

In metapopulation disease transmission models it is well-known that migration effects can stabilise local tranmission, evading effects such as fade-out even when the population sizes are small -see, e.g., Ref. [40] . By including migration from a cluster with configuration C1 (see Table 1 ) into the cluster depicted in the plot with configuration C2 (with 350 people each), in Fig. 6 we demonstrate that a similar stabilisation of the fade-out effect can also occur for helminth transmission models, despite the especially strong fade-out induced from the presence of the unstable 'breakpoint' equilibrium. As targets for helminth elimination trials drive the prevalence in regions closer to (and beyond) the unstable equilibrium, this is an important possibility to take note of with practical implications should migration within a given region be of the same order or higher as is indicated in Fig. 2 . Note that in order for this effect to be important, the migration rate needs to exceed the death rate of eggs/larvae in the infectious reservoir, i.e., r + , r \u2212 \u00b5 2 , which is an early confirmation of the conclusions drawn from Ref.

From these plots one can immediately see that a discrete transition occurs in prevalence after a critical UES migration rate has been reached and that this value changes according to population size. This transition marks the point at which the STH transmission is sustained endemically, and hence the UES migration rate that this corresponds to is of critical importance to policy makers and implementers of STH control programmes since achieving elimination above this critical point in migration rate is likely impossible without treating the external source of migrants simultaneously.",

Therefore, it is important that we state that the stochastic breakpoint that we derived in Sec. 2.5 only applies to situations where the prevalence of infection is lowered due to treatment, as opposed to being raised from a zero worm state due to UES migration. Such a difference in breakpoint prevalence value required between these two scenarios is due to the greater homogeneity in worm loads of individuals in the case of UES migration, as opposed to the case of post-treatment where a limited number of individuals have a large number or worms -the latter of which is more consistent with the negative binomial reservoir approximation used to derive the stochastic breakpoint in Sec. 2.5.

In three of the shown cases the C2 cluster is also experiencing migration from another cluster with a C1 configuration (once again, see Table 1 ) where the migration rates are indicated (using units of \u00b5 2 = 26 per year for hookworm). The treatment has been applied to both clusters and is 3 rounds of MDA with a random compliance pattern of individual behaviours assumed at 60% coverage (and 100% efficacy) in years 15, 16 and 17 of the overall 100. general for human helminths, the indication from modelling studies is that a true prevalence (based on the use of a very sensitive diagnostic) of less than 1% moves the dynamics of the system to the interruption of transmission. Defining the breakpoint and designing monitoring and evaluation programmes requires the use of stochastic individual-based models to determine this likelihood in terms of PPV and NPV values of the probability of transmission elimination or bounce back. It is therefore highly desirable to account for as many sourcesnatural, or otherwise -of uncertainty to ensure a high degree of confidence in the predictions made by such models. The effect of infected human migration in and out of health implementation units on control outcomes, is but one important example of a key source of heterogeneity.",

(A.2) using the Probability Generating Function (PGF) G jn (Z, t) \u2261 \u221e w jn =0 Z w jn P(w jn , t) such thatBy method of characteristics, 4 the solution to Eq. (15) iswhere the initial intensity I jn (t 0 ) is to be set for each individual. One immediately recognises Eq. (A.4) as the PGF of an inhomogeneous Poisson walker with intensitywhich matches Eq. (16) in the main text. For an ensemble of N j independent walkers (hence individuals) in a given age bin we may obtain the PGF of the sum of their collective worm burdens G j (Z, t) by multiplication such thatwhere the corresponding probability mass function is therefore also that of a Poisson distributionwhere we have also used the definition of the mean worm burden in the j-th age bin given by Eq. (4) in the main text. Note that in the case where \u039b j (t) is roughly constant for all time, the timescale for the distribution to achieve stationarity is \u2206t stat 1/(\u00b5 + \u00b5 1 ). 4 One solves first-order PDEs of the form in Eq. (A.3) by method of characteristics, i.e., choosing a curve Z(t) such thatGiven the fact that along the curve Z(t) one also obtains an effective ODE of the formAppendix B. Approximate ensemble mean and variance of the mean worm burdenThe approximate mean and variance of \u039b j (t) may be computed by inserting Eqs. (22) and (23) into Eq. (20) and its square, yielding the following equationsUsing Eq. (17) in the main text and Eq. (B.1), we may therefore compute the ensemble mean of m j (t), matches the solution to Eq. (12) in the rapid equilibriation limit dE(\u039b j )/dt \u2192 0 and hence verifies the consistency of our approximative results in this section so far.The ensemble variance of m j (t) may also be deduced asfrom the properties of independent samples. 5 By making use of Eq. (1) and assuming the relative independence of \u03bb jn and \u039b(t) once again, we haveand hence one may obtain E[I jn (t) 2 ], which is given by 6If one assumes temporal stationarity such that E[\u039b j (t)] = E(\u039b j ) and E[\u03bb 2 jn \u039b j (t)\u039b j (t )] = E(\u03bb 2 jn \u039b 2 j ), both time integrations in Eq. (B.7) are trivial and one obtains ",
