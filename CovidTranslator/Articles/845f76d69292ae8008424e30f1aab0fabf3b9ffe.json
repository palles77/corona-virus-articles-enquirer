            "text": "Donor centers are issuing a growing number of recalls and market withdrawals to hospital transfusion services about blood components. More than 1 in 2,000 units were recalled in the late 1990s in the United States. The most common reason for these notices from donor centers is postdonation donor information. Most of these units had been transfused, and many present a \"risk of a risk\" (ie, a problem might have been present that might have affected the recipient). A few regulations and standards address recalls in general terms, but transfusion services generally have wide discretion in the management of specific common recall problems. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is now including posttransfusion evaluations in its guidelines for emerging infectious threats to the blood supply. We suggest that hospital transfusion services should have standard operating procedures for managing recalls and that the hospital transfusion committee and the quality management program should provide local input or oversight. Using the FDA's categories of donor center biological product deviations, we provide recommendations to consider for when to notify the recipient's physician, after postdonation information is received about a previously transfused blood component. More study of this important everyday issue in transfusion medicine is highly desirable.",

For example, the US nationwide removal of Tylenol (McNeil-PPC, Ft Washington, PA) from stores because of fatal cyanide tampering in Chicago in 1982 was classified as a market withdrawal not a recall. 8 Most notices about blood components involving postdonation donor information are now categorized as market withdrawals.

Seventy-six percent were in Class III recalls, 24% were of Class II, and only 12 units were designated in Class I (because of viral or bacterial infection). Three fourths of the recalled units involved incorrect or incomplete testing for syphilis or viral infection.

If the donor is the suspected likely source of another WNV transfusion case, then other units from that donor collected from \u03ea28 days to \u03e928 days from the infectious donation should also be traced and the recipients' physicians notified. \"However, in cases when a donor is potentially associated with a case of transmission of WNV, but the epidemiological investigation has not established the specific donor as a likely source of transmission of WNV, we are not recommending notification of the transfusion service.\" This is slightly misworded because units from recent donors associated with a transfused WNV patient should be sought for precautionary quarantine and retrieval from the transfusion service, but the implication is that the recipients' physicians need not be notified if the donor is not the likely source. WNV nucleic acid testing (NAT) began in the US and Canada in the summer of 2003. When a donor tests reactive by WNV NAT, the FDA has not specified at this writing whether to use a 14-day lookback period (as per donor WNV illness) or a 28-day period (as per donor transmission of WNV) for recent donations.",

However one chooses to manage recalls and notifications, and in however much detail desired, a procedure is a prerequisite for instructing staff in these key elements. 2. Act immediately to quarantine and discard, or return, blood components as instructed by the supplier. Time is of the essence when a notice is received. Immediate action should be taken to quarantine the unit and prevent release. Is a recalled unit of plasma being thawed in the waterbath? In case a large number of units is involved, the transfusion service staff should have round-the-clock ac-cess to facsimile or secure electronic mail to facilitate transfer of information and prevent transcription errors from verbal messages. For laboratories with blood bank computer systems, both computer and physical quarantine must be done, although computer quarantine may be done first to expedite prompt blockage of issue. As noted previously, if a unit is erroneously released after a notice is received to quarantine it, then a biological product deviation report must be sent to the FDA. 3. Review and determine the medical implications of units already transfused. This is further discussed later. 4. Keep records of all notices and actions as required (eg, 5 years in AABB standards). 25 Telephone instructions should be logged and obeyed, but also documented pending written follow-up. Record systems should include the capability to track investigations in progress. Transfusion services may want to consider means to search recall records by unit number or patient or the ability to tag the unit or patient laboratory record that a recall has occurred. Large hospitals may find a confidential database useful. Transfusion services may wish to review their general strategies for oversight, management, and record keeping with the hospital's risk management and/or legal counsel. Although most of these problems occur before the hospital receives the units, there could be potential medicolegal implications for the hospital and the physician. For example, it may be advisable to consider these investigations as a subcategory of the hospital's overall incident management program for quality improvement or at least to bring serious problems to this forum.",

For example, the CDC's key international travel health publication, the \"Yellow Book,\" does not tell physicians and travelers about when to avoid blood donation, and for how long. 33 Likewise, when blood donor deferrals began for SARS-area travel, this was not included in CDC information pages for travelers. 34 More publicity about the consequences of travel on blood donation might reduce recall rates for geographic donor risks.",
