Influenza with abrupt illness onset and fever tends to drive patients to seek medical attention within several days. 5 The typical RSV illness begins with a cold and progresses over several days to dyspnea and wheezing. The average time to seek medical attention is 5-6 days by which time virus may no longer be detectable in the upper airways. 33, 34 In addition, because RSV infection in adults represents reinfection, a rapid amnestic antibody response may obscure a rise in antibody if acute sera collection is delayed. Finally, because the analysis of acute and convalescent sera is not possible in patients that die, results may have been biased toward milder illness.",

Of these, 47 withdrew consent, 47 died, 5 were lost to follow-up, and 16 withdrew due to other reasons. Thus, 330 (74.2%) subjects completed the study in May 2014 (Figure 1). The mean age of subjects was 66.3 \u00b1 8.3 years with the majority having severe COPD (77.5%), 16.2% had advanced CHF, and 6.3% had both severe COPD and advanced CHF (Table 1). Over the course of the study, 1111 episodes of MARI illness occurred, of which 300 were hospitalizations, 82 were ER visits, 550 were outpatient visits, and 179 were phone calls to a health care provider. Overall, 92% of illnesses had a nasal PCR performed within 14 days of illness: hospitalizations (87%), ER visits (80%), outpatient visits (96%), and illnesses with phone calls (89%). In addition, 95% of subjects had a serologic analysis of pre-and postseason sera. Forty-two illnesses met the protocol-specified definition of RSV-MARI, of whom 12 were positive by RT-PCR only, 14 had a >4-fold increase in serology only, and 16 were RT-PCR and seropositive. For the RSV seasons combined, the incidence of a protocol-defined RSV-MARI was 4.68 events per 100 patient-seasons (Table 2). The highest incidence of RSV-MARI occurred in season 1 (6.37 per 100 patient-seasons) followed by season 2 (5.41 per 100 patientseasons) and season 3 (2.80 per 100 patient-seasons). The rate of inpatient RSV-MARI was highest for season 1 (3.15 events per 100 patient-seasons) followed by season 3 (0.93 events per 100 patient-seasons). The incidence of outpatient visits was greater than inpatient visits for season 2 (4.61 vs 0.76 events per 100 patientseasons, respectively) and season 3 (1.86 vs 0.93 events per 100 patient-seasons, respectively), but was similar for RSV season 1 (3.16 vs 3.15 events per 100 patient-seasons, respectively).Twelve (29%) of the 42 subjects with per protocol RSV-related MARI were hospitalized, and one subject was hospitalized with RSV outside the RSV season. Overall health utilization attributable to RSV-MARI was relatively low, with only 2.9% of subjects hospitalized; 1.8% had increased oxygen needs and 0.6% required intensive COPD, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, GOLD Stage III/IV; CHF, congestive heart failure, New York Heart Association Class III/IV or American College of Cardiology Class C/D.",

Subjects had scheduled study visits every May and October to obtain blood, nasal swab, sputum, and clinical data through the May 2014 visit. Unscheduled illness visits to collect blood, nasal swab, sputum, and clinical data were performed when a subject experienced MARI. Visits ideally occurred within 72 hours (but no longer than 14 days) after criteria confirmed illness. Blood was collected approximately 30 days (\u00b14 days) after the illness onset. Between scheduled visits, subjects were contacted bimonthly by phone to ascertain if MARI occurred outside the study site (urgent care or emergency room [ER] visits) and quantify health care resource utilization. Information collected included phone calls to health care providers, physician office/outpatient visits, ER visits, hospitalizations, intensive care unit stays, supplemental oxygen, and ventilator use.

Notably, sputum was collected in 69% of cases in this multicenter trial, indicating that it is feasible and valuable in patients with COPD.Respiratory illnesses were common during our surveillance, and multiple other viruses were documented to cause infection. As in other studies, rhinovirus was the most frequently detected pathogen, although approximately 50% occurred during routine nonillness visits.[27][28][29][30] In contrast, the detection of RSV and most other viruses was uncommon during well visits. When using only multiplex PCR for diagnosis, the percent of samples testing positive for RSV was equivalent to influenza A, human metapneumovirus (HMPV), and parainfluenza viruses. Coronavirus detection rates ranged from 8.5% to 10.6%, and although occasionally detected during well visits, most were detected during illness. We and other investigators have shown coronaviruses to cause serious illness in persons with the underlying cardiopulmonary disease, yet, they remain an underrecognized pathogen in adults.31,32 A significant limitation of this study was that the diagnostic testing was only performed when illness triggered medical T A B L E 3 PCR results by sample type (all seasons combined) for subjects with illness visits Abbreviation: PCR, polymerase chain reaction. *Comparison of swab versus sputum yield.",
