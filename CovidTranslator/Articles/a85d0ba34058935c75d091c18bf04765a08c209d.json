            "text": "Differentiating foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) antibodies generated during a natural infection from those due to vaccination (DIVA) is crucial for proving freedom from disease after an outbreak and allowing resumption of trade in livestock products. The World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) recommends that FMDV vaccines are composed of inactivated virus that has been purified to remove non-structural viral proteins. Such purified vaccines primarily induce antibodies to viral structural proteins, whereas replicating virus stimulates host antibodies specific for both structural and non-structural proteins. The current preferred FMDV DIVA test is a competitive ELISA (C-ELISA) designed to detect antibodies to the non-structural protein 3ABC. Previously, we described the development of an FMDV DIVA test based entirely on recombinant proteins (the recombinant detecting antibody and the 3ABC coating antigen) produced in Escherichia coli. In this study, we have determined the precise binding site of the recombinant detecting antibody to a conserved sequence within the 3B region of the 3ABC protein, replaced the original E-tag of the detecting antibody with two in-house tags and engineered a direct antibody-reporting enzyme (alkaline phosphatase) fusion protein. These modifications have further improved the DIVA test, providing great potential for large scale production and uptake due to its simplicity, reproducibility and low cost.",

For a country to be considered free from the FMD virus (FMDV), different diagnostic approaches are required according to whether vaccine has been used and if so whether it was used in response to an outbreak of disease or as part of routine prophylaxis. The ability to differentiate between these different immune states has been an area of much research. The current preferred test to differentiate infected from vaccinated (DIVA) animals is a competition ELISA (C-ELISA) designed to detect antibodies to the non-structural protein 3ABC as an indicator of infection (Sorensen et al., 2005; Clavijo et al., 2004; Foord et al., 2007) .",

Specifically, the pCANTAB-FM26 and FM27 clones were digested with Nco I and Not I and the resulting scFv gene fragments cloned into a likewise digested pGC vector that contained C-terminal FLAG and His tags (Robert et al., 2009 ). The resulting pGC-FM26/27-FlagHis constructs were expressed according to previously described methodology (Dolezal et al., 2000) . Proteins were isolated from the periplasmic space (Skerra and Pluckthun, 1988) . The subsequent supernatant was filtered through a 0.45 \u00b5m filter and the FM26 and FM27 scFv proteins purified by a two-step automated procedure using an AKTAxpress purification system (GE Healthcare). In brief, the scFv proteins were first purified using a Ni 2+ -NTA HisTrap FF (1 ml) affinity column followed by size exclusion chromatography on a HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 200 column equilibrated in PBS. Purified proteins were quantified by their absorbance at 280 nm using the theoretical extinction coefficient calculated from the sequence (Gill and von Hippel, 1989 ).",

The plasmids pDAP2 and pDAP2/S contain the wild type AP gene and a mutant gene (AP/S), respectively (Kerschbaumer et al., 1997) . The AP/S has been shown to enhance the specific activity of the AP up to 35-fold (Kerschbaumer et al., 1997) . Because the AP gene is derived from E. coli, FM27-YYEP was included as a control alongside the FM27-AP and FM27-AP/S constructs for all studies. Western blot analysis demonstrated the presence of the CRAb-AP fusion protein with the predicted molecular mass of approximately 72 kDa (Fig. 4A ). The functionality of the fusion protein was demonstrated by directly measuring AP activity in the crude supernatant as shown in Fig. 4B . Background AP activity was negligible as indicated by the control FM27-YYEP. As expected, the FM27-AP/S clone exhibited higher enzyme activity than the FM27-AP clone. Furthermore, the specific reactivity of the CRAb component in the fusion was confirmed by ELISA, which indicated that the CRAb-AP proteins reacted with 3ABC, but not with a non-related SARS virus antigen containing the same His tag (data not shown).",

Chicken recombinant antibodies are not only simple to produce but they are also less cross-reactive when used in combination with mammalian antibodies in immunoassays. Our previous FMDV DIVA C-ELISA (Foord et al., 2007) utilized a commercial E-tag which can only be detected using the commercial anti-E-tag antibodies (the E-tag mAb is no longer commercially available). In this current study, we determined the epitope sequences recognised by the two closely related CRAbs and the binding affinities by biosensor.

It was interesting to note that both CRAbs have two binding sites within the 3B region, designated 3B-1 and 3B-2 in this study. Although both CRAbs bound the same site, the data obtained from the phage library suggests a subtle difference in the key residual contacts between the two antibodies. In the \u03a6-DPLE (D) motif, CRAb-FM26 has a more stringent requirement for the Y residue at the \u03a6 position and the presence of the P residue than that of CRAb-FM27. This difference in binding between FM26 and FM27 was further demonstrated by absolute affinity measurements using a biosensor. This was most notable with the association rate constant (k a ), which showed an approximate 3-fold difference between the antibodies, with FM27 having a faster on-rate. Since the variable heavy (V H ) chain complementary determining regions of the two antibody molecules is identical (Foord et al., 2007) , one could conclude that the observed difference in binding affinity and mimotope specificity is entirely dependent on the variable light (V L ) chain. These data would suggest that further V L -randomization may be used as a strategy to improve the assay sensitivity in the future.",
