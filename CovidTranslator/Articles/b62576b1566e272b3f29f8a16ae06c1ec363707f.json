Grossly, multiple bowel loops in all ferret kits were distended by mucoid faecal material. Microscopically, there was no evidence of inflammation or notable alteration to the normal mucosal morphology. Gram-positive coccoid bacteria colonized variable segments of the small intestine. These bacteria were identified as Staphylococcus delphini by phenotypic and molecular analyses. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for detection of Staphylococcus enterotoxins was positive and polymerase chain reaction detected the gene for Staphylococcus enterotoxin E in the isolates. The hypersecretory diarrhoea in these ferret kits may have been associated with colonization of the small intestine by S. delphini, cultures of which were shown in vitro to be potentially capable of producing enterotoxin E. The condition described in these ferrets is similar to 'sticky' kit syndrome in mink.",

Clinical signs include hypersecretion of cervical apocrine glands and mucoid diarrhoea, which causes severe dehydration that can rapidly proceed to death. Large outbreaks of sticky kit syndrome at mink farms are not uncommon, causing death in up to 30e40% of affected kits (Englund et al., 2002) . During one such outbreak, post-mortem examinations conducted at the Michigan State University Diagnostic Center for Population and Animal Health (DCPAH), in Lansing, MI, revealed that the intestinal mucosa of affected kits was colonized by gram-positive coccoid bacteria. Bacterial culture and typing indicated that they were a strain of Staphylococcus delphini that was capable of producing enterotoxins A and E (Sledge et al., 2010) .",

The stomachs of all kits contained milk. The small and large intestines of kits 1, 2 and 4 contained moderate amounts of yelloweorange, mucoid to liquid faecal material (Fig. 1) . The jejunal and ileal contents of the third kit were yellowewhite and mucoid, while the colonic contents were bright green and of mucoid to liquid consistency. Brain, heart, lung, liver, spleen, thymus, kidney, pancreas and small and large intestine were collected from the four kits and were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for at least 24 h. Representative sections were processed routinely and embedded in paraffin wax. Sections (5 mm) were stained with haematoxylin and eosin (HE). Selected sections of the small intestine were stained by the Gram's method (Hucker-Twort stain). Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed for coronavirus as previously described (Garner et al., 2008) .",

Minimal degeneration of intestinal epithelium with rare associated neutrophils, likely representing a mild reaction to bacterial toxins, was present in one ferret kit. In previous reports, bacterial colonization of the intestine by S. delphini with associated diarrhoea and excessive cervical apocrine gland secretion was described in mink kits ranging from 10 to 14 days of age (Sledge et al., 2010) . The four ferret kits described in this report showed similar clinical signs to those 'sticky' mink kits: the ferret kits had pasty, yellow diarrhoea and one kit had also a sticky coat. However, ferret kits were affected at a wider age range (1e4 weeks) than mink kits. Many of the features of the diarrhoeal disease described in these ferret kits, including the intestinal colonization by grampositive cocci, the isolation of S. delphini and the partial nucleic acid sequences of three genes of the isolates, are consistent with the findings previously described in the mink kits with sticky kit syndrome (Sledge et al., 2010) . The similar clinical and histological features and the comparable bacterial isolates suggest that ferret kits can experience a 'sticky kit syndrome' similar to the syndrome described in mink. gene (448 base pairs) and SodA gene (313 base pairs). The concatenated sequence for the HSP60 and SodA genes was trimmed to match the length of sequences for both genes that were available in GenBank. The tree was constructed using the neighbour-joining method (Saitou and Nei, 1987) with 1,000 bootstrap replicates (Felsenstein, 1987) . The percentage of replicate trees in which the associated taxa clustered together is shown above the branches. The phylogenetic analyses were conducted in MEGA4 (Tamura et al., 2007) .",
