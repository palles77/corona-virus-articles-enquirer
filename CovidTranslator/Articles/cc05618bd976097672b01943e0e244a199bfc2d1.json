We also investigated the association between participation in hygiene-related educational activities and good hygiene practices in households with or without cohabitation with animals. Methods A survey regarding cohabitation with animals, socioeconomic characteristics and participation in educational activities was conducted among 1,497 households randomly sampled from urban districts of Vientiane in 2001. Rates of satisfactory performance of recommended good hygiene practices according to a program commencing in 1996 were compared among households cohabiting with animals with or without participation in educational activities (reference group). Results Even among households not engaged in agriculture as a major source of income, 54.4, 34.9, 7.9, 3.1 and 35.7% cohabited with chickens, ducks, cattle, buffaloes and dogs, respectively. The percentage of households fulfilling the recommendations for good hygiene practices was 56.7%. The rates of satisfactory hygiene practices among households participating in health education and cohabitating with chickens, ducks or cattle were greater than those in the reference group (OR = 1.7, 95%CI = 1.2, 2.3; OR = 2.0, 95%CI = 1.3, 3.0; OR = 2.3, 95%CI = 1.0, 4.9) regardless of socioeconomic factors. Households cohabiting with animals showed poorer rates of satisfactory hygiene practices than those without animals. Conclusions Cohabitation with farm animals is common in urban Vientiane regardless of household involvement in agriculture. Further effort is required to improve hygiene conditions, despite some positive effects of health education even in households cohabiting with animals.",

Due to the global increases in urbanisation, international commerce and international information spread, people's lifestyles and residential hygiene conditions are changing over time.

A World Health Organization (WHO) report included laboratory test results that confirmed 379 human cases of avian influenza worldwide, including 239 deaths, by 8 April 2008 [4] . While greater total numbers of deaths were reported in Indonesia (107 deaths/132 cases) and Vietnam (52 deaths/106 cases), all of the confirmed cases in Cambodia (7 cases, all since 2005), Lao People's Democratic Republic (Lao PDR, 2 cases, all since February 2007) and Nigeria (1 case, in January 2007) ended in death of the patient [4] . The majority of human cases of avian influenza were not associated with working on large poultry farms, but rather were among people coming into close contact with poultry in their backyards or homes [5, 6] . Therefore, the risk of animal-to-human transmission of this disease in places close to human residences is a significant health concern.",

With regard to the transmission of other infectious diseases, previous reports have indicated the persistence of pathogens in animal and human excreta and in waste water [9, 10] . Although the transmission pathways of avian influenza from poultry to humans have not been clearly identified in all cases reported to date, the WHO recommends improvement of hygiene to reduce the risks of transmission of avian influenza to humans and the potential transmission of pandemic H5N1 if and when such a virus emerges [11] . Therefore, ''good hygiene practices'', such as access to clean water, drinking safe water, washing hands with soap and water, maintaining a clean and organised household environment, separating materials used inside a residence from those designed for outside use to avoid contamination and wellmaintained drainage of sewage are encouraged to reduce risk of animal-to-human infections as well as to reduce the risks of other infectious diseases.",

Not only agricultural households but also nonagricultural households in urban areas cohabitated with farm animals. The percentage of households performing good hygiene practices was smaller in agricultural households than in non-agricultural households, and was smaller in those households with than in those without farm animals. Participation in hygiene-related educational activities was associated with better performance in the recommended hygiene practices among those households cohabiting with animals. Statistically significant relationships were observed for households rearing chickens, ducks, cattle or dogs, regardless of socioeconomic conditions. Seeking health information from the radio or newspaper was associated with better performance of the recommended good hygiene practices among households cohabiting with chickens or dogs, regardless of socioeconomic conditions. The agricultural census, which includes information from farm households in Lao PDR, indicated that 73, 31 and 48% of farming households kept chickens, cattle or buffaloes [15] . The percentages of farming households in urban Vientiane cohabiting with chickens and cattle were similar to those of animal holders among farming households throughout the country. Cohabitation with buffaloes was less frequent in urban Vientiane than for farming households with buffaloes throughout the country. Information on animal holdings in urban areas is rather limited. Considering the similar percentage of animal holding among farming households in urban Vientiane compared with that among farming households in the country as a whole, further studies should be performed to gauge the potential reservoir of animal-tohuman transmission of diseases in densely populated areas. Table 5 Factors associated with performing recommended good hygiene practices: relationship with combined conditions of seeking health information from radio and newspaper and cohabitation with animals, agricultural farm work as the main occupation, education of female principal and household income (n = 1,183) Recommended good hygiene practices were defined as satisfying five or more of the following six criteria: (1) access to piped water; (2) a clean, organised yard with separation from farm animals; (3) well-maintained drainage; (4) tidiness inside the house with separation of materials designated for inside and outside use; (5) family's practice of boiling water before drinking; and (6) family's practice of washing hands before eating. Criteria (1) to (4) were evaluated by inspection, and (5) and (6) The study population was a representative sample of urban Vientiane selected by random sampling. Information on animal rearing was obtained from both households for which agriculture was not the main source of income in urban districts. Although the percentages of cohabitation with animals among urban non-agricultural households were lower than those among urban agricultural households, it should be noted that a large proportion of households reported cohabiting with farm animals even among those households not engaged in agriculture. This observation suggested that there is a widespread risk of backyard infection by animal-transmitted diseases in populated urban centres in Lao PDR. The risk is spread not only among farming households, but also among nonfarming households, even among those without any farm land. Information on the number of at-risk households and on target households requiring more intensive intervention will enable strategic planning in disease prevention programs.",

A previous report on domestic animals in urban areas indicated a higher percentage of keeping poultry among urban households [3] . Poultry are small animals and rearing of such animals requires relatively little space, which allows non-agricultural households to rear animals even in an urban environment [16] . In contrast, large animals are usually reared by agricultural households or by non-agricultural households with farm land. In the latter type, household members themselves are not necessarily directly involved in animal rearing. Animals are regarded as a source of wealth in Lao society and keeping livestock contributes to the household finances [17] . Further information on handling practices of animals including use of animals for their family's food or selling of animals at markets as well as rearing methods identify points of contacts with higher risk of infection when the animals reserve pathogens. Information of which family members have contact with animals will facilitate identification of vulnerable family members at higher risk of potential animal-to-human disease transmission.",

To further refer relationship between good hygiene and other factors, the components of good hygiene practices should be examined. In Vientiane, Lao PDR, chickens are generally housed in confined quarters at high density and are not perfectly isolated from wildfowl. Therefore, they are at high risk of infectious diseases spread by wildfowl [18] . The chickens reared by households with relatively large farm land areas represent different risks as they are kept free-range in people's backyards and are always exposed to potentially viruscontaminated materials [19] . Taking into consideration the lifestyle factors related to animal rearing in urban areas, dissemination of information on safe animal rearing practices with regard to prevention of the spread of infectious diseases, feeding with safe foods and complete isolation from wildfowl is recommended in communities where many households cohabit with animals.",
