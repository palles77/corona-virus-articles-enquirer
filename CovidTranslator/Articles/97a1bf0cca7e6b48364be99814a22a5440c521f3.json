To survey these dynamic changes, we applied next-generation sequencing, analyzing the small RNA fraction of HIV-infected cells at 5, 12, and 24 h postinfection (RNA-Seq). These time points afforded a view of the transcriptomic changes occurring both before and during viral replication. In the resulting small RNA-Seq data set, we detected a phased pattern of microRNA expression. Largely distinct sets of microRNAs were found to be suppressed at 5 and 12 h postinfection, and both sets of changes rebounded later in infection. A larger set of microRNA changes was observed at 24 h postinfection. When integrated with mRNA expression data, the small RNA-Seq data indicated a role for microRNAs in transcriptional regulation, T cell activation, and cell cycle during HIV infection. As a unique benefit of next-generation sequencing, we also detected candidate novel host microRNAs differentially expressed during infection, including one whose downregulation at 24 h postinfection may allow full replication of HIV to proceed. Collectively, our data provide a uniquely comprehensive view of the changes in host microRNAs induced by HIV during cellular infection.",

Using next-generation sequencing (NGS), we recently profiled the transcriptome of HIV-infected lymphoblastoid cells and found that over half of the detectable polyadenylated RNA species were differentially expressed (DE) during infection (1) . These changes corroborated clinical results. For example, in CD4 \u03e9 T cells isolated from HIV \u03e9 individuals, a distinct expression profile was observed comprising 260 genes whose expression correlated with viral load; these genes were involved in a variety of functions, including inflammatory signaling, cell cycle, and antigen presentation (4) .",

To this end, we sampled multiple time points, including those preceding detectable HIV replication, to identify signatures of different stages of infection in vitro. To characterize mi-croRNAs, both known and putatively novel, we then integrated our NGS data set with mRNA-Seq data derived from the same experimental samples (1) and thereby identified microRNAs that may contribute to phenotypic changes in infected cells over time. We also provide a full account of putatively novel microRNAs and other small RNAs that were DE upon infection that may in turn provide new avenues for future research.",

In a previous study (1) , we found that levels of virus were nearly undetectable at 4 hpi, increasing at 12 hpi and peaking at 24 hpi. Our choice of timing parallels these time points. For controls, we also mock-infected cells using cell culture medium or alternatively infected cells with UV-inactivated HIV-1 (HIV UV ). Small RNAs were then size selected, and cDNA libraries were generated and then sequenced by NGS. To analyze the resulting small RNA-Seq data set, we employed a workflow that included mapping sequences to different small RNA annotations, identifying DE mi-croRNAs based on the mapped data, and determining the mRNA targets of the DE microRNAs (Fig. 1) .",

Because many microRNAs were detected with low read counts, we performed further statistical analysis using DESeq, a negative binomial-based test that treats expression as discrete counts (13) . By applying DESeq, we found that small numbers of microRNAs were DE at 5 and 12 hpi (numbers of microRNAs are in Table 1 ; expression values and microRNA IDs are in Fig. S2A to C in the supplemental material; full information is in Table S1 in the supplemental material). Furthermore, similar numbers of microRNAs were detected as DE in HIV-infected cells and HIV UV -infected cells at these time points (Table 1; see also  Fig. S2D to F and Table S1 ). In contrast, at 24 hpi, a larger number of microRNAs were found DE, approximately 7-fold the number DE at 5 and 12 hpi (Table 1; see also Fig. S2C and Table S1 ). This expansion was specific to infection with live virus, as cells infected with HIV UV continued to show small numbers of DE genes at 24 hpi (Table 1; see also Fig. S2F and Table S1 ). This expansion in the number of DE microRNAs was similar to the expansion observed for DE mRNAs in the same samples (1), indicating that microRNA and mRNA expression were similarly affected by HIV-1 infection. However, out of those microRNAs found DE in HIV UV -infected cells at 24 hpi, the majority (13 out of 18) were also found DE in HIV-infected cells ( lated relative to their levels in mock-infected cells (Table 1 ; Fig. 2A and B). However, by 24 hpi, the majority of these microRNAs were found upregulated relative to mock-infected cells ( Fig. 2A and B ). This pattern was observed in the majority of DE microRNAs at earlier time points (five out of five downregulated at 5 hpi, and four out of eight downregulated at 12 hpi; Fig. 2A and B). Likewise, many of the microRNAs found DE at 24 hpi but not at earlier time points nonetheless displayed directions of changes in earlier and later time points (see Fig. S2G in the supplemental material). This phased time point specificity suggests that changes in mi-croRNAs tracked specific stages of HIV infection in vitro. Interestingly many of the trends observed in HIV-infected samples were also observed in HIV UV -infected samples, though with reduced magnitudes of change and/or not at statistical significance, indicating that viral attachment or internalization induced a similar but attenuated response, relative to live virus, even later in infection (see Fig. S2G ).",

The presence of up-and downregulated microRNAs associated with multiple annotations related to transcriptional regulation suggest a role for microRNAs in regulating changes in gene expression during HIV infection. A subnetwork of upregulated mRNAs associated with DE downregulated microRNAs was found to include K(lysine) acetyltransferase 2B (KAT2B), a transcription factor known to contribute to HIV replication and known to be targeted posttranscriptionally by miR-17 and miR-20 (14) . This subnetwork showed that these and other microRNAs were predicted to target KAT2B as well as a broader set of mRNAs with functional connections to KAT2B (Fig. 3A ). Additional microRNAs in the subnetwork in-cluded miR-106a and miR-20b, two paralogs of miR-17 and miR-20, derived from the same host gene cluster (Fig. 3A) . Their inclusion in the subnetwork suggests they may also have been downregulated in the earlier experiment, implicating miR-17 and miR-20 (14) . In addition, a nonparalogous microRNA, miR-32, was also included in this subnetwork and may have regulated the same target mRNAs (Fig. 3A) .

By this threshold, some pathways, including \"regulation of small GTPase-mediated signal transduction,\" \"phosphoinositide binding,\" and \"regulation of Ras protein signal transduction,\" were enriched in upregulated targeted mRNAs, suggesting microRNA downregulation may have contributed to increased receptor signaling (see Table S3 ). By the same criterion, other pathways, including \"intracellular transport\" and \"secretion by cell,\" were enriched in downregulated targeted mRNAs, suggesting microRNA upregulation may have contributed to the suppression of intracellular trafficking (see Table S3 ). T cell activation-related pathways were also enriched with downregulated target mRNAs (as \"costimulatory signal during T-cell activation\" and \"positive regulation of T cell activation\" with P values of 0.05 and 0.08, respectively) (see Table S3 and Fig. S3C ). We previously found that T cell activation-associated mRNA expression was strongly suppressed at 12 and 24 hpi (1). In this study, we found that microRNAs were predicted to target key molecules involved in T cell activation, such as CD4, CD28, and TP53 (see Fig. S3C ).

To better characterize the early DE microRNAs, we generated an alternative set of TargetScan predictions using low evolutionary conservation thresholds and performed the correlation analysis between these microRNAs and their alternatively predicted target mRNAs.",

One of these, miR-3607-3p, was highly expressed in SUP-T1 cells (see Table S4 ) and DE at all three time points (downregulated at 5 and 12 hpi and upregulated at 24 hpi), unique among the microRNAs in our study ( Fig. 2A and B) . In our analysis, miR-3607-3p showed highly significant, anticorrelated expression with 21 target mRNAs at 12 and 24 hpi (Fig. 3B ). These were enriched in annotations for \"cell cycle process\" and \"transcriptional regulatory activity,\" with interleukin enhancerbinding factor 3 (ILF3) and nuclear receptor corepressor 1 (NCOR1) having both annotations. In addition, four mRNAs in this network were annotated for \"transcriptional regulatory activity\" and encoded transcription factors: ILF3, GABPB1 (GAbinding protein transcription factor, beta subunit 1), NFATC3 (nuclear factor of activated T cells, calcineurin-dependent 3), and TCF7 (transcription factor 7). The phased expression pattern of miR-3607-3p suggests that these targeted mRNAs may have been subjected to variable degrees of regulation-with reduced suppression early in infection and then increased suppression later in infection-during the course of HIV infection.",

This indicated that the EPB41L2-encoded microRNA was robustly expressed and detected, despite differences in cell type, sample processing, and read mapping. In addition, evolutionary comparisons of aligned sequences from primates, mammals, and other vertebrates showed that the sequence for the EPB41L2-encoded microRNA was conserved in higher primates, particularly Old World monkeys and apes, with the exception of gorillas, but not other vertebrates (Fig. 4) . External data sets provided additional evidence that viral infection results in the downregulation of the EPBL41L2-encoded candidate novel microRNA. We obtained raw small RNA-Seq data from a separate infection model system, human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection of human fibroblasts (17) , and observed reads mapping to the location of the candidate microRNA in each of four samples (mock-and HCMV-infected at 24 and 72 hpi), suggesting that the microRNA was expressed in human fibroblasts. Moreover, quantification of these reads suggested that HCMV downregulated the expression of this microRNA at 24 hpi (from 13.2 rpm to 5.6 rpm, a change of 58%) and at 72 hpi (from 34.4 rpm to 7.0 rpm, a change of 80%).",

However, the focus in these studies has largely been on virally encoded microRNAs rather than on cellular microRNAs. These studies typically also examine only a single time point after infection, e.g., two days postinfection in Yeung et al. and Schopman et al. (8, 10) . Other studies have profiled microRNA expression in infected patient populations, e.g., Bignami et al. (19) , but in these cases, heterogeneous mixtures of cell types served as the source material, complicating data analysis. In contrast, we have focused on the host response at the level of a single infected cell type and profiled this system over time using small RNA-Seq and other NGS-based approaches (1). To our knowledge, this study offers the first unbiased glimpse into the dynamic changes underlying the small RNA population of HIVinfected cells. The specific goals of the study were to (i) identify patterns of DE microRNA expression starting early in infection, (ii) identify anticorrelated targets of DE microRNAs, including those with low evolutionary conservation, and (iii) detect other classes of small RNA altered during infection, including candidate novel microRNAs.",

In our previous work on this experimental system, we found that viral replication was undetectable at 4 hpi but then proceeded rapidly by 12 hpi (1). In this study, we were particularly interested in detecting microRNA signatures early in infection. Using small RNA-Seq, we identified 14 microRNAs DE at 5 and 12 hpi whose expression appeared to be largely coordinated. Many of these displayed a phased expression pattern with time, suppressed initially and then overexpressed by 24 hpi.",

            "text": "Several of the microRNAs that we observed as DE, particularly at early time points, were either poorly characterized or not previously associated with HIV, e.g., as reviewed by Houzet and Jeang (20) or Swaminathan et al. (21) . By identifying target mRNAs with anticorrelated expression patterns, we implicated one of these DE microRNAs, miR-3607-3p, in the regulation of cell cycle-and transcription-associated mRNAs. HIV infection is known to downregulate cell cycle-related genes (1, 22) , and differing levels of regulation with time may reflect evolving requirements of the virus following entry. In particular, the upregulation of cell cyclerelated transcription factors prior to replication, mediated by the downregulation of microRNAs such as miR-3607-3p, may result in the internal production of raw materials needed for viral replication or convert host chromatin to an open configuration. In particular, the NFATC3 (nuclear factor of activated T cells, cytoplasmic 3) gene, a target of miR-3607-3p in our analysis, encodes a transcription factor that has recently been shown to be involved in T-cell activation (23) . Likewise, the TCF7 gene, another predicted target of miR-3607-3p, encodes a T-cell-specific transcription factor (24) . Relieving the inhibition of these transcription factors via the suppression of miR-3607-3p and other microRNAs may represent an early event of HIV infection which is reversed later in HIV infection. Consistent with this interpretation, the MYH9 gene (myosin, heavy chain 9, nonmuscle), a target mRNA of miR-3607-3p found downregulated later in infection, was also found to be downregulated in HIV-infected human glomeruli, which may contribute to HIV-associated pathology (25) . While we cannot discern the mechanism by which viral entry or internalization might suppress miR-3607-3p and other early DE mi-croRNAs from our data, we speculate that a surface protein such as gp120 initiates a signaling cascade that destabilizes the available pool of miR-3607-3p. In general, we observed agreement between our results and those from previous studies, particularly for other, highly expressed microRNAs. For example, Hayes et al. measured changes in CEMx174 lymphocytes infected with HIV-1 strain NL4-3 (26) . Out of the 42 DE microRNAs observed by Hayes et al., 11 were also found to be DE at 24 hpi in our data set, perhaps indicating cell type specificity (26) . Of these, eight displayed concordant changes between the two data sets, with complete concordance observed for the most highly expressed microRNAs (let-7e, miR-92, and miR-106a, all with \u03fe10,000 reads per sample in uninfected SUP-T1 cells) (26) . A similar concordance among highly expressed microRNAs was observed for clinical samples as well. For example, among the DE microRNAs observed in PBMCs from HIV-infected individuals by Houzet et al., four out of the five mostly highly expressed microRNAs (let-7e, miR-20a, miR-20b, miR-92, and miR-182, again with \u03fe10,000 reads per sample in uninfected SUP-T1 cells) displayed directional concordance (6) . Likewise, concordance with the clinical data set from Witwer et al. was evident for highly expressed microRNAs, such as miR-155 (upregulated by 1.5-fold in PBMCs from viremic individuals and by 1.8-fold in our study at 24 hpi) and miR-181b (upregulated by 1.8-fold in PBMCs from viremic individuals and in our study at 24 hpi) (11) . Highly expressed microRNAs may therefore represent cell type-robust signatures.",

Our analysis showed that microRNAs of the miR-17-92 cluster-known to be relevant to T cell function (27) -and miR-32 may target KAT2B and other transcription factors coordinately regulated with KAT2B.

An extension of this approach would be to include other possible effects of microRNA, such as reductions of translational efficiency. Nevertheless, recent data point to destabilization of target mRNAs as the main mode of microRNA activity (28) (29) (30) ; our approach reflects this state of knowledge. In addition, while our approach is based on complementarity of microRNAs to the 3= UTRs of mRNAs, recent studies suggest that microRNAs may bind other parts of mRNAs, including 5= UTRs (31, 32) . Our approach utilizing predictive algorithms for microRNA-to-3= UTR complementarity is intended to detect canonical interactions and limit false positives but would necessarily miss these additional possible interactions. Finally, we note that our approach is based ultimately on predictions of sequence complementarity supplemented by expression data. Additional experiments, such as direct cross-linking and immunoprecipitation of the RISC complex, would provide more direct verification of the targets that we have identified (33) .",

In addition to annotated microRNAs, we also detected changes in other types of small RNAs, including piRNAs at 24 hpi. piRNA expression was previously detected in HIV-infected Jurkat cells (8) . In our study, we detected piRNA expression in an additional T lymphoblast cell line, SUP-T1 cells, providing support for the expression of piRNAs in non-germ-line cells. HIV infection resulted in changes in the expression of 21 piRNAs. piRNAs are hypothesized to function in epigenetic regulatory mechanisms; however, due to a lack of consensus about their function in nongerm-line cells, we report these changes for completeness only (34) . We also detected changes in several candidate novel micro-RNAs. In particular, one candidate encoded in the first intron of EPB41L2 was highly expressed in uninfected cells and strongly downregulated in infected cells. Multiple lines of evidence supported the existence of this microRNA, including ENCODE small RNA-Seq data on multiple immune cell types. Interestingly, Yeung et al. detected a sequence identical to this candidate novel microRNA in the context of HIV infection (8) . This small RNA was found to have RNA interference activity toward the HIV-1 RNA primer-binding site where tRNA binds to initiate reverse transcription, and antagomirs directed toward the small RNA resulted in increased HIV-1 replication (8). We find a deeper investigation into the connection between this microRNA and HIV to be outside the scope of the present work. However, in the future it would be interesting to determine whether more direct evidence of the association between this microRNA and HIV-1 RNA could be obtained, such as through immunoprecipitation of the two RNA species in complex.",

Finally, we note that this microRNA displays strong specificity to higher primates, and its presence may reflect a response unique to primates and viruses that target them, such as HIV-1 and HCMV.

To integrate microRNA and mRNA data, we generated target predictions from three prediction algorithms-TargetScan (37), PITA (38) , and Miranda (39)-accessed through the MAGIA website (40) . We obtained mRNA data from previous mRNA-Seq analysis of the same 12-and 24-hpi HIVand mock-infected samples used to derive the small RNA-Seq data set 1. mRNA data were represented as log 2 fragments per kilobase of exon per million mapped fragments (FPKM) in each replicate and identified by Entrez gene IDs as accessed via Biomart in Bioconductor (41) . MicroRNA data were represented as log 2 DESeq-normalized counts with miRBase 17 IDs. For each predicted microRNA-mRNA pairing, we calculated a Pearson correlation coefficient as well as a Benjamini-Hochberg-adjusted P value. Significant interactions were identified by negative correlation coefficients associated with adjusted P values of \u03fd0.05. These interactions were used to generate networks in Cytoscape (42) .",

Candidate novel mi-croRNAs were identified by analyzing genome-mapped small RNA-Seq reads from HIV-and mock-infected samples at 5, 12, and 24 hpi using miRDeep with default parameters (15) . Candidate novel microRNAs were then filtered to include only those present with \u054610 reads in \u054611 out of 17 samples (i.e.,~two-thirds of samples). DE candidate microRNAs were identified using DESeq. As a final filter, we considered only candidates with nonzero expression in mock-and HIV-infected samples at the DE time point for further analysis. The UCSC Genome Browser (44) was used to access other small RNA-Seq data from the ENCODE project (16) as well as evolutionary conservation data via Multiz (45) and GERP scores (46) . qPCR. We performed qPCR for each microRNA using a miRCURY LNA universal RT microRNA PCR system (Exiqon, Woburn, MA). For each assay, we utilized 20 ng of total RNA in an ABI 7900 real-time PCR system with SYBR green-based detection (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Each assay was run in triplicate with SYBR green PCR Master Mix (Exiqon, Woburn, MA) for microRNA detection in a 10-l reaction volume.",
