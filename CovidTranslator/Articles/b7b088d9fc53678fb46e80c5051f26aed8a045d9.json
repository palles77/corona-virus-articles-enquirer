GL, as well as dexamethasone (DEX) inhibited both tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1-and IL-1\u03b2-induced IL-8 production, mRNA expression, and promoter activity in A549 cells. Both GL and DEX inhibited transactivation of nuclear factor (NF)-\u03baB, without inhibiting translocation of the NF-\u03baB p65 subunit to the nucleus. However, the effect of GL was insensitive to RU486, a GR antagonist, and to GR knockdown by siRNA. Furthermore, only GL inhibited DNA binding of p65 to the IL-8 promoter region. These findings indicated that GL had a glucocorticoid-like inhibitory effect on IL-8 production via a mechanism that differs from that of glucocorticoids.",

Functionally, they act partly by inducing some antiinflammatory genes, such as lipocortin-1 (4), secretory leukocyte proteinase inhibitor (5) , and interleukin (IL)-1-receptor antagonist (6) , but mainly by repression of inflammatory genes, such as IL-8 and eotaxin (7, 8) . They act by binding to a cytosolic glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and rapidly induce the translocation of GR to the nucleus (9) . Within the nucleus, GR either induces gene transcription by binding to specific DNA elements in the promoter /enhancer regions of responsive genes or reduces gene transcription by functional interaction with pro-inflammatory transcription factors such as nuclear factor (NF)-\u03baB (p65/p50 heterodimers) (2, 9 -11) . Despite their effectiveness, the use of glucocorticoids in lung diseases is limited because of their severe side effects.",

In Japan, GL has been used clinically for more than 20 years in patients with chronic hepatitis (12, 13) . So far, GL has been reported to have a variety of pharmacological activities, including anti-inflammatory, anti-allergic, and anti-viral activities. For instance (14 -17) , it has been reported that orally administrated GL inhibits asthmatic responses in obalbumin (OVA)-sensitized mice and reduces levels of inflammatory cytokines IL-4 and IL-5 in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (15) , which suggests the usefulness of GL, as well as glucocorticoids, for lung inflammation. GL has been shown to be transformed to the metabolite GA by glucuronidase in intestinal bacteria (18) . The mechanism of action of GL in vivo has been believed for some time to be due to this GA, which can inhibit 11\u03b2-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (11\u03b2-HSD) (19) .",

The fluorescence was monitored at the end of each cycle to obtain a measure of the amount of PCR product formed. The thermocycler PCR data were analyzed with the software installed in the iCycler (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA), which determines the cycle number at which each sample reaches this threshold. The cycle number corresponding to the fluorescence threshold is inversely related to logarithm of the initial template concentration. Given that amplification occurs in an exponential manner, a difference of 1 in the cycle threshold corresponds approximately to a twofold difference in relative transcript abundance.

As shown in Fig. 1 , IL-8 levels in these cytokine-treated media were significantly greater compared with those in control media, and pretreatment of DEX (100 nM) markedly blocked these increases in IL-8 release. As well as the effect of DEX, pretreatment of GL (0.1, 0.3, and 1 mM) concentration-dependently blocked both TNF-\u03b1-and IL-1\u03b2-induced IL-8-release, with the most pronounced inhibition being noted for 1 mM GL (35% and 32% of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 alone, respectively) (Fig. 1 ). IL-8 mRNA level was determined by real-time PCR. TNF-\u03b1, as well as IL-1\u03b2, caused a 10-and 16-fold increase in IL-8 mRNA level compared with that in the controls (Fig. 2) .

The TNF-\u03b1 responses and the IL-1\u03b2 ones induced five-and seven-fold increases in luciferase activity, respectively (Fig. 3 ).

Therefore, luciferase assay was performed with artificial promoter plasmid containing three NF-\u03baB sites, instead of the IL-8 promoter gene. Both GL and DEX significantly inhibited the activation of the NF-\u03baB promoter gene induced by TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 (Fig. 4) , which suggests that GL, as well as DEX, inhibits NF-\u03baB-dependent gene transcription.",

Glucocorticoids act by binding to cytosolic GRs, which upon binding, become activated and translocate to the nucleus (9) . It is known that GR rapidly reduces p65associated histone acetyltransferase activity by the recruitment of histone deacetylase-2 to the nucleus, which results in inhibition of NF-\u03baB-dependent transcription (29 -31) . In the present study, DEX did not inhibit the translocation of p65 to the nucleus, which suggests that inhibition of IL-8 promoter activation by DEX is due to these intranuclear events. Similarly, GL did not affect p65 translocation to the nucleus (Fig. 5) . Therefore, we assume that GL, as well as DEX, inhibits NF-\u03baB-dependent transcription in the nucleus.",

Both the combined treatment of RU-486 with GL and GR knockdown by siRNA failed to abolish the effect of GL (Fig. 6: A and  B ). In addition, GL did not activate glucocorticoiddependent gene transcription by itself, as assessed by the MMTV-promoter reporter gene assay (Fig. 6C) . Earlier studies have shown that a degradation product of GL, GA, enhances the effect of glucocorticoids by inhibiting 11\u03b2-HSD (19) . Therefore, we also examined the effect of GA in an IL-8 reporter gene assay. GA (10 \u00b5M) did not inhibit IL-8 promoter activation by TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 at all, and it was toxic to the cells at higher concentrations. Therefore, we can also exclude the possibility that the effect of GL shown here was due to contaminated GA.",

A549 cells were pretreated with either GL (1 mM) or DEX (100 nM) for 1 h and treated with TNF-\u03b1 (2.5 ng/ml) for 2 h. The soluble chromatin extracts from the cells were immunoprecipitated with anti-p65 or control IgG and then subjected to real-time PCR with primer pairs for the IL-8 promoter gene. The amount of DNA binding was normalized by \"Input\" that was the crude chromatin extracts prior to immunoprecipitation.

In their report, TNF-\u03b1-stimulated VCAM-1 expression in embryonic fibroblasts derived from HMGB1-deficient mice was considerably decreased, compared with that in control cells. In addition to these intranuclear functions, HMGB1 acts as an important extracellular inflammatory mediator, which is released from necrotic cells and stimulated monocytes (36) . Extracellular HMGB1 interacts with plasma membrane receptors, such as receptor for advanced glycogen endproducts, and activates signaling pathways, including MyD88, TRAF6, TAK1, and NF-\u03baB activation (37) . Considering the importance of HMGB1 in the inflammatory response, the inhibition of NF-\u03baB-dependent gene expression by GL shown here might have been due to inhibition of HMGB1. In the present study, GL decreased DNA binding to p65 in the ChIP assay, without changing the nuclear translocation of p65. Furthermore, Mollica et al. (32) have shown that the addition of GL to extracellular medium can inhibit intranuclear DNA binding of HMGB1 in fibroblasts. Therefore, we assume that the inhibition of intranuclear HMGB1 may be a possible mechanism for NF-\u03baB inhibition by GL. However, further studies are clearly needed to prove this hypothesis.",

It is likely that this effect is, at least partly, due to the inhibition of DNA binding of NF-\u03baB in the nucleus, which is different from the mechanism of glucocorticoids. The concentration of GL we used in this study is much higher than the blood concentration in clinical therapeutics. Therefore, it is uncertain whether the inhibition of NF-\u03baB that we showed here can explain the clinical effect of GL or not. However, further characterization of the effects of GL may provide a new insight into treating chronic inflammatory lung diseases.",

A: A549 cells were transfected with IL-8 promoter plasmid; pretreated with either GL (1 mM) or DEX (100 nM) combined with RU486 (100 nM) for 1 h; and then treated with TNF-\u03b1 (2.5 ng/ml) for 6 h. Transcriptional activity was assessed by luciferase assay. B: A549 cells were transfected with siRNA for GR and cultured for 72 h. Cells were then pretreated with either GL (1 mM) or DEX (100 nM) for 1 h and then treated with TNF-\u03b1 (2.5 ng/ml) for 4 h. Total RNA was prepared from the cells and IL-8 mRNA expression was measured by real-time PCR. C: A549 cells were transfected with MMTV promoter plasmid and then treated with either GL (1 mM) or DEX (100 nM) combined with RU486 (100 nM) for 36 h. Transcriptional activity was assessed by luciferase assay. Results represent the means \u00b1 S.E.M. from four independent experiments. *P<0.05, compared with TNF-\u03b1 or control; # P<0.05 vs without inhibitor.",
