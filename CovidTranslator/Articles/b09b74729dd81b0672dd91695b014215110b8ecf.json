We hypothesized that postnatal maturation causes developmental change in brainstem efferent airway-related vagal preganglionic neurons (AVPNs) within the rostral nucleus ambiguus (rNA) that project to the airways, and in pulmonary afferent fibers that terminate in the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS). Ferrets aged 7, 14, 21 and 42 days received intrapulmonary injection of Cholera toxin \u03b2 subunit (CT-b), a transganglionic retrograde tracer. Five days later, their brainstem was processed for dual immunolabeling of CT-b and the cholinergic marker, choline acetyl transferase (ChAT). CT-b labeled AVPNs and CT-b labeled afferent fiber optical density were analyzed. There was a significantly higher CT-b labeled cell number within the rNA at the youngest compared to older ages. All efferent CT-b labeled cells expressed ChAT. Optical density of CT-b labeled afferent fibers was also higher at 7 compared to 14 days. We conclude that the number of efferent AVPNs and afferent fiber optical density both diminish over the second postnatal week. We speculate that exposure to injurious agents in early postnatal life may inhibit natural remodeling and thereby enhance later vulnerability to airway hyperreactivity.",

Furthermore, the risk of airway hyperreactivity and need for asthma medication in former premature infants when compared to their term counterparts is increased over two to three fold respectively (6) (7) (8) (9) .

Efferent neural output from AVPNs located in the rostral nucleus ambiguus (rNA) is modulated by afferent input to the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS) from lung afferents such as slowly adapting stretch receptors, C-fibers and rapidly adapting receptors (10, 12, (16) (17) (18) . However, there is limited information on physiologic and developmental changes in maturation of airway reflex responses from lung afferents to airway smooth muscle. Prior studies have focused on C-fiber influences on ventilatory muscle responses rather than airway regulation (19) (20) (21) . Haxhiu-Poskurica et al., (22) characterized 2-10 week old piglets' responses to C-fiber stimulation and the resultant changes in tracheal smooth muscle tone; they documented immaturity of reflex responses of airway smooth muscle tone during early postnatal life when compared to reflex pathways regulating ventilatory responses. These results supported earlier studies demonstrating a diminished hypoxia-induced increase in airway smooth muscle tone in newborn dogs (23) , but it is unclear from these physiological studies whether airway reflex pathways are anatomically intact at an early postnatal age.",

Furthermore, similarities between human and ferret development of cholinergic neurons and airway smooth muscle innervation have suggested that this species is a favorable model for studying human respiratory neuronal reflex pathways (13, 17, 26) . In a previous study done in our laboratory (27) , the chemical profile of vagal preganglionic motor cells projecting to the airways was characterized in adult ferrets. AVPNs found within the rNA were shown to be cholinergic in nature and their stimulation resulted in a release of acetylcholine leading to contraction of airway smooth muscle. However, it is not known whether these cholinergic traits are expressed at an early postnatal age. Therefore, we sought to test the hypothesis that early postnatal maturation is associated with developmental change in both the density of afferent fibers reaching the NTS and the number of efferent AVPNs within the rNA, which project to the airways.",

We chose 7, 14, and 21 and 42 day old ferret pups to study agedependent changes in airway projection. We found that when animals were injected intrapulmonary with 50 \u03bcL CT-b, the number of CT-b labeled cells is significantly higher in the 7-day-old group when compared to the older groups. Between 7 and 14 days, the number of labeled cells in the 14-day-old group is significantly diminished. When a second group of animals was injected at 7 days with half of the original dose of CT-b to match the CT-b dose/ body weight, there was no significant difference in the CT-b labeled cell count between the 7day-old groups injected with either 50 or 25 \u03bcL of CT-b, indicating that the higher number of CT-b labeled cells is not related to a higher dose/body weight. Regardless of the CT-b dose injected at 7 days, the number of CT-b labeled cells was significantly higher than at later ages. These findings strongly suggest that the number of efferent AVPNs is higher at a younger age and diminishes with maturation.",

NTS subnuclei are involved in tracheobronchial and respiratory reflexes as they receive information from airway receptors such as pulmonary c-fibers, rapidly adapting and slowly adapting receptors. Our study showed afferent labeling in the ventrolateral and commissural sub-nuclei of the NTS, the primary sensory afferent relay center in the brainstem. The density of CT-b labeled fibers in the 7-day-old ferret pups was higher than in the 14-day-old ferret group. This suggests that similar maturational changes occur in both afferent innervation to the NTS and efferent AVPN projection to the airways.",

            "text": "Our observation of a decline in efferent cell bodies and afferent fibers is consistent with prior observations of neuronal death accompanying normal development in the central nervous system (29) . These studies described programmed cell death in areas such as the developing trigeminal system, olivocerebral system, cochlear nucleus and other areas (29) (30) (31) (32) . To our knowledge, there are no studies related to the evolution of programmed cell death for AVPNs in the rNA, which is part of the central airway reflex pathway. Our findings of a decrease in the number of AVPNs (in addition to the decrease in fiber density) support a role for developmental remodeling of neural circuits involved in autonomic control of airway caliber. Although experiments determining programmed cell death would have substantiated our hypothesis, it was beyond the scope of this project. Further studies employing techniques such as TUNEL testing and caspace-3 staining in this or comparable immature animal models are needed to support a role for apoptosis in the developmental remodeling we proposed.",

They found an increase in force generation as well as sensitivity to vagal stimulation in the younger animals, and they suggested that a decrease in contractile response in older animals could be related to parasympathetic neural function and maturation in the activity of acetylcholinesterase. These studies are however related to alteration in receptor/transductional changes associated with acetylcholine muscarinic receptor responses. In our study, we have shown that there is also a neuroanatomical change during maturation. The present results showing a higher density of fibers coupled with greater number of cells during early life contrasts with the relatively weak airway smooth muscle contractile response as previously demonstrated at that age (22) . We speculate that upregulation of inhibitory GABAergic interneurons and/or other inhibitory inputs to the common efferent pathway contribute to immature reflex responses in young animals in the face of an intact neuroanatomic reflex pathway. Furthermore, peripheral relaxant responses such as those mediated by prostaglandins may also contribute to relaxation in young animals (34) in response to a strong cholinergic efferent output from the brainstem.",

CT-b was used as a retrograde transganglionic tracer and experienced personnel injected CT-b into the lungs; however, we cannot rule out differences in the exact location of CT-b injection within the lung and the effect that this may have on distribution of the labeled cells within the brainstem. It is possible that in the present study, not all vagal preganglionic neurons that innervate the airway system could be labeled and therefore the number of cells reported reflects the labeled-AVPNs rather than the actual number of AVPNs that innervate the airways. These results are consistent with previous experiments conducted in adult ferrets in our laboratory (14, 19) . One must also be cautious when interpreting the distribution of afferent terminations in the NTS. Our confocal microscopy results did not differentiate between synaptic contacts and fibers of passage within the NTS. We used a design that allows morphometric quantification of these structures within the NTS sub-nuclei while avoiding double counting. Finally the ferret pup is a useful but fragile animal model for studying airway innervation and our statistical analyses in the older age groups are somewhat limited by small number of animals.",
