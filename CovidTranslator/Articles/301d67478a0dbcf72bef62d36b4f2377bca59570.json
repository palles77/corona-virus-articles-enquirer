The viral RNA replicase polyproteins of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) are encoded by the two overlapping open reading frames 1a and 1b, which are connected by a \u00c01 PRF signal. We evaluated the antiviral effects of antisense peptide nucleic acids (PNAs) targeting a highly conserved RNA sequence on the -PRF signal. The ribosomal frameshifting was inhibited by the PNA, which bound sequence-specifically a pseudoknot structure in the \u00c01 PRF signal, in cell lines as assessed using a dual luciferase-based reporter plasmid containing the \u00c01 PRF signal. Treatment of cells, which were transfected with a SARS-CoV-replicon expressing firefly luciferase, with the PNA fused to a cell-penetrating peptide (CPP) resulted in suppression of the replication of the SARS-CoV replicon, with a 50% inhibitory concentration of 4.4 lM. There was no induction of type I interferon responses by PNA treatment, suggesting that the effect of PNA is not due to innate immune responses. Our results demonstrate that \u00c01 PRF, critical for SARS-CoV viral replication, can be inhibited by CPP-PNA, providing an effective antisense strategy for blocking \u00c01 PRF signals.",

Except for several suspected SARS cases, additional infection has not been reported since April 2004. However, re-emergence is a possibility due to the identification of putative natural reservoirs (Wang et al., 2006) . Therefore, in the absence of specific, effective antiviral drugs for this newly emergent disease, there is a need for the development of therapeutics against SARS-CoV to control re-emergence (Cinatl et al., 2005; Tong, 2009) .",

The large SARS-CoV RNA genome produces eight 3 0 -co-terminal, nested subgenomic mRNAs (sg-mRNAs) for the efficient translation of structural and accessory proteins (Masters, 2006; Snijder et al., 2003) . The 5 0 two-thirds of the SARS-CoV genome encode two large replicase polyproteins, expressed by open reading frames (ORF) 1a and 1b. As in other coronaviruses, ORF1a and ORF1b are slightly overlapped and, because ORF1b lacks its own translation initiation sites, the proteins encoded by ORF1b are only translated as a fusion protein together with ORF1a by programmed \u00c01 ribosomal frameshifting (\u00c01 PRF), (Baranov et al., 2005; Brierley et al., 1989; Plant et al., 2005; Su et al., 2005) . The ORF1a and ORF1a/1b fusion proteins are proteolytically cleaved into 16 mature nonstructural proteins (nsps) that play multiple crucial roles during viral genome replication (Masters, 2006) . The \u00c01 PRF is thought to be essential for CoV genome replication because the coronavirus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), the key component of the replicase required for viral genome replication (Xu et al., 2003; Almazan et al., 2006; Prentice et al., 2004; te Velthuis et al., 2010) , is the first part of the ORF1a/1b protein synthesized after frameshifting.",

However, PRF, occurring by specific signals, increases the possibility of tRNA slippage up to 50% (Baranov et al., 2002; Namy et al., 2004) . The ribosomal frameshift signal consists of two elements, a heptanucleotide slippery site and a downstream tertiary RNA structure in the form of an RNA pseudoknot. SARS-CoV initiates \u00c01 frameshifting at the three-helix-containing RNA pseudoknot (Baranov et al., 2005; Plant et al., 2005; Su et al., 2005) . Recently, control of \u00c01 PRF efficiency has been shown to be critical for the maintenance of correct stoichiometric ratios of viral replicase proteins (Plant et al., 2010) . The \u00c01 PRF signal is conserved in sequence and structure, which may constrain the ability of SASR-CoV to develop drug resistant mutants, making it an attractive target for antiviral drug discovery.",

To make a SARS-CoV replicon expressing a luciferase reporter from sg-mRNA, the Feo gene (Tanabe et al., 2004) , comprising firefly luciferase and neomycin phosphotransferase, was fused to the transcription-regulating sequence 9 (TRS9) (Sola et al., 2005) required for synthesis of sg-mRNA9 of SARS-CoV. The TRS9 region was amplified from pBAC-SARS-CoV-REP plasmid (Almazan et al., 2006) using the forward primer MluI_F 5 0 -ACGCGTGGTGGTG CGCTTATAGCTAG-3 0 (MluI site underlined) and the reverse primer TRS-R 5 0 -CTTTATGTTTTTGGCGTCTTCCATTTTAATTTGTTCGTTTATTT AAAAC-3 0 (complimentary sequences to TRS9 underlined). The Feo gene was amplified from HCV replicon pRep-Feo (Tanabe et al., 2004) using the forward primer TRS-F 5 0 -GTTTTAAATAAAC GAACAAATTAAAATGGAAGACGCCAAAAACATAAAG-3 0 (TRS9 sequences underlined) and the reverse primer BamHI-R 5 0 -GG ATCCTAGAAGAACTCGTCAAGAAG-3 0 (BamHI site underlined). The amplified TRS9 region was fused to the 5 0 -end of the Feo gene by bridge PCR using MluI_F and BamHI_R primers, and the resulting PCR products were inserted into the pCR2.1-TOPO vector (Invitrogen). The inserted fragment, prepared by digestion of the resulting plasmid with MluI and BamHI, was then subcloned into the pBAC-SARS-CoV-REP plasmid digested with AscI and BamHI to make the pSARS-REP-Feo plasmid. For construction of a replication-deficient replicon control plasmid, the MluI-digested fragment from the replicase-coding gene was inserted in the reverse orientation into the pSARS-REP-Feo, to obtain pSARS-REP-Feo-MluIrev. For construction of another control plasmid, pSARS-REP-DTRSFeo, which lacks the TRS9, the forward primer 5 0 -ATTTAGAGA CGTACTTGTTGTTT TAATGGAAGACGCCAAAAACATAAAG-3 0 and the reverse primer 5 0 -CTTTATGTTTTTGGCGTCTTCCATTAAAACAACAAGTACGTCTCTAA AT-3 0 were used to amplify a DNA fragment lacking the TRS9 region. All replicon plasmids were amplified in the Escherichia coli strain, EPI300 (EPICENTRE Biotechnologies). E. coli cells were transformed in electroporation cuvettes (1 mm electrode gap) using a Gene Pulser II electroporator (Bio-Rad Laboratories) at 1.8 kV, 200 X, and 25 lF. Replicon plasmids were isolated using the BAC isolation kit (EPICENTRE Biotechnologies) and further purified by cesium chloride density gradient centrifugation. Replication of the SARS-CoV replicon in mammalian cells was assessed by realtime qRT-PCR, as described below, and expression of SARS-CoV capsid N protein was confirmed by Western blot analysis with anti-SARS-CoV N protein antibody (Abcam). For preparation of the \u00c01 PRF probe, cDNA corresponding to the \u00c01 PRF signal was synthesized by reverse transcription using the reverse primer 5 0 -AAAAGCCCTGTAGACGACAT-3 0 , complementary to nucleotides (nts) 13,456-13,475 of SARS-CoV genome.

As shown in Fig. 1B , most of FS PNA formed a complex at a probe-to-PNA molar ratio of 1:5 (lane 3). In contrast, HCV PNA, targeting hepatitis C virus X-RNA at the 3 0 -UTR of the viral genome, did not form a complex even at a higher concentration of PNA (lane 5). The FSm2 PNA, in which two guanosine residues (complementary to nt 13,463 and 13,466) in the middle of the FS PNA sequence were changed to cytosine residues, formed a complex at a ratio of 1:10. However, the amount of the complex was much less than that formed with the probe and FS PNA at the molar ratio of 1:1 (compare lane 2 with lane 6). Together, these results indicate the sequence-specific, efficient binding of FS PNA to its target in the complex pseudoknot structure of the -PRF signal.",

The pJD464 reporter plasmid, in which the \u00c01 PRF signal is inactivated such that the ORF of firefly luciferase is placed in frame with that of Renilla luciferase, was used as a zero-frame control plasmid. Vero cells were pre-treated with various concentrations of PNAs and subsequently transfected with pJD464 or pJD502 plasmid to test whether CPP-PNAs inhibits \u00c01 PRF. As shown in Fig. 2B , \u00c01 frameshifting was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by Tat-FS PNA. An approximately 94% reduction of frameshift efficiency was observed at 5 lM, whereas a non-specific PNA Tat-UpFS, designed to target the region not present in the \u00c01 PRF signal, did not inhibit \u00c01 frameshifting. Furthermore, Tat-FSm2 PNA, carrying two mismatched sequences to the target compared to FS PNA, was less effective in inhibiting \u00c01 frameshifting than Tat-FS PNA. Consistent with the EMSA results shown in Fig. 1B , Tat-HCV PNA displayed no inhibitory effect (Fig. 2C) .

However, replicons allowing convenient, quantitative assays for viral genome replication have not yet been developed. In the present study, we constructed a SARS-CoV replicon that expresses a luciferase reporter gene, using the previous SARS-CoV replicon pBAC-SARS-CoV-REP (Almazan et al., 2006 ) as a backbone vector, for the sensitive, quantitative detection of viral genome and for cell-based analysis of the antiviral activity of FS PNA. First, the Feo gene (a firefly luciferase gene fused to a neomycin phosphotransferase gene) was amplified from the HCV replicon plasmid pRep-Feo (Tanabe et al., 2004) and linked to cDNA of TRS9, a cis-acting RNA element required for sg-mRNA of SARS-CoV. The fused DNA fragment was inserted between the replicase gene (ORF 1a and 1b) and the N gene in pBAC-SARS-CoV-REP (Almazan et al., 2006) . The resulting pSARS-REP-Feo plasmid (Fig. 3A, Feo) is expected to produce a viral genome lacking the genes encoding structural proteins, except the N protein, from the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter at the 5 0 -end of the cloned viral cDNA, in transfected cells. In addition, sg-mRNA harboring the Feo gene is expected to be synthesized from the TRS9 preceding the Feo gene by a discontinuous mechanism (Moreno et al., 2008) to display luciferase activity. We also constructed pSARS-REP-DTRSFeo, in which a cDNA representing 16-nt TRS9 sequence (5 0 -AAUAAACGAACAAAUU-3 0 ) preceding the Feo gene was deleted, to prevent the synthesis of sg-mRNAs harboring the Feo gene. Luciferase activity is unlikely to be detected in cells transfected with this plasmid, unless internal initiation of translation, read-through of ribosome complex, or aberrant, non-TRS-mediated generation of sg-mRNAs containing the Feo gene occurs. Finally, another replicon plasmid, pSARS-REP-Feo-MluIrev, in which ORF1a and ORF1b encoding the replicase proteins were altered by inserting the MluI-digested DNA fragment from the replicase genes into the same vector in the reverse orientation, was also constructed and used as a negative control plasmid.",

During replication of SARS-CoV, N sg-mRNA is generated through discontinuous sg-RNA synthesis by the replicase, including the RdRp (nsp12) (Moreno et al., 2008; Pasternak et al., 2001; Thiel et al., 2003) . When the minus-strand viral RNA being synthesized reaches TRS9 (Fig. 3A) , located upstream of the N-gene, the TRS triggers the minus-strand to jump to the leader TRS (TRS-L depicted in Fig. 3A ) sequence, located at the 5 0 -UTR of the SARS-CoV genome, to complete the synthesis of the rest of the leader sequence. Therefore, the copy number of N gene-specific sg-mRNAs (N sg-mRNA) synthesized during the viral genome replication represents the level of SARS-CoV replication. At 30 h post-transfection, total RNAs were isolated from the cells and N sg-mRNA levels were determined by real-time qRT-PCR. As shown in Fig. 3b , BHK21 cells transfected with each of the replicon plasmids, pBAC-SARS-CoV-REP, pSARS-REP-Feo, or pSARS-REP-DTRSFeo produced a similar level of sg-mRNAs (6 \u00c2 10 7 -2 \u00c2 10 8 genome copies/lg of total RNA), whereas pSARS-REP-Feo-MluIrev was found defective in the generation of sg-mRNAs. We could detect a high level of luciferase activity only in the cells transfected with pSARS-REP-Feo plasmid (Fig. 3C ). In addition, synthesis of sg-mRNAs containing Feo gene was confirmed by detection of 300-bp Feo gene-specific RT-PCR-amplified products (bottom panel). The luciferase activity in the cells transfected with a control plasmid, pSARS-REP-DTRSFeo, which lacks the TRS9 fused to the Feo gene and thereby is expected to fail to yield sg-mRNAs for the Feo gene, remained at background levels. Consistent with the luciferase activity assay results, we did not detect sg-mRNA containing the Feo gene in cells transfected with pSARS-REP-DTRSFeo, even though this replicon plasmid was able to generate sg-mRNA for the N-gene, as shown in Fig. 3B . As expected, neither N gene-specific sg-mRNA nor Feo gene-specific sg-mRNA was generated from pSARS-REP-Feo-MluIrev. As shown in Fig. 3D , we used Western blot analysis to confirm the expression of N protein in two different cell lines, BHK-21 and HEK293, which are known to support SARS-CoV replication (Almazan et al., 2006; Kaye, 2006) upon transfection with the pSARS-REP-Feo plasmid. In contrast, replication-defective pSARS-REP-Feo-MluIrev did not lead to accumulation of the N protein.",

To confirm that the inhibition of viral replication by PNA was not due to IFN responses activated by PNA, we wondered whether there was an induction of IFN-b expression in HEK293 cells treated with 10 lM Tat-FS PNA. As shown in Fig. 4C , Tat-conjugated FS PNA, as well as Tat-FSm2, had no potent impact on the induction of IFN-b responses, while the luciferase activity driven by IFN-b promoter activation increased by 225-fold in cells transfected with a plasmid expressing the active form of IRF3. Two RNA molecules, poly(I:C) and HCV 3 0 -UTR, which are known to be recognized by MDA5 and RIG-I, respectively and induce type I IFN production (Kato et al., 2008; Pichlmair et al., 2006; Saito et al., 2008) , also induced IFN-b promoter activation under the same experimental conditions. Furthermore, qRT-PCR analysis showed that neither Tat-FS nor Tat-FSm2 resulted in a transcriptional upregulation of IFN-b gene as well as an IFN-stimulated gene ISG56, thus confirming our result with the reporter system. Altogether, these results indicate that inhibition of SARS-CoV replication by Tat-FS PNA was not due to indirect effects caused by induction of IFN-b expression in cell culture.",

In the present study, we designed an antisense PNA targeting a selected region of the pseudoknot structure in the SARS-CoV \u00c01 PRF signal and evaluated its effects on frameshifting and viral RNA replication. We demonstrated that the FS PNA targeting stems 2 and 3 effectively down-regulates SARS-CoV replication by interfering with \u00c01 frameshifting. Sequence-specific inhibition of \u00c01 PRF by FS PNA was demonstrated in cell-based assays, using bicistronic frameshift assay reporter plasmids. Our results are consistent with the previous findings showing, by mutational analysis, that the specific sequences and structures of stems 2 and 3 in the pseudoknot structure are important for frameshifting (Plant et al., 2005) . A series of mutations disrupting stem 2 was shown to lead to a dramatic reduction of frameshifting (Baranov et al., 2005; Plant et al., 2005; Su et al., 2005) . Moreover, we have demonstrated that the pseudoknot structure of SARS-CoV is a critical stimulatory component of the \u00c01 PRF signal required for viral replication.

However, alignment analysis of the \u00c01 PRF signals from over 130 different strains of SARS-CoV showed that the target of the PNA used in this study is extremely conserved in sequence. Therefore, there is a good possibility that emerging FS PNA-resistant mutants will have to pay a significant cost in decreased \u00c01 PRF, leading to a decreased level of viral replicase proteins encoded by the ORF1b downstream of the \u00c01 PRF signal. Our results collectively underscore that the conserved pseudoknot sequence targeted by antisense FS PNA is a crucial druggable target, particularly in view of the importance of the maintenance of stoichiometry between nonstructural proteins encoded by ORF1a and 1b for SASR-CoV replication (Plant et al., 2010) .",

            "text": "Ribosomal pausing caused by the presence of stable RNA structures such as pseudoknots has been proposed to be an initial step driving \u00c01 PRF (Namy et al., 2006) . Consistent with this notion, prior studies have demonstrated that antisense oligonucleotides, including morpholino oligonucleotides, designed to anneal to mRNA downstream of the slippery-site, induce ribosome frameshifting in an in vitro translation system using rabbit reticulocyte lysates (Howard et al., 2004; Olsthoorn et al., 2004; Yu et al., 2010) . Contrary to previous reports, our results demonstrate that the antisense FS PNA, which targets the 3 0 -end region of the SARS-CoV pseudoknot structure, including stem 2, loop 3, and part of stem 3, impedes frameshifting. Binding of PNA, which has high hybridization ability due to its flexible, neutral backbone (Hanvey et al., 1992; Nielsen et al., 1991) , to this target might lead to disruption of stable structures in stems 2 and 3 through the formation of an RNA-PNA hybrid duplex structure. The resulting hybrid molecules would probably be more stable due to less electrostatic repulsion forces between PNA and RNA molecules than the RNA-R-NA base-paring present in the parental pseudoknot structure. Consequently, the RNA structures upstream of this PNA-binding site might form an alternative secondary structure for ribosomes to elongate without pausing and thus interfere with frameshifting. Alternatively, as long as the stem1 structure remains intact, ribosomal shifting may still occur. Supporting this hypothesis, previous studies have shown that the stable stem-structure at the bottom of the stem 1 plays an important role in efficient frameshifting (Baranov et al., 2005) , since the structure hampers elongation of peptides by acting as a barrier for the ribosome-associated helicase (Namy et al., 2004) . Even if \u00c01 PRF occurs by the preserved stem 1 structure, the stable PNA-RNA structures upstream of stem 1 would hinder the ribosome elongation, resulting in suppression of the translation of downstream genes. It is also possible that a PNA-RNA hybrid structure downstream of the slip-site, per se, forces the paused ribosomes to situate over the incorrect frameshift sequence. In summary, alterations in RNA secondary structure, either at the PNA-annealing site and/or an upstream region, which could be caused by PNA hybridization to stems 2 and 3, along with loop 3, appears to contribute to the suppression of frameshifting. Whatever the mechanism, such changes in the pseudoknot structure may alter a specific kinetic barrier to ribosome translocation, playing a role in the fine modulation of frameshifting. Indeed, previous studies have consistently revealed that the extent of pausing of ribosomes does not appear to be a sufficient determinant for efficient frameshifting (Kontos et al., 2001) . The conformational feature of the pseudoknot, but not simply the ribosome stalling caused by a stacked stable stem structure, has been suggested to be critical for the promotion of frameshifting (Somogyi et al., 1993) . Finally, the pseudoknot-targeting PNA might interfere with the interaction between the \u00c01 PRF signal and viral and/or cellular protein, if any. It is currently unknown whether cellular proteins are involved in frameshifting by binding to the \u00c01 PRF signal or whether SARS-CoV-encoded proteins participate in negative or positive regulation of frameshifting during the infection cycle.",

In cellbased in vitro assays, IFN-b shows the most potent inhibitory effect against SARS-CoV among IFN-a, b, and c when tested in virus-infected Vero E6 cells (Cinatl et al., 2003; Hensley et al., 2004) . We confirmed the anti-SARS-CoV activity of IFN-b; treatment with 250 IU/ml human IFN-b 1a led to 46% inhibition of SARS-CoV replication in our replicon system (Fig. 4A) . We also found that Tat-conjugated PNA is not a potent innate immune response stimulator, leading to induction of IFN-b expression. We observed neither a decrease in viral replication with a control Tat-conjugated PNA nor induction of IFN-b response by FS-PNA. We conclude that the suppression of SARS-CoV replication was primarily mediated by inhibition of frameshifting by FS-PNA. However, it is possible that CPP-PNA or PNA itself binds to known or not-yet-defined extracellular or intracellular receptors of immune cells to induce unexpected immune responses in vivo. It has been reported that PNA stimulates IFN-c in peripheral blood mononuclear cell cultures and inhibits the replication of HIV (Hirschman and Chen, 1996) . Whether Tat-conjugated PNA mediates its antiviral effect through IFN-c awaits in vivo experiments, although SARS-CoV replication is not effectively controlled by IFN-c at least in cell culture (Cinatl et al., 2003) . An evaluation of the in vivo efficacy of PNA is needed to clarify the immune response induction issues.",

Further, we show that the CPP-PNA can access the complex \u00c01 PRF pseudoknot structure to interfere with \u00c01 frameshifting, leading to inhibition of SARS-CoV replication. It is fully expected that CPP-PNAs targeting \u00c01 PRF signal of other pathogenic RNA viruses will have similar antiviral activity. We also established a SARS-CoV replicon system enabling the high-throughput screening of antivirals. The system proved to be a robust replication assay tool when applied to the evaluation of antiviral activities of PNAs. Using this replicon, we demonstrated for the first time that CPP-PNAs targeting the \u00c01 PRF have potential as an anti-viral reagent against SARS-CoV. a grant from the Seoul R&BD Program (Grant 10580) and a grant from Translation Research Center for Protein Function Control funded by the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF-2009-0092959) .

The pSARS-CoV-REP-Feo-MluIrev (MluIrev), which is defective in synthesis of functional replicase proteins, was used as a negative control plasmid. TRSs are indicated by a black box and leader sequences by a box with deviant crease lines. Black arrows indicate primers used for detection of N gene-specific sg-mRNAs and gray arrows for detection of sg-mRNAs containing the Feo gene. (B and C) BHK-21 cells were co-transfected with replicon plasmids and pRL-TK used for normalization of transfection efficiency, by electroporation. At 30 h post-transfection, cells were harvested and analyzed for sg-mRNA level, luciferase activity, and intracellular SARS-CoV nucleocapsid N protein level. (B) The N gene-specific sg-mRNA level was quantified by real-time qRT-PCR using a TaqMan probe. Subgenomic RNA copy numbers per lg total RNA are shown. ND, not detected. (C) Firefly luciferase activity from the replicon plasmid was normalized to Renilla luciferase activity from the pRL-TK plasmid. Normalized luciferase activity of cells transfected with pSARS-CoV-REP was defined as 100. Endogenous sg-mRNAs containingFeo gene was amplified by RT-PCR and resulting PCR products were resolved by agarose gel electrophoresis (low panel). (D) BHK-21 or HEK293 cells were left untransfected (Mock) or transfected with the plasmid indicated above the blots. N protein and a-tubulin were detected by Western blot analysis. (E) Kinetics of SARS-CoV replicon replication in transiently transfected cells. BHK-21 cells were transfected with pSARS-REP-Feo (d) or pSARS-REP-DTRSFeo (N) by electroporation. Cells were harvested at each given time point and store at \u00c080\u00b0C until analysis. Luciferase activity was measured with the same amount of cell lysate. Data from one representative experiment from two independent experiments with similar results are shown.",

(A) HEK293 cells, co-transfected with pSARS-REP-Feo and pRL-TK, were treated with each indicated PNA (10 lM) in serum-free DMEM for 3 h at 6 h post-transfection. Tat-conjugated J3U2 PNA (Tat-J3U2) targeting the 3 0 -UTR of JEV genome was used as a negative control. IFN-b (250 IU/ml) and IFN-b inducer poly(I:C) (0.8 lg/ml) were used as positive controls. Poly(I:C) was transfected into the cells using lipofectamin RNAiMAX agent. After 30 h incubation in complete medium, cells were harvested and luciferase activity was measured. (B) The IC 50 value for the inhibition of SARS-CoV replication by Tat-FS PNA was determined at various PNA concentrations. (C) HEK293 cells were co-transfected with IFNb-pGL3 luciferase reporter plasmid and pRL-TK used for normalization of transfection efficiency, prior to mock-treatment or treatment with 10 lM of Tat-FS or Tat-FSm2 PNA. Poly(I:C) or HCV 3 0 -UTR at a final concentration of 2 lg/ml or expression of an active form of IRF3, IRF3(5D) was used as a positive control for stimulation of IFN-b promoter activity. The normalized firefly luciferase activity of the mock-treated cells is considered one unit and the increase in luciferase activity is shown as fold induction. (D) HEK293 cells treated with PNAs or indicated RNAs as in (C) were analyzed for IFN-b and ISG56 mRNA abundance by real-time qRT-PCR. Fold increase in mRNA abundance is shown. (E) The real-time PCR products representing the abundance of the indicated mRNAs were visualized by agarose gel electrophoresis and ethidium bromide staining. Detection of GAPDH mRNA served as control. Results are from a representative experiment of n = 3 that gave similar results.
