The predominant symptom was frequency in 40 patients, urge incontinence in 31 and stress incontinence in 66. There appeared to be a correlation between urge incontinence and a hyperretlexic cystometrogram but no correlation was noted between either frequency or stress incontinence and the cystometrogram profile. The urethral pressure profile showed a correlation between stress incontinence and the lowest profile measurements. Frequency and urge incontinence had similar profile measurements except for maximum urethral planimetry. Electromyography showed that the external urethral sphincter had a different finding than the levator ani or the external anal sphincters in all 3 groups of female patients. The external urethral sphincter had a higher percentage of denervation than the other 2 muscles, especially in the stress incontinence group.",

Of the patients who primarily complained of symptoms suggesting stress incontinence 42 per cent were found to have detrusor hyperreflexia and, thus, were candidates for anticholinergic medication rather than surgical therapy. This observation shows the diagnostic value of cystometry in incontinent female patients who present with symptoms suggesting active as well as passive incontinence. The authors do not propose and I do not believe that cystometry or urethral pressure profilometry is of value in female subjects who have straightforward stress incontinence uncomplicated by previous surgical intervention or symptoms suggesting detrusor hyperreflexia.",

Also noteworthy is the observation that denervation was more common in the external urethral sphincter than it was in the other pelvic floor skeletal muscles tested. Although the incidence of denervation was highest (92 per cent) in patients who had had a bladder or urethral operation it also was found commonly (44 per cent) in patients who had not had a regional operation. Possibly, child birth is responsible for denervation in the non-surgically treated patients. In any case, to evaluate the merits of this intriguing clinical observation the incidence of denervation (real or artifactual) in nulliparous women and in postpartum patients who are not incontinent must be determined.",

This conclusion seems to be justified in the patient population studied. We also have found that the electromyography recordings vary in patients with multiple sclerosis. However, the electromyography recordings from the various pelvic floor muscles in the normal male subjects we have studied have been similar in appearance. Thus, I concluded that the variations in electromyographic activity recorded in incontinent female subjects and multiple sclerotic patients represent changes induced by disease rather than a difference in the floor muscular innervation.",
