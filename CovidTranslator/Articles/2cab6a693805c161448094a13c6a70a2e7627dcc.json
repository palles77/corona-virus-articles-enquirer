However, some cases had loosening at the fixation site. In 2004, the second-generation implant was designed as a talar body prosthesis without a bone peg and was expected to perform the bearing function on the talar body. However, talar head rupture occurred in some cases because of higher pressure to the talar head. Therefore, total talar prosthesis was developed in 2005 and has been used since. In this article, diagnosis and treatment of talar osteonecrosis, as well as surgical technique for artificial talus implantation, are discussed. ",
