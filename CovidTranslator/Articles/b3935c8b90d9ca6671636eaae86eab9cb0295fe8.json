Chicken egg yolk antibodies (IgY) are efficient in protecting neonatal calves from RVA diarrhea; however, the value of this intervention in calves once diarrhea has appeared is unclear. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the application of RVA-specific IgY as a passive treatment in those cases. The experimental groups were: G1 = RVA-specific IgY treatment; G2 = no Ab treatment; and G3 = colostrum deprived + no Ab treatment. IgY treatment significantly reduced virus shedding, diarrhea duration and severity compared to G2 and G3 calves. However, it caused a partial suppression of systemic Ab responses to RVA that could be associated with less severe diarrhea. The oral treatment with IgY for 7 days was associated with significantly higher antibody secreting cell responses in the calves compared with other groups of animals.",

In 1969, electron microcopy was used to detect virus associated with neonatal calf diarrhea (Mebus et al., 1969) . Multiple etiological agents are responsible for neonatal diarrhea in calves including RVA, coronavirus, Escherichia coli, Salmonella species, Clostridium perfringens, Cryptosporidium and Coccidia (Bellinzoni et al., 1990; Holland, 1990; Bendali et al., 1999a; Svennerholm and Steele, 2004) . Among these agents, bovine RVA is considered the major cause of enteritis and diarrhea in artificially reared calves, causing important economic losses related to death, treatment costs and reduction in weight gain of affected animals (Malik et al., 1995; Martella et al., 2010) . Diarrheal disease severity is enhanced by several factors including herd management, environment and host nutritional and immunological status (Saif and Smith, 1985; Bendali et al., 1999b) . The disease usually occurs in 2-to 8-week-old calves and the severity decreases as the age increases. The incubation period is very short (12-24 h) and the diarrhea is self-limiting within 5 to 7 days, unless secondary bacterial infections occur (Svennerholm and Steele, 2004; Dhama et al., 2009) . Bovine RVA strains are genetically and antigenically heterogeneous. Their genetic classification is based on the genes coding the two outer capsid proteins, VP7 and VP4, determining G and P types, respectively. The single most prevalent genotype combination among bovine RVA strains has been G6P[5] , although spatiotemporal and herd farm type (cattle or dairy) differences in RVA strain distribution are observed worldwide (Garaicoechea et al., 2006; Badaracco et al., 2012; Papp et al., 2013) .",

Being a gastrointestinal pathogen, the local gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) responses are critical for virus clearance and prevention of RVA reinfection. The RVA-specific passive maternal antibodies (Ab) acquired by colostrum intake (systemically absorbed and re-secreted to the gut) as well as Ab present in maternal milk (acting locally) are key factors in protecting the neonates (Stott and Fellah, 1983; Besser et al., 1988; Saif and Fernandez, 1996; Barrandeguy et al., 1998; Fernandez et al., 1998; Hodgins et al., 1999; Kohara and Tsunemitsu, 2000; Parre\u00f1o et al., 2004) . Dams are immunized with RVA-inactivated vaccines in the last third of pregnancy, between 60 to 30 days prior to parturition to enhance maternal Ab levels in serum to promote a higher concentration of IgG1 immunoglobulins in colostrum (Holland, 1990; Saif and Fernandez, 1996; Barrandeguy et al., 1998; Svennerholm and Steele, 2004) . Although Ab present in colostrum enter the circulation, the protection against this enteric disease is primarily dependent on the presence of RVA-specific Ab in the calves' intestinal lumen, indicating that protection could be achieved by the presence of passive Ab in the gut lumen combined with a rapid active antibody secreting cell (ASC) response in the intestinal lamina propria (Saif and Fernandez, 1996; Fernandez et al., 1998) . Regarding passive immune protection, calves receiving pooled colostrum from vaccinated dams prior to gut closure (within 4 h after birth) were protected against severe diarrhea Parre\u00f1o et al., 2004) . However, RVAspecific Ab from colostrum decline after calving and seem to be insufficient against high challenge doses of virus . On the other hand, supplementation of milk diet with immune colostrum significantly reduced diarrhea and delayed viral shedding onset (Kohara and Tsunemitsu, 2000; Parre\u00f1o et al., 2010) . However, the production of immune milks based on colostrum supplementation was not an industrially scalable alternative. This highlights the need of another source of large amounts of Ab for immunotherapeutic purposes in a cost-efficient way.",

            "text": "Recently, chickens have attracted considerable attention as an alternative source of antibodies, as IgY is deposited in the egg yolk in large quantities, making chickens an ideal source for specific polyclonal antibodies (Touchette et al., 2003; Kovacs-Nolan and Mine, 2004) . There are several reports of chicken egg yolk Ab (IgY) being highly effective in protecting neonatal calves from bovine RVA diarrhea (Ikemori et al., 1992 Kuroki et al., 1994 Kuroki et al., , 1997 . Our group has described that prophylactic provision of hyperimmune crude fluid egg yolk to newborn calves during the first 14 consecutive days of life significantly reduced the severity of diarrhea after oral inoculation with virulent bovine RVA. The treatment also prevented RVA diarrhea and virus shedding after a second virus challenge (seven days after the end of the passive Ab treatment). We observed that egg yolk treatment promoted a modulatory effect on ASC responses in the gut, inducing high numbers of bovine RVAspecific IgA ASCs (Vega et al., 2011) . This 14-day-long prophylactic treatment could be advantageous in dairy herds where bovine RVA is a major epidemiological concern. Still, other oral IgY-based treatments can be useful in dairy farms where RVA-associated diarrhea is a concern but less severe, decreasing the therapy's costs. Little is known about the usefulness of IgY Ab as a treatment to bovine RVA once virus infection has already induced diarrhea under controlled environmental conditions. The aim of the present study was to determine the potential application of spray dried egg yolk powder enriched in bovine RVA-specific IgY Ab as a passive therapeutic treatment to be applied for 7 days after the appearance of diarrhea in neonatal calves experimentally challenged with virulent bovine RVA (G6P[5] strain). The potential of the powder as a commercial product was further evaluated.",

The animals were housed in individual isolation rooms under a strict management protocol as previously described . Calves were randomly assigned to one of the following feeding groups (G): G1 = colostrum (C) + milk supplemented with bovine RVA-specific egg yolk powder with a final ELISA IgY Ab titer to Indiana RVA strain of 4096 (n = 4); G2 = C + RVA Ab free milk (n = 5) and G3 = colostrum deprived (CD) + RVA Ab free milk (n = 6). These last two groups of calves were considered controls. Colostrum deprived calves are often found in herds where animals are not artificially assisted and many of the newborns fail to fed before the first hours of life. Calves in G1 and G2 received 1 L of colostrum pool from RVA non-vaccinated cows (but seropositive to RVA due to natural exposure to the virus in the field) within the first 6 h of life (prior to gut closure). This colostrum had a virus neutralization (VN) Ab titer to Indiana bovine RVA strain (genotype G6P[5]) of 65,536 and an IgG1 ELISA Ab titer of 16,384 and was produced as previously described Vega et al., 2011) . All animals in G1 and G2 had a circulating ELISA mean IgG1 Ab titer to Indiana bovine RVA strain of~1024/4096 in serum after colostrum intake. Calves in G3 did not receive colostrum but 1 L of RVA Ab free milk at this time point, remaining seronegative to bovine RVA, as expected. The milk used in the experiment was commercial sterilized bovine milk for human consumption (Mastellone Hnos., Argentina). All animals were orally inoculated with 10 5.85 Focus Forming Units (FFU) of virulent bovine RVA strain G6P[5] (Indiana strain) between the third and fourth feeding (0 post-inoculation day -PID) . This viral dose was previously confirmed to cause diarrhea and virus shedding in 100% of inoculated CD calves . This viral strain is one of the most prevalent RVA strains circulating in newborn calves in Argentina (Garaicoechea et al., 2006; Badaracco et al., 2012) and worldwide (Midgley et al., 2012; Papp et al., 2013) . Immediately after the onset of diarrhea, only calves assigned to IgY passive treatment group (G1) received 2 L of the supplemented milk twice a day for 7 days with a final ELISA IgY Ab titer to bovine RVA (Indiana strain) of 4096. After this time, all calves in this group were fed milk without supplemental Abs. Calves in G2 and G3 were fed commercial RVA Ab free milk during the experiment. All the calves were euthanized at PID 21 to study the primary Ab responses to bovine RVA infection.",

Passive treatment with egg yolk powder containing bovine RVA IgY Abs significantly reduced diarrhea duration and severity compares with colostrum deprived calves For this experiment, newborn calves assigned to each experimental group were orally inoculated with virulent bovine RVA (Indiana strain, G6P[5] genotype) at 36 h of life. The onset of diarrhea after virus inoculation was statistically similar for all groups of calves, (G1: 2.0 days; G2: 1.2 days; G3: 2 days). In agreement, bovine RVA infectious viral particles were detected in feces from all animals by the same day that diarrhea appeared. Results for diarrhea and virus shedding are detailed in Fig. 1 . Following the experimental design, calves assigned to G1 received RVA IgY Ab treatment within 2 h since the development of diarrhea and for seven consecutive days. Diarrhea in this group terminated an average of 3.2 days after the beginning of the passive treatment (range 2 to 5 days). This duration was significantly shorter than the ones registered for CD calves (10.4 days, G3) while animals fed colostrum followed by RVA Ab free milk (G2) developed RVAassociated diarrhea of an intermediate duration (average 7.6 days). Interestingly, virus shedding duration was significantly shorter in calves in G1 (average 4.5 days) than in animals in G2 (average 11.6 days), while calves in G3 showed an intermediate duration of 6 days in Fig. 1 . Virus shedding, diarrhea duration and coproAbs titers in feces of the experimental groups of calves. Calves in G1 were fed two liters of commercial bovine milk supplemented with 100 g of egg yolk powder containing Indiana RVA strain-specific IgY Abs, twice a day for 7 days from diarrhea onset. Calves in G2 and G3 were fed RVA Ab free milk without any supplementation. Continuous lines represent the average ELISA Ab titer of isotype-specific bovine coproAbs to bovine Indiana RVA strain detected in feces. Dashed line in G1 represents the average ELISA IgY Ab titer to Indiana RVA strain. Columns represent average daily profile of virus shedding for experimental calves expressed as FFU/mL. Horizontal bar indicates mean diarrhea duration. Tables included in each graph indicate diarrhea duration defined as the number of days with fecal score \u22652.

However, the areas under the curve of virus shedding (AUC) were not significantly different between the experimental groups of calves. Severity of RVA-associated diarrhea, considered as the average AUC of diarrhea score for each group of calves, was also significantly lower in RVA IgY Ab treated calves (G1) than in either of the other groups of animals (G2 and G3). Furthermore, there was a significant reduction in the number of days with RVA-associated hyperthermia for calves in G1 (2.5 days in average) compared with animals in control groups (G2: 12 days and G3: 11.4 days). It is important to mention that animals receiving passive RVA-specific IgY Ab treatment (G1) did not show other clinical signs of bovine RVA infection like anorexia, dehydration or depression (personal observation, data not shown), while they were evident in all calves in G2 and specially in G3.",

This was associated with the presence of VN activity to bovine RVA at this experimental time point for calves in G1 and G2. The IgG1 Ab titers to Indiana RVA strain remained constant in serum samples from all the animals in G1 and G2 during the experiment.

As expected, while no Abs were detected in serum samples from calves in G3 (CD animals) at PID 0, ELISA Ab titers of IgG1 to bovine RVA increased progressively from PID 7 to PID 21, and they were statistically similar between animals in all experimental groups at PID 14 and until the end of the experiment (PID 21).

Another important novel feature observed in this study is the induction of a stronger RVA-specific ASC response in calves receiving milk supplemented with chicken egg yolk powder than in control animals receiving colostrum (G2) or CD calves (G3) fed RVA Ab free milk. This feature was previously observed in calves fed milk supplemented with crude egg yolk administered as a preventive strategy for a longer period of time (Vega et al., 2011) . These results together demonstrate that this immunomodulatory activity is local, affecting only GALT ASC responses. In the current experiment, calves were fed egg yolk powder for only 7 days, half of the time compared to previous prophylactic experiments. Yet, the modulatory effect of egg yolk supplementation was clearly maintained. These high numbers of bovine RVA-specific ASC detected in the GALT of egg yolk treated animals represent a powerful active immune strategy to control bovine RVA diarrhea as well as potentially other enteric infections. These results are in agreement with the presence of immunomodulatory molecules in the egg yolk, that promote B cell clonal expansion and IgA switching related to anti-inflammatory responses to dietary antigens (Nelson et al., 2007) . It has been previously demonstrated that this immunomodulatory effect of egg yolk is not related to IgY Abs itself, as calves treated with semi-purified IgY Abs for 14 days as well as gnotobiotic pigs fed milk supplemented with semi-purified IgY Abs for 9 days did not develop statistically higher ASC responses in GALT than control groups (Vega et al., 2012) . However, it seems like IgY Ab treatment caused a partial suppression of active systemic Ab responses to bovine RVA. This could be associated with less severe diarrhea in treated calves, as systemic Ab responses to bovine RVA seem to be higher in colostrum deprived calves, while G2 calves showed intermediate responses.",

            "text": "It has been reported that IgY Abs against bovine RVA can be used to prevent virus-associated diarrhea in newborn calves (Vega et al., 2011) . In this work we focus on the treatment of clinical signs of bovine RVA infection once they appear, as many farmers would use a specific treatment more than a preventive one. We also shortened the passive treatment from 14 to 7 days when compared to previous prophylactic experiments by our group Vega et al., 2011) . However, even with only 7 days of twice daily continuous treatment, IgY Abs were a strong and versatile immune strategy against bovine RVA-associated diarrhea. Another important feature is the fact that the passive treatment administered to calves in this experiment consisted mainly of egg yolk powder, which can be easily manipulated and kept at room temperature for long periods of time (even until 12-16 months). These properties emphasize the advantages of egg yolk as a source of specific antibodies. Avian Ab represents both a reduction and refinement in animal use (Karlsson et al., 2004) . When considering Ab production for passive immunotherapy applications, chickens present a much more economical source of large quantities of specific Ab being also less invasive as it only requires daily collection of eggs (Mine and Kovacs-Nolan, 2002; Karlsson et al., 2004; Schade et al., 2005; Kovacs-Nolan and Mine, 2012) . It would be critical to develop an egg yolk powder enriched in IgY Abs directed to several enteropathogens involved in neonatal calf diarrhea. This will represent a polyvalent product to be used as a preventive as well as a therapeutic strategy to control calf scours in dairy farms. Being an Ab-based therapy consisting of polyclonal heterologous Abs to bovine RVA, this passive oral treatment will help to control neonatal calf diarrhea. Importantly, this approach will help overcome the problem of microbial resistance to antibiotics, which are used indiscriminately to treat calf diarrhea, offering an innovative, ecological and powerful solution to this serious calf health problem in the dairy industry.",
