The result showed that SAT05f could downregulate TLR7/9-dependent IFN-\u03b1 production in cultured human PBMC stimulated by inactivated Flu virus PR8 or HSV-1 or CpG ODN or imiquimod, protect D-GalN-treated mice from lethal shock induced by TLR9 agonist, not by TLR3/4 agonist. In addition, SAT05f significantly inhibit IFN-\u03b1 production from purified human plasmacytoid cells (pDCs) stimulated by CpG ODN. Interestingly, SAT05f could up-regulate CD80, CD86, and HLA-DR on the pDCs in vitro, implying that SAT05fmediated inhibition on IFN-\u03b1 production could be related to the activation of pDCs. The data suggest that SAT05f could be developed as a candidate medicament for the treatment of TLR7/9 activation-associated diseases by inhibiting TLR7/9 signaling pathways.",

            "text": "Viral DNA or bacterial DNA is an exogenous danger signal for immune system in mammalian. In the long time evolution of resisting virus and bacteria, the mammalian has developed pattern recognition receptors (PRR) for sensing conserved pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), such as Tolllike receptors (TLRs). TLR3, TLR7/8, and TLR9 sense viral or bacterial nucleic acids and thereafter initiate innate immune responses [1] . Viral single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) induces large amount of IFN-\u03b1 by activating TLR7/8 [2] , and bacterial double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) activates TLR9 to induce inflammatory cytokines including IFN-\u03b1, TNF-\u03b1, and IL-12 [3, 4] . Synthetic non-methylated CpG-containing oligodeoxynucleotide (CpG ODN) possesses similar activity of stimulating innate immunity as bacterial dsDNA [3] . Based on the stimulatory signals, immune system makes a decision for setting effective responses to pathogens and tolerance to selfcomponents so that it can sustain immune homeostasis. In a homeostatic condition, TLR activation leads to a protective immune response against pathogens through multiple inflammatory pathways. If an incorrect decision is made by immune system, a devastating consequence may occur to the hostshock in the short term or autoimmunity in the long term. In pathologic conditions, TLR9 can recognize self-DNA to initiate auto-innate immune responses [5] . Several reports show that TLR9 plays an important role in autoimmune disease development via activation by self-DNA [6, 7] . CpG ODN-induced TLR9 activation was also reported capable of inducing a septic death due to excessive cytokine-mediated lethal shock in Dglactosamine (D-GalN) sensitized mice, in which massively released pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-\u03b1 and IL-12 were detected in the sera of the mice [3, 8, 9] . In recent years, with the outbreak of infection by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza virus, a cytokine storm due to TLR overactivation by viral infection is considered relevant to the high mortality [10] . It is thus clear that control of innate immune overreaction could be a new approach to prevent the development of TLR activation-associated diseases.",

In recent years, DNA molecules have been found capable of inhibiting TLR activation [11] . In 2000, there was a report about DNA fragments derived from calf thymus and human placenta displayed an inhibitory role on IL-12 production of macrophage from mouse spleen and bone marrow [12] . Thereafter, an oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN) with mammal telomere-mimicking TTAGGG repeats, designated as A151, was reported to inhibit immune stimulatory activation by bacterial DNA and rescue mice from endotoxic shock by blocking LPS-induced production of IFN-\u03b3 and IL-12 [13] . A151 was also proved to have a therapeutic role in mice with severe arthritis induced by bacterial DNA, delay the onset of mouse glomerulonephritis and prolong the survival of lupusprone NZB-NZW mice [14, 15] . Another ODN with a guanosinerich sequence (G-ODN) was identified to block the production of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-12p40 by inhibiting TLR9 activation in a mouse model of D-GalN/CpG ODN-induced lethal shock [8] . Moreover, an ODN with a sequence of 5\u2032-TGCTCCTGGAGGGGTTGT-3\u2032, designated as IRS954, was revealed effective in reducing the severity of clinical symptoms in lupus-prone mice by antagonizing activation of TLR7 and TLR9 [16] . Structurally, all inhibitory ODNs introduced above are with G-rich and Gcontaining repeat sequences. However, it is still uncertain as to the key structural features for designing an efficient inhibitory ODNs, especially those that can select to suppress the activation of different TLRs.",

Human microsatellite DNA occupies about 5% of human genome and is highly repetitive elements composed of 2-6 nucleotides. An investigation indicated that genomic DNA derived from apoptotic or necrotic cells could be uptaken by macrophage and then cut into DNA fragments by DNase II, implying that abundant self-DNA fragments, a big part of them is from microsatellite DNA, have a big chance to stimulate host immune system. However, in physiological condition, these self-DNA fragments are unable to initiate anti-self-DNA immune response and immune-inhibitory possibly. To confirm the deduction, MS ODNs, ODN designed on the sequences of human microsatellite DNA, were observed for their inhibitory effect on immune responses of human PBMC to CpG ODN stimulation in vitro. It was found that MS ODN with T, TC, TTC, TTTC, TTCC, or TTTTTC repeats and also CT and CCT repeats could significantly inhibit CpG ODN-induced TLR9 activation [17] , implying that human microsatellite DNA-derived DNA fragments may negatively regulate innate immune responses and therefore sustain tolerance to self-DNA.",

The anti-VSV activities of the supernatants from TLR7 agonist-stimulated PBMC were compared with those displayed by recombinant IFN-\u03b12b. As shown in Figure 1a , the Flu virus PR8-induced supernatants of human PBMC could protect Vero E6 cells from VSV challenge. An 80-fold-diluted Flu virus PR8 was able to induce the similar antiviral activity as 256 IU/ml of IFN-\u03b12b did and used for later experiments. We then tested the inhibitory effect of SAT05f on IFN production by Flu virus PR8-induced PBMC. Human PBMCs were cultured with inactivated Flu virus PR8 in presence of SAT05f, or two positive control ODNs of A151 and IRS954, or a negative control MS ODN (MS19) fro 48 h and the supernatants were assayed for the anti-VSV activities. The result showed that SAT05f displayed significant inhibition on IFN production and its potency was similar as that displayed by A151 and much stronger than that by IRS954 and MS19 (Fig. 1b) . To find an optimal dosage of SAT05f, PBMCs were incubated with inactivated Flu virus PR8 in the presence of MS19 or SAT05f at a dose range of 1-16 \u03bcg/ml for 48 h. It was found that PBMC from different donors responded to SAT05f variously and SAT05f at 8 \u03bcg/ml consistently inhibited IFN production from PBMC of all tested blood samples (data not shown). Upon this, SAT05f at 8 \u03bcg/ml was selected as the optimal dosage in later in vitro experiments. As shown in Figure 1c , SAT05f at 8 \u03bcg/ml remarkably inhibited Flu virus PR8-induced IFN production from PBMC of seven healthy blood donors (p b 0.001), indicating that SAT05f was an antagonist of TLR7 activation. In another set of experiment, inactivated Flu virus PR8 was replaced by imiquimod (a synthetic TLR7 agonist) as a stimulator, and SAT05f at dosages of 4-16 \u03bcg/ml could also display significant inhibitory effect on PBMC to produce IFN (Fig. 1d) .

As shown in Figure 3a , SAT05f could inhibit CpG 1585 to stimulate IFN production from the splenocytes whereas MS19 could not. We then detected whether SAT05f could block TNF-\u03b1 production from mouse macrophages. A macrophage cell line RAW264.7 cells were stimulated with CpG 1826, a typical mouse B-class CpG ODN, or in the presence of SAT05f or MS19 for 8 h and the supernatants were harvested for assaying TNF-\u03b1 production by a TNF-\u03b1 cytotoxicity bioassay [18] . The result showed that SAT05f could inhibit the cytotoxicity of the supernatants from RAW264.7 cells triggered by CpG 1826 (Fig. 3b) , demonstrating that SAT05f decreased the TNF-\u03b1 production from mouse immune cells by suppressing TLR9 activation.",

            "text": "Upon the in vitro analysis, we then evaluated the in vivo effect of SAT05f in a mouse model of excessive cytokinemediated lethal shock induced by different TLR agonists. To create the model, BALB/C mice were presensitized with D-GalN for 1.5 h and then injected i.p. with imiquimod and CpG 1826, respectively. In our system, imiquimod could not induce mice to develop the lethal shock even at 250 \u03bcg per D-GalN-sensitized mouse. Accordingly, D-GalN-sensitized mice were firstly injected with CpG 1826 or in the presence of SAT05f, MS19, or chloroquine (a TLR7/9 antagonist by interfering acidification of endosomes). The survivals of the mice were recorded. As apparently shown in Figure 4a , all mice in CpG 1826 group were dead in 24 h. In contrast, 100% of mice in CpG 1826 plus SAT05f group, 40% of mice in CpG 1826 plus MS19 group, and 20% of mice in CpG 1826 plus chloroquine group were still alive in 168 h, demonstrating that SAT05f could rescue mice from excessive cytokinemediated lethal shock induced by TLR9 activation. Notably, MS19 could also partially resist CpG 1826-induced excessive cytokine-mediated lethal shock in mice whereas chloroquine was not remarkable as expected. Pathological analysis revealed that CpG 1826 was able to induce severe liver hemorrhage and necrosis in D-GalN-sensitized mice whereas SAT05f could prevent the pathological changes (Fig. 4b) , implying that SAT05f displayed an inhibitory role of innate immune response to TLR9 activation and mediated a preventive effect for CpG ODN-induced liver injury in mice. Subsequently, the dose effect of SAT05f on resisting CpG 1826-induced lethal shock was observed in D-GalN-treated mice. As apparently shown in Figure 4c , all mice in groups of CpG 1826 alone or plus 6.25 \u03bcg of SAT05f were dead in 24 h, whereas 30%, 50%, and 80% of mice in groups of CpG 1826 plus SAT05f at 12.5 \u03bcg, 25 \u03bcg, and other three doses of 50, 75, and 100 \u03bcg were still alive in 168 h. Noticeably, SAT05f at 12.5 \u03bcg failed to protect mice from lethal shock induced by 10 \u03bcg CpG 1826. The molar ratio of 12.5 \u03bcg SAT05f and 10 \u03bcg CpG 1826 is 1.2:1, approximately. SAT05f at 50 \u03bcg consistently saved all tested mice (Fig. 4c) . The molar ratio of 50 \u03bcg SAT05f and 10 \u03bcg CpG 1826 is 4.8:1, approximately. The data suggest that SAT05f could function by competing with CpG 1826. This result reveals that 50 \u03bcg of SAT05f may be an optimal dosage for rescuing mice from TLR9 activationinduced excessive cytokine-mediated lethal shock.",

Afterward, CpG 2216 was selected as stimulator for pDCs because of its activation on immune cells to produce a large amount of IFN-\u03b1. The pDCs were stimulated with CpG 2216 alone or in the presence of SAT05f, A151, or MS19 for 22 h and then analyzed on a FACS Canto for their expression of surface molecules after staining with fluorescence-labeled mAbs. The result showed that the expression of CD86, CD80, and HLA-DR on the surface of pDCs was up-regulated not only by CpG 2216 but also by SAT05f or CpG 2216 plus SAT05f. The activities of SAT05f on up-regulating the surface molecules of pDCs were similar as that of A151 but much higher than that of MS19 (Figs. 6b-d) . It was noteworthy that the lower activities of CpG 2216 on up-regulating CD80, CD86, and HLA-DR of pDCs could be due to its 1/8 dose compared other ODNs.",

Both 2088 (5\u2032-TCCTGG-CGGGGAAGT-3\u2032) and 2114 (5\u2032-TCCTGGAGGGGAAGT-3\u2032) capable of blocking CpG-induced B cell activation have 2-3 G substitutions as their central motifs [22] . The suppressive activity of A151 (5\u2032-TTAGGGTTAGGGTTAGGGTTAGGG-3\u2032) was correlated with the TTAGGG repeats for forming Gtetrads [23] . IRS 954 (5\u2032-TGCTCCTGGAGGGGTTGT-3\u2032) was a G-rich ODN confirmed to inhibit IFN production by pDCs in response to DNA or RNA viruses [24] . Moreover, replacing GCGTT or ACGTT with GCGGG or ACGGG could convert a stimulatory 15-mer ODN into an inhibitory ODN [25] . Overall, all of the reported inhibitory ODNs are G containing or poly G containing or G-rich. Our previous study demonstrated that MS ODN with repeats composed of T or C could effectively display inhibitory effects on CpG ODN-induced innate immune responses in vitro [17] . SAT05f presented in this article has no \"G base\" and is composed of CCT repeats that are abundant in microsatellite DNA in human genome. Noticeably, to our knowledge, this was the first report showing that an oligonucleotide without \"G base\" is capable of inhibiting the activation of TLR7 and/or TLR9 and protecting mice from excessive cytokine-mediated lethal shock-like syndrome. This reveals that G-rich sequences are not the only structural feature for inhibitory ODNs. Recently, it has been reported that 2\u2032 deoxyribose homopolymers with PS-modified backbone act as TLR9 and TLR7 antagonists. Addition of random DNA bases to the homopolymers does not alter their antagonist functions. The TLR9-inhibitory quality of the PS-modified ODN is overcome in the presence of a CpG motif because PS CpG ODN successfully converts the high TLR9 affinity of a PS-modified molecule into robust TLR9 activation [26] . These data supported that SAT05f should be inhibitory because it was a PS-modified ODN without CpG. However, our data challenge the view that random DNA bases do not affect the antagonist activity of PS 2\u2032 deoxyribose homopolymers. For instance, PS-modified SAT05f could inhibit IFN production from in vitro cultured PBMC and pDCs induced by TLR agonists, whereas PSmodified MS19 was found almost inert on doing those. Moreover, SAT05f, not the MS19, inhibited TNF-\u03b1 production from RAW264.7 induced by CpG 1826 and IFN production from BALB/c splenocytes triggered by CpG 1585. Interestingly, MS19 rescued mice from TLR9-dependent cytokinemediated lethal shock, although less potent than SAT05f. These results indicate that the PS-modified ODN mediated inhibition does require particular motifs and the in vitroinert PS-modified ODN might be inhibitory in vivo.",

Primarily, Flu virus PR8 (RNA virus) as a TLR7 agonist [2] and HSV-1 (DNA virus) as a TLR9 agonist [4] were used as major stimulators in in vitro experiments considering that TLR activation-associated \"cytokine storm\" was related to the high mortality during viral infection such as SARS and H5N1 avian flu [10] . We found that SAT05f could significantly inhibit human PBMC to produce type I IFN via TLR7/9 activation induced by inactivated Flu virus PR8 as well as HSV-1 and human pDCs to produce IFN-\u03b1 triggered by a TLR9 agonist, indicating that SAT05f could show a promising prospect for developing a medication for controlling TLR7/9 activation-mediated innate immune overreaction such as the cytokine storm. The speculation was supported by our in vivo data that SAT05f could rescue the D-GalN-treated mice from excessive cytokine-mediated lethal shock triggered by TLR9 agonist.",

Our in vitro experiments showed that SAT05f inhibited TNF-\u03b1 production from RAW264.7 cells, a BALB/C mouse macrophages cell line as well as from the pDCs from one blood donor. TNF-\u03b1 was reported to induce excessive hepatocyte apoptosis once the cells were sensitized by D-GalN [28] . Pathological analysis showed that SAT05f protected mice from liver injury in D-GalN-sensitized mice induced by CpG ODN, implying that SAT05f might inhibit the development of excessive cytokine-mediated lethal shock-like syndrome by suppressing TNF-\u03b1-induced liver injury triggered by TLR9 activation [27, 28] . In addition, TLR7 might also be involved in the development of excessive cytokine-mediated lethal shock-like syndrome. Stimulation of TLR7 by H5N1 vaccine was found as the prime determinant of the greater magnitude of the vaccine-induced immune response [29] . In human cases infected with influenza A (H5N1) virus, excessive cytokine-mediated lethal shock-like syndrome characterized by higher plasma levels of cytokines has been observed in the patients, particularly in patients with fatal infection [30] . Considering that the possible involvement of TLR7 in influenza A (H5N1) virus induced hypercytokinemia and the data that SAT05f inhibited cytokine production induced by Flu virus PR8, a TLR7 agonist, we might speculate that SAT05f could inhibit the development of excessive cytokine-mediated lethal shock in influenza A (H5N1) virus-infected patients.",

The data showed in this article demonstrated that SAT05f could significantly inhibit IFN production from PBMC stimulated with CpG ODN, HSV-1, imiquimod, and Flu virus PR8 and from purified human pDC stimulated with CpG ODN, indicating that SAT05f might be used as a TLR7/9 antagonist that down-regulates TLR9 or TLR7 activationassociated diseases accompanying high-level production of IFN. In recent years, TLR9/TLR7 pathways have been implicated in contributing to the development of inflammation-associated diseases and autoimmune diseases. A report showed that if TLR9-knocked out (TLR9 \u2212/\u2212 ) mice were used as graft recipients during allogeneic bone marrow thransplantation, survivals and clinical scores of acute graft-vshost disease (GVHD) were efficiently improved when compared with that in wild-type mice, suggesting that TLR9 activation contributed to the GVHD [32] . In a TLR9dependent manner, immune complexes (ICs) consisting of autoantibodies specific to self-DNA and RNA induced pDCs to produce high level of IFN-\u03b1 [7, 33, 34] that promoted the progress of systemic lupus erythematosus. Abnormal production of IFN-\u03b1 from pDCs through TLR9 activation was involved in the development of psoriasis, Sj\u00f6gren syndrome, type I diabetes, Hashimoto disease, and dermatomyositis The binding and uptake of SAT05f in CAL-1 cell. CAL-1 cells were cultured in medium with or without SAT05f-Cy3 either at 4\u00b0C for 10 min or at 37\u00b0C for 60 min followed by washing three times and then analyzed by a FACScan. The result was expressed as mean fluorescence intensity (MFI). Representative data from one of three experiments are shown. [35] . It was demonstrated that chronic triggering of TLR7 in mice using HIV-1-derived TLR7 ligands leads to immune activation and disruption of lymphoid architecture similar to those observed in chronic HIV-1 infection in humans [36] . Taken together, these findings also prompted us to develop SAT05f as a medicament for the treatment of TLR9/TLR7 activation-associated diseases by blocking the TLR7/9 signaling.",
