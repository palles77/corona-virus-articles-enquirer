            "text": "Proteases represent a large and diverse group of hydrolytic enzymes that are classified by their site of action, enzyme active site structure, and specific reaction mechanisms. Proteases are ubiquitous in biology where they have a biochemical and/or physio logical involvement in many aspects of cell and organism function, including nutrition, protein turnover, growth, adaptation, regulation, sporulation and germination, disease, and death. Proteases regulate much of what occurs in the human body including the essential cellular functions of differentiation, motility, division, and cell death. Proteases participate physiologically in intracellular protein-degradation processes using several systems, including lysosomes (membrane-bound organelles containing proteases) and the more recently characterized proteasome system, consisting of very large protein barrel-like stacked four-ringed complexes, the outer rings of which function as gates to proteins entering the central pore, while the interior surfaces of the inner Food Ingredients rings contain the proteolytic active sites [9] . Proteasome proteolytic mechanisms involve an active site threonine, and involve three different chymotrypsin-like, trypsin-like, and peptidyl-glutamyl peptide-hydrolyzing substrate specificities. Proteolysis is exploited physiologically for covalent activation, regulation, and inhibition of enzymes and other protein-based or linked effectors, for example, in the biochemical cascade leading to blood clotting and in production of insulin. Proteases remove signal sequences of peptides following their transport/secretion through membranes and they remove N-terminal methionine residues after translation.",

            "text": "Animal, plant, and, especially, microbial proteases represent the largest and most important segment of an industrial enzyme market where they are used in detergents, in food processing, in the leather industry, as biocatalysts in organic synthesis, and as therapeutics. Because proteases also function as causative agents of some diseases, protease inhibitors have also been developed as a class of therapeutics. Commercial fermentation processes for production of microbial proteases were developed from about the 1950s. Some of the workhorse protease-producing strains, including Aspergillus, Rhizopus, and Bacillus species, were the same species as were found in traditional fermented food fermentations where their proteases participated in the degradation of proteins and associated development of distinct flavors in solid mash substrates containing soy beans, cereal grains, and other plant-based food materials. The protease production fermentation processes and conditions were optimized through characterization and control of factors affecting microbial growth and enzyme production. Overproducing strains were isolated through extensive screening processes and were further improved through application of elaborate mutation/selection procedures. Developments in genetic engineering, including the ability to express recombinant proteins in different host organisms and the ability to manipulate and enhance transcription, translation, secretion, and other processes, have been exploited to enhance protease production and under lining the technoeconomics of their use. The ability to engineer proteins to modify properties, such as kinetics, specificity, and stability, has been applied to improve or expand on protease applications. Random and site-directed mutagenesis and other techniques have been particularly useful in designing, constructing, and characterizing the biocatalytic and stability properties of wholly new protease structures.",

Companies reported to have the largest share of the enzyme market are Novozymes Enzyme Group produces a more specialized range of enzymes with major applications in biotransformations, diagnostics, and as dietary supplements (http://www.amano-enzyme.co.jp/aeu/product/presentation.html). The indicated internet sites and others provide valuable information on the principal applications of proteases as well as on new research, technology, and links to technical reports and publications. Other companies mainly based in Asia, Europe, and North America account for the residual approximately 27-30%. Proteases are thought to account for about 60% of the total enzyme market or $1.5-1.8 billion per year. Among protease applications, the most dominant use is in the detergents accounting for sales of alkaline protease of approximately $1 billion per year.",

It should be noted that there is some overlap in the data since patents applied for and granted since 2001 will be counted under both headers. 'Protease' was used as the initial 'term' in the search, which was separately applied to the fields 'abstract' and 'claims'. In a second search, the search term 'protease inhibitor' was used. The presumption is that the difference between these two numbers, that is, proteases but not 'protease inhibitors' provides a good indication of numbers of granted patents and applications involving proteases. In the past 10 years, nearly 6000 patents have been filed with claims dealing with protease.",

For a more detailed discussion of reaction mechanisms the reader is also referred to Rao et al. [12] , Ward et al. [20] , and Fujinami and Fujisawa [3] . The principal enzyme types are exoproteases, which act at or near the ends of the peptide chains, delineated as aminopeptidases and carboxypeptidases to indicate their action is at the N-or C-terminals of the peptide substrates. These enzymes may be further differentiated depending on the size of the moiety that is cleaved off, be it, for example, an amino acid, a dipeptide, or a tripeptide. Industrial organisms known to produce aminopeptidases include Aspergillus oryzae, Bacillus licheniformis, B. stearothermophilus, and Escherichia coli. Carboxypeptidases, which are produced by species such as Aspergillus, Penicillium, and Saccharomyces species, are differentiated further into three groups based on the presence of certain amino acid substituents at their active sites, namely the serine carboxyproteases, the metallocarboxyproteases, and the cysteine carboxyproteases. Endoproteases, which attack internal peptide bonds in the peptide chain remote from the C-or N-terminal, are further differentiated into the following subgroups based on their specific mechanism of action:",

Many serine proteases have high pH optima in the range 7-12, with those in the pH range 9-10 being known as serine alkaline proteases or the first generation of detergent proteases and those with pH optima of 11-12 being known as the high alkaline proteases, the second generation of detergent proteases. The subtilisins are an important family of serine proteases produced by Bacillus species. These enzymes were also the starting material for development of a third generation of detergent enzymes, resistant to oxidation by bleach and related detergent oxidants, which involved substitution of an oxidation-sensitive amino acid near the enzyme's active site with an oxidation-resistant amino acid.

In Denmark, Christian Hansen started commercial production of chymosin by extracting calf stomach with saline. Similar approaches were used to produce bovine pepsin. Typically, the enzyme-containing tissues are preserved at the slaughterhouse by salting, freezing, or drying. Salted stomachs may be washed and dried prior to rennet extraction. The dried calf stomach may be sliced, blended or ground, and extracted with water containing 5-10% NaCl to produce what is known as single-strength rennet.

These methods were used up to the mid-1950s in the United States and are still applied in Japan. Following the development of the penicillin-submerged culture fermentation at the US Northern Regional Research Laboratories, submerged fermentations, including the production of proteases, were developed for enzyme production, initially in the United States and Europe, initially for applications in food and beverage processing. These deep-stirred and aerated production fermentors typically have working volumes of 50-200 m 3 and are designed to withstand 'autoclaving' conditions, namely >15 psi and >121 \u00b0C for sterilization. It is worth mentioning in passing that it is well established that the overall mix of enzymes produced in solid substrate fermentations tends to be more complex than the corresponding enzyme profile produced by the same strain in submerged culture, likely reflecting the more complex nature of the substrate components used in solid substrate fermentations. Interestingly, when chymosin yields produced by a recombinant Aspergillus strain in solid substrate and submerged cultures were compared, much higher yields were observed in the solid-state culture.",

The generally accepted amount of alpha-amino nitrogen requirement for yeast growth in a normal fermentation is 140-180 mg l \u22121 . In an all malt mash, the malt proteases typically produce the requisite amount of amino nitrogen from the principal proteins of barley, hordein and glutelin, both during the malting process and during mashing. As the proportion of malt is decreased or eliminated through use of unmalted cereals there is a requirement to replace the malt protease with industrial proteases, especially neutral proteases from Bacillus and also from Aspergillus species. Bacillus alkaline protease is not effective for this application. These enzymes may also be used for production of cereal extract concentrates, where filterable extract yield is the priority rather than amino nitrogen and, in this case, papain may also be used to promote proteolysis. It should also be noted that the temperature-time holds during mashing are designed to meet the activity requirements of the mashing enzymes including protease, amylases, and glucanases. In mashing with malt enzymes, the lowest temperature hold is around 50 \u00b0C, called the 'proteolytic' stand as malt proteases have temperature optima around this setting and quickly get denatured as the temperature is increased. Some of the microbial proteases and papain have higher temperature optima at 55-65 \u00b0C, enabling the mashing process to be implemented at high temperatures that are more optimal for starch gelatinization and hydrolysis of starch and betaglucans.",

There are now three types of commercial milk-coagulating enzymes: animal rennets, microbial rennets, and genetically engineered calf rennet (chymosin), the latter two being developed due to a world shortage of calf rennet as a result of the substantial increases over the years in cheese production. The uniqueness of rennet as a protease is its extremely high substrate specificity, in that it hydrolyzes a single-specific peptide bond (Phe105-Met106) in the k-casein fraction of milk, to produce para-k-casein and a macropeptide, without attacking other caseins. As k-casein serves to maintain the milk micelles in suspension, whereas neither the para-k-casein nor a macropeptide serves this function, cleavage of this bond by rennet results in destabilization of the milk micelles and cheese coagulation.",

Thus, a unique property of rennet is its very high ratio of milk clotting to general proteolytic activity and the challenge in searching for microbial rennets was to find enzymes that approached this characteristic activity ratio.

As occurs in other industries, there is a strong move away from use of harsh chemicals in processing because of the associated safety risks to workers handling these materials. Also, these methods add significant high costs to effluent treatment and waste disposal and increase risks of spills and pollution. Therefore, more environmentally friendly approaches are desirable and proteases can fill this niche.

More recently, hydrolytic enzymes have been applied for catalysis of reactions involving water as reactant or product, whereby the water concentration in the reaction medium is partially or wholly replaced by another solvent, thereby shifting the reaction equilibrium in favor of synthesis. As water molecules may also participate in maintaining the requisite conformational structure of proteins for biocatalysis, much research has been directed to understanding the impact of water, and indeed water concentration on enzyme activity and stability and the associated impact of implementing enzyme reactions in nonconventional organic media or biphasic aqueous-organic systems. In addition, enzymes have been identified or engineered to be more stable in organic solvents. For example, a microbial protease from Thermus strain Rt4A2 is very stable in organic solvents. Subtilisin has been rendered more stable in organic solvents by covalent modification of the enzyme using selected polymers or by application of covalent or noncovalent methods to bind the enzyme to supports. The research of Chen and Arnold (reviewed by Kuchner and Arnold [5] ) applied the tools and concepts of directed evolution to developing subtilisin proteases that were active in the presence of organic solvents and, hence, applicable to using proteases catalyze synthesis of peptides and related bonds. Protease PST-01 from Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which exhibits a high level of homology to thermolysin, also contains a disulfide bond (one of two), which contributes substantially to its solvent stability. Another approach to replacing water in the reaction medium is to use supercritical fluids as the reaction solvent.

Microbial collagenases, involving a host of clinical organisms, have been implicated in certain mycetomas, abscesses, ulcers, septicemia, emphysemia, ectyma gangrenosum, pregnancy complications, periodontal diseases, dental caries, and necrotizing diseases. Therefore, it is clear that inhibitors to collagenases have enormous potential in disease therapy. This is further discussed in Harrington [4].Proteases from blood-feeding invertebrates, for example, the medical leech, Hirudo medicinalis, produce serine protease peptide inhibitors that interact with trypsin-like proteases to block blood coagulation in their hosts [21] .Proteasome inhibitors have been developed as chemotherapeutic agents with antitumor activity though induction of apoptosis [1] . Bortezomib is effective in the treatment of multiple myeloma, where increased levels of proteosomes are observed in blood serum. Other potential applications of bortezomid are in treatment of B-cell and pancreatic cancers. The HIV protease inhibitor therapeutic, ritonavir, also inhibits the trypsin-like activity of proteosomes and may have inhibitory activity against glioma cells. Proteasome inhibitors are also potential therapeutics for autoimmune diseases.Although thrombolytic activity of the serine protease, t-PA, appears beneficial for acute stroke treatment, t-PA also may determine the extent of neuronal damage after injury of the central nervous system. Serine proteases are present in neurons and glial cells together with endogenous serine protein inhibitors that play a neuroprotective role [16] . Clearly, modulating the proper balancing of the interactions of the proteases and their inhibitors will be important in strategic treatment of brain injury and in using t-PA as a therapeutic agent.Protease inhibitors have been developed against proteases that viruses use to cleave nascent proteins for assembly of new virions, for example, in treatment or prevention of viral infection by HIV or hepatitis C viruses. Protease inhibitors developed against HIV, sequinavir, ritonavir, and lipinavir have also exhibited antiprotozoal activity, for example, against malaria and Giardia infection (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proteasome).Neutral endopeptidase (NEP) inhibitor, omapatrilat, acts to inhibit metalloproteases including the angiotensin-converting enzyme in treatment of hypertension and in clinical management of congestive heart failure. Omapatrilat also beneficially inhibits NEP that degrades atrial natriuretic peptide, secreted by the heart.Resistance may develop to protease inhibitor treatment of viral diseases, especially when the inhibitor drug is used at suboptimal concentrations/dose rates. This is perceived as a serious problem, for example, in HIV treatment, where at least 10% of the amino acids of the HIV protease may be substituted through mutation while still retaining a viable virus [8] (http://www.aids.org).References to some of the most cited papers on classification of protease inhibitors are summarized in the BioinfoBank Library (http://lib.bioinfo.pI/meid:190879).",
