This shift in the way that healthcare is delivered raises new concerns over community healthcare-associated infections (HCAIs). A literature search between 2000 and December 2013 was conducted in databases including PubMed, SciVerse ScienceDirect and Google Scholar. National and international guideline and policy documents were searched using Google. Many terms were used in the literature searches, including 'nosocomial', 'healthcare infection', 'community' and 'nursing home'. The rates of HCAI in community healthcare are similar to the rates found in the acute hospital setting, but the types of infection differ, with a greater focus on urinary tract infections (UTIs) in the community and ventilator-associated pneumonias in the hospital setting. Patients who acquire a community HCAI are more likely to exhibit reduced physical condition, have increased levels of morbidity and have higher mortality rates than individuals without infection. Infection control programmes have been developed worldwide to reduce the rates of hospital HCAIs. Such interventions are equally as valid in the community, but how best to implement them and their subsequent impact are much less well understood. The future is clear: HCAIs in the community are going to become an ever-increasing burden and it is critical that our approach to these infections is brought quickly in line with present hospital sector standards.",

The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) published the results of its first EU community-wide point prevalence study of HCAIs in 2013 [2] . 15 ,000 HCAIs were reported during the period of the survey. Respiratory tract infections were the most common, followed by surgical site infections (19.6 %) and urinary tract infections (UTIs; 19.0 %) [2] . The results of the ECDC annual epidemiological report of 2013 showed that a diverse range of bacteria and fungi were responsible for HCAIs and that an increasing proportion of these organisms were resistant to standard antibiotic treatment [3] .",

            "text": "The literature on health outcomes related specifically to HCAIs in community care facilities is much less complete than the data within the acute hospital setting. Where data are available, community HCAIs have been shown to negatively impact on health outcomes: for example, during a 30-day evaluation of nursing home residents in Norway, those who had an HCAI were 2.3 times more likely to have shown a reduction in physical condition (95 % CI 1.5-3.4) when compared to residents free from such infections (the prevalence of HCAIs was 5.2/1,000 resident days) [24] . When different types of infection were taken into consideration, those with the highest effect on physical condition were lower respiratory tract infection (RR=3.3; 95 % CI 1.9-5.5) and UTI (RR=2.5; 95 % CI 1.5-4.1). There was also an increase in the number of hospital admissions amongst residents who had experienced an HCAI, with a risk ratio of 9.2 % (95 % CI 5.0-17.1). The highest risk was for residents with a lower respiratory tract infection (RR=15.0; 95 % CI 7.8-28.9) followed by UTI (RR=7.9; 95 % CI 4.0-15.6). Overall, 16.1 % of residents who experienced an HCAI during the study period died compared to 2.4 % in the unaffected group [24] . A prospective surveillance study undertaken in a nursing home in Bonn (Germany) provided further evidence that some types of HCAIs have more severe outcomes than others. During a 12-month surveillance period, 208 HCAIs were recorded for the 125 residents of a nursing home. Respiratory tract infections were the most common (2.16/1,000 resident days) and were also associated with a higher death rate. A total of 30 (24.0 %) residents died in the study, where 13 (43.3 %) of these cases involved an infection as either a direct cause of death or a major contributing factor. Residents with pneumonia were found to be more likely to die than residents with other HCAIs (RR=5.09; 95 % CI 1.87-13.89; p=0.011) [20] . While evidence suggests that community HCAIs result in increased morbidity and mortality, it is unclear whether those admitted to hospital from residential care facilities are more likely to respond poorly to treatment or show less positive outcomes than those admitted to hospital from their own homes. One study [30] , undertaken on 10,593 admissions to a geriatric medical care unit, showed that patients from a residential setting stayed, on average, no longer in hospital than those admitted from their own home [16 \u00b1 2 days (residential), 17\u00b12 days (own home)]. The mean survival time was 61 days (95 % CI 37-84) for patients from a residential setting compared to 48 days (95 % CI 25-72) for those patients admitted from home. When the different types of residential homes were analysed, significant differences in survival times were found. In particular, those patients who had come from private nursing homes had a lower mean survival time compared to those admitted from their own home [24 days, 95 % CI 19-29 (private nursing home), 48 days, 95 % CI 25-72 (own home)]. Once more, the most common site of infection was the respiratory tract, and while the range of pathogens responsible for infection did not differ between groups, no information was provided on antibiotic resistance profiles.",

A study undertaken in 32 German care homes found that, of the 139 residents (7.6 %) who were meticillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA)-positive, all were colonised with strains recognised as circulating within hospitals. No evidence for the presence of communityacquired or livestock-associated S. aureus strains was found [31] . Similarly, the prevalence and source of S. aureus infections at a university hospital in Israel were investigated from 1988 to 2007. During the study period, 1,347 clinically significant episodes of S. aureus bacteraemia were recorded. Six percent (n = 86) were deemed as community-acquired and all were caused by meticillin-sensitive S. aureus (MSSA). All of the remaining 1,261 infections were associated with healthcare; 58.3 % (n=735) were hospital acquired and 41.7 % (n= 526) were acquired in the community healthcare setting. The main risk factor for community healthcare acquisition was stay in hospital in the previous 90 days [32] . It is most probable that there was a close association between the pathogens circulating within the hospital setting and the community healthcare settings, with just a small contribution from the general community. However, this situation may be changing, as hospital-associated strains of MRSA have begun to appear with greater frequency in the community [33] . This mixing of strains between sources (Fig. 1 ) may result in different levels of infective risk, based not only on the source of the pathogen, but also on the particular circumstance and underlying condition of the individual. The most important pools of pathogens are the hospitals and community healthcare facilities, and research suggests that pathogens flow back and forth between these [34] . Effectively, as traditional pathogens that cause HCAIs mix between the two environments, in doing so, they will establish endemic status within communities and cause community HCAIs there. Much more rarely, new strains may also come into hospital from the community via zoonosis, as has happened recently with MRSA strain 398 [35] and H 7 influenza virus/coronavirus [36, 37] .",

In Orange County (USA), evidence for the transfer between different sites has been reported. A multicentre regional assessment was undertaken in the period 2009-2011. A total of 3,806 nasal swabs from the residents of 26 nursing homes were analysed, of which 837 (22 %) were positive for MRSA. Eighty-three percent of all MRSA isolates belonged to two clonal groups that commonly circulated in local hospitals (USA100 and USA300), which could have been because a high proportion of residents were admitted directly from hospital [38] . A recently published modelling study showed that the addition of MRSA cases within nursing homes into the simulations potentiated the impact of hospital outbreaks, even when the nursing home was not directly linked to the hospital [39] . A comprehensive study of the phylogeny of MRSA [40] has provided a valuable insight into the spread of MRSA through the human population. The genetic relatedness of seven publicly available complete or draft MRSA sequences and 80 additionally sequenced MRSA strains representative of the diversity with the clonal complex 30 (cc30) of MRSA were investigated. The cc30 group was chosen because member strains have been responsible for three separate pandemics over the past 60 years and were additionally responsible for the toxic shock syndrome pandemic of the 1970s and 1980s [41, 42] . The cc30 lineage of MRSA is divided into three distinct clades of a common ancestry: phage type 80/81, Southwest Pacific (SWP) and EMRSA-16 (EMRSA-16 strains predominate in UK hospitals). London and Glasgow were found to be the origin for the spread of EMRSA-16 to surrounding smaller hospitals. Glasgow hospitals were the most probable origin of EMRSA-16 strains isolated from the surrounding population centres in the North and East of Scotland [40] .",

A study undertaken at four community nursing homes in Buffalo (USA) found that two-thirds of CDI cases were in patients showing symptoms of CDI within 30 days of admission from hospital [46] . Hospital patients with CDI may also be more likely to go straight to long-term care than those without CDI [48] , further increasing the likelihood of transmission between healthcare facilities. Mixing between the community and healthcare facilities also occurs [47] [48] [49] . Another study in The Netherlands focused on the epidemiology of the hypervirulent C. difficile ribotype 027 in 50 healthcare facilities from 2005 to 2006. This ribotype was equally distributed amongst those patients with community-onset CDI and healthcare-associated CDI [47] , suggesting that the transfer of C. difficile strains between the community and healthcare populations is common.",

While the methods of microbial identification differed between these studies (culture versus culture and molecular methods) and, therefore, care should be taken when comparing these data, the differences in reported prevalence may have been due to dissimilarities in antibiotic use.

Out of 288 patients, 20.1 % (n= 58/288) were colonised with multi drug-resistant bacteria (determined by culture and molecular methods). In addition, 6.2 % (n=4/64) of staff were also colonised. Among the patients, 3.8 % (n=11/288) were colonised with vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) and 8.7 % (n=25/288) were found to be colonised with ESBLproducers. Twenty-seven (9.4 %) were colonised with MRSA. The most significant risk factors for the carriage of such drugresistant bacteria were the presence of a urinary catheter (OR= 3.1; 95 % CI 1.7-5.9; p<0.001), prior hospitalisation (OR= 2.1; 95 % CI 1.1-4.0; p=0.033) and the presence of a wound or pressure ulcer (OR=2.3; 95 % CI 1.5-4.9; p=0.03) [50] . The fact that prior hospitalisation was found to be a significant risk factor for the carriage of multi drug-resistant bacteria suggests that transfer between healthcare facilities may occur (as with MRSA and C. difficile). Oteo et al. undertook a prospective surveillance study in Madrid (Spain) during the period 2004-2005. A total of 525 ESBL-producers (E. coli strains) were collected, of which 151 were resistant to cefotaxime and ceftazidime. Molecular analysis of these strains showed that four dominant clusters were distributed through the hospitals, long-term care facilities and the community [53] . A similar study undertaken in Dublin (Republic of Ireland) during 2009-2010 aimed to assess the spread of E. coli ESBL-producers through the healthcare system. The authors reported that common E. coli ESBL clones were found to be distributed between the hospital and several local community healthcare facilities, providing evidence of a 'revolving door' situation where strains were being recycled between facilities [54] .",

The changing nature of the environments experienced by community practitioners (care home, nursing home and individual homes) dictates that there is no easy mapping across to the hospital setting. In the UK, the community care sector is populated by different providers (state, private company and a combination of both), which carry differing challenges on how best to implement and monitor progress. In the hospital sector, there are wellunderstood mechanisms for infection control practitioners to train, monitor and improve infection control care. In contrast, the diversity of workforces, where staff often show high turnover rates, in the community setting are usually supported by much less resource in terms of infection control training and supervision. This variety of providers is then subject to a mixture of regulatory mechanisms, where inspectors are frequently not infection control specialists. The monitoring and reporting of HCAI prevalence in community care is, thus, more difficult than in the hospital sector. In some recent audits, the prevalence of HCAIs in care homes has differed based on criteria [18] and it is often not possible to define the best approach to determining prevalence rates. A focus on device interventions is both appropriate and required because these pose a recognised, but manageable, risk for infection [16, 56] . Additionally, the guidelines rightly highlight the importance of regular review of the requirement for urinary cauterisation [8] because the longer the indwelling device is present, the greater the risk of infection.",

The study was undertaken by 23 specialists, who reviewed the literature and initially made 301 recommendations, which were then assessed by 81 experts from different medical specialties. The outcome of this work was a final list of 240 items where there was consensus amongst the expert group regarding their importance in infection control. The recommendations were categorised into four areas as follows: standard precautions (hand-washing for example); general non-specific measures for preventing HCAIs (immunisation etc.); measures specific to the prevention of HCAIs (such as policies on catheterisation); and organisational principles. The researchers highlighted the difficulties they had experienced in locating sufficient literature to inform their work [57] . While this work produced a valuable contribution to understanding HCAI interventions for the community, it did not address the fundamental issues about implementation, compliance and performance reporting that are essential to success. Nor was there any health economic assessment to guide and embed the output in the real world. The mere fact that the final list was for 240 issues is, in itself, a potentially demotivating factor by generating a sense of an overwhelming, unobtainable solution and clear prioritisation amongst these would have been helpful to target focus.",

The study involved over 70 institutions. The overall prevalence of HCAIs was 6.5 %. Post-operative patients had the highest rate of infection. The authors postulated that these infections would have resulted in additional nursing support, bed care and antibiotic treatment.

The majority of these reductions were achieved in the hospital environment. Now, communityacquired S. aureus bacteraemia, particularly infections caused by meticillin-sensitive isolates, have risen in prominence, such that the infection control and prevention focus is shifting to these community-based infections. Whether similar reductions in these infections, as happened in MRSA hospital bacteraemias, will be achieved remains to be seen and will be determined by whether effective interventions, which may be different from those deployed in the hospital, can be constructed and introduced.",

This needs to be rectified as a prerequisite to further progress in community HCAIs. Whereas the prevalence of HCAIs in community healthcare is reported to be similar to that found in the acute hospitals, this must not obscure the appreciation that there are important differences in their composition. In turn, this must necessarily lead to the construction of targeted and focused interventions applicable to the specific needs of infection control and prevention in the community.",
