However, the exact C-terminal cleavage sites have yet to be determined. The function of PRRSV nsp2 in the virus life cycle is currently not known, while Equine arteritis virus (EAV) nsp2 has been shown to be involved in the generation of double-membrane vesicles together with nsp3 and to serve as a cofactor for the nsp4 protein (10). Studies have identified the presence of a 51-nt deletion in the nsp2 gene of NA Type 1 viruses, which is located between nt 2 199 and 2 250 in ORF1a of the Lelystad virus genome (6, 7). Eighteen of the 20 NA-type 1 viruses possess the same 51-nt deletion (6). Nucleotide and putative amino acid sequence analysis have revealed that Nsp2 is the most variable region of PRRSV (11, 12). Genetic variability, including point mutations and the insertion or deletion of nucleotides, has been demonstrated in the Nsp2 gene, not only between North American and European genotypes, but also among viruses within the same genotype (6). However, the biological and clinical significance of Nsp2 diversity remains to be elucidated. The aims of this study were: and the evolution of PRRSV in China, (iii) Determine the phylogenetic relationship between the Ningxia strains and those from other regions of China. MATERIALS AND METHODS Virus strain and the primers The seventeen field clinical samples from pigs with reproductive failure (comprising three pigs from Zhongwei (ZHW), Heying (HY), Shizuishan (SZSH), Wuzhong (WZH) and Yingchuan (YCH) counties respectively, and two pigs from Dabao Country (DB)) in the Ningxia region of China in 2007, and reference strain of PRRSV CH-1a (GenBank access number: AY032626) used in this study were obtained from virology department of Lanzhou Veterinary Research Institute, Gansu of P.R.

RESULT PCR product analyses Partial Ningxia PRRSV field isolates were used for RT-PCR analysis, and the various patterns obtained are shown in Fig. 1. The isolated PRRSV nsp2 product length wasabout 630bp, consistent with the expected length. The length of the Classical strain (ch-1a) PCR products was about 710bp.

            "text": "DISCUSSION PRRSV has been recognized as one of the most important pathogens of pigs throughout the world and the virus has become widespread in China since it was first confirmed in 1996. Even though several PRRSV vaccines are available, control of the disease remain difficult (14). In this study, 8 pig farms in the Ningxia were diagnosed with PRRSV infection on the basis of clinical signs and RT-PCR. Seventeen field isolates of PRRSV obtained from 8 farms with severe disease were identified as North American type PRRSV on the basis of sequence analysis (in press). To our knowledge, this is the first report of the emergence of North American type PRRSV strain in herds of pigs in the Ningxia Hui National Autonomous Region of China. Fig 2.

            "text": "Homology analysis amongst PRRSV isolates. The ORF1a gene of PRRSV encodes a single polyprotein, predicted to be cleaved at eight sites to form nine Nsps (15). Nsp2 contains conserved catalytic cysteine and histidine residues at the amino terminus and is predicted to encode a cysteine protease (16). Amino acid deletions in Nsp2 have been identified in several PRRSV isolates (3). The areas in Nsp2 with deletions and amino acid hypervariability are predicted to be immunologically important (1); Nsp2 might function as an immunodominant protein under selective pressure by the host immune system (17, 18). In our study, we find that the nsp2 genes of seventeen isolates have an 87 nucleotides deletion 3036, respectively, relative to strain ch-1a. This deletion site is same as the SD (3) and SD2006 strains. Sequence analysis indicates that homology between the Ningxia and ch-1a strain was 60.3%-79.9% in nucleotide sequence, and homology between the Ningxia and SD strains was 80.3%-98.8% in nucleotide sequence. The nsp2 genes of seventeen isolates had 74.9%-100% nucleotide sequence identities with each other. It was also indicated that Ningxia PRRSV may originated from a popular strain in 2007, but the association between pathogenicity and variation of Nsp2 in Ningxia and the other popular strain should be studied further. All of those results demonstrated that PRRSV variation strain exists in Ningxia. Detailed analysis of these virus strains can provide data for understanding the epidemiology of PRRSV, and at the same time provide information for preservation and manipulation of the disease. Finally identification of the characteristics of the Ningxia Hui Nsp2 sequences may offer important insight into the properties of PRRSV in this region. 3.
