We demonstrate that this probability of 'evolutionary emergence' depends on two key properties of the disease life history: (i) the basic reproduction number and (ii) the expected duration of an infection. These parameters encapsulate all of the relevant information and can be combined in a very simple expression, with estimates for the rates of adaptive mutation, to predict the probability of emergence for any novel pathogen. In general, diseases that initially have a large reproductive number and/or that cause relatively long infections are the most prone to evolutionary adaptation.",

In some instances, ecological changes are sufficient to yield the entry and maintenance of a novel pathogen in the human population (sedentary lifestyles, animal domestication, urbanization; Schrag & Wiener 1995) . In other instances, however, the zoonotic pathogen causes only sporadic cases upon each introduction but is unable to sustain itself in humans without repeated introductions. The most familiar examples involve the various strains of avian influenza that have caused small clusters of infections in humans (Webster et al. 1992; Earn et al. 2002) . Such pathogens nevertheless remain a serious public health threat because, at some point, they might acquire specific adaptations that allow them to spread from human to human more effectively. For instance, SARS coronavirus has most likely been unsuccessfully introduced several times in humans, before provoking a significant epidemic (Peiris et al. 2004) . The eventual epidemic then became possible, presumably because of the adaptation of viruses to humans (The Chinese SARS Molecular Epidemiology Consortium 2004).",

For example, suppose there are two different novel pathogens that might accidentally be introduced into the human population. One of these is not transmitted in the beginning of infection but only after a certain amount of time (e.g. SARS viruses are weakly transmitted in the first five days of infection), whereas the other has its transmission spread more evenly all along the infection, but provokes shorter infections. Which of these pathogens is more prone to evolving adaptations that will allow it to persist in the human population? It is this type of question that our analysis will answer, in terms of very general disease life-history parameters.",

By definition, if the pathogen is originally unable to persist in humans, then its reproductive number is less than one. An interesting recent paper by Antia et al. (2003) demonstrates that this reproductive number also contains important information about the risk of pathogen adaptation as well. In particular, they show that novel pathogens with reproductive numbers closer to one (in the human population) pose a greater risk of adaptation because they can remain within the population for substantially longer periods of time after each occasional entrance, and this will, therefore, increase the probability that adaptation occurs before extinction.",

(2003) should prove to be extremely useful for identifying potentially threatening pathogens, but they also lead one to ask if there might be other important attributes of disease life histories that affect the likelihood of adaptation. In the models developed below we demonstrate that there are, in fact, other crucial disease life-history parameters. This is done by first examining two relatively simple but specific models. From there we then derive some very general results that encompass arbitrary pathogen life histories, and we show that the crucial disease life-history attributes affecting the likelihood of adaptation can be summarized with two intuitive quantities: (i) the reproductive number of the disease and (ii) the expected duration of an infection. Diseases with large reproductive numbers and/ or long infections are the most prone to adaptation in novel hosts and both of these factors can have substantial effects. In terms of their relative effects, our results also suggest that the expected duration of an infection is often likely to be a more important determinant of the probability of evolutionary emergence than is the reproductive number of the disease. In these circumstances, introduced diseases that cause few but long infections in humans are more apt to evolve adaptation than those that cause many short infections.",

The expected length of an infection by the introduced strain is, therefore, LZ1/d, and the pathogen's reproductive number (i.e. the expected number of new infections caused by a single infected individual) is R 0 Zb/d. Immediately following an introduction, the pathogen is assumed to be maladapted to humans and thus its rate of production of new infections is lower than the rate at which infections end (i.e. b!d ).

Mutations are generated at low frequency within infections, owing to errors in the replication of the pathogen. But the benefit of an adaptive mutation is to improve the infections' R 0 , and hence it can be expressed only if that mutation reaches a large frequency within an infection. This within-host fixation might occur through two distinct mechanisms (figure 1c). First, the adaptive mutation might fix by chance within a secondary infection owing to a transmission bottleneck. Second, the mutation might be favoured in local competition between individual pathogens within a host, and hence directly reach a large frequency within the infection where it first appeared. Indeed, for pathogens that are recently introduced into a new host, it is likely that at least a fraction of beneficial mutations that might occur will represent basic adaptations (e.g. better resistance to immunity, improved affinity for host tissues), and therefore will be beneficial both to microbes in local competition within a host and to the entire infection.",

These are then noted as offspring in the next generation and the procedure is repeated for each infection that is generated. The total number of reproduction events in the chain of transmission of the introduced pathogen, B, can be obtained graphically from (a), by considering one introduction event and counting the overall number of horizontal links in the arborescence generated. It can also be obtained from (b) by counting the number of links between two infections.

In general, pathogens are less likely to adapt, and thus emerge, if they initially have a reproductive number that is far below the epidemic threshold (R 0 /1). From an epidemiological standpoint this occurs because the reproductive number of the pathogen (R 0 ) determines the expected number of times that it is transmitted from one host to another prior to going extinct. Each transmission event represents an opportunity for an adaptive mutation to reach fixation, and hence adaptation is more likely when R 0 is close to one. The occurrence of mutations at the moment of transmission is analogous to mutations occurring during the reproduction of non-microbial invaders (e.g. invasive plant species), where adaptive mutations actually occur at the moment of reproduction. In the case of pathogens, however, the situation is more subtle. Adaptive mutations are initially generated randomly among individual microbes within infections, which would be equivalent to the generation of mutations among gametes in an invasive animal or plant. These random modifications can then reach fixation within a host during transmission bottlenecks as discussed above, but they can also reach fixation by rising in frequency directly within the host body over the course of an infection itself. This alternate pathway, called within-host adaptation, strongly affects the likelihood of adaptation and emergence of an introduced pathogen. In particular, for a given reproductive number, R 0 , the risk of emergence is larger for pathogens that provoke long-lasting infections (figure 2). Long infections are intrinsically more prone to adaptive evolution because the amount of time during which within-host selection can operate is increased.",

In this case, long-lived infections also experience a greater average rate of within-host adaptation (see equation (2.4)).

Antibiotic resistance is probably most likely to occur by mutation (or recombination with other bacterial species) and then fixation within an infection owing to local selection imposed by the antibiotic. Indeed it is probably unreasonable to think that antibiotic resistance reaches fixation only by chance at the time of transmission to a new host. The same reasoning applies to the evolution of escape mutants in the presence of vaccine use as well. As a consequence, the key parameters that treatments should control are not only the reproductive number of an infection but its duration as well.

In other words, pathogen adaptation is likely to be characterized by an increase of its replication ability within the host body. For instance, in the case of influenza, viruses that are adapted to birds have been shown to replicate poorly in humans, and vice versa (Webby et al. 2004) . Therefore, in addition to being favourable to the infection as a whole, a large fraction of the initial adaptations occurring in a novel pathogen are probably beneficial to microbes in local competition within a host as well. Moreover, the large population size and short generation time of microbes within a host should also enhance the importance of this process since within-host populations can then 'test' numerous mutations. This contrasts with the adaptive mutations that are not favoured locally and that can fix only by chance at transmission. Mutations fixing at transmission are a somewhat random subset of all the mutations that have occurred, and many of these are likely to be deleterious or neutral to the infection.",

In this case, neutral polymorphism increases during the course of an infection owing to de novo mutations. As a result, even in the absence of within-host adaptation per se, the probability of adaptation at transmission, u, is expected to be an increasing function of the length of infection, again suggesting that long-lasting infections should be more dangerous. Second, mutation is not the only source of adaptation, but rather recombination and/or reassortment between pathogen strains within a host can also occur. For instance in the case of influenza, reassortment between an avian strain and a human strain is thought to be the decisive event leading to the emergence of influenza pandemics, and this event is all the more likely to occur for avian influenza strains that provoke long infections in each human that they accidentally infect.",

First we assumed that each infection is established by a single pathogen genotype. Therefore, any new infection that is generated is either a wild-type infection (with a probability 1Ku) or a mutant infection (with a probability u), and cannot be made up of an intermediate frequency of both types (see also Antia et al. 2003) . Second, and more importantly for the present paper, we considerably simplified the process of within-host adaptation. We assumed that the predominant genotype of an infection could change instantaneously (at a rate m(s) where s is infection age) into a mutant infection owing to 'withinhost adaptation'. In other words, once an adaptive mutation has appeared within an infection, its reaches fixation effectively instantaneously. This assumption is very useful for simplifying the mathematical analysis; however, it has the dangerous side effect of providing a somewhat caricatured image of within-host adaptation. It is very likely that within-host selection is not strong enough in many instances to yield the complete fixation of adaptive mutants within the course of a single infection. Instead, within-host selection might only yield an increase in the frequency of adaptive mutants during each infection. Even in this case, however, within-host selection (and all other within-host processes) will boost the probability of emergence in long-lasting infections by increasing the probability of an adaptive mutation being transmitted to susceptible hosts. Thus the qualitative conclusions reached here should nevertheless be quite robust.",

Suppose that a single mutation is sufficient for adaptation such that b a Od a , where the subscript a refers to the adapted pathogen. In order to calculate the probability of emergence, we first derive the probability, Q(t), that an introduced pathogen, present in the population at time t, ultimately goes extinct. Let us also define Q a (t) as the probability that an adapted pathogen, present in the population at time t, ultimately goes extinct. Equations for Q(t) and Q a (t) can be derived by considering all the events that might occur during an infinitesimal period dt First, the maladapted strain might give rise to a new infection (with probability bdt) in which case this infection will also be maladapted with probability (1Ku) and it will have mutated to the adapted strain with probability u. In these cases, the probability of ultimate extinction is Q(tCdt) 2 and Q(tCdt) Q a (tCdt), respectively. Second, the infection can give rise to an adaptive mutation as a result of within-host processes with probability mdt, in which case extinction occurs with probability Q a (tCdt). Finally, the infection itself ends and extinction occurs with probability ddt. Similar considerations hold for the equation for Q a (t). Equation (A 1) assumes that the introduced strain never attains high prevalence and, therefore, does not affect the density of susceptible hosts. In contrast, the evolved strain is assumed to be very efficient (b a [d a ). Therefore, its fate is decided while it is still at very low frequency. As a result, the density of susceptible hosts can be assumed constant (n) during the whole stochastic process, and the rates at which both genotypes produce new infections (bZbn and b a Zb a n) are therefore also constant. Accordingly, the probabilities of ultimate loss (Q and Q a ) can be derived by modeling the demography of the strains as a branching process (Fisher 1922 (Fisher , 1930 pp. 73-83; Haldane 1927; Antia et al. 2003) , i.e. a single copy of each strain, present at time t, has the same probability of being lost as a copy present at tCdt.

Assuming that the opposite probability P 1 Z1KQ 1 is low (which is reasonable as more than one adaptive mutation is required to spread), the probability of emergence can be expressed by a Taylor development to the first-order on P 1 and on mutation parameters as PZ[BuCTmCo(u)Co(m)] P 1 Co(P 1 ), where TZL/(1KR 0 ) and BZR 0 /(1KR 0 ). The probability of emergence of the strain with one mutation can in turn be expressed as P 1 Z[BuCTmC o(u)Co(m)]P 2 Co(P 2 ), assuming that P 2 is low. Therefore, the probability of emergence gives approximately Pz[BuCTm] 2 P 2 . This can be repeated m times to yield the probability of emergence Pz[BuCTm] m P a , which is equation (2.2) of the text. This derivation assumes that the probability of emergence of all non-adapted strains (P i ,ci!m) are low but it does not make any assumption about the probability of emergence of the adapted strain (P a ZP m ). To derive general results for pathogens with arbitrary life histories we need to take a different approach. Suppose that a novel pathogen is introduced into the human population. We would like to calculate the probability that at least one adaptive mutation occurs prior to the pathogen lineage going extinct. First let's condition on the total number of transmission events, t, that occur before the pathogen dies out, as well as the realized durations of all of the tC1 infections (denoted by L 1 , L 2 , ., L tC1 ). For maximum generality, we allow the rate at which adaptation occurs via with-host processes (i.e. m) to change with infection age. For example, we might sometimes expect that the rate at which adaptation occurs during an infection is higher later in an infection. In this case, the probability that at least one adaptive mutation occurs during the entire outbreak is one minus the probability that no mutations occur: 1K \u00f01K u\u00de t e K \u00d0 L 1 0 m\u00f0s\u00deds e K \u00d0 L 2 0 m\u00f0s\u00deds .e K \u00d0 L tC1 0 m\u00f0s\u00deds . This can be written as 1K \u00f01K u\u00de t exp\u00f0K m\u00f0L 1 \u00deL 1 K m\u00f0L 2 \u00deL 2 /K m\u00f0L tC1 \u00deL tC1 \u00de, where m\u00f0L\u00deZ 1 L \u00d0 L 0 m\u00f0s\u00deds is the average rate of within-host adaptation over an infection of length L. We then need to un-condition the variables t and \u00d0 L h\u00f0L 1 ; L 2 ; . ; L tC1 \u00de to obtain the probability of emergence",
