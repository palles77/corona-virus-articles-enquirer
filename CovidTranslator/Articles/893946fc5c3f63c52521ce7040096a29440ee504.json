            "text": "The objective of this study was to compare serum IgG concentrations, blood metabolites indicative of nutritional status, weight gain and mortality rate in goat kids fed a commercial colostral supplement containing immunoglobulins against several pathogen microorganisms, prior to the ingestion of the mother colostrum, and goat kids ingesting natural colostrum only. There was no difference in serum IgG concentrations between 27 kids fed a colostrum supplement (20 g, derived from cow lacteal secretions) prior to the kids' first meal (658\u00b1703 mg dl \u22121 ) and 21 kids ingesting maternal colostrum freely (1011\u00b1 1140 mg dl \u22121 ) at 24 hours of birth. Hematocrit values, serum glucose and urea concentrations at 24 hours and 5 days of age were unaffected by treatment. Serum total proteins were 14% higher (P<0.05) in the unsuplemented group than in the supplemented group at 5 d of age. There was no significant difference between the supplemented and unsupplemented kids in daily weight gain from birth to 70 days of age (92\u00b14.8 vs 102\u00b15.1 g day \u22121 ). Mortality was 4% for kids receiving the colostrum supplement as compared with 0.0% for kids ingesting maternal colostrum only. Results suggest that, in intensively managed non-dairy goats with kiddings in summer, the supplementation of this commercial colostrum derived from cow lacteal secretions and containing antibodies against diverse pathogens organisms did not enhanced growth, survival or immunity under the farming conditions of this study.",

Unfortunately, several studies indicate that an important proportion of kids do not reach this level of serum IgG shortly after birth (Sherman et al. 1990; Mellado et al. 1998) . To overcome the problem of insufficient absorption of colostral Ig, a possible solution would be the feeding of kids with colostrum replacers or supplement products, in addition to the maternal colostrum, which would provide a sufficient amount of IgG to prevent failure of passive transfer in young kids. In calves (Zaremba et al. 1993; Ikemori et al. 1997; Morin et al. 1997 ) and goat kids (Sherman et al. 1990; Constant et al. 1994; Zadoks et al. 2001) absorption of IgG from colostrum supplements has been reported to be poor. In these studies colostrum replacers have been used as substitutes for cow or goat colostrum, thus, it is unknown if there is a synergistic effect of the combination of maternal and exogenous IgG on gammaglobulin concentration in new-born kids. The objective of this study was to compare the plasma IgG and metabolites concentration in new-born goat kids fed exogenous IgG via a colostrum supplement derived from cow lacteal secretions or only maternal colostrum. An additional objective was to determine if oral administration of a colostrum substitute containing antibodies against various pathogen organisms, in addition to maternal colostrum, would result in better weight gains and lower mortality rates of goat kids.",

This product is derived from cow lacteal secretions and contains immunoglobulins for newborn calves against K99 E. coli scours, Salmonella dublin, Clostridium perfringens, Brucella, IBR, and Haemophilus somnus). The colostrum supplement was dissolved in coliform-free water, prior to their first suckling immediately after birth.

To ensure complete and uniform delivery of the colostrum supplement, a catheter inserted into a 30 ml syringe was utilized, with which colostrum was delivered into the esophagus.",

The colostrum substitute used in the present study derived from lacteal secretion, which explains the null effect of this supplement on circulating serum IgG. Serum total proteins levels in kids fed the colostrum supplement prior to the kids' first meal were lower than those found in unsupplemented kids. Apparently, serum total protein levels decreased as a consequence of a tendency toward a lower immunoglobulin levels in kids given the colostrum supplement. These results are in accord with those of Kirovski et al. (2002) who found that total protein concentrations increased as a consequence of colostral immunoglobulin absorption.",

Although the control goat kids were lighter at the beginning of the experiment, at 70 days they were heavier than the treatment group. No statistical differences between groups were found for this trait, but the 11% increment in average daily gain in the unsupplemented goat kids could be of practical importance.",

Kid mortality is related with IgG serum concentration (Dos Santos et al. 1994; Arguello et al. 2004 ), but in the present study kids with low IgG did not become ill or die, probably because facilities were clean, animal density was low, farm management was good, temperature was mild, and challenge by pathogenic organisms was low.
