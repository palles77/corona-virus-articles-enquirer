On the whole, 336 (42%) patients were detected as positive for one or more respiratory viruses. The most widely circulating virus was human respiratory syncytial virus (hRSV) infecting 50% of positive patients, followed by human metapneumovirus (hMPV) found in 13% of patients, and then by influenza virus type A, human parainfluenzaviruses and coinfections. Significant variations in the circulation rate of hRSV, hMPV and influenzavirus type A were observed during the individual seasons. In addition, the circulation rates of the different types of hMPV changed yearly. In 2001 hMPV circulated at a significant lower proportion than hRSV, while in 2003-2004 the circulation rates of the two viruses were closer. In conclusion, the 4 hMPV subtypes circulated yearly in Northern Italy flanking hRSV as major respiratory pathogens in the infantile patient population. * Human metapneumovirus (hMPV), the most recently identified human respiratory viral pathogen [17] along with the new human coronaviruses (hCoVs) Sars-CoV, NL63 and New Haven virus [6, 21] , is the etiologic agent of upper and lower respiratory tract infections in both the immunocompetent and the immunocompromised hosts [1, 4, 5, 7, 11, 20, 22] .

Nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPA) were collected upon admission and then divided into 4 aliquots: one was used for molecular assays (RT-PCR), the second for direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) staining of respiratory cells, the third for short-term and long-term virus isolation in cell cultures, and the fourth was frozen as a back-up sample [13] . Specimens were examined for influenzaviruses A and B, parainfluenzaviruses (hPIV) 1 to 3, hRSV, and human adenoviruses (hAdV) by DFA and virus isolation in cell cultures. In addition, hCoVs, group I (229E-like) and II (OC43-like), and hMPV types A and B were sought by RT-PCR. Typing of hMPV strains was achieved by sequencing and phylogenetic analysis. Similarly, grouping of hCoVs was achieved by sequencing. The study was approved by the IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo Ethics Committee. The simultaneous detection of 2 respiratory viruses in the same NPA was referred to as coinfection.",

The Philips (njplot) program was used to construct phylogenetic trees with nucleotide sequences by means of the neighbour-joining method from the same distance matrices. Bootstrap support was determined by 100 resamplings of the sequences.",

Both viruses were nearly absent during the summer-fall seasons, whereas they were highly circulating, at a different proportion, during the winter-spring seasons. Although the incidence of hRSV infections in pediatric patients admitted to the An epidemiological survey on the circulation rate of the most important respiratory viruses responsible for admission to the hospital of infants and young children in a defined geographical area during the 3-year period from 2001 through 2004 was conducted using NPA samples as clinical specimens. In order to contain costs, on the basis of recently acquired results showing a comparable sensitivity of the molecular (RT-PCR) and the immunological (monoclonals) diagnostic approaches [13] , influenzaviruses A and B, hPIV 1-3, hRSV, and hAdVs were detected by monoclonal antibodies, while hCoVs and hMPVs were detected by RT-PCR. While no significant difference was observed in the circulation rate of the majority of respiratory viruses, a significant difference in the circulation of influenzavirus A, hRSV and hMPV, was found during the 3 consecutive winterspring seasons. Apart from influenzaviruses A, which are known to circulate differently in different years, hMPV and hRSV circulated at a stable rate in the first 2 seasons examined. On the contrary, the relative proportion of patients infected by hRSV decreased sharply in the most recent season, while that of patients infected by hMPV increased significantly. As a consequence, the number of young patients admitted to the hospital because of lower respiratory tract infections caused by hMPV increased accordingly. Yearly variation in the circulation rate of hMPV has been recently reported [7, 8, 11, 19] .",

Whether different hMPV types and subtypes may be differentiated only on the basis of nucleotide sequence (phylogenetic analysis) or may represent true serotypes or subserotypes remains to be determined. In fact, while ferret immune sera have been reported to identify two distinct serotypes (A and B) showing a \u226516fold dilution difference between homologous and heterologous neutralizing antibody titer [18] , several primate as well as hamster immune sera did not show any discriminating capacity [15] . Similarly, in our experience, as already reported by others [16] , guinea pig immune sera were not able to identify two distinct serotypes. Thus, at the moment, the terms types and subtypes indicate genotypes and subgenotypes rather than serotypes and subserotypes. In a recent study by our group, using a fragment of gene N (nt 80 to 596), it was possible to identify 8 amino acid substitutions at positions 14, 31, 52, 56, 63, 66, 70, and 96, that might be used to differentiate type A from type B strains [14] . Monoclonal antibodies reactive with epitopes containing these differential amino acids might discriminate between the two hMPV types.",

In a recent population-based prospective multicenter study of the children requiring intensive care conducted in Germany over 2 years, 18% had hMPV infections, and 60% of these children were infected with hMPV in combination with hRSV, whereas hMPV was not detected in a large series of hRSV-positive children not requiring intensive care support. This data support the hypothesis that coinfections with hRSV and hMPV are more severe than infections with either hRSV or hMPV alone, at least in children less than 3 years of age [10] . In our study, outside the intensive care unit, surprisingly a single case of coinfection by hMPV and hRSV was found, thus suggesting that this coinfection is very infrequent in the immunocompetent host.",
