It is present among mice in many commercial breeding colonies and most biom\u00e9dical research institutions and has been documented in laboratory mice throughout the world. Recognition of the ubiquity of MHV is often not realized because of unfamiliarity with its biology, reliance on insensitive diagnostic methods and the subtle effects of the virus. Its subtle effects should not be underestimated, however, since MHV has been associated with a panoply of effects on mice and research data derived from them.",

However, others have shown neurotropic MHV is eventually cleared from the brain (18,19,48,57,67).

An obvious exception is the athymic nude mouse, which suffers from a wasting syndrome due to chronic, persistent MHV infections. In contrast to their heterozygous euthymic counterparts, which recover within 2-3 weeks, homozygous athymic mice develop increasingly high titers of virus in multiple organs, ultimately dying from hepatitis or encephalitis.

Serum IF levels are low in MHV-infected immature mice and elevated in adults (82), but others have found that resistant mouse genotypes may produce lower levels of IF than susceptible genotypes in response to MHV infection (88,101). Others have found the same degree of IF levels (93). Tissue IF levels have also been variably correlated with resistance (88,102). It is apparent that IF plays a role in the initial response of mice to MHV (97), and becomes elevated in adult, susceptible genotypes because of permissive infections, also resulting in increased natural killer (NK) cell activity in some mice.",
