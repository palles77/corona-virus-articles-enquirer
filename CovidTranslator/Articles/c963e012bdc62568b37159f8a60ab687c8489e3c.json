We calculated a mean plume at each release amount and then re-sampled 1,000 random plumes from each mean plume.

To generate the simulated outbreaks for each release amount, we first sampled an exposure grid and calculated the number infected by home ZIP code. The next step was to select a set of disease and health-care utilization parameters. We then generated a disease path for each infected individual, the timing of visits to physicians for symptomatic individuals, the administrative codes generated through visits, and the occurrence, timing and results of blood culture testing.",

LHS is an approach to sampling parameter values from a highdimensional parameter space in order to obtain estimates of output variables that are more efficient and precise than would be obtained with simple random sampling [16] . When specifying a simulation model there are K parameters. A given run of the simulation model requires a value for each parameter, or a set of parameter values X = {X 1 , . . . , X K }. Each parameter has a space of possible values S = {S 1 , . . . , S K }. In LHS the space for each parameter is partitioned into N intervals of probability size 1/N . The Cartesian product of these intervals partitions S into N K cells, which form a hypercube. To obtain X for a simulation run requires randomly sampling a partition for each parameter, and then sampling a parameter value from within that partition, assuming that values are uniformly distributed within a partition. Table 1 shows the parameter value intervals used in the simulation study.",

Similarly, we sampled 1,000 exposure grids and all 3 scenarios used the same 1,000 re-sample exposure plumes. 2 Finally, the same random number generator with the same seed value was used for each scenario. We used a combined multiple recursive generator as proposed and implemented by L'Ecuyer with the default initial seed [14] .
