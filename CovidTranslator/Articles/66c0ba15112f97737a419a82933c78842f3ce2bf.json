We describe how a collaboration between the NPHIs of England and South Africa built a mutually beneficial professional relationship to help implement the WHO International Health Regulations, build capacity for health protection, and promote the exchange of information, advice, and expertise. We illustrate how this can be achieved in a mutually beneficial way.",

It made a commitment to 'increase UK and global health security' by strengthening surveillance and response capacity to infectious diseases 6 . It called for establishing long-term links with equivalent institutions in other countries. When updated in 2011, the strategy defined 12 global health outcomes in three broad areas for action: global health security, international development, and trade 7 . Then governments of the UK, including Northern Ireland, signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the Republic of South Africa for a reciprocal exchange of healthcare professionals. It was intended to enhance clinical and technical skills in both countries, and explore best practices. The UK chose HPA as one of the institutions to implement the MoU. HPA welcomed the opportunity to establish a partnership with NICD in Johannesburg. As an institute with a similar mandate and relevant expertise, it could enable its neighbouring countries to develop these skills. To cultivate global health work, the Department of Health committed in 2008 a grant of \u00a31.9 million over 5 years to the HPA. From this global health fund the secondment to South Africa was funded. The NICD, through its various training programmes, had a long history of supporting other African countries to build their capacity. In some countries, such as the Democratic Republic of the Congo, NICD responded more directly by investigating sources of emerging disease threats 8 . Initially structured as the HPA/NICD collaboration, it evolved to become the PHE/NICD collaboration.",

HPA/PHE's specialist microbiology services provide a comprehensive range of clinical diagnostic and public health microbiology tests and services. Elements of the UK's system exist in eight regional laboratories across England and in national centres. Fourteen scientists from NICD spent 3-6 weeks with their counterpart laboratories in HPA/PHE, updating their skills in specific methods and learning new approaches to diagnostics. 2. Epidemiology Methods came to be recognised a specific need for NICD. To build capacity, 12 NICD epidemiologists and data analysts worked for 3 months with their counterparts in the epidemiology section of HPA/PHE. Visiting NICD scientists took home skills not yet in use at NICD, spurring completely new areas of work at NICD, such as geospatial analysis of epidemiological data. The visits also advanced collaboration in TB surveillance plus other areas. An epidemiologist from NICD who spent time with the health-care associated infections surveillance team in HPA/PHE is now planning a similar surveillance programme in South Africa. 3. Management expertise advanced when senior members of NICD staff spent shorter periods (1-2 weeks) with HPA/PHE counterparts in the UK exchanging ideas on management approaches in specific areas of work and exploring ideas for collaborative projects. 4. Unexpected areas of engagement evolved. NICD established, for example, a Biocontainment Engineering Management and Support Program with assistance from HPA/PHE colleagues. This undertaking grew out of a visit by HPA/PHE engineers and specialists to assess engineering capacity and gaps in critical containment equipment maintenance at NICD. One NICD engineer visited the BSL 4 laboratory in London, after which his hosts developed a training curriculum and training strategy for biocontainment staff.",

Rapid spread of SARS in Toronto in 2003 revealed a need for clinical and public health capacity to respond, [9] [10] and heightened awareness in the UK of the value of local expertise about uncommon infectious diseases. Exchanges with the NICD prepared UK public health registrars for risks that could emerge from an increasingly diverse UK population and from London as a major hub of global travel. 2. Specific departments in HPA/PHE, including the TB and HIV/ Sexually Transmitted Infections sections, used staff exchanges to form departmental level continuing relationships. Joint projects illustrate the value of these on-going collaborations, for example, exploring the use of whole genome sequencing to guide the use of public health responses to TB in low-and high-incidence settings. 3. Formal collaboration offers on-going informal access to mutually beneficial resources across both institutions. Colleagues from both institutes call their counterparts to discuss outbreak situations, or diagnostic options for rare pathogens.",
