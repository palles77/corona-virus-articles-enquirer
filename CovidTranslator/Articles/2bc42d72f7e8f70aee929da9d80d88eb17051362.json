            "text": "Respiratory tract infection is a major cause of hospitalization in children. Although most such infections are viral in origin, it is difficult to differentiate bacterial and viral infections, as the clinical symptoms are similar. Multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods allow testing for multiple pathogens simultaneously and are, therefore, gaining interest. This prospective case-control study was conducted from October 2013 to February 2014. Nasopharyngeal (NP) and oropharyngeal (throat) swabs were obtained from children admitted with severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) at a tertiary hospital. A control group of 40 asymptomatic children was included. Testing for 16 viruses was done by real-time multiplex PCR. Multiplex PCR detected a viral pathogen in 159/177 (89.9 %) patients admitted with SARI. There was a high rate of co-infection (46.9 %). Dual detections were observed in 64 (36.2 %), triple detections in 17 (9.6 %), and quadruple detections in 2 (1.1 %) of 177 samples. Seventyeight patients required intensive care unit (ICU) admission, of whom 28 (35.8 %) had co-infection with multiple viruses. AdV, HBoV, HRV, HEV, and HCoV-OC43 were also detected among asymptomatic children. This study confirms the high rate of detection of viral nucleic acids by multiplex PCR among hospitalized children admitted with SARI, as well as the high rate of co-detection of multiple viruses. AdV, HBoV, HRV, HEV, and HCoV-OC43 were also detected in asymp-tomatic children, resulting in challenges in clinical interpretation. Studies are required to provide quantitative conclusions that will facilitate clinical interpretation and application of the results in the clinical setting.",

To date, quantitative conclusions are not reliably established, neither for monoplex PCR nor for multiplex PCR [1] . Rhedin et al. showed that the nucleic acids of RSV, hMPV, and parainfluenza virus can be confirmed almost exclusively in symptomatic children and very rarely in asymptomatic children. Their results indicate that a qPCR finding of RSV, hMPV, or PIV is likely to be causative of disease in children with acute respiratory infection, and that detection of several other viruses, such as HBoV, HRV, AdV, HCoV, and HEV, must be interpreted with caution, due to the high detection rates among healthy children [9] . The detection of AdV, HBoV, HRV, HCoV-OC43, and HEV among asymptomatic children in the current study and the absence of RSV, hMPV, Flu A, Flu B, hPIV-1-2-3-4, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-229E in these children support these findings.",
