Almost all the denuded axons remained intact, exhibiting no noticeable morphological changes. There was evidence of a moderate vasogenic oedema, but minimal signs of haemorrhage in the lesion. Seven days after treatment, many immature Schwann cells but no oligodendrocytes were found between the denuded axons. By 2 weeks many of the denuded axons were remyelinated, and by 4 weeks almost all of those axons located near the pial and per;vascular surfaces had been remyelinated by Schwann cells, while most of those located in the deep and marginal zones bordering the adjoining intact areas were remyelinated by oligodendrocytes. Longitudinal sections revealed that at nodes of Ranvier PNS-type myelin sheaths were apposed by either intact or newly formed CNS-type myelin sheaths. A typical glial limiting rnembrane was not reformed beneath the pial surface, but an inconspicuous one was found between the PNS-and CNS-type fibre areas.",

Thus in Cuprizone (Ludwin, 1978) and ordinary EAE (Lampert, 1965) injuries in which the GLM is retained intact, few Schwann cells appear in the lesion. Harrison (1985) thinks that Schwann cells invade the CNS tissue through damaged GLM at the perivascular and subpial surfaces. Astrocytes therefore seem to block the invasion of Schwann cells. No astrocytes were found in CNS lesions where axons were exclusively myelinated by Schwann cells (Hammang et al., 1986) . In contrast, Schwann cells are rarely seen at the sites where astrocyte processes have proliferated throughout the CNS lesions as a result of LPC and 6-AN treatment, and JHM virus and TME virus infection (Blakemore, 1975 (Blakemore, , 1976 Nagashima et al., 1979; Dal Canto & Lipton, 1980) , as well as Schwann cell implantation into normal nervous tissue (Blakemore et al., 1986) .",

However, even when the roots and their entry zones are preserved undamaged, many Schwann cells have been seen in the midline of the dorsal funiculus, far from the root entry (Gilmore & Sims, 1986 ). On the other hand, Schwann cells of the perivascular autonomic nerves (Ghatak et aI., 1973) and of small nerves located in a pial layer (Blakemore, 1983 ) could proliferate and migrate into the lesion. Though the sources of ectopic Schwann cells could not be clearly identified, the present study indicates that damage to glial cells as well as the GLM at the pial and perivascular surfaces might be the most important prerequisite (Blakemore et aI., 1986) .",

In these studies, as in the present study, remyelination by oligodendrocytes occurred in deep areas of the lesion, where there might be no influence of the damaged GLM. On the other hand, there is evidence that astrocytes can co-operate to some extent with oligodendrocytes in the facilitation of myelination (Blakemore, 1975 (Blakemore, , 1984 Fig. 11 . One month after treatment. This electron micrograph shows a longitudinal section from the caudal part of the lesion. A myelin sheath newly formed by Schwann cells (S) makes a node of Ranvier (arrow) at the junction with a thick CNS-type myelin sheath (C) which presumably survived the heat treatment. There are two fibres that are partly myelinated by Schwann cells (S) and partly by otigodendrocytes (O1), forming new nodes of Ranvier between them (arrowheads). x 7600. Inset: a high-powered micrograpl~ showing a similar node of Ranvier taken from other section. A lateral loop (asterisk) of the oligodendrocyte is contiguous with a Schwann cell process (arrowhead). No astrocyte process is interposed between them. x 28 000. Harrison, 1985) . In the present study, however, there were relatively greater numbers of oligodendrocytes in the CNS-PNS border zone in which astrocytes and their processes were sparse. This finding indicates that oligodendrocytes can myelinate d e n u d e d axons in the presence of even only a few astrocytes. ",
