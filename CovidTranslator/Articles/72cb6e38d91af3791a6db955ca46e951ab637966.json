While some of these situations are intentionally created by man, others result from unintentional accidents, and still others are weather related. Each and every day, facilities react to a variety of emergency conditions. Emergencies can be divided into internal and external situations for the purpose of this text. Regardless of the nature of the emergency, the organizational response will be quite different when the emergency condition exists within the facility from when it occurs at some distant location. The actual emergency response programs of healthcare facilities indicate that much more effort has gone into a prepared response to external emergencies than to internal emergencies. Exceptions can be found in the areas of fire safety and bomb threat programs, in which various regulatory and accrediting agencies have considerable involvement. A general list of situations that require emergency planning is difficult to compile; however, the situations listed in Table 42-1 should serve as a starting point, depending on the geographical location and type of patient care facility. The media and healthcare management publications have reported case histories for all of these listed emergency situations.",

The security response will primarily be a support role in the care and treatment of patients. A different involvement is indicated when the emergency situation occurs within (internal) or in the immediate area of the healthcare facility. As a general rule, the plan for security response to any emergency should be based, as a foundation, on everyday security safeguards and organizational resources in place. In other words, handling emergency protection needs should be viewed as an extension or expansion of the regular day-to-day security program. When facilities develop complex emergency plans that greatly differ from the normal handling of patients and basic pathways, confusion and inefficiency may result when the plan is activated. It is understood that circumstances may, however, dictate such changes. A case in point is the casualty triage receiving area. If this activity is moved from the normal triage location to another location, supplies and equipment must be moved, and police officers, firefighters, ambulance drivers, and facility personnel must be reoriented to respond to a new and perhaps unfamiliar location. The protection management plan then also becomes more complex and often unnecessarily burdensome.",

Despite their efforts, the federal healthcare sector has been characterized as the weakest link in the homeland security chain. 1 The International Association for Healthcare Security and Safety (IAHSS) has developed the following basic industry security guideline relative to healthcare emergency management. Hospital Leadership. The first steps in developing plans and programs to manage emergencies include the setting up of a work group (a multidisciplinary committee). This work group would include representation from the Medical Staff, Nursing, Risk Management, Facilities, Security, Safety, and others deemed appropriate. In the past the Director/ Manager of Security was often the person who was given the responsibility to lead this group. Today, it is somewhat common for the hospital to staff the position of Emergency Preparedness Director. Table 42-2 shows the results of a recent study of different hospital positions that have the leadership responsibility for the Emergency Preparedness Program. Phases of Emergency Management. The TJC views emergency management in four phases that take place over a period of time. These include: mitigation, preparedness, response, and recovery. The mitigation and preparedness phases generally occur before an emergency event, whereas response and recovery are phases that take place after the event. The details of activities and actions required relative to these four phases should be captured in the organization's Emergency Operations Plan (EOP). Once the EOP is completed, it must be tested through emergency response exercises and drills to evaluate its effectiveness. Thus, emergency management is an ongoing process of planning, directives, evaluation, more planning, added or changed directives, etc.",

Drills serve a very important purpose, and they must be conducted with all the realism possible. It is extremely difficult, however, to rehearse certain parts of an emergency disaster plan when the facility is open and conducting routine, everyday business. One of the most difficult elements to practice is that of people and vehicle traffic control. It is not practical to restrict visiting or to turn away patients who have an appointment.

It is therefore natural to conduct emergency exercises and drills, both organization-specific and community-wide.

Facility inspections are conducted by all kinds of inspectors, including representatives of insurance companies, CMS, TJC, city building departments, state and city health departments, and fire department personnel. Some of the best inspections, however, are those conducted by organizational personnel. If they are conducted properly, a continuous, everyday fire inspection program is accomplished. Security officers on their rounds should note and/or correct fire hazards they see or that are brought to their attention by others. Security officers on rounds should be particularly alert for people smoking in prohibited areas. Officers should correct and report doors left open that should be closed, obstructions to egress paths, careless use of oxygen cylinders, and other fire safety violations.

Smoke detectors use sensing units that respond to the presence of products of combustion that result from a fire. Other types of detectors may respond to heat or flame. When the threshold is exceeded, the sensor is activated. Most HCF fire detection systems use a combination of devices due to the varied situations the medical care environment presents. Activation of a fire detection device may also control various items of equipment; it may activate fire extinguishing equipment and air-handling machinery, send elevators to predetermined locations, and release magnetic hold-open devices on doors.",

            "text": "Containment. The third element of the fire safety program is the containment of smoke and fire. The objective is to contain the fire in the room or area of origin. When this is not possible, the goal is to provide successive levels of defense or areas of refuge from the fire. The five basic areas of fire containment are sometimes referred to as the unit concept. The units are the room, the compartment, the floor, the building, and the exits, all of which have a distinct function in the fire protection features of the building. l Unit 1. The room -the smallest unit -is the first line of defense. The function of Unit 1 is to provide the first barrier against the passage of smoke. The more effectively a room can be sealed, the better job it will do in containing fires. l Unit 2. The compartment is the second level of defense. The intention is to provide at least two areas of refuge on every horizontal plane of the facility. When an area must be evacuated, the initial movement is horizontal rather than vertical. The Unit 2 compartment is created by smoke and barrier walls. l Unit 3. The floor, or floor assembly, is the next level of containment. The function of the floor assembly is to prevent the spread of fire and smoke from one floor to another. l Unit 4. The building is the fourth level of protection. For the building to remain structurally intact for a period of time, it should maintain structural components that offer minimum contribution to any fuel load and that can withstand the effects of a fire within the facility. l Unit 5. The exit path is the final unit in this concept of fire protection. At least two remote exits must be provided on each floor or fire section of the building. Exits do not need to lead directly to the outside. They can include egress to interior stairs, exterior stairs, horizontal exits, ramps, and exit passageways. Fire containment can also limit the air needed to sustain combustion. The heat and smoke from a fire generally rises as a result of the buoyancy created by the heated gases. The smoke and heat will also seek out a path to the outside air. If they cannot continue to rise, the smoke and heat will descend back to the floor level.",

            "text": "Evacuation (Relocation). The fourth component of the facility fire safety plan is relocation of patients, visitors, and staff. The Life Safety Code -through its standards for exit capacities, types of exits, travel distance, door specifications, and similar details -ensures the necessary means of egress from a medical care facility during an emergency. It is the healthcare staff, however, who is responsible for moving any patients who are in imminent danger to a safe location. In hospitals, many occupants are incapable of self-preservation. This fact is recognized by the Life Safety Code, which places the main responsibility for patient safety on the HCF staff. Total building evacuation, as a measure of last resort, can and does occur. Patient relocation between smokeprotected compartments on the same floor is usually an adequate first step. Following the unit concept principle, the evacuation plan's first objective is to move patients to a safe compartment. At this point, it must be determined whether to continue horizontal evacuation or whether vertical movement (to another floor) is necessary. Wheelchairs and carts are useful and often necessary for relocating patients, but they may not always be available at the time and place of need. Blankets are always available, and security professionals generally agree that they can be the most important pieces of equipment on hand for evacuation. Elevators should receive special consideration in the fire evacuation plan. Generally, plans prohibit the use of elevators for egress or relocation purposes because of their recall features, which are normally activated in a fire condition. An elevator may stop at the wrong floor, exposing its occupants to the fire. On the other hand, high-rise hospitals present unique problems that may require the use of elevators for vertical relocation under controlled conditions. In addition, the fire department may need to utilize an elevator for their firefighting purposes. Generally a building of more than seven stories is considered a high-rise, and is the limit of most fire department ladders. A vertical evacuation plan is mandatory for highrise buildings. One or more elevators in a wing removed from the fire area may be used to transport patients to another floor much more quickly and with fewer possible medical complications than when patients are carried down a stairwell.",

The suppression of fire by staff is achieved manually or by automatic suppression systems required for all new construction. The automatic sprinkler system is the most common of the automatic suppression devices. The automatic sprinkler system also acts as an alarm device because all systems are installed with water-flow sensors that activate an alarm when water is flowing in the pipes. The sprinkler is activated by a thermally sensitive element that automatically releases water at a predetermined temperature. Other piped extinguishing systems include water spray, foam, carbon dioxide, dry chemical, Halon, and newer, environmentally sensitive, clean agents. The standpipe and hose system, found in most U.S. medical care facilities, is used to provide quick and convenient water streams. This system is most generally used by fire departments or trained fire brigade personnel. It is not uncommon to eliminate the hose at the valve locations. The rationale for this is that most fire departments supply their own hose. Further, there have been reports of vandalism by opening the valve a little and allowing the hose in the cabinet to fill slowly with water. The hand-held extinguishers used in medical care facilities are primarily 2.5 gallon, stored-pressure water extinguishers, carbon dioxide extinguishers, and multipurpose (ABC) extinguishers. The type of extinguisher at any given location is predicated on the primary type of hazard involved. Employee Reaction to Fire Events. Proper employee reaction to a fire is one of the fundamental factors in saving lives and property. Fire safety is a race against time, and the action taken within the first few minutes can make the difference between a minor fire threat and a tragic disaster. Because employees must act almost instinctively when fire breaks out, detailed instructions are seldom remembered.

The high rate of personnel turnover in medical care facilities and the difficulty of retaining procedures that are not used routinely require continuous in-service and new employee training classes. Fire safety training is usually the responsibility of the Safety Administrator. Training can include posters, contests, in-service training, and fire drills. One of the obstacles faced in fire safety training is that little uniformity exists among facility fire plans. Because of the transient characteristic of medical care staff, an individual may work at two or more facilities at the same time. Organizations and facilities all have unique characteristics that require special fire planning; however, especially within a given locality, common fire plan components among facilities would reduce training time. Basic Security Fire Response Considerations. Security's role in a fire situation is part of the overall facility fire plan, which includes: l Ensuring that responding fire department personnel gain access to the facility complex, buildings, and internal areas. This may require unlocking gates or doors, holding elevators, turning on lights, and even escorting fire personnel to the fire area. l Securing the area after the conclusion of the incident. A fire watch may be required for some time after the fire has been extinguished. l Providing security officer fire training. This training goes far beyond the general employee fire training previously discussed. Security officers are not only the first responders in many cases. The action taken in the first few minutes will bear directly on the outcome. Initial concerns involve sizing up the situation for personal safety, sounding an alarm, containment, and controlling the fire. Beyond these basics, there may be evidence that should be protected or conversations that should be noted and retained. Arson does happen in medical care facilities. Security officers must notice if someone has an unnatural or unusual interest in the fire. In short, security officers may be exposed to too much information in the initial moments of a fire -information that must not go unnoticed or it may be lost forever.",

These basic questions become the framework of the facility response plan. The plan must be flexible to the degree that the information received can be applied to these questions at the time of the threat crisis. A bomb can be described as any explosive, incendiary, or gas-filled container. Many chemicals can be used to make a bomb, and most chemicals are easily obtainable. Dynamite can be purchased or stolen from construction sites. Ammonium nitrate is sold in stores that handle fertilizers. Potassium nitrate and black powder can be bought at shops that supply chemists or hunters. Pipe bombs are commonly used by amateur bombers. These bombs are made from an ordinary pipe capped on both ends and generally filled with black powder.",

            "text": "All HCFs should have a written bomb threat plan. Each plan is unique to the specific facility; however, the basic steps of bomb threat programming can be categorized as follows: (1) prevention, (2) establishing authority, (3) receiving the threat, (4) searching for the bomb, (5) evacuating the building, (6) terminating the emergency, and (7) documenting the threat. Prevention. The first area of concern is the preventive steps that can be taken against a bomb situation. These steps are the same security safeguards that should be in everyday use to protect the organization against other security risks. In other words, the proper functioning of the day-to-day protection system is the first line of defense against the bomb threat. To be more specific, locking equipment rooms, switchboard rooms, utility closets, storage areas, and so forth can help reduce the problem. Limited access, access controls, noting suspicious people and vehicles, and providing emergency equipment are all part of the everyday protection system. Establishing Authority. One of the most important aspects of properly managing a bomb threat is to specifically establish organizational authority. As basic as this point seems, it is a fundamental deficiency of many healthcare organizations. Authority and responsibility for handling the initial crisis must be designated to a position that is readily available 24 hours a day. Logical choices would be the nursing supervisor, the house officer, or the security shift supervisor. The various field resources brought into play during this type of emergency must know to whom they must report the information, and answers to questions must be immediately rendered. It may be necessary to activate the ICS to properly manage the bomb threat situation. Receiving the Threat. The bomb threat can be received in numerous ways. The most common method is by telephone, and the most common recipient of such information is the switchboard operator. Telephone operators and others who are likely to receive these calls should be trained to keep the caller talking as long as possible and to ask key questions, such as where the bomb is, when it will go off, why it was placed, what kind of bomb it is, and other questions that may keep the caller on the line. The person who receives the call should make notes or activate a recording device. Not all threats indicate that a bomb has been placed somewhere in the facility. The threat may indicate a bomb \"will be\" placed in the facility. When this type of threat is received, access controls must be expanded and the organization may decide to examine property being brought into the facility. Searching for the Bomb. The bomb threat information received must be communicated to the designated authority within the organization, who in turn initiates the notification system. The first step in the notification procedure must always be to notify the appropriate law enforcement authority. In most cases, the law enforcement authority and facility management will decide jointly the type and extent of search required. It is not practical or possible to conduct an all-out search in every case, which includes everything from checking every patient's belongings to removing all suspended ceiling tiles and all ventilation grille work. It could take at least a day or two to completely search a facility. It is presumed that people who carry bombs are well aware of the danger of premature detonation, and therefore in most cases they will want to get into the facility quickly and to get out even more quickly, which generally precludes an elaborate hiding process. If sufficient organizational personnel are available, the search should be conducted by staff rather than by the police or fire department. The proper role of the outside support agencies is to assume control if a bomb or suspected bomb is located. Employees should conduct the search for two basic reasons. First, staff are in the best position to know what belongs and what does not belong to a given area. Staff are more knowledgeable of the layout of the facility and have the capability to enter locked or controlled areas or know how to obtain access.",

Patients do not welcome a police officer, or a security officer, searching their room at 2:00 a.m. The search can be emotionally upsetting, and the reaction could very easily be panic. Many experts believe that bomb threat callers are frequently interested in stirring up as much activity and causing as much disruption as possible. Thus, one objective of a bomb search is to carry out the search in a smooth, routine manner, while taking every threat seriously. In bomb threat situations, the administrative person handling the threat may decide to advise only selected staff and patients. In general, patients should not be told of the problem unless absolutely necessary. Experience has shown that patients often set off a chain reaction that is detrimental to the entire process. Patients may respond by calling their families. In turn, the family may decide to come to the facility or call the facility for detailed information. This reaction can tie up needed communications lines and hinder response capabilities.",

            "text": "Whether a search is full or partial, areas of responsibility must be assigned. In some plans, the search personnel are assembled as a group so that the search coordinator can relate to them the information received and assign specific areas to specific personnel. In other plans, this information is communicated by telephone or through a public address system with a code term such as \"Mr. Search\" or \"Code Green,\" or via electronic means. A problem that must be taken into consideration is the staffing pattern of the facility. When all departments are fully operational, the facility can be more easily and quickly searched than when departments are closed and locked. During the nonoperational period, security, maintenance, and environmental services personnel may be assigned an expanded role in the search effort. Floor plans that have been divided into specific search areas are used in some facilities. Personnel are given a map of the area for which they are responsible. In other organizations, these assignments are made from an administrative checklist that defines the areas. However the parameters of the search are defined, the person responsible for searching a given area must always report back to the control center when the search has been completed. The primary concern is for personal safety rather than property. Thus, a threat at 11:30 p.m., when minimal staff is on duty, may preclude searching all areas. It may be that closed areas such as food service, business and accounting areas, administrative offices, maintenance shops, medical record areas, and so forth receive only cursory examination. The occupied areas of the facility should be searched more thoroughly. Some controversy exists over the use of twoway radios during a bomb search. It has been suggested that radios should not be used because a bomb might be constructed to detonate in response to the transmission of radio signals. However, most experts believe that this possibility is extremely remote. In almost all situations, the radio system is active before the bomb threat was received and would have already detonated the device. The benefits of two-way radios during emergency operations support their use unless specific information is received to the contrary. Evacuating the Building. If the search produces a bomb or a suspected bomb, the cooperative efforts of security and public safety agencies come into play. Facility employees should never touch a suspected bomb. The investigation and removal of any suspect object is the responsibility of the public safety agency. Security's basic function is to seal off the area and to commence evacuation if necessary. The decision to evacuate rests with the facility administrative authority working in cooperation with the public safety agency involved. The evacuation of employees from a given work area presents no serious problems. Any plan for evacuating patients, however, must take into consideration the magnitude of the problems involved in moving the helpless and the seriously ill and the medical complications that may result. The extent of the evacuation is another decision that must be made quickly, based on the specific situation. A safe distance for evacuation is generally considered to be a 200 foot radius from the suspected object, including the floors immediately above and below.",

All people who were notified of the receipt of the threat should also be officially informed that the organization is resuming normal operations. In other words, the activity generated by the threat should not simply be allowed to trail off. After the threat is over, environmental services, maintenance, and security departments should brief the next shift of employees in their respective departments. In the normal course of their activities, these employees may observe something of importance that was overlooked during the earlier official search. Documenting the Threat. The last step in bomb threat procedure is to document the incident for future reference. This task is usually assumed by the security or safety department. Regardless of who prepares the documentation, it is the responsibility of the person in charge of the threat incident to make certain that this important task is completed. The security report generally focuses on recording the facts of the situation. An additional administrative report that critiques the bomb threat response may be appropriate. The analysis may reveal deficiencies that require plan modification or further employee education.",

            "text": "A real test of a facility's protection plan comes when the facility faces a strike or picketing situation. A strike occurs when some of the organization's employees, commonly represented by one or more unions, refuse to work as a protest against a serious grievance or a failure to negotiate a mutually acceptable contract. Picketing refers to the placement of people around the exterior of the facility for the dual purposes of informing the public of alleged problems and curtailing deliveries of supplies and equipment. The primary purpose of a strike is to create hardships for the organizations, weaken their bargaining position, and resolve the dispute in favor of the protesters. The hardships may include disruption of patient care, intimidation of nonstriking staff, loss of revenue, damaged or stolen property, negative community reaction toward the facility, and injury to persons. An organization need not be unionized to become the focus of a picket line. Picketing may be set up as a result of a strike or for the purpose of attempting to force the organization to recognize a collective bargaining unit. The immediate effect of a picket line is that union drivers may refuse to cross the line to make deliveries. In the initial stages, nonunion drivers will often cross the picket line until threats are made or physical violence occurs.",

            "text": "Control Team and Strike Action Committee. During a strike, an organization must have a unified command structure. The organization's chain of command dictates the position that will be responsible for strike control operations. The strike control team should operate out of a strike incident command center so that all employees and outside support groups know where to deliver information or seek direction. A strike action committee should be formed by the head of strike operations to represent the various operating units of the facility and to function primarily in the prestrike preparation phases. Once a strike is underway, the committee will rarely be needed; however, it may meet periodically as a communication tool to keep operating units advised of the situation. Nonstriking Employees. The nonstriking employees are the basic resource for continuing patient care and ensuring a successful conclusion to the labor action. It is extremely important that the administration support nonstriking employees in every way possible. On the day the strike begins, all nonstriking employees should attend a briefing meeting designed to update employees on logistical matters, exhibit the administration's support and appreciation of the staff, and reassure employees. The employees should be told to expect harassing telephone calls. These calls generally threaten not only the employees, but also their families if the employees return to work. It may be difficult for administration to talk about this situation because administration generally wants to avoid negative issues. However, forewarning employees can mitigate the initial shock of these types of threats. Nonstriking employees are also vitally concerned about the protection of their vehicles while they are at work. Because experience has shown that vehicles are a major target of strikers, this concern is certainly valid. High priority must be given to this protection responsibility. Initial Stages of the Strike. The first day or two of the typical healthcare-related strike is generally peaceful and uneventful. The strikers are in a fairly good mood and enjoy talking with one another. The greatest number of picketers is on hand in the early stages of a strike, except for major rally events when the union tries to show a high degree of support. Inside the facility, the staff's initial reaction is enthusiastic support for the organization. As the strike continues, both picketers and staff will exhibit frustration, disappointment, and exhaustion. After a few days, when the facility seems to be functioning well, the strikers begin to wonder whether efforts are meeting objectives. Their reaction may be to step up harassment. Incidents of intimidation, property damage, and other problems sometimes begin to appear. Another tactic that may occur and will affect the facility is a secondary boycott by suppliers and vendors. This illegal activity usually occurs much later in the strike, but it should be anticipated during early planning. Picket Lines. A major purpose of the picket line is to discourage employees from crossing the line to report to work. When the picketers see that employees are not being sufficiently discouraged and do cross the line to work, confrontations sometimes begin to take place. It is at this point that threats and acts of violence often occur. Administrators and supervisory personnel should be on the grounds during shift changes to support arriving personnel and to observe any incidents that might occur. Employees arriving to work are encouraged when they see the upper echelon there to support them rather than sitting safely behind their desks. Most healthcare facilities have a built-in security vulnerability that can become an asset during picket activities: a multitude of entrances and exits. For the duration of the strike or picketing, as many of these access points as possible should be open for employee use. The more entrances that are available, the more difficult it becomes for the picketers to cover them all. The law states that picket lines shall not restrict the right of people to enter and leave the facility. Despite this provision, thousands of incidents on record involve injury to people and destruction of property during picketing. In coping with this situation, it is a common mistake to assume that law enforcement agencies will maintain law and order. Unfortunately, for a variety of reasons, police protection is not always at its best at such times. The healthcare organization has a responsibility to provide for personal safety and to protect its assets. The security department will necessarily play a strong role in achieving this objective. Several days before the strike, there should be a thorough inspection of the exterior of the facility to remove signs and other items that could be easily vandalized. One item often overlooked is sprinkler headsa favorite target for picketers. Security personnel are generally deployed at the site of the picket line to show nonstriking employees and others who cross the line a high degree of protective support. Security's additional responsibility is to ensure that picketers stay off facility property, to prevent accidents, and to document evidence of wrongdoing. It is recommended that security personnel assigned to the strike detail be unarmed. A security objective is to be present but to project a fairly low profile, indicating that no trouble is expected. The type of trouble that might occur will not be deterred or corrected with the threat or use of a firearm. Security officers should be briefed by the administration and legal counsel just before they are deployed to the picket line. The basic message this briefing should convey is that officers must be professional. They must keep their eyes and ears open and their mouths closed. The officers should be reminded that they are representatives of the organization, regardless of their personal feelings about the situation. Record Keeping. A step that must be initiated immediately when a strike or picket situation develops is to establish a strike control center. A major administrative mistake is to assume that the confrontation will not last long. This assumption makes it easy to ignore the central reporting and its record-keeping role until the organization is well into a prolonged strike. All information concerning activities and incidents related to the labor action should be reported immediately to the designated recording location. All supervisory employees should be given the responsibility of reporting all incidents brought to their attention. A chronological record of incidents, including complete details, serves a variety of purposes, not the least of which is collecting the data necessary for legal actions. A consolidated central reporting concept will also serve as a clearinghouse to verify or reject rumors and to readily assess the situation. An important tool in dealing with and documenting strikes and picketing -and one that relates very closely to the incident recording function -is the use of photography. The task of photographing the labor action should be an assigned responsibility. Because camera equipment is often antagonizing to picketers, it should be used in such a manner that a minimum of confrontation occurs. The organization's response to the labor action may require the unexpected expenditure of funds. Special arrangements may have to be made to procure supplies, obtain drivers and vehicles, authorize meals, use taxi services, authorize overtime, and the like. During times of the strike, the customary management controls tend to be loosened. Specific guidelines must be drawn up for these unexpected expenditures, and the individuals who authorize the use of funds must keep adequate records. Maintaining Supply Lines. If it is to continue to carry out its mission, one of the first and most important steps an HCF must take during a labor action situation is to maintain a supply line. In most instances, a supply line requires the procurement of additional labor and vehicles. If vehicles are obtained from rental or leasing companies, it is usually only a matter of time before the rental agency demands the return of their vehicles. This tactic can be countered to some extent by having individuals rent vehicles from various agencies for onetime use. This procedure also proves valuable in avoiding harassment because the newly rented vehicle can be used to pick up supplies without being followed and subjected to threats, damage, or driver injury. Before picketing begins, the organization should contact all suppliers who make deliveries to the facility. The facility needs to know if nonunion or supervisory personnel will be available to make deliveries. It is better to pick up the supplies directly from the vendor or to have the order shipped to a temporary receiving site than to have confrontations between picketers and truck drivers. When truck drivers refuse to cross the line, their action supports and encourages the picketers. Because it is impossible for the facility to pick up the thousands of items it requires, particularly during a prolonged strike, off-site receiving areas can become necessary.",

Organizations should consider using a truck parked in a vacant lot or other out-of-the-way place and simply off-loading from one truck to the other. If the loaded trucks are not brought to the facility the same day, security precautions are important. One HCF involved in a severe labor action had parked three trucks overnight in an abandoned section of a railroad yard, and all three trucks were fire-bombed. The picket line not only inhibits the free flow of deliveries but also affects the removal of items, particularly trash. An institution of any size will find that a tremendous volume of refuse can build up in a very short time. It is essential that facilities move quickly to dispose of this material or they may find themselves in violation of health and fire standards.

These materials are in the form of powder (i.e., blood bank irradiator), wafers (i.e., gamma knife), and liquid (i.e., diagnostic uses). Even in limited amounts, the theft of radioactive materials from these sources is a potential threat deserving of proper security safeguards.

Hospitals had previously handled mass casualties, but the influx of casualties from rioting created new complications for protection services, including: l Confrontations between police and rioters that often continued into treatment rooms l Hostile visitors who demanded attention, disrupted activity, and destroyed property to obtain their objective l Direct attacks on the facility, including firebombs and in one case a siege of gunfire In short, HCFs ceased to be the neutral ground they had been in the past. During the 1970s, few, if any, civil disturbances involved hospital operations. In mid-1980, heavy rioting hit Miami, Florida. One hospital, Jackson Memorial Medical Center, was under siege for a few days as rioters burned and looted just outside the hospital's perimeter. Security professionals learned three things from these riots. First, police and fire protection services may not be available as assumed or even as promised. Many facilities suffered extensive damage and disruption because the municipal protection services were stretched so thin that adequate protection could not be furnished. Every protection plan should therefore be predicated on the assumption that no external help will be available. Second, employees may be sympathetic to the rioters and their cause. Employee sympathy may be manifested in the theft of drugs and supplies for use at first aid stations set up by the rioters, or employees on duty may create disturbances within the facility in support of the rioters' cause. For example, a wastebasket fire was set in a stairwell in one reported case. Although no real damage resulted, the smoke created confusion and panic among patients and staff. Third, separate treatment areas for rioters and the public may be needed to minimize continuing confrontation. External Protection Planning. Preparations for minimizing damage to the facility and safely moving employees cannot be made at the last minute. Thus, the first step in riot protection planning is to survey the perimeter of the property. For example, this might be the time to recommend fencing the north property line to divert foot traffic from crossing through parking areas. Security administrators should also consider whether exterior lighting is adequately protected to minimize destruction, whether landscaping decorations or other external items should be removed, and how employee vehicles should be protected. The next step is to carefully survey the exterior of the buildings that will require protection. Access doors and windows are of primary concern. Even though normal access points cannot be eliminated during normal operations, administrators must be prepared to quickly authorize restricted access when a riot hits. The time to make certain that doors are equipped with the proper hardware is before a riot occurs. Security administrators should select the access point that could be controlled best if only one entrance were to be operative. The best entrance is not necessarily the most accessible one. If the facility has an emergency department, two access points are generally required: one for persons seeking medical care and another for everyone else. Windows and other glass areas are primary targets for destruction. Break-resistant glazing material is commonly used for protection. Another method is to precut plywood and install brackets on the window frames to permit easy and quick installation. If no glass protection has been installed or if the protection is minimal, interior blinds or curtains should be closed. If beds are near a window, they should be moved as far from the window as possible. Exterior lighting must be reviewed to determine whether the illumination is adequate. More light is needed during rioting than is needed under normal conditions. Security administrators should also check to determine whether light fixtures can be modified to prevent damage. Generally, little can be done in this regard, but making certain that lights are not within easy reach is at least one step that can be taken. Internal Protection Planning. The interior of the facility should be reviewed to identify critical areas that need additional protection. This additional security may be in the form of hardware, or it may require establishing a security post. Areas of obvious concern are electrical distribution vaults, emergency power areas, equipment rooms (including elevator penthouses), oxygen and medical gas systems, emergency exits, traffic control, and surveillance areas. Organizations should seriously consider placing operators on all elevators. By manually controlling elevators, traffic can be controlled more readily, and in a sense the elevator operators provide an element of security. If emergency security posts are necessary, every possible post location should be given an activation priority so that as emergency conditions develop, the posts can be activated in a logical priority. The protection level will expand and contract during a civil disturbance crisis according to the threat at hand. Fire extinguishers and communications equipments are essential for every post; access lists and special equipment may be needed at particular posts. Planning may indicate that a reasonable approach to providing communications at every post is to install telephone jacks at each location or the use of cellular telephones. Most facilities do not have enough two-way radio equipment available for a significant protection posture; however, this situation is improving with considerable grant money.",

Consensus seems to be that the most practical approach would be to limit the number of standard codes to no more than five codes using color designators.

This approach worked well and was reported to be widely accepted by law enforcement personnel. When police lines are established, altered travel routes are an obvious course of action. When police lines surround the facility, some procedure must be devised for staff access. Staff identification cards or badges are one solution. Another approach may be for a facility representative to be stationed at a central point along the police line to verify employee status. Individuals who attempt to cross the police line can be identified with simple questions about their department, employee number, birth date, or other data. The facility representative will be able to verify many employees by sight. During a civil disturbance, organizations may encourage employees to stay on the premises for their own safety and for the purpose of maintaining adequate staff. Employees sometimes insist on staying regardless of the official stance, and thus some planning for employee housing is mandated. An inventory of beds that can be used in an emergency should be maintained. A thorough review of a facility often uncovers more beds than expected. Beds can sometimes be found in classrooms, blood banks, on-call rooms, and electrocardiogram and electroencephalogram areas. In addition, cots can be set up in many areas for temporary accommodations. To ensure the utilization of all beds and to keep a record of where employees are housed, assignments must be made by a designated facility representative. Employees should not be allowed to assume their own accommodations even in their own departments. When more employees request accommodations than are needed to work, a system of housing authorization by department heads may be necessary to maintain adequate control. There will of course be additional administrative and operational issues to be defined and addressed by individual healthcare provider organizations.",

This chapter, which was written primarily for the healthcare industry, applies to all of us in security management, as the principals and concepts are basically the same. Crisis Management comes in many forms and we must be ready and prepared for it. It may include the identification of operational resources and assignments. It may also include attachments that provide direction and important information for management of the incident during one or more operational periods. incident base Location at the incident where the primary logistics functions are coordinated and administered. (Incident name or other designator will be added to the term Base). The Incident Command Post may be collocated with the Base. There is only one Base per incident. incident command post (ICP) The field location at which the primary tactical-level, on-scene incident command functions is performed. The ICP may be collocated with the incident base or other incident facilities and is normally identified by a green rotating or flashing light.",

            "text": "A standardized on-scene emergency management construct specifically designed to provide for the adoption of an integrated organizational structure that reflects the complexity and demands of single or multiple incidents without being hindered by jurisdictional boundaries. ICS is the combination of facilities, equipment, personnel, procedures, and communications operating within a common organizational structure, designed to aid in the management of resources during incidents. It is used for all kinds of emergencies and is applicable to small as well as large and complex incidents. ICS is used by various jurisdictions and functional agencies, both public and private, to organize field-level incident management operations. incident commander (IC) The individual responsible for all incident activities, including the development of strategies and tactics and the ordering and the release of resources. The IC has overall authority and responsibility for conducting incident operations and is responsible for the management of all incident operations at the incident site. incident objectives Statements of guidance and direction necessary for the selection of appropriate strategy(ies) and the tactical direction of resources. Incident objectives are based on realistic expectations of what can be accomplished when all allocated resources have been effectively deployed. Incident objectives must be achievable and measurable, yet flexible enough to allow for strategic and tactical alternatives. jurisdiction A range or sphere of authority. Public agencies have jurisdiction at an incident related to their legal responsibilities and authority. Jurisdictional authority at an incident can be political or geographical (e.g., city, county, tribal, state, or federal boundary lines) or functional (e.g., law enforcement, public health). management by objective A management approach that involves a four-step process for achieving the incident goal. The management by objectives approach includes the following: establishing overarching objectives; developing and issuing assignments, plans, procedures, and protocols; establishing specific, measurable objectives for various incident management functional activities and directing efforts to fulfill them, in support of defined strategic objectives; and documenting results to measure performance and facilitate corrective action. mitigation The activities designed to reduce or eliminate risks to persons or property or to lessen the actual or potential effects or consequences of an incident. Mitigation measures may be implemented prior to, during, or after an incident, and they are often formed by lessons learned from prior incidents. Mitigation involves ongoing actions to reduce exposure to, probability of, or potential loss from hazards. Measures may include zoning and building codes, floodplain buyouts, and analysis of hazardrelated data to determine where it is safe to build or locate temporary facilities. Mitigation can include efforts to educate governments, businesses, and the public on measures they can take to reduce loss and injury. multiagency coordination systems (MACS) Multiagency coordination systems provide the architecture to support coordination for incident prioritization, critical resource allocation, communications systems integration, and information coordination. The components of multiagency coordination systems include facilities, equipment, emergency operations centers (EOCs), specific multiagency coordination entities, personnel, procedures, and communications. These systems assist agencies and organizations to fully integrate the subsystems of the NIMS. preparedness The range of deliberate, critical tasks and activities necessary to build, sustain, and improve the operational capability to prevent, protect against, respond to, and recover from domestic incidents. Preparedness is a continuous process. Preparedness involves efforts at all levels of government and between government and privatesector and nongovernmental organizations to identify threats, determine vulnerabilities, and identify required resources. Within the NIMS, preparedness is operationally focused on establishing guidelines, protocols, and standards for planning, training and exercises, personnel qualification and certification, equipment certification, and publication management. preparedness organizations The groups that provide interagency coordination for domestic incident management activities in a nonemergency context. Preparedness organizations can include all agencies with a role in incident management, for prevention, preparedness, response, or recovery activities. They represent a wide variety of committees, planning groups, and other organizations that meet and coordinate to ensure the proper level of planning, training, equipping, and other preparedness requirements within a jurisdiction or area. prevention Actions to avoid an incident or to intervene to stop an incident from occurring. Prevention involves actions to protect lives and property. It involves applying intelligence and other information to a range of activities that may include such countermeasures as deterrence operations; heightened inspections; improved surveillance and security operations; investigations to determine the full nature and source of the threat; public health and agricultural surveillance and testing processes; immunizations, isolation, or quarantine; and, as appropriate, specific law enforcement operations aimed at deterring, preempting, interdicting, or disrupting illegal activity and apprehending potential perpetrators and bringing them to justice. recovery The development, coordination, and execution of service-and site-restoration plans; the reconstitution of government operations and services; individual, privatesector, nongovernmental, and public-assistance programs to provide housing and to promote restoration; long-term care and treatment of affected persons; additional measures for social, political, environmental, and economic restoration; evaluation of the incident to identify lessons learned; post incident reporting; and development of initiatives to mitigate the effects of future incidents. span of control The number of individuals a supervisor is responsible for, usually expressed as the ratio of supervisors to individuals. (Under the NIMS, an appropriate span of control is between 1:3 and 1:7.) unity of command The concept by which each person within an organization reports to one and only one designated person. The purpose of unity of command is to ensure unity of effort under one responsible commander for every objective.",
