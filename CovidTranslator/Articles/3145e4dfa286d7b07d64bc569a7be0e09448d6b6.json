            "text": "Molecular diagnosis of malaria by nucleotide amplification requires sophisticated and expensive instruments, typically found only in well-established laboratories. Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) has provided a new platform for an easily adaptable molecular technique for molecular diagnosis of malaria without the use of expensive instruments. A new primer set has been designed targeting the 18S rRNA gene for the detection of Plasmodium falciparum in whole blood samples. The efficacy of LAMP using the new primer set was assessed in this study in comparison to that of a previously described set of LAMP primers as well as with microscopy and real-time PCR as reference methods for detecting P. falciparum. Pre-addition of hydroxy napthol blue (HNB) in the LAMP reaction caused a distinct color change, thereby improving the visual detection system. The new LAMP assay was found to be 99.1% sensitive compared to microscopy and 98.1% when compared to real-time PCR. Meanwhile, its specificity was 99% and 100% in contrast to microscopy and real-time PCR, respectively. Moreover, the LAMP method was in very good agreement with microscopy and real-time PCR (0.94 and 0.98, respectively). This new LAMP method can detect at least 5 parasites/L of infected blood within 35 min, while the other LAMP method tested in this study, could detect a minimum of 100 parasites/L of human blood after 60 min of amplification. Thus, the new method is sensitive and specific, can be carried out in a very short time, and can substitute PCR in healthcare clinics and standard laboratories.",

However, its sensitivity and specificity is limited at about 80-90%, even in the best of settings (Reyburn et al., 2006) . Because of the limitations of microscopy, rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) were implemented for malaria diagnosis in healthcare and research. Despite their significant contribution in the diagnosis of malaria because of the ease with which they can be performed, RDTs have several limitations, such as cross-reactivity with heterophile antibodies and rheumatoid factors, false positivity due to a previous infection, and decreased sensitivity in some instances, especially in the case of lower parasite densities (Wongsrichanalai et al., 2007) . On the other hand, genetic diversity and deletion of histidine rich protein 2 (HRP2) can lead to false-negative diagnosis, especially in Peruvian cases of Plasmodium falciparum, which lack HRP2 and HRP3 (Baker et al., 2005; Gamboa et al., 2010) .

(2000) described a novel DNA amplification method named loop mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP). In this method, a specific fragment of DNA can be amplified in heat block without a thermal cycler, which can be too expensive for PCR application in the field. Four specially designed primers and two additional loop forming primers amplify the target DNA with a large fragment of Bst polymerase, which has exclusive strand displacement activity in the LAMP method. Immense amplification leads to accumulation of magnesium pyrophosphate, which turns the solution turbid; this turbidity is visible to the naked eye or can be measured with a turbidity meter (Notomi et al., 2000) .",

            "text": "Despite these developments, visual detection of the LAMP product requires practical skill, and individual variation occurs in detecting positive reactions, especially in the setting of lower copy numbers of template DNA (Goto et al., 2009) . Furthermore, a turbidity meter or fluorescent reader or portable fluorescence reader increases the cost and the number of instruments required. Postaddition of SYBR Green requires opening of the reaction tubes, which may lead to severe contamination in the laboratory, whereas pre-addition to the reaction mixture inhibits the amplification reactions. Pre-addition of Calcein with MnCl 2 can surmount the problem of contamination, but it does not lead to significant development in the visual system (Goto et al., 2009) . Moreover, cost is a big constraint in using SYBR Green and Calcein in LAMP visualization. Goto et al. (2009) introduced the concept of pre-addition of hydroxy naphthol blue (HNB), a cheap and easily visible dye in the reaction mixture, that does not inhibit the amplification. Massive amplification produces a pyro-phosphate by-product that precipitates with Mg 2+ ion in the solution. In this process, HNB, the magnesium-chelating dye, loses its bound magnesium to provide magnesium to pyrophosphate, which has stronger affinity to magnesium than HNB. Consequently, absorption and emission spectra of the HNB complex are altered. Eventually, the color of the reaction mixture changes from violet to sky blue. Moreover, HNB provides a detection threshold similar to that provided by SYBR Green (Goto et al., 2009) . Consequently, several LAMP-based methods were developed using HNB for the diagnosis of various targets such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, coronavirus, trypansomes, and influenza H1N1 (Cardoso et al., 2010; Grab et al., 2011; Hong et al., 2012; Ma et al., 2010) .",

This method is very robust, and rare mutations do not affect its efficacy unless they occur in the extreme ends of the primer-binding sites (Notomi et al., 2000) . Poon et al. (2006) described 95% sensitivity and 99% specificity in regard to PCR in their first implementation of LAMP in malaria. The same primer set was replicated in the genus-and species-specific LAMP described by Han et al. (2007) , where all of the 12 microscopy and PCR-positive P. falciparum samples were successfully detected by LAMP. Poschl et al. (2010) described 100% sensitivity and specificity of LAMP compared to nested PCR using the same primer set and reaction conditions. Lucchi et al. (2010) have also utilized the same primer set in real-time fluorescence LAMP with portable fluorescence reader, with 98.8% sensitivity and 100% specificity, while Paris et al. (2007) described 73.1% sensitivity compared to microscopy using the same primer set with 100% specificity. In this study, the primer set described by Poon et al. (2006) has failed to detect five real-time PCR-positive samples despite the preaddition of HNB for easy visual detection, while four of the samples were positive by microscopy also. Three of these four samples had parasitemia of 16 parasites/L. However, one sample was found positive only when real-time PCR crossed the detection threshold in its last cycle. This study also confirmed that the primer set described by Poon et al. (2006) can detect a minimum of 100 parasites/L. Thus, it is an inherent limitation of Poon et al.'s (2006) primer set that it would miss those four samples. However, this set also failed to detect one P. falciparum positive sample of 25,000 parasites/L. Any significant mutation in the extremes of the primer-binding site as discussed earlier might contribute to this phenomenon. On the other hand, the fact that one negative sample was a false-positive for P. falciparum using this primer set may be due to rare crossreactivity of the primers. Both of these discordant events were not confirmed by sequence analysis in this study. The factors discussed here might also contribute to such variations in outcome of the same primer set in the different studies mentioned above.",

This primer set can efficiently bind with three copies of 18S rRNA genes residual of at least three different chromosomes of the same parasite (NCBI BLAST request ID: DD77A3ZC0R, DD7KBG8J016, DD80J0X6013). Since this primer set can detect 5 parasites/L, it requires approximately 15 copies of template to obtain significant visible amplification. However, Notomi et al. (2000) , in their initial design, mentioned that the LAMP method can conduct visible amplification from six copies of template within 45 min when primer designing and reaction conditions are perfectly optimized. This primer set have failed to detect two of the real-time PCR-positive samples when one of them was microscopically positive with a low parasitemia (16 parasites/L). These Table 3 Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) of LAMP methods in comparison with microscopy and real-time PCR. real-time PCR-positive samples had high threshold values and low relative fluorescence unit (RFU) . Both the samples also tested negative by the LAMP method of Poon et al. (2006) . Despite this minor incongruity in sensitivity, the new primer set was 100% successful in avoiding false-positive diagnosis due to cross-reactivity. Yamamura et al. (2009) designed another 18S rRNA-based primer set for P. falciparum detection, which can detect 10 copies of plasmid DNA after 80 min of amplification. This method was determined to be 97.8% sensitive and 85.7% specific. However, cross-reactions of the primers with P. vivax and other undefined targets were ignored by melt curve analysis. This method also required sophisticated instruments like Genopattern Analyzer GP1000, which limits its wide application (Yamamura et al., 2009) .",

Recently, a commercial Pan/Pf LAMP assay was developed and evaluated in two different settings (Hopkins et al., 2013; Polley et al., 2013) . Both of these studies reported highly sensitive detection of malaria cases but one study (Hopkins et al., 2013) reported compromised specificity and NPV when implemented in field, which is due to the detection of a high number of false-positive samples. The kit used expensive Calcein or turbidity meter. Calcein fluorescence has some drawbacks also, such as lower detection sensitivity and brightness of the fluorescence (Goto et al., 2009) .",
