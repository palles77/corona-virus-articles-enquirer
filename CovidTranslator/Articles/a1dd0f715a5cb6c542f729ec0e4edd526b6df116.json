[4] [5] [6] [7] [8] Most children with CP are of the spastic type, 9 with mild CP and at the Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) levels I and II. 10, 11 Although school age children with mild spastic CP can walk independently, their walking abilities are worse than their peers without disability, 12 and may get worse with age, 13, 14 resulting in a loss of their ability to walk. 14 Therefore, an effective intervention for children with mild CP to preserve or improve their motor ability at school age is very important.",

Therefore, according to the task-oriented approach, a functional strengthening program which is a resistance exercise with a functional movement pattern (multijoint, close-kinetic-chain), has been proposed recently and has shown effectiveness in children with CP. 15 However, the intervention program of the previous study included functional strengthening exercises as well as treadmill training and balance training. 15 It is difficult to determine the effects of functional strengthening exercises according to the results of previous study. Besides, the resistance was provided solely by body weight, 15 which may not fit in with the overload principles of the strengthening exercise. 16 One of our previous studies 17 showed the loaded sit-to-stand (STS) test was a reliable functional muscle strength test for children with CP with high test-retest reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC] , .94). The maximum load obtained from the loaded STS test is significantly correlated with lean body mass (r\u03ed.79), 18 walking velocity (r\u03ed.37), 7 Physiological Cost Index (PCI) (r\u03ed.39), 7 and gross motor function in children with CP (r\u03ed.80). 8 In the present study, the loaded STS exercise was proposed. The loaded weight during the training was determined based on the previous results from the studies of the loaded STS test. 7, 8, 17, 18 This study was designed to investigate the effectiveness of the loaded STS exercise on motor activity, muscle strength, and physiologic cost for children with mild spastic diplegia.",

The inclusion criteria of this study were as follows: (1) age between 5 and 12 years old; (2) spastic diplegia; (3) the GMFCS 10 level I or II; (4) able to stand up from a chair independently and maintain standing for more than 5 seconds without falling; (5) able to follow verbal instructions; (6) without obvious limitation in the passive range of motion of lower extremities; (7) able to attend physical therapy (PT) treatment at least once a week before and during this study while keeping up with regular treatment programs; (8) had not received any strength-training program in the past 3 months before the study; and (9) parental commitment to allow participation without altering current therapy or activity. Exclusion criteria were: (1) have orthopedic intervention, selective dorsal rhizotomy, or botulinum toxin injection to the lower extremities within 6 months; and (2) orthopedic problems or medical conditions that prevented children from participating in the exercises. Of 26 children eligible for this study, 24 participated (fig 1) .

We used the 1 repetition maximum (1-RM) of the loaded STS test to represent maximum load of the loaded STS test and was defined as the maximal load a child is capable of carrying while standing up 1 time without falling from a sitting position. 17 The standardized loaded STS test has high test-retest 17 and interrater reliability (ICC\u03ed.94) 7 for children with spastic diplegia. The testing procedures of the loaded STS test are described as follows. At the beginning, participants did general warm-up exercises for 5 minutes. Then the tester demonstrated STS movements. Chair height has been identified as 1 factor to influence STS performance in children with CP. 25 Therefore, the starting position of each child was standardized with hip flexion at 90\u00b0, knee flexion at 105\u00b0(full extension was defined as 0\u00b0), feet parallel, ankle dorsiflexion at 15\u00b0, trunk erect, and hands on waist or crossing the chest. During testing, the child was asked to stand up 2 times at a comfortable speed and with symmetrical hip strategy to the defined standing position, which required the child's trunk and lower extremities being fully extended. The hip strategy of the STS is that the child flexes his/her hip and moves the trunk forward until the shoulder is above the knee joint, and then the child stands up. The child was asked to sit down after standing for 2 seconds. The instruction was \"Stand up without moving your feet and waving your arms at your comfortable speed, hold this standing position for 2 seconds, and then sit down slowly. No falling. If you try but cannot stand up, just let us know. It is OK.\" Subsequent to tester's demonstration, the child practiced STS 3 to 4 times from light load to moderate load at a comfortable speed. During the loaded STS test, the weights were added into the body vest initially at a load equaling 30% of the body weight of the subject being tested. Based on the ease of performing STS movements, the following trial's load (increase or decrease by 0.5 to 4kg each trial) was determined. All children took a break of at least 2 minutes between test trials. The weight that the child could carry in the body vest and stand up only once was defined as the 1-RM STS of that child. The data were discarded if subjects were: (1) losing balance; (2) standing up with an obviously asymmetrical posture during test; (3) unable to maintain a standing position for 2 seconds after standing; (4) swaying their trunk back and forth several times to initiate the task of standing up; or (5) sitting down abruptly without good control. The interrater reliability of the loaded STS test for the tester was established before the beginning of the research (ICC\u03ed.94). 7 Physiological Cost Index. We used the PCI to measure physiologic cost, calculated as the difference between the resting heart rate and walking heart rate and divided by the walking speed. The test-retest reliabilities (ICC range, .81\u03ea.94) and interrater reliability (ICC\u03ed.73) of PCI were high for children with CP. 4, 7, 26 Concerning concurrent validity, Bowen et al 27 found a moderate correlation coefficient of .50 between the PCI and oxygen cost. After a practice trial of walking at a selfselected free speed, each subject was asked to walk down a semicircular pathway, with a 15-m linear walkway, for 7 minutes after these verbal directions: \"I'd like you to walk in the way you would normally do, all the way along the pathway without stopping till I ask you to stop.\" The walking heart rate was defined as the average of the heart rate data collected during the last 4 minutes of walking with a constant walking speed. The higher the PCI, the higher the energy consumption required during walking. 12",

The present study design was similar to Dodd's study. Both studies were randomized clinical trials and home-based functional muscle strengthening programs for 6 weeks for children with spastic diplegia CP. However, the present study recruited younger children with milder CP than did Dodd's study.

This functional strengthening program was highly effective in comparison to other strengthening programs because of the 4 main features of successful strengthening proposed by exercise specialistsspecificity, intensity (overload), frequency, and volume, 17, 36, 37 which were all well defined in this study. The issue of specificity was mentioned before. The variables of intensity included the load of resistance, repetition number per set, and the number of sets per session. In this study, the resisted load progressively increased every 2 weeks. The resisted load of 50% of 1-RM STS was chosen due to the fact that highrepetition moderate-load strength training was better than the low-repetition heavy-load in children. 38, 39 For training frequency of resisted exercise, 2 days per week, 3 to 4 sets per session could effectively increase the muscle strength in children aged 8 to 12 years. 36, 40 The present study showed that after training the GMFM goal scores significantly increased with an effect size of 1.17. After inspecting the raw data of the GMFM goal dimensions for every child of both groups, we found that the items that showed improvement after training in most children of the experimental group were activities related to jumping. Jumping is the fundamental movement that occurs when the body is projected into the air by the force generated in the extensor muscles of the lower legs and the body lands with flexed lower legs and an adjustment of the center of gravity of the whole body. 41 Therefore, it requires both the high muscle strength of the lower legs and the balance control that the loaded STS exercise may be able to promote.",

            "text": "The present study showed that the loaded STS exercise could not significantly improve the gait speed and knee extensor strength when compared with the control group. The effects of the muscle strengthening program on the walking speed were controversial in the previous studies. 5,6,31 Buchner et al 42 proposed a theory that there was a curvilinear relationship between gait speed and muscle strength. The benefit of a muscle strengthening program on gait speed depends on the target group. Only those whose muscle strength was less than the demand of the walking task can have benefits from the strengthening program. The children in the present study had mild CP, and their muscle weakness problem may not have been severe enough to impair the gait speed. Therefore, the gait speed did not improve significantly after the loaded STS exercise. The loaded STS exercise is an isotonic contraction, but the maximum knee extensor strength was tested by isometric contraction in this study. Specificity of the strengthening program may be able to explain the ineffectiveness of the loaded STS exercise on the knee extensor strength. The isotonic muscle strengthening of knee extensors increased mainly the isotonic muscle strength. 43 The possible adverse effects of the loaded STS exercise were similar to that reported by McBurney et al, 34 such as equipment, parental psychologic and physical assistance, and the need of 20 to 30 minutes of spare time to finish this home exercise program. Most children (80%) reported pressure on the shoulders from the body vest during the loaded STS exercise; however, no pain or injury was reported due to the training. In the present study, the withdrawn children were older than the participant children. The heavier homework load at the senior class of the elementary school may be one of the reasons to cause the interruption of a follow-up or intervention program. However, the age of the children did not significantly correlate with the home-exercise frequency and scores of the outcome measures and the motor severities of the withdrawn children were similar to the participant children. Therefore, the results of this study might be generalized to the children with mild spastic CP.",

Therefore, the favorable results in the experimental group could not be explained by this attribute. Second, the duration of the follow-up was not sufficient. The immediate effect was positive. It would be interesting to see if the positive effects observed in this study are maintained longitudinally.

The loaded STS exercise program had high compliance and could be implemented by parents at home with simple equipment (body vest, weights, and chair of appropriate height) and with regular follow-ups by clinicians (1 time/2wk). Further studies are needed to develop effectiveness of the loaded STS exercise for children with different severities of CP.",
