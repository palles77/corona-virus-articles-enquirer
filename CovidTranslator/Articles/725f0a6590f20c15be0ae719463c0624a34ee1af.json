There is growing evidence that chemokines play an important role in tumorigenesis [7] [8] [9] . Cxc Chemokine Ligand 5 (CXCL5) presents a surprisingly elevated profile in bladder cancer cells, tissue, and urine of bladder cancer patients, and CXCL5 overexpression is critical for bladder cancer growth and progression [10] . CXCL5, by binding to its cell-surface receptor Cxc Chemokine Receptor 2 (CXCR2), plays an oncogenic role in many human cancers. The serum protein expression of CXCL5 is significantly increased in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) compared with that in healthy volunteers [11] . The expression of CXCL5 was significantly higher in lung cancer cell lines, and high CXCL5 was associated with high CXCR2 expression, which was significantly associated with poor differentiation [12] . CXCL5/CXCR2 performs its roles in angiogenesis, immune response, and tumor progression [13, 14] . CXCL5 is an inflammatory chemokine, which is a member of the same family as CXCL10 [15] . CXCL10 can promote the development of inflammation in ARDS [16] . However, the role of CXCL5 in ARDS and its associated mechanisms are still unknown, as is whether it participates in the inflammatory process of ARDS by binding to its receptor CXCR2.",
