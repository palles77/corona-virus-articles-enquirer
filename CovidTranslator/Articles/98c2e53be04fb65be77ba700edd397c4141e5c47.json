            "text": "Background and Aims: Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a virulent viral infection that affects a number of organs and systems. This study examined if SARS may result in cardiovascular complications. Methods and Results: 121 patients (37.5 (SD13.2) years, 36% male) diagnosed to have SARS were assessed continuously for blood pressure, pulse, and temperature during their stay in hopsital. Hypotension occurred in 61 (50.4%) patients in hospital, and was found in 28.1%, 21.5%, and 14.8% of patients during the first, second, and third week, respectively. Only one patient who had transient echocardiographic evidence of impaired left ventricular systolic function required temporary inotropic support. Tachycardia was present in 87 (71.9%) patients, and was found in 62.8%, 45.4%, and 35.5% of patients from the first to third week. It occurred independent of hypotension, and could not be explained by the presence of fever. Tachycardia was also present in 38.8% of patients at follow up. Bradycardia only occurred in 18 (14.9%) patients as a transient event. Reversible cardiomegaly was reported in 13 (10.7%) patients, but without clinical evidence of heart failure. Transient atrial fibrillation was present in one patient. Corticosteroid therapy was weakly associated with tachycardia during the second (x 2 = 3.99, p = 0.046) and third week (x 2 = 6.53, p = 0.01), although it could not explain tachycardia during follow up.",

[1] [2] [3] This infection is caused by a new strain of virus under the coronavirus family. [4] [5] [6] In the year 2003, 8098 patients were infected with SARS, and 774 patients died, 7 with a potential of disease recurrence. 8 9 SARS is a contagious disease that affects multiple organs of the body, and reported complications including pneumonia, lymphopenia, coagulopathy, myositis, as well as derangement of renal and liver functions. 10 11 Whether SARS may result in cardiovascular complications has not been examined systemically. In rabbits, coronavirus infection had been shown to affect the heart resulting in acute and even chronic heart failure, 12 which could be related to human strain of coronavirus. 13 Although major cardiovascular complications after non-SARS strains of coronavirus has not been reported in humans, the clinical behaviour of coronavirus that causes SARS is far more virulent than other strains that infect humans. Therefore, this study examined whether SARS would result in cardiovascular complications and their natural courses, which included tachycardia, bradycardia, hypotension, cardiac arrhythmia, and cardiomegaly; and to identify if these complications were related to an adverse outcome.",

Based on the criteria for SARS that have been established by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), our case definition was a fever (temperature . 38\u02daC), a chest radiograph or a computed tomographic image of the thorax showing evidence of consolidation with or without respiratory symptoms, and a history of close contact with a person in whom SARS had been diagnosed. The diagnosis was confirmed by an indirect immunofluorescence assay with fetal rhesus kidney cells that were infected with coronavirus and fixed in acetone to detect a serological response to the virus 14 or by a positive viral culture. Among the patients, there were 85 health care workers or medical students. The initial outbreak of the infection has been previously described. 10 Most of the patients had good past health (79.3%). Only 25 (20.7%) patients had concurrent medical illness that included coronary heart disease in one, hypertension in seven, valvular heart disease in two, stroke in two, diabetes mellitus in five, asthma in four, bronchiectasis in one, old pulmonary tuberculosis in one, and chronic renal failure in two patients. These patients were treated according to the guidelines. 15 Cardiovascular assessment Blood pressure and pulse rate were measured at least every four hours during the hospitalisation period by the use of automatic blood pressure recording machines. Hypotension was defined by systolic blood pressure ,100 mm Hg. Tachycardia was defined as a heart rate .100 beats/minute in at least two consecutive readings. Bradycardia was defined as a daytime heart rate ,50 beats/minutes while awake in at least two consecutive readings.",

Cardiovascular symptoms of palpitation occurred in 4% and chest discomfort in 7% of patients. Abnormal blood tests that included haematological abnormalities of lymphopenia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, increase in lactase dehydrogenase as well as impairment of renal and liver function have been described elsewhere. 10 11 Increase in creatine phosphokinase activity occurred in 26% of patients. This is probably related to myositis as none of these patients had significant increase inf MB isoenzyme of creatine phosphokinase or troponin T. Radiological or computed tomographic evidence of pneumonia and pneumonitis was present in all patients. Forty seven (39%) patients developed arterial desaturation that needed oxygen therapy while 18 (15%) patients were admitted into intensive care unit. Six patients died of pneumonia. All the patients were treated with broad range antibiotics, ribavirin, and corticosteroids. 15 The mean duration of stay in hospital was 18 (5) days. The mean duration of follow up was 30 (17) days after discharge from hospital. Table 1 shows the blood pressure profile. Sixty one (50.4%) patients experienced significant hypotension during the hospitalisation period. In these patients, the mean systolic blood pressure was 84.9 (6.6) mm Hg (range: 69-99 mm Hg), and the mean diastolic blood pressure was 46.8 (5.0) mm Hg (range: 35-57 mm Hg); both of which were significantly lower than the admission value (systolic: 121 (14) mm Hg, diastolic: 67 (10) mm Hg, both p,0.001).

That patient developed hypotension during the second week of illness. He had severe pneumonia with arterial oxygen desaturation, and was sedated, intubated and received oxygen therapy in the intensive care unit. Temporary inotropic support by intravenous dobutamine was prescribed. Electrocardiography showed T wave inversion over anterior chest leads from V1 to V4. Echocardiography was performed during hypotension, which showed mild global hypokinesia, ejection fraction was 48%. This patient's blood pressure eventually improved, inotropic agent was stopped, and he was discharged without cardiac sequel. A follow up echocardiography showed a normalised systolic wall motion with an ejection fraction increased to 72%. 2) . In fact, tachycardic response was rather persistent during follow up, with a mean heart rate of 105 (14) beats/min at latest follow up (fig 2) . At latest follow up, tachycardia remained present in 47 (38.8%) patients. One patient remained in symptomatic tachycardia with palpitation, which was worsened by exertion. Significant sinus bradycardia was seen in 18 (14.9%) patients. The prevalence of sinus bradycardia was 11 (9.1%), 11 (9.1 %), and 5 (4.4%) in first, second, and third week of hospitalisation, respectively. Unlike tachycardia which was persistent, bradycardia was rather transient and lasted for a mean duration of 2.6 (1.9) days (range: 1-7 days) (p,0.001 compared with tachycardia). Six patients also experienced tachycardia during the course of hospitalisation. All the patients were asymptomatic during bradycardia. The mean heart rate during bradycardia was 43 (3) beats/min (range: 38-49 beats/min), which was significantly lower than the admission value (93 (12) beats/min, p,0.001). Few patients with bradycardia experienced hypotension, which was found in 2 of 11, 2 of 11, and 0 of 5 patients respectively from the first to third week.

The likelihood of developing tachycardia was increased in the second (x 2 = 3.99, p = 0.046) and third week (x 2 = 6.53, p = 0.01) of hospitalisation for patients who had received corticosteroid therapy.

During the latest follow up, 30% of patients were still receiving corticosteroid therapy. The use of corticosteroid therapy during follow up was not correlated with the occurrence of tachycardia (x 2 = 0.03, p = NS). Other cardiovascular complications were found not correlated with corticosteroid therapy. The occurrence of cardiovascular complications was probably not related to the use of ribavarin therapy. There was no correlation between the status of ribavarin therapy and occurrence of any of the above complications in the second and third week of hospitalisation.

Although in the early course of hospitalisation where all the patients were febrile, it was not the sole contributing factor as tachycardia remained prevalent during the third week of hospitalisation in which fever was subsided in most patients. Tachycardia was not explained by coexisting hypotension, which was present in a comparatively small number of patients. As shown in figures 1 and 2, the development of hypotension from the first week of hospitalisation was not mirrored by the increase in pulse rate. In addition, tachycardia was persisted in nearly 40% of patients during follow up. These patients were usually tolerating the change in pulse response well, with only a few of them complained of palpitation during the period of sinus tachycardia. There was one patient who could not resume his work after being followed up for 12 weeks because of severe symptoms. The occurrence of tachycardia during the third week of hospitalisation when most patients were afebrile could possibly be related to drug treatment, such corticosteroid and ribavarin. However, no relation between the status and dose of ribavarin therapy and tachycardia was found. On the other hand, corticosteroid therapy was associated with a higher incidence of tachycardia during the second and third week of hospitalisation. A dose dependent response of corticosteroid was also seen during the hospitalisation period. However, corticosteroid therapy did not predict persistent tachycardia during follow up. Such longlasting tachycardia could possibly be a result of change in the autonomic tone. Alternatively, sinus tachycardia may be secondary to cardiopulmonary or peripheral deconditioning, especially this disease resulting in significant systemic symptoms where prolonged bed rest is required, while myositis may result in further muscle damage.",
