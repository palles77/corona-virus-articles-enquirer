The viral genome contains a 5'-cap and a 3'-polyadenylated tail, and has a mol wt of 5.4 x 1 O6 Da (Lai and Stohlman, 1978, 1981; Wege et a/., 1978) . Upon infection, the virus produces a full-length genomic RNA and six subgenomic mRNAs arranged in a 3'-coterminal nestedset structure (Lai et al., 1981) . In addition, each mRNA appears to contain an identical 72-nucleotide leader sequence at the 5'-end (Lai et a/., 1983 (Lai et a/., , 1984 Spaan er al., 1983) . The leader RNA is added to the mRNAs by a unique mechanism of \"leader-primed transcription\"; i.e., a free leader RNA is synthesized, dissociates from the template, and then rebinds to the RNA template downstream at the initiation sites for the various mRNAs to serve as the primer for transcription (Baric efal., 1983 (Baric efal., , 1985 .

Crosses between a ts mutant of A59 and a wild-type JHM strain suggested that MHV RNA recombination occurs at a very high frequency (Makino era/., 1986). The high frequency can best be explained by the involvement of free RNA intermediates during RNA replication. In support of this interpretation, RNA intermediates of various sizes, derived from the Y-end of the genome and thus containing the leader sequences, have been detected in MHVinfected cells (Baric et a/., 1987) . These intermediates could conceivably participate in RNA recombination via a copy-choice mechanism. We have described this mechanism as discontinuous and nonprocessive RNA replication (Makino et a/., 1986); i.e., RNA synthesis stops at various places on the template and falls off the template, creating free RNA intermediates, which would reassociate with the template to continue transcription.",

Wild-type (non-ts) viruses were isolated from these crosses and screened by two-dimensional oligonucleotide fingerprinting of their mRNA 7 isolated from infected cells. The rationale of such an approach has previously been described (Makino et al., 1986) . We were able to identify recombinants by determining the parental origins of the oligonucleotides in mRNA 7. Since the leader and mRNA 7 sequences are derived from the opposite ends of the genomic RNA, any recombinants with an odd number of crossovers will generate a hybrid mRNA 7, with the leader RNA and the body sequences being derived from different parental viruses. In the cases of viruses with nonhybrid mRNA 7, we further examined the faint oligonucleotides derived from contaminating degraded larger mRNA species, which are sometimes present in the oligonucleotide fingerprints, for the presence of oligonucleotides derived from the opposite parent. These recombinants would have an even number of crossovers. By using these two approaches, we have isolated recombinants arising from both single and double crossover events. From the first cross between LA1 6 and 129, we detected several recombinants with a single crossover. One of these, Cl, has an oligonucleotide fingerprint very similar to that of the independently isolated recombinant Bl which was reported previously (Lai et a/., 1985) (Fig. 1) . Thus, this crossover site appears to be favored in several crosses. It is noteworthy that the mRNA 7 of Cl contains the JHM-specific leader oligonucleotides 8 and 8a (Makino et al., 1984) instead of the corresponding A59 oligonucleotides.",

A 5'-end-labeled synthetic 15-mer complementary to the 5'-end of the coding region of mRNA 7 (see Materials and Methods) of A59 was hybridized to intracellular mRNA and was primer-extended with reverse transcriptase. Since mRNA 7 is the predominant virusspecific RNA species in MHV-infected cells, the major primer-extended products should represent the leader RNA derived from mRNA 7. The products were separated by electrophoresis, eluted, and sequenced by the method of Maxam and Gilbert. Recombinant A5 contains a single base mutation at position 35 corresponding to A59 while the remainder of the leader was JHMspecific in sequence (Fig. 4) . In contrast, recombinant Al contains the opposite structure in which the first base mutation is JHM-specific and the rest of the leader corresponds to the sequences of A59. Thus, the crossover sites in these recombinants should be between nucleotides 35 and 60 from the 5'-end. We cannot define the exact crossover point in these recombinants because of the high homology of bases in this region. The position of the second crossover in A5 has not been determined precisely.

To isolate recombinants from this cross, we employed the procedures previously described (Makino et a/., 1986), namely, mixed infection was performed at 39\" to select only wild-type JHM virus and recombinant viruses. After three successive undiluted passages, the majority of the progeny virus would consist of recombinant viruses, probably as a result of multiple rounds of recombination or amplification (Makino et a/., 1986) . To determine whether recombinant viruses were generated from this cross, we analyzed the oligonucleotide fingerprints of mRNA 7 derived from the cells infected with the uncloned progeny virus. Any recombinant viruses with an odd number of crossovers will yield a mRNA 7 with a leader sequence derived from one parent and the body sequences derived from the other parent. Figure 5 shows the oligonucleotide fingerprint of mRNA 7 from such a mixed population.

To determine the crossover sites of these recombinants, the genomic RNA of these isolates was examined by two-dimensional oligonucleotide fingerprinting (Fig. 8) . Isolate D6 has a fingerprint identical to that of JHM except that the leader oligonucleotide of JHM is replaced with the A59-specific leader oligonucleotide 10. The leader-body junction oligonucleotide could not be identified in the genomic fingerprint. No OF CORONAVIRUS 337 other A59-specific oligonucleotides were found. This observation, together with its mRNA 7 structure, suggested that the crossover site of this recombinant is close to the 3'-side of the leader sequences at the 5'end of the genome.",

            "text": "Another isolate D5 has a mRNA 7 identical to parental A59, while some of the faint oligonucleotides, which are derived from the degraded larger mRNAs, appear to be JHM in origin. It suggests that isolate D5 is a recombinant virus with two or more even-numbered crossovers. The fingerprint of the genomic RNA of isolate D5 contains mostly A59 oligonucleotides but is missing two internal A59-specific oligonucleotides, 16 and 4 (Fig. 8) . Instead, it contains two new oligonucleotides corresponding to the JHM-specific oligonucleotides 14 and 11. Previous data indicate that these JHM oligonucleotides are located in the same region of the gene A as that of the missing A59 spots (Lai et a/., 1981; Makino et a/., 1984) . Thus, the isolate D5 contains a double crossover within gene A. However, the precise locations of the crossovers could not be determined since the D5 genome contains several new oligonucleotides, the origins of which are not clear. A third isolate, D2, contains the 5'-end of A59, as evidenced by the presence of oligonucleotides 10, 20, 5, and 16, which correspond to the leader and 5'-end of the gene A sequences of A59 (Fig. 8) . The corresponding JHM spots 8, 3, and 12 are missing. The remaining oligonucleotides are all JHM. Thus, the crossover point is close to the 3'-end of the gene A. However, two JHM-specific spots (40 and 44) which were located close to the junction of genes A and B (Makino ef a/., 1984) are missing. The corresponding A59 spot 6, which maps in the same location (Lai et al., 1981) is present. Thus, there are probably two additional crossovers in this region. Therefore, the isolate D2 may represent the progeny of a triple crossover. However, since there is only one A59-specific oligonucleotide identified in this region, it cannot be firmly established that this region contains genetic crossovers, instead of base mutation. We have attempted to examine the genome structure of the other three isolates; however, they are very poor virus producers. Therefore, we have not been able to obtain sufficient quantity of radiolabeled RNA for structural analysis. The genetic structures of the recombinants described in this report are summarized in Fig. 9 .",

            "text": "The numbering system is the same as in Fig. 1 , crossovers in the coding region of the RNA genome. The data presented in this report show at least two new classes of murine coronavirus recombinants. We have demonstrated for the first time that recombination can occur within the leader region itself. Furthermore, we have found recombination at multiple sites on a single viral genome, suggesting that it is possible to have double and possibly multiple crossover events during replication. It should be noted that the recombinational nature of the virus isolates studied in this report was established by the detection of new T,-oligonucleotides derived from the other parent and the loss of the corresponding oligonucleotides in the orig-inal parent. In most cases, two or more contiguous T,oligonucleotides in the same region are substituted. Thus, they represent true genetic crossovers involving long stretches of sequences within RNA genomes, rather than base mutations. The isolation of the double recombinants D5, A5, and A4 reemphasizes our previous contention that recombination occurs at a high frequency (Makino er al., 1986 ). Prior to this study, high frequency of recombination was shown by the number of recombinants in a population. These three isolates demonstrate that recombination can occur several times within the same viral genome. The possibility that recombinant D2 is a triple cross makes this argument even stronger. Whether they represent crossing-over during single or multiple rounds of RNA replication is not clear. Recombinant isolates Al and A5 were shown to have crossovers within the leader region by both oligonucleotide fingerprinting and sequence analysis. The crossover points in these viruses are between 35 and 60 nucleotides from the 5'-end of the genome. Due to the high degree of sequence homology between JHM and A59 in this region, the exact site of recombination cannot be more precisely defined. It should be noted that the recombinational nature of these two viruses could not be unequivocally established. Since A59 and JHM differ in the leader region only by a single base change at the nucleotide 35 and an insertion of 5 nucleotides (UCUAA) at nucleotide 60 in the JHM genome (Fig. 4 ) the intraleader recombinant Al is different from the parental A59 by only a single base. Thus, it cannot be ruled out that Al arose by base mutation rather than by recombination. However, the findings that this virus was detected at a high frequency, that nucleotide 35 was converted to a nucleotide identical to JHM, and that a reciprocal change (in recombinant A5) was detected at the same site, suggests that this virus is more likely to be a true RNA recombinant. It is intriguing to note that analysis of the leader sequence demonstrates a potential hairpin structure near this site of recombination (Shieh ef al., 1987; Baric er a/., 1987) . Three leader-containing RNA intermediates between 35 and 60 nucleotides long have also been detected in MHVinfected cells (Baric et al., 1987) . These data suggest that RNA intermediates generated at the regions of hairpin loops on the RNA genome could be the precursor to RNA recombination.",

These RNA species could serve as intermediates in normal RNA replication and in RNA recombination during a mixed infection. The isolation of recombinants with multiple crossovers is compatible with the idea of frequent transcriptional pausing. The RNA intermediates generated by such transcriptional pausing have now been characterized in detail in an accompanying paper (Baric et al., 1987) . Several recombinants, e.g., A5 and Al, have apparently recombined at sites corresponding to these intermediates.
