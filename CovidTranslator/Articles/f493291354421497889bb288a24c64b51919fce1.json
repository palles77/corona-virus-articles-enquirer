For instance, perception regarding severity of SARS was measured by a single question: \"How would you rate the degree of severity regarding SARS?\" Response options were: very serious, serious, fair, and not serious. In addition, participants were asked about the SARS survival rate: \"What percentage of SARS patients will survive according to the current medical technology?\" The answer options varied from < 50% to > 90%.",

Hence, nearly 80% of the participants reported having received SARS-related health education information from the media in the past 2 weeks prior to the time of the telephone survey. However, only 64% of the participants in this study held the belief that current medical technology could prolong the lives of patients suffering from SARS. This is in contrast to the actual fatality rate of SARS patients in Taiwan, which was 10.7%. 28 Such a discrepancy between the true and perceived fatality rate might be due to a public risk perception that is based more on rumors and anecdotes than scientific evidence. A recent study has shown that the perceived threat, vulnerability and response efficacy for SARS varied between countries in Europe and Asia. 29 A total of 668 probable SARS cases were diagnosed between March 14 and July 30, 2003 in Taiwan. 30 The impact of the epidemic on the country's medical and social system was tremendous. Fear was widespread. For example, despite the fact that none of the probable SARS cases were discovered in the communities of indigenous peoples (2% of Taiwan's population are Austronesian aborigines, mostly living in remote mountains), 42.6-50.9% of indigenous community residents reported that their daily life was affected by the SARS epidemic. 31 The prevalence of BSRS-5-defined psychiatric morbidity in our study population was found to be 11.7%. As expected, this was lower than that of hospital staff, with psychiatric morbidity among hospital workers ranging from 18 to 57%, depending on their level of involvement with SARS patients, and with the highest prevalence in hospitals that had nosocomial transmission of SARS. 12 The post-crisis prevalence (11.7%) in 2003 was higher than the prevalence in the general population (8.8%) after 2003, 32 but considerably lower than that of HIV-infected prison inmates (46.1%). 33 It is very likely that negative life events also influence BSRS scores. These findings suggest the need to enhance mental health services during and after EID crises.",

It is also noteworthy that limited information exists with regard to the potential importance of life events in predicting psychiatric morbidity such as depression, 38 which warrants further exploration. The potential recall bias might be inevitable for certain elderly respondents. However, the fact that 76.6% of the respondents received SARS-related health education information from the media in the 2 weeks prior to the survey reduces this potential recall bias. Another potential selection bias is due to the 593 non-respondents. Yet, weighted samples were used in the analysis to ensure that the estimates reflected the general population.
