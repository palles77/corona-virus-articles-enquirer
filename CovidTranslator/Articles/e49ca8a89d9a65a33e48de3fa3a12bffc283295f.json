Presently only killed vaccines of avian tissue-culture origin are commercially available in the United States. Most horses develop neutralizing and hemagglutination inhibiting (HI) antibodies to EEEV within one week following vaccination, and antibodies can be detected in all horses one week after a second vaccination (Barber et al., 1978) . In this study, neutralizing antibodies were detected in most sows only after a third vaccination. Colostrum from all vaccinated sows had elevated neutralizing antibody titers to EEEV. Colostrum from vaccinated mares had highest HI antibody titers, while serum from foals one week after birth and mares had similar but lower HI titers than colostrum (Ferguson et al., 1979) . Piglets from all litters, regardless of product or route of inoculation, had elevated neutralizing antibody titers in serum. At the next farrowing, 167 days after the last vaccination, none of 13 vaccinated sows, but 3 of 9 tested colostrum samples had anti-EEEV antibody titers (Table 2) . Thirty-four of 84 tested pigs had antibody titers to EEEV, regardless of serologic status of the dam. A booster vaccination of sows led to a rise in detectable antibody titers. Antibodies could be detected in all vaccinated horses up to 6 months after vaccination, while one year after vaccination, no HI or neutralizing antibodies could be detected in 94% and 53% of the horses, respectively (Barber et al., 1978) . However, all vaccinated horses in that study were refractory to challenge infection 12 months after vaccination, It appears that measurable serologic status is a poor indicator of the immune status of the mammalian host, and that piglets from sows exposed to EEEV in the field or through vaccination could be protected from clinical EEE, even if no antibodies can be measured in the serum of the dams.",

Half-life of maternal antibodies in foals between 1 and 100 days of age was estimated at 20 and 33 days (Ferguson et al., 1979; Gibbs et al., 1988) . It is possible that maternal antibodies derived from colostmm of vaccinated mares interfere with active immunity of foals after vaccination (Ferguson et al., 1979; Gibbs et al., 1988) . Seventy percent of foals with moderate HI antibody titers did not show a rise in titer when vaccinated at three months of age, while all foals aged 4 months and older showed evidence of response to the vaccine (Gibbs et al., 1988) . However, vaccination of nursing or growing pigs would not be practical and interference of maternal antibodies with vaccines should be of no concern in swine. Epidemiologic evaluation of outbreaks indicates that older pigs in which maternal antibodies would have deteriorated are refractory to clinical EEEV infection (Purse11 et al., 1972; Elvinger et al., 1994a) .",

None of the pigs from vaccinated sows suffered clinical disease, although virus was isolated sporadically from blood and oropharyngeal swabs from 2 of the 6 pigs, and from the tonsils of one pig after necropsy 5 days after experimental inoculation. Amounts of circulating virus appeared to be very low since virus could not be titrated and also could not be reisolated after freezing of the specimens. Conversely, all 6 pigs from non-vaccinated sows showed EEE related disease signs of varying severity, and significant virus titers were found in blood. Titers in pigs from non-vaccinated sows could be sufficient for mosquitoes to acquire infectious doses of EEEV (Scott and Weaver, 1989; Mitchell et al., 1993) .",
