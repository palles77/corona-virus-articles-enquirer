            "text": "white paper on 'Ethical Principles in the Allocation of Human Organs', 9 reviewed and updated in 2015, the Ethics Committee of the Organ Procurement and 10 Transplantation Network identified three principles of primary importance in the 11 equitable allocation of scarce human organs for transplantation: 1) utility; 2) justice; and 12 3) respect for persons (including respect for autonomy). 1 Strong factors that impact 13 access to transplant waiting list, like patient and graft survival, quality of life, availability 14 of alternative treatments, and age should also be considered within the context and 15 balance of these three ethical principles, in particular utility. 16 Lung transplantation (LTx) programs across the world are regularly consulted for 17 patients admitted elsewhere developing de novo acute respiratory deterioration with no 18 further treatment options beside urgent and unplanned LTx. Mechanical ventilation 19 and/or extracorporeal life support is often deployed to bridge such patients to LTx. This 20 situation is still considered a relative contraindication in the 2014 updated International 21 Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation (ISHLT) consensus document for the 22 selection of LTx candidates. 2 Overall these patients are known to have worse 23 has therefore been reluctant to accept such patients on their waiting list because of the 25 increased risk to waste good organs and the competition with stable and electively listed 26 patients with a better chance for good post-transplant outcome. 27 Tang and co-workers in this issue of the journal reviewed their experience with 28 201 urgently listed patients transplanted between 2006 and 2017 at Cleveland Clinic. 4 29 Recipient outcome was compared with 1,423 electively listed and transplanted patients. 30 Not surprisingly, death at any time after listing, including post-transplant deaths was 31 much higher amongst urgently listed patients. These patients were younger (53\u00b113 vs 32 55\u00b112 years), had more ventilator and extracorporeal support (25% vs 2%), more 33 restrictive lung disease (73% vs 51%), and a higher lung allocation score (LAS) (82\u00b113 34 vs 47\u00b117). Of note, at 1 month after listing mortality was 26% in urgently listed patients 35 and 58% were transplanted versus only 2.1% and 20%, respectively in the electively 36 listed patients. However, in-hospital morbidity and mortality, survival up to 7 years, and 37 allograft function were similar in a matched comparison of both groups with 76 patients 38 each using weighted balancing-score methodology. 4 39 This report is one of the largest single-center studies focusing on outcome in 40 'urgently listed' LTx candidates. How to understand that outcome was similar in both 41 matched groups? We believe this was related to the definition of urgently listed, 42 determined as previously not evaluated as an outpatient prior to listing while the 43 electively listed patients were identified in this study by the date of listing preceding the 44 date of hospital admission for transplantation. After all both groups consisted of \"urgent\" 45 support, but their date of listing differed. Nevertheless, this retrospective study by the Cleveland group on a large patient 48 cohort is interesting as their findings shed new light on the on-going discussion whether 49 patients with acute respiratory failure and urgent referral for rescue transplantation, 50",
