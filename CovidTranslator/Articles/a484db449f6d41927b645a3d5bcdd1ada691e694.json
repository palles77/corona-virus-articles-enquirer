Principal Results: Vaccination reduces influenza episodes of vaccinated (4.81/100 HCW) compared to unvaccinated (7.54/100) HCWs/influenza season. A Cochrane review found for inactivated vaccines the Number Needed to Vaccinate (NNV) = 71 (95%CI 64%, 80%) for adults 18-60 (same age as HCWs) to prevent laboratory-proven influenza. There are no RCTs of screening HCWs, patients, visitors and influenza supershedders to prevent transmission. None of four RCTs of HCWs mask-wearing (two directly observed, two not) showed an effect because they were underpowered either due to small size or low circulation of influenza. Hospital rooms and equipment can effectively be cleaned of influenza by many chemicals and hydrogen peroxide vapor machines but the cleaning cycle needs shortening to increase the likelihood of adoption. Major Conclusions: HCW vaccination is a partial solution with current vaccination levels. There are no RCTs of screening HCWs, patients and visitors demonstrating preventing influenza transmission. Only one study costed furloughing HCWs with influenza and no RCTs have identified benefits of isolating influenza supershedders. RCTs of directly-and electronically continuously-observed mask-wearing and hand-hygiene and RCTs of incentives for meticulous hygiene are required. RCTs of engineering solutions (external venting, frequent room air changes) are needed. A wide range of chemicals effectively cleans hospital rooms and equipment from influenza. Hydrogen peroxide vapor is effective against influenza and a wide range of bacterial pathogens with patient room changes, and clean areas cleaners do not clean but its cleaning cycle needs shortening to increase the likelihood of adoption of cleaning rooms vacated by influenza patients.",

The Canadian national hospitalization database 1994/5 to 1999/2000 estimated the annual influenza hospitalization rate of those \u226520 years was 65/100,000. For those \u226565 it was 27-340/100,000, and their rates were 30-110/100,000 for RSV, 60-90/100,000 for parainfluenza and 130-350/100,000 for other viruses. The period included three severe influenza seasons [1] . However, an Argentinian study 2002-9 found lower excess hospitalization rates for pneumonia and influenza combined during influenza seasons of 20/1000,000 [2] .",

In hospitals requiring influenza vaccination 95.2% were vaccinated and 68.2% in hospitals not requiring vaccination [18] . A study of 3275 HCWs in a Canadian tertiary care hospital found that the strongest predictors of influenza vaccination were a desire to protect family members and patients, believing vaccination is important even if one is healthy, confidence in vaccine safety and no adverse effects, and supervisor and physician encouragement [19] . A study of 7279 HCWs in the St Louis area obtained a 43.8% response rate and reported 78.9% were vaccinated in the 2010/2011 seasonal vaccine and 63.3% for H1N1. Vaccination rates were not reported for the 1506 hospital HCWs but 51% reported their employer had a mandatory vaccination policy but of these 64% said it was not enforced [20] . The most effective mandatory vaccination program is the Washington University Hospitals group in St. Louis, USA, with 25,561 (98.4%) of 25,980 active employees vaccinated. Those neither vaccinated nor exempted were initially suspended without pay and then dismissed. However, most attending physicians were either affiliated with the university or in private practice and were not covered by this policy and their vaccination rates were not reported [21] . Thus HCW vaccination rates are lower than the US Department of Health and Human Services goal of 90% by 2020 [22] , the results of vaccination campaigns vary widely by country and institution, and there has been no RCT of transmission with high (90%) HCW influenza vaccination rates.",

There are four C-RCTs with mask wearing not directly-observed: two of surgical masks vs. respirators without a control group, one of surgical masks vs. control and one of cloth masks vs. control [40] [41] [42] [43] . All the studies were underpowered either because of small numbers or low circulating influenza virus during the study periods and none demonstrated reductions in HCW influenza measured by RT-PCR or culture. One study stated that self-reported handwashing after patient contact took place \"at all times\" in 72.9% of the group wearing masks, 60.7% wearing N95 respirators only for high risk situations and 77% in the other N95 respirator group and this is the only study reporting hand washing [42] . The same study showed a significant reduction in bacterial carriage in the N95 group [42] (Table 1 ).

Influenza can last for several hours on stainless steel surfaces, but usually for less than 15 min on porous surfaces and hands unless the influenza is deposited in secretions such as sputum. HCW hands, clothing and equipment are reinfected by contact with new influenza deposits on surfaces and by coughing, which they may then transfer to the next patient. H1N1 on stainless steel objects is 99% inactivated after 2.5 min by hydrogen peroxide vapour at 10-ppm, and by triethylene glycol vapour at 2-ppm by 1.3 log 10 reductions/hour (16 times faster than natural inactivation rate) [47] . A wide range of surface cleaners are effective against influenza [48, 49] . A systematic review found hydrogen peroxide effective against multiple pathogens including MRSA and C. difficile [50] . A 500 bed teaching hospital in New Haven decontaminated 1565 rooms with hydrogen peroxide over a 22 month period, of which 1095 rooms had been vacated by patients with C. difficile, 219 multidrug-resistant organisms, 110 norovirus and 78 MRSA. However, cleaning took 3-3.5 h compared to 32 min for usual hand-cleaning by bleach. The additional time is the final stage which reduces hydrogen peroxide to <2 ppm by drawing room vapor over heavy metals [51] . The most soiled areas in a hospital room are bedrails and table, floors, toilet floors, window shelves, lockers, grilles and medical equipment including BP and oxygen sensors, ECG machines and defibrillators [52] . Hydrogen peroxide can reach all these surfaces which might be neglected by a cleaner.",

There are several uncertainties in the vaccination literature which need resolution. Firstly, because of the uncertainty whether herd immunity could be achieved with higher levels, compulsory vaccination/mask wearing is disputed. A Cochrane review of vaccinating healthy adults age 18-60 found the NNV currently to prevent one case of laboratory-proven influenza for inactivated vaccines is 71 (95%CI 64%, 80%) [13] . Secondly, the Cochrane review of HCW vaccination identified only three RCTs [23] and for the one which reported laboratory-proven influenza the VE was 88% (95%CI 59-96), p = 0.0005 [24] . Thirdly, the Cochrane review of vaccinating HCWs to prevent influenza in elderly patients they care for in nursing homes identified only three RCTs and no conclusions could be drawn due to performance and detection bias [25] . Fourthly, vaccinated workers still get influenza: a systematic review found 4.81 (3.23 to 7.16) influenza infections (as measured by a four-fold increase in antibody titre)/100 vaccinated and 7.54 (4.86 to 11.70) unvaccinated HCWs [15] .
