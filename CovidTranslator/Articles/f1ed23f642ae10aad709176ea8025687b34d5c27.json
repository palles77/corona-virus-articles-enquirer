Attempts by the Department of Defense to find an alternative solution were unsuccessful, and existing vaccine stocks were depleted in 1999. Ad quickly re-emerged as the major cause of morbidity, causing numerous outbreaks with both vaccine and nonvaccine serotypes, and directly resulting in approximately 1 death per year [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] . From 1997 to 2012, Ad ( primarily serotype 4) caused 68% of all FRI in the basic training environment [11] .

Phase 3 vaccine trials demonstrated (1) 99% efficacy for Ad4 and (2) Ad7 (which was not circulating at the time) seroconversion rates of 95% [15] . In 2011, the 2 vaccines were approved by the FDA and reintroduced nearly simultaneously at all 8 US military basic training locations in October/November of that year. Since then, surveillance reports have consistently demonstrated great reductions in FRI and Ad-related illness. Early data indicated a 75% decrease in FRI, and proportions of collected specimens positive for Ad decreased from 75% to 1% in the months surrounding vaccine introduction (VI) [11] . Nearly all of this was attributable to Ad4, with rare detections of serotypes 7, 3, 14, and 21, and 3 cases involving vaccine-type 4p. Follow-up data published in late 2014, evaluating surveillance data from 1996 to 2013, reported reductions in Ad disease burden from 5.9 to 0.02 cases/person-week [16] . The authors estimated that the current vaccines prevent 13 000 cases of FRI, 1100-2700 hospitalizations, and 1 death per year. After VI, Ad14 became the most prevalent circulating serotype, although actual number of cases detected decreased from approximately 610 per year to 44 in 2013. This large study reported comprehensive surveillance data for overall Ad and FRI, but clinical data were not captured. Whether the clinical presentation of those trainees who do present for care with a respiratory illness has changed post-VI is unclear. Because respiratory illness remains a leading cause of presentation for care among military trainees, understanding of trends in clinical presentation and emerging, non-Ad respiratory pathogens in the post-VI era requires evaluation.",

Inclusion criteria were met if the trainee was \u226517 years of age and endorsed any symptom of respiratory infection, including cough, coryza, sore throat, or nasal or sinus congestion. For those consenting to enroll in the study, demographic information was collected, along with a symptom questionnaire, including self-reported stress levels, and clinical signs, including vital signs and physical examination findings recorded during the medical encounter. Provider diagnoses given at the time of the visit were also recorded when available. Provider clinical diagnosis extracted from the note, if any, associated with the visit, was also explored with reference to diagnoses of upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) vs lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI). The diagnoses, \"rhinitis, conjunctivitis, otitis, sinusitis, pharyngitis, sore throat\" were considered to be representative of URTI, and the terms \"bronchitis, pneumonia\" were representative of LRTI. Terms including \"common cold\", \"viral syndrome\", \"fever\", or \"cough\" were not included in the URTI vs LRTI analysis given their lack of anatomical description. Nasal washes and throat swabs were collected for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays. Duplicate presentations for multiple ARI-related visits were excluded; each case represents an individual subject.",

            "text": "Reintroduction of the Ad vaccine in basic training populations has again been extraordinarily successful in reducing the burden of both Ad-related respiratory illness and the burden of respiratory illness with fever. 75% reductions in FRI have been demonstrated by others, including at Joint Base San Antonio-Lackland where this study was conducted, against the backdrop of a 99.6% reduction in the weekly rate of Ad-related illness [11, 16] . Sustaining the commitment to prevention of Ad-related illness in uniquely susceptible trainees will be necessary if history is not to repeat itself. However, prevention of respiratory illness in this population is a complex task. Risk factors for transmission of respiratory pathogens will continue to be present in conditions inherent to basic military training. Adenovirus, despite its preeminence as a pathogen of interest in this group, has never been the entire story, and large outbreaks of non-vaccine serotype Ads have occurred even while vaccine serotypes were circulating [9] . Influenza causes annual epidemics which, in the context of an effective vaccine program, are typically limited in this population, but which can have considerable impact when new strains emerge. In summer and fall of 2009, influenza was responsible for 20% of FRI in those who were tested [20, 21] . Large outbreaks of pharyngitis caused by S. pyogenes, complicated by acute rheumatic fever, pneumonia, necrotizing skin and soft tissue infections, and other suppurative and immunologic complications, have been reported throughout the past century, prompting widespread use of antimicrobial prophylaxis at training sites [22] [23] [24] . Pneumococcal outbreaks have also occurred despite such prophylaxis, including pneumonia and fatal meningitis [25, 26] . Others, including Neisseria meningitidis, Bordetella pertussis, M. pneumoniae, and C. pneumoniae, have been well-described in this population [27] . Horizontal efforts at respiratory infection prevention, such as promoting hand hygiene, environmental including gas mask disinfection, cohorting of ill trainees, and respiratory etiquette, will require continued emphasis, even with near-elimination of Ad-related illness. However, vertical measures targeting specific organisms have also been demonstrated to have significant impact, with Ad vaccine as the prime example, and ongoing exploration into post-VI causes of illness will be necessary to direct further interventions. Furthermore, although widespread efforts exist to monitor FRI rates and conduct surveillance for common respiratory viruses, not all acute respiratory illness is febrile. Clearly, trainees are still presenting for illness, but those without fever, which now represent >90% of those presenting for care, will not have respiratory pathogen analysis via DoD-directed surveillance mechanisms. Few prior data inform clinical differences between those presenting with Ad vs other respiratory pathogens. Recent comparisons of pdm(09)H1N1 influenza and Ad, including an analysis from this cohort, corroborated a predominance of coryza and cough presentations for influenza, vs pharyngitis for Ad [20, 21] . This evaluation again emphasizes a classic presentation of Ad-related illness: fever, systemic complaints, and pharyngitis, distinct from the afebrile, coryza/ cough presentations of those presenting post-VI and with rhinovirus. Interestingly, documentation of abnormal lung examination findings increased post-VI, as did use of clinical diagnostic terms suggesting LRTI, including both bronchitis and pneumonia. It is likely that most of those labelled \"pneumonia\" were never confirmed with radiographs, and absence of fever with these argues against that diagnosis in this young, otherwise healthy population. The predominant organism identified among these was rhinovirus, which, while not classically associated with lower respiratory disease in healthy adults, has been described including within military training populations [28, 29] . Nevertheless, the combination of increased LRTI diagnoses, and the increase in cough as well as physical exam findings of the same, provide signal of an increase in LRTI post-VI which should be explored with targeted research. It is also considerable that, despite a relatively broad panel of respiratory pathogens targeted with molecular methods, >50% post-VI had no pathogen detected. Some of these may have been noninfectious, as suggested by the increase in clinical diagnostic terms relating to allergies, but this represents a significant research gap. The nature of respiratory illness itself in basic military trainees has changed after reintroduction of Ad vaccine, transitioning from a febrile pharyngitis marked by systemic signs and symptoms, to an afebrile, cough and coryza predominant illness. The ecologic niche occupied by vaccine-serotype Ad in this population was remarkable, causing approximately 70% of all FRI historically and with 80% of trainees infected by the end of training [4, 11] . During Ad VI in 1971, molecular methods for pathogen surveillance were not available; despite this, serotype shift was observed. Initially, Ad4 was the only serotype included in the vaccine program, but Ad7 was later added after this emerged and replaced Ad4 as the predominant cause of FRI [5] . Since that time, dozens of additional Ad serotypes and other respiratory viral pathogens such as bocavirus and human metapneumovirus have been identified. Respiratory pathogens cause outbreaks, which may come and go independently of a vaccine program's effect, so changes in frequency must be interpreted with caution. However, it is reassuring that Ad14 has not yet reemerged in this population and, in fact, decreased in frequency since VI, a finding which has been corroborated by others, and potentially related to crossprotection with Ad7 immunity [9, 16] . The decrease in frequency of influenza A was driven by the unusually high number of influenza A cases in 2009, which contributed 63 to the total of 76 during the entire study. The trend toward a decrease in S. pyogenes (with no changes in antibiotic prophylaxis during the study period) is potentially biologically plausible with viral coinfection increasing the likelihood of streptococcal illness, although specific associations between Ad and S. pyogenes have not been established, and rates of S. pyogenes illness are not known to have changed during the first iteration of the Ad vaccine program. The small increases seen in detection of M. pneumoniae, bocavirus and coronavirus OC43 may be due to chance alone or natural variation, but bear further observation. Most significant was the increase seen in detections of rhinovirus, which increased as a proportion of detected pathogens, in rates of positive tests among those tested for rhinovirus, and in raw numbers despite fewer overall enrollments. Rhinovirus may be associated with decreased probability of detecting other respiratory viral pathogens, including Ad. An evaluation of virus pairs in a PCR-based analysis of co-detections demonstrated a negative association between Ad and rhinovirus. While multiple additional respiratory viruses also demonstrated a negative association with rhinovirus, no others correlated either positively or negatively with Ad [30] . A negative interaction between these 2 pathogens has previously been reported in military recruits with and without symptoms of respiratory illness, and with Ad, but not rhinovirus, clearly associated with illness [31] .",

Others include the high uptake of Ad vaccine, and the consistency in access to care, living and training conditions, and preventive medicine measures throughout the study period. The study also has a number of limitations. This is a single center which, although spanning several years, cannot account for natural variability of respiratory pathogens here or at other training sites, and some pathogens were tested for only from a subset of samples. These represent a convenience sample of the overall burden of trainees presenting to medical care for respiratory illness. Trainees, for a number of reasons, may be reluctant to self-identify when ill and present for care. While we have no reason to believe this limitation changed over the course of the study, this limits the ability to extrapolate frequencies of detection to rates of disease. Since asymptomatic subjects are not captured, it also limits the ability to determine colonization vs correlation with clinical illness. However, study procedures and approaches to enrolling trainees were unchanged over the course of the study period. There may have been increases in healthcare-seeking behavior in 2009 during the influenza pandemic, and this year saw the highest number of enrollments over the course of the study. Finally, comorbidities in this group were not captured, although significant known comorbidities are typically disqualifying for military accession.",
