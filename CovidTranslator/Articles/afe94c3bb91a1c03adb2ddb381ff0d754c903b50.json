            "text": "Cereal commodities are frequently contaminated with mycotoxins produced by the secondary metabolism of fungal infection. Among these contaminants, deoxynivalenol (DON), also known as vomitoxin, is the most prevalent type B trichothecene mycotoxin worldwide. Pigs are very sensitive to the toxic effects of DON and are frequently exposed to naturally contaminated feed. Recently, DON naturally contaminated feed has been shown to decrease porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) specific antibody responses following experimental infection. The objective of this study was to determine the impact of DON naturally contaminated feed on the immune response generated following vaccination with PRRSV live attenuated vaccine. Eighteen pigs were randomly divided into three experimental groups of 6 animals based on DON content of the diets (0, 2.5 and 3.5 mg DON/kg). They were fed these rations one week prior to the vaccination and for all the duration of the immune response evaluation. All pigs were vaccinated intra-muscularly with one dose of Ingelvac \u00ae PRRSV modified live vaccine (MLV). Blood samples were collected at day \u22121, 6, 13, 20, 27 and 35 post vaccination (pv) and tested for PRRSV RNA by RT-qPCR and for virus specific antibodies by ELISA. Results showed that ingestion of DON-contaminated diets significantly decreased PRRSV viremia. All pigs fed control diet were viremic while only 1 (17%) and 3 (50%) out of 6 pigs were viremic in the groups receiving 3.5 and 2.5 mg of DON/kg, respectively. Subsequently, all pigs fed control diet developed PRRSV specific antibodies while only viremic pigs that were fed contaminated diets have developed PRRSV specific antibodies. These results suggest that feeding pigs with DON-contaminated diet could inhibit vaccination efficiency of PRRSV MLV by severely impairing viral replication.",

            "text": "Animal feeds are frequently contaminated with various mycotoxins produced by the secondary metabolism of diverse fungal contaminants in response to stress [1] . Among them, Fusarium spp. are the most prevalent mycotoxin producing fungi in temperate regions [2] . Trichothecenes, including deoxynivalenol (DON) and T-2 toxin, zearalenone and fumonisin B1, are toxicologically significant Fusarium spp. mycotoxins [3] . DON, also known as vomitoxin, is the most prevalent mycotoxin in grain [4] and because of the high percentage of cereal in pig diets, swine are frequently exposed to this toxin. In this animal, dietary concentrations between 2 and 5 mg DON/kg are associated with feed refusal and reduced weight gain, whereas concentrations over 20 mg DON/kg cause abdominal distress, diarrhea, vomiting and even shock or death [5] . High contamination levels are rare in modern agricultural practice, instead chronic exposure to low doses of DON is more frequent [6] . DON possesses also immunomodulatory properties [7] ; in mouse, low concentrations exert pro-inflammatory effects by inducing cytokines and chemokines expression in mononuclear phagocytes, as a consequence of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) activation [8] . In the same model, dietary exposure to DON upregulates serum IgA and leads to decreased serum concentrations of IgM and IgG [9] . In pigs, DON has also been shown to activate MAPK in the intestine [10] . However, studies in primary porcine macrophages provide evidence for a lack of COX-2 and IL-6 activation by DON in this cell type, suggesting a distinct mode of action in this species [11] on pigs indicate only marginal or no effects of DON on IgA level [4] . Nonetheless, other studies reported an increase of specific-IgA accompanied with a decrease of specific IgG and cytokines activation following immunization with ovalbumin in DON-fed piglets [12, 13] . More recently, DON naturally contaminated diet has also been shown to decrease porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) virus-specific antibody responses following experimental infection [14] .",

            "text": "Economically, PRRS is the most important viral disease in swine livestock worldwide [15] . Causative agent of PRRS is a small enveloped positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus classified in the order Nidovirales, family Arteriviridae, genus Arterivirus, which also includes lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus of mice, simian hemorrhagic fever virus and equine arteritis virus [16] . PRRSV causes common clinical signs such as anorexia, fever, and lethargy. In sows, PRRSV is responsible for reproductive failure, characterized by late-term abortions, increased numbers of stillborn fetuses, and/or premature, weak pigs. Furthermore, PRRSV is responsible for respiratory problems in growing and finishing pigs [17, 18] . Measures currently used to control PRRS include management practices such as whole herd depopulation/repopulation or herd closure, constraining bio-security measures, surveillance of herd status and vaccination [19] . Modified live vaccines (MLV) against PRRSV have been widely used and have shown some efficacy in reducing clinical disease severity, as well as viremia duration and virus shedding [20] . Given the impact of DON on the pig immune response and wide spread use of PRRS MLV vaccine for the control of this economically devastating disease, the objective of this study was to determine the effect of DON naturally contaminated feed on the immune response generated following vaccination with PRRS MLV.",

Even though one other study, also showed no significant effect of DON on ADG [13] , these results must be analyzed carefully because chronic effects of DON on ADG might be observed after 3 weeks of diet consumption [25] . However the ADG decreased significantly after vaccination in the group fed 3.5 mg/kg of DON. Decreased ADG in pig has also been observed soon after vaccination [26, 27] .

            "text": "PRRSV-specific antibodies appear approximately two weeks, and peak around four weeks after vaccination [29] . The majority of the antibodies are directed against viral nucleocapsid proteins (N) which have no neutralizing activity [29] . Generation of neutralizing antibodies is delayed in PRRSV infection and usually appears three to four weeks after vaccination [30] . Typically, serum neutralizing antibody titers are unusually low in comparison to those induced by other viruses [20] . The present results showed that DON naturally contaminated feed significantly decreased the antibody response generated following PRRS MLV vaccination. Vaccine failures are not uncommon in the field [31] and can be virus related due to a lack of cross-protection between the vaccine and field strains [32, 33] or immune related due to inefficient immune response [34] . Here, PRRS vaccine failure appears to be caused by an inefficient immune response following the ingestion of feed naturally contaminated with DON. Indeed, contamination of feed with DON has been previously implicated in vaccine failure due to the effects of DON on the immune system [12, 35, 36] . Moreover, ingestion of DON naturally contaminated feed have been previously shown to decrease PRRSV-specific antibody titers after experimental PRRSV infection [14] . In the case of PRRS MLV, live PRRSV replication is required to provide immunological protection against PRRSV infection [37] . The present results showed that ingestion of DON at different concentrations (2.5 and 3.5 mg/kg) severely decreases the replication of the attenuated vaccine strain in vaccinated pigs. This suggests that the effect of DON on the immune response generated by the MLV vaccine is more related to its impact on the replication of vaccinal virus in swine. DON has been shown previously to inhibit PRRSV replication in MARC-145 and porcine alveolar macrophages (PAM) cell models [38] . In that study, it was suggested that the early activation of pro-inflammatory genes and apoptosis following DON exposure was detrimental to PRRSV replication. In studies with concomitant viral infections, previous porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV) [39] and porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) [40] , two potent inducer of endogenous IFN, have also been shown to decrease significantly PRRSV replication following experimental infection. Involvement of pro-inflammatory genes in the inhibition of PRRSV replication following DON-contaminated feed ingestion remains to be determined.",

Live viral vaccines are among the most effective strategies for the induction of lifelong immunity and many of these vaccines are routinely used to provide protection against many human [41] and animal viral diseases [42] . It is difficult to predict if the present findings can be applied to other live viral vaccine, because of the small size of groups used in this study but also the impact of DON-contaminated feed might be virus-specific. In the particular case of PRRS vaccine, the immune response was blunted by an impairment of virus replication following ingestion of DON-contaminated feed. Further studies are needed to describe the exact mechanism by which DON-contaminated feed impairs the replication of PRRSV vaccinal strains.",
