Macrophage infiltrates are increased in the lungs after organic dust exposures, yet the phenotype and functional importance of these cells remain unclear. Using an established intranasal inhalation murine model of dust-induced lung inflammation, animals were treated once or daily for 3 weeks with swine confinement organic dust extract (DE) . Repetitive DE treatment for 3 weeks resulted in significant increases in CD11c 1 /CD11b 1 macrophages in whole lung-associated tissue. These cells displayed increased costimulatory molecule (CD80 and CD86) expression, enhanced phagocytic ability, and an increased production of IL-6, CXCL1, and CXCL2. Similar findings were observed with the CD11c 1 /CD11b 1 macrophage infiltrate after repetitive exposure to peptidoglycan, a major DE component. To determine the functional importance of macrophages in mediating DE-induced airway inflammation, lung macrophages were selectively depleted using a well-established intranasal clodronate liposome depletion/suicide strategy. First, macrophage depletion by clodronate liposomes resulted in significant reductions in airway neutrophil influx and TNF-a and IL-6 production after a single exposure to DE. In contrast, after repetitive 3-week exposure to DE, airway lavage fluid and lung tissue neutrophils were significantly increased in clodronate liposome-treated mice compared with control mice. A histological examination of lung tissue demonstrated striking increases in alveolar and bronchiolar inflammation, as well as in the size and distribution of cellular aggregates in clodronate-liposome versus saline-liposome groups repetitively exposed to DE. These studies demonstrate that DE elicits activated CD11c 1 /CD11b 1 macrophages in the lung, which play a critical role in regulating the outcome of DE-induced airway inflammation.",

Agricultural workers are routinely exposed to organic dust environments, with the highest prevalence of airway disease associated with animal farming exposures, particularly swine confinement operations (2) . Initial exposure to organic dust induces an intense proinflammatory response marked by fevers, bronchial hyperresponsiveness, and increases in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) inflammatory cells and cytokines/chemokines that wane over time. However, persons chronically exposed to these environments are at increased risk of lung function decline, airway inflammation, and progressive respiratory impairment (1, (3) (4) (5) . Although this paradigm, termed \"chronic adaptation inflammatory response\" (1), has been replicated and described in animal models by our group (6) and others (7), the critical cellular mechanisms underlying this response remain unclear.",

            "text": "Lung mononuclear phagocytes and macrophages are important innate immune lung effectors that serve a critical role in host defense against inhaled environmental insults and toxins (8) (9) (10) . These cells can orchestrate inflammatory responses through the release of mediators that promote inflammation, activate epithelial cells, and elicit neutrophil recruitment (11, 12) . Macrophages produce several mediators after in vitro exposure to organic dust extract (DE) that are associated with agriculturally induced disease, such as TNF-a, IL-6, and CXCL8 (1, 13) . In the lung, alveolar macrophages are well recognized to represent the largest mononuclear phagocyte population (14) . These cells differ from other tissue macrophages based on their high expression levels of CD11c, which is a molecule typically not present on other tissue macrophages, and is generally considered a dendritic cell marker (15) (16) (17) (18) (19) (20) . Furthermore, CD11b expression, which is high in other tissue macrophage populations, is quite low in alveolar macrophages, unless these cells are activated (16, 17) . Lifetime nonsmoking swine farmers demonstrate signs of bronchial inflammation with neutrophils, alveolar macrophages, and lymphocytes present in lavage fluid (21) . Furthermore, evidence suggests that the alveolar macrophages in these farmers may be activated, based on observations of increased macrophage chemotactic activity and ex vivo oxygen radical formation (21) . Airway and lung parenchymal macrophage infiltrates are also increased in mice after organic dust exposure (6, 7) . However, the phenotype and functional importance of these cells have not been well described. Therefore, to address the functional role of alveolar macrophages in the context of repetitive DE-induced lung inflammation, we analyzed CD11c 1 lung macrophages to determine their activation phenotype. In addition, we compared these responses with those of peptidoglycan (PGN), a major component of organic DE previously shown to drive DE-elicited inflammatory responses in macrophages (13) . Finally, we selectively depleted lung macrophages using a wellestablished intranasal clodronate liposome macrophage depletion/ suicide strategy to determine the functional importance of these cells in the context of both single and repetitive DE exposures (17, 22, 23) .",

Similar to what was observed among DE-treated mice, PGN induced an expansion in total lung cell infiltrates, with an increase in total number of CD11c 1 macrophages ( Figure 3A ). Repetitive PGN exposure resulted in increased costimulatory molecule expression (CD80 and CD86) and increased adhesion molecule CD11b expression ( Figure 3B ) in CD11c 1 lung macrophages, consistent with the observations already described for DE. However, unlike treatment with DE, PGN treatment significantly augmented MHC Class II expression in CD11c 1 cells ( Figure 3B ). The phagocytic ability of lung CD11c 1 cells from PGN-challenged mice was also significantly enhanced compared with saline-treated mice ( Figure  3B ).

Clodronate liposomes (CL-LIP) and saline liposomes (SL-LIP) were administered 2 days before a one-time (acute) exposure to DE or saline control, whereupon mice were killed 5 hours after DE exposure. Macrophage reduction was confirmed by a microscopic review of the hematoxylin and eosin staining of lung sections. Decreases in macrophage infiltrates (. 80%) were observed in CL-LIP-treated mice, compared with SL-LIP-treated animals ( Figure 4 ). Significant reductions in macrophage recovery (. 80%) from BALF in CL-LIP 1 saline and CL-LIP 1 DE animals were evident, compared with respective SL-LIP control mice ( Figure 5A ).",

Exposure to PGN, a major bacterial cell-wall component in porcine and other large animal confinement facilities (29, 30) , also resulted in an influx of activated CD11c 1 /CD11b 1 macrophages. This corroborates previous studies from our group demonstrating a critical role for PGN as a bioactive component for eliciting lung inflammation. This work advances our understanding of the role that the lung macrophage plays in controlling repetitive DE-induced airway inflammatory responses, because airway and lung parenchymal inflammation marked by neutrophil influx became worse after macrophage depletion by clodronate liposomes.

Alveolar macrophages are key innate immune cells that are rapidly activated and orchestrate immune responses after exposure to inhaled environmental toxins, such as organic dust, bacterial products, particulate air pollution, and ozone (9, 13, 31) . Macrophages can produce inflammatory mediators and regulate and resolve chronic inflammatory responses by clearing bacteria, debris, and apoptotic cells (32) . Activated CD11c 1 lung macrophages are a common feature of inflammatory responses after exposure to various viral or bacterial pathogens (12, 16, 20, 33, 34) . Our findings support that repetitive exposure to DE induces an analogous activated CD11c 1 macrophage phenotype, with findings of high CD11b 1 and costimulatory molecule expression and phagocytic ability (Figures 1 and 2) . DE treatment did not augment MHC Class II expression, which is a feature that was also observed in other infectious models (22) . This may represent a regulatory signal or differences in the recycling of the MHC Class II complex (35) . Although lung infections are not a common characteristic of lung disease in farmers, animal facilities are associated with a large diversity of microbial agents, and particularly Gram-positive bacteria (. 80-95%) (29, 30) . Indeed, repetitive exposure to PGN, a major cellwall component of Gram-positive and, to a lesser degree, Gramnegative bacteria, also resulted in similar increases of CD11c 1 macrophage activation.",

Furthermore, the basal release of IL-6, CXCL1, and CXCL2 was significantly increased in CD11c 1 cells isolated from DE-treated mice. This would indicate cellular responsiveness triggered by DE in vivo, because no additional stimulus was used. However, this \"primed\" or activated status was not global because TNF-a responsiveness was dampened, consistent with the so-called tolerant response/ adapted response (1, 36) . However, a hyperresponsiveness in cytokine release with ex vivo, endotoxin-stimulated whole blood from farmers compared with healthy control subjects has been reported (37, 38) . The finding that CD11b expression was dramatically increased in DE-exposed CD11c 1 cells is also important. Although CD11b is well recognized for its role in leukocyte adhesion and activation, phagocytosis, and transmigration (39) , CD11b expression on mononuclear phagocytes within the respiratory tract has been correlated with airway neutrophilia (9, 40) , and the correlation with airway neutrophilia is supported by our studies. Activated macrophages may contribute to DE-induced airway neutrophilia. However, CD11c 1 / CD11b 1 macrophages are more likely responding to the inflammatory insult in an attempt to control and resolve disease. This possibility is supported by our demonstration that without an adequate lung macrophage population, enhanced inflammatory consequences follow repetitive DE exposure (Figures 6 and 7) . Previous work established that the mononuclear cellular aggregates induced by repetitive organic dust exposure comprise an admixture of T and B lymphocytes and phagocytes (6) . Furthermore, DE-induced cellular aggregates consist of live cells (. 98.5%), as opposed to clumps of apoptotic cells based on the common method for detecting DNA fragmentation, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining of tissue sections (data not shown).",

In contrast, the macrophage does not appear to be an important source of neutrophil chemoattractants during DE-induced airway inflammation ( Figure 5 ). This implies that other cell types, such as airway epithelium, may be important sources of DE-induced neutrophil chemoattractants. Furthermore, TNF-a expression was demonstrated in airway epithelial cells in all groups by an immunohistochemical staining procedure ( Figure E3 ). Isolated airway epithelial cells produce substantial amounts of neutrophil chemoattractants after organic dust exposures (25, 41, 42) . Without macrophages to phagocytize and remove the organic dust burden effectively, the airway epithelium may hyperrespond to an increased DE load.",

With repetitive DE exposures, an adaptation-like response occurs, marked by decreased CXCL1 and CXCL2 expression, although neutrophil influx remains elevated (6, 7) . Likewise, in our study, the cytokine/chemokine response diminished and did not differ between groups (data not shown), yet neutrophil influx remained elevated after repetitive DE exposures, and this elevation was further enhanced when macrophages were deleted (Figures 6 and 7) . These observations highlight that the control and regulation of neutrophil recruitment after lung injury are not limited to chemokines, but may include a number of complex factors and networks (e.g., integrins, selectins, proteases, and reactive oxygen species) (43) . Moreover, extracts of organic dusts from agricultural environments exhibit direct chemotactic activity in vitro, and this response has been shown to be independent of endotoxin (44, 45) . This response may also be driven by N-formyl-methionyl peptides, motifs of microbial proteins, which can also trigger neutrophil recruitment via the formylated peptide receptor (46) . Future lines of study should explore other mechanisms of neutrophil influx, and investigate and characterize subpopulations of DE-induced lung macrophages (e.g., M1, M2a, M2b, and M2c) (47) .",

Moreover, PGN, a component of organic dust, elicited a similar lung response, suggesting that PGN may be an important player in complex organic dust-induced pathogenic lung inflammation. Our findings establish that lung macrophages are key in the acute response to DE, and furthermore, lung macrophages are critical in down-regulating inflammatory responses after prolonged, repetitive DE exposures. This information may be important because potential therapies such as macrolides and vitamin D were shown to enhance macrophage phagocytic ability or autophagy (49) (50) (51) (52) . Future studies are warranted to investigate whether promoting macrophage function might ultimately lead to novel approaches to reduce chronic organic dust-induced airway inflammatory consequences in exposed agricultural workers.",
