TEB4 has homologues in many species and has a number of remarkable properties. TEB4 contains a conserved RING (really interesting new gene) finger and 13 predicted transmembrane domains. The RING finger of TEB4 and its homologues is situated at the Nterminus and has the unconventional C4HC3 configuration. The N-terminus of TEB4 is located in the cytosol. We show that the isolated TEB4 RING domain catalyses ubiquitin ligation in vitro in a reaction that is ubiquitin Lys 48 -specific and involves UBC7 (ubi-quitin-conjugating enzyme 7). These properties are reminiscent of E3 enzymes, which are involved in ER-associated protein degradation. TEB4 is an ER degradation substrate itself, promoting its own degradation in a RING finger-and proteasome-dependent manner.",

            "text": "Ubiquitination has been shown to be involved in many cellular processes, ranging from protein quality control, protein turnover, endocytosis, protein transport, signal transduction, protein translation and DNA repair (reviewed in [1] ). Many of these processes are executed by regulated conditional degradation of cytosolic and ER (endoplasmic reticulum)-associated proteins. The attachment of ubiquitin to a target protein involves a cascade of enzymatic reactions, catalysed by three classes of enzymes, including the ubiquitin-activating enzyme E1, ubiquitin-conjugating or E2 enzymes and ubiquitin-protein ligases or E3 enzymes [2, 3] . The concerted action of these enzymes results in polyubiquitination of proteins. Formation of complexes of E3 ubiquitin ligases with E2 UBCs (ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes) provides substrate specificity to the ubiquitination reaction. The fate of a ubiquitinated molecule is influenced not only by the E2-E3 complex involved in the ubiquitination reaction, but also by the site of ubiquitination, the number of ubiquitin moieties attached and the lysine residues of a ubiquitin involved in the linkage.",

            "text": "A RING finger consists of a double-ring structure containing eight metal-binding cysteine and histidine residues that coordinate two zinc ions. RING fingers of E3 ligases can be formed by different configurations of histidine and cysteine residues. The most frequently found 'classical' C3HC4 RING domains are involved in many different cellular events. Examples are c-CBL, which functions in ubiquitin-dependent lysosomal trafficking [7, 18, 19] , and BRCA1 (breast-cancer susceptibility gene 1), which affects cell-cycle progression through its ligase activity by a mechanism that is still elusive [20, 21] . RING fingers with a C3H2C3 configuration are found in membrane-associated E3 ligases catalysing the ubiquitination of degradation substrates occurring in the secretory pathway, especially the ER, and endolysosomal compartments. So far, three ER-resident membrane E3 ligases with C3H2C3 RING fingers have been identified: yeast HRD1/Der3 [8, 9] , its human homologue HRD1 [15] [16] [17] and the mammalian gp78/AMFR [10] . Some proteins carry atypical forms of RING domains, such as the 'double-RING finger' found in Parkin, an E3 ligase implicated in Parkinson's disease. Parkin belongs to the group of proteins that suppress unfolded protein-induced cell death through their E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase activities [22] . A third, frequently occurring RING finger configuration is C4HC3. Several C4HC3 RING-finger proteins, including the yeast Doa10 (degradation of alpha2-10), the murine gammaherpesvirus 68 mK3, the Kaposi sarcoma herpesvirus kK3 and kK5, the myxomavirus M153R and the human MARCH proteins, have been found to possess E3 ubiquitin ligase activity [11] [12] [13] [14] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] .",

Since TEB4 is encoded in a chromosome region associated with a neurodegenerative disorder, namely the Cri-du-chat syndrome, the expression of the protein was investigated in a homogenate of human brain tissues. Detection of TEB4 by Western blotting using a TEB4-specific antiserum revealed a major polypeptide band of approx. 97 kDa (Figure 2A , lane 1). The antiserum did not cross-react with yeast Doa10 (Figure 2A , lane 2) but did recognize the TEB4 fusion protein that was used to generate the antiserum (Figure 2A, lane 3) .",

We have shown previously that the RING domain sequence in the human and yeast ER-tethered E3 ubiquitin ligase Hrd1p interacts with UBC7 and generates a robust activity for the K48-specific linkage of ubiquitin to ubiquitin [17] . We produced the TEB4 RING domain as a GST-fusion protein in bacteria and tested the purified protein for its interaction with UBC7 with a similar in vitro ubiquitination assay. Similar to what we observed with the GST-Hrd1 RING fusion, the inclusion of GST-TEB4 RING domain in an in vitro UBC7-dependent ubiquitination reaction also produced a reaction product that migrated in SDS gels with the mobility expected of a ubiquitin dimer ( Figure 7A , lane 4). This activity was absent when UBC7 was replaced by UBC5, UBC2 or UBC3 (results not shown). The formation of the reaction product is dependent on the presence of Lys 48 in ubiquitin ( Figure 7A , lane 5), consistent with it being a K48-linked ubiquitin dimer. To demonstrate directly the formation of a K48-linked ubiquitin dimer, we analysed the tryptic digests of the reaction product by MS. For comparison, we performed a similar analysis for ubiquitin. In a K48-linked ubiquitin dimer, K48 that is linked to the C-terminal carboxyl of another ubiquitin becomes resistant to tryptic digestion [40] and retains minimally, through an isopeptide linkage, the two C-terminal glycine residues of the other ubiquitin, when all other sites are cleaved. This isopeptide has a unique mass of 1460.75 Da that is not found in ubiquitin. In our analysis, we detected a peptide with a mass of 1460.78 Da, in addition to all the peptides that are also found in the single [34] was incubated at 30 \u2022 C for 1 min to generate UBC7-ubiquitin thioester (UBC7-Ub). The reaction was stopped by the addition of EDTA to a final concentration of 10 mM. The mixture was then incubated at 30 \u2022 C for 15 min with the addition of 40 \u00b5M of a truncated ubiquitin that lacks the C-terminal Gly-Gly residues and 10 \u00b5M of RING proteins as indicated. At the end of the incubation, the reaction was stopped by the addition of non-reducing SDS sample buffer. Proteins were separated by SDS/PAGE and proteins bearing the Oregon Green fluorescence (UBC7-Ub thioester and ubiquitin dimer) were visualized on a fluorescence gel scanner. Free ubiquitin migrated at the dye front and its fluorescence is masked by the presence of Bromophenol Blue in the SDS sample buffer and is not shown here.",

We next addressed whether the activity required one or both ubiquitin molecules to be linked by a thioester to UBC7. To test these two possibilities, we generated two distinct forms of ubiquitin, one that can form a thioester linkage with UBC7 but lacks K48 (Ub-K48R) and another ubiquitin that lacks the C-terminal Gly-Gly residues (Ub 74 ) and cannot be activated by the ubiquitin-activating enzyme. To distinguish these two forms of ubiquitin, we extended the N-terminus of Ub-K48R with an MCHHHHHH sequence and attached a fluorescent Oregon Green label at the cysteine residue, using a previously described procedure [34] . Figure 7 (C) shows that the UBC7-linked Oregon Green-labelled Ub-K48R can be transferred to Ub 74 in a reaction that is dependent on the presence of either GST-HRD1 RING or GST-TEB4 RING. The reaction requires the presence of K48 in Ub 74 , since a similar ubiquitin dimer was not formed with the K48R mutant of this truncated ubiquitin (results not shown). These results suggest that the ubiquitin dimer is formed by a reaction as depicted in Figure 7 (B) and is reminiscent of the ubiquitin-ubiquitin linkage reaction during polyubiquitin chain elongation.",

Moreover, Doa10 and Hrd1p are together capable of suppressing growth defects due to malfunctioning of the Cdc48p-Npl4p-Ufd1p complex related to a temperature-sensitive mutation in Npl4p [46] .

MEKK1 is a cytosolic protein catalysing the ubiquitination of ERK-1 and -2 [48] , members of the mitogenactivated protein kinase family. Except for a similar RING motif, MEKK1 does not demonstrate any obvious similarity to the MARCH proteins or TEB4 with respect to structure or subcellular localization. Interestingly, the MARCH proteins share several structural and functional properties with the viral K3 proteins [13] . Substrate specificities of the MARCH proteins and the viral E3 ligases demonstrate considerable overlap, with MHC class I molecules being one of the common substrates.",

Moreover, TEB4 catalyses its own degradation in a RING finger-and proteasomedependent manner and acts in conjunction with UBC7. These observations, combined with the association of many other C4HC3 RING-containing E3 ligases with protein degradation, led us to investigate whether TEB4 might have a similar function. Surface expression of MHC class I, Fas, TfR, CD4 and B7.2 molecules, however, was not influenced by overexpression of TEB4 or its RING finger mutant (results not shown). Previously, we have shown that dislocation and degradation of MHC class I heavy chains in the context of human cytomegalovirus US11 is ubiquitin-dependent [32, 34] . The E2 and E3 enzymes involved in this process remain to be identified. Expression of either wild-type or RING-finger mutant TEB4 had no effect on US11-mediated degradation of class I heavy chains (results not shown).",

HRD1, gp78, TEB4 and Doa10p are predicted to contain 6, 7, 13 and 13 membrane-spanning sequences respectively. In view of the function of HRD1 and gp78 in ER-associated degradation [10, 17] , one could speculate that their transmembrane domains might form part of a channel that mediates retrograde movement of substrates from the ER into the cytosol. These E3 ligases might associate with Sec61 alpha and beta translocon subunits that are also believed to be involved in dislocation of ER proteins [54] [55] [56] . These E3 ligases may also act in conjunction with Derlin-1, a protein that has recently been found to be required for US11 (but not US2)-dependent dislocation of MHC class I heavy chains [57, 58] . Further studies will be required to investigate whether multimembrane-spanning E3 ligases indeed form part of a 'dislocon'. This study was supported by grant no.
