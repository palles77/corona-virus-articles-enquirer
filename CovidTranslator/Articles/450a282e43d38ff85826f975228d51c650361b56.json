Pair-approximation models and individual-based network simulation have been used extensively to model contact networks with nontrivial properties. In this paper, using a continuous time Markov chain, we start from the exact formulation of a simple epidemic model on an arbitrary contact network and rigorously derive and prove some known results that were previously mainly justified based on some biological hypotheses. The main result of the paper is the illustration of the link between graph automorphisms and the process of lumping whereby the number of equations in a system of linear differential equations can be significantly reduced. The main advantage of lumping is that the simplified lumped system is not an approximation of the original system but rather an exact version of this. For a special class of graphs, we show how the lumped system can be obtained by using graph automorphisms. Finally, we discuss the advantages and possible applications of exact epidemic models and lumping.",

The main aim of many models is to gain insight into how diseases transmit and to identify the most effective strategies for their prevention and control. The early work by Kermack and McKendrick (1927) forms the basis of differential-equation-based models which lie at the heart of modern quantitative epidemiology. Traditionally, mathematical epidemiology is based on differential equation models (Anderson and May 1991; Diekmann and Heesterbeek 2000) and these operate on the basis of some strong simplifying assumptions about the behaviour of the individuals and the biology of the disease. While these models do not explicitly model contact-network structure, they allow us to improve our understanding of the disease transmission process and to derive threshold quantities such as the basic reproduction number R 0 and critical vaccination threshold (Diekmann and Heesterbeek 2000) in terms of key biological parameters such as rate of infection and infectious period.",

In most cases, this is highly heterogeneous with strong correlations and non-trivial large scale structure (Hufnagel et al. 2004; Kao et al. 2006; Kiss et al. 2006a) which can make it difficult to use compartmental differential equations. In an attempt to increase model accuracy, in the context of ecological and epidemiological modelling, various pair-approximation (Keeling 1999; Keeling et al. 1997; Rand 1999; Sato et al. 1994; van Baalen 2000) and individual-based models (Keeling and Eames 2005) have been developed. These more sophisticated models can more accurately capture contact network properties but often at the expense of limited analytical tractability. Pair-approximation models focus on the interaction between pairs of individuals and assume that changes in the status of individuals depends on the status of their neighbours. A key factor in such models is the closing relation which is used to truncate and close equations at the level of pairs. This is a useful approach which works well for certain classes of networks, although its precise domain of applicability remains unknown.",

However, this comes at the price of little analytical tractability, unless some strong limiting assumptions (i.e. proportionate mixing), are made. Individual-based network models fall in two broad categories. First, those where network data is available and can be used to specify the contact network (Dent et al. 2008; Green et al. 2006; Kao et al. 2006; Kiss et al. 2006a) , and second, theoretical network models that focus on understanding the impact of specific network properties on outbreak threshold, final epidemic size or prevalence level and the efficacy of control measures (Keeling 1999 (Keeling , 2005 Kiss et al. 2005 Kiss et al. , 2008 May and Lloyd 2001) . The latter models are used to establish some general principles while the former are driven, at least partially, by the real-time predictive modelling of human (SARS, Hufnagel et al. 2004; Lipsitch et al. 2003; Meyers et al. 2005 ; and the current swine-flu outbreak, Smith et al. 2009 ) and animal disease (foot-and-mouth disease, Ferguson et al. 2001; Kao et al. 2006; Avian Influenza, Dent et al. 2008) outbreaks.",

            "text": "Modelling disease transmission in finite populations using stochastic simulations alone poses many challenges. For example, to tease apart rare events from average system behaviour many replicate simulations are needed. A more rigorous modelling alternative as discussed by Keeling and Ross (2008) is the use of Markov chains (Kemeny and Snell 1976) where the future state of the population depends on current state only (memoryless process) and the probability of the population being in any of the possible states at a given time is determined by a system of linear differential equations that can be constructed based on the rates of transition between states. In this paper, using a continuous time Markov chain (CTMC), we start from the exact formulation of a simple epidemic model on an arbitrary contact network. We rigorously derive and prove some known results that were previously mainly justified directly from biological hypotheses rather than being deduced from an exact system of equations (Rand 1999) . We revisit lumping (see Appendix A in Heesterbeek 2000 and Filliger and Hongler 2008; Jacobi and G\u00f6rnerup 2009) and illustrate how graph automorphisms can be used to guide the lumping process which leads to a significant reduction in the large number of equations (2 N \u2212 1 for a model with two disease states, such as the SIS model, on a network with N nodes) of the original exact system. For a special class of graphs, we illustrate how lumping can be directly inferred from graph automorphisms and we combine lumping on a complete graph with simple mathematical techniques to show that, in the limit of large networks, the solution of the exact Markov chain model converges to that of the ODE-based mean-field model. In addition, we discuss the advantages, disadvantages and possible applications of exact epidemic models and lumping.",

Here, we only consider networks with bi-directional edges and without self-loops. This requirement translates to the following two constraints upon G: G = G T and g ii = 0. The dynamics of transmission has two key stages: transmission of the disease and recovery of infectious individuals. Infection starting from an initial index case is transmitted at rate \u03c4 across every (S, I ) edge. This is followed by the recovery of infectious individuals at rate \u03b3 . Upon recovery, infectious individuals become susceptible again. Both infection and recovery are modelled as independent Poisson processes. For example, in a small time interval \u03b4t, a susceptible individual with k I infectious neighbours becomes infected with probability 1 \u2212 exp(\u2212k I \u03c4 \u03b4t). Similarly, 1 \u2212 exp(\u2212\u03b3 \u03b4t) represents the recovery probability of a single infectious individual, and this is independent of the status of its neighbours.",

The state space of system is given by S = {S, I } N or S = {0, 1} N and the transmission dynamics on the network can be formulated in terms of a transition matrix between all possible states. In the case of continuous time, this matrix is also known as the infinitesimal generator matrix (Brauer et al. 2008; Daley and Gani 1999; Kemeny and Snell 1976) . Based on the generator matrix, it is straightforward to write down the Kolmogorov differential equations that uniquely determine the probability of the system being in a particular state at a given time (Brauer et al. 2008; Daley and Gani 1999) . However, in practice even for small network size, this approach becomes unfeasible due to the large number of equations (i.e. 2 N \u2212 1). As detailed in the introduction, using various techniques, it is possible to reduce the number of states (i.e. number of equations) and derive models that are either equivalent to the original system or are approximations that in the limit of large graphs (i.e. N \u2192 \u221e) become exact.",

Kurtz (1970) proved that the Markov chain given by the lumped system converges in probability to the solution of the mean-field equation. This statement is stronger than Theorem 1 since it implies that not only the expected value converges to the solution of the mean-field equation but also the distribution. However, the proof of this general statement uses abstract tools, namely an extension of Trotter's operator semigroup approximation theorem. Later Kurtz (1971) formalised the statement in a more abstract setting and proved a central limit theorem using martingale theory. Our proof of Theorem 1 is an alternative proof that does not use abstract semigroup and martingale theory and it is based on ideas outlined in the Appendix A in Diekmann and Heesterbeek (2000) . ",

We now consider the linear system given by Eq. 1, where matrix P has a special block tridiagonal structure. In the previous general case, the state space was given as the set {1, 2, . . . , n}. For the epidemic model, the state space has 2 N elements but instead of the set {1, 2, . . . , 2 N }, we denote the state space by S as given in Sect. 2. The reason for this notation is motivated by the special structure of the state space S = \u222aS k which is worth conserving throughout the lumping process. This is essential when using the solution of the lumped system\u1e8b = Bx to determine the expected values [S](t) and [I ](t). There are choices of lumping such that the lumped system\u1e8b = Bx cannot be used to determine [S](t) and [I ](t). For example, the trivial lumping, when T is a row matrix full of ones, is not a useful lumping. In this case, all variables are lumped into one single variable and the lumping of matrix A (i.e. B) will be a single row and single column matrix with a single zero entry. This just shows that the system is closed and that at any one point in time, the probabilities of being in any of the specified 2 N states sum to one. In order to use the lumped system to determine [S](t) and [I ](t), the states with different number of I nodes cannot be lumped together.

Let S k i 1 \u2208 L k r , S k\u22121 j 1 \u2208 L k\u22121 p and let z = A k i 1 j 1 = 0.

Moreover, according to Eq. 2 the number of I nodes in the state S k\u22121 j 1 that are connected to the node numbered by u is equal to z/\u03c4 (see the definition of matrix A). Now let us consider another element in the lumping class L k\u22121 p , that is let S k\u22121 j 2 \u2208 L k\u22121 p . Then there is an automorphism of the graph that takes the state S k\u22121 j 1 into the state S k\u22121 j 2 . Let us apply this automorphism to the state S k i 1 . Then we get the state S k i 2 \u2208 L k r . This means that the relation between the states S k i 2 and S k\u22121 j 2 is the same as the relation of the states S k i 1 and S k\u22121 j 1 . Hence we have A k i 2 j 2 = z.

Outer nodes have only within household connections while inner nodes have within household as well as connections to other households. We consider the simplest case where each household has two nodes, an inner and outer node. The inner nodes of all households form a complete graph with N /2 nodes (N is an even number), and every outer node is connected to an inner node. Thus the degree of all inner nodes is N 2 and the degree of all outer nodes is 1. We will show that in the case of this household-type graph the 2 N -dimensional system given by Eq. 1 can be lumped to an N /2+3 3 -dimensional system. The automorphism group of this graph is the permutation group S N/2 , since an automorphism can permutate the inner nodes in an arbitrary way, and once the automorphism is given on the inner nodes, its effect on the outer nodes is determined uniquely. In order to determine the lumping classes let us note first that there may be four different types of households in this graph: S I households, in which the inner node is S and the outer node is I, I S households, SS households and I I households. Therefore two states of the whole graph can commute through an automorphism if and only if the number of S I, I S, SS and I I type households is the same in the two distinct states of the complete system. Hence, to obtain all different states we have to choose (with repetition) N /2 households out of the four different types. Thus, the number of different states (i.e. states where the number of SS, S I, I S and I I -type households is different but their distribution can be arbitrary) can be obtained as the number of combinations with repetitions: 4+N /2\u22121",

However, lumping based on intuition alone can become unwieldy even for a relatively simple graph such as the cycle graph (C N ) where N nodes are connected in a close chain such that each node connects to the two nearest neighbours only. The automorphisms of the cycle graph can be given in terms of all possible rotations and reflections of the graph. These together, N of each, give 2N automorphisms, and hence |Aut (C N )| = 2N . The automorphism group of the cycle graph is also known as the dihedral group D N . Carrying out lumping based on intuition alone is prone to error and it is desirable to use the automorphism group to work out lumping classes rigorously. For small graphs, these calculations can be done on paper or for larger graphs calculations can be easily carried out using some suitable software or programming language. To illustrate the process, let us consider the case of a cycle graph with N = 5 nodes. Here, |D 5 | = 10 is made up of five rotations including the identity and five reflections. The lumping classes L i (i = 1, 2, . . . , m), with m yet to be determined, have to be such that for \u2200i = 1, 2, . . . , m, \u2203 k \u2208 {0, 1, . . . , N } such that L i \u2286 S k (as required by Definition 2).

Exploring the special block tridiagonal nature of the transition matrix P, we have rigorously derived mean-field approximations that previously have only been derived heuristically based on biological hypotheses. The key result of the paper is the precise formulation of lumping in terms of graph automorphisms and their group. Lumping is a powerful method that can be used to reduce large linear ODE models to a tractable number of equations which are still exact and can be used to evaluate the time evolution of quantities of interest as required by the specific modelling context. For example, Table 1 illustrates that for graphs with a high number of automorphisms, the exact equations given by Eq. 1 can be more effectively lumped into fewer equations that are easier to analyse.",

            "text": "For the complete and star graph, the time evolution of [i] = [I ]/N is illustrated in Fig. 1 . This plot is based on the lumped system which is used to compute the expected level of prevalence over time. This is in contrast with many such results which are either based on some form of mean-field equations or individual-based network simulations. Figure 1 shows that the complete graph allows the infection to spread very quickly to a high proportion of nodes. For the star graph, the spread is much slower and only a much smaller proportion of the network will become infected. Here, the difference between prevalence levels can be mainly explained by the marked difference in average connectivity, N +2 4 for the complete graph versus 2 \u2212 2/N for the star graph. The use of lumping enabled us to compare the disease spread on different graphs and to investigate the effect of the structure of the graph on the spread of the infection. Based on mean-field approximations, equations for the prevalence level can be derived. For the complete and star graph, these read as follows: It is worth noting that even for a small graph with N = 50, the numerical values of the exact solution [i](t) and that of the mean-field approximation\u0129(t) are close to each other. In the case of a complete graph, the quasi steady state of [i] is 0.9796 and the steady state of\u0129 is lim t\u2192\u221e\u0129comp (t) = 1 \u2212 \u03b3 N \u03c4 = 0.9800, when \u03b3 = 0.1 and \u03c4 = 0.1. In the case of a star graph with the same parameters, these values are 0.4967 versus 0.4992. In Fig. 2 , we show that even for small networks N = 20, results from the mean-field and exact models agree well, with a small further increase in N making the two almost indistinguishable. This is somewhat in contrast with the general belief that mean-field and pair-approximation models become exact in the limit of large graphs. Due to their great flexibility network models are used widely in many different areas ranging from neuro-networks to evolutionary dynamics. For example, Broom and Rycht\u00e1\u0159 (2008) have recently considered the fixation probability of a mutant on special classes of non-directed graphs and have shown that the total number of mutantresident formations is proportional to the inverse of the cardinality of Aut (G) (i.e. |Aut (G)|). In this paper, in line with results derived by Broom and Rycht\u00e1\u0159 (2008) , we have also illustrated how the richness of the automorphism group impacts on the reduction in dimensionality of the exact system (see Table 1 ). For graphs with a high number of automorphisms, such as completely connected or star graphs, the 2 N equations of the exact system can be reduced to O(N ). It is worth noting that for a more complex dynamics such as an S I R model, the number of equations in the reduced system on a completely connected graph will be of O(N 2 ). While for graphs with less symmetry (i.e. smaller number of automorphisms) the reduction in dimensionality will not be as significant, the use of automorphism-driven lumping still provides a rigorous way to identify the lumping classes. Even though constructing the automorphism group of an arbitrary graph is a challenging problem and belongs to the class NP of computational complexity (Brandes and Erlebach 2005) , there are many special classes of graphs which are both relevant from an application point of view and possess a computable or known automorphism group. More importantly exact models for small populations such as households, hospital wards, schools, workplaces and small holding farms can play an important role in accounting correctly for stochastic effects that are more important in small populations. Therefore, exploiting the structure of the graph is key when formulating models where the derivation of analytical results is needed to strengthen or confirm simulation results.",

For example the number of [SS] pairs decreases due to infection from outside the pair (i.e. [SS I ] triples). Using simple heuristic reasoning and by accounting for all within-and outside-pair transitions the following Lemma is obtained.

Hence L 2 = S 1 . This is a desirable situation since all elements in S 1 can be lumped together to give a new variable. The situation changes when S 2 is considered S 2 = {(SSS I I ), (SS I S I ), (S I SS I ), (I SSS I ), (SS I I S), (S I S I S), (I SSI S), (S I I SS), (I SI SS), (I I SSS)}.

In this case the orbit of (SSS I I ) only captures 5 out of the 10 possible states in S 2 . This means that rotations and reflections map (SSS I I ) onto identical configurations and this increases the number of lumping classes and the reduction in dimensionality of the system is not so significant.
