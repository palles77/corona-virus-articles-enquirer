Thus, emergency nurses' disaster nursing core competencies are essential for coping with disasters. The purpose of the study reported here was to identify factors influencing the disaster nursing core competencies of emergency nurses. Methods: A survey was conducted among 231 emergency nurses working in 12 hospitals in South Korea. Data were collected on disaster-related experience, attitude, knowledge, and disaster nursing core competencies by means of a questionnaire. Results: In multiple regression analysis, disaster-related experience exerted the strongest influence on disaster nursing core competencies, followed by disaster-related knowledge. The explanatory power of these factors was 25.6%, which was statistically significant (F = 12.189, p b 0.001). Conclusions: These findings indicate that the disaster nursing core competencies of emergency nurses could be improved through education and training programs that enhance their disaster preparedness. The nursing profession needs to participate actively in the development of disaster nursing education and training programs.",

For example, the 9/11 terrorist attack in the U.S. triggered discussions on roles and situations for coping with mass disasters, and there has been recognition of the need to educate and train health care workers, including nurses, in preparation against mass attacks (Gebbie & Qureshi, 2002; Williams, Nocera, & Casteel, 2008; Wisniewski, Dennik-Champion, & Peltier, 2004) . When a disaster occurs, nurses should be able to assess and meet patients' care needs and to utilize available resources in collaboration with other professionals. Accordingly, they should be equipped with knowledge and abilities to keep themselves safe from disasters, and they need to develop disaster nursing core competencies to carry out nursing activities during and after a disaster (Gebbie & Qureshi, 2002) . With this urge to develop a set of core competencies for disaster nursing, the International Council of Nursing (ICN) launched a framework of disaster nursing competencies in 2009 World Health Organization and International Council of Nurses (WHO & ICN, 2009 ). The framework consists of four areas corresponding to the four stages of a disaster (prevention, preparedness, response, and recovery states) and a total of 130 items by which nurses play numerous and multiple vital roles in disaster care and management (WHO & ICN, 2009) .",

However, despite previous research and efforts to improve disaster nursing core competencies through education, many studies have reported that most nurses remain inadequately prepared for disaster and lack confidence in their abilities to respond to disaster (Baack & Alfred, 2013; Fung, Lai, & Loke, 2009; Fung, Loke, & Lai, 2008; Loke & Fung, 2014; Whetzel, Walker-Cillo, Chan, & Trivett, 2013) . This suggests that education and training in disaster nursing remain insufficient. Therefore, it is essential to identify the factors that influence disaster nursing core competencies so that effective nurses' education and training programs about disaster may be developed and provided in more efficient ways to prepare nurses for disaster. In particular, as the ED is the first place where patients are admitted, examined, and treated in a disaster, factors affecting the core competencies of emergency nurses providing nursing services to such patients using their professional expertise to reduce the risk posed to life and health in this context may be informative (Hammond, Arbon, & Gebbie, 2011; Whetzel et al., 2013) .

The content validity of this dichotomous scale was rated (1: \"Not relevant\"; 4: \"Very relevant\") by a professor of nursing and an ED head nurse in this study. The content validity index (calculated as the ratio of the number of items assigned 3 or 4 points to the total number of items assessed by two experts) of the scale was 0.90. One point was assigned for an item if an individual had experienced that item and 0 if an individual had not experienced that item. Therefore, the total score ranged from 0 to 7. A high score indicates considerable disaster-related experience. The Kuder-Richardson 20 (KR 20) coefficient (a measure of reliability) of this scale was 0.765 in a preliminary survey among 12 emergency nurses, and 0.840 in this study.",

In this study, the participants' mean score was 3.05 out of 5 on the measure of these competencies. In a previous study of Park and Lee (2015) that used the same tool, the reported mean was 3.45. This may be due to the timing of Park and Lee's study (2015) , as they collected data at a hospital just after the tragic sinking of the Sewol Ferry in Korea. At that time, the Center for Disaster Relief Training and Research was opened in Korea, and began to conduct workshops on local hospitals' preparation for disasters, as well as simulation education on disaster medicine and procedures. Thus, the level of disaster nursing core competencies may have been temporarily increased at the time of the Park and Lee's study (2015) . The present results suggest, however, that nurses need continuous education and training to maintain these competencies. No standardized tool exists by which to measure emergency nurses' core disaster-related competencies. Thus, the present research utilized tools developed within other Korean study. This highlights the need to develop such standardized tools in future research. The present results also show that disaster nursing core competencies differed in accordance with position and wage, among the participants' general characteristics. Specifically, competencies were higher among those in higher positions and those earning higher wages. In addition, these competencies showed a significant positive correlation with age and clinical experience. This is probably because greater work experience is related to the development of nurses' job competency (O'Leary, 2012) .",

This suggests that disaster nursing core competencies are not enhanced proportionally to work experience or position; rather, disaster-related experience and education are essential for disaster nursing core competencies. A number of academic societies have been established and nursing care provision systems developed for post-disaster response around the globe, especially as natural and man-made disasters have increased in recent times (Yamamoto, 2013) . This has also encouraged the development of disaster nursing educational programs and curricula in public health (Loke & Fung, 2014) . Nevertheless, recent studies (Baack & Alfred, 2013; Loke & Fung, 2014; Whetzel et al., 2013; Yan, Turale, Stone, & Petrini, 2015) have still reported inadequate disaster nursing competencies and insufficient disaster nursing training. With only two institutions specialized in disaster management education, Korea is relatively poor in terms of resources for training disaster nursing specialists. Accordingly, because most nurses may lack disaster-related experience, regular education and training on disasters is essential for them to accumulate such experience and to gain insight into the reality of disaster response.",

Since the ICN launched its Framework of Disaster Nursing Competencies in 2009, nurses' competencies in this area have been highlighted regarding disaster preparedness. For instance, a previous study (Baack & Alfred, 2013) on the preparedness and perceived competence in managing disasters comprising 620 nurses in Texas found that most nurses was not confident in their ability to respond to disasters. Korea has recently experienced a number of disasters, including not only the tragic sinking of the Sewol Ferry (a man-made disaster) but also natural disasters, such as the Middle East respiratory syndrome that threatens the state and the people. Medical institutions play core roles in responding to casualties in the event of a disaster. Education and training regarding disasters helps nurses make practical estimations of how a disaster situation is progressing. It also provides them with opportunities to prepare for similar situations in the future (Hammond et al., 2011; Whetzel et al., 2013) . Disaster nursing core competencies are essential for emergency nurses, who have to provide urgent nursing services to a large number of patients in the event of a disaster. However, although a range of disaster-related studies have been conducted among nurses, very little research exists regarding emergency nurses' disaster-related competencies. The findings of this study provide useful basic information showing the necessity of regular disaster-related education and training programs for emergency nurses so that they can cope with disaster situations effectively and carry out their roles confidently.",
