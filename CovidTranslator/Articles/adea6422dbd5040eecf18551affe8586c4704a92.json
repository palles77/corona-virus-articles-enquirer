The combination of pneumonia and influenza is the ninth leading cause of death overall and the most common cause of infectious death in the USA, causing an estimated 50 000 deaths in 2010. 1 This number is likely an underestimate because many deaths caused directly by CAP are coded as sepsis, for which pneumonia is the most common source, 2 or attributed to an underlying condition (such as cancer and Alzheimer's disease), for which pneumonia is the terminal event. For example, the proximate cause of death in >40% of patients with dementia is pneumonia. 3 Lower respiratory tract infection remains the leading cause of infectious death in the world as well, exceeding deaths from tuberculosis, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and malaria combined. 4 CAP is the most common reason for hospital admission of adults in the USA. 5 It is a common cause of severe complications, including septic shock, 2 acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and acute renal failure. Even in survivors, hospital admission for CAP has been associated with increased subsequent mortality and with accelerated cognitive decline.",

Erythrocytes crossing the alveolar-capillary membrane in the stage of red hepatization result in hemoptysis. Inflammatory mediators released by macrophages and the newly recruited neutrophils cause an alveolar capillary leak equivalent to that demonstrated for ARDS, although initially localized in pneumonia. Radiographic infiltrates and rales detectable on auscultation are a direct result of the alveolar-capillary leak syndrome. Hypoxemia results from alveolar filling but may be exacerbated by paralysis of the hypoxemic vasoconstriction that would normally occur with fluid-filled alveoli by some bacterial pathogens. Increased respiratory drive as part of the systemic inflammatory response syndrome leads to respiratory alkalosis. Decreased compliance due to capillary leak, hypoxemia, increased respiratory drive, increased secretions and occasionally infection-related bronchospasm all lead to dyspnea and, if severe enough, respiratory failure.",

The gray hepatization phase corresponds with successful containment of the infection and improvement in gas exchange, with restoration of the normal hypoxic vasoconstrictor response. This classic pattern does not apply to pneumonia of all etiologies, especially viral or Pneumocystis pneumonia. If microaspiration is the underlying mechanism, a bronchopneumonia pattern is seen and the corresponding phases may not occur. settings such as nursing homes and chronic dialysis units. An episode of aspiration weeks prior to presentation without intervening medical attention is the classic predisposition for anaerobic pneumonia, often complicated by empyema as well. Otherwise, anaerobes play a minor role in usual CAP. HCAP was proposed as a discrete entity with the goal of identifying those patients who were more likely to receive initially inappropriate antibiotic therapy, and have an associated higher mortality risk. 27, 28 While early observational studies of culture-positive cases suggest improved outcome from broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy in persons with HCAP risk factors, 27, 28 prospective studies using the same definition find lower rates of antibiotic-resistant pathogens and many culture-negative cases. 26, 29, 30 Even more concerning were reports of adverse outcomes among persons with HCAP risk factors treated with broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy. 26, 31 Rather than using the original definition derived from healthcareassociated bacteremia, a prospective multicenter study identified six independent risk factors (Table 28-8) for pneumonia caused by pathogens resistant to the usual inpatient antibiotic regimens recommended by Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA)/ American Thoracic Society (ATS) guidelines. 26 While the risk factors were similar to the original, the incidence of drug-resistant pathogens was not significantly increased until three or more risk factors are present. A separate analysis specifically for MRSA found that presence of one MRSAspecific risk factor (prior MRSA infection/colonization, chronic hemodialysis, or heart failure) and another pneumonia-specific risk factor may warrant MRSA coverage (but not dual anti-pseudomonal antibiotics). Importantly, this new definition would result in significantly fewer patients receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics than the original HCAP definition. 9",

Patients with severe CAP requiring ICU admission 34 and/or HCAP risk factors 26 started on broad-spectrum antibiotics have the clearest indication for extensive diagnostic testing, including attempts at obtaining sputum culture. The yield of testing is higher in the critically ill CAP patient, possibly because endotracheal intubation allows direct sampling of the lower respiratory tract. Other indications and the corresponding appropriate tests are listed in Table 28 -10. 9 Biomarkers have been used in an attempt to differentiate viral from bacterial pneumonia. The best validated is procalcitonin (PCT). 10, 35 This pro-hormone is elevated in uncontrolled bacterial infections and actively suppressed by the interferon response induced in many viral pneumonias. However, PCT may be low in atypical pathogen CAP as well and is clearly elevated in severe viral CAP, such as seen in the 2009-2010 influenza A pandemic, with or without evidence of superimposed bacterial pneumonia. C-reactive protein (CRP) is more nonspecific than PCT in CAP but may be a better predictor of treatment failure. 14 Treatment Almost every antibiotic approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in the past four decades has an indication for CAP. In general, keys to appropriate therapy are adequate coverage of Strep. pneumoniae and the atypical bacterial pathogens (Mycoplasma, Chlamydophila, Legionella). The recommended regimens from the IDSA/ATS guideline are listed in Table 28 -11. 9 European guidelines differ in that \u03b2-lactam antibiotics (typically amoxicillin) remain the recommended agent for mild-moderate CAP. 36, 37 A recent study from the Netherlands suggests that a strategy of empirical treatment for moderately severe CAP with \u03b2-lactam monotherapy is noninferior to either \u03b2-lactam-macrolide combination therapy or fluoroquinolone monotherapy. 38 The primary factors to discriminate among the antibiotic options, therefore, should be local resistance patterns in community organisms, recent antibiotic use, which increases the risk of class resistance, 39 ",
