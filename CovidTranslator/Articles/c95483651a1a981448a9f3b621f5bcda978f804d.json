White Leghorn specific-pathogen-free chickens were immunized with EV71 antigens and a specific isolated immunoglobulin (IgY) was prepared from the chicken egg yolk. IgY was further purified and characterized by SDS-PAGE, ELISA, western blotting and bidirectional immune agar diffusion testing. The antiviral activity and dose-response of the IgY were determined by assessing the cytopathic effect in rhabdomyosarcoma (RD) cells in vitro. It was indicated that the levels of IgY were increased at day 7, peaked at week 7 and were maintained at a higher level for 4 weeks following immunization when compared with the negative control. The results of western blotting and bidirectional immune agar diffusion testing revealed that the IgY had cross-binding properties in EV71 and CVA16 strains through targeting the envelope proteins (VP0, VP1 and VP3) of EV71 and CVA16. Neutralization assay results indicated that the infectivity of EV71 and CVA16 strains in RD cells was cross-blocked by IgY in a dose-dependent manner. To conclude, these findings indicate that IgY has cross antiviral activity against EV71 and CVA16 in vitro, and could potentially be developed as a passive immunotherapy for EV71-and CVA16-induced HFMD.",

The major viruses that cause HFMD are EV71 and CVA16. EV71-induced HFMD is more serious out of the two because it causes a neurological syndrome of the central nervous system and may lead to mortality (3) . CVA16-induced HFMD usually leads to milder symptoms, and the morbidity and mortality are lower compared with EV71-induced HFMD (4) . However, EV71 is not the only major cause of HFMD outbreak. Zhu et al (5) conducted a 12-month follow-up of 1,704 patients with clinically confirmed HFMD and revealed that only 36 cases (2.1%) were identified as EV71-induced HFMD, 577 cases (33.9%) were CVA16-induced HFMD, 588 cases (34.5%) were caused by other enteroviruses and 503 cases (29.5%) were not associated with any enterovirus. Furthermore, some patients with severe and fatal CVA16-induced HFMD have been reported in the United States (6) , France (7), Japan (8) and China (9, 10) .",

Inspired by previous inactivated polio vaccines, the development of an active immunoassay for inactivated EV71 vaccine has been making rapid progress (19) . In December 2015, the China Food and Drug Administration approved two inactivated EV71 vaccines for the prevention of severe HFMD (20) , and a CVA16 vaccine is presently being developed in China (21) . However, these vaccines only provide protection against HFMD caused by a single enterovirus. The clinical symptoms of HFMD caused by CVA16 and EV71 strains are indistinguishable, and they may cause outbreaks alternately or simultaneously in Asian countries (22) . EV71 can recombine viral genes with CVA16 and produce novel viral variants. In 2008, a large-scale outbreak of HFMD caused by EV71 and CVA16 recombinant virus occurred in the city of Fuyang, China (23) . Therefore, it is necessary to develop effective therapeutic agents or therapies for treatment of EV71-and CVA16-induced HFMD.",

The monoclonal antibody produced by hybridoma cells is another form of passive immunity that is effective (27) . However, when the antibody is injected into humans, immune rejection typically occurs (28) . Immunoglobulin Y (IgY), which is extracted from the egg yolk of immunized poultry, is an excellent antibody source for passive immunity (29) . Compared with the IgG from mammals, IgY is more stable (30, 31) , easy to collect (32) , has a high yield (33) and does not react with rheumatoid factors, complement components or mammalian Fc receptors in human serum (34) . At present, the application of IgY in the diagnosis and treatment of human diseases has become a research hotspot, particularly regarding infections caused by Helicobacter pylori (35) , Vibrio cholerae (36) and other bacterial infections, as well as the infections by human rotavirus (37) , severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (38) and other viruses. IgY can also be used for the preparation of diagnostic antibodies for immunohistochemistry, ELISA (39) , western blotting and other diagnostic techniques.",

As indicated in Fig. 1 , the levels of S-IgY were detected at day 7, peaked at week 7 and were maintained at a higher level compared with C-IgY for a total of 4 weeks. The levels of S-IgY began to decrease gradually at week 11 following the initial immunization, whereas the levels of the C-IgY group did not change significantly over the experimental period, suggesting that the isolated IgY is specific in its response to EV71 immunization. Furthermore, the levels of IgY in group A and group B chicken egg yolks were elevated after immunization (Table II) . From these findings it was concluded that the S-IgY from week 7 chicken egg yolks after EV71 antigen immunization would be purified and used for the following experiments.",

The SDS-PAGE results revealed that the purified IgY was composed of a 70-kDa H chain and a 30-kDa L chain, which is consistent with the literature (52), suggesting that IgY antibody with high purity can be obtained by the water dilution combined with sulfate precipitation. The indirect ELISA for measuring the S-IgY titer and the growth-decline rule indicated that the titer of antibody peaked at week 7 after the initial immunization and was maintained at a higher level for ~ 4 weeks compared with C-IgY, the antibody levels decreased gradually after week 11.

It was also revealed that IgY cross blocked CPE induced by EV71 and CVA16, and that the IgY cross bound to the envelope proteins VP1 and VP3 of EV71 and CVA16, suggesting that the cross protection of IgY against EV71 and CVA16 infection may be mediated through targeting VP1 and VP3 structural proteins of the two viruses. These findings provide a scientific basis for developing IgY as a cross passive immunotherapy for EV71-or CVA16-induced HFMD. Further in vivo studies in preclinical animal models with this cross immunotherapy are warranted.",
