All Western blots showed a major single band at the expected molecular weight indicating that the antibodies were specific and could be used in the dot blot assay. For human PBMC the internal standard, which is a pool of all samples in the analysis (healthy controls and patients), was analyzed. Asterisks indicate fragmented TDP-43.",

Immunoreactivity was normalized to protein loading, as assessed by Ponceau Red staining (Relative immunoreactivity, RI).
