Three ferrets were also treated with systemic steroids that may have caused an altered immune status. In one case, dexamethasone SP was used to manage hind-end paresis. 9 When the ferret was euthanized 5 weeks later, it had systemic cryptococcosis. In a case of chorioretinitis, the ferret was treated with oral prednisone. 13, 14 This ferret was also treated with fluconazole at the same time, but when he was euthanized 7 months after treatment he had signs of systemic cryptococcosis.",

There are 17 known HA subtypes and 10 known NA subtypes. Many different combinations of HA and NA proteins are possible. 25 For the purposes of this article, the focus is on the H1N1 subtype during the influenza season 2009 to 2010. This virus was also called \"novel H1N1\" or \"swine flu,\" which emerged in the spring of 2009 and caused the first global outbreak of disease caused by a novel influenza virus (influenza pandemic) in more than 40 years. 26 H1N1 was first seen in humans in March 2009 and then became a pandemic by June 2009.

In the 1930s the zoonotic spread of influenza from ferrets was first reported. 31 More recently, ferrets have been instrumental in influenza research and as sentinels for this viral infection in humans. Ferrets are used as animal models for influenza infection because they display flulike symptoms and immune responses similar to those of humans. 32 In Pennsylvania in 2009, the diagnosis of influenza in several pet ferrets led to enhanced surveillance for pandemic H1N1 in the region. This vigilance helped to increase the identification of humans infected with this same strain. 28 Experimentally, reassortment of different strains of influenza in ferrets has been proved via coinfection with both a human and avian strain of the virus. Therefore, a ferret exposed to both a pathogenic and seasonal strain of influenza could act as mediator for the formation of a pathogenic form of the seasonal influenza. 33 Anthroponosis was suspected in several cases of influenza in ferrets in 2009. In a group of ferrets with pandemic H1N1, the owners reported flulike symptoms from 6 to 9 days before clinical signs in the ferrets. 29 In a California zoo 3 animals contracted influenza A H1N1, including a black-footed ferret. It was suspected but not confirmed that the virus was contracted from humans interacting with the animals. 28 ",

Influenza viruses that normally circulate in pigs are called variant viruses when they are found in people. In humans, certain influenza strains have been associated with prolonged exposure to pigs at agricultural fairs. 34 Avian influenza occurs naturally among anseriformes and domestic poultry, but can infect other avian and animal species, including sporadic human infections. 35 During an outbreak of influenza in a colony of ferrets living on a farm in Iowa, investigation of their housing revealed that they were 0.25 miles away from a swine operation and were exposed to multiple avian species. There was concern for aerosol transmission from the swine farm or locally housed birds. 30 ",

In ferrets that were experimentally infected with H1N1, antibody responses correlated with the severity of the influenza infections. 24 During the outbreak of natural influenza in a colony of farm ferrets, hemagglutination inhibition antibody was high in infected ferrets. 30 ",

Supportive care includes fluid therapy, either subcutaneously or intravenously, if severely dehydrated or febrile. Weight loss was a common clinical sign noted in ferrets experimentally infected with influenza, so support feeding is also important. 24 Ferrets are strict carnivores with a rapid GI transit time, so a convalescent diet should include a meal that is palatable, and high in fat and protein. Many recovery diets for feline patients are suitable, such as Hill's A/D, Oxbow's Carnivore Care, or Lafeber's Emeraid Carnivore. Coverage with a broad-spectrum antibiotic is warranted if a secondary bacterial infection is suspected. Parenteral antibiotics can be used in ferrets that are too sick or nauseated for oral antibiotics. The use of antiviral drugs in the treatment of influenza is difficult, because this virus mutates and resistance is common. 36 There are variable results in the use of antiviral drugs in experimentally induced influenza in ferrets, which seem to depend on the strain of the virus and the time of administration after infection. 36, 37 In the ferrets with pandemic H1N1 influenza, many were successfully treated with subcutaneous fluids, parenteral antibiotics, and support feeding. 27, 29, 30 It must be noted that influenza is zoonotic and contagious to other ferrets, so appropriate precautions must be taken for all staff and owners involved in treating the ill ferret.",

This condition is believed to be immune mediated, but the exact pathogenesis has not been elucidated. The presence of antithyroglobulin varies between breeds, and whether it occurs before or as a result of follicular damage is unknown. Idiopathic thyroid atrophy is characterized by the loss of the thyroid parenchyma and replacement with adipose connective tissue, with no observable inflammation or fibrosis. Primary and metastatic neoplasia can uncommonly also cause hypothyroidism. 39 In cats, acquired hypothyroidism is almost always the result of treatment for hyperthyroidism.

Measured tri-iodothyronine (T3) values did not change for at least 6 hours, making measurement of circulating T4 an easier and more feasible parameter to measure in clinical practice. 41 Unfortunately, Dermathycin is no longer available for purchase in the United States. More recently, however, T4 levels were measured using human recombinant TSH (Thyrogen) in 11 neutered ferrets, and successful stimulation of the thyroid axis was achieved. Prestimulation values for T4 in neutered male and female ferrets were determined to be 29.9 AE 5.8 ng/mL and 21.8 AE 3.3 ng/mL, respectively. Ferrets were stimulated using 100 mg Thyrogen intramuscularly, and euthyroid ferrets were found to have an increase of 1.4 times basal levels after 4 hours. 38 A concurrent study involving 25 laboratory and pet neutered ferrets using the same protocol was also released in 2012. The investigators noted a median poststimulation T4 level at 34.8% above prestimulatory levels, and found the mean plasma T4 of euthyroid ferrets to be 21.3 nmol/L. 42 Treatment Oral levothyroxine at 50 to 100 mg every 12 hours was able to return serum T4 to normal resting levels in test studies. Treatment also led to increased activity, weight loss, and increased rear-leg function. Ferrets with sick euthyroid syndrome were not responsive to levothyroxine therapy. 38 Prognosis Prognosis with T4 supplementation has thus far been excellent for the 7 animals studied. 38 As the pathogenesis of hypothyroidism in ferrets is unknown, the longterm prognosis has yet to be determined, as has whether adjustments to the dose of levothyroxine will need to be adjusted over time.",

In humans, parvovirus B19 directly infects the erythroid precursors, resulting in premature apoptosis. 44 Aleutian disease is a parvovirus that affects ferrets; however, to date it has not been implicated in the development of PRCA. Formation of antibodies against erythropoietin after treatment with recombinant human erythropoietin is thought to be the cause of some cases of PRCA in dogs. 49, 52 In the published case of an 8-month-old ferret, extensive testing was performed to find an underlying cause of the erythroid hyperplasia, but none was found. 53 Based on the response to immunosuppressive medications, an immune-mediated mechanism was thought to be involved, and the conclusion was made that this was a case of primary PRCA. In the author's (S.C.) practice, 4 additional ferrets have been diagnosed with PRCA based on erythroid hypoplasia of the bone marrow. The previously described 5-month-old ferret (Case A) had been vaccinated for canine distemper just 3 weeks before presentation, and it is unknown whether erythroid hypoplasia in the bone marrow was an idiosyncratic reaction to the vaccine or if this ferret had a primary or congenital form of PRCA. The other 3 ferrets diagnosed with PRCA were mature (older than 4 years) and had other systemic illness preceding or concurrent with their severe anemia, including chronic episodes of diarrhea in one ferret (Case C), insulinoma and hyperadrenocorticism in the second (Case D), and severe leukocytosis and generalized weight loss of unknown cause in the third (Case B) ( Table 4) . Cases A-D are ferrets that presented to the author's (S.C.) clinic. All ferrets had erythroid hypoplasia on cytologic analysis of the bone marrow. Abbreviations: PCV, packed cell volume; PO, by mouth; PRCA, pure red cell aplasia; SC, subcutaneously. a It is unknown whether vaccination was the trigger for this ferret's PRCA. b Initial presentation of anemia believed to be caused by hyperestrogenism secondary to hyperadrenocorticism because the ferret had a concurrent thrombocytopenia and the PCV improved several weeks after adrenalectomy. Recurrence of anemia noted 13 weeks later was believed to be caused by PRCA, because no evidence of hyperestrogenism was noted 2 weeks prior on an adrenal sex hormone panel and normal numbers of megakaryocytes and granulocytes were noted in the bone marrow.",

This disease differs from the typical appearance of IMHA, whereby there are normal to increased numbers of erythroblasts in the bone marrow. The singular loss of only the erythroid cell line and no changes in the myeloid or megakaryocytic cell lines results in a marked increase in the myeloid-to-erythroid ratio. The myeloid-to-erythroid ratio in ferrets has been reported to range from 1:3 to 3:1.5. 58 In the one published case report, the ferret had a myeloid-to-erythroid ratio of 4.6:1. 53 An antinuclear antibody test (ANA) can be performed to assess for autoantibodies as part of the diagnostic workup of certain autoimmune diseases. However, it is uncertain whether this test is effective in ferrets because ANA titers were negative in the one published case study. 53 ",

There are no known blood types in ferrets, so risk from transfusion reaction is lower than for other species. 59 In the published case report, the anemic ferret received multiple transfusions over the course of treatment, including blood from 3 different donors for the third transfusion. 53 Multiple blood transfusions from different individuals have also been administered to anemic ferrets in the author's (S.C.) practice, with no observed adverse effects. However, the recipient is always closely monitored during a transfusion for adverse reactions, such as spikes in temperature, tachycardia, tachypnea, pruritus, and vomiting. If noted, administration of the blood is temporarily stopped or given more slowly. The recipient can also be premedicated with diphenhydramine (2 mg/kg intramuscularly, intravenously, or orally) as a preventative for a transfusion reaction. 60 Large healthy males make the best donors, as they are able to donate a larger volume of blood. Approximately 1% of the donor's body weight can be collected safely. Because a relatively large volume is being collected, the donor should be sedated to minimize risks of venipuncture from the anterior vena cava. Isoflurane is commonly used; however, this can cause a significant drop in PCV because of splenic sequestration of red blood cells. 61 In their practice, the authors have sedated donor ferrets with subcutaneous or intramuscular injections of ketamine (10 mg/kg) and midazolam (1 mg/kg) to minimize the reduction in PCV. The neck of the donor ferret is shaved and sterilely prepped before venipuncture. A 23-gauge butterfly catheter is inserted into the thoracic cavity just cranial to the first rib and directed toward the opposite rear limb. The blood is collected into a syringe prefilled with Acid-Citrate-Dextrose (ACD) anticoagulant (1 part ACD to 9 parts blood). Supplemental subcutaneous fluids and an injection of iron dextran (10 mg/kg intramuscularly) are administered to the donor ferret during recovery.",

In the published case report, no evidence of regeneration (reticulocyte count of 0 cells/mL) was noted after 2 weeks of prednisolone (2 mg/kg orally every 12 hours) therapy alone. 53 Improvement on prednisolone (2 mg/kg orally every 12 hours) was seen in 2 of the 4 cases (Case B and C) seen in the author's practice. Increases in PCV to near normal levels were noted within 4 to 5 weeks. However, relapse of the anemia was seen in 1 of the ferrets (Case B) while the prednisolone was being tapered. A third ferret (Case D) was already on prednisolone (0.75 mg/kg orally every 12 hours) for management of insulinomas when it presented for its anemia, though not at an immunosuppressive dose. In this particular ferret, his initial presentation of anemia was believed to be caused by hyperestrogenism secondary to confirmed hyperadrenocorticism, because the patient had a concurrent thrombocytopenia and its PCV increased from 18% to 51% within 4 weeks after surgery. The ferret's PCV remained in normal ranges until recurrence of the anemia was noted 13 weeks later. This second incidence was believed to be caused by PRCA, because no evidence of hyperestrogenism was noted 2 weeks prior on an adrenal sex hormone panel. Erythroid hypoplasia of the bone marrow was confirmed at necropsy. The PCV of the final ferret (Case A) continued to drop from 18% down to 10% over 2 weeks while receiving prednisolone, but it was most likely receiving a suboptimal dose (1 mg/kg orally every 12 hours) (see Table 4 ).",

Response to cyclosporine A is considered excellent in humans. 51 In the published ferret case, a regenerative response and improvement in the anemia were noted 2 weeks after the administration of cyclosporine (4 mg/kg orally every 12 hours) as a second immunosuppressive medication. 53 A recurrence of the nonregenerative anemia was noted on day 86 of treatment, approximately 2 weeks after the trough plasma concentration of cyclosporine had decreased. The cyclosporine dosage was increased (6 mg/kg orally every 12 hours), and a significant increase in both reticulocyte number and trough plasma concentration of cyclosporine was noted within 5 days. Administration of both prednisolone and cyclosporine were continued for a total of 14 months, at which point the ferret appeared to be in complete remission and remained in remission for up to 21 months after cessation of all medications. 53 In the published report, azathioprine (1 mg/kg orally every 24 hours) was initiated when the ferret came out of remission on day 86. However, because azathioprine has delayed immunosuppressive effects, it most likely did not play a role in the ferret's regenerative response and was discontinued after less than a week. 53 Cyclophosphamide, an alkylating agent used to treat various autoimmune conditions and cancer, has been used in dogs 49 and cats 50 for the treatment of PRCA. Although cyclophosphamide is used in chemotherapeutic protocols for lymphoma in ferrets, 64 its use for treatment of PRCA in ferrets has not been documented. Antithymocyte globulin, alemtuzumab, rituximab, and intravenous immunoglobulin have been used in the treatment of acquired PRCA in humans, but their use in veterinary medicine has not been reported. 51 Erythropoietin has been used in cases of canine and feline anemia associated with end-stage renal failure, but it has questionable benefits in patients with normal renal function. 53, 65 In addition, the use of erythropoietin has been implicated in some cases of acquired PRCA in other species. 49, 52 Although erythropoietin was administered to the ferret in the one published case report, it was not thought to be a factor in that ferret's remission. In other species, erythropoietin is effective only after administration for several weeks, and the ferret had a marked reticulocytosis within 5 days of initiating treatment with erythropoietin. The dosage of the ferret's cyclosporine had been increased at the same time and was thought to be the more likely cause of the regenerative response. 53 ",

            "text": "In other species, prognosis depends on the inciting cause of PRCA. In people, cases of secondary PRCA due to medications are often transient and reversible when the medications are discontinued. 44 Most dogs (10 out of 13) responded well to immunosuppressive medications, although initial response to therapy had a median of 38 days (range 22-87 days) and complete remission had a median time of 118 days (range 58-187 days). 49 A rapid response (1.5-5 weeks) was noted in 6 of 7 cats; however, a relapse and/or refractoriness to treatment was noted if the cats were not treated promptly and aggressively with long-term immunosuppressive medication. 50 In addition, cats that develop PRCA after an infection with FeLV subgroup C do not respond to immunosuppressive therapy, and usually succumb to their anemia. 50 The prognosis in ferrets is unknown because of the paucity of reports, but complete remission has been reported in one ferret treated with multiple blood transfusions and immunosuppressive therapy. 53 In the author's (S.C.) practice, 1 ferret (Case C) Selected Emerging Diseases in Ferrets responded extremely well to prednisolone alone, had complete remission, and has not had a recurrence of its anemia 1 year later. A partial and short-term response was noted in 1 ferret (Case B), but the nonregenerative anemia returned while in the process of weaning off the prednisolone. It is unknown whether the ferret with concurrent insulinoma and hyperadrenocorticism (Case D) had a delay in the appearance of his PRCA because it was on long-term steroids, albeit not at an immunosuppressive dose. The case in the juvenile ferret (Case A) had no response to immunosuppressive therapy and multiple blood transfusions, which may have been due to suboptimal dosing of the prednisolone (see Table 4 ). Based on these cases, ferrets possibly respond in a similar manner to cats, for which prompt and aggressive long-term immunosuppressive therapy is required to prevent recurrence of erythroblast destruction and refractoriness to medication.",

In turn, this can lead to more effective and successful treatment of affected patients in clinical practice. Diagnosis and reporting of cases is also crucial in expanding our understanding of these rarer diseases, and will facilitate elucidation of their incidence, etiology, and pathology.",
