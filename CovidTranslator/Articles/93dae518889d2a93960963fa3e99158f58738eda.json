The breakthrough of the subject is that we can construct the moment vectors from DNA sequences using this new graphical method and prove that the correspondence between moment vectors and DNA sequences is one-to-one. Using these moment vectors, we have constructed a novel genome space as a subspace in R N . It allows us to show that the SARS-CoV is most closely related to a coronavirus from the palm civet not from a bird as initially suspected, and the newly discovered human coronavirus HCoV-HKU1 is more closely related to SARS than to any other known member of group 2 coronavirus. Furthermore, we reconstructed the phylogenetic tree for 34 lentiviruses (including human immunodeficiency virus) based on their whole genome sequences. Our genome space will provide a new powerful tool for analyzing the classification of genomes and their phylogenetic relationships.",

Already there have been many proposals to compare genomes. Boore and Brown 1 used gene order to study the evolutionary relationships of metazoan mitochondrial genomes. Snel et al. 2 later constructed the phylogenetic tree for completely sequenced prokaryotic genomes based on gene content. In Snel et al.'s method, the similarity between two genomes is defined as the number of genes that they have in common divided by their total number of genes. However, such techniques are time-consuming as they must first identify all the genes in one genome. These approaches, together with G \u00fe C content, edit distance, and reversal and rearrangement distances, 3 -5 compare genomes using only partial genomic information. Thus, these results are usually controversial because single-gene sequences generally do not contain enough information to construct an evolutionary history of organisms.",

            "text": "We introduce graphical representation of DNA sequence to construct the genome space. The graphical representation of DNA sequence provides a simple way of viewing, sorting, and comparing various gene structures. Thus, it is an attractive and promising research direction. The first important method in this direction is due to Hamori. 7 He used a three-dimensional curve to represent a DNA sequence. Gates 8 later constructed a two-dimensional graphical representation that is simpler than the Hamori curve. However, Gates' graphical representation has high degeneracy. Recently, we reported a new two-dimensional graphical representation of gene sequences 9 which has no circuit or degeneracy, so that the correspondence between gene sequences and gene graphs is one-to-one. In this way, the original DNA sequence can be recovered from its graph mathematically without loss of biological information. In this paper, we make a minor modification of our previous method and obtain a new graphical representation approach for DNA sequences. The breakthrough of the subject is that we can construct the moment vectors from DNA sequences using this new graphical method, and we can prove that the correspondence between moment vectors and DNA sequences is one-to-one. The novelty and uniqueness of our approach is that by using these moment vectors of DNA sequences, we have constructed a genome space as a subspace in Euclidean space. Each genome sequence can be represented as a point in this space. Therefore, this genome space can be used to make comparative analysis to study the clustering and phylogenetic relationship among genomes. The biological (evolutionary) distance between two genomes can be obtained through the Euclidean distance among the corresponding points in the genome space.",

Most existing methods for phylogenetic inference using biological sequences can be divided into two groups. The algorithms in the first group utilize various distance measures 12 -15 which are based on different models of nucleotide substitution or amino acid replacement, and then transform the distance matrix into a tree. In the second group of approaches, instead of building a tree, the tree that can best explain the observed sequences under the evolutionary assumption is found by evaluating of different topologies. This category includes parsimony 16 -18 and maximum likelihood methods. 19 -21 All these methods require a multiple alignment of the sequences and assume some sort of evolutionary model, which require human intervention. Thus, the results are usually controversial. However, our genome space does not need sequence alignment and any evolutionary model. It is totally automatically generated and avoids computation repetition. First, we consider the phylogeny of mammals. Mitochondrial DNA is not highly conserved and has a rapid mutation rate, thus it is very useful for studying the evolutionary relationships of organisms. 22 We extracted 35 complete mammalian mitochondrial genome sequences from the GenBank, each of which has length of more than 16 000 nucleotides. Moreover, they have double-stranded and circular structures. As mentioned in the previous section, because we have already known the gene content of both strands of these genomes, we just treat them as the single-stranded (by using the heavy strand) circular genomes. For this case, we treat every point as the start point in this circular sequence of length n, and then we get n linear single-strand genomes. For every linear single-strand genome sequence, by using the nucleotide vector system shown in Fig. 1 , we can compute its n-dimensional moment vector. Then, we take average by n for these n n-dimensional moment vectors to get a normalized moment vector (M 1 , M 2 , . . . , M n ). Here, we use the first 60 components of the moment vector (M 1 , M 2 , . . . , M 60 ) to characterize these 35 genome graphical curves and obtained 35 points in 60-dimensional genome space. By computing the Euclidean distances between these points, we got the distance matrix for these 35 organisms. The phylogenetic tree for them shown in Fig. 3 is generated using UPGMA program in the MEGA 4 package. 23 The last 10 mammals are grouped into a cluster because they are primates, and the phylogenetic relationship among them coincides with those found by Raina et al. 24 We also found that Norway rat, vole, and squirrel are grouped into a cluster for the reason that they are rodent species.",

To develop the anti-HIV drugs and vaccines, the research into the origins and evolution of this virus has become very important. Rambaut et al. 25 reconstructed the phylogenetic tree of the primate lentiviruses including HIV-1, HIV-2, and the simian immunodeficiency viruses (SIVs). It was discovered that the two human viruses are related to different SIVs and therefore have different evolutionary origins. However, in Rambaut et al.'s paper, the tree was constructed using the maximum likelihood method on an alignment of the nucleotide sequences of polymerase gene in these lentiviruses.

In agreement with In addition, we apply our genome space to another field of virology: the taxonomy of coronavirus. To study the classification and phylogeny of coronaviruses clearly, we apply our genome space to a large set of 30 complete coronavirus genomes from GenBank, including the two newly sequenced human coronaviruses, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1, along with four genomes from Flaviviridae and Togaviridae which are not coronaviruses (outgroups). The coronavirus genomes are also single-stranded linear RNA. So, similar to the above lentivirus case, we treat these coronavirus genomes as linear DNA sequences.

However, the y-coordinate values of the four nucleotides must be between 21 and 1 to assure that the correspondence between a DNA sequence and its corresponding moment vector is one-to-one. Therefore, in order to obtain a universal genome space for all species, further studies will be needed to determine the universal y-coordinate values.",

            "text": "In the study of mammalian mitochondrion, lentiviruses (including HIV), and coronavirus genomes, we used 60, 12, and 2 moments to construct the genome space, respectively. Here, we should emphasize that we do not need to calculate all the moments to determine the biological information of genomes. Remember that in the central limit theorem in probability and statistics, the limiting process is Gaussian. For Gaussian, the first two moments determine the density function. Thus, we just use the first N moments to get the results, where N is much less than n (the length of genome). Thus, for coronavirus genomes, we only used the first two components of the moment vector (M 1 , M 2 ) because these two moments have allowed us to obtain the stable classified resultwhen higher moments are included the relationship of being close or farther away remains unchanged. To make this point clearer, we also use the first 20 components of the moment vector (M 1 , M 2 , . . . , M 20 ) to construct the 20-dimmensional genome space. By computing the Euclidean distances between these points in this genome space, we reconstructed the phylogenetic tree of these coronaviruses (Fig. 7) . Comparing Figs 6 and 7, we found that the classification relationship of these genomes are the same-group 1, group 2, group 3, group 4, group 5, and outgroups can still be seen in the two trees as six distinct clusters. This means that when using the higher moments, the relationship of being close or farther away remains unchanged. In other word, two moments are already enough to give the right classifying relationship for these genomes. For the same reason, we used the first 60 components of the moment vector (M 1 , M 2 , . . . , M 60 ) and the first 12 components of the moment vector (M 1 , M 2 , . . . , M 12 ) to generate the genome space for mammalian mitochondrion and lentiviruses genomes and obtained the stable phylogenetic analysis result.",

Large-scale genomic rearrangements in closely related organisms make the genome sequences very different from the original genome sequences. Although the moment vectors of the original and rearranged DNA sequences are different, if we treat double DNA genomes as two single-stranded genomes to get two n-dimensional moment vectors for these two single-stranded sequences and take the average to get a general moment vector (M 1 , M 2 , . . . , M n ), the computed distances among related species by gene rearrangements will be small. The genome spaces constructed by the moment vector have advantages over the gene order phylogenetic analysis since the genome spaces do not depend on gene orders and are capable of using all gene families.

A moment vector system to represent a DNA sequence is introduced, and the correspondence between a DNA sequence and its moment vector is mathematically proven to be one-to-one. With this moment vector system, each genome sequence can be represented as a point in a Euclidean space, and the genome space is constructed as a subspace of this Euclidean space. Genomes with close evolutionary relationship and similar properties plot close together in this genome space. Thus, it will provide a new powerful tool for analyzing the classification of genomes and their phylogenetic relationships. Our method is easier and quicker in handling whole or partial genomes than multiple alignment methods. There are two major advantages to our method. (i) Once a genome space has been constructed, it can be stored in a database. There is no need to reconstruct the genome space for any subsequent application, whereas in multiple alignment methods, realignment is needed for add-on new sequences. (ii) One can have global comparison of all genomes simultaneously, which no other existing method can achieve. Furthermore, in our method, the results in twodimensional genome space can be displayed and viewed graphically; this is user-friendly and allows even non-expert to understand the relationship among different genomes via viewing the graph of genome space.",
