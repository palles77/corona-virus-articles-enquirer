Such cultures have a number of One of the first lines of defence against viral infection is the innate immune response and the induction of antiviral type I interferons (IFNs). However some viruses, including the group 2 coronaviruses, have evolved mechanisms to overcome or circumvent the host antiviral response. Canine respiratory coronavirus (CRCoV) has previously been shown to have a widespread international presence and has been implicated in outbreaks of canine infectious respiratory disease (CIRD). This study aimed to quantify pro-inflammatory cytokine mRNAs following infection of canine air-interface tracheal cultures with CRCoV. Within this system, immunohistochemistry identified ciliated epithelial and goblet cells as positive for CRCoV, identical to naturally infected cases, thus the data obtained would be fully transferable to the situation in vivo. An assay of ciliary function was used to assess potential effects of CRCoV on the mucociliary system. CRCoV was shown to reduce the mRNA levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-a and IL-6 and the chemokine IL-8 during the 72 h post-inoculation. The mechanism for this is unknown, however the suppression of a key antiviral strategy during a period of physiologic and immunological stress, such as on entry to a kennel, could potentially predispose a dog to further pathogenic challenge and the development of respiratory disease.",

Respiratory epithelial cells also have the ability to synthesize and release pro-inflammatory cytokines, e.g. IL-1b, IL-6 and TNF-a and chemokines, e.g. IL-8 following viral infection (Adachi et al., 1997; Adler et al., 1994; Becker et al., 1993; Brydon et al., 2005) . Viral infection and pro-inflammatory cytokine production stimulate the infiltration of inflammatory cells to the respiratory epithelium. The induction of epithelial chemokines, e.g. IL-8 may also be a primary event triggering increased airway reactivity in acute viral infection (Kazachkov et al., 2002) . Production of TNF-a or IL-1 during virus infection may occur either directly or indirectly, for example as a result of cellular damage or via induction of other cytokines. TNF-a has been shown to stimulate mucus glycoprotein secretion by airway epithelial cells within 1 h of exposure (Adler et al., 1994) . TNF-a, IL-1b, IL-6 and IL-8 can also affect ciliary beat frequency indirectly through the increased synthesis of endothelin by tracheal epithelial cells (Adler et al., 1994) . Quantitative PCR has previously been used to demonstrate significantly increased transcription of IL-6, TNF-a and a number of other pro-inflammatory and immunomodulatory cytokines/chemokines in epithelium infected with feline herpesvirus type-1 (FHV-1), suggesting a previously unknown role for FHV-1 in feline chronic nasal discharge (Johnson and Maggs, 2005) .",

The mean CRCoV nucleocapsid gene copy number within tracheal cultures from different dogs at 24-96 h post-inoculation was determined (Fig. 4) . In all cases, there was an overall increase in CRCoV nucleocapsid gene RNA copies during the experiment and the peak copy number was attained at 96 h post-inoculation for each dog. However, in some dogs, there was a noticeable fall in copy number at 48 or 72 h, compared to the levels at 24 h, thus the dynamics of the infection appeared to be different for tracheal cultures from different dogs. Due to this finding, cytokine mRNA levels were also analysed relative to CRCoV copy number, to control for individual variation between the tracheas from different dogs. The quantification of canine IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-a mRNA copies in CRCoV-inoculated cultures was presented as the logarithm of the fold change relative to control-inoculated cultures in the same dog at the same time point. These data were plotted against CRCoV nucleocapsid RNA copies in the same cDNA sample. The Pearson correlation coefficient, r was determined for each cytokine using SPSS v. 16.0. There were weak positive correlations between the fold change in IL-6 (r = 0.304) and IL-8 (r = 0.277) mRNA copies and CRCoV copies, however these were not considered significant (p > 0.05). A significant positive correlation (p = 0.05) was demonstrated between TNF-a mRNA and CRCoV RNA copies (r = 0.382). Interestingly at low CRCoV RNA copy number (below 2.0 logs), cytokine mRNA copies appeared to be reduced relative to controls.",

In response to LPS, mRNA levels of TNF-a, IL-6 and IL-8 in cultures, were significantly increased from 24 h post-inoculation, relative to controls, indicating that the assay was sensitive enough to detect changes in cytokine mRNAs within this system. Peak levels for all three cytokine mRNAs were detected at 48 h and had declined by 72 h. Interestingly, CRCoV appeared to suppress the mRNA levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines from 24 to 72 h postinoculation, however at 96 h the levels were raised for each cytokine. When correlated with actual copies of virus, it appeared that at lower copy number (as would be present during the earlier part of the time-course), there was active suppression of cytokine mRNA, relative to controls. How-ever, it seemed that once the virus copies reached a threshold, of 100 copies ng cDNA \u00c01 , cytokine mRNA levels were increased relative to controls, as recorded at 96 h. It is conceivable that early non-structural proteins produced by the replicating virus may act to inhibit the induction of cytokine and chemokine genes.

The assay demonstrated that the growth kinetics of CRCoV within this system were not linear.

However, following inoculation, the ciliary clearance of LPS-inoculated cultures was significantly reduced with respect to both the speed and extent of clearance of latex relative to controls.

On its own, CRCoV may cause a transient potentially clinically silent, respiratory disease similar to the human 'common cold'. However, challenge with CRCoV during entry to a re-homing kennel is often accompanied by the simultaneous exposure to CPIV, CHV, B. bronchiseptica and mycoplasmas, in addition to the environmental stresses that are inevitable during such an event.
