However, to date, there was hardly any study in characterizing the immune responses, especially adaptive immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this study, we collected blood from COVID-19 patients who have recently become virus-free and therefore were discharged, and analyzed their SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody and T cell responses. We observed SARS-CoV-2-specific humoral and cellular immunity in the patients. Both were detected in newly discharged patients, suggesting both participate in immune-mediated protection to viral infection. However, follow-up patients (2 weeks post discharge) exhibited high titers of IgG antibodies, but with low levels of virus-specific T cells, suggesting that they may enter a quiescent state. Our work has thus provided a basis for further analysis of protective immunity to SARS-CoV-2, and understanding the pathogenesis of COVID-19, especially in the severe cases. It has also implications in designing an effective vaccine to protect and treat SARS-CoV-2 infection. : medRxiv preprint",

The WHO then declared this outbreak a public health emergency of international concern 2 . The genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 bears 96% 3 and 79.5% identity to that of a bat coronavirus and SARS-CoV, respectively 4 . Like SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the beta genus Coronavirus in the Corornaviridae family 5 . Clinically, several papers showed that most COVID-19 patients developed lymphopenia as well as pneumonia with higher plasma levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in severe cases [6] [7] [8] , suggesting that the host immune system is involved in the pathogenesis 9, 10 . Patients infected by SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV were previously reported to have antibody responses [11] [12] [13] [14] , but exhibited defective expression of type I and II interferon (IFN), indicative of poor protective immune responses [15] [16] [17] . However, to date, there was hardly any study in characterizing the immune responses, especially adaptive immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Only one COVID-19 patient was shown with nucleocapsid protein (NP)-specific antibody response, in which IgM peaked at day 9 after disease onset and then switched to IgG by week 2 3 , suggesting involvement of humoral immunity. SARS-CoV-2specific T lymphocyte response was unclear. In this study, we collected blood from COVID-19 patients who have recently become virus-free and therefore were discharged, and analyzed their SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody and T cell responses.",

The results were considered positive if there were at least 1-fold increase in the numbers of IFN-g-secreting T cells in the subject than in the healthy donors. As shown in Figure 2B , compared with healthy donors, the numbers of IFN-g-secreting NP-specific T cells in patients #1, 2, 4 and 5 were much higher than other patients, suggesting that they had developed SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell responses. Of note, patients #1, 2, 4 and 5 developed both strong humoral and cellular immune responses. Main protease-specific T cells were detected in patient #1, 2 and 5, while patients # 1, 2, 4, 5 and 6 showed S-RBD-specific T cells. Although the numbers of IFN-gsecreting S-RBD specific T cells were much lower than those of NP-specific T cells, they could be detected in more patients than those for other viral proteins. S-RBD thus not only elicited humoral immunity that may result in blockade of receptor binding during viral entry in host cells, but also induced T cell immune responses, suggesting S-RBD is a promising target for SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. In the follow-up patients, only patient #8 who showed lymphopenia before treatment still had a high number of IFN-g-secreting T cells in response to NP, main protease and S-RBD ( Figure 2B ), which suggests that anti-viral T cells may not be maintained at high numbers in the PBMCs in the recovered patients.
