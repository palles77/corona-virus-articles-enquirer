This literature discussion scrutinizes how disaster and resilience is framed for the tourism sector, and, more specifically, how the concepts can be applied to the hotel sector. A synthesis of the literature points to the importance of prioritizing disaster resilience building for the hotel sector. The body of literature regarding disasters, tourism, and more specifically hotels, has increased over the last 20 years, still improvements in the hotel sector's disaster preparedness and do not appear to be on the same trajectory. Illustrating the predicament of the contemporary hotel industry serves to open a discussion about the value of building resiliency to disaster for hotels.

The most prevalent definitions adopted by authors of tourism sector research has been Faulkner's [24] concept that crises often have a component that could have been controlled by the group being affected (e.g. management failing to react to events in a way that minimizes effects), while disasters occur suddenly and the actual trigger event is out of the control of those affected (e.g. an earthquake hitting a populated area). Ritchie [80] recognises that an overlap can occur, when leadership actions during a disaster then develop into a related crisis, thus confusing the concepts. Some authors chose not to tackle the distinction of disaster and crisis but instead use the terms alternately or simultaneously [80] .",

In this spectrum one reduces (or eliminates) possible risks, readies for risk that cannot be reduced or eliminated, responds to events with the readied preparation, and works toward recovery after the event, including reducing or eliminating possible threats. Faulkner [24] provides six phases of disaster in a tourism disaster management framework. These phases include: 1) pre-event, where action is taken to reduce effects of, or eliminate, potential events; 2) prodromal, the time immediate prior to an imminent disaster where warnings and plans are initiated; 3) emergency, the actual disaster response activities; 4) intermediate, where short term issues are resolved and return to normal is being planned; 5) long-term recovery, a continuation of previous phase; and 6) resolution, the final phase where normal activities resume and review of events takes place. In both of these disaster management cycles the concept remains that the management process begins prior to the onset of an event with planning and risk reduction, continuing through to learning lessons and applying those lessons to future planning.",

When organisations are too rigid and systematic, with too many layers of bureaucracy, they are less able to create adaptation strategies during dynamic events [12, 8] . Sawalha [88] studied resilience of insurance companies in Jordan. Findings included that the Jordanian business model characterised by centralized power and hierarchy, with low levels of autonomy and delegation worked at cross-purpose with resiliency.

Ritchie [81] outlines the need of all tourism organisations to assess their vulnerabilities and risks, placing increasing emphasis on planning and prevention, as opposed to the more common focus on response and recovery strategies. There is a need for businesses to consider how they are creating and/or enhancing risks and act to minimize these effects (United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific ESCAP [95] S.awalha et al. [89] studied five star Jordanian hotels and found that disaster management was considered a response and recovery activity, as opposed to a proactive management of variables to decrease the possibilities and severities of risks. Faulkner [24] brings to light that few tourism organisations recognize the importance of risk reduction, planning and preparedness.",

For example, in 2006, Hystad and Keller [31] did a follow-up study, three years after a major forest fire affected tourism businesses near Kelowna, British Columbia, Canada. In the original study, 104 tourism businesses were surveyed regarding their preparedness for disaster. The original 2003 study concluded the businesses were not prepared for a forest fire, although an occurrence of an event like this fire was highly probable [30] . The 2006 follow-up study identified 38% (up from the previous study showing 26%) of those businesses in their study had a disaster management plan. Further analysis of the data revealed that the majority of those businesses had only informal planning. The study's conclusion was that tourism businesses lack the will to improve and develop their own contingency planning ( [31] , p. 157).",

Lack of staff to run the operation was found to be the primary cause. Lamanna et al. [39] examined New Orleans hotels' response to Hurricane Gustav in 2008. The study showed that while 80% indicated they had a written plan for hurricane evacuation, only 54% involved their staff in the process and 58% had procedures for training staff. 46% provided an annual exercise for the staff to participate. New Orleans hotels have capitalized on lessons learned from previous hurricanes, yet they still have much room for growth and improved resilience.

Business continuity planning is focused on establishing a strategic plan to reestablish key business operations to ensure business survival [57] . Business continuity planning may include such things as audits of facilities, identifying key persons, developing prevention strategies, and acquiring insurance to cover potential losses [57] .
