All strains hemagglutinated both mouse and chicken erythrocytes at 4 \u00b0C, but the ratios of hemagglutination titers with mouse erythrocytes compared to chicken erythrocytes showed diversity for both CD and WD strains. Some CD and WD strains did not hemagglutinate chicken erythrocytes at 37 \u00b0C and showed receptordestroying enzyme activity against chicken erythrocytes. Hyperimmune antisera were produced in guinea pigs against 3 and 7 strains of BCV from CD and WD, respectively. No significant differences in antibody titers against these strains were observed by indirect immunofluorescence tests. However, in virus neutralization tests, antisera to 1 CD and 2 WD strains had 16-fold or lower antibody titers against 3 WD and 1 CD strains than against the homologous strains, and this variation reflected low antigenic relatedness values (R= 13-25%), suggesting the presence of different subtypes among BCV. In hemagglutination inhibition tests, some one-way antigenic variations among strains were also observed. These results suggest that some antigenic and biological diversity exists among BCV strains, but these variations were unrelated to the clinical source of the strains; i.e. CD or WD.",

Specifically, whether antigenic or biological differences exist between strains derived from CD and WD remains obscure [2] . The purpose of this study was to isolate BCV strains from feces derived from CD and WD in human rectal tumor (HRT-18) cells and to compare the antigenic and biological properties of these strains. and was propagated 8 times in HRT-18 cells. Six WD isolates of BCV designated as the TS, CN, BE, BM, AW and BW strains, were isolated from fecal samples of gnotobiotic calves which had been inoculated with fecal filtrates from affected adult dairy cows from 6 herds in the U.S.A. including Ohio (3 herds) and Wisconsin (3 herds), which were experiencing typical outbreaks of WD during the winters of 1987 to 1993. Three CD isolates of BCV designated as the DB2, OHC and SDC strains, were isolated from fecal samples of neonatal calves with acute diarrhea from 3 herds in the U.S.A. including Ohio (2 herds) and South Dakota (1 herd). A fourth CD isolate (JAZ) was isolated from a neonatal calf with acute diarrhea in Hokkaido, Japan. Virus isolation on HRT-18 cells was done as previously described [2, 25] except that 10 gg/ml of pancreatin (Gibco Laboratories, Grand Island, N.Y.) was added to the maintenance medium. Confirmation of the isolates as BCV was done by using immune electron microscopy [ 16] and immunofluorescence (IF) [2] with hyperimmune antiserum prepared against the Mebus strain ofCD BCV. The isolated viruses, which were passaged a total of 5 to 10 times in HRT-18 cells were plaque-purified at least once before use.",

However there was no relation between M/C HA titer ratio and the clinical source (CD or WD) of the strains.

Specially, each antiserum showed no significant difference between the homologous and heterologous strains in indirect IF antibody titers. However, some antigenic diversity among BCV strains was observed by VN and HI tests. In our previous report [2] , hyperimmune antiserum prepared in a gnotobiotic calf to the Mebus strain of CD BCV had an 8-to 32-fold lower VN antibody titer against the DBA strain ofWD BCV than against the homologous strain. In this study, guinea pig hyperimmune antiserum to the Mebus strain showed similar VN antibody titer differences between homologous and the DBA strains. In addition, this serum also distinguished three other strains ofWD BCV and four strains ofCD BCV from the homologous virus by 16-to 64-fold differences. Moreover, hyperimmune antisera to the SD and BM strains ofWD BCV also distinguished the same strains which were distinguished by the anti-Mebus serum, form homologous strains by 16-to 64-fold differences in antibody titers in VN tests. Although these variations were recognized only in one-way reactions and all strains examined could be classified into a single serotype, the strains showing these variations might be further divided into 2 subtypes. The Mebus, SD and BM strains which belong to the same potential subtype could be distinguished from the DBA, TS, BE and 216XF strains, which constitute another possible subtype (R% values of 13 to 25). The BW, JAZ, OHC and SDC strains also appeared to belong to the latter subtype. The DB2, CN and AW strains comprised an intermediate group that cross-reacted with both subtypes. Interestingly, antiserum to the Mebus strain of BCV which had been prepared in guinea pig in Japan showed only a 2-fold lower VN antibody titer against the 216XF strain than against the homologous strain [25] . In the present study, antiserum to the Mebus strain prepared in the U.S.A. had 16-fold VN antibody titer differences against the homologous and 216XF strains. The reason for this discrepancy is unknown, but differences in the passage level of the Mebus strain at the preparation of antiserum might affect the virus antigenicity [10] . Alternatively, contamination of cultures with other BCV might occur after import and propagation in Japan.",

Also, a cow inoculated via a duodenal cannula with CD BCV developed diarrhea and shed BCV (H. Tsunemitsu et at. 1994' unpublished data).
