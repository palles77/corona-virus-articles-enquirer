            "text": "The present work was conducted to investigate the antioxidant activity and neuroprotective effects of Tripterygium regelii extract (TRE) on H 2 O 2 -induced apoptosis in human dopaminergic cells, SH-SY5Y. TRE possessed considerable amounts of phenolics (282.73 mg tannic acid equivalents/g of extract) and flavonoids (101.43 mg naringin equivalents/g of extract). IC 50 values for reducing power and DPPH radical scavenging activity were 52.51 and 47.83 lg, respectively. The H 2 O 2 scavenging capacity of TRE was found to be 57.68 lM 9 lg -1 min -1 . By examining the effects of TRE on SH-SY5Y cells injured by H 2 O 2 , we found that after incubation of cells with TRE prior to H 2 O 2 exposure, the H 2 O 2 induced cytotoxicity was significantly reversed and the apoptotic features such as change in cellular morphology, nuclear condensation and DNA fragmentation was inhibited. Moreover, TRE was very effective attenuating the disruption of mitochondrial membrane potential and apoptotic cell death induced by H 2 O 2 . TRE extract effectively suppressed the up-regulation of Bax, Caspase-3 and -9, and down-regulation of Bcl-2. Moreover, TRE pretreatment evidently increased the tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in SH-SY5Y cells. These findings demonstrate that TRE protects SH-SY5Y cells against H 2 O 2 -induced injury and antioxidant properties may account for its neuroprotective actions and suggest that TRE might potentially serve as an agent for prevention of neurodegenerative disease associated with oxidative stress.",

            "text": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder, affecting over six million people worldwide [1] . Pathologically, PD is characterized by the marked degeneration of dopaminergic (DArgic) neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta. Although the mechanism underlying selective degeneration of DArgic neurons is not known completely, the data indicate that oxidative stress has been reported to play important roles [2, 3] . Accumulating evidences show that oxidative stress is one of the important pathways leading to neuronal cell death in PD. Although the source of increased oxidative stress is not completely known, environmental factor, excitotoxin, dopamine homeostasis and others have gained more attention [4] . Oxidative stress may induce mitochondrial dysfunction, genetic mutation and protein aggregation, and ultimately cause cell death [5] . Oxidative damage mediated by reactive oxygen species (ROS) which can be generated following cell lysis, oxidative burst, or the presence of an excess of free transition metals, can attack protein, deoxyneuclic acid, and lipid membranes, thereby disrupting cellular function and integrity [6, 7] . Among a great variety of ROS, hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) is known to play a pivotal role because it is generated from all sources of oxidative stress and can diffuse freely in and out of cells and tissues [8] . In the brain several antioxidant molecules such as ascorbate, superoxide dismutase, and glutathione peroxidase can remove ROS and protect against oxidative stress. Therefore, therapeutic strategies aimed at preventing or delaying ROS induced apoptosis might be reasonable choice for treatment of neurological diseases.",

The herb T. regelii has been used in traditional Korean medicine for centuries [9] and has been reported to have various pharmacological properties including anti-cancer and anti-inflammatory effects [10] [11] [12] . Diterpene-quinonones and triterpenoids were reported from T. regelii and have been shown that triptoquinone A and B inhibited growth of P-3888 leukemia cells in vitro [13, 14] . Over 300 compounds have been identified in the genus Tripterygium and many of them have been evaluated for biological activity [15] . Tripterygium willfordii Hook.F. is among the most studied plant of the genus Tripterygium. Nevertheless, no information is available regarding the effect of T. regelii extract against the pathogenesis of PD. Therefore, this study was designed to explore the antioxidant activity of T. regelii extract and evaluate its neuroprotective effects against H 2 O 2 -induced DArgic neuronal damage.",

We investigated whether TRE extract prevents apoptosis induced by H 2 O 2 in SH-SY5Y cells. DAPI staining revealed that the control SH-SY5Y cells exhibited normal regular and oval shaped nuclei (Fig. 3a) . The nuclear morphology of cells exposed to TRE alone was intact and similar to that of untreated control cells (Fig. 3c) . However, H 2 O 2 -treated cells (Fig. 3b) exhibited highly condensed and fragmented nuclei morphologies, characteristics of apoptosis. In contrast, TRE pre-treatment inhibited these apoptotic features (Fig. 3d) . Further, H 2 O 2 was shown to induce apoptosis by Fig. 1 a Scavenging effects of TRE, BHT, ascorbic acid (Vit C) and quercetin on DPPH radical, and b reducing power of TRE, Vit C, and quercetin. Each value represents the mean \u00b1 SD of three determinations causing DNA strand breaks, as determined by TUNEL assay and PI staining (Fig. 3f, J) . Pretreatment of TRE significantly inhibited the H 2 O 2 -induced apoptosis (Fig. 3h, L) . These results demonstrate that TRE decreased level of cell death, nuclear condensation and DNA fragmentation and indicates that TRE has an anti-apoptotic effect in SH-SY5Y cells.",

A collapse of the mitochondrial trans-membrane potential has been linked to several models for apoptosis [30] . To examine if H 2 O 2 induced apoptosis and its rescue by TRE involve on MMP pathway in SH-SY5Y cells, measurement of MMP was carried out using Rodamine 123. The corresponding changes of fluorescence intensity of Rodamine-123 were measured and presented in Fig. 4b . As shown in Fig. 4 , when SH-SY5Y cells were exposed to 100 lM H 2 O 2 for 24 h, the mitochondrial membrane potential was significantly decreased, indicating the release of Rodamine-123 from mitochondria into the cytosol. However, the cells preincubated with TRE prior to the addition of H 2 O 2 , showed a markedly increased in the mitochondrial membrane potential as compared with H 2 O 2 -treated cells. These results showed that TRE extract suppressed the H 2 O 2induced decrease of mitochondrial membrane potential. The Bax to Bcl-2 expression ratio can be used to determine whether a cell has undergone apoptosis. In H 2 O 2 -treated cells, the expression of Bcl-2 protein was downregulated whereas the expression of Bax protein was up-regulated (Fig. 5a, c) , which resulted in a high Bax to Bcl-2 ratio, indicating that the H 2 O 2 -induced apoptosis in SH-SY5Y cells is probably mediated by the mitochondrial pathway. However, pretreatment with TRE attenuated the change in Bax and Bcl-2 that was induced by H 2 O 2 , resulting in a ",

As illustrated in Fig. 6a [31] . Suppression of ROS by antioxidants might be an effective strategy in inhibiting oxidative stress-induced cell death. Therefore, the use of anti-oxidant agents as a way of neuroprotection could be a potential therapy to slow or ameliorate the progression of neurodegenerative diseases [32] . In this study, we found that TRE exhibited potent DPPH radical scavenging activity, H 2 O 2 scavenging activity and strong reducing power. These results suggest that TRE could be a prominent natural source of strong antioxidant compounds. Although the composition of TRE extract remains to be elucidated, previously a number of triterpenes, diterpenes, sesquiterpenes and alkaloids as a major compound have been isolated from this plant and their biological activities have been documented [15, [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] . Several studies have shown that celastrol, a quinone methide triterpenoid isolated from T. regelii, possesses various biological properties including chemopreventive, antioxidant, neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory actions [33, 37, 38] . Recently, Kim et al. [38] showed that celastrol effectively suppresses the inflammatory responses accompanying the direct inhibition of nitric oxide, prostaglandin E 2 , cyclooxygenase-2 and inflammatory cytokines in murine macrophages. Moreover, it has been reported that some quinone-methide triterpenes such as celastrol, pristimerin, tingenone, and iguesterin including celastrol isolated from T. regelii exhibited inhibitory effects for SARS-CoV 3CL pro (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [39] . Natural triterpenoid pristimerin was found to induce mitochondrial cell death through ROS-dependent activation of both Bax and PARP-1 in human cervical cancer cells [40] . In addition, regelin and regelinol, new antitumour ursine type triterpenoids have been reported from this plant [10] . Previous studies have shown the anticancer activities of some sesquiterpenes such as triptofordin F-2, triptogelin A-1, and triptogelin C-1 from T. regelii [41] . Furthermore, diterpene quinoids, triptoquinones A-F isolated from T. regelii have been reported to have anti-inflammatory activities [34, 42] . These studies have demonstrated the potential of TRE to reduce inflammation and autoimmune responses. However, its relationship with neurodegenerative disease is unexplored. In this study we found that TRE could modulate PD-related neurotoxins-induced cell death in human DArgic neurons.",

High concentration of H 2 O 2 -induces necrotic forms of cell death [46] . However, moderate concentrations of H 2 O 2 induce DNA cleavage and are associated with morphological evidence of apoptosis [6] . Our results confirmed that treatment of SH-SY5Y cells with H 2 O 2 resulted in a dose dependent viability loss (Fig. 2a) . However, pre-treatment with TRE (10 lg/ml) efficiently prevented the loss of cell viability (Fig. 2b, d) , which is further confirmed by morphological observations (Fig. 2c) . These results indicated that TRE significantly protected SH-SY5Y cells from H 2 O 2 -induced cytotoxicity through the inhibition of both apoptotic and necrotic process. Further, in the present study, we showed a protective effect of TRE against H 2 O 2 -induced cell death in human DArgic cells, SH-SY5Y. Apoptosis is the process of cell death characterized by cell shrinkage, nuclear condensation, DNA fragmentation and membrane blabbing. These apoptotic features in situ were detected by DAPI, TUNEL and PI staining (Fig. 3) . Interestingly, TRE significantly attenuated these features, indicating that TRE may possess an inhibitory effect on H 2 O 2 induced apoptosis.",

            "text": "Apoptosis is mediated through extrinsic pathway by death receptor and intrinsic pathway by mitochondria. Ultimately, these pathways activate caspases, and activated caspases induce cell death. Bcl-2 family consists of two groups; anti-apoptotic group (Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL) and proapoptotic group (Bak, Bax, Bid), and they play an important role in mitochondrial related apoptosis pathway. Bcl-2, one of anti-apoptotic factor, residing in the outer mitochondrial membrane inhibits Cytochrome c release [47] . The pro-apoptotic factor Bax, resides in the cytosol. Translocation of Bax to the mitochondrial membrane might lead to loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and an increase in mitochondrial permeability. Increased mitochondrial permeability results in the release of Cytochrome c from the mitochondria [48] . Released Cytochrome c triggers activation of caspase-9 which in turn activates caspase-3, and activated Caspase-3 induces cell death. In this study we examined the modulation of the gene expression of Bcl-2 and Bax after treatments with H 2 O 2 . Our data reveal that Bax/Bcl-2 protein ratio is increased following a treatment with H 2 O 2 , but it decreases with the administration of TRE prior to H 2 O 2 . These results suggest Fig. 6 Effects of TRE on TH and BDNF expression. SH-SY5Y cells were pretreated with TRE (10 lg/ml) for 30 min followed by 100 lM H 2 O 2 for 24 h. Expression of the TH and BDNF were detected by PCR (a), and by immunoblot assay (b). Actin was used as an internal loading control. Results are expressed as mean \u00b1 SD of three independent experiments. * P \\ 0.05, compared with untreated control; # P \\ 0.05, versus H 2 O 2 treated group that TRE can indeed diminish H 2 O 2 -induced apoptotic cell death. Moreover, we demonstrated that TRE prevented depolarization of mitochondrial membrane potential induced by H 2 O 2 as detected by Rodamine 123 (Fig. 4) . In addition, our present findings show that H 2 O 2 induces an activation of caspase-3 and caspase-9, while TRE can prevent these events, supporting a strong anti-apoptotic potential for TRE.",

It has been reported previously that BDNF is the most important neurotrophic factor for the differentiation and survival of midbrain DA neurons [51, 52] .

The mechanism underlying the protective effects of TRE in H 2 O 2 -injured SH-SY5Y cells might be related to the inhibition of apoptotic features such as change in cellular morphology, nuclear condensation and DNA fragmentation, maintenance of MMP stability, increased Bcl-2 activity and decrease of Caspase-3, caspase-9, and Bax activation through mitochondrial-dependent pathway. Moreover, TRE increased the TH and BDNF in SH-SY5Y cells. A probable underlying mechanism of this novel action of TRE may be associated with the presence of flavonoids in the extract, which are a source of antioxidants, since oxidative process are important in the pathogenesis of several disorders including PD. The components with potential antioxidant activity are promising candidates for use as new therapeutic agents against PD. Therefore, TRE may be a highly valuable candidate for the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders associated with oxidative stress.",
