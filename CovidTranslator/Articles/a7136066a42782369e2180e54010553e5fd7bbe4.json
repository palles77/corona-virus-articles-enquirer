            "text": "The history of veterinary vaccine development starts with the well-known story of Louis Pasteur and his rabbit spinal cord vaccine and continues to this day with the demonstration of protection in animals by rabies virus reverse transcriptase DNA plasmid vaccination. 1 In between, in 1947, Frenkel used suspensions of the epithelium obtained from the tongues of recently slaughtered healthy cattle that were maintained in vitro and subsequently infected in a manner similar to that used today with baby hamster kidney cells to produce foot and mouth disease virus (FMDV). The Frenkel procedure became the corner stone of vaccine production for many years and paved the way for modern biotechnology as we know it. 2 More recently, recombinant pox viruses have been generated for vaccination against heterologous pathogens, using vaccinia-vectors, expressing the rabies virus glycoprotein and Newcastle disease virus fusion and hemagglutinin (HA) glycoproteins, the first applications of genetically engineered vaccines. 3 Traditional vaccination involves the use of inactivated, live-attenuated or subunit vaccines. Inactivated, or 'killed', vaccines consist of treated microorganisms that are unable to replicate; however, they do not elicit protein production in the cytosol and hence viral antigens cannot be presented by MHC class I molecules, thus cytotoxic CD8 T cells are not generated. Liveattenuated vaccines are generally far more potent educing a greater number of relevant effector mechanisms, including cytotoxic CD8 T cells. Nevertheless, these vaccines sometimes have residual pathogenicity, 4 or a pathogenic virus strain may re-emerge by a further series of mutations. 5 Subunit vaccines would be as effective as live whole organisms, inherently safer than vaccines based on whole organisms, but they are not strongly immunogenic, being particularly difficult to obtain MHC class I specific responses. [6] [7] [8] The development of vaccines therefore remains an important goal of immunology. Moreover, there remains a need for further vaccines that can reduce the economic impact of disease in production animals.",

            "text": "The ideal vaccine should be 100% efficacious in preventing infection, although this is totally unrealistic. Therefore, the 'realistic' vaccine should provide greater than 90% efficacy in disease prevention within a few days up to a couple of weeks of a single administration. Furthermore, in order to reduce the cost of regular reimmunizations and ensure receipt of a complete vaccination schedule, this protection should be of long duration, and should use a minimal number of doses. Additionally, an 'ideal' vaccine would also stimulate mucosal immunity, since the majority of viruses enter via mucosal surfaces; thus, the 'perfect' vaccine should be designed to be delivered by mucosal routes, that is, intranasal or oral delivery is preferable. Vaccines also need to be safe and not cause any adverse side reaction, such as immunosuppression or interference with immunity to other vaccines given simultaneously. Finally, the vaccines need to be both genetically and thermally stable. Genetic stability must be present to ensure the absence of reversion of the live vaccine to the virulent organism which might cause disease; and thermal stability is critical since the maintenance of the cold chain is not always guaranteed from manufacturing to delivery. A very important desired characteristic is to have vaccines that can be delivered to animals at a very young age and stimulate immunity in the presence of innate, passive immunity. 9, 10 Another very important criterion for an ideal vaccine in veterinary medicine is low cost; this is especially important in developing countries and for poultry vaccines, in which the vaccines must sell for a few cents a dose. Unfortunately, such ideal vaccines are rare in the veterinary field; additionally, there are still severe diseases with no effective vaccines.",

Although the ability of Ad vectors to elicit antigen-specific CD8 and CD4 T cells is well described, little is known about the kinetics or nature of the immune response following Ad immunization. 15, 16 However, Yang et al 17 observed that Ad vectors have (i) the ability to deliver large amounts of antigen into the lymphoid tissues, (ii) the ability to induce rapid expansion and migration of CD8 T cells throughout the lymphatic system, and (iii) the ability to produce a sustained, high-level CD8 T-cell response, that may explain the strong immunogenicity of these vectors.",

The genome is divided into early (E) and late (L) genes, expressed, respectively, before and after replication of the viral chromosome ( Figure 1 ). E1 gene products are involved in the control of viral gene transcription, shutoff of cellular proteins and cellular transformation. The E2 gene codes for proteins involved in viral replication, including a DNA-binding protein involved in DNA elongation (E2A) and a DNA polymerase (E2B); E3 gene, dispensable for Ad replication, codes for proteins that interfere with the host immune response against virus infection; finally, the E4 genes are involved in the transition from early to late gene expression, the shutoff of host-cell gene expression, the viral replication and the assembly of the virion (see Russell 18 and Imler 20 reviews). First-generation vectors are usually deleted in their E1 and E3 regions; however, when production is performed on 293 cells, recombination between the left terminus of first-generation Ad vector and partially overlapping E1 sequences in the cellular genome may result in the generation of E1-positive, replicationcompetent Ad (RCA), 25 a serious safety concern if nonreplicating vectors are desired. Second-generation vectors are replicative-defective Ad, which are further deleted in E2A, E2B or E4, showing reduced immunogenicity and RCA generation, but engineering of stable cell lines that complement these vectors can be cumbersome and lead to poor cell growth and viral titers. 26 rAd vectors have been developed either as replicationcompetent, with the expression cassette for the foreign antigen in place of the E3 genes, or as replication-defective viruses, when the antigen expression cassette replaces the E1 genes. 20 Despite the fact that it would be preferable to work with replication-defective virus, different studies have supported the use of RCAs in veterinary vaccination, since the ability of the replication-defective form to induce mucosal immunity and to protect against a respiratory challenge, following immunization, was reported to be limited. 27, 28 Moreover, RCA-based vaccines were known to have the potentiality to override maternal-derived immunity. 28, 29 Additionally, cattle vaccination with both rAds against herpesvirus-1 showed that the use of the replication-defective form induced lower titers of antibody than the replication-competent form in intratracheal/subcutaneous immunization. 30 ",

Chicken embryo lethal orphan (CELO), classified as the type 1 fowl Ad (FAd), is the most studied vector. This virus, like other typical avian Ad, has a much larger genome than mammalian Ad. Despite its large scatter, it has never been associated with serious disease or economical losses in the poultry industry. It can be isolated from healthy chickens and does not induce clinical signs when experimentally inoculated in chickens. Also this virus use both dependent and independent CAR pathways to enter the cells; 31,32 (iii) porcine Ad (PAd), which, depending upon serotype, can be grown in the pig kidney, testis, retina, thyroid cells, human kidney, canine melanoma and calf kidney cells, do not require adjuvants for the induction of proper immune responses. Infection is generally sub clinical causing no adverse effects in producing pigs, with PAd also isolated from apparently healthy pigs. PAd is species specific having only been isolated from swine, reducing the possibility of its spread to other animal or man following administration. PAd could induce both systemic and mucosal antibody responses; 33,34 and (iv) bovine Ad serotype 3 (BAd3), which, like PAd, do not require adjuvants for the induction of proper immune response, and has been used due to its lack of virulence. Moreover, experimental infections of calves with BAd3 failed to produce either clinical signs or gross lesions, but all animals seroconverted. The cell entry pathway of BAd3 is not well understood. 30, 35 Applications Adenovirus vaccination in companion animals Feline immunodeficiency virus. The infection of cats with feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) results in an immunosuppressive disease that is transmitted by blood and saliva. FIV invades and destroys the monocyte/ macrophage system and infects B cells. 36 Different approaches have been made trying to immunize cats against FIV; so far, no effective vaccine has been made. Gonin et al, 37 10 years ago, constructed a replicationdefective HAd5, containing the envelope protein ENV gene of FIV; however, despite the fact that an antibody response to pseudorabies virus in cats showed the potential of rHAd5 vectors to be used in this species, cats injected with 10 10.8 -10 11.8 of 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID 50 ) adjuvanted with montanide ISA 708 (water in nonmineral oil) or with montanide ISA 206 (double water/mineral oil/water) of this rAd did not develop detectable antibody response against ENV. Moreover, it was observed that even if high titers of antibodies against ENV products are induced, they could still be insufficient for protection. 37 Since then, no further work has apparently been performed concerning the use of Ad vectors as a potential vaccine against FIV.",

In contrast, intranasal immunization of puppies born to CDV and CAd2 immune dams failed to activate specific and protective immune responses. However, when the same puppies were vaccinated subcutaneously, significant seroconversion and solid protective immunity were triggered. Furthermore, a significant priming of memory responses was evidenced immediately after challenge, this constituting an efficient strategy to overcome both passive and active Ad-specific immunity in the dog.",

            "text": "Use of adenoviral vectors as veterinary vaccines TB Ferreira et al important advantage of this recombinant vaccine is the fact that the immune response to the RG was shown not to be impaired by maternal immunity; thus, this Ad vaccine is highly suitable for neonatal immunization. 43 Adenovirus vaccination in poultry Avian infectious bronchitis virus. Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is an highly contagious pathogen of poultry causing significant morbidity and mortality. Depending on the strain, IBV can target the respiratory tract, kidney and oviducts, and result in nephritis and reduced egg production. In addition, more than 20 IBV serotypes have been identified worldwide and new serotypic variants have been identified as a result of the widespread use of live attenuated vaccines. Different approaches have been developed in order to generate a more efficacious vaccine against IBV. The expression of S1, a glycoprotein involved in the attachment of cellular receptors, by a vaccinia virus was able to induce virus-neutralizing antibodies to IBV when delivered to mice; however, multiple injections are required to achieve a reasonable degree of protection. Recently, a FAd expressing the S1 of IBV has been developed. 44 A single dose of 10 6 TCID 50 / animal was shown to be sufficient to obtain complete protection of chickens at the trachea, the primary site of infection by IBV. Moreover, even in the face of FAV maternal antibodies, a high level of protection was achieved. 44 Infectious bursal disease virus. Infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) induces an immunosuppressive disease of chickens by destruction of the B lymphocytes. Current vaccination alternatives consist of either live virus or inactivated oil-emulsion vaccines, which induce serum antibody production in breeding hens after natural exposure; they are transferred to the progeny chicks via the yolk sac providing protection for the first critical weeks after hatching. 45 The construction of an rFAd10 containing the VP2 gene from IBDV has been described. 32 This recombinant vaccine was shown to induce an immune response in chickens to VP2 after vaccination with 10 7 PFU/animal. Moreover, after challenge with IBDV, intravenously, intraperitoneally, subcutaneously or intramuscularly, vaccinated chickens were protected, although no protection was observed in conjunctival sac vaccinated chickens. 32 Adenovirus vaccination in swine Classical swine fever virus. Classical swine fever (CSF), also known as hog cholera, is a serious and contagious viral disease of pigs with a high mortality rate, difficult to control in areas of high pig or wild boar densities, being the most economically important disease of swine in areas of intensive pig farming. For this reason, CSF is included in the A list of infectious diseases of the highest importance for international trade. Thus, it is highly relevant to develop efficacious vaccines for the control of CSF virus (CSFV) in domestic pigs and in wild boar. Prophylactic vaccination is still carried out in many parts of the world. 46 New vaccine developments have included a number of different strategies for delivering the major envelope glycoprotein, E2, against which most neutralizing antibodies are directed. 47 Hammond et al, 48 constructed the first rPAd expressing the E2 protein and showed that a single dose of 10 7 TCID 50 /animal in tissue culture supernatant, when administered subcutaneously, is sufficient to completely protect pigs against subcutaneous challenge. Later, the same authors showed that when the challenge is administered orally, only 60% of the animals were protected; 49 more, recently, it was shown that pigs given two oral doses of 10 6 TCID 50 / animal of rPAd were completely protected from the disease. 50 Pseudorabies virus. Pseudorabies virus (PrV) is an alpha herpesvirus, which causes the economically important and widespread Aujeszky's disease (AJD) in pigs. PrV is a highly neurotropic virus causing nervous and respiratory complications in pigs, the natural host, and in a variety of other animal species. Vaccination against AJD is widely practised with live attenuated or killed whole virus vaccines. However, neonatal immunization is often limited in the presence of maternally derived antibody, which inhibits the immune response against both vaccines. 51 Recently, the use of rAd vaccines carrying individual PrV genes were constructed as a safe alternative. Glycoproteins gD, gB and gC of PrV were chosen on the basis of their role in eliciting a protective immune response against virus infection. It was shown that piglets vaccinated intramuscularly with 10 8.6 -10 9.6 TCID 50 /animal 1 day after birth, with replicationcompetent HAd5 harbouring these three genes, developed similar neutralizing antibody responses independently of the presence or absence of maternal antibodies and were partially protected against challenge 16 weeks later. 52 For pigs that are slaughtered a few months after birth, one-shot vaccination at birth could provide protection of sufficient duration. Finally, two doses of 2 ml of clarified tissue culture supernatant containing 10 5.4 TCID 50 of rPAd expressing the PrV gD gene were administered subcutaneously and showed to protect pigs after challenge. Postmorten, gross lesions of pneumonia were found in the lungs of pigs given a single dose of vaccine; the lungs of pigs given two doses were free from disease. 33 Foot and mouth disease virus. Foot and mouth disease (FMD) is a severe, clinically acute, vesicular disease of cloven-hoofed animals including domesticated ruminants, pigs and more than 70 wildlife species. Pigs are recognized as a significant factor in the spread of the disease since a single pig releases as much aerosol virus as 3000 cattle in a short period of time. 53 They observed that vaccinated swine with 1 \u00c2 10 8 PFU/ animal in PBS developed antibodies against FMDV structural proteins and an FMDV-specific neutralizing antibody response, which seems to increase slightly by boosting the swine with a second inoculation of 5 \u00c2 10 8 PFU/animal in PBS at 4 weeks post initial vaccination. 56 This vaccination protocol was shown to offer a significant degree of protection to the pigs, as five of six pigs were completely protected, while the remaining animal had significantly reduced signs of disease. Later, Moraes et al 57 showed that a single dose of 5 \u00c2 10 9 PFU/animal in PBS of a replication-defective HAd5 expressing the P1 coding region of FMDV strain A24 completely protected pigs against homologous challenge 7, 14 or 42 days after vaccination. Since efficacious vaccination is strain dependent and the infection with one serotype does not confer protection against another, HAd5 bicistronic vector vaccines have been developed, 58 decreasing the cost for multivalent adenoviral FMD vaccines. For the construction of these vectors, the P1 capsid coding region for both A24 and O1 strains and the 3C protease coding region of A12 strain were used. However, the neutralizing antibody response after vaccination with 2.5 \u00c2 10 9 PFU/animal in PBS of the bicistronic vector was considerably lower than that induced by a commercial FMD vaccine or the monovalent Ad-A24 vaccine. 57 Recently, a new strategy based on the fact that FMDV is highly sensitive to alpha/beta interferon (IFN-a/b) have been developed using a replication-defective HAd5. 59, 60 This strategy has been shown to completely protect pigs after vaccination with 10 9 PFU/animal when challenged 24 h later with virulent FMDV.",

Direct contact between infected and naive pigs is the predominant route of PRRSV transmission. Moreover, pneumonia caused by PRRSV infection is more severe in young pigs compared to adults and may be complicated by concurrent bacterial infection. 61 Gonin et al 62 observed that PRRSV-infected pigs present circulating antibodies responsible for viral neutralization mainly directed against GP 5 , an envelope protein. Gagnon et al 63 constructed a replication-defective HAd5 expressing the GP 5 protein and used this recombinant virus to immunize pigs using two intradermal injections with 5 \u00c2 10 8 -1 \u00c2 10 9 PFU/animal in a mixture containing 100 ml of PBS and 100 ml of poloxamer SP1017 at 0.02%. It was observed that following challenge given intranasally 14 days after the booster, pigs produced high antibody titers to GP 5 protein.

Several attempts have been made to develop efficacious recombinant TGEV vaccines. 65 The spike protein (S) was identified as the major inducer of TGEV-neutralizing antibodies and it mediates binding of TGEV to its cellular receptor. 66 Thus, HAd5 expressing the S protein was constructed and used to study the induction of antibodies providing protection in swine. 67 It was observed that porcine serum, elicited by 10 9 PFU/animal in PBS of this recombinant, when mixed with a lethal dose of virus prior to administration to susceptible pigs, prevented the replication of virulent TGEV administered orally as virus-antibody mixtures and fully protected swine from clinical signs and death. Moreover, the used dose did not produce any clinical symptoms in any of the more than 50 animals inoculated up to 10 weeks after inoculation, 68 suggesting that this vector can be used as a live vaccine in swine without secondary complications associated with the vector. However, a PAd vector could be more effective than HAd. Thus, Tuboly and Nagy 65 constructed a rPAd5 expressing the TGEV protein.

A rHAd5 expressing the nucleocapsid C protein (p14), which is highly conserved among many different pestiviruses, to which BVDV belongs, was constructed and shown to induced both humoral and cellular immune responses after vaccination with 10 9 PFU/animal, in a mouse model. 77 The E2 protein of BVDV, which is a major viral glycoprotein, was also used for mice immunization using the same vector and dose. 78 A strong humoral immune response was detected as the presence of a strong memory response to the E2 protein. Both strategies used an inducer/promoter allowing the generation of rAd in which the production of the transgene may be toxic and permitting the control of the transgene expression in vitro and in vivo. Finally, a rBAd3 expressing BVDV E2 protein was constructed and shown to induce BVDV E2-specific mucosal and systemic immune responses after intranasal immunization with 10 7 PFU/animal of cotton rats. 79 Despite the fact that mice immunized with recombinant fowl pox virus or with a DNA vaccine expressing E2 glycoprotein induced E2-specific immune responses, it was also observed that the neutralization titers were low. 79 Bovine parainfluenza virus type 3.

Breker-Klassen et al 80 constructed two rHAd5 encoding either the F or the HN protein of bPIV3. It was shown that intranasal vaccination with 5 \u00c2 10 7 PFU/animal in PBS of cotton rats produced a strong serological response within 21 days, which increased with the second vaccination.

Moreover, gD-specific maternal antibody did not significantly alter either mucosal or systemic gD-specific immune response. In addition, BHV-1 glycoprotein gC was also tested in its ability to induce protective immunity to BHV-1 in cattle by intranasal administration of 10 10 PFU/animal using a replication-defective HAd5. 84 However, it was observed that the highest BHV-1 neutralizing antibody titers were obtained with rHAd5 expressing the gD protein followed by the live vaccine.",

Currently, attenuated tissue culture vaccines used to control RP and PPR viruses have been successfully used for many years. Being safe and effective, they provide complete and lifelong protection with a single subcutaneous inoculation. 85, 86 However, for vaccination programs, the oral route of administration would be more economical. Moreover, the parenteral way of administration means that the current vaccine cannot be used in wildlife.

However, supplementing cell culture media with such components presents several drawbacks like lot to lot variation, potential risk of contamination by viruses, mycoplasma, prions, etc. 87 Furthermore, regulatory authorities in Europe (European Medicines Agency (EMEA)) and in the United States (Food and Drug Administration (FDA)) have encouraged biological manufacturers to reduce or eliminate the use of substances of animal origin in their manufacturing processes. Recently, several serum and proteinfree culture media became commercially available.

Although Ad has the advantage to be produced at high titers (10 10 -10 11 PFU/ml), 19 to obtain a good immune response in a large proportion of treated animals, particularly for mucosal vaccination, large doses and thus culture volumes are required. Further process development aiming at higher yields of product is clearly necessary. Improvements in volumetric production can be achieved by increasing the cell density at which cells can be infected without lowering the specific yield of the product; however, production of Ad vectors that maintain a high specific yield in batch operation is limited to cell densities in the range of 1 \u00c2 10 6 cells/ml; several approaches have been made in order to overcome this so-called 'cell density effect': 88 (hpi) together with periodical pH adjustments, allowed a sustained maximum specific productivity at 1.6 \u00c2 10 6 cells/ml whereas Nadeau et al, 90 further improved this strategy by also adding essential amino acids at 24 hpi thereby stabilizing volumetric productivity at cell densities above 2 \u00c2 10 6 and below 3 \u00c2 10 6 cells/ ml. Such results hint at the existence of substrate limitation and/or byproduct inhibition at high cell densities. At production scale, medium exchange will increase the cost of the final product, which is even more critical when this is to be used in the veterinary field. Perfusion mode operation has been attempted as a means to control the culture environment and remove toxic byproducts; 24,91 nevertheless, the cell-specific productivity could only be maintained by infecting cells at densities up to 3 \u00c2 10 6 cells/ml using high perfusions rates of two reactor volumes per day, at 2 days postinfection, a very costly proposition. 24 In our laboratory, by understanding kinetics and metabolism of infection, typical cell concentration at infection have already been doubled and further improvements seem possible using a simple and nonexpensive fed-batch mode.",

Despite the fact that chromatographic purification is an expensive method, ion exchange, hydrophobic interaction, metal chelate and size-exclusion chromatography have been evaluated for capture and purification of HAd5. 92 Kamen and Henry 24 developed a complex and expensive method for gene therapy application consisting of: (i) harvest of infected cells by continuous centrifugation, (ii) cell lysis by osmotic shock, (iii) DNAse treatment with centrifugal/conditioning, (iv) filtration, (v) anionexhange chromatography, (vi) ultrafiltration/concentration and (vii) size exclusion chromatography. This protocol allows large-scale purification of Ad vectors with purity comparable to the CsCl gradient method; however, it dramatically increases the final product price, well beyond the reach of veterinary utilization. Introgen developed a method consisting of a single ion chromatography run, after concentration/diafiltration and nuclease treatment, with a total recovery of the virus product of 70%. 93 In our laboratory, a protocol to purify HAd5 from the bulk harvested directly from the bioreactor after lysis (without a concentration step) using an ion exchange chromatographic step, ultrafiltration and a final polishing step with gel filtration is in progress with promising preliminary results.",
