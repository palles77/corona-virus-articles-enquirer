Storage at temperatures lower than 20 C preserved the infectivity, while at 4~C appreciable loss occurred between 92 and 185 days. Freeze-drying or desiccation at 22 C caused only insignificant loss of infectivity. Virus preparations were not affected by pH values between 2.5 and 10.3. Inactivation by UV occurred more rapidly than with herpes, toga and rhabdoviruses. Berne virus infectivity was ~ensitive to pronase and B. subtilu~ proteinase. It was not inactivated by trypsin and chymotrypsin treatment, which resulted in enhancement of infectivity; low concentrations of pronase (< 10 ug ml ') had a similar effect on Berne virus. Neither phospholipase C or RNase, alone or in combination, nor sodium deoxycholate (0.1%) inactivated the virus; in contrast, Triton X-100 (0.1%; 1.0~) caused rapid inactivation with a constant level of residual infectivity.",

The core is tubular in appearance and has a morphology indicative of helical nucleocapsid symmetry.

Whereas ortho-and paramyxoviruses, and rhabdo-, retro-and arenaviruses are inactivated at pH values <: 5.0 (for reviews see Andrewes et al., 1978; Matthews, 1982) and some togaviruses even at pH < 6.0 (Horzinek, 1981) , Berne virus retained its infectivity titers even at pH 2.5. This behaviour resembles that of nonenveloped enteric viruses, e.g. entero-or reoviruses, and may indicate that Berne virus has adapted to passage through the gastrointestinal tract. Again, TGEV is not acid resistant and its pathogenic potential is explained by the lack of hydrochloric acid in the stomach of young piglets (Aynaud, personal communication, 1984) . Berne virus, however, can infect older animals, as we have shown by seroepidemiological studies in a stud farm .",

Replication of Breda virus in gut epithelium has been detected by immunofluorescence (Woode et al., 1982) and thin-section electron microscopy (Pohlenz et al., 1984) . At the present state of knowledge, their properties may be summarized as follows: toroviruses are enveloped RNA viruses containing an elongated tubular nucleocapsid of presumably helical symmetry. The capsid may be bent into an open torus, conferring a disk-or kidney-shaped morphology to the virion (largest diameter 120--140 nm) or it may be straight, resulting in a rod-shaped particle (dimensions 35 \u00d7 170 rim). The lipoprotein membrane is studded with projections and a hemagglutinating activity has been demonstrated for Breda virus (Woode et al., 1982) . Major structural proteins of 22 kD and 20 kD have been identified, the latter occurring in the capsid (Horzinek et al., 1985) . Replication is dependent upon some nuclear function of the host cell. Evidence of infection with toroviruses has been obtained in ungulates, lagomorphs, rodents and humans and indication of enteric infection and/or disease, exists for equines, bovines and humans (Horzinek and Weiss, 1984) . The properties described in this paper, e.g. stability at low pH, resistance to trypsin, chymotrypsin and I)OC are in agreement with the ecological niche toroviruses seem to occupy. Their resistance to desiccation would favour their spread in nature.",
