Two cell-adapted strains of PEDV (KPEDV-9 and SM98LVec) were subjected to HA test against erythrocytes of various origin. Both strains showed HA activity with rabbit erythrocytes only after treatment with trypsin or neuraminidase. Optimal conditions for inducing HA activity of PEDV were 2 h incubation at 37\u00b0C using phosphatebuffered saline containing 0.1% BSA. These results suggest that the HA activity of PEDV is most likely caused by proteolytic action on it, which could be developed as a new diagnostic method to rapidly detect and differentiate PEDV infections from other enteric diseases.",

            "text": "Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is a member of the family Coronaviridae and is closely related to human coronavirus 229E, transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) [3, 30] . This virus causes porcine epidemic diarrhea, an enteric disease characterized by acute watery diarrhea and dehydration [8] . The clinical and pathological symptoms of PEDV infection are similar to transmissible gastroenteritis, making it difficult to differentiate between the two [21] . Although PEDV has become enzootic in several countries [4] , seasonal outbreaks, resulting in death of neonatal piglets as well as weight loss in fattening pigs, continue to cause serious economic losses in the swine industry [5] . Prophylactic vaccines capable of preventing the initial stages of viral infection usually induce neutralizing antibodies against the viral pathogen [20] . Due to the economic importance of PEDV, cell-adapted strains of the virus have been developed as live attenuated vaccines [16] . Other vaccine candidates have focused on the CO-26K equivalent (COE) domain located on the spike protein, which is reported to contain a neutralizing epitope against PEDV [12] . Hemagglutination (HA) is a specific form of agglutination involving red blood cells. Several viruses are capable of inducing hemagglutination through interaction of the viral surface proteins with the cellular receptors found on the surface of erythrocytes. This property has been widely used for quantitation and analysis of several viruses, including orthomyxoviruses, paramyxoviruses, and encephalomyocarditis virus [18] . Some viruses belonging to the family Coronaviridae have also been reported to possess HA activity. These include human coronavirus OC43 (HCoV OC43) [13, 31] , bovine coronavirus (BCoV) [22] , hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (HEV) [10] , TGEV [19] , murine hepatitis virus (MHV) [28] , and avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) [1] .",

Vero cells, grown to confluence in a 25-cm 2 TC flask (SPL Labware), was inoculated with 20 HA units of KPEDV-9 and then cultured in serum-free MEM at 37\u00b0C, 5% CO 2 . Samples of the culture supernatant were taken at 0, 8, 16, 20, and 24 h post-inoculation (hpi) and titrated by focus formation assay as described previously [7] . At the same time, the same samples were treated with 10 lg/ml trypsin and subjected to the HA test. Figure 2 shows the comparative levels of HA units/focus-forming units of KPEDV-9. Within a 24-h period, the KPEDV-9 titer in the culture supernatant increased from 8 9 10 2 ffu per ml at 8 hpi to 1 9 10 5 ffu per ml at 24 hpi. Similarly, the HA titer of KPEDV-9 was measured at 2 HA units at 8 hpi and 32 HA units at 24 hpi. There is a positive correlation between the HA titer and infectious titer by ffa in KPEDV-9. However, the ratio of HA unit/ffu was not consistent among the samples tested, Fig. 1 Trypsin treatment of PEDV induces HA activity with rabbit erythrocytes. KPEDV-9 and SM98LVec were treated with various concentrations of trypsin at 37\u00b0C for 30 min prior to HA test. Spent culture media from non-infected Vero cells was used as mock virus suggesting that the HA titer of PEDV cannot be precisely translated into infectious units. Nonetheless, measuring the HA titer may be sufficient for monitoring the rate of virus growth.",

AF353511.1), this virus lacks the HE protein responsible for the HA activity of other coronaviruses like MHV-DVIM, huCoV OC43 and BRCV G95 [3] . Therefore, our primary assumption is that the HA activity of PEDV is attributed to the S protein. We further investigated the HA activity of the PEDV S protein by subjecting the virus or rabbit erythrocytes to neuraminidase treatment. This is based on several reports that focused on the HA activity of the spike protein of IBV and TGEV. Schultz et al. [24, 25] reported that the HA activity of IBV and TGEV can be induced by treating the virions with the neuraminidase enzyme, which removes the alpha 2,3-linked N-acetylneuraminic acid from the virus surface, while Schwegmann et al. [26] showed that neuraminidase treatment of bovine erythrocytes at less than 3 U/ml did not completely abolish agglutination by TGEV, indicating that a large amount of sialic acid on the surface of the erythrocytes was not necessary for hemagglutination by this virus. Briefly, KPEDV-9 and SM98LVec were prepared by culturing in Vero cells without supplementing with trypsin, following the method described earlier. The supernatants were harvested after 24 h then clarified by centrifugation. The virus suspensions were separated into two groups. One group was treated with 10 lg/ml trypsin as described earlier, while the other group was treated with 50 mU/ml of neuraminidase from Clostridium perfringens (Sigma-Aldrich) at 37\u00b0C for 30 min with shaking and then purified by ultracentrifugation. The purified virus was diluted to the original volume using PBS and then subjected to HA test.",

The newly prepared cultures of KPEDV-9 and SM98LVec showed HA titers of 8 HA units after trypsin treatment and 2 and 4 HA units, respectively, after neuraminidase treatment. The discrepancy in the HA titer of KPEDV-9 obtained with the recent virus preparation compared to the previous preparation may have been caused by variations in the efficiency of virus replication under non-trypsin conditions. Nonetheless, the resulting HA titers were sufficient for this particular study. Differences in the HA activity between trypsin-treated and neuraminidase-treated virus can be attributed to two factors: efficiency of virus recovery during purification after neuraminidase treatment and inherent differences in the mechanism of activation of HA activity by trypsin and neuraminidase, which were not elucidated in this study. Meanwhile, neuraminidase treatment of rabbit erythrocytes did not abolish the HA activity of PEDV (Table 2) . While neuraminidase-induced HA activity of PEDV was observed in rabbit erythrocytes, a similar treatment was not established for erythrocytes from other species.",

Large variations exist among members of the family Coronaviridae in their ability to agglutinate erythrocytes. HEV readily agglutinates chicken erythrocytes at room temperature and forms a relatively permanent bond with the erythrocytes [10] . In the case of MHV, while several strains contain the HE glycoprotein, only the MHV-DVIM strain has been shown to cause hemagglutination [9, 27] . HA activity of IBV was first revealed after trypsin, phospholipase C, and neuraminidase treatment [6, 14] . Noda et al. [19] reported in 1987 that TGEV grown in primary swine kidney cell cultures agglutinated erythrocytes from chicken, guinea pig and cattle but not erythrocytes from mouse and goose at 4\u00b0C.

In addition, HA activity was only induced by treatment with either trypsin or neuraminidase, similar to that of TGEV and IBV. On the basis of these results, it can be concluded that the HA activity of PEDV is dependent on the removal of the neuraminic acid on the virion surface through either trypsin or neuraminidase treatment. The ability of PEDV to agglutinate rabbit erythrocytes, but not chicken or pig erythrocytes, can be used as a diagnostic tool to differentiate PED from TGE infection. This is particularly useful because both PEDV and TGEV infections exhibit similar clinical manifestations, and differentiation by other methods such as RT-PCR, ELISA or other commercial test kits is rather expensive. Further studies are needed to understand the mechanism of PEDV HA activity. Nonetheless, these findings provide primary insight for the development of new diagnostic methods for PEDV detection.",
