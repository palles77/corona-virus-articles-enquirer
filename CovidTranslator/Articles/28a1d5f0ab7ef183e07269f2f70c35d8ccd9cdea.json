            "text": "Vaccines are essential for controlling disease in livestock, companion, and zoo animals and wildlife and for controlling fertility and disease in pest species. Effective mucosal vaccines have myriad advantages over parenteral vaccines that are shared across human and veterinary species. For instance, mucosal vaccines stimulate both the mucosal and systemic immune systems, meaning that mucosal vaccines can reduce pathogen colonization and shedding and thus protect the population or herd against infection. Major challenges for mucosal immunization are to generate effective immunity instead of immunological tolerance as well as overcoming interference from passively acquired maternal antibodies. Oral tolerance is a suppressive mechanism designed to prevent the host immune system from overreacting to innocuous antigens such as those present in feed or commensal flora [1] . Once oral tolerance has been induced, subsequent exposure to that antigen from mucosal or systemic routes will prevent induction of a robust immune response [2] . The vast majority of mucosal vaccines use live attenuated forms of a pathogen that can replicate in the target species, avoiding induction of oral tolerance, but under very rare circumstances may revert back to virulence. Other forms of live vaccines include viruses such as replication-deficient adenovirus [3] , canarypox virus carrier vaccines [4] , and others that act as a vector to express genes of interest from various pathogens. These carrier viruses have no ability or limited ability to replicate in the immunized species; nor is reversion to a replication competent, highly infectious virus possible, making them a safer vaccine choice. There are some reports that mucosal delivery of live viral vaccine to the upper respiratory tract may overcome maternal antibody interference [5] . Previous chapters provided detailed analyses of the numerous advantages of mucosal vaccines, and these will not be discussed in depth here. Instead, aspects of mucosal vaccine development that are particularly important for the veterinary field, such as mass delivery, vaccines that differentiate between infection and vaccination (which has important trade implications), and economic considerations, will be discussed. Examples of the numerous commercially available mucosal veterinary vaccines and discussion of novel experimental vaccines will be provided. Vaccine development for administration in veterinary species to protect human health will also be discussed.",

Most important, mass delivery of mucosal vaccines means that each individual animal does not need to be restrained, which can be extremely stressful for animals (especially those that are not routinely handled by humans), and restraint may be potentially hazardous to the person or teams of people administering the vaccines. A major drawback to mass delivery is that a uniform dose per animal is not always given across the population. Other mucosal routes that require restraint are vaccines administered intranasally, by drenching (oral immunization by syringe), or through eyedrop (conjunctival) administration. These delivery methods have the advantage that they promote a mucosal immune response and the dose per animal is easily controlled, but they do require animal restraint, which makes them more expensive to deliver.",

            "text": "With today's global economy, trade in animals and in animal products such as meat, eggs, and fur occurs locally, nationally, and internationally. For trade purposes, it is advantageous to be able to distinguish animals that have been infected by disease from animals that have been vaccinated. Vaccines that allow for the immunological differentiation between animals that have been infected and those that have been vaccinated are called DIVA vaccines. DIVA vaccines often lack one or more proteins present in the wild-type microorganism, which can be determined through immune assays. The first-generation DIVA vaccines were developed when it was discovered that pigs vaccinated with the attenuated strains of Aujeszky's disease virus did not develop antibody against select protein epitopes [6] , whereas animals infected by wild-type viruses did have these protein-specific antibodies in their serum. These first-generation marker vaccines were soon improved upon by using genetically modified live vaccines that lacked selected glycoproteins [7] , and enzyme-linked immune sorbent assays were developed that could determine which pigs were vaccinated because they lacked antibodies against the glycoprotein but had antibodies specific for other PrV proteins [8] . By using these strains as vaccines or genetically engineered live viral vaccines, researchers could track the success of eradication efforts; this resulted in effective eradication programs of the disease in many parts of Europe [8] . Without the option of using DIVA vaccines, producers may choose not to vaccinate so as to avoid the presence of antibodies in the herd that they cannot guarantee are due to the vaccine and not the presence of the diseasecausing agent in their herd. At the same time, vaccines made from live viruses, such as replication-deficient adenovirus that express genes of interest from various pathogens or modified viruses with select genes deleted, are considered genetically modified organisms (GMOs). Animals vaccinated with GMOs may face regulatory hurdles that must be overcome before the products from these animals can be sold. Indeed, some countries are reluctant to license GMO vaccines.",

Further, the vaccine will be used only if it is sufficiently affordable such that its use does not significantly reduce profitability. Depending on the disease, how easily it spreads, and how well the infectious agent survives in the environment, culling of a barn rather than mass vaccination may be a more economically feasible option to clear an infection. However, from a welfare point of view, such a practice is highly problematic and often results in public outcry. Moreover, as antimicrobialresistant pathogens continue to emerge, there is increasing pressure to raise livestock with reduced levels of antibiotics. Vaccines offer the potential of controlling such infections and represent effective alternatives to antibiotics.",

This disease can lead to genital lesions and reduced fertility in rams, placentitis and abortions in ewes, and increased perinatal mortality in lambs [11] . While safer than subcutaneous vaccination, conjunctival vaccination with live Brucella melitensis Rev 1 vaccine can causes abortions, is highly virulent, and is not a DIVA vaccine; therefore it is not recommended in countries that are free from B. melitensis [12] . Alternatively, conjunctival immunization in rams using a thermoresponsive and mucoadhesive in situ gel composed of poloxamer 407 (P407) and chitosan (Ch) could effectively deliver recombinant BLS-OMP31. (BLS is part of the enzyme lumazine synthase from Brucella spp. that is both highly immunogenic and a carrier of foreign peptides and B. ovis antigen OMP31 [13] .) Serum and preputial, saliva, lacrimal, and nasal secretions showed significant antigen-specific IgG antibody, and the levels remained elevated in serum only for several months. Relative to unvaccinated rams, the rams from the vaccinated cohort showed significant induction of antigen-specific SIgA after the first and second immunization in lacrimal, preputial, or nasal secretions (but not in nasal secretions or in serum), but antibodies levels declined rapidly [14] . Further, conjunctival immunization induced a significant BLS-OMP31-specific hypersensitivity response to intradermal injections relative to the control rams, which indicates induction of cell-mediated immunity. Conjunctival administration of BLS-OMP31-P407-Ch may be a promising alternative to current B. ovis immunization strategies.",

However, while maternal antibodies are critically required to protect the vulnerable neonate against infectious diseases, circulating maternal antibodies interfere with the neonate's ability to develop its own immunity (referred to as maternal interference). Because colostrum is composed mainly of IgG1 (which is not transported across the mucosal epithelium of the upper respiratory tract) and although IgA does cross the mucosa, dimeric IgA makes up only 10% of antibodies in colostrum, it was suggested that the upper respiratory tract may not be affected by maternal interference. To test this hypothesis, cows were vaccinated with modified live bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) vaccine composed of BHV-1, BVDV-1, BVDV-2, PI-3, and BRSV antigens. Calves were shown to have high circulating maternally derived IgG antibodies serum but extremely low titers of maternally derived IgG in nasal secretions [22] . Maternally derived IgA in nasal secretions were present but at much lower levels than in serum. Calves (3\u00c08 days old) either were not vaccinated against BVDV or received one or two (day 0 and day 35) immunizations by the intranasal route. Within 5\u00c07 days after birth, maternally derived IgA in nasal secretions were not detected. Calfderived (i.e., endogenous) BVDV1-and BVDV-2-specific IgA production was detected within 10 days after vaccination. A secondary intranasal vaccination after 5 weeks induced a strong memory antibody response with sustained IgA levels in nasal secretions. Collectively, these studies demonstrated that the mucosal immune system in newborn calves is functional and responsive to vaccination without being affected by maternal interference.",

Standard laying houses are reported to hold from 100,000 to 500,000 hens, and broiler houses routinely house 20,000 birds. With these numbers, it is not surprising that the industry has actively sought vaccines that could be administered by mucosal routes rather than by parenteral routes, which generally rely on injection with needles. The majority of mucosal avian vaccines are live viruses administered by eyedropper into the eye (intraocular or conjunctival), orally into the drinking water, as a coarse spray whereby birds consume the vaccine during preening, and through the in ovo route. In-feed oral vaccination and spray cabinet (intranasal) routes are also used for some commercial vaccines. In ovo injection has become widely used as a means to deliver precise, uniform doses with the capacity to inject up to 60,000 eggs per hour. In ovo immunization has the added benefit that this method avoids stress to chicks, is sanitary, and has an earlier exposure time than any other immunization method.",

Immunizations for multiple forms of avian influenza are under way as experimental vaccines. For instance, Lactobacillus plantarum NC8 strain was engineered to express select peptides from H9N2 AIV. Both oral and intranasal vaccination of 3week-old white leghorn layer chickens succeeded in inducing immunity, but the intranasal route induced stronger immunity and showed less body weight loss, lung virus titers, and pathology after challenge with the H9N2 virus [24] .

Although the vaccine was administered subcutaneously, anti-MOMP IgA increased 10-to 100-fold at ocular and upper genital tract (UGT) sites in 50% and 40% of the koalas, respectively. The PmpG vaccine also triggered a 10-to 100-fold increase post vaccine IgA antibodies at the UGT or the ocular sites in 40% and 50% of koalas, respectively, which suggests that the vaccines elicited a mucosal response in at least some of the koalas. The cohort vaccinated with MOMP vaccine showed decreased chlamydia loads with no new occurrence of infection, but the other vaccination group and the control group showed increased loads with incidences of new infections, suggesting that the MOMP vaccine may be superior [31] .

This time frame suggests that even if fish have a functional immune system, they may not develop immunity in a timely manner to protect them from infection. The major causative agents of infectious diseases in finfish aquaculture include bacteria, viruses, parasites, and fungi. Infectious agents can infect fish at some developmental stages and not at others. Although some fish may have a functional immune system in the larva or fry stage, others may not, which means that proper biosecurity rather than vaccination may be critical to protecting them against infection.

Delivery of an effective mucosal vaccine (i.e., not relying on injections or darting) for wildlife or zoo animals would be ideal for administration, as it would be less stressful to the animal and present less risk to the person administering the vaccine. Experimental work in rabbits showed that rabbit ZP glycoprotein B delivered by infection with myxoma virus resulted in infertility in 25% of female rabbits [56] . Brushtail possums (Trichosurus vulpecula) were vaccinated with bacterial ghosts (BGs) expressing ZP protein introduced through oral, intranasal/conjunctival, parenteral, and intraduodenal routes. Anti-ZP antibodies were detected in the serum and the ovarian follicular fluid after intranasal/conjunctival immunization [57] . Intraduodenal, but not oral administration of the vaccine, elicited significant systemic immune responses, indicating that protection of BG vaccines from degradation by gastric acidity would enhance the effectiveness of orally delivered vaccines. Superovulation and artificial insemination was used to assess the effect of the immunization with BG-delivered ZP. Immunization by the nasal/conjunctival route resulted in induced antibody-mediated and cell-mediated immune responses, and significantly fewer eggs were fertilized in immunized possum females [58] . Field trials will need to be performed to determine whether mucosal immunization with BG containing possum ZP antigens is suitable for fertility control of wild possum populations.",

The immunized cows had a greater number of follicular waves and a greater number of follicles during the estrous cycle, which could be used as a potential source of oocytes for use in in vitro fertilization and embryo transfer programs [62] . Advances have been made with mucosally delivered inhibin vaccines. In buffalo, nasal immunization with a DNA vaccine coding for inhibin and delivered by attenuated Salmonella Cholerasuis has been shown to improve follicle development and fertility [63] . However, the buffalo in this trial underwent estrous synchronization, which would not be feasible in the wild and will have to be investigated further to establish its feasibility as a fertility vaccine. While immunization against select targets may affect fertility, care should be taken that targeting a natural protein may affect other pathways that are important for the animal's health.
