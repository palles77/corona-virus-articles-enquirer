However, despite its classical clinical presentation of mental status changes and behavioral abnormalities, the disorder is not well known in the psychiatric literature and premortem diagnosis is rare. We recently participated in the care of a patient who spent two months on a psychiatric service and in whom a medical disorder was consistently suspected but not confirmed until autopsy revealed paraneoplastic limbic encephalitis and two primary systemic malignancies. A detailed neuropsychiatric description of this clinical entity is provided from presentation to autopsy with review of the literature.",

His chief complaint was \"I'm feeling low, but I've been healthy all my life.\" Five weeks earlier, he experienced sudden-onset amnesia following the death of his brother. This was first noticed during the funeral, when he appeared confused, needed help orienting himself, and exhibited no memory of his N.J. Newman et al. brother's death. On initial admission to a community hospital for medical/neurological evaluation, he was ambulatory and able to perform activities of daily living, but was confused, and had poor short-term memory. Evaluation revealed no specific medical etiology for his memory problems; routine laboratory tests, thyroid function studies, carotid noninvasive studies, and liver-spleen scan were normal. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was clear and colorless with a glucose of 91 mg%, protein of 54 mg%, and 7% lymphocytes. Electroencephalogram (EEG) was normal. Brain scans by computer-assisted tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed asymmetric dilation of the left lateral ventricle.",

The exact anatomic boundaries of the limbic system are still a matter of some debate; physiological and molecular studies constantly redefine what constitutes a functional system within the br~n (Levitt et al. 1986 ). Over 100 years ago, Broca (1878) first described the anatomic~ly unified deep brain structures considered to be the core of the limbic system, and 50 years later, Papez (1937) suggested ~*hat this region was essential for human emotions. The main areas include the hippocampus, ~mygdala and other mesial temporal lobe structures, insula, cingulate gyms, pyriform cortex, orbital surface of the frontal lobe, hypothalamus, and occasionally, portions of basal ganglia s~ructures. Animal studies and observations in humans with anatomically localized disease further support the widely held view that the limbic system plays a central role in emotional and affective display and memory, as well as in various aspects of hormonal and visceral control (Himme!hoch et al. 1970; Torrey and Peterson 1974; Koella 1984; Isaacson 1982; Cornelius et al. 1986 ).",

Indeed, when information is provided on type of initial hospitalization, 10 of 19 patients were admitted to psychiatric services and treated with psychotropic medications and even electroconvulsive therapy (Brierly et al. 1960; Glaser and Pincus 1969; Himmelhoch et al. 1970; Dubas et al. 1982a; Dubas et al. 1982b; Richardson 1985; Cornelius et al. 1986; Camara and Chelune 1987; Tandon et al. 1988 ).

In several other paraneopiastic syndromes of the nervous system, a causal agent or a pathophysiological mechanism has been strongly suspected or proven to exist: for example, progressive multifocal leukencephalopathy due to JC papova virus (no longer considered a paraneoplastic syndrome once the etiological agent was discovered); Eaton-Lambert syndrome secondary to antibodies directed against components of the presynaptic membrane of the neuromuscular junction; cerebellar degeneration linked with anti-Purkinje cell antibodies (raising the question of common tumor cell and cerebellar antigens and a resultant autoimmune pathology); and paraneoplastic sensory neuropathy associated with antisensory neuronal antibodies (Lang et al. 1981; Jaeckle et al. 198~; Palma 1985; Graus et al. 1986; Greenlee and Lipton 1986; Anderson and Posner 1987) . Similar etiologies have been proposed for limbic encephalitis, the first involving direct viral infection. The pathology suggests an infective etiology, and 2 cases have been reported to exhibit intranuclear (Himmelhoch et al. 1970 ) and intracytoplasmic (Kaplan and Itabishi 1974) inclusion bodies; however, no viral particles have ever been isolated. Laviet al. (1988) have described a mouse model of viral-induced encephalitis, anatomically restricted to the limbic system and its connections, produced by intranasal inoculation of a coronavirus into mice. Intracerebral inoculation of Borna virus in rats and primates produces a clinicopathological entity very similar to human limh~c encephalitis (Sprankel et al. 1978; Narayan et al. 1983; Ludwig et al. 1988) . Interestingly, Borna virds may play an etiological role in affective disorders, as suggested by the increased incidence of Borna vi:ms-specific antibodies in patients with bipolar and unipolar depression (Amsterdam et al. 1985; Rott et al. 1985; Ludwig et al. 1988) .",

            "text": "in conclusion, this patient's case demonstrated a puzzling, precipitous course that suggested an underlying medical disorder despite the lack of definite diagnosis during life. In retrospect, his smoking and occupational history could have contributed risk factors for development of malignancy. However, until autopsy, no laboratory studies revealed carcinoma in either lung or kidney. His initial presentation suggested a possible psychogenic component with grief over his brother's death. However, his persistent disorientation and the extreme hypotension and hypothermia despite the passage of time, treatment for infections, and changes in medication, indicated an atypical syndrome of uncertain medical etiology. His autonomic signs and his delirium on and off psychotropic medications pointed to an etiology other than a degenerative dementia or iatrogenic delirium. Patients with limbic encephalitis can exhibit a prominent impairment of recent memory in combination with behaviors that range from depression and paranoia in a relatively intact sensorium to agitation and atypical bizarre actions with confusion and disorientation.",
