Key questions include the source (an infected human, animal, or insect vector), the transmission mechanism, and how the virus is shed and transmitted. Following transmission, pathogenesis is governed by the initial site of replication, whether the virus disseminates within the host, and its tropism for specific tissues and organs. In turn, these steps are dictated by the structure and replication strategy of the virus. In addition to utilizing selected synthetic biochemical pathways in the host cell, viruses frequently reprogram host cells by inducing intracellular signaling pathways that render the cell more permissive to infection. Host-virus interactions also control whether the infection is acute, chronic, latent, or transforming; how the virus interacts with the immune system; and the consequent pathophysiological response of the host. This chapter provides an overview of these basic concepts of viral pathogenesis, with emphasis on the interactions of viruses with their host cells and organisms.",

Virus attachment factors-in contrast to virus receptors-are cell surface molecules that support virus binding but are not required for virus infection. However, they can make virus attachment and infection more efficient. When infecting cells in tissue culture, the rate-limiting step in infection typically is attachment to the cell surface, as virions are in a large volume of media that minimizes chance encounters with cells. Anything that enhances this step can result in a much greater level of virus infection. The addition of a polycation such as diethylaminoethyl (DEAE)-dextran to virus-containing media typically boosts infection efficiency of tissue culture cells more than 10-fold, by serving as an electrostatic bridge, linking the virus to the cell surface. Glycosoaminoglycans, highly charged molecules on the cell surface, are well known factors that can result in more efficient virus attachment via electrostatic interactions. Multiple copies of viral attachment factors on the cell surface means that even low affinity interactions can result in high avidity binding of virus.",

Virus receptors are host cell molecules, most often glycoproteins on the plasma membrane, that not only bind virions but are often essential for subsequent virus infection ( Figure 1 ). Viral receptors are naturally occurring cellular molecules that serve physiological functions for the cell-functions that have nothing to do with infection. Viruses usually bind to their receptors with higher affinity than they do to attachment factors. Attachment of the virus particle to its cellular receptor is conferred by a virion surface protein, often called the viral attachment protein (VAP). As a rule, there is a single VAP although other viral surface proteins often play an essential role in the steps that follow the initial attachment of virions to the cell surface. For enveloped viruses, the VAP is a surface glycoprotein that oligomerizes to form spikes that protrude from the viral envelope. For nonenveloped viruses, the VAP is one of the surface proteins that form the external structure of the viral capsid. While binding to virus attachment factors is often electrostatic in nature, receptor binding usually occurs via a specific domain on the VAP, most often in the form of a pocket or \"canyon\" that subsequently interacts with a specific domain on the cellular receptor. These domains can be defined by structural studies and mutations introduced into the cellular receptor protein or the VAP. Antibodies neutralize virus by binding to the VAP in a way that blocks receptor binding. Since the receptorbinding domain on a VAP often lies in a recessed pocket where it is not directly accessible to antibodies, antibodies that bind to epitopes distant from the pocket can also neutralize the virus. Therefore, viral mutants may escape neutralization without affecting receptor binding. Such escape mutants allow many different virus serotypes to use the same receptor-binding domain of the VAP, as seen for rhinoviruses. Neutralizing antibody escape mutants of this kind are important for the persistence of some viruses, including HIV.",

The best studied example is binding of the influenza virus hemaglutinin protein to sialic acid (or N acetyl neuraminic acid), a modified sugar that is found on the tips of some of the branched carbohydrate side chains of glycosylated proteins and glycosphingolipids. Different influenza hemagglutinins bind preferentially to different terminal sialic acid residues, depending on the linkage of the sialic acid to a proximal galactose or galactosamine molecule in the carbohydrate chain. Thus, human-type A influenza viruses bind most avidly to sialic acid \u03b1-2,3 galactose configurations while avian-type A influenza viruses bind best to sialic acid \u03b1-2,6 galactose. This exquisite specificity of the interaction between the VAP and its cellular receptor helps explain the species tropism of influenza viruses, since different host species express different sialic acid linkages. In turn, this distinction can determine whether an avian or porcine influenza virus can efficiently infect humans (Shinya et al., 2006) .",

While virus attachment factors merely support virus binding, virus receptors do something else: they either induce conformational changes in viral proteins that are required for membrane penetration and/or result in delivery of virions to a cellular domain or compartment that is required for entry. This distinction explains why attachment factors are not required for virus infection whereas receptors are required. A host molecule can be considered to be a virus receptor if its elimination from an animal model or one or more cell types prevents infection. The loss of a receptor may not block infection of all cell types since some viruses can utilize more than one receptor. As an example, lab-adapted strains of measles virus use CD46 as a receptor to infect cells, while wild-type strains use CD150 as a receptor to infect lymphocytes, and nectin 4 to infect epithelial cells.",

Humans express DPPT4, but mice, hamsters, or ferrets do not and are not susceptible to infection. Molecular studies show that five amino acids in the binding domain of DPPT4 differ between human and hamster cells. Furthermore, DPPT4 on camel cells binds the MERS-CoV attachment protein. This observation provided an explanation for the apparent role of camels as an intermediate host responsible for transmission of this virus to humans (van Doorenmalen et al., 2014) . Marmoset cell DPPT4 binds MERS-CoV with affinity similar to that of human cells, and marmosets are an excellent model host for this virus (Falzarano et al., 2014) .",

The key step in virus entry is penetration of a cellular membrane. For enveloped viruses, delivery of the viral genome across the lipid bilayer of the virus and a cellular membrane is accomplished by a membrane fusion reaction. For nonenveloped viruses, the viral genome is usually delivered across a cellular membrane by a pore that is formed by protein components of the viral capsid.

A number of cellular cues induce the irreversible conformational changes in viral proteins that lead to membrane fusion in the case of enveloped viruses, or membrane penetration in the case of nonenveloped viruses (Figure 2 ). One of the best understood is low pH. Many viruses, after binding to receptors on the cell surface, are endocytosed and delivered to endosomes where the low pH environment induces changes in viral structural proteins that mediate membrane fusion by protonating acidic residues (Helenius et al., 1980) . The low pH-dependent entry of many enveloped viruses is exemplified by influenza virus. Nonenveloped viruses may also use this pathway, but instead of eliciting membrane fusion the acidic environment induces structural changes in the viral capsid that result in exposure of hydrophobic domains that insert into the cellular membrane, forming a pore through which the viral genome can pass ( Figure 2 ). While many viruses use low pH as a trigger to induce membrane fusion or penetration, other viruses use one or more receptors to trigger needed conformational changes for virus entry. HIV entry is an example of pH-independent entry. The HIV Env binds to CD4, a cell surface protein found on some types of T cells, macrophages, and DCs. CD4 binding induces conformational changes in Env that then enables it to bind to a second receptor, termed a coreceptor ( Figure 2 ). The coreceptors for HIV are the chemokine receptors CCR5 and CXCR4, seven transmembrane After binding to cell surface receptors, poliovirus is endocytosed and ultimately delivered to low pH endosomes. There, the low pH environment triggers conformational changes in the viral capsid that result in exposure of hydrophobic domains that insert into the endosomal membrane, forming a protein pore through which the viral genome can exit and enter the cytoplasm. C. Entry of HIV. HIV attaches to the cell surface via binding to various attachment factors such as DC-SIGN. The first required step for entry is binding of the viral envelope glycoprotein to CD4, a type 1 integral membrane protein. This binding event triggers structural alterations in the envelope glycoprotein that induce the exposure of a second receptor binding domain that engages the chemokine coreceptors CCR5 or CXCR4. Coreceptor binding triggers additional changes in envelope that enable it to elicit membrane fusion with the cell membrane.",

While receptors and triggering mechanisms for virus entry are major determinants of viral tropism, other host factors can also influence cellular susceptibility. A number of enveloped viruses are not infectious when they bud from cells because one of the viral surface glycoproteins requires proteolytic cleavage by a host cell protease to be activated. Viruses that have Class I membrane fusion proteins (retroviruses, orthomyxoviruses, paramyxoviruses) are examples. In such instances, infectious virus is only produced by replication in cell types that express the appropriate protease, which is localized in the secretory pathway. Alternatively, some viral fusion glycoproteins may be cleaved by enzymes in extracellular fluid. In many instances, the degree of susceptibility to proteolytic cleavage is determined by a few amino acids (such as one vs several arginines) at the site of cleavage, so that mutations in 1-2 critical amino acids can alter the tissue tropism of a virus by making it more or less susceptible to this critically important proteolytic cleavage event.",

Virulent isolates of Newcastle disease virus encode a fusion protein that is readily cleaved by furin, a proteolytic enzyme present in the Golgi apparatus, so that the protein is activated during maturation prior to reaching the cell surface, and before budding of nascent virions. This makes it possible for virulent strains of the virus to infect many avian cell types, thereby increasing its tissue host range, and causing systemic infections that are often lethal. In contrast, avirulent strains of Newcastle virus encode a variant fusion protein that is not cleaved during maturation in the Golgi, so that nascent virus requires activation by an extracellular protease. The required protease is found only in the respiratory or enteric tracts, thereby limiting tropism to surface cells and conferring an attenuated phenotype on the virus (Panda et al., 2004) . Host cell transcription factors can influence the tropism of some viruses. Papillomaviruses replicate in skin and may cause tumors, varying from benign warts to malignant cancer of the cervix. Papillomaviruses commence their replication in germinal cells that are permissive for replication of the viral genomes. However, germinal cells produce proteins that block the transcription of late structural genes of the virus. As the infected basal cells move outward and begin to differentiate, they become permissive for transcription and translation of the papillomavirus structural genes, so that complete infectious virus is only formed in cells that are about to be sloughed. Release of virus from the superficial layers of dead cells promotes the transmission of infection to new sites on the infected person and also to new uninfected hosts (Doorbar et al., 2012) .",

Certain viruses, such as rhinoviruses that replicate in the epithelial cells of the nose and throat, have evolved to replicate optimally at 33 \u00b0C. As a result, such viruses are usually restricted in their tissue distribution by their relative inability to replicate at 37 \u00b0C, which limits their spread beyond the upper respiratory tract. The harsh environment of the gastrointestinal tract can impact virus tropism as well, due to the acid pH of the stomach, the alkaline pH of the intestine, and the destructive effects of pancreatic digestive enzymes.

Instead, these viruses trigger internalization by activating macropinocytosis-an example of viruses reprogramming cells to assist virus replication (Marsh and Helenius, 2006) . Another important structural feature is the surface of the virion. Enveloped viruses are not stable outside of the human body, and are typically transmitted by transfer of body fluids. In contrast, nonenveloped viruses are much more stable, and many can be transmitted by other mechanisms such as the fecal-oral route-this is how polio and many other GI viruses are transmitted. Hepatitis, from contaminated shellfish for example, is caused by hepatitis A, a nonenveloped virus that is stable outside of the human body. In contrast, hepatitis B and C viruses have envelopes, and are transmitted by sexual contact or by blood.

The transmission process must deliver virus to a specific site that harbors cells susceptible to infection, such as the respiratory or gastrointestinal tracts. Following transmission, the virus typically establishes a primary, local infection. Sometimes, symptoms result from replication at the primary site of infection and virus produced at this site can be spread to other hosts. Other viruses disseminate within the host, being delivered to other tissues and organs that support virus replication. Dissemination can occur by different pathways-lymphatic spread, hematogenous spread, neural spread-and reflects an impressive degree of virus-host adaptation. Upon initiation of infection, the innate and adaptive immune systems are activated and attempt to clear the virus. However, viruses often employ immune evasion strategies, and the balance between immune responses and viral evasion strategies does much to dictate the outcome (see Chapters 4, 5, and 6, Innate, Adaptive, and Aberrant immunity). Respiratory tract. This is a common route of infection, with transmission mediated by aerosolized droplets or infected saliva and nasopharyngeal secretions. Droplet size, which is affected by temperature and humidity, plays a major role in determining the anatomic site to which the virus is delivered, with larger droplets lodging in the nose and upper airways and smaller droplets in the alveoli. Innate defenses include mucus and cilia, which trap pathogens and deliver them to the digestive tract, secretory IgA, and alveolar macrophages. Some viruses tend to infect the pharynx-hence pharyngitis; others may infect epithelial cells in bronchioles, causing bronchitis. The site of initial replication can be impacted by the virus inoculum, the site in the respiratory tract to which it is delivered, and the tropism of the virus for distinct cell types within the respiratory system. Avian influenza provides a good example: In humans, there is an anatomical difference in the distribution of sialic acid linkages in the respiratory tract. The \u03b1-2,3 linkage preferred by avian influenza is found only deeper in the human respiratory pathway, while the \u03b1-2,6 linkage used by human influenza viruses is found in the upper respiratory tract, helping to explain the relative protection of humans from \"bird flu.\"",

There are tight junctions in polarized epithelial cells, lipid rafts that serve to concentrate some cell surface proteins and exclude others, and projections such as microvilli. This means that virions not only have to bind to the surface of a host cell, but must either bind or migrate to the location on the cell surface that provides molecules or endocytic pathways needed for entry. Many viruses have evolved mechanisms that result in their directed movement on the surface of the plasma membrane (\"virus surfing\") until they reach a location that is compatible with entry (Lehmann et al., 2005) . A notable example of this process is provided by Group B coxsackie viruses, nonenveloped virions that must bind to the coxsackie-adenovirus receptor (CAR). However, coxsackie viruses infecting the apical surface of polarized epithelial cells are faced with a conundrum: CAR is strictly localized at tight junctions and is not accessible to virions that attach to the apical plasma membrane. How then can the virus and its receptor interact? On polarized epithelial cells, coxsackie virus first binds to decay-accelerating factor (DAF), a GPI-anchored protein that is relatively evenly distributed on the apical surface of the plasma membrane. Virus binding to DAF triggers the activation of Abl kinase that in turn initiates Rac-dependent actin rearrangements, which result in rapid movement of DAF, with the associated virus, to tight junctions, where it can then bind to its primary receptor and be internalized via caveolae (Coyne and Bergelson, 2006) .",

Occasionally, viruses that produce acute short-term high titer viremias, such as Ebola virus or parvovirus B19, may contaminate blood products. Although a number of viruses are shed in the urine, this is usually not an important source of transmission. One exception is certain animal viruses that are transmitted to humans; several arenaviruses are transmitted via aerosols of dried urine.

Transmission may involve less natural modes such as blood transfusions, organ transplants, or reused needles. In contrast to propagated infections are transmissions from a contaminated common source, such as food, water, or biologicals. Common source transmission is quite frequent and can produce explosive outbreaks that range in size depending on the number of recipients of the tainted vehicle and the level of virus contamination.

In general, RNA viruses replicate in the cytoplasm and DNA viruses in the nucleus, with a few notable exceptions, such as poxviruses and retroviruses. The virus uses viral or host enzymes to replicate its genome and for transcription and translation of viral proteins. In many instances, viruses shanghai normal cellular metabolism to support their replication and assembly. Shedding of newly synthesized virions is implemented by lysis of the infected cell to release encapsidated viruses or budding from the plasma membrane to release enveloped viruses.
