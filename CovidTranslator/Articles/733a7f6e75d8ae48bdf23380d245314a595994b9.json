Two fractions of this polysaccharide, CPP-1 and CPP-2, were first extracted by hot-water and purified. The average molecular weight of CPP-1 and CPP-2 were approximately 3.7 \u00c2 10 5 Da and 7.8 \u00c2 10 4 Da, and their chemical structures were studied by gas chromatography (GC), Fourier transform-infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, methylation analysis. We evaluated the effects of CPP-1 and CPP-2 on the basis of phagocytosis of macrophage assay, natural killer cells cytotoxicity assay and spleen lymphocyte proliferation assay. The results showed CPP-1 and CPP-2 significantly induced phagocytic rates and phagocytic indexes by peritoneal macrophages. Moreover, these two fractions caused a significant stimulation of rat spleen cell proliferation. At 50 lg/mL, CPP-2 activated NK cells more significantly than CPP-1. These findings suggest that they should be explored as a novel potential immunostimulants.",

Innate immune stimulation has been shown to be effective to keep away from emerging infectious diseases. In order to reduce damage to the human body, much effort has thus been made in the search for natural immunomodulation agents (Hackett, 2003) . Polysaccharides are known as biopolymers and shown to play key roles in therapeutic agents. Published data indicates that numerous polysaccharides isolated from plants, epiphytes and animals have been proven to be fewer side effects and possess a wide range of biological functions such as anti-tumor, immunomodulation and anti-oxidation properties (Amarowicz, Naczk, & Shahidi, 2000; Fujii, Maeda, Suzuki, & Ishida, 1978; Jimenez-Medina et al., 2008; Liu, Ooi, & Chang, 1997; Ooi & Liu, 2000; Yen & Chen, 1996) . Consequently, large numbers of Chinese herbal medicines and edible mushrooms are extensively studied and some of them have been applied in the clinical treatment. For example, the polysaccharides of Glycyrrhiza uralensis Fish (Cheng, Wan, Wang, Jin, & Xu, 2008) , Lentinus edodes, (Kosaka, Wani, Hattori, & Yamashita, 1982) and Lingzhi (Di, Chan, Leung, & Huie, 2003) .",

Bee pollen is the male gametophyte of gymnosperm and angiosperm. It contains all nutrients which are necessary for plant growth and development and also targets the entire human body, which is a special boost to the reproductive, immune, and nervous systems (Kroyer & Hegedus, 2001; Serra Bonvehi, Soliva Torrento, & Centelles Lorente, 2001; Uzbekova, Makarova, Khvoynitskaya, & Slepnev, 2003) . In the USA, bee pollen is defined by the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 as Dietary Supplement used to supplement the diet by increasing the total dietary intake. Since 20 years ago, interests on the pollen have been increasing and there are numerous studies on its nutrition contents and extracts. However, most of the researches are concentrated on the application for their development. There is little information about the bee pollen polysaccharide and biological functions. From this standpoint, we investigated a new bee pollen polysaccharide which is seldom mentioned in the previous papers.",

In this paper, we modified the previous method to isolate the carbohydrate compounds from the bee pollen of C. pinnatifida Bge., and found a novel water-soluble polysaccharide, which had scarcely been reported. We named it C. pinnatifida Bge. polysaccharide (CPP). Moreover, we adopted a synthesis method to break wall of bee pollen, including the mechanic way, the temperature difference way and the enzyme way. This paper mainly describes isolation and purification of the CPP; mean molecular weight survey of the CPP by HPGPC, structural characterizations of the CPP and also refers to some preliminary immune stimulating properties. Further studies on the CPP will be summarized in our next paper. The results suggest it may be a potential immunomodulation agent which can play a decisive role in innate immune defense against virus-infected and malignant cells by virtue of their ability to recognize and destroy abnormal cells.",

The residue was kept below 20\u00b0C again for 24 h, and then put it into boiling distilled water under stirring for 30 min, and cooled the water to 60\u00b0C. After mixing with 1% (m/m) pectinase the residue was extracted with distilled water (m/v = 1:10) for 3 h. After each 3-h period of water extraction and inactivating pectinase, the water extracts were collected and the residues were extracted again for three cycles. The combined extracts were pooled, concentrated in a rotary evaporator under reduced pressure at 50\u00b0C and filtered. Then the filtrate was precipitated by adding 95% ethanol (five times the volume of aqueous extract) at 4\u00b0C, followed by centrifugation at 5000 rpm for 20 min. The precipitate was dissolved in 400 mL of water and deproteinized with 10% (m/m) trypsin at 65\u00b0C, pH = 7, 3 h (Song, Meng, & Xu, 2007) . After inactivating trypsin, the resulting aqueous fraction was extensively dialyzed against tap water for 2 days and then distilled water for 2 days, then the crude polysaccharide fraction was obtained by precipitation in four fold volume of anhydrous ethanol and washed with acetone and ethyl ether three times to yield the crude polysaccharide (8.5 g) known as CPP in the subsequent description.",

The acid in excess was completely removed by distilled water. Then the hydrolyzed products were reduced with NaBH 4 (50 mg), followed by acidification with acetic acid. It was then co-distilled with methanol to remove the excess boric acid; the reduced sugars (alditols) were acetylated with 1:1 pyridine-acetic anhydride in water bath for 1 h at 90\u00b0C to give the alditol acetates. The alditol acetates of authentic standards (D-glucose, L-rhamnose, D-xylose, D-galactose, D-ribose, D-mannose, L-arabinose, L-fucose, Dglucuronic acid and L-galacturonic acid) with myo-inositol as the internal standards were prepared and subjected to GC analysis separately as mentioned above.

Wall-breaking treatments for this kind of bee pollen were carried out by synthesizing three ideal ways. It was demonstrated that wall-breaking rate was more significantly improved using this synthesis method as compare with using only one of them. The total yield of water-soluble polysaccharides was 8.5% by this isolation procedure, much higher than the yield of 1.5% from the pollen of Brassica napus L. (Yang, Guo, Zhang, & Wu, 2007) . This yield of 8.5% was also higher than the yield of 6.92% from pollen of timothy grass (Phleum pratense L.) extracted by 0.1 mol/L NH 4 HCO 3 (Brecker et al., 2005) . Therefore, the adopted conditions of the isolation procedure here were helpful to obtain water-soluble polysaccharides from the bee pollen of C. pinnatifida Bge. with an ideal yield before further optimizing. The CPP was separated and purified by gel filtration in DEAE-Sepharose CL-6B column. Two fractions of CPP-1 and CPP-2 were eluted as shown in Fig. 2 . CPP-1 and CPP-2 peaks appeared between 7-14 and 71-78 tubes, respectively. CPP-1 is white powder and CPP-2 is light yellow powder, soluble in hot water with characteristic absorption of polysaccharide at 190 nm, and no absorption at 280 and 260 nm for protein and nucleic acid.

Typical IR spectra for the two fractions are presented in Fig. 4 . At least triplicate spectra were recorded for each sample. There are two types of end carbonglucoside bonds: aand b-styles, which can be judged by IR. In IR spectra, the C-H bond in a-style has an absorption peak nearby 844 cm \u00c01 , while that of the C-H bond is in b-style nearby 891 cm \u00c01 (Barker, Bourne, Stacey, & Whiffen, 1954) . The FT-IR spectrum of CPP-1 and CPP-2 showed a strong band between 950 and 1160 cm \u00c01 attributed to the stretching vibrations of pyranose ring. A characteristic absorption at 895 cm \u00c01 was also observed, indicating the b-configuration of the sugar units. There was no absorption at 850 cm \u00c01 for the a-configuration. While in the anomeric region (905-876 cm \u00c01 ), both CPP-1 and CPP-2 exhibited the obvious characteristic absorption, suggesting the existence of b-D-glucopyranosyl (Barker et al., 1954) .",

Upon activation, NK cells begin to proliferate and secrete cytokines as a means of communication with other components of the immune system, in particular T cells. So we investigated the effect of NK cells cytotoxicity. As shown in Fig. 5 , CPP-2 had higher effect on NK cell for its cytotoxicity effect with the concentration of 50 lg/ mL (P < .01). Compared with the control group, significant enhancements in CPP-1 (50 lg/mL, P < .01) was observed. We can draw a conclusion that CPP-1 and CPP-2 at suitable dose can enhance effect of NK cells cytotoxicity. Generally, polysaccharide inducing NK cells activation increases with increasing concentration of polysaccharide. While interestingly, CPP-1 and CPP-2 inducing NK cell activation decreased with increasing concentration a Relative molar ratio, calculated from the ratio of peak areas. b Mol.% of the parent CPP-1 and CPP-2, calculated from the ratio of peak areas. when the concentration was greater than the optimal concentration. It was observed that the high concentrations of CPP-1 and CPP-2 resulted in the formation of over-saturated solution. The solution enhanced the absorption at 570 nm and decreased the NK cell activation finally. Meanwhile, NK-cell mediated cytotoxicity was modulated by various cytokines, including IL-1, IL-2, IL-12, and interferon (Chichen Michael Chien et al., 2004) , so further study of the effect of the high concentration of CPP-1 and CPP-2 on these cytokines is in order ongoing to immunotherapeutic strategies that will enhance the anti-tumor activity with NK cells.",

In fact, bee pollen was known as its health and medical functions, including anti-tumor function and immunostimulation (Hackett, 2003) . However, many investigations were achieved directly with bee pollen or bee pollen's extractions, but bee pollen's chemical components of immunostimulation remain not very clear. In this study, we have succeeded in isolating the polysaccharide CPP from bee pollen of C. pinnatifida Bge. Two water-soluble polysaccharide fractions, termed CPP-1 and CPP-2, were purified and the molecular weights were approximately 3.7 \u00c2 10 5 Da and 7.8 \u00c2 10 4 Da, respectively. FT-IR and quantitative carbohydrate composition analysis indicated that CPP-1 and CPP-2 were b-type heteropolysaccharides with pyran group, among which CPP-1 was composed of L-rhamnose, L-fucose, D-arabinose, D-xylose, Dmannose, D-galactose and D-glucose at the molar ratio of 0.67:0.44:10.16:0.66:1.03:5.51:9.94, respectively; CPP-2 consisted of L-rhamnose, D-arabinose, D-mannose, D-galactose, D-glucose, whose molar ratio was 2.12:9.82:3.60:0.89:5.56, respectively. Methylation results of polysaccharides shows that both of CPP-1 and CPP-2 were made of 1,5-linked D-arabinoside residues. CPP-1 was mainly composed of 1,5-L-Araf, T-, 1,6-, 1,3,6-, 1,4-, 1,4,6-D-Galp, T-, 1,3-D-Manp, T-, 1,4-D-Glcp; CPP-2 was primarily composed of 1,5-L-Araf, T-L-Rhap, T-, 1,3-D-Manp, T-, 1,4-D-Glcp. These provide the basic information on this new water-soluble polysaccharide for future their fine structure and determine the structure activity relationships (Deters, Lengsfeld, & Hensel, 2005) .",

The immune system is the human's ultimate defense against infectious diseases, tumor and cancer growth. A healthy immune system contains elements that are in balance with one another and if this balance is broken, our immune system will be unable to protect the body against harmful agents or processes. For above reasons, we investigated three aspects of immunomodulatory activity. Purified CPP-1 and CPP-2 showed higher activation on phagocytic rates and phagocytic indexes of macrophage, and the results indicated CPP-1 and CPP-2 were dose-dependent polysaccharides. Additionally, Tumor cell elimination is known to be mediated in part by the cytotoxic activity of natural killer (NK) cells. We therefore measured the enhanced cytotoxic activity of NK cells as compared with normal mice NK cells activity. Surprisingly, these two fractions were dose-independent and the optimal effect was found at 50 lg/mL (P < .01). And also the result of splenocyte proliferation was very ideal, especially for 50 lg/mL (P < .001). While discussing the biological activity of CPP, we find CPP-2 possessed higher immunomodulatory activity than CPP-1; and concluded that it is associated with compositions of the each monosaccharide. In the previous studies, many complex polysaccharides from plants, epiphytes and animals have been shown to influence the phagocytosis of macrophage, NK cells cytotoxicity and lymphocyte proliferation (Bao, Liu, Fang, & Li, 2001; Sun et al., 2008) , although the assays they used were different. We could not compare the activity of natural polysaccharides on phagocytosis of macrophage, NK cells cytotoxicity and lymphocyte proliferation due to the lack of standardized assays. 5 .
