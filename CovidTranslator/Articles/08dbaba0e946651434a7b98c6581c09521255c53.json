The poor prognosis of MCC patients and limited understanding of MCC pathogenesis warrants innovative treatments to control MCC. Several lines of evidence have pointed to Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV) as the etiological agent of MCC. In particular, the amino terminus of MCPyV large T antigen (LT) (aa1-258) is expressed in all MCPyV-positive tumors and plays an important role in MCC oncogenesis, rendering it an ideal therapeutic target for vaccination. In the current study, we developed a DNA vaccine encoding MCPyV LT aa1-258 (pcDNA3-LT). Within our pcDNA3-LT DNA vaccine, we identified that MCPyV LT aa136-160 likely contains an LT-specific CD4+ T helper epitope. We have also created an LT-expressing B16/LT tumor model using B16, a murine melanoma cell line, to characterize the potency of our DNA vaccine. Using this tumorigenic B16/LT tumor model, we found that pcDNA3-LT DNA vaccine generates antitumor effects mainly mediated by CD4+ T cells against B16/LT tumors in vaccinated C57BL/6 mice. Thus, immunotherapy using pcDNA3-LT DNA vaccine may represent a promising approach for the control of MCPyV-associated lesions. The B16/LT tumor model further serves as a useful model for testing various vaccine strategies against MCC.",

            "text": "Recently, a new human polyomavirus termed Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV) was discovered to be associated with MCC [4] . The carcinogenicity of MCPyV is supported by several lines of evidence. It is well established that polyomaviruses can transform cells and induce tumors in experimental animal models. MCPyV has been detected in 80% of MCC tumors worldwide. In these tumors, the virus is present as a chromosomally integrated copy, a characteristic of some viruses that cause cancers in humans. The MCPyV integration is clonal and the site is unique for each patient, indicating that the virus was present in the cell before or during oncogenic transformation. Compared to MCPyV in normal tissue, MCPyV genomes in tumor tissue harbor stop codon mutations in the large T antigen (LT) open reading frame that are predicted to ablate viral replication capacity [5] . Specifically, the truncated LT protein loses the C terminal helicase domain required for viral DNA replication while the RB-interacting domain is retained. A lack of viral replication is characteristic of some oncogenic viruses, as viral replication would cause death of the host cell. A necessary role for large T antigen expression in maintenance of the proliferative capacity and survival of MCPyV-positive MCC cell lines harboring truncated forms of the large T antigen was recently demonstrated [6] . Thus, sufficient evidence has accumulated to provisionally consider MCPyV as the etiological agent of MCC and to explore therapies that target the virus.",

A unique feature of LT in MCC is that the protein is always truncated by the introduction of stop codons. Of the mutations that have been described, the stop codons are predicted to truncate the protein at or beyond amino acid 258. Thus, the amino terminus of MCPyV LT (aa1-258) represents an ideal therapeutic target, as it is likely to be present and expressed in all MCPyV-positive MCC tumors and it plays an important role in MCC oncogenesis. In addition, MCPyV LT is a foreign antigen and therefore faces no issue of immune tolerance. Based on this potentially ideal vaccine target, we sought to develop a vaccine for the control of MCC.",

It has been recently demonstrated that CD8 T cell infiltration of MCC tumors correlates with better prognosis, supporting the idea that T cells may play a role in the clearance of MCC. Thus, we created a DNA vaccine to generate potent antigen-specific CD8+ T cell immunity for the control of MCC. In the current study, we generate a DNA vaccine encoding MCPyV LT aa1-258 (pcDNA3-LT). We found that within our pcDNA3-LT DNA vaccine, MCPyV LT aa136-160 likely contains a LT-specific CD4+ T helper epitope. To characterize the potency of our DNA vaccine, we created a MCC tumor model in which B16 melanoma tumor cell line was transduced with a lentivirus vector expressing MCC LT amino acids 1-258 to generate a novel LT-expressing tumorigenic cell line, B16/LT. Since melanomas, like Merkel cell carcinoma, are of cutaneous origin, the B16 melanoma cell line is suitable for the development of a MCPyV LT-expressing murine tumor model. Using this tumorigenic B16/LT tumor model, we found that pcDNA3-LT DNA vaccine generates protective and therapeutic antitumor effects, mainly mediated by CD4+ T cells, against LT-expressing B16/LT tumors in mice. Our study shows that a DNA vaccine encoding MCPyV LT has the potential for future clinical applications in the control of MCC.",

Successful transduction of the lentivirus would lead to the expression of GFP and allow isolation of the transduced tumor cells. As shown in Fig. 1A , the LT retrovirus-transduced B16 tumor cells demonstrated greater GFP expression compared to non-transduced B16 tumor cells. The GFP-positive cells were further isolated by preparative flow cytometry by GFP signal for the characterization of the expression of LT antigen. In order to generate antibody against LT antigen, we constructed a pcDNA3 vaccine encoding MCPyV LT aa1-258 (pcDNA3-LT). Mice were vaccinated with pcDNA3-LT intramuscularly followed by electroporation three times at a 1-week interval and boosted using the same dose and regimen 2 months later, as outlined in Fig. 2A . One week after the last vaccination, sera from vaccinated mice were collected for Western Blot analysis. As shown in Fig. 1B , left panel, cell lysate from B16/LT cells demonstrated a specific band consistent in size with LT antigen. In comparison, the band is absent in cell lysate from B16 melanoma cells. To confirm that loading of cell lysate was comparable between samples, we used antibody specific for beta actin as a loading control (Fig. 1B, right panel) . Thus, our data show that we have successfully created a murine LT-expressing B16 tumor cell line.",

We have also identified a LT-specific CD4+ T helper epitope at MCPyV aa131-160. Furthermore, we created a preclinical murine MCC tumor model suitable for testing our DNA vaccine. Further characterization of our DNA vaccine demonstrated that the vaccine was capable of generating potent protective and therapeutic antitumor effects. We further determined that CD4+ T cells are the primary mediators for the observed antitumor effects in vaccinated mice.",

To the best of our knowledge, there is currently no reported preclinical MCC tumor model for the testing of cancer immunotherapy. At present there is also no reported vaccine to treat MCPyV-induced MCC tumors in either preclinical or clinical settings. Thus, the B16/LT model serves as a potentially important tumor model for the testing of different vaccination strategies, including other forms of vaccines such as peptide-based, proteinbased, dendritic cell-based, and vector-based vaccines targeting MCPyV.",

It has been shown that CD4+ T cell immune responses can generate antitumor effects in cutaneous tumor models [14, 15] . Furthermore, it was shown that na\u00efve tumor-specific CD4+ T cells can differentiate into cytotoxic T cells in lymphopenic mice, as marked by expression of cytotoxic T cellassociated genes perforin, granzyme B, and LAMP-1 (CD107a), all of which are involved in degranulating cytotoxic T cells [15] . In this model, the activated na\u00efve tumor-specific CD4+ T cells were independent of NK cells and were important for tumor clearance [15] . Thus, it will be important to further explore the role of tumor-specific CD4+ T cells in mediating antitumor immunity through direct cytotoxicity.",

While in the current study we show that the antitumor effects of our pcDNA3-LT DNA vaccine is primarily mediated by CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells and NK cells also contributed to the efficacy of the vaccine in our tumor model (Fig. 7) . Although the DNA vaccine in the current study does not generate appreciable LT-specific CD8+ T cell immune responses, different vaccination strategies may potentially lead to the enhancement of LT-specific CD8+ T cells. For example, we have previously found that DNA vaccine encoding calreticulin (CRT) [12, 13, [16] [17] [18] or heat shock protein 70 [19, 20] linked to HPV-16 E7 can lead to the enhancement of HPV-16 E7-specific CD8+ T cell immune responses. It will be important in future investigations to determine whether these strategies can induce LT-specific CD8+ T cell immune responses.",

We have previously generated a panel of therapeutic DNA vaccines employing various intracellular targeting strategies that can route model target antigen to desired subcellular compartments in order to enhance MHC class I and/or MHC class II antigen processing and presentation pathway(s) to enhance both antigen-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell immune responses. Strategies to enhance CD4+ T cell immune responses include the linkage of target antigen to the sorting signal of lysosome-associated membrane protein (LAMP-1) [21] to improve MHC class II antigen presentation to CD4+ T cells. Strategies to enhance CD8+ T cell immune responses include the linkage of target antigen to Mycobacterium tuberculosis heat-shock protein 70 (HSP70) [19] , calreticulin (CRT) [16] , gamma-tubulin [22] , or the translocation domain (dII) of Pseudomonas aeruginosa exotoxin A (ETA) [23] to enhance MHC class I antigen presentation to CD8+ T cells. These DNA vaccination strategies have been proven to be effective in other antigenic systems (for review, see [8] ). It will be of interest to further explore whether such DNA vaccination strategy can be applied to LT antigen to further enhance LT-specific CD4+ and/or CD8+ T cell responses as well as therapeutic antitumor effects for future clinical translation.",
