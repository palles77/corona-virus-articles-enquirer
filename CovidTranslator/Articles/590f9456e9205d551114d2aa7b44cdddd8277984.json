            "text": "A sensitive and specific method for measuring the vaccine titer of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is important to commercial manufacturers for improving vaccine quality. Typically, IBV is titrated in embryonated chicken eggs, and the infectivity of the virus dilutions is determined by assessing clinical signs in the embryos as evidence of viral propagation. In this study, we used a dot-immunoblotting assay (DIA) to measure the titers of IBV vaccines that originated from different pathogenic strains or attenuation methods in embryonated eggs, and we compared this assay to the currently used method, clinical sign evaluation. To compare the two methods, we used real-time reverse transcription-PCR, which had the lowest limit of detection for propagated IBV. As a clinical sign of infection, dwarfism of the embryo was quantified using the embryo: egg (EE) index. The DIA showed 9.41% higher sensitivity and 15.5% higher specificity than the clinical sign determination method. The DIA was particularly useful for measuring the titer of IBV vaccine that did not cause apparent stunting but propagated in embryonated chicken eggs such as a heat-adapted vaccine strain. The results of this study indicate that the DIA is a rapid, sensitive, reliable method for determining IBV vaccine titer in embryonated eggs at a relatively low cost.",

The virus causes severe economic losses to the poultry industry worldwide because it can affect the upper respiratory and reproductive tracts, and some strains can cause nephritis in chickens (Jackwood, 2012) . Despite intensive vaccination using both live attenuated and killed vaccines to prevent the disease, the emergence of new variant strains that do not serologically cross-react has complicated disease control and demonstrates the importance of vaccinating chickens with the disease-causing IBV types (Cavanagh, 2005 (Cavanagh, , 2007 .",

To prevent the economic losses caused by IBV, live attenuated vaccines and inactivated oil-emulsion vaccines containing both the KM91 and Massachusetts 41 (M41) strains are widely used in Korea. More recently, vaccine strains providing broad cross-protection have been developed, including the K2 and K40/09 strains (Kim et al., 2013; Lim et al., 2012 Lim et al., , 2015 . In Korea, the viral content of a vaccine preparation is quantified by IBV titration according to standard procedure approved by the Animal and Plant Quarantine Agency. For this procedure, the chicken embryos are inoculated with serial dilutions of the virus preparation, and then the embryos are examined for the presence of specific lesions caused by the virus, i.e., dwarfing, curling, and stunting (Doherty, 1967) . However, as a variety of live-attenuated vaccines have been developed for variant field strains, it is unclear whether the clinical sign determination method reflects viral propagation in IBV-infected embryos. Furthermore, as there are no specific standards for measuring clinical signs, the measurements of specific lesions can differ among observers.",

To confirm the detection limit of the DIA, each vaccine strain was serially diluted 2-fold in phosphatebuffered saline (PBS; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and analyzed by DIA and real-time reverse transcription (RT)-PCR. Concurrently, triplicate 10-fold serially diluted samples were used to determine the detection limit of real-time RT-PCR. To measure vaccine titer based on the infectivity of chicken embryos, 10-fold serial dilutions of a 10 0 virus solution (10 \u22121 -10 \u22129 ) were generated by mixing 1 mL of the virus with 9 mL of PBS containing 50 g/mL gentamicin sulfate (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO); all dilutions were kept on ice. Next, 0.1 mL of the 10 \u22124 through 10 \u22129 dilutions were inoculated into five 10-day-old SPF ECE (Hy-Vac), and the eggs were incubated at 37 \u2022 C. No eggs had to be discarded due to non-specific death of embryos within one day of inoculation. After three days of incubation, 500 L of allantoic fluid was extracted from the inoculated eggs using a 1 mL syringe and was used to detect propagated IBV by the DIA and real-time RT-PCR. Eggs were then resealed with paraffin for further incubation. Seven days after inoculation, the embryo:egg (EE) index was calculated for all eggs. Propagation of the inoculated virus was determined using real-time RT-PCR, DIA, and the EE index method, and the 50% egg infectious dose (EID 50 ) of the five vaccines was calculated based on the method of Reed and Muench (1938) .",

The highest dilution that showed dark-brown dots in the DIA was 2 \u22127 for K2p170 and K40/09 and 2 \u22126 for M41, KM91, and K40/09HP40. The 10-fold diluted viruses were also examined by real-time RT-PCR (Supplementary material Fig. 2 ). For the tested pathogenic or attenuated IBVs, there were no detectable Ct values at the 10 \u22127 dilution. Therefore, the detection limit of the real-time RT-PCR assay was set to the Ct value of the 10 \u22126 dilution. The real-time RT-PCR method was found to be approximately 2 15 -fold more sensitive than the DIA method. Thus, real-time RT-PCR is suitable for detecting propagated viruses and can be used to compare the DIA and EE ratio detection methods for propagated IBV during titration. Because the DIA does not distinguish between infectious and noninfectious virus, we had to confirm that the assay does not detect inoculated virus in the eggs. As shown by the detection limit of the DIA, we observed that the input virus was not detected at dilutions higher than 2 \u22126 -2 \u22127 . Thus, none of the dilutions used in the titering (10 \u22124 -10 \u22129 ) would give a positive result without viral replication, especially after further dilution in the allantoic fluid. After 7 days of incubation, the mean EE ratio and standard deviation of mock-inoculated eggs was 0.375 \u00b1 0.036. To detect dwarfism, the EE index was defined as the EE ratio of IBV-inoculated ECE divided by the mean EE ratio of mock-inoculated ECE. Embryos with EE indices below the lowest individual EE index for mock-inoculated ECE (0.880) were classified as positive for dwarfism.

Of the 79 true-positive samples, two samples in K40/09 and K40/09HP40 were false-negatives by DIA, which was also observed using the clinical signs method. The results of the EE index, which was defined by the cut-off value of the lowest EE index of the mockinoculated ECE (0.880), showed propagated IBV in 65 (87.84%) of 74 positive samples, with relatively low specificity (84.50%) and an AUC index of 86.2%. The \u00c4 value for this test was 0.724, indicating moderate agreement with the real-time RT-PCR results. Of the nine false-negative results obtained using the clinical sign method, two samples were M41, four samples were KM91, two samples were K2p170, and one sample was K40/09. Of the 11 false-positive results obtained using the clinical sign method, three samples were M41, two samples were KM91, one sample was K2p170, and five samples were K40/09HP40. For the EE index results, which were obtained using the cut-off value of the lowest individual EE index of the mock-inoculated ECEs, we compared the cut-off value to the optimum value calculated based on the EE index distribution. The optimum cut-off (0.890) calculated based on the EE indices distribution suggested that the cut-off value of the lowest individual EE index of the mock-inoculated ECEs (0.880) was reliable and could be used to classify clinical signs by weight. Using this new cut-off, only one false-negative sample was corrected to a positive result, and the assay showed 89.19% sensitivity and 85.92% specificity (Fig. 1) . We compared the clinical signs and DIA results to the real-time RT-PCR results and found that the DIA results were highly consistent with the real-time RT-PCR results. Among the 150 eggs inoculated with serially diluted IBV samples, only two samples showed false-negative results. However, 20 results obtained using the clinical signs method did not match the real-time RT-PCR results. For the M41 respiratory strain, the titer calculated by the clinical signs method were lower than the titer calculated by real-time RT-PCR. The nephropathogenic strain KM91 and its attenuated form K2p170 showed higher titer when measured by the clinical signs method. Compared to KM91, K2p170 showed clearer signs of stunting. This demonstration that egg-adapted strains induce clearer embryo dwarfism than wild strains is in agreement with those of Dhinakar Raj et al. (2004) . However, the recombinant nephrogenic strain K40/09 and its attenuated counterpart K40/09HP40, which was egg-passaged with heat adaptation, showed opposite results. The overall EE indices were higher for K40/09HP40 than for K40/09. Moreover, the K40/09HP40 titer measured by the clinical signs method was approximately 10-fold lower than the titer measured by real-time RT-PCR. These results suggest that the clinical signs induced by this heat-adapted virus might not be sufficient to produce dwarfism in ECEs.",

            "text": "The extensive genetic diversity and high mutation rate of IBV generate many different virus types that the existing IBV vaccine strains do not protect against. Thus, there is great demand for a multiple serotype IBV vaccine that provides broad protection. In addition, several research groups have attempted to develop a multivalent vaccine against not only multiple IBV serotypes but also other avian infectious diseases such as Newcastle disease, avian influenza, and infectious laryngotracheitis, as well as nonrespiratory diseases such as Marek's disease and fowl pox (Ndegwa et al., 2015; Sharma et al., 2002; Vagnozzi et al., 2010; Winterfield, 1968) . For such multivalent vaccines, which must be mixed accurately to induce a protective immune response, it is thought that the higher or lower titers observed by the clinical sign method (e.g., for the nephropathogenic strain or heat-adapted strains) could prompt manufacturers to add less or more antigen than required, respectively. This is especially important for live vaccines, because the virus first infects the host and then induces an immune response via innate and acquired immunity, the virus quantitation must represent the true propagating ability within the host.",

Generally, the disease-induced lesions are clinical signs, including stunting, curling, and clubbed down. In the US, the method for titrating IBV vaccines also states that on the seventh day after virus inoculation, all eggs should be examined for IBV lesions (USDA, 2014) . In this method, specific lesions, such as bile stasis and kidney urates, are listed as general clinical signs. However, assessing specific lesions is laborious and time consuming. Moreover, well-trained observers who can recognize the clinical signs and can skillfully approach without damaging them are required. In this study, we choose stunting as a typical clinical sign because it is the most objective and quantifiable clinical sign, and it can be easily distinguished without observer error.",

However, the fluorescence thermal cycler requires continuous maintenance and trained operators who can perform the experiments without introducing cross-contamination between samples, which is very costly. Accurate measurement of vaccine titer could help manufacturers increase vaccine production or prevent vaccine failure resulting from antigen content that is insufficient to induce an immune response. The DIA method could be used to measure the titer of IBV vaccines that do not elicit clear stunting signs but propagate in ECEs, such as the heat-adapted vaccine strain. In addition, this method is faster than clinical signs method, and could reduce inter-observer differences. The results indicate that the DIA presented in this study is a relatively low cost, timesaving, sensitive, and reliable method for detecting IBV during IBV vaccine titration in embryonated eggs.",
