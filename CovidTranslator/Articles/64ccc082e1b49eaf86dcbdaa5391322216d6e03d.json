Whether the N protein in severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is antigenic remains to be elucidated. Using Western blot and Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA), the recombinant N proteins and the synthesized peptides derived from the N protein were screened in sera from SARS patients. All patient sera in this study displayed strong positive immunoreactivities against the recombinant N proteins, whereas normal sera gave negative immunoresponses to these proteins, indicating that the N protein of SARS-CoV is an antigenic protein. Furthermore, the epitope sites in the N protein were determined by competition experiments, in which the recombinant proteins or the synthesized peptides competed against the SARS-CoV proteins to bind to the antibodies raised in SARS sera. One epitope site located at the C-terminus was confirmed as the most antigenic region in this protein. A detailed screening of peptide with ELISA demonstrated that the amino sequence from Codons 371 to 407 was the epitope site at the C-terminus of the N protein. Understanding of the epitope sites could be very significant for developing an effective diagnostic approach to SARS.",

            "text": "Of all the coronaviral structural proteins, the N protein is the most abundant throughout infection, both in mRNA and protein levels (7 ) . Compared to the mRNA levels of other structural genes, the mRNA of the N protein is expressed three to ten times higher at 12-hour post-infection (8 ) . The N protein has a high composition of polar amino acid residues. Most of them display hydrophilicity and immunogenicity, as, for example, the murine coronavirus (MCV; ref. 9 ), the turkey coronavirus (TCV; ref. 10 ) , and the infectious bronchitis virus (IBV; ref. 11 ). In contrast to other SARS-CoV structural proteins that contain multiple sites for glycosylation during infection, which may cause different immunoresponses, the N protein is free of glycosylation sites and does not change its immunological characteristics even expressed in a prokaryote system (12 ) . Importantly, the SARS-CoV N protein is highly conserved with an almost complete identity among various strains that have been sequenced so far (5 ) . These features make the N proteins useful for group-specific serologic assays. For example, the N gene in IBV was expressed in bacteria with a histidine tag at the N-terminus, and the expressed IBV N protein was then used as antigen for developing an assay to detect IBV-specific antibody. Collisson et al. found that this antigen could be successfully applied to diagnose IBV viruses in different chicken strains (13 ) . Utilizing the baculovirus expression system, the TCV N protein was expressed and applied to specific serologic tests for detecting TCV antibodies in turkeys (14 ) . A high degree of concordance was observed between the ELISA and the indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA) test with 96% of specificity (14 ) . Therefore, studying the immunogenic properties of the N protein may form the basis for developing immunodetection assays of SARS, and also for formulating strategies of future vaccine development against this disease.",

Since all primers contain additional BamH I site at 5 end and Not I at 3 end, both restriction enzymes were used to completely digest these PCR products and pET30a vector. The digested and harvested N gene fragments were ligated with the linearized pET30a to form the expression vectors, pET30-N-full, pET30-\u2206N256 and pET30-\u2206N124. In Figure 1 , the digestion of these vectors with BamH I and Not I generated three DNA fragments with different molecular weights, which were identical to the PCR products, indicating that these N gene fragments were inserted into pET30a correctly. Finally all insertions were confirmed by DNA sequencing (data not shown). ",

According to the hydrophobic analysis, the N protein contains several hydrophilic regions spanning the whole N protein (Figure 2) . Thus, these recombinant proteins were ex-pected to be highly soluble. On the contrary, all the three recombinant proteins expressed in BL-21 mainly formed inclusion body and released limited soluble forms in cytoplasm. The recombinants could not be purified directly from soluble fractions. To obtain a high protein yield, the bacterial pellets were treated with 8 M urea followed by a strong probe sonication. The denatured proteins retained the affinity to Ni 2+ , and hence Ni-NTA column was effectively applied into the purification of these recombinants.

            "text": "To check the immunoreactions of the recombinant N proteins, all were examined by Western blot using the sera from SARS patients. Figure 4B depicts that all three N recombinants have strong immunoresponses to the SARS sera. Impressively, the size of the Nfull protein is almost identical to this immuno-positive band found from Vero-E6 lysate. Thus, the evidence supports the conclusion that the N protein expressed from Vero-E6 cells that had been infected by SARS-CoV is an antigenic protein. Another potentially important phenomenon is that the immunoreactive intensities of three recombinant proteins are quite simi-lar. The N-full protein contains the whole amino acid sequence of the N protein. However, the other two recombinants, \u2206N256 and \u2206N124, are truncated N proteins. The \u2206N256 protein only has 166 amino acids at the C-terminus of the N protein, whereas the \u2206N124 protein is lack of 124 amino acids at the N-terminus of the N protein but contains 298 amino acids at Cterminus. Hence, all of the N recombinants share the same C-terminus and are distinguished from each other by the lengths of their N-terminus. Since similar immunoreactivities were observed in the three N recombinants, they may share similar epitope site(s), possibly within 166 amino acids at the C-terminus that are shared by the three recombinants. The N proteins, with the truncated N-terminus \u2206N256 and \u2206N124, did not seem to lose their immunoresponses to SARS sera, indicating that the antigenicity of Nterminus of the N protein might be much weaker than that of the C-terminus. This hypothesis was supported by ELISA experiments. A number of SARS sera were tested by ELISA to examine the immunoreactivities of these N recombinants, and all the three N proteins displayed similar positive ELISA reactivities (data not shown). Immunoassays for the infected Vero-E6 cell lysate and the recombinant N proteins by Western blot. A. Western blot analysis of the Vero-E6 lysate infected by SARS-CoV using SARS sera as primary antibody: 1. protein ladder; 2. Vero-E6 cells infected by SARS-CoV (the N protein band is obvious); 3. Vero-E6 cells uninfected by SARS-CoV. B. Western blot analysis of the N recombinants using SARS sera as primary antibody: 1. protein ladder; 2, 3, 4, the recombinant N proteins, \u2206N256, \u2206N124 and N-full, respectively, stained by Coomassie blue; 5, 6, 7, the recombinant N proteins, \u2206N256, \u2206N124 and N-full, respectively, immunostained in Western blot using SARS serum as primary antibody.",

On the basis of hydropathy plot, nine peptides located in this region were selected and synthesized. These synthesized peptides were screened in SARS sera (31 cases) with ELISA. The lysate of infected Vero-E6 cells was used as positive control for ELISA reactivity. A peptide showing comparable ELISA reactivity with this control would be considered as an immunoreactive N fragment. Table 1 summarizes the ELISA data from the screening of the nine peptides, in which p values are very important, indicating whether there is a significant difference in ELISA reactivities between a synthesized peptide and SARS-CoV as the antigen. Two peptides, N371 and N385, have comparable immunoreactivities with the Vero-E6 lysate, with 97% and 94% positive detection rates, respectively. Thus the epitope site at the C-terminus of the N protein is likely to be located at Codons 371-407. The significance of the differences (p) in ELISA reactivities to SARS-CoV and the different synthesized peptides was analyzed by the Student's t-test.",

Peptide N371 is the most comparable antigen among the nine synthesized peptides. Hence, it is deduced to be a good competitor against SARS-CoV virus for antibody binding, if it does exist at the epitope site. Prior to ELISA determinations, peptide N371 was incubated with or without SARS serum for 30 min, respectively, and was then added to a microtiter plate coated with the ex-tracted proteins from SARS-CoV. As predicted, the ELISA reactivities were attenuated with the increase of peptide concentrations in the SARS sera ( Figure  5A ). Furthermore, the competition experiments were conducted in Western blot. The PVDF (Polyvinylidene Fluoride) membrane transblotted with three recombinant N proteins were incubated with the SARS serum containing the peptide, N371. Compared with the immunoresponses showed in Figure 3B , the crossreactions between the recombinants and SARS antibodies were significantly curtailed, indicating that this peptide inhibited the recognition between SARS-CoV and its antibodies ( Figure 5B ). This peptide, therefore, is confirmed to be an epitope site that exists in SARS-CoV as well as in the three recombinant proteins. ",

However, they commonly have an epitopic site at the Cterminus. For instance, the epitope sites for TGEV (transmissible gastroenteritis virus), MHV (mouse hepatitis virus), and IBV are located around Codons 360-382 (17 ), 381-405 (18 ) , and 360-409 at C-termini (19 ) , respectively. Similar to other coronaviruses, the present study has confirmed that an antigenic site is located at the C-terminus of SARS-CoV. In Figure 2 , there is a hydropathy plot for the SARS-CoV N protein. A lot of regions in this protein have low hydrophobicity scores (<0), and the C-terminus is specifically strong in hydrophilicity. Two major forces, charge-charge interactions and hydrogen bonds caused by hydrophilicity, have been hypothesized to be crucial for the formation of epitope site. Peptides N371 and N385 are both located at the hydrophilic region of C-terminus and contain a high content of polar amino acids (\u223c 38%). Further more, their biophysical parameters correlated well with the values of ELISA reactivity as well as the intensity of Western blot when the two peptides were used as antigens.",

The major function of the N protein in coronaviruses is to stabilize genomic RNA by forming a helical ribonucleocapsid (RNP), which is located at the viral core, and is highly stable under conditions of high ionic strength and highly resistant to the actions of RNase (20 ) . Because of its location in the virus, the N protein is rarely glycosylated in an infected cell. Hence, its recombinant proteins should be soluble during expression in the bacterial system. On the contrary, all the three recombinant N proteins did not express in soluble forms but mainly generated the inclusion bodies. Although a number of approches were taken to improve the solubility of these recombinants, such as altering expression temperature or decreasing inducer concentrations, the formations of inclusions were found in BL-21 strains consistently. Some misfolding mechanisms are believed to be behind the phenomenon. Moreover, this phenomenon may explain the role of the N protein in the virus because the N protein and viral genomic RNA interact reciprocally to stabilize each other. In the bacterial expression system, the precipitation of the N protein could result from the absence of the RNA molecules.",

In some urgent situations, a common way in serological assay is to use viral lysates as antigens. Nevertheless, the use of viral lysates brings some drawbacks. For instance, people preparing SARS-CoV lysates are at risk of infection. Instead of viral lysate, recombinant proteins can be used to avoid such problems. However, to generate a proper antigen specific to SARS-CoV is a tough challenge. A major problem is how to discover high antigenic fragments in viral proteins. In this study, a specific epitope site has been identified. Significantly, these recombinant proteins and synthesized peptides (N371 and N385) were confirmed to have strong immunoresponse to the patient sera determined by either ELISA or Western blot. Screening with a total of 31 SARS patient and 24 normal samples, these antigens, either from recombinants or from peptides, have shown a potential application in clinical diagnosis, with under 2% negative detection rate and over 95% positive detection rate.
