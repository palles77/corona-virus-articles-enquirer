The \"tent\" is an assembly of a clear transparent plastic bag mounted on a plastic frame. The anesthesiologist can use the gloves on the cephalic side of the tent while an extra glove on the caudal side can be used by the assistant to provide cricoid pressure and pass instruments. An airtight seal around the glove is produced by screwing two plastic rings over the plastic sheet with the glove first mounted on the inner ring. The inner and outer rings are cut from the top and the lid of a plastic container respectively. A rubber seal, fashioned from a feeding bottle tit and fixed by an adhesive dressing at the top of the tent, provides a conduit for bronchoscopy. The plastic frame and rings can be disinfected with sodium hypochlorite solution. Other parts are disposable. The AIR Tent is inexpensive to construct (plastic frame: US$ 15; gloves + plastic bag: US$ 1.5) and is easy to put together (setting-up time < 5 minutes). We believe the AIR Tent is suitable for use in operating rooms and other parts of the hospital where resuscitation takes place. ",

            "text": "To the Editor: Vicente et al. recommend hospital-operating procedures to minimize programming errors associated with patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) and to enhance their detection before patients are harmed. 1 Most of the preventable incidents in anesthesia, however, involve human error. 2 Anesthesiologists are frequently exposed to stress, operating under difficult and sometimes critical conditions including emergency situations. 3, 4 This requests a high ability to work under pressure. Stress is well known to occupy thought processes and decrease alertness. Drugs and alcohol (and hangover) can impair judgment, even in minor doses. Physical and mental strain, lack of sleep and immobility may cause lasting degradation of performance. Even minor illness can affect alertness. In addition, coordination and vision may be impaired by medication. Fatigue favours the acceptance of unwarranted risks. Emotional upset, including anger, depression, and anxiety decreases alertness, alters critical self-assessment and enhances riskbehaviour. Personal fitness and good health are important factors that influence situational awareness and performance. As generally in anesthesiology distraction means danger to the patient, all personnel involved in the use/programming of PCA pumps are strongly advised to avoid the following four situations: To the Editor: The recent case report by Vicente et al. 1 concerning a patient-controlled analgesia (PCA)-related opiate overdose demonstrates some of the potential safety hazards of complex medical technology. It is sometimes helpful to consider the various means by which hazards involving such technologies may occur. In this context, I would like to offer the following taxonomy of PCA safety hazards. I hope this classification will be useful to both designers and users of PCA systems.",

To the Editor: I read with interest this case report of the tragic death of a young woman while receiving patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) post-Cesarean delivery. 1 The authors conclude their report with several recommendations. These are all very sensible. The most important recommendation, not mentioned however, concerns the initial nursing assessment of a loudly snoring and unarousable patient while receiving PCA on the ward. This obviously can be an urgent and life-threatening situation which must be dealt with expeditiously. Typically a nursing protocol exists which provides for an immediate and effective response. Did this not exist, or, if so, was it not followed? A different and more favourable outcome might have resulted. An astute and appropriately trained nurse is the last line of defense for a wide range of untoward and potentially critical situations, such as could arise from a PCA programming error. This, in my opinion, is the paramount message in this tragic case, and not the programming error itself. To the Editor: Patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) programming error is an important patient safety issue as highlighted by Vicente et al. 1 Drug overdose and death resulted when morphine 1 mg\u00b7mL -1 was set instead of the actual 5 mg\u00b7mL -1 . I appreciate Dr. Vicente's reminder and sound recommendations but find the viewpoints somewhat misleading. The article seems to suggest that the Abbott Lifecare 4100 Plus II Infusion Pump is uniquely dangerous because there might be \"relatively numerous mortalities \u2026 from user programming errors with this device\". 1 ",

Rather than wishing these factors will simply go away, we should design devices and systems so that providers can function more robustly -even under less than ideal conditions. Dr. Doyle outlines an excellent taxonomy of patientcontrolled analgesia (PCA) hazards to assist manufacturers and investigators improve patient safety.
