            "text": "Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) isolates that have been adapted to passage in cell culture maintain their infectivity in vitro but may lose their pathogenicity in vivo. To better understand the genomic mechanisms for viral attenuation, we sequenced the complete genomes of two virulent TGEV strains and their attenuated counterparts: virulent TGEV Miller M6 and attenuated TGEV Miller M60 and virulent TGEV Purdue and attenuated TGEV Purdue P115, together with the ISU-1 strain of porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV-ISU-1), a naturally occurring TGEV deletion mutant with an altered respiratory tropism and reduced virulence. Pairwise comparison at both the nucleotide (nt) and amino acid (aa) levels between virulent and attenuated TGEV strains identified a common change in nt 1753 of the spike gene, resulting in a serine to alanine mutation at aa position 585 of the spike proteins of the attenuated TGEV strains. Alanine was also present in this protein in PRCV-ISU-1. Particularly noteworthy, the serine to alanine mutation resides in the region of the major antigenic site A/B (aa 506-706) that elicits neutralizing antibodies and within the domain mediating the cell surface receptor aminopeptidase N binding (aa 522-744). Comparison of the predicted polypeptide products of ORF3b showed significant deletions in the naturally attenuated PRCV-ISU-1 and TGEV Miller M60; these deletions occurred at a common break point, suggesting a related mechanism of recombination that may affect viral virulence or tropism. Sequence comparisons at both genomic and protein levels indicated that PRCV-ISU-1 had a closer relationship with TGEV Miller strains than Purdue strains. Phylogenetic analyses showed that virulence is an evolutionarily labile trait in TGEV and that TGEV strains as a group share a common ancestor with PRCV.",

            "text": "Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) is a group 1 coronavirus. It was identified as an etiological agent of transmissible gastroenteritis in swine in 1946 in the United States (Doyle, 1951; Doyle and Hutchings, 1946) and in the following two decades after its discovery, it was reported in England, Belgium, Japan, China, Australia and Africa (Kemeny and Woods, 1977; Pritchard, 1987; Wood et al., 1981; Woods, 1976; Woods and Wesley, 1986) . Transmissible gastroenteritis virus replicates in the cytoplasm of villous epithelial cells in the small intestine, leading to severe villous atrophy and malabsorptive diarrhea, resulting in almost 100% mortality in seronegative suckling pigs (Saif and Sestak, 2006) . The virus is an enteropathogen, although TGEValso replicates in the upper Virology 358 (2007) 424 -435 www.elsevier.com/locate/yviro respiratory tract (Underdahl et al., 1975) with transient nasal shedding in experimentally inoculated pigs (VanCott et al., 1993) . Transmissible gastroenteritis virus has a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA genome of \u223c28.5 kb in size. The genomic sequence contains 9 open-reading frames (ORFs) that encode 4 structural proteins [spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleoprotein (N)] and 5 nonstructural proteins (replicase 1a and 1b, 3a, 3b, and protein 7) arranged on the genome in the order 5\u2032-replicase (1a/1b)-S-3a-3b-E-M-N-7-3\u2032. The S glycoprotein of TGEV forms large, petal-shaped spikes on the surface of the virion which are responsible for binding to specific receptors on the membranes of susceptible cells. Aminopeptidase N (APN) is the major cell surface receptor for TGEV (Delmas et al., 1992) and several co-receptors including sialoglycoproteins have been implicated in conferring enteric tropism to TGEV (Ballesteros et al., 1997; Delmas et al., 1993) . Four major antigenic sites, A, B, C and D were characterized on the N terminus of the S protein using monoclonal antibodies Delmas et al., 1986 Delmas et al., , 1990 Simkins et al., 1992) . Monoclonal antibodies against S can neutralize virus infectivity either by blocking virus attachment to cells or through interfering with virus endocytosis or membrane fusion . The adjacent sites A and B were mapped to a region of approximately 200 amino acids beginning from residue 506 as its N terminal boundary (Godet et al., 1994) . Antigenic sites A/B also overlap with the domain of the S protein encompassing amino acids 522-744 that mediate aminopeptidase N (APN) receptor binding (Godet et al., 1994) . Three antigenic sites were also defined in the N protein (Martin Alonso et al., 1992; Simkins et al., 1989) .",

Attenuation and tropism shift can also occur in nature, an example being the naturally occurring S gene deletion mutant, the porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV), which has both reduced pathogenicity and a predominantly respiratory tropism (Pensaert et al., 1986; Saif and Sestak, 2006; Wesley et al., 1990a,b) . In contrast to TGEV, PRCV mainly infects the respiratory tract, causing mild to moderate pneumonia often with pronounced interstitial lung lesions, but with little or no replication in the intestine. Studies of PRCV have provided some insight into the determinants for the tropism and virulence changes in TGEV. At the genome level, PRCV and TGEV share high nucleotide sequence identity except that PRCV has a deletion in the 5\u2032 end of the S gene and deletions in ORF3, the latter leading to lack of or a truncated protein expressed. The 5\u2032 deletion in the S gene is widely believed to play a major role in the altered tissue tropism of PRCV (Wesley et al., 1990a (Wesley et al., , 1990b . Ballesteros et al. (1997) and Sanchez et al. (1999) identified two domains in the spike protein of attenuated TGEV Purdue strain PUR46-MAD responsible for binding APN and co-receptors and demonstrated that a respiratory Purdue Type TGEV (PTV) (formerly known as NEB72) lost the co-receptor binding site due to the S gene mutation. Point mutations in the spike gene leading to a shift from enteric to respiratory tropism were also found in high cell culture passaged TGEV strain TOY56 (Sanchez et al., 1992) . Thus the spike protein has been recognized as not only a tropism but also a virulence determinant.",

For instance, amino acid mutations in the M protein affect the ability of attenuated Purdue TGEV P115 to induce IFN-alpha, implying a potential role for the M protein in altered host response and virulence . Other evidence has implicated a role for nonstructural proteins 3a and 3b in determining virulence of these swine enteric and respiratory coronaviruses (Paul et al., 1997) . An infectious clone of TGEV Purdue strain PUR46-MAD with ORF3 gene deletions showed a slightly reduced pathogenicity in vivo, but normal replication in cell culture . Similar effects of ORF3 deletion were also observed for the group 3 coronavirus, infectious bronchitis virus (Hodgson and Cavanagh, 2006; Shen et al., 2003) . However, in one study a TGEV strain 96-1933 with a deletion in ORF3a was demonstrated to maintain enteric virulence (McGoldrick et al., 1999) , suggesting that ORF3a is not essential for virulence, although the virulence of this virus needs to be further confirmed because the virus isolated and sequenced was not plaque purified and was not tested in pigs after plaque purification.",

In Purdue P115 there was a 6 nt deletion in the S gene, leading to a spike protein 2 aa shorter than virulent Purdue strain (1447 vs. 1449 aa). Sequence analysis confirmed the previously reported 681 nt deletion in the 5\u2032 end of the S gene in PRCV-ISU-1 (Bae et al., 1991; Wesley et al., 1991) .",

Interestingly, the naturally attenuated PRCV-ISU-1 also has an alanine residue at the corresponding position. This suggests that the alanine in place of serine may be a genetic marker for attenuation of TGEV strains and for PRCV which is also attenuated for pigs. A study by Sanchez et al. (1992) revealed that all TGEV strains analyzed had an alanine at aa 585 of the spike protein except for Mil65-AME.

            "text": "Although researchers have indicated that deletions in ORF3 may be involved in the virulence of TGEV (Paul et al., 1997) and deletion of ORF3 gene in a recombinant TGEV virus showed a limited effect on the viral virulence in vivo , only one mutation, but no deletions and insertions was found in the ORF3a and ORF3b proteins of the attenuated Purdue TGEV P115 when compared to the virulent Purdue TGEV and no mutations in ORF3 proteins were shared in the two virulent/attenuated pairs. It is noteworthy that we predicted the existence of protein 3b of virulent and attenuated Purdue TGEV viruses using the VIGOR program. Others suggested that the mRNA encoding protein 3b was not observed in TGEV Purdue, but only in Miller strains using infected cell lysates and Northern blot analysis Penzes et al., 2001) and therefore described it as a pseudogene in TGEV Purdue strains. A mutation was found in the highly conserved core sequence (CS, previously known as intergenic sequence IS) within coronavirus transcription regulatory motif, 5\u2032-CUAAAC-3\u2032, preceding ORF3b genes of the TGEV Purdue strains. This mutation replaced the last nucleotide C in CS with U. Because the CS represents signals for coronavirus transcription of subgenomic mRNAs (Lai and Cavanagh, 1997; Sawicki and Sawicki, 1990) , it is speculated that the mutation renders the mRNA encoding the 3b protein undetectable by Northern blot for TGEV Purdue strains. However, the single mutation in the CS preceding the ORF3b gene of TGEV Purdue viruses may not completely abolish its transcription. It has been demonstrated that a core sequence differing at the last nucleotide from the canonical one (5\u2032-CUAAAC-3\u2032) maintains efficient transcription for the downstream gene . Because we observed this mutation in the CS of ORF3b gene for both virulent Purdue and attenuated Purdue P115 strains, protein 3b is unlikely to play a role in the attenuation of TGEV Purdue strains. Similarly, the absence of mutations or deletions in the nonstructural protein 7 of the virulent/attenuated Purdue TGEV pair indicates that changes in this protein alone are unlikely to be involved in the attenuation process, although evidence suggests that deletion of the entire ORF7 gene resulted in altered in vivo replication and virulence of TGEV based on a recombinant PUR46-MAD virus (Ortego et al., 2003) .",

            "text": "Due to lack of proof-reading activity of the virally encoded RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, coronaviruses introduce frequent mutations into their genomes during replication. In addition to randomly generated mutations, RNA recombination can also occur when multiple distinct coronavirus species infect the same host. The occurrence of frequent genomic changes leads to generation of new coronaviruses that can have altered pathogenicity, different tissue tropism or ability to cross host species barrier. An example is the SARS outbreak caused by a previously unidentified coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Recent studies identified bats as the likely natural reservoir of SARS-CoV. The SARS-CoV-like coronaviruses of bats may have potentially become adapted to humans through genomic mutation and recombination events either directly or via intermediate hosts (civet cats, etc.) (Hampton, 2005; Lau et al., 2005; Li et al., 2005; Normile, 2005) . Although occurrence of SARS surprised the medical community, the relevance of RNA recombination and mutation to animal coronavirus evolution and tropism shift had been previously well recognized for TGEV and PRCV strains (Saif, 2004 (Saif, , 2005 Saif and Sestak, 2006; Sanchez et al., 1992) . The independent appearance of PRCV in both Europe and the United States in the 1989s highlighted the possible emergence of new coronavirus strains with altered tissue tropism, virulence or host specificity due to genomic deletion and mutation events. The European PRCV strains characterized had a 672 nt deletion in the same position within the S gene, suggesting they evolved from the same predecessor (Callebaut et al., 1988; Sanchez et al., 1990 Sanchez et al., , 1992 . However, the initial PRCV strains detected in the United States had deletions of 681 nt in size (Kwon et al., 1998; Wesley et al., 1991) . Subsequently other PRCV strains were isolated that varied in the size of the spike gene deletion (Halbur et al., 1993; Kim et al., 2000; Vaughn et al., 1994) . Nevertheless, deletions in the S genes disrupt expression of antigenic sites on S proteins of both European and American PRCV strains. As a result, TGEV and PRCV can be serologically differentiated by monoclonal antibodies to the two antigenic sites (Callebaut et al., 1988; Simkins et al., 1993) . TGEV and PRCV can also be genetically differentiated by nested RT-PCR using primers flanking the S gene deletion (Kim et al., 2000; Paton et al., 1997) .",

Nevertheless, it remains unclear which strain of TGEV is the immediate ancestor of PRCV-ISU-1. It had been hypothesized that PRCV may have evolved from a live vaccine strain of TGEV such as the Purdue strain used for commercial vaccines in the US. However, our analysis suggests that PRCV-ISU-1 may have evolved from a TGEV Miller-like strain. Several lines of evidence support this conclusion. First, our results showed that PRCV-ISU-1 has a higher genomic sequence identity (98%) with Miller M6 than with Purdue strains and it has a closer relationship to Miller strains than to Purdue strains (including the complete Purdue strain genome available in GenBank) by phylogenetic analysis. Secondly, Miller strains have identical or similar deletions in the ORF3 gene as PRCV-ISU-1. The 29 nt deletion from nt 195 to 223 of the ORF3 gene of PRCV-ISU-1 is shared by Miller strains, but not by Purdue strains. The 117 nt deletion in ORF3b gene (nt 407 to 523) of PRCV-ISU-1 overlaps with the 531 nt deletion in ORF3b of Miller M60. This deletion is notable because it occurs at the same amino acid in each predicted polypeptide and at equivalent nucleotide coordinates in both M60 and PRCV-ISU-1. The fact that PRCV-ISU-1 has the closest relationship with Miller strains at both the genomic and protein levels and the ORF3 gene of Miller strains also have a high frequency of mutations and deletions suggests that a Miller-like strain is the ancestor of PRCV-ISU-1 and M60 may represent an analog of an intermediate species during PRCV evolution from a TGEV Miller-like strain.",

Briefly M6 and M60 are low and high tissue culture-passaged TGEV virulent and attenuated Miller strains, respectively (Saif and Sestak, 2006) . The virulent Miller M6 was derived from field Miller isolate after 6 passages and 2 plaque purification steps in swine testicular (ST) cells in Ohio in 1965 (Bohl and Kumagai, 1965; Saif and Sestak, 2006; Welch and Saif, 1988) . The Miller M60 was attenuated after 60 passages and 2 plaque purification steps in ST cells (Saif and Sestak, 2006; Woods, 1979) . The virulent Purdue strain was originally isolated by Haelterman in Indiana and passed 8 times in pigs, with 2 subsequent cloning steps in ST cells (Haelterman, 1964) . Continuous passage 115 times (115X), with numerous plaque purifications of the virulent Purdue strain led to the attenuated Purdue P115 strain (Bohl et al., 1972) . The ISU-1 strain of PRCV originated from a herd isolate by Hill in Indiana in 1990 . It was passaged 8\u00d7 in ST cell culture and plaque purified 2\u00d7 (Hill et al., 1990) . The prototypic viruses were subjected to additional passages in ST cells or gnotobiotic pigs before sequencing in our lab. An additional 10, 4, 10, and 11 passages in ST cells were applied to Miller M6, Miller M60, PRCV-ISU-1, and Purdue P115, respectively. For virulent TGEV Purdue, 2 more passages were done in gnotobiotic pigs and the cell passaged M6 (10 additional passages) was also confirmed as virulent for the gnotobiotic pigs (Welch and Saif, 1988) .",

Oligonucleotide primers were purchased from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, California, USA). Primer sequences are included in Supplementary Table S1 . Reverse transcription and polymerase chain reactions (RT-PCR) were performed with 50-200 ng of coronavirus RNA supplemented with ribonuclease inhibitor (RNASEOUT, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, California, USA) using OneStep RT-PCR according to the manufacturers instructions (OneStep RT-PCR Kit, Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA). Duplicate reactions were analyzed for quality control purposes by agarose gel electrophoresis. Amplicons were prepared for sequencing by incubation at 37\u00b0C for 60 min with 0.5 U of Shrimp Alkaline Phosphatase (USB, Cleveland, Ohio) and 1 U of Exonuclease I (USB, Cleveland, Ohio) to inactivate remaining dNTPs and to digest the single-stranded primers. The enzymes were inactivated by incubation at 72\u00b0C for 15 min. Sequencing reactions were performed on a standard high-throughput sequencing system using Big Dye Terminator chemistry (Applied Biosystems) with 2 \u03bcl of template cDNA. Each amplicon was sequenced from each end using M13 forward and reverse primers listed above. Sequencing reactions were analyzed on a 3730 ABI sequencer.",
