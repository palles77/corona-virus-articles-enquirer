            "text": "The resonant cavity imaging biosensor (RCIB) is an optical technique for detecting molecular binding interactions label free at many locations in parallel that employs an optical resonant cavity for high sensitivity. Near-infrared light centered at 1512.5 nm couples resonantly through a Fabry-Perot cavity constructed from dielectric reflectors (Si/SiO 2 ), one of which serves as the binding surface. As the wavelength is swept using a tunable laser, a near-infrared digital camera monitors cavity transmittance at each pixel. A wavelength shift in the local resonant response of the optical cavity indicates binding. Positioning the sensing surface with respect to the standing wave pattern of the electric field within the cavity controls the sensitivity with which the presence of bound molecules is detected. Transmitted intensity at thousands of pixel locations is recorded simultaneously in a 10 s, 5 nm scan. An initial proof-of-principle setup has been constructed. A test sample was fabricated with 25, 100-\u03bcm wide square features, each with a different density of 1-\u03bcm square depressions etched 12 nm into the SiO 2 surface. The average depth of each etched region was found with 0.05 nm rms precision. In a second test, avidin, bound selectively to biotin conjugated bovine serum albumin, was detected.",

            "text": "Much of the mechanisms of life-cell physiology, regulation of gene expression, and cell replication-and even the development of disease rely heavily on binding events. These entail the physical association of proteins and/or nucleic acid to form multicomponent complexes, associations that often exhibit exquisite specificity. There exists, as such, a continued drive in both biological research and medicine for tools to interrogate these interactions with greater efficiency, accuracy, and simplicity. The ability to scale throughput and simultaneously measure binding in complex arrays has become the basis for DNA and protein microarray technology, which has led to new fields of exploration in genomics and proteomics [1] - [3] . Protein microarray technology may hold particular benefit in medicine for the detection of protein biomarkers that can provide a wealth of information about a particular patient's health [4] . Label-free detection schemes for interrogating molecular interactions, such as surface plasmon resonance (SPR) that do not require the labeling of one or the other binding components with a fluorescent dye, radiolabel, or other modification, are preferable [5] . This is particularly true in the case of protein assays, where direct labeling methods may unpredictably alter the binding properties of the target protein, whereas alternative indirect labeling methods may suffer from significant nonspecific binding or cross reactivity [6] . We present a technique based on a Fabry-Perot cavity for interrogating binding interactions label free that detects from many locations in parallel on the surface of one of the reflectors with the capacity to scale readily to much greater throughput.",

            "text": "The present approach measures molecule binding to a surface by monitoring the resulting change in optical transmission characteristics of a resonant cavity structure. This change can be the result of a thickness increase of a thin layer of molecules on the surface (height change), a refractive index change, or a combination of height and index change. Interference microscopes have long been used in the biological sciences for deducing the amount of material present on a glass slide by measuring the optical path difference, product of the thickness and refractive index [7] . In addition, optical surface profilers that detect height changes across a surface by interference are standard tools in many semiconductor-processing laboratories [8] . Similar interference techniques optimized for detecting molecules bound to a dielectric surface such as SiO 2 have been developed specifically for biosensing applications [9] - [18] . What differentiates the present work from previous interference-based efforts is the use of a Fabry-Perot cavity, where one reflector serves as the binding surface. The key advantage is the high throughput, or the number of spots detected in parallel that becomes immediately available with this configuration combined with the high sensitivity that optical resonance can provide. In the present demonstration, 16384 pixels on the camera perform independent simultaneous measurements, a number that scales readily with higher pixel density cameras. In addition, the setup can be made simple and cost effective to operate.",

            "text": "In comparison with imaging SPR, it is worth noting that the present technique makes use of a SiO 2 surface rather than a metallic surface [19] , [20] . The use of SiO 2 provides a different set of surface activation chemistries. The choice of SiO 2 /Si also benefits from mature semiconductor processing technology that may offer reduced cost and enables easy integration with electronics for potential lab-on-a-chip applications. It is also noted that SPR detection is generally performed real-time in solution, which can enable one to observe binding dynamics [19] . Whereas binding dynamics are important for a number of applications, there often remains great value in observing the endpoint alone, particularly when doing so provides improved test simplicity, cost effectiveness, or speed. Nearly the entire present day DNA and protein microarray market, including commercially available medical diagnostics, observe only the binding endpoint [1] - [4] , [21] . As well, many low-throughput protein-based medical diagnostics forgo observing binding dynamics [22] . In the present system, real time, in solution measurements, have been avoided along with the challenge they present to cavity stability. The value that the present technique offers over state-of-the-art label-free sensing is that the setup is simple, tests can be fast and cost effective, and the technique scales readily to very high throughput. These attributes may well be most significant for widespread use in medical diagnostics.",

The capturing agents are patterned on one of the reflecting surfaces. A collimated beam of light is incident on the cavity through one of the reflectors, and the wavelength is swept in time. A camera images the transmitted intensity mapping the resonance characteristic from each location along the planar cavity surface to a pixel on the camera. Target molecules bound to their corresponding capturing agents fixed to the reflector surface shift the local resonant condition of the cavity. Essentially, on-resonance light is stored inside the cavity, and sensitivity to changes in index or layer thickness at a point is enhanced proportional to the local optical field. Tuning the wavelength of the excitation light and monitoring the transmitted light with a detector array (camera) allows simultaneous recording of the transmission spectra of the entire structure, i.e., all individual binding features. The number of spots evaluated simultaneously is essentially limited by the number of pixels available on the camera, and thus, can scale readily to achieve very high throughput. State-of-the-art tunable lasers provide robust and precise control of the excitation wavelength.",

The optical field within the cavity forms a standing wave pattern with periodic maxima and minima. The reflector which serves as the sensing surface is given an extra SiO 2 layer, approximately a quarter wavelength thick, such that the sensing surface is at a field maximum within the cavity. When the sensing surface is in a field maximum, thickness (or index) changes at that surface have a maximum effect on the field distribution, thereby shifting the resonant wavelength by maximum amount. For a surface placed in a standing wave minimum, a small change in thickness (or index) has almost no effect on the optical field, and hence, the transmission spectra. The ability to control the sensitivity by controlling the thickness of the final oxide layer is highly advantageous. By eliminating the extra oxide layer from the far reflector, the local resonant condition can be made insensitive to any contaminants that may be bound on the far reflector. Though it was not performed presently, the oxide may similarly be removed in the background regions of the probe reflector (between capturing agent spots). This would cause the background regions to become insensitive to nonspecific binding and serve as important reference surfaces.",

When the thickness d \u0394 is nearly zero, these effects work against each other to diminish sensitivity (zero sensitivity in the limit of a small change in thickness d \u0394 = 0). When the thickness d \u0394 is a quarter wavelength, a \u03c0 phase shift is introduced, and the effects add optimally for high sensitivity.

The reflectivity of the reflectors was varied to achieve a finesse of 2, 15, and 30, corresponding to 11.5-1.9-, and 0.9nm full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) resonant curves, respectively (40-\u03bcm cavity spacing). As an approximation, white Gaussian noise was added to the curves with a SNR ranging from 25 to 50 dB, the noisy curves were sampled at 0.01 nm steps and fit. Improving the finesse from 2 to 30 reduced the wavelength deviation 100-fold from 5 to 0.05 pm using an SNR of 50 dB (see Fig. 3 ). It is noted that using (3), the percent modulation of the transmittance is not independent of the finesse (drops to 10% at a finesse of 2). However, even if 100% modulation could be maintained, similar calculation shows that a finesse of 30 as compared to 2 still provides a 10-fold improvement. This simulation demonstrates how higher finesse can improve the accuracy with which the resonant wavelength can be determined in the presence of noise. Whereas increasing the finesse improves the axial resolution, the finesse cannot be increased arbitrarily while maintaining high lateral resolution. It has been previously considered in filter design that diverging light effectively reduces finesse [28] . What is unique in the present case is that the cavity is being imaged, and it is the numerical aperture (NA) of the imaging system that determines the divergence of the collected light. The broadening effect due to divergence is negligible when the NA is 0.1 and the reflectors are spaced 40 \u03bcm apart as is the case in the present demonstration.",

Calculations indicate for fitted curves shot noise, camera noise, and intensity fluctuations account for less than 8 pm of uncertainty in determining the height of features on the reflector surface when the reflectors are positioned 40 \u03bcm apart. The technique is inherently sensitive to reflector separation, which presents another source of noise. In the present setup, the reflector separation is observed to drift 40 pm within the measurement time. Calculations and qualitative tests confirm that the drift is caused by thermal expansion of components. Surface roughness also contributes to the uncertainty in the present measurement process since the signal from a particular feature is found by comparing the resonant wavelength for that region with the average resonant wavelength for the surrounding surface. Roughness from both reflector surfaces contributes to the 300 pm of height uncertainty, and is found to contribute similarly when averaging over different size regions ranging from 10 to 200 \u03bcm across. The primary noise contributors, at present, then, are thermal drift of the reflector spacing (40 pm uncertainty) and surface roughness (300 pm uncertainty). In the absence of reflector position drift, surface roughness, intensity fluctuations, and camera noise, for the present cavity configuration (reflectors spaced 40 \u03bcm apart and a finesse of 38) and measurement (curves sampled in 0.0167 nm increments) shot noise would limit height sensitivity to 1 pm.",

The reflectors are positioned approximately 40 \u03bcm apart, parallel, and in resonance at 1512.5 nm by adjusting the tip-tilt stage and the axial translation stage while monitoring the transmission. Once aligned, the wavelength is quickly tuned to find two resonant wavelengths for a single pixel, which can be used to calculate the precise reflector separation. Data is collected by sweeping the wavelength from 1510 to 1515 nm in 10 s while collecting frames exposed for 16.3 ms at a rate of 30 fps (0.0167 nm steps). The cavity model is used together with the determined reflector separation to find the relation between wavelength shift and apparent surface height. From (3), one can understand that this apparent height profile may equivalently be the result of local refractive index changes in a thin layer on the SiO 2 surface or local increases in layer thickness. The surface is next fit with a second-order 2-D polynomial that is subtracted to remove the effect of reflector curvature and any remaining tilt. The apparent height of features in the data is determined by averaging over the pixels that comprise the feature and comparing their height to the average apparent height of a similar number of neighboring pixels.",

Shifting the averaging box by one full pixel (corresponds to 12 \u03bcm translation) changes the average height values 0.4 nm rms, demonstrating the importance of realignment between scans. Precise alignment presents a challenge since it requires that both reflectors be registered laterally to the camera within a pixel length (lateral adjustments can be difficult to monitor since they generally perturb the cavity resonance). In the case of protein binding, precise alignment would enable the roughness to be characterized initially, and its contribution to be subtracted from the final result. When not subtracted, the roughness adds background signal in a manner akin to the autofluorescence contribution from the slide in a labeled microarray experiment. Finally, it is noted that the 95% reflectivity of the two period Si/SiO 2 Bragg structures afforded a finesse of 38, a number that could be greatly improved with optimized reflector design. Sensitivity in the present test was limited by thermal drift of the reflector spacing and surface roughness, both of which could be addressed and improved.",

He was a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, and the Francis Bitter National Magnet Laboratory. Since 1989, he has been with Boston University, Boston, as a Professor of Physics, and is currently the Chair of the Department of Physics, a Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering, and a Professor of Biomedical Engineering. He was engaged in research on near-field imaging of photonic bandgap, ring microcavity, and single-mode waveguide devices, and has, recently, developed subsurface solid immersion microscopy for Si inspection. He is also the Director of the Center for Nanoscience and Nanobiotechnology, Boston University. His current research interests include ultrahigh resolution microscopy, spectroscopy techniques for hard and soft material systems, subcellular imaging with interferometric fluorescenent techniques, biosensor fabrication, and waveguide evanescent bioimaging techniques. Light enters the cavity through the reverse side of the first reflector. The wavelength is swept, and wavelength versus transmission curves are recorded by a camera positioned beyond the cavity. The capturing agents are fixed to one of the reflector surfaces, and binding to the surface is indicated by a local shift in the resonant response of the cavity. Boundary value problem in the present case consists of three boundaries: the boundary at either reflector (x = 0 and x = d 2 ) and the boundary between the low-index layer and the cavity medium (x = d 1 ). The r's indicate the coefficient of reflection at the three boundaries (0, 1, and 2), and t's indicate the coefficient of transmission through each boundary. Curves were calculated based on a 40-\u03bcm cavity spacing using (3). Noise was added and the curves were fit in a least squares sense. The reflectivity was adjusted to provide finesse F of 2, 15, and 30. The ability to detect slight changes in wavelength, as shown on the x-axis for different SNRs, is greatly improved by cavity finesse. For 40-\u03bcm cavity spacing, 1 nm height = 40 pm wavelength deviation. The cavity is formed between two reflectors held by stages (one translation and one tip-tilt). The cavity is illuminated with collimated light from a tunable wavelength laser (Agilent 81640A). Local cavity transmission is imaged on an indium-gallium-arsenide camera (Sensors Unlimited SU128-1.7R). Two recorded curves from two different pixels. The 0.3 nm shift, shown here, indicates a 7 nm apparent height difference on the surface for the cavity separation used (~40 \u03bcm). (a) Image intensity indicates height. The 36 dark squares and the crosses were deeply etched for alignment purposes. The 25 variable intensity boxes are the 100 \u03bcm \u00d7 100 \u03bcm regions with varying densities of 12-nm deep depressions. Lighter features indicate fewer depressions. The white boxes indicate areas averaged for determining feature height, which for the boxed feature shown was 4.20 nm below the background surface. (b) Average depth is plotted for all 25 features. Five scans were taken (three shown) with 0.05 nm rms deviation from scan to scan and 0.5 nm rms deviation from a linear dependence on depression density. RCIB result for avidin binding. Intensity indicates apparent height in the 1.5 mm \u00d7 1.5 mm area shown. The bright horizontal lines indicate molecules bound on the surface in each of the three channel regions designated by the numbers on the left side of the image. Avidin was introduced to channel #2 and channel #3. The signal was strongest from channel #2 (12.2 nm) where the avidin was expected to form a complex with the BSA-biotin on the surface.
