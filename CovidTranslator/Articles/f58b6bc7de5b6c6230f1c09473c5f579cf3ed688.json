Tijssen of the family Coronaviridae, was identified as the primary etiological agent [18, 24, 25] . No cross-reaction of this agent with other coronaviruses has been found by immuno-electron microscopy [18, 27] , but different isolates of the turkey coronavirus (TCV) were shown to be antigenically identical or closely related [27] . Attempts to adapt and propagate the Minnesota strain of T C V to different cultures of primary chicken and turkey embryonic cells were unsuccessful, and for this reason the candidate turkey enteric coronaviruses have not been adequately characterized [13, 26] . The prototype strain has been maintained by oral inoculation of one-day old poults or inoculation of embryonated turkey or chicken eggs [13, 24] . More recently, coronavirus-like particles were incriminated in outbreaks of diarrhea in turkey poults in Quebec, Canada [11] . This study was undertaken in order to characterize the structural proteins of a few of these TCV isolates that were serially propagated in turkey embryos.",

Sucrose density gradient centrifugation of the material collected from the intestine of infected embryos yielded two opalescent bands and three absorbance peaks (Fig. 2) . The predominant peak was found at densities of 1. t 8-1.20 g/ml. Aliquots from these fractions were shown to contain numerous intact virions and maximal HA activity (titers ranging from 1 : 512 to t : 2048 with rat erythrocytes). The other fractions contained only damaged particles and showed little HA activity. The short granular projections were more distinctive in particles which lost the typical club-shaped corona (Fig. 3A) . Generally, this purification procedure allowed us to prepare approximately 100 to 200 gg of viral material starting from the intestinal contents of 10 turkey embryos. According to EM, the resulting purified viral preparation contained approximately 10 7 viral particles per gg of protein.",

HI titers ofpre-immune serum were below the detectable level. When aliquots of diluted hyperimmune serum were reacted with the material used for immunization, aggregates were observed by IEM (Fig. 3 B) . tested against the homologous and/or heterologous TCV strains (Fig. 4) . Obvious differences among these TCV isolates were not detected by these assays. With the purified virus of the egg-adapted Minnesota strain, although numerous bands could be demonstrated by SDS-PAGE of the material present in sucrose gradient fractions corresponding to a buoyant density of 1.18-1.20 g/ ml, at least seven were reproducibly obtained. Further, only the latter polypeptides were still detectable after SDS-PAGE of the tenfold dilution of the original viral material (Fig. 5A) . The approximate molecular weights of the virion polypeptides were determined by comparing their electrophoretic mobilities with those of commercial available standards (Bio-Rad Lab., Richmond, CA) in 8.0, 10.0 or 12.0% polyacrylamide slab gels (data not shown). In the absence of 2-mercaptoethanol (2-ME), five of these major polypeptides appeared as single bands corresponding to molecular weights of 140,000, 95,000, 72-75,000, 34-38,000, and 24-26,000 (Fig. 5A ). The addition of 2 per cent 2-ME in the disruption buffer caused the partial disappearance of the 140,000 band and an increase of the amount of a polypeptide migrating at 66,000 (Fig. 5 B,  track 6) . A group of three to four closely migrating bands with mol. wt. between 48,000 and 56,000 were usually observed under these conditions, but a band corresponding to a mol. wt. of 52,000 was more predominant. Occasionaly, a polypeptide with a mol. wt. of 170,000 to 180,000 could be resolved with some preparations, but it generally remained stacked on top of the resolving gel. The patterns of polypeptide migration obtained with the four Quebec isolates were indistinguishable from that of the Minnesota strain (Fig. 5 B) .",

            "text": "In the present studies, we also reported the partial characterization of the structural polypeptides of the egg-adapted TCV strains. The preparation of \"pure virus\" and low quantity of material obtained at the end of the purification procedure, assignment of minor polypeptides, and contamination by host proteins raised difficulties in the analysis of the TCV polypeptide patterns. Similar problems were also mentioned for egg-adapted IBV strains [3, 21] , and enteric coronaviruses of other species that were purified directly from fecal samples [2, 12, 14] . The polypeptide patterns shown by various TCV isolates when grown, purified and analysed under identical conditions were quite similar. At least 7 polypeptides with estimated tool. weights of 180,000, 140,000, 95,000, 72-75,000, 66,000, 52,000, and 24-26,000, were reproducibly detected after SDS-PAGE of the purified viral preparations. The immunoblotting analysis, using specific rabbit antisera that have been previously adsorbed against normal egg homogenates to eliminate unwanted antibodies, was considered for the final identification of the structural viral polypeptides. The polypeptide patterns obtained with the various TCV isolates correlated with the general polypeptide profiles of coronaviruses [31, 34] . Although the glycoproteins were not identified per se in this study, the aspect of the migration patterns obtained in 8, 10, and 12% polyacrylamide gels (variations in the electrophoretic mobility) suggested that at least the polypeptides with molecular weights of 180,000, 140,000, 90,000, and 74,000 were glycosylated [29] . These polypeptides appear to be equivalent to the largest glycoproteins described for other coronaviruses, and may represent the peplomeric proteins in accordance with the findings of others investigators [31, 32, 33] . Nevertheless, the largest glycoproteins of TCV appear to differ fundamentally fi'om those of the well-characterized MHV and IBV viruses. Whereas the largest peplomeric glycoproteins of these two viruses are not changed by the action of reducing agents such as 2-mercaptoethanol [4, 32, 33, 38] , the 140,000 tool. wt.-protein of TCV appeared to be reduced to a presumptive 66,000 subunit. Interestingly, a similar 140,000 mol. wt. gtycoprotein, a disulfidelinked dimer, was described for three other hemagglutinating coronaviruses, namely the porcine hemaggtutinating encephalomyelitis virus (HEV), the bovine enteric coronavirus (BCV) and the coronavirus DVIM of mice [6, 16, 35] . It has been suggested that this polypeptide may represent the hemagglutinin of these viruses which is probably located on granular projections situated at the base of the typical club-shaped corona of the virions [17, 35] . Our observation by electron microscopy of two different types of surface projections on a few TCV particles also agree with the morphological features reported for the three above hemagglutinating coronaviruses and the model proposed by King and Brian [16] . The presence of a double fringe of surface projections has not been described for IBV, although the virus possesses an hemagglutinating activity [34, 38] . The 180,000 and 95,000 molecular weight-proteins of TCV apparently correspond to other peplomeric glycoproteins described for coronaviruses, including IBV, TGE, HEV, and DVIM viruses [6, 22, 35, 38, 39] . By analogy with these other coronaviruses, the 52,000 and 26,000 molecular weight-poly-peptides probably represent the nucleoprotein and the glycosylated matrix protein, respectively [31] . A protein of 76,000 molecular weight has also been demonstrated for the rabbit enteric coronavirus [12] , the HEV virus [6] and the IBV virus [7] . The exact nature of this protein is still unkown but it has been suspected to be a degradation product of the peplomers [6, 7] .",

            "text": "Cross-reaction study by Western blotting revealed that possible antigenic variants of the Bluecomb coronavirus may exist. These variants may differ by few epitopes localized on the peplomeric proteins and possibly on the hemagglutin subunit of 66,000 mol. weight. In general, primary and secondary structure epitopes are less affected by denaturation than tertiary or quaternary structure epitopes and thus, more likely to be recognized by antibodies in immunoblotting techniques [12] . Antibody binding to such conformation-dependent structures thus requires preservation of the native structure of the protein, which can be often achieved with the non-ionic detergent NP-40 [36] . Other reasons for the weak detection of the smallest polypeptide (mol.wt. 26,000) possibly include a relatively high degree of proteolysis in clinical specimens, or low immunogenicity (or low accessibility) of determinants. Production of monoclonal antibodies directed against defined epitopes of viral proteins and oligonucleotide finger printing of ribonucleic acids of different strains have been shown valuable tools to understand the antigenic diversity in cases of IBV and MHV viruses [8, 20, 22, 23, 37] . Such studies are presently in progress in order to establish the meaning of the differences observed amongst the Quebec TCV isolates.",
