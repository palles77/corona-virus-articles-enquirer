Our results indicate that a larger pulse vaccination rate will lead to the eradication of a disease. Furthermore, two thresholds \u211c 1 * and \u211c 2 * show that the diversity of the contagiousness affects the basic properties of these models. In addition, numerical results indicate that the probability for an infected individual to enter different infective compartments greatly affects two infective compartments.",

For instance, some infected hosts can be properly detected and treated, isolated or removed, whereas others remain undetected and untreated. It is obvious that in such circumstances the length of the infectious periods and the levels of contagiousness for these detected and undetected hosts can significantly differ. Moreover, the behavior of a virus within a host may be different. Some infections, such as Hepatitis B, can have either a highly contagious and comparatively short acute infectious stage, or can persist within a host for a long time without apparent symptoms and having comparatively low level of contagiousness. This leads to the questions whether this diversity of the levels of contagiousness and the lengths of the infective period affects the system dynamics, and whether the classic compartmental models in mathematical epidemiology, which postulate that all the hosts are identical, are adequate to describe the spread of an infection [3] .",

Other examples of viruses possessing multiple strains may be seen in corona viruses, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) [22] . The presence of multiple strains adds greater complication to models of disease dynamics due to an increasing number of stages through different infection-recovery combinatorics.

In the next section, we propose a two-delay disease Model with pulse vaccination and infectious Period. To prove the main results, we also give two lemmas. In Section 3, using the discrete dynamical system determined by the stroboscopic map, we establish sufficient conditions for the global attractivity of infection-free periodic solution.

Our results indicate that a larger pulse vaccination rate will lead to the eradication of a disease. Furthermore, two thresholds \u211c 1 * and \u211c 2 * show that the diversity of the contagiousness affects the basic properties of these models. Finally, we illustrate how probability for an infected individual to enter different infective compartments affects two infective compartments. (1) Corollaries 3.1 and 5.2 display the conditions of the eradication of the disease when there are two infective compartments and only one infective compartment, respectively. Obviously, the threshold max{\u03b8 1 * , \u03b8 2 * } is larger than \u03b8 * , which implies that a larger fraction of susceptibles should be vaccinated against the disease if multiple strains coexist. (2) Fig. 2(a) indicates that the number of the infected decreases as the probability ratio (P 1 : P 2 ) of an infected individual to enter the two infective compartments increases when the other parameters are the same as those in Fig. 1. (3) During the above investigation, we find that whether the disease will be extinct or not is dependent on the parameter p in the nonlinear incidence \u03b2 I S p which governs the transmission of the infection (see Fig. 2(b) ).",

For t \u2208 [t 0 , t 0 + \u03c4 ], it is easy to obtain I 1 (t) + I 2 (t) > m * * I from (4.6). Case IIIb. For t \u2208 [t 0 +\u03c4, t 0 +h], we claim I 1 (t)+ I 2 (t) > m * I . Otherwise, we suppose there is at \u2208 [t 0 +\u03c4, t 0 +h], such that I 1 (t) + I 2 (t) > m * * I for t \u2208 [t 0 ,t], and I 1 (t) + I 2 (t) = m * * I . From (4.2), (4.3) and (4.5), we havewhich is contradictory to I 1 (t) + I 2 (t) = m * * I . Therefore, the claim holds true. Since t 0 is arbitrary, there exists m I := min{ m * I 2 , m * * I } > 0, such that I 1 (t) + I 2 (t) \u2265 m I for all t > t 0 . The proof is completed. ",
