These data will also help inform about the role of pertussis vaccination in adults.",

Slightly fewer (93%) agreed that clear policies and protocols for everyone to follow were in place.

Furthermore, preventive measures were strictly enforced and effective in Singaporean, and the outbreak was contained successfully. In contrast, preventive measures were in place in Japan, but workers lacked confidence in an untested system (2) . These differences are probable explanations for the varying responses in the Singapore and Japanese healthcare workers. The perceived need for adherence to prescribed measures and willingness to follow protocols were quite different, given the difference in perceived risks. In SARS-free Japan, most healthcare workers were aware that institutional policies and protocols existed, but less than a third were confident of their effectiveness. The degree of implementation and adherence endorsed by healthcare workers was also lower in Japan.",
