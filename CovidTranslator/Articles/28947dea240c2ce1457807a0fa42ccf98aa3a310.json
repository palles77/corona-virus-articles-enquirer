Interleukin (IL)-23, a heterodimeric cytokine composed of IL-23p19 and IL-12/23p40 subunits, stimulates the growth and expansion of Th17 cells, and has been implicated in psoriasis pathogenesis. To study the associations between TGF-\u03b21, the IL-23/Th17 inflammatory pathway, and psoriasis, we investigated inflammatory skin disease in transgenic mice that constitutively overexpress human TGF-\u03b21 in basal keratinocytes (K5.hTGF-\u03b21 transgenic mice); these mice had previously been reported as having a psoriasis-like disease. K5.hTGF-\u03b21 transgenic mice had high levels of TGF-\u03b21 mRNA and protein in both skin and serum. Levels of cytokines involved in IL-23/Th17-mediated inflammation were not elevated in lesional skin compared with those in non-lesional and wild-type skin. It is noteworthy that IL-4 and IgE were markedly elevated in inflamed skin and serum, respectively, of transgenic mice. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) specifically directed against IL-23p19 or IL-12/23p40 had no clinical effect on established inflammatory skin disease in K5.hTGF-\u03b21 transgenic mice, whereas the same mAbs were able to block the development of murine experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, an IL-23/Th17mediated disease. In summary, the IL-23/Th17 inflammatory pathway is not responsible for the maintenance of inflammatory skin disease in K5.hTGF-\u03b21 transgenic mice.",

            "text": "Interleukin (IL)-23 is primarily produced by dendritic cells (Oppmann et al., 2000) , and is clearly elevated in psoriasis lesions, as indicated by increased levels of mRNA for each of its subunit components, IL-23p19 and IL-12/23p40, in lesional skin as compared with those in non-lesional skin, whereas mRNA levels of IL-12/35p35 are not elevated (Lee et al., 2004; Chamian et al., 2005; Chan et al., 2006; Toichi et al., 2006) . Furthermore, an intradermal injection of recombinant IL-23, but not of IL-12, into mice induces acute histological changes reminiscent of human psoriasis (Chan et al., 2006; Zheng et al., 2007) . These IL-23-triggered changes are dependent on cytokines produced by T helper (Th) 17 cells (Zheng et al., 2007) . Th17 cells are a newly appreciated subset of CD4+ T helper cells, distinct from Th1 and Th2 cells, which are dependent on IL-23 for survival and expansion (Oppmann et al., 2000; Aggarwal et al., 2003) . Genetic or antibody targeting of either IL-23 or Th17 cells ameliorates several T-cell-mediated autoimmune disorders in mice, including classic models of rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis (Cua et al., 2003; Murphy et al., 2003; Langrish et al., 2005; Chen et al., 2006) . In contrast, targeting of IL-12 or Th1 cells leads to worsening of these same conditions (Cua et al., 2003; Murphy et al., 2003; Langrish et al., 2005; Chen et al., 2006) . Thus, the IL-23/Th17 inflammatory pathway is critical in mediating distinct autoimmune Tcell-mediated inflammatory diseases in mice, and its role in mediating inflammation in human psoriasis appears to be equally important (Fitch et al., 2007) .",

Neutralization of TGF-\u03b21 abrogates differentiation of naive murine CD4+ T cells to Th17 cells in culture, whereas exposure to TGF-\u03b21 and pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6 induces Th0 cells to become mature Th17 effector cells (Veldhoen et al., 2006) . Mice that completely lack TGF-\u03b21 have lower serum levels of IL-17 and produce fewer IL-17+CD4+splenic T cells, whereas mice that overexpress TGF-\u03b21 under the IL-2 promoter produce more antigenstimulated IL-17 (Mangan et al., 2006) . In addition, TGF-\u03b21 expression by T cells is required for the induction of Th17 cells in certain tissues (Li et al., 2007) .",

A recent evaluation of murine models of human psoriasis ranked K5.hTGF-\u03b21 transgenic mice high among the numerous models, because of clinical, histological, and cellular similarities to human psoriasis (Gudjonsson et al., 2007) . These mice clinically showed many clinical and cellular hallmarks of psoriasis, including erythematous scaly plaques, epidermal hyperproliferation, hyperkeratosis, acanthosis, and inflammatory cell infiltrates of CD8+ T cells and neutrophils in the epidermis, and CD4+ T cells and macrophages in the dermis (Li et al., 2004) . Clinical disease is apparent by 4 months of age in most mice, with consistent Koebnerization of ears at sites of ear tagging (Li et al., 2004) . As TGF-\u03b21 induces Th17 differentiation in mice, and given the importance of Th17 cells in human psoriasis, we investigated the role of the IL-23/Th17 inflammatory pathway in the pathogenesis of inflammatory skin disease in K5.hTGF-\u03b21 transgenic mice.",

Treated mice were evaluated with a clinical diseasescoring system to determine the response to therapy. Mice with baseline disease scores of two or more were treated for 3 weeks by intraperitoneal injection, with 1 mg of neutralizing mAbs directed against either IL-23p19 or IL-12/23p40, or they were treated with isotype control Abs. Skin disease progressed in a similar manner in isotype control Ab-treated (Figures 3a and 4a) , anti-IL-23p19 mAb-treated (Figures 3b and 4a) , and anti-IL-12/23p40 mAb-treated (Figures 3c and 4a) K5.hTGF-\u03b21 transgenic mice. It is noteworthy that all histological analyses of lesional skin isolated from K5.hTGF-\u03b21 transgenic mice undergoing treatment were similar, and showed hyperkeratosis with serum crust, acanthosis, and a superficial mixed inflammatory infiltrate consisting of mononuclear cells and scattered eosinophils (Figure 3) . Weight loss was similar across all groups tested (Figure 4b ). To ensure that mAbs were functional in neutralizing IL-12 and IL-23, treatment with 1 mg of anti-IL-23p19 and anti-IL-12/23p40 mAbs prevented the onset of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (Figure 4c ), a disease mediated by IL-23 and Th17 cells (Chen et al., 2006) .",

As TGF-\u03b21 is a critical component in the development of Th17 cells in mice (Bettelli et al., 2006; Mangan et al., 2006; Veldhoen et al., 2006) , we originally hypothesized that overexpression of TGF-\u03b21 by keratinocytes could influence the differentiation of naive T cells in skin-draining lymph nodes, and lead to enhanced development of Th17 cells. These Th17 cells, through expression of skin-homing receptors, CCR6 and CCR4 (Acosta- Rodriguez et al., 2007a, b) , would return to the skin and release inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-17A, IL-22, and TNF-\u03b1. The net result would be the establishment and maintenance of psoriasiform lesions (Li et al., 2004) . Disease would resolve on mAb therapy directed against IL-23, similar to human psoriasis (Krueger et al., 2007; Kimball et al., 2008; Leonardi et al., 2008; . We showed, however, that levels of IL-23 and Th17 cytokines are not elevated in K5.hTGF-\u03b21 transgenic mice (Figures 1 and 2) . We also showed that mAb targeting of the IL-23/Th17 inflammatory pathway does not affect the maintenance of skin disease in these mice (Figures 3 and 4) . As we learn more about the role of IL-23 and Th17 cells in the pathogenesis of human psoriasis and other inflammatory skin diseases, it will be critical to investigate this pathway in each of the various murine models of these diseases. We believe that this study will provide the framework to carry out these future studies.",

The K5.hTGF-\u03b21 transgenic mice showed clinical, histological, and cytokine expression features that were different than those originally described by Li et al. (2004) . More specifically, this original publication described many characteristics of human psoriasis, yet our findings suggest that these mice have features that resemble human atopic dermatitis more so than human psoriasis (for example, crusted skin lesions, scattered tissue eosinophils, high lesional IL-4 expression, and high-serum IgE levels). It is unclear why we found such different results compared with the results arrived at by Li et al. , but this may be because of changes in transgene expression that could occur after years of breeding of K5.hTGF-\u03b21 transgenic mice. Although we have definitively shown that the IL-23/ Th17 inflammatory pathway is not involved in the inflammatory skin disease observed in these transgenic mice, the precise mechanisms underlying pathogenesis in these mice remain unresolved. For example, the contributions of bacterial colonization and scratching in exacerbating skin lesions in these mice may be studied further, and would be particularly relevant in further understanding the pathogenesis of atopic dermatitis.",

Although the combination of TGF-\u03b21 and IL-6 can direct the differentiation of murine Th17 cells, TGF-\u03b21 can also inhibit the pathogenic function of these cells, even in the presence of IL-23 (McGeachy et al., 2007) . It is possible that TGF-\u03b21, in the setting of K5.hTGF-\u03b21 transgenic mice, does not drive Th17 cells toward an inflammatory phenotype, but restricts their pro-inflammatory activities. Furthermore, TGF-\u03b21, in a non-inflammatory tissue milieu, can induce Treg differentiation from naive T cells as well as the production of the Treg transcription factor, foxp3 (McGeachy and Cua, 2008) . Our data indicate that mRNA levels of Treg-associated factors, foxp3, IL-12/35p35, and IL-10, are elevated in lesional skin than in non-lesional skin. It is also noteworthy that the protein subunit encoded by IL-12/35p35 can bind with the Epstein-Barr virus-induced 3 protein, or EBI3, to create the anti-inflammatory Treg-associated cytokine known as IL-35 (Collison et al., 2007) . Although foxp3, IL-12/35p35, and IL-10 mRNA are elevated in skin of K5.hTGF-\u03b21 transgenic mice, it is still not known whether Treg populations play a key pathogenic role in these mice.",

In one study of 60 patients with psoriasis and 38 without psoriasis, serum TGF-\u03b21 was increased in psoriatics than in controls, and higher TGF-\u03b21 correlated with higher clinical disease scores (Nockowski et al., 2004) . Another study showed a correlation of disease severity with concentrations of TGF-\u03b21 in psoriatic scales (Flisiak et al., 2002) . Several other studies, however, have shown a negative or absent correlation of expression of TGF-\u03b21 or its receptors in psoriasis (Leivo et al., 1998; Doi et al., 2003) . These published studies are insufficient to determine definitely whether there is a positive or negative correlation between TGF-\u03b21 and psoriasis. Indeed, recent studies showed that TGF-\u03b21 is not involved in the differentiation of human Th17 cells (unlike in the development of murine Th17 cells) (Acosta-Rodriguez et al., 2007a, b) , and that there is no association between TGF-\u03b21 polymorphisms and psoriasis susceptibility (Baran et al., 2007) .

K5.hTGF-\u03b21 transgenic mice were treated on weeks 0, 1, and 2 with 1 mg isotype control Ab (a), anti-IL-23p19 mAbs (b), or anti-IL-12/23p40 mAbs (c). n = 5 mice per group for anti-IL-23p19 and anti-IL-12/23p40, and n = 4 mice per group for isotype. (a-c) Representative clinical photos are shown before (week 0) and after treatment (week 3), whereas representative H&E skin sections are shown after treatment at week 3. It is interesting to note that all histological analyses of lesional skin isolated from K5.hTGF-\u03b21 transgenic mice undergoing treatment were similar, and showed hyperkeratosis with serum crust, acanthosis, and a superficial mixed inflammatory infiltrate consisting of mononuclear cells and scattered eosinophils. Bar = 40 \u03bcm in figures labeled \"lo\" and 20 \u03bcm in figures labeled \"hi.\" (a) Severity of disease was assessed at weeks 0 and 3. (b) Weights of mice were assessed at weeks 0 and 3, as an additional quantitative measurement of disease. (c) Anti-IL-23p19 and anti-IL-12/23p40 mAbs were effective in preventing experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis in SJL mice. Mice were injected i.p. on days \u22121 and 6 with 1 mg of anti-IL-23p19 or anti-IL-12/23p40 mAbs, or isotype IgG Abs, or nothing. Disease severity was measured daily after immunization with PLP139-151.",
