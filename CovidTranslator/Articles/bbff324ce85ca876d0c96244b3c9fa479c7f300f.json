Here, we assessed the ability of dasatinib and lycorine to restore bezafibrate-and medroxyprogesterone acetate-induced apoptosis in cells exposed to CD40 ligand.

            "text": "Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a disease of neoplastic B cells characterized by the progressive accumulation of CD5 + B lymphocytes in the peripheral blood, bone marrow and secondary lymphoid organs. [1] [2] [3] [4] In the western world it is the most common form of adult leukemia and has a widely variable clinical course with many patients never requiring therapy. There are 22-30/100,000 new cases per year worldwide and the majority of patients are over 65 years old. 5 According to recent Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results the median age at diagnosis is 72 years. 6 In younger patients, the current front-line therapy is a combination of fludarabine, cyclophosphamide and rituximab 7 but this regimen is associated with significant toxicity for elderly patients. CLL remains incurable for the majority of patients who become refractory to chemotherapy 6, 8, 9 and there is a need to develop less toxic and novel therapies that can overcome drug resistance. 8 The tumor microenvironment, in particular the lymph nodes, has been shown to be both the center for CLL cell proliferation and to protect cells against chemotherapeutics. 10 The lymph node is rich in T cells that express CD40 ligand (CD40L) and engage CLL cells via CD40 to stimulate proliferation in proliferation centers and protect against apoptotic signals. Histopathology has confirmed that within the proliferation centers, proliferating CLL cells are directly exposed to CD40L signals. 11 Furthermore, CLL cells are protected from spontaneous apoptosis in vitro when co-cultured with autologous T cells 12 and many studies, including our own, have demonstrated that CLL cells are protected from drug-induced apoptosis by culture with CD40L and interleukin-4. [13] [14] [15] [16] Therapies that overcome this protective mechanism within proliferation centers, while also targeting the circulating neoplastic cells, are likely to provide better response rates and reduce the rate of relapse. Encouragingly, Hallaert et al. 17 recently found that the protective effects of CD40L could be overcome by the use of the c-Abl kinase inhibitor, dasatinib. It was reported that this was due to a reduction in anti-apoptotic proteins and it was proposed that this agent could successfully sensitize CLL cells within the lymph nodes to chemotherapeutics such as fludarabine. However, the CD40L signal was not provided continuously and the apoptosis associated with dasatinib treatment was only apparent following removal of CD40L. It cannot, therefore, be categorically concluded that dasatinib would be able to overcome CD40L in vivo and sensitize CLL cells to therapeutics. In addition, it is questionable whether the dose of 100 \u03bcM fludarabine is clinically achievable, since the reported peak concentration of fludarabine in lymphocytes and plasma is between 3 and 19 \u03bcM. [18] [19] [20] We have investigated, in vitro, the potential of combining bezafibrate and medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) against CLL, acute myeloid leukemia and Burkitt's lymphoma, 15, 21, 22 and also conducted a phase II clinical study of the combination (bezafibrate + MPA) in acute myeloid leukemia. 23 This phase II study showed that the combination was of clinical benefit and did not have associated hematologic or systemic toxicities. 23 These findings indicated the potential benefit of exploiting such therapy in CLL patients, especially those who are frail and not able to endure more toxic regimens. However, although we demonstrated that bezafibrate + MPA could induce apoptosis of non-CD40L-stimulated CLL cells and reduce their CD40L-induced proliferation, 15 we did not observe that combined bezafibrate + MPA provoked apoptosis in CD40L-protected cells. The lack of apoptosis in the presence of CD40L was associated with protection against bezafibrate + MPA-induced mitochondrial superoxide production. In this study we examined whether the addition of a third agent could overcome the protective signal provided by CD40L and lead to the restoration of mitochondrial superoxide accumulation and the successful apoptosis of CLL cells within this environment.",

These include PEP005, derived from Euphorbia peplus, in the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia, 25 jasmonates, plant hormones found in all plants, in acute myeloid leukemia, CLL and B-cell lymphoma, [26] [27] [28] [29] and pancratistatin and lycorine from the Amaryllidaceae family in acute myeloid leukemia and acute promyelocytic leukemia. [30] [31] [32] Lycorine is the most abundant of all the Amaryllidaceae alkaloids and has wide ranging biological activities. Studies this century have indicated that lycorine interferes with replication of the polio, small pox and SARS viruses, [33] [34] [35] [36] has anti-fungal activities 37 and is anti-parasitic, including against malaria. 38 In the last decade research has focused on the potential use of this compound to treat cells resistant to apoptotic stimuli, 39 including leukemic cells. 24, [30] [31] [32] 36 In vitro studies in such settings have shown that lycorine can induce apoptosis, specifically targeted against malignant cells. 31 Its potential use as a therapeutic agent has recently led to studies into the production of the synthetic compound, 40, 41 highlighting it as a potential lead for drug development. 24, 42 In this study we investigated the potential of combining lycorine with bezafibrate + MPA to elicit an apoptotic response in the presence of CD40L and assessed the correlation between induced apoptosis and the generation of mitochondrial superoxide. We compared our findings of those of Hallaert et al. and looked at the importance of the continual provision of CD40L to truly mimic the lymph node environment.",

However, using this methodology bezafibrate + MPA also induced apoptosis and to a similar level as dasatinib + fludarabine (P=0.51). In contrast, and as we described previously, 15 can, therefore, only induce CLL cell apoptosis following release from CD40L protection, as is also seen with bezafibrate + MPA. These data indicate that the dasatinib + fludarabine combination represents no advantage over bezafibrate + MPA and further indicate that dasatinib does not overcome the previously suggested protection of CLL cells against fludarabine by CD40L.",

Following recent publications on the use of lycorine in causing apoptosis of acute promyelocytic leukemia and acute myeloid leukemia cell lines, 30, 36, 45 we investigated whether this agent has potential in CLL. A dose titration of lycorine, starting at the highest dose shown to be effective against HL-60 and K562 cells by Lui et al., 32 was conducted in CLL samples, from six patients, in the presence of CD40L. None of the doses tested induced significant apoptosis in primary CLL cells (P=0.1 for all treatments) ( Figure 2B ). However, the addition of lycorine to bezafibrate + MPA proved to be effective at inducing the death of CLL cells even when continuously exposed to CD40L (Figure 2A and B) . Even the lowest dose tested (0.6 \u03bcM) combined with bezafibrate + MPA potentiated apoptosis (36%) compared to that of cells treated with bezafibrate + MPA alone (P=0.017). The pro-apoptotic effect of bezafibrate + MPA + lycorine reached a plateau at doses of lycorine above 1.25 \u03bcM, with no significant increases in the level of apoptosis (P\u00a30.1 for all higher doses tested).",

In contrast, the survival of bezafibrate + MPA-treated cells in the presence of CD40L was associated with the induction of reactive oxygen species but not mitochondrial superoxide. We argued that CD40L protects against bezafibrate + MPA-induced apoptosis by protecting against or countering mitochondrial superoxide production. We tested whether the capacity of lycorine to potentiate the ability of bezafibrate + MPA to induce apoptosis in cells exposed to CD40L was associated with the restoration of the mitochondrial superoxide response at 48 h. Consistent with the lack of cell death induced by lycorine alone, by itself this agent did not induce mitochondrial superoxide production (P\u00a30.1 for all) ( Figure 3A and B) . A small increase in mitochondrial superoxide was observed in response to 10 \u03bcM lycorine; however, even at this dose, the amount of mitochondrial superoxide produced was no more than that produced by bezafibrate + MPA alone ( Figure 3A and B) . In contrast, the combination of bezafibrate + MPA + lycorine induced substantial, lycorine-dose-dependent increases in mitochondrial superoxide, with bezafibrate + MPA + 1.25 \u03bcM lycorine producing the highest level of mitochondrial superoxide (P=0.004) ( Figure 3B) . Importantly, the lycorine-mitochondrial superoxide dose-response mirrored the induction of apoptosis as measured by annexin V staining and cell viability ( Figures 2B, 3C and 3D ). Direct comparison of total mitochondrial superoxide against viable events ( Figure 4A ) and annexin V staining against mitochondrial superoxide ( Figure 4B ) further demonstrated that an increase in mitochondrial superoxide was R.E. Hayden et al. 1892 haematologica | 2010; 95(11) directly associated with the loss of viability and apoptosis. These data on two measures of apoptosis compared with mitochondrial superoxide production indicate that the apoptosis caused by the combination of bezafibrate + MPA + lycorine is likely to be due to restored accumulation of mitochondrial superoxide within the treated cells. Previous studies demonstrated that transcription of the mitochondrial superoxide antioxidant manganese superoxide dismutase is up-regulated in cells exposed to tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1. 46 As CD40 and its ligand are members of the tumor necrosis factor family, we hypothesized that CLL cells exposed to CD40L may also up-regulate manganese superoxide dismutase and, thereby, overcome the pro-apoptotic effects exerted by bezafibrate + MPA. Alternatively, bezafibrate + MPA may induce apoptosis in the absence of CD40L by down-regulating manganese superoxide dismutase and this action may be counteracted by CD40L; according to this hypothesis, lycorine, in the presence of CD40L, would reverse this down-regulation. However western blot analysis of protein expression revealed that CD40L did not up-regulate manganese superoxide dismutase ( Figure 4C ). Further, neither in the absence nor in the presence of CD40L was bezafibrate + MPA, lycorine or the combination able to induce downregulation of this protein ( Figure 4C ).",

Migration of circulating CLL cells to lymph nodes provides the cells with survival signals from CD40L, causing the development of pro-survival niches that are widely believed to be the source of therapy resistance and relapse. 17, 47 Chemoresistance has been reported in CLL cells that have been exposed to CD40L 13, 14 and Vogler et al. recently demonstrated that CLL cells exposed to CD40L have 1000-fold increased resistance to the novel therapeutic ABT-737. 16 It appears, therefore, that CD40L can protect CLL cells against a variety of potential treatments. Thus it could be speculated that CLL cells effectively 'seek cover' from anti-neoplastic therapy by exploiting CD40L within the lymph nodes. We have recently shown that bezafibrate + MPA can induce apoptosis of circulating CLL cells, while significantly reducing the proliferative capabilities of CLL cells when engaged with CD40L. 15 However, the lack of apoptosis within an environment mimicking the lymph node led to our search for a third agent to combine with bezafibrate + MPA with the aim of exerting apoptosis both in the absence and presence of CD40L. The recent study by Hallaert et al. identified the possibility of using dasatinib as an agent to sensitize CLL cells to other therapies. 17 Furthermore, in this scenario, the actions of combined dasatinib + fludarabine were no greater than those of bezafibrate + MPA. However, lycorine was able to sensitize CLL cells to bezafibrate + MPA-induced apoptosis in the continuous presence of CD40L. Furthermore, the ability to do so was associated with restored accumulation of mitochondrial superoxide in response to bezafibrate + MPA. This would indicate that either lycorine reinstates the capacity of bezafibrate + MPA to induce mitochondrial superoxide in CD40L-stimulated cells or interferes with the CD40Lmediated clearance of mitochondrial superoxide. This is the first study to show a correlation between the generation of mitochondrial superoxide and cell death in CLL.",

Nonetheless, the possibility that lycorine exerts its effects via mitochondrial mechanisms is supported by studies in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which have demonstrated that cells lacking mitochondrial DNA are resistant to lycorine. 50 Elderly CLL patients are commonly excluded from clinical trials because of their susceptibility to the development of cytopenia and infections and in younger patients there is an inevitable development of chemoresistance to conventional agents. Thus more targeted therapies are urgently required.

            "text": "Currently, many plant compounds are being investigated with the intention of gaining FDA approval for their therapeutic use. Recently, the prescription drug Reminyl was approved for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. The active ingredient of this compound is the alkaloid galanthamine isolated from another member of the Amaryllidaceae family. 42, 51 Therefore a precedent has been set for the use of this group of agents in the treatment of diseases. Lycorine has been identified as a novel lead for anticancer drug design 24, 39 and Jones et al. have published the first successful study of the synthesis of the framework of one of lycorine's sister compounds. 40 Thus, the concept of lycorine ultimately being synthesized successfully and gaining FDA approval for therapeutic use is a real possibility. Nonetheless the time scale and cost of developing new drugs are limiting and in addition the in vivo toxicity of lycorine is as yet unknown and will have to be determined prior to possible trials in combination with bezafibrate + MPA.",

            "text": "In conclusion, our studies continue to indicate bezafibrate + MPA as potential therapies for CLL. Importantly this study provides the proof of principle that strategies using bezafibrate + MPA can be developed with the potential to target cells both in the periphery and in the protective lymph node environment and demonstrates that the generation of mitochondrial superoxide is critical for apoptosis. It remains possible that other already available drugs could also target the cells within the lymph node as effectively as lycorine. Unfortunately, these do not appear to include dasatinib but screens of other agents could yield promising results. Our data would suggest that agents targeting mitochondria may be strong candidates. We, therefore, propose that rational drug screening for a third agent should be based on the generation of mitochondrial superoxide as measured by MitoSox. If a suitable agent could be found this would be the most expedient way to develop the regime as a clinically viable treatment.",
