Clinical disease results from dysregulation of the mucosal immune response. The umbrella term IBD used in ferrets and other small animals for a variety of gastrointestinal diseases is not the same disease that is seen in humans. Clinical signs, origin, endoscopic features, and histopathologic features are very different from those seen in humans. Continued use of the term IBD for these diseases in small animals is a source of frustration and confusion to clinicians and pathologists alike.",
