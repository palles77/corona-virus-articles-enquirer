Even among the MAbs that have been shown to recognize the same antigenic site, IgG 2a MAbs enhanced FIPV infection strongly, whereas IgG 1 MAbs did not. These IgG 2a MAbs enhanced the infection even when macrophages pretreated with the MAb were washed and then inoculated with the virus. Immunofluorescence flow cytometric analysis of the macrophages treated with each of the MAbs showed that the IgG 2a MAbs but not the IgG 1 MAbs bound to feline alveolar macrophages. Treatment of the IgG 2a MAb with protein A decreased the binding to the macrophages and, in parallel, diminished the ADE activity. Although no infection was observed by inoculation of FIPV to human monocyte cell line U937 cells, FIPV complexed with either the IgG 2a MAb or the IgG 1 MAb caused infection in U937 cells which are shown to express Fc gamma receptor (Fc 7 R) I and II that can bind mouse IgG 2a and IgG 1, respectively. These results suggest that the enhancing activity of MAb is closely correlated with IgG subclass and that the correlation is involved in binding of MAb to Fc 7 R on feline macrophage.",

            "text": "Feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) is a member of the coronavirus family and causes a chronic progressive disease in its natural host. The natural route of FIPV infection is unknown although cats can be experimentally infected by oral, nasal, and parenteral administration of FIPV. Following infection by these routes, FIPV first multiplies in the epithelial cells of the upper respiratory tract and intestine [30] . Clinically apparent FIP occurs after the viruses in infected 274 T. Hohdatsu et al. macrophages and monocytes cross the mucosal barrier and spread throughout the body of the cat. Generally, macrophages play an important role in non-specific defense against viral infection. However, it is also known that viruses bound to antibodies invade macrophages via Fc region of the bound antibody and the macrophage's Fc gamma receptor (Fc 7 R) and eventually lead to enhancement of infection [4, 7-10, 14, 26, 27, 31] . Its most typical example is a disease called dengue hemorrhagic fever/dengue shock syndrome. The antibody for FIPV is also known to enhance the FIPV infection and accelerate the disease onset in cats [22, 23, 34] . Following experimental FIPV infection, cats with naturally occurring FIPV-neutralizing antibody frequently develop FIP more rapidly and with more severe clinical signs than do seronegative cats. When cats passively immunized with anti-FIPV antibodies were infected with virulent FIPV, severe symptoms were observed and some of them died soon after the infection [22, 34] . The enhancing effect of the antibody of FIPV infection impedes prophylaxis of FIP by vaccination [2, 21, 23-25, 29, 35] .",

This antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) was completely eliminated or reduced by pretreatment of the MAbs with Protein A or when F(ab')2 fragments of the MAbs were used. Olsen et al. have supported our findings by showing enhancement of FIPV infection in primary feline peritoneal macrophages by mouse MAbs to the viral S protein [20] . In many instances virus-neutralizing MAbs were shown to have strong ADE activity, and it was suggested that there was some relationship between neutralizing activity and ADE activity. On the other hand, Corapi et al. recognized a difference in immunoglobulin subclasses between ADE-inducing FIPV-neutralizing MAb and ADE-non inducing FIPV-neutralizing MAb, and they showed that the majority of the ADE-inducing MAbs belong to the IgG 2a subclass [5] . These results were obtained by the experiments in which mouse MAbs and feline macrophages, i.e., xenogeneic combination of MAbs and macrophages, were used. In contrast, it has been reported that mouse MAbs irrespective of whether the subclass is IgG 1, IgG 2a or IgG 2b enhanced infection of mouse (homologous) macrophages of dengue virus [10, 17] , influenza A virus [18\"] and West Nile virus [3] .",

Some studies showed that MAbs having virus neutralizing activity caused intense A D E of F I P V infection, and suggested that epitope of F I P V to be recognized for A D E is closely related to that for virus neutralization [5, 12, 13, 19, 20-I. In the present study, it was d e m o n s t r a t e d that even a m o n g mouse F I P V neutralizing MAbs that have been shown to recognize the same antigenic site by competitive binding assay, IgG 2a M A b s but not IgG 1 M A b s enhanced F I P V infection of feline alveolar m a c r o p h a g e s (Fig. 1) . These IgG 2a MAbs enhanced the infection even when macrophages pretreated with the MAb were washed and then inoculated with the virus (Fig. 2) . Therefore we assumed that mouse IgG 2a antibodies can bind Fc ? R on feline alveolar macrophages, whereas IgG 1 antibodies can not. This was confirmed by the flow cytometric analysis of binding of the MAbs to feline macrophages (Fig. 3 ). In addition, it was found that the IgG 2a MAbs complexed with FIPV bound to macrophages more intensely than the MAb alone did (Figs. 3A and B ). In accordance with these findings, ADE of the FIPV infection was intenser in the macrophages infected by the former pathway than in the virus-inoculated latter macrophages ( Figs. 1 and 2) . Flow cytometric analysis of the binding of protein A-treated IgG 2a MAb to macrophages and determination of ADE of FIPV infection by the treated MAb revealed that the binding of the mouse IgG 2a MAbs to feline macrophages and their ADE activity on FIPV infection of the macrophages are mediated by Fc region of the MAbs (Fig. 4) .",

It has also been shown that Fc 7 R I and II are present on human macrophages and that mouse IgG 2a and IgG 1 bind well to the Fc ? R I and II, respectively.

FIPV strain 79-1146 did not infect U937 cells at all. However, when the FIPV complexed with either one of the mouse anti-FIPV MAbs was inoculated onto U937 cells, distinct viral proliferation was observed. Notably, IgG 1 MAbs, which did not bind to feline macrophages and did not cause ADE of FIPV infection of feline macrophages, caused viral proliferation in U937 cells. These results suggest that U937 cells of human origin have no virus receptor for FIPV, but Fc ?

Reason for the discrepancy between these studies and our study, in which mouse anti-FIPV IgG 1 MAbs were not found to show ADE of FIPV infection of feline macrophages, is not clear. There are the following possibilities: Fc y R for mouse IgG 1 is expressed on feline macrophages in very small number, or Fc y R for mouse IgG 1 on feline macrophages has very low affinity. In relation to the latter possibility, U937 cells of human origin express Fc y R I and II at a similar level, but ADE activity of mouse anti-FIPV IgG 1 MAb on FIPV infection of these cells was found to be far weaker than that of anti-FIPV IgG 2a MAb. It is also known that human IgG 2 and IgG 4 have weak affinity for Fc y R on human macrophages [32] . One study of ADE of dengue virus infection of mouse macrophages has shown that treatment of macrophages with neuraminidase increased affinity of their Fc 7 R II for mouse IgG 1 MAb and resulted in increased ADE of the infection by mouse anti-dengue virus IgG 1 MAb [16] .

This is supported by finding that any FIPV-neutralizing MAbs could not enhance FIPV infection of Crandell feline kidney cells which are devoid of Fc R. The present study, however, explored ADE of FIPV infection by in vitro experiments in which xenogeneic combination of virus targets and anti-FIPV antibody, i.e., feline alveolar macrophages or human monocyte U937 cells and mouse anti-FIPV S protein MAbs, was used. Therefore, the findings in the present study could not be applied directly to ADE of natural infection in cats. Schultz et al. [28] reported two subclasses of feline IgG. However, biological properties of feline IgG subclasses have not yet been clarified. Further study of the feline IgG subclasses and exploration of Fc 7 R on feline cells are mandatory, and what IgG subclass of anti-FIPV antibody in the serum of naturally infected cats enhances the FIPV infection should be investigated. These studies are worthwhile for determination of basic pathogenesis of FIP and development of vaccines for prevention of FIPV infection.",
