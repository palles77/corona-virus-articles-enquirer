[4] [5] As of February 25, 2020, more than 80,000 confirmed cases and a total of 2700 deaths have been identified globally. 6 As the epidemic spreads to many countries, COVID-19 poses a severe threat to global health. In the early stage of the epidemic, the most common clinical characteristics of patients with COVID-19 at the onset of illness manifested as fever, cough, and myalgia or fatigue, with or without sputum production and diarrhea. 7 Therefore, detecting and confirming infected cases in a timely manner and applying scientific treatment as soon as possible is extremely essential to reduce the mortality of COVID-19. Since the emergence of 3 th and even 4 rd -generation transmission 4 and signs of asymptomatic carrier transmission of COVID-19, 8 the prevention and control of COVID-19 has entered a new period. Consequently, it is urgent to carefully observe the changes in patients' initial symptoms. As the designated hospital for patients with severe infection, we have been receiving COVID-19 patients in the newly opened unit since January 16. After the government announced a state of emergency and closed access to Wuhan city on January 23, the number of suspected patients who came to our unit increased rapidly. As of January 29, we received 89 patients confirmed with COVID-19. Surprisingly, during the consultation, we found that the clinical characteristics of patients admitted after January 23 began to differ from those of patients admitted before, which brings new challenges for the diagnosis of suspected patients. To prevent and control the epidemic scientifically, this study aimed to describe the clinical and laboratory characteristics of COVID-19 patients from the perspective of clinical doctors and to compare the initial clinical features between patients infected in different periods.",

Research and clinical findings seem to suggest that SARS-CoV-2 may be colonized in the nasopharynx but has failed to be recognized in the early stage. As a result, SARS-CoV-2 could hardly be removed by self-cleaning responses such as sneeze and runny and could not be cleared immediately by the local immune system; thus, the initial symptoms of COVID-19 are insidious. Our previous study also indicated that clinical symptoms of COVID-19 deviate from the CT results, and the outcome follows the clinical features. 15 This further illustrates the critical need to correctly identify the symptoms of COVID-19 at admission.

Reduced CD3 and CD8 T cells counts in the context of excessive activation of these cells have been shown to contribute to the severity and mortality of COVID-19 by causing severe immune damage. 16 The contrasting elevated SAA also reflects the infection levels of patients in various periods. Overall, changes in symptoms and laboratory results at admission reflect that SARS-CoV-2 may be undergoing a certain degree of modification, and infection in patients seems to be more insidious. Therefore, we propose that it may be of great significance in guiding the diagnosis and prevention of COVID-19 in the future if respiratory samples, especially lower respiratory samples, could be collected to detect the content of ACE2 and SARS-CoV-2 in patients infected at different periods.",

One of them was the first confirmed medical staff in our hospital, and this patient has been isolated for more than 20 days after reaching the discharge standard; the remaining 2 patients were isolated 14 days after discharge. These data indicate that the current knowledge of COVID-19 is still insufficient. As the generations of transmissions increase, the clinical manifestations of patients with COVID-19 are changing.
