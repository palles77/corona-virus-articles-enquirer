            "text": "Neonatal diarrhea is one of the most important syndromes in dairy cattle. Among enteropathogens, Cryptosporidium spp. are primary causes of diarrhea, but outbreaks due to cryptosporidiosis are rarely reported in cattle. From January to April in 2016, severe diarrhea was observed in over 400 neonatal dairy calves on a large dairy farm in Jiangsu Province of East China. Approximately 360 calves died due to watery diarrhea despite antibiotic therapy. In this study, 18 fecal specimens were collected from seriously ill calves on this farm during the diarrhea outbreak, and analysed for common enteropathogens by enzymatic immunoassay (EIA). In a post-outbreak investigation, 418 and 1372 specimens collected from animals of various age groups were further analysed for rotavirus and Cryptosporidium spp. by EIA and PCR, respectively, to assess their roles in the occurrence of diarrhea on the farm. Cryptosporidium spp. were genotyped using established techniques. Initial EIA tests showed that 15/18 seriously ill calves during the outbreak were positive for Cryptosporidium parvum, while 8/18 were positive for rotavirus. The overall infection rate of Cryptosporidium in pre-weaned calves on the farm was 22.7%, with odds of the Cryptosporidium infection during the outbreak 4.4-23.5 times higher than after the outbreak. Four Cryptosporidium spp. were identified after the outbreak including C. parvum (n = 79), Cryptosporidium ryanae (n = 48), Cryptosporidium bovis (n = 31), and Cryptosporidium andersoni (n = 3), with co-infections of multiple species being detected in 34 animals. Infection with C. parvum (73/79) was found in the majority of calves aged 3 weeks, consistent with the age of ill calves during the outbreak. All C. parvum isolates were identified as subtype IIdA19G1. In the post-outbreak investigation, C. parvum infection was associated with the occurrence of watery diarrhea in pre-weaned calves, C. ryanae infection was associated with moderate diarrhea in both pre-and post-weaned calves, while no association was identified between rotavirus infection and the occurrence of diarrhea. Results of logistic regression analysis further suggested that C. bovis infection might also be a risk factor for moderate diarrhea in calves. Thus, we believe this is the first report of a major outbreak of severe diarrhea caused by C. parvum IIdA19G1 in dairy calves. More attention should be directed toward preventing the dissemination of this virulent subtype in China.",

This was largely based on results of the initial EIA test, which identified the presence of C. parvum and rotavirus in the 18 seriously ill calves examined during the outbreak. Two other common enteropathogens for neonatal calf diarrhea, coronavirus and E. coli K99, were ruled out as the cause of the diarrhea. The role of rotavirus in the occurrence of the diarrhea outbreak appears to be small, as only fewer than half of the seriously ill calves had the infection and rotavirus infection was not significantly associated with the occurrence of moderate or watery diarrhea in calves during post-outbreak investigation. This was further supported by the peak occurrence of rotavirus infection in calves at 1 week of age, which is slightly earlier than the age range (10-20 days) of ill calves during the outbreak. The identification of cryptosporidiosis as the cause of the diarrhea outbreak was substantiated by genotyping of Cryptosporidium spp. in calves. All Cryptosporidiumpositive ill calves had C. parvum instead of C. bovis, which is the Table 4 Association between Cryptosporidium spp. and occurrence of diarrhea in dairy calves after a diarrhea outbreak on a farm in Jiangsu, China, as indicated by results of univariate and multivariate analyses. dominant Cryptosporidium sp. in pre-weaned calves in China but mostly avirulent . In addition, the occurrence of C. parvum in pre-weaned calves was significantly higher during the outbreak than after the outbreak (OR = 5.7-129.6), and C. parvum infection was associated with the occurrence of watery diarrhea in pre-weaned calves in a post-outbreak investigation. Nevertheless, rotavirus could have played a secondary role in the outbreak of watery diarrhea in pre-weaned dairy calves on the farm, as suggested by investigations of outbreaks of calf diarrhea in Australia and India (Izzo et al., 2011; Brar et al., 2017) . In this study, pathological investigations were not conducted on dead calves due to the distant nature of the farm from research facilities. We became involved with the investigation when the outbreak was nearing the end, and the fecal specimens from the 18 seriously ill calves were received by express mail. Compared with numerous reports of cryptosporidiosis outbreaks in humans, only a limited number of outbreaks have been documented in dairy calves (Reynolds et al., 1986; Aurich et al., 1990; Xiao et al., 1993) . In these earlier studies, the detection of Cryptosporidium infections was based on microscopy or an EIA test. Although the species involved was unknown, it was reasonable to assume that these outbreaks were caused by C. parvum, which is well known to cause watery diarrhea (Meganck et al., 2014) . In one recent study in Estonia, however, the C. parvum subtype IIaA18G1R1 was identified as the cause of a cryptosporidiosis outbreak in pre-weaned dairy calves (Niine et al., 2018) . Similarly in China, the only reported bovine cryptosporidiosis outbreak was caused by the C. parvum subtype IIdA15G1 (Cui et al., 2014) . That outbreak occurred on a dairy farm in Ningxia, northwestern China, leading to the death of 356 calves. Unlike the finding in Ningxia, the bovine cryptosporidiosis outbreak reported in the present study was caused by the C. parvum subtype IIdA19G1. Although C. parvum is still an emerging Cryptosporidium sp. in dairy cattle in China, IIdA15G1 and IIdA19G1 subtypes are dominant C. parvum subtypes in pre-weaned dairy calves Wang et al., 2017) .",

The overall infection rate of Cryptosporidium spp. was 14.2%, which is similar to the average prevalence rate (14.0%) in dairy cattle in China . As in most previous studies in China and elsewhere (Fayer et al., 2010; Venu et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2017) , declining infection rates with increased age was also observed in the present study, with the infection rate in pre-weaned calves (22.7%) significantly higher than those in post-weaned calves (8.4%) and adult cattle (1.0%). Among the four Cryptosporidium spp. identified on the farm in the present study, C. parvum was the most frequently detected species in pre-weaned calves, C. ryanae and C. bovis were dominant in post-weaned calves, whereas C. andersoni was only identified in three older animals. This is largely in agreement with the age-related distribution of Cryptosporidium spp. in dairy cattle elsewhere in the world (Xiao, 2010) . However, as in some locations of China (Cai et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2017) , C. bovis and C. ryanae were also common in pre-weaned dairy cattle. In fact, C. ryanae was not only the most common species identified in post-weaned calves, but also more prevalent than C. bovis in pre-weaned calves in the present study. Due to the high infection rates of both C. bovis and C. ryanae, a high rate of co-infections with the two Cryptosporidium spp. was also observed in this study.",

This serves as new evidence of the virulence of this emerging subtype in the country. In addition, C. ryanae and C. bovis have been shown as potential causes for moderate diarrhea in dairy calves. The emerging nature of C. parvum in farm animals in China, the high mortality in this outbreak, and a lack of effective treatment for cryptosporidiosis highlight the need to develop control measures against the transmission of C. parvum on dairy farms.",
