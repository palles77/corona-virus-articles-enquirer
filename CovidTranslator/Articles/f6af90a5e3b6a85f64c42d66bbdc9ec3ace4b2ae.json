Diagnosis of &&sia caba& infections in horses by enzymelinked immunosorbent assay (ELBA) and Western blot. inrernntionalJaurnulfnr Parasitology 24: 341-346. From Bubesia cabal/i in vitro cultures a preparation of 100% infected erythrocytes was obtained. From this, B. cabutli antigens were extracted with the detergent 3-[(3-CholamidopropyI)-dimethylammonio]-lpropane-sulfonate (CHAPS) and used as ELISA antigens. A control antigen of normal erythrocytes from the same donor horse was prepared in an identical manner. The ELBA and Western blot were validated by testing of sera from horses experimentally infected with B. caballi or B. equi or not infected with Babesia spp. ELISA and Western blot results were compared with those obtained by the immunofluorescence antibody test (IFAT) and complement fixation test (CFT). The sensitivity of the ELISA of98.3% obtained for sera from day 14 after infection was superior to the Western blot (94.9%), the IFAT (96.6%) and the CFT (28.8%). No positive results were obtained in the ELISA and Western blot with 106 sera from horses not infected with &b&a spp. resulting in a calculated specificity of 100% for both tests.

The validity of these results was confirmed by testing of sera by Western blot. The ELBA as the most sensitive test provides the best method for the identifi~tion of carrier horses to prevent the introduction into non-endemic areas (export testing).

They are the causative agents of equine babesioses which are endemic in most tropical and subtropical areas of the world (Friedhoff, 1982; Friedhoff, Tenter & Miller, 1990) . Whereas 8. cabalii only invades erythrocytes B. equi is also capable of infecting lymphocytes (Schein, Rehbein, Voigt & Zweygarth, 1981) . Both parasites are transmitted by tick vectors with almost worldwide distribution (Fricdhoff, 1982) . Consequently, it is important to prevent the introduction of carrier animals into nonendemic areas, particuiariy where the diseases could be spread by vector ticks. Horses to be exported into the U.S.A., Japan, Australia or other countries have to be tested negative for babesioses by the camplement fixation test (CFT) or the immunofluores&en~ antibody test (IFAT) . The CFT yiefds a considerable number of false-negative results (Weiland, 1985;  Tenter L Friedhoff, 1986 ). The IFAT is laborious and not amenable to standardization. Thus, there is a need for improved serological tests for the diagnosis of equine babesioses. A first step was made by deveioping a Western blot for the diagnosis of B. cab& infections. This test can be used in case of contradicting CFT and IFAT results and provides a speciesspecific diagnosis (Base & Daemen, 1992) . For routine diagnosis, however, the test is too laborious. In general, the advantages of the ELISA in contrast to CFT or IFAT are its high sensitivity and the possibility of standardization and computer evaluation. We here report the development of a sensitive ELISA and the application of the Western blot for the diagnosis of B. caballi infections.",

The absorbance values were measured approx. 2, 4 and 6 min after substrate addition with an ELISA reader (Titertek Multiskan plus MK II, Flow Laboratories, Meckenheim, Germany) interfaced with an IBM compatible personal computer. The computer based kinetics linked immunosorbent assay (KELA) programme was used to calculate slope values as the relationship between the rate of substrate conversion by enzyme and time (Jacobson, Downing & Lynch, 1982; Barlough, Jacobson, Downing, Marcella, Lynch & Scott, 1983 : Bose, Jacobson, Gale, Walt~sbuhl & Wright, 1990) . Further, the KELA programme was used to calculate 'delta values' by subtraction of the KELA slope values for control antigen from those for B. cuba& antigen. Data generated by the KELA programme provided a basis for maintaining quality control in the assays. The KELA programme included assessment of the: (1) linearity of the reaction rate (OD vs time) in each well of the microtitre plate to ascertain whether the enzyme-substratechromogen reactants were performing properly, (2) mean, S.U. and coefficient of variation for the slopes of sample replicates to determine within-run variation, (3) degree of correlation of observed slopes for standard sera compared with their expected values by linear regression analysis and (4) normalization of mean slopes for each sample to the expected values for controls thus allowing direct comparison of results on a day-to-day basis. All of these data were generated automatically at the end of each run by the KELA programme and presented in printed reports for easy evafuation. The threshold was determined arbitrarily under ",

For B. bovis a simple method for the enrichment of infected erythrocytes by selective lysis of noninfected erythrocytes is available (Mahoney, 1967) and preparations of 100% infected erythrocytes have been used for the development of sensitive and specific ELISAs (Waltisbuhl, Goodger, Wright, Commins & Mahoney, 1987; B&e et al., 1990) . For B. caballi only small amounts of 100% infected erythrocytes can be obtained using Percoll gradients (Bhushan et al., 1991) . Attempts to develop an ELISA for B. cab&i with crude antigen made from blood with low parasitaemias have led to limited improvements in the sero diagnosis of B. cab& (Weiland, 1986) . In preliminary expts we used antigen with a percentage of parasitized erythrocytes (PPE) of 34% from in vitro cultures and found this preparation not suitable as antigen in the ELISA. Reactions with positive sera were low and a poor discrimination was obtained (data not shown). Only antigens extracted from a preparation of 100% infected erythrocytes were suitable as ELISA antigens.",

Background staining could not be reduced by the introduction of a blocking step after antigen coating without a loss of sensitivity. However, when different methods of antigen extraction (Fig. l) , different microtitre plates and different dilution buffers were tried simultaneously, conditions could be defined which reduced the background staining and improved the discrimination significantly. The reason for the high background staining caused by equine sera is not known. For B. bovis there is evidence, that serum components other than IgG are involved (Bose et al., 1990) . These serum components, possibly IgM by nature, are recognised by conventional conjugates and thus cause the background staining. For B. caballi we found that IgG itself is probably causing most of the background staining in the ELISA. Background staining was not reduced when an IgG Fc-specific conjugate was used, but was almost completely absent after equine sera were passed over a protein G affinity column (data not shown). It appears that immunoglobulins from horse sera exhibit a high tendency to adhere to the surface of polystyrene microtitre plates. Thus, to date the only practical solution for the problem is the use of an appropriate control antigen.",

Thus strong reactions with the 50 and 48 kDa antigens were also regarded positive. With these criteria applied no false positive reactions were obtained with B. equi sera. Most B. equi sera did not react with any of the 5 diagnostic antigens of B. cab& Some sera showed a faint reaction with the 50 and 48 kDa antigens which was clearly distinguishable from the strong reactions of B. caballi sera.
