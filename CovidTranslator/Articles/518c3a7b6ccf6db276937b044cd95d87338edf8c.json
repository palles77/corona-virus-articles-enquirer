As a consequence, a multitude of epidemiological data on infectious diseases in animal, plant and human communities has been collected to gain insights into the underlying biological and epidemiological processes. The SIR (susceptible-infectious-recovered) model and its variants (S-Exposed-IR, SIS, etc.) are the mathematical tools most commonly used in such analyses. This paper describes a software program for the statistical analysis of a single outbreak in a small population. Special focus is on the spatial spread between subpopulations arranged on a lattice. In veterinary or plant epidemiology such data arise from so-called transmission experiments, where one or more individuals in a controlled environment are inoculated with the infectious disease pathogen. Subsequently, the course of the epidemic is monitored through visual inspection, clinical testing and other methods. The aim ranges in veterinary epidemiology from quantifying disease transmission (Laevens et al., 1999; St\u00e4rk et al., 2000) to determining the effect of a vaccine (Dewulf et al., 2001; Meyns et al., 2004) .",

An important epidemiological quantity of an infectious disease is the basic reproduction ratio R 0 , i.e. the expected number of new infections generated by a single infectious individual in a large susceptible population. In a multitype setup with k groups this can be computed as the largest eigenvalue of the k \u00d7 k matrix containing the mean number of infectious contacts between all units (Andersson and Britton, 2000, Section 6.2) .

For example, the general multitype SEIR model (Andersson and Britton, 2000, Chapter 6 ) allows for more complicated neighbor dependencies: Letting ( ) be a k \u00d7 k matrix given as a function of the parameter vector , the transmission rates are given by (t) = ( )I( ij ) . Nearest neighborhood transmission as in (1) thus corresponds to ij = I (u i = u j ) + n I (u j \u2208 N(u j )) and hence = ( , n ). An alternative would be to let transmission from neighbors be a function of distance: ij = 1 exp(\u2212 2 dist(u i , u j )). Modifications of the Java code to handle the simulation and maximum likelihood estimation in such models should be feasible. However, obtaining MCMC estimates in case of missing data would require a substantial amount of work. The same comment applies if one wants to extend beyond the currently implemented waiting time distributions (gamma-distributed, exponential-distributed and constant).",
