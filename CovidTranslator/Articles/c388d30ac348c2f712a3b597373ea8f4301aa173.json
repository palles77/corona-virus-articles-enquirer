Interestingly, some of the changes are rather consistent with economic intuition.",

Instead of documenting the underlying pricing mechanism of license plates, we take the price of a plate as an equilibrium outcome that reflects its social value. We are interested in determining how significant the value of superstitions is. In addition, beyond looking at the value of superstitions from a static point of view, we look at it from a dynamic perspective. In particular, we ask whether the value would change across the different types of plates, different policy regimes, and different macroeconomic environments.",

            "text": "Two key features in our empirical analysis enable us to address these new and interesting questions. First, our data cover two distinct periods: before and after a major policy change in 2006, which is the introduction of an entirely different type of license plates. It provides us a unique opportunity to study the change in the value of superstitions in response to the policy change. We also link the data to the stock market index and examine whether the value of superstitions varies with the macroeconomic environment. Second, we estimate plates of different types separately, rather than jointly as in Woo and Kwok (1994) , and Woo et al. (2008) . In addition to being a strategy to disentangle the effect of superstitions from the effect of conspicuous consumption, a point discussed in Section 3.1, our estimation strategy allows us to ask how the value of superstitions changes across different types of plates, a question addressed in Section 4.2.1. It is important to note that although we use a different estimation strategy, our estimated coefficients are consistent with those in Woo and Kwok (1994) , and Woo et al. (2008) , suggesting that their qualitative results are robust. 3 Along the same line, Foster and Kokko (2008) presented a simple model in which the false causalities people develop survive over natural selection, therefore becoming superstitions. 4 For instance, Mr. Dilip Rangnekar and Miss Elizabeth Young from the Communications Department of Otis Elevator Company, the world's largest elevator manufacturer, confirmed to us on November 20, 2008 that roughly 80% of their elevators around the world do not have the 13th-floor button. Many accessories containing an evil eye are sold in Europe. Kramer and Block (2008) give more examples on superstition and marketing practices. 5 Woo and Kwok (1994) use the data of 1,520 license plates from 1989 to 1991, Chong and Du (2008) To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first in economics to study how the value of superstitions responds to policy changes, and how the changes per se square with economic intuition. It is also the first one to document that the value of superstitions may vary across different macroeconomic environments.",

There are companies bidding plates in auctions, aiming at trading them for profit. 14 Their valuations of a plate, therefore, depend on their estimates of its future price. These bidders' valuations have a common value component. This leads to the possibility of the winner's curse: the winning bidder is the most optimistic one who over-estimates the future price. 15 The common value component makes it non-trivial to map winning bids to social cost.

First, it avoids ambiguous interpretation of some estimated coefficients. 21 Second, estimating separately allows the discount of a ''4\" and the premium of an ''8\" to vary across plates with different digit. 22 As we will see in Section 4.2.1, the effect is not constant in general. Third, building on the two papers and yielding consistent results under different estimation specifications in our paper help strengthen the results in the two papers. Table 5 shows the main results of the regressions of different types of plates. In particular, we found that number ''8\" is associated with plates with significantly higher winning bids, while number ''4\" is associated with plates with significantly lower winning bids. Controlling for other factors, an ordinary 4-digit plate with one extra ''8\" was sold 63.5% higher on average, while an ordinary 4-digit plate with one extra ''4\" was sold 11% lower on average (both relative to the number ''7\").

If we do the same replacements in ordinary 3-digit plate, an ''8\" adds USD$1249 to the price, while a ''4\" reduces the price tag by USD$360. These numbers are significant even in real economic terms. 19 On page 474 of the article, the conditions are as follows: (i) no common value component, (ii) no asymmetric information among bidders about the marginal values of the observed product characteristics, (iii) no minimum bids or reserve prices, (iv) all bidders are ex ante symmetric, (v) all product characteristics are observable, and (vi) entry is exogenous and a dummy variable for the number of bidders is included in the regression. 20 In another specification (which are available upon request), we use year dummies only, but we include the month-end stock market index (i.e., the Hang Seng index) to proxy for the macro-economic variations. The results are very similar. 21 Estimating separately avoids the inherent difficulty of interpreting the estimated coefficients of the dummies that is possible in some but not all types of plates. For instance, in a joint estimation of plates of all digits, the interpretation of the estimated coefficient of the dummy for aabb (two pairs in parallel) is ambiguous. The dummy is equal to 1 if a 4-digit plate has this aabb pattern (e.g., JK 3344). However, it is equal to 0 if either a 4-digit plate does not have this pattern or it is impossible to have this pattern as the plate not 4-digit. Suppose the estimated coefficient is, say, 40%, then it is difficult to interpret it as a 40% increase in the selling price with this pattern, or the possibility of having this pattern, together with the fact that the plate does have this pattern, commands a 40% premium. 22 To be precise, Woo & Kwok (1994) , and Woo et al. (2008) alleviate this concern by using the share of a number in the plate instead of the count of the number in their specification, which instead impose a much milder restriction: that the effect of an increase in the share of a number on the price is constant across plates with different digits. 23 The amount of United States dollars are at 2005 price. We obtain similar results on special plates of all digits. In short, consistent with our hypothesis, an ''8\" does carry a significant premium, while a ''4\" does carry a significant discount. Our results on the numbers and the patterns are also consistent with those in Woo & Kwok (1994) , and Woo et al. (2008) , suggesting that their qualitative results continue to be robust under alternative econometric specifications and with data from a more extended period of time.",

How much in terms of her share of wealth would she be willing to pay for? The sooner she expects to die, the larger the share she is willing to give up. A year of good health weighs more in a shorter life. Analogously, one's willingness to pay to acquire an ''8\" (or to get rid of a ''4\") would increase across plates with fewer digits on average.

The sizes of the premium on an ''8\" and the discount on a ''4\" universally reduced after 2006 for all the 4-digit (including ordinary and special) and 3-digit ordinary plates. The results of the Wald tests on these three types of plates indicate that the estimated coefficients of a ''4\" and an ''8\" differ significantly before and after 2006, suggesting that the introduction of personalized plates may have changed the value people place on superstitions.

We therefore expect that the impact of the introduction of personalized plates on the value of superstitions is larger on ordinary 3-digit plates than on 4digit ordinary plates.

Second, consistent with the results in Section 4.2.1, an ''8\" commands a higher premium on a 3-digit plate than on a 4-digit plate. Similarly, a ''4\" is discounted more in a 3-digit plate than in a 4-digit plate. 32 Columns 3-6 of Table 9 check whether the results in Section 4.2.2 are robust. The estimates suggest that after the introduction of personalized plate in 2006, the discount of a ''4\" in both ordinary 3-digit and 4-digit plates drop. The premium on Note: Robust standard errors in brackets (clustered by date). -not applicable, no obs no observation. * p < 0:1. ** p < 0:05. *** p < 0:01. 26 The number ''16\" rhymes similarly to ''all the way\" (as an adverb); thus, ''168\" rhymes similarly to ''prosper all the way\". 27 Both ''861\" and ''681\" are not associated with any phrase that makes sense in Cantonese. However, ''186\", ''618\", and ''816\" are all variations, in terms of what they mean, of ''road to prosperity\". 28 Again, ''283\", ''382\", ''823\", and ''832\" do not rhyme similarly to any phrase that makes sense in Cantonese. 29 We rely on the seller's website as well as The Internet Archive (web.archive.org) to collect the data. We have contacted the seller to obtain more historical data and the transacted prices, but the seller refused to provide us with their transacted prices. 30 The eight days are June 2, 2002 , December 9, 2002 , August 5, 2003 , October 16, 2003 , February 20, 2004 , April 19, 2004 , August 5, 2004 , and August 25, 2009 Of the 16,290 listed prices we collected, surprisingly, 1.8% (or 289) of them are special plates. We deleted these plates because, as mentioned, it is by law not legal to transfer special plates. We therefore suspect that the prices involve not only the values of plates but also the service fees to help ''get around\" with the non-transferable rule. 32 In another specification, we successfully match 1,299 ordinary 4-digit plates and 1892 ordinary 3-digit plates with the auction data (i.e., 20% of the data).",

We continue to observe this in Table 9 . The change we look into is the premium on replacing a ''4\" with an ''8\" on a plate. On average, such number replacement adds 107.7% to the price of ordinary 3-digit plates before 2006 but only 52.6% after 2006, which is a percentage drop of 51.16%. The corresponding figures are 59.9% to the price of ordinary 4-digit plates before 2006 and 43.7% after 2006. The percentage drop was 27.05%.
