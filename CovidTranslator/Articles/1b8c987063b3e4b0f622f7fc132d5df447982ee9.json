            "text": "The above evidence supports the proposal that the poste.p.s.p. hyperpolarization is a voltage-activated response; it is induced when the e.p.s.p. sufficiently depolarizes the membrane, and it can thus 'contaminate' the e.p.s.p. response. The dependence of post-e.p.s.p. hyperpolarization on the amplitude of the e.p.s.p. further indicates that it is a true afterhyperpolarization rather than a separate, transmitter-induced p.s.p.; the relationship was seen whether the amplitude of the e.p.s.p. was varied by repetition of input (as in Fig. 1 ) or by strength of curarization. (When e.p.s.ps were more strongly suppressed by greater curarization, post-e.p.s.p. hyperpolarizations were also smaller or absent.) That the voltage-activated post-e.p.s.p. hyperpolarization is a function of the opening of M channels by the e.p.s.p. is indicated by (1) the similarity of the range of V min which both appear, and (2) blockade of both by muscarine, but not by TEA. The more than linear increase in post-e.p.s.p. hyperpolarization when the amplitude of the e.p.s.p. was increased ( Fig. 1 ) would be expected, as M channel conductances do show progressively greater increases with increasing depolarization of V min the range between -60 m V and -40 m V (ref. 1). Post-e.p.s.p. hyperpolarizations are of briefer duration and have smaller time constants than do those obtained for M-channel closure when a depolarized Vm is changed suddenly to a hyperpolarized holding level' , but this is also readily explainable: M channels that are increasingly opened as e.p.s.p. depolarization rises, would begin to close progressively during the slow, descending, repolarizing limb of the e.p.s.p. Thus, the duration and time constant solely of the post-e.p.s.p. hyperpolarization phase that survives after the end of e.p.s.p. depolarization would not reflect the total time of the whole process.",

At least two different pathogenic mechanisms have been proposed for these changes, a cytopathic viral infection of oligodendroglia cells with subsequent cell death, and a host immune reaction against virus and brain antigens. We now report the occurrence of ceO-mediated immune reactions against basic myelin proteins in the course of coronavirus infections in Lewis rats. Infection of rats with the murine coronavirus JHM leads to demyelinating encephalomyelitis developing several weeks to months post-infection3-7. Lymphocytes from these diseased Lewis rats can be restimulated with basic myelin protein (BMP) and adoptive transfer of these cells leads to lesions resembling those of experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE) in recipients, which can be accompanied by a mild clinical disease. This model demonstrates that a virus infection in CNS tissue is capable of initiating an autoimmune response which may be of pathogenic importance.",

Diseased animals revealed unsteadiness, ataxic gait, abnormal posturing of the limbs, hindleg paralysis or a complete paraplegia. Most of these animals recovered from SDE and only some rats died within a few days after onset of disease. The neuropathological changes consisted of demyelinated plaques which were distributed in thalamus, brain stem, cerebellum and spinal cord and were located predominantly in the white matter. Figure la shows such a plaque. Within the plaques, cell infiltrations which consisted mainly of macrophages (Fig. 1b, c }, were found. As documented by Fig. lc , axons were well preserved within the demyelinated area. Furthermore, perivascular cuffings were frequently observed in diseased rats (Fig. la ) . These cuffings were mainly found in the brain stem and spinal cord and were restricted to the space around the blood vessel (Virchow-Robins space, Fig. 1d ). The destruction of myelin around these infiltrations was usually not prominent. Conventional virus isolation procedures permitted isolation of infectious coronavirus Values summarize the counts per min (c.p.m.) and the stimulation indices (Sl) obtained from five SDE rats, five uninfected animals and four rats with EAE. Lymphoid cells from SDE rats were taken 2 days after onset of disease (2-3 weeks after infection). EAE animals were killed 2 weeks after BMP immunization. Immunization was carried out according to Richert et a/. 8 \u2022 From individual animals cells from spleen, thymus and peripheral blood were pooled. As lymphocytes from popliteal lymph nodes could only be obtained from EAE animals, this cell population was not included in the comparative study. Cells were cultured in 96-well microplates with RPMI 1640 supplemented by heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 2-mercaptoethanol, antibiotics and sodium carbonate, at a cell density of 1 x 10 6 per well for 72 h, with the addition of feeder cells (l x 10 5 mitomycin C-treated spleen cells). Before incubation, 1 )J.g per well of the required antigen was added. 1 JJ.Ci 3 H-thymidine was added to each well 24 h before collection and the stimulation indices were calculated and compared with those of cultures without antigen 8 . As a source of BMP, guinea pig spinal cords were extracted according to the method described previously 18 to obtain a potent antigen for the specific restimulation of sensitized lymphocytes. To exclude the presence of JHM virus in lymphocytes from SDE animals, lymphoid cell aliquots of the cell preparations used for stimulation experiments were processed for virus isolation before and after stimulation with BMP or concanavalin A.",

The data presented here indicate that in the course of coronavirus JHM infection of Lewis rats, lymphocytes were sensitized against BMP. Adoptive transfer of these lymphocytes after in vitro restimulation with BMP was followed by EAE-like lesions in recipient Lewis rats. Coronavirus replication in the CNS can therefore produce a similar effect to Freund's complete adjuvant plus BMP in EAE. It will be of great importance to understand how a virus infection triggers an immune response against neuroantigens. There are several possibilities. First, it is conceivable that JHM virus structural proteins which are formed in CNS cells contain antigenic sites which cross-react with myelin. An immune response against these proteins would therefore be directed against both virus proteins and myelin. Some evidence for such a mechanism has been obtained for measles virus infection in subacute sclerosing panencephalitis, in which antibodies to measles virus reacted with BMP 15 . However, cell-mediated immune reactions were not measured. Second, the infection of oligodendroglia cells by JHM virus may lead to membrane changes resulting in the development of immunogenic structures also recognized on uninfected cells thus inducing an autoimmune process. So far, this mechanism has been suggested for viruses which bud from cell mem-branes16. How coronaviruses are released from infected cells is unknown, but it is possible to detect viral antigens on the cell membrane. The role of these membrane-associated viral antigens in assembly or release is unknown. Third, coronavirus infection of oligodendroglia cells could lead to the release of myelin material which is immunogenic. The resulting series of events would then follow those of EAE. There has been some evidence that a persistent measles virus infection in hamsters supports the development of EAE when such animals are challenged with BMP in combination with Freund's complete adjuvants 17 \u2022 Whether the measles infection renders the CNS more vulnerable to immunological injury or immunopotentiates a cell-mediated immune response to myelin has not yet been elucidated.",

Virus nucleocapsids are present in the brain 1 ' 2 and the patient is in a state of hyperimmunization towards this agent. However, although all other structural polypeptides are recognized by the immune system, there is a markedly decreased antibody response towards virus matrix or membrane proteinM. Matrix protein has not been detected in brain cells 5 and infectious virus is not present. The absence of this virus structural polypeptide is thought to account for the apparent restriction in virus maturation both in vivo and in vitro. SSPE viruses can only rarely be rescued from brain tissue by co-cultivation or cell fusion techniques using tissue culture cell lines susceptible to measles virus infection 6 \u2022 Often this procedure falls to yie~d a lytic budding virus but produces instead a carrier cell line in which the agent is cell associated. These fines (known as SSPE cell lines) also do not contain matrix protein 7 ' 8 \u2022 However, the reason for this deficiency is unknown. We have therefore now examined an SSPE cell line which does not yield infectious virus in order to define this process further. We found that although messenger RNA for membrane protein was present, it was unable to form normal matrix protein in translation reactions.",
