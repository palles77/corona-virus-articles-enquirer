We have isolated and passaged the PDCoV strain OH-FD22 in an LLC porcine kidney (LLC-PK) cell line. Our study investigated the pathogenicity of the tissue-culture-grown PDCoV (TC-PDCoV) OH-FD22 at cell passages 5, 20 and 40 in LLC-PK cells, in eight 14-day-old gnotobiotic (Gn) pigs. Pigs (n = 3) were euthanized for pathologic examination at post-inoculation day (PID) 3, and the remainder were monitored for clinical signs, virus shedding, and serum antibody responses until PID 28. All inoculated pigs developed watery diarrhea and/or vomiting at PID 1-2 and shed the highest amount of viral RNA in feces at PID 3-5, accompanied by severe atrophic enteritis. They developed high titers of PDCoV-specific IgG/IgA and virus-neutralizing antibodies in serum at PID 23-24. Histologic lesions were limited to the villous epithelium of the jejunum and ileum at PID 3. Two inoculated pigs tested at PID 23-24 had small to moderate numbers of PDCoV antigen-positive cells in the intestinal lamina propria and mesenteric lymph nodes, but not in enterocytes. An analysis of full-length S and N genes of TC-and Gn-pig-passaged OH-FD22 revealed a high genetic stability in cell culture and pigs. TC-PDCoV OH-FD22 (cell passages 5, 20 and 40) was enteropathogenic, and the pathogenicity was similar to that of the original field virus. The TC-PDCoV OH-FD22 will be useful for further pathogenesis studies and for evaluating if higher-level cell-culture passaged virus becomes attenuated for vaccine development.",

Infected herds had clinical signs of acute watery diarrhea in sows and nursing pigs, but mortality was reported only in nursing pigs [4, 12, 25] . PDCoV disease was reportedly milder than that caused by porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) in seronegative herds [13, 17] . Molecular surveillance studies indicated that PDCoV coinfections are common, especially with rotavirus group C (Rota C) and PEDV [7, 20] . To date, outbreaks have been documented in more than 20 states in the United States and in Canada, China, South Korea, and Thailand [6, 8, 15, 23] . A report from Jiangxi Province, China, indicated that the prevalence of monoinfection by PDCoV was high (33.7 %), and coinfection by PDCoV and PEDV was 19.7 % in diarrheic pigs [23] .",

The Gn pigs were delivered aseptically by hysterectomy from specific-pathogen-free sows. Prior to inoculation, pigs were confirmed negative for the major swine enteric viruses by testing of fecal samples using RT-PCR. Six 14-day-old Gn pigs (n = 2 for each passage) were inoculated orally with TC-PDCoV OH-FD22 P5 (10.8 log 10 genomic equivalents [GE] per pig), P20 (10.2 log 10 GE per pig), and P40 (10.1 log 10 GE per pig). Two pigs of the same age were used as negative controls. Clinical signs were monitored at least twice daily [12] . For each virus passage group, one of the two pigs was euthanized for pathologic examination at 24-48 h after onset of clinical signs [12] . Large-intestinal contents (LIC) and small-intestinal contents (SIC) were collected and tested by qRT-PCR for PDCoV and by RT-PCR for other enteric viruses. The remaining pigs were monitored for longer-term clinical signs, fecal virus RNA shedding, and virus-specific serum antibodies until PID 28. Diarrhea was assessed by scoring fecal consistency as follows: 0 = solid; 1 = pasty; 2 = semi-liquid; 3 = liquid, with scores of 2 or more considered diarrheic [10] .",

The S genes of Gn-pig-passaged PDCoV OH-FD22 P5, P20 and P40 strains shared 99.8 % to 100 % nucleotide sequence identity, and they shared 99.7 % to 100 % nucleotide sequence identity with the original PDCoV OH-FD22 and TC-PDCoV OH-FD22 (P5, P11, P20 and P40). All of the PDCoV OH-FD22-related S genes shared 98.4 % to 100 % nucleotide sequence identity with other PDCoV strains available in GenBank (Fig. 3) . When comparing the TC-PDCoV OH-FD22 P5 strain with the original OH-FD22 strain, only one nucleotide change was found in the S gene at position 466 nt (nucleotides and amino acids are numbered according to the S gene of the PDCoV OH-FD22 sequence [GenBank accession no.

This was subsequently found in the following sequenced TC-PDCoV OH-FD22 passages (P20 and P40) [7] (Table 4 ). The TC-PDCoV OH-FD22 P11 (passage 11 in LLC-PK cells) and P20 had five nucleotide changes (at positions 430, 466, 1191, 2456, and 3331 nt) in the S gene when compared to the original OH-FD22 strain, which also resulted in amino acid changes [7] . In the current study, the S genes of TC-PDCoV OH-FD22 P40, pig-passaged OH-FD22 P20 and P40 had the same changes (Table 4) . When comparing the S gene of TC-PDCoV OH-FD22 P40 with the original virus and TC-PDCoV OH-FD22 (P5 and P20), one nucleotide change was found in the S gene at position 991 nt, which resulted in an aa change (Asn changed to Asp at position 331 aa). The Gn-pig passaged TC-PDCoV OH-FD22 P40 (DC225) had the same change in this position (Table 4 ). Only one nucleotide change was found in the S gene of pig-passaged PDCoV (OH-FD22 P20 [DC175] and OH-FD22 P40 [DC225]) when compared with the corresponding TC-PDCoV OH-FD22 P20 and P40 at position 2,842 nt of the S gene.

However, the following differences were identified: i) earlier onset of clinical signs and fecal virus shedding by PID 1 in original virus-inoculated pigs (Table 1) [12] ; ii) frequent detection (6/6; 100 %) of transient viremia (viral RNA) in serum in TC-PDCoV OH-FD22-inoculated pigs on PID 3, while no viremia was detected in the original virus-inoculated pigs at PID 3 and other time points (Table 1) [12] ; and iii) in addition to PDCoV antigen-positive enterocytes in the small and large intestines at the early stage of infection (Fig. 2B) , a few to moderate numbers of PDCoV-antigen-positive cells were also detected by IF in the intestinal lamina propria and mesenteric lymph nodes of the TC-PDCoV OH-FD22- Table 2 ). In this study, no attenuation of the TC-PDCoV OH-FD22 P40 strain (cell passage 40) in pigs was evident, since severe clinical disease and lesions were reproduced in the two inoculated Gn pigs. Further studies are needed to investigate if higher levels of cellculture passaged TC-PDCoV OH-FD22 are attenuated. In our study, 14-day-old Gn pigs inoculated with 10.1-10.8 log 10 GE (& 9 log 10 PFU per pig [7] ) of TC-PDCoV OH-FD22 P5, P20, and P40 all (6/6, 100 %) showed severe diarrhea and/or vomiting at PID 2, which coincided with the first detection of viral RNA in feces ( Fig. 1B and Table 1 ). Fecal PDCoV shedding titers peaked at PID 3 to 5 ( Fig. 1B and Table 1 ). Another study using conventional 5-day-old pigs and a cell-culture-adapted PDCoV USA/IL/ 2014 strain (passage 11) reported onset of mild diarrhea (soft feces) at PID 5 in five pigs that were orally inoculated with 3 9 10 4 TCID 50 of the virus, which was later than or coincided with the first detection of viral RNA in feces at PID 4 (3/5 pigs tested) or 5 (2/5 pigs tested) [4] . In another study of a cell-culture-grown PDCoV Michigan/8977/2014 strain and an Ohio wild-type field CVM1 strain using 10-day-old conventional or Gn pigs, moderate to severe diarrhea occurred in pigs orally inoculated with 10 6 genomic RNA copies or PFU/pig of each strain at PID 1-3. The Gn pigs inoculated with the CVM1 field strain exhibited more-severe clinical disease or histologic lesions compared to Gn or conventional pigs inoculated with the cell-culture-adapted Michigan/8977/2014 strain (cell passage 15) [17] . These discrepant observations may be due to: i) differences in the PDCoV strains used, inoculation doses, and cell passage level; ii) conventional vs. Gn pigs used and different ages of pigs used; and iii) selective pig euthanization that could influence fecal virus shedding titers in the remaining pigs at the later stages of infection. In our study, we detected PDCoV RNA in the feces of TC-PDCoV OH-FD22 P5 or P20-inoculated Gn pigs collected until PID 18-20, indicating prolonged fecal virus RNA shedding in PDCoV-infected pigs. However, a shorter duration of fecal viral RNA shedding by 3-5 days was noted in a TC-PDCoV OH-FD22 P40-inoculated pig that shed until PID 15 (Fig. 1B) . Since the pig exhibited moderate to severe clinical signs and gross and histologic lesions (intestinal villous atrophy) and high serum antibody titers to PDCoV, based on a single pig, it is unclear if the shorter duration of fecal RNA virus shedding is related to any reduced virulence of TC-PDCoV OH-FD22 P40. Higher passage levels of the TC-PDCoV OH-FD22 strain should be tested for attenuation in additional pigs in a future study. In addition, low PDCoV RNA titers were detected in sera collected in the acute stage from the TC-PDCoV OH-FD22 inoculated pigs at PID 3, which coincided with previous studies, showing frequent detection of Table 4 Nucleotide and amino acid changes in the S gene/protein of PDCoV OH-FD22 passaged in cell culture and in Gn pigs Posi\u019fon* Virus * nucleotides and amino acids are numbered according to the S gene of the PDCoV OH-FD22 sequence (GenBank accession no. KP995358) [7] ** nt, nucleotide; aa, amino acid # See reference [7] PDCoV RNA in serum collected at early stages of infection [4, 17] , although sera from the parental PDCoV OH-FD22inoculated pigs were PDCoV RNA negative at PIDs 3-7 [12] . In the previous study, the infectious titer of the wildtype PDCoV in the fecal sample was unknown because it does not grow in tissue culture. However, the viral RNA titer of the wild-type PDCoV OH-FD22 was determined by qRT-PCR. Three 14-day-old Gn pigs were inoculated orally with 8.8 log 10 GE of the virus [12] , which was approximately 2 log 10 GE lower than that of the inoculum of TC-PDCoV OH-FD22 used in the current study. Based on titer differences in the virus inocula, we speculate that the lower titer of the inoculation dose might be an explanation for lack of detection of viremia (viral RNA) in the wild-type PDCoV OH-FD22 inoculated pigs.",

At the early stage of infection (PID 3), the majority of PDCoV antigen-positive cells were in intestinal villous epithelial cells in jejunum and ileum. A few macrophage-like cells located in the lamina propria and Peyer's patches of the jejunum and ileum were also positive for PDCoV antigen by IF. In contrast, after recovery at PID 23-24, when no fecal virus RNA shedding or clinical disease was detected, moderate to large numbers of PDCoVantigen-positive cells were found by IF in the intestinal lamina propria, Peyer's patches and mesenteric lymph nodes, in what appeared to be macrophage-like cells.
