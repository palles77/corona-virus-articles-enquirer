            "text": "61 The electronic medical record (EMR) provided various methods for real time conversation between the 62 fellow and faculty during the virtual visit. Fellows and faculty created several new letter and 63 documentation templates specific for the COVID-19 crisis. New modules for electronic patient education 64 and coordination of care were created as well. 65 Regulations surrounding telehealth services were modified during this time of national emergency. The 66 federal government instituted waivers for originating site requirements and other previous restrictions 67 to allow for greater provision of telehealth services[4]. The billing and coding procedures for telehealth 68 services changed as well. Staying current on the latest provisions at the local and national level, 69 communicating with the coding auditors and educating fellows were essential due to the changing 70 over new regulations, codes and modifiers. Furthermore, training program directors discussed any new 72 changes with fellows through group emails and separate short conferences. 73 74 Virtual shared calendar for academic and educational activities: 75 Allergy fellowship educational activities were complicated by a multitude of factors. These factors 76 include overloading of the daily clinic schedule with telemedicine training, the rapid publication of key 77 COVID-19 articles and social distancing. To address these challenges the weekly calendar was revised. 78 The training program created a new detailed, shared calendar to follow and document all the fellows' 79 educational and clinical activities. The new calendar reduced scheduling conflicts. Given the rapidly 80 developing crisis and publication of important findings, journal club required an expansion. An on-line, 81 expanded journal club schedule was embedded in the above schedule. Faculty and fellows were 82 assigned to cover allergy and immunology related articles with focus on COVID-19. Example was a 90 83 minutes journal club through which 5 fellows thoroughly discussed the new practice parameters 84 guidelines on COVID-19 pandemic contingency planning published by ACAAI/AAAAI[3]. This journal club 85 was followed by a divisional meeting to reinforce some of the changes that needed to be implemented 86 in our clinical practice according to this publication. Similarly, social distancing required the in-person 87 discussing of interesting or challenging cases be transformed to conference calls, with emphasis on 88 cases related to COVID-19 infection. 89 Support systems: 90 The pandemic and fear of infections aside, going through this significant amount of change in a short 91 period of time has been very stressful. As schools and daycares closed, those with young children faced 92 difficulties to coordinate their personal lives. Unfortunately, grandparents were the high-risk population 93 and not suitable babysitters in the COVID-19 pandemic. Performing telehealth visits, or participating in 94 remote journal club, immunology lectures and training sessions from home were not always easy. We addressed these issues with provisional planning and changing schedules whenever needed. The fear 96 and uncertainty of the unfolding pandemic was particularly unsettling for fellows in training. An open 97 dialog was essential to allow trainees to voice concerns regarding how this national emergency may 98 impact their individual experience. The availability of program directors and their rapport with fellows to 99 address their concerns and provide reassurance on almost daily basis were essential and helpful to 100 address some of these challenges. Some other changes were made in response to fellow's concerns. For 101 examples the traditional call schedules were reordered in order to share the responsibilities, and 102 messages and phone calls were placed in clinical pools as the volume of patient questions increased in 103 the face of the pandemic. 104 105",
