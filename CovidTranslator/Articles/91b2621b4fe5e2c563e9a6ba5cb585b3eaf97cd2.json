Stationarity and moment structure for Box-Cox transformed threshold GARCH(1,1) processes. Statistics & Probability Letters 68, 209-220.] and includes the standard GARCH model and many other models as special cases. We first establish the asymptotic normality for quasi-maximum likelihood estimators (QMLE) of the parameters under the condition that the error distribution has finite fourth moment. For the case of heavy-tailed errors, we propose a least absolute deviations estimation (LADE) for PTTGARCH\u00f0p; q\u00de model, and prove that the LADE is asymptotically normally distributed under very weak moment conditions. This paves the way for a statistical inference based on asymptotic normality for heavytailed PTTGARCH\u00f0p; q\u00de models. As a consequence, we can construct the Wald test for GARCH structure and discuss the order selection problem in heavy-tailed cases. Numerical results show that LADE is more accurate than QMLE for heavytailed errors. Furthermore, the theory is applied to the daily returns of the Hong Kong Hang Seng Index, which suggests that asymmetry and nonlinearity could be present in the financial time series and the PTTGARCH model is capable of capturing these characteristics. As for the probabilistic structure of PTTGARCH\u00f0p; q\u00de model, we give in the appendix a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a strictly stationary solution of the model, the existence of the moments and the tail behavior of the strictly stationary solution. r 2007 Elsevier B.V.

            "text": "The autoregressive conditional heteroscedastic (ARCH) model proposed by Engle (1982) has led to considerable interest in models in which the conditional variance (volatility) of the current observation, s 2 t , is a function of the past observations. Engle's ARCH model formulated the conditional variance of the process as ''linear'' in squared past values. Bollerslev (1986) generalized ARCH model to allow the conditional variance to depend additionally on its past realizations. Since then many empirical and theoretical aspects of the ARCH/GARCH model have been developed. Shepard (1996) and Rydberg (2000) gave excellent surveys of ARCH/GARCH modelling for financial data. Weiss (1986) and Berkes et al. (2003) established consistency and asymptotic normality of maximum likelihood estimators for ARCH and GARCH model, respectively. The former assumes that the errors have finite fourth moment and the latter requires a moment of errors slightly higher than the fourth. Hall and Yao (2003) showed that when the error is heavy tailed (without finite fourth moment), quasi-maximum likelihood estimators (QMLE) are not asymptotically normal and suffer from slow convergence rate and complex asymptotic distribution, which do not facilitate, among others, statistical tests and interval estimation in the standard manner; see Hall and Yao (2003) , and Mikosch and Straumann (2006) . Peng and Yao (2003) pointed out that a kind of least absolute deviations estimator (LADE) has asymptotic normality if the error distribution has finite second moment.",

Among all the extensions, the functional form for s 2 t is of great importance (see Higgins and Bera, 1992) . Even Engle (1982) has acknowledged that ''it is likely that other formulations of the variance may be more appropriate for the particular applications''. Hsieh (1989) found that the GARCH models cannot fit some exchange rates satisfactorily; Scheinkman and LeBaron (1989) found evidence that volatility in stock market data cannot be captured completely by linear ARCH models; Gourie\u00b4roux (1997, p. 90) indicated that the heteroscedasticity varies depending on whether the error is positive or negative. This leads to asymmetric threshold ARCH modelling. The study of Li and Li (1996) has showed that threshold-asymmetric modelling provides better fitting compared with symmetric ARCH in the field of financial time series. Therefore, combining the above ideas, Hwang and Kim (2004) proposed a broad class of power-transformed and threshold ARCH model:",

Hence, the estimated PTTGARCH(1,1) model is adequate for the data fX t g. Notice that for both the residuals and the squared residuals, all the Wald statistics based on LADE are less than those based on QMLE, which suggests that the fitted model based on LADE is the more adequate. For the fitted model using LADE, we also test the hypotheses d \u00bc 1 and a 11 \u00bc a 21 , respectively. The Wald statistic for the former is 14.24 and is highly significant. The Wald statistic for the latter is 2.41 and is not significant, which may be caused by the small values of a 11 and a 21 . In fact, as we can see from the estimators,\u00e2 21 is about five times\u00e2 11 .
