Objective: We described the clinical practice of diagnostic testing for respiratory virus infections in patients presenting to ICU with suspected community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) or hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). Study design: Prospective observational study in consecutive CAP and HAP patients with an ICU stay of more than 24 h in two tertiary care hospitals in The Netherlands, from 2011 to December 2013. The proportion of patients receiving diagnostic testing with PCR for the presence of respiratory viruses in respiratory tract specimens was determined. Results: In total, 1452 patients were included, of which 712 patients presented with CAP and 740 with HAP. In CAP, 282 of 712 (40%) were tested for respiratory viruses (190 of 417 (46%) during the influenza season). In HAP, 95 of 740 (13%) were tested (50 of 372 (13%) during the influenza season). Regardless of the season, virus diagnostic tests were ordered significantly more often in patients with comorbidities, and in those presenting with elevated CRP and leucopenia. In patients who were tested during the influenza season, the prevalence of influenza was 14% in patients with CAP and 10% in those with HAP. Influenza was absent during the summer in both groups. Conclusions: Less than half of patients admitted to the ICU with suspected pneumonia were tested for the presence of viral pathogens, either in or outside the influenza season.",

Epidemiological studies show that the prevalence of viral respiratory tract infections can be as high as 41% in critically ill patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with a suspected CAP, and up to 34% in hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] . Detection of such infections in critically ill patients may have important implications for infection control measures such as isolation and, in case of (suspected) influenza, rapid initiation of antiviral medication [7, 8] . These measures have an impact on ICU resource use, mandating clear assessment of patients at risk of a viral respiratory tract infection.",

This may reflect a lack of awareness and clear clinical guidelines on virus diagnostics for ICU patients admitted with a suspected CAP or HAP. While international guidelines are unclear if all critically ill patients with suspected pneumonia for influenza during the winter season should be tested, the IDSA/ATS guidelines also state that \"Patients with CAP should be investigated for specific pathogens that would significantly alter standard (empirical) management decisions, when the presence of such pathogens is suspected on the basis of clinical and epidemiologic clues\" [10] . Although a positive virus test does not necessarily indicate virus-related or virus-induced critical illness [16, 17] , detecting an influenza infection has consequences for antiviral treatment and quarantine measures [7, 8] . Consequently, some experts advise testing for influenza in all patients admitted with severe pulmonary infection during the influenza season [18] [19] [20] . Indeed, our study shows that the results of the influenza PCR changed the oseltamivir prescription in 43% of patients. Whether testing for non-influenza viruses should be routinely performed in patients with severe pneumonia remains unclear. The US Healthcare Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee recommends droplet isolation for infections with adenovirus and rhinovirus in adults [25] , however the clinical significance of most non-influenza viruses in adult ICU patients in particular remains controversial [21] [22] [23] [24] . More research on the clinical burden of non-influenza viruses in patients with severe pneumonia is needed to determine if routine testing for other respiratory viruses is also warranted. Furthermore, more insight in the disease burden that comes with viral infection may limit unnecessary use of antibiotics.",

            "text": "Alternatively, low prevalence of testing may be due to difficulties in establishing a clinical suspicion of a viral respiratory tract infection in the critically ill. As testing in our study was more often performed in patients who had more comorbidities, higher CRP and leucopenia, physicians may believe that viral infection is characterized by these characteristics. However, symptoms of influenza-like-illness may be mild or absent in hospitalized patients [26] , and there is yet no clinical algorithm to distinguish viral pneumonia from bacterial pneumonia [1] . Although the risk factors for more severe and complicated viral respiratory tract infections are well established, such as chronic lung-and heart disease and immunodeficiency, this does not imply that ICU patients with these characteristics are at a higher risk of having a viral infection on admittance [3] . Selective testing in the ICU setting may lead to underdiagnosis of viral infections. Indeed, a large retrospective study comparing the predicted amount of influenza-related ICU admissions to the reported admissions with an influenza diag- nosis, suggested that over 90% of cases are either not diagnosed or not reported [9] . Small prospective observational studies show that 50-70% of detected influenza infections were unsuspected by the attending physicians [27, 28] . In addition, in the current study the majority of virus tests was ordered in the first 2 days of ICU admission. Interestingly however, there were also virus tests being ordered up to 7 days after ICU admission. While we do not know the reasons for ordering these tests, it may suggest that an infection with a respiratory virus may have been occasionally overlooked at ICU admission. Taken together, one could suggest that viral testing of ICU patients with a suspected respiratory tract infection should not depend on symptom severity. Remarkably, the frequency of viral testing did not differ very much between in and outside the influenza season. Outside the influenza season, the prevalence of viral infection dropped but was still 19% in CAP and 16% in HAP cases. Whether this indicates that virus testing should also be performed outside the season cannot be concluded from our study, because only a selected group of patients were tested. Of note, influenza virus was absent outside the season.",
