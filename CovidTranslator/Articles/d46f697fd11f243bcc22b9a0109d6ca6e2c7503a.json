Collectively, these two outbreaks have resulted in more than 10 000 cumulative cases, with fatal ity rates of 10% for SARS-CoV and 37% for MERS-CoV. 2 In December 2019, China reported to WHO cases of pneumonia of unknown cause occurring in Wuhan, Hubei. 3 Initial patients exhibited clinical symptoms resembling viral pneumonia. The country's capacity to detect cases facilitated early recognition and verification of the pathogen. Viral genetic sequencing of samples indicated a novel coronavirus. 4 The novel virus was named 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) and con firmed to have 75-80% resemblance to SARS-CoV. 2 As of Feb 24, 2020, approximately 80 000 confirmed cases have been reported in more than 28 countries. 5 On Jan 30, WHO declared the outbreak of COVID-19 as a public health emergency of international concern and put in place a series of temporary recommendations. 6 No specific antiviral therapies are available, and efforts to dev elop antivirals and a vaccine continue. Early indi cations suggest that bats are the primary reservoir for the virus, given COVID-19's close similarity to bat coronaviruses, 7 and while identification of the zoonotic origin of the virus continues, the public health measures for managing the outbreak rely on existing national and regional preparedness capacities to prevent, detect, verify, assess, and respond in accordance with the International Health Regulations (IHR, 2005) .",

WHO bench marks for IHR capacities include corresponding actions that can increase a country's emergency preparedness, and are used to strengthen a country's emergency preparedness and health security. 12 We analysed the 2018 SPAR submissions of 182 countries to review health security capacities in light of the COVID-19 outbreak and iden tified opportunities for further strengthening of IHR implementation. 13, 14 ",

Another limitation is related to the method being based on a deterministic approach; therefore, proportionate or inverse interactions among variables could not be shown. 24 An effective way of managing airborne infections is applying evidence-based public health prevention strategies. 16, 17, 22 This method includes scaling up public awareness of behaviours such as hand hygiene and respiratory etiquette, communicating and engaging with local communities about the risks of the outbreak, and putting in place effective public health response measures. 17, 25, 26 National points of entry should also have the capacity to prevent, detect, and respond to potential threats in line with the IHR.

Our findings show that many countries need support to achieve these capacities and increased support should be provided as a global priority action to strengthen health security. Our findings on operational readiness capacities and enabling function, which are low in many low-resource countries, underline the importance of increasing investments in scaling up IHR capacities, as described in the 2019 annual report of the Global Preparedness Monitoring Board. 8 Another challenge underpinning low national preparedness capacities is insufficient investment in human capital and poor continuity planning. 18, 31, 32 The world needs to increase investment in anthropologists, data scientists, communication specialist, educationists, and economists, who are all essential in providing necessary support for the control of infectious disease outbreaks. 12, 31, 32 The important role these specialists play in responding to outbreaks, including Ebola virus, MERS-CoV, cholera, and measles are well documented, and a key lesson from these public health emergencies has been to ensure that these skillsets are developed further. 32 Our data reinforce this notion, given the low capacities that many countries have to prevent and respond to health emergencies and infectious disease outbreaks effectively.",

Using an analysis of results of joint external evaluations, most of the countries of the African Region have been shown to have national capacity levels of between 1 and 3, and none have achieved level 5. This variance in national capacities is similar to our findings on the operational readiness index. 36 A study 37 of systemic resilience based on one composite measure of IHR core capacities to manage cross-border infectious diseases showed that improvement in IHR capacities is associated with a decrease of incidence of cross-border infection in Europe. 37 This level of capacity is also reflected in our study, in which most of the countries of the WHO European Region were level 4 or 5 as per the operational readiness index. 37 Some countries have stronger capacities than others; however, all countries should invest in build ing greater preparedness against health emergencies.",

Therefore these findings should be combined with the latest risk assessments that are available for COVID-19 and other assessments to understand the existing capacities.
