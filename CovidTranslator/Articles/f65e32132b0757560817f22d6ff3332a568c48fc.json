Bats are reservoirs for an increasing number of emerging zoonotic viruses, such as henipaviruses and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). However, little is known of T. gondii infection in bats. The objective of the present study was to determine the seroprevalence of T. gondii infection in bats in China. A total of 217 serum samples from 5 species of bats were collected between April, 2010, and August, 2011, from 4 provinces in China. Antibodies to T. gondii were determined using the modified agglutination test (MAT, 1:25 or higher). Antibodies to T. gondii were found in 26.5% (18/68) Megaderma lyra, 13.6% (12/88) Rousettus leschenaulti, 13.6% (3/22) Cynopterus sphinx, 20% (4/20) Vespertilio superaus, and 15.8% (3/19) Pipistrellus javanicus. Antibody titers ranged from 1:25 to 1:400, with titers of 1:200 detected in 4 of the 5 bat species. The present study suggests the likely occurrence of T. gondii infection in bats in China, and these bats are new putative hosts for T. gondii, which may pose a threat to human health.",

By using the chisquared test, the T. gondii seroprevalence was not significantly different among bats from different regions ( p value = 0.116). The overall seroprevalence of T. gondii in bats in the examined regions of China was 18.4% (40/217) ( Table 1 ). The results showed that the prevalence in female bats (25.0%, 31/124) was significantly higher than that in male bats (9.7%, 9/93) ( p < 0.05). The T. gondii seroprevalence in bats of 5 genera, namely Megaderma, Rousettus, Cynopterus, Vespertilio, and Pipistrellus was 26.5% (18/68), 13.6% (12/88), 13.6 % (3/22), 20% (4/20), and 15.8% (3/19), respectively, and there were no significant differences among them ( p > 0.05). Although difficult to interpret without knowing the ages of the bats tested, the higher seroprevalence in Megaderma (26.5%) than in other bat genera may be related to diet. In daily life, Megaderma mainly feeds on mice and sparrows, which are hosts of T. gondii. The other 4 bat genera are insectivorous and frugivorous bats.",

In the present study, a MAT titer of 1:200 was recorded in bats from 4 of the 5 species examined, indicating that the bats had possible acute infection. T. gondii seropositivity in insectivorous and frugivorous bats suggests that the caves where bats live are contaminated with T. gondii oocysts. As a result, bats may play an important role in the transmission of T. gondii in China where toxoplasmosis is a significant human health problem (Zhou et al. 2011) Results of the present investigation demonstrated the high seroprevalence of T. gondii infection in bats in China, indicating that these bats are new putative hosts for T. gondii, which may pose a threat to human health. Bats flying outside at night pose little risk. However, bats appearing in the daytime, which is often a sign of disease in bats, or those roosting in accessible locations where people are exposed, should be considered a potential public health threat. Further studies are warranted to isolate T. gondii from bats, consequently virulence assessment in mice and genotyping of T. gondii isolates from bats will also be carried out in the next experiments.",
