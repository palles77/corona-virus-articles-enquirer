Recently, translation of these basic science applications to clinical microbiology and infectious diseases has also progressed. From a clinical infectious disease perspective, genome-based organism identification, pathogen discovery, and antimicrobial susceptibility testing of problematic organisms offer the potential to yield diagnostic information that may not otherwise become available. Moreover, microarray-based studies have the ability to provide \"signatures\" of host cell transcriptional responses for individual pathogens and/or groups of pathogens. This type of information has the potential to confirm difficult diagnoses, to monitor responses to therapeutic intervention, or even to predict prognosis and sequelae following an infectious disease. Examples are presented to illustrate ways in which microarray technology has already impacted these areas of clinical microbiology.",

Total RNA is extracted from the control and experimental conditions of interest. Arbitrary primer pairs are used in an RT-PCR-based reaction for each condition, generating a differential display of signal intensities seen side by side. Signals of interest, such as an amplicon band that appears induced or upregulated, are cut from the gel, eluted, and re-amplified. To confirm differential expression, the amplicon is labeled and used as a probe on a Northern blot. Once confirmed, the amplicon is sequenced. While this sounds very inefficient given today's technology, it does offer the unique potential for novel gene discovery. In fact, in 2001, Van den Hoogen et al. (7) identified the first human metapneumovirus genetic sequences using this technology. They studied RNA extracts from cells that appeared to exhibit respiratory syncytial virus-like cytopathic effects but that could not be confirmed to contain any previously known human virus.

This technique offers no potential for novel gene discovery because the probes included on the membrane are of known sequences.

These arrays are glass slides or chips containing ordered mosaics of entire genomes as collections of either oligonucleotides (oligonucleotide microarrays) or cDNAs representing individual genes (cDNA microarrays). Classic Northern and Southern blotting approaches for the detection of specific DNA and mRNA species provide the technical basis for microarray hybridization with fluorescently labeled cDNA, while the application of robotics to achieve high spotting densities on glass slides facilitates the construction of microarrays containing up to 50,000 genes on a single slide or chip. Like differential display, the process of obtaining gene expression data using microarray techniques starts with RNA extraction from the biologic conditions of interest. An in vitro transcription reaction allows the incorporation of biotinylated nucleotides into the now labeled transcript pool; the transcripts are fragmented by heat and hybridized to the microarray gene chip. The array is washed, stained, and scanned into a database. The scanned images are compared to replicates of data generated from other samples or to samples derived from different experimental conditions of interest. Following rigorous validation, statistical algorithms are applied to determine which genes are expressed. Normalization of expression data per gene and/or per chip allows relative gene expression intensities to be compared across the different experimental conditions. Data reduction software and bioinformatics databases lend enormous power to these kinds of comparisons.",

The role of such genes will not be discovered without application of functional genomic technologies combined with creative experiments.

Of particular interest were nine regions that represented 61 open reading frames that were present in M. tuberculosis, but consistently absent from M. bovis strains, including BCG.

Several genes encoding mycolic acid biosynthetic enzymes were upregulated following isoniazid challenge, both upstream and downstream of the known site of action of the drug.
