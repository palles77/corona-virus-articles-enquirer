Using targeted recombination we previously demonstrated that the S gene of the highly neurovimlent MHV-4 conferred a dramatic increase in neurovimlence to the mildly neurovimlent MHV-A59. To identify the genetic determinants of neurovirulence within the MHV-4 spike, we generated isogenic recombinant viruses containing various MHV-4!MHV-A59 chimeric spike genes, and studied their phenotypes in vivo. The MHV-4!MHV-A59 chimeric spike genes consisted of either reciprocal exchanges between the Sl and S2 spike subunits, or smaller exchanges specifically in the hypervariable region (HVR) ofS1. The chimeric spike gene containing recombinants all exhibited efficient replication in vitro, yet many were severely attenuated for virulence in vivo. Furthermore, these attenuated recombinants exhibited decreased titers of infectious virus in the brain relative to the parental recombinant viruses containing the full-length MHV-4or MHV-A59 spike genes. This is the first report that compares the neurovirulence and pathogenesis ofisogenic viruses with defined alterations in the MHVspike protein. From these studies, it appears that the interactions of multiple regions of the MHVspike, including the HVR, act in concert to allow for efficient infection of and virulence in the murine central nervous system.

As with a number of viral pathogens, the severity and organ tropism of the disease depend, in part, on the viral strain. Infection with the highly neurovirulent MHV type 4 (MHV-4, a strain JHM isolate) results in a potentially fatal acute encephalomyelitis (Dalziel et al, 1986) . Infection with a similar dose of the mildly neurovirulent MHV type A59 (MHV-A59) results in amuch less severe disease with only mild encephalomyelitis and virtually no mortality (Lavi et al, 1986; Lavi et 01, 1988) . Recently, using targeted recombination, we have demonstrated that the spike gene ofMHV-4 is sufficient to confer this highly neurovirulent phenotype to MHV-A59 (Phillips et al, 1999) .",

To reduce the risk of secondary site rnutations influencing the viral phenotype, two independently selentcd recombinants (R), as indicated by their numbering, were isolated and characterized for each desired recombinant virus. As shown in Figure 1, the recombinants containing the St of MHV-4 and the S2 of MI-IV-A59 were named S1 4R70 ancl S1 4R71, and the recombinants containing the S1 of lVIHV-i\\5~J and the S2 of MHV-4 were called 82 4R81 and S2 4R82. The S1/82 junction was located just 3' to the cleavage site at amino acid 775 (see Materials and Castro and Perlman, 1995; Borgmann et 01, 1996) . Despite the dramatic differences in ncurovirulenco conferred by spike proteins of lVII-IV-4 and lVIHV-A59 they are highly homologous proteins, sharing 95% amino acid identity in 82 and 90% identity in S1. Within the S1 subunit of the loss nourovirulent MHV-A59 spike, however, there is deletion of 52 amino acids in a region termed tho hypervariable region (HVR) (Luytjes ei ol, 1987) . The spike HVR, loosely defined between amino acids 400 and 600, exhibits a great deal of variation in length from strain to strain (Parker et al, 1989; Banner et 01, 1990) . The highly neurovirulenl lVII-IVA has the longest known HVR, but deletions in this region of up to 159 amino acids have been reported (Parker et 01, 1989) . The specific role of the HVR in pathogenesis appears to be complex and multifunctional. Deletions or mutatiuns in this region have been found to alter viral fusion, eliminate neutralizing monoclonal antibody epitopes, and abrogate CD8+ T-cell epitopes (Dalziel or 01, 1986; Fleming et 01, 1986; Wege et ol, 1988; Parker et ol, 1989; Taguchi and Fleming, 1989; Gallagher ei al, 1990; Pewe et 01,1996; Tsai et 01,1999; Wang et al, 1992) .",

The results are shown in Figure 3 . As we have shown previously, the titers of infectious virus in the brain were similar following inoculation with S4R and SA59R despite the dramatic difference in virulence exhibited by the two recombinant viruses (Phillips et al, 1999) . The two chimeric S gene recombinants, however. exhibited markedly reduced virus titers. S14R70 exhibited low levels of virus while the amount of infectious S2 4R81 virus was at or below the level of detection (200 PFU/g). Thus, despite the high amino acid identity between the MHV-4 and MHV-A59 spike proteins they could not substitute functionally for one another in an in vivo infection. This result suggests that the high neurovirulence conferred by the MHV-4 spike protein requires specific homotypic interactions between regions in 51 and 52, and that disruption of these interactions has a major impact on the pathogenesis of the virus,",

Deletion of the MHV-4 HVR was based on a previously identified neutralizing monoclonal antibody escape mutant with a deletion in the HVR, and the two independently isolated recombinants containing this 142amino acid deletion were named 5 4AHVR160 and S4AHVR161 (Dalziel et al, 1986; Parker et al, 1989) . Recombinants S4HV-A59R131 and S4HV-A59R133 contained the MHV-4 5 gene with replacement of a l1Z-amino acid region in the HVR with the corresponding 60-amino acid region from the MHV-A59 S gene. In addition, to examine if the MHV-4 HVR was sufficient to confer some degree of increased neurovirulence we replaced theMHV-A59 HVRwith the MHV-4 HVR (see Figure 1 ). Thus, recombinants 5 A59HV-4R51 and SA59HV-4R52 contained the MHV-A59 spike with replacement of a 150-amino acid region in the HVR with the corresponding 202-amino acid region from the MHV-4 spike. Once again, we sequenced the entire 5 gene from at least one recombinant of each pair of recombinants. Recombinants S4AHVR160 and SA59HV-4R51 contained no secondary site mutations. Sequencing of recombinant 8 4HV-AS9R131, containing the MHV-4 spike with the MHV-A59 spike HVR, revealed a single co~ing mutation S3591. Interestingly we were unable to select a 5 4HV-A59R recombinant without a secondary site mutation. S4HV-A59R133, an independently isolated recombinant, contained a single coding mutation N374Y, and two additional recombinants, S4HV-AS9R132 and R134, were partially sequenced and found to contain single coding mutations (L1114F and L660Q, respectively). These two recombinants were not further characterized. The inability to select S4HV-AS9 recombinants without secondary site mutations in S suggests that these mutations were selected for during replication in cell culture.",

Moreover, in combination with previous studies associating mutations in si and 82 with neuroattenuation, these data suggest that regions within both subunits of the MHV-4 spike are required to confer the highly neurovirulent phenotype (Parker et al, 1989; Wang et al, 1992; Grosse and Siddell, 1994; 8aeki et 01,1997) . These regions of spike, which when mutated, deleted, or replaced influence neuropathogenesis, may interact structurally in the tertiary conformation of the protein, or cooperate functionally for efficient functioning of spike. There is experimental evidence to support the idea that regions of 81 and S2 closely interact. Variant viruses have been identified in which mutations in S'l, responsible for receptor binding, alter fusion, and mutations in S2, responsible for viral fusion, alter the conformation of Sl or confer resistance to neutralization by soluble receptor (Gallagher et al, 1990; Grosse and Siddell, 1994; Saeki et al, 1997) . Although the spike proteins of MHV-4 and MHV-A59 share a high degree of amino acid homology, the severely attenuated phenotype of the recombinants with chimeric spike genes indicate that there are critical differences between the two spike genes in both Sl and S2. As has been demonstrated with Theiler's virus (Pritchard et al, 1993; Zhang et al, 1993) , the in vivo attenuation observed with viruses containing chimeric viral proteins between similar strains demonstrates the complexity and sequence specificity of viral protein interactions, and attests to the stringent constraints imposed on a virus in vivo.",

Deletion or replacement of the MHV-4 HVR resulted in neuroattenuation of the recombinant viruses. These results definitively confirm the data from previous studies suggesting an association between mutations or deletions in the MHV-4 HVR and neuroattenuation (Dalziel et al, 1986; Fleming et al, 1986; Wege et al, 1988; Parker et al, 1989; Taguchi and Fleming, 1989; Gallagher et al, 1990; Wang et al, 1992) . Although no single function has been attributed to the HVR, studies of variant viruses suggest that alterations in this region can influence 81-82 interactions and fusion (Gallagher et al, 1990; Gallagher, 1997) . In ad-'dition, the MHV-4 spike HVR contains neutralizing antibody epitopes and T-cell epitopes (Dalziel et aI, 1986; Taguchi and Fleming, 1989; Gallagher et al, 1990; Castro and Perlman, 1995) , and thus alterations in this region could also influence the immune response to infection. Due to the severely attenuated in vivo replication and virulence exhibited by recombinants with deletion or replacement of the MHV-4 spike HVR, however, it appears that this region is critical for the in vivo functioning of the MHV-4 spike.",

Four of the recombinants (S14R70, S4~HVR160. S4HV-AS9R131, and SA59HV-4R51) exhibited some degree of delayed fusion. Although not all of the attenuated recombinants exhibited decreased cell-cell fusion, it appeared that a severe reduction in cellcell fusion was correlated with neuroattenuation. Interestingly, the slight decrease in cell-cell fusion observed with the recombinants containing a replacement of the MHV-AS9 HVR with the MHV-4 HVR did not result in a corresponding decrease in virulence. This result suggests that MHV infection and replication in the eNS may require a certain threshold level offusion. Although not all viruses with fusion defects exhibit neuroattenuation ( ST Hingley, unpublished data) , decreased fusogenicity of the MHV spike has previously been found to associate with decreased spread in the CNS (Gallagher et al, 1990; Fazakerley et al, 1992) .

By creating recombinant viruses with heterotypic Sl/S2 interactions we may have inadvertently altered either structural or functional interactions between the 81 and 82 subunits. These perturbations in spike may not have been apparent in cell culture due to differences between in vitro and in vivo infection such as receptor density on the host cell, the availability of free virus, the virion density required for an efficient infection, and the fusogenicity of the host cell. It is also possible that there were slight alterations in the processing or expression of the chimeric spike proteins that were not apparent in vitro.

As with all strains of MHV, point mutations can arise during viral replication. To decrease the impact of such secondary site mutations in the recombinant viruses we selected and characterized two independent recombinants for each desired recombinant, and sequenced the entire S gene from at least one recombinant. Interestingly, S4HV-A59R was the only recombinant for which multiple. independent recombinants were found to contain single coding mutations in S after minimal passage in cell culture. The location of one of these compensatory mutations identified in S2 (Ll114F) is striking as numerous studies have identified alterations in this exact residue. The 1114 codon has been identified by Gallagher et al (1991) (L1114R) as one of three amino acids responsible for conferring pH-dependent fusion on MHV-4, by Saeki et aJ (1997) (L1114F) in the spike gene of soluble-receptor resistant mutants, and by Wang et a1 (1992) (Ll114F) in a neuroattenuated monoclonal antibody escape mutant. It is interesting to speculate that this region of S2 plays a prominent role in the conformation of spike and perhaps in the dynamic interaction that occurs between S1 and S2. The identification of compensatory mutations that arise both in vivo and in vitro as a result of various alterations in spike may provide valuable clues as to which regions of spike undergo functional and/or structural interactions.",

Thus, the degree of amino acid homology between the MHV-4 and MHV-A59 spike glycoproteins was high enough for the chimeric spike gene recombinants to replicate efficiently in vitro, yet not high enough for efficient replication in the murine eNS. In addition, recombinants with alterations in the spike HVR have confirmed the importance of this region in the highly neurovirulent phenotype conferred by MHV-4 spike.
