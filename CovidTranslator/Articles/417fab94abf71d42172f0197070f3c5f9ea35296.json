However, with all its complexity and interconnectivity, biology has for many years been recalcitrant to engineering manipulations. The recent advances in synthesis, analysis, and modeling methods have finally provided the tools necessary to manipulate living systems in meaningful ways, and have led to the coining of a field named synthetic biology. The scope of synthetic biology is as complicated as life itself -encompassing many branches of science, and across many scales of application. New DNA synthesis and assembly techniques have made routine the customization of very large DNA molecules. This in turn has allowed the incorporation of multiple genes and pathways. By coupling these with techniques that allow for the modeling and design of protein functions, scientists have now gained the tools to create completely novel biological machineries. Even the ultimate biological machinery -a self-replicating organism -is being pursued at this moment. It is the purpose of this review to dissect and organize these various components of synthetic biology into a coherent picture.",

However, synthetic biology has become a field of its own only recently, mostly driven by the advances in systems biology and the development of new powerful tools for DNA synthesis and sequencing,.

Between 1970 and 2008, the size of DNA synthesized has increased from 75 bp to 582,970 bp. 13 The current record was set by the J. Craig Venter Institute (JCVI) in which the 583 kb Mycoplasma genitalium genome was constructed from 101 pieces of DNA fragments, each 5-6 kb in length. 14 Initially, synthesis was achieved in two steps: the first step involves multiple in vitro enzymatic recombination to create six large pieces of DNA, while the second step takes advantage of the in vivo yeast recombination mechanism to produce the final synthetic genome ( Figure 2 ). Later, the entire genome assembly process was simplified by directly assembling 25 overlapping DNA fragments in a single step in yeast. 15 A similar method called DNA assembler was developed by Shao and co-workers to assemble a biochemical pathway. 16 As proof of concept, a biochemical pathway consisting of 8 genes (a total of ~19 kb) was assembled in a single step in yeast, resulting in a recombinant strain that could utilize D-xylose to produce a nutraceutical zeaxanthin.

Broadly speaking, there are two protein engineering approachesrational design and directed evolution. 17 Rational design is often difficult because of incomplete knowledge of protein structure, function, and dynamics, whereas directed evolution is more suited for improving preexisting protein functions. Directed evolution mimics the Darwinian evolution process in the test tube, involving repeated cycles of generating genetic diversity by random mutagenesis or gene recombination, and screening or selecting functionally improved or novel protein variants. Directed evolution has been successfully used to tailor a wide variety of protein properties such as activity, stability, and selectivity. [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] However, directed evolution has its own limitations, too. For example, the use of microorganisms in directed evolution to link the protein activity with its genetic code imposes an upper limit on the protein variant library size that can be sieved through. This limit is generally lower than 10 10 , which is the potential library size that would be generated if a typical protein (300 amino acids) were to be diversified with three randomly introduced point mutations. Thus, much effort has been devoted to combining the advantages of both directed evolution and rational design in the past few years.",

Other methods include Overlap-Primer-Walk Polymerase Chain Reaction (OPW-PCR) 27 and rapid Site Directed Domain Scanning Mutagenesis (SDDSM). 28 Computational protein design has also been combined with directed evolution to create proteins with novel functions. A fine example of such strategy is the creation of a Kemp elimination enzyme through computational design followed by directed evolution optimization. 29 Briefly, R\u00f6thlisberger and coworkers first decided on the mechanism of catalysis, and then, with the aid of computational tools, placed catalytic residues at their exact positions to maximize transition state stabilization.

By fusing a library of promoters to the various enzymes in the isoprenoid production pathway, Pitera and coworkers have managed to engineer a flux-balanced pathway with improved yield and reduced metabolic burden. 30 These well-characterized families of transcription regulators have emerged as powerful tools in metabolic engineering as they allow rational coordination and control of multigene expression, thereby decoupling pathway design from construction. 31 32 Pathway engineering tools are most directly relevant in biochemical production at the pathway level.",

At the same time, it enables the direct control of metabolic flux by adjusting the number of interaction domains on the scaffold, thereby adjusting the enzyme complex composition. In addition to transcription and localization control, regulatory parts such as ribosome binding sites (RBSs), riboswitches, and operator-regulator pairs can also be redesigned and engineered to help solve problems involved in synthetic metabolic pathways. 34 Genome Engineering-The increasing capability to generate and manipulate large DNA molecules has opened a new era for genome engineering. Depending on purpose, editing of genomes can be carried out by a wide variety of approaches, such as constructing a genome de novo, 14 eliminating unstable DNA elements, 35 combining one genome with another genome, 36 reorganizing genome components, 37 and whole genome shuffling. 38 Most recently, a new powerful approach called Multiplex Automated Genome Engineering (MAGE) was developed for large-scale programming and evolution of cells. 39 In this method, a pool of degenerate oligonucleotides is cyclically introduced into various cells within the population, to generate sequence diversity across the chromosome by allelic replacement. The entire process can be automated to facilitate rapid and continuous generation of a diverse set of genetic changes, such as mismatches, insertions, and deletions. Because it can simultaneously target many locations on the chromosome for modification in a single cell or across a population of cells, MAGE can be used to produce combinatorial genomic diversity on a large scale.

It is gratifying to know that the need for a genomic level characterization of transcription control has been addressed by a method called Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP). 42 ChIP is a technique in which a protein of interest is selectively immunoprecipitated from a chromatin preparation to determine the DNA sequences associated with it. ChIP has been widely used to map the localization of post-translationally modified histones, histone variants, transcription factors, or chromatin modifying enzymes on the genome or on a given locus. 43 Recently, a new method called Chromatin Immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq) was developed for genome-wide profiling of DNA-binding proteins, histone modifications or nucleosomes, and genome alignment. [44] [45] The advantages of ChIP-seq lie in the higher resolution, lower noise and greater coverage than its array-based predecessor ChIP-chip method. Of note, since ChIP-seq experiments typically generate large amount of data, powerful computational tools are needed to uncover biological mechanisms. 46 Proteomics Tools-The field of proteomics is relatively new compared to that of genomics. While it is relatively easy to characterize a genome and its mRNA expression profile, DNA and mRNA are not the actual molecules that perform the function. Protein level expression can be decoupled from mRNA level expression due to translational control, post translational modification, and localization. This is the motivation behind the development of the proteomics tools.",

The selected codon is most often the UAG (amber) codon, while the tRNA and amino-acyl transferase pair is taken from a heterologous source to maintain orthogonality. All of the components are engineered to work together by protein engineering, mostly via the directed evolution approach. 69, 72 Over the years, a large number of amino acid analogs have been developed. Many of them have interesting properties such as fluorescence and photo-regulation.

When we use cells to detect molecules, we may want a \"yes or no\" answer instead of an \"x relative to y\" answer. For example, to tell if a neurological toxin is above a dangerous threshold, we would prefer a device that turns red when above threshold and colorless otherwise, as oppose to one that changes from colorless to pink to red as the concentration increases, which will require the user to differentiate between light red (below threshold) and red (above threshold). In a digital system, a variable has only two states and is therefore more tolerant to noise than in an analog system. However, the natural world is inherently analog. To interface the two systems, we need an analog-to-digital converter. Such a converter can be constructed using an array of toggle switches with increasing response threshold. 78 Other than direct applications, constructing gene circuits also allow scientists to understand the properties of nature's circuits. In a recent example, Ca\u011fatay and co-workers asked why nature picked a certain circuit design when there are others that are functionally equivalent. 79 By constructing the alternative circuit and comparing that to the wild type, they found that the wild type circuit is noisier, i.e. has more fluctuation, than the alternative. Further experiments then revealed that while the alternative circuit is more precise and is able to perform its function better in a specific environment, the noisy wild type circuit is able to perform its function over a wider range of environments. Thus in a changing environment similar to that of nature, a noisy and adaptable circuit is selected over a precise circuit.",

The unique challenges in such engineering efforts include balancing of promoter strengths, enzyme expression and coordination of expression, and interface with native metabolism. 2 The motivation behind using cells for biochemical production is different depending on the class of biochemicals produced. For specialty chemicals, the structure is sometimes so complex that chemical synthesis becomes prohibitively expensive, difficult, or both. In this case, the motivation of using the biological production route is to circumvent difficult chemistry. Well known for their specificity, enzymes can perform transformations that may take many more steps to accomplish through chemical synthesis.

[81] [82] In order to endow yeast with the above functions, multiple enzymes and pathways need to be inserted and optimized. To break down cellulose to glucose, at least three classes of enzymes need to be introducednamely cellobiohydralase, endoglucanase, and beta-glucosidase. To break down hemicellulose to its component sugars (including D-xylose and L-arabinose), at least four classes of enzymes need to be introduced -namely xylanase, xylosidase, glucuronidase, and arabinosidase. All these enzymes can either be secreted or surface-anchored, and they need to be expressed in the right proportion for the best synergy. Furthermore, to increase the utilization efficiency of the pentose sugars, pentose transporters may be introduced too.",

Craig Venter Institute have taken the approach further on M. genitalium by reducing its already tiny genome of 482 genes to 382 genes. The number of essential genes is greater than expected, and there are about 100 of these with unknown functions. 83 In addition, as mentioned above, they have also taken a bottom up approach with the M. genitalium genome. The whole 583 kb genome of wild type M. genitalium has been chemically synthesized and then assembled in yeast. 14 Attempts to reboot the aforementioned M. genitalium genome have been, for a while, challenging. 84 However, they have recently succeeded in rebooting a chemically synthesized M. mycoides genome transplanted into M. capricolum. The rebooted cell is capable of self-replication, and exhibits the expected phenotype of M. mycoides. 85 While the chemical synthesis of a self-replicating organism is still underway, the chemical synthesis of a host-dependent organism has already been achieved. DNA and RNA viruses, with their small genomes (8-30 kb) and relatively simple function, are more amenable to chemical synthesis. So far, the whole genome synthesis of poliovirus, 1918 'Spanish' influenza virus, HIVcpz, coronavirus, and \u03a6X174 have been achieved and proven infectious. 86 One immediate use of chemically synthesized viruses is in the area of vaccine production. It is now possible to make large-scale changes to a viral genome so as to attenuate its virulence. For example, codondeoptimization has led to a strain of virus that is phenotypically identical to its wild type cousin but is unable to replicate in the normal host because of multiple rare codon usage. 86 Szostak and coworkers have led a separate effort to create life in laboratory. The main motivation behind their work is to understand how a self-replicating organism can be formed from prebiotic chemistry -i.e., without the use of any enzymes, from simple organic molecules such as sugars, amino acids, nucleic acids, and fatty acids. Solving the mystery of life that has been created billions of years ago is a daunting task, and their work offers a plausible physical and chemical origin of life on earth. The non-enzymatic assembly and replication of lipid vesicles has already been demonstrated, while the non-enzymatic polymerization of nucleic acid is currently being attempted. 87",

For example, enzymes can first be improved for better solubility, stability and functions; they can then be integrated into a pathway that produces a desirable product. To improve the titer and purity, genome scale engineering can be employed to optimize the production strain. And lastly, multiple strains can be developed this way to complement each other in a consortium to perform a full series of chemical transformation that no single strain can independently perform. Overview of synthetic biology. This scheme describes the relationship among the various methods used in synthetic biology and different applications of synthetic biology on different levels. Synthesis of large DNA molecules in yeast. (a) yeast homologous recombination mechanism. DNA fragments sharing an overlap region at 3'-and 5'-ends with the neighboring DNA fragments can be assembled into a single larger DNA molecule. (b) construction of a synthetic M. genitalium genome. 25 different overlapping DNA segments (blue arrows, 17~35 kb each) composing the genome were co-transformed into yeast followed by assembly of the entire genome in a single step. Analog-to-digital converter. (a) In this example system, the two toggle switches are initially 'off', i.e. repressor 2 and repressor 4 are expressed. Separately in a sensor array, repressor 1 has an input dependent promoter with a low input threshold. When input concentration rises above its threshold, repressor 1 is expressed, switching the state of toggle switch 1 to 'on'. Using another input dependent promoter that has a higher threshold, switch 2 is toggled 'on' at a higher input concentration. (b) The corresponding digital response of the example gene switches. Artemisinin biosynthetic pathway. The mevalonate-based FPP biosynthetic pathway have been assembled from S. cerevisiae (HMG-CoA synthase, hmgS; N-terminally truncated HMG-CoA reductase, thmgR; mevalonate kinase, mk; phosphomevalonate kinase, pmk; and mevalonate diphosphate decarboxylase, mpd) and E. coli (acetoacetyl-CoA synthase, atoB; IPP isomerase, idi; and FPP synthase, ispA), and expressed in E. coli. The pathway is assembled in two operons, one is responsible for converting acetyl-CoA to mevalonate, and the other is responsible for converting mevalonate to FPP. Further introduction of amorphadiene synthase (ads), oxidase (p450), and redox partner (cpr) allows the strain to convert FPP to artemisinic acid which can be chemically converted to artemisinin. A synthetic predator-prey ecosystem. The system consists of two engineered bacterial populations that control each other's survival and death. CcdB is a cytotoxic protein that kills the cell and CcdA is its antidote. In the predator, CcdB is constitutively expressed, and will die off without an external signal. The antidote CcdA is expressed only when the predator receive signaling molecules (3OC6HSL) from the prey. At high enough prey concentration, the predator will survive. However, the prey also receives signaling molecules (3OC12HSL) from the predator. In the prey, CcdB is expressed in response to the predator signal. Therefore, in high enough predator concentration, the prey will die.",
