In these papers, we described the method of our bootstrap, jackknife and anti-jackknife (see below) tests of CVTrees. We showed the results on the examples of virus, bacteria and fungi.

The most suitable K-values depend on the overall size of the proteome of the group of organisms under study.

First, we show that the CVTrees based on whole proteomes (to be called the original CVTrees hereafter) are robust, and the branchings agree well with the corresponding taxonomy. This has been done in our previous studies (1, (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) . Second, in this paper, trees obtained by bootstrap or jackknife re-sampling of the datasets are compared to the original CVTrees at the same K in terms of topological distances between them. As CVTrees are calculated by Neighbor-Joining algorithm (11) , which is a robust and quartet-based method (12) , our strategy reminds what adopted by Rzhetsky and Nei (13) in estimating minimal-evolution trees by comparison with the corresponding NJ-tree. We make emphasis on topology, i.e., branching schemes, of the trees as they are directly related to taxonomy.",

We used four datasets of protein sequences encoded in the genome: On each of these datasets, jackknife and bootstrap tests are performed in the following way. In the CV method, a species is represented by a composition vector made of overlapping K-residues, designated as \"K-peptides\" hereafter, from all proteins in the genome. To do jackknife tests, we first take randomly 90% of proteins from the whole protein pool. This is done for all species and a CVTree is constructed by carrying out the crucial \"subtraction procedure\" (1). The topological distance between this tree and the original CVTree inferred from the whole protein pool is calculated. This re-sampling is performed 100 times and the average topological distance between these 100 trees and the original 100% CVTree at the same K is taken. Then the protein fraction is decreased to 80%, 70%, \u2026, 10% and the average topological distance at a given K is plotted against the protein fraction (Figure 1) .",

An unrooted tree with N terminal leaves has N 3 internal edges. Cutting any of these internal edges defines a split of the set of leaves into two subsets. To measure the distance between two trees constructed for the same set of leaves, we compare the two lists of split-trees obtained by cutting each of the N 3 internal edges. If the two lists are identical up to reordering, the two trees have the same topology and the topological distance d T =0. In general, the topological distance is defined as (16) : d T = 2\u00d7(number of distinct split-trees) The factor 2 was introduced to incorporate more general cases of multi-furcating nodes (CV method yields only bifurcating trees). Therefore, if the two trees have entirely different topologies, the topological distance between them reaches the maximal value d T = 2\u00d7(N 3). We have written a program to implement the definition of topological distance. In fact, we adopt a relative topological distance by dividing the calculated d T by its maximal possible value 2\u00d7(N 3), thus the factor 2 drops out and the relative distance varies between 0 and 1.",

Suppose that the frequency of appearance of all amino acids is the same, e.g., 1/20. Then the probability of encountering a designated K-peptide is 20 -K . Let L be the total number of amino acids in the collection of proteins of an organism, the expected number of such K-peptide is L/(20) K . In order for a K-peptide to bear species-specificity, this number should be less than what expected for a random sequence, i.e., L/(20) K <<1 or, after taking logarithm of base 10, logL < K(1+log2). On the other hand, the subtraction procedure in CV method requires that the number of (K 2)-peptide should not be too few: L/(20) (K 2) >1, i.e., logL > (K 2)(1+log2). Putting together these inequalities, we get logL/(1+log2) < K < 2+logL/(1+log2).",
