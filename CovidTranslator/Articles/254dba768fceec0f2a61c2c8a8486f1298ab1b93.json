Progress since the development of concepts such as ''Open Skies'' in the late 1970s as an alternative to the restrictive bilateral air service agreements that had effectively controlled most international air transport since the mid-1940s has been uneven and spasmodic. The recent move to open the North Atlantic more fully to competition has proved a particularly challenging task, and the agreement between the US and the European Union is still both partial and conditional. This paper offers an overview of the economics of the situation and provides insights into the reasons why it has developed in the way it has, the outcomes that we may expect from it, and some consideration of the wider, non-commercial, impacts that it may have.",

The recent opening up, at least to a substantial extent, of the US-EU 1 transatlantic market is the one of the most significant measures of international airline liberalization since the removal of international market barriers within the European Union (EU). The US-EU passenger market is substantial. In 2007 it accounted for 55 million passengers, 385 flights per day in each direction and 235 nonstop city-pairs served by 45 airlines comprising eight from the US, 26 from the EU and 11 others.

There were particular fears in some countries that the US, that had the largest fleet of commercial aircraft at the time and the potential of adding to this by converting surplus military hardware, would dominate any largely market-based outcome and thus an institutional structure emerged that led to piecemeal, and restrictive, practical arrangements.",

Additionally, domestic markets were normally regulated although the structure differed between countries.

Since that time, a further 60 or so liberal agreements, of varying importance, have been signed between the US and partners, including many European states. The emergence of the large free trade area in air transportation service within Europe from the mid-1990s was another element in freeing-up other international markets by having both knock-on and demonstration effects for regions outside of the European area. 6 3. The economic condition of the airline industry Airlines find it difficult to recover their full costs in competitive markets. As seen in Fig. 1 that reports operating margins, 7 both globally and for two of the largest markets, there are clear cycles in the financial performance of the industry that correlate with the larger business cycle. But, in addition, taken overall, the airline industry has performed badly across cycles. In the US, for example, over the past 20 years or so the operating margins of US airlines has been about 0.4% compared with an average of well over 5% for US industry as a whole. The period has also seen a number of traditional airlines cease operations permanently (e.g. Pan Am and TWA in the US and Sabena and Swissair in Europe) as well as a much larger number of new entrants, and particularly low cost carriers.",

Strategic alliances now dominate international air transportation. Although not all have been successful, in a commercial world there are inevitably failures, they have allowed wider network economies of scope, and density on the costs side, and economies of market presence on the demand side to be exploited. They also provide a degree of protection for airlines that would otherwise, in excessively competitive conditions that can emerge in aviation, find it difficult to recover their full costs even if they are highly efficient. 9 This is confirmed in a variety of previous studies that have looked at some of these alliances. Although the links have seldom been explicitly drawn, the enhanced efficiency of international airlines, given the derived nature of the demands for their services, would seem inevitably to have improved the vitality and economic performances of the regions they serve. 1 9 8 8 1 9 8 9 1 9 9 0 1 9 9 1 1 9 9 2 1 9 9 3 1 9 9 4 1 9 9 5 1 9 9 6 1 9 9 7 1 9 9 8 1 9 9 9 2 0 0 0 2 0 0 1 2 0 0 2 2 0 0 3 2 0 0 4 2 0 0 5 2 0 0 6 Europe US Global The case for continually reviewing the nature of the institutional structure within which air transportation services are delivered becomes stronger when taken in the context of changes in the global market. Air transportation is clearly growing in many relative new markets in Asia, particularly China and India, but it is also forecasted to expand in some more traditional markets such as the North Atlantic; Boeing Commercial Airplane (2005) suggests a growth rate of about 4.6% over the next two decades, if current relationships continue. But even if the long-term projections prove excessive, there is a strong case for ensuring that the full comparative economic advantages of the EU economy are exploited. While there have been short-term disruptions to the growth in US/EU passenger movements, the evidence is that the downturn in international trade in air services across the Atlantic that followed the events of September 11th, 2001 has passed and there is once again an outward shift in the demand for air transportation (Fig. 2) .",

There have been traditional concerns expressed by airline employees about erosion of their higher pay scales should EU workers be able to work in the US. This argument, however, seems rather moot in 2008 given the state of US airlines' finances and of the US dollar. Equally, in the UK and other countries where restrictive ASAs still exist, there are those that would lose out should there be a regime change; for example, it would affect the relative competitive position of their airlines and airports. 10",

Initially the response of European governments was tepid, in part because the focus of the EU at the time was more on internal transportation matters, especially surface transportation, and because the efficiency of US carriers induced many European airlines to believe that they would be at a significant competitive disadvantage. 13 The practical outcome within the EU was a series of liberalizing agreements between a number of European states (e.g. the UK with Netherlands, Belgium, Germany and Luxemburg) in the 1980s. These did not, however, represent full market liberalization (government intervention remained potentially significant) but rather they were a relaxation of the older regimes.

While outwardly aimed at preventing third parties entering the bilateral, de facto nationality clauses act to impede the full functioning of international air transportation capital markets. Linked with this, foreign ownership of carriers operating in US and intra-European markets is also limited, both in terms of the share ownership permitted and the voting power of these shares. For example, the Air Commerce Act 1926 requires that US citizens own at least 51% of any individual aircraft in order for it to be registered under the US and the Civil Aeronautics Act 1938, Congress requires that US citizens own or control at least 75% of the voting interests of US airlines. 14 This standard has remained the same since. This makes mergers and cross investment impossible outside of the limits set and, because of the lack of control over its use, is not exactly an incentive for foreigners to invest their money. There are, in addition, regulations over the nationality of who may hold senior managerial positions. 15 There are also rules regarding cabotage, or eighth freedom rights. In the US, domestic services can only be provided by an airline ''established'' in the country. This, because of the inability to create feeder services, limits the capability of a non-US carrier to develop a full double hub-market across the Atlantic.

These effects are not easy to isolate in a simple way but Fig. 3 offers a general representation of the issues that are involved. In particular, it highlights the potential fare and output implications of the various types of transatlantic regulatory regimes. 19 The initial position of the demand curve for transatlantic services under the pre-1980s regulatory regime is assumed linear and shown as D 1 in the figure, and the average cost curve per passenger, which for simplicity is assumed to rise more than linearly with quantity, as C 1 . Market forces, however, because of the institutional interventions in place, did not determine fares and capacity across the Atlantic. Capacity under this system was limited (seen as the ''capacity constraint'' in the figure) and fares were regulated. If we assume that the terms reached under the bilateral agreement regarding fares allowed for at least cost recovery by the partners' airlines this implies a fare levels up to F 1 . 20 The removal of both this capacity constraint and of negotiated pricing, as happens under the Open Skies arrangements, results in competition for air services, and a move towards cost-recovery pricing strategies by the carriers. This would reduce fares to F * 1 .",

The reason for this is that the outward shift in demand reflects a better ''quality'' of service -e.g., more convenient flights, transferability of frequent-flier miles, and seamless ticketing -and that, on average, potential travelers are willing to pay more for this than the generic portfolio of features that were found under the old bilateral ASA structure.

Continental European airlines have had a long tradition of supporting their flag carriers for a variety of reasons that are linked to their perceptions of their national interest.

            "text": "What does become pertinent, however, is the extent to which the fare structure is influenced by the market power of the airlines. The analysis presented in Fig. 1 assumes that, in the Open Skies environment, fares are set to recover costs; in other words, competition and mergers policy can effectively fulfill the role of regulation. This raises issues as to the nature of a market served by a relatively small number of network carriers. A degree of competition exists between the various alliances for the trunk hauls market, and there is also competition at either end of routes with many other, including low cost, carriers competing for passengers in overlapping feeder and origin-destination traffic to international hub airports. There are also theoretical reasons derived from game theory suggesting that the outcome in a market with three players approaches that of competition. Nevertheless, each alliance by dint of product differentiation (e.g., they serve different airports) inevitably enjoys some degree of monopoly power. This could lead to fares higher than F 2 and a smaller output than Q 2 with consequential reductions in consumer surplus. 22 The effects of a full Open Aviation Area -a genuine open marketcan be seen as an extension of this framework. Free capital markets, together with the ability to have more flexible feeder networks owned by the truck carrier at both ends of transatlantic services, would further lower costs and may generate additional economies of market presence, although this latter effect is unlikely to be large. The ability to invest across national boundaries provides for shortterm support in situations of local market fluctuations and more integrated long-term planning of infrastructure; it would in effect produce air networks akin to those enjoyed by US railroads that can move investment funds across states rather than have separate rail companies each limited intra-state operations. In terms of Fig. 3 , it would mean lower fares and larger air traffic volumes with concomitant increases in society benefits.",

From a forecasting perspective, the high-technology employment creation from expanding the existing national Open Skies arrangement to a full EU agreement may be below the 30,000 figure because there will be some diversionary effects from regions benefiting from existing Open Skies; there are also capacity constraints in some of the regions in countries that did not previously have a liberal ASA with the US that will dampen the effects of liberalization.

In the US there are, with some few period exceptions, no explicit slot allocations -essentially the air traffic control takes planes as they arrive with adjustments being made for technical reasons such as the size of the hardware. In contrast, the systems in Europe involve scheduling committees at airports that allocate the slots periodically, initially to improve interlining arrangements, generally giving preference to the ''grandfathering'' of incumbent carriers. 30 The EU has intervened in the past, and particularly since 2004, to force reallocation of little used slots.

Indeed, there may be very good reason to expect safety to improve somewhat as a more flexible international airline market stimulates the expansion of the strategic alliances with the larger carriers putting pressure on their smaller partners to maintain safety standards (Button, 1997) . The freer transatlantic market will also have a trade diversion effect taking some, albeit probably small, amount of traffic from other less safe routes. Perhaps as important is the strength of the international institutional structure that oversees aviation safety. The UN's International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) develops and sets safety standards that are adhered to by all nations under the US-EU transatlantic Open Skies agreement. In addition, member countries have their own safety authorities that generally apply standards in excess of the minimum ICAO requirements and also allow other countries involved in their air transport market to inspect on a reciprocal basis to ensure compliance.",

As with safety, national and international arrangements, including the role of the ICAO, dominate the effectiveness of security at airports and on airlines. Frictions that have emerged in the past between the EU and US, for example over documentation and release of passenger lists, are really unrelated to the nature of the air ASA in place.",

It owns European regional airlines Air Dolomiti and Lufthansa CityLine, as well as the Swiss International Air Lines and has a 49% stake in Eurowings, a 30% stake in bmi, and a 13% stake in Luxair. In a similar vein, Virgin Atlantic Airlines own 23% of recently launched Virgin America that will provide feed for its North Atlantic routes at JFK and other international gateways.

No positive change occurs without disruption, this has certainly been the experience of airlines, but these negative features have been far outweighed by the positive impacts. 33 One would expect very much the same general outcome from the transatlantic Open Skies agreement. Since the move is to a more market-based system, the exact outcomes of the new institutional structure are, almost be definition impossible, to foresee; after all if one could predict them then these could have been enacted through command and control measures.",

Efforts to get a comprehensive Transatlantic agreement have proved challenging, however, in part because of somewhat differing views in Europe and the US on the meaning of free trade. What does seem to be clear, from a European perspective, is that there are benefits for the Union as a whole in adopting a uniform Open Skies agreement with the US, although there may be additional gains in extending this to a full and genuine Open Aviation Area of the type found within the US and the EU. The challenge now is to develop a mutually acceptable framework that allows both parties to move from a simple, product based, Open Skies to one that embodies the mobility of factors of production as well within a full open market.",
