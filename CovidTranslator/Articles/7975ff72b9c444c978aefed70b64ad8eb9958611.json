Thirteen seronegative adult rabbits were infected oro-nasally using the BS89 RHDV strain. Liver and spleen samples were collected from 4 h post infection (p.i.) and repeated every 4 h till 44 h p.i. Each sample was tested immunohistochemically, by sandwich ELISA and by ISH. A 2.482-kb RNA probe, matching the genomic fragment coding for the VP60 structural protein of RHDV, was arranged. Two RNA probes (sense and antisense) were transcribed in vitro and UTP-digoxigenin-labelled. The antisense probe clearly detected positivity in the cytoplasm of the hepatocytes at 8 h p.i. Labelled hepatocytes were scattered throughout the sections until 24 h p.i. followed by a more diffuse perilobular positive reaction. A much weaker signal of similar distribution was detected up to 24 h p.i. using the sense RNA probe. All spleen samples tested negative for both probes. Liver samples were positive at 32 h p.i. using both ELISA and the immunoperoxidase test. Spleen samples were positive using only the ELISA at 32 h p.i. This study showed that RHDV replication occurred almost immediately after inoculation and that the liver appears to be the main site of replication.",

            "text": "Rabbit haemorrhagic disease (RHD) is a highly acute and fatal disease of domestic and wild rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) caused by a positivestranded RNA virus which belongs to the Caliciviridae family (Capucci et al., 1990; Ohlinger et al., 1990) . The disease is characterised by a short course (2-3 days), high levels of morbidity (100%) and mortality (80-90%), few but severe signs (dyspnoea, anorexia, depression, convulsions and epistaxis) and by a severe necrotising hepatitis (Marcato et al., 1991) . RHD is endemic in many countries in Europe, East Asia and North Africa. Although the disease and its etiological agent have been investigated for the past decade, several aspects of pathogenesis are still to be clarified. These include: the site where virus replication occurs initially; how the virus reaches the hepatocytes; and the role of Kuppfer cells in viral distribution in the liver. Clarification of these aspects could provide a better understanding of the mechanisms which lead to the viral degradation associated with a chronic form of the disease (Barbieri et al., 1997) and why young animals below the age of 45 days are susceptible to RHDV infection but do not develop any sign of the disease.",

In the picornaviridae it has been estimated that negative strand RNA amounts, on average, to less than 3% of total viral RNA in cells where the virus is actively replicating (Novak and Kirkegaard, 1991) .

Viral replication appeared to begin almost immediately after inoculation, as indicated by the presence of scattered positive hepatocytes as early as 8 h p.i. Thereafter, with the exception of one animal (16 h p.i.), all liver samples were positive with the antisense probe and the signal gradually increased.

However all these methods differ from ISH in terms of preparation of the sample since they involve organ homogenisation and therefore the contamination by virions present in the blood stream or associated with blood cells cannot be excluded. Passive transfer of virions from liver to spleen, and not RHDV replication in the latter, was previously suggested (Barbieri et al., 1997) . The results obtained above further support this hypothesis. It may well be that mature virus particles pool in the spleen but do not replicate in spleen cells.",
