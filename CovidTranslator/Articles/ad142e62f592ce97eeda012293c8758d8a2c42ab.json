We have developed a computational technique that imparts both directionality and length constraints into searches for unique combinations of amino acids within protein sequences. Using statistical approaches, we have carried out searches of all possible two-and three-residue motifs contained within these databases. This technique is based on the unusually high occurrence of a small number of these motifs when compared to the expected probability of finding a specific residue grouping within a given database. Subsequent filtering of this search to identify such unique combinations has provided several examples that can be used as markers to identify particular proteins within or across databases. We focus on three of these motifs, which were found to be of greatest interest to us. The CC, CM and a combination of the two, CCM motifs all occur either more or less frequently than would be predicted based on standard amino acid distributions within the entire human proteome. r",

It is therefore natural to expect that the distribution of amino acids, across all protein sequences, would appear to be fixed, given no mutations over a specific period of time. Of the 20 naturally occurring amino acids, each seems to appear randomly located at a particular position within the sequence of a protein. However, when the sequences of a group of proteins are compared to one another, specific patterns begin to emerge. These patterns are commonly referred to as motifs and frequently produce similar structural elements and in many cases, similar functions between the proteins that contain them. In recent years, significant efforts have been made to reduce sequences into discrete motifs, so that each can be linked to some specific biological function based on particular rules [1, 2] . Databases that consist of identifiable amino acid motifs, such as PROSITE, Pratt and EMOTIF, have been constructed to allow researchers an easy classification of unknown proteins into families based on their common motifs [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] . All of these methods share one property, they depend on specific alignment algorithms, such as the basic local alignment search tool (BLAST or PSI-BLAST) to perform the sequence comparison between diverse families of proteins being analyzed [5, 8] . These methods have already led to a number of key discoveries and offer the promise of determining biologically meaningful information about function from a protein's primary sequence.",

The underlying structure of a protein sequence, which is the order of the amino acids, has unique and identifiable characteristics. As an analogy, in written English, the letter q is almost always followed by u. Also, the frequency of the word ''and'' is much higher than that of the related three-letter strings: ''nad'', ''nda'', ''dan'' and ''dna'', which are simply permutations of the same set of individual letters to construct a word with a different meaning. Utilizing similar characteristics, we can intuitively scan for unique sequence vectors contained within any given protein.

We observed that the total number of CC pairs within the human subset of sequences contained in Genebank (a total of 27,178 proteins) was 9631.

The same also holds true for the CM pair, where we would expect to see 2159 CM pairs, but actually observe 5007 (Table 5 ).

If CCM occurs randomly, then we have p\u00f0CCM\u00de \u00bc p\u00f0C\u00dep\u00f0C\u00dep\u00f0M\u00de, and since p\u00f0CC\u00de42 m\u00fe2s p\u00f0C\u00dep\u00f0C\u00de, we will get k\u00f0p; q; CCM\u00de \u00bc log 2 p\u00f0CCM\u00de q\u00f0CCM\u00de \u00bc log 2 p\u00f0C\u00de 2 p\u00f0CC\u00de p \u00c0 \u00f0m \u00fe 2s\u00deo0. Based on Eq. (3.6), it is clear that the presence of a CC pair strongly excludes M. Therefore, the probability of the CCM triplet should occur less frequently than that of CC or M individually.",

This, however, does not explain the subset of proteins that contain numerous CC pairs, with respect to the calculated probabilities. Further analysis is required to determine if these pairs have arisen due to some type of duplication event through evolution, leading to the increased stabilization of extracellular matrix proteins. While the CC motif occurs more frequently than expected and the frequency of the CM pair occurs less frequently, as predicted by the amino acid frequencies within the Swiss-Prot database, the occurrence of a combination of the two, CCM, occurs more frequently. Using the genebank database, we determined the total number of human proteins containing the CCM motif is 119 and the total number of proteins is 27,178. In the Swiss-Prot database, the total number of the proteins having CCM is about 290 but the total number of proteins in this database is 128,494. In other words, the rate of all CCM proteins in human cell is twice as much as the rate in Swiss-Prot, implying that the rate of CCM proteins in human proteins is statistically significant. Using the probability distributions obtained from Swiss-Prot, the probability of a CCM triplet is 0.000005866, and total length of all human protein sequences in genebank is 5,777,674, so the number of CCM should be approximately 35, much less than 119. In other words, even though the occurrence of the CCM triplet seems to be random within the Swiss-Prot database, its frequency seems significant in human proteins.",

            "text": "One possible explanation as to the increased frequency of the CCM triplet within the human proteome is an increased rate of mutations at either of the two C positions (XCM or CYM). Our results suggest that the CC pair strongly excludes M because the conditional probability of M under the condition that the first two positions are occupied by CC is much less than the unconditional probability of M. So, mathematically, not only is CM a negative motif, but so is CCM. The strong competitiveness of CC and strong repulsion between C and M, and between CC and M, lead us to conclude that the mutational event leading to CCM would result from either XCM or CXM. If we let X and Y be the amino acids that correspond to the CC pair, then in addition to X-Cys-Met, we may find that the triplet Cys-Y-Met will also have a chance to change into CCM. In fact, since that the repulsion between CC and M, as well as between C and M are strong, it would imply that the number of Cys-Y-Met is greater than the number of X-Cys-Met in total protein sequences. Thus, the probability of changing Cys-Y-Met into CCM would be greater if the mutation at Y occurred at the same rate as that at X. Mutations to cysteine can arise from a single base substitution from phenylalanine, serine, tyrosine, arginine and glycine. The most relevant mutation would seem to come from serine to cysteine, where there are a total of four possible substitutions TCT, TCC, AGT, AGC to either TGT or TGC. A more detailed analysis of those residues and mutation frequencies at these positions is still required before any concrete conclusions can be made regarding the evolution of the CCM triplet in the human proteome and the discrepancy between it and the Swiss-Prot database. However, as an interesting aside, recent research has identified several proteins that contain the CCM triplet; however, the function of CCM, if any, has not been characterized [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] .",

It is our hope that these unique two residue motifs could be used as a means of identifying a virus such as SARS. While currently impossible to determine, one can see a possible clinical use for determining the frequency of CC or CM pairs in an individual. If a person has been infected by SARS, we would expect the numbers of CC and CM pairs to be much higher than in a healthy individual. If we were then able to develop a clinically feasible technique that could identify the CC or CM pair content in total cellular protein, without damaging the cell, it could be possible to implement a detection method simply by counting the numbers of CC or CM pairs in all proteins examined. If the presence of increased CC or CM pairs was indicative of infection by SARS we could develop new drugs to inhibit the translation of proteins that contain these pairs within infected cells. As a very specific example, this could be accomplished through the use of specific tRNA mimics that could block translating ribosome when these pairs appear at the P and A site simultaneously [24, 25] . While tRNA mimics could normally be seen as non-specific protein synthesis inhibitors, the lower frequency of the CC or CM motifs in host proteins as compared to the relatively high occurrence in viral protein provide a starting point for the analysis of treatments using methods such as these.",

Our focus in this quest has been to examine specific pairs or triplets of residues and use probability theory to assess whether or not particular strings of residues occur more frequently than their probability would indicate. By analyzing affinity and anti-affinity, we developed a procedure to search out all two-and three-residue clusters within these databases. Through this technique, we can rapidly classify large groups of proteins into families based on the occurrence of these motifs. Combining this concept with a specific knowledge of protein function, we propose novel ideas aimed at developing fast detection methods for specific diseases based on the unusually high occurrence of some of these motifs when compared with the expected probabilities. A timely example of the application of this method is given, namely the analysis of the SARS virus. This method will hopefully lead to the discovery of new diagnostic techniques and possible treatment of diseases, by recognizing the location of target domains in the expressed sequence.",

Proteins are ordered based upon their total CC content in relation to the total number of cysteine residues and the overall length of the protein.For D \u00bc 3, we have a much simpler method to determine that a protein sequence is both C-and CC-rich if So, a much simpler method to test whether a protein is a both C-and CC-rich for D \u00bc 3 isNumber of CC \u00c2 4:144 Number of C, Number of C \u00c2 164 Length of protein.Using this principle, we can get a total of 65 proteins that are both C-and CC-rich within the entire Swiss-Prot database.For D \u00bc 1, there is also an easier method to determine if a protein sequence is both C-and CC-rich sequence when So, a much simpler method to test whether a protein is both C-and CC-rich for D \u00bc 1 is based on the inequalities Number of CC \u00c2 114 Number of C, Number of C \u00c2 254Length of protein.",
