Aptamers possess key advantages over antibodies due to their increased flexibility and the nature of in vitro evolution. They have low variability between batches, do not rely on animals for their production, can be created against toxic or non-immunogenic targets, are economical and fast to produce, and can be synthesized against a complex target without prior knowledge of a specific target molecule or without purifying a known target molecule.",

            "text": "2.1. Selection of aptamers against purified molecular targets Aptamers can be evolved via an iterative process called Systematic Evolution of Ligands by Exponential Enrichment (SELEX). Different SELEX methodologies have been previously reviewed [8] . Briefly, a singlestranded random DNA or RNA library containing 10 14 -10 16 unique sequences is incubated with a target of interest. The target-bound and unbound nucleic-acid sequences are separated, and the target-bound sequences are amplified for use as inputs in the next round of selection. The random nucleic-acid library typically contains 40-100 nucleotide (nt) single-stranded sequences with a randomized stretch of nts in the center and fixed primer sequences on either end. As many as 20 rounds of selection are carried out until a pool of aptamer sequences with high target affinity is obtained. These aptamers can then be cloned and sequenced. Most aptamers selected against pathogenic targets have been evolved using purified target molecules, using the common SELEX procedures (Fig. 1 ). It is easier to obtain high-affinity aptamers in fewer rounds of SELEX with a purified target. Various bacterial or viral molecules have been used, mostly proteins. Carbohydrates have also been targeted including the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) of E. coli O111:H4 and cell-surface extracts of C. jejuni [9] [10] [11] . Table 1 summarizes molecules purified from pathogens against which aptamers have been selected. The use of amino-acid side-chain mimics in nt structure is a recent breakthrough that has allowed aptamers to be selected against previously impossible protein targets [12] . In the future, aptamers incorporating such chemical modifications will probably expand the SELEX target repertoire even further.",

Bacterial cells present unique challenges over mammalian cells due to their cell-wall structure. Gramnegative bacteria possess a negatively-charged outer membrane that can repel nucleic-acid molecules. Capsules covering the surface of many pathogenic bacteria can also obscure target proteins. Both of these factors make it difficult to generate aptamers that bind to the surface molecules of bacterial cells. In addition, bacteria often grow much faster than culture cells of mammalian tissue. Short generation times lead to rapid changes in protein expression and high surface variation between cultures and colonies. Such variation can impede consistent measurement of aptamer binding.",

Briefly, pathogenic bacterial cells are incubated in solution with a randomized nucleic-acid library. Cell-bound nucleic acids are separated from unbound nucleic acids via centrifugation. Cells are then washed, and cell-bound nucleic acids are eluted using low salt concentrations at high temperature. Cell-bound aptamers can also be amplified directly from the cell surface. Aptamer pools obtained after each round are screened for increased target-cellbinding affinity (e.g., by flow-cytometry analysis). Rounds of counter-selection against non-target cells, in which the sequences bound to the nontarget cells are removed, can be introduced after the first two rounds of positive selection. Alternatively, positive selection and counter-selection rounds can be alternated. These studies demonstrated the feasibility of selecting aptamers for both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.

Gold and colleagues [12, 92] developed a new generation of aptamers, termed SOMAmers, with two key innovations, utilizing chemically modified nts to generate SOMAmers with protein-like properties and employing kinetic manipulations to improve the specificity of SOMAmers. Fig. 3 shows a SOMAmer-selection process. The process begins with incorporation of modified nts (four dUTP analogs) into the DNA library by polymerase extension of a primer annealed to a biotinylated template. After separation from biotinylated templates, the DNA library containing modified nts is incubated with the target molecule. The slow off-rate enrichment and partition process is subsequently performed with the partition step of high stringency, including the use of extensive washing with large volumes. After separation of the bound DNA from the unbound DNA, the enriched DNA sequences are amplified by PCR to prepare the DNA pool for the next round of selection. Because the chemically-modified dUTP analogs in the modified DNA library and the enriched DNA pools contain functional groups that mimic amino-acid side-chains, the SOMAmers generated are thought to have some ''protein-like'' properties [12] . The expanded chemical diversity due to the incorporation of the modified nts extends SELEX to selection of aptamers against more difficult targets (e.g., carbohydrates on microbial cell surface and wide range of protein targets). Indeed, huge potential has been demonstrated from the success of obtaining aptamers (with pool Kd values below 30 nM) against 1200 human proteins [12] .",

The utility of the SOMAmer assay was demonstrated by measuring 813 different proteins with pM levels of LODs and 7 logs of overall dynamic range. SOMAmer arrays have been successfully applied to identify novel biomarkers and proteome profiles in chronic kidney disease and non-small-cell lung cancer. Both SOMAmer selection and array technology could potentially be developed for pathogen surveillance, typing of pathogen species and strain, and detection of microbial infection. They could enable comparison of proteome profiles between pathogens or infected and healthy individuals. Another exciting application could be high-throughput, multiplex antimicrobial resistance screening or comparison of antibiotic resistance profiles of different bacterial species or strains. Also, comparison of proteome profiles between patients could be used for diagnosis of infection and identification of potential treatment options.",

Such targets include purified cell-surface components and whole cells. Aptamers have shown promise in pathogen detection, collection, and therapy. Existing diagnostic and detection technologies have been modified to include aptamers targeting bacteria and viruses. In addition, a variety of novel aptamer-based assays have been developed for pathogen detection. Many existing aptamer-based assays initially designed for cancer cells could also be used for bacterially or virally-infected cells. The assays simply need to be modified to include aptamers against pathogenic targets in lieu of cancer-related targets.",
