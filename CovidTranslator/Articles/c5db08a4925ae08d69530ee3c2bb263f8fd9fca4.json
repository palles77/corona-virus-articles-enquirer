However, little is currently known about the biology of SARS-CoV-2. Here, using SARS-CoV-2 S protein pseudovirus system, we confirm that human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) is the receptor for SARS-CoV-2, find that SARS-CoV-2 enters 293/hACE2 cells mainly through endocytosis, that PIKfyve, TPC2, and cathepsin L are critical for entry, and that SARS-CoV-2 S protein is less stable than SARS-CoV S. Polyclonal anti-SARS S1 antibodies T62 inhibit entry of SARS-CoV S but not SARS-CoV-2 S pseudovirions. Further studies using recovered SARS and COVID-19 patients' sera show limited cross-neutralization, suggesting that recovery from one infection might not protect against the other. Our results present potential targets for development of drugs and vaccines for SARS-CoV-2. | www.nature.com/naturecommunications 1234567890():,; C oronaviruses (CoVs) infect human and animals and cause varieties of diseases, including respiratory, enteric, renal, and neurological diseases 1 . They are classified into four genera, alpha-CoV, beta-CoV, gamma-CoV, and delta-CoV 2 . Since beginning of this century, there have already been three zoonotic outbreaks of beta-CoVs. In 2002-2003, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) 3,4 , a lineage B beta-CoV, emerged from bat and palm civet 5,6 , and infected over 8000 people and caused about 800 deaths 7 . In 2012, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), a lineage C beta-CoV, was discovered as the causative agent of a severe respiratory syndrome in Saudi Arabia 8 , currently with 2494 confirmed cases and 858 deaths 9 , it remains endemic in Middle East, and dromedary camel is considered as the zoonotic reservoir host of MERS-CoV. At the end of 2019, a novel coronavirus, named SARS-CoV-2, was found in patients with severe pneumonia in Wuhan, China 10-12 . Viruses were isolated from patients and sequenced. Phylogenetical analysis revealed that it is a lineage B beta-CoV and closely related to a SARS-like (SL) CoV, RaTG13, discovered in a cave of Yunnan, China, in 2013 13 . They share about 96% nucleotide sequence identities, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 might have emerged from a Bat SL-CoV. However, the intermediate host or whether there is an intermediate host remains to be determined.",

Each monomer of trimeric S protein is about 180 kDa, and contains two subunits, S1 and S2, mediating attachment and membrane fusion, respectively. In the structure, N-and C-terminal portions of S1 fold as two independent domains, N-terminal domain (NTD) and C-terminal domain (C-domain) (Fig. 1a) . Depending on the virus, either NTD or Cdomain can serve as the receptor-binding domain (RBD). While RBD of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) is located at the NTD 14 , most of other CoVs, including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV use C-domain to bind their receptors [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] . MHV uses mouse carcinoembryonic antigen related cell adhesion molecule 1a (mCEA-CAM1a) as the receptor 20 , and the receptors for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) 21 and human dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (hDPP4) 22 , respectively. While S proteins of SARS-CoV-2 share about 76% and 97% of amino acid identities with SARS-CoV and RaTG13, respectively, the amino acid sequence of potential RBD of SARS-CoV-2 is only about 74% and 90.1% homologous to that of respectively. Recently, Zhou et al. 13 reported that SARS-CoV-2 uses hACE2 as the receptor.",

There were two major bands, 180 kDa, and 90 kDa, detected by mouse anti-FLAG M2 antibody (Fig. 1b, lane 2) , reflecting the full-length and cleaved S proteins, respectively. The band above 250 kDa likely results from dimeric or trimeric S proteins.

VSV-G pseudovirons were used as a positive control, whereas bald particles with no spike proteins (mock) served as a negative control. As expected, all cell types were effectively transduced by VSV-G pseudovirons (Fig. 2a) . Compared to mock control, SARS-CoV-2 S pseudovirions showed an over 500-fold increase in luciferase activities in Calu3 cells, at a level similar to SARS-CoV S pseudovirions (Fig. 2a) . Huh7 and Vero 81 cells also gave about 10-fold increase in luciferase activities when transduced by SARS-CoV-2. Transduction of LLCMK2 cells was higher with SARS-CoV S pseudovirions than with SARS-CoV-2 S pseudovirions (Fig. 2a) , suggesting that there might be some differences on virus entry on LLCMK2 cells mediated by S proteins between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV. We then investigated whether any known CoV receptors might be used by SARS-CoV-2 S protein as entry receptor. The SARS-CoV-2 S pseudovirons were used to transduce BHK cells stably expressing human aminopeptidase N (hAPN), the receptor for human CoV 229E, 293 cells stably expressing hACE2 (293/hACE2), the receptor for SARS-CoV, and HeLa cells stably expressing hDPP4 (HeLa/hDPP4), the receptor for MERS-CoV. While BHK/hAPN and HeLa/hDPP4 cells were not susceptible for the transduction of SARS-CoV-2 S pseudovirions, 293/hACE2 cells were highly transduced by SARS-CoV-2 S pseudovirions, consistent with hACE2 as the receptor for SARS-CoV-2 13 . We then determined whether SARS-CoV-2 S protein could directly bind to hACE2 protein. HEK 293T cells transiently expressing SARS-CoV-2 S protein were incubated with soluble hACE2 and analyzed by flow cytometry. As shown in Fig. 2c , SARS-CoV-2 S protein bound to soluble hACE2 at a level similar to SARS-CoV S protein, although the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) for SARS-CoV-2 S protein was slightly lower than SARS-CoV S protein. To further investigate if hACE2 is the receptor for SARS-CoV-2, we performed inhibition experiments using soluble hACE2. Soluble hACE2 proteins were pre-incubated with SARS-CoV-2 S pseudovirons on ice for 1 h, then virus-protein mixture was added onto 293/hACE2 cells. Entry of SARS-CoV-2 S pseudovirions was significantly prevented by pre-incubation of soluble hACE2 at both 10 \u03bcg/ml and 50 \u03bcg/ml (Fig. 2d) , further supporting the notion that hACE2 is the receptor and soluble hACE2 might be used as a therapeutic inhibitor against SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

Similar inhibitory effects were observed when HeLa/hDPP4 cells and HeLa cells stably expressing mouse carcinoembryonic antigen related cell adhesion molecule 1a (mCEACAM1a) (HeLa/mCEACAM1a) were treated with apilimod and transduced with MERS-CoV and MHV S pseudovirions (Fig. 3b) , respectively. Moreover, infection of live MHV on 17Cl.1 cells was also strongly inhibited by apilimod treatment (Fig. 3c ). No significant cell toxicity was observed on apilimod at any concentration tested (Fig. 3c) . We then determined whether apilimod could inhibit entry of SARS-CoV-2 S pseudovirions on 293/hACE2. As expected, apilimod treatment inhibited entry of SARS-CoV-2 S pseudovirions in a dose dependent manner (Fig. 3d) . Similar effects were shown when 293/ hACE2 cells were treated with YM201636, another PIKfyve inhibitor (Fig. 3e) . These results suggested that PIKfyve might be a potential general drug target for viruses that enter cells through endocytosis.

Protease activation on S protein is an important step for coronavirus entry, and cathepsins in lysosome have been shown to be critical for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV entry through endocytosis. To investigate whether cathepsins are required for SARS-CoV-2 entry, HEK 293/hACE2 cells were treated with either a broad inhibitor for cathepsin B, H, L, and calpain (E64D), cathepsin L inhibitor (SID 26681509), or cathepsin B inhibitor (CA-074). VSV-G pseudovirions were used as a negative control, since virus entry mediated by VSV-G does not require protease activation. E64D treatment of 293/hACE2 cells reduced entry of SARS-CoV-2 S pseudovirions by 92.5%, indicating that at least one of cathepsins or calpain might be required for SARS-CoV-2 entry (Fig. 4a) . While cathepsin B inhibitor treatment did not show any marked effect on virus entry, cathepsin L inhibition treatment decreased entry of SARS-CoV-2 S pseudovirions into 293/hACE2 by over 76% (Fig. 4a) , suggesting that cathepsin L should be essential for priming of SARS-CoV-2 S protein in lysosome for entry into 293/hACE2 cells.",

Expression of TMPRSS 2, 4, 11 A, 11D, and 11E on 293/hACE2 cells enhanced SARS-CoV-2 S protein-mediated cell-cell fusion similarly to SASR-CoV S ( Supplementary Fig. 2 ). Next we evaluated the role of trypsin. Consistent to our previous report 23 , addition of trypsin triggered syncytium formation on 293/hACE2 cells by SARS-CoV S protein after 4 h incubation (Fig. 4b, c) . Large syncytia were formed at a level similar to SARS-CoV S proteins when SARS-CoV-2 S protein expressing 293T cells were added onto 293/hACE2 cells with trypsin. Of note, SARS-CoV-2, but not SARS-CoV, S proteins induced syncytia formation on 293/hACE2 cells even in the absence of trypsin (Fig. 4c) , suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 S proteins could be triggered upon the receptor binding without exogenous protease priming or activation. During 2013-2016 Ebola virus outbreak, A82V and T544I mutations in glycoprotein (gp) of Ebola virus were linked to increase of virus transmissibility [40] [41] [42] . Further study showed that A82V and T544I mutation decreases the thermostability of gp while they increases virus infectivity in cell culture 42 . We then investigated the thermostability of SARS-CoV-2 S protein.",

            "text": "HEK293T cells transiently expressing SARS-CoV-2 S proteins were incubated with polyclonal anti-SARS S1 antibodies T62 and analyzed by flow cytometry. SARS-CoV S was used as a positive control. As expected, expression of SARS-CoV S proteins on 293T cell surface were readily detected by polyclonal anti-SARS S1 antibodies T62 (Fig. 5a ). In contrast, only low level of binding of SARS-CoV-2 S protein to polyclonal rabbit anti-SARS S1 antibodies T62 was detected (Fig. 5a) . To further delineate where the conformational epitopes for this polyclonal antibodies are located, two new constructs were generated, a SARS-CoV S protein backbone with RBD from SARS-CoV-2 (SARS-CoV S/nRBD) and a SARS-CoV-2 S protein backbone with RBD from SARS-CoV (SARS-CoV-2 S/sRBD). Replacement of SARS-CoV RBD with SARS-CoV-2 RBD (SARS-CoV S/nRBD) decreased binding of polyclonal antibodies T62 to S protein, whereas substitution of SARS-CoV-2 RBD with SARS-CoV RBD (SARS-CoV-2 S/sRBD) increased the affinity of S protein to polyclonal antibodies T62 (Fig. 5a) . All chimera proteins were expressed at levels similar to SARS-CoV-2 S protein (Fig. 5b, top panel) . These results suggest that at least one major conformational epitope for polyclonal antibodies T62 might be located in RBD where the sequences differ between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. 5c ). Of note, while SARS-CoV-2 S/sRBD bound to polyclonal antibodies T62 better than SARS-CoV S/nRBD in flow cytometry, the signal for SARS-CoV S/nRBD was stronger than SARS-CoV-2 S/sRBD in western blot by polyclonal antibodies T62, indicating that major linear epitopes of polyclonal antibodies T62 were located on SARS-CoV NTD. Among residues in SARS-CoV RBD critical for receptor binding and virus entry 43, 44 , seven of them are different between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 RBDs (Fig. 5c) . We then mutated each of them in SARS-CoV S protein to the corresponding residues in SARS-CoV-2 S. With exception of SARS-CoV mutant Y442L, which had reduced protein expression ( Supplementary Fig. 3) , binding of SARS-CoV S mutants to polyclonal rabbit anti-SARS S1 antibodies T62 was not affected (Fig. 5d ). This suggests that these residues might not be direct binding sites for polyclonal antibodies T62. Next, we tested whether polyclonal rabbit anti-SARS S1 antibodies T62 could inhibit entry of SARS-CoV-2 S pseudovirions. CoV S protein pseudovirions were incubated with polyclonal antibodies T62 on ice for 1 h, and their transduction was measured according to luciferase activities. As expected, polyclonal antibodies T62 neutralized SARS-CoV S pseudovirion effectively in a dose dependent manner (Fig. 5e ). In contrast, even at a concentration of 50 \u03bcg/ml, polyclonal antibodies T62 did not have marked effect on transduction by SARS-CoV-2 S proteins (Fig. 5e) .",

            "text": "Cross-neutralization of SARS and COVID-19 patient sera. As rabbit polyclonal anti-SARS S1 antibodies did not show significant neutralization activity against SARS-CoV-2 S pseudovirions, we then asked whether sera from recovered SARS and COVID-19 patients could neutralize SARS-CoV S and SARS-CoV-2 S pseudovirions. We obtained sera from one recovered SARS patient and five recovered COVID-19 patients and tested their neutralization activities against transduction on 293/hACE2 cells by SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 S pseudovirions. Serum from recovered SARS patient showed strong inhibition on transduction by SARS-CoV S pseudovirions, and it had modest neutralization activity against SARS-CoV-2 S pseudovirons ( Fig. 6a and Table 1 ). In contrast, sera from all five COVID-19 patients neutralized SARS-CoV-2 S pseudovirions effectively, and none of them had an effect on transduction by SARS-CoV S pseudovirions ( Fig. 6b and Table 1 ). Discussion About 70% of the emerging pathogens infecting humans originate from animals, and CoVs are among the forefronts of these pathogens 45 . The newly emerged SARS-CoV-2 infects human and causes severe pneumonia, and as of 10 February, 2020, the current outbreak has spread to 25 countries with over 40,000 confirmed cases and 900 deaths 46 . However, little is known about its biology. Since the virus is categorized as a biosafety level 3 (BSL3) agent, according to WHO guideline, we developed a pseudotype system with S protein of SARS-CoV-2 to study virus entry in BSL2 settings. Understanding how SARS-CoV-2 enters cell will provide valuable information for virus pathogenesis, vaccine design, and drug target. Polyclonal anti-SARS S1 antibodies T62 Utilizing this pseudotype system, we screened a panel of human and monkey cell lines for their susceptibility of SARS-CoV-2 S-mediated transduction. In line with SASR-CoV-2 causing respiratory infections in humans, we found that human lung cancer cell line Calu3 is highly susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 Smediated entry. LLCMK2 cells, a rhesus monkey kidney epithelium cell line, exhibited different susceptibility to SARS-CoV S and SARS-CoV-2 S transduction, but the reasons for this are currently not known and require further investigation. Both S proteins use hACE2 as the receptor for binding and entry 13, 21 , which we further confirmed by flow cytometry analysis and competitive inhibition experiment using soluble hACE2 in this study (Fig. 3b, c) . While full-length S proteins of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV S share almost 76% identities in amino acid sequences, the NTDs show only 53.5% of homology. Of note, NTDs of different CoVs S proteins have been shown to bind different sugar. While NTD of MERS-CoV prefers \u03b12,3-linked sialic acid over \u03b12,6-linked sialic acid 47 , NTDs of human CoVs OC43 and HKU1 bind to 9-O-acetylated sialic acids 48, 49 . No sugar binding has been reported for NTD of SARS-CoV. Whether or not NTD of SARS-CoV-2 binds to sugar and whether sugar binding of NTD affects virus entry remains to be determined.",

There is a furin site between S1 and S2 (amino acids 682-685, RRAR) subunits in SARS-CoV-2 S protein, similar to what happens in high-pathogenic influenza viruses. Whether the presence of this furin site has any effect on viral pathogenesis and virus spreading among humans remains to be determined. Although majority of SARS-CoV-2 S proteins in pseuodvirions were cleaved, endocytosis is the main entry pathway on 293/hACE2 cell. In our experiments, lysosomal cathepsin L, not B, appeared critical for SARS-CoV-2 S protein activation, similar to what was reported for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV 28, 29, 50 . Trypsin could also activate SARS-CoV-2 S protein efficiently and induce large syncytium formation.

This led us to speculate that SARS-CoV-2 S protein is capable of triggering protease-independent and receptor-dependent syncytium formation. Such a mechanism might enhance virus spreading through cell-cell fusion and this might partially explain rapid progress of the diseases 10, 11 . However, we have not excluded a potential role for other endogenous proteases in HEK293T cells for syncytium formation and we have also not evaluated entry into other cell types. This requires further research. Recent studies showed that early to late endosome maturation is regulated by PI(3,5)P 2 , and inhibition of PIKfyve, the key enzyme synthesizing PI(3,5)P 2 , and TPC2, a downstream effector in lysosome, significantly reduced virus entry of MERS-CoV 52 . We confirmed this in this study, and further showed that blocking PIKfyve and TPC2 also strongly inhibited entry mediated by SARS-CoV-2 S protein, indicating that PI(3,5)P 2 pathway might be considered as potential general drug target for CoV infection.",

We only saw moderate cross-neutralization activities between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV convalescent sera, suggesting that those previously recovered from SARS-CoV infection may not be fully protected against SARS-CoV-2 infection, and vice versa.",

Finally, there was limited cross-neutralization activity between convalescent sera from SARS and COVID-19 patients. Our findings provide potential targets for development of drugs and vaccines against this newly emerging lineage B beta-CoV.",
