To day in Canada the virus is endemic and antibodies can be demonstrated, but the disease syndrome is no longer evident (5). ",

One is known as vomiting and wasting disease and the other involves an encephalomyelitis. B. Host: Pigs. C. Areas free of the virus: Unknown. D. Key developments: Vomiting and wasting disease (13) and encepha lomyelitis (1) were initially reported as two separate diseases in Canada in the late 1950s. The virus was isolated in 1962(7)and the common etiology of the two syndromes was shown in 1969(3).",
