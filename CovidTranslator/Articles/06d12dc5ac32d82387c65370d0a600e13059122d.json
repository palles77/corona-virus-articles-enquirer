Our literature and clinical trial survey showed that the whole virus, as well as the 19 spike (S) protein, nucleocapsid (N) protein, and membrane (M) protein, have been tested for 20 vaccine development against SARS and MERS. However, these vaccine candidates might lack 21 the induction of complete protection and have safety concerns. We then applied the Vaxign 22 reverse vaccinology tool and the newly developed Vaxign-ML machine learning tool to predict 23 COVID-19 vaccine candidates. By investigating the entire proteome of SARS-CoV-2, six 24 proteins, including the S protein and five non-structural proteins (nsp3, 3CL-pro, and nsp8-10), 25 were predicted to be adhesins, which are crucial to the viral adhering and host invasion. The S, 26 nsp3, and nsp8 proteins were also predicted by Vaxign-ML to induce high protective 27 antigenicity. Besides the commonly used S protein, the nsp3 protein has not been tested in any 28 coronavirus vaccine studies and was selected for further investigation. The nsp3 was found to be 29 more conserved among SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV than among 15 30 coronaviruses infecting human and other animals. The protein was also predicted to contain 31 promiscuous MHC-I and MHC-II T-cell epitopes, and linear B-cell epitopes localized in specific 32 locations and functional domains of the protein. By applying reverse vaccinology and machine 33 learning, we predicted potential vaccine targets for effective and safe COVID-19 vaccine 34 development. We then propose that an \"Sp/Nsp cocktail vaccine\" containing a structural 35 protein(s) (Sp) and a non-structural protein(s) (Nsp) would stimulate effective complementary 36 immune responses. 37 38 39 40",

The nsp3 is the largest non-238 structural protein that includes multiple functional domains related to viral pathogenesis 29 . The 239 multiple sequence alignment of nsp3 also showed higher sequence conservation in most of the 240 functional domains in SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV, than in all 15 coronavirus 241 strains (Fig. 1B) . Besides the nsp3 protein, our study also predicted four additional non-structural 242 proteins (3CL-pro, nsp8, nsp9, and nsp10) as possible vaccine candidates based on their adhesin 243 probabilities, and the nsp8 protein was also predicted to have a significant protective antigenicity 244 score. 245",

Although structural proteins are commonly used as 248 viral vaccine candidates, non-structural proteins correlates to vaccine protection. The non-249 structural protein NS1 was found to induce protective immunity against the infections by 250 flaviviruses 36 . Since NS1 is not part of the virion, antibodies against NS1 have no neutralizing 251 activity but some exhibit complement-fixing activity 37 . However, passive transfer of anti-NS1 252 antibody or immunization with NS1 conferred protection 38 . Anti-NS1 antibody could also reduce 253 might induce cell-mediated or humoral immunity necessary to prevent viral invasion and/or 262 replication. None of the non-structural proteins have been evaluated as vaccine candidates, and the 263 feasibilit of these proteins as vaccine targets are subject to further experimental verification. 264",

The licensed Group B meningococcus Bexsero vaccine, which was developed via 268 reverse vaccinology, contains three protein antigens 12 . To develop an efficient and safe COVID-269 19 cocktail vaccine, an \"Sp/Nsp cocktail vaccine\", which mixes a structural protein(s) (Sp, such 270 as S protein) and a non-structural protein(s) (Nsp, such as nsp3) could induce more favorable 271 protective immune responses than vaccines expressing a structural protein(s). The benefit of a 272 cocktail vaccine strategy could induce immunity that can protect the host against not only the S-273 ACE2 interaction and viral entry to the host cells, but also protect against the accessary non-274 structural adhesin proteins (e.g., nsp3), which might also be vital to the viral entry and replication. 275The usage of more than one antigen allows us to reduce the volume of each antigen and thus to 276 reduce the induction of adverse events. Nonetheless, the potentials of the proposed \"Sp/Nsp 277 cocktail vaccine\" strategy need to be experimentally validated.278 For rational COVID-19 vaccine development, it is critical to understand the fundamental 279 host-coronavirus interaction and protective immune mechanism 7 . Such understanding may not 280 only provide us guidance in terms of antigen selection but also facilitate our design of vaccine 281 formulations. For example, an important foundation of our prediction in this study is based on our 282 understanding of the critical role of adhesin as a virulence factor as well as protective antigen. The 283 choice of DNA vaccine, recombinant vaccine vector, and another method of vaccine formulation 284 is also deeply rooted in our understanding of pathogen-specific immune response induction. 285 Different experimental conditions may also affect results 44,45 . Therefore, it is crucial to understand 286 the underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms for rational vaccine development. 287 288 Methods 289 Annotation of literature and database records. We annotated peer-reviewed journal articles 290 stored in the PubMed database and the ClinicalTrials.gov database. From the peer-reviewed 291 articles, we identified and annotated those coronavirus vaccine candidates that were 292 prediction. The SARS-CoV-2 sequence was obtained from NCBI. All the proteins of six 296 known human coronavirus strains, including SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, HCoV-229E, HCoV-297 OC43, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-HKU1 were extracted from Uniprot proteomes 46 . The full 298 proteomes of these seven coronaviruses were then analyzed using the Vaxign reverse vaccinology 299 pipeline 15,19 .

The ML-based RV prediction model was built following a similar 303 methodology described in the Vaxign-ML 19 .

There were 4,979 negative 306 samples extracted from the corresponding pathogens' Uniprot proteomes 46 with sequence dis-307 similarity to the PAgs, as described in previous studies 50-52 . Homologous proteins in the negative 308 samples were also removed. The proteins in the resulting dataset were annotated with biological 309 and physicochemical features.

The physicochemical features included the 311 compositions, transitions and distributions 54 , quasi-sequence-order 55 , Moreau-Broto auto-312 correlation 56,57 , and Geary auto-correlation 58 of various physicochemical properties such as charge, 313 hydrophobicity, polarity, and solvent accessibility 59 .

The immunogenicity of the nsp3 protein was evaluated by the 332 prediction of T cell MHC-I and MHC-II, and linear B cell epitopes. For T cell MHC-I epitopes, 333 the IEDB consensus method was used to predicting promiscuous epitopes binding to 4 out of 27 334 MHC-I reference alleles with consensus percentile ranking less than 1.0 score 53 . For T cell MHC-335 II epitopes, the IEDB consensus method was used to predicting promiscuous epitopes binding to 336 more than half of the 27 MHC-II reference alleles with consensus percentile ranking less than 10.0. 337The MHC-I and MHC-II reference alleles covered a wide range of human genetic variation 338 representing the majority of the world population 66,67 . The linear B cell epitopes were predicted 339 using the BepiPred 2.0 with a cutoff of 0.55 score 68 .

Extensive effort has been made to 116 develop a safe and effective vaccine against SARS or MERS, and the most advance clinical trial 117 study is currently at phase II(Table 1). It is a challenging task to quickly develop a safe and 118 effective vaccine for the on-going COVID-19 pandemic. 119 There are two primary design strategies for coronavirus vaccine development: the usage 120 of the whole virus or genetically engineered vaccine antigens that can be delivered through 121 different formats. The whole virus vaccines include inactivated 20 or live attenuated vaccines 21,22 122 (Table 2). The two live attenuated SARS vaccines mutated the exoribonuclease and envelop 123 protein to reduce the virulence and/or replication capability of the SARS-CoV. Overall, the 124 whole virus vaccines can induce a strong immune response and protect against coronavirus 125 infections. Genetically engineered vaccines that target specific coronavirus protein are often used 126 to improve vaccine safety and efficacy. The coronavirus antigens such as S protein, N protein, 127 and M protein can be delivered as recombinant DNA vaccine and viral vector vaccine",
