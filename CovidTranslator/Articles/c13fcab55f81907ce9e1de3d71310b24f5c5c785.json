            "text": "Peptide stapling is a technique which has been widely employed to constrain the conformation of peptides. One of the effects of such a constraint can be to modulate the interaction of the peptide with a binding partner. Here, a cysteine bis-alkylation stapling technique was applied to generate structurally isomeric peptide variants of a heterodimeric coiled-coil forming peptide. These stapled variants differed in the position and size of the formed macrocycle. C-terminal stapling showed the most significant changes in peptide structure and stability, with calorimetric binding analysis showing a significant reduction of binding entropy for stapled variants. This entropy reduction was dependent on cross-linker size and was accompanied by a change in binding enthalpy, illustrating the effects of preorganization. The stapled peptide, along with its binding partner, were subsequently employed as fusogens in a liposome model system. An increase in both lipid-and content-mixing was observed for one of the stapled peptide variants: this increased fusogenicity was attributed to increased coiled-coil binding but not to membrane affinity, an interaction theorized to be a primary driving force in this fusion system.",

            "text": "Intramolecular cross-linking of peptides, commonly referred to as peptide stapling, is often employed to change or constrain the secondary structure of small peptides and to induce unstructured peptides to mimic complex protein folds and protein\u2212protein interactions (PPIs). 1\u22124 Stapling also contributes to an increased resistance to denaturation and proteolytic degradation, making it a useful technique for the modification of peptide-based therapeutics. 5 Hydrocarbon stapling, a technique which is based on catalyzed olefin metathesis, has seen widespread application with multiple compounds being investigated in academic, preclinical, and clinical studies. 6\u221210 Peptide stapling techniques can be broadly divided into two categories: single-and two-component strategies. Singlecomponent strategies incorporate amino acids that can be cross-linked selectively, or protection strategies are chosen that allow selective cross-linking. Common single-component stapling strategies include disulfide bonding, 11 lactam bridges, 12, 13 and olefin metathesis. 10 Two-component stapling adds a bifunctional cross-linker to bridge two amino-acid side chains; the most common techniques are based on cysteine cross-linking and triazole linkages. 14\u221217 Two-component strategies are in principle more complex than singlecomponent strategies, but they allow for a more flexible cross-linker design, as it does not need to be compatible with solid-phase peptide synthesis. Although most stapling techniques are used to increase or constrain peptide helicity, systems that compare different methods are often based around short peptide sequences, and although multiple comparisons have been made, 18, 19 the ideal cross-linking technique is still open to debate. 20 The \u03b1-helix secondary structure motif has been mimicked using stapled peptides due to its common occurrence in proteins and therefore its potential as a PPI mimic. 21 Coiled coils, which are protein-folding motifs comprising two or more \u03b1-helices, are intrinsically helical, and therefore, techniques commonly used for the stapling of helices should permit modulation of coiled-coil interactions. Indeed, Rao et al. have shown lactam bridges can be used to generate short, helical, cFos binding peptides, 22 and Haney and Horne have used oxime cross-linking to generate stapled variants of the GCN4-p1 coiled-coil domain. 23 More recently, Wu et al. used a bistriazole stapling technique to increase peptide binding to the polymerase \u03b1 accessory factor ctf4, 15 and Lathbridge and Mason showed that lactam-bridged heptapeptides can be used for the de novo design of a coiled-coil binding peptide. 24 Together, these studies provide methods for the crosslinking of coiled-coil or coiled-coil-binding peptides, but it is unclear which method would prove to be the most effective when applied to a different coiled-coil system. The size of the macrocycle formed varies significantly between the different cross-linking techniques, as do the polarity and hydrophobicity of the cross-linkers in question. Interactions of the asymmetric oxime moiety with different amino acid side chains resulted in different binding strengths when the cross-linker was reversed in Haney and Horne's method. This necessitated the preparation and evaluation of both variants, and indicates oxime cross-linking effectiveness is dependent on amino acid composition.",

In addition, both membrane binding and coiled-coil formation depend on the peptides adopting a helical structure; we believe stapling should allow for the generation of peptides with varied helical structures, which will in turn affect coiled-coil formation and membrane binding interactions. Studying the effects of modulating the membrane interactions and coiled-coil binding affinity will generate insights into the importance of both factors in membrane fusion.",

            "text": "When attempting to modulate the behavior of the heterodimeric coiled coil used in our group, 30 the choice of cross-linking technique was not obvious, due to the differences observed in previously employed cross-linking techniques (vide supra). The position of the cross-linker and the macrocycle size were deemed the most influential characteristics in the previously mentioned cross-linking strategies; therefore, we wanted to evaluate both of these criteria independently for our system. The most favorable candidates could then be used to test the effect of structural changes on coiled-coil-based membrane fusion. One stapling strategy that attracted our attention was developed by the DeGrado lab, and it is based on the alkylation of cysteine using dibromoxylenes. 31 The advantage of this system lies in the rigidity provided by the aromatic ring, allowing precise spacing between the two thiol moieties by selecting one of the three different structural isomers of dibromoxylene: ortho, meta, and para; Scheme 1. In the original study, meta-xylene showed the most promise as a cross-linker, and further investigations in the same group have therefore focused on this variant. 32, 33 Other recent investigations have also predominantly used the meta derivative, 34, 35 and when a comparison was made between the isomers, only short or unstructured peptides were used. This means the question of whether, for a helical or coiled-coil peptide, metaxylene is indeed the best cross-linking moiety is unanswered. Therefore, to probe the effect of stapling on coiled-coil peptides, we elected to investigate dibromoxylene cross-linking of cysteines, employing all three structural isomers in order to elucidate the role of cross-linker size and its effect on structure and activity.",

These stapled K-peptide derivatives exhibited systematic variations in helicity and thermal stability, as observed by circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy. The coiled-coil binding thermodynamics were studied using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), and it was discovered that increased coiled-coil binding is based on a preorganization effect. These observed changes in structure and binding dynamics were heavily dependent on the location of the staple and the choice of cross-linker. In lipid-and content-mixing experiments, a significant change in fusogenicity was measured for selected stapled peptides, which was attributed to the altered coiled-coil interactions. Stapled Peptide Design. The starting point for structural modification is one peptide of a three-heptad heterodimeric coiled-coil pair first reported by Litowski and Hodges. 36 The two peptides are named after the abundance of either glutamic acid (Glu, E) or lysine (Lys, K), and each peptide contains a C-terminal glycine and either tyrosine or tryptophan as a fluorescent reporter, giving rise to E 3 GY and K 3 GW. To facilitate stapling, two amino acids in peptide K 3 GW were modified to cysteine, spaced i to i + 4 to best match a single \u03b1helical turn. Amino acids that are involved in electrostatic (positions e and g) or hydrophobic (positions a or d) interactions were not varied to ensure the stapled peptides retained the same stabilizing coiled-coil interactions as the parent peptides. Three different variants were generated each with the cysteines and therefore the staple, in a different heptad, Table 1 . Each of these positional variants was stapled with ortho-, meta-, and para-dibromoxylene, generating a library of nine stapled peptides. When referring to these stapled peptide variants, a notation which reflects the position and type of cross-linker is used, for example, K 3 GW-1M signifies the cross-linker is in the first heptad and the meta variant has been employed.",

CD spectroscopy was employed to determine the secondary structure of the stapled peptide variants; the effects of both the stapling location and the size of the cross-linker can be clearly observed, Figures 1 and S1. Peptide stapling close to the C-terminus (K 3 GW-3 variants) showed the largest increase in \u03b1-helicity for all three xylenes, whereas modification in the second heptad (K 3 GW-2 variants) showed the lowest increase. Notably, when paraxylene was used as the cross-linker in the second heptad, the overall peptide helicity was reduced, Figure 1B , showing paraxylene is too large to form an ideal \u03b1-helix. The N-terminal positions (K 3 GW-1 variants) all show a moderate increase in helicity, largely independent of staple size, confirming the previously observed trend for hydrocarbon stapling to be most effective at peptide termini. 37 Using temperature-dependent CD spectroscopy, an increase in melting temperature (T m ) could be determined for the stapled peptide variants, as shown in Figures 2 and S2 , with the change in T m closely following the observed changes in helicity. C-terminal modification showed the largest increase in melting temperature, with the ortho-xylene cross-linker yielding the most stable peptides over all three peptide variants, followed by the meta-xylene crosslinker. All stapled peptides interacted with E 3 GY, showing typical coiled-coil spectra as is evident in Figures 1C and S1.

Direct determination of the dissociation constant (K d ) and enthalpy of binding (\u0394H b ) and therefore calculation of the free energy (\u0394G b ) and entropy of binding (\u0394S b ) is possible using ITC ( Figure S3 ), allowing investigation of peptide interactions independent of peptide structure. 38 The results shown in Figure 3 and Table S3 show that, in general, coiled-coil binding of peptides K 3 GW and E 3 GY is strongly enthalpically favored but entropically unfavored. The effect of enthalpy can be explained via the formation of amide hydrogen bonds and electrostatic interactions upon folding of the peptide. When the C-terminally stapled variants of peptide K 3 GW are analyzed, the K d is decreased from 73 to 22 and 24 nM for the 3O and 3M variants, respectively, and to 51 nM for the 3P variant. A large decrease in \u0394S b was observed and was directly related to the size of the implemented staple. ortho-Xylene stapling at the C-terminus reduced the effect of entropy upon binding from 37 to 24 kJ/mol, a reduction of 35%. At the same time, an increase in the \u0394H b from \u221277 to \u221268 kJ/mol was observed, counteracting the observed entropic effects and leading to the conclusion that the mechanism of peptide stapling relies on a preorganization effect: through conformational restriction, the peptide is preorganized in a helical conformation which reduces the entropic effects of binding, but some of the energy that is gained upon formation of an \u03b1helix is also lost. Although the K d for the C-terminal ortho-and meta-xylene stapled peptides is comparable, the \u0394S b is more favorable for the ortho variant, explaining the large differences in T m observed for these two peptides. At all three stapling positions, the ortho variants show a reduced effect of entropy upon binding compared to the meta variants, which is likely caused by the smaller size of the ortho cross-linker. A smaller cross-linker restricts the maximum distance between the two helical turns and therefore limits the number of possible conformations that the peptide can assume.",

The effectiveness of E/ K-based membrane fusion is partially attributed to the membrane interactions of peptide K, which are theorized to induce membrane curvature and therefore accelerate the transition from membrane docking to hemifusion. 41 The interactions of peptide K with lipid membranes are based on a lysine snorkeling mechanism, which describes the hydrophobic amino acids in the \"a\" and \"d\" position inserting in a lipid membrane, helped by the favorable electrostatic interactions between lysines and the phosphate groups of the lipid membrane. 42 This is a reversible process that can only happen when the peptide folds into an amphipathic helix and all the hydrophobic amino acids are positioned on the same face. Peptide stapling, which changes the overall peptide conformation, is therefore theorized to have an effect on membrane binding. The membrane partition coefficient (K p ) of the stapled K variants was assayed via tryptophan fluorescence titration experiments, and the results are shown in Figure 4 . Membrane binding was either comparable to that of unmodified K 3 GW or was increased up to a factor of 2 and did not show any correlation to the location of the staple or to the overall helicity of the peptide ( Figure S4 ). The difference in partition coefficient between K 3 GW-3O and K 3 GW-3M is striking, as the value is almost half for the ortho variant despite the helicity of the two being very similar.

Membrane fusion occurs in multiple stages, starting with the docking of two membranes to create a membrane fusion interface, followed by hemifusion which results in the mixing of the outer lipid leaflets, and proceeding via the formation of a fusion pore to complete fusion of the two liposomes, meaning their contents are exchanged. 27 Both lipid-and content-mixing experiments showed increased fusiogenicity for the lipidated K 3 GW-3O peptide, with increased content mixing also observed for the K 3 GW-3M variant. Differences in the lipid-mixing amount are obvious after 6 min, indicating that the rates of initial docking and outer leaflet mixing are comparable for the three peptides. Because complete fusion of the liposomes, as judged by content mixing, is increased significantly for the K 3 GW-3O variant, the observed difference in lipid mixing is most likely caused by an increased mixing of the inner leaflet lipids.

The K d of coiled-coil formation is dependent on the association and dissociation rate constants, which show different behavior in temperature dependent stopped-flow experiments of coiled-coil peptides. 44 The dissociation rate was shown to be more dependent on temperature and therefore had a much larger entropic component then the rate of association. The stapled peptide variants tested have a decreased entropic binding component and should therefore also show a lower rate of dissociation. At a membrane fusion interface, dissociation of the coiled-coil is most likely followed either by another peptide binding event or by the insertion of peptide K into the lipid membrane. A decrease in the dissociation rate should therefore result in an increase in the rate of fusion, although the total amount of fusion observed is not expected to change.",

            "text": "For SNARE-mediated membrane fusion, it is known that multiple protein complexes are required to drive fusion of a single vesicle, and the likelihood of fusion occurring is dependent on the number of protein complexes at the fusion interface. 45, 46 This cooperativity is likely also necessary for our coiled-coil based system, and any interactions that influence the amount of coiled-coils that can be coassembled around a fusion interface will influence the amount of fusion observed. In this case, both K3GW-3O and K3GW-3M show increased binding and lowered binding entropy and therefore increased fusion via a lower dissociation rate. For K 3 GW-3M, this difference is less significant and is likely to be partially counteracted by the increased membrane affinity of the peptide. This is a competitive interaction in the formation of the coiled-coil complex, and an interaction which can provide a pathway for dissipation of the free peptide after dissociation of the coiled coil. 41 In this manner, the total number of peptide complexes that are formed around a membrane fusion interface is reduced, and no increase in membrane fusion is observed. This reasoning can also be applied to homomeric peptide interactions, which could provide a pathway for dissipation of the lipopeptide away from the fusion interface. CD titration was performed with K 3 GW and the K 3 GW-3O and K 3 GW-3M analogues to test for homodimerization ( Figure S9 and Table  S5 ), but the dimerization constant was found to be comparable for all variants and weak enough that this should not be Bioconjugate Chemistry pubs.acs.org/bc Article considered an important part of the fusion mechanism. This mechanistic understanding derived from the observed differences between the two stapled peptide variants will require further confirmation in different systems and experiments.",

CD and ITC experiments showed that both stapling location and choice of staple affected the properties of the resulting peptides and coiled-coil complexes, with the largest increase in structure, binding, and stability observed for peptides stapled close to the C-terminus with ortho-xylene. Binding strength is increased via a preorganization mechanism, which consists of a large reduction of the unfavored entropic binding component, combined with a negative change in binding enthalpy. ortho-and meta-Xylene cross-linkers resulted in similar coiled-coil binding strengths, although ortho-xylene reduced the effect of entropy the most. This effect was true for all three stapling sites and is due to the smaller size of the ortho-xylene cross-linker. Although there may be some dependence on amino acid composition, we conclude that ortho-xylene is the best cross-linker to stabilize helical peptides, despite meta-xylene being more widely employed to date. The effect of stapling on peptide-membrane partitioning was determined and showed a 2-fold difference between stapled peptide variants, although no direct correlation to location or staple type could be made. Lipopeptides of K3GW-3M and K3GW-3O were prepared via a novel on-resin stapling method. These peptides were tested in lipid-and content-mixing experiments, and large increases in fusogenicity for the K3GW-3O variant were observed. K 3 GW-3M also showed significantly increased content mixing, but it exhibited a similar amount of lipid mixing to the parent peptide. We theorize that these differences in fusogenicity can be explained via reduced dissociation; increasing coiled-coil interactions without increasing lipid membrane interactions allows accumulation of more coiled-coil pairs at the fusion interface and therefore increases membrane fusion.",
