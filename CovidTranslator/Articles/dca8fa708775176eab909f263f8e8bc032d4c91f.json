The pathogenesis of this kind of diarrhea includes cytokine action, intestinal inflammation, sequestration of red blood cells, apoptosis and increased permeability of endothelial cells in the gut microvasculature, and direct invasion of gut epithelial cells by various infectious agents. Of the travel-associated systemic infections presenting with fever, diarrhea occurs in patients with malaria, dengue fever and SARS. Diarrhea also occurs in patients with community-acquired pneumonia, when it is suggestive of legionellosis. Diarrhea can also occur in patients with systemic bacterial infections. In addition, although diarrhea is rare in patients with early Lyme borreliosis, the incidence is higher in those with other tick-borne infections, such as ehrlichiosis, tickborne relapsing fever and Rocky Mountain spotted fever. Unfortunately, it is often not established whether diarrhea is an initial symptom or develops during the course of the disease. The real incidence of diarrhea in some infectious diseases must also be questioned because it could represent an adverse reaction to antibiotics.",

For example, interferon-gamma (IFN-\u03b3), interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-10 concentrations were elevated in the sera of children with diarrhea caused by rotaviruses. 3 The level of IL-6 was higher in those patients with fever, and increased tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1) levels also correlated with the presence of fever and the number of diarrheal episodes. 3 TNF-\u03b1 is a central mediator of intestinal inflammation and also known to be involved in chloride secretion by intestinal epithelial cells. 4 Polyclonal T-cell activation with an anti-CD3 antibody in mice leads to a release of cytokines such as TNF-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3, IL-2, IL-3, IL-4 and IL-6 into the circulation, which results in a severe but self-limiting syndrome consisting of diarrhea, hypothermia and hypomotility. 5 The expression of the proinflammatory cytokine IL-8 can be stimulated by the flagella proteins of various bacteria, 6 and has been shown to predict the severity of enterocolitis in pediatric oncology patients. 7 IL-8 is strongly chemoattractant for CD8 + intraepithelial lymphocytes and a strong inducer of CD4 + T cells; it probably has a role in the generation of the mucosal immune response to rotavirus infection. 8 The anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 was recently shown to protect IL-10 knockout mice from severe diarrhea and the loss of intestinal villi induced by T-cell activation through administration of anti-CD3 monoclonal antibodies. 9 These cytokines might be of particular interest as an explanation of gastro intestinal symptoms in systemic infections.",

There is a sudden onset of fever, headache, myalgia, and pulmonary symptoms such as cough or shortness of breath and pneumonia occurring on day 5. Diarrhea has been reported in 1-24% of SARS patients at the time of hospital admission, and in 38-74% of cases overall. [35] [36] [37] In one study, diarrhea occurred in 20% of younger SARS patients and in 4% of older SARS patients, though it is unclear why older patients have diarrhea less often. 38 Diarrhea was most common, occurring in 74% of all SARS cases, during an outbreak in Hong Kong, where the transmission was also suspected to be mediated by sewage. 36 At day 14 after hospital admission, the SARS coronavirus was detected in the stool of 97% of patients, 36 supporting the theory of feco-oral transmission. The presence of the SARS corona virus in gastrointestinal epithelial cells can be visualized by electron microscopy; however, there is no evidence of inflammation in the gut mucosa or submucosa and no, or only slight, villous blunting in patients with SARS-associated diarrhea. 35 It is worth noting that the viral load of SARS coronavirus in nasopharyngeal aspirates was significantly higher in patients with diarrhea and in patients who died than in the other SARS patients; nonetheless, diarrhea did not predict death. 37",

The anerobic gut microflora metabolizes high-molecular-weight carbohydrates to absorbable short-chain fatty acids. When the gut microflora is altered by antibiotics, high-molecular-weight carbohydrates accumulate in the colon and cause osmotic diarrhea. Bile acids, which escape absorption in the small bowel, are usually deconjugated and dehydroxy lated by bacteria. When the bacterial flora is disturbed, unmetabolized dihydroxy bile acids, which are potent secretory agents, lead to development of secretory diarrhea in the colon. 49 Disturbances of the gut microflora also promote the overgrowth of distinct pathogenic bacteria. About 16-20% of AAD cases are caused by Clostridium difficile and 2-8% by Clostridium perfringens. 49 Rare cases of diarrhea due to Klebsiella oxytoca (also known as penicillin-associated colitis) and Salmonella spp. have been reported after antibiotic treatment. Candida overgrowth has long been postulated to cause AAD, but recent studies clearly indicate that elevated Candida counts in the stool are a result of antibiotic treatment or diarrhea per se rather than a cause of AAD. 50",
