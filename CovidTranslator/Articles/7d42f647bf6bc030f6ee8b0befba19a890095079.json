Here, we compared the anti-tumor efficacy of an Ad-based melanoma vaccine after intradermal, intravenous, intranasal or intraperitoneal delivery in the B16F10 melanoma model. The intradermal route induced superior systemic anti-melanoma immunity which was MyD88 signaling-dependent. Predominant transduction of non-professional antigen-presenting cells at the dermal vaccination sites and draining lymph nodes, suggested a role for cross-presentation, which was confirmed in vitro. We conclude that the dermis provides an optimal route of entry for Adbased vaccines for high-efficacy systemic anti-tumor immunization and that this immunization likely involves cross-priming events in the draining lymph nodes.",

            "text": "Metastatic melanoma is the most aggressive type of skin cancer for which surgical intervention prior to metastasis remains the only curative therapy option; novel therapeutic strategies are therefore urgently needed1. Identification and molecular characterization of melanoma antigens recognized by the cellular components of the adaptive immune system have paved the way for the development of viral vector based genetic immunization strategies2. Adenovirus type 5 (Ad5) vectors are the most commonly used vectors for gene delivery and vaccination,3 since the virus exhibits relatively low cytotoxicity, high cloning and replication capacity, and an ability to infect both dividing and non-dividing cells4. Preclinically evaluated Ad5 based melanoma vaccines include recombinant Ad5 encoding either murine or human tyrosinase-related proteins (TRP) -1 and-25 -7. These tyrosinaserelated proteins are melanosomal enzymes endogenously expressed in both melanocytes and melanoma cells8 , 9. Perricone et al. 10 reported that the administration of adenovirus type 2 vectors encoding murine TRP2 to more than two intradermal sites inhibited subsequent subcutaneous B16F10 tumor growth. In contradiction to this study conducted with Ad2 vectors, vaccination of mice with Ad5 encoding autologous full-length TRP2 did not induce effective TRP2 specific cellular immune responses, nor did it result in the eradication of B16F10 melanoma tumors 7 . However, vaccination of mice via the intraperitoneal (i.p) route with Ad5 encoding xenogenic human TRP2 or the murine immunodominant aa180-188 epitope TRP2 fused to the Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) containing immunogenic foreign helper sequences (Ad5-GFP-TRP2 aa180-188 ), was able to overcome peripheral tolerance and induce effective TRP2 specific CD8 + T cells via a CD4 + T cell dependent mechanism2. The thus induced TRP2 specific immune response completely prevented the outgrowth of lung metastases but not subcutaneous growth of B16 melanoma cells2 , 11 . Whether this was due to a route of immunization-dependent induction of a compartmentalized antigen specific cellular immune response has not yet been further evaluated. The identification of optimal routes of administration of Ad5 based melanoma vaccines to induce systemic immune responses may prove particularly important in order to eradicate metastatic tumors growing in distinct tissues of the body (e.g. skin, lung, brain or visceral tissue). In the present study, we evaluated the effects of administration route on the specific CD8 + T cell priming efficacy of Ad5-GFP-TRP2 and the ability of the primed effector cells to eradicate B16F10 tumors growing in different sites of the body, i.e. subcutaneous (s.c.) vs. lung. The administration routes compared were i.p, intravenous (i.v.), intranasal (i.n.) and intradermal (i.d.) The latter proved most effective, inducing potent systemic TRP2-specific CD8 + T cell immunity and resulting in the complete prevention of B16F10 melanoma outgrowth in the subcutis as well as in the lung.",

            "text": "A critical factor in inducing immune response against self antigens such as TRP2 is efficient delivery of the vaccine to professional antigen presenting cells (APC), i.e. dendritic cells (DC) 8 . Skin contains both epidermal (Langerhans cells, LC) and dermal DC, while skindraining LN contain both resident and skin-derived DC populations. In the classical paradigm, skin DC have been recognized as key APC, capable of priming naive T cell responses12. In contrast, LN resident CD8\u03b1 + DC, rather than skin DC, have been reported to be key APC for priming CD8 + T cell responses against antigens encoded by vaccinia virus, herpes simplex virus (HSV), and influenza A viruses [13] [14] [15] . However, the role of skinderived DC in Ad-induced CD8 + T cell responses has not been reported. This led to us to investigate the possible role of skin DCs in the Ad5-mediated induction of CD8 + T cell responses. In addition, we investigated the involvement of MyD88-dependent signaling events. Ad5-induced innate immune responses are mediated by Toll-like receptors (TLRs)16. The mammalian TLRs are a family of highly conserved, germline-encoded transmembrane receptors that recognize conserved microbial products (Pathogen-Associated Molecular Patterns, PAMPs). Detection of PAMPs by TLRs recruits distinct sets of adapter molecules that in turn activate specific downstream signalling molecules leading to the induction of an immune response and elimination of invading pathogens17 , 18. TLRs can signal through four adaptors identified to date19. Myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88) is a key adaptor for most TLR-dependent inflammatory signaling pathways as well as for IL-1R1, IL-18R1 and IFN\u03b3R1 signaling pathways20. MyD88 interacts with a variety of cellular proteins leading to the activation of NF-\u03baB, JNK, and p38 MAPKinase and the induction of inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and type I interferons20 , 21. A key role for MyD88 in Ad5 induced pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion, activation of DCs and antigen specific adaptive immune responses has previously been reported16 , [22] [23] [24] . Here we present evidence to suggest that Ad5-based i.d. vaccine efficacy is cross-priming and MyD88 dependent, but does not require skin-derived DCs nor DC-based MyD88 signalling.",

The significance of the selected route of vaccine administration in the induction of systemic anti-tumor CTL immunity has been thoroughly investigated using DC based cancer vaccines 32, 35, 36 . Mullins et al., 35 showed that route of administration of a DC based vaccine determined the location of primary T cell activation, distribution of memory T cells and control of localized tumor outgrowth. Recently, the impact of Ad5 vector immunization via different routes on biodistribution of the vector has been studied.31 , 37 , 38 Also, the impact on the induction of antigen specific CTL responses has been studied using Ad5 encoding non-self model antigens, chicken ovalbumin (OVA) and \u03b2-galactosidase. 31, 38 The first study revealed the i.p. route of administration to be most effective in inducing OVA specific CD8 + T cell responses, whereas the s.c. route proved to be most potent in the latter study. However, neither study evaluated the anti-tumor efficacy of the induced immune response. Studies on the biodistribution of Ad5 vectors administered via different routes have revealed that through the i.d. route of administration, transgenes are delivered to the vaccination site and reach the local draining LN; through the i.v. route transgenes reach the liver, spleen, LN and other organs, through the i.p. route the draining LN and spleen and through the i.n. route the lungs, brain and draining LN. 31, 37 These data suggest that the wider distribution achieved through the i.p. and i.v. routes of administration should facilitate a more widespread Ad5induced systemic immune response than permitted by the i.d. route. However, we clearly found the i.d. route of vaccination to induce the most potent systemic anti-tumor CD8 + T cell response when compared with other routes of vaccination. This is probably due to the presence of a vast network of Ad5 susceptible fibroblasts in the murine skin and ready access to high numbers of DC in the skin and its draining LN. Here, we did not compare i.d with the s.c. route of administration, however, we believe that a slight modification of the depth of injection could significantly hamper the efficacy of vaccination due to the absence of DC and accessible lymphatic vessels in s.c. layers and consider it therefore vital that the viruses are delivered i.d. 10, 39 Even though Ad5 vectors have been reported to be very effective for delivering transgenes to mucosal tissues, due to their natural tropism for mucosal epithelia, we failed to detect any TRP2 transgene-specific T cell responses either in peripheral blood or in spleen upon i.n. A5 delivery. 37, 40 Further research is needed to establish whether this is due to differences in tissue homing ability of the specific T cells primed in mucosa-draining LN as previously reported for DC based vaccines. 34, 35 Alternatively, the mucosal surface targeted through i.n. Ad5 delivery, may not be sufficiently conducive to the generation of effective cell-mediated anti-tumor immunity, but rather lead to humoral immunity or, in the absence of proper danger signals, even lead to tolerance induction 41 .",

            "text": "Skin is a sensitive immune organ due to the presence of a dense network of professional APC, i.e. Langerhans Cells (LC) and demal DC, and hence forms an attractive site for vaccination. DC are capable of breaking peripheral tolerance and initiating adaptive immune responses against self antigens. As most tumor antigens are self antigens against which considerable peripheral tolerance is maintained, targeted delivery of tumor antigens to DC has been considered a promising immunotherapeutic approach to overcome peripheral tolerance and to promote anti-tumor immune responses. Although Ad5 vectors are being considered as a tumor vaccine vehicle, they do not efficiently infect DC in vitro. 42 Nevertheless, i.d. Ad5-eGFP-TRP2 vaccination induced potent anti-tumor immune response in mice. We therefore decided to investigate whether the employed Ad5 vector delivered their transgene to DC in the skin vaccination site and its draining LN. Immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that the GFP transgene was not expressed in skin DC. Even though specific characterization of the transgene expressing cells was not undertaken in the present study, we speculate based on previous observations 43 and localization and morphological features that a large portion of the transgene-expressing cells were fibroblasts. These findings indicate that the direct transduction of DC is not required for the injected Ad5 vectors to elicit TRP-2-specific T cell responses but that this was likely achieved by crosspresentation of the Ad5-encoded epitope by DC. This is in line with a previously reported Ad5-induced influenza A nucleoprotein-specific CD8 + T cell response in mice which also depended on cross-priming 44 . Indeed, we found the transgenic TRP2 epitope to be readily cross-presented by DC upon co-incubation with allogeneic (MHC miss-matched) transduced fibroblasts in vitro. Although these findings demonstrate high efficacy of Ad5 vaccines without direct DC infection, this may be strictly inherent to the use of a vector encoding a defined CD8 + T cell epitope fused to foreign (eGFP) CD4 + helper T cell epitopes, rather than a full-length self protein. This could have facilitated the rapid and highly efficient dissemination of the epitope to surrounding bystander cells (including APC) and subsequent high-efficacy cross-presentation. Indeed, i.d. vaccination with an Ad5 vector encoding fulllength TRP2 could not induce protective anti-melanoma immunity (our own findings, data not shown). Thus, for efficacious i.d. vaccination with Ad5 vectors encoding full-length tumor antigens, targeted in vivo delivery of the transgene to DC may be warranted. We are currently investigating this issue further.",

Ad5 injection. Even though skin DC subset-specific involvement in antigenspecific CD8 + T cell priming was not evaluated in the present study (i.e. LC vs dermal DC subsets), based on the reports that both LC and dermal DC take longer than 12h to reach draining LN, 46 we can conclude that most likely DC in skin-draining LN and not skinderived DC are dominantly involved in (cross)-presentation of Ad5 vector delivered TRP-2 antigen to na\u00efve CD8 + T cells in skin draining LN and the subsequent induction of protective anti-tumor immunity. CD8\u03b1 + DC would be the most obvious candidate subset in this regard. [13] [14] [15] Unlike previous reports on abrogation of Herpes simplex virus or plasmid DNA encoding OVA induced T cell response upon scarification of immunization site, 46, 47 excision of Ad5-eGFP-TRP2 immunization site within a few hours post-vaccination i.d., did not completely abrogate the immune response and more importantly, had no effect on protection against subsequent tumor outgrowth. Whether the observed reduction in specific CD8 + T cell responses in the immunization site-excision group was either due to an overall reduction in the antigenic load or due to removal of antigen-exposed skin DC will require further investigation.",

            "text": "The role of TLR signalling in viral vector-induced innate and adaptive immune responses has been studied using MyD88 deficient mice 16, 22, 23, 48, 49 . There are contradictory reports on the ability of MyD88 deficient mice to mount a pro-inflammatory innate immune response to Ad5 infection 22, 48 . Interestingly, no defect in maturation of DC from MyD88 deficient mice upon exposure to Ad5 48 or vaccinia virus 49 has been reported. Indeed, a recent report suggests that Ad5-induced activation of murine DC in vitro may be TLRdependent but MyD88 independent 24 . We found MyD88 to be critical for Ad5-induced protective anti-tumor immunity in vivo. This is in line with previous findings on the role of MyD88 in Ad5-induced CTL reactivity against the carcinoembryonic antigen 23 and vaccinia virus (VACV) induced VACV-specific effector CD8 + T cell response 49 . Our observation of hampered anti-melanoma immunity in vaccinated MyD88 \u2212/\u2212 KO mice appeared not to be due to an impaired antigen (cross-)presenting capacity of DC, as MyD88 deficient DC matured normally (data not shown) and were also able to stimulate and induce production of IFN\u03b3 in TRP2-specific CTL following Ad-GFP-TRP2 infection or co-culture with infected fibroblasts in vitro. Beside DC, other (non-)immune cells have also been found to express and signal through MyD88, e.g. macrophages 50 and CD8 + T cells 51 . Elimination of local macrophages through i.d. injection of liposome-complexed clodronate prior to i.d. vaccination with Ad5 in our hands did not interfere with vaccination efficacy (data not shown), excluding a possible role for macrophages in the observed induction of protective CD8 + T cell-mediated anti-tumor immunity. Recent studies have demonstrated that T cellexpressed MyD88 plays an important intrinsic role in lymphocytic choriomeningitis and vaccinia virus induced specific CD8 + T cell survival and accumulation during clonal expansion [52] [53] [54] . It is tempting to speculate that Ad5-induced transgene specific CD8 + T cells may similarly depend on MyD88 mediated signaling processes for clonal expansion and survival. Alternatively, TLR expressed in assessory cells in vivo such as e.g. fibroblasts, may have led to MyD88-mediated signaling and cytokine release upon Ad5 infection, which in turn may have activated neighbouring DC. Further studies are needed to clarify the precise mechanism underlying the observed dependence on MyD88.",

            "text": "In summary, i.d. vaccination with an Ad5-based tumor vaccine was found to be the optimal delivery route for the induction of a systemic antigen specific T cell response, able to prevent establishment of both s.c. and lung tumors. The administered Ad5 did not directly infect and transduce DC but rather infected fibroblast-like cells. The subsequent induction of protective T cell-mediated anti-tumor immunity most likely depended on cross-presentation of antigen by DC in draining LN and involved signalling through the MyD88 adaptor protein (but not at the DC level). Present findings suggest that the route of administration and also the anatomical location of the tumors should be taken into consideration when Ad5based vaccines are designed and evaluated. The intradermal (i.d.) route of administration of Ad5-GFP-TRP2 aa180-188 induces superior (i.e. strong and long-lasting) TRP2-specific CD8 + T cell reactivity as compared to intravenous (i.v.), intranasal (i.n.) or intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration. a) INF\u03b3 producing CD8 + T cells in both peripheral blood leukocytes (PBL) and splenocytes harvested on day 13 and 27 post-vaccination respectively, were detected by flow cytometric analysis after in vitro stimulation with the TRP-2 aa180-188 peptide. b) TRP2 specific T cell frequencies were also determined using TRP-2 tetramers (Tm) in splenocytes harvested at day 27 post vaccination. Presented data are means \u00b1 SEM (n=3-6). c) Mouse with localized coat depigmentation at the vaccination site as well as at the site of s.c. tumor inoculation. Data were analyzed by ANOVA and the variances were compared with Bonferroni test. Differences between the groups were considered significant when P<0.05. * P<0.05, **<0.01 & ***<0.001. The intradermal (i.d.) route of administration of Ad5-GFP-TRP2 aa180-188 (10\u00d710 6 i.u./mice) protects mice from both subcutaneous (s.c.) growth as well as lung metastasis of B16F10 melanoma cells, in contrast to intravenous (i.v.), intranasal (i.n.) or intraperitoneal (i.p.) routes of vaccination. a) Kinetics of s.c. growth of B16F10 melanoma cells in mice prophylactically vaccinated with control (Ad5-GFP) or Ad5-GFP-TRP2 aa180-188 virus at d -14 and boosted at d -7 via i.d., i.v., i.n., and i.p. routes. Each plotted line represents tumor growth kinetics in an individual mouse (n=6). *Indicated is the number of tumor bearing mice/total number of mice. b) Number of macroscopically visible metastases on the surface of the lungs of mice vaccinated with Ad5-GFP or Ad5-GFP-TRP2 aa180-188 . Each plotted value represents an individual mouse (n=5). c) INF\u03b3 producing CD8 + T cells in peripheral blood leukocytes harvested on day 14 and 29 post-vaccination from the animals tested for the outgrowth of lung metastases, were detected by flow cytometric analysis after in vitro stimulation with the TRP-2 aa180-188 peptide. Data were analyzed by ANOVA and the variances were compared with Bonferroni test. Differences between the groups were considered significant when P<0.05. ***P<0.001. Intradermal administration (i.d.) of Ad5-GFP predominantly leads to transduction of nondendritic cells (DC) and skin DC are dispensable for the induction of an effective anti-tumor response by Ad5-GFP-TRP2. a) Mice were injected with either PBS or Ad5-GFP (1\u00d710 8 i.u/ mice) via i.d. administration in the flank skin. The skin from the site of injection of PBS or Ad5-GFP and respective injection site draining lymph node LN (axillary) were harvested and analyzed by immunofluorescent staining. Virus transduced cells were detected by transgene GFP (green) expression and dendritic cells in the skin were detected using anti-IA/ IE antibody (red) and the LN DCs with anti-CD11c antibody (red). Cell nuclei were detected using DAPI (blue) (magnification 400\u00d7). Data shown are representative of three independent experiments with each experimental group consisting of two to three mice. b) Mice were i.d. vaccinated with Ad5-GFP-TRP2 (1\u00d710 7 i.u/mice) on the flank skin and the vaccination site was surgically excised after 4h. Rates of IFN\u03b3 producing CD8 + T cells in peripheral blood leukocytes (7 d post vaccination) and splenocytes (18 d post vaccination) were determined by flow cytometric analysis after in vitro restimulation with the TRP2 aa180-188 peptide. Means \u00b1 SEM are plotted (n=6). Data were analyzed by ANOVA and the variances were compared with Bonferroni test. Differences between the groups were considered significant when P<0.05. *P<0.05. c) Kinetics of s.c. growth of B16F10 melanoma cells in mice prophylactically vaccinated via i.d. route with control (Ad5-GFP) or Ad5-GFP-TRP2 aa180-188 and similarly vaccinated mice in which the vaccination site was surgically excised after 4h. Each plotted line represents tumor growth kinetics in an individual mouse (n=6). *Indicated is the number of tumor bearing mice/total number of mice. TRP2 specific CD8 + T cell responses induced by intradermal administration of Ad5-GFP-TRP2 aa180-188 depend on the MyD88 adapter protein but not at the dendritic cell (DC) level. a) IFN\u03b3-producing CD8 + T cell rates were determined in peripheral blood leukocytes (PBL) and splenocytes harvested from both C57Bl/6 wild type (WT) and MyD88 \u2212/\u2212 KO mice on day 13 and 27 post-vaccination, respectively. IFN\u03b3-producing CD8 + T cells were determined by flow cytometric analysis after in vitro restimulation with the TRP2 aa180-188 peptide. Means and SEM were plotted (n=5). Data were analyzed by ANOVA and the variances were compared with Bonferroni test.
