Calves were also fed milk replacer with (n = 38) or without (n = 40) animal plasma (20% of crude protein) to 29 d of age to determine effect of plasma protein on IgG status, health, and growth. Calves were fed maternal colostrum or colostrum replacement at 1.5 and 13.5 h of age and provided a total of 250 or 249 and 180 or 186 g of IgG for Holsteins and Jerseys fed maternal colostrum or colostrum replacement, respectively. Milk replacer (12.5% DM) was fed at 31% of metabolic birth weight (2 feedings/d). Plasma was sampled at 0 h, 24 h, and weekly to determine IgG by turbidimetric immunoassay. At blood collection, calves were weighed and measured to determine growth. Health scores, fecal scores, and grain intake were measured daily. Plasma IgG at 24 h did not differ between calves fed maternal colostrum (13.78 \u00b1 0.39 g/ L) and colostrum replacement (13.96 \u00b1 0.38 g/L). Average daily gain, withers height, hip height, body length, heart girth, health, and incidence of diarrhea were not different between treatment groups. Calves fed maternal colostrum used feed more efficiently than calves fed colostrum replacement. Plasma IgG and performance were not affected by the addition of animal plasma to milk replacer. The colostrum replacement used in this study provided adequate IgG for newborn calves. Animal plasma was an acceptable source of protein but did not enhance growth or immunity under the conditions of this study.

Inadequate absorption of colostral immunoglobulins, or failure of passive transfer (FPT), is common and increases morbidity and mortality risk (NAHMS, 1993) . Many diseases, including Johne's, can be passed to calves via maternal colostrum (MC), and producers are advised to discard or pasteurize MC from infected cows (Stabel, 2001) . This practice can reduce the supply of available MC and may force producers to use colostrum containing less IgG.",

Supplements made from dried colostrum (Zaremba et al., 1993) or dried whey (Garry et al., 1996; Mee et al., 1996) did not improve absorption of IgG over MC. Supplements based on purified blood proteins have improved IgG absorption in some reports (Todd et al., 1993; Arthington et al., 2000b) , but not in other reports (Arthington et al., 2000a; Quigley et al., 2000a) . Supplementation does not eliminate MC as a disease transmission vehicle; however, replacement of MC may be able to prevent disease. Quigley et al. (1998b Quigley et al. ( , 2002 reported colostrum replacer (CR) products provided adequate IgG to calves. Any CR must contain sufficient absorbable IgG to effectively mimic colostrum in establishing passive immunity. Although immunoglobulins contained in CR may not provide protection to farm-specific pathogens, CR have potential advantages in consistent composition and quality. An effective CR would provide a viable alternative for producers facing limited or contaminated colostrum supplies.",

            "text": "Concentrations of IgG declined in a quadratic manner from d 1 to 29. IgG concentrations in calves fed CR were higher than in MC-fed calves on d 8 and 15 ( Figure  1 ). Differences in IgG concentrations between calves fed plasma in CMR and calves fed control CMR were not detected. To estimate clearance rate, change in IgG from day \u00d7 to day y was divided by IgG on d x (e.g., [(d 1 \u2212 d 8)/d 1] \u00d7 100). Apparent clearance rates were calculated for each 7-d period (Figure 2 ). Calves fed MC had an apparent clearance rate of 3.5% per day in wk 1, which agrees well with estimates determined by clearance of 125 I-labeled IgG 1 (Besser et al., 1988) . Rate of clearance in wk 2 (1.98%) was also similar to calculations of Besser et al. (1988) . Based on these estimates, calves either cleared less IgG or produced more IgG as age increased. Since endogenous IgG production can begin at 3 d (Devery et al., 1979) , it is likely that endogenous production increased with age, resulting in an apparent decrease in clearance rate in wk 3 and a gain in IgG over wk 4. These estimates are probably appropriate for calves fed MC, but may not apply to calves fed CR. Ratio of IgG 1 to IgG 2 in serum is approximately 1:1 (Mayer et al., 2002) , but in colostrum it is skewed toward IgG 1 at 95:5 (Butler, 1983) . In calves fed serum-derived CR, half of the passively acquired IgG was likely IgG 2 , and clearance of IgG acquired from CR may follow a different pattern. Calves fed CR appeared to clear IgG less rapidly. This may be explained by Mayer et al. (2002) , who found that the Fc receptor in the neonate is specific for IgG 1 and is responsible for resecretion of circulating IgG back into the lumen of the intestine. It would follow that if there were more IgG 1 in the blood of calves receiving MC it would be cleared from the blood more rapidly, resulting in lower IgG levels in the calf with increasing age. Alternatively, increased endogenous IgG production may have occurred. Previous work has shown that hypogammaglobulinemic calves begin synthesizing IgG earlier than calves with adequate IgG (Logan et al., 1974) .",

Colostrum was not analyzed for protein, but contains about 15% protein (Foley and Otterby, 1978) as compared with the CR used in this study, which contained about 10% protein.

Apparent clearance rate of passively acquired IgG was faster in calves fed MC than in calves fed CR. Calves fed MC had greater feed efficiency than calves fed CR. No other differences in growth or health perfor- mance were attributable to source of IgG in the first 24 h. However, while CR may provide adequate amounts of IgG, the viability and specificity of antibodies, as well as the ratio of IgG 1 to IgG 2 , are potential concerns for the efficacy of these products. If IgG molecules are not viable and specific for pathogens in the local environment, then amount provided is irrelevant. Effects of intense processing required to isolate and concentrate IgG from animal proteins on activity of IgG also need to be determined. Furthermore, the ratio of IgG 1 to IgG 2 in colostrum is likely skewed in favor of IgG 1 for a physiological reason. The impact of changing this ratio needs to be evaluated more closely. If calves receiving CR are stimulated to produce IgG 1 , then the product could be very valuable in providing enough initial IgG 1 to effectively protect the calf until endogenous production begins. At the same time, IgG 2 would be present Figure 3 . Feed efficiency (kg BW gain/kg DMI) by week in calves fed maternal colostrum at birth and milk replacer without animal plasma for 1 mo (CN), maternal colostrum at birth and milk replacer with animal plasma for 1 mo (CPL), colostrum replacement at birth and milk replacer without animal plasma for 1 mo (RN), or colostrum replacement at birth and milk replacer with animal plasma for 1 mo (RPL). Calves fed colostrum were more efficient than calves fed replacement from d 0 to 8. in excess of normal concentrations and may offer additional benefits. On the other hand, increased concentrations of IgG 2 may inhibit IgG 1 production and lead to reduced immunity as IgG is cleared from the blood. However, since no differences were observed in morbidity or mortality in this trial, it may be assumed that CR offered equivalent protection as MC under the conditions of this study.",
