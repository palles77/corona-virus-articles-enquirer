Although all four of these viruses prefer to replicate in a cell in the stationary phase of growth, FIPV is able to replicate in an actively growing cell. Each virus causes a cytopathic effect in monolayer cell cultures under agar or media 18 to 72 h postinfection. Primary isolation of each virus from field specimens is difficult, although most can usually be isolated after 1 to 3 blind passages in the cell culture.",

At the present time the group consists of 14 recognized viruses and 4 or more unclassified isolates. The viruses and their abbreviations are listed in Table 1 . These viruses comprise four distinct antigenic groups plus a miscellaneous group (35) . Generally these viruses infect epithelial cells of the respiratory tract [human coronavirus (HCV), infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), rat coronavirus (RCV), porcine respiratory coronavirus (PCV)] and epithelial cells of the gastrointestinal tract [bovine coronavirus (BCV), canine eoronavirus (CCV), transmissible gastroenteritis virus {TGEV), turkey coronavirus (TCV), feline enteric coronavirus (FECV), human enteric coronavirus (HECV)]. In addition, feline infectious peritonitis virus tFIPV), mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), rabbit coronavirus (RbCV), and hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (HEV) exhibit other tissue tropisms and alternate pathogenic mechanisms (40) . The feline, murine, and avian coronaviruses will usually cause a mild or inapparent infection in adults, hut usually a severe diarrheal disease and often death in neonatal animals (40) . Basic studies on these viruses have been limited because of their fastidious growth in cell culture (14) . Most coronaviruses will grow only in cells derived from the natural host animal or in cells from a closely related species (33, 35) . Growth of HCV, HECV, and RbCV in cell culture is difficult, whereas (Fig. 1 c, d) . After CPE is observed, freeze each flask at --75 \u00b0 C. When grown under these conditions, TGEV will have a plaque titer of approximately 7 X 107 pfu/ml 18 to 20 h after inoculation, and HEV will have a plaque titer of approximately 3 X 107 pfu/ml 24 to 48 h after inoculation.",

The methods presented in this report are easy to reproduce and could be adapted by laboratories worldwide for in vitro growth of FIPV, CCV, HEV, and TGEV.

The use of monospecific fluorescent antibodies is recommended to follow in vitro growth of the virus and to confirm virus identity. Several techniques have been used to enhance or improve the chances of isolating these viruses. Some of these techniques include addition of pancreatin 10.5%}, trypsin (10 pg/ml}, or DEAE-dextran to cell culture media at the time of initial inoculation, maintaining a slightly acidic pH in the culture media, the use of primary cell cultures instead of secondary cultures, and incorporation of high titer hyperimmune antisera in the culture media to suppress the growth of contaminating viruses.",

After incubation, resuspend the detached cells from one 75-cm 2 flask in 100 ml of E M E M culture medium and distribute to five new 75cm 2 flasks t20 ml/flask). This gives a seeding ratio of 1:5 tapprox. 6 to 8 million cells/flaskl. After seeding, incubate the flasks at 37 \u00b0 C in a humidified incubator with 97% air:3% COs. Confluent monolayers of ST or SPTh cells are obtained within 5 d ~Fig. 1 a, b}. b. Aspirate the medium in one flask of 3-to 5-d-old confluent CRFK cells and replace with 3 ml of TV solution.

After incubation, resuspend the detached cells in 100 ml of EMEM-L15 culture medium and distribute to five new 75-cm 2 flasks (20 ml/flask). This gives a seeding ratio of 1:5 (approx. 4 to 5 million cells/flask). Confluent CRFK monolayers are obtained within 3 d (Fig. 2 a). D. Virus growth 1. Virus Original stock viruses are maintained in glass, sealed ampules in liquid nitrogen. Stock working virus is within 10 passes of original source. Journal of Tissue Culture Methods Vol. 11, No. 2, 1988 Working virus is frozen in E M E M with 20% FBS and maintained at --75% C. 2. Virus growth a. Remove one tube of FIPV and one tube of CCV from the --75 \u00b0 C freezer and thaw at 37 \u00b0 C. Remove two 75-cm 2 flasks of confluent t5-d-oldl C R F K cells from the incubator and aspirate the spent medium. Rinse the cells twice with ENIEM-L15 virus growth medium. Inoculate one flask with FIPV at a multiplicity of infection IMOI) of 0.05 to 0.5 plaque forming units (pfu)/cell tl to 5 ml of virus fluids) and inoculate the other flask with CCV at an MOI of 0.1 to 1.0 pfu/cell (1 to 5 ml of virus fluidsL Return the flasks to the 37 \u00b0 C incubator for 1 h. After incubation, remove the viral fluids from each flask and replace with 10 ml of EMEM-L15 virus growth medium. Incubate the flask at 37\u00b0C until a viral-induced cytopathic effect tCPE) is observed. After CPE appears on approximately 25% of the cell sheet tFig. 2 b, cl, freeze the flask at --75 \u00b0 C. Under the conditions described above, FIPV wilt have a titer of approximately 1 to 2 X l0 s pfu/ml whereas CCV will have a titer of approximately 5 X 106 pfu/ml. To obtain 5-to 10-fold higher titers of FIPV, the virus can be grown in CRFK cells while they are forming a monolayer. To do this, add 1 to 3 ml of FIPV fluid (MOI of 0.05 to 0.5 pfu/cell) FIG. 2 a, Uninfected 3-d-old CRFK cells, b.

The C R F K cells will establish a confluent monolayer within 3 d, and a viral-induced CPE will be observed 24 h later. B. Remove one tube of TGEV and one tube of HEV from the --75 \u00b0 C freezer and thaw at 37 \u00b0 C. Remove one flask of 5-d-old ST cells and one flask of 5-d-old SPTh cells from the incubator. Aspirate the spent medium and rinse the cell sheets twice with serum-free E M E M . Inoculate ST flask with TGEV at an MOI of 0.1 to 2.0 pfu/cell {0.1 to 1.0 ml of viral fluids), and inoculate the SPTh flask with HEV at an MOI of 0.1 to 2.0 pfu/cell {0.1 to 1.0 ml of viral fluid}. Incubate the flasks at 37 \u00b0 C for 1 h. After incubation, aspirate the inoculum and replace with 10 ml of serum-free E M E M .
