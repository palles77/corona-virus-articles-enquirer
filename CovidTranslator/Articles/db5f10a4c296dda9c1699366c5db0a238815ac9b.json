We build on the concept of the 'field' formed around internet control in authoritarian regimes. Viewing cyber-control as an 'institutional field' allows us to examine the evolution of regulative, normative and cognitive institutions. We have advanced a model that explains how an institutional field evolves. The findings are broadly consistent with existing theories on field formation. Nonetheless, this chapter has revealed unique processes and mechanisms associated with cyber-control-led field construction and reconstruction in authoritarian regimes.",

            "text": "Although more than three dozen governments in the world control their online environment (Mackinnon and Palfrey, 2006) , few have done so more skilfully than China. China's state strategies toward information and communications technology (ICT) have been to balance economic modernisation and political control (Kalathil, 2003) . According to Reporters Without Borders, 'China was one of the first countries to realize it couldn't do without the internet and so it had to be brought under control' (McLaughlin, 2005) . Arguably, Beijing thus focused its attention on the internet before other developing countries because it spotted a need to maintain control (Yang, 2001; Zhang, 2001) . Estimates suggest that tens of thousands of government agents are engaged in various cyber-control activities (Stevenson-Yang, 2006) . In 2007, the Chinese government forced the closure of 44,000 websites; some 868 people were arrested on internet pornography charges and 37 about 2,000 people engaged in activities relating to internet pornography were penalised (e-commercetimes, 2008) . According to Reporters Without Borders, 50 Chinese 'cyberdissidents' were in prison in January 2008 (Jesdanun, 2008) . New regulations, effective from 31 January 2008, require China's online video providers to censor all video clips with 'anti-Beijing content' (Einhorn, 2008) . These are labelled by Reporters Without Borders as 'unprecedented censorship measures'.",

Perhaps more important is that among these players, who tend to have competing interests and disparate purposes (Brint and Karabel, 1991; Greenwood and Hinings, 1996; Hoffman, 1999) , the balance of power and the patterns of interaction are rapidly altering over time. New organisations or populations are entering in the dialogues related to cyber-control and some of the existing organisations are exiting (Brint and Karabel, 1991; Hoffman, 1999: 355) .

            "text": "A clearer understanding of internet control measures in authoritarian regimes is important from theoretical, managerial and policy standpoints. First, the relation between internet diffusion and the growth of democracy is unclear (Wilson and Segal, 2005) . In the USA, for instance, critics are concerned about the internet-led polarisation of the country and argue that the internet's effect on democracy is unclear (Benkler, 2006) . The internet diffusion-democracy nexus, especially in authoritarian regimes, seems to be less clear than it might at first appear. One upshot of such a tendency is that there are some well-founded rationales for and against Western companies' involvement in internetrelated activities in authoritarian regimes, as well as a number of misinformed and ill-guided viewpoints. To take one example, when the French telecom company, Alcatel, began merger talks with Lucent in 2006, some US lawmakers criticised Alcatel's ties with Iran. Alcatel had upgraded Iran's telecom network and provided the country with its first high-speed DSL internet connections (Bremmer, 2006) . One view thus held that Alcatel had helped the Iranian regime. Nonetheless, one might argue the contrary, insomuch as wiring the country has allowed Iranians to communicate with one another and the outside world more easily, thus helping to promote democracy in the country (Bremmer, 2006) . Why is the relationship between internet diffusion and democracy in authoritarian regimes so unclear? Much depends on the precise circumstances. In particular, whether the internet forces authoritarian regimes to promote democracy or whether it will be controlled like other mass media (Hachigian, 2001; Stevenson-Yang, 2006) has been a pressing theoretical and policy issue that adjoins the larger social and political concerns of democratic society.",

It is important to note that an organisational field is a dynamic system characterised by the entry and exit of organisations or populations and/or interaction patterns among them (Brint and Karabel, 1991; Hoffman, 1999: 355) . Like other 'issue-based' fields, internet control can also be viewed as 'arenas of power relations' (Brint and Karabel, 1991: 355) in which various players and constituencies with competing interests and disparate purposes negotiate over issue interpretation and engage in institutional war (White, 1992; Hoffman, 1999: 351-2) .

            "text": "As observed above, internet control in authoritarian regimes is not yet fully institutionalised as it is not 'uncritically accepted' and is not considered to be a 'natural and appropriate arrangement' (Tolbert and Zucker, 1996; Greenwood, Suddaby and Hinings, 2002) . Tolbert and Zucker (1996) refer to this as semi-institutionalisation. An important question then is how an idea (e.g. cyber-control) moves from preinstitutionalisation towards full institutionalisation. A valuable lead into this question is provided by Oliver (1991: 151) , who suggests that organisational actors' strategic responses to institutional processes vary from 'passivity to increasing active resistance: acquiescence, compromise, avoidance, defiance and manipulation'. To put things in context, in China, internet companies' responses to the government's pressure to create a controlled cyber environment vary widely. Moreover, some organisations have changed their strategies to deal with government pressures. Among foreign affiliates, Yahoo followed the strategy of 'acquiescence' from the beginning, obeying rules and norms, and cooperating with the government. Some portals and search engines such as Google and Altavista, on the other hand, 'defied' or actively resisted the institutional processes and were blocked in the country in 2002 (Singer, 2002) . Put differently, they exited the Chinese cybercontrol field in 2002. Subsequently, however, Chinese authorities have won agreements from Google for filtering and screening out sensitive words (French, 2006) . For instance, Google in China shuts down when a user looks for sensitive words (McLaughlin, 2005) . Google has thus reentered the Chinese cyber-control field.",

China is thus mediating ownership to capitalise on the internet's economic benefits and at the same time combat its risks (Hachigian, 2001) . A group at the Ministry of Information Industry (MII) coordinates relevant ministries' efforts in detecting objectionable content and then implements a block. To do this, the group passes the information to the nine state-owned internet access providers that control China's internet traffic (Stevenson-Yang, 2005) .",

It is important to note that organisations' responses to institutional pressures are not always legitimate. The study by Elsbach and Sutton (1992: 716) , for instance, indicated that activist organisations 'decoupled illegitimate actions from formal organizational structures by performing these actions as anonymous individuals' or as part of a temporary group operating under different names. As authoritarian regimes tend to have fewer checks and balances to prevent misuse of power (Popov, 2006; Stoner-Weiss, 2006) , such regimes are likely to be involved in illegitimate internet control measures. Moreover, because of the anonymity inherent in the internet it is easy to decouple illegitimate internet control measures from formal structures. There are even reports that Chinese authorities send viruses to attack banned sites (Guill\u00e9n and Su\u00e1rez, 2005) .",

These codes require members to maintain higher standards of conduct than required by law (Backoff and Martin 1991), to help make professional norms visible (Frankel, 1989) and to act as a vehicle to assure the public and clients that members are competent, have integrity, and maintain and enforce high standards (Ward et al., 1993) .

ISC is sponsored by network access carriers, ISPs, facility manufacturers and research institutes. 1 The formation of the ISC can be considered as a part of Beijing's manipulation strategy, that is, a 'purposeful and opportunistic attempt to co-opt, influence, or control institutional pressures and evaluations' (Oliver, 1991: 157) . To increase their influence, organisations such as the ISC may 'attempt to persuade organizational constituents to join the organization or its board of directors (Oliver, 1991: 157) . The ISC, for instance, asked internet companies to sign a voluntary pledge on 'Self-discipline for China's Internet Industry' that commits them to investigate and block websites with politically and culturally-sensitive content. By March 2002, the pledge had been signed by over 120 internet portals (Stout, 2002) . The pledge commits signatories not to disseminate information 'that might threaten state security or social stability' (Economist, 2002a) .",

Chinese nationalism is viewed as state-sponsored and an attempt to fill an 'ideological vacuum' left by weakening socialism (Christensen, 1996; Oksenberg, 1997; Sautman, 2001) .

Second, to succeed in China, e-business organisations need to make room for civil servants and high-ranking government officials (Sikorski and Menkhoff, 1999; Einhorn, Webb and Engardio, 2000) . It is important to note that most internet regulations are guidelines only and do not represent formal laws (Shie, 2004) .

For instance, Human Rights in China, a New York-based nonprofit group, has provided financial support to anticensorship companies such as Freegate (Fowler, 2006) . Similarly, Amnesty International has accused US-based internet companies such as Google, Microsoft and Yahoo of violating the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in their agreement with the Chinese government to censor internet use in China (US Fed News Service, 2006b) . In the USA, the enactment of the Global Online Freedom Act 2006 can be considered as a part of Washington's 'controlling tactics' to 'establish power and dominance over the external constituents' (Oliver, 1991: 157) . The act has increased the US government's power over American technology companies.

More to the point, the CCP is counting on the information economy to enhance its image. The CCP expects that a richer and more technology-oriented economy might help increase respect for it (Kshetri and Cheung, 2002) . In short, China is interested in fostering a network economy to capitalise on the internet's economic benefits.

They typically exploit 'technological loopholes to circumvent government filters and charge fees for access ' (Palmer, 2005) . To take another example, in Vietnam, 2 activists make extensive use of voice-over internet protocol (VoIP) to contact each other, take part in conference calls and live debates, and post recorded voice messages via online forums available on the websites of VoIP providers such as PalTalk, Yahoo!

Accordingly, their responses to institutional pressures vary. Among foreign technology companies, Yahoo's strategy can be described as compliance -'conscious obedience to or incorporation of values, norms, or institutional requirements' (Oliver, 1991: 152) . Yahoo chief, Jerry Yang, said that he had to make the decision to help Chinese authorities arrest a journalist in order to do business in China (McLaughlin, 2005) . It can, however, be argued that unlike many Chinese technology companies, which may have unconsciously adhered to local rules (Oliver, 1991: 152) , the strategy of compliance of foreign technology companies such as Yahoo is consciously and strategically chosen to comply with institutional pressure in anticipation of self-serving benefits or access to resources (Pfeffer and Salancik, 1978; Meyer and Rowan, 1983; DiMaggio, 1988; Oliver, 1991: 153) .",

The findings are broadly consistent with existing theories on field formation. Nonetheless, this chapter has revealed unique processes and mechanisms associated with internet control measures in China. The theory presented here has thus filled in some of the gaps in macromarketing literature and other related areas of scholarship.At this point, we should emphasise that there are some problems associated with the reliance on cognitive and normative institutions. Some institutionalists argue that the distinction between normative and cognitive institutions tends to be 'blurred' (Campbell, 2004) and it is unclear when taken-for-grantedness of social norms becomes high enough to become part of cognitive institutions (Clemens and Cook, 1999) . Other have pointed out that there is a poor specification of mechanisms by which normative and cognitive structures affect behaviours of various actors (Hirsch, 1997) .The image that a company presents to external parties is a function of the power those parties have over the organisation (Basu, Dirsmith and Gupta, 1999) . With new regulative institutions such as the Global Online Freedom Act 2006, the power that the US government has over US-based technology companies has strengthened. This means that these companies have to work to change their images. Notes 1. At present, there are more than 150 members, most of which are organisations (see http://www.isc.org.cn/English/). 2.
