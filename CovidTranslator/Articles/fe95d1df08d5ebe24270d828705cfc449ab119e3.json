            "text": "Several protein-protein interactions within the SARS-CoV proteome have been identified, one of them being between nonstructural proteins nsp10 and nsp16. In this work, we have mapped key residues on the nsp10 surface involved in this interaction. Alanine-scanning mutagenesis, bioinformatics, and molecular modeling were used to identify several \"hot spots,\" such as Val 42 , Met 44 , Ala 71 , Lys 93 , Gly 94 , and Tyr 96 , forming a continuous protein-protein surface of about 830 \u00c5 2 , bearing very conserved amino acids among coronaviruses. Because nsp16 carries RNA cap 2-O-methyltransferase (2O-MTase) activity only in the presence of its interacting partner nsp10 (Bouvet, M., Debarnot, C., Imbert, I., Selisko, B., Snijder, E. J., Canard, B., and Decroly, E. (2010) PLoS Pathog. 6, e1000863) , functional consequences of mutations on this surface were evaluated biochemically. Most changes that disrupted the nsp10-nsp16 interaction without structural perturbations were shown to abrogate stimulation of nsp16 RNA cap 2O-MTase activity. More strikingly, the Y96A mutation abrogates stimulation of nsp16 2O-MTase activity, whereas Y96F overstimulates it. Thus, the nsp10-nsp16 interface may represent an attractive target for antivirals against human and animal pathogenic coronaviruses.",

Although no CoV guanylyltransferase (16 -23) activity has been identified, CoVs are likely to follow the canonical capping pathway involving (i) an RNA triphosphatase that removes the 5\u0408 \u2425-phosphate group of the mRNA; (ii) a guanylyltransferase that catalyzes the transfer of GMP to the remaining 5\u0408-diphosphate terminus; and (iii) an N7-MTase that methylates the cap guanine at the N7-position, producing the 7Me GpppN \"cap 0 structure.\" Cap 1 structure formation requires an additional 2\u0408O-MTase, that methylates the ribose 2\u0408O-position of the first nucleotide of the mRNA. The involvement of nsp14 N7-MTase and of nsp16 2\u0408O-MTase in the capping pathway was recently demonstrated biochemically (1, 18, 20) . Moreover, both nsp14 and -16 play crucial roles for efficient RNA synthesis within the SARS-CoV replicon and for transcription/replication of MHV-CoV (13, 24) .",

The crystal structure of nsp10 shows that it belongs to the zinc finger protein family (22, 28, 29) . nsp10 has no known enzymatic activity but may have a role in the regulation of enzymatic activities at different steps of the viral transcription/replication or by playing an architectural role. This hypothesis is supported by the micromolar affinity binding of both MHV and SARS-CoV nsp10 to single-stranded RNA (28, 30) . In MHV, nsp10 plays a critical role in RNA synthesis, and a temperature-sensitive nsp10 Q65E mutation causes a defect in minus-strand RNA synthesis, whereas plusstrand synthesis is unaffected (31) . Furthermore, the role of nsp10 in MHV replication was confirmed by alanine-scanning mutagenesis of residues conserved among CoVs (22) . Viable mutants synthesized lower amounts of viral RNA, and lethal mutants delineated a core structure of nsp10 surrounding the zinc fingers (22) . Also nsp10 acts as an essential co-factor triggering nsp16 2\u0408O-MTase activity, suggesting its involvement in the regulation of viral RNA capping (1) . Altogether, these studies suggest that the nsp10 and nsp16 protein-protein complex might define a new target for antiviral molecules against pathogenic CoVs, such as the SARS-CoV.",

Protein expression was induced by the addition of isopropyl 1-thio-\u2424-D-galactopyranoside to a final concentration of 500 M (nsp10) or 50 M (nsp16), when the A 600 value of the culture reached 0.5. nsp16 expression was performed during 16 h at 17\u00b0C, whereas nsp10 expression was incubated at 37\u00b0C during 4 h. Bacterial cell pellets were frozen and resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 300 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgSO 4 , 5 mM \u2424-mercaptoethanol (only for nsp10) supplemented with 1 mM PMSF, 20 mM imidazole, 10 g/ml DNase I, and 0.5% Triton X-100.

The protein fractions were concentrated to around 2 mg/ml and stored at \u03ea20\u00b0C in the presence of 50% glycerol. For NMR experiments, 15 N-labeled nsp10 proteins were grown and induced on M9 minimum medium supplemented with 15 NH 4 Cl and further purified as described above. For pull-down assays, SARS-CoV nsp10-nsp16 complex was produced in E. coli in a dual promotor expression plasmid kindly provided by Bruno Coutard (Architecture et Fonction des Macromol\u00e9cules Biologiques, France). In this backbone, SARS CoV nsp10 can be expressed under a tet promoter and encodes a protein in fusion with an N-terminal Strep tag, whereas nsp16 is expressed under a T7 promoter and encodes a protein in fusion with an N-terminal His 6 tag. The single point mutants in the nsp10 gene were generated by PCR using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene), according to the manufacturer's instructions. E. coli C3016 cells (Biolabs) were transformed with the various expression vectors and grown in 2YT medium containing ampicillin and chloramphenicol. Protein expression was induced by adding 50 M isopropyl 1-thio-\u2424-D-galactopyranoside and 200 g/liter anhydrotetracycline; then cells were incubated for 16 h at 24\u00b0C.

IDAs are alleles that contain mutations affecting their ability to interact with their wild type binding partners, leading to the identification of specific amino acid residues involved in the interaction between nsp10 and nsp16 (39) . nsp16 was used as a bait to screen a library of potential nsp10 IDAs generated by PCR-mutagenesis and selected to express full-length proteins (see \"Experimental Procedures\"). From this screen, 133 independent full-length nsp10 IDAs were determined (Fig. 1A ) (see below). As expected, all clones with a mutated allele were resistant to 5FAO and were therefore unable to grow on medium lacking uracil (Fig. 1A) . The 5FOA R phenotypes could be due to loss of nsp10-nsp16 interaction or to reduced expression of nsp10 through instability or misfolding. Thus, we excluded residue changes that were involved in chelating zinc (Cys 74 , Cys 77 , His 83 , and Cys 90 and Cys 117 , Cys 120 , Cys 128 , and Cys 30 in the first and second zinc fingers, respectively; Fig. 1 , B and C) and changes at internal residues (D106G, W123R) (Fig. 1, C and D) .

Therefore, we made use of a BRET assay to detect interaction of nsp10 with nsp16 in their native mammalian intracellular environment. ORFs encoding nsp10 proteins were fused to the C terminus of EYFP or RLuc, and BRET was measured in HEK 293T cells following transfection of the corresponding plasmids. Under these experimental conditions, we were able to detect a BRET signal only when nsp10 was fused to EYFP and nsp16 was fused to RLuc (data not shown). The specificity of this interaction was assessed by BRET donor saturation assays (supplemental Fig. 1) . A specific BRET signal, characterized by a hyperbolic curve, was detected only when nsp16 was fused to RLuc, with a BRET max of 130 milli-arbitrary units (supplemental Fig. 1 ).

Because an alanine residue substitution eliminates the side chain beyond the \u2424-carbon without altering the mainchain conformation or imposing a straining electrostatic or steric effect and because all of these residues are surface residues, the mutated protein structures should not be drastically different from wild type nsp10 (40) (Fig. 3A, right) .

Arg 78 is conserved among all CoV nsp10 proteins. However, Tyr 96 is unique to SARS-CoV, whereas Phe 96 is found in most other CoV sequences.

The Y96A and Y96V mutants were able to interact weakly with nsp16 as judged by BRET values close to 30 and 20%, respectively (Fig. 4A, left) . In contrast, Y96I completely failed to interact with nsp16. Thus, Tyr 96 mutations into non-aromatic hydrophobic residues decreased the interaction. This inhibition seems proportional to the length of the side chain, reflecting a possible steric hindrance (Fig. 4A, left) . These results point out the importance of the aromatic property of the phenyl group of Tyr 96 at the surface of nsp10 for interaction with nsp16, which is confirmed by the conservation of this aromatic residue at position 96 in most coronaviruses. In these experiments, all mutants were expressed at a similar level in HEK 293T cells as detected by Western blot (Fig. 4A, right) . This result also demonstrates that the Y96F mutation does not have a structural impact on the nsp10 conformation because nsp10 Y96F is interacting more tightly with nsp16 than wild type. The integrity of two nsp10 representative mutated proteins, Y96F and Y96A, was indeed confirmed using heteronuclear 1 H-15 N HSQC NMR studies, which ruled out any effect of these mutations on the structure of nsp10 ( Fig. 4B and supplemental Fig. 2) .",

We therefore analyzed the functional consequences of nsp10 mutations on nsp16 2\u0408O-MTase activity. The nsp16 2\u0408O-MTase activity was first determined by incubating 200 nM purified nsp16 with an increasing concentration of wild type nsp10 (1 nM to 3.2 M), in the presence of a short capped RNA substrate ( 7Me GpppAC 4 ; Fig. 5A, square) . Fifty percent of the maximal 2\u0408O-MTase activity was obtained when 200 nM purified nsp16 was incubated with 1200 nM nsp10 (Fig. 5A) . These conditions were chosen to assess the stimulating or inactivating effect of nsp10 mutant proteins on nsp16 2\u0408O-MTase activity. Under these conditions, any slight alteration of nsp10 binding strength to nsp16 should result in a significant increase or decrease of nsp16 2\u0408O-MTase activity (Fig. 5A) . For this purpose, 14 His 6 tag nsp10 mutants were produced in E. coli and purified. The bottom panel of Fig.  5B shows that the mutant proteins migrated in SDS-PAGE at a molecular mass similar to that of wild type nsp10 protein (15 kDa) upon SDS-PAGE with a minor contaminant detected around 50 kDa. Fig. 5B shows that one mutant protein overstimulates nsp16 2\u0408O-MTase activity (Y96F), whereas almost all of the others were not active in potentiating the nsp16 2\u0408O-MTase activity. Overall, there was excellent correlation . The experiments were performed three times, and the effect of each mutation was compared with the interaction of wild type nsp10 (100% interaction). Western blot analysis indicates homogeneous levels of protein expression. Levels of RLuc-nsp16 and EYFP-nsp10 were determined with anti-luciferase and anti-GFP antibodies, respectively (right). B, 1 H-15 N heteronuclear HSQC NMR experiments were carried out on a 600-MHz Bruker spectrometer (with cryoprobe) and compared with the wild type spectrum. Spectra of 15 N-labeled nsp10 wild type protein and main mutants (Y96F and Y96A) are shown in black and red, respectively. Overall spectra are superimposable, demonstrating that the global architecture of the protein is conserved. OCTOBER 22, 2010 \u2022 VOLUME 285 \u2022 NUMBER 43 between the BRET analysis and the ability of nsp10 mutant proteins to stimulate nsp16 enzyme activity; all nsp10 mutant proteins with reduced nsp16 affinity as judged by BRET assay (BRET value ranging from 10 to 50%) also lose their stimulating effect on nsp16 2\u0408O-MTase activity (V42A, M44A, G70A, R78A/G, K93A/E, G94D, and Y96I/ V/A) (Figs. 3A and 4A ). Furthermore, two mutant proteins, G94A and K95A, that bind nsp16 with a slightly reduced affinity in our BRET assay (60 and 80%, respectively) are still able to stimulate nsp16 2\u0408O-MTase activity (compare Figs. 3A and 5B). These data confirm that the binding of nsp10 to nsp16 is absolutely required to stimulate the nsp16-mediated 2\u0408O-MTase.",

To further clarify this, we performed pull-down assays to assess the binding efficiency of each nsp10 mutant expressed in E. coli (Fig. 5C ). In these conditions, no binding of S72A mutant protein to nsp16 was detected, consistent with its absence of nsp16 2\u0408O-MTasestimulating activity (Fig. 5B ).

To further compare wild type nsp10 and the Y96F mutant, we incubated increasing concentrations of nsp10 with nsp16 and measured 2\u0408O-MTase activity. Fig. 5A indicates that wild type and Y96F nsp10 stimulate the nsp16 2\u0408O-MTase activity in a dose-dependent manner. A shift of 50% activity toward a 10-fold lower concentration was observed for the mutant (\u03f3100 nM) relative to wild type protein (\u03f31 M), although both plateau at similar 2\u0408O-MTase activity values. Altogether, these results demonstrate that the stimulation of nsp16 2\u0408O-MTase activity by nsp10 mutant proteins tends to correlate with their affinity as determined by BRET and pull-down assay.

The effect of nsp10 mutant proteins was further analyzed in terms of nsp16 2\u0408O-MTase activation. Interestingly, all nsp10 mutant proteins that fail to activate nsp16-mediated 2\u0408O-MTase activity have a nsp16-binding activity below 50%.

This central core is resistant to mutations because any modification within this region induces a lethal phenotype (22) . It is therefore tempting to hypothesize that the phenotype observed by Donaldson et al. (22) reflects the importance of the nsp10-nsp16 interaction during CoV replication. Moreover, most of the residues involved in the interaction between nsp10 and nsp16 are also involved in its stimulating effect on the nsp16 2\u0408O-MTase activity. This result strongly suggests that a non-transient physical association between nsp10 and nsp16 is essential to express full nsp16 2\u0408O-MTase activity (Figs. 3A, 4B, and 5B) and to regulate an efficient virus replication. This hypothesis is strengthened by the G70A and K93A mutant proteins that retain 50% of binding to nsp16 in pull-down assay but are unable to efficiently stimulate nsp16 2\u0408O-MTase activity. We note a residual 2\u0408O-MTase activity of G70A mutant protein compared with K93A. Because our pull-down assay was performed in the absence of RNA substrate, we wondered if this difference could reflect a potential role of the RNA substrate in Procedures.\" The 2\u0408O-MTase activity obtained in the presence of wild type nsp10 control protein was arbitrarily set to 100%. The bar graph presents the results of three independent experiments. Corresponding purified His 6 -tagged nsp10 mutant proteins analyzed by SDS-PAGE and visualized by Coomassie Blue staining are shown in the bottom of the panel. C, pull-down assay was performed with nsp10 protein co-expressed with nsp16 in E. coli. Following cell lysis, nsp10 was purified with a Strep-Tactin-Sepharose column, and the amount of nsp16 interacting with nsp10 was visualized by Coomassie Blue staining. Intensities of Coomassie-stained bands were quantified using ImageJ (National Institutes of Health) software. The binding activities were then compared with wild type nsp10 interaction with nsp16, which was arbitrarily set to 100%. Error bars, S.D. the interaction. To address this issue, nsp10 and nsp16 were incubated alone or in combination with mGpppRNA. In these experimental conditions, we could not detect any mGpppRNA binding activity when proteins were incubated alone (data not shown). In contrast, when both proteins are present, the complex is able to bind mGpppRNA, and cross-linking experiments identify nsp16 as the unique RNA-binding protein, suggesting that nsp10 binding induces a conformational change in nsp16, resulting in mGpppRNA binding activity (data not shown). These results also indicate that nsp10 does not bind mGpppRNA by itself, alone or in complex.",

To assess at the molecular level the role of the hydroxyl and phenyl groups in the interaction between nsp10 and nsp16, the Tyr 96 was mutated successively into phenylalanine, alanine, valine, and isoleucine (Fig. 4A) . Interestingly, removing the hydroxyl group resulted in an enhanced binding to nsp16 correlated with an increased 2\u0408O-MTase activity (Figs. 4A and 5B). In contrast, the absence of the phenyl group completely abrogates nsp16 enzymatic activity and partially decreases the binding to nsp16 (Figs. 4B and 5B). Heteronuclear 1 H-15 N HSQC NMR studies of different key mutant proteins ruled out any drastic effect of mutations on the tridimensional structure ( Fig. 4B and supplemental Fig. 2) .

Indeed, a phenylalanine induces both a strong increase of MTase activity and tighter association, which could be detrimental for viral replication for unknown reasons.

Indeed, cap methylation genes of many (\u03e9)-RNA viruses, such as alphaviruses and flaviviruses, were shown to play a crucial role for efficient virus replication (20, 24, (42) (43) (44) . In the case of CoVs, a functional and genetic analysis performed on MHV temperature-sensitive mutants mapped to the N7-MTase domain of CoV nsp14 and in the 2\u0408O-MTase nsp16 indicated that both are involved in positive strand RNA synthesis by previously formed replicase-transcriptase complexes (13) . The importance of cap MTase for viral RNA synthesis is also supported by data obtained by mutagenesis of MTase catalytic residues in SARS-CoV RNA replicon systems (20, 24) . Therefore, cap MTases constitute a new attractive antiviral target. Accordingly, the development of small molecules specifically inhibiting proteinprotein interaction and the 2\u0408O-MTase activity of nsp16 could be envisaged. Furthermore, because this surface of interaction is conserved among CoVs, molecules or peptides inhibiting SARS-CoV nsp10-nsp16 interaction might be developed and extended to the inhibition of the nsp10-nsp16 interaction in other viruses when this interface of interaction is conserved (30) .",
