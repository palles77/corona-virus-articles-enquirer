An improved method for quick and accurate detection of E . tarda by loop-mediated isothermal amplifi cation (LAMP) with two additional loop primers was developed by targeting the EsrB gene ( EsrB -LAMP). In this method, the Mg 2+ concentration, reaction temperature, and reaction time were optimized to 8 mmol/L, 61\u00b0C, and 40 min, respectively. The detection limit with the EsrB gene was as low as 10 copies, which is 100 times more sensitive than that of conventional polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The EsrB -LAMP assay was shown more sensitive and rapid than previously reported LAMP assays targeting the hemolysin gene ( hemolysin -LAMP) for detection of E . tarda . The EsrB -LAMP was also highly specifi c to E . tarda and had no cross-reaction with 13 other strains of bacteria. The assay can be carried out in a simple heating device and the EsrB -LAMP products can be visually detected by adding fl uorescent dye to the reaction mixture. Taken together, the improved EsrB -LAMP diagnostic protocol has the potential for detection of E . tarda from indoor and outdoor samples.",

E . tarda can cause serious diseases and even death in many commercially important species of freshwater and marine fi sh, and thus results in large economic losses to aquaculture worldwide (Thune et al., 1993) . Syndromes may include small cutaneous lesions that develop into large necrotic abscesses, ascitic fl uid in the abdominal cavity, swollen anus, enlarged kidney, and abscesses on internal organs (Plumb, 1999) . In addition to infecting fi sh, E . tarda has a wide host range, and causes diseases in a variety of species including humans (Michael and Abbott, 1993) , reptiles, birds (White et al., 1973) , and amphibians (Sharma et al., 1974) .

Specifi cally, the developed loop F primer (LF) and loop B primer (LB) provide an increased number of starting points for DNA synthesis.

However, due to the different characteristics of sequence fragments, it is not always possible to design additional loop primers for the LAMP primer set. To date, no studies of the application of loop primers to LAMP detection of E . tarda have been conducted. In this study, we successfully designed a LAMP primer set as well as a pair of loop primers for the EsrB gene, which plays an important role in the pathogenicity of E . tarda . In addition, we developed an accelerated EsrB -LAMP assay for identifi cation of E . tarda . The results of this study demonstrate that the EsrB -LAMP assay can effectively shorten detection times. Specifi cally, the amplifi cation product of the E . tarda DNA template could be detected after 15 min using 2.5 ng template",

However, the precipitate might not be clearly visible, which may result in confusion about whether the target DNA was amplifi ed. To address this issue, visual inspection of LAMP amplifi cation products obtained using DNA extracted from the tissue samples of S . maximus and P . olivaceus as templates was carried out by adding fl uorescent dye to the reaction mixture. The positive and negative reactions could be clearly determined with the naked eye based on the color of the reaction mixture. Furthermore, by sealing a drop of fl uorescent dye under the lid in advance, we successfully established a patented method (patent number: ZL 2010 1 0147946.2) for staining without opening the tube lid. This method is a good approach to avoid contamination of LAMP products and prevent false positive results, which are a common problem during LAMP tests (Aryan et al., 2010) . Thus, the EsrB -LAMP assay could also be developed into a closed reaction system for diagnosis, which would be practical for use in the fi eld.",

This EsrB -LAMP assay is the fi rst LAMP protocol to use additional loop primers for the detection of pathogenic E . tarda . The LAMP reaction can be conducted under isothermal conditions and does not require any sophisticated instrumentation. Thus, the established EsrB -LAMP assays will have a wide range of applications for the detection of E . tarda in laboratories, farms, and marine cultures.",
