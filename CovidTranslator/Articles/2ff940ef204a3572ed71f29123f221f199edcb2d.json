Aim: To describe an hPIV-3 nosocomial outbreak and the results of environmental sampling to elucidate the source of nosocomial transmission and the role of environmental contamination. Methods: During an hPIV-3 outbreak between May and June 2016, environmental surfaces in contact with clustered patients were swabbed and respiratory specimens used from infected patients and epidemiologically unlinked controls. The epidemiologic relatedness of hPIV-3 strains was investigated by sequencing of the haemagglutinineneuraminidase and fusion protein genes. Findings: Of 19 hPIV-3-infected patients, eight were haematopoietic stem cell recipients and one was a healthcare worker. In addition, four had upper and 12 had lower respiratory tract infections. Of the 19 patients, six (32%) were community-onset infections (symptom onset within <7 days of hospitalization) and 13 (68%) were hospital-onset infections (!7 days of hospitalization). Phylogenetic analysis identified two major clusters: five patients, and three patients plus one healthcare worker. Therefore, seven (37%) were classified as nosocomial transmissions. hPIV-3 was detected in 21 (43%) of 49 environmental swabs up to 12 days after negative respiratory polymerase chain reaction conversion.",

In the immunocompetent adult, URIs are mild and self-limiting in nature, and reinfections may occur due to incomplete immunity to hPIV. However, in the immunocompromised host, especially in haematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients and patients with haematologic malignancies, hPIV causes a significant morbidity and mortality with prolonged virus shedding [3e5] . Of the five known human serotypes, human parainfluenza virus type 3 (hPIV-3) is the most frequently identified pathogen [4] . Epidemics of hPIV are seasonal, with the peak of activity usually between May and June each year in South Korea, accounting for about 20e35% of detected respiratory virus agents in the community [6] .",

In these reports, whereas some outbreaks were due to a single strain circulating within the unit, others originated from multiple hPIV-3 strains introduced from the community [7, 11, 12, 14] . Sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of hPIV-3 strains allowed for verification of whether a single strain or multiple strains were responsible for the outbreak. In addition, in some of these reports, infection control, including symptomatic surveillance and isolation, were often ineffective in terminating transmission, suggesting asymptomatic viral shedding among patients, staff, or outside visitors, or environmental contamination as a possible explanation [9] . Although fomites or contaminated surfaces have been considered as possible transmission routes of hPIV-3, in addition to droplets or close personal contact, the role of environmental contamination by hPIV-3 in healthcare settings has not been well defined [15, 16] . The present study describes an hPIV-3 nosocomial outbreak in a haematology ward and the results of environmental sampling to elucidate the source of nosocomial transmission and the role of environmental contamination.",

One ward (A) has 42 beds; 12 of these are for patients undergoing HCT. The other ward (B) has 50 beds, including a mixture of single-, two-, five-, and six-bedded rooms, communal showers, and a visiting room for patients on post-HCT care or cytotoxic chemotherapy.

After thorough review, all laboratory-confirmed hPIV-3 patients and symptomatic healthcare workers in the haematology ward during this period were enrolled in this study. Since the incubation period of hPIV-3 infection in adults has been estimated to be two to six days, an infection was considered to be hospital-onset if the patient had been hospitalized for !7 days before the onset of respiratory symptoms [17e19]. All rooms occupied by the original cluster of diagnosed patients, including the six-bedded room, the adjacent room, and the isolation room were selected for the environmental study.

In addition, 11 hPIV-3 isolates that were obtained from respiratory specimens of epidemiologically unlinked patients on different wards of our institution during the same period were also sequenced as controls. RTePCR was performed on the extracts using primers F (5 0 -ATTACTCGAGGTTGCCAGGA-3 0 ) and R (5 0 -CCGCGACACCCAGTTGTG-3 0 ) covering 450 bp of the HN gene. The OneStep RTePCR Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) was used according to the manufacturer's instructions, with 5 mL of extract being amplified in a final volume of 25 mL, containing 5\u00c2 one-step RTePCT buffer, 0.25 mM deoxynucleotide triphosphate, 25 pmol of each primer, and one unit of one-step RTePCR Enzyme Mix. Thermal cycling conditions were as follows: 30 min at 50 C, followed by 15 min at 95 C and 50 cycles of 30 s at 95 C, 30 s at 50 C, and 30 s at 72 C, and a final elongation step at 72 C for 10 min. Sequences were aligned with MEGA 7.0 software using the Clustal W method. Phylogenetic analysis was carried out using the MEGA 7.0 software maximum likelihood method; the kimura 2-parameter was selected as an evolution model, and the bootstrap value was 1000.

As the vulnerability of our healthcare system e such as patients occupying rooms with many beds, communal showers or a visiting room, and the visitation to hospitalized patients by friends and family members e was revealed in the large outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome in South Korea, we would like to elucidate which transmission route is important in our complex situation during an hPIV-3 outbreak. Previous studies have shown that molecular investigations are useful in discerning routes of transmission in hPIV-3 outbreaks [7e11, 14, 20, 21] . One study demonstrated that both community-acquired and nosocomial transmitted infections occurred during one haematology unit outbreak, whereas others reported that nosocomial infections play a more significant role than multiple importations from the community [7, 8, 14, 21] . This discrepancy among studies arises from the differences in terms of hPIV-3 activity in the community. It has been accepted that the epidemiology of community respiratory viral infections, including hPIV-3, in inpatients often mirrors the epidemiology in the outpatient population [22] . In addition, differences in infection control procedure, the presence of multi-patient rooms, and visits to hospitalized patients by friends and family members might contribute to the conflicting results of previous studies.",

However, nasal secretions can travel a distance greater than 10 feet to contaminate surrounding fomites [23] . An experimental study demonstrated that hPIV can survive in stainless steel for 10 h [16] . Although the transfer of hPIV-3 from finger to finger or from finger to metal disc did not occur, hPIV-3 could be transferred from contaminated disks to clean hands [25] . Therefore, person-toperson spread by direct hand contact appears to be an unlikely mode of transmission, whereas contaminated surfaces may lead to direct self-inoculation. To date, only these pieces of indirect experimental evidence have supported contaminated surfaces as a mode of hPIV-3 transmission. In this context, the extensive environmental contaminations and prolonged environmental presence of hPIV-3 were clearly demonstrated, and these findings may partially explain why hPIV-3 is easily spread in the haematology ward. In addition, this emphasizes the importance of disinfection of environmental surfaces. It is noteworthy that hPIV-3 infection was documented in one minimally symptomatic healthcare worker who obtained this virus from the hPIV-3-infected patients. Although it is not exactly known whether asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic healthcare workers can transmit hPIV-3, asymptomatic hPIV-3 viral shedding in the nasopharynx among immunocompetent hosts and the previous outbreak reports suggest the potential role of asymptomatic healthy carriers in nosocomial transmission [9, 17, 26] . In our data, we could not carry out universal screening for healthcare workers during the outbreak, thus precluding our ability to define the precise role of none-tominimal symptomatic healthcare workers in nosocomial transmission. However, since the same nursing team cared for the index patients and the latterly infected cases of cluster 1, and one of the nursing team members (patient K in cluster 5) had documented hPIV-3 infection, healthcare workers may have a role in nosocomial transmission. Further studies are needed on this issue.",

            "text": "In the immunocompromised host, hPIV is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. We observed a mortality rate of 26% during a single hPIV-3 outbreak episode. In previous reports, the mortality rate of hPIV-3 infection varied, ranging from 3% to 47% according to the type of transplant, conditioning and immunosuppression therapy, and post-transplant complications [4, 8, 10, 11] . However, in the majority of cases, it is difficult to verify the cause of death as hPIV-3 infection, and thus only an association of hPIV-3 infection and death can be documented. Particularly in HSCT recipients, LRTI with hPIV significantly increased the risk of airflow decline (odds ratio: 17.9; 95% confidence interval: 2.0e160), and this complication is associated with increased mortality risk. In our study, one out of five patient deaths had a post-HSCT pulmonary complication and died due to pulmonary function deterioration following hPIV-3 pneumonia [27] . Considering the morbidity and mortality associated with hPIV-3 infection in the immunocompromised hosts and the absence of effective antiviral agents or vaccination, prevention via more thorough infection control is essential. Interestingly, we clearly demonstrated that hPIV-3 reinfection occurred during the hospital stay (patient F, Figure 3 , and Supplementary Figure 1, Appendix A) . There is a need for more careful and comprehensive prevention guidelines to be applied during hPIV-3 outbreak in the haematology unit. This study has some limitations. First, samples positive for viral RNA by RTePCR may not contain live virus with infectivity. However, the molecular analysis showed extensive and prolonged environmental viral contamination surrounding clustered hPIV-3-infected patients by a nearly identical strain. In particular, the fomites, easily overlooked during routine daily cleaning (i.e. television remote control) or frequently manipulated by healthcare workers (i.e. the fluid infusion regulator and stethoscope), were consistently positive during environmental sampling and might have served as the episource during this outbreak. Therefore, these data provide more direct insight into the possible routes of nosocomial transmission of hPIV-3. Second, we did not perform air sampling. A previous study showed the limited role of aerosol as a mode of hPIV transmission [23] . Finally, in the phylogenetic analysis of the HN gene, differences in a small number of nucleotides (nt) (1e3 bp) within the given 450 bp were grouped together. Although one might postulate that even more than three nucleotide differences may not represent different strains of viruses but rather reflect errors introduced during RTePCR, the clear epidemiologic link supports the grouping in cluster 1. On the contrary, in cluster 5, due to the low discriminative ability of the HN gene analysis and uncertain epidemiologic link, we further analysed the F gene, another variable region, and carried out sequence alignments for hPIV-3 amplicons in some strains.",
