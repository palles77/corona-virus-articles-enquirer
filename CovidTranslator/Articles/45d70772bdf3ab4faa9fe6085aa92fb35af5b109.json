            "text": "This contribution is dedicated to the memory of our colleague and friend, Frederik Bang, who uncovered some of the most intriguing questions about the biology of coronaviruses. Beginning with the discovery that mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) could grow in and destroy macrophages in culture (Bang and Warwick, 1959) and that macrophage susceptibility in uitro reflected a genetic determinant for susceptibility in the mouse, Bang and Warwick, (1960; Kantoch et al., 1963 ) constructed a simple model to explain genetic resistance and susceptibility to this virus. For more than two decades, Bang (1978 Bang ( , 1981 and his colleagues explored genetic and environmental aspects of host resistance and susceptibility to MHV, and the effects of MHV on macrophages. At the Wurzburg Symposium on the Biochemistry and Biology of Coronaviruses in 1980, Dr. Bang (1981) recounted the changes in his thinking about mechanisms of host resistance, as many of the conclusions drawn from earlier experiments were reinterpreted in the light of subsequent findings. As always, he spoke with humility and humor, and displayed his distinctive interest in host-parasite interrelations. Unfortunately, that was his last opportunity to address his colleagues in this rapidly expanding field. We shall miss him. ",

This previously unrecognized group emerged during the 1960s in the aftermath of the discovery of several new human respiratory pathogens. Avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), mouse hepatitis virus, and some newly described human respiratory viruses were noted t o have a similar appearance (Almeida and Tyrrell, 1967; McIntosh et al., 196713; Becker et al., 1967) . In contrast to myxoviruses, with which they had been previously compared (Berry et al., 1964; Mallucci, 1965) , these viruses displayed a characteristic fringe of large, distinctive, petal-shaped peplomers or spikes which resembled a crown, like the corona spinarum in religious art; hence the name coronaviruses ( Fig. 1A ; Tyrrell et al., 1968) . In addition to their morphological similarities, some of the human coronaviruses (HCV) were noted to be antigenically related to MHV (Tyrrell et al., 1968; McIntosh et al., 1969; Bradburne, 1970) . Between 1968 and 1974 , research on coronaviruses emphasized morphologic and immunologic relationships and comparative biology. Several new viruses were added t o the coronavirus group: porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (HEW, rat coronavirus (RCV), sialodacryoadenitis virus of rats (SDAV), turkey bluecomb disease virus (TCV), and neonatal bovine diarrhea coronavirus (BCV). A comprehensive review by McIntosh (1974) provides an excellent overview of early coronavirus research.",

The virions were spherical, enveloped particles ranging from 80 nm to 160 nm in diameter. They showed some pleiomorphism, and frequently had a shallow central hollow containing some negative stain. Indeed, on the basis of negatively stained images of IBV, Bingham and Almeida (1977) suggested that the morphology of coronavirus virions might resemble a punchedin sphere. Whether this represents the true morphology of the virions or is a deformation resulting from drying and negative staining remains to be determined.

This can be prevented by fixation of virions with glutaraldehyde prior to negative staining. In spontaneously disrupted preparations of coronaviruses, fragments of viral envelopes are frequently seen. However, the internal component of coronaviruses has been more difficult to visualize in negatively stained preparations. Thin sections of infected cells or virions demonstrated a flexible, cylindrical nucleocapsid which was probably helical (see Section 111,F). Johnson-Lussenberg ( 1975-1976) showed that threadlike nucleocapsids, 8-9 nm in diameter, were released from disrupted HCV-229E virions. These were very pleiomorphic and may represent strands which had uncoiled from helical nucleocapsids. The most tightly coiled helical nucleocapsids were obtained from virions which were spontaneously disrupted by storage at 25\u00b0C overnight. found hollow, helical nucleocapsids, 14-16 nm in diameter and up to 0.32 pm long, released from purified preparations of HCV-229E and MHV-3 virions. The unit length of coronavirus nucleocapsids has not yet been determined, although nucleocapsids up to 6 pm long have been observed . Caul et al. (1979) purified helical nucleocapsids from HCV-229E (Fig.  1B) . The nucleocapsid was about 9-11 nm in diameter. Coronavirus nucleocapsids appeared to be more flexible and easier to uncoil than paramyxovirus nucleocapsids. Recent studies of helical nucleocapsids of negative-stranded RNA viruses (Heggeness et al., 1980 (Heggeness et al., , 1982 showed that these properties depended upon the ionic strength and cation composition of the buffers. It appears likely that the appropriate conditions for further characterization of the structure of coronavirus nucleocapsids will be identified in the near future.",

However, both of these cell lines contained endogenous retroviruses (David-Ferreira and Manaker, 1965; Dales and Howatson, 19611 , thus limiting their usefulness for propagation and biochemical studies of MHV.

A \"spontaneously\" transformed BALB/c 3T3 cell line, designated 17 C1 1, was also shown to be a highly permissive host for MHV, yielding >lo8 PFU per milliliter.

We will use this model and the nomenclature developed during our studies of the structural proteins of MHV for the following discussion of coronavirus structural proteins and their organization. The envelope of the intact virions contains two envelope glycoproteins, E l and E2, in a lipid bilayer. The helical nucleocapsid is composed of a single long strand of message sense, genomic RNA with the nucleocapsid protein, N. Glycosaminoglycan is associated with the viral envelope.

            "text": "Virions labeled with 14C glucosamine (0-0) and SH fucose (O---O) showed two classes of glycoproteins. The E l glycoproteins were labeled with glucosamine but not with fucose, whereas the E2 glycoproteins were labeled with both. (Adapted from Sturman and Holmes, 1977, with permission.) teins (gp180 and gp90) were labeled with both fucose and glucosamine, whereas the E l glycoproteins (gp23, gp38, and gp60) were labeled with glucosamine but not fucose (Fig. 4B) . A surprising finding was the demonstration that E l (gp23) aggregated when heated to 100\u00b0C in the presence of SDS and mercaptoethanol, generating several forms of higher apparent molecular weights (Sturman, 1977; Fig. 4B) . When virions were solublized in SDS at 37\"C, only a single broad peak at 23K was observed (Fig. 5A) . The 180K form of E2 could be converted quantitatively to 90K by treatment of intact virions with trypsin, which did not remove the peplomers ( Fig. 6 ; Sturman and Holmes, 1977) . When the 180 and 90K E2 glycoproteins were extracted from polyacrylamide gels and further digested with trypsin, virtually identical tryptic peptide patterns resulted. These results suggested either that proteolytic were prepared for PAGE by incubating at 37\u00b0C for 30 minutes instead of boiling. The E l glycoprotein did not aggregate into dimers and trimers as shown in Fig. 4 , but migrated as a broad peak of 23K. Designations and molecular weights of the viral structural proteins are indicated above the arrows. (B) When virions similarly labeled were incubated with the proteolytic enzyme bromelain, the E2 glycoprotein and the 5K glycosylated portion of E l were removed, leaving an 18K portion protected within the viral envelope with the nucleocapsid protein N (VP 50K). (Adapted from Sturman and Holmes, 1977 , with permission.) virions with 10 pgiml trypsin, the 180K form of E2 was quantiatively converted into the 90K formb), while the other two structural proteins were unchanged. (Adapted from Sturman and Holmes, 1977, with permission.) cleavage of the 180K form of E2 yielded two different 90K forms which comigrated, or that the 180K E2 might be a covalently linked dimer of a single 90K species. Thus, although the MHV virion was composed of only three major structural proteins, multiple forms of E l and E2 were generated by aggregation and proteolysis. Similar observations have been made with some other coronaviruses (see below). The structures and functions of these two glycoproteins will be considered in detail in Section IV. The study of MHV-A59 also provided information about the relative ratios of the structural proteins and their orientation in the virion. On the basis of incorporation of radioisotopic labels, we estimated that the proteins occur in virions in a ratio of 8 N : 16 El:l E2 . As with TGEV, treatment of virions with bromelain or Pronase resulted in the loss of E2 (Fig. 5B ) and removal of the peplomers or spikes on the virion (Sturman and Holmes, 1977) . Pronase also removed a 5K glycosylated portion of E l , which suggested that a terminal glycosylated region of E l was exposed on the outer surface of the viral envelope, while a larger (18K) nonglycosylated region was protected within the envelope. Since Pronase treatment of intact virions did not affect N (50K1, N was thought to be an internal protein. The structural relationships of these three viral polypeptides are summarized in the model in Fig. 3 . Wege et al. (1979) , investigating the structural proteins of the JHM strain of MHV, detected two species of E l on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) which appeared to correspond to nonglycosylated and glycosylated forms of E l . In addition, they showed that the E2 (90K) of MHV-JHM could be resolved into two distinct bands. In contrast to E2 from MHV-A59, the E2 of JHM became aggregated with E l when heated to 100\u00b0C and remained near the origin of the resolving gel (Wege et al., 1979; Siddell et al., 1981b) . Comparison of a variety of strains of MHV revealed that some of the homologous polypeptides from different strains were distinguishable by PAGE (Stohlman and Lai, 1979; Anderson et al., 1979; Bond et al., 1979; Cheley et al., 1981b) . This may be useful in genetic and complementation studies. Stohlman and Lai (1979) demonstrated that the N polypeptide of MHV was phosphorylated on serine residues (Fig. 7) . Subsequently, '*I Siddell et al. (1981a) identified a cyclic AMP-independent protein kinase activity which copurified with the virion (Fig. 8) . The functional significance of phosphorylation for transcription, translation, or maturation of the viral nucleocapsid is not yet known. The nucleotide sequence of the RNA encoding the nucleocapsid protein of MHV-A59 was recently determined by Armstrong et al. (1983) . This sequence contained a single long open reading frame encoding a protein of molecular weight 49,660 which was enriched in basic residues. There was also a second short, open reading frame in this sequence predicting a polypeptide of 90 amino acids. However, no such product has yet been identified.",

As coronaviruses were often grouped with myxoviruses in early classification schemes, it is interesting to note that both E l and E2 contained sialic acid, unlike the myxovirus glycoproteins. E2 also contained substantial amounts of mannose and galactose plus fucose, glucose, and N-acetylglucosamine. These sugars are all found in high mannose and complex oligosaccharides which are derived from a mannose-trisaccharide core Nglycosidically linked to asparagine residues in the protein. The oligosaccharide side chains of E l were strikingly different from those of E2, in that they lacked fucose and contained a high proportion of Nacetylgalactosamine, which was absent from E2. Recent evidence indicates that in MHV-infected cells labeled with glucosamine, the glucosamine is converted to N-acetylgalactosamine prior to incorporation into the E l glycoprotein (H. Niemann, personal communication).",

The same conclusion was reached by others (Holmes et al., 1981a,b; Siddell et al., 1981c; Rottier et al., 1981b) based on the resistance of the glycosylation of E l to tunicamycin, an inhibitor specific for N-glycosylation. Such 0-linked glycoproteins had not been found previously in viruses. The glycopeptides of E l and E2 were readily distinguishable by electrophoresis on borate-polyacrylamide gels at high pH (Sturman, 1981; Holmes et al., 1981a) and by column chromatography on Biogel P6 (Niemann and Klenk, 1981a) . Niemann and Klenk (1981b) demonstrated conclusively that the oligosaccharide moieties on E l were attachd by 0glycosidic linkages since they could be released by p-elimination with sodium borohydride. Recently, H. Niemann et al. (personal communication) have used high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) to characterize two species of oligosaccharide chains released from E 1 by p-elimination. These are shown in Fig. 9 . It is highly probable that the virus makes use of host-cell enzymes for 0-linked glycosylation as other viruses do for N-linked glycosylation. Thus, the E l glycoprotein of MHV is of considerable interest as a model for studying the synthesis and glycosylation of 0-linked cellular glycoproteins (see Sections II1, D and IV, B) .",

Initial observations suggested that coronaviruses contained segmented or multimeric genomes (Tannock, 1973; . There were also indications of possible RNA polymerase activity associated with the virion . These findings were in accord with the belief then current that coronaviruses were probably similar to myxoviruses. Then Watkins et al. (1975) demonstrated that high-molecular-weight RNA could be extracted from IBV virions. The large, single-stranded, linear RNA molecules obtained from IBV were shown to be polyadenylated and infectious (Schochetman et al., 1977; Lomniczi, 1977; Lomniczi and Kennedy, 1977 ; Macnaughton and Madge, 197713) . Lomniczi and Kennedy (1977) characterized the IBV genome by electrophoresis on methyl mercury gels and by T1 oligonucleotide fingerprinting. This approach also proved to be very useful in the comparative analysis of coronavirus genomes and subgenomic virus-specific mRNAs (see Section IID). extracted high-molecular-weight (60-70 S) RNA from TGEV and HEV. However, they observed that the RNA was dissociable above 60\u00b0C into 35 and 4 S species. Tannock and Hierholzer (1977) also reported releasing 4 S RNA from HCV-OC43 RNA and fragmentation of the 70 S RNA after heating at 60\u00b0C. Lai and Stohlman (1978) found a variable amount of 4 S RNA in MHV preparations, in addition to 60 S RNA. Garwes et al. (19751, Pocock and Garwes (19751, Tannock and Hierholzer (19771, and Lai and Stohlman (1978) demonstrated that the size and heterogeneity of the virion RNA which was isolated was affected by the time of virus harvest, the pH of the culture medium, the method of virus purification and duration of virus storage, and the method of RNA extraction. Greater fragmentation of coronavirus RNA was observed if virions were harvested at 24 hours postinfection versus 16 hours, if cultures were kept at pH 7.2 or 8.0 and not at pH 6.5, if virus was purified on potassium tartrate equilibrium gradients instead of sucrose gradients, if virions were stored for 24 hours at 4\u00b0C before RNA extraction, and if the RNA was extracted in the presence of phenol. Fragmentation was readily detected after heating the RNA at 60\u00b0C or higher, and by centrifugation through dimethyl sulfoxide gradients. This behavior of coronavirus RNA, as well as other aspects of the structure and physiocochemical properties of coronaviruses, is discussed in the excellent review by Garwes (1980) . It now appears that coronavirus genomes are 5.4-6.9 x lo6 daltons in size, which corresponds to about 16,000-21,000 nucleotides. RNA genomes in this size range have been detected in virions of IBV (Schochetman et al., 1977; Macnaughton and Madge, 197713; Macnaughton, 1978; Stern and Kennedy, 1980a) , MHV (Yogo et al., 1977; Lai and Stohlman, 1978; Wege et al., 1981b; Macnaughton, 1978; Spaan et al., 1981; Weiss and Leibowitz, 19811, HCV (Tannock and Hierholzer, 1977; Macnaughton and Madge, 1978; Macnaughton, 1978) , TGEV and HEV Brian et al., 19801, and BCV (Brian et al., 1980) . The genomic RNA is infectious (Lomniczi, 1977; Schochetman et al., 1977; Wege et al., 1978; Brian et al., 19801, capped (Lai and Stohlman, 1981; Lai et al., 1982a) , and polyadenylated (Schochetman et al., 1977; Lomniczi, 1977; Yogo et al., 1977; Madge, 1977b, 1978; Wege et al., 1978; Lai and Stohlman, 1978; Guy and Brian, 1979; .

Large fragments of RNA were produced by partial alkali fragmentation of the genome. These fragments were fractionated into different size classes by sedimentation on sucrose density gradients, and polyadenylated RNAs were selected for T1 oligonucleotide analysis. The same approach was applied to MHV by Lai et al. (1980) . These studies disclosed that there was no significant reiteration of oligonucleotides within the genome. Analysis of the genetic complexity of the virion RNA indicated that it was all of the same sense. Since genomic RNA was infectious, the virion RNA must be of positive or message sense. T1 oligonucleotide analysis of coronavirus genomes has been employed for comparisons of virus isolates and strains, for characterization of mutants, and for epidemiological investigations. The T1 oligonucleotide fingerprints of the two isolates of the Beaudette strain of IBV which were studied by Lomniczi and Kennedy (1977) and Stern and Kennedy (1980a) were found to be quite different. Subsequently, Clewley et al. (1981) distinguished 11 oligonucleotide fingerprint patterns from 13 isolates of IBV, revealing differences between IBV serotypes, and also between different preparations of a single serotype. This suggested that considerable variation in the genome may be characteristic of IBV, and possibly of other coronaviruses as well.",

Viral subunits have also been generated for structural and immunologic analysis by solubilization of the envelope with nonionic detergents such as NP-40 or Triton X-100 in low salt concentrations. After detergent disruption of the viral envelope, solubilized glycoproteins could be separated from the nucleocapsid by sedimentation in sucrose density gradients. Garwes et al. (1976) were the first to report isolation of the surface projections and nucleocapsid of a coronavirus, TGEV, by this technique. Immunization with NP-40-solubilized, gradient-purified TGEV suface projections (E2) induced neutralizing antibodies (see Section IV,A). Johnson-Lussenberg (1975-1976 ) isolated a nucleoprotein from 2293 by a similar method. Similar studies were carried out with HEV and MHV-JHM (Pocock and Garwes, 1977; Wege et al., 1979) . In these studies, the nucleocapsid sedimented at a density of 1.24-1.29 gm/ml and was found to consist of RNA in association with both N and E l structural proteins. Electron microscopy revealed spherical \"cores\" 60 to 70 nm in diameter, sometimes with a strand approximately 9 nm in diameter inside. Helical nucleocapsids (Fig. 1B) were not observed in these studies. In similar studies on NP-40-disrupted MHV-A59 (Sturman et al., 19801 , we found that the temperature of solubilization determined whether E l would be isolated separately or in association with the nucleocapsid. Solubilization a t 4\u00b0C yielded separate peaks of E l , E2, and nucleocapsid (p = 1.28 gm/ml; Fig. lOA) , whereas incubation of the viral extract at 37\u00b0C for 30 minutes resulted in quantitative binding of E l t o the nucleocapsid forming an E1-N-RNA complex (p = 1.22 gm/ml; Fig. 10B ). In negatively stained preparations, purified E l formed irregular aggregates of varied size, whereas purified E2 was in the form of single peplomers or rosette-like aggregates of about 12 peplomers ( Fig. 1C and D). Purified E l and E2 were used to raise monospecific antisera for the analysis of the functions of the glycoproteins (Holmes et al., 1981b; Section IV) .",

A nested set of five or six subgenomic mRNAs are elaborated, each of which codes for a single protein. There is some evidence which suggests that RNA fusion may play a role in coronavirus replication. In some cases an O-linked envelope glycoprotein is formed which exhibits restricted intracellular transport. The cellular secretory apparatus may be used for release of virions. While much clearly remains to be learned about the replication of coronaviruses, it is already apparent that they utilize many novel ways of solving the problems of virus replication.",

The genomic RNA acts as mRNA to direct the synthesis of viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. This enzyme copies the genomic RNA to form full-length, negative-stranded templates. From these templates, using the viral RNA polymerase, a series of subgenomic mRNAs are synthesized. These mRNAs form a nested set with common 3' ends. All are capped and polyadenylated. Each of the mRNAs apparently codes for a single gene product. The functions of the nonstructural gene products NS 14K and NS 35K are not known. RNA7 codes for the synthesis of N protein on free ribosomes. The N protein associates with newly formed genomic RNA to form the viral nucleocapsid. RNA3 and -6 are translated on membranebound ribosomes t o yield E2 and E l , respectively. The peplomeric glycoprotein E2 is cotranslationally glycosylated at asparagine residues and the core oligosaccharides are trimmed as the glycoprotein migrates through the Golgi apparatus. The membrane glycoprotein, E 1, migrates to the Golgi apparatus where oligosaccharides are added to the serine residues posttranslationally. Virions are formed by budding in the rough endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus, but not at the plasma membrane. E2 migrates readily to the plasma membrane, but intracellular transport of E l is limited to the Golgi apparatus. Virions are released from intact cells by fusion of post-Golgi vesicles with the plasma membrane, possibly using the cellular secretory apparatus. Numerous virions adsorb to the plasma membrane of infected cells. Coronavirus-induced cytopathic effects include cell fusion and rounding of infected cells. ningham, 1959; Bingham et al., 19751, BCV (Sharpee et al., 1976) , rabbit enteric coronavirus (LaPierre et al., 19801, HCV-OC38/43 (Kaye and Dowdle, 19691, and MHV (Sugiyama and Amano, 1980; Walker and Clantor, 19801 , can cause hemagglutination (see Section IV,A). Mengeling et al. (1972) showed that HEV bound to avian erythrocytes by the tips of the viral peplomers. Binding of IBV to erythrocytes was studied by Bingham et al. (19751, who found that the binding was inhibited by protease and neuraminidase treatment, and enhanced by phospholipase C treatment of erythrocytes. Shif and Bang (1970) suggested that MHV-2 bound equally well to macrophages from mice genetically susceptible or resistant to MHV-2. They demonstrated equivalent amounts of infectious virus remaining in the supernatant medium over macrophage cultures after virus adsorption. Binding of MHV-A59 to L2 cells in spinner culture was studied by Richter (19761, who found that the cell surface receptor activity was removed by protease treatment of the cells. This suggested that the receptor was a protein. Attachment occurred at 4 C and more rapidly at 37\u00b0C. Saturation of virus receptor sites was achieved with only about 700 virus particles per cell. Additional studies showed that at 4\u00b0C MHV-A59 bound to splenic lymphocytes from susceptible and resistant mice, but not to thymocytes. The interaction of MHV-3 with L cells and cells from susceptible and resistant strains of mice was studied by Krystyniak and Dupuy (1981) . At 37\"C, radioactive virions bound to macrophages, spleen cells, T lymphocytes, and thymocytes. The virus bound equally well to macrophages from genetically susceptible and resistant mice. This supports the conclusion of Shif and Bang (1970) that genetic susceptibility and resistance are not determined at the level of virus receptors.",

Electron microscopic studies of the uptake of MHV and IBV suggested that viral entry was by means of viropexis or endocytosis (Tanaka et al., 1962; David-Ferreira and Manaker, 1965; Sabesin, 1971; Patterson and Bingham, 1976) . However, other investigators suggested that coronaviruses entered the cell by fusion with the cell membrane (Doughri et al., 1976) . The possibility that MHV-3 may enter the cell by fusion with the plasma membrane was supported by the observation of Krystyniak and Dupuy ( 1981) that MHV-3 could infect cells treated with cytochalasin B to prevent phagocytosis. Adsorbed virions rapidly became associated with lysosomes (David-Ferreira and Manaker, 1965; Sebesin, 1971) . Virus uptake via coated pits was also observed (Chasey and Alexander, 1976; Arnheiter et al., 1982) . Chloroquine, a lysosomotropic drug that elevates the pH in lysosomes and prevents penetration of Semliki Forest virus and influenza virus through the endosomal membrane (Helenius et al., 1980b, 19821 , was found to inhibit the replication of MHV by affecting a stage subsequent to virus adsorption (Mallucci, 1966) .",

In IBV-infected cells, six virus-specific RNA species were In this diagram each oligonucleotide in the RNase T1 fingerprint is labeled according to the smallest subgenomic mRNA species in which it appears. The unlabeled nucleotides were not included in subgenomic RNA E and hence, presumably, represent sequences between the 5' end of the genome and RNA E. (Adapted from Stern and Kennedy, 1980a,b, with permission.) identified by electrophoresis on agarose-glyoxal gels. All of these RNAs were polyadenylated and therefore likely to be of message sense. Together, the five subgenomic species greatly exceeded the total size of the genomic RNA, suggesting that the subgenomic RNAs shared some sequences. Comparison of T1 oligonucleotide digests of these intracellular RNAs, as shown in Figs. 12 and 13, revealed that they formed a \"nested' set of sequences. The oligonucleotides of the smallest mRNA were contained within the next larger mRNA, and so on. These data also showed that the genomic RNA was of the same sense as the mRNA since they shared the same oligonucleotides. The possible origin of several unique oligonucleotides found in RNAs A and C will be discussed later. By ordering the T1 oligonucleotides of the genomic RNA through analyses of poly(A)-containing fragments produced by limited alkaline hydrolysis (see Section II,D), Stern and Kennedy 11980b) showed that all of the subgenomic mRNAs shared common sequences extending from the 3' terminus of the genome.",

However, some caution must be exercised in accepting this as proven. In all of the in uitro translation studies, RNAG has been shown to direct the synthesis of E l , plus a fairly large amount of N (Siddell, 1980 (Siddell, , 1981c Rottier et al., 1981a; Leibowitz and Weiss, 1981; Fig. 15 ). This has been ascribed to contamination of RNAG with RNA7 and a higher efficiency of translation of RNA7. It is possible that RNAG alone might direct the synthesis of several gene products, both E l and N. In Semliki Forest virus, an enveloped, positive-stranded RNA containing alphavirus, a large polycistronic mRNA is translated to yield both glycosylated envelope glycoprotein and nonglycosylated capsid protein (Schlesinger and Kaariainen, 1980) . The translation of RNA4 and -5 of MHV has been difficult to study because these RNA species are present in such small amounts. So far only the 14K NS protein has been identified as a product for these two mRNAs. In vitro translation studies using microsomal membrane fractions have not yet been done with coronavirus mRNAs. Such studies would permit the analysis of glycosylation, acylation, and processing of the glycoproteins.",

Concurrent studies of the structural proteins of the virion and analyses of the mRNAs and their translation products set limits on the probable number of virus-specific polypeptides, and established that the structural proteins were not derived from a large polyprotein precursor. The intracellular proteins of MHV and IBV were identified in many laboratories at almost the same time. Much of this information was presented at the 1980 Coronavirus Symposium and was summarized in the review by Siddell et al. (1982) . The intracellular proteins identified included N, E l , and E2, and three nonstructural species: 30-35K and 14K nonglycosylated polypeptides, and a 65K glycoprotein. The 30-35K species has not been detected in virions. However, minor proteins of approximately 14K and 65K have been found in some coronaviruses (Wege et al., 1979; Siddell et al., 1981a; Rottier et al., 1981b , though not in others (e.g., Sturman, 1977; Macnaughton, 1981; Rottier et al., 1981b; Lomniczi and Morser, 1981; Niemann and Klenk, 1981a; Bond et al., 1981; see Siddell et al., 1982 , for further references).

Not surprisingly, differences were detected in the rates of shutdown of cellular protein synthesis in these different systems. Other differences between lytic and moderate coronavirus-cell interactions were also noted. Synthesis of MHV proteins in lytic infections appeared to be coordinated throughout the replication cycle Rottier et al., 1981b) , whereas in cells showing minimal CPE, the synthesis of N was detected much earlier than that of E l and E2 (J. Behnke, personal communication). Pulse-labeling experiments at different times after infection and at different temperatures revealed that the synthesis of E l and E2 in these cells was coordinated, but different from the synthesis of N.",

At 6 hours after infection with MHV-A59, cells were pulse labeled for 15 minutes with [3H]-leucine and then incubated with excess cold leucine. There were no polyproteins observed. E2 is synthesized as the high-molecular-weight form, and no 90K E2 was observed in these cells. The N protein was synthesized in large amounts and appeared to be processed into two faster migrating species. The E l was synthesized as a nonglycosylated species which was posttranslationally glycosylated. Both the glycoproteins were chased out of the cell into mature virions within 2-3 hours after labeling. Only a small fraction of the N protein was chased into mature virions. (Adapted from Holmes et al., 1981b, with permission.) tion, E l and E2 were quantitatively chased out of cells and into virions within about 2 hours (Holmes et al., 1981b; Fig. 16 ). However, in lytic infection of Sac(-) cells, E l chased into virions within 2-2.5 hours after labeling, while much of the E2 remained cell associated for up to 3 hours . Another difference between lytic and moderate infections related to the appearance of E l and E2 on the surface of infected cells. Both E l and E2 antigens of MHVJHM were detected on the surface of lytically infected L cells prior to the release of progeny virions (Collins et al., 1982) . In contrast, E2 was the predominant viral glycoprotein on the surface of 17 C1 1 cells during the early stages of a moderate infection with MHV-A59 (Doller and Holmes, 1980 ; Section III,D,2). To date, cleavage of the E2 glycoprotein has been detected only in lytically infected cells. Indeed, cleavage of E2 may be responsible for the extensive cell fusion seen in lytically infected cultures (L. S. Sturman and K. V. Holmes, unpublished observation) . These host-dependent differences may reflect differences in host-dependent processes required for maturation of coronaviruses. The features of the synthesis, processing, and transport of coronavirus structural proteins which are consistent in all cell systems are described in the following paragraphs.",

This suggested that there was a large intracellular pool of N, most of which did not chase into virions, but was incorporated into nucleocapsids or replicative intermediates which never left the cell. Recently, it was shown that N was synthesized on free ribosomes (Niemann et al., 1982) . Intracellular N was phosphorylated at serine residues, as was N in the virion (Siddell et al., 1981a,b) . During a 2-hour chase, an intracellular form of N with slightly greater electrophoretic mobility was detected within infected L cells (Anderson et al., 1979) . This process was believed to be due to proteolytic processing of N (Cheley and Anderson, 1981) . The proportion of the smaller species increased following immunoprecipitation (Siddell et al., 1980; Rottier et al., 1981a) , which led to the suggestion that these additional species represented molecules of N partially degraded by serum or cellular proteases. In pulse-labeling studies, these forms of N have been detected in cells without immunoprecipitation late in the infectious cycle of MHV-A59 (J. N. Behnke and K. V. Holmes, unpublished observations) . Analysis of peptide maps of these different forms of N will be required to determine their relationships.",

The addition of sugars to this O-linked glycoprotein began 15 to 30 minutes after completion of the apoprotein, and continued for 1-2 hours (Holmes et al., 1981b; Rottier et al., 1981b) with production of two or three discrete glycosylated species. However, not all of the E l which entered the virion was glycosylated (Rottier et al., 1981b) . The oligosaccharide side chains of the E l glycoprotein are shown in Fig. 9 . Niemann et al. (submitted for publication) have estimated that there are three oligosaccharide chains per E l molecule.

In contrast, E2 rapidly dispersed throughout the cell membranes and appeared on the plasma membrane. The mechanisms and signals for intracellular transport of E l are not yet understood. Possibly E l is transported by cellular mechanisms which transport cellular glycoproteins destined for the Golgi apparatus. Since E l is a transmembrane protein and has been shown to interact with viral nucleocapsid in uitro, it appears likely that the localization of E l on the rough endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi membranes determines the site of virus budding.",

As noted below, there is considerable controversy over the relationship between the 180 and 90K forms of E2. This controversy may relate to differences in processing of E2 in different cell types. A 110-120K apoprotein was detected in MHV-A59 infected Sac(-) and 17 C1 1 cells treated with tunicamycin Rottier et al., 1981b; Niemann and Klenk, 1981a) . This is similar to the in uitro translation product of RNA3 in L-cell or reticulocyte lysates in which glycosylation does not occur (Rottier et al., 1981a; Siddell et al., l980,1981c) , and probably represents the protein moiety of the E2 glycoprotein. Translation of mRNA3 inXenopus laeuis oocytes permitted glycosylation and yielded a 150K E2 glycoprotein (Rottier et al., 1981a; Fig. 15 ).

(A) Monospecific anti-El antiserum was used to stain E l antigens within the cytoplasm of infected cells. The E l accumulated in a sharply demarcated region near the nucleus and did not migrate to the plasma membrane as readily as did E2.

This demonstrates that the E l accumulates in the Golgi apparatus. X960.",

Although in moderate infection of MHV-A59 in 17 C1 1 cells, little or no 90K E2 was detected at 8-10 hours after infection (Holmes et al., 1981b; Fig. 16) , in Sac ( -) cells infected with MHV-JHM or -A59, a substantial amount of 90K E2 was detected after 60-to 90-minute chase (Siddell et al., 1981c; Rottier et al., 1981b) . Siddell et a2. (1981~) have suggested that the 150K precursor to E2 may be cleaved to a 90K protein which dimerizes to form the 180K E2. Based on our studies with MHV-A59, we believe that two different 90K forms of E2 result from proteolytic cleavage of the 180K E2 which occurs as a late step in the intracellular transport or processing of E2 and the maturation of the virions. Recently, Stern and Sefton (198213) showed by tryptic peptide mapping that the two large virion glycoproteins of IBV, gp90, and gp84, were produced by cleavage of a 155K glycoprotein precursor (gp155). Although the cellular location at which the E2 glycoprotein undergoes acylation has not been identified, acylation of the VSV glycoprotein has been shown to occur near the Golgi complex (Schmidt, 198213) .",

Immunofluorescent staining of E2 with monospecific antiserum stained the cytoplasm diffusely, E2 appeared on the plasma membrane at a time when intracellular transport of E l was directed to the Golgi apparatus (Holmes et al., 1981b; Doller et al., 1983) . Treatment of MHV-infected cells with tunicamycin resulted in a marked inhibition in the synthesis of E2 (Holmes et al., 1981b) , although late in infection some nonglycosylated E2 could be detected (Niemann and Klenk, 1981a) . Virions isolated from tunicamycintreated cells contained no E2 (Sturman, 1981) and no peplomers (Holmes et al., 1981a,b) . This suggested that E2 was not required for virus budding or for the release of virions from infected cells. Brian (1981, 1982) and B. W. J. Mahy et al. (1983) first detected RNA-dependent RNA polymerase activity in cells infected with TGEV and MHV. This activity was insensitive to antinomycin D and was associated with cytoplasmic membrane fractions like that of alphaviruses. Brayton et al. (1982) and Lai et czl. (1982b) have characterized the viral RNA polymerase activity in MHV-A59-infected cells. By pretreatment of cells with actinomycin D for 1 hour before infection and synchronization of infection by adsorbing virus at 0-4\"C, Brayton et al. (1982) detected virus-specific RNA synthesis in MHV-A59-infected cells as early as 1 hour after infection. Two peaks of virusspecific RNA synthesis were demonstrated, one early (2 hours) and the other late (6 hours) after infection (Fig. 18 ). Corresponding to these, two different virus-specific RNA polymerase activities were detected, early and late in infection. These two polymerases were distinguished by different responses to potassium and different pH optima. The RNA product of the early polymerase was of negative-strand polarity, complementary to the genomic RNA, whereas the products of the late polymerase activity were predominantly of positive polarity (P. R. Brayton, personal communication) . Only a single virus-specific, negative-stranded RNA species was detected. This was the size of the complete viral genome. A double-stranded RNA form was isolated which contained RNA of genomic size. When this double-stranded RNA was isolated without RNase treatment and heated, subgenomic mRNAs were released. This suggested that the virus-specific mRNAs were Incorporation of radiolabel into virus-specific RNA in cells infected with MHV-A59 occurs in two peaks which show different ionic requirements. The early peak is believed to represent synthesis of full-length, negative-stranded RNA templates, and the later peak is believed to represent synthesis of mRNAs and genomic RNA.

Ultraviolet transcription mapping was done to identify the size of the template(s) for the synthesis of the mRNAs. Jacobs et al., (1981 ; Table IV ) and Stern and Sefton (1982a) found that b K x T was calculated from the relationship in (N,No) = K x T x t, where N t represents the incorporation of [\"Iuridine into RNA after t seconds of UV irradiation, N o is the RNA synthesis in the unirradiated culture, T is the target size, and K is a constant. The calculation was made from the data points by using linear regression analysis. The value ofK was calculated as 6.38 x 10 -9s -1 by substituting a value of 5.6 x 106 for the target size of R N A l (experiment l), or as 10.3 x by inserting a value of 1.4 x 106 for RNA4 (experiment 2). c By using the two values for K described in footnote b, the target sizes for the other RNAs were calculated. d The molecular weights of the denatured, virus-specific RNAs were determined by agarose gel electrophoresis. the UV target sizes of the templates for the mRNAs of MHV-A59 and IBV were the same as the sizes of the respective mRNAs. Since the UV mapping studies were done at 5.5 and 6.0 hours postinfection, when synthesis of the negatively stranded template may have been completed, it appears likely that only the synthesis of the mRNA species was being inactivated by UV.",

Stern and Kennedy (1980a,b) found several T1 oligonucleotides in mRNA species which were not present in larger mRNAs. , , and Spaan et al. (1982) also identified several T1 oligonucleotides in subgenomic mRNAs which were not present in the viral genome of MHV, or were not found in the same region in the genome. Preliminary evidence indicated that some of these oligonucleotides from several subgenomic RNAs had similar sequences . It has been suggested that these may represent junction sequences from the splicing of two unlinked stretches of RNA . Since coronaviruses can replicate in enucleated cells Brayton et al., 1981) , it appears unlikely that this splicing is done by cellular mechanisms located in the cell nucleus. Lai et al. (1982a) found that the nucleotides adjacent t o the cap structures of each of the subgenomic mRNAs contained the same sequence, 5'-CAP-N-UAAG.

A leader sequence which originates by splicing from large precursor molecules would appear to be contraindicated by the results of UV transcriptional mapping. However, a leader sequence with or without an attached cap may be derived from a small RNA of viral or cellular origin. Since viral RNA synthesis was not inhibited by antinomycin D, this leader RNA may be virus specific or perhaps derived from a stable, small, cellular RNA. The sequence -UAAG which was found adjacent to the cap structure at the 5' end of viral subgenomic mRNAs and genomic RNA (Lai et al., 1982a) is also present in some small host coded cytoplasmic RNAs, including 5s ribosomal RNA (Delihas and Andersen, 1982) and 7s RNA (Busch et al., 1982) , and U2 and U3 small nuclear RNAs (Busch et al., 1982) . Furthermore, the same order is contained in the consensus sequence a t the 5' exon-intron boundary of many splice junctions (Lerner et al., 1980) . The complementary sequence which is present in U1 SnRNA is thought to assist in the proper orientation of exons for splicing of RNA. Several models have been postulated for the utilization of a leader sequence in coronavirus transcription (Lai et al., 1982a; Spaan et al., 1982) .",

            "text": "Some of the early studies on coronavirus replication emphasized ultrastructural changes in infected cells (Svoboda et al., 1962; Tanaka et al., 1962; David-Ferreira and Manaker, 1965; Hamre et al., 1967; Becker et al., 1967) . All of these studies showed that the entire replicative cycle of coronaviruses occurred in the cytoplasm. Indeed, MHV has been shown to replicate in enucleated cells Wilhelmsen et al., 1981) , although replication of IBV in enucleated BHK-21 cells was significantly reduced (Evans and Simpson, 1980) . Ultrastructural studies on the binding and penetration of coronaviruses have been described (Section II1,B.I. The early morphological events associated with coronavirus infection were rather nonspecific ones, such as increase in cytoplasmic membranes or in the size of polysomes (David-Ferreira and Manaker, 1965; Sebesin, 197 1) . Toward the end of the viral latent period, about 6-7 hours postinfection, spherical virions approximately 60-100 nm in diameter were observed in the lumens of the rough endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, and smooth-walled vesicles (David-Ferreira and Manaker, 1965; Massalski et al., 1981; Ducatelle et al., 1981; Dubois-Dalcq et al., 1982; Fig. 19a-c) . In most instances these virions had electron-lucent centers with electron-dense granular or tubular nucleocapsids associated with the inner surface of the viral envelope. Tubular nucleocapsids were also observed under the membranes of the rough endoplasmic reticulum or Golgi apparatus (Oshiro, 1973; Holmes et al., 1981a; Massalski et al., 1981 Massalski et al., , 1982 Dubois-Dalcq et al., 1982; Fig. 19B and C) . Chasey and Alexander (1976) showed that the envelopes of budding virions were covered with peplomers. During the early stages of viral infection, virions appeared singly or in small clusters, whereas later in infection, scores of virions were found within large vesicles and occasionally within the lumen of the nuclear membrane (Fig. 20) . Budding of virions from the plasma membrane was almost never visualized. An exception was a single particle visulaized several days after virus infection of a neural cell culture (Dubois-Dalcq et al., 1982) . Although Sugiyama and Amano (1981) reported that the virions were budding from the plasma membrane, the scanning electron microscopic (SEMI images were not of sufficient resolution to demonstrate budding. In some studies, although numerous intraluminal virions were observed, no budding virions were detected. Detection of budding images apparently depended on the viral strain, the host cell type, and the time after virus inoculation (Watanabe, 1969) . Budding virions were most likely to be detected late in the infectious cycle. This suggests that these images represent arrested buds, and that during the early stages of infection coronavirus budding may be a very rapid process.",

Release by fusion of virus-filled, smooth-walled vesicles with the plasma membrane has also been observed (Doughri et al., 1976) . When the kinetics of release of infectious virus was correlated with cell lysis by microcinematography, however, it was apparent that the infectious virions were released from intact cells (K. V. Holmes, unpublished observations) . Indeed, it appears that release of virus depends upon the good condition of the host cells. The generally accepted mechanism of coronavirus release from infected cells is via fusion of virus-filled vesicles with the plasma membrane (Doughri et al., 1976) . Thus, the coronaviruses may be released from cells by utilizing a cellular transport mechanism developed for secretion or exocytosis of the contents of secretory vesicles. I n uiuo, the target cells for replication of many coronaviruses are epithelial cells with tight junctions in the respiratory or gastrointestinal tract. In polarized cells such as these, influenza virus and VSV have been shown to bud specifically from the apical or basilar plasma membranes (Rodriguez-Boulan and Sabatini, 1978) . There is as yet little evidence to show whether the fusion with the plasma membrane of vesicles filled with coronaviruses exhibits specificity for basal or apical membranes. Secretory cells do demonstrate strong polarity in the direction of secretion of cellular secretory products such as enzymes from pancreatic acinar cells. It is possible that some polarity of coronavirus release may be identified. To date, in the only study which addresses this point, Doughri and Storz (1977) observed that porcine coronavirus could be seen on both apical and basal cell surfaces of intestinal epithelial cells. FIG. 20 . Coronavirus virions in the rough endoplasmic reticulum and nuclear envelope. Late in the infectious cycle, numerous spherical virions accumulate within the rough endoplasmic reticulum and the nuclear envelope (N) (arrows). ~3 6 , 0 0 0 . (From J. N. Behnke.) Late in the infectious cycle, it was common to find very large numbers of virions adsorbed to the surface of infected cells (Oshiro et al., 1971; Oshiro, 1973; Doughri and Storz, 1977) . Scanning electron microscopy showed these most effectively (Sugiyama and Amano, 1981 It is not clear what function, if any, may be served by this adsorption to infected cells. Most of the virions appeared to remain on the surface without being internalized, although some were found in lysosomes (Sabesin, 1971) .",

David-Ferreira and Manaker (1965) found \"reticular inclusions\" in MHV-infected cells. These consisted of masses of interconnected tubules of smooth membranes in continuity with the rough endoplasmic reticulum (Fig. 21A) . They have only occasionally been observed with other coronaviruses. A second type of inclusion was observed near the reticular inclusions. This consisted of vacuoles about 200 nm in diameter containing flexible coiled filaments about 30 nm in diameter. These filamentous structures were surrounded by a double membrane ( Fig. 21B ; David-Ferreira and Manaker, 1965; Takeuchi et al., 1976) . Third, \"tubular inclusions\" consisting of interconnected tubules 16 to 25 nm in diameter were observed near the reticular inclusions (David-Ferriera and Manaker, 1965; Watanabe, 1969) . Inclusions consisting of interconnected virions within the lumen of smoothwalled vesicles have also been observed (Oshiro et al., 1971) . Within the lumen of the rough endoplasmic reticulum and smooth-walled vesicles, long, rigid, cylindrical structures about 50 nm in diameter have occasionally been detected (Fig. 21C; Dubois-Dalcq et al., 1982) . These may represent an excess of the E l glycoprotein since they occur frequently in tunicamycin-treated infected cells, where synthesis of E2 is greatly reduced (Holmes et al., 1981a) . It is evident from the preceding descriptions that coronaviruses produce a wide variety of effects in different cell types. Further studies are needed to determine the composition of these different virus-associated structures.",

Although many variants have been isolated from natural infections. there are few well-charac-terized, chemically induced mutants of coronaviruses. Recently, several groups have obtained and partially characterized temperature-sensitive (ts) mutants of MHV. Almost all of the MHV mutants have been selected for failure to induce syncytium formation. Unfortunately, most of these mutants grow rather poorly, even under permissive conditions. There are few, if any, chemically induced mutants of other coronaviruses. Clearly, other phenotypes and additional mutants are needed.",

(1979) using N-methyl-N'-nitrosoguanidine and 5fluorouracil. Temperature-sensitive mutants were selected for failure to induce fusion of susceptible cells at the nonpermissive temperature (39.5\" or 385\u00b0C). The majority of the 34 mutants identified by Robb et al. were found to be RNA negative. Only three were RNA positive and exhibited synthesis of viral proteins. Some of these mutants produced altered neuropathogenesis in mice. Leibowitz et al. (1982a) performed complementation analysis of 37 ts mutants of MHV-JHM and identified seven complementation groups. Six of these affected virus-specific RNA synthesis. The gene product affected by each mutation has not yet been identified. Several of the mutants described by Haspel and his co-workers, including the ts8 mutant, are of particular interest because they induce demyelination with a much higher frequency than the wild type (Haspel et al., 1978; Knobler et al., 1981c, 19821 , and because they may form aberrant inclusions in CNS cells in uitro (Dubois-Dalcq et al., 1982) . Wege et al. (1981c Wege et al. ( , 1983 ) also isolated temperature-sensitive mutants of MHV-JHM with 5-fluorouracil and found that these mutants caused higher rates of subacute and chronic neurological diseases than did wild type virus in suckling and weanling rats. Twenty chemically induced (with 5-fluorouracil), temperature-sensitive mutants of MHV-A59 have been partially characterized by Koolen et al. (1981 Koolen et al. ( ,1983 . Most of these mutants, selected for their inability to induce syncytium formation at 40\"C, were RNA negative also. Several of the mutants exhibited altered neuropathogenic properties. A variety of coronavirus mutants have been isolated from persistently infected cultures of MHV, and are described in Section II1,H. Clearly, the potential contributions of these and other coronavirus mutants to the study of coronavirus replication are enormous. In combination with cloning of the viral mRNAs and genomic RNA, which is being done in several laboratories, mutants will be invaluable for the analysis of coronavirus genetics, pathogenesis, and replication.",

This susceptibility of PRI mice to death induced by MHV-2 was found t o be inherited as a dominant gene (Bang and Warwick, 1960; Kantoch et al., 1963) . By backcrossing, created a strain of mice congenic t o C3H mice, but bearing the dominant susceptibility to MHV-2 (C3H-ss strain).

By various manipulations, Bang and his associates were able to modulate the effects of MHV on the susceptible and resistant mice. Treatment of resistant animals with cortisone (Gallily et al., 1964) or a proteindeficient diet (Bang, 1981) rendered them susceptible so that they died from a small dose of MHV-2, and treatment of susceptible animals with concanavalin A rendered them resistant so that they could survive a normally fatal dose of MHV-2 (Weiser and Bang, 1977) .",

However, the cell culture conditions greatly affected these results. When fetal bovine serum was substituted for horse serum in the medium, the difference in virus yields between macrophages from resistant and susceptible mice was significantly reduced (Lavelle and Bang, 1971; Bang, 1981) . The mechanism for this cellular restriction of MHV-2 synthesis in cells from resistant animals under defined conditions has not yet been characterized. Shif and Bang (1970) demonstrated that the restriction was at a stage subsequent to virus adsorption, and suggested that degradation of virions within the resistant cell might be responsible. Later, Cody showed that the virus grew equally well in resistant and susceptible cells, but was one-twentieth as infective for resistant cells (Cody, 1980; Bang, 1981) . In his last publications (Bang and Cody, 1980; Bang, 1981) , Bang described recent experiments which suggested that macrophage resistance to MHV-2 was also dependent upon associated lymphocyte action.

These studies demonstrate that MHV-2, MHV-3, and MHV-JHM exhibit different patterns of host susceptibility and resistance. Although replication of MHV-2 was restricted in C3H mice, replication of MHV-3 was only partially reduced (LePrevost et al., 1975; Virelizier and Allison, 1976; Yamada et al., 1979; Taguchi et al., 1981) . Furthermore, A/J mice, which were resistant to MHVS, were susceptible to MHV-JHM (Knobler et al., 1981b) . Resistance to MHV-3 and MHV-JHM correlated with failure of the virus to replicate and with delayed appearance of CPE after low-multiplicity infection of cultures of peritoneal macrophages (Virelizier and Allison, 1976; Krzystyniak and Dupuy, 1981; Knobler et al., 1981a,b; Stohlman and Frelinger, 1981; Stohlman et al., 1982a1, neuronal cells (Knobler et al., 1981a , and hepatocytes (Arnheiter and Haller, 1981; Arnheiter et al., 1982) . Resistance was partially overcome by infection at higher multiplicities, resulting in cell destruction, although virus yields remained low (Virelizier and Allison, 1976; Arnheiter et al., 1982; Knobler et al., 1981b) . Arnheiter et al. (1982) showed by fluorescent antibody staining that in the first cycle of virus replication, resistant cultures of hepatocytes had fewer cells expressing viral antigen. However, after infection at high multiplicty (multiplicity of infection of loo), all cells contained viral antigens, including E2 and E l , but virus production was delayed and virus yields remained low. The characterization of this cellular restriction to MHV replication remains incomplete.",

Binding of E2 was inhibited by preincubation of cells with excess MHV. Virions from which the peplomers had been removed, or particles without peplomers, exhibited markedly reduced capacities for cell attachment and infection (Holmes et al., 1981a) . In HCV-OC43, monospecific antibody to E2 inhibited hemagglutination (Schmidt and Kenney, 1982) .

In accordance with this, found that most of the antibody induced during infection of human volunteers with HCV-229E was directed against the surface projections of the virus. Hasony and Macnaughton (1981) also showed that immunization of mice with E2 protected them against infection with MHV-3, whereas immunization with E l or N failed to provide protection against virus challenge. Holmes et al.

Cell fusion occurred rapidly after addition of this virus and in the absence of viral protein synthesis (Fig. 23C and D) . 6 . Proetolytic cleavage of E2 may be required for viral infectivity. However, this has not yet been proven. Many investigators have studied the effects of trypsin on coronavirus infectivity with mixed results. For example, trypsin treatment at low concentrations (10 p/mU enhanced MHV-A59 infectivity two-to threefold, whereas at high concentrations (1 mg/ml), infectivity was reduced by the same relative degree (Sturman and Holmes, 1977) . Since a large proportion of MHVassociated E2 was already in the 90K form, it has not been possible to assess the role of proteolytic cleavage of E2 as was done with the F, glycoprotein of Sendai virus and the HA, glycoprotein of influenza virus .

At first, E l was difficult to study because of its unusual tendency to aggregate upon heating at 100\u00b0C in SDS (Figs. 4 and 5; Sturman, 1977) . The generation of multimers of E l produced a variety of polypeptide patterns on SDS-PAGE depending upon the conditions of sample treatment. Aggregation of E l in SDS has been described for other strains of MHV (Wege et al., 1979) and for other coronaviruses as well (Callebaut and Pensaert, 1980; Schmidt and Kenny, 1982) .

Disulfide bonds are illustrated in this region because aggregation of E l in SDS at 100\u00b0C was markedly enhanced in the presence of reducing agents, which indicated that reduction of disulfide bonds exposed a highly hydrophobic domain (Sturman and Holmes, 1977) . 3. The third domain of E l resides on the inner surface of the envelope and may be associated with the nucleocapsid. As described earlier, after solubilization of the viral envelope with NP-40 at 4\"C, the nucleocapsid could be separated from both E l and E2, but at 37\"C, E l reassociated with the nucleocapsid see Fig. 10B ). E l has been shown to bind to RNA in the nucleocapsid. However, this interaction was not specific for MHV RNA. Nucleocapsid structures of other coronaviruses also interacted with E l (Garwes et al., 1976; Pocock and Garwes, 1977) . E l appears to be the only glycoprotein required for coronavirus budding, as shown by the fact that in MHV-infected, tunicamycin-treated cells, in which E2 was made in markedly reduced amounts and not incorporated into virions, MHV virions were formed and released normally. Therefore, we infer that E l is responsible for the formation of the viral envelope. E l of IBV contained N-linked, rather than 0linked, oligosaccharides . Glycosylation of the E l of IBV was inhibited by tunicamycin, but virions which lacked E2 and contained nonglycosylated E l were produced. Thus, glycosylation of E l was not essential for formation of IBV virions.",

ANTIGENIC RELATIONSHIPS AMONG CORONAVIRUSES Antigenic relationships among IBV, HCV, and MHV strains were first studied in detail, by immunofluorescence, hemagglutination inhibition, and neutralization, by McIntosh et al. (1969) and Bradburne (1970) . These investigators established that MHV and some human coronaviruses were antigenically related, while IBV did not cross-react with HCV or MHV. McIntoshs data indicated that there were at least two subgroups of human coronaviruses. HCV-OC38, and the very similar OC43, showed a close antigenic relationship to MHV, but none of these cross-reacted with HCV-229E. Bradburne also found an antigenic relationship between OC43 and MHV; however, he detected some cross-reactivity between HCV-229E and both OC43 and MHV. More recently, Schmidt and Kenny (19821, using rocket immunoelectrophoresis, found no evidence of cross-reactivity between any of the structural proteins of HCV-229E and OC43, whereas Gerdes et al. (1981a,b) and Hasony and Macnaughton (1982) detected some antigenic cross-reactivity between the N proteins of HCV-229E and MHV by immunoprecipitation and enzyme-linked immunoassay.",

Gerdes, Burks, and their co-workers showed that two coronaviruses (SD and SK) isolated from fresh autopsy brain tissue from two patients with multiple sclerosis (Burks et al., 1980) were serologically related to MHV-A59 and HCV-OC43 (Gerdes et al., 1981a,b) . Antisera prepared against each of the four viruses, SD, SK, A59, and OC43, precipitated all three structural proteins ( E l , E2 and N) of the other three viruses, demonstrating that the structural proteins of these viruses were antigenically related. Gerna et al. (1981) found a high degree of cross-reactivity between E2s of OC43 and BCV. Reynolds et al. (1980) showed cross-reactivity between E2s of TGEV and CCV, and Horzinek et al. 11982) have demonstrated cross-reactivity between analogous E l , E2, and N proteins of TGEV, FIPV, and CCV using radioimmune precipitation, electroblotting, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. At the present time, coronaviruses can be classified into two major subgroups: avian coronaviruses and mammalian coronaviruses. Mammalian coronaviruses can be further subdivided into a t least two subtypes. Within each subtype, individual virus species can be readily distinguished. There appears to be a great degree of antigenic diversity within some coronavirus species which have been studied extensively, including IBV and MHV. This suggests that there may be considerable antigenic drift in these coronaviruses (see Section 111,G).",

Some of the unique characteristics in the replication of coronaviruses illustrated in Fig. 11 include generation of a 3' coterminal-nested set of five or six subgenomic mRNAs, each of which appears to direct the synthesis of one protein. Two virus-specific RNA polymerase activities have been identified. Early RNA polymerase snythesizes a negative strand of genome size. A double-stranded form has been identified in the infected cell. The subgenomic mRNAs are synthesized from a fulllength, negative-stranded template by a second (late) RNA polymerase. RNA fusion or some other type of RNA modification appears to be involved in mRNA synthesis. Many of the distinctive features of coronavirus infection and coronavirus-induced diseases may result from the properties of the two coronavirus glycoproteins. The intracellular budding site, which may be important in the establishment and maintenance of persistent infections, appears to be due to the restricted intracytoplasmic migration of the E l glycoprotein, which acts as a matrix-like transmembrane glycoprotein. E 1 also exhibits distinctive behavior by self-aggregating on heating at 100\u00b0C in SDS and by its interaction with RNA in the viral nucleocapsid. The E l of MHV is an O-linked glycoprotein, unlike most other viral glycoproteins. Thus, the coronavirus system may be a useful model for the study of synthesis, glycosylation, and transport of O-linked cellular glycoproteins.",
