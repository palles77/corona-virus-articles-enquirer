Current therapies confer partial benefits either by incompletely improving airflow limitation or by reducing acute exacerbations, hence new therapies are desirable. In the absence of robust early predictors of clinical efficacy, the potential success of novel therapeutic agents in COPD will not entirely be known until the drugs enter relatively large and costly clinical trials. New predictive models in humans, and new study designs are being sought to allow for confirmation of pharmacodynamic and potentially clinically meaningful effects in early development. This review focuses on human challenge models with lipopolysaccharide endotoxin, ozone, and rhinovirus, in the early clinical development phases of novel therapeutic agents for the treatment and reduction of exacerbations in COPD.",

Ambulatory COPD patients are currently treated with long-acting bronchodilators and inhaled corticosteroids, along with systemic corticosteroids during exacerbations. There is a pressing need to develop novel approaches for the treatment of COPD and the prevention or reduction of acute exacerbations of COPD. Existing therapies give partial benefits either by incompletely improving airflow limitation or reducing acute exacerbations, hence the need for newer, more effective therapies. Evidence that existing medications reduce lung function decline in the long term has been inconclusive. The TORCH study 4 investigated the effects of combined salmeterol plus fluticasone, either component alone, and placebo, on the rate of postbronchodilator forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV 1 ) decline. The investigators found that salmeterol plus fluticasone reduced the rate of FEV 1 decline by 16 mL/year compared with placebo. Despite this large study, a meta-analysis conducted by Soriano et al 5 concluded that inhaled corticosteroids showed a significant improvement in lung function decline compared with placebo at 3 months, however, after 6 months there was no significant difference between placebo and inhaled corticosteroid treatment.",

These challenge models are representative of the local inflammatory response caused by an exacerbation of COPD; however it is important to note that these models do not reflect the actual exacerbation milieu. The models chosen are those models that have successfully been used to date in COPD drug development. Depending on the dose given during inhalation, these challenge models may also cause local and systemic inflammation, thus making them ideal for assessing the inflammatory processes in the lungs during an exacerbation and the potential therapeutic benefit of novel agents, as they mimic the local inflammatory response in the lung during an exacerbation.",

It is made up of three components: the O antigen (or O polysaccharide) side chain, the core oligosaccharide, and the lipid A moiety. 8 LPS is an extremely biologically active substance and has been used for many years in preclinical and clinical research, due to its role in activating many transcription factors. In the serum, LPS binds to a lipid-binding protein, which facilitates the association between LPS and CD14 on the cell membranes. This in turn facilitates the transfer of LPS to the TRL4/MD2 complex ( Figure 1) . 9 This triggers a signaling cascade in macrophage lineage and endothelial cells, resulting in the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines and nitric oxide, and the activation of complement and the coagulation systems that contribute to characteristic features of inflammation, and with excessive stimulation, \"endotoxic shock.\" In monocytes and macrophages, LPS triggers the production of powerful inflammatory mediators including cytokines (eg, interleukin [IL]-1, IL-6, IL-8, tumor necrosis factor [TNF]-\u03b1 and platelet-activating factor), which stimulate production of prostaglandins and leukotrienes. In addition, LPS activation results in enhanced macrophage phagocytic and cytotoxic activity. Activation of alternative complement pathway factors C3a and C5a induce histamine release, and affect neutrophil chemotaxis and accumulation. Kinin activation releases bradykinins and other vasoactive peptides, which cause hypotension. The release of these mediators and subsequent systemic response make LPS a powerful research tool in evaluating inflammatory pathways.",

[24] [25] [26] [27] [28] Holz et al 24 conducted a double-blind, double-dummy, placebo-controlled, three-period crossover study. Eighteen healthy subjects, who had been shown at screening to produce more than a 10% increase in sputum neutrophils in response to exposure to 250 ppb O 3, were randomly assigned to receive alternating single orally inhaled doses of fluticasone 2 mg, 50 mg of prednisolone orally, and placebo at least 2 weeks apart. Compared with placebo, pretreatment with inhaled or oral corticosteroids resulted in a significant reduction of sputum neutrophils, by 62% and 64%, respectively. This was associated with statistically significant reductions in sputum MPO, by 55% for inhaled corticosteroids and 42% for oral steroids. Compared with placebo, there was a mean reduction in sputum IL-8 levels, by 49% after inhaled corticosteroids and 34% after oral corticosteroids.",

Subjects in the COPD group demonstrated significant decreased peak expiratory flow from baseline, while those in the control group did not. The blood and sputum showed a significant increase in peripheral neutrophils in the COPD subjects but not the controls. However, CRP was significantly increased in both groups on day 5. Subjects in the COPD group had significantly increased sputum neutrophil elastase levels over baseline on days 9 and 15, as well as IL-8 levels on day 9. Sputum neutrophil elastase levels were significantly higher in subjects with COPD, compared with control subjects on days 9-15. To date, only one laboratory has published on this model and as such, the data should be interpreted with caution.",

Although challenge models are good predictive models of acute exacerbations of COPD, there are ethical considerations associated with inducing exacerbations in subjects with COPD. Therefore, safety boards may be advised to only consider subjects with mild COPD for inclusion in these studies. Healthy subjects could be used as an alternative, when determining the effects of a developmental drug's mechanism of action on lung inflammation. The LPS and O 3 models have been used successfully in healthy subjects. [13] [14] [15] 22, 24, [26] [27] [28] As these models represent the local inflammation in the lung during an exacerbation, and test the mechanism of action of potential novel drugs, these data may be used for future decision making. The LPS challenge model is the best validated model in subjects with COPD. Pharmaceutical companies have used LPS models as a means to establish proof of principle early during the clinical development process, because they are relatively simple to perform and have few adverse events. This model is cost effective because it can be conducted in healthy subjects, who are easy to recruit. LPS challenge data, whether positive or negative, can provide valuable information to aid investment decision making. One disadvantage of the LPS model is that it is a model of lung inflammation, but not of the disease state, thus preclinical validation of the developmental drug's effects on LPS pathways is essential. For anti-inflammatory targets that are involved in the tolllike receptor 4, NF-\u03ba\u03b2 pathway, the LPS challenge model is the model of choice.",
