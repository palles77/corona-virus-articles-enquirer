As of June 19, 2015, a total of 1,338 confirmed cases of MERS and at least 475 MERS-associated deaths had been reported (2) . Human zoonotic infections have largely been acquired in the Middle East. Imported cases in Europe, North America, Africa, and Asia have been linked to travel to the Middle East, occasionally with local secondary transmission (2) .",

In an outbreak in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, in 2014 involving multiple health care facilities, 255 laboratory-confirmed MERS cases were documented during a 2-month period, but intensified infection prevention measures in hospitals terminated that outbreak (6, 7) . Available genetic data for these patients showed that they were clustered, which suggested widespread transmission of related viruses (6) . Of 191 symptomatic patients, 40 were health care workers (HCWs). For the remaining patients for whom data were available, most had some form of contact with a health care facility or patients with suspected MERS. Investigation of outbreaks in health care settings also identified asymptomatic and milder cases, especially in healthy young adults and HCWs with no underlying illnesses (7) . Dromedary camels have been proposed as a source of human infection; however, the possibility of other reservoirs and intermediate hosts has not been excluded (2, 8) .",

Data suggest a single zoonotic event that occurred around December 31, 2013 (95% HPD interval November 8, 2013-February 10, 2014), followed by transmission in health care facilities for \u22485 months. However, an alternative possibility of multiple, independent spillover events from closely related viruses in a zoonotic reservoir cannot be excluded. This chain of transmission was spread as far as Indiana in the United States by an HCW from Riyadh (11) and 2 travelers returning to the Netherlands (12) . Viral sequence data for viruses from the 2 travelers was fragmentary and excluded from phylogenetic analysis. However, this cluster of human MERS-CoV in Riyadh was distinct from the large contemporaneous cluster of human-to-human transmission that occurred in Jeddah and represents a separate zoonotic transmission event (6) . Only 1 of the analyzed sequences from the Riyadh cluster has an amino acid change in the receptor binding domain of the spike protein (13) , the C23,697T nonsynonymous mutation in KFMC-8, which leads to an R\u00aeC amino acid change.",

We showed that what was seemingly a contiguous outbreak within KFMC was caused by multiple introductions of virus from outside the hospital. The small number of mutations observed across the 29,897-nt genome analyzed during this outbreak emphasizes the need for complete genome analysis if molecular epidemiology is to be meaningful in such settings. The ongoing outbreak of MERS in South Korea (2), the largest cluster of transmission from a returning traveler to date, highlights the ongoing threat from MERS and the need for understanding pathways of transmission.

This outbreak involved 45 patients: 8 infected outside KFMC, 13 long-term patients at KFMC, 23 health care workers, and 1 who had an indeterminate source of infection. Sequences of full-length MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV) from 10 patients and a partial sequence of MERS-CoV from another patient, when compared with other MERS-CoV sequences, demonstrated that this outbreak was part of a larger outbreak that affected multiple health care facilities in Riyadh and possibly arose from a single zoonotic transmission event that occurred in December 2013 (95% highest posterior density interval November 8, 2013-February 10, 2014). This finding suggested continued health care-associated transmission for 5 months. Molecular epidemiology documented multiple external introductions in a seemingly contiguous outbreak and helped support or refute transmission pathways suspected through epidemiologic investigation.",
