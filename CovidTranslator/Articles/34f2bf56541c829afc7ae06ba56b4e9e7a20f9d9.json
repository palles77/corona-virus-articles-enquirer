Subsequently, a variety of derivatives of this chemotype were synthesized to develop structure-activity relationships, and all are inhibitors of the BoNT/A LC. Three-dimensional analyses indicated that half of the originally discovered 1,7-DAAC structure superimposed well with 4-amino-7-chloroquinolinebased antimalarial agents. This observation led to the discovery that several of the 1,7-DAAC derivatives are potent in vitro inhibitors of Plasmodium falciparum and, in general, are more efficacious against CQ-resistant strains than against CQ-susceptible strains. In addition, by inhibiting \u03b2-hematin formation, the most efficacious 1,7-DAAC-based antimalarials employ a mechanism of action analogous to that of 4,7-ACQ-based antimalarials and are well tolerated by normal cells. One candidate was also effective when administered orally in a rodent-based malaria model. Finally, the 1,7-DAAC-based derivatives were examined for Ebola filovirus inhibition in an assay employing Vero76 cells, and three provided promising antiviral activities and acceptably low toxicities.",

The HC mediates translocation into the neuronal cytosol. After cell internalization, the LC is liberated from the HC, and depending on the serotype, cleaves one of three proteins significant interest include hematin binding 4,7-ACQ-hybrid drug reversals, 19 acridones, 20 4 ,7-ACQ-astemizole- 21 and 4,7-ACQ-chlotrimazol-derived hybrids, 22 and new 4,7-ACQ and acridine derivatives. 23 The Ebola filovirus (EBOV) is a member of the Family Filoviridae (Order Mononegavirales). 24 Genetically, EBOV is a nonsegmented, single-stranded negative sense RNA virus that is endemic to sub-Saharan Africa, and sporadic outbreaks of naturally occurring EBOV Zaire (Zaire virus) have been reported to cause severe hemorrhagic fever with a lethality rate approaching 90%. 25 Major concerns regarding this virus include its potential global spread (due to increasing international travel) and its possible use as a biological weapon. 4 Therefore, like BoNTs, this pathogen is listed as a CDC Category A biothreat agent, 4 as there are no approved therapeutic options available for the prophylaxis and/or treatment of infected individuals. Currently, the only medical response to an \"outbreak\" relies on systematic case identification and contact tracing strategies, and the immediate isolation of suspect cases in specialized isolation wards. 24, 26 Therefore, a vaccine(s), as well as new antifilovirus drugs, are needed to counter this pathogen; however, a review of the literature afforded only a handful of small molecules that act as EBOV inhibitors. 27 Herein, we provide results indicating that derivatives of a single chemotype (i.e., 1,7-DAAC-based small molecules) possess the ability to inhibit the three unrelated pathogens (described above): a bacterial toxin (the BoNT/A LC), a protozoan (malaria), and a filovirus (EBOV).",

            "text": "With respect to the importance of discovering small molecules that employ different mechanisms of action to treat more than one target/pathogen, this paradigm is a cost-effective means for treating diseases in general and especially those affecting (or that would affect) small populations as well as populations in third world countries (e.g., malaria). 28 One example of such a small molecule is miltefosine, which was originally developed to treat breast cancer but was later found to be an effective treatment for visceral leishmaniasis (a sand-fly transmitted parasite disease estimated to kill 500000 people a year). 29 A second example is Adefovir dipivoxil. This drug is used to treat chronic hepatitis B virus infection but was subsequently identified as a competitive inhibitor of anthrax edema factor (a key virulence factor in anthrax pathogenesis). 30 ' RESULTS AND DISCUSSION To initially discover novel small molecule (nonpeptidic) inhibitors (SMNPIs) of the BoNT/A LC, high-throughput screens of small molecule libraries were conducted and \"hits\" from the screens were verified using a previously reported HPLC-based assay. 31 The chemical diversity of the initially discovered SMNPIs ranged from the rigid natural product Michellamine B to flexible bis-(4,7-ACQ) antimalarial agents. 31 Following the three-dimensional (3-D) superimpositions of shared SMNPI chemical and steric features led to the generation of a common pharmacophore for BoNT/A LC inhibition. 31 In subsequent studies, the pharmacophore provided the basis for developing 3-D search queries that were used to database mine more potent SMNPIs. 32 Interestingly, two new SMNPI chemotypes that were discovered included 4,7-ACQ-cholic acid hybrids 33 and 4,7-ACQ-adamantane hybrids. 34 Additionally, a 1,7-DAAC-based SMNPI, 1 (Scheme 1), was also database Journal of Medicinal Chemistry ARTICLE mined from the NCI Open Repository. 35 Following 1 was used to unite different SMNPI chemotypes in a refined 3-Zone pharmacophore. 35 Of significance to the research reported herein, 3-D superimpositions of the SMNPIs used to develop the refined 3-zone pharmacophore model indicated that 1 and previously identified SMNPI 2 35 (which is also an antimalarial agent 31 ) partially superimposed with remarkably good chemical and steric complementarity ( Figure 1A ). Not surprisingly, when 1 was superimposed with antimalarial drug CQ, which was also previously found to weakly inhibit the BoNT/A LC, 31,35 the same complementary chemical and steric convergence was observed. This structural convergence is even more pronounced when 1 and two condensed CQ molecules are superimposed ( Figure 1B ). This observation led to the hypothesis that 1 and its derivatives might possess antimalarial activity, and initial in vitro screening against P. falciparum revealed that these compounds are active against the parasite. Additional toxicity and pharmacokinetics profiling, followed by the in vivo testing of one of the most potent of the derivatives, also demonstrated significant potential for developing 1,7-DAAC-based SMNPIs as antimalarial therapeutics (vide infra).",

Specifically, 1,7-DAAC derivatives exploring the bis-(alkylamino) side-chains of 1 were generated (Scheme 1). In Scheme 1, a brief synopsis of the synthetic method used to obtain the derivatives is displayed (see the Experimental Section for details). First, commercially available 1,5-diaminonaphthalene was used to prepare intermediate 4 via the Conrad-Limpah reaction. Following, 4 was reacted with POCl 3 to give dichloride 5 in 82% yield. Nucleophilic substitution with a variety of diamines, followed by HCl salt formation, provided 1 and derivatives 6-17 (overall yields ranged from 45% to 72%).",

However, 12, which incorporates the side chain nitrogens in pyrrolidine rings is equipotent to 6, and more potent than 7 and 14, as well as all other derivatives presented in Table 1 . These results are indicative of potential steric limitations for side chain amino substitutions within the confines of their binding sites. Finally, it is notable that the inhibition data indicates that incorporating terminal morpholine rings (16 and 17 in Table 1 ) has a more pronounced negative impact on inhibitory efficacy versus all other presented derivatives. This data appears to indicate that either an unfavorable hydrophobic-polar or polar-polar contact between one (or both) of the morpholine ring oxygens and an enzyme residue(s) is occurring in the BoNT/A LC binding site. In agreement with this hypothesis, inhibition data shows that 14, which possesses hydrophobic carbon atoms in the same positions as the oxygen atoms of the morpholine rings of 16, is a more potent SMNPI.",

            "text": "In general, our hypothesis was correct, as the majority of the 1,7-DAAC SMNPIs are very potent antimalarial agents, inhibiting the proliferation of all CQR, MDR, and CQS P. falciparum strains with low nanomolar range efficacies. SMNPIs 7 and 8, which possess side chains containing a primary amino group, are the least active of the derivatives (Table 1) . By contrast, the inhibitory efficacies of the 1,7-DAAC derivatives gradually improve with increasing substitution on the basic side chain nitrogens (compare 7 and 8 versus 1, and 9-11 (Table 1) ). Moreover, the introduction of piperidine moieties (14, 15) further increases antimalarial activity, while the introduction of a heteroatom in the piperidine rings (to provide the morpholine substituents of 16 and 17) further enhanced activity against all examined P. falciparum strains (Table 1 ). Overall, out of 12 examined 1,7-DAAC derivatives, nine possess pronounced antimalarial activities (1, and 10-11), with the most potent antimalarial agents possessing diethyl (11), piperidine (14, 15), and morpholine substituents (16, 17) ( Table 1) . It is important to note that these low IC 50 values are unusual for nonperoxide derived antimalarials: (1) nine derivatives with activities below 10 nM against CQR W2 strain and (2) 1 and 10-17 are generally more potent against P. falciparum CQR W2 strain than against CQS D6 strain (RI = 0.29-0.75; RI ART = 0.74) ( Table 1) . It should also be emphasized that 11, 16, and 17 are more potent than standard antimalarial drugs CQ, MFQ, and ART (Table 1 ). In particular, the ratios of increased inhibitory potencies indicate that these SMNPIs are: 1.5-2 times more potent against D6 than CQ, MFQ, and ART, respectively, 1.5-300 times more potent against W2 than MFQ, ART, and CQ, respectively, and 4-42 times more potent against C235 than ART, MFQ, and CQ, respectively (Table 1) .",

In line with our hypothesis that 1,7-DAAC-based SMNPIs, like 4,7-ACQ-based antimalarials, would interfere with the heme detoxification mechanism, the results in Table 2 indicate that 13, 16, and 17 display dosedependent inhibition of \u03b2-hematin formation, with IC 50 values that are considerably lower than that of CQ, thus demonstrating a significantly better ability to interact with hematin than CQ (as well as confirming our hypothesis).

In brief, SMNPI cytotoxicities were examined in a rat macrophage cell line, and low toxicities were observed for all three derivatives (IC 50 value range = \u223c7000-10000 nM, Table 3 ). Moreover, the potencies of these SMNPIs were further supported by corresponding IC 90 values (Table 3) , which are substantially higher than those of standard antimalarial drugs CQ, MFQ, and ART. 41,42 Another important characteristic of 11, 16, and 17 is their lack of toxicity with respect to their high antimalarial activities against all three P. falciparum strains.

Thus, it is hypothesized that the antiviral activity of 9, and other1,7-DAAC-based SMNPIs, results from the modulation of common cellular pathways involved in viral assembly and budding (which are utilized by a wide array of evolutionarily distant virus families). 51 Recent findings 27a prompted the examination of 1 and 6-17 for potential anti-EBOV activity. The results from testing the 1,7-DAAC SMNPIs in a cell-based infection assay, using Vero76 (African green monkey kidney cells), indicated that the majority of the derivatives are toxic when administered at 20 \u03bcM concentration. However, 11, 14, 16, and 17 were exceptions. These SMNPIs provided 97%, 100%, 96%, and 53% EBOV inhibition, respectively (Table 4) .

Specifically: (1) BoNT/A LC metalloprotease inhibition is achieved via interaction with the enzyme's substrate binding cleft, (2) antimalarial efficacy appears to result from the suppression of \u03b2-hematin formation (see Tables 2), and 3) anti-EBOV efficacy most likely results from the modulation of a host cellular pathway (for example, a pathway facilitating viral assembly and budding). 27a,51 Interestingly, SAR for the inhibition of the three targets does not indicate a general correlation between 1,7-DAAC derivative side chain substitutions and related inhibitory potencies across pathogens. For example, primary amino substituents on the sidechains of the 1,7-DAAC core result in increased BoNT/A LC inhibitory potency while incorporating the side chain basic 2.0 mm \u00c2 50 mm C18 column using a formic acid/acetonitrile mobile phase.

The generation and characterization of this virus has been described elsewhere. 47 The EBOV-eGFP virus was propagated in Vero76 cells and viral titer was determined using a standard plaque assay. 48 The details of the Ebola-eGFP infection assay are described elsewhere. 49 Briefly, Vero76 cells (4 \u00c2 10 4 cells/well) were seeded in 96-well BD high content imaging plates (BD Biosciences) and allowed to incubate overnight. For primary screening of the SMNPIs, the cells were pretreated with a single concentration (10 or 20 \u03bcM) for 2 h and then infected in the presence of SMNPI with EBOV-eGFP at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 5. After incubation for 48 h at 37\u00b0C under 5% CO 2 , the cells were fixed in 10% formalin for 3 days and then washed three times with phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Cells infected with Ebola-eGFP were stained with HCS Cellmask Deep Red cytoplasmic/ nuclear stain (Invitrogen, 5 \u03bcg/mL diluted in PBS) and nuclear Hoechst dye 33342 (Invitrogen, 1 \u03bcg/mL diluted in PBS).",
