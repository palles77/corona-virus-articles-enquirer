In order to effectively manage all these multi-morbid patients engaged in complex care pathways that may include numerous consultations with different practitioners, information management and care coordination are critical. Thus, the special topic in 2105 chosen for the IMIA yearbook is \" Patient-centered care coordination \".",

            "text": "Coordination is the process in which different people or entities collaborate to reach specific goals or aims. For care coordination, numerous synonyms have been used, e.g., collaborative care, integrated care, shared care or cooperation, with a common underlying understanding that the term describes the continuity and totality of care for a given patient provided by different providers in concert. In 2007, MacDonald et al. identified more than 40 definitions of care coordination [1] . Since most of them were less than satisfactory, the authors created a new one: \"Care coordination is the deliberate organization of patient care activities between two or more participants (including the patient) involved in a patient's care to facilitate the appropriate delivery of health care services\". Care coordination is thus the patient-centered organization of care that providers including patient caregivers should share in order to improve the quality of a patient's management and ultimately the patient's health. Because of the fragmentation of services, effective communication among providers is crucial. A key success factor to care coordination is sharing of the same holistic view of a patient's condition by all actors, including the patient's active diseases and current treatments, and the planned care pathway that establishes the role of each provider and his/her interventions. Unfortunately, transitions from one setting or provider to another still frequently lack clear communication and coordination resulting in increase of health care costs and reduced quality of care including polypharmacy and adverse drug interactions, duplication of services, unnecessary Emergency Department utilization, high hospital readmissions rates, and in the worst case patient injury. Many patients or their caregivers already serve as care coordinators, filling information gaps between providers, addressing conflicting instructions, and managing redundant orders and medications during care transitions.",

The second and last track of 2015 articles including survey papers, best papers selection, and IMIA regional contributions will be available by the opening of Medinfo in Sao Paulo, Brazil, in August 2015.

For instance, while Natural Language Processing (NLP) is not a new domain and was historically included in the Knowledge Representation and Management (KRM) section, the number of NLP papers published increased steadily since 2000. The NLP field matured with many available tools to researchers in NLP and other fields. This is perhaps best evidenced by the number of papers in medical journals (e.g. in 2014 alone, Acad Radiol, Am J Epidemiol, Am J Prev Med, Arthritis Care Res (Hoboken), Cancer Inform, Clin Gastroenterol Hepatol, J Card Fail, JAMA Neurol, Pharmacoepidemiol Drug Saf, Psychiatr Serv, World J Urol) reporting clinical applications of NLP by non-NLP specialists in addition to medical informatics and NLP venues. Further, the best paper selection in the KMR section has consistently included papers, which either developed NLP methods or applied them to obtain clinical information or manage medical knowledge. Specifically, NLP-related papers had the following representation in the KRM best paper selection over the past five years: 2.5/4 in 2010, 5/5 in 2011, 3.5/5 in 2012, 1/4 in 2013, 3/4 in 2014.",

            "text": "Public health informatics was defined in 2000 by Yasnoff et al. as \"the systematic application of information and computer science and technology to public health practice, research, and learning\" [2] . Public health is an interdisciplinary profession that applies mathematics, engineering, information science, and related social sciences (e.g., decision analysis) to public health problems and processes. Because of real world pandemics of emerging infectious diseases such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) 2002, Ebola 2014, and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) 2015, as well as bioterrorism threats, efficiently organizing biosurveillance at an international level is of crucial importance to most countries. Research in this area is very active and focuses on issues related to data collection and coding, electronic interchange and interoperability, as well as data transmission, integration, and analysis, while taking into account the issue of increasing data volume, diversity, and origin, and the importance of patient privacy, data confidentiality, and system security. In addition, electronic event-based biosurveillance systems have recently emerged using near real-time information from the Internet for epidemiologic intelligence. Approximately 65% of the world's first news about infectious disease events comes from these informal sources [3] . Neologisms like \"infodemiology\" and \"infoveillance\" describe the analytics of queries in Internet search engines to predict disease outbreaks. Geographical Information Systems (GIS) expose the geographical dimension of public health trends. All are demonstrating the emergence and robustness of a new field.",
