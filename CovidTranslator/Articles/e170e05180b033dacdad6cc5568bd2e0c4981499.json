Most vaccination strategies for viral infections aim to generate high titres of high-affinity neutralizing antibodies that bind to virions and prevent productive virus infections 1 . Variations in the virus-encoded epitopes that are the targets of these neutralizing antibodies complicate vaccination strategies. For example, there are three poliovirus serotypes, each of which has distinct neutralizing epitopes, so that poliovirus vaccines, which have high efficacy, include three strains of inactivated or attenuated polioviruses 2 . Influenza A viruses continually evolve strain variations due to mutations in the neutralizing epitopes encoded by their surface glycoproteins. These variations can either be due to point mutations (antigenic drift) that are driven in part by immune selection, or be attributable to the complete substitution of glycoprotein genes owing to reassortment with other influenza viruses (antigenic shift) 3 .",

Influenza poses some interesting additional problems, as immunizations often boost the production of non-protective antibodies that crossreact with previously encountered strains, sometimes at the expense of inducing high quality, protective antibody responses. This phenomenon has been referred to as 'original antigenic sin', whereby a history of a response to crossreactive antigens can bias the response toward those antigens and inhibit the response to a new infection or vaccine 4 . Dengue viruses also pose problems for vaccine design, with no effective vaccine and millions of human infections every year. There are four dengue virus serotypes, as defined by neutralization, but these serotypes are otherwise antigenically similar. Non-neutralizing antibodies that are specific for one dengue serotype can bind to a second dengue serotype and facilitate the infection of cells that express antibody (Fc) receptors, in a process known as 'immune enhancement' . 5 Immune enhancement has been linked to severe cases of dengue haemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome, so immunization against one dengue virus serotype has the potential to prime an individual for a more severe infection with a second serotype.",

Although studies using the passive transfer of serum have clearly shown that antibodies alone can provide protective immunity to some viruses, it is generally thought that vaccines that induce T-cell responses in addition to B-cell responses should produce better and longer lasting protective immunity. Inactivated and recombinant vaccines induce responses by helper CD4 + T cells, whose T-cell receptors (TCR) recognize viral peptides that are captured by antigenpresenting cells, processed and presented by their class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules. Attenuated vaccines are better than inactivated or recombinant vaccines at stimulating good CD8 + T-cell responses, because cells infected with live replicating virus load viral peptide epitopes onto their class I MHC molecules and these epitope-charged MHC molecules are the targets of CD8 + T cells. Many papers have indicated that CD8 + T cells are effective at clearing acute viral infections and at controlling low-level persistent infections, such as those caused by cytomegalovirus (CMV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), and herpes simplex viruses (HSV) 7 . CD8 + T cells are thought to be especially important for the control of HIV-1 and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections and are being targeted in experimental vaccination studies for both [8] [9] [10] .",

            "text": "Three general conclusions can be reached regarding T-cell responses to viral infections. First, although many viral peptides can be processed and presented by MHC molecules, the T-cell response is mostly directed against a relatively small number of discrete 'immunodominant' epitopes. What causes immunodominance is not completely understood, but it requires the ability of the cell to enzymatically digest a protein into a particular peptide, and requires that peptide to have the appropriate amino-acid sequence to bind with good affinity to the antigen-presenting groove of the MHC molecule 11 . The amount of protein synthesized, and when it is synthesized, during the infection cycle are also important factors. Many dominant epitopes are derived from proteins that are expressed early during infection, before the cellular antigen-presenting system is shut down, an event which occurs in many, but not all, viral infections. Of great importance is the availability of a repertoire of T cells that Abstract | Substantial research has been directed towards the development of a new generation of vaccines that are based on the inclusion of immunogenic epitopes in recombinant vectors. Here we examine the evidence that under certain conditions immunogenic epitopes can do more harm than good and might therefore be considered pathogenic. We suggest that the specific removal of such pathogenic epitopes from vaccines might increase their prophylactic potential, while minimizing the risk of side-effects from vaccine use.",

Some studies have indicated that one in 50-100,000 naive T cells recognizes a specific epitope, though this average number is likely to vary with the epitope 15, 16 . Immunodominance patterns of antigenic epitopes alter if a host has been previously infected with a pathogen that has T-cell crossreactive epitopes 17, 18 . T-cell recognition of peptide-MHC complexes can be quite degenerate, with estimates that a single TCR can recognize up to 10 5 to 10 6 peptide-MHC combinations 19, 20 . This might be partly due to the ability of a TCR to adjust its conformation to bind to the part of the peptide presented by the MHC 21 . If the T-cell memory pool contains T cells that crossreact with an epitope of a newly encountered virus, those T cells could proliferate and dominate the subsequent response. In humans it can be difficult to determine whether an epitope is intrinsically immunodominant, or whether its immunodominance is attributed to crossreactivity with a previously encountered pathogen.",

It was noted, for example, that HIV-1-infected individuals with CD8 + T-cell responses directed mainly against a single epitope developed full-blown AIDS more rapidly than individuals with CD8 + T-cell responses directed against several epitopes 24 . One advantage of a broad-based immune response is that the virus is less likely to accumulate mutations that enable escape from the immune response. Studies of HCV in chimpanzees and lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) in mice have correlated narrow T-cell repertoires with the generation of escape mutants 23, 25 . A second advantage of a broad-based T-cell response under conditions of high viral load is that it might be more difficult for the virus to exhaust the immune response to several epitopes than it is to exhaust the response to a single epitope [26] [27] [28] . Repeated stimulation of T cells can 'stun' them and render them dysfunctional (anergic), or drive them into apoptosis through the process known as activation-induced cell death 27, 29 . This impairment or elimination of specific T cells is known as clonal exhaustion. Studies of persistent LCMV infections in mice revealed different degrees of T-cell exhaustion that varied with the epitope [26] [27] [28] .",

The same approach offers promise in tumour immunotherapy, through the design of vaccines that incorporate immunogenic epitopes presented by human tumour cells 31 . In this Opinion, however, we question whether designing vaccines against a small number of epitopes is a good strategy for virus infections, in which there are many potential epitopes that are presented by various MHC molecules, with the attendant possibility of viral escape variants and different crossreactivities. In particular, we question this because viral epitopes can sometimes be pathogenic and induce T-cell responses that cause immunopathology rather than protective immunity.

These two epitopes share six out of eight amino acids and are highly crossreactive at the effector level 18 . TCR V\u03b2 clonal analyses showed that mice infected with either LCMV or PV generated broad-based T-cell responses, in which for every 14 clones sequenced there were at least 10 distinct clonotypes. Homologous challenge of LCMV-immune mice with LCMV slightly skewed the response toward a predictable V\u03b2 clonotype with a typical amino-acid pattern (or 'motif '), in the antigen-binding complementarity-determining region 3 (CDR3) of the TCR. However, following heterologous viral challenge, a dramatic narrowing of the T-cell repertoire was observed. This is probably because only a subset of the memory CD8 + T cells reacted to the crossreactive peptide with sufficient affinity to induce proliferation. Thus, not only was the T-cell response skewed toward a normally subdominant epitope (FIG. 1) , but the normally diverse TCR usage was reduced to a narrow oligoclonal response. Predictably, PV-immune mice that were infected with a dose of LCMV sufficient to cause a persistent infection generated an NP 205-212 epitope escape mutant of LCMV in the presence of such a narrow T-cell response 44 .",

Through original antigenic sin, antibodies and T cells can crossreact to different influenza strains and dominate immune responses 4 , and when viral strains have mutations in T-cell epitopes, more narrow T-cell repertoires are generated 52 . It is noteworthy that all influenza A viruses that have infected humans in the past 80 years have expressed a conserved HLA-A2.1-restricted M1 58-66 immunodominant epitope 53 . As individuals are infected by a series of influenza A strains during their lifetimes, a TCR repertoire that is specific for this epitope evolves from the diverse use of several V\u03b2 families to a virtually exclusive V\u03b2 17 response using a discrete amino-acid motif in the CDR3 region of the TCR 54 .

Mice infected with a recombinant VV encoding the CNS protein PLP cleared the virus after two weeks. If these VV-immune mice were then challenged with M. tuberculosis in adjuvant or were infected with murine CMV, they developed CNS white matter lesions 73, 74 . One explanation for this observation is that the first virus infection primes autoreactive T cells that are stimulated by the second pathogen, possibly owing to crossreactivity. However, because the autoantigen is present, the second pathogen might be stimulating the disease through a bystander activation event. In these examples the first pathogen does not expand the autoreactive T cells to sufficient numbers to initiate CNS lesions, but the second challenge expands crossreactive T cells, thereby causing the CNS lesions (FIG. 3) . It is known that a threshold number of autoreactive T cells must be generated during a sensitization regimen, or provided by adoptive transfers of T cells, for an autoimmune disease to occur. Heterologous immunity between viruses provides a potential mechanism for amplifying an autoimmune response that is initiated by the first virus. One natural situation in which this is posited to occur is human MS, in which several viruses encode polyarginine sequences that can be recognized by CD4 + T cells that are isolated from the CNS 77 .",
