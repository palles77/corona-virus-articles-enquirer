In NMR studies, UL49.5 was represented by two fragments: the extracellular region (residues 1-35) and the transmembraneintracellular fragment (residues 36-75), displaying various functions during viral invasion. After the empirical structure determination, a molecular docking procedure was used to predict the complex of UL49.5 with the TAP heterodimer.",

This process is mainly controlled by the UL49.5 gene product of BHV-1. UL49.5 is a small transmembrane protein composed of 75 amino acid residues [4] . During viral infection, this protein directly targets the transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP). In addition to BHV-1, several other related members of the Varicellovirus genus encode UL49.5 proteins with similar immune evasion activity [5] . TAP is a heterodimer consisting of two subunits: TAP1 and TAP2. In the host's immune system, the TAP heterodimer mediates the ATPdependent transport of antigen-derived peptides from the cytoplasm to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Peptide transport by TAP is a bottleneck stage in the antigen presentation, thus it constitutes a perfect target for the UL49.5 protein [5] . Therefore, to design new vaccines or drugs against BHV-1, or use the virus as a vector in human therapy, it is very important to understand how the UL49.5 protein affects the TAP activity and triggers its degradation [6] .",

            "text": "Each TAP subunit contains a transmembrane domain and a nucleotide binding domains (NBD) [7] . The NBDs are located on the cytosolic side of the ER membrane. The transmembrane domains of TAP1 and TAP2 are constructed of 10 and 9 helices, respectively, passing through the membrane [8] . Each transmembrane domain is composed of an N-terminal domain and a core domain. The N-terminal parts are responsible for binding tapasin and assembling the peptide loading complex. The core parts of TAP are responsible for peptide (substrate) binding and transport, in addition to the formation of the heterodimer structure [7] . The current mechanistic model for TAP describes three main conformations of the transporter: (1) an inward-open conformation, with the peptide binding site exposed to the cytoplasm and separated NBDs, (2) an intermediate pre-translocation conformation with the peptide binding-induced partial NBD closure [9] , and (3) an outward-open conformation with a low-affinity peptide binding site exposed to the ER lumen and closely interacting NBDs [10, 11] . UL49.5 interacts with the core transmembrane domain of TAP complex and blocks structural rearrangements required for the translocation of peptides into the ER lumen [11] . The conformational arrest of TAP causes sensitization of TAP proteins for proteasomal degradation. It has been demonstrated that the presence of both TAP1 and TAP2 is necessary for UL49.5 binding. UL49.5 has three biologically relevant domains: the ER lumen domain, the transmembrane region, and the C-terminal domain located on the cytosolic side [4] .The membrane-anchored N-terminal UL49.5 domain seems to be crucial for the interaction and TAP inhibition. To understand the role of UL49.5 and both of the TAP subunits in the UL49.5-TAP complex, it is necessary to learn the 3D structure of UL49.5 [5] . Recently, the 3D structure of TAP bound to herpes simplex virus 1-encoded ICP47 protein was obtained using electron cryomicroscopy [12] . To the best of our knowledge, there is no information regarding the molecular structure of TAP in a complex with other viral transmembrane proteins, such as the US6 protein of human cytomegalovirus, the BNLF2a protein of the Epstein-Barr virus, the CPXV012 protein of the cowpox virus (reviewed in [13] ), or any of the varicella virus-encoded UL49.5 [13] .",

In such difficult cases, the experimental results are very often supported by molecular modeling methods that are powerful tools for structural determination, the evaluation of protein-protein and protein-ligand interactions, and protein dynamics in a wide range of time scales. Therefore, in this study aimed at the understanding of the function of UL49.5, we determined the structure of the viral protein by using circular dichroism (CD), multidimensional NMR spectroscopy, and molecular dynamics (MD). For CD and NMR studies, the UL49.5 protein was divided into two peptides: (i) the ER lumen fragment (residues 1-35) and (ii) the transmembrane-intracellular fragment (residues 36-75), displaying various functions related to virus immune evasion. The CD spectra of these peptides were obtained in dodecylphosphocholine (DPC) micelles and in 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylcholine (POPC) vesicles, which were chosen as the mimetic models of the eukaryotic cell membrane [16] [17] [18] [19] . The NMR spectra of these peptides were measured in micellar concentrations of DPC. Then, for both peptides, we used the NMR data as a set of restraints for an MD that generated 3D structures of peptides in DPC micelles. We performed MD simulations in an explicit water/DPC micelle as the biological membrane environment. On the basis of the structure of peptide fragments 1-35 and 36-75, we built the full structure of the UL49.5 protein and performed MD studies in the POPC bilayer. Finally, the performed structure of the UL49.5 was used as a ligand in the molecular docking procedure with TAP.",

All NMR datasets were acquired at 303 K on a Bruker Avance III NMR System 700 NMR spectrometer (700 MHz 1 H. 16.4 T) or on an Agilent DDR2 800 MHz NMR spectrometer (800 MHz. 1 H. 18.8 T).

The DPC topology was adapted to AMBER [39, 40] . Then each peptide was placed in a simulation box with its center of mass coinciding with the DPC micelle. The 3D structures of the N.BHV and TMC.BHV peptides evaluated with CYANA were used as the starting structure in the MD calculations of the DPC micelle. The side chains of lysine and arginine were protonated, and chloride ions were used to neutralize the total charge of the entire system. The entire system was subjected to energy minimization (steepest descent method). To eliminate the initial adverse interactions between the peptide and the micelle core and to prevent the penetration of water molecules during equilibration, for the first 20,000 steps of minimization, the peptide and the water were kept under weak harmonic constraints with a force constant of 10 and 5 kcal/mol, respectively. Then, each system was subjected to NTP MD for 20 ns at 305 K at time steps of 2 fs. During the MD stimulation, a non-bonded cutoff of 9 \u00c5 was chosen. The MD studies for the DPC micelle/water/ peptide complex were performed with the AMBER software [39] by using a protocol including time-averaged NMR restraints (TAV) derived from NMR spectroscopy with the force constant for interproton connectivities equal to 50 kcal/(mol \u00d7 \u00c5 2 ). No torsion angle restraints were used in the calculations. The geometry of the peptide groups was kept all trans with the force constant of f = 50 kcal/mol \u00d7 rad 2 , according to the NMR data. The coordinates were collected every 2000 steps. The 20 structures obtained in the last step of the MD simulation were considered for further analysis. All the figures were evaluated by using the MOLMOL [41] or PyMOL [42] program.",

The periodic box contained 50 POPC lipid molecules, more than 2500 water molecules, and 4 Cl \u2212 counter ions. The system was initially minimized and subsequently submitted to 90 ns of MD simulations in the AMBER program, using the particle-mesh Ewald (PME) electrostatic summation [39, 48] . For the first 40 ns of the MD, the flat-bottom soft harmonic-wall restraints were imposed onto the \u03d5 and \u03c8 angles (with the force constant f = 40 kcal/ mol \u00d7 rad 2 ) of the amino acid residues. For the next 50 ns of the simulation, free MD without any restraints was performed. The final protein structure was minimized. The trajectories were analyzed using the Ptraj module from the AMBER package [39] . The distance between the transmembrane \u03b1-helix (V40-M46) and the \u03b1-helix (V49-F58) was measured for the mass centers of the V40 and F58 amino acid residues by using a Ptraj module.

Before this work, an attempt to receive UL49.5 aa17-96 fused to GST as a carrier protein was made to express it in the bacterial system. We hoped to obtain a soluble protein, similar to the viral membrane proteins for HIV gp41 (a fragment 677-716) and the Ebola virus (45-aa long MPER/TM fragment) viral fusion proteins [53, 54] . However, recombinant UL49.5 was fully insoluble, forming inclusion bodies, and we were unsuccessful in its refolding after the solubilization of the inclusion bodies by using the descending gradient of urea. This has discouraged us from performing purification under denaturing conditions. The tagging of the UL49.5 protein has thus far affected the UL49.5 activity (unpublished data); hence we did not proceed with these experiments, even if the tag could be removed by the protease cleavage. Therefore, we decided to synthesize the UL49.5 fragments chemically. UL49.5 was divided into three protein fragments on the basis of its predicted structure [55] . The N-terminal fragment (N.BHV) and the C-terminal fragment (C.BHV) of UL49.5 are located outside the membrane, while the middle transmembrane one (TM.BHV) buried inside the hydrophobic core of the cellular of virus envelope membranes (Table 1 ) [55] .",

In addition, cysteine and methionine could negatively influence the cleavage of the protecting groups during the chemical synthesis and the subsequent peptide purification. Thus, the thioether functional group of methionine is susceptible to oxidation, creating two diastereomeric sulfoxides with sulfone. Note that the methionine and cysteine residues have a very similar structure (the volume of the amino acid atoms) and the distribution of partial charges to Nle and Abu, respectively.",

The sequential assignments were achieved by using the 2D homonuclear NOESY spectra. In the case of N.BHV, two distinct sets of proton resonances in the membrane-proximal part of the peptide (residues L28, S29, and A34) were found (Fig. 2S) . The appearance of two conformers might be the result of the presence of the two proline residues at positions 31 and 32, and consequently, the cis/trans isomerization of the peptide bonds. For the peptide bonds in which the proline residues were involved, the following NOE signals were observed: \u03b1H D2 -\u03b4H P3 , \u03b1H V26 -\u03b4H P27 , \u03b1H E30 -\u03b4H P31 , and \u03b4H P31 -\u03b1H P32 . This observation together with the lack of signals characteristic for the cis peptide bond geometry indicated the all trans bond geometry for the major conformation of N.BHV. The chemical shifts of the corresponding protons in the two conformers of N.BHV were very similar, and the differences were no greater than 0.25 ppm. The NOESY (Fig. 3S ) spectrum of N.BHV showed 485 NOE connectives including 109 intraresidue, 181 sequential, and 195 medium-range signals. The medium and long-range NOE interactions occurred along the entire peptide's main chain, indicating a stable secondary structure. The observed NOE effects of \u03b1H-NH (i,i+2) , \u03b1H-NH (i,i+3) , \u03b1H-\u03b2H (i,i+3) , and \u03b1H-NH (i,i+4) showed the existence of the regular \u03b1-helical structure in the A7-G20 fragment of N.BHV ( Fig. 2A) .",

N.BHV moved out of the DPC micelle core completely after approximately 12 ns of MD simulations. Thereafter, it remained bound to the interface for a further subsequent steps of MD simulations. Its RDF analysis showed that under infectious ongoing processes, the N.BHV fragments D2-P3, L5-Nle8, A23-G25, and S29-L35 (with the exception of Q33), and the A19 residues were exposed to an aqueous environment. The fragments R9-G12, D15-F16, V26-P27 and R1, L4, S18, Q33 residues were located at the micellar surface and mostly interacted with the hydrophilic heads of the surfactants. The residues (moieties) W17, L28 and A13-Nle14, G20-Y22 of N.BHV were immersed in the hydrophobic micellar core of the DPC micelle (Fig. 6S ).",

In the hydrophobic part of the micelle, the transmembrane helices 1 and 2 were connected by \u03b2-turn located at positions 47 and 48 (Fig. 3B) .

The C-terminal fragment of the peptide was mainly unstructured, with tendency to a wide bent formation in the Nle61-P66 region.

Proline residues participated in the formation of both \u03b2-turns. Pro residues could be found very often in the turn structures [60] . Proline is a special residue because it is rigid and pre-bent, thus suites very well for the \u03b2-turn format. Furthermore, two or three Pro residues present in an nascent amino acid sequence could act as a specific switch or the hinge [61, 62] and thus, might regulate the structure and/or activity of the protein [63] [64] [65] . Verweij et al. [55] hypothesized that because the P27 residue was conserved among all the functional UL49.5 inhibitors, it could be responsible for the TAP inhibition. However, their data indicated that the P27 residue did not contribute essentially to the UL49.5-induced inhibition or degradation of TAP. In our structure of UL49.5, the P27 residue was responsible for the turn formation and was located on the surface of the POPC membrane. The other two proline residues, namely P31 and P32, also formed the turn conformation in the E30-Q33 region. They were also located on the surface of the POPC membrane (Fig. 6A) and could be responsible for the appropriate orientation of helix 2 in the membrane. Both the P31 and P32 residues could act as a switch, which allowed the reorientation of the N-terminal domain (ER lumen domain) of the protein. The molecular dynamics of the entire protein, run with the NMR restraints, showed that the Nterminal fragment of the protein adopted a stable helical structure. In turn, the removal of NMR restrains in MD calculations, caused that the helical structure of the N-terminal part was slightly deformed and unfolded. This fragment of the protein maintains a helical character but the helix is probably less stable.",

Side chains of residues M46, V47, A48 and V49 protrude outward the turn. The side chains of these residues possess a strong hydrophobic character and can interact with the hydrophobic part of the POPC membrane ( Fig. 6A and C) . The hydrophilic parts of these residues were directed inside of the bend (Fig. 9S) . Thus, no unfavorable effects between the hydrophilic oxygen atoms and the hydrophobic part of the POPC membrane have been observed. Therefore, the transmembrane domain of UL49.5 created the helix-turn-helix motif. A similar, bent structure in the same region was previously predicted using the I-TASSER program [55] . This characteristic bend, or \u03b1-helix break, might be necessary for the appropriate orientation of the protein in the biological membrane or during its interactions with the viral transmembrane glycoprotein M (gM, the UL49.5 partner in the late phase of infection), with another UL49.5 molecule in a homodimer, or with the mammalian TAP complex. The TM helices of other transmembrane proteins can also form helix kinks or bends in their \u03b1-helical structures. In most examples, the Pro residues are found in these structures [55] .",

This conformation probably allowed for the appropriate orientation of this region in the POPC membrane. This characteristic bend was stabilized by a salt bridge between the R72 and the E70 residues. By analyzing the arrangement of UL49.5 in the POPC membrane, we found that the fragment R1-C21 was primarily immersed in water environment (Fig. 6C) , whereas the fragment Y22-F58 was mainly buried in the hydrophobic part of the POPC membrane. However, some amino acid residues (P31, P32, A34, L35, V40, T43) preferred to locate in the hydrophilic part of the POPC membrane. The F16 and W17 aromatic amino acid side chains were located on the same \u03b1-helix surface and could together potentially interact with gM as was previously suggested by Wei et al. [66] . The UL49.5/gM complex was implicated in such processes as the maturation of virions and the control of membrane fusion.",

The last three amino acid residues G73-R74-G75 (Fig. 6C ) were strongly exposed to the auqeous environment. The C-terminal part of UL49.5 was previously implicated in triggering TAP degradation by the proteasome. Viruses frequently utilize the ubiquitin pathway for immune evasion [67] , where ubiquitin can be attached not only to the lysine residues but also to the cysteine, serine, and threonine [68] . Therefore, Verweij et al. [55] investigated the role of the potential ubiquitination sites of bovine UL49.5 in TAP degradation by using three different mutants of the viral protein. They found that all the mutants had the same effect on TAP stability as the native protein [11] . This implied that the K68, K69, and S71 residues were buried in the biological membrane, making them unaccessible to a (still unknown) E3 ligase that catalyzes UL49.5 Lys or Ser ubiquitination. Our structural analysis is in line with these results indicating low accessibility of potential C-terminal ubiquitination sites. Residues E70-S71 were immersed in the hydrophilic part of the POPC membrane and were not easily accessible to the water molecules and to other cytosolic proteins. Furthermore, the UL49.5 residues R72-G73-R74-G75 were suggested by Verweij et al. [55] as a motif responsible for the proteasomal degradation of TAP. The sequence of the RGRG region was strongly sensitive to mutations, especially substitutions of a charged amino acid residue (Arg), which prevented TAP degradation. In particular, Arg at position 72 had a strong effect of this process. Our structural analysis showed that R72 interacted with the hydrophilic part of the POPC membrane, whereas Arg74 was fully accessible to the water molecules. The RGRG motif of UL49.5, extending from the biological membrane, might act as an allosteric proteasome activator in TAP degradation. It might interact with TAP and modify its structure, directing the transporter to ubiquitination pathway and then proteasomal degradation. The RGRG motif with sequences similar to glycine and arginine-rich motifs in proteins interacting with RNA, was efficiently recognized by methyltransferase(s), modifying arginine in numerous proteins [69] . The RG repeats represented targets for type-I protein arginine N-methyltransferase. A glycine residue at the n-1 position from arginine was highly conserved among the substrates tested for arginine methylation [69] [70] [71] . The asymmetrical dimethylation of the arginine residues within these RG repeats could dramatically change protein binding [59] . However, this hypothesis needs to be confirmed by additional experiments.",

The optimal binding of UL49.5 to TAP required both TAP subunits [5] , what could be seen in Models 11 and 30, where UL49.5 interacted with the wide surface of TAP. In the case of Model 28, UL49.5 could interact primarily with the TAP protein and only the C-terminus of UL49.5 interacts with TAP2. UL49.5 can cause the downregulation of the MHC I surface expression and interact with the TAP complex in the absence of the N-terminal domains of TAP1 and TAP2. However, deletion of the N-terminal part of TAP2 negatively influenced the binding of UL49.5 and the efficiency of the TAP inhibition. Probably, UL49.5 mainly targets the 6 + 6 TM core of TAP, but requires also the N-terminal region of TAP2 for the optimal inhibition of TAP. Presumably this TAP domain could stabilize the TAP complex in a conformation that favors the UL49.5-TAP interaction [11] . In our theoretical models, UL49.5 interacted with the N-terminal region of the TAP2 protein and with the loop between TM2 and TM3 of TAP2 only in Models 11 and 30. In Model 28, the interactions of UL49.5 with TAP2 were weak. The analysis of the interactions between the C-terminal R 72 GRG 75 motif showed the presence of electrostatic interactions between UL49.5 and TAP only in Model 11. The C-terminal RGRG motif of UL49.5 might be responsible for the appropriate orientation of UL49.5 in biological membranes, driven by strong electrostatic interactions between the arginine side chains and the lipid heads.",

This structure is shown to adopt the inward-open conformation, which was unlikely to be characteristic of a UL49.5-bound transporter. According to the literature, UL49.5 freezes TAP in a conformation that can bind both the substrate and ATP, but it is unable to translocate the peptide [73] . Although the available TAP structure the most likely does not take the correct arrangement of the transporter bound to UL49.5 into account, it may reveal various possibilities for the interaction with UL49.5. Our results show that Model 11, with an interesting orientation and localization of the P27, P31, and P32 residues of UL49.5, exhibited the most optimal interaction potential with TAP (Fig. 7) . These observations are very interesting in light of the previous studies, which suggested that P31 or P32 were important for the appropriate folding of UL49.5 and for the appropriate interaction of UL49.5 with TAP [55] . The orientation of UL49.5 in the UL49.5/TAP complex and the role of the P27, P31, and P32 amino acids in the interaction with TAP should be investigated in future studies by using molecular biology tools.",

Thus far, other TAP-inhibiting UL49.5 proteins have been found in bovine herpesvirus 5, pseudorabies virus, equine herpesvirus 1 and 4, cervid herpesvirus 1, feline herpesvirus 1, and canine herpesvirus. These proteins efficiently block the peptide transport by TAP, thereby preventing the MHC I-mediated presentation of viral peptides and the subsequent elimination of the infected cells by specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes [11, 73] . UL49.5 demonstrates direct interactions with membrane lipids and membrane viral or cellular proteins. In this study, we determined the structure of BHV-1 UL49.5 to find its contribution to the interaction with TAP and to the induced immune evasion. To the best of our knowledge, thus far, no studies on the experimental determination of the structure of UL49.5 have been reported. Knowledge about the 3D structure of this protein can help to explain its interactions and the modulation of TAP during immune inhibition.",

            "text": "Several CD studies using DPC or POPC have suggested that transmembrane proteins derived from pathogenic microorganisms might have a helical intramembrane structure [19] . Our CD data showed that the N-terminal (N.BHV) and the transmembrane-cytoplasmic (TMC.BHV) fragments of UL49.5 adopted helical structures induced by the biological membrane environment. The CD spectra of these two fragments in PBS or in water showed a high content of unordered conformation. Similar studies were performed for the N-terminal half of the ICP47 protein, another TAP viral inhibitor [75] . This peptide was as active in the inhibition of human TAP as the full-length protein. The CD studies of this peptide showed that the viral inhibitor of TAP appeared to be primarily unstructured in an aqueous solution. However, in the presence of membrane mimetics or lipid membranes, an \u03b1-helical structure was formed [75] . In this study, the helical structure of the protein fragments was also confirmed by NMR spectra, which showed the backbone and side-chain NOE effects characteristic of helix structures in the short regions of the investigated peptides. In this paper, the NMR-calculated structure of the N.BHV peptide consisted primarily of a right-handed \u03b1-helix in the A7-G20 regions, whereas TMC.BHV consisted primarily of a right-handed \u03b1-helix in the V40-Nle46 and V49-F58 regions. The regions forming helical structures in the presence of DPC micelles were almost similar to those predicted for the UL45.9 protein in the POPC membrane environment. The final structure of UL49.5 in the POPC membrane consisted of three \u03b1-helical regions. Helix 1 (D2-G20) was located at the N-terminal fragment region (ER lumen domain), helix 2 (V40-M46) and helix 3 (V49-M61) in the middle transmembrane region of UL49.5. This UL49.5 structure remained significantly different from that proposed using a theoretical approach [15] . Similarly, our data showed the helices inside the cellular membrane (Fig. 6A) [13] . According to our results, the ER luminal domain consisting of 1-21 residues was exposed to the aqueous medium and the rest of the domain was immersed in the charged or hydrophobic portion of the POPC membrane.",
