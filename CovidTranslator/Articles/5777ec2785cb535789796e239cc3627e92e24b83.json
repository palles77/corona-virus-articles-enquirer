Proteins destined for lysosomes or secretory granules (in cells which perform regulated secretion) are directed by specific signals once they have traversed the Golgi complex . This hypothesis requires that resident proteins of the ER and Golgi complex have specific signals that cause their retention in the appropriate compartment . Evidence is accumulating to support this idea. A tripeptide which is presumed to lack any signals for transport is secreted rapidly from cells and defines the rate of\"bulk flow\" (47) . Retention signals for both soluble and membranebound ER proteins have been identified (14, 30, 31) . The mannose-6-phosphate modification on lysosomal hydrolases is recognized by a receptor in the Golgi complex which targets these proteins to lysosomes (20 their single membrane-spanning domains were replaced with the first membrane-spanning domain from El. Single amino acid substitutions in this sequence released retention of the chimeric G protein, as well as a mutant El protein which lacks the second and third membrane-spanning domains. The important feature of the retention sequence appears to be the uncharged polar residues which line one face of a predicted alpha helix . This is the first retention signal to be defined for a resident Golgi protein . The fact that it is present in a membrane-spanning domain suggests a novel mechanism of retention in which the membrane composition of the Golgi complex plays an instrumental role in retaining its resident proteins.",

Its characteristic morphology (stacks of flattened saccular membranes) and central location (peri-or juxta nuclear) in the cell may be important for these functions. Four Golgi subcompartments have been defined functionally: cis-, medial-, trans-, and trans-Golgi network . Newly synthesized proteins are thought to move vectorially through the Golgi complex subcompartments via vesicular transport, from the cis-to the trans-side ofthe stack . Endogenous Golgi proteins such as the glycosyltransferases and glycosidases that are involved in the processing of asparagine-linked oligosaccharides are each enriched in a specific subcompartment (8) .

            "text": "We have been studying the sorting of newly synthesized proteins in the exocytic pathway using a model Golgi protein, the El glycoprotein ofthe avian coronavirus infectious bron-chitis virus (IBV)' . The El protein consists of a short, glycosylated amino-terminal domain, three membrane-spanning domains, and a long carboxy-terminal cytoplasmic domain. The restricted intracellular localization of the El protein in coronavirus-infected cells is believed to direct virus assembly at intracellular membranes (45) . When cDNA is expressed in animal cells in the absence of the other viral proteins, the IBV El protein is targeted to cis-Golgi membranes (29) . Deletion of the first and second, or the second and third ofthe three El membrane-spanning domains showed that the first membrane-spanning domain was apparently required for intracellular retention (26) . We show here that the first membrane-spanning domain is a Golgi retention signal, since it is both necessary and sufficient for Golgi retention . Unlike ER retention signals that have been identified at the carboxy-termini of proteins (on either the lumenal or cytoplasmic side of the ER membrane), this Golgi retention signal is buried in the membrane . Our results suggest the novel possibility that the membrane composition of Golgi subcompartments may play an important role in retaining resident proteins in this organelle.",

After a 10 min label, wildtype G protein was -50% trimer (8S) and 50% monomer (4S), consistent with the results of Doms et al. (6, 7) . After 20 min ofchase, all the G protein was found in the 8S trimer peak. Although apparently a monomer after the 10 min label, Gml pelleted after the 20 min chase. Other centrifugation conditions suggested this oligomer was between 15 and 20S (data not shown) . Several mutant G proteins that are grossly misfolded were also shown to pellet under the standard gradient conditions (7; and unpublished results), but unlike Gml, they pelleted immediately after the pulse label. The simplest interpretation ofour results is that Gml was retained specifically by the ml sequence.

Another plasma membrane protein (am), was also retained in the Golgi region when ml replaced the normal membrane-spanning domain, but not when m3 was inserted . The uncharged polar residues that line one face of the alpha helix predicted for ml seem to be the important feature of this sequence . Changing any of three polar residues to an Ile, or insertion of two Ile residues into the middle of ml in the El protein Om2,3 (with the second and third membrane-spanning domains deleted) resulted in transport to the plasma membrane . Thus, ml was shown to be necessary and sufficient for Golgi retention when it was the only membrane-spanning domain in the protein .

Second, there could be a sequence in addition to ml that is involved in retention of full-length El (perhaps in m2) . Third, retention of El could occur via a different mechanism than retention of Om2,3 and Gml . Replacing the polar residues in ml with a hydrophobic residue containing a smaller side chain than isoleucine might be less disruptive to folding and assembly of El, and allow us to assess the contribution of ml to retention of El . We have recently replaced Gln37 in the full-length El protein with alanine, and this replacement appears to release retention and allow transport to the plasma membrane (unpublished results) . We therefore favor the interpretation that ml is involved in retention of full-length El as well as Am2,3 and Gml.

A structural change such as aggregation could occur when a protein arrives in a new compartment, preventing movement into transport vesicles.

The cis-Golgi is thought to differ from the ER in several ways, most notably in lipid composition The Journal of Cell Biology, Volume 115, 1991 and divalent cation concentration . The early Golgi is the first compartment where a newly synthesized protein comes into contact with glucosylceramide and sphingomyelin, which are synthesized there (12, 13) . In addition, the Cal+ concentration is presumed to be significantly lower than in the ER (3) . We are currently analyzing the oligomeric structure of the El protein and the mutant protein Om2,3 . Since Gml is found in an oligomer greater than 15S, the possibility exists that retention of these proteins occurs indirectly via aggregation. We are using both the El protein mutants and the Gml mutants to address the possible direct (receptor mediated) or indirect mechanisms of retention .",

Unfortunately, cDNAs are not yet available for endogenous cis-Golgi proteins, although cDNAs encoding trans-Golgi glycosyltransferases have been isolated (reviewed in 33) . All Golgi glycosyltransferases that have been sequenced have a \"type 11\" membrane topology, with the amino terminus in the cytoplasm, the carboxy terminus in the lumen, and an uncleaved signal sequence which also serves as the membrane-spanning domain (33) . There is no obvious sequence homology between the ml domain of El and the membrane-spanning domains of these proteins . However, there are several observations which support the idea that sequences associated with the lipid bilayer might be involved in retention of proteins in the trans-Golgi complex . Colley et al . (4) have shown that ca2,6 sialyl transferase is efficiently secreted from transfected cells if a cleavable signal sequence is engineered in place of the normal signal an- Figure 9 Two different mutations in the membrane-spanning domain of Gml release retention from the Golgi region .
