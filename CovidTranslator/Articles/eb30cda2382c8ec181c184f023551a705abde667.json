Drug resistance is occurring in bacterial infections such as 'tuberculosis' and 'gonorrhoea', in parasitic infections such as 'malaria', and in viral infections such as AIDS. emerging infection A newly identified and previously unknown infectious disease in humans, often resulting from a breach in the species barrier between humans and animals that carry the infectious agent. Since 1970, there have been over 40 emerging infections identified, causing diseases ranging from diarrheal disease among children, hepatitis, and AIDS to Ebola and Marburg hemorrhagic fevers. eradication The complete interruption of transmission of an infectious disease and the disappearance of the virus, bacterium, or parasite that caused the infection. The only infectious disease that has been eradicated is 'smallpox', which was certified as eradicated in 1980 . International Health Regulations (2005 International law that is intended to protect against the spread of infectious diseases across international borders, aimed at ensuring global public health security. The regulations provide new standards and norms for national and global disease surveillance, notification, and response; and require reporting to the World Health Organization (WHO) of all public health emergencies of international concern, including events or hazards arising from communicable diseases, biological, radionuclear, and chemical agents. reemerging infection A known infectious disease that had fallen to such low prevalence or incidence that it was no longer considered a public health problem, but that is presently increasing in prevalence or incidence. Reemerging infections include 'tuberculosis', which has increased worldwide since the early 1980s, dengue in tropical regions, and 'diphtheria' in Eastern Europe. ",

Some emerge or reemerge in human populations as they cross the species barrier from animals to humans, and once they have infected humans they may be asymptomatic or cause disease. If they cause disease, they may maintain their virulence or decrease in virulence with further passage through human populations. While some of these infectious agents transmit easily from human to human causing epidemics or pandemics, others may not be transmissible, but continue to sporadically infect humans as zoonotic infections. Still others, like HIV infection, may eventually become endemic infectious diseases in humans. Examples of emerging infectious diseases are numerous and clearly demonstrate their complexity, dynamism, and evolution. In the Democratic Republic of Congo, the cessation of smallpox vaccination in 1980, after smallpox had been eradicated, may have contributed to a change in the transmission patterns of human monkeypox. Smallpox vaccine also protects against other orthopox virus infections of humans, including monkeypox. During the 1970s and 1980s, when human monkeypox was the subject of extensive study and the majority of humans were still vaccinated against smallpox, it was shown that person-to-person transmission beyond three generations was rare. In 1996-97, an outbreak of human monkeypox occurred with transmission through at least nine generations and probably more, and large chains of human to human transmission of monkeypox have continued intermittently since then. Poverty and civil unrest appear to be factors that contribute to the increase in human monkeypox infections, and these infections are now better able to sustain transmission because succeeding generations are no longer vaccinated.",

In the Netherlands, in 1999, an outbreak of Legionellosis occurred, which was subsequently traced to exposure to mist from whirlpool baths exhibited at a flower show visited by 80 000 people.

Another clone of multiresistant S. pneumoniae, also first identified in Spain, was subsequently found in the United States, Mexico, Portugal, France, Croatia, Republic of Korea, and South Africa. A study conducted by the Ministry of Health of Thailand on 411 existing tourists showed that 11% had an acute infectious disease, mostly diarrheal, but also respiratory infections, malaria, hepatitis, and gonorrhea.",

Similar legislation in Europe, and later the Americas and other regions, led to the first international sanitary conference in 1851, which laid down a principle for protection against the international spread of infectious diseases: maximum protection with minimum restriction. Uniform quarantine measures were determined at that time, but a full century elapsed, with multiple regional and interregional initiatives, before the International Sanitary Regulations were adopted in 1951. These were amended in 1969 to become the International Health Regulations (IHR), which are implemented by the World Health Organization (WHO).",

They initially required the reporting of four infectious diseases -cholera, plague, smallpox, and yellow fever. But when these diseases were reported, the regulations were often misapplied, resulting in the disruption of international travel and trade, and huge economic losses. For example, when the cholera pandemic reached Peru in 1991, it was immediately reported to WHO. In addition to its enormous public health impact, however, misapplication of the regulations caused a severe loss in trade (due to concerns for food safety) and travel, which has been estimated as high as $770 million. In 1994, an outbreak of plague occurred in India with approximately 1000 presumptive cases. The appearance of pneumonic plague resulted in thousands of Indians fleeing from the outbreak area, risking spread of the disease to new areas. Plague did not spread, but the outbreak led to tremendous economic disruption and concern worldwide, compounded by misinterpretation and misapplication of the IHR (1969) .",

For example, any event that may constitute a global public health threat is assessed by the country in which it is occurring using a decision instrument and, if certain criteria are met, an official notification must be provided to WHO. Notification is mandatory for a single case of human influenza caused by a new virus, poliomyelitis caused by a wild-type poliovirus, smallpox, and SARS.
