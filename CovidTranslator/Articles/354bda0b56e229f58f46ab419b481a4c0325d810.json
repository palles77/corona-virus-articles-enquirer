Worldwide, approximately 2.5 billion people live in dengue-infested regions with about 100 million new cases each year, although many of these infections are believed to be silent. There are four antigenically distinct serotypes of dengue virus; thus, immunity from one serotype will not cross-protect from infection with the other three. The difficulties that hamper vaccine development include requirements of the natural conformation of the envelope glycoprotein to induce neutralizing immune responses and the necessity of presenting antigens of all four serotypes. Currently, the only way to meet these requirements is to use a mixture of four serotypes of live attenuated dengue viruses, but safety remains a major problem. In this study, we have developed the basis for a tetravalent dengue vaccine using a novel complex adenovirus platform that is capable of expressing multiple antigens de novo. This dengue vaccine is constructed as a pair of vectors that each expresses the premembrane and envelope genes of two different dengue virus serotypes.",

These genes are translated from the positive-stranded RNA genome as a single polyprotein that is cleaved into individual proteins by cellular and viral proteases.

This resulted in a pair of vectors expressing the prM and E glycoprotein complex of four DEN serotypes; if administered together, the vector pair would represent all four serotypes. Both prM and E were selected as antigens because several epitopes within the DEN E protein are known to play a significant role in the induction of both neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) and CTL responses (7, 22) and expression of the flavivirus prM protein is necessary for proper processing and expression of E (1, 20, 26) .",

These vectors were able to express high levels of prM and E proteins in vitro and induced potent antibodies against all four DEN serotypes in vivo. Using an improved plaque reduction assay, we show that the antibody responses are indeed neutralizing and are against all four serotypes, presumably because the antigens are naturally expressed and associated with the membrane. Finally, the de novo-synthesized antigens induced broadly reactive cellular immune responses. These responses in combination with neutralizing immunity will be important in developing protective immunity against all four serotypes of DEN. In summary, these data demonstrate efficient induction of immune responses against multiple serotypes of dengue viruses by our cAdVaxbased vaccines and support further investigation into combin-ing the two components to form a tetravalent Ad-based dengue vaccine.",

This presents two major obstacles. First, the neutralizing target antigens (prM and E) must be in their natural conformations to present their receptor binding sites where the neutralizing epitopes reside. Protein antigens synthesized in nonmammalian cell culture are not fully glycosylated and are folded differently; even antigens produced in mammalian cells are denatured during the purification process. Therefore, these antigens often do not induce strong neutralizing responses. Second, it requires presenting antigens of all four serotype dengue viruses at similar ratios to prevent underrepresentation of any one of the four serotypes. This has been particularly difficult to achieve even with live attenuated virus vaccines because each virus is attenuated differently. Furthermore, each attenuated virus may behave differently in different people or populations. Overattenuation may cause a subtype to be underrepresented and cause im-mune enhancement; underattenuation will cause infection in some individuals by the vaccine as seen in the recently halted phase III clinical trials (17) .",

The present report is the first to describe a complex Ad vector system capable of expressing multiple dengue virus prM and E antigens from a single vector with the possibility of inducing tetravalent immune responses in animal models if used in combination. The cAdVax system is capable of accommodating a large amount of foreign antigen sequences and multiple antigen inserts, allowing it to induce the balanced expression of the neutralizing antigens of all four serotypes of the virus. To assure that the prM and E antigens are expressed at similarly high levels, we put the prM and E of each serotype into an identical immediate-early cytomegalovirus CMV/bovine growth hormone polyadenylation cassette and inserted each expression cassette into either end of the cAdVax vector. The potent cytomegalovirus promoter and /bovine growth hormone polyadenylation sequences provide high levels of antigen expression; the near symmetrical insertion of each cassette at both ends of the adenovirus genome provide each expression cassette with a similar flanking environment to assure similar levels of expression. Indeed, our results show similar levels of expression of the prM and E proteins and, more importantly, similar levels of neutralizing immune responses to the serotypes of the dengue virus in vaccinated animals.",

A common criticism of Ad vector use in humans is the possibility of preexisting immunity to adenovirus, in particular adenovirus subtype 5. Adenovirus subtype 5 is the most common subtype used for vector-based gene therapy and vaccine studies. It is also one of the subtypes to which a vast majority of the world is already immune (25) . The presence of circulating Ad neutralizing antibodies has the potential to limit an Ad-based vector vaccine's efficacy. However, a recent clinical trial found no correlation between preexisting Ad-neutralizing antibody titers and potency of an Ad-based influenza vaccine in humans (34) . This is supported by data from the Merck/NIH Vaccine Research Center phase I/II human immunodeficiency virus vaccine trials; it was concluded that using a highly immunogenic antigen, in combination with a higher dose, is sufficient to overcome preexisting immunity (6) . Furthermore, previous studies with our cAdVax-based vaccines indicated that subsequent booster vaccinations are not hindered by primary immunity at all. In fact, the booster vaccinations actually enhance immune responses against target antigens in animal models (35) (36) (37) . This was also supported by the data presented here with our cAdVaxD vaccine vectors.",

The results are a composite of multiple Western blots probed with serotype-and protein-specific antibodies (shown in parentheses): lane 1, DEN2 E (clone 2H3); lane 2, DEN2 E and DEN2 prM (DEN2 hyperimmune ascitic fluid); lane 3, DEN1 prM (clone 8C2); lane 4, DEN1 E (clone 8B9).

Results are a composite of multiple Western blots: lane 1, DEN3 E (clone 8D2-1); lane 3, DEN4 E (clone 1H10-6-7). Lanes 2 and 4 were probed with MAb clones 14A4-8 and 1A2-6, respectively.

The wells in 96-well plates were coated with culture supernatants from Vero cells infected with wild-type DEN2 (A and C) or DEN4 (B and D) and probed with serial dilutions of serum obtained from vaccinated animals at the indicated time points.
