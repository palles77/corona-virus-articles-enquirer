To date, however, detection has required the user to provide multiple signal enhancement solutions and been limited to protein targets. We solve these challenges by using mathematical equations to guide the device design of a novel 2DPN, which leverages multiple fluidic inputs to apply fully dried solutions of hydrogen peroxide, diaminobenzidine, and horseradish peroxidase signal enhancement reagents to enhance the limit-ofdetection of numerous nucleic acid products. Upon rehydration in our unique 2DPN design, the dried signal enhancement solution reduces the limit-of-detection (LOD) of the device to 5 \u00d7 10 11 nucleic acid copies/mL without increasing false positive detection. Our easy-to-use device retains activity after 28 days of dry storage and produces reliable signal enhancement 40 min after sample application. The fully integrated device demonstrated versatility in its ability to detect double-stranded and single-stranded DNA samples, as well as peptide nucleic acids.",

            "text": "While plate-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is still the gold standard to detect viral pathogens, 1\u22123 paper-based pointof-care (POC) diagnostics have revolutionized global health care by improving access and efficiency of these otherwise complex laboratory assays. Lateral flow immunoassays (LFIAs), which are single-channel microfluidic paper devices that detect a pathogen antigen or host antibody response, have miniaturized, automated, and simplified much of the diagnostic process necessary for bacterial and viral pathogen detection. 4 The low-cost, long-term stability, and ease-of-use of LFIAs make them advantageous in low-resource settings. 5, 6 However, LFIAs have limited sensitivity and POC accessibility due to the inability to easily perform signal enhancement via multistep assays. This is because the one-dimensional flow from a single sample pad in LFIAs dictates that the user manually pipettes each fluid sequentially at precisely timed intervals. The need to perform more complex reactions has given rise to twodimensional paper networks (2DPNs), which typically consist of more than one fluidic input and multiple carefully designed channels to control fluid flow in the paper-based device. 5, 6 2DPNs have shown potential for conducting multistep assays in the paper, such as amplifying nucleic acids, 7 detecting more than one target of interest, 8 or enhancing the visual signal at the detection zone compared to LFIA alone. 9 Previous works have set a promising precedent by using 2DPNs as a platform to perform ELISAs for protein detection. By tagging nucleic acid (NA) amplicons with proteins, ELISAs have been translated for detection of NA samples for improved signal clarity as well. 5, 7, 10 Recent developments in chemical ligation assays resulting in enzyme-free NA amplification and CRISPR-based diagnostics have created exciting new molecular platforms for rapid pathogenic detection at low-temperatures and have the potential for improved sensitivities at the POC. However, many of these processes, including templateassisted rapid assay (TARA), produce low product yields (10 2 amplicons of the initial target concentration) when compared to loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) or PCR (10 9 amplicons). 11, 12 To improve this, we have integrated an ELISA into a 2DPN to provide secondary signal enhancement in the detection zone. This enables us to maintain a high sensitivity for these low-yield samples.",

This enabled us to incorporate the enzymatic signal amplification more effectively in our sequential flow, reduce the number and volume of washes, and allow the user to add only a single rehydrating buffer rather than storing and mixing refrigerated reagents in the field.",

Our device (Figure 1 ) builds upon the previous literature to incorporate fully dried ELISA reagents: horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated antibody label, its colorimetric substrate diaminobenzidine (DAB), and redox activator hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ), which are all hydrated by the application of a single solution: phosphate-buffered saline with 0.05% Tween 20 (PBST). We utilize the high affinity of streptavidin\u2212biotin binding, protein conjugation to gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), and ELISA-based signal enhancement to optimize the signal output. By using AuNPs that are conjugated with both streptavidin and HRP and incorporating all reagents as dried source pads, we reduced the number of fluidic inputs to four (one sample and three sites of buffer addition), in comparison to six used in current paper-based ELISAs. 15 Our device demonstrates a limit-of-detection (LOD) of 5 \u00d7 10 11 NA copies/mL, which is comparable to other RNA-based assays quantified in one-dimensional LFIAs with an enhancement solution. 16 Our platform can detect single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), double-stranded DNA (dsDNA), and peptide nucleic acid (PNA) samples at or above this concentration.

The width of the main lateral flow channel for the AuNPbound sample solution was chosen to be 5 mm because it produced the fastest and most consistent flow (Figure 2A ). The width of the signal enhancement leg for the DAB solution was set at 2 mm ( Figure 2B ) because the fluidic resistance of the smaller channel was designed to reduce the backflow of the fluid from the main channel into the signal enhancement leg. In initial experiments, when the fluid from the main channel flowed back into the enhancement leg, reaction of SA\u2212HRP\u2212 AuNP-bound sample with the DAB began before sample binding in the detection region. This resulted in reduced sample binding at the detection zone and increase smearing or background noise. We found the 2 mm channel alone was not enough to prevent backflow. Therefore, we added a 5 \u03bcL \"delay valve\" 19 (2 \u00d7 5 mm 2 ) near the intersection of the 2 mm channel and the 5 mm channel.

Importantly, this allows us to deliver the DAB and H 2 O 2 upstream from the detection zone but downstream from the sample pad to prevent premature signal development and high background signal at the detection zone. Additionally, the intersection is set at a 20\u00b0a ngle from the main channel to ensure flow in only one direction. Previously, inferior performance for leg devices was reported due to parallel reagent delivery, which results in a signal appearing only in the middle of the test zone. 5 To ensure this would not be a problem, we assessed the \"clean delivery\" of each reagent. Clean delivery was defined as each model fluid (food coloring) being delivered across a minimum of 90% of the 5 mm channel width at the detection zone ( Figure 2C ). We established that the DAB leg intersection must be a minimum of 10 mm upstream of the detection zone for this clean delivery to occur ( Figure S4 ).",

Based on the results of these flow studies, the SA\u2212HRP\u2212AuNP-bound sample reached the detection zone at approximately 5 min, followed by clean delivery of the wash solution at the detection zone at 10 min. Therefore, the pre-enhancement signal, occurring prior to DAB and H 2 O 2 delivery, was defined as the signal intensity at 10 min. The DAB and H 2 O 2 signal enhancement solution arrived at the detection zone at 25 min and produced a reliable signal increase at 40 min. To allow time for the signal enhancement reaction to complete, we measured the post-enhancement signal at 60 min although amplification remained stable between 40 and 90 min ( Figure 3A ). In the future, scaling down the device size and liquid volumes could reduce some of the total flow time. However, it is critical to ensure that the unbound SA\u2212HR\u2212AuNPs are fully rinsed to prevent background noise from nonspecific signal development.",

Lathwal and Sikes have investigated a number of enzymatic colorimetric enhancement agents for the improvement of signal visualization on paper-based diagnostics. 20 They found that many common visualization agents did not retain distinguishable positive or negative signals after 40 min and that specifically timed reagent additions, wash steps, stop solutions, and reading times would be necessary.

Test results can be produced within as little as 1 h (based on a 15 min amplification, 5 min sample and reagent application, and 40 min of signal enhancement on the 2DPN). Further optimization or increased amplification time of the TARA reaction and additional characterization of the AuNP\u2212SA\u2212 HRP signal enhancement is feasible to further improve overall LOD. Specifically, the amount of signal enhancement on the 2DPN can be further improved by characterizing the HRP reagent, as the protein used in this assay was a preconjugated, proprietary SA\u2212HRP product with an unspecified amount of HRP molecules attached.",

We improved upon previous 2DPN designs that use DAB as a signal enhancer by reducing the number of fluidic inputs and detection time and by incorporating dry storage of all necessary reagents, including a source for reactive hydrogen peroxide. Our fully dried device has shown versatility in the ability to detect multiple types of nucleic acid samples, including PNA products from a room-temperature RNA amplification reaction, TARA. The applicability of this 2DPN can be extended to detect a variety of pathogens and incorporate other amplification reactions with FITC and biotin-tagged products. The HRP signal enhancement retains activity after 28 days of dry storage on a fully assembled device. The fully dried and assembled device (after a total of 60 min run time) achieved a LOD of 5 \u00d7 10 11 copies of ssDNA per mL, comparable to other hybridization-based nucleic acid detection devices. When combined with TARA, the LOD can reach as low as 5 \u00d7 10 9 target copies/mL and can be further reduced by using other NA amplification methods with higher outputs. The signal in the detection zone is maintained well after the sample is run, reducing the need for the strictly timed reading of results.",

We determined not only the increase in signal intensity but also how that increase affects the true LOD (in copies/mL), a practice we believe should be applied to the design of all LFIAs incorporating signal enhancement agents. This proof-of-concept for a fully dried, deployable 2DPN shows promise for detecting many other pathogens beyond Mers-CoV and can be employed with other nucleic acid amplification techniques.

Template-Assisted Rapid Assay (TARA). TARA is a proprietary RNA amplification technology developed by CrossLife Technologies Inc. 11 TARA is an enzyme-free chemical ligation assay that leverages a target RNA sequence to initiate hybridization of a peptide nucleic acid (PNA) backbone containing FAM to a second PNA strand containing biotin. This results in a single PNA strand with both markers ( Figure S2 ). PNA probes to detect the nucleocapsid gene of MERS-CoV were designed using the Applied Biosystems Primer Express v2 software (structure and sequence details shown in Figure S3 and Table S2 ). Probe hybridization sequences were evaluated by the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) to select regions conserved across multiple transcript variants. For the initial design, target complexity and accessibility were evaluated using Visual OMP (DNA Software Inc., Ann Arbor, MI). PNAs were synthesized by PNAbio Inc. (Thousand Oaks, CA). ssRNA at an initial concentration of 2.0 \u00d7 10 11 copies/mL was purchased from IDT. TARA was performed with the ssRNA at room temperature for 15 min. Dilutions of final TARA products were made in PBST and applied directly to sample pads on 2DPNs that had been dried and assembled within the previous 7 days. The same diluted sample was used for all 2DPN tests. Replicates were performed simultaneously.",

Reagents used throughout this work include PBST (0.05% Tween 20, Millipore Sigma, Inc., Burlington, MA), 40 kDa poly(vinylpyrrolidone) (PVP40) (Millipore Sigma, Inc., Burlington, MA), fraction V bovine serum albumin (BSA) (Biotium, Fremont, CA), sucrose (IBI Scientific, Dubuque, IA), poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) (MW 3350 Da, 0.2% w/v), trehalose (Thermo Fisher Scientific, NJ), FeSO 4 -EDTA (Fe-EDTA) (Millipore Sigma, Inc.), and molecular biology water (Thermo Fisher Scientific). DAB and urea hydrogen peroxide SigmaFast tablets (#D4168, Millipore Sigma, Inc.) were rehydrated according to product specifications for initial dried enzymatic signal testing. For long-term storage tests, hydrogen peroxide urea-adduct (#95314-250G, Millipore Sigma, Inc.,) tablets were crushed into a powder. Streptavidin poly-HRP (SA\u2212HRP, #21140, Pierce Biotechnology, Rockford, IL) and 40 nm AuNPs (G-40-100, Cytodiagnostics Inc., Burlington, ON) for SA\u2212HRP\u2212AuNP conjugation (SA\u2212HRP\u2212AuNPs). Polyclonal goat anti-rabbit biotin conjugate (#31822, Thermo Fisher Scientific). A monoclonal anti-FITC antibody (1F8-1E4, Invitrogen, Rockford, IL) was used for long-term dry storage tests. Due to product changes and subsequent lack of binding for different lot numbers, we switched antibodies and used polyclonal anti-FITC antibody (20C-CR1056SP, Fitzgerald, Bath BA1 1BE, U.K.) for LOD dried tests and for the remainder of the investigation. All oligonucleotide probes were custom-ordered from IDT (Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc., Coralville, IA). Food coloring for one-dimensional flow testing (McCormick Assorted Food Color & Egg Dye). 2DPN materials for fabrication and storage include nitrocellulose (FF80HP) and the cellulose absorbent pad (#3001-861) from GE Healthcare Bio-Science Corp. (Pittsburgh, PA), Grafix Dura-Lar Clear Adhesive-Backed Film (Dick Blick Art Materials, Galesburg, IL), glass fiber reagent storage pads (#GFCP103000, Millipore Sigma, Inc.), and silica gel desiccant (S-3903, ULINE, Pleasant Prairie, WI).",
