In this study, we explored the anti-HSV effects and mechanisms of myricetin both in vitro and in vivo. The results showed that myricetin possessed anti-HSV-1 and HSV-2 activities with very low toxicity, superior to the effects of acyclovir. Myricetin may block HSV infection through direct interaction with virus gD protein to interfere with virus adsorption and membrane fusion, which was different from the nucleoside analogues such as acyclovir. Myricetin also down-regulate the cellular EGFR/PI3K/ Akt signaling pathway to further inhibit HSV infection and its subsequent replication. Most importantly, intraperitoneal therapy of myricetin markedly improved mice survival and reduced virus titers in both lungs and spinal cord. Therefore, the natural dietary flavonoid myricetin has potential to be developed into a novel anti-HSV agent targeting both virus gD protein and cellular EGFR/PI3K/Akt pathway.",

HSV infection causes skin lesions that are generally localized at the oral, nasal, and ocular level with HSV-1 infection, whereas with HSV-2, infections most commonly occur at genital-skin and mucosa sites (Liu and Cohen, 2015; Smith and Robinson, 2002) . Approximately 60%-90% of the adult human population worldwide is sera-positive for HSV-1 (Carr et al., 2001) . The current FDA approved antiviral agents for herpesviruses involve mainly nucleoside analogues, such as acyclovir (ACV) and pencyclovir, which mainly inhibit viral genome replication. Despite these successes, drug resistance, and side effects remain unresolved issues in the fight against HSV infections (Morfin and Thouvenot, 2003) . Hence, the development of novel anti-HSV agents with active mechanisms different from nucleoside analogues is of high importance.",

Pasetto et al. reported that myricetin possessed anti-HIV-1 activities with low toxicity, and it mainly inhibited the activity of HIV reverse transcriptase (Pasetto et al., 2014) . Lyu et al. found that some flavonoids such as myricetin and quercetinin showed moderate inhibitory effects against HSV-1 in Vero cells (Lyu et al., 2005) . Yu and co-workers found that myricetin and scutellarein potently inhibited the SARS-CoV helicase protein in vitro by affecting the ATPase activity, suggesting that myricetin and scultellarein might serve as SARS-CoV chemical inhibitors (Yu et al., 2012) .

In brief, myricetin was added to Vero cells under four different conditions: pre-treatment of viruses, pre-treatment of cells, during virus adsorption, or after adsorption. Subsequently, the antiviral activity was determined by plaque assay. As shown in Fig. 2A , pretreatment of HSV-1 or HSV-2 with 20 \u03bcM myricetin for 1 h before infection significantly reduced the virus titers of HSV, compared to the non-treated virus control group (p < 0.01), suggesting that myricetin may have direct W. Li, et al. Antiviral Research 177 (2020) 104714 interaction with HSV particles. Treatment of myricetin during adsorption or after adsorption also possessed obvious inhibition on virus multiplication (p < 0.05) ( Fig. 2A) . However, pretreatment of cells did not significantly reduce virus titers in vitro ( Fig. 2A) , suggesting that myricetin may not interact with Vero cells directly. Moreover, the indirect immunofluorescence assay under these four conditions (Pachota et al., 2017) indicated that pretreatment of virus with myricetin (10 \u03bcM) before infection also significantly reduced the expression of ICP27 in HSV-1 infected cells (Fig. 2B) , which was in concern with the results in plaque assay ( Fig. 2A) . Thus, myricetin may interact with virus particles to block the adsorption of HSV or inhibit some steps after virus adsorption. Since myricetin may be able to block adsorption and post-adsorption processes of HSV, we further explored the potential inhibition of myricetin on HSV binding and entry process by using immunofluorescence assay. Briefly, for HSV binding assay, HSV-1 (MOI = 1.0) was adsorbed to HeLa cells for 2 h at 4\u00b0C in the absence or presence of 20 \u03bcM myricetin before washing with PBS. For entry assay, HSV-1 (MOI = 1.0) was firstly adsorbed to HeLa cells at 4\u00b0C for 2 h before washing with PBS. Then myricetin (20 \u03bcM) was added to cells and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 1 h. After that, cells were treated with proteinase K to remove adsorbed but not internalized virus. Then the immunofluorescence assay was performed to determine the amount of HSV virions binding to or entering into HeLa cells. As shown in Fig. 2C and E, myricetin treatment (20 \u03bcM) during adsorption significantly decreased the fluorescence of ICP5 protein on cell surface, compared to that in non-treated virus control cells, suggesting that myricetin may block virus adsorption process of HSV. Moreover, at 1 h p.i., many fluorescence spot of ICP5 could be found at the nucleus area (white arrow indicated), suggesting that HSV-1 nucleocapsid had been egressed from late endosomes and delivered to the nuclear periphery in HeLa cells (Fig. 2D) . However, myricetin treatment during entry process dramatically reduced the fluorescence of ICP5 in cytoplasm, and only very little fluorescence could be observed in cell nucleus, suggesting that myricetin may also be able to block HSV entry process in HeLa cells (Fig. 2D, 2F and 2G ). Thus, myricetin may possibly block HSV infection mainly through interfering with HSV binding and entry process.",

In brief, HSV-1 infected Vero cell lysates were digested with pronase in the presence or absence of myricetin (60 \u03bcM), then the amount of gD protein in cell lysates was detected by western blotting. As shown in Fig. 3C , HSV-1 gD protein was obviously protected by protease digestion in the extracts of myricetin (60 \u03bcM) treated cells especially under pronase treatment at 3 \u03bcg/ml, suggesting that myricetin may interact with HSV gD protein in HSV-1 infected Vero cells. However, myricetin (60 \u03bcM) could not protect other virus surface glycoproteins such as gB, gC, and gH/gL proteins from protease digestion in HSV-1 infected cells (Fig. 3D) . Similarly, the cellular surface receptors of HSV-1 such as HVEM and nectin-1 could also not be protected from protease digestion by myricetin (60 \u03bcM) (Fig. 3D) .

Briefly, with HSV-1 gD proteins being immobilized on the chip, myricetin at the concentrations of 0.3125-10 \u03bcM was flowed over the biosensor chip surface, respectively. Data revealed a marked binding of myricetin to virus gD protein in a concentration-dependent manner with a KD equivalent to about 6.088E-8 M (60.88 nM), implicating a high affinity of myricetin for HSV-1 gD protein (Fig. 3E) . Thus, pretreatment of HSV were infected with HSV-1 or HSV-2 (MOI = 1.0) using four different treatment conditions. i) Pre +virus: HSV was pretreated with myricetin (20 \u03bcM) at 37\u00b0C for 1 h before infection. ii) Pre+cell: Vero cells were pretreated with 20 \u03bcM of myricetin before infection. iii) Adsorption: Vero cells were infected in media containing myricetin (20 \u03bcM) at 4\u00b0C for 1 h. iv) Post-adsorption: after removal of unabsorbed virus, myricetin (20 \u03bcM) was added to the cells. At 24 h p.i., virus yields were determined by plaque assay. The results were presented as mean \u00b1 S.D. from five independent experiments. *P < 0.05 vs. virus control group.

(C and D) HSV-1 (MOI = 1.0) infected HeLa cells were treated with or without myricetin (20 \u03bcM) during adsorption process (C) or entry process (D), then after washing three times with PBS, the immunofluorescence assay was performed by using anti-ICP5 antibody to evaluate the amount of virions binding to or entering into cells.

Furthermore, the impact of myricetin on HSV-1 gD binding to Vero cells was further explored using a cell enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, as previously described (Tiwari et al., 2006) . Briefly, Vero cells were first treated with or without myricetin (40, 20, 10, 5 \u03bcM) for 1 h, then the HSV-1 gD protein or myricetin (40, 20, 10, 5 \u03bcM) pretreated gD protein (2 \u03bcg/mL) were added to cells and incubated for another 1 h, The HSV-1 gD proteins were firstly immobilized onto the surface of a carboxymethylated dextran sensor chip (CM5). To assess realtime binding of myricetin to the gD proteins on CM5 chips, myricetin (10, 5, 2.5, 1.25, 0.625, 0.3125 \u03bcM) was flowed over the biosensor chip surface. The sensorgram for all binding interactions were recorded in real time and were analysed after subtracting the sensorgram from the blank channel. Then, the changes in mass due to the binding response were recorded as resonance units (RU). (F) HSV-1 gD binding assay. Vero cells were first treated with or without myricetin (40, 20, 10, 5 \u03bcM) for 1 h, then the HSV-1 gD protein or myricetin (40, 20, 10, 5 \u03bcM) pretreated gD protein (2 \u03bcg/mL) were added to cells and incubated for another 1 h, respectively. Then the amount of gD protein binding to Vero cell surface was detected by ELISA assay using anti-gD antibody and HRP labeled secondary antibody sequentially. Values are means \u00b1 SD (n = 3). Significance: **p < 0.01 vs. virus control group. (G and H) The 2D (G) and 3D (H) binding mode of myricetin with HSV gD protein (PDB ID: 4MYV) was shown. Myricetin is colored in purple, the surrounding residues in the binding pockets are colored in cyan. The backbone of the receptor is depicted as lightblue cartoon. (For interpretation of the references to color in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the Web version of this article.) W. Li, et al. Antiviral Research 177 (2020) 104714 respectively. Then the amount of gD protein binding to Vero cell surface was detected by sequentially incubated with anti-gD antibody and HRP labeled secondary antibody. As shown in Fig. 3F , pre-incubation of gD protein with myricetin (5, 10, 20, 40 \u03bcM) significantly reduced the binding of gD to cell surface in a dose-dependent manner, however, pretreatment of cells did not significantly decrease the amount of gD protein on cell surface. This finding strongly supports that myricetin may interact with HSV gD protein rather than cellular receptors to block virus binding and entry.",

Herein, treatment with myricetin (10, 20 \u03bcM) for 2 h significantly decreased the levels of phosphorylated EGFR from about 2.4 to about 1.4 and 0.8-fold of normal control group, respectively (p < 0.05) (Fig. 4A and D) . Moreover, the activation of downstream signal PI3K was also evaluated, and the results showed that treatment with myricetin (5, 10, 20 \u03bcM) for 2 h significantly decreased the levels of phosphorylated PI3K proteins from about 1.9 to about 1.4, 1.4, and 0.8-fold of normal control group, respectively (p < 0.01) (Fig. 4B and E).

The results of DARTS assay and gD binding assay indicated that myricetin may interact with virus gD protein rather than cellular receptors of HSV to block virus binding and entry (Fig. 3) . The data from SPR assay verified that myricetin can truly bind to HSV-1 gD protein with high affinity (KD \u2248 60.88 nM) (Fig. 3E) . The molecular docking analysis indicated that myricetin may interact with Gln41, Leu44, Glu45 and Asn94 of gD protein through hydrogen bond interactions ( Fig. 3G and H) . Furthermore, myricetin treatment inhibited the activation of EGFR, PI3K and Akt proteins in HSV infected or gD treated non-infected cells, and reduced the mRNA levels of virus proteins in HSV-infected cells (Fig. 5) .

In this study, intraperitoneal therapy of HSV-1-infected mice with myricetin markedly improved their survival and inhibited HSV multiplication in both lungs and spinal cord (Fig. 6) . Moreover, the histopathological analysis indicated that myricetin treatment also significantly attenuated the pneumonia and encephalitis symptoms in HSV-infected mice, comparable to the effects of acyclovir. In contrast to acyclovir, myricetin can block HSV binding and entry process with low toxicity, suggesting that it may be used for therapy and prophylaxis of HSV infection. However, oral administration of myricetin as an antiviral may be unlikely to be successful because of its rapid metabolism. Thus, myricetin may be used for prevention and treatment of herpes simplex pneumonia and encephalitis by intravenous administration in the future.",

Myricetin may block HSV infection through direct interaction with virus gD protein to interfering with virus adsorption and membrane fusion. In addition, cellular EGFR/ PI3K/Akt pathway was also involved in the anti-HSV actions of myricetin. Thus, myricetin merits further investigation as a novel anti-HSV agent targeting both virus gD protein and host EGFR/PI3K/Akt pathway. Further studies of the anti-HSV effects of myricetin against clinical strains especially the acyclovir-resistant strains will be required to advance it for drug development. Nevertheless, myricetin has the potential to be developed into a novel antiviral injection for therapy of herpes simplex encephalitis and pneumonia in the future.",
