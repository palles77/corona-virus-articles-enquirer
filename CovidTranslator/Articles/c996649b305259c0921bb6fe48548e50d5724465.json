The main objective was to investigate the potential threat of stray cats for animal and public health. Samples of blood, stool, hair and auricular swabs were collected from 231 cats in 27 colonies. Anti-Toxoplasma gondii antibodies were detected in 47/194 samples (24.2%); anti-Leishmania infantum antibodies in 1/180 cats (0.6%); intestinal parasites in 23/74 samples (Toxocara cati, Isospora felis, Ancylostoma tubaeforme, Dipylidium caninum, Uncinaria stenocephala, Toxascaris leonina) and Otodectes cynotis in 4/182 cats (2.2%); dermatophyte fungi were isolated in 40/136 samples (29.4%); feline immunodeficiency virus antibodies were detected in 23/226 samples (10.2%); feline leukaemia virus antigen in 14/198 samples (7.1%); and feline coronavirus RNA in 9/127 samples (7.1%). Our results revealed that zoonotic agents, namely dermatophyte fungi and Toxocara cati were present in stray cat colonies in the investigated counties. Overall the low frequency of major pathogens suggests a balanced relationship between host and agents.",

Parasites such as Isospora and Otodectes species cause diarrhoea and otitis. Wild and domestic cats can be infected by viruses such as feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) and feline leukaemia virus (FeLV). FIV is mainly transmitted by bites 7 and causes an immunodeficiency like disease, similar to Adquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) in humans. 8 Vertical transmission is also possible. 9 FeLVis mainly transmitted by saliva and respiratory secretions and it also induces an immunocompromising syndrome. 10 Feline coronavirus (FCoV) causes enteric disease but a biotype known as feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) 11 is the aetiological agent of feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), a fatal immune-mediated disease. 12 This study was undertaken to investigate the frequency of major infectious and parasitic agents in stray cats populations in four counties of the Lisbon Metropolitan Area (map http://www.aml.pt), taking advantage of biological samples collected during a catch-neuter-release (CNR) programme carried out by CATUS, a non-profit cat rescue association.",

This should be the case of the unusual isolation of Trichophyton verrucosum in eight cats (5.9%) also reported by Moriello et al 25 in the United States. This agent is frequently incriminated with dermatomycosis in ruminants and horses but not in cats or dogs. A possible explanation for a transitory contamination of cat's hair coat could be contacts with fomites, plants or soil contaminated by hair and scale of infected sheep and goat flocks or recreation horses, as these cases were found in colonies located in suburban counties with rural areas. On the other hand, the isolation rate of Trichophyton mentagrophytes var mentagrophytes (11.9%) may reflect direct or indirect contact with synantropic animal species with potential for tinea transmission, namely rodents such as rats, as the isolation of this dermatophyte from the hair coat of wild animals and synantropic species is well documented. 26 The isolation of Microsporum canis (12.5%) was an expected finding because this dermatophyte is the main agent responsible for feline dermatophytosis. 27 As stray cats live in close proximity to man, dermatophytoses are becoming a serious public health problem in Europe, especially in the Mediterranean region where the incidence of Microsporum canis infection, particularly in children and immunosuppressed people, has been on a steep increase during recent years. Moreover, all attempts made to eliminate the natural source of infection, mainly represented by stray cats, have failed. 6 For its mitigation, integrated medical and veterinary services, better epidemiological surveillance, more strict rules for animal therapy and CNR programmes to control the population size of free-roaming and feral cats are needed.",

Previous reports for FCoV seropositivity in domestic and stray cat populations 34e36 revealed a much higher prevalence (30%, 34%, 18.3%, respectively). However, the assessment of viral frequency through serological status is not a good marker because it indicates past or present exposure to the virus but not viral shedding. To identify carrier cats, detection of viral RNA is more accurate. 12, 37 FCoV enteric infections and FIP caused by a genetic viral variant of FCoV, have high prevalence in multi-cat environments with high frequency of virus shedding and stressful conditions. 38 These environmental disease determinants are mitigated on stray cat populations due to their free range condition that reduces the odds of infection.",

This scenario allows for daily direct contacts with these cats during feeding as well as indirect contact through fomites, such as clothes and shoes, with their pet cats. Children may also contact with stray cats at schoolyards and public gardens. The proportion of infectious and parasitic zoonosis estimated by our study was low. Thus, stray cats living in colonies at the Lisbon Metropolitan Area appear to pose low risk to humans or other animal species including pet cats. However, the very young and the very old are high risk groups for infectious and parasitic diseases due to temporary or permanent immunosupression. 39 Therefore, they may be infected namely by Microsporum canis, Toxocara cati and Toxoplasma gondii as in this study stray cats seem to act as reservoirs of these agents, highlighting the importance of stray cat populations CNR programmes.",
