Rat parvo viruses nor mally induce latent infections, but, under conditions to be dis cussed, they may be lethal or cause vascular, neurological, and hepatic lesions. Sialodacryoadenitis virus causes nonlethal, self-limiting disease characterized clinically by oculonasal ac cumulations of lacrimai porphyrin pigment, photophobia, and cervical swelling from enlarged salivary glands and morphologically by necrotizing inflammation in the upper res piratory tract, salivary glands, and lacrimai glands. There is recent evidence that keratoconjunctivitis, sometimes resulting in permanent eye damage, can also accompany SDAV infec tion. Rat coronavirus may cause sialoadenitis, but appears to be more pneumotropic than SDAV. It can induce mild intersti tial pneumonia in adult rats and can cause fatal pneumonias in sucklings. Sendai virus has received increased recognition as an important virus of rats, and current evidence indicates that natural infection causes pneumonia.",

Humoral antibodies to minute virus of mice (MVM), pneumonia virus of mice (PVM), reovirus 3, mouse encephalomyelitis virus, and murine adenovirus have been detected in rats. The corresponding viruses, however, are currently considered nonpathogenic for rats. Similarly, cytomegalovirus inclusions have been found in rat tissues, but are not associated with clinical disease or signif icant lesions. Several other viruses [MGH virus, rat submaxil lary gland virus (RSMG), and Novy virus] and viruslike agents (enzootic bronchiectasis, gray lung, wild rat pneumonia) have been reported in rats, but their significance is unclear. There fore, this chapter concentrates primarily on rat parvoviruses, rat coronaviruses, and Sendai virus. The viruses are reviewed individually, but the reader is encouraged to peruse Section VII for broad approaches to the detection, diagnosis, and control of virus infections in rat colonies. Oncogenic viruses of rats, po tential or confirmed, are not discussed. ",

Parvoviruses have been isolated from rodents, birds, dogs, cats, pigs, cattle, nonhuman primates, and humans.

The literature on rat parvoviruses is extensive, but much of it per tains to experimentally induced infections in hamsters and sev eral other species, as well as in rats. Since this report centers on natural parvovirus infections of rats, only experimentally range in size from 18 to 30 nm depending on conditions of purification and measurement and appear to have 32 capsomeres (69, 142, 158) . Rat virus has a bouyant density in CsCI of about 1.40 gm/ml, and its molecular weight is approximately 6.6 x 10 6 daltons (138) . Rat virus and H-l virus retain infectivity and hemagglutinating activity after exposure to ether, chloroform, or alcohol and are stable at pH's from 2 to 11 at 4\u00b0,25\u00b0, and 37\u00b0C (47, 78) . They also are remarkably temperature resistant. Rat virus can remain infectious after exposure to 80\u00b0C for up to 2 h, for more than 6 months at -40\u00b0C, and for up to 60 days at 40\u00b0C (162) . The stability of RV and H-l virus to variations of temperature and pH may, however, depend on virus strain and supporting medium (18, 86) . These viruses are inactivated by ultraviolet light at room temperature (25, 155) . They are, however, resistant to ultrasonication, RNase, DNase, papain, trypsin, and chymotrypsin-properties which facilitate preparation of purified virus from infected cell cultures (20, 46, 97, 154, 158) .",

            "text": "ii. Hemagglutination and hemadsorption. Hemagglutination is a common property of rat parvoviruses and is the simplest method to detect them. Guinea pig erythrocytes are preferred to detect RV, H-l virus, and H-3 virus. The test can be run at 4\u00b0, 25\u00b0, or 37\u00b0C (78, 110) . Rat parvoviruses agglutinate erythrocytes of other species to variable degrees, and it has been suggested that differential agglutination be used to identify virus strains (153, 154) . Since the hemagglutinin is cell associated, cell debris should be pretreated with deoxycholate, receptor-destroying enzyme, or, preferably, alkaline buffer (48) . Portella (126) showed that RV, H-l, and H-3 caused adsorption of guinea pig erythrocytes to virus-infected cells, but this technique is not generally used as a diagnostic test. iii. Antigens. Neutralizing (NT), hemagglutination inhibition (HAl), and complement fixation (CF) tests have shown that rat parvoviruses consist of two major antigenic groups (36, 86, 110, 126, 151, 154) . One group includes RV, H-3, X-14, and HER viruses, and the other includes H-l and HT viruses (Table II) . Some cross-reactivity has been detected by immunofluorescence (FA) among RV, H-l virus, and MVM (36, 54) . d. In Vitro Cultivation. Rat virus and H-l replicate well in primary monolayer cultures of rat embryo cells (78) . Hamster embryo cultures support viral growth less well, and cells of mouse, chicken, calf, or human origin are unsuitable for RV, but the H viruses can grow in human, monkey, rat, and hamster cells [reviewed by Siegl (142) ]. Primary cultures should be prepared from rats free of RV and H-l virus infection, and all cell lines should be checked for latent contamination with parvoviruses.",

Kilham (71) surveyed several popu lations of wild rats near Hanover, New Hampshire, and de tected HAI antibody to both RV and H-l virus. The proportion of rats with antibody to each virus varied independently for each population. Robinson and co-workers (131) made an ex tensive seroepizootiological study of RV in a closed colony of 2000 McCollum rats with an annual production of about 3000 rats. Forty percent of rats without maternal antibody seroconverted to RV by 7 weeks of age, and 67% had anti-RV anti body by 7 months (Fig. 17 ). If several pups in a litter sustained infection, most cagemates developed antibody (Fig. 18 ). Pas sive antibody titers disappeared by 2 months. About 70% of 1000 juvenile rats were susceptible to infection at any given time, whereas 30% were actively immune (Fig. 19 ). Several attempts to isolate RV from immune rats were unsuccessful. Seroconversion to H-1 virus was not detected, but about half of the litters had transient maternal antibody to H-1 virus. These studies demonstrated that RV is readily transmitted among rats held in confined quarters and that infections are perpetuated by sustained introduction of susceptible hosts.",

The studies of Kilham and Olivier (78) and Kilham and Margolis (73) indicated that natural verti cal transmission can occur. Experimental studies from several laboratories support these impressions. Kilham day of gestation and showed that transplacental and fetal infec tion with fetal death occurred although dams remained asymptomatic. They also found that RV replication was wide spread in tissues of pregnant dams and that dams developed viremia which contributed to placental infection. These obser vations parallel those of natural RV infection where signs may be limited to fetal r\u00e9sorption and reduced litter size (see Sec tion II, A, 1, f). In contrast, H-1 virus infected rat fetuses only after intraperitoneal inoculation but not after oral inoculation of pregnant mothers. These workers suggested that in rats H-1 virus is more likely restricted to horizontal transmission primarily among sucklings and that adults are susceptible to clinical disease only if they are debilitated by intercurrent in fections or leukemia. Lipton et al. (84) reported that viremia and virus infection of intestine, lung, liver, spleen, brain, and kidney followed intragastric inoculation of adult rats with the HER strain of RV. Furthermore, virus was excreted in feces but not in urine for up to 12 days, and inoculated rats were infectious for contact cohorts for 15 to 20 days. They were also able to infect rats by intranasal inoculation. Novotny and Hetrick (116) did find RV in urine of suckling rats inoculated parenterally as newborns with high doses (10 6 LD 50 ) of RV. Dams and siblings of infected sucklings developed HAI an tibodies to RV which indicated that horizontal infection had ensued. Vertical transmission of RV was also confirmed, since litters born 2 to 5 days after intraperitoneal or intravenous (iv) inoculations of mothers had 100% mortality, whereas rats in oculated at least 2 weeks before conception delivered normal litters. Furthermore, litters of infected dams developed disease when nursed by normal mothers, whereas normal litters nursed on infected mothers remained well. Kilham and Margolis (73) showed that RV may be excreted briefly in milk by rats inocu lated with RV in late pregnancy. Dams infected on the first postpartum day had RV in milk by 24 h and could excrete virus in milk up to 12 days and up to 5 days after HAI antibody appeared in their serum.",

(130) isolated RV from five clinically normal laboratory rats, all of which had HAI antibody to RV, and the rat with the highest antibody titer had the most widespread infection. La tent RV infection also was activated in clinically normal rats by a single nonlethal dose (150 mg/kg) of cyclophosphamide (40) . The repository of latent RV is unknown, but Margolis and Kilham (91) suggested that, since RV favors rapidly dividing cells, the gastrointestinal tract or hematopoietic system are likely sites. In addition, factors that contribute to RV latency and the role of latency in H-l virus infection are not under stood. Nevertheless, it must be assumed that seropositive rats are latently infected and can serve as a potential source of infection to all susceptible rats in a colony. Furthermore, since some strains of rat parvoviruses can be transmitted vertically, even caesarian-derived or germfree rats can not be assumed free of infection until they have been tested serologie ally. Clinical signs in adult rats include neurological disturbances, sudden death, and hemorrhagic diatheses (e.g., scrotal hemor rhage and cyanosis). The incidence of clinical signs among infected adults is likely to be low, but may be exacerbated by immunological crippling. In breeding colonies, production may decrease, or neurological deficits and jaundice may occur among sucklings.",

Since RV-infected colonies are common, specific an tibodies per se only indicate subclinical infection has occurred.

Since rat parvoviruses cause latent infections and may be transmitted vertically and/or horizontally, proce dures to control infection must be planned carefully and adhered to stringently. Once a colony has been infected, infec tion can be eliminated effectively only by destroying the col ony and repopulating from parvo virus-free stock. For experi mental colonies, this usually requires purchase of rats from vendors who have adequate serological monitoring programs. For production colonies, it means rederiving breeding stock by caesarian section, nursing sucklings on parvo virus-free foster dams, and testing weanlings for antibody before they are used for breeding. Physical facilities for rederived stock should in clude pathogen-free barriers with personnel locks and proper air balancing to prevent reinfection. Periodic serological sur veillance also is essential to detect possible reinfection as early as possible.",

For example, they can contaminate transplantable neoplasms (78, 150) and established cell lines (49, 163) . Therefore, it is reasonable to assume, because of their predilection for rapidly dividing cells, that they could alter the growth characteristics of affected cells. Furthermore, parvoviruses are pathogenic for fetal and suckling rats and hamsters, so inadvertent inoculation, especially of young ani mals, with virus-contaminated cells could cause fatal infection. Immunosuppression also can activate latent RV infection in older rats (40) , so rats subjected to immunosuppression or severe stresses, such as intercurrent infections or surgical trauma, may be at risk. Conversely, there is recent evidence that RV can suppress proliferative responses of infected lym phocytes to concanavalin A, phytohemagglutinin, or allogeneic lymphoid cells (25, 26) . If infected adult rats are used for experiments unaffected by latent viral infections, parvovirus infection can be tolerated, because it is unlikely that rats will develop clinical signs or lesions. Since all factors relevant to latent infection have not been identified, a decision to work with infected animals should be made cautiously. Fi nally, since these viruses are so hardy, instruments should be thoroughly disinfected after contacting infected animals to re duce the spread of infection.",

They described the morphology of the dis ease in considerable detail and named it sialodacryoadenitis from the characteristic lesions: inflammation and edema of salivary and lacrimai glands. Hunt (58) described a similar disease of young rats, but inflammation was restricted to the intraorbital lacrimai glands and was accompanied by keratoconjunctivitis. Innes and Stanton suggested an infectious agent caused the disease, and Hunt detected acidophilic intra nuclear inclusion bodies in affected Harderian glands and in conjunctival mucosa, but viral isolations were not attempted in either study. Ashe and co-workers (3,4) isolated a transmissi ble cytopathic viral agent from the submaxillary glands of gnotobiotic rats that hemagglutinated rabbit erythrocytes. Ashe's virus apparently was not associated with clinical signs or lesions in infected rats (see Section IV,B). Jonas et al. (67) induced sialodacryoadenitis in germfree rats by intranasal in oculation of an ultrafiltrate of diseased submaxillary salivary gland. Virus particles were detected in ducts of submaxillary glands from experimentally infected rats by electron micro scopy, but attempts to isolate an agent in vitro were initially unsuccessful. However, when neonatal mice were inoculated ic with submaxillary gland homogenate they developed severe neurological deficits and died in 3 to 6 days. Brain homogenates from affected mice caused sialodacryoadenitis in intranasally inoculated rats. Bhatt and co-workers (15) subsequently isolated a virus from salivary glands of affected rats by inocu lation of neonatal mice and primary rat kidney (PRK) monolayer cultures. The isolate had serological and physicochemical characteristics of a coronavirus. It was lethal for infant mice after ic inoculation but not for weanling mice. Mouse brainpassaged virus induced sialodacryoadenitis in susceptible rats.",

In the former setting, adults may have clinical signs, but more com monly they are immune. Therefore, clinical disease develops among susceptible sucklings and is characterized by so-called ' 'winking and blinking ' ' associated with acute inflammation of the eye and adnexae. Signs are transient (1 week or less) among individual sucklings, but affected animals will be prev alent among the suckling population as long as newly suscep tible litters are available to become infected. In the latter situa tion, either new, SDAV-susceptible rats are placed in a room with infected rats or an infected rat(s) is placed in a room housing nonimmune weanlings or adults. Generally, within 1 week, the susceptible population will develop typical signs of SDAV infection. For individual rats they include cervical swell ing (edema) with palpable enlargement of submaxillary sali vary glands, sneezing or repeated wiping of the external nares with the forepaws, photophobia and nasal, and ocular dis charges which are often red-tinged due to a high content of porphyrin pigment. Clinical signs last about 1 week. They may be mild or severe, and all signs do not occur in every infected rat. This last point is especially significant, since a single subclinically infected rat placed in a susceptible colony can initiate a full enzootic episode.",

Lesions usually resolve completely in 1 to 2 weeks, but chronic active keratitis and megaloglobus may develop in some rats. The morbidity of eye lesions during an acute outbreak of SDAV infection varies from 0 to 100%, but is usually 10 to 30%. The prevalence of eye lesions seems greater among breeding colonies chronically infected with SDAV (65) . The severity of lesions also may vary among strains of rats.

Lesions were most prominent in weanlings and included focal or diffuse interstitial keratitis, corneal ulc\u00e9ration, synechia, hypopyon, hyphema, and con junctivitis (Figs. [31] [32] [33] [34] . Lesions resolved in most rats by 6 weeks of age, but about 6% of affected rats developed chronic keratitis with megaloglobus and lenticular and retinal degener ation. Similar lesions in adult rats, excluding chronic sequellae, were reported by Weisbroth and Peress (161) . Affected rats from both outbreaks had a high incidence of dacryoadenitis and serum antibody to SDAV. In the Yale study (80) SDAV was recovered from the respiratory tract of some rats, but virus was not detected in the eyes either by tissue culture isolation techniques or by immunofluorescence. It has been suggested that inflammation and necrosis of lacrimai glands during SDAV infection results in impedence to flow of lacrimai fluids, proptosis, and keratitis sicca.

Infected rats excrete virus from the respiratory tract for about 7 days, at which time anti-SDAV antibody is first detectable in serum by either NT or CF tests ( Fig. 30 and Table V) (61) . There is no evidence for a carrier state, so recovered rats should be considered free of virus and immune. Therefore, propagation of virus in a colony depends on continuous intro duction of susceptible rats. The possibility remains, however, that as with some human coronavirus infections (109) rats im mune to a strain of SDAV could be reinfected with the same strain or with an antigenically different strain. There also is no evidence that SDAV can be vertically transmitted, but this point has not been adequately tested.",

Serum titers of CF and NT antibody should be determined simultaneously, since recent studies of natural and experimental SDA indicate that CF antibody titers rise during outbreaks then decline rela tively rapidly, whereas NT titers increase during infection, but decline more slowly (Fig. 37) (14) . Therefore, CF antibody titers appear be a better marker for current or recent infection, whereas NT antibody titers are a more reliable indicator of previous infections. Sialodacryoadenitis virus infection is probably widespread among rat colonies. We recently tested retired breeders from six vendors, and all had anti-SDAV antibody (10) . Neverthe less, confirmation that antibody detected during a given out break is due exclusively to SDAV infection may be difficult to obtain, since RCV and SDAV are closely related antigenically, and seroconversions for both viruses and to MHV follow infec tion by either RCV or SDAV. Bhatt et al. (15) have shown, however, that antibody titers to the homologous virus are usu ally higher than those to the heterologous, antigenically related viruses (Tables III and IV) Fig. 37 .

First, clinical signs of rhinitis and sialodacryoadenitis are common during SDAV in fection and keratitis may occur, whereas RCV infection is asymptomatic. Second, RCV causes mild interstitial pneu monia in adults, whereas SDAV does not.

The key to effective control in infected colonies stems from recognition that infected rats shed virus for about 7 days and then are immune and that latent infections do not occur. Since SDAV spreads rapidly through a susceptible colony, all rats in a room should be infected and immune in 3 to 5 weeks. Thus, infected holding or experimen tal colonies should be quarantined for at least 4 weeks and preferably 6 to 8 weeks after infection is detected. In produc tion colonies, breeding should cease for 6 weeks and weanlings should be removed from the room, since sucklings and wean lings of infected dams are particularly susceptible to infection. The quarantine period may be reduced by increasing contact exposure among susceptible rats. If susceptible rats are elimi nated (e.g., weanlings and rats introduced from other colonies) the infection will disappear (14) . However, once immune rats are replaced by susceptible rats, the opportunity for infection again increases. In addition, the possibility of reinfection with the same strain or with a different strain of coronavirus has not been ruled out. The immune status of the colony and of any rats to be introduced can be established by serological monitor ing.

There are HAI and NT tests available, but the CF test appears to be most sensitive (118, 141) .

LCM infection has not been detected in laboratory rats, but infection can be induced experimentally. Monjan and col leagues (104, 105, 107, 108) have induced cerebellar 4 'hypo plasia\" and retinopathy in ic inoculated suckling rats. Cerebel lar hypoplasia was secondary to necrosis of the cortex which was most severe in rats inoculated 4 days postpartum. Interest ingly, cerebellar lesions were prevented by immunosuppressing rats with anti-lymphocytic serum (106) and were elicited by adoptive immunization of infected rats with LCM virus-immune splenic cells (105) . Therefore, the pathogenesis is similar to that observed for LCM disease in mice in that cell-mediated immunity to LCM virus is required to cause acute lesions. The retinal lesions were characterized by progressive destruction of all retinal layers and modest inflammation, and the presence of LCM virus in all layers of retina. The retinal lesions were also inhibited by immunosuppression (108).",

As a rule, we recommend testing equal numbers of males and females at 90 days of age and also retired breeders at 9 to 12 months of age. The number of rats tested may vary according to the goals of the program, but we suggest that a minimum of 10 rats per age group from a given room be screened twice yearly for a total of 40 rats annually. For intramural production colonies or longterm holding colonies, no more than 1 rat per cage should be included in a single sample population, but blood or tissues from all rats selected should be collected on the same day.

Seroconversion or increasing titers of antibody to a particular viral antigen over several weeks is commonly accepted as good presumptive evidence of active or recent viral disease. Anti body alone, however, indicates only that exposure to a viral agent or to an antigenically related agent may have occurred. For example, it was known that rats developed humoral anti body to MHV (51); however, signs or lesions of MHV infec tion were never seen in rats. Parker et al. (120) and Bhatt et al. (15) showed subsequently that rat antibodies to MHV were elicited by rat coronaviruses (SDA and RCV), viruses which are antigenically related to MHV. Thus, antibody induced by one virus reacted with all three viruses. Similarly, isolation of a virus per se during a suspected outbreak may be misleading, since passenger viruses, multiple viral infections, or latent viruses with no influence on the problem under investigation may occur. Therefore the significance of serological and virological findings must be assessed after evaluating clinical signs, lesions, and epizootiological data. Furthermore, before a final diagnosis is confirmed, the veterinarian must critically evaluate information about an outbreak and compare it to his or her knowledge about the suspected infection derived from per sonal experience or from the scientific literature. Diagnosis of viral infection must be combined with a search for its source. For example, rats lose colostrum-derived antibody pro gressively and, around the time of weaning, can become sus ceptible to viruses to which they were passively immune. Therefore, although infection may be present in a vendor col ony, it is possible that weanling rats can be infected by an \"in-house\" source after arrival when passive immunity has decayed. It may be helpful in such situations to test whether rats received from a vendor become seronegative and remain free of infection when held in isolation for several weeks.*",

Other workers also have found that acute lethal disease, often ac companied by hemorrhage, was most easily induced in neonatally inoculated rats (111,116). Kilham and Margolis (74) found that typical cerebellar lesions developed only in rats inoculated before day 4. Hepatitis with jaundice but without fulminating generalized disease occurred in sucklings inocu lated between days 6 and 12. Sucklings inoculated after day 12 developed only mild self-limiting hepatitis. The only sign of infection in adults was seroconversion. Inclusions appeared in liver by 24 h after infection and per sisted in some rats for up to 3 weeks. Persistence of virus in liver was attributed to increased mitotic activity postpartum which lasts up to 6 weeks. Ruffolo et al. (137) supported this view by showing that the susceptibility of adult rat liver to H-l virus could be reestablished by partial hepatectomy or by car bon tetrachloride hepatotoxicity. Postnecrotic progression and repair of liver lesions occurred in several stages (94): (a) giant cell formation and polyploidy (Fig. 6); (b) biliary hyperplasia",

Sialodacryoadenitis virus causes a characteristic CPE in PRK monolayer cultures with formation of multinucleated giant cells(15). Cultures can be prepared from SDAVfree or infected rats, since SDAV does not infect kidney. Cul tures are most sensitive if inoculated by 1 week after seeding. Older cultures appear to be less sensitive to viral replication, and CPE may not develop. Virus can be detected in the cyto plasm by immunofluorescence within 12 h after inoculation. Cytopathic effects appear by 24 h and extensive lysis occurs shortly after. Sialodacryoadenitis virus does not replicate in BHK-21, VERO, or HEp-2 cell lines; a line of polyomatransformed mouse cells (Py-Al/N); or mouse cell line NCTC 1469 which supports growth of MHV(15).
