While systems for handling such extracorporeal material will vary between jurisdictions, for the most part it is preferred for routine cases that all clothing and property is left at the home of the deceased. In such instances, once the police and forensic pathologist are satisfied the case is routine in nature, the clothing and property are removed and clearly recorded. In the description of such items, generic terms should be used at all times; for example, a gold ring with rubies should be described as a gold-colored ring with red-colored stones. It is recommended that the removal of clothing and property be done in the presence of two independent parties such as a police officer and the body transporter. Both parties will then sign the accompanying documentation in order to maintain a clear chain of custody of the items. On occasion it is inappropriate to remove the clothing and property at the scene, for example, when the death occurs somewhere other than at the person's home, such as in the street, or for cases that are nonroutine in nature. In this instance any clothing, property, and extracorporeal material will be removed on arrival at the mortuary or after examination by the pathologist.

The body should only be touched or moved in consultation with the police, forensic scientists, and/or forensic pathologist. Prior to removal, the body should be carefully placed on a sheet of plastic and then into a body bag, which is sealed in the presence of investigating police members. The reasons for this process are twofold: (1) to ensure no fibers or trace evidence are lost; and (2) to maintain an appropriate chain of custody of the deceased, all clothing and property, and any evidentiary material present. In the majority of these cases, it is important that the deceased remains absolutely undisturbed before examination by the forensic pathologist. This ensures accurate interpretation of evident disturbances to the deceased, his/her clothing, and property. For example, in cases of sexual assault the disarray of clothing may provide the pathologist with an indication of such an assault, and might highlight the possibility of injury. In addition, the clothing folds may contain evidence such as semen, hairs, or fibers that would otherwise be disturbed in removing the clothing or transporting the body. Alternatively, folds or patterns in clothing where it is bunched about the deceased may be causative of certain injuries, the interpretation of which is best performed in conjunction with viewing the clothing in situ.",

These procedures should not occur in forensic cases as they may produce postmortem artifact or injury, which is sometimes difficult to interpret at a later stage. Occasionally, a case which initially seems straightforward and does not warrant further investigation turns out to be something more complex and as such may require more detailed forensic examination.

The equipment may provide vital information as to the cause of death or the circumstances immediately before death and thus it must all remain intact and accompany the deceased. This procedure makes for a bulky and awkward body transfer. Ideally an expert should be present at the scene to examine the equipment, ensuring all valves are turned off, and settings are secure so as not to be accidentally altered during transit. In diving fatalities, radiography for air embolism should be performed as soon as possible. In light of this, it is crucial that the body be transported as quickly as possible to the mortuary.",

However, certain cases are deemed high risk purely due to their nature. These high-risk cases include intravenous drug users, prostitutes, homosexuals, or persons recently imprisoned. If this is the situation, extra care should be taken to avoid contact with body fluids, and safety glasses, surgical masks, and double gloves may be worn. Staff should always be observant for sharps and other foreign objects. To prevent splashes, a towel or absorbent material can be placed over any open wounds, or the face of the deceased person. In cases where there is identified a risk for airborne biohazard such as tuberculosis or severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), a towel should be placed over the face to prevent the escape of sputum or other fluids, and an appropriate face mask or respirator worn by the body transporters.",

In many instances, once the body is removed from the scene the level of contamination is low. However, each situation needs to be separately and fully assessed on an individual basis. Representatives from Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and/or Work Safe or similar occupational health and safety authorities may be able to offer advice on specific risks. If the chemical cannot be identified, the case should be treated as highly toxic and maximum protection should be worn by workers. In extreme cases the body is decontaminated prior to removal. To do this, it is recommended the body be photographed in situ, and then the clothing and property removed, bagged, and labeled. Scene workers wearing selfcontained breathing apparatus should then repeatedly hose the deceased. Generally, the fire brigade controls the scene, and only personnel trained in decontamination procedures should enter. In any case where there is suspicion of chemical contamination, a safety officer should be assigned to monitor the level of toxic fumes continually and ensure that the safety of the staff is adequate.",
