A large number of closely related viruses are present in wildlife reservoir populations (4) (5) (6) . Therefore, due to cross-species transmission of the same or a similar coronavirus, SARS could recur. Immune protection against infection with other human coronaviruses, such as OC43 and 229E, is short-lived (7) . To assess SARS patients' risk for future reinfection, we conducted a longitudinal study of immunity in convalescent patients.",

The ELISA was based on an inactivated preparation of whole-virus lysate. The kit was the fi rst commercial kit approved by the Chinese Food and Drug Administration for specifi c detection of SARS-CoV antibodies and has been widely used in several studies (9) (10) (11) . Manufacturer's instructions were followed without modifi cation. Briefl y, for every ELISA plate, 1 blank, 1 positive, and 2 negative controls were included. For detection of immunoglobulin G (IgG), a 1:10 dilution of testing serum (100 \u03bcL) was added to antigen-coated wells, and the plate was incubated at 37 o C for 30 min. Horseradish peroxide (HRP)-conjugated antihuman IgG (100 \u03bcL) was then added for detection of bound antibodies. For detection of IgM, the incubation of primary antibodies was extended to 60 min, followed by detection with HRP-conjugated antihuman IgM. Optical density (OD) readings were deemed valid only when the negative control OD was <0.10 and the positive control was >0.50 on the same ELISA plate. The cutoff for IgG and IgM determination was defi ned as 0.13 and 0.11, respectively, plus OD of the negative control. When the OD of the negative control was <0.05, 0.05 was used for the calculation. In this study, the OD readings of negative controls from different testing were consistently <0.05, so the cutoff ODs for IgG and IgM were 0.18 and 0.16, respectively. Serum samples that had an OD greater than or equal to the cutoff value were considered positive. Weak positive samples (i.e., OD<2\u00d7 cutoff value) were retested in duplicate on the same day; only reproducible positive results were included in the fi nal analysis. All data were processed by using Excel version 7.0 (Microsoft Corp., Redmond, WA, USA) and SPSS software version 10 for Windows (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).",

As shown in the Table, at \u22487 days after the onset of symptoms, the percentage who were IgG positive was \u224811.80%. This percentage continued to increase, reached 100% at 90 days, and remained largely unchanged up to 200 days. Furthermore, after 1 and 2 years 93.88% and 89.58% of patients, respectively, were IgG positive, which suggests that the immune responses were maintained in >90% of patients for 2 years. However, 3 years later, \u224850% of the convalescent population had no SARS-CoV-specifi c IgG. The OD changes correlated with the changes to the IgG-positive percentage, although the rate of change varied. Both the OD readings (0.93) and positive percentages peaked at 90-120 days; however, the rate of reduction of the average OD readings was much faster, dropping by 22% (0.73) and 40% (0.54) at 1 and 2 years, respectively, after symptom onset (Figure 1) . A similar observation was obtained for IgM trends in this same cohort. The percentage of patients who were IgM positive within the fi rst 7 days was 21.4% and peaked at 76.2% after 21-30 days (Table) . The patterns of IgM-positive percentage and average OD readings were similar; both peaked at 21-30 days. After 60 days, the average OD readings dropped to 0.167, close to the cutoff value of 0.160.",

With a large number of patients who had confi rmed transmission history (176) and a complete dataset for 18, the level of confi dence is high that the results obtained in this study are representative for convalescent SARS patients. Similar results have been reported from longitudinal stud-ies of SARS patients with smaller cohort size (18-98 patients) and shorter follow-up period (240 days to 2 years) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) . The general trend of IgM peaking at \u22481 month after symptom onset and IgG peaking at 2-4 months was consistent among different studies.",
