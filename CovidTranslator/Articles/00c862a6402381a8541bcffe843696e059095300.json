RT-PCR for TReoV detected 3.3 % positive samples and TReoV was successfully isolated in Vero cells. Histological analysis of positive bursa of Fabricius (BF) revealed atrophied follicles and lymphocyte depletion. The number of CD8?, CD4? and IgM? cells was lower in infected BF. Phylogenetic analysis based on S3 gene showed that the Brazilian TReoV isolates clustered in a single group with 98-100 % similarity to TReoV strains circulating in the United States. This is the first indication that TReoV infection may be a contributing factor to immunosuppression in young birds.",

In turkeys, a group of TReoVs has been described that are genetically distinct, based on sequence analysis of their S3 genomic segments, from the other members of the genus Orthoreovirus [10] . These TReoVs were originally isolated from commercial turkey flocks, especially those in the southeastern United States, affected by PEC [8, 13-15, 19-21, 23, 24] . TReoVs can induce enteric disease and immunosuppression in turkeys; their pathogenicity is restricted to poults, however [19] . The aim of the present study was to isolate and molecularly characterize the first documented TReoV affecting immunosuppressed young poults in Brazil.",

Fifty samples from the bursa of Fabricius (BF), thymus, and intestinal contents and tissues were collected and sent to the laboratory. The samples were divided evenly into two groups.

For CD4?, CD8? and IgM? cells, significant differences between groups were determined by one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey's multiple comparison test. A value of p \\ 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Data are expressed as mean \u00b1 standard deviation (SD). All statistical analyses were performed using Prism software (GraphPad \u00d2 , CA, USA).

This was confirmed here by analyzing BF histological sections from field cases for the presence of CD4?, CD8?, and IgM? lymphocytes.

This biological mechanism could explain, for instance, the lymphocyte depletion observed here, although lymphocytes are not considered a target for reovirus replication [11] . Importantly, the death of lymphocytes before two weeks of age can result in permanent immunosuppression [11] . The lack of inflammation in the BF and of histological changes in the thymus suggests that the infection observed in this study was in its initial phase. However, the observation of severe BF lesions and isolation of TReoV from these samples, along with the confirmation of TReoV in intestinal tissues and contents via PCR, means that these cases can be considered non-classical enteritis [1] .",
