Analysis of data by Chi-squared, ANOVA, multiple regression and negative control test or case to case for vaccine effectiveness assessment in primary care and SHLCI respectively. Results: Moderate-high intensity and early onset season with predominance of influenza B virus (IVB) (63%) followed by an increase of circulation of influenza A virus (IVA).

In severe case hospitalizations due to severe influenza, >64 age group presented the highest hospitalization rates (60.95/100,000) compared to other age groups, which highlights the need to increase vaccine coverage in this age group to prevent mortality. 12 The delay in the administration of antiviral drugs, from the onset of symptoms in those patients with a risk condition of complication identified such as elderly people or people with underlying chronic illnesses, is likely to be a bad prognosis of the flu vaccine. This fact evidences the need to administer early treatment (within 48 h of admission) to be effective. 13 Most frequent influenza infection complication is pneumonia, yet in this season five influenza encephalitis were registered among adult SHLCI patients. Acute encephalopathy syndromes as a complication of influenza infection has been previously described by other authors in children and adults, but our observation in unvaccinated adult population with risk factors to develop influenza complications underscores the need for higher vaccination coverage in at risk population despite age. [14] [15] [16] There are some limitations to be taken into account, such as the fact that the total hospitalization burden including non-severe hospital admitted cases with laboratory confirmed influenza is not included. This data would be desirable to be included in influenza surveillance in order to have a broader assessment of influenza burden of disease in the population and in turn have a more exhaustive treatment and vaccine effectiveness estimation.",
