Lack of vaccine safety will dramatically affect the public trust in vaccines for flaviviruses and other diseases, as shown by the recent measles outbreak affecting thousands of unvaccinated children in the Philippines, after the risks of CYD-TDV dengue vaccine became apparent. 11 Vaccines are extremely safe and have saved millions of lives. The problems associated with the dengue vaccine CYD-TDV are therefore an unfortunate event. As a result, new tests are urgently needed to determine flavivirus serological status, ideally suitable for point-of-care testing to allow approaches that pair screening with vaccination. 12 However, the complexity of flaviviral immune interplay might require determination of other flaviviruses besides dengue, and at the very least semi-quantitative techniques including innovative tools for test interpretation that are currently entirely unavailable for point-of-care testing.",

Countries prepare in different ways based on their interpretation of disease risks and international agreements such as the International Health Regulations (IHR). The IHR were introduced in 1969 to prevent spread of specific serious diseases between countries and set out preparedness measures at international borders to stop disease spread. The 2005 revisions to the IHR reflect changes across multiple dimensions, requiring countries to develop preparedness capacities to detect and respond to outbreaks where and when they occur, supported by international partners to respond when outbreaks cannot be contained locally. 5 However, disruptive factors have emerged at a greater pace over the past decade, creating a new ecology that requires novel strategies for preparedness. These factors include dealing with the increasing human population density and connectivity, harnessing novel data streams and new technological advances to manage epidemics, mitigating false information on social networks, to creating informal technical networks that can work together when political forces fail to do so.",

These outbreaks show that countries are at various stages of preparedness, and many have underdeveloped preparedness plans and response capabilities with weak or non-existent strategies to mitigate disruptive factors. 6, 7 Many countries face severe difficulties in providing universal health coverage, for example, and might overlook timely investments for threats that demand greater health-care facility or workforce requirements. 8, 9 Other challenges include shifts in within-country and between-country cooperation, the evolving need for transdisciplinary, cross-sectoral approaches and social participation, 2, 3, 8, 9 and effective leadership, coordination, and financing of local national and international partners. 10 Against this backdrop, the Lancet Infectious Diseases Commission on Preparedness for Emerging Epidemic Threats was formed in mid-2019 to examine the importance of this new ecology and its disruptive factors that have resulted in an underprepared world, whether current planning assumptions still hold, and what mitigation measures need to be introduced.",
