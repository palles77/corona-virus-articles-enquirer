Our proposed gating mechanism does not fit in the group of standard models, since it does not have the S4 TM helix providing the gating current by a large scale movement with its putatively positive arginines. We show that the arginines need not always be charged in the membrane context; a proton from the arginine can transfer to a neighboring glutamate. This is one step in a proton current that would be detected as gating current, although the total charge displacement is actually the gating current, and is not limited to movement of specific charged entities. No such proton transfer is contemplated in any standard model. We provide quantum calculations as part of the evidence to support this proton transfer. The VSDs for the various channels that belong to this family are not all alike. The H v 1 channel is, in its entirety, a close analog of the VSD; it is a proton channel. Its structure, to a reasonable approximation, is that of a dimer of a VSD of a potassium channel, especially at the extracellular end.

The cysteine side chain, if ionized, consisted of one negatively charged sulfur atom that could react with methanethiosulfonate (MTS) reagents; the unionized -SH side chain could not react, and this fact is crucial to interpretation of the results.

It was found that the reactive arginines appeared to shift with the voltage in approximately the way that might have been expected if the S4 had moved. If the MTS reagent were applied from the extracellular side, more cysteines reacted when the voltage was off, while intracellular MTS was more likely to react at negative voltage, when S4 should be at the intracellular side to close the channel.

However, before this interpretation can be accepted, we note that the side chain of arginine is more than twice the volume of the full cysteine side chain(26) (see Fig. 2 ), and this is not counting the decrease in volume of cysteine upon ionization. The entire cysteine side chain is an S and an H, so ionization leaving only S makes a significant difference. The difference in volume from arginine (depending somewhat on the definition of the volume) is roughly 75 \u0226 3 . This is enough for the head group of the MTS reagent, if the cysteine does not need to go to the surface to ionize. This difference is also about the volume of 2-3 water molecules. If some water enters the cavity which is left by the mutation, ionization can occur in situ, so that a central assumption of the method is not necessarily supported in this system; local changes in side chain rotation would be enough to account for the results.",

Again, there are difficulties with this type of measurement. These have been discussed in the literature, and major efforts to overcome these difficulties have been made. However, side chain rotations, loss of salt bridges, and, for that matter, proton transfers, would affect the results, so that the error limits on these measurements must be considered to be comparable to the distances measured. As these errors are well known, we . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license is made available under a The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. It . https://doi.org/10.1101/371914 doi: bioRxiv preprint will not discuss them. LRET is somewhat better than standard FRET, but does not overcome the local structural effects of mutation. Undoubtedly there is value to these measurements, but they do not necessarily lead to high resolution results. The measurements are made on a mutant channel, which may be a few Angstroms different in spacing from the wild type, a problem for a measurement of distances in which 3 \u00c5 is a major difference. This said there is evidence from these experiments that does not necessarily fit with the standard models. Posson et al found a vertical movement of only 2 \u00c5 for S4 (35) ; they proposed a model in which the electric field was refocused in such a way as to produce a gating charge of 13e, in accord with the measured value for the Shaker channel. Part of the reason this could be done was that it was shown, by use of a solvatochromic dye, that the field was very large at the location of a single arginine residue (36) . Related data showing that the motion of S4 was very limited was added by a series of LRET measurements by Chanda et al (32) . Slightly earlier work by Cha et al also led to the same conclusion (37) . There are additional problems with assigning gating current, as its exact value is something of a problem. Ishida et al measured the gating current for a channel that was supposed to be very similar, K v 1.2, and found a gating charge of only 10e (38) ; based on mutation experiments, they concluded that the gating current was produced by a different mechanism from that of Shaker. There are multiple states through which the channel passes on its way to opening (21) ; essentially all models require multiple states, and this is consistent with the measured kinetics, although not all results lead to exactly the same number of states In addition to experiments, molecular dynamics (MD) calculations have been used as further evidence for the standard models. MD calculations use classical force fields; these force fields include electrostatic terms, as well as kinetic energy, and empirical force terms that should, in principle, account for all other energy terms (van der Waals, torsion, etc.) However, quantum calculations seem to be required because the exchange and correlation energy terms, which have no classical analogues, have differences between similar positions of protons or side chains of the order of 10k B T, so cannot be ignored. Proton shifts are not possible with MD, nor is charge transfer. Seemingly symmetric atoms also do not have the charge symmetry that is typically assumed, e.g., the amines (NH1 and NH2 in the pdb notation) that are part of the guanidinium ion; these effects are small on a percentage basis, but, leading to energy differences larger than k B T, would lead to differences in structure that cannot be taken into account in a strictly classical computation. Even including Drude polarizability (39) does not cure this problem. There is no way to compare the classical energy to the QM energy, as the Coulomb and the kinetic energy terms are computed on a different basis. There is further discussion below, in the section on Computational Methods, where the differences between classical and quantum calculations are also discussed.",

H v 1 is a proton channel, but the extracellular section, more than half the channel, is very similar to the VSD (46) (47) (48) (49) (50) (51) . The intracellular part of the K v 1.2 VSD differs from the corresponding section of the H v 1 channel, as the path that the protons must follow is different in the two cases for that section of the channel. In K v 1 the proton must continue on to the gate of the channel, moving parallel to the membrane, while in H v 1 the proton goes directly through the membrane to be removed from the cell. However, the similarity of the two types of channels is a strong indication that the structure of the VSD is also suitable for transmitting protons. Mony et al used fluorescence methods to suggest a role for the S1 TM helix in H v 1 proton transport, and thus in forming a proton channel in K v channels, by analogy; they interpreted the proton motion as being independent of gating(52); Goldshen-Ohm and Chanda noted this as an interesting result, but pointed out that the evidence was not conclusive (53) (they did not suggest any connection between proton current and gating, rather that the role of S1 was not conclusive).",

It has also been shown that mutating the amino acid next to the arginine to histidine does not produce a proton current; the proton is not simply carried across the end of the segment by the histidine moving up or down; if the histidine moved, one would expect such a mutation to provide a current comparable to that of the arginine mutation. The fact that it does not supports the idea that S4 does not move, but the protons do. Much more recently, Zhao and Blunck(57) have shown that the VSD can transport protons (and, to a limited extent, some other cations). Therefore, the idea that protons move through the VSD is not controversial, although the idea that this has to do with gating is. How it is possible to account for the motion of protons in response to voltage while having additional charges move to provide the gating current, in standard models, is not entirely clear. Somehow, the protons would have to not contribute to gating current even when they move.",

            "text": "2) In a related channel which a K + channel controls a phosphatase enzyme, belonging to the parasite Ciona intestinalis, the Ci-VSP channel, R\uf0e0H mutations allowed proton transport completely through the section closely analogous to the VSD of K channels. This appears similar to the Shaker case, where Starace and Bezanilla used an R\uf0e0H mutation (58) to produce a proton channel from the VSD, the case just discussed. Villalba-Galea et al have discussed the Ci-VSP channel in some detail (59) , as have Sakata et al (60) . If two residues interact, this provides important information as to mechanism. One method of determining whether there is interaction or not is to put spin labels on two locations where interactions are thought to occur, one can find whether the electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectrum of one label is perturbed by another, which implies that the two labels are relatively close to each other. This may change with gating, suggesting that there may have been motion by the labels. The technique is subject to the usual problems of having a large foreign residue inside the VSD. Displacement of the native residues by the probe, as the probe is large, is a consideration. The difference in the way the probe rotates as the channel gates is another. These are problems similar to FRET, with its large probe. The technique was described by Perozo et al in 2002 (61, 62) . There have been a number of applications, especially, but not exclusively, to ligand gated channels (63, 64) . However, Li et al studied the VSD associated with the Ci-VSP, using both X-ray and EPR (65) ; here the VSD is fairly much like that of the potassium .

This channel is almost unique among K + channels in that much greater depolarization, actually inverse polarization, is required to open them. They are still closed at 0 mV, which makes it possible to get a closed conformation without applying a voltage. These authors concluded, by comparing the structures at 0 mV (closed) and +100mV (open) that the motion of S4 was about 5 \u00c5, which they associated with a \"one-click\" translation (meaning an arginine moved to the position of the next salt bridge to close the channel). EPR gave both dynamic and structural information. Of course, the spin probe that was attached was larger than 5 \u00c5, so a smaller motion is plausible, as is a larger motion. This channel may also not be the same as the standard channels, as can be told from the fact that it is closed at 0 mV, and some of the studies are on an R\uf0e0E mutant. Research is continuing on this channel.",

Of the latter cases, some have water, unlike the VSD amino acid triad that can transmit a proton without water. (74) showed that S3, which has negative charges, appears to move in the same direction as S4 when the standard cysteine mutation plus MTS experiment is done; this would indicate that this experiment measures in situ availability of the residues, but the authors found an explanation consistent with the standard model. The possible motion looks a little like the MacKinnon paddle model in which half of S3 moves together with S4(75, 76); a number of objections have been raised to this model, and it would take too long to discuss them all here; this model at present does not seem to be a probable candidate for gating. 5) Naranjo and coworkers found that making a mutation of either sign(77) appears to have the same effect on gating charge; if S4 moves outward to open the channel, a positive (base) mutation should add to gating charge, while an acid, if ionized, hence negative, should subtract, but both subtracted. If S4 motion has nothing to do with gating current, this is easily understandable, but the authors found an interpretation that appeared consistent with the standard models; it is less clear that the interpretation was consistent with other experiments in which S4 would have to make somewhat different motions.

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/371914 doi: bioRxiv preprint 6) It has been shown that the first step in gating is a very small and very fast component of gating current (about 1% of gating current, and faster than the RC time constant of the membrane, hence too fast to measure, <2\u00b5s rise time), the \"piquito\" (78, 79) . For a standard model interpretation one must assume that it is some sort of side chain rearrangement in an energy landscape; however, the nature of this energy landscape remains to be fully defined (80) . An alternate interpretation is as a first step in a proton cascade, in which a proton tunnels to a neighboring residue, with the voltage change making this possible by matching energy levels. Such a component of gating current makes little sense in the standard models.",

However, if the threshold is distributed as an nearly Gaussian curve of width approximately k B T, then one gets a very similar curve (83) .

The threshold discussed by Green, however, turns out to be consistent with this experiment (83) . 8 ) In addition to these results, some LRET and FRET experiments discussed previously suggest a small vertical movement, smaller than the standard model seems to require (32, 35, 37) . Although not all such experiments lead to small apparent movement, the fact that some do suggests using care in interpreting all the results. Small movements would allow the gating current to exist if the field dropped across only a very small distance (although even then some care in setting up the model is required).(36) 9) In a standard model, at least in some versions, the first arginine does not contribute to gating current.",

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/371914 doi: bioRxiv preprint lipids are needed (86, 87) . Furthermore, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP 2 ) is needed to have a functioning channel (88) (89) (90) , and this adds negative charges. While evidence that PIP2 is involved in complexing arginine in channels has not been reported (yet), this would be consistent with the existence of phosphate-arginine complexes; so far a complete proof awaits further evidence. However, calculations (91, 92) and experiment (93, 94) both show that guanidinium and phosphate form complexes that are fairly stable. Therefore, the end arginine, which reaches into the headgroup region, would be complexed with phosphate, with high probability. It would be necessary to release this complex if the S4 were to move as a rigid body, or nearly so. With the first arginine anchored in the membrane, there remains the possibility that S4 could break. With a fraction moving down, while the extracellular section remains in place, the broken helix would have to re-form thousands of times with no mistakes at all, such as returning to a local minimum with a different set of hydrogen bonds and salt bridges; returning so many times without error seems very implausible. The reason the S4 helix would have to re-form without error thousands of times can be understood as follows: consider that the channel must open and close more than once per second in many nerve cells, some of which fire at rates of 50 Hz. Let us assume 10 Hz to be conservative. A minimum lifetime for the channel might be 10 minutes; even this is expensive, in terms of the energy the cell must expend, if the protein must be resynthesized that often, but let us say 10 minutes. Then the channel must open and close completely accurately 6000 times in its lifetime, and with four transmembrane domains, that means a total of 24,000 openings and closings before the protein is replaced. If the S4 really must re-fold exactly correctly that many times, it must somehow use the rest of the VSD as a chaperonin, something for which there is no evidence, nor does it seem clear how it could be possible. This supports the idea that S4 does not unfold. However, if it does not, then there must be some way for the first arginine to get out of the headgroup layer, something that also seems extremely unlikely.",

Papers on Na v channels in this context are just different enough that they would require a separate discussion, and there are fewer such papers. The question of which residues to study requires a model of which residues are of interest, as it is obviously not possible to study all possible pairs in a channel. Sadovsky and YIfrach (105) , considered a three residue interaction. In addition, there is the possibility that the pair of residues studied may affect other residues so as to alter the local environment, making the interaction indirect.",

The nature of the interaction may involve small conformational changes (side chain shifts, for example, even if the S4 backbone remains stationary) as well as electrostatic interactions, and rearrangements of hydrogen bonding, in addition to proton transfers. The triad that we discuss later shows how interactions may be complex, and the triad does not exist in isolation; if a proton is transferred, it would have to proceed through more residues. Our triad is linked through one member to another triad, or the two groups could be thought of as one pentad, with the five amino acids as a single entity acting to transfer a proton.",

Calculations have been done for the gating mechanism, or the response to a change in voltage, as well as inactivation, selectivity, and conduction. There are essentially electrostatic physical models of ion permeation through the pore, largely proposed by Eisenberg and coworkers (120) (121) (122) (123) ; these tend to use a simplified model of the channel, in which many of the specific interactions are omitted, or lumped into a smaller number of parameters; it is interesting that electrostatics can account for so much of the description of ion permeation. That said, it still will not be sufficient for the explicit description of the interactions involved in ion transport, nor is that the intended purpose of such an essentially macroscopic view. There are also much more detailed, atom level approaches. The various advantages, or difficulties, of different methods vary for the different possible systems that need to be calculated.",

            "text": "The most common calculation technique is molecular dynamics (MD). MD has some significant advantages: it is possible to use over 100,000 atoms, thus including lipids and hydration, and to run the simulation for times up to the microsecond range, approaching times of biological relevance. There is little doubt this will improve as computers become more powerful. Woelke et al considered the proton transfer in cytochrome c that is analogous to the channels we are discussing here (68) . Examples of calculations on ion channels with particular relevance to gating include Delemotte et al, Deyawe et al, and Tronin et al (125) (126) (127) . The latter does not agree with the first two. Jensen et al have carried out some extremely large simulations of gating (128, 129) . Sansom and coworkers have used MD for several aspects of channel properties (130) (131) (132) . While MD has been used extensively, it has significant disadvantages. One problem with MD simulations of gating is that they have not as yet been shown to return to the original state upon release of the voltage-only steered MD appears to have been tried, and that is not a proof that the system as modeled in the MD simulation is capable of returning and repeating the cycle. This is critical; If any calculation fails to show how the VSD can return to its closed state accurately multiple times, the calculation cannot be entirely valid; above, we gave 24,000 cycles per channel protein lifetime as a conservative estimate. It is not clear how the MD simulations could return correctly even once, given the large numbers of salt bridges and hydrogen bonds that must break and reform exactly correctly each cycle, in the versions we are aware of; no MD simulation to date has . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license is made available under a The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. It . https://doi.org/10.1101/371914 doi: bioRxiv preprint shown the VSD as maintaining its structure while going through even one complete gating cycle; also, some seem to require fields an order of magnitude larger than physiological to force some motion; with realistic voltages S4 does not move. Large conformational transitions are not impossible for proteins, as in enzymes with large hinge motions that do not disrupt secondary structure. Unlike most enzymes, the motions proposed in the standard models for channels are not hinge motions, involving a single bond generally moving as a rotation, or at the most two or three, but motions that require a major rearrangement of the internal structure of the protein, including the secondary structure in many versions. Conformational changes in enzymes do not often require rebuilding secondary structure. It is even harder to see how mutant channels would allow a consistent calculation, as they would have a different set of salt bridges and hydrogen bonds, which presumably would provide a different refolding problem. None of these problems arise if the backbone is stable, and only side chain motions are possible. Yet another problem is that MD calculations are unable to deal with charge transfer in most cases; as the configuration changes, and interatomic distance changes, there will be non-negligible changes (up to perhaps 0.1e) on local charges, causing changes in polarization that in turn lead to discrepancies from the charges used by the force field, if the force field is fixed (not polarizable). Using Drude polarization (39, 133) helps, but does not deal with much of the rest of the problems; in addition it slows the calculation so that some of the advantage of MD calculation is lost. Another consequence of charge transfer is the change in electric field and potential in the neighborhood of the transferred charge, which again cannot be accounted for in an MD simulation in which charge does not transfer. In spite of the multiple MD simulations of gating, there is still no definitive model; the MD simulations cited above show different kinds of motion.",

There are disadvantages as well for QM calculations. To begin with, there are no dynamics. Second, the number of atoms is limited; until recently, only a small section of the channel could be calculated, but as computers become more powerful, the section that can be calculated is, as of 2018, in the neighborhood of 1000 atoms with a high performance cluster, and a fair amount of patience.

QM also produces static local energy minima, corresponding to 0 K structures; one does not get a global minimum. These structures are relevant however; the most common experimental method of getting an ion channel structure has been X-ray diffraction, which is done at temperatures below 220 K, the lowest temperature phase transition for water. The X-ray structures should therefore essentially be the same as those at 0 K. Since the X-ray structures have proven to be essentially correct, the QM structures should be also. One can test for which local minima are correct, as a function of voltage, the relevant parameter in gating, by doing multiple optimizations, starting from different initial configurations, getting multiple local minima, which should include all that are relevant. For example, one may start with different states of ionization of the acids and bases (i.e., proton positions). If there is a local minimum so that the proton does not shift, the energy of that local minimum can be compared with the local minimum found in which a proton does shift. In other words, with other ionization states of the acids and bases. If all the relevant structures are determined, the lowest energy can be found for each of several voltages. Although this is time consuming, it is not so much so as to be impractical, as computers have become sufficiently powerful (134) .",

Another possibility is to use ONIOM, which allows three different levels of calculation, including different levels of QM calculation (135) . As we have discussed, there are difficulties for each method. We have already considered MD and QM. QM/MM requires that a boundary be introduced, with the bonds normally broken and sealed with H atoms. This leaves the potentials nearby somewhat inaccurate, and if the idea is to limit the QM region to simplify and speed the calculation, the QM region should not be large, so the boundary is a problem. Still this allows inclusion of many more atoms than pure QM, as the MM calculations are much faster.

When the ring is complete, the energy drops sharply. On further study of the system, the behavior is most easily understandable as a resonance hybrid structure, as referred to briefly above (117) . The fact that there is a small resonance structure that could stabilize a more complex system suggests care must be taken in trying to understand a structure of protein that contains water.

In addition, it is well known to be part of a system for transmitting protons, albeit most often in the form of a water wire. In addition, it is known that D 2 O makes a difference to gating, slowing it down, at least in Na + channels (143) (144) (145) ; it is reasonable to assume that in this respect Na + and K + channels are similar. The effect appears in the last step of gating (146) , which agrees with what we would require in this model. The proton transport chain begins in the VSD TM section, which senses the field. Starting from the closed configuration, it responds by sending a proton cascade in the extracellular direction, pulling protons from the gate region via a path that involves water along the intracellular surface. Thus the first steps are in the transmembrane section, and the final steps involve the gate. The final steps being those affected by water in this model, it is consistent with the experimental D 2 O results. The idea that water could play a key role in gating was the first suggestion in our work (147) , which considered the possibility of an electrorheological effect, in which the water became relatively rigid in the presence of a strong electric field. Whether an electrorheological effect exists at the gate is still to be determined. The field that polarizes the membrane almost certainly does not affect the intracellular water directly, but the motion of protons may change the field sufficiently at the intracellular surface that this water too responds to the field, albeit indirectly, as a consequence of the motion of protons; only protons and side chains move in direct response to the polarization/depolarization of the membrane.",

However, almost all the degrees of freedom are likely to be unchanged. While the total thermal energy will correspond to well over a thousand kT (there are 976 atoms, so that there should be, in total, 2922 vibrational degrees of freedom), the differences should only affect a small number of these. Almost the entire system is unchanged with a local proton transfer. The differences in the energy of the minima will surely be less than the activation energy, amounting to about 20 -25 k B T, for the step we have calculated in the most detail. However, even the very small number of affected degrees of freedom, say n, are not going to make a difference of as much as nk B T since these will be very similar in the two forms of the VSD (if the vibrations are fully excited, we should see a difference of 3k B T for each mode from the value with the mode fully unexcited). To see a difference, the modes would have to be partially excited to different degrees, which requires that they have vibration frequencies that would be in the range of k B T/h (h = Planck's constant), about 6 x 10 12 Hz at room temperature. This frequency range would apply to relatively long wave vibrations, covering much more than local modes; these are the modes which should not change with a proton shift. Higher frequency local modes differ, but these modes have energy sufficiently above k B T as to be not excited at room temperature. Therefore, it should be possible to trust the differences in energy-the errors must cancel in the differences, not only in the 0 K minima, but also in the room temperature results. The latter may add 1 -2 k B T to the relative error, but a \u00b14 k B T error is not enough to change conclusions that are based on energy changes that are appreciably larger, by at least a factor of 4. In other words, the protein is large enough with its 2922 vibrations that it should behave somewhat as a solid, or at least a glass; therefore, many of the modes are, as in a solid, long .

We are saying that it would differ by essentially the same amount for each case that we studied. However, there is no question that further work is needed to fully confirm this. These considerations of degrees of freedom, and water structure vs. protein structure, are, so far, essentially qualitative arguments. A quantitative estimate of the energy difference will have to await further advances in computer capacity. Estimating free energy and other temperature dependent properties from the harmonic oscillator approximation is unlikely to be better than the qualitative estimates, as the VSD is too complex for the harmonic oscillator approximation to be any more accurate than the considerations above; mode coupling is likely to be extensive, and the spectrum of frequencies not simply Debye like, although that would be a zeroth approximation, although probably not all the way to room temperature. The modes are not a sum of independent local modes.",

The minima are local minima; they show proton positions that are steps in the path that the protons take, and are metastable. There is no relevant global energy minimum. If the system fell into such a minimum, it is hard to see how it could go forward. There appears to be no way for the system to reach such a minimum, however; also, during gating the voltage keeps changing, so the states are necessarily transient; if they were not, there could be no proton current. We can in principle estimate the lifetime from the activation energy that it would take to get from one state to another, but we cannot yet get enough states to fix all the activation .

The apparent activation energy of the system fits reasonably well with the results to date. PRESSURE: There are pressure sensitive channels (e.g., MscS, MscL) that are stretch activated. However, for the channels we are considering here, relatively little work has been done on pressure effects. More has been done on sodium than potassium channels, but in all probability the effects should be quite similar. Heinemann et al found hydrostatic pressure slowed gating, with an activation volume of 33, and then 39, \u00c5 3 for two cases (148) . There has been more work on osmotic pressure, which might be expected to behave quite differently, as hydrostatic pressure increases the free energy of the water, while the water free energy drops in case of hyperosmolarity.

We have already discussed the fact that what we get is the energy minimum, which corresponds to 0 K. We noted this does have one advantage, in that it allows comparison with Xray structures that are determined at temperatures below the lowest phase transition of water, and are thus presumably not very different from the 0 K structures. Cryo EM structures are of course also determined at low temperature.

It appears that mutating this to a phenylalanine must interrupt this path, and make it more difficult to open the channel. The experiment has been carried out by Dr. Carlos Bassetto and Professor Francisco Bezanilla, and it showed approximately a 1.7 fold drop in slope of the gating current -voltage curve, showing that eliminating the possibility of ionizing this residue did interfere with gating, as predicted. In the standard models, one might expect, if anything, that given the slightly smaller volume of phenylalanine, a Y266F mutation might increase the probability of gating, rather than decreasing it, because it would be easier for S4 to slide up. Since the E226 path remains, the channel still functions, but not as well. This evidence supports the model we propose, and tends to refute the standard model. There must be a gating charge, so that there must be a shift in the center of charge. For the 976 atom case, we used NBO to find the charges on all the atoms. Then, by dividing the system into 11 3 \u00c5 slices, and adding all the charges on the atoms in each slice, we determined the center of charge in the two cases of low energy (-70 mV, Y266=R300=E183=0 nominal charge, 0 mV Y266 negative, R300 positive, E183 zero nominal charge). For the -70 mV case, the center of charge was at 19.6 \u00c5, for the 0 mV case, at 8.3 \u00c5, for a shift of 11.3 \u00c5. This is very nearly just what it should be, but it must be taken with caution, as the error bar on this value may be several Angstroms. The total charge on the system is always +2.",

Oliver and Deamer showed increased H + permeability through a membrane with a group of alpha helices of hydrophobic residues (165) , analogous to what we postulate here. Beyond the section that we have already calculated, we must show how a proton cascade can reach the gate, if the gate opens as a consequence of deprotonation, or closes with protonation. In Fig.   8 the path for protons that proceeds from the section we have calculated through an intracellular path to the gate includes T1, which, as noted earlier, has been shown to be involved in gating. This part of the path does involve water. The calculated section is voltage dependent, while this intracellular section is expected to have little direct voltage dependence, although it would shift protons depending on the state of the channel because of the change in protonation of the residues above it, which do respond to voltage shifts, in a sort of domino cascade. As the voltage sensitive protons shift, they pull/push the next members of the cascade. THE STRUCTURE OF THE GATE: Finally, when we get to the gate itself, we observe that essentially all models assume that there is an increase in the diameter of the gate to admit K + ions. There is debate as to the size of the opening, or the extent of the opening compared to the closed conformation; a quite small increase in diameter would be adequate, of the order of about 4 \u00c5(166), meaning a 2 \u00c5 displacement per VSD.",

We have done a limited calculation of the interaction potential that suggests that the water so substantially reduces the interaction energy between an ion at the gate and the cavity ion that, as long as the ion at the gate stays at the gate, the repulsion energy is almost zero. However, the ion then cannot advance, or displace the water or the ion in the cavity. Therefore, we proposed that the gate would have to oscillate, complexing and holding the incoming ion, which then cannot be knocked back, so that the ion in the cavity would proceed to the bottom state of the selectivity filter, given a little time, once the bottom state of the selectivity filter becomes available. Once the cavity cleared, the ion at the gate could move into the cavity, not so much having pushed the previous ion forward, as having simply allowed it to move, and then replaced it. The cycle is indicated in Fig. 9 , reproduced from (40) . This implies that the gate can complex K + well enough to force the ion in the cavity to move up, or at least allow it to move up. The complex must not be so tight that, once the cavity becomes available, it cannot release the K + ; the cavity location is then of lower energy than the solution, so that the ion moves into the cavity rather than back to solution, and the current continues. Here it is interesting to compare the KcsA closed structure to the K v 1.2 open structure, for both of which X-ray structures exist.

A calculation of the pore region, with a total of 50 water molecules in a total of 870 atoms showed that there was no difference in the N-N distance with a K + at the gate, but about three more water molecules clustered there, for a total of thirteen, compared to about ten when the ion was just below the selectivity filter.",

If we compare the need for a barrier to the steps for an oscillating gate, the most obvious step to have the barrier is a\uf0e0b in Fig. 9 . Here an ion from solution must enter the gate, bring the gate, with its water, to the position that complexes the ion, and rearrange the water in the cavity. Thus the model is consistent with the data; since the free energy gradient should affect an ion at the gate, but not further up the pore, the concentration dependence seems to require that that the barrier demonstrated by Fig. 3 be at the intracellular end of the pore.",

Q 10 is defined for gating as the change in open probability over 10 o C, and for conductivity the change in conductivity over 10 O C; for an open probability that follows Arrhenius behavior this can be translated into an activation energy. For potassium channels conductivity Q 10 values in the range of 1.5 to 1.9 are found(95). For a proton channel, the values vary from 2.2 (10 o C) to 1.3 (40 o C), suggesting the existence of different rate limiting steps for transport at low and high temperature(96) (activation energy of roughly 50 kJ (low temperature) vs 20 kJ (high temperature. A Q 10 of 1.7 from 290K to 300K corresponds to 40kJ, or about 16 k B T. Temperature dependence has been studied by other methods, and with varying results. Rodriguez et al showed that there are several different regimes with varying amounts of charge transmitted, and Q 10 values that were <2 in some regions, and \u22483 at higher temperatures(97). Gating has a larger Q 10 . Chowdhury and Chanda found several steps with Q 10 values for gating current that gave an overall activation free energy of 58 kJ mol -1 (98). Different steps have different Q 10 values (hence, different activation energy). The temperature dependence of gating is larger than that for conduction. Rodriguez et al found an activation energy of about 100-110 kJ(99) for gating.",

However, the change in gating current found by Rayner et al(150) for sodium channels with osmotic pressure, while in agreement to within a factor of 2 with the solvent inaccessible volume found for potassium channels, found a limited effect on the voltage response of sodium channels. They proposed a model in which there was very weak coupling between the solvent sensitive and voltage sensitive mechanisms of gating, with coupling of the order of 0.1 k b T sufficient to account for their data. This does not appear compatible with the large motions suggested for S4 in standard gating models. The order of 10 3 \u00c5 3 volume that becomes accessible to solvent on channel opening, from the Zimmerberg et al result, corresponds to roughly a 10 \u00c5 diameter sphere. This would be consistent with the pore, mainly cavity, volume, becoming accessible. However, there is no direct evidence on this point. The weak coupling with the voltage response is compatible with very limited change in solvent accessibility in the VSD. It is difficult to see how a major allosteric rearrangement of the VSD could fail to have a much larger effect on the solvent access; it is even more difficult to understand the weak coupling of solvent to voltage effect if the VSD were involved in making volume changes on change in osmolarity. If a large section of the VSD were to become available extracellularly on gating, a coupling of at least one hydrogen bond energy, hence >k B T, would be expected. The Rayner et al result is compatible with the VSD remaining largely unchanged in structure upon gating; it may be consistent with the pore becoming available.TOXINS: A number of toxins, e.g. particular toxins from specific snails(151)(152)(153), scorpions(154)(155)(156)(157)(158), and spiders(159)(160)(161), interact with voltage gated ion channels, sometimes with an extracellular loop of the VSD, or else possibly near the membrane interface.

None of the triad of amino acids in the calculated section of the VSD was near the border of the 976 atom section, so that calculation errors from borders should be very small. It turns out that the tyrosine is capable of ionizing, transferring a proton to the NE of R300 (using the pdb notation, this is the nitrogen on the side chain before the guanidinium; the amine nitrogens on the guanidinium arelabeled NH1, NH2). The proton positions calculated include the standard arginine positive, glutamate negative, tyrosine neutral configuration (which is not the low energy configuration whether polarized or depolarized), as well as exchanges of the proton that made the arginine and glutamate neutral (membrane polarized, i.e., closed conformation), or the tyrosine negative, with its protein transferred to glutamate (neutral) with arginine positive (open, depolarized). By using the NE nitrogen as a second base (or acid, when protonated), the arginine side chain becomes amphoteric. No other amino acid has a side chain with this property. Voltages in the calculations ranged from -70 mV (i.e., intracellular negative, channel presumably closed) to +70 mV (with -35 mV, 0 mV, and +35 mV also included). The energy of the crossing point at about -20 mV was about 24 k B T (60 kJ) above the polarized (closed) minimum. Thus the minimum conformations are: when closed (-70 mV): Y266(-), R300(+), E183(0); open (0 mV): Y266(0. 6A: Comparison of VSD (top) and bacteriorhodopsin (bottom) triads of tyrosine, arginine, and glutamate; both are from the X-ray structures, not computation. Some interatomic distances are shown, and are very similar; e.g., the arginine nitrogen to glutamate oxygen: 5.08 (VSD) vs 5.42 (BR). Three water molecules are present in the bacteriorhodopsin structure, with one very short distance (2.30 \u00c5) between water oxygens (oxygens are from the X-ray structure, hydrogens added), and only parts of side chains are shown. The distances are similar: especially the arginine nitrogen to glutamate, which is the same within experimental error. It is not difficult to see a proton path across the triads. Tyrosine, arginine and glutamate are on the VSD: Y415,R419,E136; on bacteriorhodopsin (pdb: 1P8H) Y57,R82,E194. This illustrates that there are several triads, as this is not the triad discussed earlier, but a different set on the the gate. The orientations are not identical, and the water in the bacteriorhodopsin makes up the difference. Fig. 6B: A second triad, comparing K v 1.2 to H v 1, this one RER/RDR instead of YRE. Left: H v 1: R201 (top), D108,R204 (pdb:3WKV); right the VSD of the K v 1.2 channel (3Lut); R300(top), E226, R303. H v 1 uses the NE nitrogen of R201 (top). As in Fig. 6A the distances of the triads are very similar. The use of the arginine NE by H v 1 is an example of the use of the amphoteric property of this side chain to transmit a proton.",

SUMMARY: We have considered the evidence concerning voltage gating, principally of the K v 1.2 channel, but also considering analogous systems. We have reinterpreted results of multiple experiments and our own calculations to show that they do not provide convincing evidence of significant S4 motion as in the standard model, but can be understood as providing evidence for the motion of protons as gating current. Major points include: 1) There is a standard model in which gating current is provided by the motion perpendicular to the membrane of the S4 TM segment of the VSD, supported principally by: a) SCAM studies of this and related channels b) MD simulations c) FRET and LRET studies 2) We have offered an alternative interpretation in which the gating current is provided by proton motion. This is supported by: a) Quantum calculations showing how a proton can make a local transfer in the K v 1.2 channel VSD; this depends in part on the fact that the side chain of arginine is amphoteric, unlike the side chains of all other amino acids. The amphoteric nature of the arginine side chain is unique among natural amino acids. b) Extending these calculations to show that charge transfer is consistent with known gating charge.",
