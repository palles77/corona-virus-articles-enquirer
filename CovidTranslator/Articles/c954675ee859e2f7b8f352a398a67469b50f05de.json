[5] [6] [7] The fever clinic of Tongji hospital in Wuhan has been the center of this outbreak. During the early phase of this outbreak, a large number of patients poured into the fever clinic, which far exceeded the medical resources that the hospital could equip. The medical staff were obviously insufficient to cope with it, and were prone to a wide range of cross-infection between doctors and patients. Based on this situation many patients had to be quarantined at home due to objective reasons and could not receive effective medical guidance. Therefore, we developed a new treatment method based on the online-to-offline (O2O) business model 8 for close contact, suspected (currently known as clinical diagnosis) and confirmed patients that were under quarantine. We developed a medical observation scale according to the patients' first symptoms and new symptoms which can be filled out by the patients on their smartphones or computers. Our online multidisciplinary team (medicine, rehabilitation, psychology and nursing) can then provide guidance and advice for patients based on the subjective changes in their symptoms. This method ensures that the patients follow an orderly treatment-seeking strategy that begins from their home and extends to the community and finally to the hospital. Our strategy not only helps relief the problem of scarce medical resources and reduce unnecessary cross-infection in hospitals, but it also increases people's self-management ability and cooperation and encourages them to participate in health monitoring. In addition, in accordance with the guidelines of home care for isolation patients issued by WHO 9 , the infection of family members was not increased during the strict self-isolation at home in this study.",

We found that although the father became ill first, the daughter had much severe symptoms except chest tightness and dyspnea than her father during the early stage of the disease. However, while the daughter's symptoms gradually improved over time, the father's chest tightness, dyspnea and previously latent symptoms worsened. Interestingly, the imaging features of these two patients were different from their respective clinical manifestations. The CT results of the daughter showed marked progression, whereas those of the father indicated minimal change. At the time of manuscript submission, the CT results of the daughter have significantly improved, and her symptoms have already disappeared. The patient is currently waiting for her second nucleic acid test results and may be discharged if the results turn out negative. On the other hand, the father is still experiencing mild dyspnea with no significant absorption by CT and must continue to be hospitalized for treatment.",
