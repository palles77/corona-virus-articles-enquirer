Rapid detection of these viruses is crucial to inform implementation of appropriate control measures. The objective of our study is developing a simple, rapid and field applicable recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA)-nucleic acid lateral flow (NALF) immunoassay for detection of NDV and IBV. Isothermal amplification of the matrix protein (M) gene of NDV and the nucleoprotein (N) gene of IBV was implemented via recombinase polymerase amplification at 38 \u00b0C for 40 min and 20 min, respectively using modified labeled primers. NALF device used in this study utilizes antibodies for detection of labeled RPA amplicons. The results revealed that RPA-NALF immunoassays can detect both viruses after 40 min at 38 \u00b0C and only NDV after 20 min. The limit of detection (LOD) was 10 genomic copies/RPA reaction. The assays results on clinical samples collected from diseased chicken farms demonstrated a good performance in comparison with quantitative real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The assays established in this study can facilitate rapid, on-site molecular diagnosis of suspected cases of ND and IB viral infections as the results can be detected by the naked eye without the need for measuring fluorescence. Furthermore, the NALF device could be adapted to detect other infectious agents.",

These respiratory viruses can co-circulate in Egyptian chicken farms. Newcastle disease (ND) is a contagious disease causing a high mortality rate (70-100%) in avian species. NDV is a negative sense, single-stranded, monopartite RNA virus of the Avian Paramyxovirus type 1 (APMV-1). NDV strains have been categorized according to virulence as lentogenic, mesogenic, and velogenic strains. Velogenic strains are the most virulent, causing respiratory tract lesions as well as sever hemorrhagic lesions in the digestive tract (viscerotropic), and/or neurological signs (neurotropic). The lentogenic strains have low virulence and are common among domestic poultry [1, 2] .",

In contrast to PCR, it uses only one constant temperature. The amplification step depends first on a recombinase (UvsX and co-factor UvsY from T4 Enterobacteria phage) binding to specific primers followed by scanning the DNA for the complementary sequence. Once invasion of the strand is maintained by the single strand binding protein (T4 gp32), a primer extension is ensued via a strand displacing DNA polymerase (Staphylococcus aureus) [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] . Lateral flow immunoassays are currently widely used due to their simplicity, low cost, good specificity, rapid result, electricity-free operation and long shelf life, making them suitable for on-site pathogen detection particularly in developing countries [19] . RPA combined with lateral flow dipstick (LFD) detection of amplicons has been previously reported for H9 subtype of avian influenza virus detection in Central China and proved to be appropriate for field application [20] .",

This device utilizes antibodies against primer-tags (DIG, FAM, Biotin) and has been designed for lateral flow detection of amplified products (Fig. 1) . The device comprises a sample well, conjugate pad, nitrocellulose membrane and absorbent pad, which are collected together in a plastic container. NALF detection was performed separately for the NDV and IBV assays, using separate devices for each assay. Following RPA reaction, 5 \u03bcl of the amplification product was transferred into a 0.5 ml tube and mixed thoroughly with 70 \u03bcl of the PCRD extraction buffer and added to the sample well of a PCRD test cassette. Upon sample application, the carbon Biotin-conjugated antibodies were rehydrated and reacted with the tag/Biotinlabeled amplicons in the sample. The first line (L1) consisted of anti-DIG monoclonal antibodies for capturing DIG/Biotin labeled amplicons for the NDV assay. The second line (L2) contains anti-FAM monoclonal antibodies to capture FAM/ Biotin labeled amplicons for IBV assay. The excess carbons dots covered with Biotin antibodies flowed pass the two testlines and were fixed at the control line (C) to ensure that a PCRD test cassette operating correctly. The cassette was kept in a horizontal position, and the results were recorded after 5 min.",

At the conjugate pad, the carbon Biotin-conjugated antibodies bind to biotin on one end of the amplicons, and flows towards the test-lines, L1 and L2. L1 is lined with anti-DIG monoclonal antibodies to capture DIG/Biotin labeled amplicons for NDV assay. L2 is lined with anti-FAM monoclonal antibodies to capture FAM/ Biotin labeled amplicons for IBV assay. The excess carbon Biotin-conjugated antibodies are captured by anti-mouse antibodies at the control line (C)",
