[9, 10] . If the function g(I) is nonmonotone, that is, g(I) is increasing when I is small and decreasing when I is large (see Fig. 1 ), it can be used to interpret the ''psychological'' effect: for a very large number of infective individuals the infection force may decrease as the number of infective individuals increases, because in the presence of large number of infectives the population may tend to reduce the number of contacts per unit time. The recent epidemic outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) had such psychological effects on the general public (see [8] ), aggressive measures and policies, such as border screening, mask wearing, quarantine, isolation, etc. have been proved to be very effective ( [4, 13] ) in reducing the infective rate at the late stage of the SARS outbreak, even when the number of infective individuals were getting relatively larger. To model this phenomenon, we propose a incidence rate",

Notice that when a = 0, the nonmonotone incidence rate (1.5) becomes the bilinear incidence rate (1.2). The organization of this paper is as follows. In the next section, we present the model and derive the disease-free equilibrium and the endemic equilibrium. In Section 3 we carry out a qualitative analysis of the model. Stability conditions for the disease-free equilibrium and the endemic equilibrium are derived, respectively. A brief discussion and some numerical simulations are given in Section 4.",

The recent epidemic outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) had such psychological effects on the general public (see Leung et al. [8] , Gumel et al. [4] and Wang and Ruan [13] ).",

Interestingly, this model does not exhibit complicated dynamics as other epidemic models with other types of incidence rates reported in Liu et al. [10] , Derrick and van den Driessche [3] , Hethcote and Levin [6] , Hethcote and van den Driessche [7] , Ruan and Wang [12] , etc. In terms of the basic reproduction number R 0 = kb/(d(d + l)), our main results indicate that when R 0 < 1, the disease-free equilibrium is globally attractive (see Fig. 2 ). When R 0 > 1, the endemic equilibrium exists and is globally stable (see Fig. 3 ). Biologically, these indicate that when the proportionality (infection) constant (k) and/or the recruitment rate (b) is sufficiently large and removal rate (death rate (d) plus recovery rate (l)) is sufficiently small such that R 0 > 1, then the disease persists. On the other hand, if the proportionality (infection) constant (k) and/or the recruitment rate (b) is small enough and removal rate (death rate (d) plus recovery rate (l)) is large enough such that R 0 < 1, then the disease dies out. The aggressive control measures and policies, such as border screening, mask wearing, quarantine, isolation, etc., helped in reducing the infection rate and increasing the removal rate and in the eventual eradication of SARS (Gumel et al. [4] and Wang and Ruan [13] ).",
