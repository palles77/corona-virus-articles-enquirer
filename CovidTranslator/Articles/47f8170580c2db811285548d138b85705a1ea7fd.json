Protein kinase R (PK)R is an important protein in the host viral response; however, the role of PKR in CSFV infection remains unknown. This issue was addressed in the present study using the PK-15 swine kidney cell line. We found that CSFV infection increased the phosphorylation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor (eIF)2\u2423 and its kinase PKR. However, the expression of viral proteins continued to increase. Furthermore, PKR overexpression enhanced CSFV replication, while PKR inhibition resulted in reduced CSFV replication and an increase in interferon (IFN) induction. In addition, PKR was responsible for eIF2\u2423 phosphorylation in CSFV-infected cells. These results suggest that the activation of PKR during CSFV infection is beneficial to the virus. The virus is able to commandeer the host cell's translation machinery for viral protein synthesis while evading innate immune defenses.",

Viral detection by cell sensors initiates a cascade of events that induces the transcription of IFN and other cytokines, shuts down protein synthesis and induces cell death in the cell's first line of defense to limit viral replication. PKR protein is IFN-induced gene that is present in all vertebrates. It is activated by doublestranded RNA (dsRNA) which is often a by-product of virus replication. Recent studies have found that CSFV has evolved mechanisms to inhibit IFN production in infected cells, and preventing dsRNA-mediated apoptosis, which gives rise to long-term infections (Bauhofer et al., 2007; Ruggli et al., 2005 Ruggli et al., , 2009 Seago et al., 2007 Seago et al., , 2010 ; however, the role of PKR in CSFV infection has not been elucidated.",

However, it was not known whether PKR and eIF2\u2423 were activated in CSFV infection. The phosphorylation status of eIF2\u2423 and its kinase PKR during CSFV infection was assessed by infecting PK-15 cells with CSFV at various MOIs and analyzing cell extracts 24 hpi by Western blotting. The phosphorylation of eIF2\u2423 and PKR increased dosedependently (Fig. 1A, lanes 1 and 5) , and was detected as early as 24 hpi (Fig. 1B, lanes 1-6) upon CSFV infection (MOI = 1). CSFV NS3 protein level increased continuously upon eIF2\u2423 activation. To determine whether eIF2\u2423 and PKR activation was viral replicationdependent, cells were infected with UV-inactivated CSFV and eIF2\u2423 and PKR phosphorylation was assessed. In treated cells, eIF2\u2423 and PKR phosphorylation levels were close to the detection limit (Fig. 1A, lanes 6-10) .

After testing different concentrations of 2-AP in CSFVinfected cells, it was found that the level of PKR and eIF2\u2423 phosphorylation was lowest at 10 mM (Fig. 4A) . To determine whether the pharmacological alteration of PKR activation by 2-AP affected the cell viability, evaluated the effects of 2-AP on cell viability with CCK-8 assay. Statistical analyses revealed no significant effects on the viability of cells treated with 10 mM 2-AP (P > 0.05) (Fig. S1A ). This concentration was therefore used in subsequent experiments. Compared to untreated cells, NS5A expression level and CSFV titer were decreased in drug-treated cells (Fig. 4B) . Furthermore, NS5A and NS3 protein and CSFV RNA expression were both reduced upon PKR inhibition combined with 2 g poly(I:C) treatment ( Fig. 4C and  D) . These results suggest that PKR activation promotes CSFV replication.

Down-regulation of PKR increases IFN-\u2424 induction.

When the \u2423 subunit of the eIF2 is phosphorylated, eIF2-GDP does not recycle to eIF2-GTP and cellular translation is inhibited (Pestova et al., 2008; Sarnow, 2003) . To overcome the inhibitory effects of eIF2\u2423 phosphorylation, viruses either inhibit the activation of the eIF2\u2423 kinases, e.g., adenovirus and hepatitis C virus (Gale et al., 1998; Schneider et al., 1985) , or enhance the dephosphorylation rate of eIF2\u2423, e.g., herpes simplex1 virus and coronavirus (He et al., 1997; Wang et al., 2009) . However, in some cases, viral protein synthesis can proceed under conditions of eIF2\u2423 phosphorylated as has been observed for HCV and rotaviruses. CSFV belongs to this last group, Interestingly, CSFV has a highly structured IRES that can associate with phosphorylated eIF2\u2423 and deliver Met-tRNA to the P site of a 40S ribosomal subunit to form the 48S initiation complex (Friis et al., 2012; Hashem et al., 2013; Jackson et al., 2010; Locker et al., 2007; Pestova et al., 2008) .",

However, the expression of viral proteins increased, suggesting that viral protein synthesis was insensitive to the inhibitory effects of phosphorylated eIF2\u2423. It was observed that the localization of eIF2\u2423 and viral NS5A proteins partially overlapped. NS5A is an essential component of the viral RNA replication machinery, interacting with the 3 UTR of viral RNA and regulating its synthesis (Sheng et al., 2012) . It is therefore possible that cytoplasmic eIF2\u2423 is involved in the translation of CSFV RNA during infection. Consistent with these results, CSFV replication was enhanced in PKR over-expressing-cells, as evidenced by virus title and increased viral RNA and protein levels. Conversely, PKR inhibition by 2-AP or shRNA decreased CSFV replication. PKR activation induces nuclear factor (NF)-B translocation which in turns increases IFN-\u2424 production (Gil et al., 1999; Stewart et al., 2003) .",

While inhibiting of PKR enhanced IFN expression, likely because PKR reduction decreased CSFV replication, thereby alleviating the inhibition of IFN induction. In this study, PKR was found mediate CSFV-induced eIF2\u2423 phosphorylation, since this was blocked by PKR depletion. Conversely, PKR activation promoted CSFV replication. MX1, an IFN-induced antiviral protein, strongly inhibited CSFV replication while it is not normally expressed in CSFV-infected cells (He et al., 2014) . Suppressing PKR restored MX1 expression. These results suggest that CSFV infection triggers PKR and eIF2\u2423 phosphorylation, which inhibits cellular protein synthesis, disrupts the host innate immune response, and ultimately enhances viral replication and reduces IFN-\u2424 induction.",

Thus, there may be other mechanisms underlying the effect of PKR on CSFV replication. For instance, PKR also induces autophagy, which promotes CSFV replication (Pei et al., 2014) . We found that PKR depletion inhibited CSFV induced autophagy (data not shown). On the other hand, viral components may have the capacity to regulate PKR: HCV NS5A interacts directly with PKR, which regulates HCV replication in conjunction with the HCV IRES (Gale et al., 1998; He et al., 2001; Toroney et al., 2010) , In addition, Japanese encephalitis virus NS2A had been shown to block PKR (Tu et al., 2012) , while PKR is not activated in WNV-infected rodent cells (Elbahesh et al., 2011) . Whether similar mechanisms exist in CSFV will be the subject of future investigations.",

Moreover, PKR depletion enhanced the expression of IFN and consequently increased the expression of the IFN-induced antiviral effector protein MX1. These results indicate that CSFV utilizes PKR/eIF2\u2423 signaling pathway enhances survival while evading the host immune response. These findings can explain why CSFV infection is persistent and characterized by low IFN levels.",
