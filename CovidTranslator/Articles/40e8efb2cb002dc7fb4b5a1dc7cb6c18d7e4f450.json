Glycoprotein E rns of an atypical bovine pestivirus Th/04 KhonKaen was produced in a baculovirus expression system and was purified by affinity chromatography. The recombinant E rns protein was used as an antigen in a microsphere immunoassay for the detection of antibodies against BVDV-1 and atypical bovine pestivirus. The diagnostic performance of the new method was evaluated by testing a total of 596 serum samples, and the assay was compared with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Based on the negative/positive cut-off median fluorescence intensity (MFI) value of 2800, the microsphere immunoassay had a sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 100% compared to ELISA. The immunoassay was able to detect antibodies against both BVDV-1 and the atypical pestivirus. This novel microsphere immunoassay has the potential to be multiplexed for simultaneous detection of antibodies against different bovine pathogens in a high-throughput and economical way.",

The pestiviral genome is a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA molecule with a standard size of approximately 12.5 kb (Colett et al., 1988; Deng and Brock, 1992) . The genome consists of an open reading frame (ORF) flanked by two untranslated regions (UTRs) at the 5 and 3 ends. Following translation, the ORF is processed into 11 mature proteins, namely N-terminal protease (N pro ), capsid protein (C), three glycoproteins (E1, E2, E rns ), protein of 7 kDa (p7) and five non-structural proteins (NS2-3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A, NS5B) (Thiel et al., 1996) . Glycoprotein E2 is immunodominant in eliciting antibody response to virus infection whereas glycoprotein E rns and non-structural protein NS3 participate in immune response (Corapi et al., 1990) . NS3 is conserved antigenically whereas E rns shows less antigenic diversity than E2 (Fulton et al., 2003) . Phylogenetic analysis has demonstrated that the atypical bovine pestiviruses are related more closely to the recognized bovine pestivirus species BVDV-1 and BVDV-2 than to any other pestivirus species (Liu et al., 2009c Decaro et al., 2011) .",

An atypical pestivirus D32/00 'HoBi' was first detected in a batch of fetal calf serum of Brazilian origin (Schirrmeier et al., 2004) and subsequently similar viruses were detected in batches of fetal bovine serum (FBS) of different origin (Peletto et al., 2012; Liu et al., 2009b; Xia et al., 2011) . Recent experiments revealed that the atypical bovine pestiviruses may cause clinical signs of the disease similar to those caused by BVDV-1 (Larska et al., 2012; Decaro et al., 2012b) . Although an atypical pestivirus strain Th/04 KhonKaen was found to cause subclinical infection Kampa et al., 2009) , another atypical pestivirus was associated with an outbreak of severe respiratory disease in Italy (Decaro et al., 2011) . The latter agent was detected subsequently in aborted fetuses (Decaro et al., 2012a) , which is a reminiscent of a previous report (Cortez et al., 2006) . The economic losses due to BVDV infection may be high. For example, losses are estimated at 10 and 40 million $ per million calvings at the national level (Houe, 2003) . In order to reduce or prevent losses caused by BVDV, national BVDV control programs have been implemented in several countries with great success, especially in Scandinavia (Lindberg et al., 2006) .",

However, blocking with PBS containing 5% milk in the immunoassay created certain technical problems: it clogged the needle in the Luminex analyzer such that the probe had to be cleaned four or five times during analysis. The microspheres were also likely to be aggregated and covered by the milk, and were lost during washing steps. Therefore, it took the analyzer longer time to count 100 beads per sample and the test could fail completely. The PBS containing 1% BSA worked well for some samples but high MFI values were also observed in several negative samples. As the microspheres itself gave neglect MFI values, it is likely that even in the purified protein there were still some impurities that caused the unspecific binding to bovine antibodies. To reduce the unspecific binding, sera were incubated with Sf9 cell lysate before being tested in the immunoassay, which brought down MFI values for the negative samples whereas the MFI values for the positive samples were not affected.

While 15 serum samples from all three infected groups were tested positive, a slight difference in the MFI values was observed. The highest MFI value (average) was 21,956 for the sera against atypical pestivirus, where the viral E rns protein was the antigen; the lowest MFI value (average) was 17,818 for the BVDV-1 sera that were heterologous to the antigen; and 20,471 for the sera of the mixed infection. Interestingly, when the E rns protein was replaced by that of BVDV-1 strain CP7, the average MFI values of these three groups changed, with the highest (22,915) for the homologous sera (BVDV-1) and the lowest (17,425) for the heterologous sera (atypical pestivirus) and middle value (20,715) for the mixed infection. More studies are needed in order to investigate whether this correlation is consistent or it is just a coincidence. Furthermore, the immunoassay could be expanded readily for the simultaneous detection of antibodies against multiple bovine viruses in the Bovine Respiratory and Enteric Disease (BRD and BED, respectively) complexes, such as bovine coronavirus, bovine respiratory syncytial virus, and bovine parainfluenza-3 virus.",

The E rns microsphere immunoassay was able to detect antibodies against bovine viral diarrhea viruses with performance similar to commercial ELISAs. Thus, the microsphere immunoassay, using the recombinant E rns protein of an atypical bovine pestivirus, offers a powerful novel alternative to the current diagnostic methods for bovine viral diarrhea and related diseases. This microsphere immunoassay platform opens new possibilities for the rapid and complex diagnosis of respiratory and enteric diseases, with great multiplexing potential and flexibility.",
