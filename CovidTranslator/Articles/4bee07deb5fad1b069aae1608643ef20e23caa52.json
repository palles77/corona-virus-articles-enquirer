Spread of this infection from the initial cases in Guangdong Province in China has not only occurred in other areas within China, including the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, but has also resulted in confirmed or probable cases in 26 other countries on four continents as of 26 April 2003.l Of particular concern is that there has been well-documented spread from patients to health care workers (HCWs), and subsequent secondary spread to contacts of these individuals. There have been 4836 probable cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), resulting in 293 deaths that have been reported to the World Health Organization (WHO),l giving a casemortality rate of 6.1%.",

This definition, which has been modified over time, has most recently been updated for the USA as summarized in Table 1 . 2 Early reports of the etiologic agent of the syndrome included a member of the genus Chlamydia, a paramyxovirus, and a Mycoplasma species. Most recently, a novel coronavirus has been identified as the etiologic agent of SARS,3-5 although this agent has not been recovered in a significant fraction of the cases of SARS in Canada. Coronavirus infections, which are known to affect many vertebrates, have been identified, along with rhinoviruses, as common causes of upper respiratory tract infections. There is precedent for pneumonia due to coronaviral infections in humans. Human coronavirus OC43 strains have been shown to be present in lower respiratory tract infections, including cases of pneumonia and bronchiolitis in Normandy, France, and, in a number of cases in both children and adults, it was the only etiologic agent identified. 6 On 14 March 2003, the WHO issued a global health alert for authorities to be aware of a new atypical pneumonia (SARS) reported in several countries in Southeast Asia. This was the first global alert from the WHO in more than a decade. The international dimension of the SARS outbreak, which is regarded as being beyond the control of any single government, has resulted in a great deal of work in a short period of time, although, as of this date, there is no known effective therapy.

The index patient (patient A) had onset of symptoms on 15 February. He traveled from Guangdong Province, China to Hong Kong to visit his family, and stayed on the ninth floor of the hotel on 21 February. He was admitted to hospital 2 on 22 February, and died the next day. Four health care workers and two of his family members subsequently became ill; one family member died. Of the 12 other patients linked to hotel M, 10 were in the hotel on the same day as the index patient; the other two patients (patients L and M) stayed in the hotel during the time that three other symptomatic patients were guests in the hotel. Nine of the 13 patients, including patient A, stayed on the ninth floor; one stayed on the 14th floor; one stayed on the 11th floor; and two stayed on both the ninth and 14th floors. Epidemiologic investigations have identified patients from this cluster as index patients in subsequent clusters in Hong Kong and other areas. Patient B is the index patient for the outbreak in Hanoi involving 59 HCWs and close contacts, and is also linked to one case in Thailand. Patients C, D and E are associated with 70 cases in Singapore and three cases in Germany. Patient F is linked with a cluster of 16 other cases in Toronto. Patients H and J are linked with outbreaks among HCWs in other hospitals in Hong Kong. Patient L appears to have become infected during his stay at hotel M, with subsequent transmission to his wife, patient M.",

It may well be that the range of illness due to the viral agent includes cases that do not fit the current case definition and, as a result, do not meet the criteria established for SARS.

By contrast, as there are several infectious agents that can cause a clinically indistinguishable infection, there may well be individuals, especially within China, in whom the etiology of the illness is due to another agent. These cases of atypical pneumonia may meet the case definition of SARS, but are due to background noise. SARS is mostly spread by exposure to respiratory droplets during close face-to-face contact. The initial cluster of patients from the index case in the Metropole Hotel in Hong Kong was probably infected in the elevator lobby. Increased spread by droplet infection by the use of nebulizers has been reported. 8 There may be additional routes of transmission.The cluster of cases centered around the Amoy Gardens Housing Estate in Hong Kong has raised the possibility of transmission from an environmental source or the via the fecal-oral route. There appears to be no evidence among this group of patients for airborne transmission.",

Coronaviruses have lipid envelopes and, thus, are susceptible to inactivation by heat, desiccation, oxidizing agents, lipid solvents, nonionic detergents, and ultraviolet irradiation. Survival time depends on the viral genotype, the composition of carrier and substrate, and the particular situation. Respiratory viruses transmitted in droplets or aerosols generally have a limited duration and range of infectivity, whereas other routes of transmission may be more protective (e.g. feces), and so would lead to contamination of the environment for longer periods.",

            "text": "The incubation period is usually 2-7 days, but may be as long as 10 days. In the health care setting, SARS is highly infectious, with some reported attack rates of greater than 50% among HCWs caring for patients with SARS. The WHO investigative team also found evidence of 'super-spreaders' in Guangdong, including one who is thought to have infected as many as 100 other persons. This could be due to poor infection control procedures, specific characteristics of a viral strain, or host factors. More recent data coming out of China have been problematic. By mid-April, Chinese health officials acknowledged only 37 cases of SARS in Beijing. A week later, this number increased to nearly 1200 cases, as the Chinese Health Ministry disclosed numerous previously unreported and new confirmed and suspected cases. It seems that the authorities may have been actively suppressing data. This possible underreporting and 'denial' of the disease burden may have resulted in increased transmission: for example, disregard of specific infection control measures, and failure to recognize the need to seek medical attention early to minimize the number of potential contacts. Another issue is the division of patients between regular and military hospitals, with suggestions that patients in military hospitals were not included in official figures. There were no restrictions placed on travel during the Chinese New Year celebrations in February 2003, when up to 100 million people traveled within China, permitting the spread of the virus from one province to another. However, the more recent May Day holiday was shortened, to try to prevent the massive movement of people. While this is encouraging, it may be too late, in that SARS has already spread to some of China's poorest provinces, many of which (according to a WHO investigative team) have less capacity to cope with the challenge posed by SARS. The unfortunate situation in China emphasizes the need for transparency in reporting (not just for SARS, but for all infectious diseases) and the need for coordinated disease-control efforts.",

More recently, a cluster of 321 almost simultaneous cases has been recorded in residents of the Amoy Gardens housing estate. This large and sudden cluster has prompted many questions, such as whether transmission could be from an environmental source. Patients from the Amoy Gardens commonly presented with diarrhea, which is unusual, and their symptoms seemed more severe overall. There were also deaths in younger, previously healthy individuals. The severity may represent infection with high viral loads, following exposure to a concentrated environmental source, or infection with a virus that is of greater virulence.",

Sequence comparisons of different isolates of the SARS virus show several variable sites, the biological significance of which has yet to be determined. Many aspects of the behavior of the SARS virus are currently poorly understood. Questions include the viral concentrations in different body fluids, and the stage of the illness in which viral shedding is highest. Survival time in the environment, on dry surfaces and in suspension (e.g. feces) is also being investigated.

A coordinated multicenter approach to establish the effectiveness of ribavirin and other interventions has been proposed. There is no evidence for its use as prophylaxis, and many experts believe that it will be some years before an effective vaccine for the virus is available. WHO Revised Guidelines: management of contacts of probable SARS cases A SARS contact is a person who may be at greater risk of developing SARS because of exposure to a suspect or probable case of SARS (Table 1) . A contact of a probable SARS case should be given information about SARS, and placed under active surveillance for 10 days in voluntary home isolation. The contact should record his temperature daily, and be visited or telephoned daily by a member of the public health care team. If the contact develops disease symptoms, they should be investigated locally at an appropriate health care facility. WHO Revised Guidelines: management of contacts of suspect SARS cases It is recommended that contacts of suspect cases should be given information on the clinical picture and transmission of SARS and placed under passive surveillance for 10 days. The contact is free to continue with his usual activities, but if he develops any symptoms, he should telephone the public health authority immediately. CONCLUSION As the work on the virus, its clinical manifestations, treatment and prevention proceed, there are many unanswered questions that will challenge scientists, clinicians, and public health workers. These include: how this new virus entered the human population and succeeded in spreading so rapidly from person-toperson, a phenomenon that is not always the case when respiratory viruses make the species jump to humans; what the variation at the molecular level means for the pathogenesis and epidemiology of this virus; and what will be the results over time of its co-evolution with the human host. As there are numerous as yet uncharacterized animal viruses that periodically enter the human population, this outbreak, although due to a viral infection with a relatively low mortality rate, should serve as a warning to the global public health community of the importance of openness in communicating health care threats at an early stage. To not do so because of political concerns could jeopardize human health due to pandemic influenza, a paramyxovirus that is able to establish human-to-human transmission, another coronavirus, or an unrecognized agent. The political will to ensure this openness must be universal, as a single area that does not cooperate with such a policy risks the health of all humankind.",

China has reported a total of 2753 cases and an additional 1402 cases in the Special Administrative Region of Hong Kong. Other countries heavily affected include Singapore and Canada. Overall, almost 30 countries have reported cases of SARS, six of which were classified by the WHO as 'affected areas'. These 'affected areas' are those in which local chain(s) of transmission have been identified, and include Canada (Toronto); Singapore; China (Beijing, Guangdong, Hong Kong SAR, Inner Mongolia, Shanxi and the Province of Taiwan); USA (areas not reported); UK (London); and Vietnam (Hanoi). Note that, in Taiwan, London and some areas of the USA, the local transmission is limited: there is no evidence of international spread from the area since 15 March 2003, and no transmission other than close person-to-person contact.In China, an outbreak of atypical pneumonia consisting of 305 cases began in Guangdong Province in November 2002. However, the Chinese authorities only informed the WHO on 11 February 2003. It transpired that this outbreak, which is now recognized as SARS, dates back to at least 16 November 2002, when an initial case was reported in Foshan City.",
