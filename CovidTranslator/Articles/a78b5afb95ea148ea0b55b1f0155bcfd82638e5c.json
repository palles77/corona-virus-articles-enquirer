Here we describe inhibitors of the adenovirus proteinase (AVP) with the ultimate objective of developing anti-adenovirus agents. Inhibitors were identified via structure-based drug design using as druggable sites the active site and a conserved cofactor pocket in the crystal structures of AVP. A lead compound was identified that had an IC 50 of 18 M. One of eight structural derivatives of the lead compound had an IC 50 of 140 nM against AVP and an IC 50 of 490 nM against the AVP with its cofactor bound.",

            "text": "Adenoviruses are major human pathogens that infect a wide range of vertebrates, from hamsters to humans. They are the cause of many, different acute infections, mostly in the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts, and conjunctivitis. (http://www.vmri.hu/~harrach/ AdVtaxlong.htm). Late in adenovirus infection, young virions are assembled in part from precursor proteins. Of the 12 major virion proteins, 6 are precursor proteins. The penultimate step before the appearance of infectious virus is the activation of the adenovirus proteinase (AVP), a 23 kDa cysteine proteinase [1, 2] , followed by the processing of the virion precursor proteins. AVP is activated by two cofactors, pVIc (GVQSLKRRRCF) [3, 4] , the 11-amino acid peptide from the C-terminus of the precursor to protein VI, pVI, and the viral DNA genome [3] . We determined crystal structures of the AVP-pVIc complex at 1.6 \u00c5 resolution [2] and of AVP in the absence of cofactors at 0.98 \u00c5 resolution [5] . Because AVP is essential for synthesis of infectious virus, it is an attractive target for antiviral therapy [6] [7] [8] [9] .",

To prepare the structures for site identification, all waters and heteroatoms were removed from the coordinate files. Then, using Chimera (UCSF), mol2 files were generated utilizing the highest occupancy alternate conformation side chains with all hydrogens assigned based on default charge parameters. Then, the hydrogens were stripped from the structures, and the DMS module of Chimera was used to generate the molecular surface for each protein. In order to identify potential sites on the surface, the SPHGEN module of DOCK (version 5.0, UCSF) was run using a 1.4 \u00c5 probe on the molecular surface. The resultant sphere files were converted to PDB format utilizing the DOCK module SHOWSPHERE, and then visual inspection of the spheres for complementarity in regions of the structures involved in cofactor binding or activation was carried out. Sphere clusters residing within an 8 \u00c5 radius of those specific regions of interest were compiled, one cluster near the active site residues His54 and Cys122, another cluster in a surface pocket that in the AVP-pVIc structure contains the Gly1 , Val2 and Gln3 of pVIc (termed NT-pocket). As an independent validation of the site choices, Fpocket, an open source pocket detection software package, was used to detect cavities from the PDB files, with water and heteroatoms of AVP or AVP-pVIc complexes removed. Visual inspection of the results of the query structures with embedded centers of pocket -spheres revealed that in the AVP structure, the NT-pocket was the second ranked among the 12 identified in the Fpocket analysis. For the AVP-pVIc structure, the results list the active site pocket was the highest rank of the 12 pockets that were identified in the Fpocket analysis. The Fpocket results confirmed our target choices.",

The small molecule output was ranked based on intermolecular AMBER energy scoring (van der Waals plus coulombic), contact scoring and bump filtering. The resultant ligand poses were then ranked by energy score with those in the entire virtual library on a relative basis, and the top ranked ligands were visually inspected for binding poses for each target. The top 10 compounds from each target were obtained from the NCI/DTP for testing the efficacy as an inhibitor in biochemical assays.",

Inspection of the surface of the AVP-pVIc complex indicates that the Nand C-termini of pVIc are bound in pockets, Fig. 2B . When comparing these sites to those regions on the surface of the AVP structure, only the N-terminal binding pocket for pVIc, abbreviated NT-pocket, is fully formed, Fig. 2A . The C-terminal binding pocket for pVIc, abbreviated CT-pocket, therefore must be induced upon the binding of pVIc. We predicted that a drug binding in the NT-pocket would prevent the binding of pVIc to AVP and hence prevent the activation of AVP. To see if the NT-pocket is a legitimate druggable site, we mutated the N-terminal amino acid of pVIc to an Ala. The K d for the binding of wild-type pVIc to AVP is 4.4 M [19] ; the K d for the mutant is at least an order of magnitude higher. Therefore, this pocket is a legitimate site.",

            "text": "During an adenovirus infection, two forms of AVP are present, one early and one late. AVP is initially synthesized in an inactive form. The NT-pocket, where the N-terminus of pVIc binds, is a druggable target. A compound binding there should prevent pVIc from binding and thus inhibit the activation of the enzyme. Parenthetically, the structure of the NT-pocket in AVP is the same in the AVP-pVIc complex. One reason AVP is inactive is that its active site is structurally different from that in AVP-pVIc, the active form of the enzyme. Thus, the active site of AVP was not considered for drugging. However, it is a druggable site in the AVP-pVIc complex. A drug binding in the active site of the AVP-pVIc complex may interfere with substrate binding thereby affecting the activity of the enzyme. Our docking studies revealed a compound predicted to bind in the NT-pocket in AVP and in the active site of the AVP-pVIc complex, and this compound inhibited the enzyme. Searches of structural variants of this lead inhibitor identified two other, even more effective, compounds. Each of these compounds is predicted to bind to two different sites, one in AVP and the other in the AV-pVIc complex. It may be that we have identified a compound that both inhibits a crucial step early in infection and a crucial step late in infection.",

The two sites on the proteinase predicted to bind to NSC 36806, the NT-pocket and the active site, are at the ends of a 62 amino acid long activation path [5] . Because these two binding sites are quite far from each other, a minimum of two mutations may be required for a virus to become resistant. The probability of two independent mutations occurring at specific sites within 615 bases on the same DNA molecule is quite low. Secondly, because the two binding sites are connected by an activation path, a mutation leading to resistance at one site may affect the functioning of the activation path leading to the other site, thereby decreasing the probability of resistance arising even more [24, 25] . This is not unlike combination therapy, but, instead of two compounds interacting with two, different sites, it is one compound interacting with two, different sites.",

This result was surprising as the crystal structure of AVP-pVIc complexes indicates the four amino acids involved in catalysis are in identical positions to those in papain [1, 2] . However, in examining how NSC 36806 docked to the active site of the AVP-pVIc complex structure aligned to a papain structure active site, several regions within the active site groove predicted to interact with NSC 36806 in the adenovirus proteinase are absent in the papain active site, and this may be the origin of the apparent selectivity of NSC 37249.",
