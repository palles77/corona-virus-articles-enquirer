When the outer surface of an FFR becomes contaminated, it presents a contact transmission risk to the wearer. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidance recommends that healthcare workers (HCWs) doff FFRs by grasping the straps at the back of the head to avoid contact with the potentially contaminated surface. Adherence to proper doffing technique is reportedly low due to numerous factors including difficulty in locating and grasping the straps. This study compares the impact of tabs placed on FFR straps to controls (without tabs) on proper doffing, ease of use and comfort, and reduction of transfer of contamination to the wearer. Utilizing a fluorescent agent as a tracer to track contamination from FFRs to hand and head areas of 20 human subjects demonstrated that there was no difference in tabbed FFR straps and controls with respect to promoting proper doffing (p = 0.48), but did make doffing easier (p = 0.04) as indicated by 7 of 8 subjects that used the tabs. Seven of the 20 subjects felt that FFRs with tabs were easier to remove, while only 2 of 20 indicated that FFRs without tabs were easier to remove. Discomfort was not a factor for either FFR strap type. When removing an FFR with contaminated hands, the use of the tabs significantly reduced the amount of tracer transfer compared to straps without tabs (p = 0.012). FFRs with tabs on the straps are associated with ease of doffing and significantly less transfer of the fluorescent tracer.",

[1] The outbreak of Ebola and subsequent infection of HCWs has heightened awareness regarding procedural gaps with the proper use of PPE. The types of PPE used in healthcare including, gowns and aprons, protective facemasks and respirators, goggles and face shields, and gloves provide a barrier between the HCW and potentially infectious materials. The benefits and shortcomings of PPE use in healthcare are not a new topic and have received substantial consideration for other pathogens encountered in healthcare, such as influenza, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and tuberculosis (TB). [2] [3] [4] [5] PPE is the last category in the hierarchy of safety controls which includes training and administrative controls, engineering controls, and work practice controls, and often represents the last line of physical protection for HCW. Despite its importance, proper PPE use and respiratory protection compliance in healthcare is lacking. [6, 7] PPE can be difficult to select and use, uncomfortable to wear, and requires adherence to proper donning and doffing procedures. [8] These issues can lead to improper donning and doffing of PPE, which could increase the potential for PPE fomite transmission of pathogens to the wearer.",

The recommendations for the specific types of PPE required to protect HCWs are based on a multitude of factors, such as the type of patient contact anticipated, the mode of transmission of the pathogen, the virulence of the pathogen, and PPE durability. [9] PPE recommendations can vary depending on the level of precautions being used. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) 2007 Guidelines for isolation precautions, transmission-based precautions are used in addition to standard precautions when standard precautions do not completely interrupt the route(s) of transmission. [9] Transmission based precautions are employed for specific pathogens which may be encountered on an intermittent basis, and may leave little opportunity for HCWs to gain experience with the specific protective devices recommended for the specific pathogen based on route(s) of transmission. PPE that is more intuitive to use could help HCWs traverse the PPE learning curve when emergency situations call for heightened precautions.",

The CDC has recommended the use of N95 FFRs as part of isolation precautions for pathogens transmitted via the airborne route, such as TB, and during certain medical procedures for some epidemiologically important organisms such as Ebola. [10, 11] FFRs reduce the wearer's inhalation exposure to infectious particles and restrict the user from touching his/her mouth and nose, which limits opportunities to transfer pathogens from the hands to the mucosa of the wearer. Studies in various workplaces have demonstrated that fittested FFRs, when used in a complete respiratory protection program, are effective at reducing inhalation exposures. [12] [13] [14] Like many other interventions (e.g., hand washing, vaccination, etc.), the effectiveness of FFRs is ultimately governed by compliance and proper use, including adherence to proper donning and doffing procedures.",

As detailed in the CDC recommended PPE doffing sequence poster (Figure 1 ), protective facemasks are the final piece of PPE to be removed and should be removed by grasping the tethering straps at the back of the head. Doffing the FFR by grasping the straps posteriorly allows the wearer to avoid making contact with the potentially contaminated filtering surface of the FFR. Unfortunately, adherence to proper FFR doffing technique is lacking.

Some of the 3 M 1860 FFRs used in this research study were modified by placing 4 red foam tabs on the straps ( Figure 2 ). It is important to note that modifying FFRs in such a manner in the workplace may result in the device being in an unapproved configuration. The use of modified devices should be limited to research and development efforts and not used in devices intended for protection in actual workplaces. The tabs were cut into a \"bow tie\" shape and folded around the strap to form a trapezoidal shape with a one sided surface area of approximately 11 cm 2 . The design of the tabs was influenced by a brief search of the literature concerning the effectiveness of warning labels. Based on these studies, we determined that both the color red and triangular shape (truncated to a trapezoidal shape for durability) were two characteristics of warning labels that were readily recognized and recalled. [22] [23] [24] [25] The tabs measured 3.81 cm (1.5\u2032) in length; preliminary trials assessing the comfort of grasping the tabs found that area of the tabs was sufficient to accommodate the volar surface of the index and middle finger on one side of the tab and the volar surface of the thumb on the opposite side.

As for ease of doffing, a cursory view of the results suggests that the tabs on the FFR straps did not make doffing easier as most subjects indicated that there was no noticeable difference between the FFRs with tabs and the FFRs without tabs (Table 1) . However, all but one of the subjects that used the tabs to doff the FFRs found the tabs to be easier to use (Table 1) .

Hands can become contaminated while administering patient care in the event that a HCW is not using gloves. [30] [31] [32] [33] Even if HCWs are protecting their hands with the use of gloves, the sequence of proper PPE doffing (Figure 1 ) dictates that the FFR or mask is the last piece of PPE to be removed. If the hands do become contaminated during the process of PPE doffing, it is easy to remove potential infectious organisms by performing hand hygiene. In fact, the updated CDC recommended procedure and sequence for PPE removal states to \"perform hand hygiene between steps if hands become contaminated and immediately after removing all PPE.\" [16] Proper hand hygiene compliance in healthcare settings is deficient. [34] Moreover, if pathogens are unknowingly transferred to the head or neck region of the HCW, removal of the pathogens would not occur until the HCW presumably showers after his or her shift. During the time between contamination and contamination removal, the HCW's head and hair serve as a source of pathogens for further transmission. Using the tabs to doff FFRs reduces the contact between the hands and the hair and head of the wearer, thus minimizing the potential for contact transmission. The tabs did not prohibit all contact between the hands and the hair and head of the subject, especially in cases where the subject's hair was long or curly; however, proper training and perhaps improved tab design can increase the protective efficacy of the tabs.",
