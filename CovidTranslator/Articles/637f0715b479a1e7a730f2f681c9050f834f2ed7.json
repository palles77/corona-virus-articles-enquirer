Here we use a murine model for evaluation of the induction of humoral and cellular immune responses by inactivated and PHE-CoV DNA vaccines in order to define the immune correlates for protection against PHE-CoV. The inactivated vaccine was composed of purified PHE-CoV and aluminum hydroxide gel (alum), which was chosen as an adjuvant because of its long history of safety for human use. The PHE-CoV DNA vaccine was constructed by subcloning the S1 gene of PHE-CoV into the pVAX1 vector to create the recombinant plasmid pV-S1. Our results showed that the inactivated PHE-CoV vaccine (IPV) elicited a high level of humoral immunity, resulting in good protection efficacy against PHE-CoV challenge. The IPV induced the IgG1 subclass of serum antibodies and expression of the cytokine interleukin-4 (IL-4), suggesting that the IPV generated a predominantly Th2-type immune response. The DNA vaccine was found to mediate primarily a cellular immune response with high levels of IgG2a and the cytokines IL-2 and gamma interferon (IFN-\u2425). However, mice that were vaccinated twice with the DNA vaccine and boosted with the IPV could mount a sufficient neutralizing antibody response against live PHE-CoV, with little variation in IgG1 and IgG2a levels, and showed high levels of IL-2 and IL-4. This response may activate both B and T cells to mount a specific humoral and cellular immune response that could, in turn, elicit a phagocyte-mediated defense against PHE-CoV infections to achieve viral clearance.",

PHE-CoV infects mainly piglets under the age of 3 weeks and causes vomiting, exhaustion, and obvious neurological symptoms. The mortality rate ranges from 20 to 100% (11) . In 1962, the pathogen was isolated for the first time in vivo from breastfeeding pigs suffering from encephalomyelitis in Canada (12) . In 1969, an antigenically identical virus was isolated in England from suckling pigs showing anorexia, depression, and vomiting but no clear signs of encephalomyelitis (10) . Animals that did not die had stunted growth, and thus, the condition was called \"vomiting and wasting disease\" (VWD). Mengeling and Cutlip (22) were later able to reproduce both forms of the disease experimentally using the same field isolates. PHE has been reported in all of the major pig-producing countries of Europe, Asia, and North America, where it appears to be endemic with no clinical outbreaks (5, 22) . PHE-CoV was first reported in China in 1986; eventually, it occurred both on the mainland and in Taiwan Province (6) .",

            "text": "Studies of the chemical composition of PHE-CoV (4, 23) have revealed that it is an RNA virus with five polypeptides, four of which-the nucleocapsid (N), membrane (M), spike (S), and hemagglutinin-esterase (HE) proteins-are glycosylated. The coronavirus S glycoprotein is a major determinant of neurovirulence (16, 34) and is responsible for viral attachment to the cellular receptor and for fusion of the viral and cellular membranes, resulting in virus entry. The S glycoprotein can also induce neutralizing antibodies in vivo or in vitro, as well as cell-mediated immunity (1) . Many viral antigens (19) , including S1 from transgenic plants, have been demonstrated to be effective at inducing muco-sal and serum immune responses in animals. The natural host of PHE-CoV is the pig, but the virus has been adapted experimentally for replication in mice and Wistar rats (36) . The virus is neurotropic in mice, but susceptibility was found to be influenced by age and the route of inoculation (37) . Under experimental conditions, the disease has been reproduced in most instances following oronasal exposure of nonimmune pigs to PHE-CoV during the first few weeks of life (2) . Clinical signs may vary, however. In a study in which the virulence of several PHE-CoV field isolates was compared, symptom severity was related to differences in host susceptibility and the apparent virulence of each isolate (22) . In contrast, older pigs and neonatal pigs that had received antibodies in colostrum were usually clinically unaffected when they were exposed to PHE-CoV under otherwise similar conditions (2) . Thus, neonatal pigs are usually protected by passively acquired colostral antibodies, and they subsequently develop an age-related resistance to the potential clinical effects of the virus.",

Currently, developmental methods for inactivated vaccines are well established, and such vaccines exhibit good immunogenicity, high stability, high security, ease of storage, and other benefits (27) . DNA vaccine technologies, however, are relatively new and seek to use gene therapy to express protective immunity by inserting original genes into cells to produce antigens through endogenous protein expression; expressed proteins are presented to the immune system, causing long-term and sustained antibody responses and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL)-based cell immunity (18) . In this study, the cDNA of the PHE-CoV S1 gene was directionally subcloned into vector pVAX1 downstream of the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter to create a recombinant S1 gene DNA vaccine plasmid. At the same time, PHE-CoVs were inactivated using formaldehyde, and an appropriate amount of alum was added to produce the inactivated PHE-CoV vaccine. To determine the immunogenicities of the inactivated PHE-CoV and PHE-CoV DNA vaccine candidates, we immunized mice intramuscularly with the candidate vaccines and assessed the efficacies of the humoral and cellular immune responses elicited against PHE-CoV infection in the murine model.",

Most of the infections in this species are subclinical, and the overall economic impact of the disease is low. Serological surveys have revealed that infection of swine with PHE-CoV is very common and is probably a worldwide occurrence. In fattening pigs, 31% of the sera tested in Canada (2), 46% in Northern Ireland (20) , 49% in England (5), 52 to 82% in Japan were detected using ELISA and secondary antibodies (anti-mouse IgG1, IgG2a, IgG2b, IgG3, and IgA) on individual serum samples at 6 weeks. The levels of anti-PHE-CoV IgG2a and IgG1 in mice immunized with any of the five vaccines (IP, IPV, S1, 2S1 \u03e9 IPV, or IPV \u03e9 2S1) were significantly different from those in the control groups (PBS and pVAX1) (**, P \u03fd 0.01). (14) , and 0 to 89% in the United States (21) were positive, depending on the region surveyed. Conversely, Neuvonen et al. (24) found that 40 Finnish elite breeding pig herds were free of seropositive animals. Furthermore, most pigs receive protective antibodies in colostrum; however, piglets without PHE-CoV antibodies, especially specific-pathogen-free (SPF) pigs (30) from breeding farms in several countries, including China, are at greater risk of PHE-CoV infection. Moreover, with the recessive spread of PHE-CoV, the viral genes may mutate to reinforce virulence, and this is another potential threat of PHE-CoV. Animals infected with PHE-CoV appear wasted and stunted, which affects their performance and the quality of their meat. Thus, the potential hazard of this disease for the pig industry cannot be ignored. Currently, there are no reports of a PHE-CoV vaccine in China or elsewhere, although several countries use \"subclinical infection\" as a means of prevention. In \"subclinical infection,\" 1-monthantepartum sows are exposed, either by contact with sick pigs, by spray, or by intramuscular injection, to weak strains of PHE-CoV so that the sow can protect the piglet through colostrum antibodies (12, 22) . However, this method of inducing immunity is dangerous, since PHE-CoV variants with different levels of virulence could undergo genetic recombination to increase the overall virulence of the virus. Therefore, the development of safe, high-performance vaccines for the prevention and treatment of PHE-CoV has important practical significance.",

Thus, the addition of alum to the IPV preparation was found to increase the serum VN activity significantly. The aluminum hydroxide adjuvant is still the only adjuvant approved by the FDA for use in human vaccines; its mechanism of action appears to be a storage effect (8) . Notably, pV-S1 could induce VN antibodies, and boosters were found to increase the level of antigen presentation in vivo. The combined use of IPV with the DNA vaccine induced even higher levels of serum neutralizing antibodies, but the VN titer in the 2S1 \u03e9 IPV group was higher than that in the IPV \u03e9 2S1 group.
