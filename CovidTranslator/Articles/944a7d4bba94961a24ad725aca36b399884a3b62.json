Keeping in mind its emergence, we developed a molecular detection system and utilized it to study vector competence and evaluate activity of antiviral compounds against RRV. A SYBR Green I-based quantitative RT-PCR for detection of RRV was developed targeting the E2 gene, with a detection limit of 100 RNA copies/reaction. The specificity was confirmed with closely related Alphaviruses and Flaviviruses. The assay was applied to study the vector competence of Indian Aedes aegypti for RRV, which revealed 100% infection and dissemination rate with 75% transmission rate. Viral RNA was found in saliva as early as 3 day post infection (dpi). Further application of the assay in antiviral drug evaluation revealed the superior in vitro activity of ribavirin compared to chloroquine in Vero cells. Successful demonstration of this assay to detect RRV in low titre mosquito samples makes it a sensitive tool in vector surveillance. This study also showed that Indian Ae. aegypti are well competent to transmit RRV highlighting the risk of its introduction to na\u00efve territories across continents. Further validation of this assay, revealed its utility in screening of potential antivirals against RRV.",

            "text": "The detection of RRV from field collected mosquitoes can be achieved through various assays like virus isolation, immunological and molecular tests. Viral isolation is the gold standard technique, however it is time consuming, requires cell culture facility and technical expertise. Serological test can be done through antigen capture ELISA but suffers from issue of sensitivity to detect low viral titre associated with mosquito samples. In contrast, PCR based molecular assay provide faster results, sensitive in detecting low titre samples and also do not require containment facility. The real time quantitative RT-PCR is more advantageous, as quantitation can be simultaneously achieved. Further these techniques provide higher sensitivity and simplicity in terms of sample processing compared to conventional RT-PCR. This technique is now widely used for mosquito surveillance and to study virus vector interactions (Dash et al., 2012; Agarwal et al., 2013) . Compared to another real time PCR assay based on Taqman probe, SYBR Green chemistry provide advantages in terms of cost, ease of performance and applicability for highly mutating RNA viruses. Low cost of this assay due to use of only desalted primers (expensive probes are not required) makes it economical for testing large number of samples. More importantly, this assay is insensitive to nucleotide variations that could occur within the probe target region, resulting in lower false-negative results (Papin et al., 2004) .",

Only symptomatic treatment including anti-pyretic, anti-inflammatory and corticosteroids are prescribed to patients to ameliorate the disease (Mylonas et al., 2004) . Development of antiviral remains one of the most important challenging areas in the management of viral infections. Classically, evaluation of antiviral compounds is performed employing plaque reduction assay. However, this technique is time consuming, labour intensive, making it restricted to advanced laboratories (Wei et al., 2013) . Subsequently, other assays including immunofluorescence and antigen ELISA have also been utilized for antiviral screening. However, these techniques are not very sensitive, labour intensive and also requires specific antibody.

Importation of tires containing infected mosquito eggs from infested countries has led to virus establishment in na\u00efve area (Benedict et al., 2007) . Because of the naive population and lower herd immunity, virus can rapidly spread and cause major epidemics. Also, the diagnostic capabilities for Ross River virus in many non-endemic countries are lacking. Keeping these events in view, we developed a detection system for RRV in this study and utilized it for vector competence studies and antiviral drug evaluation.",

The virus was aliquoted and stored in \u221280 \u2022 C until use. For cross-reactivity studies, among the alphaviruses, Chikungunya virus, DRDE-06 (EF210157) was used, while among the closely related flaviviruses viz., West Nile virus, Eg101(AF260968), Dengue virus-4, ND73(HM237348), and Japanese encephalitis virus, JaOArS982(M18370) were used. All these viruses were propagated in C6/36 cells in Virology Division, DRDE, Gwalior.

Though major outbreaks has not been reported outside Australia, however there are imported cases of RRV infection in New Zealand, through travelers who had travelled to Australia or nearby islands (Lau et al., 2012) . Recently cases of RRV infection were reported in Dutch and Japanese patient who returned from Australia (Tochitani et al., 2014; Reusken et al., 2015) . However, autochthonous transmission was not recorded in these cases unlike recent outbreaks of other arboviruses like Chikungunya and Zika virus (Grandadam et al., 2011; Maria et al., 2016) . This might be due to the absence of vectors or presence of incompetent vectors in the imported territories. The current endemicity of RRV in Oceania and its potential risk for tropical countries, mandates the urgent development of a simple, sensitive and specific molecular detection technique.",

Infection rate was determined as the percentage of all mosquitoes tested with infected midgut, which was found to be 100% at all the analyzed time points. Dissemination rate was determined as the percentage of mosquitoes with infected midgut that also had infected legs and wings, which was also found 100% at all the analyzed time points. The transmission rate was determined as the percentage of mosquitoes with positive dissemination that also had infected saliva. The transmission rate was found to reach up to 87.5% on 10 dpi. At 14 dpi, 75% transmission rate was achieved, which was higher compared to CHIKV as reported previously (Agarwal et al., 2013) . This high level of transmission rate clearly indicates very high vectorial competence of Indian Ae. aegypti. Transmission analysis revealed presence of RNA in mosquito saliva on 3 dpi indicating a short extrinsic incubation period. A short extrinsic incubation period is of very high significance in terms of faster virus transmission and may lead to major outbreak. Also, the assay was efficient to detect virus among mosquitoes of different pool sizes, demonstrating its utility during vector surveillance.",

Ae. aegypti spread from Africa to tropical and subtropical regions across the globe, is the primary vector for many viruses including Chikungunya (CHIKV), Dengue (DENV), Yellow fever (YFV) and Zika virus (ZIKV) (Tabachnick, 1991) . Ae. aegypti is the most dominant Aedes species widely distributed in all parts of India. The recent establishment of WNV, CHIKV and ZIKV in new territories substantiate the real threat associated with arboviruses. These risks associated with vector borne diseases inspired us to develop a sensitive technique for detecting RRV in mosquitoes. Since specific antiviral drug or vaccine against RRV is not yet available, early detection in mosquitoes can be a potential indicator of circulation of virus in nature and will assist to initiate prompt control measures. This preliminary study provides information on the vector competence of Indian Ae. aegypti for RRV.",

Previous studies on Chikungunya virus have demonstrated 5-20 M as the effective concentration of chloroquine (Khan et al., 2010) . However in this study, only marginal protection was observed with chloroquine against RRV. Different inhibitory mechanisms of chloroquine involves prevention of viral endocytosis (Khan et al., 2010) , decrease in concentration of cytokines like TNF-\u2423, IFN-\u2425 that are associated with disease severity and decrease in systemic levels of a liver enzyme (Aspartate aminotransferase) (Farias et al., 2015) . In contrast, ribavirin, a broad spectrum antiviral inhibits inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH), thus depleting intracellular GTP pool (Takhampunya et al., 2006) . It is a broad spectrum antiviral agent that acts as a RNA virus mutagen, causing lethal mutations in RNA virus genome (Crotty et al., 2002) .
