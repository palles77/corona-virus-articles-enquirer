            "text": "Ribosomal recruitment of cellular mRNAs depends on binding of eIF4F to the mRNA's 5 0 -terminal 'cap'. The minimal 'cap0' consists of N7-methylguanosine linked to the first nucleotide via a 5 0 -5 0 triphosphate (ppp) bridge. Cap0 is further modified by 2 0 -O-methylation of the next two riboses, yielding 'cap1' (m7GpppNmN) and 'cap2' (m7GpppNmNm). However, some viral RNAs lack 2 0 -O-methylation, whereas others contain only ppp-at their 5 0 -end. Interferon-induced proteins with tetratricopeptide repeats (IFITs) are highly expressed effectors of innate immunity that inhibit viral replication by incompletely understood mechanisms. Here, we investigated the ability of IFIT family members to interact with cap1-, cap0-and 5 0 ppp-mRNAs and inhibit their translation. IFIT1 and IFIT1B showed very high affinity to cap-proximal regions of cap0-mRNAs (K 1/2,app $9 to 23 nM). The 2 0 -O-methylation abrogated IFIT1/mRNA interaction, whereas IFIT1B retained the ability to bind cap1-mRNA, albeit with reduced affinity (K 1/2,app $450 nM). The 5 0 -terminal regions of 5 0 ppp-mRNAs were recognized by IFIT5 (K 1/2,app $400 nM). The activity of individual IFITs in inhibiting initiation on a specific mRNA was determined by their ability to interact with its 5 0 -terminal region: IFIT1 and IFIT1B efficiently outcompeted eIF4F and abrogated initiation on cap0-mRNAs, whereas inhibition on cap1-and 5 0 ppp-mRNAs by IFIT1B and IFIT5 was weaker and required higher protein concentrations.",

            "text": "The innate immune system initiates defensive responses to infecting viruses and bacteria by recognition of 'pathogen associated molecular patterns' (PAMPs) as 'non-self' signatures. Recognition is mediated by pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs) such as Toll-like receptors and RIG-Ilike receptors (1) . PAMPs specific to viral mRNAs include the double-stranded nature of RNA replicative intermediates, the absence of modified nucleosides (such as N 6methyladenosine) and single-stranded adenosine/uridine (AU)-rich regions (1) . The 5 0 -termini of some viral mRNAs also differ from those of cellular mRNAs. The mRNA cap consists of N7-methylguanosine linked to the first nucleotide via a 5 0 -5 0 ppp bridge: in the minimal RNA cap structure, named 'cap0', methylation is restricted to the N7 position of the guanine base, but in higher eukaryotes, additional methylation occurs at the 2 0 -position of riboses of the next two nucleotides, yielding the 2 0 -Omethylated 'cap1' (m 7 GpppNmN) and 'cap2' (m 7 GpppNmNm) ( Figure 1A ). Although many viral mRNAs are also capped and 2 0 -O-methylated (2), the genomic and antigenomic RNAs of negative-stranded RNA viruses such as influenza virus (family Orthomyxoviridae) instead have a 5 0 -terminal ppp (3) , whereas the genomic and subgenomic mRNAs of Sindbis virus (family Togaviridae) are capped but lack 2 0 -O-methylation (4, 5) . Nucleic acid recognition by PRRs activates signaling cascades that trigger the expression of Type 1 interferons (IFN) (6) . IFN secretion spreads the defensive response to neighboring cells by binding to IFN receptors, which activates the JAK-STAT signaling pathway, leading to strong transcriptional induction of >300 genes (7) . The IFN-induced tetratricopeptide repeat (IFIT) genes are among the Full length +6-8 nt most strongly induced by IFN treatment (e.g. 8, 9) , for example leading to the cytoplasmic accumulation of >1 \u00c2 10 6 IFIT1 molecules per cell (10) . Their abundance would be consistent with IFIT proteins having an executive function rather than a signaling role in innate immunity. The IFIT family arose by gene duplication and is conserved in vertebrates (11) (12) (13) . Most mammals encode IFIT1, IFIT2, IFIT3 and IFIT5, with the exception of mice and rats (which lack IFIT5) and horses (which lack IFIT1), but many species also have additional IFIT-like genes, encoding IFIT1B (in humans, mice and rabbits), IFIT1C (in mice), IFIT3B (in dogs and mice) and IFIT5-like proteins (in dogs and rabbits). IFIT proteins have molecular weights ranging between 47 and 72 kDa, and contain up to 11 tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) motifs (14) that form a series of tandem antiparallel a-helices extending over their entire length. The regular repeating relationship between TPRs is disrupted by two insertions in IFIT2 and IFIT5, so that the TPRs form three distinct subdomains producing a V-shaped clamplike structure (15) (16) (17) (18) . The concave surface of subdomain II, the 'pivot' helices between subdomains II and III and the N-terminal TPRs of subdomain III form a deep cylindrical cavity that is lined with positively charged residues (16) (17) (18) . Whereas IFIT5 is a monomer, IFIT2 forms a domain-swapped homodimer in a manner that may account for conformational switching of subdomains during binding of ligands (15) and for homo-and heterodimerization of human IFITs 1, 1B, 2 and 3 (10, 18) . The functional importance of homo-and heterodimerization of IFITs is unknown.",

A few IFIT genes, including human IFIT1B, lack ISRE-containing promoters and are not transcriptionally induced by IFN or dsRNA (11, 12) . Sequence similarity between the different IFIT proteins within a species is high (44-98% identity) (11), but they are differentially expressed depending on the cell and tissue type, respond differently to IFN and different viruses, and have different effects on replication of individual viruses, suggesting that different IFITs have non-redundant functions in the host response to viral infection (e.g. [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] .",

However, the principal antiviral function of IFITs is thought to involve inhibition of viral translation. Over-expression of human IFIT1 in HT1080 cells reduced overall translation by $40%, and addition of recombinant human IFIT1 and IFIT2 abrogated cap-dependent translation in rabbit reticulocyte lysate (RRL) (29) . Originally, their mechanism of action was reported to involve interaction with and impairment of the functions of eukaryotic initiation factor eIF3 (30, 31) , a large multisubunit factor that binds to the ribosomal 40S subunit and promotes recruitment of mRNA and the eIF2GTP/initiator tRNA (Met-tRNA i Met ) ternary complex (32, 33) .

Non-specific binding of IFIT5 to a variety of short cellular RNAs, including initiator tRNA, has also been reported (17, 34) .

Two independent groups have recently reported specific interaction of human IFIT1 with cap0-RNAs (35, 36) . These latter reports support our current finding, using a novel equilibrium-based binding assay, that human IFIT1, rabbit IFIT1 and rabbit IFIT1B specifically bind to cap-proximal regions of cap0-mRNAs with very high affinity (K 1/2,app $ 9 to 23 nM). This enables them to compete efficiently with eIF4F and thus to inhibit translation initiation on cap0-mRNAs through sequestration. Molecular modeling and mutagenesis of human IFIT1 suggest that the ppp moiety of cap0 interacts with an extended cleft leading to a pocket that binds the N7-methylguanosine portion of the cap Figure 1 .

Whereas the specific and stable interaction of IFIT1 with cap0-mRNA may account for its ability to inhibit translation and thus impair replication of specific viruses, the observation that IFIT1B, which lacks an ISRE-containing promoter and is not transcriptionally induced by IFN or dsRNA, also binds cap0-mRNAs suggests that it might regulate translation of specific cellular mRNAs in circumstances that are unrelated to the innate immune response.",

Extensive purification of the active component ( Figure 1D , left panel) yielded an apparently homogenous $55 kDa protein ( Figure 1D , right panel), which was identified as IFIT1B (Supplementary Table S1 ). To determine whether this mRNA-binding activity was specific for rabbit IFIT1B, the following members of the IFIT family were expressed and purified in recombinant form: human (h) IFIT1, IFIT2, IFIT3 and IFIT5, and rabbit (r) IFIT1 and IFIT1B ( Figure 1E ). Attempts to express recombinant hIFIT1B did not yield a soluble protein. To investigate the influence of the nature of mRNA nucleotides on IFIT/mRNA binding, five mRNAs with different 5 0 -terminal sequences were employed: b-globin(G) and b-globin(A) mRNAs with a 5 0 -terminal guanosine or adenosine, respectively, GCN4 mRNA, ATF4 mRNA and Sncb (beta-synuclein) mRNA ( Figure 1B) .",

Although the +7 nt stop was the most prominent in all cases, the intensity of additional stops at flanking +6 and +8 positions differed: the strongest stop at +8 nt was induced by rIFIT1, whereas the +6 nt stop was most obvious in the case of hIFIT1 ( Figure 1G ). This subtle difference suggests that the strength of the mRNA/IFIT interaction at the 3 0 -border of the interacting mRNA region varies between the three IFITs. In the case of rIFIT1B, additional low-intensity toe-prints were also observed at +12\u00c014 positions. Binding of hIFIT1 and rIFIT1 was specific for cap0-b-globin(G) mRNA: no RT arrest was observed on cap1-b-globin(G) mRNA in their presence ( Figure 1F , middle panel). rIFIT1B, on the other hand, was able to induce a +7 nt toe-print on cap1-bglobin(G) mRNA, but with only half the efficiency of that observed on cap0-b-globin(G) mRNA ( Figure 1F , compare middle and top panels). On b-globin(G) mRNA containing a 5 0 -terminal ppp, a prominent toeprint at the +7 position was observed in the presence of hIFIT5, whereas hIFIT1, rIFIT1 and rIFIT1B induced only trace-level stops at this position ( Figure 1F , bottom panel). Interestingly, toe-prints induced by hIFIT1 on cap0-b-globin(G) mRNA, and to a greater extent toeprints induced by rIFIT1B and hIFIT5 on cap1-and on 5 0 ppp-b-globin(G) mRNAs, respectively, were sensitive to elevation of [Mg 2+ ] above 6 mM during the primer extension stage, which most likely indicates that at these [Mg 2+ ], RT displaces these IFITs from mRNA (PK, TRS and TVP, unpublished data). No specific toe-prints were observed in the presence of hIFIT2 and hIFIT3, irrespective of the structure present at the 5 0 -end of mRNA ( Figure 1F , all panels). Consistently, hIFIT1, rIFIT1 and rIFIT1B, but not hIFIT2, hIFIT3 and hIFIT5 crosslinked to [ 32 P]cap-labeled cap0-b-globin(G) mRNA ( Figure 1H ). Despite sequence differences in the 5 0 -terminal region of the various tested cap0 mRNAs ( Figure 1B) , hIFIT1, rIFIT1 and rIFIT1B specifically interacted with them all (shown for rIFIT1B in Figure 1I ). Interestingly, the m 7 GpppG and m 7 GpppA dinucleotides were only weak competitors of IFIT/cap0-mRNA binding (with m 7 GpppG being slightly stronger than m 7 GpppA) (shown for rIFIT1B in Figure 1J ), suggesting that the IFIT/cap0-mRNA interaction extends over several cap-proximal nucleotides.",

Importantly, primer extension is performed under conditions of binding equilibrium, which represents a significant advantage of this method over non-equilibrium techniques such as the EMSA. Moreover, in the primer extension assay, unbound and IFIT-associated mRNAs yield sharp, distinct signals that could be quantified with high confidence. In all cases, sigmoidal binding curves were obtained. All tested IFITs bound to cap0-b-globin(G) mRNA very tightly (Figure 2A-C) , with similar affinities: K 1/2,app = 23 \u00b1 4 nM for hIFIT1, K 1/2,app = 20 \u00b1 1 nM for rIFIT1 and K 1/2,app = 9 \u00b1 2 nM for rIFIT1B. The values of Hill coefficients n > 1 (n = 1.6 \u00b1 0.1 for hIFIT1, n = 1.7 \u00b1 0.2 for rIFIT1, and n = 1.8 \u00b1 0.2 for rIFIT1B) suggested some positive cooperativity in each instance. The affinities of rIFIT1B for cap1-b-globin(G) mRNA ( Figure 2D ; K 1/2,app = 457 \u00b1 24 nM) and of hIFIT5 for 5 0 ppp-bglobin(G) mRNA ( Figure 2E ; K 1/2,app = 372 \u00b1 21 nM) were similar, but were more than one order of magnitude lower than those of hIFIT1, rIFIT1 and rIFIT1B for cap0-b-globin(G) mRNA. No measurable stable binding to 5 0 ppp-b-globin(G) mRNA was observed for hIFIT1 and rIFIT1 at concentrations of up to $1.4 mM (Supplementary Figure S1 ).",

In native gel electrophoresis (Supplementary Figure S2) , the highest degree of oligomerization was observed for rIFIT1B. hIFIT2 migrated as a dimer consistent with a previous report (15) . hIFIT3 also showed a high tendency to dimerization, whereas dimerization of hIFIT1 was lower, and hIFIT5 and rIFIT1 were mostly monomeric.",

The mobility of different IFIT/cap0-RNA complexes was consistent with the tendency of the particular IFIT to oligomerize (Supplementary Figure S2) . Thus, increasing hIFIT1 concentrations resulted in the progressive appearance of a slower migrating complex, likely corresponding to hIFIT1 dimers ( Figure 2F , first panel from the left), whereas no dimers were observed in the case of rIFIT1 ( Figure 2F , second panel from the left). rIFIT1B, on the other hand, did not form monomeric complexes, and even at the lowest concentrations migrated as a dimer, with the recombinant form having a stronger tendency to oligomerize at higher concentrations and to form high molecular weight complexes that migrated close to the start ( Figure 2F , third and fourth panels from the left). Again, as in primer extension experiments ( Figure 1F ), no binding to cap1-RNA was observed for hIFIT1, rIFIT1, hIFIT2, hIFIT3 and hIFIT5, and only a small amount of complexes formed in the case of rIFITB at the highest concentration of the protein ( Figure 2G ).

Although N7-methylation was not essential for binding by any of the IFITs ( Figure 3A -C), differences between them were nevertheless observed. Thus, at lower concentrations, binding of hIFIT1 to unmethylated cap0-globin(G) mRNA appeared to be more efficient, but in contrast to binding to methylated mRNA, did not reach saturation at higher concentrations ( Figure 3A) , likely due to a greater degree of displacement of IFIT by RT, which prevented accurate determination of the binding constant. In contrast, binding of rIFIT1 to unmethylated cap0-globin(G) mRNA was weaker (K 1/2,app = 81 \u00b1 5 nM) than to the methylated equivalent ( Figure 3B ). The highest dependence on N7-methylation was observed for rIFIT1B, which bound to unmethylated cap0-globin(G) mRNA with the lowest K 1/2,app of 340 \u00b1 15 nM ( Figure 3C ).",

Although IFIT/ mRNA complexes (particularly rIFIT1B/cap1-mRNA and hIFIT5/5 0 ppp-mRNA complexes) were sensitive to dissociation by RT at high Mg 2+ concentrations, the toe-printing stage in these experiments was nevertheless performed at an elevated Mg 2+ concentration in order to 'freeze' 48S complexes after their assembly. As a result, toe-prints corresponding to rIFIT1B/cap1-mRNA and hIFIT5/5 0 ppp-mRNA binary complexes were not apparent in these experiments. At 800 nM, hIFIT1, rIFIT1 and rIFIT1B nearly abrogated 48S complex formation on cap0-b-globin(G) mRNA, whereas hIFIT2, hIFIT3 and hIFIT5 did not influence the level of 48S complex formation ( Figure 4A ). In addition, consistent with their binding to cap1-and 5 0 ppp-mRNAs ( Figures 1F, 2D and E) , rIFIT1B and hIFIT5 strongly inhibited 48S complex formation on cap1-b-globin(G) and 5 0 ppp-b-globin(G) mRNAs, respectively ( Figure 4B and C). Thus, the ability of different IFITs to inhibit 48S complex formation on a specific mRNA correlated with their ability to interact with its 5 0 -terminal region ( Figures 1F and 2A-E) . Titration experiments showed that 48S complex formation on cap0-b-globin(G) mRNA was sensitive even to low concentrations of hIFIT1, rIFIT1 and rIFIT1B ( Figure 4D and E), whereas inhibition of 48S complex formation on cap1-bglobin(G) and 5 0 ppp-b-globin(G) mRNAs by rIFIT1B and hIFIT5 required higher protein concentrations ( Figure 4F and G) (quantitative comparison shown in Figure 4H ). Notably, the IC 50 for IFIT1B on cap1-bglobin(G) was $2-fold lower than would be anticipated on the basis of the K 1/2,app , which suggests that in this particular case, primer extension might have yielded an underestimated K 1/2,app value due to protein displacement by RT.",

E33 of hIFIT5 interacts with an ion, likely Mg 2+ , that bridges the aand g-phosphates of 5 0 ppp-RNA (16), and substitution by Ala of the equivalent D34 in hIFIT1 abrogated its ability to bind to cap0-bglobin(G) mRNA (as evidenced by the disappearance of the toe-print at the +6\u00c07 positions; Figure 5C ) and to inhibit 48S complex formation ( Figure 5D ). This D34A substitution in hIFIT1 and to a lesser extent the analogous E33 substitution in hIFIT5 inhibited their binding to 5 0 ppp-RNA (16) . In hIFIT5, K257 and R260 make a salt bridge with the 5 0 -phosphate of the third nucleotide and are required for binding to 5 0 ppp-RNA (16, 18) . Similarly, K259E and R262E substitutions of equivalent residues in hIFIT1 abrogated its ability to bind to cap0-bglobin(G) mRNA and to inhibit 48S complex formation ( Figure 5C and D) . The neighboring R263E mutation also impaired the activity of hIFIT1 ( Figure 5C and D) . Thus, the residues that are involved in the interaction of IFIT5 with 5 0 ppp-RNA are also critical for binding of cap0 mRNA by IFIT1. The second set of mutations targeted residues (F45, Y50, W147 and Y218), which could participate in formation of a hypothetical pocket for accommodation of N7methylguanosine ( Figure 5A, right bottom panel) . W147L and Y218A substitutions completely abrogated the ability of hIFIT1 to bind to cap0-b-globin(G) mRNA and to inhibit 48S complex formation ( Figure 5C and D) . Interestingly, hIFIT1 mutants containing F45A or Y50A substitutions at the top of the RNA binding cleft produced only weak toe-prints at the +6\u00c07 position ( Figure 5C ), but strongly inhibited 48S complex formation ( Figure 5D ), suggesting that they can bind cap0 RNA almost as efficiently as the wt protein but are more readily displaced by RT during toe-printing. The double mutation F45A/Y50A nearly abrogated the ability of hIFIT1 to bind to cap0-b-globin(G) mRNA and to inhibit 48S complex formation ( Figure 5C and D) . Although it cannot be strictly excluded that substitution of these hydrophobic residues could influence the structure of the pocket or even the protein, we note that these Figure S4) . Taken together, the results of mutational analysis confirmed that the same RNA binding cleft in hIFIT1 is responsible for binding both 5 0 ppp-and cap0-RNAs, and revealed that both hydrophobic and charge-charge interactions within the cleft contribute to optimal cap0-RNA binding.",

One obvious exception to the conserved character of the RNA binding cleft is the presence of R38 in hIFIT1 as compared to T37 at an analogous location in hIFIT5 ( Figure 5A , right middle panel). In the IFIT5/RNA complex, T37 stabilizes K150, which interacts with the 5 0 ppp at both the b and g positions: both residues are essential for binding of IFIT5 to 5 0 ppp-RNA (16) . An R38A substitution abrogated the ability of hIFIT1 to bind to cap0-b-globin(G) mRNA and inhibit 48S complex formation ( Figure 5C and D) . The position of R38 might enable it to support an interaction between hIFIT1 and cap0 in which the location of the ppp moiety is distinct from that in the hIFIT5/5 0 ppp-RNA co-crystal structure. Moreover, the absence in IFIT1 of the stabilizing influence of a Thr residue at this location may free K151 (homologous to K150 in hIFIT5) to contribute to interaction with the ppp in the new trajectory.",

Interestingly, both mutations (but particularly K417A) increased the relative prominence of the +6 nt toe-print, indicating that these residues could be involved in IFIT1's interaction with nucleotides that are more distal from the 5 0 -end.

Interestingly, inclusion of eIF2 in a reaction mixture with Met-tRNA i Met and rIFIT1B resulted in a specific supershift ( Figure 6B ), suggesting the possibility of simultaneous interaction of rIFIT1B and eIF2 with the same tRNA molecule, or of direct interaction between eIF2 and rIFIT1B.",

The exact affinity for the cap of eIF4E as a subunit of eIF4F has not been determined, but it appears not to contribute significantly to the overall affinity of eIF4F for mRNA, because the apparent dissociation constants for binding of eIF4F to capped and uncapped mRNAs differ only slightly (18 \u00b1 7 nM and 23 \u00b1 7 nM for b-globin mRNA, respectively) (51) . Although the overall affinity of eIF4F for mRNA is similar to that of IFIT1 and IFIT1B, IFITs strongly outcompete eIF4F for binding to cap0 mRNA. This suggests that the affinity of eIF4E bound to eIF4G within the eIF4F complex for the cap-terminal region of RNA is still substantially lower than that of IFIT1 and IFIT1B.",

However, sandwiching between aromatic and aliphatic residues has also been reported (e.g. W175/L206 in the scavenger decapping enzyme Dcps) (57) . N7-methylation of guanine results in delocalization of the positive charge on the base in its cationic form, which enhances the interactions with the p-electrons of the stacked aromatic rings (58, 59) , accounting for the specificity of binding to the N7-methylated cap over its unmethylated counterpart. In most instances, the enhancement of binding by N7-methylation is strong, amounting to 2 to 3 orders of magnitude for eIF4E (60), eIF4E3 (49) and CBC20 (61) .

However, any speculation concerning potential stacking interactions involving these residues is premature because considerable conformational change occurs in IFIT5 as a consequence of its binding to 5 0 ppp-RNA (16) , and might similarly accompany binding of cap0-RNA to IFIT1. Although N7-methylation enhanced the affinity of IFIT1 and IFIT1B for cap0-RNA by only $3.5 -and $10-fold, respectively, these modest increases are not unprecedented, as a similar 5-fold enhancement was reported for the influenza PB2 polymerase subunit (56) . Low dependence on N7-methylation suggests that interactions other than with m 7 G contribute significantly to the affinity of IFIT1 and IFIT1B to cap0-RNAs. The affinity of several cap-binding proteins to capped mRNA is known to be enhanced by cap-proximal nucleotides. Thus, binding of CBC20 to the cap is enhanced by the first 2 nt, and influenza PB2 requires at least 4 nt for efficient interaction and binds even more strongly if 9 nt are present (62) . Based on the arrest of RT at positions +6\u00c08 nt from the 5 0 -end on the IFIT1/cap0-RNA and IFIT1B/cap0-RNA complexes, the interaction of IFIT1 and IFIT1B with mRNA also involves at least 4-5 nt, which is in turn consistent with the number of nucleotides that are observed to interact with IFIT5 in the co-crystal structure (16) .",

The observed competition between initiator tRNA and cap0-mRNA for binding to IFIT1 and IFIT1B is consistent with this model. Although initiator tRNA was the best competitor, the fact that other tested elongator tRNAs were also able to interfere with the binding of IFITs to cap0-mRNA is indicative of the low specificity of IFIT/tRNA binding. hIFIT1 and rIFIT1B were also able to interact with 40S subunits, which could potentially involve a non-specific interaction between exposed elements of 18S rRNA and the tRNAbinding regions of these IFITs. In any case, this interaction is not very strong since both IFITs were bound to 40S subunits in sub-stoichiometric amounts.

The strongest inhibition was mediated by IFIT1 and IFIT1B on cap0-mRNA, followed by IFIT1Bmediated inhibition on cap1-mRNA, and then by inhibition on 5 0 ppp-mRNA by IFIT5. Other combinations of IFITs and mRNAs did not exhibit any inhibition. Taking the level of inhibition into account, suppression of initiation on cap0-mRNAs by IFIT1 and IFIT1B is likely to be physiologically the most important. The abundance of IFIT1 and IFIT1B and their ability to competitively inhibit binding of eIF4F to cap0-mRNAs form the basis of a mechanism for regulation of translation of any mRNA that has a 5 0 -terminal cap0. The lack of specificity of the IFIT1(IFIT1B)/cap0-mRNA interaction differentiates this mechanism from others that sequester the cap of specific mRNAs to prevent their functional interaction with eIF4F, such as the enhanced binding of the Drosophila 4 E-homologous protein (d4EHP) to the 5 0 -terminal cap of Caudal mRNA by Bicoid (which binds d4EHP and the 3 0 UTR of Caudal mRNA) (63) , and of eIF4E to the cap of Oskar mRNA by Cup (which interacts with eIF4E and the Oskar 3 0 UTR-binding protein Bruno) (e.g. 64) .",

Viruses such as Sindbis virus do not encode a 2 0 -O-methyltransferase, and their cap0-mRNAs are therefore strong candidates for inhibition by IFIT1 and IFIT1B. Consistently, Sindbis virus replication was impaired by over-expression of IFIT1 and enhanced by its siRNA-mediated silencing (21) . Moreover, the absence of IFIT1 in Ifit \u00c0/\u00c0 mice and murine embryonic fibroblasts and macrophages enhanced replication of 2 0 -O-methylation-defective mutant forms of human coronavirus 229 E and mouse hepatitis virus (family Coronaviridae), poxvirus (family Poxviridae), West Nile virus and Japanese encephalitis virus (family Flaviviridae), which are normally very sensitive to innate immune responses (22, 35, (70) (71) (72) . For most viruses, the enzymes that catalyze N7-methylation and 2 0 -O-methylation of viral mRNA are part of either a multi-domain protein or a 'cap assembly line', and the reactions are consequently tightly coupled (2) . However, in some instances they may be temporally separated, for example if they are catalyzed by enzymes that function in a defined order (such as the SARS-coronavirus nsp14 guanine-N7-methyltransferase and nsp10/nsp16 nucleoside-2 0 -O-methyltransferase) (73) . In such cases, it would hypothetically be possible for IFIT1 to sequester viral mRNAs after synthesis of cap0 but before completion of cap1 formation.",

            "text": "Inhibition of translation of cellular mRNAs by IFIT1 would also require the presence of 'cap0' at their 5 0 -termini. Formation of cap0 is a co-transcriptional process, and mRNAs that lack the N7-methyl moiety are recognized as being incorrectly capped and are degraded (74) , whereas correctly capped mRNAs are sequentially methylated at the 2 0 -hydroxyl position of the first and second transcribed riboses by nuclear and cytoplasmic cap-specific 2 0 -O nucleoside RNA methytransferases, respectively, yielding cap1 and cap2 structures (e.g. 75) . If there were a failure of capping to proceed beyond cap0 formation, the resulting mRNAs would be susceptible to regulation by IFIT1, and it is conceivable that IFIT1 might function as part of a complex that detects and degrades incompletely capped mRNAs. However, cap0-mRNAs appear to be stable, at least in some circumstances, since stored maternal mRNA in Xenopus oocytes undergo maturation-dependent 2 0 -Omethylation, which is thought to contribute to their translational activation (76) (77) (78) . Temporal separation of cap formation and 2 0 -O-methylation could thus occur in a regulated manner. The 2 0 -O-methylation to form cap1 has only a modest effect on ribosomal recruitment per se (79) , so that its suggested role in translational activation could potentially reflect relief from IFIT-mediated repression rather than direct enhancement. Another circumstance that leads to the accumulation of uncapped mRNAs involves the regulated decapping and partial removal of the 5 0 UTR from mRNAs in the cytoplasm. It has recently been determined that these mRNAs can undergo cytoplasmic recapping by an as-yet unidentified enzyme. This process would yield mRNAs lacking",
