We identi\u00aeed amino acids involved in a serotype speci\u00aec, conformationally dependent epitope by analysis of the S1 gene of 13 monoclonal antibody-neutralization-resistant mutants. Substitutions in the predicted amino acid sequence of these mutants were located at residues 304 and/or 386. Most of the substitutions at residue 304 were from threonine to isoleucine, whereas the substitutions at residue 386 were from arginine to proline, histidine, cysteine, or tryptophan. Based on this data, it appears that AA residues at 304 and 386 on the S1 glycoprotein are involved in a virus neutralizing serotype speci\u00aec epitope.",

The chorioallantoic sac of 11-day-old developing chicken embryos was inoculated with 0.2 ml of the mixture, and incubated for 48 h at 37 C in a humidi\u00aeed incubator. Chorioallantoic\u00afuid was collected, and diluted 1:100 with growth medium. Ten-fold serial dilutions of Mab 1318 were mixed with an equal volume of chorioallantoic\u00afuid, and incubated at 25 C for 1 h. The mixture was inoculated on a monolayer of CEKC, and incubated at 37 C for 1 h before the agar overlay was added. Plaques were suspended in 0.5 ml media, and stored at \u00c070 C. Some Mab-NR mutants were plaque-puri\u00aeed twice before viral stocks were made in CEKC.",
