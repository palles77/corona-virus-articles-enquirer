Data were analyzed using chi-square tests for unadjusted analyses and multivariable logistic regression for adjusted analyses.

Among these 2,207 children, 1,302 (59%) were RSV+, 287 (13%) had RSV/ rhinovirus coinfection, and 277 (13%) were rhinovirus+. There were 341 (15%) children with non-RSV and non-rhinovirus infections or no identified viral infection that were excluded from the current analysis. As shown in Table I , children positive for rhinovirus were more likely to be older, have a history of wheezing and a history of eczema. No differences were observed with respect to parental history of asthma. Children with rhinovirus were also more likely to receive systemic corticosteroids in the ED and during the current hospitalization. In a multivariable model controlling for age, sex, race, history of wheezing, history of eczema, treatment with inhaled corticosteroids in the past week, and clustering by site, children with rhinovirus were more likely to be prescribed systemic corticosteroids in the ED and the hospital than children who were RSV+ (OR 2.48; 95% CI 1.62 -3.78; P<0.001). Children with RSV/rhinovirus coinfections did not have a higher odds of being prescribed corticosteroids than children who were RSV+ (OR 1.43; 95% CI 0.83 -2.48; P=0.20).

Furthermore, in the multivariable model, children hospitalized with rhinovirus-associated bronchiolitis were more likely to be treated with systemic corticosteroids even after controlling for age, sex, race, history of wheezing, eczema, and inhaled corticosteroid use. This differential treatment of children with rhinovirus-associated bronchiolitis by clinicians at academic medical centers across the US is an implicit acknowledgement by these treating clinicians that they consider bronchiolitis to be a heterogeneous respiratory illness. The next step is to determine if there are identifiable subgroups of children with bronchiolitis (eg, rhinovirus positive, history of wheezing) who may respond differently to medications (eg, albuterol, systemic corticosteroids) or who may need closer long-term follow-up given their potentially higher risk of having asthma.",

Based on the present data, these inclusion criteria may have created fairly homogenous study populations of children with RSV bronchiolitis. Although RSV is the most common viral etiology of severe bronchiolitis and the results of these well conducted studies remain valid, the present data in combination with other reports [2, [6] [7] [8] suggest that these large-scale studies probably should be repeated in children with rhinovirus-associated bronchiolitis. A change in practice for this sub-group would affect the short-term outcomes of an estimated 25,000 US children age <2 years hospitalized annually with rhinovirus-associated bronchiolitis and many more world-wide [1] .",
