Binding constant, number of binding sites, and thermodynamic parameters at different temperatures were measured. Results of fluorescence quenching and synchronous fluorescence spectroscopy in combination with three-dimensional fluorescence spectroscopy showed that changes occurred in the microenvironment of tryptophan residues and the molecular conformation of pepsin. Molecular interaction distance and energy-transfer efficiency between pepsin and NIC were determined based on F\u00f6rster nonradiative energy-transfer mechanism. Furthermore, the binding of NIC inhibited pepsin activity in vitro. All these results indicated that NIC bound to pepsin mainly through hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonds at a single binding site. In conclusion, this study provided substantial molecularlevel evidence that NIC could induce changes in pepsin structure and conformation.",

Pepsin has a single polypeptide enzymatic chain containing 324 amino acid residues and a molecular mass of 35 000 Da [8] . Pepsin is a member of the large family of aspartic proteases, which are of significant medical and pharmaceutical interest because several of these enzymes have important roles in the development of various human diseases, formation of gastric ulcers, HIV maturation, and use as prognostic tools for breast-tumor invasiveness [9] . The drug interacts with pepsin when upon entering the stomach [10] . Several reports on the interactions of several molecules with pepsin have been published [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] . Recently, Esra Maltas [16] reported the interactions of NIC with several proteins, including human serum albumin, hemoglobin, and globulin. However, to the best of our knowledge, only a few studies focused on the interaction behavior between NIC and pepsin.

Notably, charge density was mainly accumulated on the benzene ring and carbonyl group in the HOMO and LUMO. In addition, a significantly large disparity in the distribution of electric charge between HOMO and LUMO was observed. When NIC binds to the amino acid residues of pepsin by charge transfer, the benzene ring and carbonyl group are the main binding groups. Moreover, the binding forces may presumably be \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking or hydrogen bonding. In light of the weak interaction of NIC with pepsin, the ester groups could be the main contributors to the hydrophobic binding force [15] . The results of quantum chemistry calculations can provide a theoretical basis of how to analyze the model of drug binding with pepsin.",

The changes in emission spectra can provide information on a molecule's structure and dynamics [26] . The fluorescence of pepsin is mainly due to tryptophan (Trp) and tyrosine (Tyr) residues. The maximum fluorescence intensities of the Trp and Tyr residues of proteins excited at 280 nm are approximately 340 and 300 nm, respectively [27] . The fluorescence spectra of pepsin at various NIC concentrations are shown in Fig. 3 . The fluorescence intensity of pepsin decreased regularly with the increase in NIC concentration, which indicated that NIC was bound to pepsin and affected the structure [10] . Moreover, NIC should be located at or near the Trp residues when it binds with pepsin.",

The different mechanisms of quenching are usually classified as either dynamic quenching or static quenching, which can be distinguished based on different dependencies on temperature and viscosity or preferably by lifetime measurements. Given that a higher temperature resulted in higher diffusion coefficients, the dynamic quenching constants will increase with increasing temperature. By contrast, the increase in temperature is likely to result in decreased stability of complexes. Thus, the values of the static quenching constants are expected to be smaller [22, 28] .

The intensity of the absorption peak at 278 nm increased with the addition of NIC for the ratio of the free drug to NIC-pepsin complex would be increased with increase of the drug concentration, and the absorption maximum exhibited a slight blue-shift toward the lower wavelength region (from 275 to 273 nm). Upon addition of NIC to the solution, the peaks in the far UV region (approximately 250 nm) of the pepsin-NIC complex increased, and the maximum peak position exhibited an evident blue-shift (from 257 to 251 nm) compared with a solution of pepsin at the lowest NIC concentration. The above results implied that as hydrophobicity increased, the peptide strands of pepsin were extended [45] , thereby inducing a conformational change in pepsin.

The shift in wavelength of the emission maxima \u03bb em corresponds to the changes of polarity around the chromophore molecule [11] . When the wavelength interval (\u0394\u03bb) between excitation and emission wavelengths is stabilized at 15 or 60 nm, synchronous fluorescence provides characteristic information on Tyr or Trp residues, respectively [46] . Generally, as the NIC concentration increases, the fluorescence of Trp residues exhibits a blue-shift (from 280 to 278 nm) upon addition of NIC, as shown in Fig. 9 . The blue shift of the emission maximum indicates that the hydrophobicity of the Trp residues increased and the Trp buried in the nonpolar hydrophobic cavities were moved to a more hydrophobic environment, resulting in an altered the conformation of pepsin in the presence of NIC [47] . On other hand, the hydrophobic interactions between NIC and Trp residues of pepsin have been enhanced [12] . However, no shift in the maximum emission wavelength occurred at \u0394\u03bb=15 nm, indicating that NIC has little effect on the microenvironment of Tyr residues in pepsin [48] . The above results indicated that NIC was closer to the Trp residues than to the Tyr residues and the microenvironments of Trp residues were more strongly affected by NIC than the Tyr residues.

Peak a represents the Rayleigh scattering peak (\u03bb em =\u03bb ex ), and peak 1 (\u03bb ex /\u03bb em =280 nm/336 nm) mainly reveals the spectral features of Tyr and Trp residues. When pepsin is excited at 280 nm, the intrinsic fluorescence of Trp and Tyr residues can be detected, and the fluorescence of Phe residue is negligible [10] .

The intensity of fluorescence spectra of NIC with pepsin at pH 2.0 decreased slightly as NaCl concentration increased (Fig. 11 ). This effect can be caused by an increase in the apparent dissociation constant due to the electrostatic screening of salt counterions on both NIC and pepsin [49] . On the other hand, even at a very high ionic strength, the fluorescence attenuation of NIC is still unremarkable, thereby suggesting that instead of electrostatic forces, hydrophobic interactions are mainly responsible for the interaction. The observed phenomenon was in accordance with the conclusion deduced from fluorescence data.",

The lowest energy ranked results of four NIC-pepsin conformations are listed in Table 3 . For all the simulated binding conformations, NIC binds with the pepsin cavity. Moreover, the exact binding sites of NIC on pepsin are different among the six conformations. The exact binding site of NIC on pepsin with the lowest binding free energy is shown in Fig. 12 . The docking revealed the most likely binding site in the enzyme. The interaction occurs in the area between domains I and III [11] , wherein NIC is surrounded by Asp-32, Asp-215, Thr-77, Tyr-75, Tyr-189, Gly-76, Ile-213, Ile-301, and Val-292. Hydrogen bonds exist between the phenolic hydroxyl of NIC and Asp-32 (with a distance of 1.903 \u00c5) and between the carbonyl group of NIC and Gly-76 (with a distance of 1.891 \u00c5) (Fig. 12c) . Moreover, NIC enters the hydrophobic cavity of pepsin via hydrophobic interactions between NIC and pepsin ( Fig. 12a and b) . The abovementioned results agree well with the aforementioned thermodynamic analysis. Thus, based on docking and synchronous fluorescence results, NIC bound directly to the enzyme cavity site, which subsequently influenced the microenvironment of the catalytic site.",

The activity of pepsin in the absence of NIC was set to 1, and changes in enzyme activity induced by the presence of different NIC concentrations were measured. As shown in Fig. 13 , pepsin activity changed evidently in the presence of NIC. As the NIC concentration increased, the relative pepsin activity significantly decreased. Moreover, 50 % of the relative pepsin activities was approximately 9.01\u00d710 \u22125 mol\u00b7L \u22121 . The results are consistent with the molecular docking and synchronous fluorescence results and indicated that NIC can inhibit pepsin activity.",

Fluorescence data showed that the fluorescence quenching mechanism of pepsin occurred mainly through static quenching. Quenching constants (K b ) were obtained using both fluorescence data and UV-vis spectra. Based on the results of thermodynamic parameters and molecular docking study, NIC could spontaneously bind with pepsin mainly through hydrophobic and hydrogen bonds. Results from the salt effect experiment suggest that hydrophobic interactions, not electrostatic interactions, are mainly responsible for the interaction. The distance between NIC and pepsin was sufficiently small (r=2.47 nm) to induce nonradiative energy transfer from pepsin to drug. The synchronous and three-dimensional fluorescence spectra confirmed that binding of NIC to pepsin induced some microenvironmental and conformational changes in pepsin molecules, which could cause inhibition of pepsin activity. The results obtained will be of biological significance for the transportation and distribution of NIC in vivo and beneficial for the investigation of the pharmacological function and dynamics of NIC.",
