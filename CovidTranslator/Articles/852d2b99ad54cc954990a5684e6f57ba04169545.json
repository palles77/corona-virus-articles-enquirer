However, changes of the environment interfere with many of the major determinants of biological warfare. Today, the most probable type and the key issue of biological war is bioterrorism. Bioterrorism itself is defined as a release of biological agents or toxins that affect human beings, animals, or plants with the intent to harm or intimidate. The essence of bioterrorism is a biological attack. Four components are required for a biological attack: perpetrators, agents, mediums/means of delivery, and targets.",

Considering these facts, it is practically impossible to have a unique doctrine for each eventual threat.

Environmental characteristics are defined as directly measurable physical, chemical, biological, or social components of the environments including populations and traits of relevant organisms. Every environmental perturbation influences the ecological balance and context within populations, in which disease manifests itself. Many outbreaks are interrelated to global and local changes caused by climate change, human-induced landscape changes, or the direct impact of human activities. Landscape impacts such as de(re)forestation, human settlement sprawl, industrial development, road construction (e.g., linear disturbances), large water control projects (e.g., dams, canals, irrigation systems, and reservoirs), and climate change have been accompanied by the spread of pathogens into new areas. Changing environmental process might affect transmission cycles of infectious pathogens. These changes affect the hosts or vectors of disease and the pathogens and parasites that breed, develop, and transmit disease. Vector-borne zoonoses tend to be the most ecologically complex infectious diseases in which environmental change may have the greatest number and diversity of effects, some promoting transmission and others diminishing it. Habitat and species losses may reduce the normal buffering within ecosystems, leading to disease outbreaks. Finally, the juxtaposition of new vectors, hosts, and parasites within disturbed ecosystems provides a potential for the evolution of novel transmission pathways and thus new 'emerging diseases.' It is needed to learn more about the underlying complex causal relationships and apply this information to the prediction of future impacts, using more complete, better validated, integrated, models.",

It is estimated that 75% of all emerging diseases stem from animal zoonoses. Habitat fragmentation causes a reduction in biodiversity within the host communities, increasing disease risk through the increase in both the absolute and relative density of the primary reservoir. Since urban growth in many countries occurs without planned sanitation, water treatment, and sewerage, increased exposure to mosquitoes, rodents, and other vermin provides more opportunities for diseases such as tuberculosis and hantavirus. Mining, damming of rivers, and increased irrigation for agriculture also give mosquitoes more standing water to breed in. Man, in so doing, makes himself his major bioterrorist. Carefully controlled use of resources would gain great benefits to struggle against bioterrorism, and other threats of natural pathogens. In the context of bioterrorism, infectious diseases are not only the public health issue, but also the issue of national and international security.",

Dangers associated with conventional agents can be enhanced by genetic modification (increased virulence, antibiotic resistance, toxin production, enhanced aerosol stability, and improved survival in the environment). Many infectious microorganisms considered suitable for bioterrorism could be obtained from natural sources, such as infected animals, patients, or even contaminated soil (anthrax spores). SARS-CoV-like viruses were isolated from Himalayan palm civets and a raccoon dog in an animal market in southern China, which suggests that SARS-CoV may originate from these or other wild animals. Since 2003, the highly pathogenic H5N1 strain of avian influenza A has spread to poultry in 17 countries in Asia and Eastern Europe and now is considered endemic in some of these countries. It is noted that pig's trachea contains receptors for avian and human influenza viruses and supports the growth of viruses of human and avian origin. Genetic reassortment between human and avian influenza viruses may occur in pigs leading to a novel strain against which there would be little or no population immunity and that would be highly pathogenic, capable of human-to-human transmission and having pandemic potential. In 2003, monkeypox virus emerged for the first time in the Western Hemisphere when an outbreak of human monkeypox occurred in the Midwestern United States. Most of the patients got sick by having direct contact with pet prairie dogs already infected by being housed with rodents imported from Ghana to Western Africa. In August 1999, West Nile virus was detected for the first time in North America by causing an outbreak in New York City. It is possible that the virus was imported to North America by infected birds, infected mosquitoes, or viremic humans. Natural pathogens widely vary in virulence; many strains isolated from nature may have low virulence. Microbiologists have catalogued more than 77 different strains of B. anthracis, only a minority of them being highly virulent. Considering this, a terrorist should almost certainly have to isolate many different strains before finding one sufficiently potent to be used as a weapon. Since obtaining virulent microorganisms from nature is technically difficult, it would probably be easier for a terrorist to steal well-characterized strains from any research laboratory or to purchase the known pathogenic strains from a national culture collection or a commercial supplier, claiming to be engaged in a legitimate biomedical research. From 1985 to 1989, Iraqi government ordered virulent strains of anthrax and other lethal pathogens from culture collections in France and the United States, ostensibly for public health research -a purpose that was legal at the time, and indeed approved by the Department of Commerce.",

            "text": "The medium of delivery could be air (airborne pathogens), and dissemination of an agent through ventilation/ air conditioning systems is a very powerful way of attacking by terrorists. Aerosolized release of 100 kg of anthrax spores upwind of Washington, DC, could result in approximately 130 000 to 3 million deaths, a weapon as deadly as a hydrogen bomb. Other means of delivery could be food and water (food-borne and waterborne pathogens) when human exposure to waterborne infections occurs by contact with contaminated drinking water, recreational water, or food. This may result from human action, such as improper disposal of sewage wastes, or be due to weather events. Heavy rainfall and runoff influence the transport of other microbial and toxic agents from agricultural fields, human septic systems, and toxic dumpsites. Rainfall can alter the transport and dissemination of microbial pathogens (such as cryptosporidium and giardia), and temperature may affect their survival and growth. This group includes infectious diseases for which the environment (e.g., food and water) plays a significant role in a pathogen's transmission cycle. Transmission occurs between humans and the environment directly (cholera, hepatitis A, enteroviruses, noroviruses, shigellosis). These pathogens survive in the environment for long periods of time. Fomites with personal infiltration of suicidal bio-bombers in the targets or by different facilities like mail might be a mean of delivery. Even animals, like birds infected with avian influenza, might serve as vectors for infectious diseases. In vector-borne diseases, transmission occurs through contact between humans and vectors (defined here as arthropods that take pathogens from one host to another). Transmission cycles share common attributes: namely, all are affected by the population level and vector, and all are driven by a transmission potential governed by a number of biological and environmental characteristics. Environmental changes can affect population levels of the host, vector (vector survival and reproduction), or environmental stage of the pathogen (pathogen's incubation rate within the vector organism) as well as the transmission rate (vector's biting rate) at which pathogens move between hosts, vectors, and environment. Vectors, pathogens, and hosts each survive and reproduce within a range of optimal climatic conditions: temperature and precipitation are the most important, although wind and daylight duration are also important. The recent crossover to humans of the Nipah virus is related to a host of changes that create more favorable conditions for their spread. Often fatal Nipah virus, normally found in Asian fruit bats, is believed to have passed over to humans when bats lost their habitats due to forest fires at Sumatra and the clearance of land for palm plantations. Trying to find new food, bats came into contact with pigs, which, in turn, passed the disease to their human handlers in the late 1990s. Nipah infection causes severe encephalitis in humans, with a 40% mortality rate recorded among infected patients in Malaysia and Singapore. At least 109 people died as a result of the epidemic, and more than one million pigs were destroyed in an effort to control the disease. Soil can also be the medium of transmission (B. anthracis, Giardia lamblia, Burkholderia mallei and pseudomallei, Co. burnetii).",

The US anthrax attack in 2001 comprised both types of attack: the Hart Senate Building in Washington was 'hard' and the US Postal Offices were 'soft' targets. The estimated cost of decontaminating parts of the Hart Senate building in Washington, DC, was $23 million, the economic impact involving potential exposure to anthrax was estimated at $26.2 billion/100 000 persons exposed (indirect/economic target), and the cost and resources needed to decontaminate the environment should be added to this. Health damage could be both somatic and psychological. Therefore, biological attacks cause two types of epidemics: epidemic of infectious disease and epidemic/ pandemic of fear and panic. Epidemic/pandemic of fear and panic multiplies economic damage (losses in tourism, investment, and export). Today, the main objective of bioterrorists is to propagate fear, anxiety, uncertainty, and depression within the population, induce mistrust of authorities/government, inflict economic damage, and disrupt travel and commerce. The cause of physical disease is the second important objective. Even the use of biological weapons for small-scale attack on 'soft' targets (airports, railway stations, food production industries) can bring about devastating losses with strategic dimensions. At least one case of SARS or avian influenza is enough to cause catastrophic economic consequences. The world airline industry lost $10 billion in 2003 due to SARS. The developed, Western countries have an intensive food production and centralized food industry. It means that only one successful bioterrorist action can contaminate huge amounts of food and threaten lives of thousands or hundreds of thousands inhabitants.",

Trade restrictions, however, decreased the value of Canadian livestock by $650 million, and the total economic impact due to international embargoes was about $2 billion. An outbreak of FMD in Italy in 1993 produced ten times higher costs in market disruption than in its eradication. In 1996, an FMD outbreak among swine in Taiwan caused the killing of 4 million hogs, and the long-term losses to swine-related industries were projected to reach $7 billion.

Disease outbreaks caused by the release of weapons-grade rinderpest virus or anthrax bacilli could have an even greater impact than historical examples might indicate, given the enhanced virulence and resilience of cultivated disease strains, and accelerated rates of dispersal of disease vectors and infectious materials by motor vehicles and aircraft. They could have disastrous consequences for endemic and endangered populations of wild and domestic ungulates within many areas of the globe. Once established in a new locality, introduced diseases may not be recognized rapidly and may be difficult or impossible to eradicate. Newly identified diseases and known, but formerly uncommon, diseases (Ebola and Marburg fever, and drug-resistant strains of tuberculosis) are emerging as major threats to human, livestock, and wildlife population as the result of progressive human-mediated changes in the ecology of host-pathogen and human-wildlife interactions. Breakdowns in medical and veterinary support systems during wars and civil conflicts have resulted in epidemic outbreaks of diseases within and among human, livestock, and wildlife populations (monkeypox, Marburg fever, Ebola, and bubonic plague). The Iran/Iraq War and the Arabian Gulf War precipitated rinderpest among livestock population in the region, probably caused or aggravated by war-related displacements of pastoralists and their flocks. Disruption of Government Veterinary Services during the Rhodesia-Zimbabwe civil war may have contributed to epizootic outbreaks of anthrax and rabies among wild and domestic animals in Zimbabwe. Anthrax mortality among humans and livestock reached epidemic proportions in 1979-80 and continued to proliferate for more than four years after the end of the war. Anthrax ultimately spread through six of the eight provinces of Zimbabwe, with 410 000 recorded human cases before effective control of the disease was finally reestablished in 1987. The threat of catastrophic impacts from disease epidemics resulting from agricultural bioweapon releases is proportionally higher in developing countries, due to severe limitations in the availability of doctors, veterinarians, and medical facilities for treatment and quarantine.",

The international reporting system for wildlife diseases initiated by OIE Working Group on Wildlife Diseases has thus been of great importance for alerting national veterinary services to the necessity for the monitoring and reporting of specified wildlife diseases. The threat of an agroterrorist attack can be countered at four levels: 1. at the organism level, through animal or plant disease resistance; 2. at the farm level, through facility management techniques designed to prevent disease introduction or transmission; 3. at the agricultural sector level, through disease detection and response procedures; 4. at the national level, through policies designed to minimize the social and economic costs of a catastrophic disease outbreak.",

The questions are: who would carry out such an attack and for what reasons; who has developed antiagriculture bioweapons in the past; who has actually used bioweapons against agriculture; and the technical requirements of an agroterrorist attack. To control the spread of disease, the exposed animals must also be destroyed. Control measures for zoonotic diseases result in efforts to eradicate certain wildlife species that are potential reservoirs, intermediate hosts, or vectors for disease transmission to humans or domestic animals. Wild species that are naturally rare, and species that have been severely depleted in numbers due to overharvesting or habitat degradation, are particularly at the risk of extinction from introduced diseases of domestic animals.",

Population of many wildlife species is already routinely subject to stringent control or local extirpation in attempts to control the transmission of diseases to domestic animals, in some instances without adequate data to validate the actual need for efficacy of such efforts. In the United States, the control of brucellosis in cattle has resulted in culling or attempted eradication of populations of bison (Bison bison), wapiti (Cervus canadensis), and white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus).
