This process is, however, biased and challenging to apply at large scales because (i) many viruses depend on host cells that are difficult to maintain as clonal culture in the laboratory, and (ii) even if the cells are available, propagating viruses may require specific conditions distinct from those used to cultivate the cells. These considerations are especially meaningful for viruses with microbial hosts, the vast majority of which remain uncultivated to date.",

Thus far, the history of viral metagenomics has seen two major phases. Initially, entire communities of viruses were assayed by analyzing and comparing short sequencing reads obtained from diverse environments. Because of the fragmented nature of these data, most of these studies had to be conducted at the community scale, and identifying and distinguishing individual viruses in these datasets remained challenging. More recently, bioinformatic advances have enabled the reconstruction of individual viral genome sequences from metagenomes, allowing naturally occurring viruses to be identified and studied at high, genomic resolution. Using a metagenomics approach, entirely new types of viruses can now be discovered, surveyed, and characterized even without cultivation. The unique ability offered by metagenomics to study uncultivated viruses led to the emergence of two parallel and interconnected fields: a clinical one, where metagenomics promises to be a catch-all method for the unbiased surveillance and diagnosis of viral pathogens, and one focused on natural biomes. that aims to describe the diversity of the viral world and understand its ecological and evolutionary drivers and impacts.",

While limited in scope and resolution, these and other early viromes provided an unprecedented view of complex viral communities in nature. Both oceanic and human fecal viromes pointed toward the existence of an extensive virus diversity. This diversity of the virosphere was estimated by comparing the sequencing reads within each metagenome, and observing that almost every fragment was unique. Moreover, comparing the short sequencing reads to a reference database of known viral genomes sequences revealed that up to 99% was not similar to any known virus, suggesting that most of the virosphere was yet to be discovered. This uncharted genomic biodiversity became popularly known as \"viral dark matter\".",

In addition, when sampled from the same freshwater and hypersaline ponds across several days, weeks, and months, viral metagenomes revealed that the genetic composition of viral communities was coherent at a broad level, but some individual viral genes experienced rapid changes in relative abundance.",

While micrograms of DNA were initially needed, several protocols are now available which only require B1 ng of DNA. In addition, a DNA/RNA random amplification step, called \"whole genome amplification\", can also be conducted in order to gather enough input material. This type of approach was initially used in almost every virome study, and revealed important information for example on the unsuspected diversity of ssDNA genome viruses in the environment (see below). However, the whole genome amplification process is inherently biased, and these datasets are not quantitative, i.e., one cannot draw any conclusion about the relative abundance of the viruses identified in these amplified metagenomes. Thus, whole genome amplification methods have now been often replaced by advanced library preparation protocols which require nanogram-scale input but enable quantitative datasets well suited for ecological studies. Alternatively, for cases in which target viruses represent a minor part of the templates, targeted sequence capture approaches have been used, mainly in a clinical framework as they can only be applied to viruses with known genomes but can detect these viruses with a very high sensitivity.",

For bulk metagenomes, viruses typically represent only a minor fraction of all sequences compared to cellular genomes. This means that the virus genomes obtained this way will tend to be restricted to abundant viruses found in their host cells, while viruses that are not infecting at the time of sampling, viruses with a low frequency of infected hosts, or viruses infecting rare hosts will likely be missed. Viromes provide a deeper description of the virus community, since most of the sequencing data will be obtained from virus genomes. In addition, virus particles will not represent only current infections but a more integrated sampling of all recent successful infections, the timing of which depending on the type of sample and the individual virus decay rate. Yet viromes still suffer from several biases. Notably, the size-based selection of virus particles excludes most of the larger viruses such as the \"giant viruses\", and viromes also tend to be dominated by viruses with high burst size while under-sampling viruses with low burst size and long infection time. All metagenomes (bulk and viromes) will struggle with very rare viruses, as well as hypervariable viruses which genome will not assemble well.

Virus discovery can be achieved through bulk metagenomes or viromes, while viral ecology studies will tend to rely more on viromes as a reflection of virus activity and transport, and metagenomics used as a diagnostic tool in the clinic would be the most likely to use sequence capture. Nevertheless, all these complementary approaches will be needed for achieving a comprehensive picture of viral diversity. specific assays for each pathogen. Metagenomics instead offers the possibility to detect known and novel viruses without prior knowledge from a single analysis, and is thus well suited and already applied to study emerging and/or rare viruses, as well as cases which remain negative using the available diagnostic tests (see below). A number of challenges remain however for viral metagenomics to become a standard clinical procedure. First, given the current cost associated with sample processing and sequencing, metagenomes are still more expensive and slower than ELISA's or qPCR assays. Second, there is no generally validated bioinformatics pipelines than can perform a rapid, sensitive, and specific analysis of the obtained data on a bench top computer. Finally, physicians will have to be trained and guided to deal with the obtained breadth of data. Specifically, it is becoming clear that each individual is chronically infected with a dozen or more eukaryotic viruses (many of which have not been associated with any disease, e.g., anelloviruses), and that many known viral pathogens can also cause asymptomatic infections. Therefore, a physician might get a list of viruses (and other potentially pathogenic or unknown organisms), and it will be a challenge to identify the actual cause of a particular disease. Nevertheless, the price of sample preparation and high throughput sequencing has declined enormously in the last decade including with the development of smaller and faster machines, while automatic virome Fig. 1 Overview of the viral metagenomics workflow. The overall process used to generate and analyze viral metagenomes can be divided into four major steps: (i) Collection of environmental and/or clinical sample, (ii) sample preparation, (iii) library preparation, and (iv) sequence analysis. The sample preparation step can target either the cellular fraction (left) or the viral fraction (right) in which case viral particles are often further concentrated and purified to remove free nucleic acids. *Targeted sequence capture can be applied to the extracted DNA/RNA to enrich for a specific virus. **While whole genome amplification was initially used routinely for viral metagenomes, it has now been supplanted by methods enabling the preparation of more quantitative libraries from low input (B 1 ng), hence whole genome amplification is now primarily used in single-cell or single-virus-particle experiments. ***The genome assembly can be bypassed if using long-read sequencing technologies, although these long-read datasets require a more careful error correction. ****Genome binning, i.e., the identification of multiple contigs assembled from a metagenome and corresponding to the same genome, is typically only used for large genomes (e.g., 4500 kb), and individual contigs are directly analyzed instead for most viruses.",

With viral metagenomics being applied to a larger set of samples and environments, and with bioinformatic analyses including genome assembly and interpretation constantly improving, novel groups of dominant and widespread viruses may thus be progressively revealed across many environments.",

Following the isolation and characterization of the first giant virus in 2004 (\"Acanthamoeba polyphaga mimivirus\"), around 50 other members of this group have been isolated, the vast majority by using an Acanthamoeba host. However, metagenome analyses suggest that the true diversity of giant viruses vastly exceeds the number of isolates.",

These initial studies were based on the detection of marker genes, since the technologies available at the time did not enable the assembly of complex and large genomes like those of giant viruses. More recently, four complete or nearcomplete giant virus genomes could be assembled from metagenomes of a wastewater treatment plant. This revealed a new subgroup of giant viruses named Klosneuviruses which comprised some genomes with the largest set of translation system components found at the time in any virus, including aminoacyl transfer RNA synthetases with specificity for all 20 amino acids. Undoubtedly, as our collective ability to assemble large genomes from metagenomes increases, the giant virus diversity will keep expanding.",

The latter saw the more striking expansion: until 2009, these viruses were known exclusively in plants and vertebrates, specifically pigs and birds, yet in less than a decade, CRESS DNA viruses were detected in metagenomes sampled from primates, arthropods, and unicellular protists, as well as diverse aquatic, terrestrial, and man-made ecosystems.

In addition, the assembly of complete genomes provided new insights on the recombination patterns of these viruses, highlighting a remarkable propensity of RNA viruses to exchange or acquire genes horizontally, both with other viruses and with their host.

In the field of viral metagenomics, this increased capacity has been leveraged specifically to analyze viral signal along time series and thus investigate virus-host dynamics in nature. Such datasets have notably been obtained from freshwater lakes, for which recurrent sampling across months or years can be done, and which usually harbor a high concentration of viruses. These first explorations of environmental viral diversity across months and seasons indicated that viruses display a large range of relative abundance patterns, from \"ephemeral\" ones with a single peak in abundance to \"constitutive\" ones detected in virtually all samples. Some of these patterns were seasonal and possibly linked to similar patterns of abundance for their microbial hosts, while other viruses displayed drastic changes from one year to the next. For instance, although longitudinal virome studies of the human gut are scarce, available data suggests a rather stable population of gut viruses (almost exclusively phages) in adults over time, whereas the infant gut virome is much more variable and may be dominated by eukaryotic viruses at particular time point coinciding with an acute enteric infection.",

The former approach already provided host prediction for several giant viruses that are so far known exclusively from metagenome assemblies, and suggested that these may be linked to uncultivated protist hosts. The latter raised the intriguing possibility of complex and diverse virus-host relationships occurring in nature: while the expected patterns would be a strong correlation between virus and host abundances with possibly a short lag in the virus signal in a typical predator-prey fashion, these large-scale metagenome time series instead suggested that some of the viruses could peak prior to a peak in abundance of their host, while other virus-host pairs showed no similarity in relative abundance at all. These conflicting results likely reflect the complex interactions at play between viruses and microbes in nature, including variable host ranges, from viruses infecting a unique host strain to others infecting multiple host species sometimes across different genera, as well as the spectrum of infection dynamics from fast-acting lytic viruses to slower, temperate, and even chronic ones, and the development of resistance to the virus among the host population. Despite these numerous challenges in their analysis, time series metagenomes are poised to become a key approach to complement laboratory experiments and untangle the intricate relationships between viruses and their hosts.",

First, metagenomes built from limited input material are still difficult to reliably obtain and interpret, and do not yet provide a comprehensive and quantitative view of the viral community present in the sample. This includes environments with low biomass such as some human tissues, hydrothermal vents, ice cores, or ancient samples, but also samples with a thick substrate or matrix to which cells and virus particles tend to adhere such as human lung mucus or coral samples. Improvement in the recovery of cells and virions from this type of substrates and in the generation of quantitative libraries from sub-nanogram input will help better survey these viral communities.",

In a clinical context, this means that one of Koch's postulates, which requires that the candidate etiological agent be isolated from a diseased organism and grown in pure culture, cannot be fulfilled. Already, several smacoviruses which had been detected in human samples metagenomes and suspected to represent new human viral pathogens have been found to likely infect prokaryotic cells from the human microbiome instead. In a similar way, evidence is emerging that picobirnaviruses, which are believed to be eukaryotic viruses, might actually infect bacterial cells. These examples should thus serve as a cautionary tale when trying to detect entirely new viral pathogens from mixed samples containing both human and microbial cells. A modified Koch's postulate for the metagenomic era has been proposed in which potential new pathogens must first be present and more abundant in the diseased subject compared to matched control. Then, experiments using either a sample from a disease subject or an artificial virus obtained through DNA synthesis and expression in cell cultures must be performed to demonstrate that this agent induces disease in another healthy subject. While not trivial, these additional experiments based on metagenomic results could still lead to the identification of viral pathogens much more quickly than classic culture techniques.",

First, long-read sequencing technologies are progressively amenable to the sequencing of environmental viral communities. Pragmatically, this means that instead of having to assemble virus genomes from short reads, a process which can yield potentially erroneous and/or incomplete genome sequences, a complete viral genome could be sequenced as a single read. Once broadly available, these long-reads metagenomes will not only bypass assembly issues but also provide valuable information about virus genome evolution by enabling whole-genome phasing of polymorphisms. Meanwhile, in an epidemiological context, long-read sequencing technologies associated with miniaturized devices, streamlined sample preparation, and live scanning of the sequencing results offers unique possibility for real-time surveillance or diagnostics. This is especially the case for the MinION sequencer based on Nanopore sequencing technology, allowing the identification of viral pathogens from a patient sample in less than 6 h, compared to more than 20 h for other sequencing technologies. The computational framework to analyze and share these types of data in a timely, safe, and meaningful way remains to be built, however it is likely that metagenomics through portable genome sequencers will become a major component of the epidemiological toolkit in the near future.",
