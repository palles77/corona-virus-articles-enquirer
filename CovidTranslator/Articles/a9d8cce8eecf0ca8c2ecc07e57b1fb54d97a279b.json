The purpose of this paper is to establish service industries as increasingly significant aspects of urban development within the Asia-Pacific, and to propose a conceptual and analytical framework for scholarly investigation within this important research domain. To this end the paper explores a sequence of related themes and issues, concerning the larger developmental implications of urban services growth (or tertiarization), the facets of urban transformation associated with tertiarization, and a preliminary typology of urban service functions which acknowledges the rich diversity of service vocations and stages of development within the Asia-Pacific. The paper concludes that \"advanced services\"-specialized, intermediate service industries, advanced-technology services, and creative service industries-will be quite crucial to the development of city-regions within the Asia-Pacific, with respect to employment growth and human capital formation, to the urban economic (or export) base, to the operation of flexible production systems, and to competitive advantage. The development of these urban service poles will require innovative policy commitments and regulatory adjustments, as will the multi-centred specialized urban service corridors which function as engines of regional economic growth, and which provide platforms for national modernization and responses to the pressures (and opportunities) of globalization. To date, urban and regional development strategies for service industries within the Asia-Pacific have privileged globalization, industrial restructuring, and modernization aims, but there is also an encouraging record of more progressive planning 0305-9006/$ -see front matter q (T.A. Hutton). experimentation in some jurisdictions, incorporating principles of sustainability and co-operative development. There is also increasing interest in policies to support cultural and creative industries among Asia-Pacific city-regions, informed by some recent urban policy experimentation in this domain. These experiences can offer models for further policy and programmatic innovation in the 21st century, as service industries continue to play larger roles in urban and regional development within the Asia-Pacific. q",

This phenomenon of sustained growth in services (both in absolute and relative terms) can be observed at the national level among OECD member countries in terms of the changing composition of gross domestic product (GDP) and employment, but is especially pronounced at the urban or city-region scale. Final demand service industries (for example retail, education, and most government services) are strongly tied to large metropolitan consumer markets, while intermediate services are even more spatially centralized, reflecting the influence of urban and agglomeration economies on the locational pattern of specialized, contact-intensive services. Following the protracted decline of traditional manufacturing, service industries have led employment growth among most advanced city-regions over the last three decades.",

At the broadest theoretical level we can discern intimate associations between service industries and redefining urban socio-economic processes and stylistic innovation over the past century. The growth of high-rise office complexes was an integral feature of the production of modernist urban landscapes, while advanced service industries have been central to the experiences of post-industrialism, flexible specialization, and post-modernism which have transformed urban landscapes, production sectors, and occupational structures over the past several decades. More particularly, service industries are directly involved in fundamental shifts in the urban economic base and industrial structure, but are also deeply implicated in the reconfiguration of regional structure, the metropolitan space-economy, and urban form. The rapid growth of service occupations among the most advanced post-industrial cities has also had profound implications for urban class structure and for the metropolitan social morphology, and is associated with the evolution of urban culture and even political preferences.",

The purpose of this paper is to propose a framework for investigating the influence of service industries on urban development within the Asia-Pacific, with an emphasis on dimensions of transformational change, both within the metropolis, and at the broader urban systems level. This entails an assessment of economic implications of tertiarization for cities and city-regions within the Asia-Pacific, including the emergence of new urban functions or vocations, and constituent shifts in the urban economic base, employment structure, and mix of industries. Advanced or specialized services-especially, banking and finance, business and trade services, professional and 'informational' service activities, among others-are increasingly associated with modernization aspirations among the region's post-industrial, late-industrial and transitional societies, as reflected in development strategies and programmes. However, the parameters of urban change within the Asia-Pacific associated with tertiarization extend beyond this economic dimension to encompass impacts of service industry growth on urban structure and form, the built environment, social class and social morphology: i.e. the comprehensive facets of transformation (and re-imaging) of cities increasingly engaged in advanced services production, exchange, trade and consumption.",

Accordingly, the analytical focus will be on service industries and activities which the research literature has identified as 'propulsive' in urban growth and development; i.e. intermediate (rather than final demand) services, specialized service industries, and knowledge-and technology-based or informational services. At the same time, the record of urban services growth within the Asia-Pacific region discloses wide variations in stages of services development and mixes of service activity from place to place, and this variegation must be acknowledged in the interests of presenting a more rounded perspective on the experience than an exclusive discussion of leading edge examples would allow. Indeed, some of the most interesting and instructive stories of urban tertiarization within the Asia-Pacific concern the juxtaposition of informal and advanced services in transitional societies, with ensuing social, land use, and planning conflicts.",

Defining elements of advanced urban tertiarization are identified, and are constituted within a taxonomy of global cities' service functions. The following section (Chapter 3) addresses both commonalities and contrasts in service industry developments among city-regions of the Atlantic and Pacific cores, and identifies five principal implications of service growth for urban change within the Asia-Pacific. These include the role of service industries in reshaping urban development trajectories, in the reconfiguration of urban space, and in urban social and cultural change, as well as the ramifications of accelerated tertiarization for the everyday experiences of city life and for urban identity and image.",

            "text": "The two final substantive chapters address planning issues and experiences associated with the development of the urban service sector. The first (Chapter 5) describes the basic evolution of local policy responses to urban tertiarization over the last quarter-century, from early development control policy regimes imposed to manage negative externalities of rapid service industry growth, to more balanced approaches, which combined developmental as well as regulatory elements. This chapter concludes with a set of important processes and events which have shaped a new policy environment for urban service industries in the early 21st century. Next, Chapter 6 extends this discussion, by introducing a framework of six strategic urban policy models which are deployed in cities within the Asia-Pacific, including experiments in progressive planning (co-operative regional development, sustainable city-regions), as well as familiar models associated with globalization and restructuring objectives. The paper concludes with suggestions for a research agenda, emphasizing developmental and transformational implications of service industry growth for city-regions within the Asia-Pacific. 1 There are of course different approaches to conceptualizing the units of 'world geography' apart from the standard continental divisions, as a spectrum of historical, socio-cultural, political and economic considerations can be imposed upon the standard geo-physical patterns. For much of the post-war period the idea of a tripartite structure of spheres organised crudely along ideological lines and developmental progress emerged as a descriptive convention, including a developed, essentially democratic-capitalistic 'first world', comprised of a hegemonic US bloc and its allies in North America, western Europe, Japan and Australia; secondly, the COMECON (Council for Mutual Economic Aid) group of nations, largely dominated by the USSR and concentrated within Eastern Europe and Asia, but also including Cuba; and, finally, a 'third world' of 'developing' countries, ostensibly non-aligned, but including many de facto client states of either the US or the USSR. With the collapse of the 'second' (COMECON) world 1989 (COMECON) world -1991 , and the increasing pluralism within the first and third worlds implied in the post-modern viewpoint, there has been a renewed interest in (re) conceiving global geography or world regional patterns. In this regard Lewis and Wigen acknowledge the tendency of world regional frameworks \"to grossly flatten the complexities of global geography\", but assert that \"some form of baseline heuristic scheme is necessary for teaching and thinking about metageography\" (Lewis and Wigen, 1997: 186) . To this end their conceptual preference is to ignore political and ecological boundaries, and to instead focus upon historical processes, to give primacy to \"the spatial contours of assemblages of ideas, practices, and social institutions that give human communities their distinction and coherence\" (Lewis and Wigen, 1997: 187) , and to consider not only internal attributes but external relations. See Martin W. Lewis Atlantic core, due in large part to earlier industrialization, and a longer record of tertiarization, but there is now a well-developed pattern of higher-echelon global cities within the Asia-Pacific (Rimmer, 1986; Preston, 1998) (Fig. 1) .",

The inexhaustible differentiation of regional histories, political traditions and structures of governance, culture and geographical and environmental factors are seen to underpin the persistence of variegation and exceptionalism among regions and localities within both the old and new cores. The confluence of exogenous forces, including the rise of MNEs, and increasing market integration and technological diffusion, has imposed some measure of developmental convergence and commonality across international space (as well as increasing disparities within urban social structures), but there are after all limits to the homogenizing effects of globalization, as the recent scholarly development literature attests. Without denying the impressive global sweep of MNEs and speculative capital, it is essential to acknowledge the significance of (largely) localized development influences, such as site and environment, the structures of social networks and civic institutions, and the quality of public policy and regulation.",

            "text": "In an insightful book aimed at 'reasserting the power of the local', a number of scholars enrich the discourse on globalization by an elucidation of factors which reaffirm the power of local identity, and which provide some friction to the movement of capital and firms. Storper, notably, asserts the significance of 'territorialization' in embedding some specialized forms of economic activity within specific locations, beyond the more generic considerations of urban agglomeration which can bind (especially contact-intensive) firms to central places, such as higher-order service enterprises which cluster within the corporate complex of the central business district (CBD). In this interpretation, a firm or activity is \"fully territorialized when its economic viability is rooted in assets (including practices and relations) that are not available in many other places and that cannot be easily or rapidly created in places that lack them\" (Storper, 1997: 21) . This concept of territorialization can also incorporate the quality of civic institutions and civil society as influences on economic development and socio-economic welfare, as disclosed in Putnam's seminal study of regional and community development in Italy (Putnam et al., 1993) . Other important factors of locality that can influence differentiation in patterns of economic growth and development are exemplified by amenity attributes, which may include access to education and learning opportunities, and community levels of tolerance and equity, as well as air and water quality, leisure, and recreational opportunities. Thus, the forces of globalization, as powerful and pervasive as they demonstrably are, may be significantly tempered, mitigated, or renegotiated at regional and local levels.",

This crisis, which delivered a major check to the continued growth and progress of many of the leading economies of the region, presents a complex set of economic, socio-cultural and political issues and underlying causes that vary widely from place to place, but certainly includes important structural factors (relating to governance, policy, regulation, and financial supervision), as well as more transitory or cyclical attributes (McLeod and Garnaut, 1998 ). An apparent recovery process can be discerned in some of the Asia-Pacific economies, but the experience is likely to be protracted and wrenching for many, as the (now decade-long) recession in Japan seems to attest. Sustained recovery (and, more pointedly, a shift from growth to development) will require major adjustments to the political structures of Asia-Pacific states, as well as to the governance of corporations and industrial enterprises, and to the supervision and regulation of banks and financial institutions. Both the depth and breadth of this economic downturn (and attendant social and political upheavals), and the quarter century or so of recurrent high growth levels that preceded it, raise questions concerning the contrasting trajectories of development within the mature Atlantic economies and those of the new core of the Pacific Basin, as well as the factors underlying these patterns of differentiation. 4",

Beyond the obvious reality that the leading states of both the Pacific and Atlantic spheres contain advanced industrial production sectors, and are experiencing growth in tertiary activity, it is important to acknowledge that while the growth of services represents a dominant motif of the economic and social reconstruction of western economies and societies, the accelerated growth of manufacturing industry and employment has been the principal story in the rise of the Asia-Pacific economies over the past four decades. Among the mature economies of the OECD, concentrated within the old Atlantic core, this same period has seen a massive contraction of production capacity and labour in basic industries, especially in Fordist mass-production manufacturing, manifested most dramatically by wrenching processes of industrial decline (consisting mostly of outright factory closures but also some measure of locational decentralization) within long-established inner-city industrial precincts of large-and medium-size cities, and consequent losses of employment, income and revenue (Noyelle and Stanback, 1984) . New industries characterized by flexible specialization processes and technology-intensive outputs have emerged in 'lead regions' and 'new production spaces' (Scott, 1988) within the Atlantic core, so aggregate manufacturing output has held up or even increased (by value) in some areas (Coffey, 1996) , but in general manufacturing activity has lost ground in relative terms in most OECD regions.",

            "text": "Over the past half-century, services have been essential features of the development of metropolitan cities (Gottmann, 1974) . More specifically, intermediate services have emerged as increasingly strategic and propulsive elements of advanced production systems, as observed in successive rounds of industrial restructuring, in new divisions of labour, and in the rise of service-based global cities and new urban service poles (Table 2) . At the same time, the post-war period has seen among the most advanced societies the sustained expansion of service industries which (with related shifts in industrial production processes) have profoundly changed the economic base, industrial mix, labour force, land use and physical form of city-regions within the Atlantic zone. Service sector growth has thus constituted a central feature of economic restructuring among advanced nations and regions, with service-type occupations leading employment formation not only in the tertiary and quaternary (or informational) sectors, but also in manufacturing, where the growth of management, clerical, sales and technical workers has exceeded that for direct production workers and operatives in most cases. 5 5 In general scholarly attention to the growth and development of service activities has evolved as follows: (a) an early interest in the growth of high-rise offices in the CBDs of the largest metropolitan cities, including important theoretical and conceptual contributions (Gottmann, 1961) , (b) a stream of empirical studies of office location, emphasizing regional policy implications and urban planning problems (Daniels, 1975; Goddard, 1975) , (c) growing interest in the social ramifications of services growth (Bell, 1973) , (d) a sharper analytical focus on business, 'producer' and other intermediate services, and their role in urban and regional development (Noyelle and Stanback, 1984) , and in the operation of 'flexible' industrial regimes, (e) assessments of the global dimensions of services development, especially in banking and finance, as well as in producer services and communications (Daniels, 1993 ), (f) acknowledgement of the importance of specialized services in the emergence of the 'informational city' and urban society (Castells, 1989) , and (g) explorations of the intersections between tertiarization, occupational shifts, urban class (re)formation, and community-level impacts, especially in the metropolitan core (Ley, 1996) . (1) Producer services as key to flexible specialization production regimes (Coffey) (1) Emergence of integrated sevice-technology-production systems (2) Internalized service production (2) Externalized service production (2) Globalized service production (3) But these structural consequences of tertiarization extend well beyond the economic dimension, as the sustained expansion of service labour (and concomitant decline in bluecollar workers) within the Atlantic core regions has led in turn to the reformation of urban society, in terms of social class, community and neighbourhood patterns, culture, and political values and preferences, as documented in scholarly treatments of post-industrial society (summarized in Table 3 (a)). The tight spatial bonding of specialized, contactintensive service industries within intricate input -output relations has been instrumental in the reformation of urban structure and land use within the metropolitan core (Gottmann, 1970; Hutton and Ley, 1987) . Tertiarization has also generated more comprehensive changes in metropolitan structure, as seen principally in the emergence of specialized service nodes and clusters which dominate the space-economies of advanced city-regions, and also in urban form and the built environment, exemplified in the growth of the central city corporate complex, new districts of services production and consumption on the CBD fringe and inner city (including design and technology-based services), regional office and retail centres, and proto-urban forms which incorporate advanced service industries within 'edge cities' (Garreau, 1991) 6 (Table 3(b)) .",

There is of course considerable variation in the temporal sequencing, specific industry emphasis, scale and stage of manufacturing growth among individual nations (and even among regions and sub-regions), but accelerated industrialization, supported in most cases by state policies and programmes, has been central to the expansion of every high growth Asian-Pacific state (Douglass, 1994) , including (1) the Japanese ascendancy, seen in the industrial development of the Japanese archipelago (especially within the principal conurbations of Honshu but also including urban centres in Kyushu and Hokkaido) over much of the present century, with accelerated development of production in industrial and consumer goods from the 1950s, including 6 See Garreau (1991) for an original contribution to our understanding of this spatial and socio-economic phenomenon. 7 I am making a broad distinction here between economic systems in which manufacturing or (alternatively) services are dominant. It is of course possible to perceive services as 'industrial activities', as detailed divisions of 'service industries' are conventionally depicted within sectoral aggregations in standard industrial classification catalogues, for statistical purposes. Moreover, there is a general preference for positioning service industries as co-dependent elements of integrated production systems (Gershuny, 1978) . At the same time, industrialization as a development paradigm within the Asia-Pacific has certainly implied a powerful emphasis on the growth of manufacturing industries, industrial companies and conglomerates, factories and industrial labour, in the form of factory workers, assembly line employment, and operatives. Jonathan Rigg's analysis of modernization and development in Southeast Asia includes a special chapter addressing the idea (and reality) of 'the factory world' as a defining feature of this experience (Rigg, 1997: 202-238) .

In addition to these important examples, industrialization also represents a goal (or ideal) of lagging states within the region, such as Laos, Burma and North Korea, although the realization of these industrial aspirations has been seriously impeded by a prejudicial m\u00e9lange of factors including war, flawed development models, governmental corruption and administrative incompetence, lack of capital and other resources, and isolation. These national industrialization programmes and trajectories also featured important urban and regional dimensions. By the 1970s, the Asia-Pacific sphere included a number of world-scale industrial metropoles, such as Tokyo, Nagoya, Osaka, Seoul, Taipei, Hong Kong and Shanghai, while by the 1980s manufacturing emerged as an important feature of the metropolitan space-economies of Southeast Asian primate cities, including Bangkok, Jakarta, Kuala Lumpur, and Manila (Douglass, 1989) . Beyond these large-scale urban industrial complexes, manufacturing activity increased within the metropolitan periphery, exurban areas, and even rural zones, for instance in the Lower Yangtze region, within the Chinese special enterprise zones (SEZs), within designated receptor areas (such as Penang) for Japanese foreign direct investment (FDI), and within desakota areas of East and Southeast Asia, proliferating the spatial milieux for industrial production in the region.",

Over the past two decades, Los Angeles, the San Francisco Bay area, Seattle and even Vancouver have experienced significant growth in advanced manufacturing such as aerospace and electronics (and in some basic production industries as well, such as garment production) within their regional territories, in contrast to the record of industrial decline in many other North American metropolitan areas, although to be sure they have also experienced high growth in service industries, and contractions in some traditional industries. At the end of the 20th century, then, industrialization represented the dominant trajectory for many states and regions within the Asia-Pacific, constituted a significant aspect of growth (together with specialized services) in some of the more advanced economies of the Pacific realm, and remained an aspiration of lessdeveloped, agrarian and staple-dominated countries in the region. These industrialization trajectories will continue to be highly influential in the development of Asia-Pacific cityregions in the new century, but it is equally clear that service industries will emerge as increasingly significant features of urban growth and change, a theme we will explore in the following chapters.",

The research emphasis has tended to be on multinational service corporations and international trade in services (Waelbroeck et al., 1985; Thrift, 1986; UNCTAD, 1990; Sieh-Lee, 1992; Lasserre and Redding, 1995) , rather than on services development and associated issues for cities and city-regions. This situation reflects, to some extent, the pervasive influence of industrialization as a development paradigm within much of the Pacific realm, emphasizing the primacy of manufacturing and industrial production within the growth trajectories of many Asia-Pacific states, regions and societies. 8 The hegemony of the industrialization paradigm has created a kind of shadow effect within the scholarly literature on the economic development of the Pacific Basin, within which services are customarily treated as elements of the traditional urban retail or commercial sector, as essentially ancillary activities which can be effectively subsumed within industrialization processes and systems, or as special, almost aberrant features of exceptional cases such as Hong Kong and Singapore. Indeed, many of the region's leading service industries and corporations (notably banks, trading companies, and ocean freight lines) were established to facilitate manufacturing growth and the expansion of trade in goods, thus comprising essential features of the Asia-Pacific's industrialization experience. Moreover, service industries, including modern, advanced services, are now sufficiently well-represented in a broad sampling of national and regional jurisdictions, and are now so increasingly central to the economic and social transformation of Pacific cities, that a more incisive investigation of services growth trends and associated impacts is clearly merited (O'Connor, 1998) .",

Many of these financial corporations and other large service enterprises have become extensively globalized, enhancing the status of the cities within which they are domiciled; but a significant proportion of these corporations have been seriously damaged by the events of 1997 and after, and there have already been a number of major bankruptcies, with, no doubt, more to follow.

At the vanguard of growth and change there are also an expanding number of firms in the computer software and knowledge industry groups that are so crucial to the progress of advanced, information-based economies. In general, however, this intermediate services subsector (comprised mainly of small-and medium-size firms) is somewhat less well-developed in Asia than is the case among the leading regional and national economies of Europe and North America, where the producer services are seen as essential to the efficient operation of flexible production regimes, and have constituted the most dynamic elements of these economies and labour forces over the past two decades.

However, there are also important structural factors as well. These include, notably, contrasts in the regulatory conditions and legal and contractual regimes between countries, which impose different kinds and levels of requirements upon firms domiciled within these jurisdictions. Within many of the Western societies these regulatory and legal regimes have become exceedingly complex and demanding, giving rise to specialized intermediate service firms which provide expert advice to corporations on a subcontracting basis, as the demand arises. Within the Asian realm, as we have already noted, many of these specialized service inputs are generated either internally within the corporation, as is the case with some of the larger Korean and Japanese conglomerates; or, as is the practice in many firms in China and Southeast Asia, are supplied by a network of advisors defined by kinship and social relations. Moreover, there has been a substantial (if spatially and temporally uneven) growth of producer services within the Asia-Pacific, reflecting \"the wide socio-cultural heterogeneity in this region and the distance between trade centres\" (Ho, 1998: 179) .",

There is also a tendency toward greater levels of specialization in services production among larger cities, although there are to be sure some notable exceptions to this.

Within the Asia-Pacific, we observe a spectrum of (sometimes quite assertive and even grandiose) developmental policies and programmes designed wholly or in part to promote the growth of specialized service industries. These include the highly dirigiste approaches of Japan (Shapira et al., 1994) and Singapore (Ho, 1994) , within which central governments have assigned leading roles to advanced service industries in support of urban and national economic transformation, and enhanced roles for service industries in local economic development strategies and policies. In contrast, public policy approaches toward services among Western societies have tended to emphasize regulation, including zoning, development control, and growth management, in addition to mostly episodic experiments with developmental policies, and only very exceptional attempts to undertake service industry 'megaprojects' on the heroic scale of numerous Asian cities. 9",

At one level, this process evokes the idea of post-industrialism, which positions service industries and occupations as ascendant features of the urban economy in a context of (relative or even absolute) contractions in basic manufacturing. However, in the Asia-Pacific setting the growth of specialized services can be seen as a concomitant element of advanced production systems, national modernization programmes, and globalization strategies of central and regional governments. These strategic aspirations are by no means fully realized, but they do underscore the importance of advanced services to the future development of the region.",

            "text": "As is well known, tertiarization within many Asia-Pacific city-regions is impelled both by market and policy factors. This latter tendency is particularly marked in the region, as we can instance numerous examples of assertive public policy efforts both at central and local government and administrative levels designed to accelerate tertiarization (and/or deploy tertiarization as an instrument of broader economic and socio-economic transformation). Examples of the deployment of policies for services in the interests of supporting or promoting transformational change include (a) synergies between national economic liberalization policies and local development strategies which have accelerated tertiarization processes (including advanced services) among designated Chinese cityregions, (b) intersections between national industrial policies and urban economic programmes which have supported specialized service functions among Japanese metropolitan cities, (c) ensembles of national development programmes and regulatory adjustments designed to enhance the growth of advanced, export-oriented services, as in the case of Singapore since the mid-1980s, (d) central government support for strategic service industries as instruments of national development, accompanied by complementary local land use initiatives, as in the case of finance, producer services and information technology in Malaysia, and (e) the more episodic (or less committed) support for service industries within (often somewhat schizophrenic) clusters of local development and growth management plans in Sydney, Melbourne, Seattle, San Francisco, Vancouver, among other cities. 10 The second category of urban tertiarization impacts concerns the role of services in change within the internal form and structure of the metropolis or city-region, and reflects the profound and comprehensive impacts of service industry development on the spaceeconomy of the contemporary city. The internal reordering of metropolitan space associated with rapid service industry growth incorporates processes which are multifaceted and interdependent: demand for services generates growth among service industries and firms to create a new sectoral mix within the city's economic base, and new patterns of services production and consumption as observed in the emergence of high-rise office complexes, secondary business centres, specialized service clusters (for example tertiary education and medical complexes), and new retail landscapes. These developments have visibly reconstructed urban structure and form in many American cities, but in some European cities have been situated more carefully within older districts, creating a more subtle and complex urban form, while in Asia (for example in Shanghai and Osaka), preservation has been subordinated to the imperatives of accelerated restructuring, and has been in policy terms an afterthought at best. 11 While market forces have constituted agents of urban respatialization, public authorities have deployed services as instruments of internal metropolitan reconfiguration within the Asia-Pacific, as in (a) the construction of new financial and corporate 10 This urban 'policy schizophrenia' is associated, typically, with institutional conventions and operational practice within city and metropolitan governments. In most cases the urban 'plan' is prepared by staff planners, with input from other professionals and the broader community, and often emphasizes regulation, in terms of statutory development control functions and instruments (such as zoning, developing by-laws, and land use policies) and modern growth management modalities. By way of contrast, local economic development strategies are formulated by separate economic advisory groups, business interests, community groups and NGOs, or special council committees or bodies appointed by (and accountable specifically to) the Mayor or Council chair, and are therefore often informed by quite different (and even oppositional) values and visions. 11 A principal motivation behind the development of the La D\u00e9fence corporate complex was to protect the historic built environment of Central Paris from the kind of massive demolition and displacement impelled by office development in many other cities, by initiating a new 'CBD' outside the metropolitan core. This has been to a large extent realized (apart from exceptions such as the Maine-Montparnasse office-tower on the rive gauche), but the preservation of buildings and streetscapes in the central core of Paris has been a series of struggles over the past century and a half (Sutcliffe, 1970) .",

More generically, public authorities also respond to infrastructure demand (for example airports and transit systems) derived from growth in services industries and activities (Daniels, 1991) . The growth of service industries and occupations within Asia-Pacific city-regions also has important social implications, representing a third major set of urban tertiarization impacts. Here, the growth of (especially advanced) service industries and related occupational cohorts generates an increasingly tertiarized labour force, which Daniel Bell described as a pre-condition for the emergence of a post-industrial society, over a quarter century ago (Bell, 1973) : a contested idea, to be sure (Gershuny, 1978) , but a seminal and prescient contribution in many ways. Within the highly tertiarized city, the growth of specialized services leads to significant socio-spatial effects, including the familiar pattern of social upgrading within inner city neighbourhoods, and the formation of new suburban communities comprised largely of service workers, but also the recent emergence of a 'new middle class' of higher-echelon service labour (Ley, 1996) . The rise of this new middle class of elite service workers (professionals, executives and managers, entrepreneurs and creative services occupations) as a presence in the inner city, a larger process than earlier, more incremental experiences of gentrification, comprises individuals who view the metropolitan core as a place to work, live, and recreate, leading to the transformation of the central city with respect to structure, land use, form, and lifestyles. There are also broader cultural connotations associated with the new middle class, as seen in shifts in tastes, values, behaviours, and even political affiliation. This new middle class enjoys a hegemonic status within the most highly tertiarized cities in the region, such as Vancouver, Seattle, San Francisco, and Sydney, and comprises the ascendant social cohort within Singapore, Tokyo, and Hong Kong, but is also observed as a growing presence (with some local variation in specific features) within the central districts of Seoul, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Kuala Lumpur, among other cities.",

Although much of the scholarly analysis of tertiarization has emphasized change within the three strategic categories described earlier, a more nuanced appreciation of the more intensely localized implications of growth in services is essential to attaining an appropriately rounded profile of the process. These include, for the purposes of illustration, the impact of service industries and the growth of service occupations on the quality of working life, and on localized displacement and dislocation at the neighbourhood and household levels (Chua, 1989 (Chua, , 1991 , especially within a context of industrial decline or restructuring. There is considerable potential for research on the important gender aspects of tertiarization, which may include the tendency for over-representation of females within many service occupations and industries. Within the highly tertiarized societies of the old Atlantic core, the past several decades have seen both the impressive progress of women within some of the credentialized service occupations, for example in law, accountancy, and planning, but also a more discouraging tendency for women to congregate in more menial, poorly paid and distinctly marginalized positions.",

Lin observes that characteristics of mobility, flexibility and entrepreneurial skills are defining attributes of Hong Kong migrants (Lin, 2000: 13) , enhancing their attractiveness to receiving urban societies and business communities. In certain cities, recent immigrants are over-represented both within entrepreneurial and management occupations, but also among more menial service occupations; this is especially the case in large global cities (Sassen, 1991) .

In many Asian cities, these smaller scale service operations may be viewed as an extension of the traditional population of informal service workers (itself a contested term), service activities which occupy the urban interstices between the more formal corporate business and retail structures. These can be seen as persistent features of the central city, not only among the megacities of Southeast Asia, such as Bangkok and Jakarta, but also within the downtown spaces of modern world cities such as Tokyo. They are not simply residual activities, but essential, if often undervalued, operations that support the more formal service economy in 100 different ways within the metropolitan core, including the provision of food and beverages (Yasmeen, 1992) .

The perceived image of a city can be substantially altered by comprehensive processes of tertiarization, as seen in the repositioning of Singapore and Hong Kong as post-industrial, specialized service centres, although usage of decidedly obsolete nomenclature such as 'newly industrializing economies' is surprisingly persistent, as are outdated tropes like 'little dragons' or 'little tigers' (Cartier, 1999) . 12 In some cases national governments have supported specialized service industry projects as quite deliberate instruments of urban re-imaging, as seen in the creation of international banking and producer services in the Pudong development in Shanghai, and in the construction of the Petronas Towers in the central area of Kuala Lumpur. These initiatives are designed in part to underscore a commitment to modernity, and by extension to symbolize national economic progress and aspirations to global status and engagement, but also to supplant traditional (or, more pejoratively, 'backward') industries and related social groups. These more grandiose visions can be contested, especially where the elite beneficiaries of advanced service industry growth (for example professionals and managers in financial and business services, as well as cronies of rulers and oligarchs) represent a particularly visible and privileged expression of dichotomous 'development' as set against the condition of the urban masses in places like Jakarta and Manila.",

In some cases the ascendancy of upper-tier service workers represents a new socio-economic and socio-political hegemony, implying a coincident subordination of traditional industrialsector cohorts, as well as an exacerbation of income disparities. As in other aspects of urban tertiarization within the Asia-Pacific, contrasts in scale and stages of development are significant, as are tendencies toward exceptionalism when case studies are subjected to closer analysis. Thus, Baum concluded that the sustained growth of specialized service industries, advanced-technology activities and related occupations in Singapore, coupled with comprehensive public housing programmes and education investments, has resulted in a predominantly professionalized (as opposed to polarized) occupational and social structure within the city-state (Baum, 1999) . In Hong Kong, where specialized services have also driven urban growth and socio-economic change (Kwok, 1996) , the post-colonial record since 1997 includes growing poverty (about 600 000 residents earn less than $600 per month), attributable in some part to the inadequacies of the secondary school system, a situation which one legislator fears may lead to 'serious social instability' (Lee Cheuk-yan, quoted in Far Eastern Economic Review: 26 October 2000). At a larger scale, a combination of market liberalization and selective tertiarization in certain Chinese cities, with attendant political and bureaucratic corruption, has generated income polarization rates approaching or even exceeding the American level. This striving for new urban identities in the Chinese case, with its repressed tensions and conflicts, can be seen in the Shanghai government's preference for 'high class' individuals (well-educated, with the right attitudes, outlooks and professional profiles) for the glittering new towers of the Pudong project (Halliday, 1995) , a far cry indeed from the earlier Communist exaltation of the urban industrial worker and fraternal colleagues in the PLA and in rural peasant communes.",

The proliferation of transnational retail and food services within commercial complexes is of course a ubiquitous phenomenon, as observed in places like Shinkjuku and Shibuya stations (and commercial subcentres) in Tokyo. In Hong Kong, the incursion of service industry commuters in the New Territories has transformed the social identity of certain of the post-war industrial communities, as seen in the transformation of Tsuen Wan from 'Hakka enclave' to 'post-industrial city' (Johnson, n.d.) . In the case of Singapore, the last decade has seen the demise of the Kampung Kopi-tiam (informal eating places, serving authentic local fare) as a result of relentless modernization (Chua, 1995) , and the almost total disappearance of traditional rural life, while other local retail and shopping districts have been subject to the reformation of identity associated with the tastes and behavioural preferences of affluent expatriate populations. Chang deploys the term 'expatriatization' to describe a \"spatial transformation in which land use increasingly reflects an expatriate bias\", as typified in Holland Village, a local commercial centre within an affluent residential district of Singapore, but one which \"reflects the influence and influx of global cultures\" (Chang, 1995:157) .",

Many of these firms have been concentrated within \"new service production landscapes\" within or proximate to the central area, exemplified by 'Silicon Alley' and Telok Ayer in Singapore, Yaletown in Vancouver, Belltown in Seattle, and the northeast Mission and South Park districts of San Francisco (Hutton, 2000) . These technology-based service firms (which also include graphic designers, who exemplify the production synergies of technology and culture in applied design) typically exhibit employment structures dominated by young entrepreneurs and 'techies', with distinctive skills and lifestyles, underscoring both the new social divisions of labour in the urban service sector, and the highly volatile nature of urban identity in the post-modern, globalized metropolitan order. Over the last 2 years, the number of these technology-intensive firms within inner city production districts has contracted significantly, as part of the crash of the dot.coms. However, new survey research has disclosed the emergence of 'hybridized' firms combining creativity and technology toward the production of high-value goods and services, signifying a new phase of development within the metropolitan core of advanced societies (Hutton, 2003) . These trends therefore demonstrate both the volatile nature of recent phases of service industry development, as evidenced by the accelerated processes of transition and succession, as well as the distinctive role of the inner city as site of innovation.",

Here, a typology of urban service centres within the region, while inevitably masking considerable nuance, may at least serve to depict some basic features of functional differentiation. While tertiarization stages and levels vary widely among Asia-Pacific city-regions, service industries are certainly performing significant roles in urban growth and development across a range of city types and urban scales.",

Therefore, a typology of cities engaged in specialized services production and trade should incorporate 'suites' of services specialization and developmental progression, as well as attributes of scale and hierarchy.

These massive city-regions contain to be sure huge concentrations of manufacturing, and, indeed, exhibit greater industrial strength than many of the first order global cities of the Atlantic realm, such as London, Paris, and New York. Both Tokyo and Los Angeles have important, global scale advanced-technology industrial sectors, situated within their metropolitan and immediately proximate territories, including Orange County (in the case of Los Angeles) (Scott, 1988) , and the new production spaces of the Tokyo Metropolitan Region (TMR) (Fujita and Hill, 1996) . However, while both Tokyo and Los Angeles retain an impressive base of modern manufacturing capacity, their most insistent claim to global city status rests on their downtown complexes of international banking and finance, and headquarters of MNCs, supported by highly specialized producer services and superior international communications systems and transportation networks. Los Angeles and Tokyo are also global centres of cultural production and dissemination, media concentration, and applied design and creative industries. They contain major universities of high international standing, including UCLA and USC (Los Angeles), and Tokyo University and Waseda within the Japanese capital. Of these two Pacific regional first-tier global cities, Tokyo has conventionally been ranked as the leading centre, in view of its base of multinational head offices, and more particularly, its concentration of major banks, securities firms and trading companies, but this status may need to be reconsidered in light of the fall-out from the 1997 crisis (and, indeed, the failure to effectively address structural and institutional problems in the national banking and financial sector over the last decade). Tokyo has considerable underlying industrial and overall economic power, but there is certainly the prospect of serious erosion in its financial sector over the mediumterm at least, which may jeopardize its position within the triumvirate of highest-order world centres (which also includes London and New York). 13 Fig. 2 .

For example, both Singapore and Hong Kong specialize in advanced service industries, including finance and banking, producer and other high order services, tourism and convention activities, and higher education. Each is now a major exporter of services; Hong Kong is ranked as the 10th leading exporter of services globally (Hang Seng Bank, 1996) . Manufacturing has declined from 29.5% of Hong Kong's employment in 1989, to only 12.2% in 1998, a level comparable to that of the most highly tertiarized Atlantic core societies (Asian Development Bank, 2002) . Upper-tier service industry professionals, managers and entrepreneurs constitute the dominant social class in Hong Kong (Kwok, 1999) . However, Hong Kong's emergence as a centre of specialized service production and trade has been impelled principally by an exceedingly liberal regulatory regime, while Singapore's restructuring trajectory has been enhanced by a more direct application of policy measures. Following a brief but sharp recession in 1985, the Singapore government resolved to transform the city-state from a branch-plant industrial enclave to a regional (and world) centre of tertiary production and trade, with the aim of becoming the 'Switzerland of Asia' by 2000. This overarching economic development and transformation goal has been to a large extent realized, and Singapore now represents a policy experience that other nations (notably China) are endeavouring to emulate.",

As observed by Taylor and Kwok (1989) , Hong Kong experienced an accelerated transformation process over three decades, from an 'industrial metropolis' (export manufacturing phase) in the 1960s, to a 'postindustrial' status (information service phase) over the 1970s, and emerging as an 'international metropolis' by the 1980s. A sequence of policy and (especially) physical planning measures were deployed to promote economic transition and transformation, including the industrial new town programme of the 1960s, the expansion of the Hong Kong CBD eastward toward Wanchai and Causeway Bay in the 1980s, and the recent investments in transportation infrastructure, as in the linking of Hong Kong with Guangzhou by expressway, and the construction of the international airport at Chek Lap Kok. There have also been substantial new public investments in tertiary education, training and housing, underscoring a substantial government commitment to upgrading the quality of Hong Kong's human resources and social capital. These investments and land use policy initiatives suggest that contrasts between Singapore's and Hong Kong's approaches to economic transformation which insist on sharply dichotomous contrasts may be somewhat overstated, although the extent (and sustained commitment) of direct policy intervention in the Singapore case is in many respects singular. 14 Our third category includes second-and third-tier global cities, which feature large and generally fast-growing service sectors, established on a base of world-scale manufacturing and industrial production capacity in each case. We can identify two sub-categories (Table  4 ) within this aggregation: first, three 'advanced' business and industrial centres (Nagoya, Kobe and Taipei) situated within leading east Asian economies; and secondly, a set of 'transitional' urban centres which still possess some features of early phase industrialization and a relatively large informal sector, including 'floating' or transient labour contingents (Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Bangkok, and Kuala Lumpur). However, each of these large cities exhibits relatively high growth in producer services, including engineering and business services. Other defining attributes of these centres are (1) important international gateway roles, (2) major public and private sector investments in higher-order services infrastructure, and (3) ambitious local/metropolitan strategies for new, specialized service industry roles and 'vocations', supported in most cases by national government policies and projects.",

In general, the central government has been concerned both with the need to maintain a leading edge position in industrial production within the Asia-Pacific, while preparing the large cities for more advanced roles in specialized services industries, both for the domestic economy, and for trade purposes. Much of the research on economic restructuring in Japan has emphasized 'hard services,' notably technology, and its role in transforming both industrial production modes and urban economic structures (Glasmeier, 1988) , while another major body of scholarship deals with the transformation of Tokyo, 14 While Hong Kong has initiated over the past 15 years numerous specific projects and programmes to support the expansion of service industries, Singapore has enunciated policies and programmes to promote strategic services (e.g. banking and finance, producer services, and IT) within more formal policy statements and structures, consistent with the city-state's distinctive policy culture and administrative styles. The recent expansion of design and technology-based services in heritage districts outside the CBD represented one of the few 'spontaneous' (or unplanned) economic phenomena in the city-state's recent history (interview with Urban Redevelopment Authority official, July 2000), although there is now policy support for cultural industries administered by the Tourism Development Board.",

Following the industrialization policies and programmes of the period over the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s (including the ruinous 'Great Leap Forward'), Chinese cities \"were endowed with a massive and diffuse manufacturing capacity, and provided with few incentives (until the last decade) to develop the services sector\" (Hamer, 1995: 11) . The economic policy reforms of 1978 (and more specifically) the mid-1980s embodied a recognition that modernization would require the more efficient deployment of cities and their resources, and thus heavy manufacturing was increasingly decentralized to outlying areas, and services (especially financial and producer services) were encouraged, both by economic planners in Beijing, and by local authorities. In order to achieve growth in advanced production and transition to a more knowledge-based economy, Hamer estimates that \"up to 40% of the local labour force will have to be employed in the producer services sector\" (Hamer, 1995: 11) , a proportion that seems high even by the standard of more advanced OECD cities, but is perhaps nonetheless indicative of municipal aspirations. Lin also underscores the crucial role of cities in the modernization of the Chinese economy as represented by their concentrations of advanced service industries and occupations which enable higher levels of creativity, efficiency, and internationalization (Lin, 1998:111-112) .",

A succession of Five-Year Plans emphasized the primacy of manufacturing for Shanghai's industrial transformation, with a particular emphasis on heavy industry and the production of capital goods.

To a considerable extent, this massive effort in economic restructuring is intended to offer China a strategic access to the global economy (Yeh, 1996) , but (at least at a subtextual level) the question of achieving a competitive position vis-\u00e0-vis Hong Kong in financial and trade services must be acknowledged. In this respect, Shanghai has certainly attracted an impressive quantity of investment in banking and commercial (and supporting public) infrastructure, as well as a growing number of MNCs and MNEs, but has not yet achieved the high concentrations of domestic and expatiate professional expertise in specialized services that is a defining hallmark of highest-order global cities. (Indeed, as Kris Olds has observed, Shanghai's globalization strategy has been highly dependent on the engagement of the 'Global Intelligence Corps' of elite professionals; Olds, 1997) . Here, Hong Kong is likely to hold a competitive advantage over other Chinese cities over the short to mediumterm by virtue of the territorialization (Storper, 1997) of this expertise and specialized human capital. The two fundamental shifts in Shanghai's development trajectory over the past several decades can be interpreted empirically. In 1952, the 'tertiary sector' (i.e. commerce, finance, communications, science and technology, education and culture) constituted 42.3% of Shanghai's regional GDP. Following 20 years of investment in manufacturing capacity and employment, this proportion was reduced to only 17.3% by 1972. The intensive promotion of advanced service industries during the 1980s resulted in an increase in the tertiary sector's share of GDP to 30% by 1990, while Shanghai's economic development strategy called for an increase in this proportion to about 60% by 2000 (Fung et al., 1992) , led by the advanced services complex in the Pudong redevelopment mega-project. (Shanghai's service sector grew by 12% in 1992, and by 15% in 1993; Chreod Ltd, 1996) Overall, Shanghai's experience of accelerated industrialization and subsequent re-tertiarization must represent one of the most dramatic episodes of economic restructuring among large metropolitan cities in the post-war period.",

As in other large Chinese cities, economic policy priorities following 1949 entailed the transformation of Guangzhou from a 'consumer city' to a 'producer city'. This strategy of large-scale industrialization was perhaps less fully realized than in the case of Shanghai, because of the persistence of entrepreneurial traditions in the province, and Guangzhou's distance from the national capital, which enabled at least a degree of autonomy. Building on its well-established gateway and entrep\u00f4t functions, Guangzhou was strategically positioned to immediately benefit from the opening up of Chinese coastal cities. In the period 1978-1992, growth in services exceeded that for agriculture or manufacturing, with lead tertiary sector industry groups including finance and corporate support services (Nanjiang, 1996) . Guangzhou is the urban centre for the Pearl River Delta economic region, which represents (with the lower Yangtze region and southern Fujian) major growth regions and access points for China to the broader Asia-Pacific and global markets (Johnson, 1996) . The issue of whether Guangzhou can extend its regional role more fully into the national realm remains an open question (Tsang, 1995) , as are the 'terms of co-existence' with Hong Kong following the latter's post-colonial status as a Special Administrative Region of the PRC as of July 1997. There is to be sure potential for complementarity as well as competition as characteristics of the relationship between Guangzhou and Hong Kong within the Pearl Delta extended urban cluster, a theme to be addressed in more detail below, but over time Guangzhou will aspire to greater shares of the region's international financial and business activity.",

This fourth category of Asia-Pacific cities includes two sub-groups: first, advanced, highly tertiarized cities with substantial manufacturing capacity and associated labour cohorts, and propulsive corporations, notably Seattle, Melbourne, and Yokohama; and a larger contingent of specialized services cities with relatively modest industrial production sectors, including Vancouver, Portland, Fukuoka, and Brisbane. In many respect these jurisdictions embody features of service industry development observed within the mature urban and regional economies of the old Atlantic core, which typically include (a) a dominant status for services within the metropolitan industrial mix, export base, and occupational structure; (b) the formation of corporate complexes within the CBD; (c) the emergence of new, creative services (culture, applied design, multimedia) on the CBD fringe and inner city; (d) the influence of suburban business centres and 'edge cities' in regional multinucleation; (e) intersections between services growth and changes in urban housing markets; and (f) the increasing role of services in the reformation of urban identity, politics, and lifestyles (Ley and Hutton, 1991) . At the same time, many of the city-regions within Pacific America and Australasia also exhibit tendencies common to other Asia-Pacific metropolitan areas, such as (relative) economic dynamism and higher growth rates in services, and are also linked to Asia-Pacific cities, markets and societies by increasingly diverse networks of trade, investment, immigration and travel. As a crucial intersection of two principal processes of urban development, large-scale immigration, especially from Asian societies, has in important respects augmented urban tertiarization processes, reinforcing entrepreneurial, professional and management occupations, and contributing to export services trade by enhancing the connectivity between trading centres. We can therefore position these cities as geographically peripheral, but functionally integral, nodes of the Asia-Pacific urban system and as important examples of a distinctive stage of urban tertiarization within the Pacific realm.",

            "text": "The fifth category within our provisional typology of Asia-Pacific cities engaged in services production includes several Southeast Asian 'mega-urban' regions, Jakarta, Manila, and (more tentatively) Ho Chi Minh City. The emergence of relatively small service sector occupational elites within mega-urban city-regions such as Jakarta, and Manila must be set against a vastly larger informal sector of hawkers, vendors, and peddlers, which McGee described as the urban 'proto-proleteriat' (McGee, 1976) . Even in second-tier cities, such as Bandung, economic restructuring incorporating both industrial development and tertiarization has promoted a deeply polarized social structure (Pribadi and Sofha, 1993) . The imposition of advanced, high order services within the central and inner-city areas of Southeast Asian mega-cities has produced a distinctive juxtaposition of socio-economic classes, typified in part by the persistence of shanty towns, squatter settlements and informal sector activities proximate to high-rise office towers, high-end shops and boutiques, and other accoutrements of the later 20th-century corporate complex (Leaf, 1993) . As Leaf observes, the explanation for this notionally incongruous pattern of traditional social morphology and modern capitalist development features \"lies in the segmentation of urban land markets\u2026Which is now most commonly expressed in terms of formal and informal sectors\u2026derived from early patterns of land use not governed by market principles\" (Leaf, 1996: 5) . In the case of Jakarta, in which about three quarters of the population live in informal settlements (Kampung), social class differentiation is expressed \"not so much by zone or neighbourhood, such as what one would expect in the capitalist city, but at a more minute scale, between streetside and inner block locations within the same neighbourhood\" (Leaf, 1996: 5) underscoring the complex (and often deeply problematic) impact of economic restructuring on urban social structure within developing societies. The continuing economic crisis within Southeast Asian economies has no doubt impacted the poor disproportionately, but has also damaged the small service elite of professionals, financial and business services workers within the region's primate cities. In addition to the direct effects of this crisis on the employment and incomes of the service elite themselves, it seems likely that wider ramifications may include the diminution of the advanced services production capacity of these developing economies, as well as an erosion of the (already small) middle and upper-middle classes within their respective societies. 15 Ho Chi Minh City (formerly Saigon) also exhibits a highly dualistic socio-economic structure, but differs from Manila and Jakarta in some important respects. More particularly, the introduction of the 'doi moi' (renovation) economic policy has forcefully inserted a 15 Before the 'crash' of 1997 there was a generally growing constituency favouring economic, social, cultural and even political association among the nations of the Pacific Basin, derived in part from a shared vision of mutual economic interests and visions of progress, as well as a preference among some observers to view the 'modernist project' in Pacific Asia through the Western critical tradition (Preston, 1998) . In the short term at least the fiscal and economic crisis of the past 5 years in Asia has diminished the enthusiasm of some in the Americas and Australasia to be associated with the wider concept of the 'Asia-Pacific'. There are also signs of a more 'inward' (i.e. intra-Asian, as opposed to transPacific) sensibility on the part of (for example) Japanese corporations and the Chinese, Japanese and Malaysian governments, although the motivations for these attitudinal changes vary. Former Japanese vice-minister of finance Eisuke Sakakibara, for example, suggests that the membership of the US within APEC precludes the latter from being a 'true regional organization,' while vice-minister Ito observes that \"[t]he task for Asian countries is to ensure that regionalism in Asian really complement global trading and financial systems, like other regional arrangements in North America and Europe\" (quoted in T. Armstrong, 'Asia is going it alone', The Globe and Mail, Monday 12 February 2001: All). market presence within an established socialist political and social order, with polarizing outcomes for Ho Chi Minh City's labour force and society. Advanced services are emerging as defining elements of the new Ho Chi Minh City as depicted in an approved mural extolling \"300 years Saigon and Ho Chi Minh City: industrialization and modernization\", the modernist imagery underscored by a dominant motif of point towers (Drummond, 2001) . In this regard Ho Chi Minh City is something of a 'frontier city', characterized by significant autonomy from Hanoi, a situation somewhat analogous to that of Guangzhou in southern China, which operates as a bastion of market enterprise in contrast to the more formal cultural and political style of Beijing. At the same time, Hanoi too is endeavouring to expand its engagement with the global economy in its development strategy, while maintaining a measure of local policy protection for long-established informal services, implying a bipartite planning approach to service industries (Leaf, 1999) .",

At the same time, we can envisage the emergence of spatially extended territories of specialized services production and exchange at the broader regional level, configured as multi-centred urban corridors. These corridors (or clusters) comprise in most cases regions with a dominant first-or second-order global city and a chain of interdependent, and generally smaller, but nonetheless important urban centres. 16 The conceptual bases for the emergence of these 16 There is of course some ambiguity in this terminology, but in general corridors encompass essentially linear arrangements of cities, as exemplified in the Pacific North West Corridor (Vancouver -Seattle-Portland), while clusters can describe patterns of functionally linked (but dispersed or non-linear in form) cities within extended regional settings (for example the California Bay Area, which includes San Jose, the Silicon Valley, Oakland and Berkeley, as well as San Francisco). specialized functional territories can be traced to Gottmann's seminal idea of megalopolis (Gottmann, 1961 ), Whebell's theory of corridors as urban spatial systems (Whebell, 1969) , and McGee's notion of extended metropolitan regions (McGee, 1991) . They perform strategic service functions (including finance, corporate control, administration, information and communications, cultural and gateway roles), are linked both to regional production systems and to global networks of services trade, and exhibit aspects of complementarity as well as competition. Fig. 3 shows the location of 10 major urban service corridors or clusters within the Asia-Pacific sphere: five in East Asia (Central Japan -Honshu Corridor, the Lower Yangtze Corridor, the Pearl River Delta Cluster, and the Taiwanese and Korean Corridors); one in Southeast Asia (the Southern Malay Peninsula Corridor); one in Australasia (the Southeast Australian Corridor); and three on the Pacific coast of North America (the Southern California Corridor, the California -Bay Area Cluster, and the Pacific North West Corridor). Reflecting the corporate power of the Asia-Pacific's firstorder global cities, the two most important extended urban services territories are the Central Japan -Honshu Corridor, which includes Tokyo, Yokohama, Osaka, Nagoya, and Kyoto; and the Southern California Corridor, incorporating Los Angeles, Anaheim, Orange County, and San Diego. These first-tier metropolitan services corridors contain truly global-scale concentrations of most of the specialized service industry suites listed in Table 1 , including banking and finance, corporate control, producer services, gateway functions, advanced-technology and creative services, education and culture. However, there are certainly global-or international-scale service industry concentrations situated within other principal service corridors and clusters, as exhibited in Table 5 . These include, to illustrate, the California Bay Area (global-scale advanced-technology and creative services, higher education, tourism), the Korean Corridor (banking and finance, corporate control, gateway roles), the Pearl Delta (banking and finance, corporate control, gateway roles), and the Southern Malay Peninsula (banking and finance, gateway roles, advanced-technology services, education).",

Culture, amenity and lifestyle may constitute supporting elements of intra-regional services development in some cases, notably in the transboundary Pacific North West corridor. Advanced services have been crucial to the post-staples development of the Pacific North West; at the same time, the amenity provided by wilderness areas is widely seen as a positive inducement to the specialized services and advanced-technology industries which increasingly define the economic base of this region, and is also embedded in social values and lifestyles.",

There is to be sure considerable competition among the three ports (which is likely to increase as major shipping lines continue to rationalize their trans-Pacific rotations), but we can also observe aspects of specialization and complementarity: Seattle and Tacoma are major container ports, while Vancouver specializes in bulk commodity exports and cruise ship travel (The Port of Seattle has recently increased its efforts to attract cruise ship traffic, with at least a measure of success.). At a broader level, the reciprocal strengths of services specialization observed in Seattle, Vancouver and Portland enable the North West Corridor to compete in some trade sectors with the San Francisco Bay Area Cluster (for example in international gateway functions), about 1000 km to the south.",

Planning concerns during this period included the implications of rapid office development for the over-specialization of the urban economy, for the displacement of non-office industries and housing, and for long-distance commuting within the regional commuter shed. Indeed, the journey-to-work problem, shaped by the expansion of the CBD's office complex, and the simultaneous decentralization of the urban residential population and labour force, was broadly seen as a defining metropolitan planning issue in many city-regions (Davis and Hutton, 1981) . The planning response to high levels of central city office development over the 1970s and 1980s included both increasingly stringent development control policies for the core (including downzoning, the imposition of annualized development quotas or thresholds, and fiscal measures), as well as efforts to promote new office subcentres within suburban areas.",

In Britain and in other parts of Western Europe, left-leaning councils actively discouraged service industries, which were seen as displacing traditional manufacturing industries. This essentially prejudicial local attitude toward service industries was in part conditioned by research which subordinated the tertiary sector to secondary manufacturing within the urban or regional economy, based on measures of export performance, productivity, and sales and employment multipliers. However, to some extent stringent local planning controls on (especially office-based) services were strongly influenced by political opposition to the speculative property market, which was seen to favour office development over industry and housing, reflecting higher returns on investment (ROI) for office development relative to other land use categories. Examples of this ideologically derived planning response to urban tertiarization included the Greater London Council and most inner city boroughs during the 1970s and early 1980s.",

This more favourable local policy posture toward office activity and other service industries was influenced both by the implications of industrial decline in many large-and medium-sized cities, impelled by the collapse of traditional Fordist industry, as well as by new research which underscored the key roles played by specialized services in advanced (Daniels, 1985) . More particularly, the specialized intermediate (or 'producer') services were identified as crucial to the operation of 'flexible' production systems, to high-wage urban labour formation, to industrial productivity, to the urban export base, and to local revenues. In this new situation, urban governments and planning authorities began to introduce policies for (at least selectively) encouraging important service industries, notably banking and finance, transportation, business services, higher education, and tourism (Coffey, 1996) .",

Table 6 contrasts planning approaches toward service industries according to preferences for 'developmental' or 'growth management' policy objectives, although in practice many local authorities tended to implement a blended suite of promotional programmes and regulation . However, important examples of quite dramatic policy shifts can be referenced, notably within cities of the broadly defined Asia-Pacific region. In the well-known case of Singapore, a short, sharp economic downturn in the mid-1980s led almost immediately to aggressive new policies favouring specialized, high-value, exportable services, in part reflecting concerns about the prospects for Singapore's manufacturing industry and regional entrep\u00f4t roles. In Hong Kong, the colonial government assertively supported the expansion of office activity and other key intermediate services, exemplified by the territorial expansion of the CBD, by public investments in education, and by increased international marketing (Taylor and Kwok, 1989) . And in Vancouver, a centre-left City Council approved an economic development strategy which set out a series of policies and programmes to foster 10 important service sectors and industries, together with co-operative measures to be undertaken among key institutions, labour cohorts, and business groups (City of Vancouver, 1983) . At the same time, the City of Vancouver continued to co-operate with the regional planning authority, the Greater Vancouver Regional District, in managing externalities of rapid growth in services, for example by supporting office development in designated regional town centres (RTCs), exemplifying the tendency to 'blend' both regulatory and developmental programmes within local policy suites.",

The severe (although spatially differentiated) impacts of major exogenous shocks on regional and national economies, including the aftermath of the 9/11 experience in New York, the Bali night-club explosion of October 2002, and the lingering effects of the 1997 fiscal and economic crisis in the Asia-Pacific. These impacts have included inter alia sharply diminished air travel and tourism in many regions, increasing unemployment, and problems of corporate illiquidity and bankruptcies. We can also acknowledge the recent impact of sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome) upon major Asia-Pacific service industries, notably airlines, hotels and retail trade. 3. Economic and developmental implications of a series of unresolved security crises within Asia and the Middle East especially, including the apparently intractable Palestinian question, the Iraq crisis, and the problem of North Korea's incipient nuclear capacity. These implications include a more problematic investment climate within affected nations and proximate regions. 4. The rapid rise (and even more dramatic contraction) of the so-called 'New Economy', over the last 5 years. The collapse of the dot.coms notwithstanding, however, information and telecommunications industries constitute essential features of all advanced economies, and are playing increasingly central developmental roles within the Asia-Pacific region (Corey, 1998) . 5. The emergence of the 'urban cultural economy', underpinned by what Allen Scott describes as the convergence of culture and urban development, and comprising both cultural production and consumption as leading sectors within a growing number of cities and city-regions (Scott, 2000) . Cultural industries (including creative design industries, media and multimedia, and film, video and music production) represent increasingly important sectors of the urban economy, in cities such as Los Angeles, Tokyo, Kyoto, Singapore, Bangkok, and Melbourne. 6. Sharply divergent economic fortunes of the Asia-Pacific's major nation-states, including the remarkable growth of advanced industrial production and trade in China, the continuing Japanese economic malaise, and slow growth in the American economy (The stagnation of American consumer markets has also seriously retarded exports from other Asia-Pacific nations.). 7. Continuing processes of restructuring and transition among the advanced economies of east and southeast Asia, including Taiwan, South Korea, and Singapore, as well as in 'threshold' NICs such as Malaysia, Thailand, and Vietnam. To illustrate, an \"important feature of ASEAN economic development has been the growth of their services sector\" (Tongzon, 2002: 71) , as reflected in GDP and employment data.",

Similar tensions between local development agencies and municipal planning departments can be observed in West Coast cities of North America, including Vancouver. With respect to institutional tensions between local and central governments within the Asia-Pacific, we can cite the recurrent conflicts in development aspirations between the Okinawa Prefecture and Tokyo ministries over the nature of Okinawa's growth and change, exacerbated by structural problems of core-periphery asymmetry and dependency, as well as the increasingly problematic US armed forces bases on the principal island. 5, have stimulated new interest in planning innovation at the metropolitan and local government levels within the broadly defined Asia-Pacific region. While urban policies emphasizing transformational growth and change, underpinned by globalization and modernization aspirations, and by imperatives of competitive advantage, are still pervasive within the region, we can also discern significant interest in alternative (and perhaps more progressive) urban planning models.

However, there have also been significant social and environmental costs associated with these programmes, and high levels of local exposure to a variety of risks, as social and ecological values have (despite policy rhetoric to the contrary) been substantially discounted against the perceived benefits of accelerated globalization (see Douglass (1993) for a treatment of the Tokyo case study). The single-minded pursuit of transformational urban development through market integration, enhanced (or induced) comparative advantage in export service trade, and comprehensive local re-imaging has led to large-scale community displacement and dislocation (as in Shanghai), high corporate and municipal financial exposure (Yokohama's MM21 project, and Tokyo's waterfront development), and inflation in local property markets (many instances throughout the region).",

(See Table 3 (a) and (b) for a more comprehensive set of urban tertiarization attributes). As Kong Chong Ho has observed, cities have been obliged to respond to restructuring processes (Ho, 1993) , including retraining programmes for displaced workers, and welfare programmes and transfer payments as well as policies to promote industrial restructuring as part of modernization strategies (Hall, 1991) . In a number of cases, urban programmes of accelerated tertiarization have been undertaken within a context of urban-regional industrial decline or obsolescence. This has been observed within the Japanese metropolitan system, where the 'hollowing out' of the national industrial economy has been deeply felt, in terms of factory closures (or relocation offshore) and protracted structural unemployment. For some of these cities, new service industries and associated labour cohorts, production and trade constitute a possible new urban development trajectory or 'vocation'.",

Underpinning this defining policy shift was the work of a special subcommittee exploring the merits of manufacturing-versus services-led urban development and growth. The subcommittee concluded that advanced, specialized services enterprises \"contribute about twice as much value-added as manufacturing firms\" (Clad, 1986) , and constituted a more promising growth sector than most forms of goods production. Accordingly the Government of Singapore embarked upon a comprehensive programme to accelerate growth in specialized services in 1986, including incentives for foreign investors, new expenditures in education and training, sweeping fiscal changes (including major tax cuts, and reductions in payroll taxes), service industry support programmes, and marketing and information strategies.",

However, the experience of certain Japanese cities offers a quite different set of policy conditions and experiences. David Edgington has written extensively about the role of industrial restructuring policies for the important Nagoya -Chukyo Region, a key part of Japan's industrial heartland. He depicts schematically a progression of new industrial vocations for Chukyo over the second half of the 20th century, which includes (first) a mix of heavy industry (aircraft production and munitions) up to the 1950s; secondly, a shift to heavy industries (steel and petrochemicals) and consumer products over the 1960s; followed by strong growth in auto production (Toyota), heavy engineering, and light industries during the 1970s and 1980s. However, the last decade in the Nagoya -Chukyo region has seen new local (prefectural and municipal) policies and planning in support of a 'new vocation' of knowledge-intensive industries, including aerospace, advanced electronics, new ceramic materials, information technology, biotechnology, and fashion design and production (Edgington, 1996: 67) . This new vocation builds upon the Nagoya -Chukyo Region's embedded excellence in advanced industrial production, but with greatly enhanced services, design, and technology inputs to production. Here, the role of local government (as distinct from the well-known national government industrial support programmes) has emphasized \"strengthening regional culture, design and general amenity upgrading for Chukyo\" as an \"important part of regional restructuring\" (Edgington, 1996: 69) . The Nagoya -Chukyo experience represents an example of complementarity between central and local governments in promoting industrial restructuring at the regional level.",

This animating sense of competition between jurisdictions has at times been exacerbated by contrasts in stages of development, by ideological factors, and more forcefully by the pressures of accelerating globalization.

However, there was a chaotic pattern to much of this development, as evidenced in the growth of the Shenzen Special Economic Zone (SEZ), and in the proliferation of new airports within the Delta.

These efforts to pursue co-operation in economic development have been documented in a recent book edited by Anthony Gar-on Yeh et al. (2002) , titled Building a Competitive Pearl River Delta Region: Co-operation, Co-ordination, and Planning. To some extent, of course, this desire to achieve co-ordination is related to the need to avoid wasteful, inefficient duplication of functions, to preserve resources, and to rationalize spatial planning in a congested, high growth region. There is also a need to 'manage' competition between the two major centres of the region, Hong Kong and Guangzhou (Kwok and Ames, 1995; Cheung, 2002) . However, an important principle underpinning the increasing levels of co-operation within this administratively fragmented and complex region is the exigency of responding to pressures (and opportunities) of globalization. In this respect, the Pearl River Delta contains both a dense pattern of manufacturing and industrial production, as well as concentrations of specialized service industries, institutions, and functions, including banking and finance, seaports, airports, higher education, cultural and creative services, and public administration. These specialized services represent the best prospects for future growth and development in the region, and greater co-operation and co-ordination of these key services can significantly strengthen the PRD's competitive position within East Asia and global markets.",

The status of services as the most rapidly growing elements of many urban economies has ramifications for resource consumption (including land), while the mismatch between service employment concentrations and residential development exacerbates the metropolitan commuting and traffic congestion problems, impacting regional air quality.

During this period, there has been substantial redevelopment within Guangzhou's central city, but its overall spatial reconfiguration \"is changing from a compact city to a dispersed metropolis as a result of reforms which introduced land values and markets to its urban areas\" (Wu and Yeh, 1999: 393) . A measure of this dispersal and sprawl consists of industrial estates, but new service industries and commercial development, driven in large part by foreign investors, also play a role in this process. As Wu and Yeh conclude, \"[the] conflict between urban spatial restructuring and development control is inevitable\" (Wu and Yeh, 1999: 393) in high-growth cities characterized by the decline of central planning and inadequate local planning powers. Michael Leaf goes even further, asserting that in these dynamic Chinese cities, \"the practice of urban planning may have passed from irrelevance under the command economy of the past to gross ineffectiveness in the socialist market economy of today\" (Leaf, 1998: 145) . Moreover, local planning systems in at least some Chinese cities are developing more sophisticated planning styles, and an increasing number of planning professionals are engaged in exploring sustainability principles, so it may be that the next generation of city-region plans will incorporate stronger elements of sustainable development.",

Service industries were allocated important roles in the LRSP, as the concentration of new offices in the (now eight) RTCs would support the principle of compact settlement forms, while a more diversified range of both intermediate and final demand services (including commercial, retail, and educational services) would promote the formation of complete communities within the city-region, integrating important service functions and local employment opportunities with residential development.",

This corridor has seen a functional and spatial evolution over the past four decades, initiated in the 1950s by a secondary CBD in North Sydney, at the north end of the Sydney Harbour Bridge, followed by the establishment of a major regional shopping centre in the 1960s, and the development of Macquarie University on a nearby site (O'Connor et al., 2001) . With these activities serving as a base, the last two decades have seen the dramatic growth of new technology-based industries and advanced services: the north Shore corridor is anchored by Microsoft Corporation at one end, and Cable and Wireless Optics at the other, with five commercial clusters situated between these two major poles (O'Connor et al., 2001) . By the mid-1990s, employment within the North Shore corridor exceeded 200 000, included jobs situated within 325 member companies of the Australian Information Industry Association (O'Connor et al., 2001) . Sheehan quotes a property consultant as describing the North Shore corridor as \"technology land, but it's not physical production, it's brain power and computer power, biased toward sales, service and management rather than research, development and production\" (Sheehan (1999: 6) , as quoted in O' Connor et al. (2001: 4-5) ). Clearly, on this evidence, market players (investors, entrepreneurs, and professionals) have been central to the development of Sydney's North Shore corridor, but government and public agencies have played leading roles in terms of regional spatial planning, municipal land use policy, and in tertiary education investment. The Sydney North Shore corridor experience also vividly depicts the functional evolution of service industry clusters over time, in this case from a secondary office and shopping centre to an incipient high-technology site, and finally to a large-scale 'New Economy' site of national significance, including advanced-technology industries and specialized service functions.",

As Allen Scott has observed in a well-known treatment of 'the cultural economy of cities', \"[a]s we enter the 21st century, a very marked convergence between the spheres of cultural and economic development seems to be occurring\" (Scott, 1997: 323) . Within cities, the expansion of this new cultural sector includes film, video and music production, graphic artists, industrial design, fashion design, and architecture, as well as 'hybridized' firms which combine creative and technological outputs toward products (goods and services) imbued with high design content, including multimedia and 'new media' activities, internet graphics and imaging, and software design. Again to reference Scott, \"an ever-widening range of economic activity is concerned with producing and marketing goods and services that are infused in one way or another with broadly aesthetic or semiotic attributes\" (Scott, 1997: 323) .

The rapid expansion of these important new industries can be seen as the most recent development phase in the continuing evolution of the urban service economy, and the enduring competitive advantage of cities for specialized cultural production, as well as the reassertion of production activity in the inner city districts of some urban areas. Moreover, these new forms of specialized cultural services production are characterized by a distinctive interface with consumer markets, as many of these industries supply what Scott terms 'cultural products' (Scott, 1997: 323) which influence public tastes and preferences, and are concerned with differentiating consumer market segments. The 'new cultural economy' represents a leading-edge urban policy area. Within the mature urban societies of the Atlantic core, there is a significant record of policy innovation. For example, within the EU, there are numerous programmes for both national and local governments to support cultural industries, including the annual designation of 'European Cultural Cities'. At the national level, the British Government has produced detailed inventories of cultural industries, including employment, sales, and exports, as well as policy guidance for local authorities.",

As another example, Far East Properties has entered into an agreement with the Government of Canada, Nortel Networks, and the EU to sponsor a new business centre in another area of traditional Chinese shop houses, just east of Cross Street, demonstrating again the possibilities of co-operative development in the advanced service economy. The refurbishing and subsequent 'recolonization' of these important heritage districts suggests that culture and social memory can be reconciled at one level with economic innovation, although there are of course sublimated tensions in these processes of transition and appropriation (see Yeoh and Kong, (1995) for insightful treatments of these issues).",

The growth of advanced service industries will be crucial to the development of Asia-Pacific city-regions (and indeed to national economic progress) over the first decades of the new century. More particularly, advanced, specialized service industries will be central to employment and human capital formation, to the expansion of the urban middle class, to the more efficient operation of advanced industrial production systems and trade networks, and both to urban competitive advantage and the socio-economic sustainability of Asia-Pacific cities. Reinforcing this latter point, many of the region's large industrial metropoles will begin to 'shed' manufacturing employment (as experienced in the wrenching deindustrialization of mature Atlantic city regions, and in the 'hollowing out' of Japanese manufacturing capacity), and will need services growth to partially offset these contractions. At the same time, growth in advanced service industries and employment will require greater public policy commitments, not only in the areas of infrastructure and supporting systems, and in land use policies, but also in education and training. Here, we can return to an earlier comparative theme addressed in this paper, by acknowledging that effective policies for services (incorporating developmental as well as regulatory elements) have been seen as lacking in the old Atlantic core Coffey, 1996) , despite a relatively early experience of growth in advanced services within the region as a whole. The cities of the Asia-Pacific (and their respective central and regional governments) will need to develop more innovative policy approaches toward service industries over the next decade and beyond, reflecting the increasing significance of advanced services for economic transition and modernization.",

The facilitation of advanced services growth can, as we have seen in a number of Asia-Pacific cities, entail the dislocation of traditional industries, informal services, and residential populations. A balance must be struck between the imperatives of economic modernization and the claims of social justice, as well as respect for diversity and pluralism. A progressive urban planning posture should support the preservation of informal services and historic city districts, both of which sustain the authenticity of local identity, while at the same time promoting the intermediate, technology-based, creative and other specialized services essential to development. The idea of sustainable development, which has been articulated in some urban strategic plans within the region (at least at a rhetorical level), may present a progressive planning framework for integrating social, economic, and ecological values. Recent research has disclosed that there may in fact be significant policy complements intersecting urban sustainability and competitive advantage, including policies for compact urban structure and land use, efficient transportation and transit, and education investments (Goldberg and Hutton, 2000) , which may inter alia support advanced service industry development, as well as enhancing social welfare and ecological sustainability.",

These contrasts can be attributed in part to different models of intermediate services production and exchange, to the special roles of government policy in promoting accelerated services growth, and to the marked disparities in overall development at national and regional scales within the Asia-Pacific. These contrasts were identified and incorporated in our provisional typology of urban service specialization. The differentiated growth rates and levels of specialization in advanced services decisively influences urban hierarchy within the region, as well as patterns of services trade and exchange, and global city-region status (Rimmer, 1996) . Indeed, one of the salient issues for the future will be the extent to which full globalization processes may override established regional service markets, for example in finance, property and real estate, among others. The specialized service centres and corridors described earlier may emerge as platforms for the globalization of services produced within the Asia-Pacific, as well as engines of development within the region.",

            "text": "In addition to these empirical problems and policy issues, there are important theoretical questions to be addressed, associated with the role of tertiarization processes in the structure, growth and transformation of city-regions within the Asia-Pacific. There is a need to reconsider urban models embedded within the industrialization paradigm, in order to accommodate the increasing influence of service industries in the development of urban regions within the Pacific realm. These theoretical exercises will naturally acknowledge the centrality of industrial trends and economic factors, but will ideally transcend narrow economistic parameters to consider both the social implications of services growth, as well as the socio-cultural basis of advanced tertiarization, following the lead of progressive urban scholarship both in the Atlantic and Pacific spheres (Moulaert and Gallouj, 1993; Kim et al., 1997) . More specifically, there is a clear need for conceptualization of trajectories of service sector development within the Asia-Pacific which embody experiences of differentiation and exceptionalism that abound within the region, as well as more widely observed features. Beyond this important theoretical terrain, urban scholarship should address the relationships between the location of service industries and the reconfiguration of regional structure and the metropolitan space-economy. Innovative new research in this realm includes Larissa Muller's work on business services in Southeast Asia, incorporating commentary on opportunities 'for localizing international investment' within the region (Muller, 2002) . At the larger metropolitan scale, these models would position services as decisive influences on multinucleation, and would encompass spatial linkages between advanced services and manufacturing enterprises in regional production systems. At a more localized level, new urban spatial models should incorporate the emergence of emerging clusters of specialized services within reconstructed precincts of the inner city, including constituent ensembles of integrated services production networks. This should include research on the 'New Economy' industries and cultural and creative activities which comprise the most recent phase of urban service industry development.",

There is an opportunity to investigate the hypothesis of a 'new middle class' (Ley, 1996) as an ascendant social constituency among those Asia-Pacific cities which have experienced rapid growth in services. Another research frontier concerns the new social divisions of service labour within Asia-Pacific cities, reflecting the convergence of culture, technology and urban milieu, observed in a growing number of new service production spaces within the region. Then there is the overriding influence of global processes on the occupational and social structures of urban communities, including the role of MNCs, the changing international division of production labour, innovation in telecommunications, and international migration. The extent to which these three powerful sets of forces-an ascendant new middle class of elite service workers, emerging social divisions of service labour, and globalization processes-influence social change and exacerbate social polarization tendencies within Asia-Pacific cities will surely assume greater theoretical and normative importance over the next decade and beyond.",

            "text": "Sources for this project included extensive site visits and field trips to cities within the Asia-Pacific; communication with numerous colleagues, and key informants; participation in conferences and special workshops; and a review of several distinct literature domains, including the services research literature, Asian urban studies, and the urban change and transformation scholarship. Visits to Chinese and Southeast Asian cities were undertaken as part of a much larger Asian urban research project managed by the UBC Centre for Human Settlements, supported by the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA Centre of Excellence Grant #01866-S39387). This study includes references to research undertaken by colleagues within partner institutions in Asia, as well as theses produced by UBC graduate students supported by this CIDA grant. Site visits and study tours of Japanese cities were enabled by grants from the Japan Foundation, the Japanese Ministry of Education, and the UBC Hampton Research Fund. Fieldwork in San Francisco was supported in part by a grant from the UBC Vice-President's (Research) discretionary fund. An exploratory workshop on 'Service Industries and New Trajectories of Urban Development within the Asia-Pacific', involving many of the leading international scholars in service industry scholarship and in Asian urban studies was convened at the University of British Columbia in March, 2002, generously supported by the Peter Wall Institute for Advanced Studies, UBC. This workshop significantly contributed to new knowledge on the role of service industries in processes of urban change within the Asia-Pacific, substantially informed this current paper, and generated manuscripts to be included in a new book to be co-edited by Peter Daniels (University of Birmingham), Kong Chong Ho (National University of Singapore), and me.I also want to acknowledge the generosity of the Centre for Advanced Studies at the National University of Singapore in making possible my sojourn as Visiting Scholar in July of 2000. This enabled me to liaise with (new and existing) colleagues, to conduct fieldwork, and to present a selection of findings to a CAS colloquium. In particular I would like to express my appreciation to Brenda Yeoh, K.C. Ho, Peggy Teo, and Kris Olds of CAS (the latter now at the Department of Geography, University of Wisconsin at Madison), and to Henry Yeung of the NUS Department of Geography.Finally, I want to acknowledge the essential contributions of UBC colleagues. Michael Leaf (Director, Centre for Southeast Asian Research, and Faculty Associate at CHS) and David Edgington (Director, Centre for Japanese Research, and Associate Professor in the Department of Geography) have generously contributed many expert insights on development planning issues in China, Southeast Asia, and Japan. I am very grateful indeed for the administrative support of Ms Karen Zeller, and the unfailingly professional and patient assistance of Ms Sharon Kong in the preparation of this manuscript; for the high levels of technical assistance provided by Ms Christine Evans; and for the excellent cartographic services of Mr Eric Leinberger of the UBC Department of Geography.",
