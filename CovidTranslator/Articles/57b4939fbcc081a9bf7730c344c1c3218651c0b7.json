Seasonal influenza epidemics account for an annual average of approximately 36,000 deaths and more than 200,000 hospitalizations in the United States. In addition, occasional influenza pandemics with extensive worldwide morbidity and mortality are a feature of human history (Salomon and Webster, 2009 ). The ongoing influenza threat is a consequence of the periodic emergence of variant viruses with diminished susceptibility to pre-existing Ab-mediated immunity in human populations (Subbarao and Joseph, 2007) . Vaccines provide an effective strategy for protection against seasonal and pandemic influenza, but vaccine formulation and manufacture is always play-pomegranate component to the viral envelope glycoprotein of HIV-1 blocked interaction with cell receptors and inhibited infection, but the chemical nature of the active component was not defined (Neurath et al., 2004) .",

Plant PPs may also exert antiviral effects during intracellular replication (Palamara et al., 2005) .

Recently, evidence was presented that pomegranate PPs are directly virucidal for influenza viruses and also act at the intracellular level to inhibit influenza virus replication (Haidari et al., 2009) . The current study focused on the direct anti-influenza virus activity of pomegranate extracts. We demonstrate that influenza viruses representing diverse subtypes were susceptible to rapid inactivation by components of the PP fraction of pomegranates. However, susceptibility to inactivation differed between reassortant H5N1 viruses, indicating modulation by relatively small changes in virion surface glycoproteins. Our findings also indicate that inactivation is primarily a consequence of PP-induced virion structural damage.",

Low concentrations of PPs were therefore present in wells during incubation of the assay and could potentially affect viral titers by blocking viral replication at the cellular level (Haidari et al., 2009) or by reducing MDCK cell viability (Seeram et al., 2005) . In one set of experiments to control for this, the pre-incubation of X31 and PR8 with different POMxp concentrations prior to TCID 50 titration was omitted; instead, the viruses were first combined with POMxp as 10-fold dilutions were prepared over MDCK cell monolayers for TCID 50 titration. Essentially, this approach titrated untreated viruses in wells containing PP concentrations that matched those in wells during titration of POMxp-treated viruses. TCID 50 titers were identical to those measured using PP-free culture medium (data not shown), indicating that the antiviral activity that we describe for POMxp does not reflect effects during TCID 50 titration. Furthermore, analysis by the MTT assay indicated that 24 h incubation of MDCK cells with 160 g/ml PPs (the maximum PP concentration in wells during TCID 50 titration of POMxp-treated viruses) had no (H3N2) at 5 \u00d7 10 7 TCID50/ml was treated for 5 min at room temperature with different concentrations of PJ (A) or POMxl (B), or with a pH-matched buffer.

An important question was whether antiviral activity would be evident against influenza viruses displaying a diversity of envelope glycoproteins, since changes in these molecules typify emerging influenza viruses that threaten human health. To investigate this, POMxp activity was tested against reassortant influenza viruses expressing the HA and neuraminidase (NA) molecules of H5N1 isolates and an isolate of the recent pandemic H1N1 virus of swine origin. The non-HA and NA components of the reassortants were derived from PR8. Compared with the effect against X31 and PR8 ( Fig. 2A and B) , POMxp treatment resulted in only a minor reduction in the infectivity of rg-Dk/HN/02, rg-Dk/LS/02, and rg-JWE/HK/06. However, the infectivity of rg-VN/04 was markedly reduced, resembling the effect of POMxp on X31 (Fig. 3A-D) . Thus, the susceptibility of variant H5N1 subtype viruses to PP treatment is modulated by the nature of the expressed HA and NA. Treatment with sufficiently high concentrations of POMxp completely eliminated the infectivity of the H1N1 viruses NC/99 and rg-CA/09 ( Fig. 3E and F) .

However, the HAg activity of rg-VN/04 and NC/99 was also not lost after treatment with PP concentrations that completely eliminated infectivity, suggesting that effects on infectivity were not simply a consequence of PP coating of viral particles. Surprisingly, the HAg activity of rg-CA/09 was lost after treatment with 50 and 100 g/ml PPs, but not after treatment with higher PP concentrations that eliminated infectivity. Overall, our findings indicate that the effect of PP exposure on HAg activity is not a predictor of effects on infectivity. However, a cautious interpretation is warranted because POMxp itself has HAg activity when the assay is performed in the absence of BSA, and it is not possible to predict the consequences of potential multidirectional interactions when PP-treated viruses are combined with RBC in a BSA solution. In experiments described in this section, X31 was tested in parallel to ensure the reproducibility of earlier findings. The results for X31 matched those shown in Fig. 2A .",

POMxp treatment of plate-bound influenza X31 (H3N2) inhibited the binding of mAbs specific for the H3 and N2 (Fig. 4A) . Interestingly, the inhibitory effect plateaued at high PP concentrations and complete inhibition of mAb binding was not achieved. This residual binding was due to specific mAb-ligand interactions, since the mAbs were not bound in control experiments using plate-bound PR8 (H1N1) instead of X31. POMxp treatment also inhibited the binding of an H5-specific mAb to plate-bound rg-VN/04 (Fig. 4B ) and rg-Dk/HN/02 (Fig. 4C) . Notably, this analysis did not clearly discriminate between X31 and rg-Dk/HN/02, two influenza viruses that were susceptible and resistant, respectively, to the effects of POMxp treatment as assessed by infectivity and HAg assays (compare Figs. 2A and 3B) . Thus, the impression is that PP effects on influenza virus infectivity and HAg activity do not simply reflect the extent of masking of viral surface components by bound PPs. POMxp treatment of plate-bound MHV A59 resulted in some inhibition of binding of a virus-specific polyclonal antiserum (Fig. 4D) .

            "text": "To gain further insights into the mechanism of antiviral activity, viruses were examined by transmission electron microscopy after treatment with 1600 g/ml PPs. This analysis focused on X31 and PR8, which were highly susceptible to inactivation at this PP concentration, and rg-Dk/HN/02 and MHV A59, which were relatively resistant. PP treatment of X31, PR8, and rg-Dk/HN/02, but not MHV A59, significantly increased the proportion of aberrant virions (Table 1) . A high proportion of X31 and PR8 particles showed aberrant morphology after treatment. Interestingly, the morphological changes differed for X31 and PR8. Treated X31 particles featured widespread loss of the ordered arrangement and definition of envelope glycoproteins, as well as envelope irregularities and breaks. The appearance of the envelope glycoproteins of X31 suggested interactions with extraneous material (Fig. 5A and B) . In contrast, a High titer viral preparations were examined after 5 min incubation with PBS (untreated) or 1600 g/ml PPs (treated). b Criteria for scoring aberrant virions, based on comparison with the majority of untreated virions, were envelope breaks and irregularities, and (for influenza viruses) disorganization and loss of definition of envelope glycoproteins. Results were pooled from at least 2 separate experiments for each virus. c Treated X31, PR8, or rg-Dk/HN/02 vs. untreated, P < 0.0001; treated X31 vs. treated rg-Dk/HN/02, P < 0.0001; treated PR8 vs. treated rg-Dk/HN/02, P < 0.02. treated PR8 particles showed varying degrees of fragmentation, but the envelope glycoproteins on unaffected parts of the virion remained ordered and relatively well-defined ( Fig. 5C and D) . The proportion of aberrant virions after PP treatment was significantly smaller for rg-Dk/HN/02 compared with X31 or PR8 (Table 1) , correlating with the relative resistance of rg-Dk/HN/02 to inactivation by PPs. Morphological changes in aberrant rg-Dk/HN/02 virions generally resembled those in PR8 virions ( Fig. 5E and F) . Treatment of MHV A59 had no effect on virion structure based solely on the appearance of the virion envelope. However, the surface glycoprotein spikes of MHV A59 were occasionally less abundant after PP treatment ( Fig. 5G and H) . Generally, there was a tendency for PPtreated virions to aggregate, and this may have contributed to some reduction in infectivity. Overall, our electron microscopic analysis indicates that the antiviral effects of PPs are mediated in different ways depending on the nature of the virus. In the case of influenza virus, our observations suggest that the elimination of infectivity by PPs is primarily a consequence of damage to virion integrity, rather than simply a coating of viral particles.",

            "text": "Our analysis adds to the growing body of literature describing the antiviral activity of PP preparations derived from plants. We show that the PP component of pomegranates rapidly inactivates influenza virus through a direct effect on the viral particle. The antiviral activity of pomegranate PPs was potent against H1N1 and H3N2 influenza viruses and against the reassortant H5N1 virus rg-VN/04. Previous studies demonstrating the anti-influenza activity of PPs from other plant sources have provided evidence for a direct interaction of PPs with the viral HA and NA Nagai et al., 1992; Nakayama et al., 1993; Roschek et al., 2009; Serkedjieva and Manolova, 1992; Song et al., 2005) . This is also likely for pomegranate PPs, since the treatment of influenza viruses with POMxp reduced the binding of HA-and NA-specific mAbs. It is unclear whether PP interactions with viral surface glycoproteins significantly modify molecular structure and antigenic determinants or simply establish a coating that impedes accessibility. Numerous studies that evaluated the effects of a variety of PP preparations on influenza viruses demonstrated an association between loss of infectivity and loss of HAg activity, consistent with PP interactions with the viral HA Haidari et al., 2009; Nagai et al., 1992; Nakayama et al., 1993; Serkedjieva and Manolova, 1992; Song et al., 2005) . This was also the case generated with enzyme-conjugated secondary Abs and substrate. The analysis was also performed using plates coated with influenza PR8 (H1N1) to control for nonspecific adherence of Abs. Each point represents the mean \u00b1 SD for triplicate wells. Results are representative of two separate experiments that gave similar results. in our studies using (in particular) X31 and PR8 ( Fig. 2A and B) . However, for NC/99 (H1N1) and the H5N1 reassortant rg-VN/04, POMxp treatment eliminated infectivity without loss of HAg activity ( Fig. 3A and E) , suggesting mechanisms of viral inactivation in addition to interference with HA function.",

            "text": "PP preparations derived from other plants have been shown to vary in activity against different influenza subtypes as well as variant viruses with a subtype Serkedjieva, 2003) . In our analysis, pomegranate PPs were effective in reducing the infectivity of the reassortant H5N1 virus rg-VN/04, but the effect was much smaller against three other H5N1 reassortants: rg-Dk/HN/02 and rg-Dk/LS/02 (in particular) and rg-JWE/HK/06 ( Fig. 3A-D) . Although POMxp treatment had little effect on the infectivity and HAg activity of rg-Dk/HN/02, it still reduced the binding of an H5-specific mAb (Fig. 4C) , suggesting that PPs interacted directly with the HA of rg-Dk/HN/02 as they did with the HAs of viruses that were far more susceptible to POMxp inactivation. Electron microscopic analysis of POMxp-treated viruses identified clear morphological abnormalities in viruses that were susceptible to inactivation, whereas these changes were less frequent in the relatively resistant rg-Dk/HN/02 ( Fig. 5A-F) . Taken together, our findings indicate that pomegranate PPs bind to diverse influenza virus HAs, but this is not predictive of viral inactivation. Apparently, other mechanisms resulting in structural damage to the virion are responsible for the elimination of infectivity. The distinct appearances of POMxp-treated X31 and PR8 examined by electron microscopy (Fig. 5B and D) are consistent with multiple mechanisms of viral inactivation and raise the possibility that the mechanisms may vary even between relatively similar viruses. In part, our findings are consistent with a recent analysis of the antiviral activity of hydroxytyrosol, a small phenolic derivative of a major polyphenol component of the olive tree. The inactivation of different influenza virus subtypes by direct exposure to hydroxytyrosol was associated with damage to virion integrity, but HA and NA function was unaffected (Yamada et al., 2009 ). Our findings for the H5N1 reassortants and PR8, which have all viral components in common except the HA and NA, identify the HA and NA as key determinants of the susceptibility of influenza viruses to inactivation by pomegranate PPs. Furthermore, relatively small changes in these molecules modulate susceptibility. It is likely that changes in viral surface glycoproteins influence reactivity with PPs, but it is unclear how this may relate to damage to virion integrity. The antiviral mechanism apparently involves direct or indirect effects on the viral envelope, since enveloped viruses are considered more susceptible than non-enveloped viruses (Kotwal, 2008) .",

Our findings also indicate that inactivation is the result of damage to virion structural integrity that may be distinct from effects on HA function. Haidari et al. (2009) also present evidence that, in addition to a direct virucidal effect, pomegranate PPs also act at an intracellular step to inhibit influenza replication. However, it is unclear whether the mechanism of the intracellular effect is distinct from that of direct antiviral activity. One possibility is that the antioxidant properties of PPs counter the pro-oxidant intracellular environment that favors influenza replication (Cai et al., 2003) . It will be of interest to determine whether influenza viruses that are resistant to direct inactivation by pomegranate PPs are also resistant to intracellular antiviral effects.",

This raises the possibility that features of the surface glycoproteins of influenza viruses adapted to maintenance in avian reservoirs may also confer resistance to the effects of PPs. In particular, this may apply to viruses maintained in ducks and other aquatic birds, in which transmission is via the fecal/oral route and is favored by viral persistence in the aquatic environment (Breban et al., 2009) . PPs and the related humic substances, which may also have antiviral activity (Anesio et al., 2004; Kotwal, 2008) , are components of natural organic matter in aquatic environments (Chen et al., 2002) and may be present at sufficient concentrations to exert a selective pressure on influenza viruses. A selective pressure may also operate in the gastrointestinal tract of influenza-infected waterbirds, an environment that is likely rich in PPs. Notably, Serkedjieva (2003) demonstrated that passage of influenza virus in the presence of PPs selected for decreased sensitivity to PP inhibition.",

            "text": "An important consideration is whether PPs derived from pomegranates and other plant sources may be utilized to combat influenza and other viral infections. In our analysis, complete inactivation of the more susceptible influenza virus strains generally required treatment with approximately 1600 g/ml PPs. However, it should be emphasized that the duration of treatment was only 5 min and that titer reductions of 99% or more were frequently observed at 400 g/ml PPs. Haidari et al. (2009) treated an H3N2 influenza virus for 30 min with a pomegranate PP extract and demonstrated significant direct antiviral activity at concentrations of approximately 1 g/ml. Little is known about the metabolism of ingested PPs and whether absorbed constituents contribute to antiviral activity in the body. The benefits of PPs as antivirals for the prophylaxis or treatment of influenza is likely to be optimal when they are applied directly at the site of infection . In mouse model studies, PP administration to the lung reduced the effects of influenza infection without toxicity to the host Nagai et al., 1992; Serkedjieva et al., 2008) . Interestingly, nasopharyngeal administration of pomegranate extracts is a Cuban folk remedy for influenza (Vidal et al., 2003) . Continued characterization of the PP constituents and their derivatives that mediate antiviral activity may lead to inhaled or topically applied preparations that aid in the control of influenza.",
