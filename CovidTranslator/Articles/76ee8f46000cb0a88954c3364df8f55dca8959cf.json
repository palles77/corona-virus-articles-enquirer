Numerous government and partner organizations participate in bringing a vaccine from the bench into the clinic. Table 2 provides links where information about these organizations can be obtained. Before FDA licensure, a new vaccine goes through 10 to 15 years of preclinical testing and clinical trials, costing pharmaceutical companies millions of dollars in new development costs. Before testing the vaccine in humans, a company files an Investigational New Drug application with the FDA followed by three phases of clinical trials that are performed to study vaccine safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy (Table 3 ) [10] . After completion of the prelicensure clinical trials, the manufacturer files a Biologics Licensure Application (BLA), and the FDA, with input from its advisory committee, determines if data support vaccine safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy ( Fig. 1 ) [11] . After licensure, monitoring for rare adverse events continues for some vaccines through formal phase IV trials conducted by the FDA and manufacturer.",

The ACIP comprises 15 voting members appointed by the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services. In addition, several professional medical and public health groups and industry representatives participate in ACIP discussions. To formulate recommendations, the ACIP establishes subject-specific working groups to review and synthesize data months to Ensuring that all US children and adolescents, regardless of health insurance status or income level, have access to recommended immunizations requires a complex system of financing comprised of private and public funding mechanisms (Table 4 ). In 2002, 57% of US children received vaccines purchased through the public sector, and 43% received vaccines purchased through the private sector. Most of the public-purchase vaccines are financed through the Vaccines for Children (VFC) program, an entitlement program established in 1994 as part of the Social Security Act [11, 12] . Other government funding mechanisms include Section 317 of the Public Health Service Act of 1962, a federal grant program, and state and local government funding. These programs provide support for states to provide immunizations to children who do not qualify for the VFC program but who are not covered by private insurance. Fourteen states, referred to as ''universal'' purchase states, use a combination of federal and state funding to purchase and distribute vaccines recommended for children to all immunization providers in private and public sectors. The remaining 36 states purchase vaccines for uninsured and underinsured chil- immunizations in the us dren who are not eligible for VFC. In addition, insurance provides vaccines for children in the private sector.",

The cost of immunizing a child through 6 years of age in 2003 was $436 per child for all vaccines, not including influenza vaccine [12] . Increasingly, state and local health departments are required to make difficult choices about which vaccines to purchase using public funds, including Section 317 grant funds. The recommendation in 2000 to vaccinate routinely with PCV7 doubled the cost of immunizing a child. Section 317 and state funding have not been adequate to cover PCV7 for underinsured children in many states, including 7 of the 14 universal purchase states.

From 2000 through 2005, vaccine shortages and changes in routine recommendations occurred for 9 of the 12 diseases for which childhood and adolescent vaccination is recommended (Fig. 2 ) [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] . The shortages affected millions of children and health care providers, even triggering suspension of vaccine school entry requirements [24, 25] . Two vaccine shortages (PCV7 and tetanus and diphtheria toxoids [Td]) lasted nearly 2 years, one (PCV7) occurred twice [26] , and one (inactivated influenza vaccine, 2004-05 season) halved the US influenza vaccine supply virtually overnight [17, 22] .",

One important long-term factor is the decrease in number of vaccine manufacturers of childhood vaccines routinely recommended in the United States. In 1977, a federal immunization working group expressed concern about the stability of the US vaccine supply in the setting of ''a steady attrition of specific pharmaceutical manufacturers from the entire field of biologics'' [17] . In 1993, six manufactures produced the six vaccines. In 2005, although four vaccines (PCV7, varicella, influenza, and MCV4) have been added to the recommended schedule, the number of manufacturers decreased to five. In addition, there are single manufacturers for four of the childhood and adolescent vaccines (MMR, varicella, PCV7, and MCV4). In response to concerns over fragility of the US vaccine supply, the General Accounting Office and National Vaccine Advisory Committee conducted in-depth reviews of the vaccine shortages and concluded that future disruptions in vaccine supply are likely to continue, and proposed solutions [17, 27] .",

OPV, formerly recommended for routine use in the United States, was associated with vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis (1 case among 2.4 million vaccine doses distributed). This rare adverse event was no longer considered acceptable after elimination of polio in the United States [29] . In 2000, the ACIP recommended using IPV for all doses of polio vaccine. Public perceptions of vaccine safety are a challenge to the continued success of the vaccination program. New parents and younger physicians grew up without appreciation of the morbidity and mortality of immunizations in the us several vaccine-preventable diseases. Risk or perception of risk for adverse events becomes an important concern. Two current prominent public vaccine safety concerns are the perceived causal association between MMR and autism and thimerosal-containing vaccines and autism. As a result of heightened concerns about safety, in 2000 the CDC and National Institutes of Health commissioned the IOM of the National Academy of Science to convene an Immunization Safety Review Committee [30] . Between 2001 and 2004, this independent expert committee published eight reports related to immunization safety concerns. The committee has made recommendations in the areas of public health response, policy review, research, and communications (Box 1). With respect to autism, the IOM concluded that the body of epidemiologic evidence favors rejection of a causal relationship between the MMR vaccine and autism. The committee also concluded that there is no relationship between thimerosal-containing vaccines and autism [30] . None of the eight IOM reports recommended a policy review of the current vaccine recommendations or change in the immunization schedule.",

Intussusception associated with receipt of rotavirus vaccine, leading to the withdrawal of the vaccine from the market in 1999, was an adverse event detected by the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System [31, 32] . A third system is the Vaccine Safety Datalink, which consists of large linked databases from health maintenance organizations. Associations between serious medical events and immunizations can be evaluated through the Vaccine Safety Datalink. The newest system is the Clinical Immunization Safety Assessment Centers network, which consists of selected clinical academic medical centers in partnership with CDC to study the pathophysiology of vaccine reactions and develop clinical management protocols for affected patients [34] .

In 1996, as a result of growing concern about morbidity associated with vaccine-preventable diseases in the hard-to-reach adolescent population, the ACIP recommended expanding efforts to immunize adolescents (11-21 years old) by establishing a routine vaccination visit at 11 to 12 years old [35] . In addition to providing Td and previously missed vaccinations, the report emphasized that this visit should be used to provide other important preventive health services. The anticipated addition of several new adolescent vaccines to the recommended schedule has stimulated a reappraisal of the approaches that most effectively and efficiently would increase the proportion of adolescents who receive newly recommended vaccines and develop ways to integrate these approaches with other adolescent health, education, and development programs.",

The first ACIP hepatitis B recommendation in 1982 was to vaccinate groups known to be at high risk for hepatitis B virus infection, such as health care workers, men who have sex with men, and intravenous drug users [46] . In 1984, the ACIP expanded recommendations to include infants born to mothers who were hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) positive. Recognition of the difficulty in identifying mothers infected with hepatitis B led to a recommendation in 1988 to test all women for HBsAg during the prenatal period. Vaccinating high-risk groups continued to be difficult because no foundation existed to vaccinate adolescents and adults who already were participating in high-risk activities. In 1991, a universal infant vaccination strategy was instituted to achieve the goal of reducing transmission of hepatitis B virus [46] . It is recommended that the first dose be given at or before 2 months of age with a preference for all infants to receive the first dose at birth. Neonatal vaccination works by protecting the infant from contracting hepatitis after vertical or horizontal exposure. Giving all infants the birth dose protects infants whose mothers were not tested for HBsAg during pregnancy. Infant vaccination eventually will provide protection against hepatitis B virus to adolescents who may engage in high-risk activities before exposure. From 1990 to 2002, rates of hepatitis B virus infection in children and adolescents younger than 20 years old declined more than 88% in the United States [47] .",

Similar to other polysaccharide vaccines, MPS induces a T cell-independent immune response resulting in poor long-term immunity and inconsistent immunogenicity in children younger than 2 years old.

Before February 2005, MPS vaccine was recommended for groups at high risk for meningococcal disease and for outbreak control.

Paroxysms, shortness of breath, posttussive vomiting, and difficulty sleeping occur commonly in adolescents with pertussis disease [55, 56] .

A cost-benefit analysis in the United States found universal vaccination for persons 10 to 19 years old to be the most economic strategy [57] . The expected impact of adolescent pertussis vaccination would be to reduce the risk of pertussis in vaccinated adolescents. Ideally, another public health goal of pertussis vaccination is to reduce transmission to infants younger than 6 months old who have not completed the primary vaccination series and are at highest risk of death from pertussis. The role of an adolescent vaccination program in reducing transmission to infants is unknown. Vaccinating mothers and other close family members of young infants, referred to as a ''cocoon strategy,'' is one method under consideration to decrease pertussis transmission to infants. One study suggested that adult family members are the most frequently identified source for pertussis transmission to infants [58] . Universal replacement of the Td booster given every 10 years with Tdap is another strategy being discussed. Finally, vaccinating women during pregnancy and vaccinating neonates against pertussis have been raised as potential strategies to improve control of pertussis, although pertussis vaccines for these indications are unlikely to be licensed in the United States in the near future [59, 60] .",

Papillomaviruses are ubiquitous, have been detected in a wide variety of animals and humans, and are specific to their respective hosts. HPV is associated with a variety of clinical conditions that range from benign skin and mucous membrane lesions to cancer. Most HPV infections are benign. Clinical manifestations with the most frequently associated HPV type are as follows: skin warts (types 1, 2, 3, and 10), recurrent respiratory papillomatosis (types 6 and 11), condyloma acuminata (types 6 and 11), and cervical cancer (types 16, 18, 31, 33, and 45) . Based on the association of HPV with cervical cancer and precursor lesions, HPVs can be grouped into low-risk and high-risk HPV types [61] . In the United States and Europe, HPV 16 accounts for approximately 50% of the cases of cervical cancer, with types 18, 31, and 45 accounting for an additional 25% to 30% of cases [62] .",

Antigenic shifts were the cause of the three influenza pandemics in the twentieth century (Table 7 ) [72] . Minor changes in HA and NA, called antigenic drifts, define the influenza viruses that circulate each year. Influenza vaccines are developed yearly based on antigenic drifts. Worldwide surveillance established by the World Health Organization allows predictions to be made regarding antigenic drifts, which enables vaccine to be updated before the start of an influenza season. Recommendations for which influenza strains should be included in the vaccine are made in early spring before influenza season.

The second is a cold adapted, live, nasally administered vaccine licensed for healthy people 5 to 49 years of age, including close contacts of high-risk persons. The ACIP and AAP recommended in 2004 to expand influenza vaccine recommendations to include all children 6 to 23 months old and household contacts of children up to 23 months old as well as to continue immunization of all children in high-risk groups. This recommendation was made based on epidemiologic data showing that healthy children in this age group are at high risk of hospitalization from influenza, and that deaths in this age group occur [73] [74] [75] [76] . More than 150 reports of pediatric influenzaassociated deaths during the 2003-04 influenza season stimulated the addition [77] . The influenza vaccine is unique to the recommended childhood and adolescent immunization schedule because it is the only vaccine that requires a visit during a certain time of year and that requires annual immunization. Even if the circulating strains of virus are the same as the year before, an annual booster is necessary to retain immunity. In addition, children 6 months to 8 years old are recommended to have two doses of influenza vaccine administered 1 month apart if they previously have never been vaccinated for influenza [76] . Adding influenza into the childhood schedule is challenging for public health officials and primary care physicians developing programs to attain high coverage rates in children 6 to 23 months old.",

DNA vaccines, plasmids of DNA encoding the desired antigen, also are being developed with the intention of simplifying vaccine production and eliminating the possible risk of organism reversion [78] .

The IOM committee considered vaccines that could be licensed within 20 years directed against conditions of domestic health importance [80] . Health benefits of these vaccines were measured by a standard health outcome measure, quality-adjusted life years gained. These vaccines were placed into categories of most favorable to least favorable (Box 2). Since publication of this report, PCV7 has been licensed for infants beginning at 2 months of age (most favorable category), and HPV vaccine (more favorable category) and rotavirus vaccine administered to infants (favorable category) are on the near horizon as discussed in this article. Since release of this report, several organisms not included on the IOM list have emerged or became larger public health threats, including West Nile virus, metapneumovirus, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, the coronavirus associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome Box 2.

The ongoing outbreak of H5N1 influenza in Asia, associated with high mortality rates, has stimulated research of a vaccine that has the potential to thwart a possible major influenza pandemic. Circulating H5N1 viruses may adapt to humans through genetic mutation or reassortant with human influenza strains, allowing for human-to-human transmission, facilitated by the fact that most humans lack preexisting immunity owing to lack of previous exposure [81] . These emerging infectious diseases and the need to prevent them add further complexity to immunization schedules of the future.",

The impact of future vaccines in the United States will be more difficult to calculate because they will prevent fewer deaths than vaccines in the past. The cost of these vaccines will continue to increase, and funding support will be challenged. The risk of adverse vaccine events will have to be weighed against the risk of the disease if not vaccinated. Pediatric health care providers face a growing complexity of problems in children, including injury, obesity, asthma, and mental health and behavioral disorders. As the cost and complexity of the childhood and adolescent immunization schedule increase, considering the role of immunizations within the context of other preventive health interventions and overall societal values becomes increasingly important. Immunizations are one of the most effective clinical preventive services in pediatric practice [15] . Despite the challenges facing the US immunization program, immunizations will likely remain on the list of great public health accomplishments of the twenty-first century, and the legacy of Jenner will continue.",
