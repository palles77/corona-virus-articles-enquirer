It might be wise to use this amount of total water intake as a starting point for these small birds. Using the dose in mg/kcal and a drinking water intake of 0.5 ml/kcal, the drug concentration per liter will be independent of the species and therefore the same for all birds (Tables 2 and 3 ).

The birds are in the aviary all year with a shed for shelter and a fly-pen outside. Planted aviaries are popular for these passerines because the vegetation provides observers a more natural view of a bird's behavior. Diseas \ufffd control in planted aviaries presents difficulties related to controlling microorganisms and medicating individual birds.13 Natural vegetation, htiwever, is often nec essary to obtain good breeding results. In breeding aviaries (located in a garden house or in a loft), housing depends on the season. Canaries are mostly bred indoors. In the breed ing season, the birds are mostly kept in couples in small boxlike cages (50 x 40 X 40 cm). Normally the fancier breeds two to three rounds. The weanlings are housed in communal flights with or without outside quarters. In the winter season (resting season) the male and female birds are housed as separate groups in pens. For treatment purposes, this means that all birds are the same species and have the same average BW and water intake. They are also sensitive to the same infectious agents, and all birds must therefore be treated at the same time. The movement of birds in and out the aviary for shows includes the risk of introducing outside infection. Adequate cleaning of the facility, because of many small cages, is sometimes difficult. Owners must therefore be educated about proper hygiene.The mynahs are mostly kept in aviaries because of their need for mobility (rather than housing them in an indoor cage). Mynahs make a mess of their food and produce much, and often fluid, droppings, which makes them less suitable as indoor house pets.The toucans and other ramphastids are most commonly kept in captivity as breeding pairs in large flights with numerous, variably sized perches. Like the mynahs, they are active, inquisitive birds that are carnivorous, and if housed in mixed aviaries, they can consume smaller aviary inhabitants or intruding sparrows.",

The incident of internal parasites in captive rampha stids is quite low. Ascarides, Capillaria sp., and gizzard worms (Tetrameres sp.) are occasionally noted in toucans and mynahs. Nematodes. Two main types of roundworms can affect passerines: Ascaridia sp., which have a direct life cycle, and Porrocaecum sp., which have indirect life cycles, with invertebrates such as earthworms as the intermediate host. Ascarides are also frequently encountered in toucans. Fenbendazole, piperazine, levamisole, and ivermectin, all orally sup plied, are useful in treating ascarid infections. Capillaria spp. These are cosmopolitan in their distribution and affect a range of passerines, including mynahs and ramphastids. Tr eat ment can be more difficult than for ascarides. Aviary hygiene and removal of earthworms are important control measures. Anthelmintics are effective in some cases. In a cleaned, dry envir_ onment, the eggs lose their infectious capacity within 3 weeks without further disinfection. 12 Syngamus trachea. Syngamus trachea (gape wo , m) is found as an infection in outdoor aviaries and is a serious problem in mynahs, cor vids, and starlings. Ivermectin (injection 5 \u00b5g/kcal) and levamisole or fenbendazole are effective in treating this parasite, but caution should be exercised when treating birds with heavy infections, because the dead worms can obstruct the trachea. In such cases treatment with a low-dose anthelmintic, especially fenbendazole, over several days is an effective therapeutic plan. Spiruroids. Geopetitia aspiculata is a parasite that lives in the proven triculus and has been reported in six avian orders, including Passeri formes (e.g., Emberizidae, Estrildidae, Fringillidae, Icteridae, Sturdidae [including a hill mynah]), and insect-eating Piciformes (e.g., barbets and woodpeckers). Infected birds were treated successfully with ivermectin (5 to 10 \u00b5g/kcal SC) or fenbendazole (0.032 mg/kcal PO for 3 days). Reduction of the intermediate host interrupts the development cycle of the parasite. Acuaria skrj abini. Infections of the gizzard with mucosa! necrosis were reported in adult finches in Australia. Oral treatment with levami sole 80 mg/ L or fenbendazole 50 mg/ L of drinking water for 3 days was effective. Feeding live food (e.g., maggots, mealworms, or termites) increases the risk because insects are the intermediate hosts for giz zardworms and tapeworms. Tapeworm (Cestoda) Infestations. These are common in softbills and insectivorous finches. Effective treatment for passerines includes praziquantel and oxfenbendazole. Trematodes. Trematodes are seen only occasionally in wild-caught passerines. Schistosoma sp. are trematodes that live in blood vessels and have been reported in North American goldfinches and cardinals. Prosthogonimus sp. are trematodes affecting the intestinal tract, cloaca, bursa, or oviduct. These parasites have been found worldwide in passer-ines and are not particularly pathogenic. Praziquantel (0.25 mg / kcal) is useful in treating trematodes.",
