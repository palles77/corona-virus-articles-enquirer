            "text": "Coronaviruses are positive-strand RNA viruses that translate their genome RNA into polyproteins that are co-and posttranslationally processed into intermediate and mature replicase nonstructural proteins (nsps). In murine hepatitis virus (MHV), nsps 1, 2, and 3 are processed by two papain-like proteinase activities within nsp3 (PLP1 and PLP2) to yield nsp1, an nsp2-3 intermediate, and mature nsp2 and nsp3. To determine the role in replication of processing between nsp2 and nsp3 at cleavage site 2 (CS2) and PLP1 proteinase activity, mutations were engineered into the MHV genome at CS2, at CS1 and CS2, and at the PLP1 catalytic site, alone and in combination. Mutant viruses with abolished cleavage at CS2 were delayed in growth and RNA synthesis but grew to wild-type titers of >10 7 PFU/ml. Mutant viruses with deletion of both CS1 and CS2 exhibited both a delay in growth and a decrease in peak viral titer to \u03f310 4 PFU/ml. Inactivation of PLP1 catalytic residues resulted in a mutant virus that did not process at either CS1 or CS2 and was severely debilitated in growth, achieving only 10 2 PFU/ml. However, when both CS1 and CS2 were deleted in the presence of inactivated PLP1, the growth of the resulting mutant virus was partially compensated, comparable to that of the CS1 and CS2 deletion mutant. These results demonstrate that interactions of PLP1 with CS1 and CS2 are critical for protein processing and suggest that the interactions play specific roles in regulation of the functions of nsp1, 2, and 3 in viral RNA synthesis.",

All coronaviruses encode a 3C-like proteinase (3CLpro) within nsp5 (30) , responsible for processing nsps 4 through 16 (6, 16, 17, 31) . The processing of nsps 1 through 3 is mediated by one or two papain-like proteinase (PLP) activities within nsp3 (4, 5, 19, 26, 45, 50) . Group 1 and group 2a coronaviruses, such as human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E) and MHV, respectively, encode two PLPs, PLP1 and PLP2 (also known as PLpro1 and PLpro2, respectively). Group 2b and group 3 coronaviruses, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), respectively, encode only one enzymatically active PLP in the position of PLP2. IBV possesses an inactive remnant of PLP1, while SARS-CoV does not possess a PLP1 sequence (42) (Fig. 1B) . The observation that different coronaviruses successfully process nsps 1 to 3 using only one active PLP has led some investigators to propose that PLP2 is a dominant or requisite cooperative proteinase activity even where PLP1 has been shown to be active in vitro (50) .",

The substrate specificity of SARS-CoV PLP (P4-LXGG-P1) is shared by most coronavirus PLP2 enzymes and some PLP1 enzymes (44) . The sequence specificity is restricted by large, hydrophobic, and/or aromatic residues surrounding the active site that are proposed to inhibit access of nonglycine amino acid side chains.

The study demonstrated that, while cleavage between nsp1 and nsp2 was not required for viral replication, blocking this processing event resulted in a decrease in viral growth, RNA synthesis, and cytopathic effect (CPE). In contrast to earlier studies of polyprotein processing that used inhibitors to block all proteinase activity (28) , the study demonstrated that genetic impairment or elimination of specific polyprotein processing events could still yield infectious virus. CS1 is cleaved cotranslationally during infection with wild-type MHV, with no detectable nsp1-containing intermediate. In contrast, the second cleavage site, CS2, connects nsp2 (65 kDa) and nsp3 (210 kDa) in a 275-kDa intermediate protein (previously reported as p290 or p250) that is detectable in infected cells with a half-life of 30 to 60 min and ultimately processed at CS2 to yield nsp2 and nsp3 (14, 40) . Both the intermediate nsp2-3 and the mature products nsp2 and nsp3 are simultaneously detectable, presumably due to the continuous translation of the replicase polyprotein throughout infection (14) . Thus, it had not been determined whether proteolytic maturation of a confirmed intermediate nsp such as nsp2-3 could be blocked and still yield infectious virus.",

Mutant viral genomes were engineered encoding substitutions at CS2 that were predicted either to allow or to abolish cleavage, based on in vitro studies. Infectious mutant viruses were recovered with mutations at CS2, inactivation of PLP1, and deletions of both CS1 and CS2, as well as deletions of both cleavage sites and inactivation of PLP1. While mutant viruses with noncleaving mutations at CS2 showed delayed growth but wild-type peak titers, mutant viruses with abolished processing at both CS1 and CS2, either by cleavage site deletion or PLP1 inactivation, were both delayed and impaired in growth and RNA synthesis. These results indicate that regulated processing of nsps 1, 2, and 3 is essential for both the optimal timing and extent of viral RNA synthesis and productive virus infection.",

Briefly, for MHV, plasmids containing the seven cDNA cassettes of the MHV genome were digested using MluI, BsmBI, and SfiI for fragment A, BglI and BsmBI for fragments B and C, BsmBI and NciI for fragments D and E, BsmBI for fragment F, and SfiI and BsmBI for fragment G. Digested, gel-purified fragments were ligated together in a total reaction volume of \u03f3170 l overnight at 16\u00b0C. Following chloroform extraction and isopropanol precipitation of ligated DNA, capped, polyadenylated full-length RNA transcripts of MHV infectious cDNA were generated in vitro using the Message Machine T7 Transcription Kit (Ambion) following the manufacturer's protocol with modifications. Fifty-microliter reactions were supplemented with 7.5 l of 30 mM GTP, and transcription was performed at 40.5\u00b0C for 25 min, 37.5\u00b0C for 50 min, and 40.5\u00b0C for 25 min (B. Yount and R. S. Baric, personal communication). In parallel, capped, polyadenylated RNA transcripts encoding the MHV nucleocapsid protein (N) were generated in vitro using N cDNA generated from PCR (49) . N transcripts and mutant MHV transcripts were then mixed and electroporated into BHK-MHVR cells. Briefly, BHK-MHVR cells were grown to subconfluence, trypsinized, and then washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and resuspended in PBS at a concentration of 10 7 cells/ml. Six hundred microliters of cells was then added to RNA transcripts in a 4-mm gap electroporation cuvette (BTX), and three electrical pulses of 850 V at 25 F were delivered with a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser Xcell electroporator. Transfected cells were then seeded onto a layer of 10 6 uninfected DBT cells in a 75-cm 2 flask and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 30 h.

To test requirements for processing nsp2-3 into nsp2 and nsp3, mutations were introduced in the genome that resulted in substitutions at the P2, P1, and P1\u0408 sites of CS2 (Fig. 2) . on March 20, 2020 by guest http://jvi.asm.org/ quenced across the cleavage site and the 400 nt flanking each side of the cleavage site, all viruses had retained the engineered mutations, both prior to and following plaque purification. While some CS2 mutants exhibited plaque sizes substantially smaller than those of wild-type virus (VURGs 4, 8, 9, and 16), plaque sizes were homogeneous for each mutant both prior to and following plaque purification (data not shown). CS2 mutants differ in their processing phenotypes. Our previous studies of the nsp12nsp2 cleavage site (CS1) demonstrated a direct correlation between small plaque size and inhibition of cleavage (18) . Ten of 14 mutants with changes at CS2 had plaque sizes indistinguishable from those of wild-type virus, suggesting a possible correlation between plaque size and CS2 processing. To assess this, we examined processing phenotypes for these viruses. DBT cells were either mock infected or infected with wtic or CS2 mutant viruses (VURGs 1 to 16), and cells were then labeled with [ 35 S]Met-Cys. Cytoplasmic extracts were prepared and immunoprecipitated with antibodies against nsp1, nsp2, and nsp3 (Fig. 3A) . Based on in vitro results, VURG1 (P1-Gly) and VURG2 (P2-Ser) mutants were predicted to allow cleavage. During infection, both mutants processed nsp2 and nsp3 with the same timing and com-pleteness as wild-type virus. In contrast, the other CS2 mutants had processing at CS2 that varied from 0% to 100% compared to wild-type virus. The VURG4, -8, -9, and -16 mutants produced a nonprocessed nsp2-3 protein and little or no detectable mature nsp2 or nsp3. To test whether CS2 processing in these mutants was delayed rather than abolished, pulse-chase analysis of nsp2-3 expression and processing was performed (Fig. 3B ). wtic and VURG1 (P1-Gly) had the same pattern of nsp2 expression, showing small amounts of nsp2 following the 60-min pulse (chase 0) and greater amounts following the 90-min chase (chase 90). In all noncleaving mutants, nsp2-3 was not further processed during the chase period.",

In general, substitutions in the virus that recapitulated the substitutions tested in vitro demonstrated similar processing phenotypes. In particular, VURG3 (P2-Gly) closely recapitulated the in vitro phenotype, processing 22% of CS2 compared to wild-type virus. A notable exception to the similarities between the effect of substitution in vitro and in the context of infection was the P1-Ala residue of CS2. While in vitro studies indicated that the P1-Ala residue of CS2 required a small, uncharged amino acid to maintain cleavage (5) , substitution in the virus at P1 by Thr, Arg, or His maintained CS2 cleavage at or near wild-type levels. Additionally, there were clearly nontolerated changes. Specifically, P2, P1, and P1\u0408 residues could not be deleted, double substitutions of P2-P1 could not be cleaved efficiently, and substitution of proline at the P1 position abolished cleavage. Otherwise, even bulky or charged residues at P1 or P1\u0408 allowed at least partial cleavage at CS2. These results suggest that there is significant flexibility at these residues for recognition and processing by viral proteinases during polyprotein expression and processing in viral infection.",

To test this hypothesis, a construct was engineered in which both CS1 and CS2 were deleted (VURG17) (Fig. 2B) . Following electroporation of full-length genomic RNA containing both mutations, cells exhibited pro- To determine if VURG17 was capable of processing nsp1, nsp2, and nsp3, DBT cells were infected, and radiolabeled viral proteins were detected by immunoprecipitation of cell lysates using antibodies against nsp1, nsp2, and nsp3, as well as nsp8 as a control for 3CLpro-mediated processing (Fig. 6, lanes 1 to  5) . The results were compared to wild-type virus (lane 2), the CS1 deletion mutant (\u232cCS1, lane 3) and the CS2 deletion mutant (VURG16, lane 4). Processing by 3CLpro was intact for all wild-type and mutant viruses, as indicated by the presence of mature nsp8 3CLpro cleavage product. During wtic infection, mature nsp1 (28 kDa), nsp2 (65 kDa), and nsp3 (210 kDa) were detected, as was the intermediate nsp2-3 (275 kDa). For the \u232cCS1 mutant, while nsp1, nsp2, and nsp2-3 were not detected, nsp3 was detected, as well as a new nsp1-2-3 precursor (303 kDa) and a noncleaved nsp1-2 protein (93 kDa; this protein is detected either as a single band or as a doublet with no apparent correlation with differing experimental conditions). For VURG17 (lane 5), no mature nsp1, nsp2, nsp3, or intermediate nsp2-3 proteins were detected; rather, only a 303-kDa nsp1-2-3 precursor was detected. Compared with the \u232cCS1 and VURG16 alone, the amount of protein produced during VURG17 infection was reduced, consistent with the decreased growth.

A possible explanation for this difference was that the VURG19 still allowed binding of the inactive proteinase to CS1 and/or CS2 but not processing and release of the cleaved proteins, resulting in even more impaired protein function.

While our previous work showed that CS1 and even the entire nsp2 could be deleted in viable mutant viruses, the present study demonstrates that all cleavages mediated by PLP1 can be eliminated, as can the proteinase activity of PLP1. However, this study also shows that while a noncleaved nsp1-2-3 precursor can mediate all required steps in virus replication, the regulation of polyprotein processing into intermediate and mature forms of nsp1, nsp2, and nsp3 is important for both the timing and extent of viral RNA synthesis and the production of infectious virus particles.",

            "text": "The processing network of PLP1, CS1, and CS2. The coronaviruses use either one or two PLP activities in nsp3 to process the first three cleavage sites in the replicase polyprotein, CS1, CS2, and CS3, in order to liberate intermediate and mature forms of nsp1, nsp2, and nsp3. In vitro studies have demonstrated that there are combinations of independent, dominant, and potentially cooperative activities of PLP1 and PLP2 at CS1, CS2, and CS3 for the human coronavirus HCoV-229E (51) . In vitro results indicate that the 229E PLP2 is able to cleave at CS2 in the absence of PLP1 function, while an inactive PLP2 inhibits the activity of PLP1 at CS2. Thus, it was proposed that PLP2 is the dominant proteinase responsible for cleavage at CS2 and CS3, while PLP1 likely serves as the dominant or only proteinase for cleavage at CS1 (51) . We tested this model during MHV infection by comparing the on March 20, 2020 by guest http://jvi.asm.org/ processing of CS1, CS2, and CS3 in wild-type virus and mutants with deletion or inactivation of CS1, CS2, and PLP1. VURG17 and VURG19 had the same processing phenotype, with no cleavage at CS1 or CS2 but with intact processing at CS3. VURG19 demonstrated that processing at CS3 can occur in the absence of active PLP1, supporting in vitro results (27) and providing the first genetic confirmation in a virus that PLP2 alone is responsible for cleaving CS3. In contrast, there was no evidence of cleavage at either CS1 or CS2 in VURG19 infection. This result argues strongly that during MHV infection in culture, PLP1 is the dominant or only proteinase responsible for cleavage at CS1 and CS2 and that there is no cooperative processing by PLP2 at either CS1 or CS2. This result is different from that observed in vitro with HCoV-229E PLP1 and PLP2 cleavage of substrates containing CS1 and CS2 (51) . There are several possible explanations for the differences. The nsp1, nsp2, and nsp3 of MHV and HCoV-229E are from different coronavirus groups, have different sizes, and have limited amino acid similarity. In addition, the HCoV-229E CS1 and CS2 conform more closely to the proposed recognition sites of PLP2 than do the CS1 and CS2 of MHV. Thus, it is possible that MHV PLP1 and PLP2 interactions with CS1 and CS2 differ from those of 229E. However, the observations obtained with 229E constructs were not confirmed in the context of infection as were our results with MHV, and, thus, the differences may reflect the comparative complexity of the environment in which the protein expression and processing occurs. Thus, it is possible that in vitro results for any coronavirus may demonstrate potential activities and interactions that do not occur during virus infection.",

It is possible that the Cys1121Ala and Trp1122Ala substitutions of VURG19 could alter an existing cooperative interaction of PLP2 with PLP1 at CS1 or CS2. Alternatively, it is possible that inactive PLP1 could retain the ability to interact with or bind to CS1 or CS2 without effecting cleavage and thereby mask or block any cooperative or compensatory activity of PLP2 at these sites. Testing this hypothesis would require deletion of the PLP1 domain in the presence of intact CS1, CS2, and PLP2. This might prove difficult, based on the fact that we were unable to recover a mutant with deletion of only Cys1121 and Trp1122, arguing that other functions or critical structural roles may be mediated by the PLP1 domain of nsp3. Regardless, it remains clear that during infection, PLP2 does not have dominant or compensatory cleavage activity in the presence of inactive PLP1.",

Determinants of processing at CS2 have been examined in vitro (5) , and the studies revealed somewhat less stringent requirements than those defined at CS1 (19, 25) , though results did suggest a requirement for a small, uncharged residue at the P1 position (5). In our current study, substitution or deletion at CS2 P2 and P1\u0408 likewise showed tremendous flexibility for substitutions that still allowed cleavage, in several cases matching the efficiency of the wild-type CS2 sequence. While many substitutions recapitulated the partial processing phenotypes observed during in vitro studies, a notable exception was the P1 position. In contrast to the apparent requirement for a small amino acid at P1 for CS2 cleavage vitro, in the context of infection, nonconservative changes were tolerated at P1, and mutant viruses still retained cleavage efficiency at or near wild-type levels, including replacement of P1-Ala with Arg, Thr, or His. In the face of this flexibility at CS2, there were some limitations on changes, specifically that the P2, P1, and P1\u0408 residues could not be deleted.",

The answer may lie in differing requirements in the larger context of the flanking P5-P5\u0408 residues of each cleavage site, differing requirements for processing from the nascent polyprotein in the context of infection, and possibly in other requirements for protein functions or interactions in vivo during infection of animals. Finally, it is possible that the differences are a manifestation of a requirement that CS1 is cleaved cotranslationally, followed by the ordered, posttransational processing of a nsp2-3 precursor into mature nsp2 and nsp3.",

The results in this report support the conclusion that there is an intimate link between PLP1 activity, processing of the nsp1-2-3 precursor, and regulation of viral RNA synthesis. There is precedent for such regulation in other positive-strand RNA viruses, specifically the alphaviruses, in which negative-strand and positive-strand RNA synthesis is regulated by the processing of the replicase polyprotein P1234 (13, 22, 37, 47) . In the coronaviruses, the ORF1a and ORF1ab polyproteins are processed into several intermediate proteins prior to maturation cleavage of nsp1 to nsp16 (15, 18, 20, 21, 40) . Most relevant to this report, MHV nsp1 is cotranslationally cleaved at CS1, followed by PLP2-mediated cleavage at CS3 between nsp3 and nsp4. Noncleaved nsp2-3 is detected as an intermediate with a half-life of 30 to 60 min during infection but ultimately is processed by PLP1 at CS2 to liberate nsp2 and nsp3 proteins. Interestingly, our previous study showed that mutant viruses in which nsp2 had been deleted and which contained a chimeric CS1-CS2 cleavage site between nsp1 and nsp3 had decreased overall RNA synthesis and growth but no delay in RNA synthesis or extension of the eclipse phase of virus growth (20) . In that study, processing of the chimeric site between nsp1 and nsp3 appeared to be cotranslational, with no intermediate nsp1-3 precursor detected. Together, these studies suggest that processing at CS1 is critical for the amount of RNA synthesis and new infectious virus, while processing at CS2 is involved in regulation of the timing and progression of RNA synthesis and production of infectious virus. The observation that nsp2 can be completely deleted further suggests that release of mature nsp3 may be the critical event regulated by processing of CS2.",

VURG17 and VURG19 had identical protein processing phenotypes, but VURG19 was profoundly growth impaired in comparison to VURG17, a growth impairment that was compensated in the combination mutant, VURG21. Since there are several confirmed and predicted functions in nsp3 in addition to proteinase activities (33) (34) (35) (36) and since all of nsp2 and the carboxy-terminal half of nsp1 can be deleted in viable mutants (9, 20) , we propose that the observed differences in the mutant viruses are due to changes in nsp3 functions resulting from differential folding of nsp1-2-3. According to this model, in VURG17, the active PLP1 would not recognize or interact with the polyprotein at the deleted CS1 or CS2 sites, and the noncleaved nsp1-2-3 protein could affect the delayed and impaired, but ultimately complete, RNA synthesis program required for productive infection. This model further predicts that VURG19, while abolished in PLP1 catalytic activity, would retain the capacity to recognize and interact with intact CS1 and/or CS2, further impairing the residual function of the nsp1-2-3. Finally, this model would account for observation that VURG21 has the same growth phenotype as VURG17, since the deletion of CS1 and CS2 would presumably eliminate recognition by the inactive PLP1 and restore the sufficient, albeit impaired, functions of nsp1-2-3.",

However, once CPE and virus were detectable, VURG19 reproducibly formed plaques and grew consistently at \u03f310 2 PFU/ml. This late detection indicated that extremely low levels of replication were occurring and that the emergence of VURG19 required an adaptive response under selective pressure. The rapid reversion of the single-nucleotide mutation in VURG18 supports this likelihood. Since inactivation of CS1 and CS2 in VURG21 partially compensated the defect of VURG19, we sequenced VURG19 across the cleavage site coding region; however, no coding or noncoding changes were identified (data not shown). Thus, we propose that other compensating mutation(s) have been selected in VURG19 that are distinct from PLP1, CS1, or CS2. We are currently determining if the further compensatory adaptation can be selected during passage and if specific changes are present across the entire virus genome. Overall, the ability to recover and analyze mutant viruses with stable changes in cleavage sites and proteinases provides a powerful tool to define interactions and functions of nsp1, nsp2 and nsp3, their precursors, and the functional group that includes the proteinases, cleavage sites, and regulated processing of these proteins.",

The putative ORF1ab fusion polyprotein is shown, with mature nsp domains indicated by vertical lines and numbers. Viral PLP domains of nsp3 are shown as dashed boxes, and the viral 3C-like proteinase (nsp5) is indicated by a black box.
