By adaptive mutation, avian influenza viruses appear to have the capacity to become highly pathogenic to humans and also readily transmissible between humans, both of which are essential for a pandemic to occur. The final prerequisite for pandemic disease-a global population with no immunity to the virus-already exists.",

If a H5N1 pandemic were to occur this winter, would we have a vaccine, have enough antiviral drugs, or be ready to provide the medical care for the hundreds of millions who would become infected and ill?

In the pre-SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) era, achieving the necessary cooperation in containment strategies (such as those listed previously) would have been deemed unrealistic, unprecedented, and highly unlikely to happen. Our success in controlling SARS (ie, a communicable respiratory illness with high mortality, no effective treatment or vaccine, and multiple established foci of disease all over the world) purely through public health measures demonstrates that when the stakes are high, international cooperation in public health can be achieved. 18, 19 If we have pandemic avian influenza, the stakes will never have been higher.",

This should be anticipated and publicly acknowledged to prevent panic. However, these conditions do not mean that epidemic or, especially, pandemic human disease is imminent, considering that since 2003 more than 100 million domestic and wild birds have been infected throughout Asia and these birds lived among several billion humans, including many rural farmers who have been in direct contact with infected birds. Despite this, less than 130 human cases have been reported to date, nearly all in individuals with very close and prolonged contact with birds. Moreover, there have been no documented human cases outside of the cluster of affected Southeast Asian countries. It must be reemphasized that major genetic alterations in the virus will have to occur before rapid human-to-human spread-vis-\u00e0-vis epidemic and, ultimately, pandemic disease-is likely to occur.",
