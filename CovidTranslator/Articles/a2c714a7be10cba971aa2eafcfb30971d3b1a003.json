Aggressive quarantine measures, possibly aided by rising summer temperatures, successfully terminated the first eruption of SARS and provided at least a temporal break, which allows us to consolidate what we have learned so far and plan for the future. Here, we review the genomics of the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV), its phylogeny, antigenic structure, immune response and potential therapeutic interventions should the SARS epidemic flare up again.",

During the period from 16 November 2002 to 9 February 2003, 305 cases and five deaths due to atypical pneumonia, which were originally thought to be caused by Chlamydia pneumoniae, occurred in the southern Chinese province of Guangdong 5 . A Chinese doctor who had been treating patients in Guangdong spread the infection outside of mainland China when he travelled to Hong Kong on 21 February 2003. There, while resident on the ninth floor of the Hotel Metropole, the patient developed symptoms and was transferred to the hospital on 22 February where he died the following day. Subsequently, ten secondaryinfected guests of the hotel (eight from the ninth floor and two from the eleventh and fourteenth floors) boarded planes and carried the infection to Singapore, Vietnam, Canada and the United States, making SARS the first epidemic to be transmitted by air travel. When the epidemic finally waned after more than 100 days, the WHO counted a cumulative number of 8,098 probable SARS cases and 774 deaths worldwide, in a geographical area spanning 29 countries 6 .",

The association of the virus with the disease was confirmed when macaques that were inoculated with the virus developed symptoms similar to those observed in human cases of SARS 9, 10 .

However, a second search by another group failed to reveal any trace of SARS-CoV in more than 60 animal species, including 76 palm civets 14 . Although unlikely, the possibility that humans infected these SARS-positive animals cannot be formally excluded. In the meantime, over 30 different SARS-CoV isolates have been sequenced, which will hopefully allow us to trace the chain of transmission back to its origin. The SARS epidemic, which caused global panic and huge economical damage to the Asian economy, was contained primarily by aggressive quarantine measures. Additional beneficial factors could include the attenuation of the virus following prolonged passage through the human population, or the onset of summer, as higher temperatures generally decrease the incidence of at least some respiratory infections.",

            "text": "A natural reservoir for the virus could serve as the launch pad for another SARS outbreak during the next winter-spring season. If we are lucky, however, the ability of this virus to cross the species barrier could be the result of a rare series of events that is unlikely to be repeated. A retrospective serological study did not detect anti-SARS-CoV antibodies in a normal population, assumptions about the function of the remaining proteins can be made by analogy with other coronaviruses, although our knowledge about the biological functions of these proteins is also incomplete (see TABLE 1 for information on the encoded proteins). Together with host factors, some of these proteins might form the viral replication-transcription machinery that is associated with the membranous structures in the infected cells 23, 24 . (The peculiar features of the replication cycle of coronaviruses are described in BOX 1.) The remaining 3\u2032 part of the genome encodes four structural proteins that are arranged in the same order in all papain-like cysteine protease (PLpro) and the 3C-like cysteine protease (3CLpro), cleave the polyprotein into individual polypeptides, which provide all the proteins that are required for replication and transcription 20, 21 . Wheareas group 2 coronaviruses contain two paralogous PLpros (PL1pro and PL2pro), only one is found in the ORF1a of the SARS-CoV genome. ORF1b encodes a helicase with ATPase and DNA (and possibly also RNA) duplex-unwinding activities, at least when it is expressed in Escherichia coli 20 . Computational analysis predicted that the carboxy-terminus of ORF1b encodes a mRNA cap-1 methyltransferase 22 . Some Finally, at the 3\u2032 end of the genome, a second 340nucleotide UTR, which is followed by a poly(A) tract, was found. This 3\u2032 UTR contains a 32-nucleotide stem-loop II-like motif (s2m) motif, which has also been reported in astroviruses, in one equine rhinovirus and avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) 28 . A typical feature of coronaviruses is the presence of a transcription-regulatory sequence (TRS) that is important in RNA transcription and regulation (FIGS 2 and 3). This short motif is usually found at the 3\u2032 end of the leader RNA and, with a few exceptions, precedes each translated ORF 29 . When Thiel and colleagues 20 isolated one genomic and eight subgenomic RNAs from the FRA strain and sequenced their 5\u2032 ends, they identified a conserved sequence (5\u2032ACGAAC3\u2032) that was located in coronaviruses: S, spike protein; E, envelope protein; M, membrane glycoprotein; and N, nucleocapsid protein. Furthermore, the structural protein region of the SARS-CoV genome contains several genes that encode additional non-structural proteins that are known as 'accessory genes' (FIG. 3) . Some of these molecules seem to be dispensable for virus viability both in vitro and in vivo; their deletion creates viruses that are attenuated [25] [26] [27] . These accessory genes differ significantly among the three coronavirus groups -they are also referred to as group-specific genes. The SARS-CoV has eight predicted ORFs of unknown function in this region of the genome. It lacks the haemagglutinin esterase (HE) gene, which is encoded by almost all of the group 2 viruses. The analyses are based on the sequence of the SARS-CoV FRA isolate (GenBank accession number AY310120). Transmembrane domains (TMDs) were predicted using the program PSORT (threshold is less than \u22122); the glycosylation sites were predicted using the NetNGlyc server (see NetNGlyc in the Online links). Information on the functional predictions has been taken from REFS 20,33. Nsp, non-structural protein.",

The life cycle of a coronavirus starts when the spike (S) protein, which forms the distinctive, eponymous crown that is observed with coronaviruses, interacts with a receptor through its S1 domain. The entry, which is probably mediated by the S2 domain, occurs by membrane fusion. The RNA genome is then released into the cytoplasm where replication takes place.

            "text": "Cleavage by virally encoded proteinases yields the components that are necessary to assemble the viral replication complex, which synthesizes full-length negative-strand RNA. In addition, a discontinuous transcription strategy during negative-strand synthesis produces a nested set of sub-genomic negative-sense RNAs. In this process, the transcription regulatory sequence (TRS), which is present at the 3\u2032 end of the leader sequence and, with a few exceptions, upstream of each translated gene, is important. It is postulated to fuse the 3\u2032 ends of the nascent subgenomic minus strands to the antisense leader sequence. These discontinuously synthesized minus strands then act as templates for the synthesis of positive-sense mRNAs. An alternative hypothesis proposes that these mRNA molecules are generated by discontinuous transcription during positive-strand synthesis (the figure shows the positive-sense mRNA products). In almost all cases, only the most 5\u2032 ORF is translated. Nucleocapsid (N) protein and genomic RNA assemble in the cytoplasm to form the helical nucleocapsid. This core structure acquires its envelope by budding through intracellular membranes between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the golgi apparatus. The membrane (M), envelope (E) and S proteins, all of which will be accommodated by the lipid bilayer, are transported through the ER to the budding compartment, where the nucleocapsid probably interacts with the M protein to trigger assembly. During the transport of the virus through the golgi apparatus, sugar moieties are modified and in some, but not all, coronaviruses the S protein is cleaved into S1 and S2 domains. Any S protein that is not incorporated into the virions is transported to the cell surface. Finally, the virus is released from the host cell by fusion of virion-containing vesicles with the plasma membrane. The common leader sequence on the 5\u2032 end of each mRNA is shown in red. 13 . This observation raises the intriguing hypothesis that the 29-nucleotide deletion that has been observed in most human isolates could have increased the fitness of the virus in human hosts and allowed the spread to the human population. Lacking a proof-reading mechanism, RNA viruses are generally characterized by a high mutability. The high mutation rate results in continuously evolving viral species, which allow the virus to escape host defences. Additionally, coronaviruses have a high frequency of RNA recombination that has the theoretical potential of accelerating the emergence of new viral species 29 . Owing to the limited number of sequenced isolates, however, it is too early to draw any reliable conclusions concerning the mutation rate of SARS-CoV. The most interesting amino-acid changes that have been reported so far are two recurrent nonconservative amino-acid substitutions (Gly to Asp and Ile to Thr) in the antigenic domain S1 of the spike protein 30 . Gly and Ile can be found in the Hong Kong front of nine predicted ORFs, and which fitted the description of a TRS (FIGS 2 and 3). By contrast, Marra et al. 17 and Rota et al. 18 proposed different TRSs (5\u2032CUAAAC3\u2032 and 5\u2032AAACGAAC3\u2032, respectively), but these sequences do not precede all predicted genes and no experimental evidence for their function has been provided. Although the overall organization of the SARS-CoV genome is similar to other coronaviruses (FIG. 3) , the amino-acid conservation of the encoded proteins is usually low (FIG. 2; TABLE 2 ).",

Indeed, an active form of this protease has already been expressed in E.coli, which can be immediately used for drug screening. The helicase, which is already available in recombinant form, represents another attractive target for highthroughput screens 20 . PLpro is another potential candidate for antiviral drugs, although no homologous index case group, whereas Asp and Thr are found in the mainland isolates. Another, non-conservative substitution (Gly to Arg) in the S1 domain is only found in strains GZ01 and BJ02. It is tempting to speculate that these mutations represent adaptations to the new host or its immune response.

All group 1 coronaviruses can use APN as a receptor 40 , whereas the group 2 mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) uses glycoproteins belonging to the carcinoembryonic antigen family as receptors on their target cells 41 . Whether the hAPN binding domain is the receptor in vivo remains to be shown. The protruding S1 domain is adjacent to the S2 domain, which consists of a stem, a transmembrane region and a short cytoplasmic tail. Analogous to other coronavirus S proteins, the SARS-CoV spike protein contains two heptad repeats that are located in the S2 domain. It is proposed that these repeats might trigger the fusion of the viral envelope with the cell membrane, as has been shown recently for MHV 42 . In some group 2 and group 3 viruses, the spike is cleaved during maturation into two subunits, S1 and S2, which stay non-covalently attached. The exact role of this cleavage process is unclear as it does not seem to influence infectivity; however, it may enhance fusion activity [43] [44] [45] [46] [47] . The mature SARS-CoV seems to contain uncleaved spike protein, but cleavage after binding to the target cell cannot be excluded. To conclude, the spike protein is a target for the development of agents that block the virus from binding to its cellular receptor and is the docking site for peptides that might inhibit fusion. Several additional targets for further study have been identified. First, the 76-amino-acid E protein -computer analysis has predicted a long transmembrane domain close to the N-terminus and two N-terminal glycosylation sites with a very low level of amino-acid similarity to other coronaviruses. Second, the M glycoprotein, which is a 221-residue polypeptide that consists of a short N-terminal ectodomain with a N-glycosylation site, three transmembrane segments and a C-terminus located on the interior side of the viral envelope, and which closely resembles M glycoproteins from other group 2 viruses. Third, the N protein, which is a 397-residuelong phosphoprotein that interacts with viral genomic RNA to form the helical nucleocapsid, and which has a low level of conservation with other coronaviruses.",
