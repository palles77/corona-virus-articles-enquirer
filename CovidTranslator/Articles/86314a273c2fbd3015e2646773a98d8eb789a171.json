Hospitals in the Middle East currently reporting the disease are staffed by immigrants. In the current hot spots for MERS CoV a sizeable portion of the population is from other countries, but many of these countries have yet to detect any importation of MERS CoV. To assess the disease transmission in these countries, supplemental surveillance strategies are urgently needed beyond the currently recommended measures. A few strategies to address the situation are: (i) improving preparedness with enhanced surveillance in particular regions; (ii) targeting certain sentinel groups for surveillance in hot spots; and (iii) limited use of serosurveillance. Recovered, immune patients can be employed to give patient care during outbreaks.",

World over, a total of 965 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection, including at least 357 related deaths have been reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) as of 3 February 2015. 2 In addition to outbreaks in the Arabian Peninsula, sporadic cases have been imported to Europe, Africa, Asia, and North America in returning travellers. No sustained transmission has been reported outside the Arabian Peninsula. Evidence point to a reservoir for the virus among both bats 3 and camels, 4 but the issue is not yet settled. 5 WHO coordinates International surveillance. Deaths, sick persons who recover, and asymptomatic carriers continue to be found. Cases arise from unknown sources in the community and from within hospitals in the Middle East region that have cared for laboratory-proven cases. Surveillance systems in parts of the world outside the Arabian Peninsula remain deliberately inactive.",

Particular characteristics enhance transmission, possibly through aerosol and contact: distance between beds of \u2a7d1m; staff continuing work while symptomatic; and host patient requiring oxygen therapy. Such hospital environments are quite common in developing countries. MERS CoV also shares many symptoms with other respiratory diseases, consequently misdiagnosis is likely. Thus the clinical staff of hospitals likely to receive returnees seeking treatment for their illnesses can act as 'sentinels' for MERS CoV surveillance. Serious respiratory illness in the clinical staff of hospitals, especially those with ICUs, might be targeted for virological testing. Serological testing of other staff may detect those who had asymptomatic illness. These tests would identify importation and help assess the gravity of the situation.",
