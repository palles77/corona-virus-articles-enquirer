It can also be isolated from the respiratory tracts of cattle entering feedlots. Monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) specific for the hemagglutinin esterase (HE) and spike (S) surface proteins of 2 bovine enteric coronavirus (BECV) strains and two bovine respiratory coronavirus (BRCV) strains were tested against 6 BECV strains and 6 recently isolated BRCV strains, in order to characterize the antigenicity of BCV strains with varied tissue tropisms. All MAbs had high immunofluorescence (IF) titers against BECV and BRCV strains, indicative of conserved cross-reactive epitopes. In hemagglutination inhibition (HI) tests, the S-MAbs were more broadly reactive than HE-MAbs. The BRCV and CD MAbs were more broadly reactive in HI than the WD MAbs.",

There are several studies of the antigenicity of BECV isolates using polyclonal or monoclonal antibody [5, 6, 12, 17] , but there are no studies of BRCV isolates using MAbs. Although some biologic and antigenic differences between BECV strains have been detected, it is unclear if these differences are distinctive between BECV (CD, WD) and BRCV strains, and if such differences can be used to differentiate and identify the sources of individual strains. In this investigation, 3 MAbs to BRCV strain R4, 2 MAbs to the CD strain DB2, and 3 MAbs to the WD strain DBA were tested by IF, HI and VN to determine the antigenic relatedness of 6 BECV and 6 BRCV strains. The BECV strains (Tables 1, 2) were plaque isolated or cloned by limiting dilution as described previously [1, 5] . The respiratory strains (Tables 1, 2) were isolated in HRT-18 cells from cattle in Ohio feedlots from 1995-1996 and were cloned by limiting dilution [5, 8] .",

[12] found that hyperimmune antiserum to three different BCV isolates (2 respiratory, 1 enteric) showed VN with the homologous and heterologous isolates and significant cross-reactions with eight other isolates, which were of intestinal and respiratory origin. Using polyclonal antiserum and 14 MAbs directed against the S protein of the Mebus CD strain, Michaud and Dea [10] found that 9 WD isolates from Quebec were all closely related, using polyclonal antibodies, but could be classified into 3 distinct antigenic subgroups based on their reactivity with the S-MAbs of the Mebus strain in VN and HI tests. This finding is in agreement with the results of the present and our previous study [5] : BECV isolates were closely related using polyclonal antiserum, but could be classified into 2 to 3 antigenic subgroup based on VN and HI test results. With MAbs, Milane et al. [11] indicated that variations (unrelated to clinical source) affecting the antigenic determinant of the HE protein occurred among the BECV strains isolated in Quebec and that these strains were grouped differently by their MAb HI titers from the prototype Mebus strain. Similarly, in the present study, the HA activity of the Mebus strain was not inhibited by any of the MAbs tested. The BRCV isolate R6 was unique among the respiratory isolates when tested against the BECV MAbs, a finding consistent between HI and VN tests and in testing with both MAbs and hyperimmune sera [5] . However, using the BRCV-MAbs, this strain was antigenically related to the other BRCV strains when tested by HI and VN.",

Disparate VN and HI results have been reported for MAbs to the S and HE proteins for the Quebec BCV isolates [3] , MAbs to the S protein for the Mebus strain [10] and MAbs to the HE protein for the WD strain (BCQ.2590) [11] . Moreover, MAbs were reactive with separate epitopes on the BCV HE or S protein. The HE protein contains three antigenic regions, A, B, and C. Domain A is further subdivided into two epitopes, A1 and A2, which react with neutralizing antibodies [2] . The S protein has three antigenic regions, two (A, B) or 3 (A, B, C) or which react with neutralizing antibodies [2, 10] . In the present study, the DB2 MAbs, CD-1 and CD-2 reacted with a hemagglutinating epitope, and a third DB2 MAb (data not shown) reacted with a non-hemagglutinating epitope, although both epitopes were separately involved in VN activity. This was also true for most of the MAbs, as they demonstrated VN activity with strains for which they had failed to inhibit hemagglutination. This finding is in agreement with E1-Ghorr, et al. [4] that their MAbs against the HE protein were both neutralizing, but only one had HI activity. In addition, the R4 MAb BRCV-3 inhibited HA activity, but it had no neutralizing activity. This is in agreement with Michaud and Dea [10] who reported that HE-MAbs to the Mebus strain had HI activity, but no neutralizing activity.",
