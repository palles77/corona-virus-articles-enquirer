Syndemic theory helps to elucidate the tendency for multiple co-terminus and interacting epidemics to develop under conditions of health and social disparity. Based on enhanced focus group and in-depth interview data, the paper argues that respondents employed a cultural logic of risk assessment which put them at high risk for STD infection. This cultural logic was shaped by their experiences of growing up in the inner city which included: coming of age in an impoverished family, living in a broken home, experiencing domestic violence, limited expectations of the future, limited exposure to positive role models, lack of expectation of the dependency of others, and fear of intimacy. r",

These findings are of note because of the ongoing intertwined epidemics in Hartford (and elsewhere) of two sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) in the study's target age and ethnic groups as well as a third disease, AIDS, for which sexual contact is a primary route of transmission. Findings from this Centers for Disease Control (CDC) funded study, entitled Project PHRESH.comm (Philadelphia and Hartford Research Effort on Sexual Health and Communication), suggest key cultural and contextual factors underlying the spread of these STDs in the city. The analysis presented is framed by syndemic theory (Freudenberg, Fahs, Galea, & Greenberg, 2006; Singer, 1996; Singer & Clair, 2003) , which seeks to elucidate the tendency for multiple, co-terminus and interacting epidemics to develop under conditions of health and social disparity. As Easton (2004, p. 211) notes, ''The concept of syndemics is useful for understanding how sociocultural, historical, and geographical, realities in urban areas interact with and compound the adverse consequences of disease.''",

This approach proved useful historically in focusing medical attention on the immediate causes and expressions of disease and contributed to the emergence of modern biomedical treatments, some of which have been enormously successful. However, as the compendium of knowledge has advanced, it has become increasingly clear that diseases do not necessarily exist in isolation from other diseases and conditions, that disease interactions are of considerable importance to disease course and consequence, and that the social conditions of disease sufferers are critical to understanding health impacts at the individual and population levels. Rather than existing as discrete conditions, multiple life-threatening diseases often are concentrated in particular populations.",

One such interaction has been found, for example, between type 2 diabetes mellitus and various infections, such as hepatitis C viral infection in women (O'Connor, West, Lorntz, Vinicor, & Jorgensen, 2004) . The worldwide prevalence of type 2 diabetes has been increasing and now impacts the lives of millions of women around the globe. Various factors are recognized as contributing to the onset of type 2 diabetes, including obesity and aging. The role of infection, however, is only beginning to be recognized. Already it is clear that risk for serious infections of various kinds increases significantly with poor diabetes control, but appreciation of more complex relationships between infection and type 2 diabetes is now emerging as well (Soule et al., 2005; Visnegarwala, Chen, Raghavan, & Tedaldi, 2005) . The NHANES III study found that type 2 diabetes increases among people who have been infected with the hepatitis C virus. (O'Connor et al., 2004) . Similarly, several health reports note that diabetes is present in as many as 37% of those who are critically ill with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) (Booth et al., 2003; Fowler et al., 2003) . These examples suggest the importance of dynamic diabetes-infection linkages. It is disease interactions of this sort that are a central element in syndemics. Syndemic theory seeks to draw attention to and provide a framework for the analysis of these interactions.",

The study weaves together a variety of qualitative and quantitative methods, including focus group discussions, systematic cultural assessment techniques (Bernard, 2001) , in-depth individual sexual and romantic life history interviews, sexual behavior diaries, scenario drama discussions, and structured interviews staged over 4 years of data collection (2004) (2005) (2006) (2007) (2008) .

The first group, sexual relationships, included the two subgroups casual sexual relationships just for sex (e.g., ''purely sexual'', ''these are just fucking and you leave'', ''sex friends'') or as exchange for resources (''person that helps you out, gives you things financially,'' ''friends who provide money and stuff''). Half (15) of the relationship types were purely sexual (e.g., ''booty call,'' ''thang thang'') and three implied an exchange of sex for access to resources (i.e., ''jump,'' ''ho,'' ''sugar daddy''). These purely sexual relationships can be short-term, never proceeding to a romantic stage by definition (e.g., ''ho,'' ''one night stand''). Alternately, they can be longer term but still purely sexual relationships (e.g., ''friends with benefits'', ''shorty'') in which the partners can be quite attached to each other as friends; these usually do not develop into romantic relationships. Purely sexual relationships may involve types of sexual behavior (e.g., oral sex, kinky sex) that are different from those in more romantic or committed relationships.",

The second grouping in the MDS analysis involved this stage (''girlfriends and boyfriends that are dating,'' ''getting to know person/talk about feelings''). Six of the relationships fell into this group and were considered romantic but not yet completely committed (e.g., dating, boyfriend/girlfriend). Getting to know a person in whom one is interested sexually and romantically is called ''talking.''

If someone were deemed on the basis of appearance or family background to be safe then there was no need to use a condom to avoid disease as no disease would be present.

Study participants have learned to be cautious about commitment in romantic relationships and tend to hedge their bets by having multiple partners and various kinds of relationships. Moreover, four contextual factors appear to be critical in limiting condom use: (1) condoms are not always available when passions run high; lack of a condom is often not a barrier to having sex; (2) the decision to use a condom flows from a culturally informed assessment of a partner's presumed level of risk rather than from a public health understanding of risky behaviors; (3) emotional involvement in relationships runs counter to continued condom use; the decision to curtail condom use is made quickly; and (4) relationships in which condoms are not used are multiple, overlapping and sequential. The result is a high level of risk for STD. This risk is not random or meaningless; it is conditioned by socioeconomic factors that press participants to focus on shortterm pleasure and emotional and material gains rather than on long-term planning and monogamous partnerships. It is, in short, a rational response to social disparity. The results of our investigation, however, lead us towards pessimistic conclusions regarding STD prevention and risk reduction behaviors with current methods.

Psychosocial factors of note include a set of interrelated experiences linked to health, such as internalized racism, stigmatization or other social discrimination, living in fear and uncertainty (because of a prevalence of crime and violence in the local social environment), having a low locus of control borne of repeated exposure to discrimination, and feelings of hopelessness about the future.",

These beliefs and actions are responses to the uncertainties, threats, and emotional injuries concentrated in the local social environment as a result of significant and increasing socioeconomic inequality. These conditions, and the beliefs and behaviors they give rise to in turn, help drive the spread of multiple and potentially interacting STDs, a phenomenon that is termed here the STDS. The STDS in Hartford is reflected in the comparatively high rates of HIV and other STD infections in the low-income, inner city ethnic minority neighborhoods from which study participants were recruited and the comparatively high rates of STD diagnoses reported by study participants. As this discussion suggests, the analysis of syndemic spread must take into account cultural and behavioral patterns in the social context. While syndemics reflect social conditions and unequal social relationships, their diffusion is mediated by the beliefs and behaviors of involved communities, and these, in turn, reflect human responses to the life experiences of injustice and social suffering.",

Certainly they should reduce trust in approaches that see individual irresponsibility, damaged family values, or lack of morality as the key causes of STDSs. Community attitudes and behaviors are complex and attentive to social conditions, including, especially, the ecosocial and psychosocial factors that shape day-to-day experiences. Social policies and interventions should be no less attentive to such factors if they are to make a difference in overcoming health inequalities. At the same time, knowing through research what people actually believe and do, and hearing their voices about such matters, presents a firmer foundation on which to construct prevention messages and effective prevention (Singer et al., 2005) .",
