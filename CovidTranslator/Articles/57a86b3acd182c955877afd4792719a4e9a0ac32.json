The present cross-sectional study aimed to investigate the mental health status and related factors of families of HCWs in Designated Hospitals in Ningbo, China. Method: Family members of HCWs working in five designated hospitals in Ningbo, China were recruited between February 10th and 20th, 2020. Information on demographic variables, the COVID-19-related events in the lives, knowledge of COVID-19 and the working status of family members (that is, HCWs) was collected using online self-administered questionnaires. The mental health status were assessed using the Chinese version of Patient Health Questionnare-9 (PHQ-9) and Chinese version of Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7). Multivariable logistic regression analyses were conducted to identify the main factors associated with the mental health conditions. Results: A total of 822 participants completed questionnaires correctly. (response rate of 95.80% ). The overall prevalence of GAD and depressive symptoms were 33.73%, and 29.35%, respectively. More times (hours) to focus on the COVID-19 (Odd ratio (OR)=1.215, 95% confidence interval (CI):1.061-1.391), family members (that is, HCWs) directly contact with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 patients (OR=1.477, 95%CI:1.069-2.040) were risk factors for GAD, while higher participants self-reported safety score for protective equipment of HCWs (OR=0.807, 95%CI:0.700-0.930) was a protective factor. More times (hours) to focus on the COVID-19 (OR=1.215, 95%CI:1.061-1.391), longer average working times per week for family members (that is, HCWs) (OR=1.017, 95%CI:1.005-1.029), being parents and other next of kin of HCWs were risk factors for depressive symptoms (OR=3.526, respectively). In addition, compared with participants who were HCWs, participants who were enterprise workers and were more likely to develop depressive symptoms(OR=1.750, 95%CI:1.104-2.776), while who were government employees or institutions All rights reserved.

Most enterprise workers have no medical background, and thus lack sufficient cognitive ability to raise awareness of COVID-19 outbreak. Their psychological endurance is lacking during a pandemic, and therefore may develop depressive symptom 48 . In addition, many enterprises were forced to shut down their work and production during the epidemic in China, resulting in the loss of income for their employees. However, income reduction was the predicting factor with the highest correlation of depression among enterprise workers, according to the results of a previous study during SARS in 2003 49 . Government employees or institutions employees were less likely to have depressive symptoms, which was less documented in the literature. It is likely that these populations were more likely to have access to a transparent announcement of epidemic information, so one possible explanation is that they do not have to suffer a feeling of uncertainty, which is a known risk factor for depression during a infectious epidemic 51 . Moreover, compared with HCWs who always suffer depression during the infectious epidemic, including COVID-19 outbreak 15, 19, 26, 51 , most of government employees or institutions employees stayed away from confirmed or suspected COVID-19 patients, and therefore have lower risk of depressive symptoms than HCWs.",

On the contrary, participants' higher self-reported safety score for protective equipment of HCWs was a protective factor against psychological problems. Compared with participants who were HCWs, those who were enterprise workers were more likely to develop mental health problems, while who were government employees or institutions employees were less likely to report psychological response. In summary, we suggest that more attention should be paid on the mental health status of this vulnerable but often unseen populations in a infectious disease outbreak. In addition, our findings are important in enabling government to allocate health resources and offer appropriate treatments for family members of HCWs who suffer mental health problems during COVID-19 epidemic and any of the infectious disease outbreak in the future. author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.",

Under this period of COVID-19 outbreak, most of the general populations, including family members of HCWs, stayed at home for isolation and faced with a great deal of information, as the government run national messaging campaigns that constantly emphasizing the dangers of COVID-19, especially on affected HCWs. Thus, family members of HCWs gained more time to gather information of HCWs who treated for COVID-19 patients, through the Internet and media 53 , for example on WeChat, which has spread the psychological influences, such as GAD and depressive symptoms, among the public more widely 20,54 . Moreover, the expression of this psychological reaction may be related to the normal protective response of the human body to the pressure of the epidemic, which also occurred in SARS outbreak in 2003 55 . In reviewing the results of this study, there is evidence that insufficient and inadequate attention was paid to family members of HCWs during COVID-19 epidemic in China. Several appropriate interventions to alleviate GAD and depressive symptoms among this vulnerable population are recommended as follows: First, health policy makers and stakeholders should collaborate to provide high-quality, timely crisis psychological services to families of HCWs. Online psychological self-help intervention systems, including online cognitive behavioural therapy for depression and anxiety (eg, on WeChat), would be appropriate for families of HCWs 25,54 . Second, providing suitable protective equipment, work schedule, and accommodation to HCWs would benefit family members who were concerned about HCWs being infected. Third, according to the findings of previous studies 21,27 , social support appeared as a protective effect on mental health problems between HCWs and their families. Thus, we strongly recommend both sides to take the initiative to communicate with each other to show their support. Last but not least, government's propaganda strategies should be well-organized and effective 56 .
