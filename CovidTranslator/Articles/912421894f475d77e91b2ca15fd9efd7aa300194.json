The number of cases rapidly rose. COVID-19 has spread globally within 60 days with focus areas in Asia, Europe and the Middle East [2] . Epidemiological data indicate that human-to-human transmission is occurring [3, 4] . As of 1 March 2020, 130 confirmed COVID-19 cases had been reported in France with three deaths [5] . In this context, rapid virological diagnosis is valuable to reduce the duration of isolation for suspected cases and to reduce fear among individuals who have potentially ben in contact with them. It also allows for optimal management of any COVID-19 cases that are diagnosed. We aim to share our initial experiences in managing patients suspected of having COVID-19 through a rapid ambulatory care circuit and virological diagnosis in our infectious disease reference hospital in Marseille, France.",

            "text": "Because COVID-19 infection symptoms range from unspecific mild respiratory symptoms to acute respiratory distress [3] and because these symptoms are very similar to those of many seasonal viruses [11] [12] [13] , we implemented an outpatient rapid diagnosis for mildly affected patients which operated ten hours a day, seven days a week. This involved testing a broad spectrum of clinical presentations in potentially exposed persons [14] . As in Italy, an infectious diseases clinician was key to patient triage [15] . The genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 enabled the rapid design and implementation of dedicated point-of-care real-time RT-PCR diagnostic tests [16] in addition to other respiratory pathogens testing. The Mediterranean Infection University Hospital Institute is one of the nine French metropolitan hospital centres habilitated by the French Ministry of Health (MoH) to manage highly contagious patients. These centres were designated by the MoH to test patients suspected of COVID-19 at the early start of the epidemic (corresponding to the present study). Among these nine hospitals, our institute is the only one organized to manage large populations of out-patients in a dedicated isolated area, under negative pressure with laboratory facilities on site. The number of French centres designated for testing was then extended to 33 hospitals [5] . Finally, on March 6 th 2020, the French MoH authorized private medical laboratories to perform nasopharyngeal sampling and testing for SARS-CoV-2. In France, such laboratories are managed by medical doctors or pharmacists. The clinical features of our 255 outpatients were compatible with the COVID-19 prodromal phase, as previously reported [3, 17] . Similar to an earlier study of suspected cases of MERS-CoV [18] , no cases of SARS-CoV-2 was detected, whereas other common viral pathogens were detected in 49% of the patients. Our results in patients returning from Italy corroborate those of an Italian study conducted among 126 patients between 21 January and 7 February 2020 with regards to the predominance of influenza viruses among positive samples followed by rhinovirus [11] . Timely identification of influenza virus infections allows for early treatment with antiviral therapy. Respiratory virus acquisition following travel is common. In previous studies conducted in pilgrims returning from the Grand Magal (Senegal) or from the Hajj (Kingdom of Saudi Arabia) acquisition of rhinovirus and common coronaviruses was frequently observed [19, 20] . In addition, we revealed evidence that metapneumovirus accounted also for a significant proportion of positive cases and found a higher proportion of common coronaviruses, notably HKU1 and NL63. This high proportion of common coronaviruses reflects the circulation of these viruses in the community, which are mainly responsible for mild upper respiratory tracts infections [21] . Interestingly, we found several seasonal coronaviruses co-infections with influenza A or B viruses and with rhino/enteroviruses. Although such results cannot be extrapolated to SARS-CoV-2, this is indeed a question in healthcare setting where SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis is not available, whether the diagnosis of influenza can rule out the diagnosis of COVID-19. No cross-reaction between common coronaviruses or other common viruses and SARS-CoV-2 has been yet described, to our knowledge and the role of viral co-infections in the disease severity is still unknown. SARS CoV and metapneumovirus co-infections were documented in 2003 but did not correlate with disease severity [22] .",
