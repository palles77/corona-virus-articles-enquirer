The goals the guidelines put forth here are two fold-22 first to reduce patient risk through healthcare exposure, understanding that asymptomatic health 23 systems/healthcare providers may become the most common vector for transmission, and second to 24 reduce the public health burden of COVID-19 transmission throughout the general population. Box 25 1 outlines general guidance to prevent spread of COVID-19 and protect our obstetric patients. 26 Section 1 outlines suggested modifications of outpatient obstetrical (prenatal) visits. Section 2 27 details suggested scheduling of obstetrical ultrasound. Section 3 reviews suggested modification of 28 nonstress tests (NST) and biophysical profiles (BPP). Section 4 reviews suggested visitor policy for 29 obstetric outpatient office. Section 5 discusses the role of trainees and medical education in the 30 setting of a pandemic. These are suggestions, which can be adapted to local needs and capabilities.",
