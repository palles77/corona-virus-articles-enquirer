Sixteen patients in a SARS cluster, including 4 health care workers (HCWs) and 12 non-HCWs were studied. We compared the initial viral load by nasopharyngeal swabs, clinical progression, and outcome of this cluster. The HCWs had a lower viral load. The non-HCWs had a higher mean C-reactive protein, lower oxygen saturation, and a higher incidence of intubation and death. Secondary household transmission developed in three of the non-HCWs' families. One month after discharge, non-HCWs had more signs of fibrosis on high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) scan and an impaired pulmonary function test. Although most of the PPE do not confer absolute protection against SARS, it seems that they may lower exposure to the virus, leading to a lower risk of secondary transmission, and be associated with relatively mild disease and a better early outcome.",

The transmission route of the emerging disease was believed to be by inhalation of contaminated aerosols or by oral route through contact with a contaminated environment (2, 3) . Both specific droplet and rigorous universal precautions were thus recommended for healthcare workers (HCWs) taking care of patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) (4) . Early in the SARS epidemic, investigators reported that surgical masks were equivalent to N-95 masks in protecting against SARS, but it was later shown that even N-95 masks were not completely protective (3, 5, 6) . This confusion, plus the fact that many HCWs became infected despite wearing masks, contributed to the tremendous fear and chaos in some areas affected by SARS (7, 8) .",

The cluster was carefully selected because the spread of transmission occurred in a very short time, making the cause-relationship unambiguous. We also used the human 18s-rRNA as an internal control to avoid sampling variation.

Between April 27 and June 16, 2003, a total of 167 patients diagnosed as probable (n \u03ed 71) and suspected (n \u03ed 96) SARS were treated in the hospital wards and Emergency Department (ED). Since May 12, a total of 41 negative pressure isolation rooms (including four in the ED) were established for these patients. Clearly, it is very difficult to track and clarify every transmission route in facing such variable sources of patients. Therefore, we carefully selected a cluster of victims whose source of infection can be tracked back to a common index patient. On May 4, 2003, a 50-year-old male was sent to the ED of Mackay Memorial Hospital in Taipei. He had had fever for the previous 6 days, and a severe cough with dyspnea for 1 day. He was a cook, and had no travel history or specific contact history for SARS. On arrival in the ED, he was given bronchodilatator therapy by nebulization for his respiratory distress. Two hours later, his chest X-ray study showed multi-focal air space consolidations, and the patient was then immediately isolated. Five hours later, he developed intrac-table hypoxia and respiratory failure, so he was intubated and mechanically ventilated. Twenty-four hours later, he died of SARS in the ED isolation unit.",

The mean incubation period between exposure to the index patient and onset of fever (\u03fe 38\u00b0C) was 5.5 \u03ee 0.6 days in HCWs and 6.2 \u03ee 1.8 days in non-HCWs. Patients sought medical treatment at a mean of FD 2.3 \u03ee 2.5 days in HCWs and FD 4.0 \u03ee 3.0 days in non-HCWs. The infected HCWs had all been wearing PPE, including an N-95 mask, gloves, gown, and head covering when working in the ED (Figure 3 ). Patients 12 and 13, who cared for the index patient in isolation and assisted with the intubation, wore an additional gown and eye protection when in the isolation unit. The procedures were double-checked (including N-95 mask with fittesting) by their colleagues according to WHO recommendations. The non-HCWs, apparently exposed to the index patient in the ED, had no specific protective equipment, except that some wore surgical, cloth, or paper masks.",

All of these patients had a normal body mass index (Table 3) . However, 4 of the 9 surviving non-HCWs (4/9, 44%) noted dyspnea on exertion at the 1-month follow-up visit. Some survivors had an uncomplicated skin rash or mild hair loss. Symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder and minor depression were also seen in 2 of the non-HCW survivors at the initial outpatient follow up. However, these symptoms gradually improved, and all survivors had normal psychosocial daily activity at the 6-month telephone follow-up. Twelve surviving patients completed the follow-up protocol. On the 1-month HCRT, parenchymal abnormalities were found in 8 of 8 non-HCWs and 3 of 4 HCWs. The abnormalities included areas of ground-glass opacification or reticulation of varying size, interlobular septal or intralobular interstitial thickening, traction bronchiectasis with distortion of the architecture, or crazy-paving with consolidations. The middle lung zone was predominantly involved (Figure 2 ). There were signs interpreted as consistent with pulmonary fibrosis (parenchymal bands, irregular interfaces, and traction bronchiectasis) and peribronchovascular interstitial thickening in 6 of 8 non-HCWs and 2 of 4 HCW patients. Patient 10 had had a pneumomediastinum during his hospitalization, but this had spontaneously resolved by the 1-month follow-up. There were no masses, nodules, emphysema, cavitation, or calcification seen. The mean HRCT score Results are presented as un-normalized row data and normalized data (copies of RNA/mL). in non-HCWs was higher than that of HCWs (1.46 \u03ee 1.02 vs. 0.67 \u03ee 0.72, respectively, p \u03ed 0.198) ( Table 3) . At the 6-month follow-up, most patients had significant resolution of their HRCT abnormalities. The previously seen signs of pulmonary fibrosis had substantially resolved, leaving only mild residual linear or reticular opacifications in 4 of 8 non-HCWs and 1 of 4 HCWs. The HRCT score decreased in both groups, but it was still higher in the non-HCWs (0.75 \u03ee 0.53 vs. 0.25 \u03ee 0.17, respectively, p \u03ed 0.058). At the 1-month follow-up, 1 of 4 HCWs and 4 of 8 non-HCWs had a restrictive ventilatory defect (vital capacity \u03fd 80% predicted). None of the HCWs had evidence of impaired diffusion (D LCO \u03fd 80% of predicted), but 5 of 8 non-HCWs did. The non-HCWs had a lower mean D LCO than HCWs (13.4 \u03ee 5.7 vs. 19.3 \u03ee 2.3 mL/min/mmHg, respectively, p \u03ed 0.031) ( Table  3 ). The functional vital capacity and total lung capacity were mildly decreased in both HCWs (84.5 \u03ee 10.3% and 82.3 \u03ee 14.6%, respectively, of predicted) and non-HCWs (75.6 \u03ee 18.8% and 76.3 \u03ee 15.7%, respectively, of predicted), whereas residual volume was markedly reduced (69.3 \u03ee 33.4% of predicted in HCWs and 76.0 \u03ee 19.7% in non-HCWs). D LCO corrected for lung volume (D LCO /V A ) was normal (105.3 \u03ee 12.7% of predicted in HCWs and 99.0 \u03ee 25.3% in non-HCWs). These findings suggest that parenchymal lung damage led to a restrictive lung defect and impaired diffusion capacity. At the 6-month follow-up, lung function was normal in all HCWs and most of the non-HCWs. Among the latter, however, one person had a restrictive defect and two had diffusion impairment.",

In several previous reports on SARS, HCWs were less likely to die than non-HCWs (9, 13, 21) . Possible reasons for this may be that they were often younger than non-HCWs, sought treatment earlier, and were less likely to have coexisting illnesses (especially diabetes mellitus and heart disease) (11, 13, 14, 17) . It has also been postulated that HCWs may have had lower exposure to the virus and thus a lower viral load, possibly due to the use of PPE (13, 14, 22) . The initial exposure to the virus and viral load seem to correlate with disease severity. We speculate that the PPE worn by our HCWs, in particular the N-95 masks, may have minimized their exposure to the virus, resulting in lower viral loads, a relatively mild disease course, and a better outcome. It is likely that a lower exposure to the virus may also reduce the risk of secondary household transmission. Patient 10, who went to Japan after unknowingly having been exposed to the index patient, traveled in the company of other doctors for several days after he developed a fever. However, no one in contact with him, either among his traveling companions or Japanese, became infected, despite the understandable fear in Japan when the patient was diagnosed with SARS on his return to Taiwan (23) . None of the other three HCWs transmitted the disease to coworkers or family members despite contact with others during the incubation period. It should be noted that all 3 were isolated immediately after they developed fever, which presumably also decreased the risk of spread, because the patients with SARS were apparently contagious only with the onset of fever. This contrasts with the non-HCWs, who had not worn N-95 masks, had a higher vial load by quantitative RT-PCR, and 3 of whom transmitted SARS to family members. Although immediate reporting of symptoms with early diagnosis and immediate isolation is key to controlling the spread of SARS, use of a high quality mask may minimize initial exposure and thus reduce secondary household transmission.",

HLA-B* 4601/B46 is seen in 13.2% to 15.4% of people of southern Chinese origin, 2.8% in those from northern China, and is seldom present in European populations (25) . In our cluster, 4 of 9 non-HCWs and 1 of 4 HCWs had this particular allele. There is, however, no single laboratory study that has been definitively shown to define accurately the prognosis in SARS. In some studies, an increased LDH and an elevated neutrophil count at the time of admission, as well as low CD4 and CD8 lymphocyte counts, were associated with a poor prognosis (2, 11, 13) . In our series, CRP, an acute-phase protein synthesized by the liver after stimulus by various cytokines produced in response infection or inflammation, was markedly higher in non-HCWs than in HCWs. It has been correlated clinically with an increased risk of organ dysfunction and poor prognosis in a heterogeneous population of critically ill patients (26) . In our series, the greatest hematologic and laboratory abnormalities and oxygen desaturation occurred during the second week after fever onset (FD 7 to FD 14). According to a report from Hong Kong, the second week was a critical period of SARS when patients either clinically improved or worsened and developed respiratory distress syndrome necessitating ventilatory support. In a subset of their series, these authors found that the second week marked the peak and subsequent fall in viral load, concurrent with the appearance of antibodies (17) .",

Other investigators have reported a relatively higher concentration of viral RNA in the sputum than in the serum, urine, and stool. Its presence in the latter suggests that viral replication occurs elsewhere in addition to the respiratory tract. However, the shedding of virus from the respiratory mucosa would seem to be the primary route of transmission (17, 27) . Such a conclusion is also supported by our observation that the amount of the virus was positively associated with the extent of mucosal shedding. Using human 18s-RNA as internal control in some samples, we found that sampling variation and mucosal shedding may significantly affect the virus numbers. Nevertheless, our findings support the contention that crude viral load on nasopharyngeal swab correlated with disease severity and outcome.",

Chest CT scan reportedly showed changes consistent with pulmonary fibrosis in 62% of 24 survivors of SARS at 5 weeks after discharge (28) . For the majority of patients for whom data are available, the CT abnormalities interpreted as fibrosis had included a patchy ground-glass appearance that was not extensive and that might not have a significant impact on lung function (28 -30) . In our case series, abnormalities on HRCT scan were more common in non-HCWs than HCWs, even 6 months after discharge. The findings were predominantly groundglass opacification rather than parenchymal bands and are therefore more suggestive of potentially reversible fibrosing alveolitis rather than pulmonary fibrosis. Pathophysiologically, the possibility of acute reversible lung damage suggests that SARS infection might cause some degree of chronic viral pneumonitis in addition to acute disease (personal communication).",

Some of the restrictive defect might be attributable to skeletal muscle weakness rather than parenchymal lung damage alone. Such muscle weakness might be due to several factors, including the use of high-dose steroids, prolonged bed rest leading to physical deconditioning, or residual systemic effect of the acute disease (2, 28) . Whatever the cause, the outcome in our small series indicates that the lung function abnormality caused by SARS may improve spontaneously. We found improvement in radiologic, functional, and psychological abnormalities over time. At almost half a year after SARS, the survivors had normal lung function (including normal cardiopulmonary exercise test, data not shown), normal psychosocial behavior, and only minimal residual radiologic abnormalities.",

These may have included ventilation in the ER, proximity of the subjects to the index case, duration of exposure, and perhaps other unknown elements involved in transmission. HCWs may have been more aware of and had better hygiene practices than the non-HCWs. However, the exact extent of the spread of infectious viral-laden droplets when the patient coughed is difficult to determine. RT-PCR for SARS-CoV was positive in samples taken from the floor, a desk, and a bed-rail in the ED (personal communication). Because both HCWs and non-HCWs moved around in the ED, we cannot be certain exactly when and where their exposures actually occurred. This is one reason we selected this one cluster of infection, because it is highly likely that all patients who were present in the ED when the index patient was there were infected at that time. Another limitation is that the numbers in this series are very small, making statistical analysis very uncertain. However, the HCWs did have a lower mean viral load, even though several had very close contact with the index patient, particularly during intubation, when one would expect an extremely high risk of exposure to a heavy viral load.",

A nosocomial outbreak occurred on May 4 -5, 2003, in the Emergency Department (ED) of Mackay Memorial Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan. Patient 1, who was not part of the ED cluster, had had dinner with the index patient on May 1, 2003, and developed a fever on May 10. His wife, patient 2, became febrile on May 20. Patient 3 was seen in the ED on May 4 with acute gastroenteritis and was accompanied by her mother, patient 4. Both subsequently developed fevers on May 10 and May 9, respectively, and were found to have SARS. Patient 5 was seen in the ED on May 4 for a renal stone, accompanied by his wife, patient 6. He developed a fever on May 9, his wife on May 12, and their daughter, patient 7, on May 15. Patient 8 was in the ED on May 4 accompanying an ill family member and developed fever on May 10. Patient 9 was in the ED with a leg wound on May 4 and developed a fever May 8. Patients 10, 11, 12, and 13 were ED staff (one doctor and three nurses) who took care of or were working near the index patient May 4 and early May 5. Patient 10 (an ED doctor) did not know he'd been exposed to SARS and developed a fever on May 9 while traveling in Japan. Patients 12 and 13 assisted during the intubation of the index patient early on May 5. Their fevers began May 9 and May 10. Patient 14 was seen in the ED on May 4 for pelvic inflammatory disease and developed a fever on May 12. Her husband, patient 15, became febrile May 23. Patient 16 was seen in the ED with upper gastrointestinal symptoms May 4 and became febrile May 9. Health care workers (HCWs) wore personal protective equipment, including N-95 masks, while working. Non-HCWs infected in the ED had been wearing only surgical or cloth masks. Three of the non-HCWs transmitted the infection to secondary household contacts. Four of the non-HCWs had respiratory failure, 3 of whom died.
