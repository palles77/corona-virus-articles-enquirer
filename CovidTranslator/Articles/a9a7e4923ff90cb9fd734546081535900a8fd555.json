Swine reach sexual maturity and a commercial slaughter weight of approximately 115-130 kg at 5-6 months of age. At birth, they weigh approximately 1.4 kg (average); consequently, there is an exponential growth phase during the adolescent period. Most swine used in research programs are 15-30 kg and are 8-12 weeks of age. Weight gain during this period may be 2-5 kg per week. When selecting a model, age and maturity factors must also be considered. Consequently, domestic swine are rarely used for long-term projects unless the study includes the effect of growth and maturity factors or the animals are involved in agricultural research. Generally, most projects involving a length of >3 weeks would best be performed in miniature swine (Swindle, 2007; Fisher, 1993; Swindle et al., 1994) .",

Swine should be purchased from vendor herds that are validated brucellosis-free and qualified pseudorabies-negative by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). Commercial sources typically implement a vaccination and parasitecontrol program beginning at weaning age and dependent on the intended experimental use of the animal, such efforts may or may not need additional attention at the research facility. Quality source suppliers will deworm piglets at 4-to 6-week intervals and administer preventive treatments for ectoparasites. Weanling animals are commonly vaccinated against erysipelas and leptospirosis, and breeding animals should be vaccinated in addition against porcine parvovirus, Bordetella bronchiseptica, Pasteurella multocida, and Escherichia coli. Newly received animals should be given a minimum of 72 h to adjust to the new environment during which time physical exams and screening tests for parasites can be performed (Smith and Swindle, 2006) . Ideally, diet changes should be gradual over several days, with increased fiber if stress-induced diarrhea develops. Adult swine that are housed long term should have, at a minimum, periodic physical exams that include weight and parasite checks. Vaccination programs for adult swine should be implemented based on risk assessment that considers how the animal will be used in research, what I. INTrODUcTION LABORATORY ANIMAL MEDICINE the housing conditions are, and how close the research herd is to incoming animals of uncertain health status. Ideally, pigs should be purchased from one source with established health status to take advantage of natural herd immunity.

Swine are also susceptible to atherosclerosis. There are several models, the Rapacz familial hypercholesterolemia model, and induced models where feeding of highcholesterol and fat-enhanced diets to standard breeds induces the disease (Bahls et al., 2011 (Bahls et al., , 2013 . Some breeds are much more susceptible to diet-induced atherosclerosis than others. A more rapid form of atherosclerosis may be induced by damaging the endothelium with a balloon catheter (balloon endarterectomy).

There is considerable variation of the genetic capacity for accretion of lean body mass among the various breeds of swine utilized in biomedical research. The 'farm swine' include breeds developed for meat production and at 6 months of age may have a lean body weight five-to sixfold greater than that of a micropig breed. The published research on swine nutrition is focused on farm swine and maximization of lean growth (Table 16 .2). The majority of mini-and microswine nutritional research is proprietary and is reflected in the commercially available formulations offered by feed companies. In general, the nutrient requirements of these breeds are similar; however, the small breeds often require fixed-quantity feeding to control obesity, especially for long-term research studies. This in turn necessitates a higher margin of safety for many nutrient concentrations to prevent deficiencies, since most commercially available diets are designed for free-choice feeding. Diets formulated for the mini-and microbreeds generally have lower energy and higher fiber concentrations. The daily energy and quantity of feed required by farm pigs is quite different from that which is required by mini-and microbreeds.",

During estrus, sows will stand immobile when pressure is applied to the rump (Braun, 1993) . Silent estrus is common in swine, but the presence of a boar can facilitate estrus detection (Kirkwood et al., 2012) . Optimal fertilization rates occur when insemination takes place 12 h prior to ovulation. However, the variability in the interval between onset of estrus and ovulation makes it difficult to determine when females ovulate. As a result, commercial producers usually breed sows twice during estrus to maximize conception rates. Litter size also tends to increase with multiple matings per estrus. In pen mating, the sow and boar are left together during estrus. Hand mating involves placing the sow and boar in the same pen at 12-to 24-h intervals during estrus until the female is no longer receptive (Kirkwood et al., 2012) . Swine may also be bred by artificial insemination; however, conception rates are typically 10-15% lower compared to natural service. Satisfactory results are obtained if sows are inseminated 10-30 h after the beginning of estrus (Einarsson, 1980) .",

They are handheld devices that detect interfaces between fluid and tissues, which is the reason why they lose sensitivity at either early or late gestation.

The gestation period of miniature pigs and commercial pigs is typically 114-115 days. Signs of impending parturition are usually evident during the last week of gestation. The vulva becomes swollen and more reddened during the last 3-4 days. Development and distension of individual mammary glands occur during the last 2-3 days of gestation, and drops of clear or straw-colored fluid can be expressed. This is followed by the initiation of milk secretion. Characteristically, abundant milk can be expressed at the onset of farrowing. The interval between the initiation of milk flow to parturition is typically 6-12 h and provides a somewhat reliable sign of farrowing. Increased respiratory rate is most reliable. Behavioral changes occur during the 24 h preceding farrowing and include restlessness and nesting. Frequent urination, defecation, and chewing or biting on surrounding objects may also be noted. However, just prior to birth, this activity diminishes and the sow becomes recumbent (Braun, 1993; Day, 1980) . Use of a farrowing crate is seldom necessary. The week prior to the anticipated farrowing date, sows should be placed in a quiet room in a stall with abundant bedding material for nest building. Wood chips are ideal for farrowing stalls since they allow the sow to engage in nesting behavior. They also help maintain the neonates' body temperature since newborn piglets lack the ability to effectively thermoregulate. Environmental temperature should be 85-95\u00b0F with a supplemental heat source in the stall that results in a temperature of approximately 90\u00b0F at pig level (Fisher, 1993) . Hanging heat lamps are commonly used and should be positioned to be effective without causing burns. The sow's comfort level is approximately 68-70\u00b0F, which is the reason for having a supplemental heat source just for the neonates. Newborns should not be exposed to drafts or moisture.",

Neonates must consume colostrum with in the first 12-24 h before their gut loses the ability to absorb immunoglobulins. Neonates will compete for, and establish, teat order on their day of birth. This hierarchy remains until weaning (Sawatsky, 1993) . If necessary, the technique of split suckling can be used to ensure that all animals can nurse. This involves removing half of the litter comprising the largest piglets three to four times a day to allow the smaller animals to nurse adequately (Kirkwood et al., 2012; .

Nursing piglets can obtain some additional iron if allowed access to the feces of the sow; however, deficiency is still a common clinical problem.

Group-housed swine are frequently observed vocalizing to each other. Pigs have an innate need to root, which can become destructive if they are not provided with an adequate outlet for expression. Housing strategies should accommodate swine behavioral needs as much as possible within the constraints of experimental design. Group housing or housing two animals per cage can be used to allow social interactions among animals. If individual housing is necessary, cages should be close together, and their design should include openings at the bottom to facilitate contact. Providing bedding material such as wood shavings is an excellent way to satisfy pigs' rooting behavior. Bedding material has the additional advantage of absorbing excreta but can be more labor-intensive for the husbandry staff than slatted or mesh flooring. Alternatively, a variety of toys, such as balls, chains, or hoses, can be supplied to help provide cage enrichment (Fisher, 1993; Sawatsky, 1993) . Rotation of toys can keep the enrichment experience novel. Providing environmental enrichment that promotes species-specific behavior can enhance the well-being of swine and reduce fighting. Minipigs and farm pigs prefer toys that are chewable and can be easily misshapen. A recent environmental enrichment study indicated that minipigs prefer soft, pliable toys over hard, nonpliable toys (Smith et al., 2009) .",

This characteristic can be used to advantage in the research setting when animals must be handled or restrained for research manipulations. Acclimating and training swine to tolerate research equipment that will be used on them should be a standard procedure and can include the use of various types of food rewards given for reinforcing wanted behaviors. Gentle handling and the use of a humane restraint sling are warranted whenever swine need to be transported from their home cages or when restraint is necessary during noninvasive procedures. Many pigs respond to gentle rubbing of the ventral abdomen by rolling over onto their sides, enabling caregivers to perform such minor procedures as wound cleansing or suture removal without restraining the animals. This type of handling is very effective for positively reinforcing contact between pigs and their caretakers and has a calming effect on most animals.",

The pig has a large population of what were initially considered 'null' cells, which lack expression of CD2, CD4, or CD8, but are known to express CD3, classifying them as T cells. The lymphoid population is largely comprised of \u03b3\u03b4 \u03a4 cells and is found in large numbers in various tissues, especially mucosal sites (such as the uterus). These are also highly prominent in the newborn. \u03b3\u03b4 T cells from swine are similar to the ones described from ruminants (Davis et al., 1998) . Expression of CD4 (T-helper) and CD8 (T-cytotoxic) is mutually exclusive in most species, but swine (similar to human and monkey) have a unique lymphocyte subset that expresses both CD4 and CD8 (Thome et al., 1994) . The CD8 marker that is expressed is part of \u03b1 (and not \u03b2) chain. CD4+ CD8 + (\u03b1\u03b1) upregulation is commonly present in activated T cells. This subset may represent a type of memory cell or a lineage that differentiates from CD4+ CD8\u2212 to CD8+. In combination with CD45 and CD62L markers, central versus peripheral and naive versus activated T cells can now be identified in swine. There has been an increase in the identification of cluster of differentiation (CD) markers to phenotype lymphocyte subsets. Many homologous CD markers have now been identified, and a limited number are available commercially from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, Virginia) and Pharmingen, Inc. (San Diego, California).",

Reports on swine cytokine regulation and function suggest that the biology is similar to that of humans and mice and that there is some limited homology; swine lymphocytes will respond to recombinant human interleukin (IL)-2 in vitro and also in vivo (Whary et al., 1995) . When injected into pigs, upregulation of regulatory T cells for the induction of tolerance has been attempted as a bridge to preclinical human transplantation. Rejection is observed when injected at high concentration. For cancer studies, the use of IL-2 has been controversial as depending on the dose, it may enhance antitumor responses, or if T regulatory cells are unevenly upregulated, then relapse may occur. The swine leukocyte antigens (SLAs), the equivalent of the human major histocompatibility complex (MHC), have been cloned and sequenced and are located in chromosome 7 in swine. Like all other MHC-I molecules, the SLAs are expressed by all nucleated cells and function to restrict CD8+ T-cell activation, particularly antiviral immune responses. The SLA class II (MHC-II) genes have been cloned and are restricted to professional antigen presenting cells such as B cells, macrophages, and dendritic cells. Contrary to mice and similar to humans, SLAs class II genes are also expressed in lymphocytes and vascular endothelium. Upregulation of MHC-II does occur during inflammatory processes. The number of SLA class III genes that have been cloned is lower than that found in other species. Member genes of the SLA class III complex function in the complement system, which in the pig is closely aligned with the human systems of classical and alternate pathways of complement activation. One difference between swine and humans is that elimination of antigen-antibody immune complexes occurs through the lung in the pig, in contrast to the target organs of the liver and spleen in humans .",

Despite these concerns, the transplantation community continues to grow, driven by the increasing demand for donor cells, tissues, and organs. There are ethical concerns, however, including public acceptance of these alternatives and regulatory issues. A plethora of organizations throughout the world have been established to address these issues. The World Health Organization has stressed the importance of developing checks and balances for future clinical trials. The Ethics Committee of the International Xenotransplantation Association was founded to promote xenotransplantation as a safe, ethical, and effective therapeutic modality (Anderson, 2006; Yang and Sykes, 2007; Schuurman et al., 2012) . As this field develops, guidelines and regulations expand; the European Parliament and Council, the Food and Drug Administration, and the Public Health Service have all published guidelines. Significant steps forward in the process have been accomplished with the completion of swine genome mapping and the creation of transgenic pigs. Further research to understand the intricacies of swine immunology are instrumental in developing tools for xenotransplantation research. The comparable anatomy and physiology of the pig and human, defined herd health status, and the recent finding that over 100 porcine protein sequences share the same amino acids as their human orthologs, have indicated that with targeted genetic modification, the pig may be an ideal model for xenotransplantation. The experimental use of swine organs or tissues for humans faces significant scientific challenges however. These include, but are not restricted to, overcoming hyperacute, acute and chronic rejection by the host. Nonetheless, despite all of these factors the pig, specifically the miniature pig, continues to be considered the prime candidate for xenotransplantation.",

            "text": "One important resource has been the cross-breeding of outbred miniature swine from the Andes and the Rockies to develop three lines of miniature swine which are homozygous for different SLA alleles. Once the alleles were identified, the swine were designated as SLA aa , SLA cc , and SLA dd . The 'B' allele was either lost through the breeding process or was never present in the founder animals. These three lines are fixed at the SLA loci and are heterozygous at minor histocompatibility loci. Thus, MHCs matched with minor mismatches or full mismatch transplants are now possible which can reliably emulate clinical paradigms. Pairing donor and recipient within a line is used to model for transplants between MHC identical human siblings, between swine lines as a model for MHC full mismatches, and between F 1 hybrids for haplo-identical transplants, also known as parent-to-offspring transplants. Several recombinant strains have been bred where different SLA MHC-I or MHC-II recombinants exist. These intra-SLA recombinant strains have permitted the study of SLA class I and II differences and demonstrated the relevance of different SLA specific mismatches on graft survival of various tissues. As an example, it is easier to develop tolerance to a full MHC-I mismatched kidney than a full MHC-II. MHC-II is thought to permit optimal function of regulatory T cells, which are dependent on MHC-II matching (Griesemer et al., 2008) . Matching of SLA skin grafts without immunosuppression typically has a survival of 7-12 days. The SLA dd line was further inbred (brother sister matings) and currently has >95% consanguinity (Mezrich et al., 2003) . Skin grafts between these swine survived more than 340 days before rejection occurred. These animals are several generations away from being fully inbred and the presence of developmental abnormalities has slowed the development of the line.",

Lack of long-term graft acceptance due to the potent immunological barriers encountered between disparate species has forced the field to generate multiple strategies to minimize rejection. Understanding of the different rejection processes of xenotransplantation is needed. The most immediate and serious causes of graft loss are now better understood and some can be prevented. The mechanisms responsible for hyperacute rejection (seconds to minutes) are no longer a problem. Thus, in some instances the swine grafts have lived in nonhuman primates (NHPs) for several months before being rejected (Yamada et al., 2005) , and in some cases, even without evidence of rejection at the time of death (by other causes). When discussing xenogeneic rejection, one must differentiate between humoral and cellular driven processes. Of the two, humoral rejection has been the cause of immediate graft loss known as hyperacute rejection (HAR). HAR is driven by natural antibodies that recognize the sugar moiety Gal\u03b11-3Gal\u03b21-4GlcNAc (\u03b11,3 Gal) which is present in porcine endothelium. This sugar is produced by the enzyme \u03b1-1,3-galactosyltransferase which is present in most mammals but not in humans and old world monkeys. The enzyme was lost through evolution, possibly through the selective advantage of preventing infections by many bacterial pathogens that express \u03b1-1,3-Gal. Antibody-mediated recognition of this epitope on the swine vascular epithelium after transplantation triggers the complement cascade (Saadi and Platt, 1999) . If HAR is avoided by either absorbing natural anti-Gal antibodies or using grafts deficient of the Gal antigen, a second potent antibody mediated response, inducing acute humoral xenograft rejection (AHXR) is observed. This is generally caused by non-Gal xenoreactive antibodies. The graft is eventually lost over several days/ weeks by complement activation. However, other noncomplement-mediated mechanisms are also capable of inducing graft loss. This was demonstrated by transplantation of decay accelerating factor DAF\u2212/\u2212(CD55\u2212/\u2212) donor mice into Gal-T KO mice (Shimizu et al., 2006) .",

Delayed rejection of xenografts through cell-mediated responses develops over 3-4 days, involving activation of endothelial cells of the graft as in the acute rejection response (Brouard et al., 1999) . Activation leads to loss of thrombomodulin and adenosine triphosphate diphosphohydrolase, which leads to prothrombosis, proinflammatory gene activation increasing the expression of adhesion molecules, prothrombotic factors, and cytokines. Adoptive cell transfer experiments in immunodeficient rodents have demonstrated that engrafted human CD4+ T cells mediate rejection of porcine xenografts as do NK cells and monocytes (Friedman et al., 1999) . T-cell-mediated rejection has not been as well characterized as humoral responses because of the difficulty avoiding HAR and AHXR. However, the development of Gal-knockout (KO) pigs has permitted the study in large animals of other non-humoral xenograft rejection mechanisms. Control of CD4+ T-helper cells is not only an important part of a T-cell-mediated response, but will provide control of AHXR (Sachs, 2005) . CD8+ T-cell-mediated cytolysis continues to be a potent method of xenograft rejection. Pharmacological and nonpharmacological approaches to minimize their lytic function are crucial.",

(Sachs, 2005) . Addition of human MHC expression on Gal-KO pigs will be able to better avoid NK-cell-mediated rejection. Another common NK-cell-mediated kill mechanism is via antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity (ADCC). Both natural and IgG-specific antibody responses can induce ADCC-mediated xenogeneic rejection (Gourlay et al., 1998) . Macrophages are also involved in xenograft rejection, and they phagocytose the target tissues if they do not receive a negative signal through the interaction of CD172 (SIRP\u03b1) on the macrophage and CD47 on the cell surface molecule.

This method was modified to minimize irradiation-induced inflammatory responses. Primate anti-pig xenoantibodies were immuno-adsorbed by extracorporeal perfusion of recipient blood through a pig liver immediately before the intravenous infusion of porcine marrow. In addition to cyclosporine and 15-deoxyspergualin, recombinant pig stem-cell factor and IL-3 were given. Other calcineurin inhibitors such as FK506 (Tacrolimus) are now being used instead. Anti-thymocyte globulin and/or anti-CD2 monoclonal antibodies to target T cells have also been used. This permits, in part, the decrease of irradiation dosage. Thymic specific irradiation to prevent host resident thymic T cells from rejecting new bone marrow donor-derived thymic emigrants has been performed. Recipient primates required 4 weeks to recover from pancytopenia from whole body irradiation, and antipig IgM and IgG antibodies were temporarily depleted by the liver perfusion for 12-14 days. About 2% of the myeloid progenitors in the bone marrow of the recipient were of pig origin, and chimeras were unresponsive (or hyporesponsive) by mixed lymphocyte reaction when challenged with pig-specific stimulators. The first report of long-term survival of discordant xenogeneic bone marrow is in a primate recipient (Sablinski et al., 1999) .

Transcription of the transgene was transient, and xenografts were rejected after 8-22 days. This experiment was important because it demonstrated that transfer and expression of xenogeneic class II transgenes can be achieved in baboons, and this therapy may prevent late T-celldependent responses to porcine xenografts, which include induced non-\u03b1-Gal IgG antibody responses. The use of porcine thymic grafts in immunodeficient mice has been found to support normal development of polyclonal, functional human T cells, and these T cells were specifically tolerant to SLA antigens of the porcine thymus donor, suggesting thymic transplantation may be an approach to achieve tolerance in pig-to-human xenotransplantation (Nikolic et al., 1999) . Indeed, this approach, by providing a thymokidney graft by Yamada et al., demonstrated that baboon thymic precursors were developing in the pig thymus posttransplant (Yamada et al., 2005) .",

Complete inactivation is difficult and extended exposure times to disinfectant agents are required (Kim et al., 2009b; Rose et al., 2012) . PCV is transmitted via feces, urine, and direct transmission as well as transplacentally, through the colostrum, and via seminal fluid (Gillespie et al., 2009; Rose et al., 2012) . After the virus gains access, tonsils and lymph nodes of the head are infected. Initially, type B lymphocytes are infected followed by T cells and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (Gillespie et al., 2009) . Animals are typically 4 weeks old before clinical signs appear, suggesting that maternal antibodies are protective (Gillespie et al., 2009) .

Many factors are involved, most of which have been investigated, yet no clear unifying mechanism has yet been discovered (Darwich and Mateu, 2012) . Many multisystemic diseases have been attributed to PCV2. Lesions are often only seen when animals are coinfected with other agents such as porcine parvovirus (PPV), porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), or Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae, which prime or activate the immune system. Studies in caesarian-derived, colostrum-deficient pigs inoculated with PCV2 alone can cause lesions, albeit only with immunostimulation via adjuvants. LABORATORY ANIMAL MEDICINE Current thought is that PCV2 infects macrophages, or endothelial cells directly. PCV2 has been shown to infect endothelial cells resulting in activated phenotype, degeneration of endothelial cells, perivascular and intramural edema, fibrinoid necrosis, and vascular thrombi (Opriessnig and Langohr, 2013) . In conventional pigs infected with PCV2a or 2b alone, clinical disease is not observed, nor is there any difference between animals infected with a single serovar. When archival tissue collected from pigs before the advent of PMWS was examined and tested, PCV2 was present, albeit avirulent (Krakowka et al., 2012) . Mutational events within a specific epitope led to the increased virulence of PCV2 (Krakowka et al., 2012) .",

Transmission is both vertical and horizontal by fecal-oral spread or nasal secretions. The incubation period ranges from 2 days to several weeks, and survivors become carriers that shed the bacteria in feces for several months. Some form of stress, including shipping, food deprivation, concurrent diseases, research protocols, and mixing pigs from different sources, usually precedes clinical disease. Stress also increases shedding by inapparent carriers. S. enterica ser. Choleraesuis is fairly host-specific for swine, but S. enterica ser. Typhimurium is not host-specific (Carlson et al., 2012) . S. enterica ser. Typhimurium is also transmitted via the oronasal route following which organisms have been found in the cecum, colon, and ileal Peyer's patches within 3 h (Fedorka-Cray et al., 1995) .",

Infective levels of LABORATORY ANIMAL MEDICINE viral particles can also be present in tissues of animals that have died from the disease. Consuming infected carcasses or feed that has been contaminated with the virus is another means of transmission. Evidence indicates that avian species are not a significant contributor to the spread of the virus, and the role of insects in the transmission process has not been adequately evaluated (Zimmerman et al., 1989) .

The virus predominantly impacts the respiratory and nervous systems. Neonatal pigs typically respond to exposure with acute signs related to the central nervous system (CNS). Affected pigs will tremble, hypersalivate, stumble, and exhibit nystagmus and opisthotonus, often with epileptiform-like seizures. Because of posterior paresis, the animals may be observed sitting like a dog. Other signs include circling and paddling, vomiting, and diarrhea. Once CNS signs start, death usually follows within 24-36 h, and mortality approaches 100% in neonates and young piglets; mortality may decrease to 50% by 4 weeks of age. As the pigs age, the clinical signs become less severe, fewer pigs develop CNS involvement, and mortality declines. Respiratory signs characterized by sneezing, nasal discharge, and cough become the hallmark of pigs that are infected at greater than 9 weeks of age. Morbidity rate is high, but mortality is low with uncomplicated CNS signs such as muscle tremors that occur only sporadically. The duration of clinical signs is usually 6-10 days, with rapid recovery unless the disease has progressed to pneumonia or a secondary bacterial pneumonia has been initiated. Coinfection with other viruses (PRRSV, PCV2, SIV) may result in severe proliferative and necrotizing pneumonia in weanling and postweanling pigs (Morandi et al., 2010) . When CNS signs are exhibited, the clinical diagnosis of PRV becomes much more facile. Sows and boars also develop primarily respiratory signs, although pregnant animals in the first trimester resorb the fetus, and in the second to third trimester, abort.",

Porcine cytomegalovirus (CMV), which is the cause of inclusion body rhinitis, does not cause nasal turbinate atrophy; however, it may damage the nasal mucosa, predisposing it to colonization with one of these bacterial agents. Environmental air pollutants, namely, high ammonia levels (50-100 ppm) and dust (Hamilton et al., 1999) , and genetic factors also play a role. P. multocida strains A and D produce Pasteurella multocida toxin (PMT), which causes progressive nasal turbinate atrophy. B. bronchiseptica produces a heat-labile dermonecrotic toxin (DNT) which alone will produce a moderate self-limiting form of the disease in which damaged tissues may regenerate in time (Roop et al., 1987) . H. parasuis reportedly causes a mild turbinate atrophy (Cowart, 1995) . Combined infections of toxigenic P. multocida and B. bronchiseptica produce the most severe form of AR. Typically, two or more infectious organisms are required to produce clinical disease with permanent nasal distortion and turbinate atrophy. Recently, the term 'nonprogressive atrophic rhinitis' (NPAR) has been applied to the form caused by B. bronchiseptica alone, and the term 'progressive atrophic rhinitis' (PAR) to P. multocida alone and combined infections LABORATORY ANIMAL MEDICINE with B. bronchiseptica Brockmeier et al., 2012) .",

The most characteristic clinical sign is the dorsal and/or lateral deviation of the snout as the pig grows. This is caused by abnormal bone growth due to unequal nasal turbinate atrophy. Brachygnathia superior is the most common form seen and is due to slower bone growth in the upper jaw which gives it an upturned appearance. Significant turbinate atrophy can be present without visible snout abnormalities. In the more severe cases, whole-body growth rate will be decreased, which may be due in part to the possibility that PMT affects the growth of the skeletal system Ackermann et al., 1996) .

Transmission is primarily by snout to snout and by aerosol. Recovered swine may become chronic carriers and are a source of transmission within and between herds. Some exposed animals may become subclinical carriers. The spread is likely related to the movement of animals since artificial insemination and embryo transfer are unlikely sources of introduction (Gottschalk, 2012a) . Pleuropneumonia is more prevalent in facilities that bring in swine from multiple sources on a regular basis. Typically, in herds where APP is endemic, the piglets are infected in the farrowing pen and a carrier sow is the source. All age groups are affected, and morbidity and mortality are linked to environmental quality, stress, and concurrent infection with other pathogens.",

Interactions between virulence factors and host immune system, especially macrophages, and neutrophils, along with released cytokines determine pathologic outcome (Cho et al., 2005) . Primary damage to the capillary endothelium in alveoli may be the result of endotoxin produced by APP in acute and peracute infections. This results in severe edema and fibrin deposition as well as in thrombosis of capillaries and ischemic necrosis of pulmonary parenchyma (Bertram, 1985) . Tissue damage is primarily caused by the host immune response and from lytic LABORATORY ANIMAL MEDICINE factors released from these cells when they are killed by Apx toxins released from APP, whereas death is primarily due to endotoxic shock from APP LPS (Gottschalk, 2012a) .",

Segregated early-weaning practices can potentially eliminate APP; however, this is difficult because this bacterium is an early colonizer (Macinnes and Desrosiers, 1999) .

Lung lesions are well-defined abscesses and necrotic areas in the lung. Histopathologic lesions are a necrotizing, fibrinous, and hemorrhagic pneumonia that is predominantly lymphocytic and histiocytic, as well as a vasculitis with thrombosis of vessels and lymphatics (Didier et al., 1984; Nielsen, 1973) .

Enzootic disease manifests via a dry cough, typically when animals are aroused. They also have decreased appetite and fever with endemic disease (Thacker and Minion, 2012) . Although younger pigs may be affected, generally clinical signs are not obvious until pigs are 3-6 months of age. Uncomplicated MPS is generally characterized by a reduced growth rate and a chronic cough precipitated by exercise. In some affected animals, the cough may not be readily evident. Morbidity is typically high and mortality low unless complicated by concurrent viral or bacterial infections, or stress of any form. It plays an important role in PRDC when concurrent infection with PRRSV or PCV2 occurs (Thacker et al., 1999; Thacker and Minion, 2012) . In these complicated infections, malaise, anorexia, fever, labored respirations, and possibly death may result (Thacker and Minion, 2012) . Bacteria that frequently complicate MPS leading to enzootic pneumonia are clinical differentials and include P. multocida, B. bronchiseptica, A. pleuropneumoniae, S. enterica ser.

The agent is distributed worldwide, and antibodies to the virus are found in about 45% of the sampled pig populations. Influenza A viruses belong to the family of RNA viruses, Orthomyxoviridae. The type A viruses are further classified based on the glycoprotein spikes that extend from LABORATORY ANIMAL MEDICINE the viral particle (hemagglutinin [H] and neuraminidase [N] ). The antigenic characteristics of these spikes provide the basis for dividing these viruses into subtypes. Antigenic comparison of the H1N1 swine viruses has shown, in contrast to human strains, that there has been little antigenic variation over the last 50 years (Sheerar et al., 1989) . This could be attributed to the fact that the virus is able to propagate in an ever-present population of nonimmune pigs. Strains H3N2 and H1N2 are also prevalent in swine and they may also be infected by H3N3, H4N6, H5N1, H5N2, and H9N2 (Van Reeth et al., 2012) .",

E. coli are responsible for many diseases entities, the most important of which in pigs are postweaning diarrhea (PWD) and edema disease (ED). The species E. coli includes members that are normal gut flora as well as enteric pathogens that are further classified by antigenic serotype: somatic (O), capsular (K), flagellar (H), and fimbrial adhesins (F). Pathogenic E. coli also possess one or more virulence factors encoded on either the bacterial genome or plasmids. Various classifications associated with different modes of pathogenesis include enterotoxigenic strains of E. coli (ETEC), which produce heatstable (ST) or heat-labile (LT) enterotoxins. Necrotoxic E. coli (NTEC) produce cytotoxic necrotic factors (CTF) which lead to diarrhea (De Rycke et al., 1999; Toth et al., 2000) . Enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC), also referred to as attaching and effacing strains (AEEC), attach to the enteric epithelium using fimbrial adhesins, and efface the microvilli and invade the epithelial cells. Strains of E. coli that cause hemorrhagic gastroenteritis are referred to as enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) (Tzipori et al., 1989) . ETEC is the most important of the E. coli in pigs. EPEC may also cause PWD. Shiga-toxin producing E. coli or ED associated E. coli (STEC/EDEC) are responsible for ED. This chapter will focus on causes of PWD and ED. Other conditions are beyond the scope of this publication but have been recently reviewed elsewhere (Kaper et al., 2004; Croxen and Finlay, 2010) .",

Litters born to gilts are more frequently affected versus litters born to sows. Severe outbreaks are associated with high morbidity and mortality in neonates; older pigs have less severe disease. Hemorrhagic gastroenteritis from colibacillosis can occur peracutely (sudden death) or acutely (rapid decline with severe diarrhea) in previously healthy, unweaned, or recently weaned pigs.

The majority of affected piglets recover but tend to develop slower. Clinical signs of C. perfringens type C include hemorrhagic diarrhea, weakness, and lethargy although the only sign may be peracute with death of piglets aged 12-36 h. Acute disease is characterized by 2 days of reddish-brown diarrhea containing gray, necrotic debris, with death by 3 days of age. Subacute disease develops as persistent nonhemorrhagic diarrhea that is yellow initially and then changes to clear liquid with flecks of necrotic debris. Chronic enteritis may involve intermittent or persistent diarrhea for several weeks, with mucoid yellow-gray feces (Songer, 2012) .",

Treatment Once clinical signs develop, disease is extensive and often unresponsive to therapy. Oral antimicrobials such as ampicillin given soon after birth and repeated daily for the first 3 days of life may prevent clinical disease. Another prophylactic therapy is a combination of ceftiofur and bacitracin methylene disalicylate which may be given to sows before and after farrowing (Songer, 2012) .

In pigs that will recover, consistency of feces slowly returns to normal after 3-5 days of diarrhea.

Disease is usually mild and self-limiting if other enteric pathogens are absent. If rotaviral infection is detected in clinically ill pigs of postweaning age, mixed infection with other agents such as TGEV should be suspected.

Lesions progress to an exudative dermatitis characterized by exfoliation and crusting, which begins in the groin, axillae, behind the ears, and on areas of damaged skin (Fig. 16.25 ). Within 24-48 h lesions on the head expand, coalesce, and extend posteriorly. Haired areas are typically affected but lesions can also be seen on the tongue and oral mucosa. EE is generally selflimiting, lasting 2-3 months in most animals, but can last 12-18 months. Erosions at the coronary band of hooves and vesicles or ulcers in the mouth and on the tongue and snout are common findings. The dermatitis may progress to cover the majority of the body in 3-5 days and becomes exfoliative and crusty but non-pruritic. Severely affected members of the litter may die in 24 h to 10 days, and others may or may not be affected or be chronically affected with small, localized patches of EE. Adult animals may be mildly affected with small areas of EE on their backs and sides (Frana, 2012; Cowart, 1995) .

The virus is believed to be limited to domestic swine. The disease does persist in infected swine in a transmissible, viable state, often without stimulating antibody production, thereby making serologic screening for the disease inaccurate. Pigs subclinically infected with PRRSV are thought to be the key factor in disease transmission within herds, and shedding level varies depending on virus variant (Cho and Dee, 2006; Rossow, 1998) . The virus has been found in serum, oropharyngeal fluids, semen, feces, and urine, and animals are susceptible via intranasal, intramuscular, oral, intrauterine and vaginal exposure (Rossow, 1998) . Animals are extremely susceptible to infection via skin breaks, including tail docking and tattooing (Zimmerman et al., 2012a) .

PRRSV replicates in CD163(+)/sialoadhesin (+) macrophages, which include pulmonary alveolar macrophages, pulmonary intravascular macrophages, and lymphoid tissue macrophages (Zimmerman et al., 2012a) . Migration of infected macrophages across the placenta may be one of the mechanisms for transplacental infection of fetuses. PRRSV induces increases in IL-10 which results in downregulation of cytokines involved in virus clearing (IFN-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3, TNF-\u03b1 and IL-12p40) (Gomez-Laguna et al., 2010) .

Vesicular stomatitis virus is in the genus Vesiculovirus and family Rhabdoviridae. Transmission is via aerosol or contact with experimental transmission via flies (Health, 2013a) . Infection is localized to the site of inoculation. If the area is unhaired (oral mucosa, snout, coronary bands), vesicles develop within 1-3 days, whereas if the area is haired, seroconversion with subclinical disease is seen (Swenson et al., 2012) . Clinical signs include excessive salivation, foot lesions with possible separation of the claw, and lameness. Virus detection is via tissue tags, vesicular fluid, or biopsy of affected area. Treatment is by supportive care and disinfection is crucial to prevent spread. VS is a zoonotic disease.",

The lack of proper calcium control within the membranous portions of the sarcoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria is thought to initiate the cascade of events that results in the syndrome (O'Brien et al., 1991; Fujii et al., 1991) . Stress-susceptible pigs are also known to overrespond to stressful stimuli, with excessive \u03b2-adrenergic receptor stimulation, lower rates of lactate, alanine, and aspartate conversion to carbon dioxide by the liver, abnormal phosphorus metabolism, and a much higher cortisol and thyroxine turnover rate.",

After the crisis is alleviated, the animal must be monitored closely for 48 h; redevelopment of the syndrome in response to minor stressors can occur.

Initially, the skin tumor appears as a flat black spot that becomes a raised nodule. The tumor initiates as a focus of melanocytic hyperplasia within the basal layer. Spontaneous regression, thought to be caused by the cytotoxic effects of infiltrated tumorspecific T lymphocytes, occurs in the vast majority of cases.",
