In this study, serial N-and C-terminal truncations of N protein were performed in the context of type 2 PRRSV infectious cDNA clone, and our results revealed that a stretch of inter-genotypic variable N terminal residues aa 5-13 ( 5 NGKQQKKK 13 K) and the last four inter-genotypic variable aa residues ( 120 SPS 123 A) at the C terminus of N protein were dispensable for type 2 PRRSV infectivity. All the recovered deletion mutant viruses had spontaneous mutations in the N coding region, including substitution, deletion and insertion. We re-engineered the additional internal deletion with or without the original C-terminal deletion back into wild-type APRRS and found that the internal domain spanning the inter-genotypic variable residues 39-42 ( 39 KGP 42 G) and conserved residues 48-52 ( 48 KNPE 52 K), respectively, were dispensable for type 2 PRRSV viability. These results demonstrated that N protein contains non-essential regions for virus viability in cell culture. Such dispensable regions could be utilized as insertion site for foreign tag expression and the rescued viruses could be the candidates for marker vaccine.",

            "text": "Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) is a single-strand, positive-sense RNA virus, and is a member of the family Arteriviridae, together with equine arteritis virus (EAV), lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus (LDV), and simian hemorrhagic fever virus (SHFV). Arteriviridae and Coronaviridae are classified as members of the order Nidovirales, mainly based on their similar replication and transcription strategy (den Boon et al., 1991; Gorbalenya et al., 2006; Snijder and Meulenberg, 1998) . Two genotypes of PRRSV have been classified, (European) type 1 and (North American) type 2, Lelystad virus (LV) (Wensvoort et al., 1992) and VR2332 (Benfield et al., 1992) are the representative strains of two types, respectively. PRRSV virion consists of at least seven structural proteins, including glycoprotein 2 (GP2) , GP3 (de Lima et al., 2009) , GP4 (van Nieuwstadt et al., 1996) , GP5, and unglycosylated envelope (E) protein (Wu et al., 2005) , membrane (M) protein, and nucleocapsid (N) protein (Bautista et al., 1996) . Structural proteins of arteriviruses are expressed via a nested set of subgenomic mRNAs (sgmRNAs) formed by a unique discontinuous transcription process (de Vries et al., 1990; Meng et al., 1996; Nelsen et al., 1999) . The common 5 leader sequence of sgmRNAs is derived from the 5 proximal untranslated region (UTR). The leader-body junction sequence can be amplified by sgmRNA-specific RT-PCR (Chen et al., 1993; den Boon et al., 1996; Meulenberg et al., 1993; Nelsen et al., 1999; Zheng et al., 2010) .",

Generally, type 1 and type 2 PRRSV N proteins consist of 128 and 123 amino acids (aa), respectively. However, Stadejek et al. (2008) reported that N protein of type 1 exhibits size polymorphism, the number of amino acid residues varies from 124 to 130. Although N protein is one of the inter-genotypically conserved proteins, LV and VR2332 share only 64% identity at the amino acid level (Dea et al., 2000) . N protein is assembled into an icosahedral nucleocapsid in the form of disulfide-linked homodimer , and the Cterminal half of PRRSV N protein is believed to be the dimerization domain (Spilman et al., 2009) . The N-terminal half of N protein is enriched in basic amino acids and intrinsically disordered, which are common properties of RNA-binding proteins (Daginakatte and Kapil, 2001; Doan and Dokland, 2003; Yoo et al., 2003) .",

(B) Sequence alignment of the first 100 nt sequence of ORF7 of LV, APRRS and N-terminal deletion mutants, the identical sequence with LV is denoted as dot while natural sequence deletion compared with LV designated as dash line. The engineered deletion is represented by asterisk. The 34 nt that was documented to be essential for RNA replication of LV (Verheije et al., 2002) is indicated in the open box, the 7 nt sequence which had kissing interaction with 3 UTR is indicated by shaded box. acid with proline, Wootton et al. (2001) demonstrated that the 111-117 aa substitution of type 2 PRRSV N protein reduces the conformational-dependent monoclonal antibody (McAb) binding significantly. Therefore, the C-terminus of N protein is important for maintaining the local and/or the overall configuration of the PRRSV N protein. Verheije et al. (2001) reported that C-terminal six amino acids of N protein are non-essential for virus infectivity of type 1 PRRSV. These authors also indicated that the N-terminal and internal regions of N protein cannot tolerate deletion.",

We performed serial deletions at the N-and C-termininal of N protein in the context of full-length cDNA clone pAPRRS.

Intracellular expression of nonstructural protein 2 (nsp2) and N protein was determined by immunofluorescence assay (IFA) at 2 and 3 days post-transfection (dpt), respectively, which indicated the genomic RNA replication and sgmRNA transcription properties of the mutants. As shown in Fig. 3A , all but pN 16/5-20 displayed nsp2 and N protein expression, but the fluorescence intensity was different. It was noteworthy that there were only several single cells stained for mutant pN 10/5-14, suggesting virus spreading between neighboring cells was affected. Moreover, no fluorescent signal was detected in the case of pN 16/5-20 (even after prolonged incubation at 7 dpt; data not shown), indicating that deletion of residues 5-20 ( 5 NGKQQKKKKGDGQPV 20 N) might have blocked both virus replication and transcription. In the parallel transfection experiments, visible cytopathic effect (CPE) appeared for the wild-type pAPRRS as well as for mutants pN 7/5-11, pN 8/5-12 and pN 9/5-13. The longer deletion mutants pN 10/5-14 and pN 16/5-20, however, produced no infectious particles even after three further passages. These results demonstrated that the Nterminal residues 5-13 of N protein were non-essential for virus infectivity in cultured cells.",

However, mutant virus C 3/N 48-52 had yet one additional point mutation, nt A15085G (aa I30V), which was genetically stable for at least five passages. Intriguingly, no additional mutation appeared within N in the independent transfection experiment 2 in all five passages. In the case of N 48-52, sequence analysis indicated that the recovered viruses consisted of a mixed population in both independent experiments; viral plaque purification was therefore performed for N 48-52 viruses in experiment 1. Eighteen plaques were selected and sequence analysis showed five different second-site mutations, including G40R&K44E (ppv5 in Fig. 7) , and four different substitutions together with 48/52K/K repaired, as summarized in Fig. 7 . We further determined the master sequence of the full-length genome sequence of ppv3, no detectable genetic alteration was found in the other region of the viral genome besides N gene. It is also worth noting that the five aa (PGPVM) insertion between residues 21 and 22 of the N protein in virus N 48-52 ppv20 resulted in an unusual length of N protein (125 aa). Sequence comparison showed that the inserted 15-nt (CCCGGGCCCTGTCAT) was identical to a region in ORF1 (nt 12141-12155, GQ330474), which coded for nsp12 (Ziebuhr et al., 2000) . Whether genomic recombination between these two regions or some other factors plays a role in this process is under investigation.",

We determined the nucleotide sequences of 5 UTR, 3 UTR and M region of all mutant viruses, however, no obvious genetic alterations were observed in these regions. Therefore, the N protein domains that may be responsible for protein-RNA and protein-protein interactions are most likely located outside of the mutated region. Intriguingly, we found that a stretch of 9 nt sequence (ACAGTGCTT, nt 1171-1179) insertion in N coding region of mutant virus C 4/120-123 was a direct repeat from nsp1 coding region.

We cannot completely rule out the possibility that quasispecies nature may account for some of the additional mutations, as we essentially determined the consensus sequences of the mutant viruses by direct sequencing of the RT-PCR products. Another reason for the lack of mutation is that the parental virus, APRRS, is highly adapted on MARC-145 cells, which could limit the number of the quasispecies. More importantly, these spontaneous mutations are often in the forms of deletions and insertions, which could not be simply attributed to the quasispecies nature.

However, almost all of the recovered viruses had different additional mutations in the independent transfection assay. For example, point mutation and out-of-frame insertion were found in the recovered virus C 4/120-123 in two experiments (Fig. 5B) . Also the same spontaneous mutation might respond to different primary deletions, such as S120P that arose simultaneously in the recovered viruses N 8/5-12 and N 9/5-13. On the other hand, most of the spontaneous mutations were located at the N-terminal domain of N protein, the structure of which is still unresolved. Therefore, it was difficult to illustrate any spatial relationship between the primary deletion and spontaneous mutations described in our study. In addition, we did not find a clear pattern of local charge compensation for the spontaneous mutations. Another explanation of the spontaneous mutations would be the role of the underlying RNA secondary structure. We also analyzed the local secondary structure of all mutants, but no significantly change was found. Except for pN 16/5-20, none of the other mutants and the recovered viruses affects the potential kissing loop structure of N protein.
