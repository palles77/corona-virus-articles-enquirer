Epidemiological studies have indicated human-to-human transmission in China and elsewhere. To aid the analysis and tracking of the COVID-19 epidemic we collected and curated individual-level data from national, provincial, and municipal health reports, as well as additional information from online reports. All data are geo-coded and, where available, include symptoms, key dates (date of onset, admission, and confirmation), and travel history. The generation of detailed, real-time, and robust data for emerging disease outbreaks is important and can help to generate robust evidence that will support and inform public health decision making.",

Increasingly, epidemiological studies are performed in real-time during an outbreak to understand key metrics such as the epidemic's reproduction number, serial interval distribution, incubation period and risk of international spread 2,3 .

We recorded all data sources in our database. Third, in some instances more detailed data are available, typically through peer-reviewed research articles 1, 7 , which were subsequently used to modify existing records in the database.

Other provinces provided updates throughout the day and then provided a final update listing all new cases, inclusive of earlier reports. In the latter case, entry of all the newly reported cases would result in duplication of cases from earlier updates. Additionally, as countries began to report asymptomatic PCR-positive individuals, their referencing or indexing of patients sometimes changed. For example, Japan's Ministry of Health identified novel coronavirus pneumonia cases ordinally up to the country's eighth case. www.nature.com/scientificdata www.nature.com/scientificdata/ The next three cases were identified during testing of a Japanese national flown from Wuhan on a charter flight for repatriation. One of those cases became the Ministry of Health's ninth case while the other two were asymptomatic and not considered the 10th and 11th cases in their press release. As this distinction was not made in other countries, the practice was documented to avoid confusion of cases in the line-list.",

Location names are often duplicated within a country, so contextual information was used to ensure the correct site was selected. When the site name was not found, information from the text was also used to scan sites in the approximate area to check for alternate spellings of the site name. We had curators skilled with the following languages: English, mandarin Chinese, Cantonese, Spanish, and Portuguese. To add new geographies to the database, Google Maps (https://www.maps.google.co.uk) and Google Earth (http://www.google.co.uk/intl/en_uk/earth) were used to determine latitude and longitudes, and relevant administrative metadata was extracted by querying the relevant country reference shapefile. For locations that are administrative units, information was populated by referring to the country reference shapefile, sourced primarily from GADM (https://gadm.org/) with the admin_id field to allow for easier polygon selection.",

When not reported, N/A is used. Age ranges are recorded as start_ age-end_age e.g. 50-59. sex -Sex of the case. When not reported, N/A is used. city -Initial generic geographic metadata is reported here. Subsequently standardized via lookup with geographic reference table. province -Initial entry of name of the first administrative division in which the case is reported. Subsequently standardized via lookup with geographic reference table. country -Name of country in which the case is reported. Note that imported cases will be assigned to the country in which confirmation occurred -this is typically in the arrival country, rather than the site of infection. \"Travel_ history_location\" will describe other locations of travel for such instances. wuhan(0)_not_wuhan(1) -Binary flag to distinguish cases from Wuhan, Hubei, China, from all other cases. 0 denotes a case is reported in Wuhan, 1 denotes a case reported elsewhere in the world. latitude -The latitude of the specific location (denoted as \"point\" in \"geo_resolution\") where the case was reported, or the latitude of a representative location (denoted as \"admin\" in \"geo_resolution\") within the administrative unit the case is reported. longitude -The longitude of the specific location (denoted as \"point\" in \"geo_resolution\") where the case was reported, or the longitude of a representative location (denoted as \"admin\" in \"geo_resolution\") within the administrative unit the case is reported. geo_resolution -An indicative field in which the spatial representativeness of \"latitude\" and \"longitude\" are described. \"point\" indicates that a specific location is being represented by these coordinates. \"admin\" denotes that the coordinates are representative of the administrative unit in which coordinates lie. Subsequent \"admin3\", \"admin2\", \"admin1\" and corresponding \"admin_id\" and \"shapefile\" will allow for a more specific representation to be had. reported_market_exposure -An open field indicating \"yes\" if there was reported market exposure and \"no\" if there was not. N/A indicates that no information is provided. additional_information -Any additional information that may be informative about the case, such as the occupation of the patient, the purpose of their travels, the hospital they were admitted to, etc. chronic_disease_binary -0 represents a case that was reported to have no chronic disease and 1 represents cases that reported a chronic disease chronic_disease -Reported chronic condition(s) of the reported case. source -URL identifying the source of this information sequence_available -If there was a genomic sequence available the accession number is inserted here. outcome -Patients outcome, as either \"died\" or \"discharged\" from hospital. date_death_or_discharge -Reported date of death or discharge in DD.MM.YYYY format. location -Location of the reported case. admin3 -Administrative unit level 3 (e.g., zip code) of where the case was reported. admin2 -Administrative unit level 2 (e.g., county) of where the case was reported. admin1 -Administrative unit level 1 (e.g., province) of where the case was reported. country_new -Administrative unit level 0 (e.g., country) of where the case was reported. admin_id -Administrative unit ID of the lowest level available for the case reported.",

(1) columns with no variability across all records were removed, (2) the remaining data were hashed using a 32-bit variant of MurmurHash3 implemented in the R package FeatureHashing version 0.9.1.3 8, 9 , (3) a principle component analysis on the centered, scaled hashed feature matrix is performed for dimension reduction, with principle components having standard deviations greater than 0.5 retained, (4) pairwise, Euclidean distances are then calculated and are normalized based on the smallest observed distance between records, and (5) records that have pairwise distances less than the 0.5th percentile are flagged as duplicates. Duplicate are defined as cases that refer to the same case. Code for these methods is hosted on our GitHub repository (https://github.com/beoutbreakprepared/nCoV2019/covid19). Records identified as possible duplicates were communicated to data curators via Github and flagged in the database. Curators then discussed amongst themselves via an online chat system (www.slack.com) to reach a consensus on how to address the possible duplications.",

This includes descriptive mapping of occurrences through time and estimation of key epidemiological parameters using mathematical models. The data are openly available and we will continue to curate the database as new information is made available. However, if the epidemic continues to grow then public health agencies are unlikely to continue to report individual-level case data, and instead will switch to reporting only total numbers (or estimates thereof) of confirmed or suspected cases as done for previous large outbreaks such as pandemic flu H1N1 10 . When detailed data becomes increasingly less available as the epidemic grows we may transition to an augmented database structure that only reports total new cases per location. Other groups have presented similar datasets which are complimentary to the one presented in this publication 11 .

The first is that, while native speakers were consulted wherever possible, there is the possibility of transliteration errors occurring when extracting data from native language into English-script analogues. This is most likely to happen when looking at point data. We have provided sources consulted so that users may cross-reference the original source wherever this is may be an issue. While administrative units are supplied with shapefiles sources and unique identifiers with these files so that users can understand the corresponding geographic scale which the row represents, with points, different settlements cover different spatial extents. Should users wish to incorporate this information into spatially-dependent models, they should exercise caution in possible misrepresentation of geographic specificity. We recommend that sensitivity of results could be evaluated by using buffers around point latitude and longitudes, or cross-referencing city-gazettes.",
