Studies employing the TCRV AG129 mouse infection model, based on challenge of type I and II interferon (IFN) receptor knockout mice [13] , revealed D746 activity as a pre-exposure prophylaxis, but not as a post-exposure intervention.

The greatest inhibition of TCRV replication was observed when the cells were pretreated, with diminishing dose-responsive activity seen out to the 3-6 h treatment time ( Figure 3 ). There was no significant inhibition seen when cells were treated 6 hours after infection. We have previously reported that 14 h or more are required for the detection of infectious TCRV particles in Vero culture supernatants [15] , suggesting that virus detected after 24 h in culture is from the initial infection cycle.

These doses were well tolerated by uninfected AG129 mice in an initial mean tolerated dose study (data not shown).

There were no significant differences in survival curve analysis or mean day of death comparrison between the groups treated with 10 mg/kg/ day D746 versus placebo. Unexpectedly, ribavirin, routinely included as a positive control, failed to protect TCRV-challenged mice at a daily total dose (50 mg/kg/day) previously reported to be effective [13] . In the aformentioned studies, ribavirin was given as a once daily (50 mg/kg) dose, whereas in the present study, it was divided into two 25 mg/kg doses every 12 hours. It is conceivable that the larger bolus dose reached more effective concentrations in critical areas, thereby resulting in a measurable protective effect. Further, the added stress due to twice daily injections may have also contributed to the ineffectiveness observed in this initial experiment with D746.",

This would allow for the evaluation of the compound prior to the appearance of substantial viral titers. Due to limiting amounts of compound, we evaluated D746 at a dose of 100 mg/kg/day. In contrast to the efficacy observed when given pre-exposure, D746 treatment did not prevent mortality when administered after infection ( Figure 6A ). Only ribavirin was effective post-exposure. Collectively, the ribavirin data from the 3 mouse experiments suggests that shifting the treatment schedule so that mice receive the drug through day 9 of infection (experiment 3), as opposed to day 6 (experiments 1 and 2), dramatically improves survival. It is possible that allowing the immune system to respond to the natural progression of the virus for the initial 3 days resulted in better neutralization of the virus, which combined with ribavirin treatment extending further into the course of infection, protected 90% of the mice from a lethal TCRV challenge.",

Consistent with the survival data ( Figure 6A ), the most dramatic reduction of virus titers was observed with ribavirin, with significant reductions in the serum and liver ( Figure 6B , C). One death occurred in the ribavirin group on day 8 of infection, prior to the time of sacrifice, resulting in fewer animals for the analysis of serum and tissue virus titers. Because this occurred prior to when we would expect death due to the virus infection, this animal is believed to have died from other complications.

The precise mechanism by which D746 inhibits replication in cell culture is not clear, but time-ofaddition studies indicate that an early to intermediate step in the virus life cycle is being disrupted. In particular, because treatment of cells prior to virus infection caused virus inhibition, this suggests that D746 may attach to cells and block subsequent virus adsorption.

This beneficial effect was lost when treatment began after challenge, as there was still evidence of ascites fluid accumulation, but the mice were not protected from lethal TCRV infection. In the second pretreatment efficacy experiment, we actually found significantly higher serum, liver, and lung titers in the D746-treated mice compared to the placebo group. We presume that when D746 was given prior to infection the changes resulting from the inflammatory response enhanced the production of virus, perhaps through the recruitment of more specific target cells that amplify the virus, while ameliorating host disease processes that likely contribute to the demise of the animals. When treatment was initiated after TCRV infection, the efficacy of the compound was lost and the increase in virus titers relative to the placebo treatment group was no longer observed. An alternative explanation of the higher titers in the D746-treated mice in the second pre-exposure treatment experiment could be that the placebo group may have had atypically lower viral titers than usual. Unfortunately, we did not have sufficient test compound available to validate whether D746 elevates viral titer under pretreatment conditions.

            "text": "Presently, there are limited options for the treatment of severe arenaviral infections [1, 17] . Despite active research towards identifying new treatments to counter arenaviral HF syndromes, only a limited number of therapies have been evaluated in animal models [18] . Although D746 was efficacious when it was administered prophylactically, it is questionable whether further development of the compound as an anti-arenavirus therapy is warranted since 1) its activity in vitro was only modest, 2) it was only active when administered prior to infection, 3) treatment was not associated with reductions on viral titers, and 4) excess fluid recruited into the peritoneal cavity was linked to i.p. administration of the compound. Nevertheless, the findings reported describe a novel antiviral scaffold and underscore the challenges associated with translating in vitro results into animals. Mice (n = 10 for drug treatment groups, n = 22 for placebo group) were treated i.p. twice daily for 7 days with the indicated amounts of D746, ribavirin, or CES vehicle placebo starting 2 h prior to challenge with 150 CCID 50 of TCRV and observed for 25 days. **P < 0.01 compared to CES placebo-treated animals.",

Cell lysates were from 7-day incubations. B) Cytoxicity in confluent monolayers of uninfected cells treated in parallel was determined by neutral red dye uptake to measure cell viability. Data are presented as the percent cell viability after a 7-day incubation compared to untreated controls and are representative of multiple experiments. Means and standard deviations are shown.
