Recombination junctions that were identified in clinical strains of this study, as well as in clinical strains of previous studies, were superimposed on RNA secondary structure models of 2C and 3D genomic regions. Furthermore, we created an in vitro model, based on double infection of cell-culture with two poliovirus strains, for the production and identification of recombinant Sabin strains in 2C and 3D regions. Our intention was to compare the results that refer to the correlation of recombination junctions and RNA secondary structures in 2C and 3D regions of clinical strains, with the respective results of the in vitro model. Most of the recombination junctions of the clinical strains were correlated with RNA secondary structure elements, which were identical between recombining Sabin strains, and also presented high predictive value. In consensus were, the respective results originated from the in vitro model. We propose that the distribution of specific types of recombination junctions in certain regions of Sabin strains is not fortuitous and is correlated with RNA secondary structure elements identical to both recombination partners. Furthermore, results of this study highlight an important role for the stem region of the RNA structure elements in promoting recombination.",

Co infection of the intestinal cells of a vaccinated person with Sabin 1, Sabin 2, and Sabin 3 strains, and the mixed replication complexes locating at few preferential sites in the perinuclear region of the target cells, are facts that promote intertypic recombination [8] . Intertypic recombination between Sabin strains usually takes place at the nonstructural part of the genome and a high proportion of types 2 and 3 strains isolated from healthy vaccinated individuals and from VAPP patients, have been found to be recombinants [9] [10] [11] [12] . According to previous studies, specific types of recombination junctions are located in certain genomic regions of clinical strains. Recombination junctions of Sabin 3/Sabin x type (x: Sabin 2 or Sabin 1) are mostly located in 2C genomic region, while recombination junctions of Sabin 2/Sabin x type (x: Sabin 1 or Sabin 3) are mostly located in 3D genomic region [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] . However, the underlying cause for the localization of specific recombination types in certain genomic regions remains unsolved. It has been proposed that RNA structural elements are responsible for the distribution of specific types of recombination junctions in each one of the 2C and 3D genomic regions [10] [11] [12] 14] .",

Furthermore, we created a cell-culture based in vitro model, targeted in the production and isolation of Sabin strains whose recombination junctions were located in either 2C or 3D genomic regions. We created the in vitro model for two reasons, first, in order to check if the distribution pattern of recombination types which is observed in 2C and 3D genomic regions of clinical strains is also observed in cell-culture strains, and second, in order to gather more evidence about the role of the RNA structural elements in promoting recombination.

Accession numbers EU598486, EU598488, and EU598487, respectively. b Schematic representation of the recombinant genomes of V1, V2, V3, V4, V5, and V6 isolates, generated from the cell-culture in vitro model used in this study junctions in 2C and 3D region, respectively, but are different between the recombining molecules. The most important feature considering the topology of recombination junctions of clinical strains in 2C and 3D regions is the fact that the majority of the recombination junctions were correlated with RNA structure elements which were identical between the recombining Sabin strains. Specifically, in 2C region 21 out of 29 recombination junctions were located in RNA structural elements identical between the recombining partners (Table 4) ; while in 3D region, 17 out of 28 recombination junctions belong in the same category (Table 5) . Moreover, the base pairs which lead to the formation of these RNA structural elements present high probabilities and are also included in the minimum free energy structure and as a consequence the positive predictive values of these base pairs are high [21] . Furthermore, the RNA structure element which is situated in the respective position of the third Sabin reference molecule, which molecule is not participating in the recombination, is entirely different from the identical RNA structural elements of the two Sabin reference molecules which are participating in the recombination (data not shown).",

Romanova et al. [23] proposed a theoretical model for the polymerase template switching. According to this model, the two positive stranded RNA molecules (recombining partners) which act as templates during negative strand synthesis, form a heteroduplex in regions where self complementary sequences that form potential RNA structures exist. The viral RNA polymerase while copying one of these RNA molecules normally overcomes the heteroduplex region. However, it may pause or stop in regions of heteroduplex which are either single Base pairs probabilities were obtained through RNAstructure, positive predictive values were obtained from Mathews [21] Virus Genes (2010) 41:181-191 189 stranded or partially base paired. The nascent 3 0 end of the complementary negative strand is detached in conjunction with RdRp from the first strand that is used as a template, and is attached to a homologous site of the second RNA molecule of the heteroduplex, which will now act as template for the continuation of the negative strand synthesis. According to Romanova et al. [23] , recombination junctions are located either in single-stranded regions or in the loops of the RNA secondary structure elements. In our study, the vast majority of the recombination junctions were located in the stem region of the RNA secondary structure elements (Tables 4, 5, 6; Figs. 2, 3; Online .

More specifically, two plus stranded RNA molecules form a heteroduplex, a hypothesis that is reinforced by recent studies which proved that the replication of poliovirus takes place in mixed replication complexes in which participate genomes that belong to different serotypes [8] . During the formation of the heteroduplex, base pairs are formed between the regions that belong to different recombining partners but have the potential to form high probability RNA structure elements which are similar between the recombining molecules. As a result, the heteroduplex in these regions is firmly established. It is probable that when the poliovirus RdRp in conjunction with the nascent negative strand reaches one of these firmly established regions of the heteroduplex, the 3 0 end of the nascent negative strand is detached from the first molecule which acts as template and is attached to the second molecule of the heteroduplex which will now act as a template. It is possible that the modest activity of 3AB poliovirus protein in destabilising the double stranded helix would be responsible for the detachment of the nascent negative strand from the first template-molecule, while the chaperone activity of poliovirus protein 3AB would be responsible for the attachment of the nascent negative strand to the second template-molecule [24] . Certainly, more experiments have to be done in order to fully clarify the proposed mechanism since there were regions bearing different RNA structural elements between the recombination partners, which also suffered recombination (Online Resources 6 and 7).",

Furthermore, all in vitro model isolates presented S1/S2 recombination junctions, which according to our knowledge is a rare event. This paradox could be explained if we consider that some isolates, which bare certain types of recombination junctions, may present higher fitness in cell-culture than in the body of the vaccinee. This hypothesis is reinforced by a previous study in which a PV1/PV2 capsid recombinant was isolated from cell-culture [8] . This recombination type in the capsid coding region has not been reported so far in clinical strains.

What could prevent recombination of the opposite type in the same region of these isolates (e.g., S2/S3 in C7, S2/S1 in V5)?",
