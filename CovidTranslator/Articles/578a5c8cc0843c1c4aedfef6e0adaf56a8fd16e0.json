This disease is currently spreading in what the World Health Organization (WHO) has now declared a global pandemic. 1, 2 At present, the data on COVID-19 in newborns are scarce. There is no clear evidence of vertical transmission, with few descriptions of cases of newborns of mothers infected in the third trimester of pregnancy, in whom viral detection tests have been negative. The risk of horizontal transmission through contact with an infected individual seems to be the same compared to the general population, and 3 such cases have been reported to date. 3, 4 Given the current lack of information, we are describing a case of neonatal infection by SARS-CoV-2 in Spain.",

She was closely monitored, and on day 9 post birth she exhibited intermittent hyperpnoea with mild intercostal retractions and 2 self-limited episodes of oxygen desaturation during deep sleep and feeding. A capillary sample was obtained for blood gas analysis, which revealed transient mild acidosis (pH, 7.27; pCO 2 , 49 mmHg; bicarbonate, 22 mEq/L; base excess -4; normal lactate), a chest radiograph detected ground glass opacities mainly in the right perihilar region and the serum level of C-reactive protein was normal (0.06 mg/dL). After 24 h, the symptoms resolved, and the patient has remained asymptomatic to date (day 13 post birth), when the COVID-19 RT-PCR has been repeated and continues to be positive.

According to the WHO, 2 a negative result does not rule out infection, so if infection by SARS-CoV-2 is highly suspected in a patient, especially in cases in which only samples of the upper airway have been tested, additional tests should be performed. This is important for the purpose of preventing community transmission through the children of mothers that have tested positive for coronavirus.",
