The molecules were designed from the structure of the known pseudo-mannobioside antagonist 1, by including additional hydrophobic groups, which were expected to engage lipophilic areas of DC-SIGN CRD. The results demonstrate that the synthesized compounds potently inhibit DC-SIGN-mediated adhesion to mannan coated plates. Additionally, in silico docking studies were performed to rationalize the results and to suggest further optimization.",

On binding the pathogen, they differentiate to mature DC that present antigen particles to T cells [1] . DC-SIGN (Dendritic Cell-Specific Intercellular adhesion molecule 3-Grabbing Nonintegrin), a specific C-type lectin recognizing pathogen-cell surface glycoproteins, is probably the first transmembrane receptor on immature DCs that encounters invading pathogens and binds a vast number of diverse pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). Normally, this binding event triggers internalization of the DC-SIGN-pathogen complex followed by pathogen lysosomal degradation and conjugation of the resulting fragments with MHC-II to initiate an adaptive immune response from T cells. Additionally, DC-SIGN serves as a signalling receptor that mediates pathogen-induced Toll-like receptor (TLR) signalling, which in turn modifies DC maturation and, therefore, the intensity of the adaptive immune response [2] [3] [4] [5] .",

            "text": "Some pathogens, however, have been reported to take advantage of this mechanism as they appear to deter DC maturation through DC-SIGN-mediated signalling and inhibit antigen presentation to T cells [6] . The van Kooyk group has shown that HIV-1 enters DC via DC-SIGN avoiding lytic degradation [7] [8] [9] . By doing so, HIV-1 not only escapes the host immune system, but also is presented directly to T cells which enables fully disseminated HIV-1 infection. Other pathogens are also believed to use the same principle for host invasion [10] . Thus, inhibition of pathogen interaction with DC-SIGN specific antagonists is considered as a plausible concept for new anti-infective agents. Several groups have recently demonstrated that inhibition of DC-SIGN, either by designed glycoconjugates or by antibodies, prevents pathogen attachment to DC and inhibits the infection of other immune cells at its earliest steps [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] DC-SIGN specifically binds mannose and fucose-glycosylated endogenous proteins (ICAM-2 and -3) as well as mannosylated PAMPs (HIV-1 gp120, M. tuberculosis ManLAM and others) [7, 9] . Moreover, mannose-and fucose-containing oligosaccharides (such as Lewis-x) bind to DC-SIGN with moderate to high affinity, while both Man and Fuc themselves have only weak affinity [24] . As a consequence, glycomimetic structures designed to inhibit DC-SIGN have been based on oligomannosides or on Lewis-x. In our previous study, we concentrated on the design and synthesis of monovalent glycoconjugates as glycomimetic DC-SIGN antagonists [12, 15, 21] . These molecules (Fig. 1, 1-3) have been conceived to be metabolically more stable than native oligosaccharides and/or equipped with reactive moieties to enable their multimeric presentation on multivalent supports. Ligands 1-3 had moderate to weak affinities for DC-SIGN, comparable or slightly superior to those of the starting oligosaccharide templates [12, 15, 21] . Thereby they displayed only limited therapeutic potential in their monomeric form. However, when presented in multimeric form, they were effective inhibitors of DC-SIGN-mediated viral infection. Indeed, the pseudo-trisaccharide 2, mimicking a linear Man-\u03b1-1,2-Man-\u03b1-1,6-trimannoside was found to inhibit DC-SIGN binding to mannosylated BSA with an IC 50 of 130 \u00b5M (by surface-plasmon resonance-SPR) and, when presented on a tetravalent dendron, was also found to inhibit the trans infection of CD4+T lymphocytes by HIV at low micromolar concentrations [21] .",

Additionally, docking studies were performed to rationalize the results and to suggest further optimization. Assay data demonstrate that our effort to design and synthesize mannose-based DC-SIGN antagonists has resulted in compounds which potently inhibit DC-SIGNmediated adhesion to mannan-coated plates and have the potential to prevent DC-SIGN-mediated pathogen recognition by DC.

Wells were then washed once with PBS and incubated with 1% BSA in PBS for 30 min at room temperature. Various volumes of 50 mM of stock solution of ligands were added to the wells to obtain the required final concentrations in the assay. PBS or DMSO was used in controls. Immature DCs were harvested, washed with PBS and labelled with 2.5 \u00b5M carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE) according to the manufacturer's protocol (Molecular Probes, Invitrogen, Eugene, USA) [34] , and re-suspended in the medium containing 500 U/mL of rhGM-CSF and either rhIL-4 (1000 U/mL) or 20 ng/mL LPS at concentration 5 \u00d7 10 5 /mL. 50 \u00b5L of this immature DC suspension was then added to wells and the cells were allowed to attach for 90 min. Wells were then washed twice with PBS, and 50 \u00b5L of lysis buffer (25 mM Tris, 0.1% SDS) was added. Each experiment was done in quadruplicate for each concentration of antagonist used and for control cells. To estimate the total immature DCs added to wells, one quadruplicate of wells was not washed with PBS, but only lysis buffer was added directly. CFSE is colourless and non-fluorescent until the acetate groups are cleaved by intracellular esterases to yield highly fluorescent carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester which reacts with intracellular amines, forming fluorescent conjugates. The fluorescence was measured at 520 \u00b1 10 nm with a Tecan Saphire microplate reader (Tecan Group, Maennedorf, Switzerland, excitation wavelength 490 nm) and is directly proportional to the number of adhered cells. Cell adherence was determined by Eq. 1, where A tx and A totalDC are the fluorescence of CFSE determined for cells washed after different times and for all dendritic cells. A blank is the background fluorescence of the buffer.",

To improve the binding affinity of mannose-based glycoconjugates, we have explored the known crystal structure of DC-SIGN carbohydrate-recognition domain (CRD) in complex with tetramannoside Man 4 (PDB code: 1SL4) [26] in search for binding sites on DC-SIGN CRD whose binding potential is not entirely exploited by the mimics designed so far [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] 21] . The primary interaction of the oligosaccharide occurs by coordination of the non-reducing end residue of the oligosaccharide to a Ca 2+ binding site exposed on the surface of the protein (shown as blue sphere, Fig. 3 ) [24] . Examination of this crystal structure allows identification of two structural features of DC-SIGN CRD as favourable sites to increase overall free energy of binding. A hydrophobic region defined by the phenyl ring of Phe 313 (Fig. 3) interacts weakly with the Man2 residue of Man 4 . It has been postulated that Phe 313 plays a double role in the binding mode of branched mannosides: it increases affinity (albeit weakly) by forming part of a surface complementary to the shape of Man\u03b11-6Man moiety of Man 4 , and it allows access to the \u03b1-linked outer arm branch trimannose structure while preventing binding of \u03b2-linked mannosides and N -linked glycans that have only the core branch trimannose structure [24] . Man3 residue does not interact with the receptor at all, but rather it points away from the protein and allows binding of high-mannose oligosaccharides. The hydrophobic cavity/area behind Phe313 (Fig. 3) is also a likely interaction region, which does not make any contact with the Man3 residue.",

The interaction of 1 and DC-SIGN was studied by NMR spectroscopy [12] , suggesting that the ligand should anchor to DC-SIGN CRD through complexation of the Ca 2+ binding site by its man- nose residue. Indeed, preliminary docking studies confirmed this hypothesis and suggested that the cyclohexane ring of 1 may extend towards the Phe 313 region in the protein binding site. Hence, additional lipophilic fragments could be added to the framework of 1 exploiting the carboxy groups appended to the cyclohexane ring (Fig. 4) . Identification of hydrophobic contacts in the proximity of the binding site of oligosaccharides and addition of lipophilic fragments to a sugar 'core' have often been applied to improve the affinity of glycomimetics [11, [45] [46] [47] [48] [49] .",

Two different condensation strategies were employed to synthesize amides or anilides from the preformed pseudodisaccharides 13 and 15, respectively. These in turn were obtained by appropriate modification of the sequence previously described for the synthesis of 1, starting from enantiomerically pure acid 5 [32] . For the synthesis of amides 26-36, pentafluorophenyl esters could be used as protecting groups of the carboxylic acids in the first four steps and then exploited as activated esters for the reaction of intermediate 13 with the appropriate amines. Thus, the di-PFPester 6 was treated with MCPBA to give epoxide 8, which was Under the same conditions, reaction of 13 with aniline afforded 39% of mono-anilide products, along with 30% of recovered starting material. Thus, a different strategy was implemented for the synthesis of anilides 44-50, starting from the trimethylsilylethyl ester 7 (Scheme 1). This was elaborated as described above to afford the corresponding pseudo-disaccharide 14. Ester deprotection with trifluoroacetic acid in CH 2 Cl 2 [51] afforded acid 15 which was transformed in anilides 37-43 by reaction with an excess of the appropriate aniline and 2 mol/equiv of O-(7-azabenzotriazole)-N,N,N ,N -tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate (HATU) [52, 53] following a carefully devised addition protocol (see experimental). The crude compounds after membrane filtration work-up (see experimental) were chromatographed and deprotected under Zemplen's conditions to afford anilides 44-50.",

            "text": "The activity of ligand candidates was tested using an assay we recently described [25] which measures the ability of molecules to inhibit dendritic cells adhesion to mannan-coated plates (see experimental for details). To assess whether this assay identifies inhibitors of DC-SIGN-mediated adhesion, adhesion was measured in the presence of different concentrations of DC-SIGN specific antibodies, 1B10 and H200, and their IC 50 values were determined (Table 2 ) [54, 55] . The results demonstrate that DC adhesion to the mannancoated plate can be abolished by DC-SIGN specific antibodies (Supplementary data) and an IC 50 of 6.1 + 1.0 \u00b5g/mL and 1.4 + 0.6 \u00b5g/mL was determined for the two antibodies, respectively. In the presence of 1B10, a monoclonal blocking antibody, maximum inhibition of DC adhesion was high (up to 80%), confirming that the assay detects DC-SIGN specific antagonists. H200 is a polyclonal blocking antibodies directed against DC-SIGN neck region (amino acids 61-200) rather than its CRD. Likely this antibody, which only allows maximum inhibition ca. 65%, reduces DC-SIGN-mediated adhesion by steric interference to the mannan-coated surface. It should be noted that neither antibody allowed to achieve 100% inhibition of adhesion [25] . This suggests that DC adhesion to mannan-coated plates does not rely solely on DC-SIGN, but also exploits other DC expressed mannose-binding receptors [56] . Nonetheless, the assay can serve as a preliminary screening for binding inhibitor candidates. Furthermore, compounds 1 and 2 were used as a positive control and 2 was found to inhibit DC adhesion with IC 50 = 299 \u00b1 30.0 \u00b5M (Table 2) , which corresponds well to the IC 50 obtained by SPR (IC 50 (2) = 125 \u00b5M) [21] . Preliminary single-point tests were used to identify candidates for IC 50 measurement. All synthesized compounds were tested in concentration 0.5 mM to assess their inhibition on immature dendritic cell adhesion (Fig. 5) . The compounds that exhibited at least 50% inhibition of cell adhesion (50% of residual adhesion) at 0.5 mM concentration were tested for dose-response and their IC 50 values were determined. Based on this cut-off value, compounds 32 and 34-36 were not chosen for IC 50 determination. In addition, compounds 48-50 precipitated in the preliminary test (apparent on visual inspection), so these compounds were excluded from further testing.",

The highest inhibitory potency was observed for compound 28, although maximal inhibition observed for this compound was only 54% (46% adhesion). Similar, albeit slightly less potent, inhibition was observed for compounds 29, 31, 33 and 44-46. The results strongly indicate that the majority of the substituents selected were reasonable and have increased potency as DC-SIGN antagonists when compared to starting compound 1, which inhibited DC adhesion only weakly (Fig. 5) . Some ligands were also found to be more potent than the pseudo-trisaccharide 2, up to 1 order of magnitude. Since amide 29 bears simple benzyl moieties and compounds 44-46 carry phenyl or 4-tolyl lipophilic groups (Table 1) , we conclude that simple aromatic rings with or without small substituents are optimal for strong interaction with DC-SIGN. This strongly suggests that additional binding affinity to DC-SIGN may be attributed primarily to hydrophobic interactions and confirms our preliminary hypothesis. The assay used in this article [25] measures the influence of the antagonists on binding of DC to mannan-coated plates. Since immature dendritic cells can express various mannose binding lectins [56] it is difficult to distinguish the contributions of the different lectins to the adhesion process. However, the ability of the DC-SIGN specific antibody 1B10 to reduce adhesion by 80% suggests that DC-SIGN is a major determinant of the binding ability to mannan-coated plates, and therefore, the assay can serve as a preliminary screening. The most interesting candidates iden- tified by this approach will be further examined for activity and specificity using assays based on isolated DC-SIGN [15, 19] .",

After a careful examination of the DC-SIGN binding site, we identified two regions only partially exploited by native ligands which could be used to increase the potency of glycomimetic DC-SIGN antagonists. Upon this hypothesis, we designed and synthesized a small focused library of mannose glycoconjugate derivatives of the previously published DC-SIGN antagonist 1. The compounds were tested using a DC adhesion assay to mannan-coated plates and the results demonstrate that the majority of the new derivatives inhibit DC adhesion more potently, by up to 2 orders of magnitude, than the starting compound 1. Additionally, docking studies allowed qualitative rationalization of the results and suggested that the synthesized DC-SIGN antagonists occupy one or both predicted binding sites.",
