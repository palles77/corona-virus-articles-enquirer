New human pathogens most often emerge from an animal reservoir, emphasizing the central role that non-human reservoirs play in human infectious diseases. Pathogens may also re-emerge with new characteristics, such as multidrug-resistance, or in different places, such as West Nile virus in the USA in 1999, to cause new epidemics. Most human pathogens have a history of evolution in which they first emerge and cause epidemics, become unstably adapted, re-emerge periodically, and eventually become endemic with the potential for future outbreaks.",

'If [.] we retain a basic optimism and assume no major catastrophes occur [.] the most likely forecast about the future of infectious disease is that it will be very dull'. 1 The pandemic of HIV crushed this optimism and infectious diseases were put back on the global health agenda of which the 1992 publication 'Emerging Infections: Microbial Threats to Health in the United States' 2 is a landmark. Since then, the ongoing antimicrobial resistance development among many different pathogens, the continuous emergence of (mostly) viruses with potential for human-to-human or pandemic spread, the intentional release of pathogens as terrorist weapons and the heated debates about experiments to make avian influenza viruses transmissible in ferrets are continuously reminding us that infectious diseases are far from dull.",

            "text": "Human: because most human pathogens rely on an animal or environmental reservoir, the interactions between human populations and their surrounding ecosystem determine the local pathogen spectrum, and the interpopulation interactions determine the spread of these pathogens. Historically, there have been several profound and distinct transitions in human environmental and interpopulation interactions that have radically changed the spectrum and causes of infectious disease in human populations (Table 1) Vertical grey arrows represent (from left to right): (1) rabies (dead-end transmission to human through bites of infected dogs or bats); (2) Ebola virus (transmission to humans through contact of hunters with infected gorillas or chimpanzees followed by several cycles of humanto-human transmission that suddenly stop); (3) yellow fever (mosquito-borne transmission from monkeys to humans that can be maintained from human to (mosquito) to human for many cycles (in contrast to Japanese encephalitis virus, which is transmitted by mosquitoes from an avian or porcine reservoir to humans but is -due to low viral load in blood -not transmitted from human to mosquito)); and (4) HIV (several transmission events of related viruses from apes and monkeys to humans followed by sustained local and pandemic human to human transmission). into all geographic areas of the world, the globalization of economic activities and culture, the speed and accessibility of distant contact, the spread and intensification of urbanization, and our increasing reliance on either intricate or massive technology, are reshaping the relations between humans and microbes. 5 The species jump: the species jump that initiates a first human infection by a new agent is often brought about by a novel or unusual physical contact between potential pathogen and human. Such contacts usually occur because of cultural, social, behavioural or technological change on the part of humans that affects the humaneanimal interface. The potential for subsequent spread of this 'new' infectious disease will depend on many different factors, including environmental or social factors. These changes and factors are the drivers of emergence and are listed in Table 2 . 2 Biologically, the species jump is often more a transition process involving several stages rather than a single event. These stages are displayed in Figure 1 . 6 The pathogen has to overcome various biological barriers (interspecies, intrahuman and interhuman) to move from one stage to the next, to be able finally to cause sustained human-to-human transmission. 7 Based on data from 1940 onwards, the hotspots for emergence of infectious diseases were mapped for zoonotic infections from wildlife and domestic animals, and for drug-resistant and vector-borne organisms. Figure 2 shows that these hotspots are primarily located in South and South East Asia, South and Central America and Subsaharan Africa. 8, 9 Various international consortia and large research programmes have been established in an attempt to predict and prevent, or prepare for and mitigate, these novel emergence events, summarized in a recent issue of The Lancet. 8 Technical advances enable us to detect and characterize these agents much more rapidly than ever before (e.g. availability of whole genome sequences of influenza virus A/H7N9 influenza or Escherichia coli O104:H4 within days). 10, 11 Non-zoonotic emergence",

There is a rapid and increasing spread of antimicrobial drug resistance among bacteria and other pathogens, and the development of novel antimicrobial agents has almost come to a stop because drug companies do not consider them profitable: a combination that may set us back to the preantibiotic era. Drug resistance is a threat not only to the successful treatment of HIV, malaria and tuberculosis, but also, increasingly, of hospital-and community-acquired infections from 'normal' Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Failure of vaccination programmes because of bad press or religious conviction in developed countries can cause re-emergence of highly infectious viruses, such as those that cause measles or rubella, within years, as has happened in the UK and the Netherlands. Global food production and distribution processes may give rise to widely disseminated foodborne infections that are hard to tackle, as with E. coli O104:H4 in and out of Germany, recently. Finally, in South East Asia, while H5N1 and H7N9 influenza viruses attract most international attention, hand, foot and mouth disease, caused by the exclusively human pathogen, enterovirus 71, is now associated annually with hundreds of thousands of hospitalizations of children under 5, with a mortality of around 0.1%, 12 showing that humans can also be a source of emerging infections (Table 3) .",
