We previously identified human ILC3 distinguished by interleukin-22 (IL-22) secretion. Here we characterized a human ILC1 subset that produced interferon-g (IFN-g) in response to IL-12 and IL-15 and had a unique integrin profile, intraepithelial location, hallmarks of TGF-b imprinting, and a memory-activated phenotype. Because tissue-resident memory CD8 + T cells share this profile, intraepithelial ILC1 may be their innate counterparts. In mice, intraepithelial ILC1 were distinguished by CD160 expression and required Nfil3and Tbx21-encoded transcription factors for development, but not IL-15 receptor-a, indicating that intraepithelial ILC1 are distinct from conventional NK cells. Intraepithelial ILC1 were amplified in Crohn's disease patients and contributed to pathology in the anti-CD40-induced colitis model in mice. Thus, intraepithelial ILC1 may initiate IFN-g responses against pathogens but contribute to pathology when dysregulated.",

            "text": "Recent studies have shown that both aggregated and diffuse lymphoid tissues of the oral and gastrointestinal mucosa harbor various innate lymphoid cell (ILC) subsets that contribute to early immune responses against pathogens by secreting different cytokines (Cherrier et al., 2012; Guo et al., 2012; Spits et al., 2013) . Remarkably, these ILC subsets resemble the discrete T helper cell effectors Th1, Th2, Th17, and Th22 cells in terms of the signature cytokines and transcription factors that determine their development. We recently identified a unique type of human ILC marked by the natural killer (NK) cell surface molecule NKp44, the signature cytokine interleukin-22 (IL-22), expression of the receptors for IL-1 (IL-1R), IL-7 (IL-7Ra), and IL-23 (IL-23Ra), and the chemokine receptor CCR6 (Cella et al., 2009 (Cella et al., , 2010 . We refer to these cells and their murine counterparts as type 3 ILC (ILC3) (Spits et al., 2013) . Acting on epithelial cells, IL-22 induces the release of antimicrobial peptides that protect the integrity of the mucosal barrier from pathogens (Ouyang et al., 2011; Sonnenberg et al., 2011) . IL-22 release is triggered by IL-23 and enhanced by IL-1, both of which are produced by antigen presenting cells (APC) in response to pathogens or other inflammatory stimuli. ILC3 development requires IL-7 signaling and the transcription factors Id2, RORgt (Cherrier et al., 2012; Spits et al., 2013) , AHR (Kiss et al., 2011; Lee et al., 2012; Qiu et al., 2012) , and Notch (Lee et al., 2012; Possot et al., 2011) . Human ILC3 maintain a certain degree of functional plasticity, because they can produce interferon-g (IFN-g) when cultured in vitro with IL-7+IL-2, IL-1b+IL-2, or IL-7+IL-1b+IL-23 (Cella et al., 2010) .",

Cells with NK cell activity were also reported in the murine intestinal epithelium and lamina propria (Carman et al., 1986; Tagliabue et al., 1982) . Although these reports suggest further phenotypic and functional heterogeneity of mucosal ILC, the functions and responsiveness to pathogenic stimuli of these ILC subsets are poorly understood. It is also unclear whether these cells are related to ILC3 or classical NK cells. In this study, we demonstrated that the human tonsil and intestinal mucosa contain a unique NKp44 + CD103 + cell subset that produced IFN-g in response to IL-12 and IL-15. These cells were different from classical NK cells in that they were selectively located within the epithelium, expressed the chemokine receptor CXCR6, and reflected features of TGF-b imprinting. Moreover, they had an integrin profile and a memory-activated phenotype similar to that previously observed in tissue resident memory CD8 T (Trm) cells, which are virusspecific cells that persist in the mucosae and skin after the resolution of viral infections (Casey et (legend continued on next page)",

Within the CD3 \u00c0 compartment, we identified two cell subsets, NKp44 + and NKp44 \u00c0 cells ( Figure 1A ). NKp44 + cells could be further divided into CD103 + and CD103 \u00c0 cells. The NKp44 \u00c0 population was mainly CD103 \u00c0 but included small numbers of CD103 lo cells, which varied considerably among individuals and therefore were not further examined.",

Both NKp44 + CD103 + and NKp44 \u00c0 CD103 \u00c0 cells produced more IFN-g and CCL4 than ILC3, but less GM-CSF ( Figure 1C ). We then asked which physiological stimuli induce IFN-g in NKp44 + CD103 + and NKp44 \u00c0 CD103 \u00c0 cells. Typically, ILCs produce signature cytokines when challenged with other cytokines, independent of signaling through immunoreceptors Soudja et al., 2012) . Accordingly, both NKp44 + CD103 + and NKp44 \u00c0 CD103 \u00c0 cells produced IFN-g when stimulated in vitro with IL-12 or IL-15 ( Figure 1D ). Moreover, IL-12 and IL-15 had a strong synergistic effect. IL-23, which stimulates ILC3, was ineffective (data not shown). IFN-g production by NKp44 \u00c0 CD103 \u00c0 cells was particularly efficient in a subset expressing CD27 (see Figure S1 available online), similar to what has been shown for blood NK cells (Silva et al., 2008) .",

However, although CD56 hi NK cells were responsive to IL-18, NKp44 + CD103 + and NKp44 \u00c0 CD103 \u00c0 cells produced equal amounts of IFN-g following stimulation with either IL-12+IL-18 or IL-12 alone, demonstrating that these cells do not respond to IL-18 ( Figure 1D ). Based on their ability to rapidly produce IFN-g in response to IL-12 and IL-15, we conclude that NKp44 + CD103 + cells and NKp44 \u00c0 CD103 \u00c0 cells belong to type 1 ILC (ILC1), which are the innate counterparts of Th1 CD4 T cells and include blood NK cells, particularly the CD56 hi subset.",

We found that NKp44 + CD103 + ILC1 selectively express high amounts of beta7 integrin, which associates with CD103 to form aEb7 heterodimers ( Figure 2B ). Conversely, NKp44 + CD103 + ILC1 expressed low amounts of CD11b (alpha M integrin) and CD11c (alpha X integrin). Additionally, NKp44 + CD103 + ILC1 expressed high levels of the collagen-binding integrin CD49a (also known as alpha 1 integrin or VLA-1) (Figure 2B) . Notably, expression of aEb7 and CD49a is characteristic of CD8 Trm, which are also preferentially located within the epithelium and poised for prompt effector functions (Cauley and Lefran\u00e7 ois, 2013) . In contrast to NKp44 + CD103 + ILC1, NKp44 \u00c0 CD103 \u00c0 ILC1 and ILC3 expressed the integrins CD11b and CD11c and lacked aEb7 and CD49a.",

Corroborating the influence of TGF-b in NKp44 + CD103 + ILC1 development, we found that tonsil NKp44 + CD103 + cells cultured in vitro with TGF-b together with either IL-2 or IL-15 maintained CD103 expression, whereas in the presence of IL-2 and IL-15 alone cells survived and proliferated but lost CD103 expression over time ( Figure 2F ). By regulating the expression of integrins and integrin signaling molecules, TGF-b may promote adhesion of ILC1 to epithelial cells (Giampieri et al., 2009) . Interestingly, blood NK cells only engender few NKp44 + CD103 + ILC1 cells when cultured with either IL-2 or IL-15 and TGF-b or supernatant from intestinal epithelial cell lines (data not shown), suggesting that, although related to conventional NK cells, NKp44 + CD103 + ILC1 cells may have a unique developmental pathway.",

NK cell receptors, such as NKp46, NKp30, CD244, CD94, NKG2A, NKG2C, and NKG2D, were similar in NKp44 + CD103 + ILC1 and NKp44 \u00c0 CD103 \u00c0 ILC1 ( Figure S2 ).

CD57, which was previously noted on rectal mucosa intraepithelial NK cells (Sips et al., 2012) , was not observed on any subset ( Figure S2 ). Considering the entire phenotypic analysis of ILC subsets, we conclude that intraepithelial ILC1 express hallmarks of TGF-b imprinting and activation.

Both NKp44 + CD103 + and NKp44 \u00c0 CD103 \u00c0 ILC1 expressed T-bet and Eomes ( Figure 3A and 3B), which have been implicated in the development and function of conventional NK cells (Gordon et al., 2012) , but not RORgt or AHR, which drive ILC3 cell differentiation (Spits et al., 2013) . Foxp3 was undetectable in all subsets. Interestingly, NKp44 + CD103 + ILC1 expressed higher levels of IKZF3 transcript than other ILC. IKZF3 encodes Aiolos, a member of the Ikaros family of transcription factors that regulates B and T cell development (Cortes et al., 1999 ) but heretofore has not been implicated in ILC development or function. Intraepithelial ILC1 Respond to Disparate Danger Signals Because NKp44 + CD103 + ILC1 are intraepithelial, they may produce IFN-g in response to signals produced by epithelial cells. To test this hypothesis, we challenged an epithelial cell line with different TLR agonists. We then added CD56 + cells isolated from human tonsils to the cultures and analyzed intracellular IFN-g content in NKp44 + CD103 + ILC1 by flow cytometry. NKp44 + CD103 + ILC1 produced more IFN-g when incubated with epithelial cells stimulated with the TLR2 agonist Pam3CSK4 than with epithelial cells stimulated with the TLR3 agonist polyI:C or unstimulated epithelial cells ( Figures 4A and 4B) . Similarly, elevated IFN-g levels were detected in the supernatants from FACS-sorted NKp44 + CD103 + ILC1 cocultured with Pam3CSK4-stimulated epithelial cells (Figures 4C and 4D) . (E and F) Tonsil CD56 + cells were cocultured for 9 hr with peripheral blood CD14 + monocytes (E) or monocyte-derived dendritic cells (F) pretreated with poly I:C or Pam3CSK4.

NKp44 + CD103 + ILC1 from the small intestine expressed most prototypic markers noted on their tonsilar counterparts, including NKp44, NKp46, CD39 ( Figure 5A) , CD101, CD49a, and CD160 (data not shown).

NKp44 is only encoded in humans, and CD103 was unexpectedly inadequate because CD103 + cells were hardly detectable within CD3 \u00c0 IEL (data not shown). In contrast, CD160 was an optimal marker of intraepithelial ILC1 because we detected a distinct population of CD160 + NKp46 + NK1.1 + cells within the IEL of Rag1 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice ( Figure 6A ). Spleen NK cells did not express CD160 in steady state, corroborating the specificity of this marker for intraepithelial ILC1 ( Figure S4 ). Stimulation of IEL of Rag1 \u00c0/\u00c0 and C57BL/6 mice with IL-12 and IL-15 induced rapid IFN-g production by CD3 \u00c0 CD160 + NKp46 + NK1.1 + cells, mirroring the human ILC1 response ( Figures 6B and 6C ). In contrast, IL-23 did not induce IFN-g production ( Figure 6C ). The identification of the phenotype of murine intraepithelial ILC1 gave us the opportunity to investigate the transcription factors required for their development. Intraepithelial ILC1 were conserved in Rorc \u00c0/\u00c0 and Ahr \u00c0/\u00c0 mice, which lack ILC3 ( Figure 6D ). In contrast, these cells were dramatically reduced in the IEL of mice with knock-out mutations of Nfil3 or Tbx21, which encode two transcription factors previously shown to be master regulators of NK cell development (Gordon et al., 2012; Male et al., 2012) (Figure 6D ). Normal numbers of ILC1 were present in the IEL of germ-free mice and slightly reduced numbers of ILC1 were found in neonatal mice ( Figure 6E ). Altogether, these results indicated that intraepithelial ILC1 can develop independently of the intestinal microbiota and are more related to the NK cell lineage than to ILC3.",

Following injection of anti-CD40, Rag1 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice rapidly lost weight and developed colitis as previously described (Uhlig et al., 2006) . Analysis of IEL isolated from the small intestine 36 hr after injection of anti-CD40 revealed a robust production of IFN-g by CD160 + NKp46 + NK1.1 + cells ( Figure 7A ), corroborating their early proinflammatory function in this model. IFN-g was also produced by a small percentage of NKp46 + NK1.1 \u00c0 cells, which correspond to ILC3 (Spits et al., 2013) . This observation was consistent with our previous demonstration that human ILC3 are functionally plastic. ILC3 can produce IFN-g when cultured in vitro with IL-7+IL-2, IL-1b+IL-2, or IL-7+IL-1b+IL-23, acquire responsiveness to IL-12, upregulate the expression of T-bet, and downregulate that of RORgt (Cella et al., 2010;  Figure S5 ). In vivo, the functional conversion of ILC3 into IFN-g-producing cells may occur when there is increased production of IL-15, IL-23, or IL-2 due to excessive activation of APC or T cells in IBD.",

            "text": "STAT4 activator IL-12. However, mucosal ILC1 differed from conventional NK cells because they required a STAT4 (IL-12) and a STAT5 (IL-15) activator, whereas the NF-kB activator IL-18 was not effective alone or in combination with IL-12 or IL-15. Given that IL-15 has been shown to be an important inflammatory mediator in gastrointestinal diseases such as celiac disease (Jabri and Sollid, 2009) , the responsiveness of intraepithelial ILC1 to IL-15 may be an important pathogenic factor in intestinal inflammation. Interestingly, intraepithelial ILC1 shared multiple phenotypic and functional features with CD8 Trm, which persist in the gastrointestinal tract, lung mucosae, and skin long after a primary infection has cleared and are very effective at preventing reinfection (Cauley and Lefran\u00e7 ois, 2013) . Given this, we envision that intraepithelial ILC1 are the innate counterparts of nonmigratory CD8 T rm . Epstein-Barr virus (Strowig et al., 2008) and human cytomegalovirus infection of tonsils as well as viral infections of the small intestine (Carman et al., 1986) may result in an accumulation or activation of intraepithelial ILC1, which are retained in the epithelium to prevent reinfection. It will be important to explore the relationship between intraepithelial ILC1 and the recently reported memory NK cells (Cooper et al., 2009; Romee et al., 2012; Sun and Lanier, 2011) . Like intraepithelial CD8 T cells, ILC1 also expressed CD160 and therefore may be the major innate trigger of HVEM-mediated epithelial antimicrobial response (Shui et al., 2012) .",

TGF-b imprinting was previously observed in decidual NK cells, which are in close contact with the fetal trophoblast and presumably contribute to maternalfetal tolerance (Koopman et al., 2003) . However, in contrast to decidual NK cells, intraepithelial ILC1 had an activated-memory phenotype and secreted IFN-g as well as lytic mediators, consistent with a proinflammatory function. By inducing a unique profile of adhesion and integrin signaling molecules, TGF-b may be important for maintaining the adhesiveness of ILC1 to epithelial cells rather than inducing a tolerogenic function. Figure S5 (A) Rag-1 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice were left untreated or injected with anti-CD40 to induce colitis. Thirty-six hr after injection, small intestinal IEL were isolated, and the frequency of IFN-g-positive cells within ILC1 (top panel) and ILC3 (bottom panel), gated as shown in Figure 6A , was determined by intracellular staining. (B and C) ILC1 contribute to the intestinal pathology during anti-CD40-induced colitis. Rag-1 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice were treated with anti-NK1.1 to deplete intraepithelial ILC1, and colitis was induced with anti-CD40. Intestinal tissue pathology in the proximal colon was analyzed on day 7 after anti-CD40 treatment. ''Control'' indicates mice injected with anti-CD40 without anti-NK1.1 treatment.

This observation enabled us to examine the developmental pathway of intraepithelial ILC1 in mice with targeted mutations of master transcription factors, demonstrating the requirement of Nfil3 and Tbx21, factors involved in the development of conventional NK cells. In contrast, Rorc and Ahr were dispensable. Although these results, together with the abundance of T-bet protein and EOMES transcript in human intraepithelial ILC1, suggested a relationship of intraepithelial ILC1 with conventional NK cells, we found that intraepithelial ILC1 were largely independent of IL-15Ra, indicating that intraepithelial ILC1 are developmentally distinct from conventional NK cells. It is possible that intraepithelial ILC1 are capable of exploiting other cytokines for their development, such as IL-7 or IL-2, or they do not require transpresentation of IL-15. Moreover, ILC1 expressed the transcription factor Aiolos, which may contribute to some of the unique developmental and phenotypic features of these cells.",
