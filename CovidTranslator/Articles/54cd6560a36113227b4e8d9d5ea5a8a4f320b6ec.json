The use of xenogeneic proteinefree Good Manufacturing Practiceecompliant growth media is a prerequisite for clinical MSC isolation and expansion. Human platelet lysate (HPL) has been efficiently implemented into MSC clinical manufacturing as a substitute for fetal bovine serum (FBS). Because the use of human-derived blood materials alleviates immunologic risks but not the transmission of blood-borne viruses, the aim of our study was to test an even safer alternative than HPL to FBS: HPL subjected to pathogen inactivation by psoralen (iHPL). Methods. Bone marrow samples were plated and expanded in a-minimum essential medium with 10% of three culture supplements: HPL, iHPL and FBS, at the same time. MSC morphology, growth and immunophenotype were analyzed at each passage. Karyotype, tumorigenicity and sterility were analyzed at the third passage. Statistical analyses were performed. Results. The MSCs cultivated in the three different culture conditions showed no significant differences in terms of fibroblast colony-forming unit number, immunophenotype or in their multipotent capacity. Conversely, the HPL/iHPL-MSCs were smaller, more numerous, had a higher proliferative potential and showed a higher Oct-3/4 and NANOG protein expression than did FBS-MSCs. Although HPL/ iHPL-MSCs exhibit characteristics that may be attributable to a higher primitive stemness than FBS-MSCs, no tumorigenic mutations or karyotype modifications were observed. Conclusions. We demonstrated that iHPL is safer than HPL and represents a good, Good Manufacturing Practiceecompliant alternative to FBS for MSC clinical production that is even more advantageous in terms of cellular growth and stemness.",

Among the latter, new cell-based medicinal products, containing viable human cells of autologous or allogeneic origin, have a high potential for cell-based therapies for various severe diseases. In particular, mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) can easily be isolated from bone marrow (BM), thanks to their capacity to adhere and proliferate and expand in culture (1, 2) . MSCs are multipotent stem cells with high immunomodulant proprieties, and they produce multiple cytokines, growth factors and adhesion molecules, all important factors that influence the hematopoietic microenvironment (3, 4) . These cells' particular characteristics and high plasticity make them relevant in the fields of cell therapy, tissue repair and in tissue engineering strategies as therapeutic products tailored to a number of clinical scenarios, from degenerative to post-traumatic diseases caused by damage or cell loss (5, 6) . The increasing use of MSCs as advanced therapy medicinal products (ATMP) has led to production processes that need to meet Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) (7, 8) .",

Although human MSCs are not highly immunogenic, when expanded in xenogeneic sera such as in fetal bovine serum (FBS), they are likely to generate immune responses in some patients after administration (10, 11) . It has been shown that a single preparation of 10 8 human MSCs grown under standard conditions in FBS carries with it approximately 7e30 mg of FBS proteins (10) . Thus, in view of clinical GMP production, the use of xenogenic serum is complicated because there is high lot-to-lot variability and it is associated with a risk of transmitting infectious agents and immunizing effects (12, 13) .",

Moreover, human platelet lysate (HPL) is being established as a safe and efficient MSC culture supplement for robust MSC cultivation, thus offering certain advantages as a potential FBS substitute (15e18). Although the use of human-derived blood materials alleviates the immunologic risks of FBS, the possibility of transmitting blood-borne viruses remains, especially when materials from multiple donors are pooled to provide a sufficient volume for therapeutic-scale MSC expansion and to limit individual donor variability. Pathogen inactivation (PI) technologies are aimed at enhancing blood safety through the inactivation of emerging pathogens, both known and as yetunidentified ones that and not detected by current screening or testing protocols. Since 1990, significant progress has been made in pathogen inactivation technology, which at present is widely available in European blood services, with multiple CE (an abbreviation of Conformit e Europ eenne, ie, \"European Conformity\") marked products to treat both platelets and plasma for transfusion. The CE marking states that a product has been assessed before being placed on the market and meets EU safety, health and environmental protection requirements.",

We observed positivity of these markers at both protein and molecular expression levels. In particular, we observed that the intensity of Oct-3/4 and Nanog nuclear protein expression was higher in HPL/iHPL-MSCs compared with FBS-MSCs, in terms of number and expression intensity. As shown in Figure 3 , in the cellular structures formed by HPL/ iHPL-MSCs, the fluorescence is more concentrated in the nucleus ( Figure 3A ; a,b, and Figure 3B ; g,h) than that observed in isolated cells, in which both nuclear and perinuclear distribution appeared ( Figure 3A ; c, and Figure 3B ; i). By counting the positive cells, we found that HPL-MSCs were 100% AE 0% and 100% AE 0%, iHPL-MSCs were 100% AE 0% and 97% AE 3.1% and FBS-MSCs were 89% AE 6.6% and 82% AE 13%, respectively, for Oct-3/4 and NANOG protein expression.

Although demonstration of the inactivation of contaminating pathogens was beyond the scope of our study, we did however a number of viruses, that are not required by the Regulatory Authority and not routinely tested by the Transfusional Center, batches of HPL and iHPL to show that PI can inactivate viruses. The negativity of almost all of the viruses tested showed that a good selection of donors by the Transfusion Center is a fundamental requirement to have safe initial blood components. We only had positivity for Parvovirus B19, which is a virus that can be transmitted from asymptomatic blood donors to the recipients of their blood components (41) . High rates of seroconversion, as well as a few cases of symptomatic illnesses and hypoplastic anemia, have been described in patients receiving clotting factor concentrates that were derived from large plasma pools. The virus is relatively heat-stable, and it resists treatment with solvents and detergents. B19 DNA was found by PCR in plasma-derived clotting factor concentrates from various manufacturers and treated with the use of different virus-inactivation methods by various investigators (42) . Clinically evident transfusion-transmitted B19 infection is, however, infrequent, even in susceptible hosts such as human immunodeficiency viruseinfected hemophilia patients receiving clotting factor concentrates. The fact that the only positive HPL batch was negative after inactivation shows that we also found the PI process to be efficient and safer.",

With the use of the CAD, the levels of residual amotosalem are greatly reduced and the psoralen concentration in platelets is approximately 0.5 mmol/L, which is the approximate concentration in the iHP. We reduced this concentration 10-fold through the use of HPL at a concentration of 10% in the cell culture. Although we did not test the presence of psoralen in MSCs expanded in HPL, we consider the psoralen traces in our MSC clinical product to be absolutely negligible and safe. This conclusion is in light of the fact that that during extracorporeal photochemotherapy, which is used in variants of cutaneous T-cell lymphomas, graft-versus-host disease, systemic sclerosis, in solid organ transplant rejection and Crohn disease (44), a leukocyte fraction from the peripheral blood is exposed to approximately 40e50 mmol/L of photo-activated 8-methoxypsoralen and reinfused into the patient without collateral effects. However, regarding transfusional purposes, INTERCEPT products are contraindicated in patients with a history of allergic response to psoralens; the certificate of analysis for MSCs isolated and expanded in GMP should state that traces of psoralens might be present so that they are not used in psoralen-allergic patients. We found that HPL and iHPL had similar characteristics. They were more advantageous, in terms of cellular growth, than was FBS and did not interfere with mesenchymal phenotypes because they did not modify the mesenchymal marker molecule expression, Furthermore, HPL and iHPL caused no chromosomal alterations or karyotype modifications in cells expanded up to the third passage. Interestingly, when whole BM was seeded in HPL and iHPL, no significant differences in the CFU-F number were observed compared with FBS-MSC, although they did appear to be denser and richer in terms of cells/colony. This observation was confirmed by the number of detached cells at each passage because HPL and iHPL-MSCs showed higher proliferative potential. Moreover, they were smaller and more morphologically homogeneous than were FBS-MSC. Differences in their CFU-F potential and colony morphology may be representative and possibly predictive of cell fate and function. A recent report (52) showed that CFU-Fs can be analyzed by combining two different pieces of information: diameter and density, which are properties related to and affected by cell proliferation, and mobility and differentiation potential. On these bases, small and dense colonies, which we observed in HPL and iHPL-MSCs, represent the BM-MSC fraction with more immature stem cells. These data suggest a higher clonal expansion of HPL/iHPL-MSCs that might be predictive of greater stemness than that of FBS-MSCs.",

As reported in the literature, the pseudopodia emission may suggest a trend of the cells to migrate and consequently to repopulate damaged tissues and organs with potential implications for regenerative medicine (46) .

Oct-3/4 is a key transcription factor for the pluripotent and self-renewing phenotypes of undifferentiated embryonic stem cells (48) . NANOG, a homeodomain protein present in pluripotent human cells, plays a critical role in the regulation of the cell fate of the pluripotent inner cell mass during embryonic development, maintaining the pluripotent epiblast and preventing differentiation to the primitive endoderm (49) . NANOG is thought to function in concert with other factors such as Oct-3/4. Interestingly, the spheroid structures that were observed in HPL and iHPL, not only during the seeding but also when the MSCs were detached and replaced in the passages after the 1st, were highly positive for Oct-3/4 and NANOG. Moreover, during expansion, HPL and iHPL induce a selection of more primitive MSCs compared with that in FBS.",

These data are in accordance (only for HPL) with that reported in the literature about GMPcompliant isolation and expansion of BM-MSC (50e52). Moreover, we previously reported that by plating whole BM at a low cellular density, it was possible to expand high numbers of MSCs for clinical use (23) . In the present study, we further showed that, independent of the culture condition, the number of CFU-F/10 6 cells was significantly greater when the whole BM cells were plated at a low density, compared with cells plated at a high density. These results emphasized the advantage of the low seeding density of whole BM to isolate MSCs for large-scale use. The use of HPL as an alternative to FBS to isolate and expand MSC confirmed that it is possible to obtain a number of MSCs for clinical doses and further reduce manufacturing time, limiting the passage or reducing the starting volume of BM. Finally, we demonstrated that PI treatment did not modify the characteristics of HPL, made it safer and more suitable for MSC isolation and expansion for clinical use and might be a requirement for GMP MSC expansion.",

The percentage of positive cells was calculated through the use of cells stained with immunoglobulin FITC/phycoerythrin/ APC as a negative control, and mean fluorescence intensity was analyzed on the positive cells.",

Reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was carried out with the use of the high-capacity complementary DNA reverse transcription kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNA and complementary DNA concentrations were measured with the use of a GeneQuant pro spectrometer (Amersham Biosciences, GE Healthcare, Pittsburgh, PA, USA).
