            "text": "1B, C). There were a number of peaks in the weekly total influenza specimens processed that coincided with the major MERS-CoV waves from March to July 2014: these took place in Iraq in early 2013, Egypt in early 2014 and from late 2014 to early 2015, and Qatar in 2013/14 and 2014/15 influenza seasons (Figure 1A). 3 Minor oscillating MERS-CoV waves were also noted in October 2014, March 2015, and May 2015. The influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 wave in early 2014 in Egypt closely led the major MERS-CoV wave in May 2014, while the influenza A(H3N2) wave in late 2014 in Egypt closely led the MERS-CoV wave in early 2015 (Figure 1B). The second MERS-CoV wave in late 2014 and the third MERS-CoV wave in early 2015 appeared to be split by the influenza A epidemic. The 2014/15 influenza A wave in Egypt appeared to fit in the time interval between the occurrences of the two MERS-CoV waves. The influenza A(H5N1) wave in Egypt co-occurred with a MERS-CoV wave in early 2015 (Figure 1C).These patterns showed that the major MERS-CoV waves in 2014 and 2015 closely followed the human influenza A epidemics in the Middle East region, and most of the influenza waves did not co-occur with the MERS-CoV waves. This implies that the factors of MERS-CoV infections may differ from the factors affecting the seasonality of human influenza virus infections. Further studies on the social or environmental factors that may increase the risk of human infection with MERS-CoV would be worthwhile.",
