Previous studies on peripheral T cells show that CEACAM1-L isoforms predominate with little to no detectable CEACAM1-S isoforms in mouse and human. We show here that this was not the case in tissue resident T cells of intestines and gut associated lymphoid tissues, which demonstrated predominant expression of CEACAM1-S isoforms relative to CEACAM1-L isoforms in human and mouse. This tissue resident predominance of CEACAM1-S expression was determined by the intestinal environment where it served a stimulatory function leading to the regulation of T cell subsets associated with the generation of secretory IgA immunity, the regulation of mucosal commensalism, and defense of the barrier against enteropathogens.",

            "text": "Carcinoembryonic antigen cell adhesion molecule 1 (CEACAM1), a member of the carcinoembryonic antigen family, is engaged in intercellular binding interactions that affect signal transduction by a number of cell surface receptors. CEACAM1 is constitutively expressed by a variety of cell types, including those of endothelial, epithelial, and hematopoietic origin such as B cells, polymorphonuclear leukocytes, monocytes, and dendritic cells. In addition, CEACAM1 is expressed at minimal quantities in circulating natural killer (NK) and T cells but is upregulated in these cell types following a variety of different forms of activation (Azuz-Lieberman et al., 2005; Boulton and Gray-Owen, 2002; Coutelier et al., 1994; Nakajima et al., 2002; Singer et al., 2002) . On the cell surface, CEACAM1 can associate with and modify the function of numerous signaling receptors that are dictated by the CEACAM1 isoforms expressed. The individual CEACAM1 isoforms are generated by alternative splicing and consist of transmembrane proteins that possess a characteristic membrane distal, immunoglobulin V (IgV)-like domain (the N domain), which functions in homophilic binding but differs with respect to the number of membrane proximal extracellular IgC2-like domains and the length of their cytoplasmic tail (Gray-Owen and Blumberg, 2006) . Specifically, the 11 human and 4 mouse CEACAM1 splice variants encode either a short (S) cytoplasmic tail about which little is known or a long (L) cytoplasmic tail containing immune receptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs (ITIM). In the latter case, consistent with the presence of ITIM motifs in their cytoplasmic tail, the CEACAM1-L isoforms of mice and humans are linked to inhibition of many different signaling receptors Kammerer et al., 1998; Pan and Shively, 2010) . In each example, the inhibitory function of CEACAM1-L isoforms is triggered by the phosphorylation of the ITIM tyrosine residues by receptor tyrosine kinases or Src-related kinases, resulting in recruitment of the Src homology 2 (SH2) domain-containing protein-tyrosine phosphatases (SHP)-1 or -2 (Huber et al., 1999; Nagaishi et al., 2006) .",

Although not directly demonstrated, this is presumed to be the case for T lymphocytes as well. It is known that although mouse and human T cells predominantly express CEACAM1-L isoforms, there is some evidence that CEACAM1-S isoforms can be expressed. However, this is a controversial issue because little or no detection has been described depending upon the study (Donda et al., 2000; Singer et al., 2002) . This is not an inconsequential issue, because in vitro transfection studies in T cells suggest that CEACAM1 is a ''tunable'' receptor system given that CEACAM1-S isoforms may possess costimulatory function that is capable of ameliorating the inhibitory signals provided by CEACAM1-L isoforms in the context of TCR-CD3 complex signaling when expressed together (Chen and Shively, 2004a; Chen et al., 2008) .

Furthermore, in vivo ligation of CEACAM1 with CEACAM1 homophilic ligands as provided by N-domain-Fc-fusion proteins or forced expression of CEACAM1-L isoforms in T cells is able to prevent or block mucosal inflammation associated with either hapten-mediated colitis or naive T cell transfer models of colitis (Iijima et al., 2004; Nagaishi et al., 2006) .

By establishing a PCR method for quantifying mouse CEACAM1-S and CEACAM1-L variants, we found that T cells within the intestines, relative to peripheral tissues such as the spleen, not only exhibited increased overall CEACAM1 expression but also uniquely possessed a relative overabundance of CEACAM1-S relative to CEACAM1-L isoforms. Moreover, in this environment, we showed that CEACAM1-S isoforms have special physiological functions, which at a cellular level enhanced T cell activation independently of CEACAM1-L isoforms and were preferentially expressed in cells performing common mucosal immune functions. Specifically, we found that CEACAM1-S acts as an individual signaling unit, which promotes the induction of CD4 + LAP + regulatory T (Treg) cells, CD4 + PD1 + CXCR5 + follicular helper T cells (Tfh cells), and the development of IgA committed B cells within Peyer's patches (PP). Consistent with this, T cellassociated CEACAM1-S isoforms led to enhanced mucosal IgA secretion, which influenced both the composition of commensal microbiota and host defense against exposure to pathogens such as Listeria monocytogenes. In the absence of CEACAM1 expression, these barrier-protective functions were diminished. Together, these studies provide tissue-specific evidence for CEACAM1 isoform regulation linked to important physiological functions within the intestines.",

Two pairs of real-time PCR primers were designed to specifically quantify these in mouse T cells. The specificity and efficiency of these primers was verified using mouse (m) CEACAM1-4L (4L) and CEACAM1-4S (4S) plasmids (see Figure S1A available online). Quantitative PCR (qPCR) analysis of mouse primary CD3 + T cells isolated from spleen and lymph nodes (LN) demonstrated that CEACAM1-L isoforms predominated in resting peripheral T cells with increased expression upon anti-CD3 stimulation as previously described (Boulton and Gray-Owen, 2002; Nakajima et al., 2002) ( Figure S1B ). In addition, although CEACAM1-S isoforms were detected, CEACAM1-L isoforms predominated in peripheral T cells such that the CEACAM1-L:CEACAM1-S (L:S) ratio was 1.95 \u00b1 0.34, consistent with previous studies (Singer et al., 2002) .",

It was noted that, unlike CD3 + T cells isolated from spleen or MLN wherein CEACAM1 expression was low and CEACAM1-L isoforms predominated over CEACAM1-S isoforms, CD3 + T cells from the intestinal LP of the duodenum, jejunum, ileum, colon, and PP were observed to express an overall increase in CEACAM1 transcript abundance with significantly greater quantities of CEACAM1-S isoforms relative to CEACAM1-L isoforms. Thus, an average L:S ratio of <1.0 (PP, 0.53 \u00b1 0.08; small intestine, 0.36 \u00b1 0.11; and colon, 0.19 \u00b1 0.04) was observed, which was reversed from peripheral T cells ( Figure 1B) . Accordingly, it was noted that the quantity and L:S ratio of CEACAM1 expression varied cephalocaudally along the axis of the gut. Specifically, the amounts of CEACAM1 and L:S ratio were more similar to spleen, MLN, and peripheral blood in the proximal intestines. Furthermore, CEACAM1 expression increased and the L:S ratio progressively decreased from the distal small intestine (ileum) to the colon. As a result, LP T cells of the PP and colon contained the highest amount of CEACAM1 and the lowest L:S ratios relative to all other compartments examined ( Figure 1B ). This was verified by immunoblotting with the CC1 mAb, further confirming that T cells isolated from PP and colonic LP expressed higher CEACAM1 amounts relative to peripheral blood and especially CEACAM1-S isoforms, which was most notable in the colonic LP ( Figure S1C ). These studies both confirmed the increased expression of CEACAM1 within intestinal T cells and further indicated that CEACAM1-S isoforms were not only expressed by primary T cells but established that they were, surprisingly, the major isoform within intestinal T cells.",

Moreover, using previously published RT-PCR primers, which amplify a 160 bp fragment from all CEACAM1-S cDNAs and a 210 bp fragment from all CEACAM1-L cDNAs from human CEACAM1 (Chen et al., 2008; Singer et al., 2002) , we confirmed that CEACAM1 was barely detectable in resting peripheral blood T cells ( Figure 1D ).

In addition, this dominance of CEACAM1-S expression by intestinal T cells was not simply due to T cell activation because activation of peripheral blood T cells did not induce significant quantities of CEACAM1-S (Figure S1B) nor were significant quantities of CEACAM1-S detectable in T cells from the spleen or peripheral blood (Figures 1B and 1D) . Given this, we hypothesized that CEACAM1 expression and especially that of CEACAM1-S isoforms in T cells was regulated by signals encountered within the intestinal microenvironment. We therefore addressed this question by adoptively transferring spleen-derived, naive CD4 + CD62L + T cells from wild-type (WT) mice that expressed little detectable CEACAM1 expression by flow cytometry (data not shown) but with low amounts of predominantly CEACAM1-L transcripts as shown by qPCR into Rag2 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice and analyzed CEACAM1 isoform expression in the adoptively transferred T cells after 2 weeks, prior to the development of intestinal inflammation ( Figure 1E ). These studies showed that, whereas T cells isolated from the MLN and spleens of the Rag2 \u00c0/\u00c0 recipients expressed lowto-moderate amounts of CEACAM1 expression with an L:S ratio of approximately 1.0, the T cells that homed to the LP of the colon expressed substantially increased CEACAM1 with an L:S ratio of approximately 0.1-0.2, consistent with a significant dominance of CEACAM1-S isoforms. Thus, peripheral T cells entering the intestines expressed not only increased quantities of CEACAM1 but also a marked dominance of CEACAM1-S isoforms.",

These studies showed that dominant expression of CEACAM1-S isoforms was lost under such conditions ( Figure 1F ) and demonstrated that the L:S ratio observed within intestinal tissues is determined by, and requires continuous exposure to, the relevant mucosal factors.

Recently, the trans-acting auxiliary splicing factors heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) L, hnRNP A1, and hnRNP M variants were shown to associate with exon 7 of the CEACAM1 messenger RNA (mRNA) and control splice-site recognition motifs giving rise to CEACAM1-L or CEACAM1-S isoforms. Specifically, whereas hnRNP A1 or hnRNP L promote CEACAM1-S isoform processing, hnRNP M fosters the generation of CEACAM1-L isoforms (Dery et al., 2011) . We therefore examined whether the preferential expression of CEACAM1-S isoforms observed in the intestinal T cells correlated with the appropriate profile of hnRNP expression as determined by qPCR. Indeed, the expression of hnRNP A1 ( Figure S1I ) was higher and the expression hnRNP M ( Figure S1J ) lower in T cells from PP in comparison to that observed in spleen and MLN. As such, the hnRNP A1:hnRNP M ratio gradually increased in T cells isolated from spleen, MLN, and PP consistent with the increased amounts of CEACAM1-S relative to CEACAM1-L in the intestine-associated tissues ( Figure S1K ). Together, these studies indicated that the tissue-associated microenvironment of the intestine was uniquely promoting CEACAM1 splicing which resulted in predominant CEACAM1-S expression.",

Results in T cells are limited to transfected in vitro model systems and remain controversial with both stimulatory and inhibitory functions assigned to CEACAM1-S splice variants (Chen and Shively, 2004a; Chen et al., 2004b) . Given the impossibility of generating a mouse specifically lacking the CEACAM1-S splice variant without also deleting the alternative CEACAM1-L variant, we generated CEACAM1-4S (4S) transgenic (Tg) mice, overexpressing the mouse 4S isoform specifically in T cells under the human CD2 (hCD2) promoter in order to explore the function of CEACAM1-S isoforms in T cells in vivo. The overexpression of 4S in T cells was confirmed by flow cytometry using the CC1 mAb. These studies confirmed that the T cells in the 4S Tg mice uniformly expressed increased CEACAM1 ( Figure S2A ) with a predominance of CEACAM1-S isoforms ( Figure S2B ).",

As illustrated in Figure S2F for IFN-g, CEACAM1-S induction of cytokines influenced the total CD4 + T cell population consistent with a broad activating function of the 4S isoform when highly expressed. CD3 + T cells isolated from the spleen of 4S Tg mice also exhibited a higher proliferation rate ( Figure 2D ) and more IFN-g ( Figure 2E ) and IL-2 ( Figure 2F ) secretion upon anti-CD3 stimulation ex vivo in comparison to that associated with T cells from WT littermate controls. However, with longer time-periods of culture, the proliferation rate of splenic CD3 + T cells from the 4S Tg mice was observed to be lower than that detected with the WT littermates after stimulation, consistent with in vitro T cell contraction due to increased activation-induced cell death (AICD) in the presence of the 4S isoform ( Figure 2G ). Consistent with this, splenic 4S Tg T cells exhibited increased annexin V staining ( Figure 2H ) and cleavage of caspase 3 ( Figure 2I ) after 3 hr of anti-CD3 stimulation. These results showed that the mouse 4S isoform both costimulated primary T cells and sensitized them to AICD, supporting previous in vitro transfection studies, which ascribe activating functions to this CEACAM1 isoform in contrast to the inhibitory functions of the L isoform (Chen and Shively, 2004a; Chen et al., 2004b) . Moreover, these observations further supported the idea that both the increased total CEACAM1 expression and the enrichment of the activating S isoform observed on T cells in intestinal tissues are associated with the effector memory T cell phenotype, which predominates in the normal intestinal LP under steady-state conditions (Hurst et al., 1999) .",

            "text": "Because the studies we performed in 4S Tg mice were undertaken in the context of endogenous CEACAM1 expression, it was possible that the apparent activating and inhibiting functions of the 4S isoform were either the consequence of CEACAM1mediated neutralization of CEACAM1-L inhibitory function and/ or the result of a direct activating signal by CEACAM1-S. To examine this question, we generated 4S Tg mice that lacked expression of any other CEACAM1 isoforms by crossing 4S Tg mice with Ceacam1 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice on a C57BL/6 background (Ceacam1 \u00c0/\u00c0 -4S Tg). Although less than that observed in 4S Tg T cells containing endogenous amounts of CEACAM1 in all cell types, Ceacam1 \u00c0/\u00c0 -4S Tg mice still contained more activated T cells in vivo as revealed by lower percentages of CD4 + (or CD8 + ) CD62L hi CD44 lo naive T cells, and higher percentages of CD4 + (or CD8 + ) CD62L lo CD44 hi effector memory T cells in spleen ( Figure 2J ), MLN, PP, and colon LP ( Figure S2G ) in comparison to Ceacam1 \u00c0/\u00c0 littermates. Ceacam1 \u00c0/\u00c0 -4S Tg mice also exhibited more apoptotic CD3 + T cells within the MLN, blood, and PP (Figure 2K) , inversely correlating with a decrease in CD3 + cells (Figure 2L) . CD4 + T cells isolated from the spleens of Ceacam1 \u00c0/\u00c0 -4S Tg mice also proliferated more vigorously ( Figure 2M ) and secreted more IL-2 ( Figure 2N ) and IFN-g ( Figure 2O ) upon anti-CD3 stimulation. Notably, splenic CD4 + T cells from Ceacam1 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice exhibited increased activation upon anti-CD3 stimulation that was intermediate to the anti-CD3 induced stimulation observed with WT and Ceacam1 \u00c0/\u00c0 -4S Tg T cells (Figures 2M-2O ). On the other hand, splenic T cells from mice in which only the CEACAM1-4L (4L) isoform was expressed by T cells, generated by crossing previously established 4L Tg mice (Nagaishi et al., 2006) with Ceacam1 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice, exhibited a blunted response to anti-CD3 stimulation that was less than that observed with WT T cells and is consistent with the inhibitory functions of this isoform ( Figures 2M-2O ). Taken together, these studies showed that loss of dominant endogenous CEACAM1-L inhibitory function in Ceacam1 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice or gain of CEACAM1-S expression independently of CEACAM1-L isoforms, as observed in Ceacam1 \u00c0/\u00c0 -4S Tg T cells, resulted in enhanced TCR-CD3 complex signaling. In comparison, gain of CEACAM1-L isoforms independently of CEACAM1-S isoforms led to inhibition of T cell function. Thus CEACAM1-S and CEACAM1-L were able to function as independent activating and inhibitory signaling units in T cells. Moreover, the blunted effects of CEACAM1 overexpression on T cells in vivo in the absence of CEACAM1 expression elsewhere ( Figures 2J-2L ) not only highlights the importance of homophilic interactions presumably in trans with CEACAM1 on non-T cells but also suggests a possible role for other heterophilic ligands in CEACAM1 activation.",

By doing so, we identified an elevation of a number of genes associated with the Ca 2+ -nuclear factor of activation (NFAT) signaling pathway (Hermann-Kleiter and Baier, 2010) (Table S1 ).

We first observed that, despite being present in equal numbers ( Figure 4A ), PP of 4S Tg small intestine were considerably larger in size than those of their WT counterparts ( Figure 4B ). Using a previously published scoring system, which takes into account both PP frequency and size (Barreau et al., 2007) , we determined that the total surface area occupied by PP of 4S Tg small intestine was substantially greater than that associated with their WT counterparts ( Figure 4C ). Because similar observations were made when Ceacam1 \u00c0/\u00c0 -4S Tg mice were compared to Ceacam1 \u00c0/\u00c0 littermate controls ( Figure 4D ), these observations provided evidence that enlarged PP size was a direct consequence of CEACAM1-S function.",

            "text": "We next determined whether the physiological role of CEACAM1 in regulating PP-mediated secretory immunity through CEACAM1-S expression extended to defense against a mucosal pathogen. In this regard, we chose to study Listeria monocytogenes, a Gram-positive intracellular pathogen, because previous studies indicate that Ceacam1 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice are susceptible to an intraperitoneal challenge with L. monocytogenes (Pan and Shively, 2010) and secretory immunity is likely to play an important role in immune defense against this bacterial pathogen (Manohar et al., 2001) . We therefore examined the responses of Ceacam1 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice, 4S Tg mice, and their WT littermates to oral infection with L. monocytogenes. Seventy-two hr after induction of infection, the bacterial burden in both Ceacam1 \u00c0/\u00c0 small intestine and liver were substantially higher than that in WT and 4S Tg mice. Specifically, a 1,000-fold increase in colony forming units (cfu) of L. monocytogenes was detected in the small intestine of Ceacam1 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice and a 100-fold increase in cfu of L. monocytogenes was observed in the liver of Ceacam1 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice compared to WT or 4S Tg mice, whereas no statistically significant difference was observed in the spleen for any group ( Figure 4J ). Conversely, the number of L. monocytogenes recovered from the small intestine, liver, and spleen of 4S Tg mice was decreased relative to that observed in WT mice ( Figure 4J ). It is also notable that the quantity of secretory IgA detected in the small intestinal secretions of 4S Tg mice challenged with L. monocytogenes was greatly increased relative to that observed in WT mice ( Figure 4K ). Consistent with this observation, the unrestrained L. monocytogenes infection identified in Ceacam1 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice was associated with decreased secretion of intestinal IgA and increased IgA concentration in the serum of Ceacam1 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice in response to infection ( Figure 4K ). These data demonstrated that CEACAM1, and particularly CEACAM1-S, is necessary for an optimal response to mucosal challenge with a bacterial pathogen and that this is mediated through CEACAM1dependent regulation of intestinal IgA secretion.",

Culture of full-thickness bowel and of luminal contents is used as a means for evaluation of predominant species found in the gut and provides a normalized assessment of microbial biomass relative to the input mass of full thickness segments of terminal ileum (Bj\u00f8rneklett et al., 1983) . Culturebased studies are also leveraged to identify individual species and communities of bacteria that play an essential role in eliciting host phenotypes (Baumgart et al., 2007) . Using aerobic and anaerobic culture techniques and selective and differential media, as described in Supplemental Information, we recovered nine distinct isolates from the ileum of 4S Tg and WT mice (Table 1; Table S3 ). These isolates spanned three orders, Lactobacillales, Bacillales and Bacteroidales, with 55% of isolates belonging to the genus Lactobacillus. The microbial diversity of the samples from 4S Tg mice was significantly higher than that of littermate WT controls, as assessed by multiple ecological measures of diversity (Table 1; Table S3 ). In addition, certain isolates were substantially more abundant in the 4S Tg mice as compared to WT controls, including Gemella morbillorum, Lactobacillus murinus, and Lactobacillus acidophilus. For Ceacam1 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice, we recovered ten distinct isolates spanning five orders, including those found in 4S Tg mice, and additionally the orders Clostridiales and Bifodobacteriales (Table 1; Table S3 ). Microbial diversity of the samples from Ceacam1 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice was also considerably higher than that of controls, but only one isolate, Lactobacillus brevis, was found to be more abundant in Ceacam1 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice (Table 1) . These studies showed that, as would be predicted by the observed increased and decreased IgA secretion (Fagarasan, 2008; Macpherson and Uhr, 2004) in 4S Tg and Ceacam1 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice, respectively, the composition of the commensal microbiota is regulated by CEACAM1.",

To do so, we focused our attention on defining the accessory molecules expressed by the small subset of CEACAM1 + T cells detected under physiologic conditions in spleen and MLN and which were increased in frequency in PP and LP in WT mice (see Figure 1A ). We observed that CD4 + CEACAM1 + T cells from the blood, MLN, PP, and LP expressed higher amounts of both CD44 and CD62L than did CD4 + CEACAM1 \u00c0 T cells (Figure 5A; Figures S3A-S3C ). This is consistent with CEACAM1 being associated with effector and/or central memory T cells. Additionally, we noted that CD4 + CEACAM1 + T cells from each of these tissue compartments expressed more a4b7-integrin than their CD4 + CEACAM1 \u00c0 counterparts, suggesting that CEACAM1 expression on T cells, even those within the peripheral immune system, is associated with enhanced potential to home to intestinal tissues. We also noted that CEACAM1 positivity was associated with preferential expression of PD-1, LAP (TGFb latency associated peptide), and B220, all of which are characteristics associated with T cell subsets possessing regulatory or accessory potential in the production of IgA (Fagarasan et al., 2001; Good-Jacobson et al., 2010; Ochi et al., 2006; Oida et al., 2003) .",

The preferential expression of PD-1 noted on CD4 + CEACAM1 + T cells further led us to investigate a subset of T cells on which this molecule is enriched. High expression of PD-1 is associated with T follicular helper (Tfh) cells, which regulate the formation of long-lived plasma cells by driving the survival and selection of B cells in mature germinal centers (Good-Jacobson et al., 2010) . In addition to PD-1, Tfh cells are identified by high expression of CXCR5 (Linterman et al., 2011) and upon investigation, we observed that CD4 + CEACAM1 + T cells from both the spleen and MLN of WT mice are enriched in expression of this chemokine receptor compared to their CD4 + CEACAM1 \u00c0 counterparts ( Figure 5D ). Thus, our data indicated that Tfh cells preferentially expressed CEACAM1 under physiological conditions. A deeper investigation of the CEACAM1 isoforms expressed by PD-1 + CXCR5 + Tfh cells also revealed an enrichment of CEACAM1-S isoforms in Tfh cells from the spleen, PP, and MLN ( Figure S3E ). Specifically, in contrast to the majority of peripheral CD4 + T cells, which predominantly express CEACAM1-L isoforms, Tfh cells expressed near equal amounts of CEACAM1-L and CEACAM1-S ( Figure S3E ). Collectively, these data provided evidence that high expression of CEACAM1, and in particular enrichment of CEACAM1-S, was a defining feature of certain subsets of CD4 + T cells under physiological conditions that serve a regulatory or accessory role in secretory immunity and preferentially localize to organized lymphoid structures and/or intestinal tissues.

Utilizing the CEACAM1 transgenic mice, we first examined the frequency of CD4 + CD25 \u00c0 LAP + T cells in mucosal tissues under conditions of forced overexpression of the CEACAM1-4L or CEACAM1-4S isoforms. These data demonstrated a significant increase in the percentage of CD4 + CD25 \u00c0 LAP + T cells in the MLN from 4S Tg mice relative to WT controls ( Figures 6A and 6B ) and in Ceacam1 \u00c0/\u00c0 -4S Tg mice compared to Ceacam1 \u00c0/\u00c0 controls ( Figures 6C and 6D ). This increase in CD4 + CD25 \u00c0 LAP + cells was specifically detected under conditions of overexpression of the CEACAM1-4S isoform in both WT and Ceacam1 \u00c0/\u00c0 animals ( Figures 6A and 6C ) and was notably absent in CEACAM1-4L transgenic mice in which the inhibitory CEACAM1 isoform was overexpressed ( Figures  6B and 6D) . Given the detected increases in cell death in both CD4 + LAPand CD4 + LAP + populations in 4S Tg animals (Figure S4A ), our finding of an expanded population of viable CD4 + LAP + T cells under conditions of CEACAM1S overexpression can best be explained not by decreased AICD among this population but rather by increased generation of the CD4 + LAP + T cells in the presence of forced CEACAM1-4S expression. In stark contrast, our analysis did not reveal any differences in the frequency of CD4 + CD25 + Foxp3 + T cells upon forced expression of CEACAM1-4S in T cells relative to that observed in WT mice (data not shown). In order to ascertain whether enrichment of activating CEACAM1-S was functionally relevant to CD4 + CD25 \u00c0 LAP + T cells, we examined the in vitro suppressive function of CD4 + LAP + T regulatory cells obtained from the MLN of 4S Tg mice. We found that these cells possessed enhanced regulatory activity when compared to CD4 + CD25 \u00c0 LAP + T cells from WT controls ( Figure 6E ). In contrast, no differences were observed in the regulatory potential between 4S Tg and WT CD4 + CD25 + Treg cells obtained from the MLN in similar assays ( Figure 6E ). Taken together, these studies indicated that the relative increase of CEACAM1-4S, in the absence of any contribution from the inhibitory CEACAM1-L isoforms, specifically enhanced both the development and functional capacity of regulatory CD4 + CD25 \u00c0 LAP + T cells.",

We thus made use of this approach in order to determine whether CEACAM1 is specifically involved in the induction phase of CD4 + CD25 \u00c0 LAP + T cell development under conditions of physiological CEACAM1 expression. Although no significant differences were identified in the proportions of CD4 + CD25 +/\u00c0 LAP + Treg cells in spleen, MLN, PP, or blood of untreated or isotype-treated Ceacam1 \u00c0/\u00c0 and WT mice, oral administration of anti-CD3 antibody substantially increased the percentage of CD4 + CD25 \u00c0 LAP + T cells in the MLN of WT but not Ceacam1 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice ( Figure 6F ; data not shown).

Flow cytometric analysis of each of these tissues revealed an enrichment not only of PD-1 itself (Figure S4C) but also of the PD-1 + CXCR5 + population of Tfh cells in the 4S Tg mice compared to their WT littermate controls (Figure 6G) . Importantly, CEACAM1-4S-mediated enrichment of Tfh cells occurred completely independently of the CEACAM1-4L isoform since Ceacam1 \u00c0/\u00c0 -4S Tg mice also contained much higher amounts of Tfh cells than their Ceacam1 \u00c0/\u00c0 counterparts ( Figure 6H ). Collectively, our data are consistent with a role for CEACAM1-S isoforms in promoting the development of two types of accessory cells (CD4 + CD25 \u00c0 LAP + T cells and Tfh cells), which are not only enriched in organized lymphoid structures and mucosal tissues but are also known to be involved in B cell activation (Cerutti, 2008; Good-Jacobson et al., 2010) , and likely thus contribute to the ability of CEACAM1 to regulate secretory intestinal immunity.",

Although CEACAM1 is an activation-induced molecule on T cells, the observed tissue-specific splicing was not due to activation of the T cells per se because it was not observed when T cells were stimulated ex vivo. Adoptive transfer experiments demonstrated that CEACAM1-S dominance was gained by naive peripheral T cells upon entry into the intestines and was lost when mucosal T cells were removed from the intestines and restimulated ex vivo. This indicated that the specific mucosal milieu of the intestines promotes CEACAM1-S expression in T cells. Moreover, our results in 4S Tg mice indicated that CEACAM1-S facilitates T cell activation and the induction of secretory IgA immunity. Consistent with this, T cell subsets that bore a memory phenotype characteristic of mucosal tissues (Gibbons and Spencer, 2011) and specific subsets of T cells such as CD4 + CD25 \u00c0 LAP + and Tfh cells, which encourage secretory immunity, displayed an enrichment upon CEACAM1-S expression and were driven by its presence. Thus, CEACAM1-S expression is promoted and maintained by the mucosal environment and facilitates T cell activation linked to the generation of cell types responsible for mucosal regulation and protection.",

Whether these factors include soluble (e.g., cytokines) or cell surface molecules unique to the mucosal tissues, it is clear that they regulate both the extent of CEACAM1 expression and the splicing of its mRNA.

Moreover, we have now shown that CEACAM1-S in T cells can elicit this stimulation as an independent signaling unit without CEACAM1-L assistance in vivo. Through these properties, CEACAM1-S regulates specific subsets of T cells. These cell populations include CD4 + LAP + T cells and Tfh cells that are an integral component of mucosal tissues and organized lymphoid structures, respectively, and are known to regulate secretory immunity (Linterman et al., 2011) . In view of CEACAM1-S enrichment in these latter cell types irrespective of their localization to peripheral or mucosal tissues as well as with our observations that the intestinal tissues facilitate CEACAM1-S expression, our studies also raise that possibility that CD4 + LAP + T cells and Tfh cells may be born in and/or modified remotely by mucosal factors.",

            "text": "Although little is known about CEACAM1-S signaling in T cells, in epithelial cells it is known to associate with the cytoskeleton (actin and tropomyosin), calmodulin, and annexin II (Edlund et al., 1996; Kirshner et al., 2003; Schumann et al., 2001) . Such intracellular associations, interestingly, are linked to the promotion of apoptosis of mammary epithelial cells during acini morphogenesis (Kirshner et al., 2003) . In addition, consistent with previous transfection studies in Jurkat T cells, CEACAM1-S signaling is able to activate NFAT in vivo (Chen et al., 2004b) . As shown here, this was associated with the upregulation of NFAT-dependent soluble and cell surface molecules such as PD-1 and CD40L. Thus, the current studies not only demonstrate the importance of CEACAM1-S in T cells under physiological conditions but also their role in delivering independent signals that may oppose those provided by CEACAM1-L isoforms. Such observations further highlight the functional similarities between CEACAM1 and other signaling pathways that comprise highly related activating and inhibiting modules such as CD28 and CTLA-4 (Greenwald et al., 2005) .",

            "text": "Presumably through its NFAT-related activation functions, CEACAM1-S-mediated T cell activation of B cells in the PP promoted the generation of IgA plasma blasts, the expansion of PP size and IgA secretion into the lumen. Given the decreased IgA secretion observed in the absence of CEACAM1 expression and increased IgA secretion when CEACAM1-4S was overexpressed on T cells, CEACAM1-S in T cells emerges as an important factor in directly regulating B cell function and PP structure. PP are the essential inductive sites for regulation of antigenspecific IgA antibody responses following oral immunization, although a PP-independent pathway for mucosal IgA responses also likely exists (Macpherson and Slack, 2007; Cerutti, 2008; Hashizume et al., 2008) . Previous studies show that selective TGF-b receptor type II deficiency in B cells results in loss of IgA-expressing cells in the spleen and PP (Borsutzky et al., 2004; Cazac and Roes, 2000) . Consistent with this, CD4 + CD25 + Tregs have been identified as major helper cells for IgA responses to microbial antigens such as flagellin, presumably through their secretion of TGF-b (Cong et al., 2009) . Because CD4 + CD25 \u00c0 LAP + T regulatory cells are also TGF-b-dependent (Ochi et al., 2006; Oida et al., 2003) , were increased in the mucosal tissues of mice that overexpress CEA-CAM1-4S, and inadequately expanded by T cell receptordependent signals in the absence of CEACAM1 expression, a plausible mechanistic explanation for the increased IgA production and TGF-b secretion observed in 4S Tg mice is that CD4 + CD25 \u00c0 LAP + T cells are a responsible factor. Additionally, the increased frequency of PD-1 + CXCR5 + Tfh cells that we observed in the spleen, MLN, and PP of 4S Tg mice is likely to provide additional stimulation to IgA-producing plasma blasts because CXCR5 + Tfh cells in B cell zones of lymphoid tissues possess significant capacity for supporting IgG and IgA production by B cells (Fazilleau et al., 2009a) . The ability of Tfh cells to regulate antigen-specific B cell immunity in vivo is likely linked to its high expression of PD-1, which is NFAT-dependent (Oestreich et al., 2008) and is known to deliver signals that promote long-lived plasma cell responses (Good-Jacobson et al., 2010) . Thus, our studies showed that CEACAM1-S regulates secretory IgA within PP via its ability to elicit NFAT-mediated signaling that enhances the expression of cell surface molecules such as CD40L and PD-1, the expansion of CD4 + CD25 \u00c0 LAP + T cells and Tfh cells, and the secretion of TGF-b, IL-2, IL-4, and IL-10 by CD4 + T cells, all factors that promote secretory IgA immunity (Cazac and Roes, 2000; Cerutti, 2008; Good-Jacobson et al., 2010; Massacand et al., 2008) . As a consequence, in the absence of CEACAM1, secretory IgA is reduced.",

            "text": "The ability of CEACAM1 to regulate secretory IgA production is also interesting given the well-known role of CEACAM1 as a microbial receptor (Gray-Owen and Blumberg, 2006) . Moreover, bacteria are well-known inducers of secretory IgA production (Macpherson and Slack, 2007) and IgA in turn regulates the composition of the commensal microbiota (Fagarasan, 2008) . For example, IgA concentrations are very low in GF animals with normalization of these amounts within a few weeks following intestinal bacterial colonization after birth (Hapfelmeier et al., 2010) . IgA-deficiency is also associated with a bloom in certain organisms in the intestinal lumen (Suzuki et al., 2004) . Furthermore, secretory IgA promotes both immune exclusion and neutralization of translocated bacteria, which preserves intestinal barrier integrity by preventing bacterial-induced inflammation (Boullier et al., 2009 ). In addition, IgA can promote bacterial colonization as shown for Helicobacter sp., which bind to the gastric epithelium via IgA but do not invade (Taylor et al., 2007) . As such, IgA can contribute to the survival of certain classes of bacteria within the intestines. The latter is also consistent with the ability of secreted IgA to bind to luminal bacteria (van der Waaij et al., 1996) and in some cases inhibit their invasiveness, as observed during Salmonella typhimurium infection (Wijburg et al., 2006) . Consistent with this, we observed that CEACAM1 gain-of-function in T cells and loss-of-function correlated with the ability of the host to resist the pathogenicity of L. monocytogenes infection. Ceacam1 \u00c0/\u00c0 and 4S Tg mice also demonstrated increased community diversity of the commensal ileal microbiota, with a predominance of Lactobacillus and Streptococcus species as compared to WT controls. This indicated that CEACAM1-S dependent effector functions of these T cells have the capacity to modulate the composition of microbial communities in the small intestine, presumably through their effects on IgA secretion. These observations not only further support a role for CEACAM1 in the generation of secretory immunity but show that it is physiologically important to the regulation and control of the intestinal microbiota and enteropathogens.",
