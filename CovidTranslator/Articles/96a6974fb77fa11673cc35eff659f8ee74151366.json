All ages of pheasants are purported to be highly susceptible to infection with NDV, but clinical signs and mortality levels in infected birds vary considerably.

Pheasants are predominantly reared in large numbers in parts of Europe for shooting as a sport on game bird 'estates'. Although at one time rearing pheasants was labour intensive and involved the use of surrogate domestic hens in the hatching and rearing stages, the usual practice now is to obtain the eggs from pheasants retained from the previous year and these are hatched in hatcheries similar to those used for commercial domestic fowl. The birds are then reared semi-intensively until released through pens that allow the pheasants to move out gradually into the cover where they will live extensively and be driven from to be shot. There is considerable trade, both nationally and interna-tionally in day-old and older chicks and, to a lesser extent, hatching eggs.",

This figure probably corresponds to numbers approaching 30 million pheasants being released, as Turner and Sage (2003) reported that only 30.5% of pheasants released were shot on the estate where they were released and only 16% survived the game bird shooting season. Earlier, Tapper (1999) had estimated annual figures of 20 million pheasants released and 8 million resident birds in the UK.",

Kaleta and Baldauf (1988) reported that natural or experimental infection with NDV has been described in 27/50 orders of birds, and suggested that despite no record of infection of birds in some orders, it is likely that all would be susceptible to infection. They reported a high level of susceptibility in Phasianiformes (including gallinaceous birds), Psittaciformes, Struthioniformes and Columbiformes. This statement is well supported by the fact that these species have been affected in many recent outbreaks of NDV across the world (Alexander, 2001) . All ages of pheasants are highly susceptible to ND, and infection with NDV often leads to death, which is preceded by a range of clinical signs (Higgins, 1982) . In this article, it is intended to review the literature available describing infections in pheasants.",

Several publications in the 1940s discussed ND infections in the birds (Brandly et al., 1946; Levine et al., 1947; Wagener, 1948) and these probably represent the earliest recognition of the disease in pheasant. Beer (1976) reported that the first outbreak of ND in free-living pheasants in the UK was in 1963. In the earliest reports pheasants were often infected during epizootics in chickens and there was debate as to whether the pheasants introduced the disease to chickens or vice versa. What is clear is that when outbreaks of ND have been widespread in chickens, pheasants have also been affected. For example, during the extensive ND epidemic in poultry that began in Essex (UK) in 1970, isolations of NDV were made from submissions of pheasants over a seven-month period from birds showing clinical signs (Borland, 1972) .",

In a further example, pigeons and doves infected with PPMV-1 were proposed as the likely sources of virus causing disease in nearby pheasants, since the viruses isolated from the two sources were quite distinctive and very closely related (Aldous et al., 2004; Alexander et al., 1997a ).",

Considering the increasingly intensive nature of the pheasant industry, and the associated trade and movement of pheasants and their products, it would seem possible that diseased birds may be moved significant distances and have the potential to mix at holding stations before any infection with NDV could be detected.

In a similar study, Lage et al. (1974) experimentally infected chickens, turkeys, guinea fowl, pheasants and quails with velogenic NDV and reported pheasants to be the most susceptible and quails to be the most resistant.",

This was confirmed by Borland (1972) , who reported that the outbreaks investigated remained localised, and by Beer (1976) , who described pheasants as sedentary creatures in which movements of even one kilometre are unusual. It would seem fair to suggest that the real risk that pheasants pose in the dissemination of NDV is when (unknowingly) infected birds are shipped, mixed with other poultry and transported by humans (Shortridge et al., 1978) . This con-clusion is confirmed by the recent outbreak of ND in pheasants in Great Britain (Aldous et al., 2007) , where disease signs were recorded at a shooting estate shortly after receiving a batch of imported pheasant chicks and virulent NDV was isolated.",
