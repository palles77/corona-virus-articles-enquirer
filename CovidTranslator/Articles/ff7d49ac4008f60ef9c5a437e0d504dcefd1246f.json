The number of searches surged after newsworthy events but was low during the epidemic itself and had declined to about 20% of maximum search volume by the time of the actual peak, as shown by traditional surveillance. Fur-thermore, no discernible local maxima were observed that corresponded to the peak in case data.

Our experience is that using Google Insights to survey a disease may not work well for diseases with considerable media exposure, in particular, emerging diseases such as pandemic (H1N1) 2009 or severe acute respiratory syndrome. Such outbreaks may require the more sophisticated approach used by Flu Trends, should it be extended to other diseases and more corners of the globe. We agree with Pelat et al. (3) that Google Insights may work well for less-publicized infectious diseases. The dividing line between well-publicized and unpublicized diseases may, however, remain ambiguous. Thus, to ensure that web search data refl ect disease incidence requires validation against traditional surveillance, although in that situation, the availability of corroborating traditional methods of surveillance limits the value of webquery data.",

Recent articles note inconsistencies between a rat fl eaborne pandemic of Yersinia pestis (the bacterium that causes bubonic plague) and the documented characteristics of Black Death (1, among others). Ayyadurai et al. (2) acknowledge that a rat fl ea-only hypothesis does not fi t Black Death observations, but they resolve theoretical transmission inconsistencies through a louse-borne hypothesis. Ayyadurai et al. base their surety of fact-that medieval \"plagues\" were caused by Y. pestis infection-on a 2007 study (3) in which 5 of 36 teeth of \"plague\" victims, none of which were dated to the Black Death era (1347-1351), contained biological evidence of Y. pestis. The 3 locations in that study were all port cities: 2 on the Mediterranean Sea and 1 on the Rhone River. As Duncan and Scott (4) note, bubonic plague most likely existed endemically near ship-borne trade, unlike the fast-moving epidemic fronts exhibited by medieval \"plagues.\" Moreover, Gilbert et al. (5) found no Y. pestis DNA in 61 skeletons from primarily nonport locations in England, France, and Denmark.",

However, given the differences mentioned above and improved knowledge on the rapidity of virus mutation and worldwide transmission potential, we merely argue that the simplest explanation for medieval plagues has yet to be ruled out: that they may have resulted from a human-to-human transmitted virus. Adding complexity to an already complicated etiologic theory, and stating such as historical fact based on limited geography and sample size, does not seem congruent with Occam's razor. (1) reminded us of a littleknown paper (2) on rats and Black Death by our colleague and mentor David E. Davis. He researched and wrote in his retirement after years of research and refl ection on rat ecology and rodent-borne diseases (3, 4) . Rattus rattus is commonly recognized as the vertebrate host of fl ea-borne plague that swept through Europe in the 1300s, killing >50% of the population. Davis believed this explanation did not fi t what he knew of the ecologic requirements of fl eas and black rats. He studied reports of archeologic excavations and reviewed poems, medieval bestiaries, and paintings and concluded that these rats were scarce during the Black Death era.",

            "text": "His theory, based on historical information and investigative trips to Europe, was that invasive rats, if present, mostly occurred in low densities in port areas, not in rural inland areas. He noted that the expected rodent die-offs with bubonic plague were not associated with human epidemics and that rodent fl eas would not have been active during winter to transmit plague. Flea-borne transmission from rodents usually causes a few deaths per household, but deaths of entire households commonly occurred in the medieval epidemics. Human-tohuman transmission of pneumonic plague must have occurred, but as described by Ayyadurai et al., there was evidence of human bubonic plague, suggesting vector involvement. Davis did not present a viable reservoir/vector hypothesis for plague transmission; this and the later, well-known association of R. rattus and other rodents with plague throughout the world, may partially explain why his ideas received little attention. The fi nding that human body lice can be bubonic plague vectors suggests a mechanism for humanto-human transmission continuing during winter in inland areas and, as suggested by the authors, could also explain total deaths in households.",
