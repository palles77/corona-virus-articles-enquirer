The titer of MItV-3 fell to a low level within 24 hour and rose 10-to 100-fold between days 5 and 9. Substantial quantities of virus were still released into the medium by day 12. In cultures inoculated with MHV-S no significant increase in viral titer was observed, but infectious virus was still found by day 9. Since it is assumed that very young animals are generally more susceptible to viral infections, attempts were made to grow MI-IV-S in organ cultures of trachea from 1-day-old mice ( Fig. 1 b) . Each culture received an inoculum of 10 a TCIDs0 of virus. There was a 10-fold increase in viral titer between days 5 and 9, and virus continued to appear in the medium throughout the observation period of 14 days. Figure 1 shows further that M_t/V-3 and MHV-S disappeared from tissue-flee control dishes within 28 hours. Taking into consideration the rapid thermal inactivation of the viruses and the multiple dilution of complete medium changes, it was concluded that MI-IV-3 and MttV-S multiplied in the culture system.",
