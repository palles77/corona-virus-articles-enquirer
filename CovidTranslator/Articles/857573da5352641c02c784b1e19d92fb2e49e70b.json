            "text": "The Influenza virus is a leading cause of respiratory disease in the United States each year. While the virus normally causes mild to moderate disease, hospitalization and death can occur in many cases. There are several methodologies that are used for detection; however problems such as decreased sensitivity and high rates of false-negative results may arise. There is a crucial need for an effective sample preparation technology that concentrates viruses at low abundance while excluding resident analytes that may interfere with detection. Nanotrap particles are hydrogel particles that are coupled to chemical dye affinity baits that bind a broad range of proteins and virions. Within minutes (<30 minutes), Nanotrap particles concentrate low abundant proteins and viruses from clinically complex matrices. Nanotrap particles with reactive red baits concentrated numerous respiratory viruses including various strains and subtypes of Influenza virus, Coronavirus, and Respiratory Syncytial Virus from saliva, nasal fluid swab specimens, and nasal aspirates. Detection was enhanced more than 10-fold when coupled to plaque assays and qRT-PCR. Importantly, Nanotrap particle can efficiently capture and concentrate multiple viral pathogens during a coinfection scenario. These results collectively demonstrate that Nanotrap particles are an important tool that can easily be integrated into various detection methodologies.",

In the United States alone, the virus is responsible for more than 35,000 deaths and 200,000 hospitalizations each year. 2, 3 While seasonal epidemics occur each year, there have been several pandemics that have occurred during the last century. The emergence of a novel H1N1 strain in 1918 led to 500 million infections and over 50 million deaths worldwide. 4 Almost a century later, there was the appearance of the novel H1N1 strain of Influenza in 2009 5 that was antigenically different than any previous H1N1 epidemic strains yet striking similar to the 1918 H1N1 strain. 6 There is still concern that another pandemic, similar to the \"1918 Spanish flu,\" can emerge that would kill millions worldwide. The ability of Influenza virus to rapidly evolve results in vaccines and diagnostic assays becoming potentially ineffective.",

            "text": "Current Influenza diagnostic capabilities have limitations, especially in the detection of the virus at low viral genomic copies. 4 While Rapid Influenza Diagnostic Tests (RIDTs) can detect the virus in less than thirty minutes, specimens must be collected as early in the illness as possible (by 72 hours after infection) so that high viral loads and viral antigen levels are present. 7 Studies conducted by CDC have shown that RIDTs are only 50-70% sensitive compared to reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays and viral culture, leading to many false negative results. 8 This is largely due to the use of a small volume of sample in these assays as well as the inclusion and subsequent interference of high abundant proteins in complex solutions such as nasopharyngeal aspirates and swab samples. Therefore, a definitive diagnosis must be confirmed by molecular assays or viral culture. Molecular assays such as RT-PCR are able to identify viral RNA from various strains and subtypes of Influenza. However, one limitation is that the detection of viral RNA by these assays is not indicative of viable virus or on-going Influenza viral replication in the respiratory specimen, which is only possible with viral culturing. 6 Propagation of the virus through culturing facilitates analysis of the virus by additional methods that can be used to compare the virulence and antiviral resistance of novel, circulating, and vaccine strains of the virus. 6 Therefore, there is a substantial need for an accurate and reliable sample preparation methodology that concentrates whole virus from clinically complex specimens and increases the sensitivity of various diagnostic assays for Influenza and other respiratory pathogens.",

            "text": "Nanotrap particles are a versatile technology that can address these critical diagnostic challenges. Importantly, while most concentrators require cold-chain methodologies, Nanotrap particles can be utilized at both ambient and elevated temperatures. Furthermore, the particles are capable of concentrating analytes of interest from large volumes of complex biological fluids (such as nasal aspirates) into a significantly smaller volume (as low as 25 mL). 9,10 At the heart of Nanotrap technology is a base particle consisting of a network of crosslinked environmentally-responsive polymer chains that have been functionalized with affinity baits to facilitate analyte capture and retention. 11 The versatility of the Nanotrap particles stems from the variety of affinity baits that can be immobilized onto the polymer matrix. To date, Nanotrap particles with affinity dyes as well as ligates containing cationic, carboxylic acid, or sulfonic acid groups have been generated and utilized to target a wide range of small proteins and peptides. The analyte capture performance of the Nanotrap particles can be further altered by customizing the particle architecture (such as addition of a charged or inert polymer shell) to suit the intended application. [12] [13] [14] This novel sample preparation methodology has been utilized for the concentration and enhanced detection of infectious disease proteins, including a low-abundant bacterial antigen Outer surface protein A (OspA) used to diagnose Lyme disease 10 and the nucleoprotein of Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV). 9 While the Nanotrap particles were originally designed to specifically harvest proteins and other small molecules, recent findings by Shafagati et al have shown that the Nanotrap particles can also be used in the capture and detection of virions. 15 The ability of the Nanotrap particles to capture virions allows samples to be analyzed through numerous downstream analytical techniques (both protein and nucleic acid based) including standard sandwich ELISAs, lateral flow immunoassays, mass spectroscopy (MS) techniques, or q-RT-PCR assays. In addition to RVFV, Nanotrap particles have been shown to capture other viruses such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV), Influenza, human Coronavirus, and Adenovirus. 11, 15 Here these findings were expanded to determine the utility of Nanotrap particles for respiratory pathogen detection, focusing primarily on Influenza virus. Data within demonstrate that this novel sample preparation tool can be coupled to both plaque assays and qRT-PCR, to enhance viral detection at varying concentrations. Importantly, the Nanotrap particles captured virus in various clinically relevant matrices commonly used in influenza diagnostics, including nasal aspirates, nasal swabs, and saliva. Lastly, Nanotrap capture was not curtailed in a coinfection scenario with various subtypes and strains of Influenza as well as other respiratory viruses.",

            "text": "Previous published findings demonstrated that several Nanotrap particles were capable of capturing different viruses, including respiratory pathogens such as Influenza. 11 In order to quantitatively determine which Nanotrap particles were able to enhance detection of Influenza A, 5 different types of Nanotrap particles (NT45, NT46, NT53, NT69, and NT120) were screened for virus capture and enrichment performance ( Table 1 ). The Nanotrap particles were incubated with one milliliter of Influenza A/California/04/09 (IA H1N1) at 5EC05 pfu/ mL. Following capture, viral RNA was extracted and the amount of virus captured was determined using qRT-PCR. While all 5 Nanotrap particles successfully captured and enriched the virus, NT46, a Nanotrap particle with an immobilized reactive red dye as the bait, provided a 10-fold increase in detection compared to samples without Nanotrap particles, which were processed in parallel (Fig. 1A) . The enrichment capability of NT46 was then confirmed in other strains and subtypes of Influenza. Another Influenza A strain, Brisbane/10/2007 (H3N2) (IA H3N2), and Influenza B were tested with and without NT46. For IA H3N2, a 9-fold increase in detection was obtained with qRT-PCR (Fig. 1B) . For Influenza B, there was a 7-fold increase in detection (Fig. 1C) . To ensure that whole infectious virus was being captured, plaque assays were performed. As in panel A, five Nanotrap particles were incubated with Influenza A, the pellet resuspended in media, and plaque assays were performed directly on the Nanotrap-viral mixture. Once again, NT46 was the best performer, providing an 8-fold increase in detection compared to the no Nanotrap control (Fig. 1D) . With NT46, a 7-fold increase in detection for IA H3N2 (Fig. 1E ) and 6-fold increase in detection with Influenza B (Fig. 1F) were obtained. Collectively, these results demonstrate that infectious virions can be captured and enriched using NT46 and increased detection, up to 10-fold and 8-fold in qRT-PCR and plaque assay, respectively can be achieved. While Influenza capture can vary depending on the strain and subtype, NT46 consistently enhanced the detection of various Influenza viruses with plaque assays and qRT-PCR. Therefore subsequent experiments were focused on evaluating the enrichment performance of NT46.",

In agreement with the results presented in Figure 1 , NT46 was the most efficient at capturing HA protein from IA H1N1 (HA1) ( Fig. 2A) . NT46 was able to capture as little as 10 ng/mL of HA1 protein, yielding approximately 100 fold enrichment compared to the no NT control (Fig. 2B ). There are a variety of Influenza virus subtypes (currently 16 HA subtypes) and mutations in the HA protein occur quite frequently. 16 To determine if Nanotrap particles can broadly bind to HA proteins, HA5 and HA7 proteins were also tested. NT46 was also capable of capturing and enriching HA5 and HA7 proteins ( Fig. 3C and  3D ). These results indicate that Nanotrap particles can bind to multiple HA proteins and suggest that they would be capable of capturing Influenza viruses even if they were to mutate.",

Therefore, in parallel to NT46, two additional red particles with different architectures were tested for Influenza capture (Table 1) . NT46S contains an inert polymer shell surrounding the dye-functionalized Nanotrap particle core, while the NT46V particle core is encapsulated within a charged polymer shell containing sulfonic acid groups. Capture of Influenza with NT46, NT46S, and NT46V were compared to one another in a saline solution containing no additional host proteins. In this scenario, there was no significant difference in viral RNA detection among the three reactive red particle types (Fig. 3A) . Since there was no difference in capture for the two core-shell particles, only NT46 and NT46V were utilized in subsequent experiments.",

[20] [21] [22] Therefore, it is important for a Nanotrap particle to enrich virus not only in the presence of other host and viral analytes, but also in the presence of other infectious pathogens. In order to test the enrichment capability of the Nanotrap particles, NT46 was utilized in a dual infection scenario with multiple respiratory viruses. It was hypothesized that two virus types will compete for binding of NT46, Figure 4 . Nanotrap particles enhanced detection of Influenza at both high and low titers. A-C) IA H1N1 was diluted from 1EC05 pfu/mL to 1EC01 pfu/ml in saline (panel A), 1EC05 pfu/mL to 1EC01 pfu/ml in nasal wash (panel B), or 1EC05 pfu/mL to 1EC00 pfu/ml in 10% human saliva (panel C) and incubated with NT46. Samples were processed for qRT-PCR as described in Figure 1 . No NT samples (at 100 mL volumes) were processed in parallel. D and E) IA H1N1 was diluted from 7.5EC05 pfu/ml to 7.5EC02 pfu/ml in saline solution (panel D) or diluted from 2.0EC04 pfu/mL to 2.0EC02 pfu/ml in 10% human saliva (panel E) and incubated with NT46. Samples were processed for plaque assay as described in Figure 1 . No NT samples (at 100 mL volumes) were processed in parallel. Statistical significance for all panels was determined through student's t-tests: \u00c3 p-value 0 .05, \u00c3\u00c3 p-value 0 .01, \u00c3\u00c3 p-value 0 .01, \u00c3\u00c3\u00c3\u00c3 p-value 0 .0001, and n.s is not significant (compared to the -NT sample). Dashed lines represent the lower LOD for the assays, which is 100 genomic copies/reaction for IA H1N1 qRT-PCR and 2EC01 pfu/ml for the plaque assays. and detection with Nanotrap particles for one or both viruses may therefore be decreased. To test this hypothesis, a mock coinfection scenario was performed by incubating NT46 with a sample containing both IA H1N1 and IA H3N2 at 1EC05 pfu/mL in saline solution. For the NT46-incubated samples, there was no significant change in the detection of IA H1N1 in the presence of IA H3N2. Likewise there was no statistically significant drop in IA H3N2 detection in the presence of IA H1N1 (Fig. 6A ). Next, a mock infection scenario with IA H1N1 and Influenza B (IB) viruses in saline solution was performed. Again, for the samples incubated with NT46, there was no significant change in either IA H1N1 or IB detection (Fig. 6B ). There was no significant change in detection for the no Nanotrap samples in the presence of multiple viruses (data not shown).",

In 2013, the capture and enrichment of virions from RVFV and other viral pathogens was shown with several Nanotrap particles. 15 Importantly, the virus can be inactivated with heat or detergent after Nanotrap particle incubation and viral nucleic acid is still detectable with qRT-PCR.

Data demonstrating that NT46 captures HA1, HA5, and HA7 proteins support this hypothesis. As previously mentioned, NT46 contains a reactive red dye. This triazine-derived textile dye has a negative charge and has commonly been used for protein purification via affinity chromatography. 24 The structure of the triazine dyes mimics the structure of substrates that bind to the active sites of different proteins, and is therefore able to bind a broad class of proteins and enzymes. 25 It is possible that triazine dyes may bind to molecules involved in the infection mediated by viral envelope proteins, or more specifically, the extracellular portion of viral glycoproteins that is involved in virus-cell fusion. 26 It is further speculated that a charge-based interaction could a play a role in NT46 binding with the virus. 12 The host cell membrane and sialic acid receptors have a net negative charge while HA1 subunit of human Influenza A typically has a positive charge. 27 The negative charge of the anionic NT46 may mimic the interaction that the host has with the viral glycoproteins and therefore facilitate binding to the positive charged portion of HA. Alternately, other positively-charged Nanotrap particles could be binding to the negatively charged zone in the neuraminidase active site. 16 NT46 was previously shown to capture RVFV and HIV to varying degrees. 15 However a Nanotrap particle containing cibracon blue was the most effective at capturing RVFV and HIV, suggesting that RVFV and HIV glycoproteins have a greater affinity for cibracon blue as compared to the reactive red affinity bait. In order to investigate these theories, future studies will utilize electron microscopy to determine the exact mechanism of Nanotrap particle binding to the virion.",

Nasopharyngeal and saliva samples contain viscous analytes that non-specifically bind to antibodies and can significantly decrease detection. Furthermore, nasal wash collection dramatically dilutes the sample as a total of 3-8 mL can be collected from one patient. 28, 29 However, molecular assays and RIDTs allow testing of only 50-120 mL of sample. The nasal aspirate experiments performed here utilized 1 mL of sample with Nanotrap particles. While there is a slight drop in detection in clinically relevant matrices (nasal aspirate, nasal fluid, and saliva) compared to saline solution, there is significant enrichment of both saliva and nasal aspirate samples with NT46. NT46V, the coreshell variety of NT46, was tested to determine if the presence of a polymeric shell could improve Influenza detection in clinically relevant matrices. NT46V contains an outer polymer shell functionalized with sulfonic acid groups, which provides the particle with a negative charge. Since there was no significant change in capture with particles that contained a shell versus core-only particles, the presence of the polymer shell was not necessary for analyte capture for this specific application. Virions potentially bind to host proteins such as mucin that are found in nasal fluid and saliva. The more promiscuous nature of core-only particles may allow these protein-bound virions to be captured by the Nanotrap particles, whereas the presence of a polymer shell would make any affinity baits within the core less accessible, thereby excluding the virus-protein complexes and only binding individual virions. Interestingly, when using the core-only particles masking of binding sites was not observed. One possible explanation for this observation may be due to the negative charge of the NT46 particles. Results of this study suggest that the negative charge of the NT46 particle is capable of repelling some types of matrix proteins from binding, allowing for target analytes to interact with the affinity dye immobilized onto the core particles.",

While the promiscuity of the Nanotrap particles allows for more than one virus or analyte to be captured, the results demonstrate that this feature does not interfere with the Nanotrap particle's enrichment capability in a dual infection scenario. This feature of the Nanotrap particles is favorable when the cause of infection is unknown as several viruses can result in the same symptoms. Moreover, patients may be coinfected with more than one pathogen at a time. While infectivity with multiple pathogens is rarely tested by clinicians, several studies have shown that dual respiratory virus infection occurs in almost 20% of cases of lower respiratory tract infections. This is especially common in children and in those with immunocompromised systems. 30, 31 In one study, 20 out of 75 children were infected with more than one type of respiratory virus. In most cases with children, coinfection commonly occurs with RSV and another respiratory pathogen such as Influenza. 31 Although rare, coinfection with both Influenza A and B types have also been seen in patients. 32 It is also important to note that secondary bacterial infections with Streptococcus pneumoniae oftentimes arise after infection with Influenza and may lead to serious \"superinfections.\" 33 The results show that the Nanotrap can successfully capture and detect multiple viral pathogens in one sample. While the Nanotrap particles have been utilized for the capture of virus, there is no published data on the capture of bacteria with Nanotrap particles. Since bacteria are significantly larger than viruses, Nanotrap particles with larger surface areas may be optimal for the capture of bacteria. Future studies will investigate the enrichment capability of the Nanotrap particles with bacteria causing respiratory disease (such as Streptococcus pneumoniae) and couple the Nanotrap particle technology to a multiplex assay that can test for multiple pathogens, both viral and bacterial, in one sample and with one Nanotrap particle (NT46).",

Additional sample processing time and the need for specialized equipment (e.g. centrifuges) is a concern. One step to limit the additional processing time is to decrease the initial incubation period of the sample with the Nanotrap particles. As little as 5 minutes of incubation with NT46 captured and enriched Influenza A virus. In addition, magnetic versions of the Nanotrap particles are currently in development in order to improve the Nanotrap recovery process following sample incubation as well as shorten the sample processing time. By incorporating magnetic nanoparticles into the polymeric network of the Nanotrap particles, the Nanotraps can be collected and separated from the biofluid sample via magnetic decantation, thereby negating the need for specialized equipment such as benchtop centrifuges and allowing for the Nanotraps to be used in a resource-limited setting. Using magnetic decantation to separate the particles from the biofluid solution will also decrease the sample processing time by 30-60 minutes, depending on the workflow requirements, thereby allowing target analytes to be captured, recovered, and detected within 30 minutes or less. The second limitation relates to the availability of the affinity baits. In the event that an affinity bait is discontinued by the supplier, this would result in limited supply of the specific Nanotrap type, decreasing the availability of the Nanotrap, and increasing the cost of that Nanotrap type. As a measure to counter this, new affinity baits are being consistently tested to determine if there are any baits that can be substituted to generate a particle with capture and recovery performance to the particles that are in limited supply.",

A volume of 100 mL chloroform was then added to the sample and vortexed for 10 seconds. After a five minute incubation, the samples were centrifuged at 4 C and at a speed of 12,000 \u00a3 g for 15 minutes. The colorless upper aqueous phase (\u00bb200 mL) was removed and saved for downstream analysis. A volume of 50 mL of sample was transferred to a 96-well plate and RNA extraction was performed with Ambion's MagMax 96-well Viral RNA extraction kit according to manufacturer's instructions.",

Samples were processed for qRT-PCR as described in Figure 1. No NT samples (at 100 mL volumes) were processed in parallel. (B) For the nasal wash samples, IA H1N1 was diluted to 1EC05 pfu/mL in 10% human nasal fluid and incubated with NT46 or NT46V. For the nasal swab samples, Influenza A/California/4/2009 was diluted to 1EC06 pfu/mL in 100% human nasal fluid and spiked onto a flocked swab. The swab was swirled in 1 mL PBS, the swab head was cut and placed in a spin basket on top of the microcentrifuge tube containing the sample, and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 5 minutes. The swab head and spin basket were removed, the sample transferred to a new microcentrifuge tube, and 100 mL of NT46 or NT46V was added to each sample. Samples were processed for qRT-PCR as described in Figure 1. No NT samples (at 100 mL volumes) were processed in parallel. Statistical significance for panels A and B were determined through one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey's multiple comparisons test: \u00c3 p-value < 0 .05, \u00c3\u00c3 p-value 0 .01, and \u00c3\u00c3\u00c3 p-value 0 .001. n.s. is not significant.
