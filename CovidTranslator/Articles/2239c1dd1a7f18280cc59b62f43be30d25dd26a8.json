            "text": "Canine distemper virus (CDV) is the cause of a severe and highly contagious disease in dogs. Practical diagnosis of canine distemper based on clinical signs and laboratory tests are required to confirm CDV infection. The present study aimed to develop a molecular assay to detect and differentiate field and vaccine CDV strains. Reverse transcription followed by nested real time polymerase chain reaction (RT-nqPCR) was developed, which exhibited analytical specificity (all the samples from healthy dogs and other canine infectious agents were not incorrectly detected) and sensitivity (all replicates of a vaccine strain were positive up to the 3125-fold dilution -10 0.7 TCID 50 ). RT-nqPCR was validated for CDV detection on different clinical samples (blood, urine, rectal and conjunctival swabs) of 103 animals suspected to have distemper. A total of 53 animals were found to be positive based on RT-nqPCR in at least one clinical sample. Blood resulted in more positive samples (50 out of 53, 94.3%), followed by urine (44/53, 83.0%), rectal (38/53, 71%) and conjunctival (27/53, 50.9%) swabs. A commercial immunochromatography (IC) assay had detected CDV in only 30 conjunctival samples of these positive dogs. Nucleoprotein (NC) gene sequencing of 25 samples demonstrated that 23 of them were closer to other Brazilian field strains and the remaining two to vaccine strains. A single nucleotide sequences difference, which creates an Msp I restriction enzyme digestion, was used to differentiate between field and vaccine CDV strains by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis. The complete assay was more sensitive than was IC for the detection of CDV. Blood was the more frequently positive specimen and the addition of a restriction enzyme step allowed the differentiation of vaccine and Brazilian field strains.",

The viral pathogen, canine distemper virus (CDV), belongs to genus Morbillivirus in the family Paramyxoviridae. Live attenuated vaccines were developed with classical strains (Onderstepoort, Snyder Hill and Rockborn) in the 1950s, which have been used widely to control the disease. Nevertheless, CDV continues to cause severe outbreaks worldwide, mainly in regions with poor vaccine coverage (Martella et al., 2008) . Dogs with CD develop systemic clinical signs few days after infection. These clinical findings are variable, depending on the virulence of the virus strain, environmental conditions, age and immune status of the host. Acutely infected dogs shed the virus in several body secretions, thereby transmitting the virus to other animals (Greene and Appel, 2006) .",

A history of an unvaccinated puppy with depression and anorexia supports a suggestive diagnosis (Greene and Appel, 2006) . However, many dogs lack the classical clinical presentation and/or are infected with other agents that are responsible for similar signs at the time of the first clinical visit to the veterinary, rendering CD diagnostic difficult (Amude et al., 2007) . Some routine laboratorial tests may provide some useful clinical information because CD findings include partial and absolute lymphopenia and body inclusions in the buffy coat cells of conjunctival imprints. However, these tests are not conclusive and do not confirm infection, especially in atypical cases (Greene and Appel, 2006) .",

Virus isolation is fastidious and difficult to perform for routine diagnosis. Immunofluorescence has been the preferred technique up to a few years ago. In 2008, however, an immunochromatography rapid test was developed, which has been used as a routine test because it is fast and user friendly . In addition, different RT-PCR protocols have been developed to sensitive and specific CDV RNA detection in dogs (Frisk et al., 1999; Gebara et al., 2004; Shin et al., 2004; Castilho et al., 2007) . These assays were targeted to the nucleoprotein (NC) gene, which encodes the most abundant structural viral protein and has a highly conserved nucleotide sequence (Yoshida et al., 1998) . Furthermore, three different amplification schemes were described as practical diagnostic tools, as follows: RT-PCR with electrophoresis (Frisk et al., 1999; Calderon et al., 2007; Demeter et al., 2007) , nested RT-PCR with electrophoresis (Shin et al., 2004; J\u00f3zwik and Frymus, 2005; Kapil et al., 2008) and real time RT-PCR (Elia et al., 2006; Scagliarini et al., 2007) .",

These samples were positive controls from other assays (canine coronavirus type I, canine coronavirus type II, canine parvovirus 2, reovirus and rotavirus). No cross-reactivity was observed with any other viruses. Similarly, no detectable fluorescence signal was obtained in the negative controls (negative samples and no template controls), confirming that the assay was specific for the detection of CDV RNA. Reproducibility was assessed in three experiments performed in triplicate on different days.

The whole procedure used primers and probes described previously and involved testing via inclusion assays with field and vaccine strains from different CDV lineages (Frisk et al., 1999; Elia et al., 2006; Castilho et al., 2007) . RT-nqPCR detected all vaccine strains and Brazilian CDV field samples, displaying greater sensitivity than did the \"one-step\" RT-PCR (without a nested amplification). It was also faster than other RT-nested-PCR protocols because of the addition of the probe in the second amplification and \"real time\" analysis. Although the method is based on two amplification rounds, the strategy of using a first round of RT-PCR amplification, with ten cycles, followed by a second round of real-time PCR, with 40 cycles, presented very good linear and reproducible results, similar to another real-time technique described previously (Elia et al., 2006) . A comparison with this developed real time RT-PCR was attempted, although it was not successful because the majority of the positive Brazilian field samples presented with negative results with this procedure (data not shown). In the analysis of the aligned sequences, the comparison between the primers and probe of the previous developed technique and Brazilian NC gene field strains demonstrated four single nucleotide modifications in the sequence of the primers; two in CD-F, at nucleotide positions 918 and 929; and two in CD-R, at nucleotide positions 978 and 983 (Fig. 1) .

            "text": "Conjunctival swab was also a suitable specimen for CDV detection using the RT-nqPCR in the present study, although the number of positive results was lower than with the other samples. Conjunctival swab was previously recommended for CDV detection, mainly for the early diagnosis of CD (Kim et al., 2006) . Another study demonstrated a concordance of 100% between RT-nested-PCR and IC assays using conjunctival swabs. The authors emphasised that this sample was the most suitable specimen for early antemortem diagnosis of CD, most likely because of the persistent shedding of CDV in the eye, unlike in other compartments . Based on these results, a conjunctival swab is the main specimen recommended for testing with the commercial IC assay. In the present study, the comparison between RT-nqPCR and IC assays (when both methods used conjunctival swabs as samples) displayed a high percentage of discordant results (22%) and falsenegative results (13.6%). One possible reason is that the sampled infected dogs were in different stages of the disease. The majority of the positive dogs (64.1%) developed neurologic signs (according to the clinical exam records), which usually start 20 days after infection, when the virus reaches the epithelial tissues and the central nervous system (CNS) (Martella et al., 2008) . Another possibility is that insufficient samples were collected to perform these tests, although the two conjunctival swabs (the first for the IC assay and the second for the RT-nqPCR) were collected carefully from different eyes at the time of clinical examination.",

Twenty of the RT-nqPCR-positive dogs developed the severe form of the disease with neurologic disorders two to three weeks after the clinical examination and were euthanised. In contrast, only twelve of these dogs were positive in the IC assay (data not shown), which means that 40% were false negative results based on the IC assay. The superior performance of nested-RT-PCR over the IC assay has been reported previously . These authors suggested that the IC assay requires large amounts of viral antigens to produce a clear positive result, which could limit the sensitivity of the assay. Because sensitive and rapid detection of the virus can reduce the mortality of the disease and to start appropriate treatment before full signs become evident, the use of a more sensitive test should be chosen when available.",

            "text": "Although the NC gene is highly conserved and a small coding portion was sequenced (only 245 base pairs, excluding the primers), nucleotide polymorphisms were observed among the field and vaccine samples. Interestingly, the nucleotide mutations did not result in any amino acid substitution in all 25 field samples, vaccine strains or other Brazilian strains. However, the few mutations were used to compare all sequences. The great majority of the field CDV nucleotide sequences (23 out of 25) were similar to other Brazilian strains sequenced previously. All were identified in central-nervous-system (CNS) samples collected between 2000 and 2006 from dogs with CD (Castilho et al., 2007; Headley et al., 2009) . Interestingly, two dog samples showed nucleotide sequences similar to the classical strain Lederle used as a vaccine. These dogs were positive according to RT-nqPCR only in the blood samples and did not progress to CD, suggesting they could be circulating live vaccines. Furthermore, the nucleotide sequence differences could be used in RFLP analysis to differentiate vaccine strains from field samples. A similar procedure, using RFLP analysis of the NC gene, was proposed previously to differentiate between vaccine and field strains in China (Wang et al., 2011) . Other studies have proposed RFLP analysis for CDV differentiation, although all of them involved the more variable haemagglutinin (H) gene as the target (Mochizuki et al., 1999; Calderon et al., 2007; Di Francesco et al., 2012) .",

The combination of two primer pairs in a nested format using a universal probe was able to detect both vaccine and field strains of CDV. The RT-nqPCR demonstrated sensitivity and specificity similar to other DNA amplification methods and was more sensitive than a commercial IC assay. The samples that allowed the detection of a greater number of positive samples were blood, followed by urine, rectal and conjunctival swabs. Furthermore, the nucleotide sequence of the NC gene from Brazilian field strains allowed the development of an additional RFLP analysis to differentiate them from vaccine strains. The method described herein should be an important diagnostic tool for the diagnosis of canine distemper.",
