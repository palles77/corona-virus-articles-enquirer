Since it uses the relative distances among local patterns to construct the manifold, it is invariant under the translation, rotation and scale of the pattern coordinate. Many existing manifolds are heavily sensitive to the setting of coordinates and obtain serious unreliable results, for example, the eigenvector system and LLE. This kind of invariance is very useful in many applications. The manually assigned numerical codes for the physical entities of patterns are usually arbitrary and abstract. The absolute values of these codes are meaningless. We expect that the distance between two neighborhood patterns carries rich and reliable meaning. The distance preservation manifold is capable of mapping the whole distribution of very high dimensional patterns to a perceptible space, 2D or 3D.

The number of cells is equals to the number of patterns. The probability density of each pattern is preserved and equal to the density of its cell. The LDI algorithm is a coordinate transformation algorithm. It maps all events (patterns) from the event space (the pattern space) to their corresponding cells in the manifold space. This algorithm accomplishes the coordinate transformation from the pattern space to the manifold space automatically. The LDI is a precise energy for such transformation. There is no manipulation on the probability density function in the construction of the manifold. The ill-posed problem in the Preface in Kohonen's book [13] does not exist in the LDI mani-fold. The LDI manifold has a perfect energy function and bypasses the problem skillfully. Note that the conformal self-organizing map [20] is also devised without this problem.",

It clearly shows that the subprime mortgage mess in July, 2007 is the turning point of the global economy. We list several important events in Table 5 One may apply the manifold technique to interpolate the incomplete data records and extrapolate the predicted states. As for the interpolation of missing data, suppose there are three missing records during certain month. We use all P \u2212 1 available months to construct a manifold with P \u2212 1 cells. These P \u2212 1 cell positions are then fixed. Then, we insert one new cell in the manifold for the incomplete month and train its position using the rest 15 = 18 \u2212 3 records in the vectors, x p , of all P states. Note that the rest P(P \u2212 1)/2 distances are calculated by using the 15 rest records of all P vectors. This inserted cell will converge to a new position and we obtain a fixed manifold with P cells. The distances of those near neighbors of this inserted cell in the manifold can be used as the weights to interpolate the missing three records. By a weighted fitting of these three missing records among the neighbors, one can estimate the missing three records. With the state trend and distances among neighbors, the extrapolation of the predicted state can be accomplished in a similar way.",

The minimum and maximum lengths of the H1N1 sequences are 554 and 567 amino acids respectively. The minimum and maximum lengths of the H5N1 sequences are 552 and 575 amino acids.

We align all H1N1 sequences together. Multiple-sequence alignments were performed using the Clustal W2 program [15] . We compute the Hamming distances between every two sequences.

The path distance between two leaf nodes is the sum of the lengths of the branches along the path connecting these two nodes. According to the construction, the sum of all distances of all node pairs is close to that obtained from the distance matrix. Any path length in the tree should be fitted to its corresponding species relation in the matrix. Based on the LDI manifold, we rewrite the LDI energy for the tree path estimation to fine-tune its branch lengths for the H5N1 tree and SARS tree.",

The performance shows that the LDI algorithm obtains very precise length information for those small distance species. The LDI algorithm is used to construct the phylogenetic tree for the amino acid sequences in the segment one region (PB2) of bird flu, H5N1. The sequences in Influenza Virus Resource [2] are used in the construction. All redundant sequences are removed and will not be used. The tree is constructed for the P = 97 protein sequences of H5N1 recorded from 1997 to 2007 that hosted only on human. There are 4656 = (97 \u00d7 96)/2 distances for all sequence pairs. The lengths of the sequences after performing the multiple-alignment, [6] , are all 770. UPGMA uses the Hamming distances among the aligned sequences to build the tree, see Fig. 11 . The initial branch lengths of the UPGMA tree are obtained by Sattath's method. These lengths are used in the LDI algorithm as the initial setting. The neighborhood region, r , is reduced fromr = 51 to\u0159 = 1 in the algorithm. In Fig. 12 , the performance (12) shows that the LDI algorithm obtains very precise lengths for close species.

They applied phylogenetic analysis for the proteins from known coronaviruses and the predicted proteins produced from SARS-CoV. Marra et al. [24] studied the SARS genome, named Tor2 (AY274119.3), that consists of 29751 base pairs in Genbank. They showed that the SARS virus does not closely resemble any of the three previously known groups of coronaviruses. Figure 13 shows the results of the LDI algorithm.

We divide all 28,680 distances into frequency bins (groups). The length of each bin interval is 0.1. We plot the tabulated frequency in each interval, see Fig. 3. All distances are in the range [0, 4.1). The notation [0, 4.1) means that the interval includes 0 but exclude 4.1. The group which has the highest frequency is in the interval [2.0, 2.1). There are 2,356 distances belong to this interval. The sinusoidal wave induces a small peak in the region [0.4, 1.1). The MDS manifold does not derive the sinusoidal wave. From Fig. 3, the MDS histogram is lack of a peak in the region [0.4, 1.1). MDS obtains the detailed frequency information for large distances, [2, 4.1). The Isomap and C-Isomap obtain distorted histogram informations. The LLE histogram is distorted.4 Experiments on real data4.1 Economic dataData reduction techniques are extensively applied in analyzing the economic states[1,5,18].

This turn shows the trend deviation of the states. Extremely long distances and sharp turns between two successive states indicate the rough situations, such as the large drift during September 2008.
