            "text": "Porcine epidemic diarrhea (PEDV) has raised growing concerns in the pig-breeding industry because it has caused significant economic losses. To better understand the molecular epidemiology and genetic diversity of PEDV field isolates, in this study, the complete spike (S) and ORF3 genes of 17 PEDV variants in Zhejiang, China during 2014 to 2017, were characterized and analyzed. Phylogenetic analysis based on the S gene and ORF3 gene of these 17 novel PEDV strains and PEDV reference strains indicated that all the PEDV strains fell into two groups designated G1 and G2. Notably, the strains identified in 2014-2015 were in G2, while the other five strains identified from 2016 to 2017 were in G1. Sequencing and phylogenetic analyses showed that recently prevalent Chinese PEDV field strains shared higher identities with United States strains than with South Korean strains. Compared with classical vaccine strains, a series of deletions and frequently occurring mutations were observed in the receptor binding domains of our PEDV strains. Besides, we successfully isolated and reported the genetic characterization two novel PEDV strains, PEDV-LA1 and PEDV-LY4-98, found on the Chinese mainland, which had significant variations in the S gene. Meanwhile, the virulence of the new mutants may be changed, the PEDV-LY4-98 strain, which has multiple mutations in the signal peptide-encoding fragment of the S gene showed delayed cytopathic effects and smaller plaque size compared with strain PEDV-LA1, which lacks these mutations. Three unique amino acid substitutions (L7, G8, and V9) were identified in the SP-encoding fragment of the S1 Nterminal domain of the PEDV-LY4-98 S protein compared with the S proteins of all the previous PEDV strains. The animal experiment revealed that these two novel strains were high pathogenic to neonatal pigs. Whether these amino acids substitutions and the N-glycosylation site substitutions influence the antigenicity and pathogenicity of PEDV remains to be investigated. Meanwhile, amino acid substitutions in the neutralizing epitopes may have conferred the capacity for immune evasion in these PEDV field strains. This study improves our understanding of ongoing PEDV outbreaks in China, and it will guide further efforts to develop effective measures to control this virus.",

            "text": "Porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED), which is caused by porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), is an acute, highly contagious, and devastating swine disease that is characterized by enteritis and lethal watery diarrhea that results in dehydration, which frequently leads to high mortality in piglets (Coussement et al., 1982; Wood, 1977) . PED was first reported in Belgium and the United Kingdom in 1978 (Kocherhans et al., 2001; Pensaert and de Bouck, 1978) and then emerged in a number of other European countries. Since 2010, more variant PEDV strains whose sequences differ from that of the classic European strain (CV777) have appeared recently in many Asian countries, including China Li et al., 2012a; Pan et al., 2012; Song et al., 2015; Sun et al., 2015) , South Korea, Japan, and Vietnam (Lee et al., 2010; Park et al., 2011) . PEDV was first identified in the 1980 s in China, and since then, PED outbreaks have increased markedly and spread rapidly across countries. In October 2010, a largescale outbreak of PED caused by a PEDV variant occurred in China, resulting in tremendous economic losses. New outbreaks associated with a novel PEDV strain that is genetically distant from the prototype PEDV strain, CV777, have been reported in China Li et al., 2012a, b) . PED is recognized worldwide for the dramatic changes observed in its epidemic character and pathogenic molecules. Since its initial recognition in May 2013, PEDV has rapidly spread across the United States (U.S.), resulting in high mortality in piglets in more than 17 states to date (Chen et al., 2014; Huang et al., 2013; Pasma et al., 2016) .",

            "text": "The PEDV S protein is a key factor that mediates the entry of PEDV into host cells by binding to aminopeptidase N and/or glycan receptors through an unknown mechanism, thereby initiating the fusion of the virus envelope with the host cell membrane and the subsequent infection cycle (He et al., 2005; Ye et al., 2015) . Thus, the S glycoprotein is the primary target for the development of vaccines against PEDV, as well as for understanding the genetic relationships between different strains and the epidemiological status of PEDV in the field. The PEDV S protein is a type I glycoprotein that consists of three segments -an ectodomain, a single-pass transmembrane anchor, and a short intracellular tail (Li, 2012) . The ectodomain is often cleaved into a receptor-binding S1 subunit and a membrane-fusion S2 subunit, and the amino acid sequences of S1 subunits diverge across different genera, but are relatively conserved within each genus (Deng et al., 2016; Zheng et al., 2006) . S1 can recognize a variety of host receptors, including proteins and sugars (Makadiya et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2016) . induce most of the host immune responses, and may serve as subunit vaccines against coronavirus infections. The S protein is also the major envelope glycoprotein, contains four neutralizing epitopes named COE, SS2, SS6, and 2C10, and the regions of the aligned sequences that correspond to these regions are amino acids 499-638, 748-755, 764-771, and 1368 499-638, 748-755, 764-771, and -1374 499-638, 748-755, 764-771, and (Chang et al., 2002 Li, 2015; Sun et al., 2008) . Mutations, deletions and/or insertions in the S protein may change the pathogenicity and antigenicity. A previous report suggested that a field CHN/FL2013 strain with a 7 aa-earlier termination of S protein showed reduced virulence in cell culture . Park et al. reported that Korean strain MF3809/2008 was identified with a large deletion (204 aa) at amino acid positions 713-916 of the S protein reduced its virulence and changed its tissue tropism from intestinal (Park et al., 2014) . The highly virulent PEDV strains from China had an increased number of substitutions within the S1 domain compared with the highly virulent American strains, probably due to the longer circulation time of PEDV in pigs in China. N terminal domain. bioinformatics predicted that the S protein of highly virulent PEDV strains changed in primary/secondary structures, high-specificity Nglycosylation sites, potential phosphorylation sites, and palmitoylation sites (Chiou et al., 2017; Hao et al., 2014) These changes may affect viral antigenicity and change viral neutralizing activity. In recent years, new S mutant strains have been constantly found and this may be related to the immune pressure of the vaccines that are used, including those from vaccine strains CV777 and DR13.",

However, piglets inoculated with strain KPEDV-9, which was serially passaged in Vero cells, showed reduced disease and fewer lesions (Kweon et al., 1999) .

The phylogenetic analysis also showed that these four isolates all fell into genogroup G2b, whereas the others fell into other groups (data not shown). These unique amino acids can potentially serve as genetic markers to discriminate U.S. strains from other strains. Interestingly, a sequence alignment analysis of S1 (one subunit of the S protein) showed that a total of 42 unique amino acid changes were found between the PEDV-LY5-101, PEDV-LY5-107, PEDV-LY5-109, and PEDV-LY5-113 strains and the CV777 strain.

Strains PEDV-LY2-39, PEDV-LY2-46, and PEDV-LY2-51 share two additional unique amino acids (N117 and V152) with the other isolates and the CV777 strain. In particular, compared with the CV777 strain, the 12 variant strains shared a 4-amino acid insertion at positions 59-62, a 1-amino acid insertion at position 140, and a 2-amino acid deletion at positions 163 and 164 of the S protein. Three unique amino acid substitutions (L7, G8, and V9) were identified in the SP-encoding fragment of the S1 Nterminal domain of the PEDV-LY4-98 S protein compared with the S proteins of all the previous PEDV strains (data not shown). The first 18 amino acids in the S protein constitute a signal peptide-encoding fragment (SP), which contributes to viral protein release.

A previous study also reported that the Chinese AH2012 strain was possibly transmitted to the eastern China regions and then transported to the United States. However, the exact source of the origin is difficult to identify at this point . Basing on the sequence and phylogenetic analysis, both two Chinese strains, PEDV-LYG and XM-2-4, which were identified from two adjacent provinces to Zhejiang Province, together with United States strains and AH2012 strain, are most closely related to the PEDV-LY4-98 strain. The data suggested that AH2012-related PEDV has probably spread into this area in China. Taken together, the available sequence and phylogenetic data strengthen that the PEDV circulating in China and the US have at least a possible common ancestor. Moreover, The information presented in this study provided new evidence for the ongoing spread of AH2012related PEDV in Zhejiang Province. Besides, the finding that the novel PEDV strains in our study share unique genetic features compared with the highly virulent American strains, probably due to the immune pressure of the vaccines or longer circulation time of PEDV in pigs in China. Thus, urgent action is needed to prevent the continued transmission of this virus, including the development of novel vaccines for prevention.",

Compared with classical and vaccine strains, a series of amino acid insertions and mutations in the S gene may play an important role in the pathogenicity and antigenicity of the new PEDV variants. Both cell culture and plaque assay studies confirmed this view. The antigenicity analysis of the S gene showed that the four neutralizing epitopes (COE, SS2, SS6, and 2C10) share unique genetic features compared with the CV777 strain. A previous study report showed that five highly virulent PEDV strains (JY5C, JY6C, JY7C, YJ3 F, and YJ7C) detected in Gansu Province, China had eight mutations (A517S, S523 G, V527I, T549S, G594S, A605E, L612 F, and I635 V) in the neutralizing epitope COE (Lin et al., 2016) , these similar mutations were also found in the PEDV-LY4-98 strain and the United States strains, but not present in South Korean strains. A two-aminoacid substitution (N58 and S59) was found in the S1 N-terminal domain, and this mutation completely eliminated a potential N-glycosylation site that was present in the S proteins of the other strains. Moreover, three unique amino acid substitutions (L7, G8, and V9) were identified in the SP-encoding fragment of the S1 N-terminal domain of the PEDV-LY4-98 S protein compared with the S proteins of all the PEDV reference strains. Whether these amino acids substitutions and Fig. 2 . Virus isolation and detection in Vero E6 cells. (A) Cytopathic effects (CPEs) caused by PEDV isolates. Vero E6 cells were seeded into T-25 flasks and infected at an MOI of 0.1 with PEDV-HF-90 and PEDV-LY5-101, respectively. CPE was monitored every 12 h. Pictures were taken at 12 h, 24 h, 36 h and 48 h post-infection. (B) Plaque morphology of PEDV isolates in our study. An agarose overlay plaque assay was performed in monolayer Vero E6 cells. Viral plaques were developed at day 4 postinfection. The cells were fixed in 10% formaldehyde, and the plaques were visualized by staining with crystal violet. (C) Viral replication kinetics in Vero-E6 cells. Vero-E6 cells in 35-mm dishes were infected with each PEDV isolate at an MOI of 0.1. After adsorption for 1 h, the inoculum was removed, and the infected cells were washed three times with Opti-MEM. Then, fresh Opti-MEM containing 2% FBS was added, and cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C for various time periods. Aliquots of the cell culture fluid were removed at the indicated intervals. Viral titer was determined by TCID50 assay inVero-E6 cells.",

In recent years, new S mutant strains have been constantly found and this may be related to the immune pressure of the vaccines that are used, including those from vaccine strains CV777 and DR13. Meanwhile, the virulence of the new mutants may be changed, and amino acid substitutions in the neutralizing epitopes may have conferred the capacity for immune evasion in these PEDV field strains. The monitoring of PEDV variations will be useful in the control and prevention of PED. However, the exact origins of our PEDV strains are difficult to identify at this point. The information presented in this study will guide current control measures designed to stop the ongoing spread of PEDV, and it will also provide important clues for the development of an effective vaccine against emergent PEDV strains.",
