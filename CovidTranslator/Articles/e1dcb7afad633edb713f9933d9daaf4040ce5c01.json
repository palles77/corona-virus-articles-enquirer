Up to now, although few complete nucleotide sequences of PHEV have been reported, they are not annotated. This study aimed to illuminate genome characterization, phylogenesis and pathogenicity of the PHEV/2008 strain. The full length of the PHEV/2008 strain genome was 30,684 bp, with a G + C content of 37.27%. The genome included at a minimum of 11 predicted open reading frames (ORFs) flanked by 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 untranslated regions (UTR) of 211 and 289 nucleotides. The replicase polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab, which had 4382 and 7094 amino acid residues, respectively, were predicted to be cleaved into 16 subunits by two viral proteinases. Phylogenetic analysis based on the complete genome sequence revealed that PHEV/2008 strain was genetically different from other known PHEV types, which represented a novel genotype (GI-1). In addition, we found that PHEV/2008 was neurotropic and highly pathogenic to 4-week-old BALB/c mice. Taken together, this is the first detailed annotated, complete genomic sequence of a new genotype PHEV strain in China.",

It was first isolated as early as the 1960s as the causative agents of encephalomyelitis and/or vomiting and wasting disease (VMD) in piglets [4, 5] . PHEV is a highly neurotropic virus that invades the CNS, causing neurological dysfunction in susceptible animals, including pigs, mice, and rats [6] [7] [8] . The clinical signs of PHEV infected pigs are greatly different, from subclinical symptoms to death. In young piglets, especially under 3 weeks of age, as well as other susceptible species, PHEV infection is often fatal because of the central nervous system disorders. The mortality rate is almost 100%. In contrast, older pigs generally have no obvious symptoms [9] . To date, there has been no vaccine or any treatment measures.",

The result indicated 2 different clusters, referred to as genotype I (GI-1 to GI-2) and genotype II (GII-1 to GII-3). Our two isolates were clustered together and clearly set apart from PHEV-VW572 strain (Fig. 1b) in the phylogenetic tree.

The G + C content is 37.27 and 37.29%, which has high similarity to values reported for other coronaviruses (37-42%) ( Table 2 ) [18] . The complete genome sequences of the two PHEV isolates showed a typical coronavirus gene order 5\u2032-UTR, replicase, HE, S, E, M, N, and UTR-3\u2032. Further analysis revealed that our two isolates contain deletions/insertions in different genes. Compared with PHEV-VW572, two strains contain a 3-nt deletion (GTT) in the ORF 1a at positions 325-327, leading to a single amino acid deletion (V, Val). The NS2 genes of two strains are 702 nt in length, encoding two 203 amino acid proteins, which are 9 aa longer than that of VW-572. In the case of NS4.9 genes, 12 nt deletion were identified in the two isolates, which was reported in 2 Canadian PHEV strains (IAF-404 and 67N) previously. Overall, genome characterization and phylogenetic analysis revealed that our two isolates are novel PHEV variants.",

HE presents in only a subset of betacoronaviruses and influenza C virus. The HE protein, which may be functionally similar to the S protein, has high homology to that of influenza C virus [21] . It The replicase gen consists of two ORFs, replicase 1a and replicase 1b, which are expressed by a ribosomal frameshifting mechanism. The expand region below shows the downstream ORFs of the genome. The sizes and positions of accessory genes (NS2, NS4.9, NS12.7, and N2) are indicated, relative to the basic genes HE, S, E, M, and N was supposed that the ancestors of the betacoronaviruses acquired HE by the means of gene recombination when infected a same host cell with influenza virus. Homologies of the deduced amino acid sequences of HE proteins between PHEV/2008 and other betacoronaviruses have 41-90% amino acid identities ( Table 2 ). The results of PFAM analysis revealed that amino acid residues 2-378 of HE protein form a member of the HE family with an accession number PF03996. Prediction of signal peptide in the N-terminal 70 amino acids was performed using SignalP, revealing that a signal peptide with a cleavage site between positions 18 and 19 is present (D = 0.654; D-cutoff = 0.450). TMHMM analysis revealed that a transmembrane domain is located in 392-414. The putative receptor-binding (aa 140-283) and receptor-destroying sialate O-acetylesterase (acetylesterase; aa 25-139 and 284-341) domains of PHEV/2008 HE protein were identified by multi-alignment with other group 2a coronaviruses (Fig. 4) . Previous experiments have been demonstrated that, in BCoV, HE protein is required for viral replication, however, it is not necessary and sufficient for viral infection [22] . ORF 4 (base pairs 23,643-27,692) encode the putative S glycoprotein with 1349 amino acids in length (PFAM accession no. PF01601). The amino acid identities of S glycoprotein between PHEV/2008 and other betacoronaviruses are 27-81%, however, less than 23% with non-betacoronaviruses ( Table 2 ). Percentage identities between the deduced amino acid sequences of the PHEV/2008 and BCoV main structural proteins revealed that the S protein to be less conserved (81.13%) than the HE (90.09%), E (97.62%), M (93.48%), and N (95.32%) protein. It could be hypothesized that divergences of the S protein are related to tissue tropism. SignalP analysis showed that a signal peptide is present with a cleavage site between amino acid residues 14 and 15 (D = 0.769 D-cutoff = 0.450). TMHMM analysis of this predicted protein showed only one transmembrane domain at positions 1294-1316. On this basis, we concluded that most of the S protein (residues 1-1293) is located outside of the virus. The S protein is cleaved into two subunits (S1 Fig. 3 Replicase gene and protein products of PHEV/2008. a Polyprotein pp1a and pp1b processing scheme for PHEV/2008.

The S1 subunit is expected to contain a receptor-binding domain which plays a crucial role in the stage of virus attachment to host cell surface receptors. The S2 subunit is predicted to mediate fusion of the viral and cellular membranes. Two heptad repeats (HR), which is located at residues 977-1088 (HR1) and 1245-1290 (HR2), were identified in the PHEV S2 subunit (Fig. 4) .",

The RNA binging domain is located at two ends of the N protein, designated the N-terminal domain (NTD) and the C-terminal domain (CTD). Flanking the RNA-binding domains are three spacer segments, domain N1a at the hydroxy terminus, spacer B and domain N3 at the carboxy terminus, and domain N2a which contains a serine-and arginine-rich region (SR) at the center of the N molecule (Fig. 4) . Besides, the N protein also binds to the M protein to promote assembly and budding, and plays a part in coronaviruses replication.",

Nucleotide sequences are less well conserved in this region among coronaviruses; however, we also found two conserved structures. The first is an octanucleotide motif, 5\u2032-GGG AGA GC-3\u2032, which is nearly conserved in all coronaviruses. The other structure is a minimal signal that is required for initiation of negative-strand RNA synthesis, for MHV, it is located within the final 55 nucleotides (nt) of the 3\u2032 UTR [26] .",

Decreases in body weight and temperature were in accord with the clinical symptoms. In the control group, no obvious clinical signs were observed and no mice died throughout the experimental period. However, mild to moderate neurological signs, such as bristle coat, hunched back, swing arms and paralysis were observed between 3 and 7 days in mice infected with PHEV/2008. All PHEV-infected mice died in the end of the experiment, implicating that PHEV/2008 is highly pathogenic in mice (Fig. 5b ). In addition, pathological changes were observed in brain of the PHEV-infected mice on 5th day. A large number of mononuclear cells gathered in perivascular and formed perivascular cuffing in the cerebral parenchyma (Fig. 5d) . A vascular oedema was observed and the peripheral space had become enlarged (Fig. 5e) . Hemorrhage was also found and red blood cells infiltrated into the brain parenchyma (Fig. 5f ).

The results of genomic analysis revealed that PHEV/2008 is a lineage A of the genus betacoronavirus, with the typical gene order 5\u2032-UTR, replicase, HE, S, E, M, N, and UTR-3\u2032. The first ORF (ORF1a/b) encodes replicase proteins, usually referred to as pp1a and pp1ab, respectively, and comprises approximately two-thirds of the genome. The translation of ORF1ab involves \u2212 1 ribosomal frame shifting in order to synthesis polyproteins pp1ab. During or after synthesis, 1 3 these polyproteins are cleaved at different specific enzyme sites by virus-encoded proteinases into 16 proteins. That is, nsp1 to nsp11 are encoded in ORF1a, nsp12 to nsp16 are encoded in ORF1b, and nsp11 is generated only when ribosomal frameshifting does not occur [27] . The ORF3, ORF4, ORF7, ORF8, and ORF9a are predicted to encode the five main structure proteins, HE, S, E, M, and N proteins, respectively. Translation of these genes is different from ORF1ab which translated from genomic mRNA, while these main structure protein genes are translated from subgenomic mRNAs (sgRNAs). The sgRNAs was consist of common 5\u2032 leader sequences and variable \"body\" parts. It is assumed that the leader-to-body fusion event involves in the mechanism of discontinuous negative-strand RNA synthesis [28] . Both genomic RNA and sgRNAs are synthesized through negative-strand intermediates which possess 5\u2032 oligouridylate tracts and 3\u2032 antileaders.",
