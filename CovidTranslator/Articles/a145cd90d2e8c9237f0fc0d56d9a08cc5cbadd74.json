A round opacity in adults is suspicious for malignancy, whereas in children it is likely to represent a benign process [2] . In a child with symptoms and signs of pneumonia and a round opacity on the chest radiographs, the diagnosis is most likely round pneumonia. However, one has to be aware of other pathologies that can present a similar imaging appearance in children [3] . In this essay, we discuss the etiology and clinical and radiographic features of round pneumonia, as well as its less common mimickers. Awareness of radiographic mimickers can prevent diagnostic pitfalls, unnecessary tests and radiation, as well as assist in improving patient care.",

The mean age was 5 years. Older children are less susceptible to round pneumonia because they have more developed pathways of collateral ventilation and larger alveoli. When a round opacity is seen in older age groups, atypical microorganisms, immunodeficiencies, underlying lesions and other rare etiologies, such as a primary malignancy, must be considered. alveolar sacs. These structures function as collateral circulation and allow the passage of fluid or bacteria. With developed collaterals, the infection can spread easily into adjacent alveolar sacs and throughout the lobe. With less developed collaterals, there is centrifugal spread, and the consolidation is spherical with sharp margins. These factors result a slow progression of the disease and a higher chance of detecting the infection in children. There is a preferential posterior and lower lobe distribution of round pneumonia, likely resulting from gravity and a supine position while sleeping [4, 5] .",

This has implications in treatment, as these are more commonly seen in immunocompromised children. Some of these agents present as multifocal, round pulmonary lesions on radiographs. Kosut et al. [13] and Shetty et al. [14] reported cases of round pneumonias in patients with chronic granulomatous disease. The case reported by Kosut was that of a newborn with multilobar round pneumonias. The age of the patient and the multilobar presentation were unusual for the typical round pneumonia. The etiology in this case was Aspergillus. The case reported by Shetty was that of a 15-year-old, also an unusual age for typical round pneumonia. The etiology in this case was Nocardia.",

Tuberculosis can present as any type of parenchymal opacity, such as round (Fig. 7) , patchy, linear or mass-like. Ghon complex (a.k.a. Ranke complex) refers to the parenchymal lesion of primary pulmonary tuberculosis associated with a corresponding lymph node. Even though the primary complex of tuberculosis can involve any part of the lung, the middle lobe is the least involved [18] . Radiologists must look carefully for adenopathy, a distinguishing feature that is very common in pediatric tuberculosis. The right hilum is more commonly involved because of the pattern of lymphatic circulation through the lungs. A right-side parenchymal lesion leads to right hilar adenopathy.

Multifocal adenopathy was also present, though not in the mediastinum (not shown). Pathological diagnosis of lymphoma was made after cervical surgical lymph node resection sequestrations have a systemic arterial supply [26] . CPAM, sequestrations and congenital lobar hyperinflation can appear as round opacities on chest radiographs on a newborn due to the lack of focal reabsorption of the parenchymal fluid within the lesion. In this period, age is a differentiating feature, as round pneumonias and even lobar pneumonias are exceedingly rare in the first few months of life.

Small hernias can also present as a solitary pulmonary nodule [32] . The presence of air-fluid-containing structures, such as bowel or very sharp margins, can help distinguish against round pneumonia. The fluid-filled or collapsed bowel loops within the hemithorax have a homogeneously opaque appearance. Less commonly, bowel becomes entrapped in a small hernia, producing a large pleural effusion. Sonography can be useful in rendering a diagnosis [33] .",

In a child younger than 8 years of age with clinical symptoms and signs of pneumonia and a typical radiographic appearance, the diagnosis is almost always round pneumonia. This is different from adult imaging, in which malignant processes predominate. With appropriate antibiotic therapy, a followup frontal radiograph to ensure improvement or resolution can confirm the round pneumonia diagnosis. In a child with clinical symptoms and signs of pneumonia, even if the round opacity has atypical features on chest radiographs, round pneumonia is still the likely diagnosis. One needs to recognize the clinical scenario and the mimics of round pneumonia. Although uncommon, knowledge of these red herrings in imaging, although uncommon can help to avoid misdiagnosis and optimize further imaging and investigations as necessary for cost-effective patient care.
