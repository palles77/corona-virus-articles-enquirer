We reveal that mammalian cells respond to this widespread cytoplasmic mRNA decay by altering RNA Polymerase II (RNAPII) transcription in the nucleus. Measuring RNAPII recruitment to promoters and nascent mRNA synthesis revealed that the majority of affected genes are transcriptionally repressed in SOX-expressing cells. The transcriptional feedback does not occur in response to the initial viral endonuclease-induced cleavage, but instead to degradation of the cleaved fragments by cellular exonucleases.

Furthermore, how enhanced mRNA degradation might signal through such a feedback loop is an open question and one that is difficult to address through mutant studies. In this regard, several mammalian viruses rapidly accelerate cytoplasmic mRNA degradation through the combined activity of virally encoded mRNA-targeting endonucleases and mammalian Xrn1 and thus could provide insight into these questions (Gaglia et al., 2012) . Members of the alpha-and gamma-herpesvirus subfamilies, as well as influenza A virus (IAV) and SARS coronavirus (SCoV), all encode viral proteins that target mRNAs for endonucleolytic cleavage (Glaunsinger and Ganem, 2004; Jagger et al., 2012; Kamitani et al., 2009; Kwong and Frenkel, 1987; Rowe et al., 2007) . Though the viral proteins are not homologous, in all examined cases they bypass the rate-limiting deadenylation and decapping events by inducing internal cleavages in cytoplasmic mRNA, and then rely on the cellular mRNA decay machinery to degrade the cleaved mRNA fragments. For the alpha-and gamma-herpesviruses and SCoV, clearance of cleaved mRNAs requires Xrn1 Gaglia et al., 2012) .",

However, contrary to what might be predicted based on observations in S. cerevisiae, we find that enhancing mRNA degradation leads predominantly to a decrease in RNAPII activity on cellular genes, although a subset of genes are transcriptionally upregulated. We show a central role for cellular exonucleases including Xrn1 in this repression, indicating that Xrn1-linked transcriptional regulation is a feature conserved between S. cerevisiae and mammals. Furthermore, our findings support the conclusion that it is the act of mRNA degradation by cellular nucleases that is sensed and triggers transcriptional alterations, rather than secondary effects from stabilization of mRNAs encoding transcriptional regulators. Interestingly, viral transcription, which is also mediated by RNAPII, largely escapes transcriptional repression.",

            "text": "Infection with murine gamma-herpesvirus 68 (MHV68) leads to widespread acceleration of mRNA decay in the cytoplasm that is initiated by mRNA cleavage by the viral endoribonuclease mu-SOX and completed by degradation of the cleaved fragments by the cellular 5 0 -3 0 exoribonuclease Xrn1 (Covarrubias et al., 2009; Gaglia et al., 2012) . A point mutation in the muSOX gene at position R443 (R443I; DHS) renders it defective for cleaving cytoplasmic RNAs, and thus infection with the DHS virus does not broadly increase mRNA decay (Richner et al., 2011) . We therefore queried how infection of NIH 3T3 cells with WT MHV68 versus the DHS mutant impacted rates of cellular mRNA transcription as measured by 4-thiouridine (4sU) pulse labeling. Just prior to harvesting, mock-infected or infected cells were incubated for 30 min with 4sU, which gets incorporated into actively transcribing mRNAs and can be subsequently coupled to HPDP-biotin and purified over magnetic streptavidin beads. Quantification by RT-qPCR of the housekeeping genes Gapdh, Rpl37, and ActB from purified 4sU-labeled RNA showed a significant transcriptional reduction during MHV68 infection compared to mock-infected cells ( Figure 1A ). No reduction in transcription was detected in cells infected with the DHS point mutant virus, suggesting that the transcriptional suppression observed during WT MHV68 infection was specifically linked to enhanced cytoplasmic mRNA decay ( Figure 1A ). We detected robust transcriptional activation during both MHV68 WT and DHS infection of the interferon-stimulated gene IFIH1 (Liu et al., 2012) , indicating the 4sU assay accurately portrays transcription changes. We applied several tests to confirm that the abundance of 4sU-containing mRNA reflected nascent transcription rather than decay rates in the cytoplasm. First, we showed that 4sU-labeled mRNA remained largely confined to the nucleus at the time of harvest ( Figure 1B) . Second, we also quantified the 4sU-labeled RNA using primers within intronic sequences, confirming that the transcriptional repression was observed for pre-mRNA ( Figure 1C ). Finally, we observed similar transcriptional repression when applying only a 5-min 4sU pulse, and normalizing each sample to the number of cells harvested after 4sU addition confirmed nascent RNA levels are altered only during a WT infection (Figures S1A and S1B).",

Similar to our results in infected cells, 4sU labeling showed a reduction of transcription of the housekeeping genes Gapdh, ActB, GusB, and eEF-1a in cells expressing muSOX or vhs, but not in cells expressing the muSOX D219A mutant ( Figure 1D ). We also measured RNAPII occupancy at cellular promoters by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays and, in agreement with our 4sU labeling, observed a reduction in RNAPII occupancy in cells expressing vhs or muSOX but not muSOX D219A ( Figure 1E ). Finally, we performed a similar set of experiments with the human gamma-herpesvirus Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV). KSHV encodes a SOX gene that functions in a manner analogous to MHV68 muSOX (Covarrubias et al., 2009; Glaunsinger and Ganem, 2004) . We engineered a P176S point mutation in the KSHV SOX gene, which, similar to the MHV68 DHS mutant, confers a specific mRNA degradation defect (Glaunsinger et al., 2005) . We monitored mRNA degradationinduced transcriptional changes during the lytic KSHV replication cycle using iSLK renal carcinoma cells, which harbor a doxycycline (dox)-inducible version of the major lytic cycle transactivator RTA and can be stimulated to replicate the virus upon treatment with dox and sodium butyrate (Myoung and Ganem, 2011) . Measurement of transcription rates 48 hr post-lytic reactivation by 4sU labeling showed a specific transcriptional repression of the housekeeping genes Gapdh, ActB, GusB, and eEF-1a in cells containing WT KSHV but not the P176S mutant (Figure 1F) . Collectively, these data suggest that virus-induced cytoplasmic mRNA degradation induces RNAPII transcriptional repression.",

Given that Xrn1 degrades the mRNA fragments cleaved by the viral endonucleases, we reasoned that Xrn1 activity might be involved in the transcriptional response to mRNA degradation in mammalian cells. We generated HEK293T cells stably expressing dox-inducible Xrn1-targeting shRNAs. After Xrn1 knockdown by dox treatment for 4 days, the cells were transfected with plasmids expressing either WT or D219A muSOX, and RNAPII promoter occupancy was measured by ChIP. In control cells not treated with dox, we observed the expected reduced RNAPII occupancy at the Gapdh promoter in the presence of WT muSOX, but not the D219A catalytic mutant ( Figure 2A ). However, Xrn1 knockdown restored RNAPII occupancy at the Gapdh promoter in cells expressing muSOX to levels observed in cells expressing D219A. Importantly, in these experiments mRNAs are cleaved by muSOX regardless of Xrn1 levels. Furthermore, knockdown of Xrn1 in control cells lacking viral nuclease did not result in transcriptional changes by RNAPII ChIP at two cellular promoters ( Figure 2B ). Thus, it can be concluded that differences in transcription result from a mechanism to sense accelerated mRNA degradation, rather than secondary effects stemming from altered stability of mRNAs encoding transcriptional regulators.",

Although Xrn1 is the only mammalian exonuclease characterized as involved in the degradation of muSOX-cleaved mRNAs, it is likely that 3 0 -5 0 exonucleases also help degrade the cleavage fragments. Similar to the results with Xrn1, depletion of Dis3L2 restored RNAPII occupancy in muSOX-expressing cells to those of control cells (Figure 2C) . No effect of Dis3L2 knockdown on RNAPII promoter recruitment was observed in the absence of the viral nuclease ( Figure 2D ). Finally, although knockdown of Ccr4 alone did not impact the reduction of RNAPII promoter occupancy in muSOX-expressing cells, co-depletion of both Ccr4 and Pan2 restored RNAPII occupancy at the Gapdh promoter ( Figure 2E ). Unlike our results with Xrn1 and Dis3L2, knockdown of the deadenylases led to an increase in RNAPII promoter occupancy even in the absence of muSOX ( Figure 2F ), suggesting that in uninfected cells, alterations in deadenylase activity are monitored and drive transcriptional feedback. These data indicate that multiple cellular exonucleases contribute to transcriptional feedback in mammalian cells. Furthermore, in the cases of Xrn1 and Dis3L2, it is their enhanced activity in the presence of widespread mRNA cleavage during infection that is sensed, rather than indirect effects stemming from altered basal mRNA decay.",

Although transiently expressed Xrn1 appears to be exclusively cytoplasmic (unpublished data), we observed endogenous Xrn1 in both the nucleus and cytoplasm in NIH 3T3 cells ( Figure S2A ). The IFA signal was specific for Xrn1, as pre-treatment of the cells with Xrn1-targeting siRNAs significantly decreased the staining in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm ( Figure S2A ). However, the nuclear-cytoplasmic distribution of Xrn1 was not altered during infection with WT MHV68 or the DHS mutant ( Figures S2B and S2C ). We were also unable to detect enrichment of Xrn1 at transcriptionally impacted cellular promoters in ChIP assays (data not shown).

Independent validations of 4sU-labeled mRNA levels by RT-qPCR confirmed the sequencing results for 12 out of 19 genes tested (Figures S3A and S3B ). The seven genes in which the two assays were not in agreement showed transcriptional repression by RT-qPCR but not by 4sU-seq, perhaps suggesting that the 4sU-seq represents a conservative estimation of the breadth of degradation-induced transcriptional alterations. Significantly fewer genes (3.18%) were decreased during DHS MHV68 infection, indicating that the majority of changes in the WT-infected cells were linked to mRNA degradation. Among the set of transcriptionally repressed genes during WT infection, 374 were categorized as statistically significant based on read counts and fold change. In contrast, only 38 genes were significantly reduced during a DHS infection, and among these, 32 overlapped with those in the WT infection samples. Thus, these overlapping genes are likely downregulated as a result of viral infection and are not specific to mRNA degradation ( Figure 4C ).",

Unlike during WT infection, where transcriptional changes were more frequently repressive, the transcriptional changes that occurred during DHS infection were equally split between induced and repressed categories (3.19% versus 3.18%, respectively). In addition to the set of transcriptionally repressed genes, we also observed a subset of genes (6.87%) that showed a R 1.5-fold increase upon WT MHV68 infection ( Figure 4B ). Furthermore, a larger fraction of the significantly transcriptionally induced genes during a WT infection overlapped with those induced during DHS infection (32.6% of induced genes compared to 8.6% of reduced genes), suggesting that upregulation is less likely to be linked to mRNA degradation and more likely to be linked to viral infection ( Figure 4C) . Notably, among the set of 85 genes whose transcriptional induction was common to both WT and DHS infection, GO-term analyses returned a clear enrichment for genes involved in antiviral defense mechanisms and in nucleotide binding ( Figure 4D ). Although the significance of the latter remains to be determined, the induction of antiviral response factors would be a predicted transcriptional response to infection, independent of mRNA degradation.

We therefore analyzed the transcriptional changes that occurred at each of the viral genes in response to mRNA degradation during WT MHV68 infection relative to DHS infection using the 4sU-seq dataset. Interestingly, viral genes largely escaped the transcriptional repression ( Figure 5A ). Independent validation experiments confirmed that even genes that appeared to undergo modest transcriptional repression during WT infection by 4sU-seq were unchanged or even slightly upregulated as measured by RT-qPCR of 4sU-labeled mRNA ( Figure 5B ). In agreement with the 4sU-based transcriptional measurements, we observed no differences in RNAPII occupancy at the M1 and ORF8 viral genes ( Figure 5C) post-reactivation of WT or P176S KSHVcontaining iSLK cells. Similar to the data for MHV68, each of the KSHV genes examined by RT-qPCR following 4sU labeling either exhibited no transcriptional changes or were modestly transcriptionally induced during WT relative to P176S KSHV lytic infection ( Figure 5D ). We conclude that viral transcription is not negatively impacted (and in some cases is enhanced) by accelerated cytoplasmic mRNA degradation, and thus the transcriptional impact of mRNA decay may be distinct for the virus versus the host.",

            "text": "Although the majority of MHV68 genes are susceptible to muSOX cleavage during infection, several viral transcripts appear to escape muSOX-mediated degradation (Abernathy et al., 2014) . Two of these putative ''escapees,'' the viral ORF M1 (an RNAPII transcript) and the viral tRNA-like gene vtRNA1 (an RNAPIII transcript), exhibit enhanced steady-state expression during WT relative to DHS infection, perhaps due to increased transcription (Abernathy et al., 2014) . To test whether muSOX-induced transcriptional feedback was responsible for their increased abundance during WT infection, we first confirmed that the M1 and vtRNA1 half-lives were not altered during a WT versus DHS infection ( Figure 6A ). We then evaluated whether the transcriptional enhancement of these viral genes during WT MHV68 infection was linked to Xrn1 activity using the HEK293T cells expressing dox-inducible Xrn1-targeting shRNAs. Upon Xrn1 knockdown, M1 expression was significantly reduced during WT but not DHS MHV68 infection, and its expression was restored upon introduction of exogenous WT Xrn1 ( Figure 6B ). The requirement for Xrn1 appeared specific for RNAPII-driven transcription, as its depletion had no significant impact on expression of the RNAPIII-transcribed vtRNA1 ( Figure 6C ). RNAPII ChIP experiments confirmed that the reduction in M1 mRNA in the absence of Xrn1 was due to transcriptional repression ( Figure 6D ). We also observed reduced RNAPII occupancy upon Xrn1 depletion at ORF54, an MHV68 gene that is susceptible to cleavage by muSOX (Abernathy et al., 2014) , indicating that the role of Xrn1 in promoting viral transcription is not limited to transcripts that escape degradation ( Figure 6D ). In each of these experiments, the requirement for Xrn1 was only observed during WT infection and not during infection with the DHS virus. We did not detect any binding of Xrn1 to viral promoters by ChIP (data not shown), suggesting that it likely indirectly impacts viral transcription in cells undergoing enhanced mRNA decay. Finally, depletion of the Ccr4 deadenylase did not alter M1 transcription during a WT or DHS infection, in agreement with its dispensability for the repression of cellular transcription when depleted in isolation ( Figure 6E ). Collectively, these data demonstrate that in contrast to its role in transcriptional repression of many cellular genes, Xrn1 activity during muSOX-induced cytoplasmic mRNA decay is required for robust transcription of viral genes.",

Conversely, an RNAPII mutant that exhibits 3-fold-reduced mRNA synthesis rates displays decreased rates of mRNA turnover in the cytoplasm (Sun et al., 2012) . Our data indicate that mammalian cells also possess a mechanism to sense overall mRNA abundance. However, accelerated cytoplasmic mRNA degradation in mammalian cells induces transcriptional alterations that are distinct from this buffering phenotype, in that the majority of mRNA degradation-induced changes involved transcriptional repression. Conversely, our observation that knockdown of the Ccr4 and Pan2 deadenylases increased RNAPII promoter occupancy in uninfected cells suggests that decreased cytoplasmic decay stimulates transcription in mammalian cells. Thus, the transcriptional feedback pathway in mammalian cells appears to operate in a different direction than in yeast. It is notable that in uninfected cells we did not",

Transcriptional repression could represent a way for the cell to conserve energy during stress, or may have evolved as a countermeasure to viral infection, as widespread mRNA decay is more likely to be linked to pathogenesis. If so, gamma-herpesviruses have developed a means to avoid this restriction. While the subset of transcriptionally repressed genes identified by the 4sU-seq dataset appears smaller than anticipated if this response is global, these results likely represent a conservative estimation of the scope of affected genes. Several genes for which we detected robust decay-induced transcriptional repression by 4sU-RT-qPCR showed more modest effects (or appeared unchanged) in the 4sU-seq data. Possible explanations for this underrepresentation by the 4sU-seq pipeline include the high rates of duplication common to nascent RNA-seq, as well as possible overall lower RNA abundance in cells undergoing widespread mRNA degradation, both of which might mask differential expression. Indeed, when we normalized our 4sU-RT-qPCR data to cell number rather than RNA abundance, we observed an even more dramatic reduction in nascent RNA levels between mock and WT infection.",

Although there is a consensus that Xrn1 is involved in transcription, whether it or the other cellular nucleases operate directly via promoter binding or indirectly by impacting the abundance of mRNAs encoding transcriptional regulators (or by another mechanism) remains to be resolved. Two studies demonstrate that yeast Xrn1 can shuttle into the nucleus and bind cellular promoters to enhance transcription initiation and elongation (Haimovich et al., 2013; Medina et al., 2014) . These same studies show that several other cellular decay factors also shuttle into the nucleus and rely on Xrn1 catalytic activity for nuclear import (Haimovich et al., 2013) . Another report instead suggests that Xrn1 impacts transcription indirectly in yeast through degradation of mRNAs encoding transcriptional regulators (Sun et al., 2013) , although how protein levels would increase upon Xrn1 depletion given that Xrn1 targets deadenylated and decapped messages is unclear. We did not observe a significant increase in the nuclear population of Xrn1 in cells expressing muSOX, nor were we able to detect Xrn1 associated with cellular or viral promoters via ChIP. However, a significant proportion of endogenous Xrn1 resides in the nucleus regardless of viral nuclease expression, hinting that Xrn1 may have nuclear functions in mammalian cells in addition to its well-characterized role in cytoplasmic mRNA decay.",

One possibility is that degradation-induced cellular transcriptional repression enables the virus to more efficiently recruit polymerases to viral promoters. Indeed, RNAPII is concentrated in herpesviral replication factories in the nucleus (Rice et al., 1994; Sugimoto et al., 2013) . However, we did not observe a reduction in virally sequestered RNAPII in cells infected with DHS relative to WT MHV68 (unpublished observations), suggesting this cannot fully explain cellular transcriptional repression or viral escape. Alternatively, Xrn1 may more directly impact the transcription of viral promoters in an mRNA decaydependent manner.",

            "text": "The fact that multiple exonucleases are linked to transcriptional repression is consistent with the idea that the act of mRNA degradation is sensed. Depletion of host exonucleases in cells expressing the viral endonucleases should not impact the overall pool of translationally competent mRNAs, as the mRNAs will still be translationally inactivated by viral endonucleolytic cleavage. However, the cleaved fragments will not be efficiently degraded. Thus, transcriptional changes we observed in mammalian cells should not be due to altered levels of transcriptional regulators, in agreement with the fact that we did not detect alterations in transcription in response to cellular exonuclease depletion in the absence of viral nuclease expression. Instead, we hypothesize that feedback between RNA decay and synthesis may instead be regulated by altered nuclear-cytoplasmic distribution of nucleic acid binding proteins in response to mRNA degradation. For example, yeast polymerase subunits Rpb4/7 shuttle between the nucleus, where they function in transcription, and the cytoplasm, where they are involved in mRNA decay and translation initiation (Harel-Sharvit et al., 2010; Lotan et al., 2007) . It may be that factors classically linked to transcription, mRNA decay, and translation function to coordinate and integrate several cellular processes in response to pathogenic or environmental cues (Harel-Sharvit et al., 2010) . We propose that this systemic interconnectedness is present in mammalian cells and that viral infections introduce perturbations to mRNA stability whose downstream consequences impact multiple cellular processes.",

            "text": "Cellular Exonucleases Are Required for the mRNA Decay-Transcription Feedback Mechanism (A-E) HEK293T cells with dox-inducible Xrn1, Dis3L2, or Ccr4 shRNAs were mock or dox-treated for 4 days. (A) Xrn1 knockdown cells were transfected with the indicated plasmid for 24 hr. Level of RNAPII at the Gapdh promoter was measured by ChIP followed by qPCR. The level of protein knockdown was assessed by western blot with the indicated antibodies, with actin serving as a loading control. (B) Xrn1 was knocked down in cells lacking the viral nuclease, and RNAPII ChIP was performed at the Gapdh and Rplp0 promoters. (C) RNAPII ChIP at the Gapdh promoter was performed on cells with and without Dis3L2 knockdown. (D) Dis3L2 was knocked down in cells lacking the viral nuclease, and RNAPII ChIP was performed at the Gapdh and Rplp0 promoters. (E) RNAPII ChIP for Gapdh was performed on cells with Ccr4 knockdown, both alone and in combination with siRNA-mediated knockdown of Pan2. (F) Ccr4 was knocked down alone and in combination with Pan2 in cells lacking the viral nuclease, and RNAPII ChIP was performed at the Gapdh and Rplp0 promoters. Error bars represent the mean with SEM of R 3 independently performed experiments. *p % 0.05, **p % 0.005, ***p % 0.0005. Xrn1 Catalytic Activity Is Required for Reduced RNAPII Transcription (A) Diagram showing the complementation assay procedure. HEK293T cells with dox-inducible Xrn1 were mock or dox-treated for 4 days, whereupon cells were transfected with plasmids expressing WT or the catalytically dead D208A Xrn1 mutant, as well as with muSOX or muSOX D219A. (B) Following the above procedure, ChIP and qPCR were performed to measure RNAPII recruitment to the human Gapdh promoter. (C) NIH 3T3 cells were infected with WT or DHS MHV68 for 24 hr. RNAPII recruitment to the Rpl37 and ActB promoters and internal genes was measured by ChIP followed by qPCR. (D) Ser2 ChIP was performed using the internal Rpl37 and ActB promoters. The level of Ser2-phosphorylated RNAPII was determined by dividing the Ser2 values over the total RNAPII within the same region of the gene. (E) Diagram showing procedure for calculating transcription elongation rates. DRB was added to infected cells for 3 hr, then removed, and cells were 4sU-labeled. Conditions tested include no DRB treatment (NT), DRB without washout (DRB), 8 min 4sU after DRB washout (8 min), and 12 min 4sU after DRB washout (12 min). (F) Relative kb/min calculated by normalizing RNA levels to NT and DRB and subtracting the amount of 4sU-labeled RNA at 10 kb (distal) at 12 min from the amount at 1 kb (proximal) at 8 min. Error bars represent the mean with SEM of R 3 independently performed experiments. *p % 0.05, **p % 0.005, ***p % 0.0005.",
