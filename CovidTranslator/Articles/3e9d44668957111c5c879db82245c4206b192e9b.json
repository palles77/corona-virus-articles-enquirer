            "text": "Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) is a coronavirus which causes severe gastroenteritis and atrophy of intestinal villous epithelial cells in piglets. However, the mechanism of cell death caused by TGEV is not known. In this study, we report that TGEV induces cell death by apoptosis. TGEV-induced apoptosis was demonstrated by agarose gel electrophoresis, electron microscopy, and terminal deoxytransferase digoxigenin-dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL). Double labeling experiment confirmed the result from electron microscopy and showed that most of the apoptotic cells were bystander cells as they were negative for TGEV nucleic acids. Results of this study indicate that TGEV induces apoptosis in vitro and that most of the cells undergoing apoptosis are bystander cells, thus amplifying the cytopathic effect of TGEV. * Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), a coronavirus, is a pleomorphic enveloped virus with a positive-sense single-stranded RNA genome [31] . TGEV is associated with an economically important disease, transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE), and causes severe vomiting, diarrhea, and high mortality in piglets during the first few weeks of life [31] . TGE has been recognized since 1946 [6] and has been extensively studied. However, the mechanism of TGEV-induced cell death is still unclear. Recently, several DNA [9, 23, 27, 29, 30] and RNA viruses [8, 10, 12, 18, 26, 32, 36, 41, 46] have been shown to induce cell death by apoptosis. We investigated whether TGEV kills cells by apoptosis, if there is a",

Uninoculated and inoculated cells on 6-well plates were observed for cytopathic effect (CPE) and at 12, 24, 32, 40 , and 48 h postinoculation (h p.i.). The cells were then scraped with a cell scraper (Fisher, PA), transferred to 1.5 ml microfuge tube, and centrifuged at 1100 \u00d7 g for 3 min. Cells were washed, and resuspended in 200 l of cold phosphate buffer saline (PBS) pH 7.2. Total cell DNA was obtained using a Qiagen tissue kit (Qiagen, CA). DNA was precipitated and resuspended in 60 l of TE buffer. Finally, 10 l of the total 60 l cell DNA was electrophoresed on a 1.2% agarose gel (Amresco, Solon, OH). DNA bands were stained with ethidium bromide, visualized by UV illuminator, and recorded on Polaroid type 57 film (Polaroid Corporation, Cambridge, MA). This assay was repeated three times using 3 different sets of cells. Cytopathic effect (CPE) characterized by rounding and sloughing of cells was detected at 24 h p.i. in TGEV-inoculated ST cell cultures. The extent of CPE increased by 48 h p.i. (Table 1 ). Apoptosis was observed at 24 h p.i. and was characterized by fragmentation of DNA to approximately 180 base pair ladder. Both CPE and relative amounts of low molecular weight (LMW) DNA were evident at 24 h p.i. and peaked at 48 h p.i. (Table 1 and Fig. 1 ).",

Fluorescein-labeled RNA probe was prepared from plasmid pPSP.FP 1 as reported previously [34] which contains the TGEV S gene segment from nucleotides 1 678 to 2 250 [3, 42] . Specificity of the probe for TGEV was determined by dot blot hybridization [43] . Briefly, uninoculated and TGEV-inoculated ST cells on 8-well chamber slides at 12, 24, 32, 40, and 48 h p.i. were used for in situ hybridization (ISH) as described previously [35] . Uninoculatd and TGEV-inoculated cells were treated with proteinase K (1 g/ml) at 37 \u2022 C for 10 min, washed, and incubated with 20% cold acetic acid for 15 sec. Uninoculated and TGEV-inoculated cells were hybridized with 50 l of hybridization buffer containing 2 l of fluorescein-labeled RNA probe (1 ng/l). Uninoculated and TGEV-inoculated cells were treated with RNase A(20 g/ml) at 37 \u2022 C for 30 min, and washed in series of SSC. The hybridization signal was detected by incubating with either anti-fluorescein peroxidase antibody (1:50) or antifluorescein alkaline phosphatase antibody (1:400) (Boehringer Mannheim, Indianapolis, IN) for 1 h at room temperature. Slides were incubated with DAB or NBT and BCIP and counterstained with either hematoxylin or nuclear fast red. Con- Cells on 8-well chamber slides were counted to determine cell viability at each time point. Both the adherent and detached cells were collected, centrifuged, resuspended in PBS (pH 7.2), and stained with trypan blue to determine cell viability [33] . Cell viability was determined in triplicates. The viability count results showed that the percentage of live cells decreased after 24 h p.i. and was lowest at 48 h p.i. (Fig. 5A) . The adherent cells on 8-well chamber slides were used to detect apoptosis in situ.

The slides were counterstained with either nuclear fast red or hematoxylin. The cells with the signal localized within the nucleus without diffuse staining in the cytoplasm or extracellular area were interpreted as being apoptotic cells [5] . i. There were a higher percentage of apoptotic cells in the inoculated wells than that in the uninoculated wells at each time point, and the percentage of positive cells increased with time (Fig. 5B ). The apoptotic cells had purple nuclei and no cytoplasmic staining (Fig. 6B) . Several apoptotic bodies were blebbing out of the cytoplasm and were scattered in the intercellular space. There were a few TUNEL-positive cells in the uninoculated wells (Fig. 6A) .",

Media from 8-well chamber slides at each time point was also collected and centrifuged for obtaining the detached cells to perform double-labeling technique. TGEV-infected cells in TGEV-inoculated wells had purple cytoplasm whereas apoptotic cells had brown nuclei ( Fig. 7B and 7C ). In contrast, the ST cells in uninoculated wells had neither purple cytoplasm nor brown nucleus (Fig. 7A ). Both the TGEV-positive and apoptotic cells were detected as early as 12 h p.i. (Fig. 7B) and their numbers increased with time. The majority of the adherent cells were positive for either TGEV nucleic acid, or apoptosis. Most of the apoptotic cells lacked TGEV RNA whereas most of the TGEV-positive cells did not exhibit apoptosis. At 48 h p.i. there were, however, a few double positive cells which were positive for TGEV RNA and had round TUNEL-positive particles in the cytoplasm (Fig. 7C) . These particles were apoptotic bodies that were phagocytized from the apoptotic cells rather than nuclei of the double positive cells. About 75-80% of the detached cells at 24, 32, 40, and 48 h p.i. were positive for either TGEV nucleic acid or apoptosis. Another 20-25% of the detached cells at these time points were double positive cells. Most of these cells appeared to be necrotic cells as these cells were swollen, lacked nucleus, and had diffuse TUNEL signal. However, there were about 2-5% of the necrotic double-positive detached cells that had discrete staining of apoptotic bodies. These infected cells may phagocytize apoptotic bodies from the neighbor cells. This is the first report showing that TGEV is capable of inducing apoptosis. This was demonstrated by several methods including analysis of total cellular DNA for low molecular weight DNA by agarose gel electrophoresis, TUNEL labeling for detection of DNA fragmentation in situ, and transmission electron microscopy for nuclear morphology. There was general agreement in results obtained with different techniques. In the analysis of total cellular DNA, DNA [39] . There was a correlation between appearance of apoptosis and CPE that began at 24 h p.i. and peaked at 48 h p.i. Using electron microscopy, we found several cells in TGEV-inoculated wells having sharp nuclear chromatin condensation along the nuclear membrane with intact nuclear and cell membranes. These are considered the characteristic of apoptosis [14] . Viral particles were present in lytic cells but not in the apoptotic cells, suggesting that infected cells were undergoing cell lysis. McClurkin and Norman [25] also reported changes in TGEV-inoculated cells suggestive of apoptosis, although the characteristics of apoptosis were not recognized at that time. They observed changes in the nuclei of the ST and swine kidney cell cultures infected with several isolates of TGEV stained with acridine orange which were characterized by shrunken, marked clumping and margination of the chromatin material along the nuclear membrane [25] .",

In this study, we have shown that TGEV induces apoptosis in ST cell culture, and infected cells undergo cell lysis. Most of the apoptotic cells were bystander cells whereas most of the productively infected cells did not undergo apoptosis. However, whether TGEV is capable of inducing apoptosis in enterocytes in vivo is still unresolved.",
