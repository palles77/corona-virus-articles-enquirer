Outbreaks associated with the person-to-person or animal-to-person transmission of Ebola, Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Pandemic Influenza represent a few examples of this growing problem. These viruses are often difficult to protect against due to the lack of approved antiviral drugs and vaccines and the general population has limited herd or acquired immunity to provide protection from an infection. Additionally, they cause acute infections with high case fatality rates that are dependent upon the specific strain of virus but typically 50-90% for Ebola [1] , 40% for MERS-CoV [2] and 60% for the HPAI [3] ).",

            "text": "One of the underlying factors which may contribute to the high fatality rate is the ability of these viruses to induce hypercytokinemia, often termed a cytokine storm (CS), in immunocompetent individuals [3] [4] [5] . Cytokine storm is a potentially fatal immune condition characterized by rapidly proliferating and highly activated T cells, macrophages and natural killer cells and an associated overproduction and release of more than 150 inflammatory cytokines, and chemical mediators by immune or nonimmune defense cells [6, 7] . If left untreated CS can lead to severe pathological complications including sepsis, shock, tissue damage and/or multiple organ failure, edema and ultimately death. Furthermore, CS has known to be closely associated with the development of viral hemorrhagic fevers which are a severe immunopathological condition caused by a number of viruses; including Ebola, Marburg, Lassa, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever and Dengue fever Current and future developments in the treatment of virus-induced hypercytokinemia (DF) viruses [8] . Despite the severity and potential fatal outcome following infection with these viruses, CS has seldom been specifically targeted in order to either diagnose and/or potentially treat the diseases that they cause. As there are generally no licensed antiviral drugs against most of these emerging viruses the treatment of these patients has been generally limited to supportive care such as fluid and electrolyte replacements. In developing countries this basic supportive care may also be absent.",

This highlights the potential benefits and challenges of targeting the immune response for the treatment of viral infections. Using strategies that have been adopted for three specific emerging or re-emerging viruses, namely Ebola, avian influenza and Dengue, this review will outlines several treatment options that have been utilized that target CS (summarized in Table 1 ).

Analysis of the age-related death rates for this pandemic revealed that infected people 15-34 years of age (teenagers and young adults) were more than 20-times higher than in previous influenza outbreaks. Overall, half of the influenza-related deaths were in young adults 20-40 years of age [14] .

However, one example illustrates the therapeutic challenges associated with administering anti-inflammatory drugs as monotherapies for treating acute viral infections. It was found that glucocorticoid treatment administered for the suppression of cytokine production did not protect mice from lethal infection with HPIA (A/Vietnam/1203/04 H5N1) [16] . Further, in human case studies during the H5N1 outbreaks in Southeast Asia patients who were treated with steroids such as dexamethasone and methylprednisolone (with or without the antiviral drug oseltamivir) were found to have high mortality rates and steroid treatment did not improve clinical outcomes [9] . The use of COX-2 inhibitors (celecoxib, mesalazine), both as a monotherapy and in combination with the antiinfluenza drug (neuraminidase inhibitor zanamivir), has also been considered within experimental models of influenza. It was found that COX-2 inhibitors enhanced the antiviral efficacy of zanamivir in the treatment of mice against infection with influenza A/H5N1 virus [17] . In this study, all treatments were administered at 48 h post challenge to mimic the timely lines associated with diagnosis in a clinical setting. Under this treatment regimen, the use of zanamivir alone did not result in significant improvement in the survival rate (13.3%), but enhanced survival (10.7 days) when compared with the untreated control group (0% survival at 6.6 days) [17] . Zanamivir alone did reduce virus load in the lungs, but not inflammation and mortality. Similarly, the use of COX-2 inhibitors alone (celecoxib or mesalazine, or both) did not provide any improvement in the survival rate (0% survival) but prolonged survival time (between 8.5 and 9.5 days compared with 6.6 days for control). However, when the infected mice were treated with a triple combination of zanamivir, celecoxib and mesalazine administered at 4 h post virus challenge, there were significant improvements in the survival rate (53.3%), prolongation of [29] Combination therapy Antiviral plus anti-inflammatory drugs Zanamivir plus COX-2 inhibitors Oseltamivir plus S1P1R agonists",

MyD88 a key component of the innate immune system was identified in the study as the adaptor molecule of the TLR signaling pathway responsible primarily for the cytokine amplification following pathogenic influenza virus challenge. S1P1R agonist AAL-R has shown to significantly reduce the release of inflammatory cytokines while maintaining protective antibody and cytotoxic T-cell responses in mice [21] . These preclinical data highlight the promise of these drugs for treating acute viral infections and suggest that S1P1R agonists could improve clinical outcomes and significantly reduce mortality of patients infected with the highly pathogenic or pandemic influenza by controlling the fatal CS side effects of disease. S1P1R agonists will now be required to undergo future development leading to safety and dose toler-ability testing in Phase I clinical trials before consideration can be given to their use in humans. However, if these potential drug products are found to have good safety profiles there will be a compelling justification for these candidate drugs to be taken forward for full regulatory approval. If these drugs should reach licensure it would greatly enhance our pandemic preparedness not only against influenza but also potential for combating other emerging viral diseases that induce CS (e.g., Ebola, MERS-CoV and SARS).",

Short-term heat shock (39\u00b0C for 4 h) treatment of mice resulted in significant increased levels of HSP70 (a key member of the HSP protein family known to play in a role in antiviral immunity), and in the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b2 and IFN-\u03b3 [29] . However, when the heat shock-treated mice were challenged with a lethal dose of HPAI virus, 57% of the heat shocktreated mice survived the virus challenge at day 14 post-infection compared with 0% survival in the untreated control group [29] . The heat shock-treated mice were found to have reduced lung pathological damages, reduced body weight loss and virus replication in the lung tissues which was found to correlate with an increased expression of HSP70 in the lungs of the heat shock-treated group when compared with the control [29] . Intriguingly, the expression of proinflammatory cytokines IL-6, IFN-\u03b2 and IFN-\u03b1 were significantly reduced at day 6 and a reduction in the presence of TNF-\u03b1 level was also noted at day 1 post-infection within the lungs of mice which received the heat shock treatment when compared with the untreated control group [29] .

In one such study in Guinea in 2014, oral rehydration was given to 36 patients with confirmed Ebola, and 28 patients of these patients received additional intravenous fluid resuscitation. A median of 1 l of intravenous crystalloids was administered to these patients during the first 24 h after admission. Of these patients who received supportive therapy, the mortality rate was 43% (16 of 36 patients) [33] . This case fatality rate here is lower than that recorded at other sites in Guinea [33] . Another retrospective study of 106 Ebola patients from Sierra Leone, documented a case fatality rate of 74%. High-quality supportive care is thought to have contributed to the higher number of survivors observed in Guinea. More randomized and controlled studies are needed to affirm the therapeutic role of supportive therapies such a fluid and electrolyte replacements in i mproving s urvival in the treatment of Ebola patients.",

The virus produces a number of extracellular proteins which protects the virus from destruction by the host's antiviral immune responses. One of these proteins, SERP-1, is a potent inhibitor of both thrombolytic and thrombotic proteases and has been demonstrated to have anti-inflammatory properties in a wide range of animal models [36, 37] . In a small exploratory study, wild-type BALB/c mice infected with mouse-adapted Ebola virus (Zaire 1976 Mayinga strain) treated with SERP-1 was found to increase survival time/rate and this was dose dependent, with higher drug concentration offering higher protection [34] . Furthermore, treated animals were found to have decreased tissue necrosis and cell invasion in both spleen and livers, compared with untreated infected mice [34] .

More clinical studies will be needed in the future to determine whether treatment with doxycycline can provide significant therapeutic outcomes in DF, DHF and DSS patients by evaluating disease severity, survival rates and decreasing the required duration for hospitalization.

In human infections, Zika fever is less severe compared with DHF and DF, but its pathogenesis is associated with the polyfunctional T-cell activation and involves the elevation of several serum cytokines [43] . In the acute infection phase, significant increases in the serum cytokines concentrations of IL-1b, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-9, IL-10, IL-13, IL-17, IFN-\u03b1-induced protein 10 (IP-10), RANTES and MIP-1\u03b1, compared with normal controls.

Since both DF and Zika viruses are both mosquito-borne flaviviruses spread by the same vector, the Aedes aegypti mosquito, and share similar immunopathogenesis pattern in T-cell activation and inflammatory cytokine inductions, it is proposed by some that lessons learned from Dengue research may expedite the development of effective therapeutic and prophylactic strategies for Zika virus [44] Conclusion & future perspective Many infectious disease and public health experts predict that zoonotic and mosquito-borne viruses will continue to emerge or re-emerge with increasing frequency in the future. Novel viruses will continue to evolve through naturally occuring mutations and pose a realistic threat to global public health as well as having significant impacts to the economy. Many of these emerging novel viruses are likely to be hard to protect against due to lack of approved antiviral drugs and vaccines that are available therefore preparedness through the identification of new/novel treatments and therapeutic strategies are essential for the future from a public health perspective. In particular, the development of approaches that target common events or pathways used by pathogenic viruses such as the induction of CS offer the potential for treatments that are effectice across different viral families and/or strains.",

However, it is likely that the successful treatment of human patients infected with a CS-inducing emerging virus will need to encompass the use of a two-or three-pronged therapeutic strategy involving; an antiviral drug (if available), alongside the adjunct biological or chemical immune-modulating agent which suppresses CS and supportive therapy (fluid, e lectrolyte replacement and/or oxygen therapy).",
