Methods : A total of 195 gastrectomy specimens with stage I to III were examined for eIF3f expression by immunohistochemistry and for Her-2/neu expression by fl uorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with the median follow-up period of 38 months. Results : The positive expression rate of eIF3f in GC and adjacent noncancerous tissue were 33.8% and 59.5%, respectively. eIF3f levels were linked to more advanced tumor stages and likelihood of recurrence (all p < 0.05). The Kaplan-Meier survival curves indicated that decreased expression of eIF3f could serve as a prognosis marker for poor outcome of GC patients (p = 0.04). 15.9% of GC specimens were positive for Her-2/neu, but whose expression was of no correlation with patients' survival. Patients who were positive for Her-2/neu also had high eIF3f expression levels (p = 0.0295). Conclusion : Results suggest that eIF3f may play an important role in recurrence, thus representing a promising predictive marker for the prognosis of GC. But Her-2/neu has no relationship with the prognosis of GC. The clinical signifi cance of eIF3f and Her-2/neu remains to be further investigated. Clin Trans Sci 2015; Volume 8: 320-325",

            "text": "Gastric cancer (GC) is one of the most common malignant tumors worldwide. Th e WHO statistics shows that there are approximately one million new cases and 700,000 death all over the world in 2008. [1] [2] [3] In the past several decades, intensive eff orts have been made to identify tools to improve prognostication of GC. Such as miR-21, miRNA-106a, and miR-143, as well as miR-203 are considered to be promising novel biomarkers for GC. 4 However, except for the cancer staging, which adjuvant treatment depends on, defi nite predictive factors of the prognosis of GC are relatively scarce. [5] [6] [7] [8] Th us, fi nding new prognostic tools, such as biomarkers, for accurate diagnosis of GC is of vital importance to improve the therapeutic eff ect and prolong the survival of patients. Th e eukaryotic initiation factor 3f (eIF3f) is the p47 subunit of the multisubunit eIF3 complex and plays an important role in translation initiation. [9] [10] [11] Although the role of eIF3f in the eIF3 complex has not been defi ned, [12] [13] [14] shutoff experiments in Schizosaccharomyces pombe show that in a long-term period, eIF3f is essential for viability. 15 Translation system indicate that in mammalian cells eIF3f is a negative regulator of translation, which plays an important role in human cancer. 12, 16 Study of Roberta Marchione showed that the f subunit of eIF3 represents a promising candidate molecule to use for biotherapeutic applications. 17 Previous studies identifi ed eIF3f as a protein involved in apoptotic signaling is a negative regulator of translation and we also demonstrated that eIF3f expression signifi cantly decreased in many human cancers, which plays an important role in human cancer. 11, 16, 18, 19 Shi et al. report that eIF3f is downregulated in several human tumors, and that its overexpression inhibited cell proliferation in melanoma and pancreatic cancer cells. 11 Recent studies of Ana E. Higareda-Mendoza and Marco A. Pardo-Galv\u00e1n also show that eIF3f is essential for A549 cell proliferation and its absence induces the cell to enter apoptosis. 20 Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (Her-2) is a transmembrane tyrosine kinase receptor involved in development and progression of various solid tumor types, such as breast cancer, pulmonary adenocarcinoma, and colorectal and GC. 21, 22 Moreover, high expression of Her-2/neu has been recognized as one of the poor prognostic factors of breast cancer. Although a great deal of researches has been conducted, the signifi cance of Her-2/neu overexpression in GC and its impact on survival is still controversial.",

Th e procedure was followed by washing in 0.4 \u00d7 sodium saline citrate (SSC)/0.3% Nonidet (NP40) and 2 \u00d7 SSC. Aft er hybridization, the nuclei counterstaining was achieved with 4\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). Slides were scored for hybridization signals on a cell-by-cell basis using a fl uorescence microscope. Results were expressed as the ratio of Her-2/neu signal (orange) to centromere 17 signal (green) and the readings were read as follows: the expected ratio 1-1.8 indicates no gene amplifi cation (negative), a ratio of >2.2 as Her-2/neu gene amplifi cation (positive), and a ratio between 1.8 and 2.2 as equivocal cases. Th e polysomy 17 was also recorded in the cells as four spec green signals as moderate polysomy and >4 spec green signals as high polysomy.",
