Indeed, during the initial disease stages, infected individuals with COVID-19 exhibit clinical features that are similar to those of other common respiratory diseases [15] . Moreover, in the context of the ongoing influenza season, the absence of rapid diagnostic testing for this novel disease complicate case identification for this novel coronavirus [16] .

Further our R estimates could be further improved using additional data collected by field investigations.

Importantly, our posterior estimates of the basic reproduction numbers for China in 2019-2020 are estimated at 0.37 (95%CrI: 0.02-1.78) for market-to-human, and 3.87 (95%CrI:3.18-4.78) for human-to-human, respectively.Other parameter estimates for the probability of occurrence and reporting rate are estimated at 0.93 (95% CrI: 0.74-1.00) and 0.028 (95% CrI: 0.02-0.04) for market-to-human and 0.90 (95% CrI: 0.73-0.99) and 0.00 (95% CrI: 0.00-0.01) for human-to-human, respectively.

These R estimates that account for more details of the underlying transmission dynamics shed light on the impact of the COVID-19 epidemic. Thus, our analysis suggests that the total number of unobserved cases (i.e. cumulative infections) are estimated to be 1685.1 (95% CrI: 1375.3-2009.2) for unobserved cases from market-to-human transmission and 59986.9 (95% CrI: 19925.4-200988.9) for unobserved cases from human-to-human transmission.

However, these estimates need to be interpreted with epidemic context in mind. Specifically, the first intervention targeting market-to-human transmission is unlikely to have mitigated the risk of secondary infections arising from the unfolding transmission chains. The latter decrease is likely the result of enhanced public interventions. However, in the context of rapid and widespread national transmission, efforts to mitigate further spread were complicated by difficulties to track multiple chains of transmission involving cases of the disease with a wide spectrum of illness including asymptomatic and subclinical cases.",

In addition, one study reported that the majority of seasonal coronavirus infections are asymptomatic by most symptom definitions and only 4% of individuals experiencing a seasonal coronavirus infection episode sought medical care for their symptoms [18].This accumulating evidence further underscores the need to account for a significant fraction of asymptomatic cases.
