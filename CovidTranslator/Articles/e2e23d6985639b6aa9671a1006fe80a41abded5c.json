Treatment of neuronal cultures with castanospermine increases the propensity of neurites to fasciculate.

A mannose phosphate is known to be involved in the binding of lymphocytes to the endothelium of postcapillary venules as an initial step in migration from the bloodstream into lymph nodes (Stoolman et al., 1984) . Also, the highly sialated neural cell adhesion molecule (N-CAM) 1 modulates varying degrees of neuron-neuron adhesivity depending on its carbohydrate content (Rutishauser et al., 1978 (Rutishauser et al., , 1985 Cunningham et al., 1983) .

For example, enzymatic treatment to remove carbohydrate residues is often incomplete and selective for certain proteins. The use of tunicamycin as an inhibitor of protein glycosylation yields results that often are difficult to interpret, because protein synthesis may be affected by long exposure to tunicamycin and because proteins completely lacking N-linked carbohydrate may accumulate at intracellular sites and not reach the cell surface (Elbein, 1984; Olden et al., 1985) .",

After examination in the phase microscope, comparable areas of control and drug-treated cultures were chosen and scored for thin sectioning. Representative areas were chosen to meet these criteria: (a) 1.25 mm from the edge of the central zone of the culture containing neuronal somata, and (b) neurites both close to the collagen substratum and populated with flattened Schwann cells. Two areas of castanospermine-treated cultures were specifically chosen to contain myelin segments. A total of five areas in two separate experiments were assessed by electron microscopy for extent of ensheathment and extracellular matrix deposition in cultures grown in medium M with and without castanospermine; in addition, two areas were sampled from cultures maintained for the duration of the experiment in N2 medium. Thin sections were stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate and photographed in a JEOL JEM-100 CX II or Philips 300 electron microscope at 60 kV.

After incubation for 8 h, the cell homogenates were digested exhaustively with pronase, and the glycopeptides were separated on columns of Biogel P-4 (see Materials and Methods). Since these columns did not completely resolve the complex types of oligosaccharides from the high-mannose types, the entire glycopeptide peak was pooled, digested with Endo H, and rechromatographed on the column. Fig. 1 B shows the gel filtration profiles of the oligosaccharides and glycopeptides released by Endo H digestion. In the control cells, three peaks were observed after Endo H digestion. The first peak, whose migration was not altered by the enzymatic treatment, contained '~28 % of the total radioactivity. This peak appears to be composed of complex types of oligosaccharides. The second peak, which emerged in fractions 54-64, was shifted by the Endo H treatment to a slower migrating peak. The elution position of this peak and its susceptibility to a-marmosidase indicated that this was a high-mannose structure of Mang_gGlcNAc (see below). The third sharp peak apparently is free mannose, since its elution position is in the monosaccharide area of the column. In the presence of castanospermine the first peak was greatly reduced and represented <10% of the total radioactivity. Again the elution position of this peak was not shifted by the Endo H treatment. On the other hand, the migration of the second peak was altered by Endo H, and after treatment it emerged in fractions 52-58. This peak is probably a Glc3ManT-a GIcNAc, based on its elution from calibrated columns and its limited susceptibility to a-mannosidase (see below). It can be seen that the high-marmose structures of control tissue were absent in the presence of castanospermine.",

A rather broad oligosaccharide peak was obtained from the control cells and eluted at a position near to that of the MangGlcNAc MangGIcNAc standards. This oligosaccharide was completely susceptible to digestion by jack bean a-mannosidase and gave rise to a major peak of free mannose and a small peak of Man-13-GlcNAc (data not shown). Thus, the oligosaccharide present in peak 2 of control ceils appears to be composed of typical high-mannose structures of the Man~_9GlcNAc composition. The oligosaccharide in peak 2 of the castanospermine-treated cells was larger in size than that of control cells and eluted near the hexose~oGlcNAc and hexoseaGlcNAc standards. This oligosaccharide was only slightly susceptible to \u00a2t-mannosidase digestion and gave rise to products with sizes corresponding to hexosegGlcNAc plus radioactive mannose (data not shown). This new oligosaccharide produced in the presence of a-mannosidase would appear to be Glc3Man6GlcNAc and the original oligosaccharide isolated from castanospermine-treated cells is therefore a mixture of Glc3ManTGlc-NAc and Glc3MansGlcNAc.",

We have estimated the turnover times of dorsal root ganglion neuron proteins by labeling cultures with 2-1 3H]-D-mannose as described in Materials and Methods, followed by solubilization of the cultures after 2, 4, 6, or 11 d of chase in serum-supplemented medium (Ratner et al ., 1985) and analyzing radioactivity in trichloroacetic acid-precipitable material after these times. We observed that 60% of the proteins in these neurons turn over with a half-life of 2 d, while 40% turn over with a half-life of 6 d . Any slower component is not detectable using this method . The possible slow turnover of a specific protein is probably not a problem in experiments analyzing neurite outgrowth and fasciculation, where a considerable amount of de novo synthesis of membrane protein is required for neurite elongation, but must be considered in experiments such as those examining ensheathment and myelination (see below) . Neunte Growth and Fasciculation Examination of neurite outgrowth in the presence of castanospermine was undertaken using conditions in which nonneuronal cell proliferation is retarded by the combination of a specific substratum (air-dried collagen) (Roufa et al ., 1983) and tissue culture medium (Leibowitz's L-15) (Pfenninger Table I -Pfeuninger, 1981) . Migrating non-neuronal cells from the explant do not catch up to the front of growing neurites for as long as 7 d. We initially chose this combination of methods to retard non-neuronal cell growth in order to avoid the use of the antimitotic agent, fluorodeoxyuridine, which has been observed to slow neurite outgrowth from sympathetic ganglia (Argiro and Johnson, 1981) . When we compared neurite outgrowth in the presence of 10 -5 M cytosine arabinoside with that on air-dried collagen and in L-15, however, no difference in outgrowth was observed under these conditions, even after 7 d. Subsequent experiments were performed, therefore, in the presence of cytosine arabinoside to allow a clearer view of the state of fasciculation of the dorsal root ganglion neurites. The extent of neurite outgrowth in the presence of castanospermine was 90% of the control growth. For example, after 5 d in culture the outgrowth from control neurons was 2,142 + 178 gm (n = 6) and of castanospermine-treated neuron, 1,918 + 102 gm (n = 5) ( Table I) .",

The molecules involved in this interaction have not been identified, although some evidence has been presented that the adhesive molecule(s) on the neuron are sensitive to glutaraldehyde and trypsin (Salzer et al., 1980a) and distinct from the Schwann cell mitogen (see below) (Ratner et al., 1985; Sobue and Pleasure, 1985) . We have not studied the initial adhesive interaction between neuron and Schwann cell directly. However, we have co-cultured the two cell types for up to 7 wk in the presence of 250 Ixg/ml castanospermine in defined medium. Whereas some atrophy of neurites (in the form of retraction) is observed after these long times, Schwann cells remain attached to the surviving neurites, indicating that this interaction is not dependent on N-linked sugars (data not shown).",

An implicit thesis in this experiment is that the initial neuron-Schwann cell recognition event is the same as the molecular interaction maintaining the adhesion. After being switched from defined N2 medium to medium M + castanospermine (Fig. 3 B) , Schwann cells in the presence of the drug appear to enhance their adhesivity to the neurons in that they become more flattened onto neurite bundles, losing their tendency to aggregate and perch on neurites. Schwann cells in drug-treated cultures (Fig. 3 B) also appear more densely packed on neurites than do Schwann cells in cultures in defined medium (Fig. 3 A) , but less packed than cells in myelinating M medium without castanospermine (Fig. 3 C) .",

Addition of castanospermine to co-cultures of Schwann cells and neurons had no effect (91% of control) on the mitogenic response observed after 3 d in the presence of the inhibitor, indicating that the mitogenic response does not require the presence of a specific N-linked oligosaccharide on the surface of either the neuron or the Schwann cell. Interpretation of these data depends on (a) the effectiveness of castanospermine as an inhibitor of glycoprotein maturation and (b) the rate of turnover of the mitogen on the neuronal membrane and the mitogen receptor presumed to exist on the Schwann cell surface. The rapid turnover of these proteins appears likely because after trypsinization the neurite mitogen reappears on the cell surface within 36 h (Salzer et al., 1980a) , indicating a relatively rapid rate of synthesis, and trypsintreated Schwann cells become responsive to the neurite mitogen within 24 h (Ratner et al., 1985) .",

As the nerve matures, Schwann cell numbers increase (presumably due to the presence of the neurite mitogen, see above), and Schwann cells invade axon bundles and begin to segregate axons. In an intermediate state, a single Schwann cell may surround several groups of small axons and one or two larger axons with its processes. As the process of ensheathment is completed, a single nonmyelinating Schwann cell surrounds several mature axons, providing each axon with a collar of membrane-delineated cytoplasm. To myelinate nerve fibers, a Schwann cell enters into a one-to-one relationship with an axon before beginning to form a myelin sheath (Webster, 1971) . Each Schwann cell associated with neurites in either of these ways is surrounded by basal lamina. The processes of Schwann cell proliferation, axon segregation, wrapping, and myelination occur simultaneously among neighboring ceils. In tissue culture we can regulate the expression of these events by controlling medium and substratum components. In serum-free defined medium, Schwann ceils adhere to neurites and proliferate (Moya et al., 1980) but assemble essentially no basal lamina (Moya et al., 1980; Carey and Bunge, 1981; Bunge et al., 1986) and show little tendency to begin ensheathing neurites; some axons (primarily in small groups) become partly surrounded by Schwann cell processes but (a) in the case of Schwann cells associated with >1 axon, axons are not individually ensheathed, and (b) Schwann cells do not establish a one-toone relationship with axons.",

Under all culture conditions, regions of bare neurites were present but, in cultures in medium M without castanospermine, Schwann cells had begun to ensheathe neurites and, even after only 2 wk, segregated some axons individually (Fig. 4 B) and myelinated a population of these (Fig. 4 A) . In medium M with or without castanospermine, the preliminary processes of ensheathment had occurred in that a Schwann cell often surrounded a single axon and also a group of axons. Fig. 4 , C-G are representative of Schwann cell-axon relationships in castanospermine-treated cultures, showing the range of interactions observed. As shown in Fig. 4 (Fand G) , one-to-one relationships between Schwann cells and larger diameter (myelin competent?) axons developed in the presence of castanospermine. Axons (n = 120) ensheathed with \u00be, 1, l tA, or 1 Y2 turns of Schwann cell cytoplasm were counted in cultures grown in medium M with and without castanospermine; the drug-treated culture did not differ significantly from the control in this 1:1 relationship. In contrast to medium M without castanospermine, however, more than I t& turns of Schwann cell cytoplasm were not observed in the presence of castanospermine (except in the rare instances in which a myelin sheath was present; Fig. 4 D and see below) .",

Castanospermine treatment appears to be another example of this phenomenon because basal lamina formed in drug-treated cultures was patchy and very much less extensive than that found in control cultures, although more than that observed in cultures in serum-free defined medium. The electron micrographs in Fig. 4 show the typical extent of basal lamina formation (arrowheads) observed in castanospermine-treated cultures. Even when surrounding the rarely occurring myelinating Schwann cell (Fig. 4 D) , basal lamina was less than on myelinating Schwann cells grown in the absence of castanospermine. When basal lamina was present on Schwann cells in the presence of castanospermine, it was more prominent on the surface of those in a 1:1 relationship with axons, as would be expected from previous work (Bunge et al., 1982a) . Thin collagen fibrils (arrows), which can be observed in control cultures as early as 2 d after shifting from serum-free medium to medium M (Tiffany, B., C. Eldridge, and M. B. Bunge, unpublished observations), were rare in castanospermine-treated cultures (Fig. 4 , C, E, and G) and, when present (Fig. 4 F) , were not as closely related to the Schwann cell surface as in the control (Fig. 4 B) .",

After 2 wk in medium M plus castanospermine, Schwann cells did not assemble typical basal lamina by immunocytochemical criteria. Fig. 5 shows typical areas from control and castanospermine-treated cultures stained with antibodies against heparan sulfate proteoglycan (Fig. 5, A-D) , The distribution of the three basal lamina antigens tested appears linked in that the three classes of molecules are present in a tight network associated with the Schwann cell surface under normal conditions; castanospermine treatment depressed the deposition of all three types of molecules (data not shown). Nevertheless, all three antigens were present at higher levels than in cultures maintained in N2 medium, in accordance with areas of patchy basal lamina observed by electron microscopy (Fig. 4) . In regions where Schwann cells were clumped, brightly fluorescent patches were observed using all three antibodies, and isolated Schwann cells were stained in a punctate manner with anti-heparan sulfate proteoglycan as well as anti-type IV collagen and anti-laminin antibodies.

Inhibitors such as castanospermine allow a distinction between two possible roles for N-linked oligosaccharides on cell surface glycoproteins involved in cell-cell interactions. In the first, a cell-cell interaction requires the presence of a specific carbohydrate structure; an example is the interaction ofa lectin with a sugar. In the second, the carbohydrate, as a large, hydrophilic component of the protein, may influence the conformation or characteristics of the protein, but is not directly involved in the cell-cell interaction. By generating glycoproteins with high mannose cores but without mature (high mannose or complex) oligosaccharides, castanospermine should affect the former interactions but not the latter. This is in contrast to inhibitors such as tunicamycin which affect both types of molecules by completely blocking the formation of any N-linked oligosaccharides.",

These interactions include neuron-Schwann cell adhesion, neuron-induced Schwann cell proliferation, and neurite outgrowth. The independence of these events from specific N-linked sugars introduces the question of whether other types of sugar chains on proteins might mediate these events. In parallel studies, the effects of a competitive inhibitor of proteoglycan biosynthesis have been analyzed in this system. The loss of a heparan sulfate proteoglycan on the neuronal surface inhibits Schwann cell proliferation (Rather et al., 1985) , but inhibition of proteoglycan biosynthesis by over 85% does not affect neuron-Schwann cell adhesion. Ensheathment of neurons by Schwann cells and basal lamina formation by Schwann cells also appear normal at the electron microscope level in the presence of 1 mM 4-methylumbelliferyl-13-D-xyloside, although myelin formation is inhibited and the few segments that do form are shorter than normal myelin segments (Ratner et al., 1986) . These results, taken together with the results using castanospermine, indicate that it is possible to recognize by the use of appropriate inhibitors specific classes of molecules that are essential, by virtue of their sugar chains, to a given cell-cell interaction.",

            "text": "Castanospermine-treated cultures show enhanced neurite fasciculation. Although data are not available for the rat, chicken lumbar ganglia tend to fasciculate less than thoracic dorsal root ganglia at the same age (Rutishauser et al., 1978) . Lumbar ganglia also contain more highly sialated (embryonic) N-CAM than do thoracic ganglia in the mouse (Chuong and Edelman, 1984) , retaining the embryonic form after birth. We have chosen conditions that maximize defas-ciculation, i.e., the use of air-dried collagen as a substratum (Roufa et al., 1983) to test the effect of castanospermine on the process. It has been reported that the neural cell adhesion molecule, N-CAM, is at least in part responsible for fasciculation of neurites since anti-N-CAM antibodies block fasciculation (Rutishauser et al., 1978) . The presence of polysialic acid is one of the characteristic features of N-CAM, and a decrease in the amount of sialic acid on N-linked sugars on the molecule appears to enhance its rate of binding to cells (Cunningham et al., 1983) . We would therefore anticipate that a block in the synthesis of specific N-linked oligosaccharides should enhance fasciculation, and this was in fact observed in our experiments (see Fig. 2 ). Monovalent fragments obtained from anti-N-CAM antibodies can defasciculate the fascicles formed subsequent to alteration of the carbohydrate side chains by addition of castanospermine (data not shown), suggesting that the major adhesive molecule in this system appears to be N-CAM and that asparagine-linked oligosaccharides (polysialic acid residues) modulate the adhesion characteristics of N-CAM. While this work was in progress, we were informed by Dr. U. Rutishauser of results (now published, Rutishauser et al., 1985) that demonstrated that treatment of chicken neuron cell surfaces with an endosialidase increased N-CAM-dependent fasciculation in vitro and in the optic nerve. These results and our results are in agreement in that both sets of observations lead to the conclusion that N-CAM-dependent fasciculation is enhanced when N-CAM lacks polysialic acid. Other cell surface glycoproteins have also been implicated in fasciculation and the activity could be altered by culture in the presence of castanospermine; in all cases, however, our results substantiate other data suggesting that the presence of specific N-linked sugars minimizes the adhesion of neurites to each other at least under our culture conditions. It has been reported that tunicamycin treatment of cerebral neurons inhibits neurite outgrowth when added 6-24 h after plating neurons (Yavin et al., 1984) ; this effect may be due to either toxicity of tunicamycin or its effect on transport of proteins to the cell surface. The negative result we have obtained using castanospermine indicates that the mature sugar complement of glycoproteins is not required for neurite initiation or neurite elongation.",

Schwarm ceils are able, in the presence of castanospermine, to segregate larger diameter axons and encircle them with up to llh turns of cytoplasm. Thus specific Nlinked sugars on either the neuron or Schwann cell appear not to be involved in the segregation of a single axon by a Schwann cell but are required for the initiation of wrapping of the Schwann cell membrane around an axon. Very little is known about the molecular components involved in ensheathment and beginning myelin formation; one molecule which may play a role is the myelin-associated glycoprotein, present in the inner mesaxon of Schwann cells (Trapp et al., 1984) .",

            "text": "An alternative explanation for the inhibition of beginning myelination by castanospermine is that this effect is secondary to the Schwann cells' failure to deposit an adequate ex-tracellular matrix (see Bunge et al., 1986) . Previous data show that the presence of neurons is essential (in myelinpromoting medium) for Schwann cells to assemble basal lamina (Bunge et al., 1982a) . Moreover, contact between neuron and Schwann cell is necessary (Clark et al., 1985) . It has been suggested that the formation of basal lamina by Schwann cells may be regulated through adequate production of type IV collagen (Carey et al., 1983; Bunge et al., 1986; Eldridge et al., 1984 Eldridge et al., , 1985 . Other basal lamina components such as laminin (Cornbrooks et al., 1983) and entactin (Carlin et al., 1981) , which are glycoproteins and presumably sensitive to the action of castanospermine, are not by themselves sufficient for normal basal lamina assembly because they are secreted by Schwann cells in defined medium, a condition in which little matrix is assembled . Procollagen contains N-linked oligosaccharides (Clark, 1979) , and therefore the secretion of collagen might be affected by castanospermine. We have shown that type IV procollagen production (as assessed by assembly of a basal lamina) is decreased along with that of heparan sulfate proteoglycan (which should be unaffected by castanospermine treatment) and laminin. The presence of numerous small autophagic vacuoles in Schwann cell cytoplasm in the presence of castanospermine would be consistent with impaired secretion. This concerted inhibition of assembly of the three major classes of molecules into basal lamina must therefore be related to a fundamental disruption in neuron-Schwann cell interaction which does not allow the establishment of polarity of the Schwann cell Bunge et al., 1986) . We therefore postulate that the Schwann cell's failure to begin myelination in the presence of castanospermine is due to the drug's direct effect on one (or a few) cell surface glycoprotein(s) on either neuron or Schwann cell which play(s) a role in directing the initiation of wrapping of the Schwann cell membrane (beyond l t/2 turns) around the neurite.",

In addition, the internodal length appears to reflect the diameter of the axon in several species (Davison and Peters, 1970) . We speculate, therefore, that the inhibition of initiation of mesaxon wrapping of axons in castanospermine prohibits the required steps leading to myelin formation, and not myelination per se. Thus, we propose that N-linked oligosaccharide(s) is (are) involved in the initiation rather than the completion of Schwann cell wrapping or the compaction of the mesaxon into myelin.",
