Phylogenetic analysis based on that region revealed that these viruses were separated into two groups (I and II). IBV isolates in group I were not related to other IBV strains published in the GenBank database. Group 1 nucleotide sequence identities were less than 85% and amino acid sequence identities less than 84% in common with IBVs published in the GenBank database. This group likely represents the strains indigenous to Thailand. The isolates in group II showed a close relationship with Chinese IBVs. They had nucleotide sequence identities of 97-98% and amino acid sequence identities 96-98% in common with Chinese IBVs (strain A2, SH and QXIBV). This finding indicated that the recent Thai IBVs evolved separately and at least two groups of viruses are circulating in Thailand.",

            "text": "Infectious bronchitis (IB), caused by the IB virus (IBV), is a highly contagious disease and results in a significant economic loss to the commercial chicken industry. The disease frequently causes respiratory signs including gasping, coughing, sneezing, tracheal rales, and nasal discharge. In layer fowls, respiratory distress and a decrease in egg production have been reported [10] . In addition, some strains have been associated with kidney lesions [18, 19, 22] . IBV, the causative agent of IB, belongs to the genus Coronavirus in the family Coronaviridae [6] . It is an enveloped virus and has a positive-sense, single-stranded, RNA genome, approximately 27 kb in length. The virion has three major structural proteins namely the nucleocapsid (N) protein, the membrane (M) protein, and the spike (S) glycoprotein. The S glycoprotein is post-translationally cleaved into the S1 and S2 subunits [6] . The S1 subunit, located on the outside of the virion, is responsible for the fusion between the virus envelope and the host cell membrane. Moreover, it is responsible for neutralizing serotype-specific antibodies in chickens [4] . The S1 subunit demonstrates more sequence variability than S2 [14] . Neutralizing and serotype-specific epitopes are associated with the defined hypervariable region (HVR) in the S1 subunit; therefore, the molecular characterization of IBV is based on analysis of the S1 gene [12] . During 1953 During -1954 , the first IBV outbreak was reported in Thailand [7] . Although many IB vaccine strains such as Connecticut, H120, Ma5, M41 and Armidale A3, have been used in Thailand for many years, IBV outbreaks have been ongoing [1] . Moreover, the relationships between recent Thai IBV isolates and foreign IBV isolates are not known. The objective of this study was to characterize IBV field isolates in the recent outbreak of the disease in Thailand by analyzing the S1 gene and compared them with those that have been published previously.",

Sick chickens were selected and sent to the Department of Veterinary Medicine, Faculty of Veterinary Science, Chulalongkorn University. Necropsy was performed and gross lesions were evaluated. Gross lesions showed mildto moderated tracheitis and non-purulent airsacculitis. No gross lesion were found in the kidneys.

The samples were prepared as 10% w/v suspensions in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) and clarified at 1,800 \u00d7 g for 10 min; the supernatants were then collected for analysis.",

Different serotypes have been reported world wide and new variant serotypes continue to be recognized [9, 18] . Thus, it is necessary and important to be able to diagnose these new serotypes. Furthermore, determining the type as well as field isolates is important to select an appropriate vaccine against IBV infection in the next flock. Therefore, several tests have been employed to identify the isolates into serotypes or genotypes [15] . Typing with RT-PCR and sequencing of the S1 gene is easier and faster than the more traditional virus neutralization methods, but it is difficult to design PCR primers that can be used for detect all of IBV isolates [16] . In this study, IBV isolates in group I could not be detected with the primer set and PCR method described by Gelb et al. [8] . To overcome this problem, the new primer sets were designed and the nested RT-PCR was developed in order to increase the sensitivity and specificity of the test used to detect IBV from the infected samples. Moreover, the region amplified by the outer primer covering the HVR of the S1 gene (nucleotide position 31\u223c908) could be used for typing of IBV.",

Furthermore, in a recent study using an approximately 450-bp region covering HVR I and HVR II for IBV typing, it was found that typing by this region correlates with virus neutralization results [17] . In the present study, an approximately 878-bp region of S1 gene covering HVR I and HVR II were amplified and used for typing the field isolates in Thailand.",

The molecular data indicated that the recent IBV isolated in Thailand evolved separately into two groups. The IBV isolates in group I were not related to other IBV strains published in the GenBank database. This genotype likely represents strains indigenous to Thailand. IBV isolates in group II were genetically related to Chinese strains.",

New serotypes or variant strains can emerge as a result of only a few changes in the amino acid composition of S1 gene [5] . The rationale for these changes could be due to immunological pressure caused by the wide spread use of vaccines, recombination as a consequence of mixed infections, or the decrease of dominant serotypes as a result of vaccination, allowing other field strains to emerge [19] . Group II Thai isolates and Chinese strains shared more than 97% nucleotide identity and 96% amino acid identity; therefore, they were grouped into the same genotype. Interestingly, group II Thai isolates were closely related to Chinese QXIBV which appeared to become widespread in several countries in the world including the UK [11] , Russia [3] , and Italy [2] . Although no information is available currently for the introduction of QXIBV from China to other countries, it had been hypothesized that wild birds were the source of introduction based on the evidence that IBV may replicate in Anseriformes [3] .",
