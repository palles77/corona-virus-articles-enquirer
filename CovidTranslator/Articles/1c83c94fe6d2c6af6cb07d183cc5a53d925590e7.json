Here we combined screening of phage display random peptide libraries with a unique computer algorithm \"Mapitope\" to identify the discontinuous epitope of 80R, a potent neutralizing human anti-SARS monoclonal antibody against the spike protein. Using two different types of random peptide libraries which display cysteine-constrained loops or linear 13-15mer peptides, independent panels containing 42 and 18 peptides were isolated, respectively. These peptides, which had no apparent homologous motif within or between the peptide pools and spike protein, were deconvoluted into amino acid pairs (AAPs) by Mapitope and the statistically significant pairs (SSPs) were defined. Mapitope analysis of the peptides was first performed on a theoretical model of the spike and later on the genuine crystal structure. Three clusters (A, B and C) were predicted on both structures with remarkable overlap. Cluster A ranked the highest in the algorithm in both models and coincided well with the sites of spike protein that are in contact with the receptor, consistent with the observation that 80R functions as a potent entry inhibitor. This study demonstrates that by using this novel strategy one can rapidly predict and identify a neutralizing antibody epitope, even in the absence of the crystal structure of its target protein.",

[8] [9] [10] [11] The receptor for SARS-CoV was shortly thereafter identified as angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) 12, 13 and importance of neutralizing antibodies to the SARS-CoV spike protein in preventing infection in vitro and in vivo was established. [1] [2] [3] However, serologic studies from both late outbreak infected humans and with serum from mice immunized with a late outbreak strain demonstrated the presence of antibodies that were able to enhance infection of SARS-like CoV from civet cats in a pseudo-virus reporter assay. 14 Since these enhancing mouse antibodies map to the receptor binding domain (RBD) of Spike (S) protein, a region that would obviously be used in a subunit vaccine, it appears that some epitopes contained therein may be detrimental and thus defining the precise nature of the neutralizing epitope(s) is warranted. Therefore, a vaccine should focus on eliciting only neutralizing antibodies and not antibodies that are either non-neutralizing or enhancing in nature. 15 We took the first steps toward the goal of identifying the major neutralizing epitope of SARS-CoV as a model of neutralizing epitope identification using a reverse immunological approach. In order to accomplish this task one must backtrack from the antibody of interest to its corresponding neutralizing epitope. 16 It is then assumed that, once identified, the epitope can be reconstituted and stabilized with the intent that when administered as a vaccine it will elicit the neutralizing activity characteristic of the original monoclonal antibody (mAb). The human recombinant mAb used in this study, named 80R was isolated from a phage display library after panning against the S1 domain of the SARS-CoV Spike protein. 3 80R binds to the RBD, a 193 amino acid fragment (residues 318 to 510) of spike protein with high-affinity (K d Z1.7 nM) and is a potent neutralizing mAb in vitro and in vivo. 17 It acts as a viral entry inhibitor through blocking the association of S protein to its receptor ACE2. Mutagenesis studies further support this conclusion as Spike determinants involved in the binding of receptor and of 80R are in part overlapping and are likely to result from both common and unique contact residues. 17 ",

            "text": "The principles of the Mapitope algorithm A unique computer algorithm Mapitope enabled us to map epitopes on spike protein using peptides that bind to 80R. Mapitope is an updated userfriendly version of the algorithm previously published by Enshell-Seijffers et al. 16 The prediction of an epitope is based on the notion that the panel of peptides derived from a random peptide library collectively represents the epitope of the mAb which they bind. The underlying principle of Mapitope is that the simplest meaningful fragment of an epitope is an amino acid pair (AAP) of residues that lie within the footprint of the epitope. These AAPs can be related to one another on the surface of the antigen such that a cluster is defined which constitutes the majority of the epitope footprint, i.e. the epitope is in essence a cluster of connected AAPs. The AAPs of the epitope need not be consecutive tandem residues of the antigen, but often are the result of juxtaposition of distant residues brought together through folding of the polypeptide chain, the distance between their carbon alphas (parameter D), defines what constitutes a legitimate pair. AAPs of the epitope are simulated by tandem residues of the peptides, affinity selected from the random library. Each peptide is assumed to contain one or more epitope relevant AAPs, which is the basis for mAb recognition of that peptide. In order to identify the statistically significant pairs (SSPs) present in the panel of peptides, the peptides are first deconvoluted into AAPs. Thus, for example to deconvolute a peptide into AAPs, a peptide of the sequence ABCDE... would be written as the series of pairs: AB, BC, CD, DE, etc. All the AAPs derived from the panel of peptides are then pooled and the frequency of each type is calculated. It is next determined whether the AAPs representation in the pool is higher than the random expectation and if so, these pairs are considered to be SSPs. A second parameter of the algorithm (the first being D) is the frequency of a specific pair in a given pool of AAPs derived from the panel of peptides. The number of standard deviations above randomness for a given pair is defined as the statistical threshold (ST). Once the most frequent AAPs are identified, the algorithm seeks the pairs for a selected D value on the surface of the antigen and attempts to link them into clusters. A third parameter of the algorithm is E, the surface accessibility threshold. E defines those residues that are sufficiently exposed on the antigen's surface to be included in the predicted epitope. The accessibility of each amino acid is automatically calculated using the software \"SurfRace,\" 18 which has been assimilated in the algorithm software. In this study the SSPs which were mapped on the 3-D structure of the antigen contained residues that are at least 5% exposed (EZ5); however, impact of the E parameter was examined as well (see below).",

However, as 13 pairs are homodimers (e.g. AA, BB, etc.) the total number of different AAPs possible is 156. Deconvolution of the 42 peptides of panel 1 produced a total of 568 AAPs which are represented by 133 different pair types. Taking STR3, a total of 11 pair types were found to be statistically significant pairs (SSPs). These 11 pair types (8% of all available 133 pair types) were represented by 108 pairs (19% of all the 568 pairs). Similarly, deconvolution of the 18 peptides of panel 2 produced a total of 252 AAPs represented by 89 different pair types. Taking STR3, a total of 12 pair types were found to be SSPs.

Figure 1 (a) gives the 11 SSPs of panel 1 comparing the observed occurrence with the calculated expected occurrence based on total randomness. Note that in Figure 1 (b) the highest value for occurrence does not necessarily promise the greatest statistical significance, since the statistical significance depends on the individual expectation of each SSP (for more explanation about random expectation of SSPs and factors that can influence this parameter see Enshell-Seijffers et al. 16 ). Compare for example, the SSPs CU versus YC; CU appears 26 times in the peptides, which is five standard deviations greater than its expectation in the library (in a panel of 42 totally random peptides, CU is expected to appear 18.1 times). On the other hand, the SSP YC appears only six times, but is two times more abundant than would be expected; consequently its ST value is 4.76. An extreme case is the pair CJ which exists eight times in the peptides; however, its expected occurrence is 9.05 and therefore this pair is actually under-represented (not shown).

The most desirable starting point for this would be to use a solved atomic structure of the antibody's antigen, in this case, the receptor binding domain (RBD), but such a solved structure was not available when this study initiated. Nonetheless, an alternative Mapitope prediction was conducted using a theoretical model of the spike, which was obtained by homology modeling between the SARS-CoV spike and the botulinum neurotoxin B. 19 The 3-D structure of botulinum neurotoxin B served as a template for the prediction of the 3-D structure of the SARS-CoV spike. 19 As previous studies of 80R have indicated that its epitope is contained within the RBD of the spike, our prediction was focused on this aspect of the modeled spike protein. Application of Mapitope entails a preliminary run of a given data set of peptides using the default parameters (STZ3, DZ9 \u00c5 , EZ5%). Such a procedure generates a first approximation of possible epitope candidates, i.e. \"clusters\". The analysis of Table 1 panel 1 gave three possible clusters designated as clusters A, B and C ( Table 2 ). The analysis of Table 1 panel 2 gave the same three clusters with an addition of a fourth cluster designated cluster D (Table 2) . Therefore, at this point each cluster was analyzed independently.",

For this, once a set of preliminary clusters is identified, the next step is to evaluate the behavior of each cluster, taking different D values ranging from 4 to 15 (the distance of carbon a to carbon a for tandem residues (n, nC1) is 3-6 \u00c5 ). Maintaining STZ3, the number of amino acids for each cluster was measured as a function of distance between two amino acids comprising a pair. As an example, Figure 2 illustrates the effect of distance on the four clusters of panel 2. Figure 2 (a) shows the change in the number of amino acids in clusters A and C and Figure 2 (b) shows the same for clusters B and D. Note that as a function of increasing the D value the number of amino acids increases, as expected. However, beyond a given point this increase gives a \"quantum jump\" in the number of amino acids associated with a given cluster, this is defined as the \"Q point\" (indicated by the gray arrows). The significant increase in the number of amino acids beyond the Q point could be the result of merging of adjacent clusters or recruitment of peripheral or underlying irrelevant amino acids thus leading to a sharp increase in the number of amino acids associated with a given D value. For example, for cluster A the jump is at 12 \u00c5 , going from 11 amino acid residues to 31, for cluster D the Q point is at 13.5 \u00c5 (from 30 to 55 amino acid residues in the cluster; see Figure 2 (a)). The Q points for clusters A, B and C in the first panel (42 peptides) and for clusters A-D in the second panel (18 peptides) are shown in Figure 2 (c).",

Residues 455-463 form an ascending strand that then crosses over as a traversing segment (residues 463-472) followed by the descending segment (residues 473-476). The distance maintained by five hydrogen bonds between the ascending and descending segments is about 5 \u00c5 , which is shorter than the limits of the traversing segment (13.4 \u00c5 ) . This therefore imposes a force flipping the traversing segment forward (viewing the ascending segment on your right). The orientation and position of this segment is stabilized by the disulfide between Cys467 and Cys474 and a series of nine hydrogen bonds cross-linking the top of the structure within itself and to the ascending and descending segments.",

By altering the parameters D and ST, one recognizes that cluster C uses fewer SSPs and of lower ST values (variation in parameter E, surface accessibility, had little bearing on ranking the significance of the clusters). Nonetheless, a dilemma remained; can one discriminate between clusters A and B and identify that cluster which might be the better prediction of the genuine 80R epitope? Here the strength of using a high resolution atomic structure based on empirical X-ray analysis of the antigen's crystal becomes apparent; cluster A, as determined when using the coordinates of the crystal structure of the RBD becomes markedly more significant than cluster B. This provided us a firm basis to focus on cluster A as most likely being the 80R epitope.

One approach for this is to use theoretical models of the antigen, based on sequence alignment with an alternative proteintemplate whose atomic structure has already been worked out. 32, [35] [36] [37] Of specific relevance is the study by Myers et al. in which they used a panel of affinity purified phage displayed peptides to assist in the localization of the epitope corresponding to the MICA3 and MICA4 mAbs that bind the major diabetes antigen, glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD65). Their analyses identified five different prospective solutions which were further studied via mutagenesis. Here we present for the first time a comparative study between predictions based on a theoretical model of the SARS-CoV spike on the one hand and on the recently published crystal structure of the SARS-CoV RBD on the other. As described previously, there is about 50% correspondence between the two structures, nonetheless it appears that this level of similarity is sufficient, as Mapitope analyses of the peptide panels predicted three clusters for each structure that shared 50-70% identity between them (comparing the cluster of the theoretical model with the crystal structure; see Figure 6 . Presentation of the cluster A and the common amino acids predicted by both the theoretical model and genuine structure of the spike RBD in the crystal structure of the complex of the SARS-CoV S protein RBD and receptor ACE2. 20 The spike RBD is shown in cornflower blue. The ACE2 is presented in green. Cluster A (residues 450-480 of the spike) are colored red. The predicted common residues (highlighted in Table 5 ) are colored in yellow. Tables 2 and 5 ). This is an extremely intriguing result as it illustrates the potential of Mapitope analyses in situations where crystal structures are not available. The construction of theoretical models is almost routine where sequence homologies can be identified and as such all that is then necessary is to screen the mAb of interest against phage libraries so to produce a satisfactory peptide database and apply the algorithm for epitope prediction.",

            "text": "Although empirical approaches may lead to successful vaccine development, rational design of epitope-based vaccines using proven neutralizing mAbs as templates for epitope discovery is an important and worthwhile goal that could be applied to other new and emerging infectious diseases. This approach may eliminate the unwanted induction of non-neutralizing and enhancing antibodies that have been documented in SARS, dengue fever 38 and respiratory syncytial virus. 39 This property may be inherent even in subunit vaccines because of the proximity of these epitopes to the neutralizing epitopes that are sought. For this reverse immunological approach, one must be able to backtrack from the selected mAb to its corresponding epitope and ultimately reconstitute the epitope into a functional immunogen. The current study focuses on the first aspect of this paradigm, i.e. the discovery of a neutralizing epitope of the SARS-CoV protein. The 80R mAb is a very attractive case in point as it has been shown to be extremely potent in virus inactivation in vitro and in vivo. Analysis of the mechanism of action has led to the conclusion that the mAb interferes with virus:receptor binding; however, identifying the specific residues involved in 80R binding, i.e. the precise composition of its epitope, is still a formidable challenge, especially in view of the fact that the epitope has been shown to be conformational. 3, 17 While our studies provide a demonstration of a robust computational approach that can be applied to neutralizing epitope discovery and a roadmap of how these advances may be applied in the future, the value of these predictions will ultimately be determined in functional studies where the reconstructed and stabilized neutralizing epitopes based on the cluster predictions are tested in vaccine studies and when the 80R:S1 protein cocrystal is solved.",

Non-specifically absorbed phages were removed by intensive washings. Specific bound phages were eluted, neutralized, amplified and used for further selections as described. 40, 41 Randomly picked single phage clones were screened for specific binding to 80R scFv by ELISA after three rounds of panning. In brief, 96 well Maxisorp immuno-plates were coated with 0.5 mg/well of 80R scFv or a control scFv, blocked with PBS containing 4% (w/v) non-fat milk. Then, individual phage-peptide clones in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 2% non-fat milk were added. Specific bound phages were detected by adding HRP-conjugated mouse anti-His 6 and the system was developed by adding TMB substrate. Absorbance at 450 nm was measured. Clones that bound to 80R scFv with A 450 values of O1.0 were scored as positive, whereas negative clones gave values of !0.2.
