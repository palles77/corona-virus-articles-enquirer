( , 1978 , they could be classified as a virus group of their own. Broad scale investigations by Mclntosh (1969 Mclntosh ( , 1970 Mclntosh ( , 1974 , Wyatt et al. (1974) , Bridger et al. (1978) , and Oshiro (1973) have shown that the viruses of the corona group can be the causative organisms of diverse infectious diseases in man and animals. They cause infectious bronchitis in hens, hepatitis in mice, tracheobronchitis and gastrointestinal diseases in humans, and intestinal diseases in cattle. Cartwright and Lucas (1970) regard the coronaviruses as the infectious agent for a certain form of encephalomyelitis in pigs. Demyelination diseases induced by coronavirus infections were also demonstrated in mice (Herndon et al. 1975) and there is an increasing number of reports that a coronavirus infection also plays a role in multiple sclerosis in man (Tanaka et al. 1976; Burks et al. 1980) . Similar to the Epstein-Barr virus, the coronaviruses thus appear to be ubiquitously occurring pathogens which give rise to the most diverse lesion patterns depending on the site of infection. For both virus groups, the Epstein-Barr virus (DNA virus) and the coronavirus (RNA virus), a normal infection of the population is known (Henle et al. 1979; Mclntosh 1974) . The EBV titer, especially the IgG and IgA component in serum, is significantly raised in patients with infectious mononucleosis and in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma. The immunoglobulins of the M group are raised exclusively in acute stages of mononucleosis but not in NPC (Henle et al. 1979; De Schryver et al. 1969 , 1972 Hsu et al. 1974) . Arnold et al. (1979a Arnold et al. ( , b, 1980a described inclusions resembling coronaviruses in the cytoplasm of the tumor cells in NPC for the first time. They found identical particles in the tumor cells of NPC in the tumor cells of the metastasis and after transplantation of tumor tissue to nude mice. However, Prasad and Gogusev (1978) found strikingly similar structures in NPC tumor cells, although they were not discussed as coronaviruses. Moses et al. (1968) described similar structures in cultures of lymphoid cells of the blood of patients with infectious mononucleosis.",

We attempted to demonstrate an antigen-antibody reaction in the cytoplasm of tumor cell smears of NPC using the serum of individuals with a high anticorona titer. As controls, we used an anticorona serum derived from rabbits. Since the virological centers available at present do not carry out any serum determinations for antibody against coronaviruses, we have developed a test model of our own for this purpose. The sera were diluted 1 : 10, 1 : 20, 1 : 40, etc. The reaction was read off only up to the dilution at which an unequivocal cytoplasmic fluorescence was still present. The EBV titers of the NPC sera had previously been determined by the laboratories of Prof. zur Hausen (Freiburg) and Dr. Wolf (Munich) . The greater part of the sera from NPC patients used in this study was supplied by Prof. zur Hausen and Dr. Wolf. We should like to thank them for their help. The sera from mononucleosis patients derived from the Institute for Medical Microbiology and Virology, University of Dfisseldorf. The diagnosis had been made via the demonstration of heterophilic antibodies with the bovine erythyrocyte lysin test (BELT) (Mai 1959) .",

For the immunofluorescence tests OFT), uninfected MRC cell suspension with an approximate cell density of 104 cells/ml was prepared. Of this suspension 100 ml were inoculated with 2 ml of the coronavirus cultures. Afterwards, tissue culture cups were charged with 100 ~tl/cup, sealed under sterile conditions, and incubated for 2 days at 37 ~ C until a hint of a CPE became recognizable. After removing the medium, the cultures were air-dried for 15 min and fixed for 2 min with methanol at -70 ~ C. Methanol residues were removed by two washings with ice-cooled PBS (pH 7.2).

Due to the measurement design in stages, only certain values can be measured (in this example, the values jumped by the factor 2 in each case). On the other hand, the medians do not require any assumptions with regard to the distribution of the concentration and hence cannot lead to misinterpretations of the distribution, as is the case for geometric means in this example. 1 and 2 show the EBV-VCA antibody patterns in a control group and in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma.

Exclusively in terms of the morphological appearance, it could not be denied that the particles situated in the cytoplasm of the tumor cells have a similarity with the representative diagrams of coronaviruses reproduced by Oshiro (1973) . However, until today not only are corresponding immunologic data lacking, but coronaviruses have also not been isolated from the tumor material nor have coronavirus-specific nucleic acids been demonstrated in NPC tumor tissues. In our opinion, the demonstration of identical virus particles not only in the tumor cells of the primary tumor, but also in the cells of the metastasis and in the tumor cells of the xenotransplant (Arnold et al. 1980a ) fundamentally excluded a possible contamination. On the other hand, the demonstration of coronaviruses in the cytoplasm of tumor cells of the nasopharynx would not be surprising on its own, since patients with extensive tumors of the nasopharynx also suffer from a chronic nasopharyngeal infection as a rule. Furthermore, coronaviruses can be demonstrated regularly in the flushing fluids even in healthy subjects after flushing of the nasopharynx (Mclntosh et al. 1969 (Mclntosh et al. , 1974 .",

A correlation is shown similar to the well-known EBV titer distribution. The evidently close correlation between EBV and coronaviruses also becomes evident from the corresponding results in infectious mononucleosis. Similar to the way in which EBV nuclear antigens can be identified by immunofluorescence microscopy in NPC tumor cells with the EBNA test, corona antigens can be demonstrated in the cytoplasm of tumor cells of the same patient. A possible non-specific reaction could be excluded by use of animal corona antisera.",
