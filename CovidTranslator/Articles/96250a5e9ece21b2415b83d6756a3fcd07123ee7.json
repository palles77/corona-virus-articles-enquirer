To provide a swift response to a novel outbreak, prior knowledge from similar outbreaks is essential. Here, we study the volume of research conducted on previous coronavirus outbreaks, specifically SARS and MERS, relative to other infectious diseases by analyzing over 45 million papers from the last 20 years. Our results demonstrate that previous coronavirus outbreaks have been understudied compared to other viruses. We also show that the research volume of emerging infectious diseases is very high after an outbreak and drops drastically upon the containment of the disease. This can yield inadequate research and limited investment in gaining a full understanding of novel coronavirus management and prevention. Independent of the outcome of the current COVID-19 outbreak, we believe that measures should be taken to encourage sustained research in the field.",

According to the World Health Organization, out of the top-10 causes of death globally, three are infectious diseases [1] . In light of the continuous emergence of infections, the burden of infectious diseases is expected to become even greater in the near future [2, 3] Currently, the world is struggling with a novel strain of coronavirus that emerged in China during late 2019 and by the time of this writing has infected more than 156,000 people and killed more than 5,800 [4, 5] . COVID-19 is the latest and third serious human coronavirus outbreak in the past 20 years. Additionally, of course, there are several more typical circulating seasonal human coronaviruses causing respiratory infections. It is still too early to predict the epidemic course of COVID-19, but it is already a pandemic which currently appears more difficult to contain than its close relative SARS-CoV [6, 7] .",

We particularly focus on public health crises, such as SARS, influenza (including seasonal, pandemic H1N1, and avian influenza), MERS, and Ebola virus disease, and compare them to HIV/AIDS and viral hepatitis B and C, three bloodborne viruses that are associated with a significant global health burden for more than two decades.",

About 0.47% of virology studies and 7 \u00b7 10 \u22125 % of all studies from the past 20 years involved human coronaviruses, while HIV/AIDS accounts for 8.1% of all virology studies. We observed that, unlike the research in the domain of HIV/AIDS and avian influenza that has been published at a high and steady pace over the last 20 years, SARS was studied at an overwhelming rate after the 2002-2003 outbreak and then sharply dropped after 2005 ( Figure 3 ). Additionally, we noticed that the SARS research community had a smaller percentage of relatively prolific researchers than other diseases. Moreover, researchers with multiple papers related to SARS published on average 3.8 papers, while hepatitis C researchers published on average 5.2 papers during the same period. When it comes to global collaboration and research efforts, most of the research stemmed from China and the US (Figure 1 ) with only about 17% of SARS papers' first authors being located in Europe. Overall, researchers from 57 and 67 countries have studied MERS and SARS, respectively. However, the vast majority of SARS papers (73%) were written by researchers in only 6 countries ( Figure 8) .",

Also, with the level of granularity of ProMED data, it is very challenging to predict the frequency that diseases are going to accrue. In 2008, Jones et al. [2] analyzed the global temporal and spatial patterns of emerging infectious diseases (EIDs). They analyzed 305 EIDs between 1940 and 2004 and demonstrated that the threat of EIDs to global health is increasing. The same year, Freifeld et al.

They used the fact that many people search online before going to doctors, and they found that during a pandemic, the volume of searches differs from normal. They then created a mathematical model to forecast the spread of flu. This research was later converted into a tool called Google Flu Trends, and at its peak, Google Flu Trends was deployed in 29 countries worldwide. However, not everything worked well for Google Flu Trends; in 2009, it underestimated the flu volume, and in 2013, it predicted more than double the number of cases than the true volume [13] . As a result of such discrepancies, Google shut down the Google Flu Trends website in 2015 and transferred its data to academic researchers [14] . Also in 2009, Carneiro and Mylonakis [15] used large amounts of data to predict flu outbreaks a week earlier than prevention surveillance systems. Similar to Ginsberg et al. [12] , they used Google Trends as a data source, but instead of only monitoring seasonal flu, they monitored avian influenza and West Nile virus. Since there was a constant growth in the number of Google searches, they normalized the data to get meaningful results. They found a correlation between web searches about influenza and the CDC data.",

Also the same year, Salath\u00e9 and Khandelwal [19] analyzed Twitter and demonstrated that it is possible to use social networks to study not only the spread of infectious disease but also vaccinations. They found a correlation between the sentiment in tweets toward an influenza vaccine and the vaccination rate. In 2013, Yuan et al.

It can be observed that HIV alone is responsible for 20% of all studies, and hepatitis B and C together are holding 8.2% of all infectious disease studies. In terms of Normalized Paper Rate (see Figure 3) , after the first SARS outbreak, there was a peak in publishing SARS-related papers with NPR twice as high as Ebola's. However, the trend dropped very quickly, and a similar phenomenon can be observed for the swine flu pandemic. The MERS outbreak achieved a much lower NPR than SARS, specifically more than 16 times lower when comparing the peaks in SARS and MERS trends.

We discovered that for SARS, MERS, the swine flu, and Ebola, Q1 publication trends were almost parallel to their NPR trends (see Figures 3 and 5) . Also, we noticed that HIV, avian influenza, influenza, and hepatitis B and C have steady publication numbers in Q1 journals. Looking at papers in highly ranked journals ( Figure  6 ), we observed that the diseases which are being continuously published in top-10 ranked journals are mainly persisting diseases, such as HIV and influenza. Additionally, we inspected how the average journal ranking of publications by disease has changed over time (Figure 7) . We found that only MERS had a decline of JScore.

We compared the research of these two coronavirus epidemics to seven other emerging viral infectious diseases as comparators. To this end, we used multiple bibliometric datasets, fusing them to get additional insights. Using this data, we explored the research of epidemiology from the perspectives of papers, journals, authors, and international collaborations. By analyzing the results presented in Section 4, the following can be noted: First, the surge in infectious disease publications (Figure 2 ) supports the results of Fire and Guestrin [33] that found there has been a general escalation of scientific publications. We found that the growth in the number of infectious disease publications is very similar to other fields. Hence, Goodhart's Law 6 did not skip the world of virology research. However, alongside the general growth in the number of papers, we observed that there was a decline in the relative number of papers on the specific infectious diseases we inspected. The most evident drastic drop in the publication rate happened after an epidemic ended. It appears that, for a short while, many researchers study an outbreak, but later their efforts are reduced. This is strengthened by considering the average number of multiple papers per author for each disease (see Table 2 ).",

            "text": "Second, when looking at journal publications, we noted very similar patterns occurred for citations and publications. This result emphasizes that fewer publications, and hence fewer citations, translate into fewer papers in Q1 journals ( Figure 5 ). Also, we observed the same patterns as Fire and Guestrin [33] , with most of the papers being published in Q1 journals and the minority published in Q2-Q4 journals. This trend started to change when zooming in and analyzing publications in top-10 ranked journals ( Figure 6 ). While we can see some correlation to outbreaks in Ebola, swine flu, and SARS, it is harder to interpret the curve of HIV since there were no focused epidemics in the past 20 years but a global burden, and we did not observe similar patterns in publications and citations. Observing the JScore (Section 3.2.2) results (Figure 7) , most diseases showed a steady increase, but two diseases behaved rather anomalously. MERS had a decline since 2013, which is reasonable to expect after the initial outbreak, but we did not see the same trends in the other diseases and there is a general trend of increasing average SJR [33] . The second anomaly is that SARS had an increase in JScore alongside a decrease in citations and publication numbers. Inspecting the data, we discovered that in 2017 there were three published papers in Lancet Infectious Diseases and in 2015 two papers in Journal of Experimental Medicine about SARS, and both journals have a very high SJR. These publications increased the JScore drastically. Third, we observed that on average authors write a fewer number of multiple papers on diseases that are characterized by large epidemics, such as the swine flu and SARS. On the other side of the scale are hepatitis C and HIV, which are persistent viral diseases with high global burdens. These diseases involve more prolific authors. Regarding Ebola and MERS, it is too early to predict if they will behave similarly to SARS since they are relatively new and require further follow up.",

Here, we explored how previous coronavirus outbreaks and other emerging viral epidemics have been studied over the last two decades. From inspecting the research outputs in this field from several different angles, we demonstrate that the interest of the research community in an emerging infection is temporarily associated with the dynamics of the incident and that a drastic drop of interest is evident after the initial epidemic subsides. This translates into limited collaborations and a non-sustained investment in the research of the coronavirus. Such a short-lived investment may also involve reduced funding (not evaluated herein) and may slow down important developments such as new drugs, vaccines, or preventive strategies. There has been an unprecedented explosion of publications on COVID-19 since January 2020 and also a significant allocation of research funding. We believe the lessons learned from scientometrics of previous epidemics argue that regardless of the outcome of COVID-19, efforts to sustain research in this field should be made.",
