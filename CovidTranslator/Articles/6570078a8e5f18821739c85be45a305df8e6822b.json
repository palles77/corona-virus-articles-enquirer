            "text": "Sialyl-Lewis X and H-antigen are fucosylated carbohydrates in which fucose is bound in an \u03b11,3or an \u03b11,2-glycosidic manner to N-acetylglucosamine and galactose, respectively. Furthermore, the \u03b11,4-fucosylated Lewis blood group antigens are missing in patients with LAD II. 2 The absence of fucose in different glycosidic linkages on multiple glycans strongly argues against a specific fucosyl transferase deficiency in LAD II and in favor of a more general defect in the fucose metabolism. Fucose is utilized by fucosyltransferases in the Golgi complex as guanosine diphosphatefucose, which is synthesized in the cytoplasm and imported into the organelle; 90% of GDP-fucose biosynthesis occurs by conversion of GDP-mannose, which itself originates from mannose uptake into the cell or from fructose 6phosphate. 4 The remaining 10% is made by a fucose salvage pathway from degraded glycoconjugates or from exogenous fucose. 5 Previous evidence suggests that LAD II is caused by a de-Leukocyte adhesion deficiency II was first described in 2 nonrelated children, each from consanguineous parents by Etzioni et al 1 and Frydman et al 2 in 1992 . No other living patient has been identified since, but a recent study described the biochemical investigation of cells derived from an abortus of 1 of the 2 families. 3 The described children with LAD II had a common spectrum of clinical findings. Physical examination reveals a flat face with a broad and depressed nasal bridge, anteverted nostrils, long eyelashes, short arms and legs, and L Leukocyte adhesion deficiency II syndrome, a generalized defect in fucose metabolism Thorsten Marquardt, MD 2 Crowded toes were reported in one patient. In both children there is a severe failure to thrive and considerable psychomotor retardation. Magnetic resonance imaging scans of the brain show frontal cerebral atrophy. Laboratory investigations reveal highly elevated numbers of peripheral neutrophils. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis of neutrophil antigens reveals a characteristic absence of sialyl-Lewis X, a carbohydrate structure that is required for the rolling of neutrophils on endothelial cells before extravasation. Blood group typing of Leukocyte adhesion deficiency II has been described in only 2 patients; herein we report extensive investigation of another patient. The physical stigmata were detected during prenatal ultrasonographic investigation. Sialyl-Lewis X (sLe x ) was absent from the surface of polymorphonuclear neutrophils, and cell binding to E-and P-selectin was severely impaired, causing an immunodeficiency. The elevation of peripheral neutrophil counts occurred within several days after birth. A severe hypofucosylation of glycoconjugates bearing fucose in different glycosidic links was present in all cell types investigated, demonstrating that leukocyte adhesion deficiency II is not only a disorder of leukocytes but a generalized inherited metabolic disease affecting the metabolism of fucose.

Sialyl-Lewis X is a carbohydrate structure of neutrophils, which is necessary for the interaction with selectins expressed on endothelial cells. The binding to E-and P-selectin is essential for the rolling of neutrophils on the endothelial cell layer before extravasation. Biotinylated soluble selectin fusion proteins were used to test the selectin binding of the patient's granulocytes. 7 A severely decreased capacity of the patient's granulocytes for the binding to E-and P-selectin was found (Fig 5, C and D) , indicating the absence of sLe x -like carbohydrate structures that could serve as selectin ligands. These results indicate the absence of \u03b11,3-fucosylation in the LAD II cells.",

The presence of blood group O was concluded, because the patient's erythrocytes did not react with anti-A or anti-B sera. Because the sera of newborns normally do not contain isoagglutinins 13 and because erythrocytes are not routinely checked for the presence of H-antigen (because of the rarity of Bombay blood groups in western Europe), the Bombay phenotype of the patient was missed at this time. At 6 months of age, the O h Bombay blood group phenotype was detected. Conventional analysis was difficult, because 4 blood transfusions with O RhD-negative erythrocyte concentrates were done at 9, 18, 106, and 107 days of life to treat anemia caused by prematurity and several severe systemic infections. For this reason, a monoclonal antibody for H-antigen was used to search for H-antigen expression on the surface of the patient's erythrocytes and to distinguish the transfused erythrocyte population from that of the patient. The FACS profile of the patient's erythrocytes was identical to genuine Bombay blood. When anti-H antibodies were used, only a small population of transfused erythrocytes with H-antigen expression was detected 2.5 months after the last transfusion (Fig 5, E) , indicating that \u03b11,2-fucosylation is not occurring either.",

In leukocytes and thrombocytes a marked decrease of the lectin binding was found in the LAD II cells. Most of granules of the control leukocytes were strongly labeled with UEA, whereas the granules of the patient's leukocytes were only weakly labeled. The neutrophil preparations contained a few platelets in which granules and plasma membrane revealed many UEA binding sites. In contrast, the platelets of the patient were free of UEA labeling (Fig 6) . UEA binding was modestly reduced in the patient's fibroblasts. The results confirm the hypofucosylation of different cell types in LAD II. 7 To control for unspecific binding to unblocked Fc receptors on the cell surface, a VE-cadherin-IgG fusion protein was used (blue). VE-cadherin does not have a specific binding to neutrophil surface antigens. 8 Because binding of selectins to their ligands is Ca 2+ -dependent, selectin binding was investigated both in the presence (red) and absence (green) of calcium. In control cells, selectin binding, which can be completely suppressed in the absence of calcium, occurs. In LAD II cells, very little selectin binding is observed, which does not change in the absence of divalent cations. D, P-selectin binding. In contrast to control cells, only a small decrease of P-selectin binding was observed in the absence of calcium. E, H-antigen expression on erythrocytes.",

Peripheral leukocyte counts were constantly elevated after the third day of life and eventually led to the diagnosis of the disorder. Coming from a sterile intrauterine environment, surgery necessitated by the meconium ileus on the first day of life might have triggered the release of neutrophil granulocytes from the bone marrow, leukocytes, which then were unable to extravasate from the blood stream because of sLe x deficiency. Impaired extravasation led to many infectious complications, which were the predominant clinical problem during the first year of life.",

This sugar nucleotide is generated in the cytoplasm predominantly from GDP-mannose and then imported into the Golgi complex, where it is transferred to glycoconjugates by different fucosyltransferases. The generalized hypofucosylation found in LAD II suggests a decreased availability of GDP-fucose for the different fucosylation processes. The exact molecular defect of LAD II has not been identified yet. In contrast to other reports, the conversion of GDP-mannose to GDP-fucose is not affected in our patient with LAD II. 16 Fucose supplementation can correct the defect in the fibroblasts of our patient and is currently elucidated in vivo in our patient. The nature of the molecular defect and the benefit of fucose therapy are currently under investigation.",
