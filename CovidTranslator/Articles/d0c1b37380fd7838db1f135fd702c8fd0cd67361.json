SARS quickly obtained the status of the first pandemic of the twenty-first century. 3, 4 In this work we focus on the SARS epidemic in the city of Beijing (China) during the year 2003. SARS usually spreads by person-to-person transmission. The virus transmits most readily by respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes. The virus can also spread when a person touches a surface or object contaminated with infectious droplets and then touches his/her mouth, nose or eyes. In addition, it is possible that the SARS virus might spread more broadly through the air (airborne spread) or by other ways that are not now known. 5 Naturally, composite space-time variations, disease parameters and determinants ( proximity to infected persons, population density, number of doctors, etc.) are essential features of the SARS epidemic. 6 Understanding these features is critical for the scientific representation of the epidemic and the efficient control of its transmission.",

Similarly, the procedure generating epidemiologic curves 19 (i.e. curves showing the day-to-day rate of SARS growth) does not account for important associations between epidemic characteristics and dominant space-time disease patterns and dependencies. Despite the aforementioned limitations of the mainstream approaches, it is highly desirable to develop methods that can incorporate the scattered and incomplete datasets generated by various surveillance systems 20 -22 and by different programmatic and sectoral actions 23 in order to evaluate salient associations between epidemic determinants and quantify consequential space-time variations and patterns.",

Epidemic determinants and the relevant statistics are pair-wise linked in a space-time context, which means that the study of determinant associations can considerably enhance the mainstream epidemic analysis and improve the understanding of previously undetected relationships within the epidemic system. Several interesting findings were obtained. Spatial neighbourhood is a major component of epidemic spread modelling, whereas coupling spatial transmission with population density and healthcare workers was sporadically significant. Changes in the spatial spread of SARS over time indicated which intervention measures are likely to be most effective at different phases of the outbreak. When the epidemic is growing via diffused infection, efficient intervention measures include isolating cases and reducing inter-regional movement. When cases of the disease appear in clusters, resources should be directed towards curbing transmission within localities that have a high incidence of infection. Our results suggested that improving control measures at the local level would have been the most efficient approach, before the end of April, 2003. Local intervention strategies include quarantine of family members. Once these measures take effect, transmission is reduced substantially and becomes dominated by more remote contacts. The evidence that diffusion of infections drove the declining stage of the outbreak may indicate that the measures were successfully controlling local transmission.",

In this study, the datasets are managed by the GIS software ARCGIS (http://www. esri.com/software/arcgis/). The hierarchical clustering is implemented by the Crimestat software (http://www.icpsr. umich.edu/CRIMESTAT/). Moran's coefficient I M is calculated using the GeoDA software (http://www.geoda.uiuc. edu/). Wavelet decomposition and SSEIR are computed using Matlab (http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/CRIMESTAT/), and the BW test is performed using software compiled by the authors. Primary training on GIS and spatial statistics are needed in order to operate the above software.",

Also, epidemiologic curves have been generated that display the day-to-day rate of SARS growth 19 but without accounting for the 'spatial pattern-time process-driving forces' associations of the epidemic. Only a limited number of studies have attempted to partially represent and evaluate determinant associations and links between separate statistics under conditions of uncertainty.",

Advanced mathematical modelling of an epidemic could potentially unveil the relationships between various determinants, but this modelling is often impossible due to the unavailability of the necessary scientific knowledge, including a lack of understanding of the fundamental disease mechanisms. 35, 36 Nevertheless, the present study shows that using the available datasets an informative modelling approach can be developed that is based on the pairwise linking of epidemic determinants and the formulation of a network that systematically connects the relevant statistics. In addition, unlike earlier SARS modelling studies, 5 the present approach accounts in an efficient manner for the spatial variation of the data available. This approach is particularly useful when the disease mechanisms are not clear and the corresponding mathematical model is difficult to develop for reasons mentioned above. Moreover, the approach can be successfully implemented to simulate the response of SARS transmission to various epidemic control factors, identify target areas and determine the critical time and relevant factors. Given the response by individuals, institutions and governments to a new and dangerous disease, the findings of the present study can be useful in the implementation of efficient epidemic intervention strategies and effective population protection policies.",

The latter are available primarily in cases in which the fundamental disease mechanisms (molecular biology, etc.) are well understood. In this sense, SARS modelling could benefit from future developments in basic scientific research in disease etiology and mathematical theories of epidemic propagation, as well as from sophisticated surveillance capabilities and metaanalysis. Furthermore, the present SARS modelling could be improved by considering epidemic variation and dependence in a composite space-time continuum under conditions of multi-sourced uncertainty. This may involve a combination of random field theories with temporal GIS techniques.",

The statistics functions and spatial analysis techniques described above can be readily applied to the study of epidemics other than SARS. Furthermore, the methodological framework is not limited to the statistical tools and datasets considered in this paper, but is more general and flexible, in the sense that it may include additional information sources, statistics functions and models; and it can allow the performance of other types of logical inferences, thus generating new findings and conclusions concerning the epidemic under investigation. By generalizing the current approach within the context of random field theories with temporal GIS techniques, one may consider additional issues related to the next generation of (stochastic) SARS models allowing for space-time variations, multi-sourced uncertainty, seasonality and varying transmission modes, the case of SARS virus long-time persistence, and examining the case of global eradication rather than local control in terms of early epidemic detection measures.",
