            "text": "During RNA virus replication, there is the potential to incorporate mutations that affect virulence or pathogenesis. For liveattenuated vaccines, this has implications for stability, as replication may result in mutations that either restore the wildtype phenotype via reversion or compensate for the attenuating mutations by increasing virulence (pseudoreversion). Recent studies have demonstrated that altering the mutation rate of an RNA virus is an effective attenuation tool. To validate the safety of low-fidelity mutations to increase vaccine attenuation, several mutations in the RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase (RdRp) were tested in the live-attenuated Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus vaccine strain, TC-83. Next generation sequencing after passage in the presence of mutagens revealed a mutant containing three mutations in the RdRp, TC-83 3x, to have decreased replication fidelity, while a second mutant, TC-83 4x displayed no change in fidelity, but shared many phenotypic characteristics with TC-83 3x. Both mutants exhibited increased, albeit inconsistent attenuation in an infant mouse model, as well as increased immunogenicity and complete protection against lethal challenge of an adult murine model compared with the parent TC-83. During serial passaging in a highly permissive model, the mutants increased in virulence but remained less virulent than the parent TC-83. These results suggest that the incorporation of low-fidelity mutations into the RdRp of live-attenuated vaccines for RNA viruses can confer increased immunogenicity whilst showing some evidence of increased attenuation. However, while in theory such constructs may result in more effective vaccines, the instability of the vaccine phenotype decreases the likelihood of this being an effective vaccine strategy.",

            "text": "Due to the error-prone nature of the RNA-dependent RNApolymerase (RdRp), RNA virus replication is characterized by a high mutation rate that results in increased genetic diversity of progeny viruses (Domingo et al. 2005) . This diversity can be utilized by the virus to evade and escape the immune system, as well as to adapt to new hosts. Maintaining the correct amount of virus diversity of $1 mutation per genome (Nebot et al. 2010) is of utmost importance to RNA virus survival within the host and during transmission. This is especially true for arboviruses (arthropod borne viruses), which utilize two distinct hosts to complete their transmission cycle. If the mutation rate of an RNA virus is too high, more unfit progeny will be produced due to the increased number of mutations, most of which are deleterious by chance. This results in a substantial decrease in viable genomes, and possible extinction of the viral population due to error catastrophe (Manrubia et al. 2010) . Conversely, if the mutation rate is too low, little variation is produced, and the virus population becomes clonal and less able to adapt to diverse environments. Both scenarios reduce the overall fitness of the virus and can lead to extinction (Escarm\u00eds et al. 2008 ). This predicted lack of fitness with high-or low-fidelity replication has been demonstrated experimentally with a number of viruses, including poliovirus (PV) (Pfeiffer and Kirkegaard 2003; Vignuzzi et al. 2006) , chikungunya virus (CHIKV) (Coffey et al. 2011; Rozen-Gagnon et al. 2014 ), West Nile virus (Van Slyke et al. 2015) , St Louis encephalitis virus (Griesemer et al. 2017) , human enterovirus 71 (Sadeghipour and McMinn 2013; Sadeghipour et al. 2013; Meng and Kwang 2014) , foot and mouth disease virus (Arias et al. 2008; Zeng et al. 2013 Zeng et al. , 2014 Xie et al. 2014) , SARS CoV (Eckerle et al. 2010; Graham et al. 2012; Graepel et al. 2017) , influenza virus (Cheung et al. 2014; Pauly et al. 2017) , Norovirus (Arias et al. 2016) and Coxsackie B virus (Gn\u00e4 dig et al. 2012; Levi et al. 2010; McDonald et al. 2016) . These viruses were all subjected to treatment with nucleoside analogs such as Ribavirin or 5'Fluorouracil, which increases the mutation rate and can lead to virus extinction, or by the insertion of mutations found to change fidelity in other viruses. Virus populations circumvent extinction by developing resistance to the nucleoside analog, sometimes by developing mutations in the RdRp that either increase (high fidelity) or decrease (low fidelity/hypermutator) RdRp fidelity (i.e. the RdRp error-rate). When compared with unpassaged, wild-type (wt) viruses, fidelity mutants have similar growth kinetics in vitro, but are attenuated in vivo due to the alteration of diversity produced during replication, which hampers the ability of the virus to overcome bottlenecks in the host (Pfeiffer and Kirkegaard 2005; Vignuzzi et al. 2006) .",

            "text": "The alphavirus genus, family Togaviridae, contains a number of important arboviruses that are distributed worldwide. Alphaviruses are classified as either Old World or New World viruses depending on their distribution. Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) is a New World encephalitic alphavirus that circulates continuously in an enzootic cycle in the forests and swamps of northern South America, Central America and Mexico, typically between rodents and mosquitoes. Spillover from this cycle is believed to cause tens of thousands of dead-end human infections annually (Aguilar et al. 2011) . Periodically, the virus emerges to cause epizootic cycles in equids, which can also spill over into humans, sometimes resulting in hundreds of thousands of infections (Sudia et al. 1975; Wang et al. 2001; Brault et al. 2002; Weaver et al. 2004; Anishchenko et al. 2006 ). Prior to the 1960s, equine epizootics involving high fatality rates were frequently recorded in VEEVendemic areas. Since horses remain important components of the local agricultural economies within these regions, VEEV has had a major impact on the economic output of at-risk areas (Walton and Grayson 1988) . Recent outbreaks in both Venezuela and Mexico demonstrate the ability of VEEV to re-emerge periodically from its enzootic niche (Rico-Hesse et al. 1995; Weaver et al. 1996; Oberste et al. 1998) , and some earlier outbreaks spread as far north as Texas (Lord 1974; Sudia et al. 1975) . Independent of these natural cycles of infection, there is great concern for the use of VEEV as a biological weapon due to its high infectivity via the aerosol route. To address this threat, multiple vaccines have been developed to protect against VEEV infection.",

Sequencing of TC-83 revealed eleven nucleotide changes, but attenuation was attributed to only 2 of these mutations; one in the 5' UTR (untranslated region) and one in the E2 glycoprotein gene (Kinney et al. 1989 (Kinney et al. , 1993 . The reliance of TC-83 on only two point mutations for its attenuation increases the potential for reversion during vaccination, as well as instability during manufacturing. This concern has been supported by passaging in infant mice, where TC-83 reverted in a little as three intracranial passages (Mckinney et al. 1963) . The retention of mosquito infectivity adds another safety concern for transmission from vaccinees to humans or equids, and the isolation of TC-83 from wild-caught mosquitoes in 1971 during an equine vaccination campaign underscores this risk (Pedersen et al. 1972 ). Due to these concerns, as well its incomplete immunogenicity (Mckinney et al. 1963; Alevizatos et al. 1967; Engler et al. 1992) , TC-83 is only approved for equids, but it maintains investigational new drug status for at-risk military and laboratory personnel.",

However, high mutation rates also have implications for liveattenuated vaccines (LAV's) such as TC-83, which typically generate long-lived immunity and are cost-effective. LAV replication has the potential to restore a virulent, wt phenotype via one or more reversions or pseudoreversions. Such events can lead to safety concerns and possible adverse events following immunization (Roukens and Visser 2008) . However, further increasing the natural mutation rate is also hypothesized to decrease the ability of the virus to successfully revert or pseudorevert through Muller's ratchet (Muller 1964; Chao 1990) , by the accumulation of deleterious mutations in asexual populations (e.g. viruses) during replication in the absence of efficient recombination. Additionally, deleterious mutations can also impair the ability of fitter viruses to replicate and increase in the population (Duarte et al. 1992; Escarm\u0131 s et al. 1999; Escarm\u00eds et al. 2008) . Thus, the RNA virus error rate is finely tuned to allow for optimal virus population health while also allowing for the production of mutations, which are key for adaptation to new hosts and environments.",

Repeated measures ANOVA found no significant differences between the RdRp mutants and parent TC-83 when Vero cells were treated with 0-25 mg/ml 5FU. However, treatment with higher 5FU concentrations caused titers for all single RdRp mutants to drop compared with parent TC-83, demonstrating increased sensitivity to the treatment. Of note, E37G was significantly different from parent TC-83 for all of the high 5FU concentrations (p < 0.01 for the 50 mg/ml treatment, p < 0.0001 for the 100-300ug/ml treatments). A96T was slightly more resistant, with titers significantly reduced compared with parent TC-83 when cells were treated with 100-300 mg/ml (p < 0.0001). G14R and C488Y were the most resistant to 5FU treatment of the single mutants. Titers were only significantly reduced compared with parent TC-83 for the 200-300 mg/ml treatments (p < 0.5 for G14R 300 mg/ml, p < 0.0001 for all others).

TC-83 3x and 4x were the only RdRp mutants chosen for this analysis, because they were most likely to have altered fidelity as measured by a preliminary Illumina sequencing analysis measuring the diversity of one replicate of each RdRp mutant (data not shown), as well as the phenotypic tests examined in Figs 1 and 2. Illumina sequencing showed that the 3x mutant produced a significantly higher amount of genetic diversity than parental TC-83, independent of the cell type used (Fig. 3A) . This, along with the previously discussed results, indicated that the 3x mutant is a low-fidelity variant. Interestingly, the 4x mutant did not demonstrate a significant increase or decrease in diversity compared with TC-83. Cell type had no significant effect on virus diversity, at least not after one passage. When the number of nucleotide positions containing diversity was examined (Fig. 3B ), the 3x mutant trended towards producing an increased number of positions with diversity, while the 4x mutant, again, looked much like the parent TC-83.",

The 3x and 4x RdRp mutants and TC-83 were also subjected to 10 serial intracranial passages in infant mice to determine if compensatory mutations accumulated in vivo. Passage 5 and 10 virus was injected subcutaneously into 6-day-old mice to assess changes in virulence that occurred during passaging. TC-83, TC-83 3x and TC-83 4x all gained virulence by passage 5 compared with their unpassaged counterparts as shown in Fig. 2B (Kaplan-Meier test, p 0.0001) (Fig. 7A) . At this point, the 3x and 4x mutants reached virulence equivalent to that of the original, unpassaged TC-83 with no significant difference in time to death. Interestingly, no significant changes in virulence occurred between passage 5 and 10 for any of the viruses. This indicates that TC-83 3x and 4x can only reach virulence equivalent to unpassaged TC-83, and are are unable to increase in virulence past that point. Additionally, while not statistically significant, mice inoculated with TC-83 4x passage 10 survived up to 1 week longer than mice inoculated with TC-83 4x Passage 5. This suggests that additional passaging may result in decreased fitness for this construct.",

Although LAVs tend to be cost-effective and immunogenic, LAVs have a significant Achilles' heel: the potential for reversion to wt virulence. This risk is particularly acute for RNA viruses, which replicate without proofreading, resulting in an increased ability to revert to the wt sequence or restore virulence via compensatory mutations (pseudoreversion). However, altering virus fidelity can theoretically overcome this major drawback. This approach has only been examined with fidelity mutants of PV and a low-fidelity ExoN mutant of SARS-CoV (Graham et al. 2012; Vignuzzi et al. 2008 ).

However, fidelity mutants have only been generated using wt virus strains, which are unlikely to be sufficiently attenuated for vaccine use. We hypothesized that increasing the attenuation of a live-attenuated RNA virus vaccine by altering the RdRp fidelity would further improve its safety and efficacy. We addressed this by validating a series of low-fidelity mutations in a model system using the VEEV vaccine strain TC-83 to determine how this affects the stability and attenuation. Serial passaging of TC-83 in 5-FU identified three mutations in the RdRp, and validation showed that all three mutations were required to decrease virus replication fidelity. Additionally, we identified a 4x mutant that acted much like TC-83 3x, but showed no difference in diversity after one cell culture passage.",

However, all the mutations in the 3x mutant (G14R, E37G and A96T) were at the 5' end of the nsP4 gene, similar to the placement of the PV high fidelity G64S and low fidelity H273R substitution, which are both on the periphery of the RdRp protein rather than near the active site (Pfeiffer and Kirkegaard 2003; Campagnola et al. 2015; Korboukh et al. 2014) . For PV, the presence of the G64S mutation does not significantly alter the structure of the polymerase, but it does decrease the incorporation rate of new nucleotides (Arnold et al. 2005; Marcotte et al. 2007 ). In fact, the current theory is that this substitution simply stabilizes the polymerase rather than altering the active site. Alternatively, low fidelity H273R PV decreases fidelity by favoring an open state of the RdRp, which decreases the duration of this fidelity checkpoint, thus increasing the likelihood of NTP misincorporation (Moustafa et al. 2014 ). The presence of the low-fidelity mutations outside of the predicted active domain of the TC-83 nsP4 gene suggests a similar mechanism, but confirmation will require an atomic resolution structure.",

The 4x mutant, while exhibiting phenotypic similarities with other altered fidelity mutants, had no significant difference in virus diversity compared with the TC-83 parent after one cell culture passage. However, TC-83 4x may actually be a low-fidelity variant, as suggested by the increase in diversity that occurred during in vivo passaging, which exhibited gains in diversity nearly identical to TC-83 3x. Perhaps the C488Y mutation (Coffey et al. 2011 ), a high fidelity CHIKV mutation, offers an additive effect to initially increase virus diversity to that of wt virus, while exerting additional attenuation via an unknown mechanism. However, it appears that the C488Y mutation exerts less of an effect over multiple virus replication cycles, resulting in increased virus diversity compared with parent TC-83 after passaging in vivo. Alternatively, it could be that the cumulative effect of these mutations alters the ability of the virus to explore the most beneficial sequence space as the virus replicates, leading to Muller's ratchet and decreased virus health. Indeed, this may explain why the 4x mutant initially exhibited gains in virulence during in vivo passaging, but later became more attenuated. It would be interesting to continue passaging this mutant to determine if the mutation threshold is eventually crossed, leading to error catastrophe and virus extinction. If this hypothesis is validated, the 4x construct is likely to be a safer LAV candidate than the 3x mutant. Indeed, a mixture of these two hypotheses might explain the observed TC-83 4x results.",

            "text": "Illumina sequencing uncovered many noteworthy effects during RdRp mutant growth in vitro. In particular, the E1 diversity peaks identified in TC-83 were greatly decreased for the RdRp mutants. The E1 glycoprotein is responsible for the uncoating of the virus particle and escape of the genome into the cytosol. Some substitutions in the CHIKV E1 glycoprotein (Tsetsarkin et al. 2007 (Tsetsarkin et al. , 2011 Vazeille et al. 2007) . Diversity in this region may be important for increased vector fitness and/or host jumps. When total genome diversity was analyzed for each construct, there was no significant difference in diversity when comparing cell types. This is in contradiction to the low-fidelity CHIKV mutants, which only showed increased diversity in vertebrate cells and not in mosquito cells (Rozen-Gagnon et al. 2014) . However, while no significant difference was observed in overall diversity between the cell types, TC-83 3x produced much higher peaks in diversity in C7/10 cells than was observed in other cell types or viruses. This is intriguing, because it is hypothesized that mosquitoes are drivers of diversity, likely due to the sequence specificity of the mosquito antiviral RNAi response (i.e. siRNAs), although this has only been demonstrated for West Nile virus (Brackney et al. 2009 (Brackney et al. , 2015 Grubaugh et al. 2015 Grubaugh et al. , 2017 . This hypothesis does not appear to explain the increased diversity observed during the TC-83 3x C7/10 passages, because these cells lack a functional siRNA response. Additionally, no increased hotspots were observed for U4.4 cells, which do produce antiviral siRNAs. Further work is needed to determine how these diversity hotspots correspond to small RNA targeting in mosquito cells and examine the effects of the host immune response on virus populations.",

The 3x and 4x RdRp mutants initially displayed equivalent virulence to parent TC-83 when injected into a single tissue that can cause lethal damage (brain) and reduced virulence when injected via a multi-tissue model (subcutaneous). However, when this experiment was repeated with virus rescued from different electroporation pools, the 3x and 4x mutants displayed greatly increased virulence compared with the initial subcutaneous outcome. This suggests that minority variants randomly generated during the transcription preceding electroporation can have large effects on the overall virus population health, and thus virulence. Importantly, TC-83 was always equal to or more virulent when injected subcutaneously compared with the RdRp mutants. While TC-83 is not lethal in an adult mouse model, it would be interesting to determine if the 3x and 4x mutants have consistently delayed and/or decreased dissemination compared with wt virus. This would allow for a greater understanding of how a low-fidelity vaccine would operate in a fully immunocompetent host.",

Perhaps counterintuitively, the 3x hyper mutator variant, while undergoing an initial increase in virulence during in vivo passaging, only reverted to the same level of virulence as unpassaged TC-83. This is likely due to an increased amount of unfit virions (e.g. defective interfering [DI] particles), which hamper wt virus virulence, as well as the inability of the 3x mutant to revert the inserted RdRp mutations. The passage 10 results for each virus were very similar to the passage 5 data, except for the 4x virus, which decreased in virulence so much that some infant mice were able to survive 7 extra days. This passaging data demonstrates that both of our mutants exhibit decreased risk of reversion to wt virulence compared with the parent TC-83.",

Mice showed no adverse effects from vaccination, viremia was consistent with that expected for TC-83, and all mice were protected against lethal challenge. Additionally, the mutants induced higher antibody titers than TC-83. Our current hypothesis for this observation is that the low-fidelity RdRp creates an increased number of DI virus particles, which are well known to be strong immune stimulators (Dimmock and Kennedy 1978; Mercado-L\u00f3 pez et al. 2013; Tapia et al. 2013; Sun et al. 2015) . As VEEV first amplifies in the draining lymph node (MacDonald and Johnston 2000) , the presence of these DI particles may restrict dissemination from the draining lymph node, allowing for a greater opportunity for antigen presentation and therefore an increased immune response. This needs to be explored in future work.",

However, we also observed different outcomes in low-fidelity mutant attenuation in vivo when different pools of virus stock were used, which suggests that the low-fidelity virus population might not be initially stable. This demonstrates that there is great need to understand the role that minority variants play in phenotypic changes in vaccine development, as changes in the mutant spectrum may significantly alter the phenotype of vaccines. However, the passaging results imply that the virus population stabilizes after multiple growth cycles, so low-fidelity RNA virus vaccines may require passaging to ensure a consistent vaccination phenotype. Overall, this study demonstrates that while low-fidelity mutations may be a potential tool to further develop, the initial phenotypic instability observed post electroporation suggests that this may not currently be a viable strategy for LAV development.",

Animals were euthanized 48-h post-inoculation, and their brains harvested and homogenized to determine viral titer by standard plaque assay (Beaty et al. 1995) . The homogenized brain was diluted to produce the same inoculum dose and used to initiate the subsequent passage. Virulence of the mouse passages 5 and 10 viruses was compared with the parental strain by inoculating 6-day-old CD1 mice SC with 10 5 PFU, as described earlier. Stability of the genomic sequences was assessed by RT-PCR on RNA extracted from mouse passages 5 and 10 viruses and sequenced using Illumina or Sanger sequencing, respectively. 4.7 Next generation sequencing 4.7.1 Library preparation Viral RNA from cell culture extracts were fragmented by incubation at 94 C for 8 min in 19.5 ll of fragmentation buffer Table 2 .

First and second strand synthesis, adapter ligation and amplification of the library were performed using the Illumina TruSeq RNA Sample Preparation kit as per the manufacturer's protocol. For virus isolates from animals, PCR was first done using sequence-specific primers tiled across the VEEV genome to provide amplified products of $1.5 kb in size that were used for library generation. Products were fragmented using transposons, then adapter ligation and amplification of the library was performed using the Illumina TruSeq RNA Sample Preparation kit under conditions described by the manufacturer (Illumina, San Diego, CA). Samples were tracked using the 'index tags' incorporated into the adapters as defined by the manufacturer.",

The 34 base long reads used in the analyses were validated as viral sequences and not host sequences by analysis of the longest subsequences shared explicitly (no mismatches allowed) and longest similar (1 mismatch allowed) between viral and host genomes. Diversity per position in the viral genome was calculated by taking a ratio of the reads mapped with mismatches and all reads mapped at that position. Positions in which the number of reads mapped with mismatches was higher than perfectly mapped reads or coverage was below 100 were excluded from diversity calculations. Mutation frequency per sample was calculated by summing per position diversities and normalizing by the number of positions for which diversity was calculated.
