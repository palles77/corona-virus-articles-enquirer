Obvious clinical signs were severe diarrhea (Figure 1 , panel A) and dehydration with milk curd vomitus in suckling piglets. Most of the affected farms reported the disease first in farrowing barns and subsequently lost 100% of newborn piglets. Pigs of all ages were affected and exhibited degrees of diarrhea and inappetite, which varied by their ages. Boars and sows had mild diarrhea and anorexia for a few days and recovered within a week. In piglets that died, the small intestinal wall was congested and intestinal contents were watery with undigested milk curd ( Figure 1, panel B). Segmental enteritis was indicated by segmental disappearance of intestinal lacteal caused by malabsorption in affected intestinal parts ( Figure 1 , panels C and D). Atrophic enteritis, characterized by blunting of the intestinal villi and sloughing of intestinal epithelium, occurred in all affected piglets (Figure 2 , panel A). Immunohistochemical tests, performed by using monoclonal anti-PEDV S protein (JBT Biotechnology Laboratory, Seoul, South Korea), demonstrated dark brown staining in intestinal epithelial cells (Figure 2, panel B) . Massive feedback of piglet feces and minced piglet guts to gestating sows was recommended by local veterinary practitioners to prime the sow's immune response and pass protective immunity to the piglets. At affected farms, the outbreak lasted <3 weeks.",

They were responsible for the recent PED outbreak in Thailand and able to produce pathologic effects similar to the Chinese isolates (6) . Notably, 08NP04, isolated 4 months after the first outbreak, had the highest identity to JS-2004-2. Also, 08NP04 and 07NP01 (the first isolates in 2007) originated in the same geographic area. The Chinese-like strain of the virus might have gained entry into Thailand via unknown routes as early as December 2007. In addition, rendering trucks traveling from farm to farm might have encouraged widespread transmission of the disease. Structural differences in the partial S gene could help elucidate pathogen- esis and antigenic structures of the recent PEDV isolates because S glycoproteins are responsible for inducing the virus neutralizing antibodies and known to be highly conserved in PEDV strains (7) . Continuing investigation of PEDV isolates will contribute to the prevention and control of this virus.",

Despite precautions, sporadic outbreaks continue to occur. In addition, disease transmission frequently occurs due to the purchase of new stock with improper gilt acclimatization and biosecurity. Immunity induced through vaccination, currently unavailable in Thailand, does not provide lifelong protection from this virus. However, vaccination is recommended to encourage specific immunity to PEDV in all stock when an acute outbreak occurs. Undoubtedly, effective biosecurity is a key management tool for PED prevention and control. ",

The lowest sequence identity (95.7%) was with the Korean strain, Chinju99. Similar to the M gene results, the highest sequence identity of the S gene (98.6%) was with the Chinese strain, JS-2004-2 (data not shown). Three major clusters based on the phylogenetic relation of the nucleotide sequences of the M gene (online Appendix Figure panel A, available from http://www.cdc. gov/EID/content/15/7/1112-appF.htm) were detected. The first cluster comprised all Thai isolates in 2007-2008 and 3 Chinese strains (JS-2004-2, LJB/03, and QH). The second cluster consisted of 2 Korean strains (KPEDV-9 and Chin-ju99), 1 Japanese strain (Jme2), 2 Chinese isolates (HN-XYYYP-2007 and YM 2007), and a previous Thai isolate in 2004 (M_NIAH_04). The third cluster contained Br1/87 (CV777), 2 Russian isolates, and 1 Chinese strain (LZC). On the basis of the phylogenetic relation of the nucleotide sequences of the partial S gene, 3 groups were identified (online Appendix Figure panel B). Group 1 comprised all recent Thai PEDV and the Chinese PEDV strains isolated in 2003-2004 (JS-2004-2 and LJB/03). Notably, a Thai isolate, 08NP04, was very similar to JS-2004-2. Group 2 comprised Br1/87 (LZC) and CV777. Group 3 consisted of the Korean isolates (Spk1 and Chinju99).The recent Thai PEDV strain was closely related to the isolates from China, JS-2004-2 and LJB/03. There was no insertion or deletion in the M gene of the recent Thai isolates except for minor point mutations. M_NIAH/04, isolated in 2004 in Thailand, had a slightly different nucleotide sequence from the recent Thai isolates (R. Thanawongnuwech, unpub. data).",
