            "text": "Asthma is a chronic disease that has a significant impact on quality of life and is particularly important in children and adolescents, in part due to the higher incidence of allergies in children. The incidence of asthma has increased dramatically during this time period, with the highest increases in the urban areas of developed countries. It seems that the incidence in developing countries may follow this trend as well. While our knowledge of the pathophysiology of asthma and the available of newer, safer medication have both improved, the mortality of the disease has undergone an overall increase in the past 30 years. Asthma treatment goals in children include decreasing mortality and improving quality of life. Specific treatment goals include but are not limited to decreasing inflammation, improving lung function, decreasing clinical symptoms, reducing hospital stays and emergency department visits, reducing work or school absences, and reducing the need for rescue medications. Non-pharmacological management strategies include allergen avoidance, environmental evaluation for allergens and irritants, patient education, allergy testing, regular monitoring of lung function, and the use of asthma management plans, asthma control tests, peak flow meters, and asthma diaries. Achieving asthma treatment goals reduces direct and indirect costs of asthma and is economically cost-effective. Treatment in children presents unique challenges in diagnosis and management. Challenges in diagnosis include consideration of other diseases such as viral respiratory illnesses or vocal cord dysfunction. Challenges in management include evaluation of the child's ability to use inhalers and peak flow meters and the management of exercise-induced asthma.",

However, more recent data suggest that over the past 5-10 years, the overall global trends of asthma incidence have begun to stabilize [1] . Urbanization and industrialization has contributed to the increase in developed countries, but the reasons for this are still unclear. Asthma is estimated to be responsible for one in every 250 deaths worldwide. Many of these deaths are preventable, and specific issues have been identified that may contribute to this high mortality rate. Factors that contribute to high mortality and morbidity include slow access to care and medications, inadequate environmental control of allergens and irritants, dietary changes, genetic variations, cultural barriers, lack of education among patients and providers, insufficient resources, and improper use of health care dollars.",

Hospitalizations for asthma have clearly decreased as a result of the use of controller medications. Quality of life has been identified as a significant metric to measure asthma treatment success. On the other hand, despite our improved knowledge of the pathogenesis of asthma, newer medications with fewer adverse effects, and increased standardization of treatment protocols, there has been a paradoxical increase in asthma mortality. The reasons for this observation are debatable but may include lifestyle changes [5] , dietary changes [6] , the increase in obesity rates in the Western hemisphere [7] , coding anomalies [8] , poor patient and/or caregiver education, and the overall increase in the incidence of allergies and asthma. What is clear, however, is that the development and introduction of new pharmaceuticals is not by itself the answer to improving outcomes in children with asthma. Patient education, environmental avoidance measures, proper use of medications, and immunotherapy are all equally important in the successful treatment of the pediatric asthmatic. The good news is that with our awareness of these factors, mortality has at least stabilized over the past 5 years.",

The diagnosis of asthma in children may be difficult to make in the infant because of the prevalence of viral-associated wheezing in this age group of patients. The impact of viral illness on the development of asthma in later years is addressed below, along with the role of allergies in childhood asthma. Certain medications are not always appropriate for all ages, and devices that are used to evaluate asthma status may not be usable by young children. Exercise-induced asthma (EIA) is particularly important in childhood as physical activity is critical to controlling the epidemic of obesity in developed countries, especially the USA. Lifestyle changes, including the use of television, Internet, and other video devices, may play a role in childhood asthma. Finally, the \"hygiene hypothesis\" has introduced the concept that early exposure to animals, foods, or endotoxin may actually be protective against allergic sensitization. While this is still a controversial issue, it illustrates the complexity of asthma as a heterogeneous disease, with genetic and environmental influences. Indeed, we now know that there is no single asthma gene, rather that there are multiple genetic variants that, under the proper environmental conditions, can result in asthma.",

It is estimated that up to 70% of asthma in children is associated with atopy, or allergies. Airway hyperresponsiveness, serum IgE levels, inflammatory mediator expression, and Th1/Th2 balance are four areas that may be influenced by genetics. The genes involved in regulating these processes may differ between ethnic groups. Some of these processes, such as airway hyperresponsiveness and serum IgE levels, may be co-inherited in some individuals, possibly as a result of close proximity of genes affecting both processes (chromosome 5q). Genes can also affect an asthmatic child's response to medications. This has been found to be the case for \u03b2-adrenergic agonists, glucocorticoids, and leukotriene modifiers. While studies of pharmacogenetics have so far produced more questions than answers, this is an exciting area of research because it promises the capability of generating customized care plans, or personalized medicine, that will match optimal treatment with each individual asthmatic child. Genes that are involved in asthma are now too numerous to count. An example of genes associated with asthma is shown in Table 3 .",

A good history includes current or past history of cough, wheezing, viral respiratory diseases, accompanying allergy symptoms or signs, shortness of breath, and sinus problems. It is also important to ask an exposure history, to try and determine triggers for the episodes. This can include indoor allergen exposures, outdoor pollens, viral upper respiratory infections and exercise, exposure to foods that may be causing symptoms, and an occupational history of both the child (if old enough to be working) and the parents or caregivers. Exposure to day care is also important and environmental tobacco smoke and pollution exposure should also be documented. A past medical history asking about previous hospitalizations, doctor visits, frequent otitis media, sinusitis or pneumonia, and a complete medication history, including use of nebulizers or inhalers and any other pertinent medications, should be elicited. The family history is also important, as asthma has a genetic component.",

Gaseous irritants include nitric oxide, sulfur dioxide, formaldehyde, ozone, and other volatile organic compounds. Airborne particulates can vary in size, ranging from course particulates to fine particles to ultrafine particles or nanoparticles. The smaller the particle, the greater the penetration into the airway. Particles greater than 10 \u03bcm in diameter are generally cleared in the upper airway. Although these larger particles can indirectly trigger earlyor late-phase asthma reactions by virtue of their action in the upper airways, fine and ultrafine particles present a more significant problem due to their deeper penetration into the smaller airways [26] . Recently, evidence has surfaced that these ultrafine particles indeed possess effects on inflammatory cells such as neutrophils or eosinophils that can lead to asthma symptoms. This can occur through several different mechanisms and is reviewed extensively elsewhere [26] .

However, exercise is essential to the physical and psychological development of all children. Lack of exercise also promotes obesity, which has been linked to asthma [28] . Therefore, we no longer recommend that children with asthma stop exercising. In fact, exercise can help to build lung reserve. With proper control of asthma using controller medications, a patient with exercise-induced asthma can almost always participate in regular cardiovascular training without adverse effects. Asthma can even be managed successfully in the elite athlete [29] . The severity of a patient's EIA can be evaluated using an exercise challenge test. Historically, the methodology of exercise challenge tests has been very inconsistent, but recently the American Thoracic Society has proposed a set of criteria that should be met in order to ensure an accurate and valid test [30] .

In infants, the most wellknown viral respiratory illness associated with wheezing is respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). However, rhinovirus is the more common virus in children [34, 35] , and wheezing can be associated with other viruses as well, including parainfluenza virus, influenza virus, metapneumonia virus, adenovirus, coronavirus, and picornavirus. Rhinovirus is the major pathogen associated with hospital admissions for asthma in children [36] . Transient early wheezing develops in infancy and usually resolves by 3 years of age. Risk factors include low birth weight, prematurity, maternal exposure to tobacco smoke, male gender, and upper respiratory viral infections. A second phenotype is that of the atopic wheezer. These are school age children who have a history or family history of atopy. Their wheezing may or may not be triggered by a viral infection, but they have a strong probability of continued wheezing into adolescence or adulthood. It is in this group that one would be able to detect chronic inflammatory changes in the airways. A third category, persistent early-onset wheezing, includes pre-school aged children and is usually not associated with a family history of asthma or atopy but instead is associated with acute viral respiratory infections. This group has a better long-term prognosis and symptoms may disappear when they reach school age.",

Better distinction is made between monitoring asthma control and classifying asthma severity. Severity is defined as the intrinsic intensity of asthma and is still grouped into the original classification of mild intermittent, mild persistent, moderate persistent, or severe persistent. Categorizing severity in this manner is helpful for initiating therapy. Control is defined as the response to therapy, in terms of the degree to which manifestations of asthma are kept to a minimum.

In addition, objective measurement of asthma status is important, and ongoing monitoring is also of benefit. It is clear that the development of new drugs is only a part of a more comprehensive strategy to treat asthma. In addition to drugs, non-pharmaceutical modes of treatment need to be incorporated into the asthmatic child's treatment plan. Nonpharmaceutical modes of therapy for asthma are discussed below and listed in Table 9 .",

Conversely, avoidance of such allergens may lead to resolution of the exacerbation. Thus, allergen avoidance has been recognized as an important part of an asthma management plan. The effectiveness of an allergen avoidance plan requires knowledge of the patient's sensitivities and exposure pattern. Avoidance of seasonal allergens, mainly pollens, is difficult without making unreasonable changes to one's lifestyle because these allergens are windborne and can travel for miles. On the other hand, there are well-established strategies to avoidance of indoor allergens. Because we spend up to a third of our time sleeping in close quarters with dust mites, the bedroom should have a high priority when developing an indoor allergen avoidance program. Dust mites require water to survive, and damp environments allow them to reproduce and proliferate. Keeping the relative humidity of the home around 50-55% will help keep dust mite concentrations down. In addition, the use of mattress and pillow encasings, high-efficiency particulate air filters are additional control measures that may provide benefit. The child with asthma should also probably not be the one to vacuum as the action of vacuuming can disturb dust mite reservoirs and release these particulates into the breathing zone. Good ventilation and filtration systems in the home can also help to reduce exposure. Additional measures of allergen avoidance are illustrated in Fig. 4 .",

Substrates for mold growth include decaying living material, damp paper or books, or household plants. Removal of these substrates may reduce indoor mold spore levels. As mentioned above, pollens are more difficult to avoid, but patients and their parents can glean information regarding outdoor exposures by accessing the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology National Allergy Bureau website (see Table 22 ).

Measurement of spirometry before and after bronchodilation treatment can help determine if there is reversibility of lung function. Because sometimes patient history, especially in children, can be inaccurate, spirometry provides an objective assessment of the child's condition. Spirometry can be attempted at about 4 to 5 years of age, but at these very young ages, obtaining reliable results depends on the child's ability to follow instructions and their physical coordination. Data on predicted values of spirometry parameters have been obtained by several investigators and are dependent on age, gender, height, and ethnic background. However, as in the case of peak flow measurement, there is significant individual variability, and it is important to establish each child's baseline spirometry. Obviously, as the child grows, this will change, so frequent updates may be needed. While spirometry is not diagnostic of asthma, it serves as a complementary test to the history and physical that can be used to support the diagnosis of asthma.",

Most new peak flow meters are small enough to fit in a pocket or a purse. Traditional peak flow meters are available for children and adults. The low range peak flow meters usually measure up to about 450 l/m, while the high range measure up to 800 l/m. The peak flow zonal system, based on the child's personal best peak flow, is a convenient and simple method for parents and patients to assess how they are doing, whether to administer a breathing treatment, and whether to seek additional help. Electronic versions of peak flow meters are also available. These have the advantage of being able to record and store data that can be analyzed and trended on a computer. Some of the newer electronic versions can also measure FEV1, which is considered to be a more reliable measurement of airway obstruction as it is not as dependent on patient technique or effort.

In a retrospective study of 441 patients with respiratory disease, the sensitivity and specificity for asthma were 70% and 74%, respectively. ECP was not predictive for any other respiratory disease [57] . When patients with asthma are bronchial challenged with allergen, activation of eosinophils and generation of specific eosinophilic mediators result. Evaluation and continued monitoring of eosinophil and ECP may be a way to assess efficacy of asthma therapy and airway inflammation in children with allergic asthma [58] . Both leukotriene receptor antagonists and inhaled corticosteroids have been associated with a reduction in sputum ECP levels in patients with mild to moderate persistent asthma [59, 60] . A response of serum ECP levels to glucocorticoid treatment has also been observed [61] .",

Most of these have been attributed to oral or parenteral steroids. In children with asthma, the major concerns regarding inhaled or nebulized steroids have been the effect on growth [65] [66] [67] . Studies to determine if inhaled corticosteroids indeed have such an effect are difficult to conduct because asthma itself has been associated with growth retardation [68] . Results have therefore been inconsistent; however, the bulk of the evidence suggests that even if there is growth retardation, this is usually reversible and there is a period of \"catch-up\" growth. Moreover, even if corticosteroids do indeed affect growth, the extent of growth retardation is minimal. Thus, the risk of growth retardation is small compared to the potential for serious asthma exacerbations. Adrenal suppression in children on inhaled steroids is also not a significant problem. In a study of 14 children on a dry powder beclomethasone dipropionate inhaler, there was no suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis [69] . effects on the HPA axis [70, 71] . On the other hand, use of high doses of fluticasone has been shown to cause HPA axis suppression [72] . It is not known if there is any clinical significance to these observed effects.

The currently available second-generation antihistamines in the USA are cetirizine, levocetirizine, loratadine, desloratadine, and fexofenadine. These drugs block the allergic effect of environmental allergens, but cetirizine also inhibits leukocyte recruitment and activation and eosinophil migration [80] and has been shown to decreases late leukocyte migration into antigenchallenge skin blister fluid chambers [81] . All three inflammatory cell lines, including neutrophils, eosinophils, and basophils, were affected.",

Aminophylline is metabolized to theophylline, which is then metabolized to caffeine. Theophylline acts as a phosphodiesterase inhibitor (Fig. 14) .

Table 14 shows the dosing schedule for omalizumab. Side effects include malignancies, anaphylactic reactions, and local injection reactions.

Another effect of the increase in cAMP concentration is the inhibition of mediator release from mast cells.

Dosing recommendations for shortacting \u03b2-agonist inhalers are shown in Table 15 . Albuterol, the most common used \u03b2-agonist, is available as a 0.083% nebulization solution.

Systemic steroids, administered orally or parenterally on a chronic basis, are associated with a long list of adverse effects, many of which are potentially more serious than the disease they are being used to treat. These side effects are listed in Table 11 . One important side effect that is sometimes forgotten is osteonecrosis. While corticosteroid-induced osteonecrosis is more common in autoimmune diseases and transplant patients than in asthma, one should still have a high index of suspicion when treating an asthmatic child who has been on steroids for a long time [88] . Generally speaking, a short course of steroids to treat an asthma exacerbation is acceptable from a risk benefit standpoint. In this case, if the corticosteroid course is less than 7 days, no tapering of dose is needed. A tapering schedule should be formulated for those patients in whom steroids are being used for longer than 1 week. If the patient requires multiple courses of steroids, then the possibility of developing serious side effects should be considered. There are several corticosteroids available to treat asthma exacerbations. These are shown in Table 10 . Many of the oral preparations have a very bad taste and may need to be disguised in foods in order to be able to administer them to young children.

The devices have undergone significant evolution since then and now are the most common device to carry drugs to treat asthma. Dry powder inhalers (DPI) are an alternative to metered dose inhalers. While the ability to deliver drug straight to the airways has revolutionized asthma treatment, the use of these devices in children presents some special considerations. The most important of these is the ability of young children to use these devices effectively. Specifically, this is the ability of the child to (1) understand how to use them and (2) be coordinated enough to use them accurately and effectively. Metered dose inhalers require considerable more coordination than DPIs, although spacer devices do help. If a child is found to be unable to effectively use one of these devices, then it would be much more beneficial to the asthmatic child to continue with the use of nebulizers. A comparison of the various drug delivery devices is shown in Table 16 . The table also shows the most common age at which these inhalers can typically be used, although it is important to appreciate that there is a significant variability to these ages.",

A study of 215 patients with dust mite allergy demonstrated that those patients with an FEV1 greater than 90% were four times as likely to benefit from immunotherapy to house dust mite, compared with patients with FEV1 less than 60%. Moreover, patients under the age of 20 years were three times more likely to improve than those more than 51 years of age [118] . Indications for immunotherapy include clear evidence of symptom-exposure relationship, perennial symptoms, and inadequate control with medications. Recent advances in sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) may provide another option for hyposensitization in children with allergic asthma.",

If there is time, measurement of peak flow or spirometry done prior to and after the treatment can help to evaluate the effectiveness of the treatment, but one should not delay treatment if the child's condition is serious. If the child appears dyspneic, the patient should be placed on a cardiac monitor that can provide a rhythm 14 Structure and bronchodilatory effects of theophylline and known actions of theophylline and caffeine. Actual mechanism for the bronchodilatory effect of methylxanthines is not completely understood. Phosphodiesterase inhibition appears to be the most likely mechanism, but theophylline is known to have other activity, as shown and oxygen saturation. Intravenous (IV) access should be established in patients who are in respiratory distress, or to maintain hydration status. Parenteral steroids may be initiated for moderate to severe asthma exacerbations. Methylprednisolone 1 to 2 mg/kg can be given intrave-nously or intramuscularly. This can be continued every 6 h if the child requires admission. If the child's condition improves quickly and he or she remains stable, the child may be discharged home on a short course of oral steroids (prednisone 1 to 2 mg/kg/day) with close follow-up and an action plan with detailed instructions. Measurement of peak flow and oxygen saturation should be done prior to discharge. Epinephrine, although always important to consider, is less commonly used because of the abundance of other medications with lesser side effects. Side effects of epinephrine include tremors, hypertension, tachycardia, neutrophil demargination, and cardiac stimulation. In very severe cases, subcutaneous epinephrine (1:1,000) has been used in the treatment of the asthmatic child. The dose is 0.01 ml/kg to a maximum of 0.3 ml. The dose can be repeated if the response is inadequate. Having an epinephrine autoinjector available obviates the need to measure out the dose and saves time.",

Once theophylline is started, the child should be admitted to the hospital. Each milligram per kilogram of theophylline IV bolus results in a 2-mg/dl rise in theophylline levels. The therapeutic window of theophylline serum levels is between 10 and 20 mg/dl. Thus, a commonly used bolus of 6 mg/kg results in a level that should fall well within the therapeutic window. An intravenous theophylline drip of 0.8-1 mg/kg/h will result in a steady-state serum level. Theophylline levels must be monitored carefully because of the serious side effects that can occur at higher serum levels (Table 11 ).

On the other hand, a child's asthma can vary during their childhood and even into adulthood. Asthma is dependent on having a genetic predisposition and, clinically, is modulated by the environment. Environmental modulation can stem from allergenic exposure, exposure to other agents such as endotoxin, irritants, ozone, particulates, and even temperature. Hormones can also play a role in asthma, as suggested by the interesting observation that in pregnancy, women who have asthma have an equal chance of their asthma worsening, improving, or remaining unchanged. What is known, however, is that asthma is an inflammatory disease that results in bronchoconstriction. Successful treatment of the asthmatic means control of the inflammation. Failure to control inflammation may result in chronic obstructive lung disease, as in the case of the cigarette smoker. The introduction of inhaled corticosteroids over the past few decades has greatly improved asthma care and may have a beneficial effect on long-term sequelae of asthma. The persistently high mortality from asthma is probably more related to patient and provider education and compliance than anything else. This is why treatment of asthma requires a comprehensive management plan that incorporates all facets of treatment, including environmental control, medications, education, and immunotherapy (Fig. 16) . Regular monitoring is important to minimize the morbidity of chronic asthma. ",

Early experience in the USA suggests that it is of comparable efficacy to SCIT, but with significantly diminished side effects or risk of anaphylaxis. One potential drawback of SLIT compared to SCIT is the lack of supervision associated with self-administration of oral or sublingual preparations of extracts [155] . Better patient education may circumvent this objection, however, and SLIT may yet become widely used in the treatment of asthma. The other potential road block with SLIT is the absence of an established regimen for prescribing SLIT in polysensitized individual. A study of 51 polysensitized children with allergic rhinitis and/or mild to moderate asthma treated with SLIT for 1 year showed an improvement in symptoms of allergic rhinitis severity and classification, nasal, ocular, and bronchial symptoms and medication use. While the (42) of these children was treated with a single allergen, seven were treated with two or more extracts and experienced benefit as well [156] . Studies on the efficacy of SLIT have been done for dust mite [157, 158] , Olea [159] , grass pollen [160] , and others. Other novel forms of immunotherapy include the development of allergen vaccines based on allergenderived T cell peptides, recombinant allergens, and hypoallergenic allergen derivatives [161] . Another new chimeric Fc-\u03b3 allergen protein immunotherapy is being evaluated for cat and peanut allergy. Studies of these new forms of immunotherapy are still in the early phases and are not currently used clinically.",

However, the availability of financial resources and, more important, the failure to properly allocate such resources can be such an economic burden that optimal systems of healthcare are not implemented. As a result of this, many asthmatic children receive the bulk of their care from generalists and even mid-level practitioners, even in those cases where referral to a specialist may be indicated. Unfortunately, in today's healthcare climate, generalists are being asked to see more and more patients, and they simply do not have the time to formulate a comprehensive asthma treatment program as illustrated in Fig. 16 [164] . Asthma educators who may be nurses or even medical assistants who are specially trained may help, but no financial resources are actually devoted to this form of medical care. Too many patients with asthma are not well controlled and eventually end up in an urgent care or emergency department, at many times the cost of prevention [165] . A list of recommendations for referral to a specialist is shown in Table 21 . These should be considered the very minimum requirements for referral to a specialist.",

Inhaled corticosteroids have become the first-line medical treatment of asthma in all age groups. There is still debate on the preferred add-on therapy, the options being increasing the dose of steroids, adding a leukotriene receptor antagonists, or adding a long-acting \u03b2-agonist, but all of these options are acceptable and should be tailored and customized for each individual child with asthma. Future research may be able to identify which treatment might be preferred based on the patient's pharmacogenetics, but we have not yet reached this point. Environmental control has become a mainstay in asthma treatment, and new modes of immunotherapy have contributed to a significant less morbidity over the past two or three decades. Hospitalization rates of asthmatic children have decreased, drugs with high rates of side effects such as theophylline have been replaced, and quality of life has improved. Most children with asthma are able to enjoy very normal lives, compete in sports at a high level, and have very few missed school or work days, as long as they are compliant with their asthma management plan.",

Many of these are available on the internet (Table 22) . Publications for children to make it easier for them to understand their disease are now ubiquitous. With better education comes better compliance and, hopefully, better outcomes. Some problems remain. Mortality has not decreased significantly since the last edition. One of the main remaining issues is related to patient education and compliance. It is now not a matter of availability of education materials, but acceptance and utilization. Another main issue, which may become even more of a problem in the face of cost cutting measures associated with a variety of health care reform ideas, involves the access to specialist care.",
