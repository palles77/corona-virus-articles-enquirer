RNA interference (RNAi) is a mechanism for silencing gene expression post-transcriptionally that is being exploited as a rapid antiviral strategy. To identify efficacious small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) to inhibit the replication of FMDV, candidate siRNAs corresponding to FMDV VP1 gene were designed and synthesized in vitro using T7 RNA polymerase. In reporter assays, five siRNAs showed significant sequence-specific silencing effects on the expression of VP1-EGFP fusion protein from plasmid pVP1-EGFP-N1, which was cotransfected with siRNA into 293T cells. Furthermore, using RT-qPCR, viral titration and viability assay, we identified VP1-siRNA517, VP1-siRNA113 and VP1-siRNA519 that transiently acted as potent inhibitors of FMDV replication when BHK-21 cells were infected with FMDV. In addition, variations within multiple regions of the quasispecies of FMDV were retrospectively revealed by sequencing of FMDV genes, and a single nucleotide substitution was identified as the main factor in resistance to RNAi. Our data demonstrated that the three siRNA molecules synthesized with T7 RNA polymerase could have transient inhibitory effects on the replication of FMDV.",

Nevertheless, vaccination still remains contentious owing to its limitations. For example, conventional inactivated virus vaccines may leave residual live virus in vaccines, DNA vaccines elicit inadequate neutralizing antibody to protect against the disease in swine (Balamurugan et al., 2004; Ward et al., 1997) , chimeric vaccines have possibilities to lead to production of virulent viruses and to a lack of thermostability for inactivated vaccine production (Van Rensburg and Mason, 2002) and so on. Furthermore, it is imperative to use a new antiviral strategy to compensate vaccine's requirement of at least 7 days to induce protection while the clinical disease and infectivity appear in infected animals as early as 2-3 days post-exposure .",

It is known that the viral genomic RNA in positive-stranded picornaviruses was used both as a messenger for translation and as a template for negative-strand synthesis and there might be a ''switch\" between these processes (Belsham, 2005; van Rij and Andino, 2006) . Recent studies of poliovirus (Gitlin et al., 2005) and influenza virus (Kahana et al., 2004) showed that intriguingly only the positive RNA strand was targeted by RNAi. As the cleavage at a specific location might result in degradation of the full length of virus, we chose VP1 of FMDV as a specific target to inhibit the replication of FMDV, which encodes a structural protein and contains an Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) tripeptide sequence in G-H loop responsible for binding of fibronectin to its cellular receptor integrins (Mason et al., 2003) .",

Specificity of the sequence candidates was verified by BLAST search (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/ ). The DNA templates for in vitro transcription of siRNAs contain T7 RNA polymerase promoter sequence and six extra nucleotides upstream of the minimal promoter sequence and an additional two adenine nucleotides are added to the 5 0 end of templates. The pEGFP-N1-siRNA (Qin et al., 2004) and scrambled-siRNA were also chosen as positive and negative siRNA control, respectively. The oligonucleotide-directed production of small interfering RNA with T7 RNA polymerase was carried out using T7 RiboMAX Express RNAi system (Betz, 2003) according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). Sense and antisense 21-nucleotide RNAs generated in separate reactions were annealed by mixing both transcription reactions, incubating at 70\u00b0for 10 min, followed by 20 min at room temperature to obtain small interfering doublestranded RNA synthesized by T7 RNA polymerase. The mixture was then purified by isopropanol precipitation followed by 70% ethanol washing, dried and resuspended in appropriate amount of nuclease-free water. siRNA aliquots were stored at \u00c080\u00b0until used.",

This screening test resulted in the identification of five siRNAs effective at inhibiting VP1-EGFP expression as assessed by fluorescence microscopic observation and flow cytometric analysis (Fig. 3A-C) . VP1-siRNA517, VP1-siRNA113, VP1-siR-NA616, VP1-siRNA519 and VP1-siRNA401 showed significant reduction of green fluorescence and mean fluorescence intensity. In the same experiments for the other nine siRNAs: VP1-siRNA55, VP1-siRNA63, VP1-siRNA80, VP1-siRNA192, VP1-siRNA423, VP1-siRNA465, VP1-siRNA477, VP1-siRNA516 and VP1-siRNA540, those results showed little inhibition (below 60%) or no inhibition (images and data not shown). By replacing the pVP1-EGFP-N1 plasmid with p3C-EGFP-N1 which contained no target sequences for the five siRNAs targeting VP1, the similar assay was re-conducted to test whether the inhibition by these siRNAs was sequence specific. When the siRNAs did not match the reporter sequences, the reductions of green fluorescence and mean fluorescence intensity were not induced (Fig. 3D) . The results confirmed that the observed inhibition of VP1-EGFP expression occurred through a sequence-specific manner. Since VP1-siRNA517, VP1-siRNA113, VP1-siRNA616, VP1-siRNA519 and VP1-siRNA401 induced high level of inhibition they were used for further viral challenge analysis.",

The original supernatants, which were collected from FMDV-transfected BHK-21 cells and used for virus infection in our experiment, were subjected to rapid nucleotide sequencing. In brief, reverse transcription of FMDV genomic RNA and PCR amplification, followed by molecular cloning from more than 5 clones and sequencing of each individual clone, presented the nucleotide sequences of VP1, VP4, 3B and 3C.

Firstly, the high genetic and phenotypic variability of FMDV inevitably poses the need for screening a relatively large amount of siR-NAs for those efficaciously inhibiting the amplification of FMDV in a specific FMD outbreak. Secondly, the chemical synthesis of siR-NAs involves high cost, and the large quantities of shRNAs cloned into plasmid or viral vectors are time-consuming, both of which cannot guarantee the sufficient inhibitory effect.

            "text": "The reason why no enhanced resistance to efficacious siRNAs was found in the second round of infection, in our opinion, might be as follows. First, the most important factor for virus escape from efficacious siRNAs in our experiments might be the quasispecies of FMDV, but not those new emerging resistant variants. As our results showed, the inhibitory effect of each efficacious siRNA did not persist longer than 48 h post-infection, which could not allow the occurrence of large number of mutants despite high mutation rates of FMDV. Second, the restricted transfection efficiency of siR-NAs could not guarantee complete occupation of siRNAs in BHK-21 cells infected with FMDV. Moreover, the relatively quick speed of VP1-siRNA517 5 0 -GUGACUGAACUGCUUUACCUU-3 0 , 3 0 -UUCACUGACUUGACGAAAUGG-5 0 degradation of siRNAs could not persist long enough at an efficacious concentration, raising the possibility of virus escape. Furthermore, detailed analysis of mutations of FMDV should be emphasized in order to raise specific measures to facilitate RNAi to surmount the viral escape, which ultimately reduces the efficacy for long-term inhibition. In this study, quasispecies dynamics or possibly high mutation rates of FMDV RNA might facilitate the escape of FMDV from siRNA, which is characterized by a high degree of sequence specificity. As we observed, different variants existed in the supernatant of viral infected BHK-21 cells. Particularly, as we tested, a single nucleotide substitution G ? A found within the VP1-siRNA401 target region can be the main factor causing the marked decrease of anti-FMDV efficacy. Moreover, although the single nucleotide substitution C ? T near the target region of VP1-siRNA616 did not result in resistance of the target sequence to VP1-siRNA616, we cannot absolutely deny the possibility that the existence of variations within VP1-siR-NA616 target sequence could be identified by molecular cloning and sequencing of more clones. It was also possible that the C ? T substitution could affect the RNA structure, affecting the accessibility of RISC to FMDV RNA and the efficiency of interference. A study of HIV-1 escape mutant viruses (Westerhout et al., 2005) revealed that not only the nucleotide substitutions or deletions in the siRNA target sequence, but also the mutations outside the target region stabilizing a repressive structure in viral RNA genome could mediate escape from RNAi. Variations within VP1, identified by us, were not located in the target sequence for VP1-siRNA517, VP1-siRNA113 and VP1-siRNA519. Additionally, the restricted transfection efficiency and the relatively quick speed of degradation of siRNAs could not guarantee that siRNAs entered all the FMDV-infected BHK-21 cells or persisted long enough at an efficacious concentration, raising the possibility of virus escape.",

Fortunately, many strategies, such as the non-viral or viral vector-based expression of shRNA in vivo, and the selection of conserved sequences and the combinatorial use of several viral and/or feasible cellular targets, are being exploited to overcome the above problems (Brass et al., 2008; Giering et al., 2008) . Promisingly, in humans, some preclinical studies and clinical trials have exhibited satisfying results in terms of the tolerability and inhibitory activity in vivo (DeVincenzo et al., 2008; Meyers et al., 2007) . So, the practical use of siRNAs (RNAi) will have a promising future. Noticeably, siR-NAs (RNAi) should be most probably used in the conditions where vaccines and drugs are unavailable or inadequate (Manjunath et al., 2006) .",
