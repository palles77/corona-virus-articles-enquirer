In addition, histopathologic studies revealed severe acute tubular necrosis, congestion, and hyaline casts, verifying GM-induced nephrotoxicity. Licorice was effective in reduction of blood urea, creatinine, and uric acid levels, and also effective in decreasing the tubular necrosis score. Licorice treatment also significantly reduced LPO and total peroxide levels, and increased TAC and GSH levels in both renal tissue and blood. Moreover, these changes in rats subjected to the combined therapy (GM 1 licorice) were significantly less than those of GM group.",

            "text": "A CUTE TUBULAR NECROSIS (ATN) is a medical condition involving the death of tubular cells that form the tubule that transports urine to the ureters while reabsorbing 99% of the water (and highly concentrating the salts and metabolic byproducts). Tubular cells replace themselves continuously, and the recovery is likely if the cause of ATN is removed. ATN presents with acute renal failure (ARF) and is one of the most common causes of ARF which is a rapid loss of kidney function. 1 ARF is diagnosed on the basis of clinical history, such as decreased urine production, and characteristic laboratory findings, such as elevated blood urea nitrogen and creatinine levels. Depending on its severity, ARF may lead to several complications, including metabolic acidosis, high potassium levels, changes in body fluid balance, and effects to other organ systems. ATN may be classified as either toxic or ischemic. Toxic ATN occurs when the tubular cells are exposed to a toxic substance (nephrotoxic ATN), such as some antibiotics (e.g., gentamicin [GM] ). Ischemic ATN occurs when the tubular cells do not get enough oxygen, a condition to which they are highly sensitive and susceptible, because of their very high metabolism. [1] [2] [3] It is well known that there are many diseases that can be treated by good nutrition, including specific vitamins and herbs. 4, 5 Licorice is commonly used to purify the liver, the body's detoxification center, helping its defenses against liver diseases, such as cirrhosis and hepatitis by modern herbalists. The herb contains a natural hormone that induces the adrenal cortex to produce larger amounts of cortisone and aldosterone and assists the body to handle stress and relieve exhaustion. It also produces mild estrogenic effects and is said to normalize ovulation in women experiencing infrequent menstruation and ease menopausal symptoms. [6] [7] [8] [9] Besides these known properties, licorice is widely used in Southeastern Anatolia as a traditional medicine, to treat renal diseases particularly to protect kidneys from the injury caused by renal stones. However, there seems to have been no investigation of the licorice on the renal injuries. Therefore, the present study has been planned to investigate its protective and therapeutic effects on renal function, antioxidant-oxidant status, and histopathological changes in ATN induced by a nephrotoxic agent, GM, and to focus on the public health issue.",

            "text": "ATN causes severe damage to the kidney epithelial tubular cells and is often associated with severe renal dysfunction and ARF which is the rapid breakdown of renal function. ARF occurs when high levels of uremic toxins (waste products of the body's metabolism) accumulate in the blood and when the kidneys are unable to excrete (discharge) the daily load of toxins in the urine. [1] [2] [3] 15 It is known that ATN can be induced by GM, whose clinical uses have so far been restricted. [16] [17] [18] The exact mechanism of nephrotoxicity is still unknown; however, it appears that free radicals may be involved. 19, 20 Licorice has previously been shown to alleviate oxidative stress involved in cancer, bronchitis, colitis, diverticulosis, gastritis, stress, colds, nausea, and inflammation because of its antioxidant properties. Moreover, various pharmacological activities of licorice, including anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, antiulcer, and anti-allergy activities have been reported. [6] [7] [8] [9] 21 Licorice also has antiviral activity against various DNA and RNA viruses including HIV and severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus. [22] [23] [24] Glycyrrhizin, a major bioactive compound derived from the underground parts of licorice plants, has been used in Japan for more than 20 years as a hepatoprotective agent for chronic hepatitis. 25 Therefore, a large amount of licorice and its extracts are available in the world market as sweetening agents and medicinal materials. In our region, it is traditionally used for the treatment of kidney diseases by people without prescription. Although the various pharmacological properties of licorice have been extensively studied, its beneficial effect on renal diseases remains poorly understood. Thus, the effect of licorice supplementation on the GM-induced nephrotoxicity was examined in this study. In our experimental study, GM caused significant renal dysfunction as assessed by a markedly increase in the plasma concentrations of urea, uric acid, and creatinine in the GM-treated group, which were decreased to the normal values with the licorice treatment. We also evaluated oxidative-antioxidative status in plasma and renal tissue of the rats and showed the presence of severe oxidative stress in the GM-treated group. In this study, we measured LPO and TPO to determine oxidative status, and TAS and GSH to determine antioxidative status. Our results implicated that oxidative-antioxidative balance shifted toward the oxidative side in the GM-treated group. However, when GM was used together with licorice, the imbalance between oxidants and antioxidants disappeared. Moreover, the treatment with licorice after using GM provided a certain recovery in the renal tissue histopathologically and also balanced the oxidant and antioxidant biochemical parameters.",

            "text": "Oxygen free radical generation can be assessed by measuring the values of LPO products. The measurement of TPO and LPO provides a sensitive index of LPO and oxidative stress. [26] [27] [28] The results of this study confirm that GM causes oxidative stress, by either modulating production of free radicals and reactive oxygen species, and also of toxic cytokines leading to inflammation and leukocyte infiltration, or direct tissue damage, which is shown in previous studies. [29] [30] [31] We also evaluated the effects of licorice on the parameters implicating oxidative and antioxidative status. We observed significantly decreased LPO and TPO levels and increased TAC and GSH levels with the administration of licorice, which may, probably, be related to its antioxidant and freeradical scavenging effects. Similar results were reported for several herbs having antioxidative effects such as sesame oil, eugenol, nigella sativa, and ginseng. [16] [17] [18] 20, 32, 33 In this study, we defined a significant decrease in plasma urea, uric acid, and creatinine levels, and plasma and renal tissue oxidative parameter levels in the licorice treatment group after inducing ATN with GM and also in the GM 1 licorice group compared with GM-treated group. The protective and therapeutic effects of licorice against GM-induced nephrotoxicity appear to be associated with its antioxidative effects. In the light of these findings, it may be possible to conclude that licorice seems to be beneficial as having protective and therapeutic effects because of its antioxidative properties and may be used as a supportive treatment. However, further investigations are required to evaluate the beneficial effects of licorice on kidney tissue damage in clinical and experimental models.",
