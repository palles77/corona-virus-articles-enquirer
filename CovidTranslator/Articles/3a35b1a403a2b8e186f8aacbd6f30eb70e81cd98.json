Recently, a cellular protein, synaptotagmin-binding, cytoplasmic RNA-interacting protein (SYNCRIP), also known as NSAP1, was found to bind HCV RNA and enhance HCV IRES-dependent translation. We investigate whether this protein is also involved in the HCV RNA replication. We found that SYNCRIP was associated with detergent-resistant membrane fractions and colocalized with newly-synthesized HCV RNA. Knock-down of SYNCRIP by siRNA significantly decreased the amount of HCV RNA in the cells containing a subgenomic replicon or a full-length viral RNA. Lastly, an in vitro replication assay after immunodepletion of SYNCRIP showed that SYNCRIP was directly involved in HCV RNA replication. These findings indicate that SYNCRIP has dual functions, participating in both RNA replication and translation in HCV life cycle.",

Some of these host factors, such as PTB and La autoantigen, were initially found to regulate HCV protein translations (Ali and Siddiqui, 1997; Ito and Lai, 1999) by virtue of their binding to the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032-untranslated regions (UTR) of HCV RNA. Later studies showed that some of these host factors also directly regulate HCV RNA replication either by participating in the formation of the RNA replication complex (e.g., VAP-33) (Gao et al., 2004) or by binding to the viral RNA (e.g., La, PTB) (Ali and Siddiqui, 1995; Chang and Luo, 2006) . A recent study showed that another host protein, synaptotagmin-binding, cytoplasmic RNA-interacting protein (SYNCRIP), also named NS-1-associated protein (NSAP1), binds to the N-terminal of the core protein-coding region of HCV RNA and enhances HCV Internal Ribosomal Entry Site (IRES)-dependent translation (Kim et al., 2004) .",

Interestingly, SYNCRIP has previously been shown to be involved not only in cellular processes but also in mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) RNA replication (Choi et al., 2004b) . Since SYNCRIP binds to HCV RNA at a site close to the 5\u2032-end of the RNA, it is likely that SYNCRIP may also affect the RNA replication of HCV. If this is the case, SYNCRIP will have duel functions in both RNA replication and protein translation, similar to other duel-purpose hnRNPs, such as PTB. Our goal in this study is to investigate whether SYNCRIP is involved in HCV RNA replication in addition to its role in translation.",

The nonstructural proteins of HCV are associated with the DRM structures containing Caveolin-2, strongly suggesting that the viral replication complex has properties of lipid rafts (Gao et al., 2004; Mizutani et al., 2000) . To determine whether SYNCRIP is in the RNA replication complex, we performed membrane flotation analysis of HCV replicon cells, followed by immunoblotting with anti-SYNCRIP antibody to examine the possible presence of SYNCRIP in the detergent-resistant membrane fractions, where the HCV replication complexes reside. We found that SYNCRIP was present mostly in the cytosolic fractions (fractions 6-9, Fig. 1 ) in both Huh7 and HuhN1b cells, but a small fraction was associated with the membrane (fractions 2-4, Fig. 1 ). After treatment with Triton X-100 at 4\u00b0C, some SYNCRIP was still associated with the membrane in HuhN1b cells; in contrast, almost all of SYNCRIP was solubilized in Huh7 cells. Longer exposure of immunoblotting was performed, and SYNCRIP was still not found in the DRM fractions of TX-100 treated Huh7 cells. As a control, Fig. 1 . Membrane flotation assay showed relocalization of SYNCRIP to DRM in HCV replicon cells. Cell lysates were prepared from HCV replicon (HuhN1b) or Huh7 cells by passing through a 25-gauge needle 20 times. Nuclei and unbroken cells were removed by centrifugation at 1000 \u00d7g for 5 min in microcentrifuge at 4\u00b0C. The supernatants treated with or without 1% TX-100 at 4\u00b0C for 30 min were fractionated by discontinuous sucrose gradient centrifugation. Fractions were collected from the top, numbered from 1 to 9. Each fraction was concentrated by Centricon YM-30 (Millipore, MA) and immunoblotted by rabbit anti-SYNCRIP antibody or mouse anti-Calnexin antibody, respectively. SYNCRIP was found in both membrane and soluble fractions in the untreated Huh7 and HuhN1b cells, whereas in the HuhN1b cells, some SYNCRIP was localized to the DRM fractions. This phenomenon is not seen in the Calnexin profile. Fig. 2 . SYNCRIP colocalization with de novo-synthesized HCV RNA in a HCV replicon cell. peGFP-SYNCRIP was transfected into Huh7 or HCV replicon (HuhN1b) cells by Fugene 6. Two days after transfection, Huh7 or HCV replicon cells were labeled with BrUTP for 15 min after one-hour treatment with Actinomycin D. Actinomycin D treatment inhibited BrUTP incorporation in Huh7 cells (left two panels), but not in HuhN1b replicon cells, where BrU label was detected in the cytoplasm (right 6 panels). Immunofluorescence staining was performed with sheep polyclonal antibody against BrdU (anti-BrdU) followed by Rhodamine-conjugated anti-sheep antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch). Two different HuhN1b cells are shown, representing two different distribution patterns of BrUTP, as shown previously (Mizutani et al., 2000) .",

To examine whether SYNCRIP is associated with HCV RNA synthesis in the speckle structures, BrUTP labeling was performed in HCV replicon cells transfected with peGFP-SYNCRIP (a gift from Dr. Mizutani, The University of Tokyo). Briefly, 2 days after transfection of peGFP-SYNCRIP, BrUTP was transfected into actinomycin D-pretreated cells (Kanestrom et al., 1998) . Immunofluorescence staining with sheep anti-BrdU polyclonal antibody (Biodesign, ME) was then performed (Kanestrom et al., 1998) . Under this condition, all of the BrU-label represents HCV RNA since the cellular transcription is inhibited by actinomycin D treatment. The BrU-labeled RNA was present either in distinct speckle-like structures or in large spherical particles in the cytoplasm of the replicon cell (Fig. 2) , consistent with our previous report (Mizutani et al., 2000) . These two patterns probably represent two different states of viral RNA synthesis. No BrU-labeled RNA was found in Huh7 cells without an HCV replicon. SYNCRIP was also localized in the cytoplasm in Huh7 cells without HCV replicon, but in a Fig. 3 . SYNCRIP knock-down by siRNA in HCV replicon cells. The siRNAs against SYNCRIP (siRNA 1 and 3) (Choi et al., 2004b) or nonspecific siRNA were transfected into HCV replicon cells. Two days after the first transfection, each siRNA was re-transfected into the same cells to ensure complete knock-down of SYNCRIP. Endogenous SYNCRIP protein levels were monitored by immunoblotting (A), and HCV RNA levels were detected by realtime RT-PCR (B). (C), immunoblotting of SYNCRIP and NS3 expression in SYNCRIP siRNA knock-down replicon cells. (D), intracellular replicon RNA level was examined by realtime RT-PCR.

It was found that eGFP-SYNCRIP was partially colocalized with BrU-labeled RNA in the replicon cells (Fig. 2) , indicating that only a portion of SYNCRIP was recruited to the HCV RNA replication site. This finding is consistent with the fractionation profile, which showed that SYNCRIP is primarily a cytosolic protein and that only a portion of SYNCRIP is relocalized to the DRM fractions in the replicon cells (Fig. 1) . This phenomenon was also observed with PTB in the replicon cell (Aizaki et al., 2006) , in which only a small portion of PTB was relocalized to the cytoplasm, whereas the majority remained in the nucleus. These results suggested that a portion of SYNCRIP is localized to the HCV replication complex, implying that SYNCRIP is involved in HCV RNA replication.",

HuhHyg replicon cells were transfected with either SYNCRIPspecific (siRNA 1 and 3) (Choi et al., 2004b) or nonspecific (NS) siRNA. Protein analysis by immunoblotting was performed with rabbit polyclonal anti-SYNCRIP antibody, and HCV RNA level was monitored by using Taqman quantitative realtime RT-PCR (Gao et al., 2004) . The cells transfected with SYNCRIP siRNA showed a significant reduction of the endogenous SYNCRIP by day 2 post-transfection (Fig. 3A ). One day after re-transfection with the same siRNAs respectively, almost no endogenous SYNCRIP could be detected (R1d, Fig. 3A ). Correspondingly, SYNCRIP siRNA-transfected HCV replicon cells showed a 70-80% reduction of HCV RNA by day 2 after re-transfection with the siRNA as compared to that in the cells transfected with the nonspecific siRNA (R2d, Fig. 3B ). The lag time of more than 1 day between the drop of SYNCRIP and that of HCV RNA was probably due to the relative stability of the HCV RNA.",

Since this region is immediately downstream to the neomycin-phosphotransferase gene in the HCV replicon, it is possible that the observed involvement of SYNCRIP in the HuhN1b replicon cells was due to the possible effects of SYNCRIP on the expression of phosphotransferase. To rule out this possibility, we further examined the role of SYNCRIP in the replication of HCV full-length RNA (pHCV-1b-hyb) without the neomycin phosphotransferase gene. Huh7 cells were first transfected and re-transfected with SYNCRIP-specific siRNA to knock-down the endogenous SYNCRIP protein; 1 day after re-transfection of siRNA, the cells were transfected with the replication-competent full-length HCV RNA (HCV-1b). The SYNCRIP expressions and NS3 levels in siRNAtransfected cells were examined by immunoblotting. SYNCRIP expression was significantly decreased in cells transfected with specific siRNA (siRNA 1 or 3) (Fig. 4A) . Correspondingly, NS3 expression was also affected by the specific SYNCRIP siRNA; in siRNA 1-and siRNA 3-transfected cells, NS3 was detected in the first 2 days post-transfection of HCV full-length RNA, but became undetectable thereafter, whereas in the nonspecific siRNA-transfected cells, NS3 was detected up to 4 days after HCV RNA transfection (Fig. 4A ). Total intracellular HCV RNA was determined at various days by quantitative realtime RT-PCR. In the cells transfected with the nonspecific siRNA, HCV RNA titer gradually increased during the first 72 h post-transfection, in agreement with the published report (Choi et al., 2004a) (Fig. 4B) . In contrast, in the cells transfected with the SYNCRIP-specific siRNA, HCV RNA titer decreased steadily over the same period of time (Fig. 4B) . Although NS3 was detected in the first 2 days after HCV RNA transfection in SYNCRIP-knocked down cells (Fig. 4A) , there was no sign of HCV replication (Fig. 4B ). The intracellular HCV RNA level normalized by NS3 expression level was shown in Fig. 4C . Regardless the NS3 expression detected in SYNCRIP knock-down cells, HCV RNA titer constantly decreased after fulllength HCV RNA transfection. There was a slight increase in intracellular HCV RNA level at day 5 post-transfection of HCV fulllength RNA, probably due to the increase in SYNCRIP protein level. This result suggested that endogenous SYNCRIP is directly involved in HCV replication, but not through the suppression of the expression of neomycin phosphotransferase gene. These results combined indicate that SYNCRIP is involved in HCV replication by affecting either HCV RNA replication or translation, or both.",

However, not so many RNAbinding proteins have been reported to have dual functions in viral RNA replication and translation. Recently, La and PTB, are found to regulate both RNA replication and translation of HCV, probably as a result of their ability to bind to HCV RNA (Aizaki et al., 2006; Domitrovich et al., 2005) . Host factors with dual-regulatory functions may play important roles in switching the RNA from translation to replication or replication to translation. For example, PCBP regulates translation-replication switch in poliovirus life cycle (Back et al., 2002; Gamarnik and Andino, 1998) . It was reported previously that stem-loop I and II are critical for HCV RNA replication, and stem-loop II, III, and IV are important for HCV RNA translation (El-Hage and Luo, 2003; Fukushi et al., 2001; Qi et al., 2003) . La autoantigen was shown to bind to loop IV of HCV 5\u2032NTR (Ali and Siddiqui, 1997) . Although there is no evidence that La binds to stem-loop I or II, La can, nevertheless, regulate HCV replication (Domitrovich et al., 2005) . Similarly, SYNCRIP was reported to bind at nt 342 to 374 (Kim et al., 2004) , a region essential for HCV IRES-driven translation but not HCV replication. Yet we found significant positive regulatory effect of SYNCRIP in HCV RNA replication. It is possible that the binding of SYNCRIP to HCV RNA alters the secondary structure of the RNA or recruits other required factors to facilitate the assembly of the replication complex.",
