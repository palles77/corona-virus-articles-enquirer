The high prevalence of hypertension and other 311 cardiovascular comorbidities have raised speculation regarding the role of angiotensin-converting 312 enzyme Inhibitors (ACEI) in COVID-19. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor has 313 been identified as the receptor used by SARS-CoV-2 to infect human cells and previous studies 314 have shown that the usage of ACEI results in the upregulation of ACE2 (12) (13) . Theoretically, 315 this increase in ACE2 levels could result in a greater risk of infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus. 316 .

Analyses by Huang et al and Lippi et al have suggested that lymphopenia and 322thrombocytopenia in COVID-19 patients are associated with poorer outcomes, respectively(14,  323   15). Interestingly, patients with SARS were reported to have a higher percentage of lymphopenia 324 (68-90%) and thrombocytopenia (20-45%) compared to COVID-19 patients(16). A similar 325 reduction in counts was also observed in patients with H1N1 influenza(17). Thrombocytopenia 326 and lymphopenia have been previously shown to strongly indicate a higher risk of mortality in 327 SARS and influenza(17,18). Given the current lack of predictive biomarkers in COVID-19, 328 lymphocyte and platelet count may be used as indicators of severe disease in the clinical setting. 329 330 Liver abnormality was the most common complication and was present among 13.3% of the 331 subjects, although the data was reported only in 3 studies. However, a significant number of 332 subjects had elevated AST (19.7%) and ALT (14.6%). Impaired liver function has been observed 333 as collateral damage in some viral infections including SARS, possibly caused by direct damage 334 to the hepatic tissue by the pathogen (19). While this could be the case with COVID19, an 335 iatrogenic effect due to medications like lopinavir cannot be ruled out. finding in our analysis was the incidence of cardiac injury in 12.4% of the 338 patients, which is a common event seen in a multitude of viral illnesses(20). Gao et al observed 339that subjects with influenza (H7N9) and cardiac injury had an elevated risk of mortality (HR=2.06) 340(21). In a study by Ludwig et al for analysis of cardiac biomarkers in influenza patients, 24% of 341 the subjects showed ACI in \u226430 days after influenza diagnosis and half of them were myocardial 342 infarction (22). Although our analysis did not show increased mortality risk in patients with cardiac 343 injury, these findings could indicate the potential need for identifying and optimizing cardiac risk 344 factors in COVID-19 patients during the treatment period. 345 346The mean duration between hospitalization and death was 17.5 days (range-14-21 days), 347 compared to 17.4 days in SARS (23). The overall mortality rate in this study was 6.6%, which is 348 more than twice than previously reported (24). Though comparable mortality was reported by Li349 et al (7%) and Qian et al (8.9%) in their meta-analyses, a study by Rodriguez et al showed a much 350 higher death rate of 13.9% (25-27). On the other hand, a study from the Jiangsu province of China 351 results showed a high cure rate equal to 96.67%. Although the main reason for very low mortality 352 on this study remains unknown, measures including early recognition and centered-quarantine 353 may be contributing factors(28). 354 355 Of note, the in-hospital mortality of males was significantly higher than females (OR 3.4; 95% CI 356 1.2-9.1, P = 0.01). A similar pattern of higher mortality in males has been reported in previous 357 coronavirus outbreaks of SARS and MERS. Karlberg et al also reported that the gender-based 358 , the study by Alghamdi et al showed that the case fatality 360 rate in males was twice that of females in MERS (52% VS 23%) (29). Although a gender-based 361 difference in the immune response to infections has been suggested as a possible factor, other 362 contributing factors including smoking history and severity of underlying comorbidities cannot be 363 ruled out (30). This is especially of significance in China, where the prevalence of smoking among 364 men (57.6%) is almost 10 times higher than in women (6.7%) (31). This difference in mortality 365 opens the discussion for the need to treat COVID19 more aggressively in males, including the 366 possibility of earlier intubation and mechanical ventilation in this population. Further investigations 367 are also needed to understand this phenomenon. 368 369 This study has several limitations. Due to the rapidly emerging COVID-19 situation around the 370 globe and the novelty of this coronavirus, there is still limited clinical data regarding diagnostic 371 modalities and effective therapeutic measures. Most of the clinical findings were from 372 observational studies. Future clinical trials and animal models are also required to have 373 conclusive clinical information. We also need more studies outside of China for a comprehensive 374 result that reflects COVID-19 globally. In the end, due to the lack of accurate reports of the new 375 cases in different countries, the epidemiologic measures are also limited. As this pandemic is 376 growing fast, future studies are needed for the evaluation of epidemiologic and clinical features 377 of COVID-19. with a significant number of mortalities especially among males around the 381 world. The pooled mortality rate in our study was 6.6%. The high rate of hospitalization and case 382 fatality among hospitalized patients along with the lack of intensive care facilities necessitated the 383 identification of factors associated with the severe disease and mortality. These factors included 384 male gender, age, underlying diseases, higher level of D-Dimer, lower level of fibrinogen and anti-385 thrombin, progressive radiographic deterioration on follow up, developed ARDS and requirement 386 of mechanical ventilation. It was inferred that higher comorbidities such as hypertension and 387 cardiovascular diseases could be related to the pathogenesis of the virus through ACE II receptor. 388 This association could open doors for future studies to evaluate the role of ACE inhibitor drugs in 389 the high-risk group. There are still a lot of unknown features of COVID-19 for the broad scientific 390 community to investigate in an effort to slow the progression and mortality of COVID-Y, Gu X, Shen X, Zhou D, Zhou S, et al.
