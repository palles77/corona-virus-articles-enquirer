These nonlinear interactions produce transmission dynamics that require specific consideration when mod-eling an intervention that has an impact on the transmission of a pathogen. Best practices for designing and building these models are set out in this article.",

The Task Force cochairs and members are expert developers and experienced model users from academia, industry, and government, with representation from many countries. Several teleconferences and hosted information sessions during scientific meetings of the Societies culminated in an in-person meeting of the Task Force as a whole, held in Boston in March 2011. Draft recommendations were discussed and subsequently edited and circulated to the Task Force members in the form of a survey where each one was asked to agree or disagree with each recommendation, and if the latter, to provide the reasons. Each group received the results of the survey and endeavored to address all issues. The final drafts of the seven articles were available on the ISPOR and Society for Medical Decision Making Web sites for general comment. A second group of experts was invited to formally review the articles. The comments received were addressed, and the final version of each article was prepared. (A copy of the original draft article, as well as the reviewer comments and author responses, is available at the ISPOR Web site: http://www.ispor.org/workpaper/Dynamic-Transmission-Modeling.asp.) A summary of these articles was presented at a plenary session at the ISPOR 16th Annual International Meeting in Baltimore, MD, in May 2011, and again at the 33rd Annual Meeting of the Society for Medical Decision Making in Chicago, IL, in October 2011. These articles are jointly published in the Societies' respective journals, Value in Health and Medical Decision Making. Other articles in this series [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] describe best practices for conceptualizing models, building and applying other types of models, and addressing uncertainty, transparency, and validations. This article addresses best practices for dynamic transmission models. Examples are cited throughout, without implying endorsement or preeminence of the articles referenced.",

Thus, there are population-level effects in addition to those accruing to individuals and caregivers reached by the program. This is not so for noncommunicable diseases. For example, reducing the prevalence of heart disease makes no difference to the heart disease risk in others. If every case is treated, new cases still arise, and the overall health benefits can be estimated by summing the individual benefits. Many commonly used decision-analytic models, such as Markov models, ignore the indirect effects that arise from averted infections, whereas dynamic transmission models provide a tool to model such externalities.",

In a recent review of cost-effectiveness studies of vaccination programs, only 11% of 208 studies used an approach that could incorporate these indirect (as well as direct) effects [9] . Others have reported similar findings for other interventions against communicable diseases, including mass screening and treatment programs for chlamydia [10] . Most analysts have simply adapted the same class of model used for noncommunicable diseases, ignoring this fundamental property of communicable disease control programs. Hence, comparison across economic analyses is more difficult because results may be very sensitive to the underlying model structure. Clearly then, there is a need for specific guidance in this field.",

They differ from other (static) models that assume a constant risk of infection (sometimes referred to as the \"force of infection\"): it is a function of the number of infectious individuals (or infectious particles, such as intestinal worm eggs) in the population (or environment) at a given point in time [11] . If an intervention reduces this pool of infectiousness, then the risk to uninfected susceptible individuals will decrease. That is, individuals not reached by the program can still benefit by experiencing a lower infection risk. The models used can be deterministic or stochastic; individual or cohort-based; include economic and health outcomes or be standalone epidemiological analyses; be simple explorations of the system or be very detailed with many parameters. All share the same distinguishing feature-that the infection risk is dependent on the number of infectious agents at a given point in time. These dynamic aspects will be the focus of these best practices.",

That is, each case generated on average three other cases, and each of these would be expected to generate an average of three further cases, and so on, leading to an exponentially increasing epidemic [15] . The basic reproduction number also gives an indication of the ease of controlling an infection. It is obvious that there is no need for further control measures for malaria in northern Europe.

A static model is acceptable if target groups eligible for intervention are not epidemiologically important (e.g., evaluation of hepatitis A vaccination in travelers from low-to high-incidence countries), or when effects of immunizing a given group are expected to be almost entirely direct (e.g., vaccination of the elderly against influenza or pneumococcal disease). Static models are also acceptable when their projections suggest that an intervention is cost-effective, and dynamic effects would further enhance this (e.g., via prevention of secondary cases). Adopting such an approach, which undervalues an intervention, can lead to poor public health decision making if policymakers use such estimates to decide on the optimum allocation of a limited health care budget.",

Where static models project interventions to be unattractive or borderlineattractive (i.e., close to willingness-to-pay thresholds), supplementary dynamic modeling should be undertaken to evaluate whether the inclusion of indirect herd immunity effects, replacement, and age shifts alter the projected cost-effectiveness. Although indirect effects can be incorporated by using a static framework (e.g., European countries did so by using US data [19, 20] in evaluating the economic attractiveness of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines in children), the danger is that the level of indirect protection may be very different in another setting (e.g., different coverage levels). Flowcharts developed by the World Health Organization for the evaluation of immunization programs can be helpful in guiding the decision about dynamic versus static models [21] .",

As an epidemic does not occur, unvaccinated individuals experience a low infection risk.

Older age at infection may also result in a higher likelihood of infection during pregnancy, with potentially devastating complications for newborns [27] ; (e.g., several countries have seen paradoxical increases in congenital rubella resulting from partial coverage with rubella vaccine, with concomitant increase in age at first infection [28, 29] ). Complex relationships may also exist between disease incidence, latent infections, and immunity in older individuals for such infections as varicella; here, vaccine programs that result in less \"boosting\" as a result of childhood infections may lead to surges in reactivated infection (\"shingles\") in older individuals [30, 31] . Reduced force of infection may also result in more widely spaced epidemics, which may itself have economic value, especially when future health costs and effects are discounted [12] . Such spacing may also complicate capacity planning. None of these phenomena is readily captured via static models. In such circumstances, dynamic models are essential.",

Some changes in the force of infection may also be caused by changing risk behaviors in the population when perceiving a higher risk during an outbreak. By taking into account these changes, dynamic models can 1) produce nonlinear dynamics, 2) predict higher number of cases prevented, and 3) predict changes in morbidity and mortality due to age shifts. Typespecific dynamic transmission models are necessary when interventions can induce selective pressures that cause a subset of pathogen types, or even other microbes, to gain a competitive advantage [16, 33] (e.g., type replacement following vaccination [16, 34, 35] and antimicrobial resistance [33, 36] ). Dynamic models must be used when decision makers are interested in local elimination of an infectious disease, or eradication (i.e., global elimination) [32] . This is possible only, without reaching everyone, with nonlinear (herd) effects. Finally, if reinfection of treated individuals depends on the prevalence of the infection in the population, as is the case in many sexually transmitted infections, dynamic models are required [22] .",

However, the concept of a lifetime horizon is not well defined for dynamic models: these models often concern whole populations, which change over time because of births, deaths, and migrations, and second-order effects can persist far into the future. For example, vaccinating an individual today might prevent infection transmission several years later; individuals not infected later would accrue benefits for the remainder of their lives and also potentially not infect others, who would accrue benefits for the remainder of their lives. Consistent with the rationale for using a lifetime horizon, the time horizon should be long enough to capture all the effects of the intervention. Although an infinite horizon could be used to capture all these effects, such an approach may not be useful or realistic for decision making. In some cases, it is sufficient to use the lifetime of the first vaccinated cohort. In other cases, infinite time horizons can give results different from those obtained by using long fixed time horizons (e.g. 75 or 100 years) [44] . Fixed time horizons can produce artifacts (e.g., the benefits to a cohort vaccinated just before the time horizon end will not be included in the cost-effectiveness estimate, though the vaccination costs will).",

Structural uncertainty is often ignored, despite evidence that it can have a much greater impact on results than parameter uncertainty [7, 8, 39, 47] .

A small shift in parameter values may move from one dynamic regime to another (e.g., transition from a disease-free state to an endemic equilibrium near R 0 of 1, where small changes in parameter values can cause large changes in prevalence). Several models have evaluated nonlinear, and \"catastrophic\" (for the pathogen), effects of interventions for hepatitis B virus and pertussis [49, 51] .

The severity of many communicable diseases of public health importance is extremely variable, and surveillance systems may capture information only on those with symptoms sufficiently severe to warrant presentation for medical care and diagnostic testing. This also complicates the estimation of infection transmissibility. Thus, modeling natural history from surveillance data likely underestimates disease incidence and overestimates severity, hospitalization, and case-fatality. For many communicable diseases, there is also a disconnect between severity and effective infectiousness as more symptomatic individuals may modify their behavior in a way that reduces transmissibility. Thus, transmission by minimally symptomatic individuals may represent a significant problem for control [52] . Serological studies may be used to overcome some of these challenges as antibody responses to infection provide a relatively durable past infection record, provided that seroconversion reliably occurs on infection. Seroprevalence curves can be used to estimate inci-dence among uninfected individuals according to age, sex, and other characteristics [8, 53] .",

Furthermore, reproducing observed disease incidence, trends, or natural history helps establish a model's credibility with decision makers. Difficulty in calibrating across multiple domains suggests that model structures, approaches, or assumptions are incorrect.

Depending on the method of parameterizing the models, however, the correlations may not be known. If extensive data are available, it may be possible to conduct probabilistic sensitivity analysis on dynamic models (e.g., [44] ), but this is not the norm.
