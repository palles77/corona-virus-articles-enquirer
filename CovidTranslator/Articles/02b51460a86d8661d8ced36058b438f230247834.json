The death adults demonstrated hemorrhage from mouth, nasal cavity and intestine, hemorrhageious interstitial pneumonia and gore in liver, spleen and kidney. The survival adults demonstrated local hemorrhagic spot in lung and emphysema, but the other organs showed no pathological abnormality. SARS virus caused no deaths in juveniles, but locomotion of infected juveniles became slower. In the early stage, there was local pneumonia in lung and SARS viruses were isolated from the pathological tissue. Only one control juvenile lived and the infected juvenile showed local pneumonia in lung. The results demonstrated that SARS-CoV infected Brandt's vole seriously and adults were more susceptive to SARS-CoV than juveniles. The Brandt's vole may be a potential animal model for SARS research.",

About 8400 probable cases of SARS were identified worldwide and about 800 patients died. SARS not only caused severe panic allover the world, but also brought huge losses to global economy. SARS is recognized as a new kind of respiratory disease, caused by a novel coranovirus, SARS-CoV It is characterized by pneumonic infection and pathological change. The typical pathological change of lung based on the corpus check, is diffuse hemorrhage on surface, interstitial pneumonia and thicker pulmonary alveoli [I-3] . The latent period of the disease is 2-7 d, its basic reproductive number is 2-4, and the mortality is about 3%-10% [4] [5] [6] . SARS mainly infects adults. But the mortality of old people is high. This disease is still a severe threat to human Chinese Science Bulletin Vol. 50 No. 12 June 2005 ARTICLES health because it spreads quickly with a high mortality, its host is still unknown and no effective therapy is available. Researchers in many countries are struggling to develop SARS vaccines or medicines. But the efforts are badly restricted by the lack of an ideal SARS animal for research. At present, Macaca jascicularis [7] and rhesus macaque [8] re popularly used SARS models. Recently in China, Rhesus monkeys have been applied for pre-clinical assessment of inactive SARS vaccine and anti-SARS drugs. To reduce expense and shorten reproduction duration, it is also necessary to target small animal models for SARS studies.",

            "text": "The early pathological changes of SARS patients are observed with serious diffusive and hemorrhagic inflammation in lungs. Local inflammatory reaction includes the accumulation of monocytes, and epithelium desquamation. The main pathological feature of lung lesions showed the thickened alveoli septum with mononuclear-like inflammatory cells infiltration in the late stage of interstitional pneumonia. SARS also caused 3%-10% death to people[l-3]. Adult Brandt's vole died of virus attack within 1 d (mortality rate = 2/6), and its symptom comprises snoot and intestine hemorrhage. All pathological changes including pulmonary inflammation, apparent thicker pulmonary alveoli, interstitial mononuclear inflammatory infiltration in lung and gore in liver, spleen, kidney and pancreas were observed in adult voles. These symptoms of mortality and serious pathological change are very identical to that in SARS patients. Real-time PCR showed that SARS virus could stay in lungs of juveniles for 8 d, more than 6 d reported in those of BALB/C mouse. Local pneumonia in lungs of juveniles was observed. No juvenile died of infection by SARS Fig. 2 . The negative results of Immunohistochemistry of SARS-CoV. (a) The negative immunohistochemical stain in the liver of adult animal after SARS virus attack (lOx20); (b) the negative immunohistochemical stain in the kidney of adult animal after SARS virus attack (lOx20); (c) the negative immunohistochemical stain in the heart of adult animal after SARS virus attack (lOx20); (d) the negative immunohistochemical stain in the liver of juvenile animal after SARS virus attack (lOx20); (e) the negative immunohistochemical stain in the kidney ofjuvenile animal after SARS virus attack (lOx40); (f) the negative immunohistochemical stain in the heart ofjuvenile animal after SARS virus attack (lOx20). It was concluded that many animal species such as rodents (laboratory mouse, laboratory rat, guinea pig, hamster), monkeys (Macaca jascicularis, rhesus monkey, African green monkey) cats and pole cat are susceptible to SARS virus; SARS virus can replicate in these animals and induce immunological reaction. Some animals (monkey, pole cat) show some slight clinical symptoms like transitory fever, decompensation and tetter. The pathological changes have been observed in all these animal species. However, there is no case report of death due to infection of SARS virus in these animal models.",

The SARS infection in wild populations of the Brandt's vole is worth investigating.",

The results indicated juveniles are less susceptible to SARS virus, which is also similar to infection of SARS infection in human that children are more resistant to SARS infection. Robert reported that adult BALB/C mouse was more sensitive to SARS virus than the juvenile mouse, which was consistent with our results[ll]. One control (day 8) juvenile living together with the treatment juveniles was found to show local pneumonia in lungs, indicating that SARS virus might be transmitted among voles through air. This needs further investigation.Previous studies show that SARS virus can infect many animal species including Macaca jascicularis[7,12 J  , rhesus monkey[8 J , Mustela jura and Felis damesticus[13 J , laboratory mouse[14 J and golden Syrian hamster[15 J \u2022 Recently WHO and Erasmus Medical Center jointly held a workshop on SARS animal models (http://www.who.int/vac-cine_research/diseases/sars/events/2004/02/enl).",
