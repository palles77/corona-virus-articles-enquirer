Initially, partial sequences of the polymerase, spike, membrane protein, and nucleocapsid genes were generated using coronavirus consensus PCR assays. Subsequently, the complete sequences of the nucleocapsid gene and the last two open reading frames at the 3\u2032 terminus of the FECV genome were obtained. Phylogenetic analyses based on predicted partial amino acid sequences of the polymerase, spike, and membrane proteins, and full sequence of the nucleocapsid protein showed that FECV is genetically most closely related to group 1 coronaviruses. FECV is more similar to feline coronavirus, porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus, and canine coronavirus than to porcine epidemic diarrhea virus and human coronavirus 229E. Molecular data presented in this study provide the first genetic evidence for a new coronavirus associated with clinical cases of ECE.",

Since then, the disease has spread throughout the U.S. and other countries. Clinically, ECE is characterized by a foul-smelling bright green diarrhea with high mucus content and is commonly associated with lethargy, anorexia, and vomiting. The morbidity for ECE approaches 100%, but the overall mortality rate is low (b5%), with juvenile ferrets often developing only mild and even subclinical disease. Clinical signs are more severe in older ferrets and the mortality rate is often higher.",

Virions are pleomorphic, with a diameter of 60-220 nm. The coronavirus genome consists of a nonsegmented, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA that is approximately 27-31 kb in length. The capsid has a helical confirmation and is made up of monomers of the nucleocapsid (N) protein. Inserted in the envelope is the spike Virology 349 (2006) 164 -174 www.elsevier.com/locate/yviro (S) protein the membrane (M) protein and the small envelope (E) protein. Coronaviruses are subdivided into three groups, based originally upon serologic properties and more recently upon sequence homology (Chouljenko et al., 2001; Enjuanes et al., 2000; Gonzalez et al., 2003; Hegyi et al., 2002; Holmes, 1999; Murphy et al., 1999; Siddell, 1995; Stephensen et al., 1999; Wege et al., 1982) . Group 1 includes human coronavirus strain 229E, porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus, canine coronavirus, feline coronavirus, and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus. Group 2 includes human coronavirus strain OC43, murine hepatitis virus, rat coronavirus, bovine coronavirus, porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus, and equine coronavirus. The avian viruses, infectious bronchitis virus of chickens, turkey coronavirus, and pheasant coronavirus, belong to Group 3. Based upon sequencing, the recently identified SARS virus appears to be the prototype of a fourth group (Marra et al., 2003; Rota et al., 2003; Snijder et al., 2003) . Using consensus PCR assays for the genus Coronavirus, followed by additional genomic sequencing and phylogenetic analyses, we provide the first molecular evidence that the virus associated with ECE in ferrets is a new coronavirus, tentatively designated as \"ferret enteric coronavirus\" (FECV).",

After cloning and sequencing the products, similarity searches with BLAST (Altschul et al., 1990) showed the sequences to be authentic coronavirus sequences, with the most significant matches to porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus, feline, and canine coronaviruses. Percentage nucleotide sequence identities of the ferret coronavirus sequences (excluding primer sequences) with the corresponding sequences of porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (GenBank accession nos. AY35549, for the S and the M genes, and AJ011482, for the polymerase gene) were as follows: 60.8% for the 586-bp partial S gene sequence, 66.7% for the 334-bp partial M gene sequence, and 76.4% for the 208-bp partial polymerase sequence.

The GenBank accession numbers for these coronavirus strains are given in Fig. 2 . Group 1 coronaviruses, CCV, FCoV, TGEV, PEDV, and HCoV 229E, shared the highest sequence identities with FECV-MSU1 at 57.1, 56, 57.3, 31.2, and 35.7%, respectively.

The N protein sequence alignment data was used to generate a phylogenetic tree ( Fig. 2 ) which clearly shows that the ferret coronavirus, FECV-MSU1, is a novel coronavirus that groups within the group 1 coronaviruses. Within this group, FECV-MSU1 is more closely related to FCoV, CCV, and TGEV than to PEDV and HcoV 229E. Fig. 3 shows the alignment of the deduced N protein sequences of FECV-MSU1, TGEV, CCV, FCoV, and PEDV. The amino acid substitutions that occurred in the FECV sequence in relation to the consensus (majority) sequence appear randomly throughout, with stretches of up to 6 substitutions. Insertions and deletions appear to be random as well, with the largest deletion of 6 residues, with respect to the consensus, observed to have occurred between amino acid positions 178 and 179. A highly conserved region between the N proteins of FECV-MSU1, TGEV, CCV, and FCoV was noted at amino acid positions 88-109 (22 total residues), with only 3 substitutions occurring within the FECV-MSU1 sequence. PEDV stands out as the most distantly related among this group of animal coronaviruses, possessing extra sequence strings, not found in the consensus, of up to 35 amino acid residues at a stretch.

Previous work (Williams et al., 2000) utilizing electron microscopy and immunohistochemistry implicated a coronavirus as the causative agent of ECE. Based upon these previous data, consensus PCR protocols using primers that target conserved areas within the genomes of coronaviruses were utilized in this study to confirm the association of a coronavirus with ECE. Sequencing of the PCR products and BLAST analyses confirmed the coronavirus origin of the amplification products and provided the first genetic evidence for the detection of a novel coronavirus in ferrets, tentatively designated ferret enteric coronavirus (FECV). Subsequently, the sequences of the entire N gene and downstream ORFs were derived. Sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis based upon the predicted N protein sequences of FECV and other coronaviruses clearly indicated that FECV clusters with group 1 coronaviruses. FECV appears to be more closely related to the group 1 coronaviruses FCoV, CCV, and TGEV, than to PEDV and HCoV 229E. Yet, FCoV, CCV, and TGEV together form a tighter cluster with pairwise amino acid sequence identities from 74.9 to 89.5%, compared to only 56.8% average identity shared by FECV with these three viruses. The close serologic relationship between CCV, FCoV, TGEV, and the related PRCV is well established (Sanchez et al., 1990; Siddell et al., 1983; Spaan et al., 1988) . Likewise, the close genetic relationship between these viruses, based upon sequence analysis, has been well documented (Enjuanes et al., 2000; Gonzalez et al., 2003; Horsburgh et al., 1992) . PEDV, although a group 1 coronavirus of animal origin, has been shown to be most closely related to HCoV 229E (Bridgen et al., 1993; Kocherhans et al., 2001) . These two viruses were observed to clearly form their own cluster separate from the other group 1 coronavirus members in the phylogenetic trees shown in Figs. 2 and 6.",

            "text": "Group 1 feline and canine coronaviruses are known to contain two additional ORFs, namely ORFs 7a and 7b, downstream from the N gene at the 3\u2032-end of their genomes (Herrewegh et al., 1995; Vennema et al., 1992a) . TGEV was found to have an ORF 7a but not an ORF 7b in its genome (Herrewegh et al., 1995; Vennema et al., 1992a) . These ORFs code for accessory nonstructural proteins, the functions of which have not yet been defined. ORF 7a codes for a small hydrophobic protein that is membrane-associated (Tung et al., 1992) , while ORF 7b appears to be a secretory glycoprotein not stably associated with viral particles (Vennema et al., 1992b) . Analyses of the 3\u2032-end of FECV-MSU1 downstream from the N gene showed the presence of 2 ORFs. The gene corresponding to ORF 7a of other group 1 animal coronaviruses was not found in the FECV genome. Instead, an ORF with 23.9% homology to the 3x pseudogene of CCV strain Insavc-1 (Horsburgh et al., 1992) was found in the genomic location of ORF 7a. Within the CCV genome, ORF 3x is located between the S and M genes. TGEV has a counterpart to the CCV pseudogene in a similar location but with a deletion of 92 nucleotides (Horsburgh et al., 1992) . Fig. 10 shows the gene arrangements of the 3\u2032 termini of the genomes of FECV, FCoV, CCV, and TGEV. Interestingly, the 3x gene is clearly in a different genomic location in the strain of FECV being analyzed, but this could be a strain-specific feature. It is possible that the 3x pseudogene homologue in FECV-MSU1 is the result of an insertional event. It is well known that recombination, insertions, and deletions are typical features of coronavirus biology (Lai, 1992 (Lai, , 1996 Sawicki and Sawicki, 1998; Spaan et al., 1984; Zhang et al., 2005) . Even though the 3x gene of CCV Insavc-1 could conceivably encode a 71amino-acid 10 K polypeptide, this was considered unlikely, based upon codon usage and base preference programs (Horsburgh et al., 1992; Staden, 1982) . It was suggested that ORF 3x is an evolutionary redundant sequence which is no longer required. Of note, the significant similarity of the FECV 3x-like gene to that of CCV was only apparent after BLAST analysis without the default filtering of low complexity Fig. 7 .

Examination of the deduced amino acid sequence of the FECV 3x-like gene showed multiple regions of biased composition including homopolymeric runs and overrepresentation of some residues characteristic of low complexity sequences (data not shown) (Wootton and Federhen, 1996) . Therefore, the 3x-like ORF in FECV-MSU1, as in Insavc-1, does not appear to encode a functional viral protein.",

The ORF 7a in TGEV was found to have a deletion of 69 nucleotides (de Groot et al., 1988) . The genomic region downstream of the N gene is known to be a \"deletion hot spot\" in coronaviruses (Collison et al., 1990; de Groot et al., 1988; Horsburgh et al., 1992) . Hence, it is not unusual for FECV to have a missing ORF 7a homologue, most likely due to a deletion event. There is a need to sequence and analyze more strains to ascertain whether this is a common feature among FECV isolates.",

In the genus Coronavirus, the nonreplicase ORFs are expressed from a nested set of subgenomic mRNAs that are both 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 coterminal with the viral genome (Lai and Cavanagh, 1997) . It has been postulated that TRSs guide the discontinuous synthesis of negative-stranded subgenomic mRNAs that serve as templates for subgenomic mRNA synthesis (Pasternak et al., 2000; Sawicki and Sawicki, 1995) . The TRS, CTAAAC, was found to be conserved in FECV-MSU1 upstream of the N gene and the 3x-like ORF, but not upstream of ORF 7b. In the CCV strain Insavc-1, the conserved TRS was present upstream of ORF 7a but was absent upstream of ORF 7b (Horsburgh et al., 1992) . It is presumed that ORFs 7a and 7b are likely to be expressed from a single mRNA species, since polycistronic coronavirus mRNAs have been previously identified (Liu and Inglis, 1992; Liu et al., 1991) . Hence, the FECV 7b protein may very well be expressed from a bicistronic mRNA, containing the nonfunctional 3x-like ORF at its 5\u2032-end.",

Based upon this sequence, the entire N gene sequence was derived by the 3\u2032 RACE method, using a commercial kit (GIBCO BRL, Life Technologies, Rockville, MD). Complementary DNA was synthesized from 5 \u03bcl of fecal RNA template with an oligo-(dT)-containing adapter primer according to the kit manufacturer's protocol. The gene-specific primer (5\u2032-ACCCAT-GAAGGTAAGAAGCCC-3\u2032) used for PCR amplification of the target cDNA was based on the initially derived 5\u2032 sequence of the N gene. The abridged universal primer (AUAP) provided in the kit was used as reverse primer. PCR was carried out with the QIAGEN HotStar Taq DNA Polymerase Kit, using 2 \u03bcl of cDNA template, 0.5 \u03bcM of the gene-specific primer, 2 \u03bcl of AUAP and the following cycling conditions: predenaturation at 95\u00b0C for 15 min, followed by 50 cycles of denaturation at 94\u00b0C for 1 min, annealing at 55\u00b0C for 1 min, and extension at 72\u00b0C for 2 min and 30 s, and a final extension at 72\u00b0C for 7 min.
