Introduction THE common cold ranks among the most frequent diseases in man (Gwaltney er a/, 1966) . Yet there exists no causal therapy (apart from expensive interferon -Scott er a/ , 1982) or convincingly effective prophylactic measure (Gwaltney, 1976) . These facts may seem acceptable to most of us because the illness is usually benign. However, because of the immense economic losses due to absenteeism, visits to doctors and the cost of (ineffective) drugs (Wood e t a/, 19801, common colds represent a major health problem. Any feasible measure to reduce the incidence of common colds would therefore be advantageous. The notion that hydrotherapy (particularly alternating warm and cold showers) represents one such measure is is deeply rooted in the belief of laymen and doctors alike (Amelung and Wiesner, 1962; Rodbard, 1981) . Yet proof or disproof of this thesis cannot be found in the scientific literature. The present prospective study compares the incidence, duration and strength of common colds in volunteers treated with regular hydrotherapy to those of untreated controls.",

This effect could be reduced after a series of treatments ('Kneipp-therapy'), which also entails the application of cold and warm water. Others reported that repeated short thermal stimuli would 'train' body thermoregulation, while long exposure had the opposite effect (Haase e t a / , :987). Furthermore it has been demonstrated that a complex therapy including hydrotherapeutic measures induces an increase in protein subfractions, possibly indicating an enhancement of immunological defence (Ring, 1976; Ring and Teichmann 19791 , which is known t o play a role in the development of clinical symptoms of common colds (Callow, 1984) : Despite these clues t o a possible mechanism, the exact mode of action of the experimental procedure chosen for this study is unknown.",

Interferon may work both therapeutically and prophylactically; it is, however, not very practicable mostly due to its high cost (Merigan et a/, 1973; Panusarn et a/, 1974) and side effects (Tyrrell, 1987) . Vaccinations have so far been unsuccessful because of the vast numbers of virus serotypes (Tyrrell, 1987) . Another effective prophylactic measure is the use of virucidal paper tissues (Dick et a/, 1986) . The disadvantage of this approach is, of course, that it only helps t o avoid spreading the infection t o others, it does not help an individual wishing t o protect himself.",
