The highest risk of death is at the youngest ages, with neonatal deaths accounting for a greater proportion of deaths in all regions of the world, reflecting an urgent need to focus resources not only on the young child, but also on the pregnancy and peripartum period. To address the goals of health, equity and development, 189 heads of state signed the Millennium Declaration consisting of eight Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) in 2000. 1 The goals defined included specific targets eradicating extreme poverty and hunger; achieving universal primary education; promoting gender equality and empowering women; reducing child mortality rates; improving maternal health; combating HIV/AIDS, malaria and other diseases; ensuring environmental sustainability; and developing a global partnership for development, all by the target date of 2015. These MDGs form a blueprint agreed to by all the world's countries and leading development institutions.",

In essence, the scope of one goal reaches beyond its own effect and provides solutions, which impact other goals.

The subset due to direct and indirect obstetric causes seemed to decline steadily at an annual pace of 2.8% from 1990 to 2011; from 393 000 to 218 000. Over the same timeframe, the number of HIV-related deaths during pregnancy rose to a peak of 81 000 in 2003 and has since declined to 56 000 in 2011, because of the scale-up of antiretroviral drugs and the epidemic curve for HIV.

Community-based data on disability in less developed settings are lacking and studies reliably assessing the cause are virtually non-existent. This makes the estimates essentially uncertain. Epidemiological research is needed to accurately estimate the contribution of birth asphyxia to perinatal morbidity and mortality, especially in community settings where the burden of disease, due to the high proportion of unattended deliveries, is likely to be larger than in the hospital setting. One of the major difficulties in collecting accurate epidemiological data on birth asphyxia is the lack of a standard definition of the condition. This has added to the difficulties in assessing the true burden of the condition, especially at the community level. Historically, asphyxia was categorized into two grades of severity; asphyxia pallida and livida, signifying varying degrees of affliction. Infants with asphyxia pallida or pale asphyxia were generally regarded as more severely affected, requiring immediate resuscitation. This definition was, however, replaced by more objective measures such as the Apgar score, proposed in 1952. 11 The Apgar score is universally accepted on the basis that a low score, especially at 5 min, can predict survival. The Apgar score has come under criticism for its inability to correctly diagnose perinatal asphyxia and predict long-term neurodevelopmental disabilities. 12, 13 The seemingly weak relationship between low Apgar scores and several indicators of perinatal asphyxia is not surprising, since the Apgar score was not intended to be a measure of perinatal asphyxia. Just as the Apgar score alone is a poor predictor of outcome, metabolic acidosis in isolation has also proved to be a poor predictor of significant perinatal brain injury. Similarly, a combination of low Apgar score and acidosis at birth was found to have poor predictive value for neonatal neurological morbidity. 14 According to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American Academy of Pediatrics, a neonate is labelled to be asphyxiated if the following conditions are satisfied: (1) Umbilical cord arterial pH <7; (2) Apgar score of 0-3 for longer than 5 min; (3) Neonatal neurological manifestations (e.g. seizures, coma or hypotonia); and (4) Multisystem organ dysfunction, e.g. cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, haematological, pulmonary or renal system. Thus, hypoxia or asphyxia should be labelled as a cause of disability and handicap only when the neonate demonstrates the four perinatal findings listed above and in whom other possible causes of neurological damage have been excluded. In the absence of such evidence, subsequent neurological deficiencies cannot be ascribed to perinatal asphyxia or hypoxia.",

In developed countries where intrapartum complications are rare events, cases of perinatal asphyxia are more commonly related to antepartum causes or to the superimposition of intrapartum insults over an already at-risk situation. Given the higher incidence of serious complications in labour and reduced availability of skilled care during delivery, intrapartum causes account for a larger proportion of cases in developing countries. The consequences of asphyxia range from no ill effects to multi-organ complications and death. This huge variation in born between 33 and 37 weeks' gestation. With careful attention to feeding, warmth and early treatment of problems, including breathing problems, infections and jaundice, these babies should be able to survive. Babies born before 33 weeks' gestation or with birth weight under 1500 g are more likely to need advanced care, especially for breathing problems and feeding. These babies should receive care in a referral hospital, if possible. Pre-term birth acts both as a risk factor for mortality as well as a direct cause of death. 10 According to the International Classification of Disease, the direct cause of death is only attributed to pre-term birth if the death results from complications specific to pre-term birth or is in a severely pre-term baby. If a moderately pre-term baby has an infection and dies, the death is most appropriately attributed to infection and pre-term birth acts as a risk factor. Thus, many infants recorded as dying from infection are also pre-term.",

            "text": "Birth asphyxia is the fifth largest cause of under-5 child deaths (8.5%), after pneumonia, diarrhoea, neonatal infections and complications of pre-term birth. It is estimated that around 23% of all newborn deaths are caused by birth asphyxia, with a large proportion of these being stillbirths. The incidence of birth asphyxia has reduced significantly following improvements in primary and obstetric care in most industrialized countries and accounts for less than 0.1% of newborn infant deaths. In developing countries, rates of birth asphyxia are much higher, ranging from 4.6/1000 in Cape Town to 7-26/1000 in Nigeria and case fatality rates may be 40% or higher. Exact epidemiological data are lacking and the precise burden of severe neurological disability in developing countries is unknown. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), between 4 and 9 million newborns develop birth asphyxia each year. Of those, an estimated 1.2 million die and at least the same number develop severe consequences, such as epilepsy, cerebral palsy and developmental delay. The numbers ascertainment, limited laboratory facilities for blood culture, problems with sensitivity of blood cultures in detecting true bacteraemia in neonates and inherent limitations of verbal autopsy tools, which make the cause of death unclear for most neonatal deaths in developing countries. Three studies reported incidence of culture-confirmed EONS, which ranged from 2.2 to 9.8 per 1000 live births. The fourth study reported the incidence of clinical EONS of 20.7 per 1000 live births. [24] [25] [26] [27] A more recent study from Bangladesh reported the incidence of EONS observed during a home-based newborn surveillance programme. The rate of clinical EONS was 50 per 1000 live births and blood culture-confirmed EONS was 2.9 per 1000 live births. All of these studies were from the South Asian region. Two of the studies also reported case fatality rates for EONS in the range of 18-19%. Reviews have shown that the bacteriological profiles of organisms responsible for EONS have evolved over time, highlighting the need for constant surveillance to identify predominant organisms. Knowledge of pathogens that are likely to cause sepsis guides empiric therapy while awaiting culture and antimicrobial susceptibility results. 28, 29 The longest running database on neonatal sepsis in the developed world has been maintained by the Yale-New Haven Hospital. Published findings for a 75-year period, from 1928 to 2003 showed that Streptococcus pneumoniae and group A streptococci account for almost half the cases from 1933 to 1943. 30 The incidences of infections due to S. pneumoniae or group A streptococci have shown a steady decrease and have been replaced by GBS and Escherichia coli. The recommendation of intrapartum use of antibiotics, since the 1990s, to reduce vertical transmission of GBS, has significantly contributed to a decline in the percentage of EONS secondary to GBS in recent years. 31 Aetiological information on causes of EONS in developing countries is again limited. A recent review shows 44 studies that reported the causes of EONS in developing countries. Only four focused on community-acquired infections, the rest were facility-based studies not representative of home environments with high neonatal mortality rates. The limited data available in the review showed that 25% of all episodes of EONS were caused by Klebsiella; 15% were caused by E. coli; 18% were caused by Staphylococcus aureus; 7% were caused by GBS; and 12% were caused collectively by Acinetobacter and Pseudomonas (Table 80 .1).",

In African countries, the ratio of Gram-positive organisms to Gramnegative organisms was equal, due to a larger proportion of infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus and GBS, as compared with other regions of the world. Pseudomonas and Acinetobacter were more common in East Asia, Pacific and South Asian countries and S. aureus was uncommon in East Asia and Latin America, as compared with other regions. Although GBS is one of the predominant organisms causing EONS in developed countries, it was uncommon in developing countries. In developing countries, South Asia had the lowest rates of GBS. The reason for this difference in distribution of GBS between developed and developing countries is not clearly understood. Stoll and Schuchat 31 reviewed 34 studies published between 1980 and 1996 that evaluated GBS colonization rates in women in developing countries. Studies using adequate culture methods found differences in the prevalence of colonization in different the outcome diverges with the severity and duration of asphyxia. Despite identification of many possible predictors of outcome, little is known of the long-term developmental outcome of asphyxiated term neonates. 16 Furthermore, the evaluation of long-term outcome is stalled by the lack of a consensus on standard case definitions of birth asphyxia, difficulties in assessing asphyxia in non-hospital births and in measuring disabilities, especially among young children and the difficulty of attributing aetiology in the wake of malnutrition and disease. 17 Although neonatal encephalopathy is the most commonly accepted marker of birth asphyxia, studies show that over 75% of the cases of neonatal encephalopathy have no clinical signs of intrapartum hypoxia. Assessing the proportion of neonatal encephalopathy that is due to birth asphyxia is difficult because of problems in defining both asphyxia and neonatal encephalopathy and in recognizing the cause of neonatal neurological illness. 18, 19 It was previously believed that birth asphyxia is a primary cause for one to two cases of cerebral palsy per 1000 live births. Cerebral palsy is a chronic nonprogressive neuromuscular condition that results in muscular spasticity or paralysis and may have associated mental retardation. Earlier studies concluded that up to 50% of cerebral palsy was attributable to birth asphyxia. Further studies reduced this figure to under 10% of cases. Clinical epidemiological studies also show that in most cases, the events leading to cerebral palsy occur in the fetus before the onset of labour or in the newborn after delivery. 20 With the importance ascribed in the past to hypoxia in asphyxia and the role of oxygen in resuscitation, the relationship of asphyxia to cerebral palsy may also be related to aggressive and inappropriate treatment strategies.",

Three-quarters of neonatal deaths occur during this period; early-onset neonatal sepsis (EONS) is typically defined as sepsis occurring within the first 3 or 7 days after birth. Seven days is typically used for Group B streptococcal (GBS) sepsis; 3 days is more commonly used in epidemiological studies. 22 Determining the true burden of EONS in the developing world is not an easy task. Most births and deaths in developing countries take place at home and are unrecorded. Limited community-based surveillance and inadequate laboratory resources to identify EONS hinder assessment of the burden of disease. 23 Most of the available information comes from Demographic and Health Surveys, which are believed to underreport early neonatal deaths. Precise diagnosis of EONS and EONSrelated deaths is further complicated by the uncertainties involved in distinguishing the clinical syndrome of sepsis from those of birth asphyxia and prematurity in the early neonatal period. Because hospitals in developing countries with high neonatal mortality capture only a small proportion of all cases of neonatal sepsis, the data do not reflect population-based incidence estimates. Other factors responsible for uncer tainty in the data, include the lack of standardization of case There are a number of factors that put newborns in developing countries at an even greater risk for developing sepsis compared with the newborns in industrialized countries. These can be categorized into intrinsic and extrinsic factors in the antenatal, intrapartum and the early neonatal period. Intrinsic factors in the developing world include higher rates of prematurity, intrauterine growth restriction, birth asphyxia, premature and prolonged rupture of membranes and maternal peripartum infections. The most important extrinsic factors contributing to the high risk of sepsis are the lack of antenatal care and unhygienic birth practices. According to WHO estimates, only 35% of births in least developed countries are attended by a skilled health professional.",

Other causes of death such as vector-borne diseases (e.g. malaria, dengue and Japanese B encephalitis), meningitis and HIV/AIDS are relatively small. AIDS, however, remains a substantial threat since so many HIV-infected people remain undiagnosed. It is remarkably striking that all-cause child deaths and deaths due to some specific causes, such as diarrhoea, pneumonia, malaria and AIDS are heavily concentrated in some countries.

Many of these preventive strategies have health A total of 95% of disease deaths preventable by the Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI) vaccines are caused by measles (67%) and tetanus (28%); protection is higher for diphtheria and pertussis, as deaths from these diseases are rare. The low rate overall of deaths from vaccine-preventable diseases relates to the high rates of EPI coverage, measuring 80-95% in most countries.

This toll is highly concentrated in low-income countries (Table 80. 2). The persistent importance of these infections as immediate causes of death relates to predisposing factors: a lack of access to basic health facilities, unsafe and unhealthy environments. Unsafe water for drinking and food preparation, inadequate availability of water for hygiene and lack of access to sanitation contributes to around 88% of deaths from diarrhoea.

Around 18% of deaths in children under the age of 5 are caused by pneumonia, 20% in low-income countries and only about 4% in highincome countries. Among these, 14% occur in the postnatal period, whereas 4% occur in the neonatal period. The relative in children under 5 years of age has declined from 3.4 episodes/ child year in 1990, to 2.9 episodes/child year in 2010, with the highest incidence rate of 4.5 episodes/child year in the age group 6-11 months. 35 Diarrhoea is more prevalent in the developing world due, in large part, to the lack of safe drinking water, sanitation and hygiene, as well as poorer overall health and nutritional status. A total of 783 million people still do not use an improved drinking water source and 2.5 billion do not use an improved sanitation facility, mostly in the poorest households and rural areas; 90% of people who practice open defecation live in rural areas. Another important cause is the reduced rates of optimal breastfeeding. Only about 40% of children under 6 months of age are exclusively breast-fed. Malnutrition has a bidirectional relationship with diarrhoea. It reduces the immunity and makes children susceptible to infections, including diarrhoea and can also be caused as a result of persistent or severe diarrhoea. 36 Childhood malnutrition is prevalent in low-and middle-income countries. According to an estimate, 20% of children <5 years of age in these countries are underweight (weight for age Z score <\u22122). The prevalence of both underweight is highest in Africa and South-Central Asia. Most children with diarrhoea are not managed appropri ately, with only around one-third of them given oral rehydration solution (ORS). Moreover, despite the evidence of benefit, widespread introduction of zinc for diarrhoea treatment has been limited. UNICEF's zinc procurement began in 2006 and has increased substantially. Despite this progress, global zinc supply is dismally low compared with global need.",

The most inequitable indicators are skilled birth attendant, followed by four or more antenatal care visits, whereas the most equitable was early initiation of breastfeeding.

            "text": "About 60 million of the world's 130 million births occur at home. Many more take place in facilities without adequate resources to prevent stillbirth. Figure 80 .9 shows the estimates of the global number of babies undergoing resuscitation at birth. Thus, we need to focus on ways to improve healthcare systems to increase coverage of key, life-saving perinatal interventions. The components of such systems include facilities, equipment and supplies, but also involve various healthcare (Table 80 .4). To prevent EONS in lowresource settings, cost-effective interventions must be introduced at the community level, with prevention strategies applied during the antenatal, intrapartum and early neonatal period. It is estimated that implementation of these interventions with coverage of 99% can prevent 41-72% of neonatal deaths globally. The knowledge and implementation of these interventions, however, is lacking in the poorest countries, where they are most needed. The benefits of breast milk in preventing neonatal infections and infection-related neonatal mortality are well established. Early and exclusive breast-feeding should be encouraged in developing country settings, since it is perhaps the most important postnatal intervention to prevent EONS. 48 Hygienic newborn care also needs to be encouraged to prevent infections in the early neonatal period. This includes sanitary disposal of waste, provision of clean water in homes and hand washing by care providers. Appropriate cord and skin care is also essential with recent trials showing the benefit of cord and skin cleansing with chlorhexidine. Similarly, massage of newborns with topical sunflower oil, a traditional practice in some communities, has been shown to produce substantial reductions in hospitalacquired neonatal infections among pre-term infants in randomized controlled trials in developing countries. Kangaroo care by mothers is another intervention that can decrease EONS. Kangaroo care involves skin-to-skin contact between mother and infant in a strict vertical position between a 1. A trained attendant must be present at birth, to recognize and assist a baby who does not breathe and attend an adequate number of cases to maintain skills 2. Training should focus on essential newborn care first 3. Adequate systems should be in place for equipment procurement, cleaning/maintenance, resupply 4. Systems are required for supervision, refresher training and monitoring of skills retention 5. Functional referral systems should exist for postresuscitation care and to follow-up resuscitated newborns. A range of preventive strategies can reduce the burden of neonatal infections in community settings and must be implemented at scale. Preventive strategies can be implemented in all cases and in at-risk populations (Figure 80.10) . However, the key to treating neonatal infections successfully in community settings is the appropriate rapid diagnosis and triage to therapy. The onset of illness and course of progression is much more rapid in newborns, thus both clinical diagnosis, as well as empirical therapy are the mainstay for management of neonatal sepsis. 47 Appropriate strategies are needed for prevention of infections, as well as interventions for the domiciliary care and referral of newborn infants who develop bacterial infections. In several resource-poor situations, where prompt referral to a facility is not possible, health workers may have no alternative but to provide domiciliary care, which entails visiting households to provide care for the treatment of serious neonatal Antenatal care, maternal immunization, nutrition, maternal antibiotic prophylaxis",

Hospitalization provides supportive care, such as intravenous fluids; oxygen therapy, when needed; and a controlled thermal environment. The WHO recommends the same standard of care for newborns in developing countries. Unfortunately, most newborns with severe illness in developing countries never reach a healthcare facility. Treatment strategies, therefore, in developing countries, need to be tailored to deliver care at the community level (home or primary care facility), with close interaction between the community health workers, mothers and other family members and linkages with the formal health system. WHO and United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) have developed the Integrated Management of Neonatal and Childhood Illnesses (IMNCI) programme, which trains community health workers to identify severely ill infants and provide treatment and referral. 49 A recent review on the management of neonatal sepsis in primary care settings shows that there is a deficiency of data on community-based management options. However, the use of parenteral antibiotics integrated into home-or communitybased packages is an effective option. There is a lack of aetiological data for EONS from community settings, which makes it difficult to design empiric antibiotic regimens. Among the various parenteral antibiotic options, penicillins, cephalosporins and aminoglycosides are most commonly used in healthfacility settings of developed and developing countries. For many families in the developing world, living in remote communities, even injectable antibiotic therapy is not easily accessible. Administration of oral antibiotics is preferred in such situations as an alternative in affected neonates and is superior Factors Determining Approaches to Community Management of Neonatal Sepsis cause. WHO recommends amoxicillin given twice daily for 3-5 days. In cases of severe pneumonia and if infrastructure for a healthcare setup more advanced than the very basic is available, then pulse oximetry to improve the diagnostic specificity for pneumonia, oxygen systems for providing as needed oxygen as an emergency measure, injectable antibiotics and other supportive measures for continued care may help children with severe acute respiratory syndromes.",

Monitoring of correct hand washing techniques by supervised healthcare personnel in the community can help in the assessment of community behaviour with respect to hand washing, and thus serve as an effective preventive strategy in the defence against diarrhoeal pathogens. 55 Maternal and child malnutrition is also a contributing factor to the morbidity and mortality associated with diarrhoea. While all undernourished children are at higher risk of death, severely under-weight, wasted and stunted children are at greatest risk. Undernutrition generally weakens the immune system, that itself requires adequate protein for antibody and interferon they breathe more in proportion to their body size and they spend most of their time inside the home. Indoor air pollution in developing countries is due largely to the use of solid fuels for cooking or heating purposes in poorly ventilated and closed home units. Material used most often for fuels to light fires and stoves in most rural and many urban areas include wood, crop waste, animal dung and coal. Statistics show that around 3 billion people worldwide use solid fuels as their main cooking fuel and more recent studies show that the use of this solid fuel contributes to as many as 2 million premature and preventable deaths, with as many as half of them attributable to childhood pneumonia alone. The use of these solid fuels is disproportionally higher in rural areas as compared with urban households. Now, with increased spending in research, newer technologies have become available that can reduce indoor air pollution that may help prevent pneumonia.

Legislation mandating universal access to maternal healthcare services and eliminating user fees in low-and middle-income countries also have been shown to be an important prerequisite to ensuring all women receive antenatal care. However, quality of care can be negatively affected by difficul ties in meeting increased demand and in provision of drugs to more patients, poor staff morale, decreasing health service rev enues and the creation of unofficial fees to replace user fees.",

As soon as a case is labelled, empirical treatment is started. Further, the 'integrated' approach entails the combination of major childhood illnesses with involvement of parents in provision of homebased care, prevention of disease through immunization, improved nutrition and breast-feeding. 65 Initially, the programme focused just on childhood illness, but now it has also integrated a neonatal component (IMNCI).

The implementation of this programme requires home visits to all newborns in the first week of life by the CHWs, for the promotion of optimal care practices and identification of severe illness and referral. Health workers assess the newborns, ensure breast-feeding, counsel on warmth and danger-signs, treat local infections and refer to appropriate facilities for possible serious bacterial infections. 66 In addition, the workers are expected to assess sick children, manage children with minor illness and refer severely ill children.",

These outreach programmes can use combined interventions to cover immunizations, vitamin A dosages as well as provide other micronutrients, family planning interventions, promotion of breast-feeding, water purification or test kits, general health examinations, counselling of pre-pregnant women and so on. They should always include communication materials in local language with illustrations, preferably those derived from community inputs.",
