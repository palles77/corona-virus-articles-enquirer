Replication of this SARS coronavirus (SCV) occurs mainly in the lower respiratory tract, and causes diffuse alveolar damage 2,7,8 . Lack of understanding of the pathogenesis of SARS has prevented the rational development of a therapy against this disease. Here we show extensive SCV antigen expression in type 1 pneumocytes of experimentally infected cynomolgus macaques (Macaca fascicularis) at 4 d postinfection (d.p.i.), indicating that this cell type is the primary target for SCV infection early in the disease, and explaining the subsequent pulmonary damage. We also show that prophylactic treatment of SCVinfected macaques with the antiviral agent pegylated interferon-\u03b1 (IFN-\u03b1) significantly reduces viral replication and excretion, viral antigen expression by type 1 pneumocytes and pulmonary damage, compared with untreated macaques. Postexposure treatment with pegylated IFN-\u03b1 yielded intermediate results. We therefore suggest that pegylated IFN-\u03b1 protects type 1 pneumocytes from SCV infection, and should be considered a candidate drug for SARS therapy SARS has recently emerged in the human population as a potentially fatal respiratory disease. Severely affected patients develop acute respiratory distress syndrome 7-10 , which corresponds with diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) at autopsy 2,11 . A newly discovered coronavirus, SCV, has been identified as the primary cause of SARS 1,2,5-7 . SARS patients have been treated empirically with a combination of ribavirin, oseltamivir, antibiotics and corticosteroids 7-9 .

            "text": "We previously hypothesized that SCV infects type 1 pneumocytes, based on the character of the pulmonary lesions in experimentally infected macaques and the known tropism of other respiratory coronaviruses for type 1 pneumocytes 2 . We found extensive type 2 pneumo-cyte hyperplasia in the lungs of SCV-infected macaques at 6 d.p.i., suggesting that there had been loss of type 1 pneumocytes at an earlier stage of infection 2,12 . To determine whether type 1 pneumocytes are infected by SCV at an earlier stage of infection, we conducted pathological and immunohistochemical examinations of the lungs of four SCV-infected macaques (control group) at 4 d.p.i.. The lungs had multifocal, acute DAD, which was characterized by flooding of alveoli with protein-rich edema fluid mixed with neutrophils and rare syncytia, extensive loss of alveolar and bronchiolar epithelium, and occasional type 2 pneumocyte hyperplasia ( Fig. 1a; for comparison, normal alveolar morphology is seen in Fig. 1b) . Immunohistochemistry revealed extensive SCV antigen expression by squamous cells lining the alveolar walls (Fig. 1c,d; compare with Fig. 1e) . These cells were identified as type 1 pneumocytes by their location, morphology and expression of keratin in serial sections. Transmission electron microscopy of alveolar cells revealed coronaviruslike particles measuring about 70 nm in diameter with typical internal nucleocapsid-like structure (Fig. 1f,g) . These cells were identified as type 1 pneumocytes because they lined the alveolar lumen, were closely apposed to the basement membrane, were squamous, contained abundant pinocytotic vesicles, and-in contrast to type 2 pneumocytes-had neither lamellar bodies nor microvilli 13 . As found previously in experimentally infected macaques at 6 d.p.i., less extensive SCV antigen expression also was detected in hyperplastic type 2 pneumocytes within inflammatory foci 2 (Fig. 1h) . Together, these histopathologic and immunohistochemical findings show that type 1 pneumocytes are the main target of SCV in early infection, and are associated with DAD.",

We found extensive type 2 pneumo-cyte hyperplasia in the lungs of SCV-infected macaques at 6 d.p.i., suggesting that there had been loss of type 1 pneumocytes at an earlier stage of infection 2,12 . To determine whether type 1 pneumocytes are infected by SCV at an earlier stage of infection, we conducted pathological and immunohistochemical examinations of the lungs of four SCV-infected macaques (control group) at 4 d.p.i.. The lungs had multifocal, acute DAD, which was characterized by flooding of alveoli with protein-rich edema fluid mixed with neutrophils and rare syncytia, extensive loss of alveolar and bronchiolar epithelium, and occasional type 2 pneumocyte hyperplasia ( Fig. 1a; for comparison, normal alveolar morphology is seen in Fig. 1b) . Immunohistochemistry revealed extensive SCV antigen expression by squamous cells lining the alveolar walls (Fig. 1c,d; compare with Fig. 1e) . These cells were identified as type 1 pneumocytes by their location, morphology and expression of keratin in serial sections. Transmission electron microscopy of alveolar cells revealed coronaviruslike particles measuring about 70 nm in diameter with typical internal nucleocapsid-like structure (Fig. 1f,g) . These cells were identified as type 1 pneumocytes because they lined the alveolar lumen, were closely apposed to the basement membrane, were squamous, contained abundant pinocytotic vesicles, and-in contrast to type 2 pneumocytes-had neither lamellar bodies nor microvilli 13 . As found previously in experimentally infected macaques at 6 d.p.i., less extensive SCV antigen expression also was detected in hyperplastic type 2 pneumocytes within inflammatory foci 2 (Fig. 1h) . Together, these histopathologic and immunohistochemical findings show that type 1 pneumocytes are the main target of SCV in early infection, and are associated with DAD.",

As a candidate drug, we tested the efficacy of pegylated recombinant IFN-\u03b12b, a registered drug for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C 19 . We chose this drug because it is registered and therefore directly available, because human recombinant IFNs inhibit SCV replication in vitro 20 21 . We first tested the effect of pegylated IFN-\u03b1 on SCV-infected Vero cells, and observed a dose-dependent antiviral effect (Fig. 2a) . We then determined the plasma levels of pegylated IFN-\u03b1 after intramuscular injection into a group of six macaques (prophylactic group). High plasma levels were attained 1 d after injection (Fig. 2b) , similar to peak levels found in patients after subcutaneous injection with 3-\u00b5g/kg pegylated IFN-\u03b1 21 . Because IFN-\u03b1 is known to activate macrophages 22 , we measured plasma levels of neopterin after pegylated IFN-\u03b1 treatment, as a measure of macrophage activation. Neopterin levels were increased in all animals ( Fig. 2c) , confirming the biological availability of pegylated IFN-\u03b1 in the treated macaques.",

We limited our investigation to pharyngeal swabs and the lung because an earlier study did not provide evidence of extensive viral replication in other organs 2 .We found that all parameters were significantly (P < 0.05) reduced in the prophylactic group compared with the control group. Virus excretion from the pharynx was abrogated (Fig. 3) , and the virus titer in the lungs at 4 d.p.i. was significantly (P < 0.01) reduced (Fig. 4a) . Immunohistochemistry showed that expression of SCV antigen in type 1 pneumocytes was reduced by 90% ( Figs. 1e and 4b) . By pathology, the extent and severity of DAD was reduced by 80% ( Figs. 1b and  4c) . These data indicate that prophylactic use of pegylated IFN-\u03b1 substantially, although not completely, protects type 1 pneumocytes of experimentally infected macaques from SCV infection, with abrogation of virus excretion and reduced severity of pulmonary lesions. To test the efficacy of pegylated IFN-\u03b1 as an antiviral agent postexposure, we injected pegylated IFN-\u03b1 intramuscularly into a postexposure group of four macaques, 1 and 3 d after experimental SCV infection, and evaluated them in the same way as the prophylactic group. Excretion of SCV from the pharynx was found only 2 d.p.i., at a significantly (P < 0.05) reduced level compared with the control group (Fig. 3) . Moreover, the virus titer in the lungs at 4 d.p.i. was significantly (P < 0.01) decreased, whereas the remaining parameters were less reduced (Fig. 4a-c) . These results show that use of pegylated IFN-\u03b1 1 d postexposure protects type 1 pneumocytes of experimentally infected macaques from SCV infection, but is less effective than prophylactic use.",

Targeting of type 1 pneumocytes by SCV explains why clinical disease and lesions are centered on the lower respiratory tract 7, 11, 23 , and fits with the lesions in early fatal SARS cases in humans 11, 23 and in experimentally infected macaques euthanized at 6 d.p.i.

When the pathological studies in humans and macaques are examined together, the following temporal sequence of lung lesions emerges: viral infection and subsequent loss of type 1 pneumocytes; acute DAD characterized by flooding of alveolar lumina with highly proteinaceous edema fluid; chronic DAD characterized by type 2 pneumocyte hyperplasia; and, in severe cases, extensive pulmonary fibrosis. This sequence of events corresponds to the stereotypic alveolar reaction to acute lung injury from a variety of causes 12 .

Pegylated IFN-\u03b1 treatment may have an important influence on the outcome of SARS. In both virusinduced 14, 15 and toxin-induced 24 DAD, the severity of pulmonary damage is dose dependent, with higher doses causing increased pulmonary fibrosis, loss of lung function and mortality. Reduction of the viral load by pegylated IFN-\u03b1 therapy at an early stage of SCV infection might therefore help prevent serious or fatal outcome of SARS associated with pulmonary fibrosis. In addition to potential disease mitigation, reduced viral excretion through pegylated IFN-\u03b1 therapy may also have an epidemiological effect by reducing the spread of SCV in the human population.

Prophylactic or early postexposure treatment with pegylated IFN-\u03b1 may help reduce the impact of SCV infection on health-care workers and others possibly exposed to SCV, and may limit the spread of the virus in the human population. with 100 median tissue culture infectious dose (TCID 50 )/well SCV (obtained from patient 5688, who died of SARS 2 ). After 16 h, the supernatant was removed and cells were fixed with 10% neutral-buffered formalin and 70% ethanol (10 min at room temperature). SCV antigen-positive cells were visualized by immunohistochemistry, as described below. The numbers of SCV-infected cells per well were summarized as mean \u00b1 s.d.",

Three groups of cynomolgus macaques were infected intratracheally with 1 \u00d7 10 6 TCID 50 SCV suspended in 5 ml of PBS. The control group (n = 4) was injected intramuscularly with PBS, while the prophylactic (n = 6) and postexposure (n = 4) groups were treated with pegylated IFN-\u03b1 at a dose of 3 mg/kg. The prophylactic group was injected with pegylated IFN-\u03b1 on days -3, -1, 1 and 3 after SCV infection; the postexposure group was injected on days 1 and 3 after SCV infection. Four macaques from each group were euthanized on day 4 after infection. At days -3, -2, -1, 0, +2 and +4, we anesthetized the macaques with ketamine, collected 10 ml blood from inguinal veins and took pharyngeal swabs, which were placed in 1 ml transport medium 29 . Pharyngeal swabs were frozen at -70 \u00b0C until RT-PCR analysis. Pegylated IFN-\u03b1 levels were determined using ELISA (Bender MedSystems Diagnostics) with PEG-Intron as a standard. Neopterin levels were determined as described 22 . Necropsies were done according to a standard protocol; one lung of each monkey was inflated with 10% neutral-buffered formalin by intrabronchial intubation and suspended in 10% neutral-buffered formalin overnight. Samples were collected in a standard manner (one from the cranial part of the lung, one from the medial part and two from the caudal part), embedded in paraffin, cut at 5 \u00b5m and used for immunohistochemistry (see below) or stained with H&E. For semiquantitative assessment of SCV infection-associated inflammation in the lung, each H&E-stained section was examined for inflammatory foci by light microscopy using a 10\u00d7 objective. Each focus was scored for size (1, smaller than or equal to area of 10\u00d7 objective; 2, larger than area of 10\u00d7 objective and smaller than or equal to area of 2.5\u00d7 objective; 3, larger than area of 2.5\u00d7 objective) and severity of inflammation (1, mild; 2, moderate; 3, marked). The cumulative scores for the inflammatory foci provided the total score per animal. Sections were examined without knowledge of the identity of the macaques. The lung sections of one monkey in the postexposure group were not assessed because of the presence of inflammation from premortem aspiration of food remains. Lung samples from a control macaque were used for transmission electron microscopy as described 2 .",
