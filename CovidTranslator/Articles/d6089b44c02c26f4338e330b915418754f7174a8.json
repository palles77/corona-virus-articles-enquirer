The disease spread across China during the traditional Chinese Spring Festival. As of 24:00 on March 14, China had passed the peak of the epidemic and started to recover gradually, with a total of 80,844 confirmed cases and 3,199 deaths reported [3] . However, new cases of disease began to appear in other parts of the world and increases rapidly. Because of the rapid spread of the disease, the World Heath Organization (WHO) has assessed COVID-19 as a pandemic [4] , which is the first pandemic caused by a coronavirus. As of March 14, 2020 , the cases of COVID-19 have been reported in 135 countries and territories worldwide, with a total of 142,539 confirmed cases (61,518 outside of China) and 5,393 deaths (2, 199 outside of China) [5] . Among them, a total of 17,660 cases were confirmed in Italy, 11, 364 in Iran, 8, 086 in Republic of Korea, 1,678 in the U.S., furthermore, Europe became the epicenter of the pandemic, with more reported cases and deaths than the rest of the world combined, apart from China [6] .",

How will the epidemics develop in countries or territories around the world? When will the spread of epidemic arrive the peak or turn to stabilize? How many people will be at risk of infectious? Therefore, it is of great significance to analyze the trend of COVID-19 and predict the arrival of peaks for the prevention and control of the pandemic all over the world .",

According to [21] , geographic proximity transmission is very prominent in epidemic transmission. That is to say the phenomenon of regional transmission is popular. This opinion can also be confirmed on the map shown in Figure 5 . The outbreak shows multiple clusters, and has a more obvious near aggregation effect. But we can still find that North Korea is geographically close to South Korea, Japan and China, which has the worst situation. The neighboring countries of North Korea are suffering from severe epidemics, but North Korea has no confirmed cases until now. This is because at the time of the outbreak in China in January 2020, North Korea adopted strict control and management. The North Korean government blocked all entry borders, not allowing any people to travel home and abroad. The choropleth map indicates that the spread of COVID-19 will form four major regional clusters. The first cluster ranges from Southeast Asia to Oceania, including China, South Korea, Japan, Indonesia, the Philippines, Australia, etc. South Korea, Japan, Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines will all have peak values of more than 1,000. Water transportation in this area is well developed, with frequent commercial exchanges and more opportunities for people to gather, which may accelerate the spread of COVID-19. Among these cases, the Diamond Princess incident is the most typical one. The effect of epidemic spread caused by gathering behaviors such as cruises is likely to be much higher than the R 0 level in general sense [21] . As Mar. 22, 2020, 712 people have been diagnosed with the disease on the diamond princess. In the case of unknown diseases, patients will spread the virus to more susceptible groups.",
