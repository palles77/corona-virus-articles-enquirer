Whole inactivated virus (WIV) vaccines represent an ideal strategy for this purpose; however, a universal method for producing safe and immunogenic inactivated vaccines is lacking. Conventional pathogen inactivation methods such as formalin, heat, ultraviolet light, and gamma rays cause structural alterations in vaccines that lead to reduced neutralizing antibody specificity, and in some cases, disastrous T helper type 2-mediated immune pathology. We have evaluated the potential of a visible ultrashort pulsed (USP) laser method to generate safe and immunogenic WIV vaccines without adjuvants. Specifically, we demonstrate that vaccination of mice with laser-inactivated H1N1 influenza virus at about a 10-fold lower dose than that required using conventional formalin-inactivated influenza vaccines results in protection against lethal H1N1 challenge in mice. The virus, inactivated by the USP laser irradiation, has been shown to retain its surface protein structure through hemagglutination assay. Unlike conventional inactivation methods, laser treatment did not generate carbonyl groups in protein, thereby reducing the risk of adverse vaccine-elicited T helper type 2 responses. Therefore, USP laser treatment is an attractive potential strategy to generate WIV vaccines with greater potency and safety than vaccines produced by current inactivation techniques.",

The most logical and cost-effective strategy to protect the human population from these emerging viral diseases is through immunization.

            "text": "Unfortunately, a general method for producing safe and immunogenic WIV vaccines is lacking. Formalin, an alkylating agent, is one of the most extensively used methods for virus inactivation in the manufacture of vaccines. 1,2 However, formalin treatment has several crucial limitations: (1) it causes structural damage to B-cell epitopes, which reduces the specificity of antibody responses elicited by the vaccine; 3 (2) it generates carbonyl groups in proteins, 4 a form of oxidative damage that induces harmful and undesirable T helper type 2 (Th2)biased immune responses; 5 and (3) it adds unnecessary cost and public concern by introducing a carcinogen into the vaccine. These limitations can be seen in the failure of formalin-inactivated respiratory syncytial virus and measles vaccines, which caused disastrous worsening of the disease upon natural infection. [6] [7] [8] [9] Alternative methods for virus inactivation, including other alkylating agents, heat, ultraviolet (UV) light, and gamma radiation, all suffer from various combinations of the abovementioned limitations. [10] [11] [12] [13] Recently, a novel method for pathogen inactivation using visible ultrashort pulsed (USP) lasers has been reported (Ref. 14) . Visible USP laser treatment inactivates viruses through a physical mechanism: the impulsive stimulated Raman scattering (ISRS) process. 15, 16 There are several theoretical reasons why USP lasers would be advantageous over other methods for WIV vaccine production. Visible light (in the wavelength range of 400 to 700 nm) lacks the photon energy to disrupt covalent bonds in biological macromolecules such as viruses; therefore, USP laser irradiation should not generate Th2 response-inducing carbonyl groups in proteins. In the absence of chromophores, visible light shows negligible intrinsic absorption by proteins and nucleic acids; thus, USP laser irradiation should not denature structural B-cell epitopes through heating. In addition, USP laser irradiation does not induce protein-nucleic acid crosslinking; hence, the TLR-stimulating capacity of viral nucleic acids should be preserved. Furthermore, the USP laser method does not involve introducing any potentially toxic or carcinogenic chemicals during treatment and would alleviate public concerns in those regard. These rationales make the USP laser treatment an attractive potential method to generate safe and effective WIV vaccines.",

Splenocytes extracted from mice vaccinated with the USP laser-inactivated virus showed an enhanced influenza-specific cytotoxic T-cell (CTL) response compared with those from unvaccinated mice. In addition, we employed a neutralization assay to confirm the presence of neutralizing antibodies. We demonstrate through hemagglutination assay that the USP laser irradiation has no effect on the surface protein structure of the virus. Furthermore, we have evaluated the effects of USP laser-treatment on a model protein-bovine serum albumin (BSA). We have found that, in contrast to conventional pathogen inactivation methods, the USP laser treatment did not generate Th2 response-inducing carbonyl groups in BSA protein. Therefore, USP laser treatment is a novel and an attractive potential strategy to generate WIV vaccines with greater potency and safety than vaccines produced by current inactivation techniques.",

The laser produced a continuous train of 65 fs pulses at a repetition rate of 80 MHz. 14, 15, 19 The output of the second-harmonic generation of the Ti-sapphire laser was used to irradiate the sample. The excitation laser was chosen to operate at a wavelength of 415 nm and with an average power of 140 mW. It had a pulse width of full width at half maximum of about 100 fs. An achromatic lens of focus length 7.5 cm was used to focus the laser beam into the sample area. In order to facilitate the interaction of the laser with the influenza virus particles, which were placed inside a Pyrex cuvette with buffer solution, a magnetic stirrer was set up so that virions would enter the laser-focused volume. All the laserirradiated influenza samples contained approximately 2 \u00d7 10 8 TCID 50 \u2215ml virus and had a volume of about 200 \u03bcl. The typical exposure time of the sample to laser irradiation was about 8 h. The diameter of the laser beam was approximately 100 \u03bcm within the cuvette and the effective laser exposure time for individual virions was estimated to be about 28 s. The sterility of influenza virus samples after laser treatment was confirmed by TCID 50 assay.

            "text": "Because of the following two reasons, the complete inactivation of H1N1 flu viruses in the sample by the USP laser irradiation observed in our experiments and used for the vaccine cannot be due to the two-photon absorption effect. First, we have estimated the number of UVC photons which might be produced at the laser power densities used in our experiments. The two-photon absorption coefficient for H1N1 flu virus is not available in the literature; however, if we assume that the viruses are giant molecules and that their two-photon absorption coefficient at 415 nm is comparable to that of a typical molecule, 28 then the number of UVC photons at 208 nm generated under our experimental conditions was estimated to be of the order of 0.1/ second. Because the laser exposure time is 8 h, the number of generated UVC photons is about 3000 for the total laser exposure time. On the other hand, the total number of H1N1 viral particles in the laser-irradiated sample is about 200 million; since one UVC photon at 208 nm can inactivate only one viral particle, the value of generated UVC photons of about 3000 during the total laser exposure time is too small to account for the complete inactivation of 200 million viral particles observed in our experiments. Second, we have tried to detect the UVC photons which might be generated in our laser experiments (here, the glass vial is replaced by a synthetic fused silica vial) by using a UV spectrometer with a photon counting system. Within our experimental uncertainty of AE0.5 photon\u2215second, we failed to detect any of the UVC photons at 208 nm. This finding is consistent with our estimation stated above. In addition, we note that the absorption coefficient of water at 208 nm is about 0.05 cm \u22121 , which means that the effect of water absorption at 208 nm is negligible and cannot be the reason for not detecting the UVC photon. Therefore, the observed complete inactivation for H1N1 flu virus observed in our experiments cannot be due to UVC photons generated by two-photon absorption. It has been shown that nonenveloped viruses such as murine norovirus (MNV) are inactivated by a visible USP laser through the ISRS process, 16 whereby the USP laser pulses excite Ramanactive vibrational modes on the capsid of the nonenveloped Fig. 3 Neutralizing antibodies detected by microneutralization assay. Serum from vaccinated (n \u00bc 5) and unvaccinated (n \u00bc 4) groups of mice was extracted 20 days after vaccination and then added to Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells in a 96-well plate, serially diluted, and incubated for 3 days. Subsequently, a constant H1N1 concentration of 1.75 \u00d7 10 5 TCID 50 \u2215well was used for each plate. The virus and serum were incubated at 25\u00b0C for 2 h and then added to the 96-well plate with MDCK cells. The plates were stored for three nights in an incubator at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO 2 . Formaldehyde and naphthol blue-black was added to visualize the results of the reaction. The presence of neutralizing antibodies was determined by cell survival. Neutralization titers were calculated using the Reed-Muench method. Bar graph depicts neutralization titer of untreated and vaccinated mice. (P \u00bc 0.021). virus--MNV. The amplitude of the vibration is linearly proportional to the laser intensity. When the laser intensity is sufficiently large, the excited amplitude of vibration on the capsid can become extremely large, leading to the breaking of weak links such as hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic contacts in the capsid of the virus. This causes the capsid to disintegrate into subunits. The virus becomes inactivated because of the loss of integrity of its capsid. On the other hand, it has been demonstrated that enveloped viruses such as murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) are inactivated by a visible USP laser via the ISRS process as well but through a different route/pathway. 19 The USP laser pulses excite Raman-active modes on the proteins of the capsid as well as the tegument proteins of the enveloped virus--MCMV through the impulsive stimulated Raman scattering process. The excitations, which break the hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic contacts on these proteins, cause partial unfolding of the proteins. These unfolded proteins will rapidly reform their broken weak hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic contacts and return to their original folded configuration. However, if the concentration of proteins is very high, such as in the case of proteins confined within the capsid of a virus, they can form hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic contacts with other proteins nearby, leading to the aggregation of proteins. This has been the case for the enveloped virus--MCMV. Aggregation between capsid proteins and tegument proteins has been found to be the cause of inactivation for an enveloped virus. All influenza viruses are enveloped viruses. Therefore, we believe that the most likely inactivation mechanism for the H1NI influenza virus inactivated by the visible USP laser studied here is the ISRS process. The TEM images of H1N1 influenza virus before and after the USP laser irradiation, shown in Fig. 4 , further support our argument. The striking similarity between these TEM images to those of MCMV, 19 i.e., the retention of the capsid and the global structure of the virus, suggests that the effects (and, therefore, the underlining inactivation mechanism) of the USP laser irradiation on these two enveloped viruses are the same.",

Among conventional methods including heat, formalin, beta propiolactone, and detergents, formalin was found to have the greatest preservation of influenza vaccine antigens. 13 We have performed additional experiments in which two control groups of mice got conventional formalin-inactivated H1N1 influenza vaccine. Figure 6 (a) shows one control group vaccinated with two doses of conventional formalin-inactivated H1N1 vaccine at \u22482.76 \u00d7 10 6 pfu\u2215dose, which was the dose of the USP laserinactivated vaccine that we used for protection against the challenge. Figure 6 (b) shows the other control group vaccinated with two doses of conventional formalin-inactivated H1N1 vaccine at \u22482.76 \u00d7 10 7 pfu\u2215dose. The mice of the control group in Fig. 6 (a) all died (the weights decreased more than 30% of their initial ones) 10 days after challenging; whereas the mice of the control group in Fig. 6 (b) achieved 75% protection. On the other hand, with the visible USP laser irradiation method, we employed two doses of USP laser-inactivated vaccine at \u22482.76 \u00d7 10 6 pfu\u2215dose, which is a 10-fold lower dose relative to the formalin-inactivated vaccine, to achieve 87.5% protection.
