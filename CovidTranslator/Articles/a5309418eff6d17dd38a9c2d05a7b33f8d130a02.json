The experimental use of CCHF virus (CCHFV), which causes CCHF, requires high-biosafety-level (BSL) containment. In contrast, pseudotyping of various viral glycoproteins (GPs) onto vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) can be used in facilities with lower BSL containment, and this has facilitated studies on the viral entry mechanism and the measurement of neutralizing activity, especially for highly pathogenic viruses. In the present study, we generated high titers of pseudotyped VSV bearing the CCHFV envelope GP and analyzed the mechanisms involved in CCHFV infection. A partial deletion of the CCHFV GP cytoplasmic domain increased the titer of the pseudotyped VSV, the entry mechanism of which was dependent on the CCHFV envelope GP. Using the pseudotype virus, DC-SIGN (a calcium-dependent [C-type] lectin cell-surface molecule) was revealed to enhance viral infection and act as an entry factor for CCHFV.",

            "text": "CCHF is caused by infection with CCHF virus (CCHFV), which is a member of the genus Nairovirus in the family Bunyaviridae [9] . In most countries, experimental use of CCHFV requires biosafety level (BSL) 4 containment. The virus has a tri-segmented, negativesense, single-stranded RNA genome and forms enveloped virions. The L, M, and S segments encode the RNAdependent RNA polymerase, the envelope glycoprotein (GP), and the nucleocapsid protein, respectively. The precursor of GP is cleaved and modified to generate the structural proteins Gn and Gc and the non-structural proteins GP38 and NSm [10] [11] [12] . As the structural proteins form complexes on the envelope and interact with host receptors to initiate infection, they are the primary targets of neutralizing antibodies [13] . It was reported previously that the early stage of CCHFV infection is dependent on pH and cholesterol [14, 15] . Furthermore, it was previously shown that the Gc cytoplasmic tail of some viruses of the family Bunyaviridae, such as Rift Valley fever virus, Uukuniemi virus and Bunyamwera virus, is crucial for the trafficking and localization of not only Gc but also Gn [16] [17] [18] . Vesicular stomatitis Indiana virus (VSV), a member of the family Rhabdoviridae, is a non-segmented, negativesense, single-stranded RNA virus that can be handled in facilities with BSL-2 containment. Pseudotyping of viral glycoproteins onto VSV has facilitated studies of viral entry and measurement of virus neutralizing activity under BSL-2 containment [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] . As there are fewer than 50 BSL-4 containment facilities in the world, these pseudotype viruses are valuable tools, especially for the study and diagnosis of highly pathogenic viruses.",

Calcium-dependent (Ctype) lectins recognize glycans, which exist as GPs and/or glycolipids, and some lectins such as DC-SIGN, LSECtin, MGL, and CLEC5A are known to be entry factors for several viruses, including human immunodeficiency virus 1 [28] , measles virus [29] , dengue virus [30] , severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [31] , filoviruses [31] , and Lassa virus [32] . It has been shown that some members of the family Bunyaviridae, including the phleboviruses Rift Valley fever virus, Uukuniemi virus [33] , and severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus (SFTSV) [34] use DC-SIGN as a receptor, and Uukuniemi virus was shown to bind directly to DC-SIGN [33] . Recognition of glycans on virions by C-type lectins results in the enhancement of viral endocytosis, after which the cellular and viral membranes fuse. CCHFV Gn and Gc have some N-glycosylated sites [10, 35] and are likely to bind to C-type lectins.",

VeroE6 cells were inoculated with the resultant pseudotype virus and the cells expressing GFP were counted. The titer of the pseudotype virus with full-length GP was 200 IU/ml (Table 1 ). Next, we examined the effects of deletions within the carboxyl terminal region of GP on the titers of the pseudotype virus, because deletion of the Gc cytoplasmic tail might change the trafficking of the envelope protein, which could affect pseudotype virus production. Furthermore, it was reported previously that a pseudotyped VSV bearing the envelope protein of SARS-CoV with a truncation in the cytoplasmic domain was more efficiently incorporated in the viral particle than the full-length protein [20] . We used four mutant GPs (Table 1) as envelope proteins to generate the pseudotype virus. All of the cytoplasmic-region-deleted GPs that we examined produced higher titers of the pseudotype virus than the full-length GP ( Table 1 ). The highest titer, which was approximately 30 times that of the fulllength GP, was obtained with the GP del10 mutant. The pseudotype virus with GP del10, named CCHFVpv, was used for subsequent experiments. Consistent results were obtained when a luciferase reporter was used instead of a GFP reporter (Fig. 1) . The luciferase activity obtained with CCHFVpv/Luc was approximately 30 times higher than in the cells incubated with the pseudotype virus without the envelope protein.",

Authentic CCHFV infection has been reported to be dependent on pH and cholesterol [14, 15] . First, we examined the effects of NH 4 Cl, which increases the pH of intracellular compartments, on CCHFVpv infection. As shown in Fig. 2 , treatment with NH 4 Cl at concentrations of 12.5 mM and 25 mM decreased CCHFVpv/Luc infection in a dose-dependent manner. NH 4 Cl treatment had a similar effect on infection with VSVpv/Luc, which requires a low-pH step for the entry [15, 38] . In contrast, the treatment did not affect the infectivity of MLVpv/Luc, which is independent of pH for the entry [22] . This indicated that CCHFVpv infection was pH dependent. Next, the effects of MbCD, which removes cholesterol from the cell membranes, were investigated. As shown in Fig. 3a , treatment with MbCD at concentrations of 2.5 mM and 5 mM decreased CCHFVpv/Luc infection in a dose-dependent manner. As shown in Fig. 3b , MbCD treatment decreased CCHFVpv/Luc infection, and the inhibitory effects were reduced when the cholesterol was restored by adding exogenous cholesterol after the removal of cholesterol. This indicated that CCHFVpv infection was cholesterol dependent. Furthermore, to confirm the dependence of CCHFVpv infection on the CCHFV envelope GP, we used sera obtained from healthy donors and a CCHF patient in the convalescent phase. As shown in Fig. 4 , the CCHF patient serum inhibited infection with CCHFVpv/Luc, but not with VSVpv/Luc. In contrast, the control sera from the two healthy subjects did not affect the infection with either of the two pseudotype viruses. These results indicated that CCHFVpv infection was dependent on the CCHFV envelope GP. These results suggest that the entry mechanism of CCHFVpv has characteristics similar to those of authentic CCHFV. This pseudotype is therefore likely to be useful for investigating the entry mechanism of CCHFV.",

Expression of a control molecule (fCD2DCT) and C-type lectins was confirmed by flow cytometry (Fig. 5a) . As shown in Fig. 5b , CCHFVpv/GFP and Lassapv/GFP infections in Jurkat cells were enhanced by the expression of DC-SIGN. Whereas LSECtin expression enhanced Lassapv/GFP and EBOVpv/GFP infection (Fig. 5b) , the lectin did not affect the CCHFVpv/ GFP infection. The results showed that DC-SIGN, but not LSECtin, was involved in CCHFVpv infection. It was reported previously that the binding of Lassapv to DC-SIGN, which mainly recognizes high-mannose-type glycans, was blocked by mannan, a polymer of mannose [32] . CCHFVpv/GFP infection in DC-SIGN-expressing Jurkat cells was inhibited by pretreatment with mannan, but not with GlcNAcb1-2Man, one of the high-affinity ligands of LSECtin [32, 39] (Fig. 5c) . Furthermore, CCHFVpv/GFP infection was also inhibited by pretreatment with the antibody to DC-SIGN (Fig. 5d) . These results show that CCHFVpv may preferentially infect cells that express DC-SIGN as a result of binding between carbohydrates on the envelope GP and DC-SIGN.",

            "text": "Quantitative measurement of infection with a pseudotyped VSV in which the viral envelope protein has been replaced with that of a different virus is highly sensitive, rapid, and easy. Here, we report the creation of a VSV pseudotype bearing the envelope protein of CCHFV, which requires high BSL containment for experimental use. Although a pseudotyped VSV bearing a full-length CCHFV envelope GP has been reported recently [40] , the intensity of luminescence (the expression of the reporter used in the experiment) in infected cells was only eight times higher than the background. Therefore, a pseudotype virus with a much higher titer is needed for research and diagnosis. We found that the use of CCHFV GP with a truncated carboxyl terminus resulted in a higher titer of pseudotyped VSV (30 times higher than background) (Fig. 1) . Although the precise reason(s) why the truncation of the carboxyl terminus of CCHFV GP produced high viral titers is unclear, the altered localization of Gn and Gc and/or proper assembly with the VSV proteins may have been involved. containment, this pseudotype virus will be a powerful tool for studying CCHFV. Because the CCHFV envelope protein is a glycoprotein [10, 35] and some phleboviruses, such as Rift Valley fever virus, Uukuniemi virus [33] , and SFTSV [34] , used a C-type lectin, DC-SIGN, as a receptor, we expected C-type lectins to be receptors for CCHFV. In this study, we found that CCHFVpv efficiently infected DC-SIGNexpressing cells, although we examined only two C-type lectins (Fig. 5) , indicating that DC-SIGN is a possible novel entry factor for CCHFV. The result suggests that the role of DC-SIGN in cell entry is conserved among members of the family Bunyaviridae. CCHFV initially replicates in dendritic cells and tissue resident macrophages, and the virus then migrates to a broad range of tissues and organs, including regional lymph nodes, spleen and liver [6, 41, 42] . As DC-SIGN is present on the surface of dendritic cells [28, 43] and macrophages [44] , the results of this study agree with the tropism of this virus and suggest that DC-SIGN has important role in the infection of dendritic cells and macrophages. However, as the inhibitory effect by mannan or anti-DC-SIGN antibody was only approximately 50 % (Fig. 5c and d) , the mechanism of enhancement of CCHFVpv infection by DC-SIGN might be nonspecific or could involve interactions other than those with the carbohydrate-recognition domain of DC-SIGN.",

CCHFVpv infection was enhanced by DC-SIGN but not by LSECtin. In contrast, Lassapv infection was enhanced by both lectins, and EBOVpv infection was enhanced to a much greater extent by LSECtin than by DC-SIGN. Such different features suggest that the glycosylation status of the CCHFV envelope GP is different from that of the Ebola and Lassa virus GPs. However, there are several possible reasons why LSECtin expression does not enhance CCHFVpv infection. For example, it is possible that the molecule does not bind the CCHFVpv particle, resulting in no involvement (no enhancement) in the viral infection. A second possibility is that the molecule binds the CCHFVpv particle but that the binding does not result in enhancement of infection due to inadequate interaction with a putative factor or cofactor necessary for infection. A third possibility is that binding of the CCHFVpv particle with LSECtin enhances transport to a degradation pathway.",

In addition, candidate molecules/pathways that are eventually found to be involved in CCHFVpv entry into cells should be studied using wild-type CCHFV, because it is unclear whether the entry mechanisms of CCHFVpv and CCHFV are completely identical.
