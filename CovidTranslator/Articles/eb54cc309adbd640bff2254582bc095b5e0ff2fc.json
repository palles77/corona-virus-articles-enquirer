Three of these 4 patients harbored a pathogenic variant in 223 SCN5A. 34 In the SABRUS registry, the percentage of SCN5A pathogenic variants was 77% in 224 children and 27% in adults with a LTE. 33 The authors also performed an analysis of all 225 published cases (up to 2018) with fever-triggered LTE's (40 patients in 22 reports) revealed the 226 presence of a putatively pathogenic variant in SCN5A was found in 13 (68%) of 19 patients 227 tested. 33 Moreover, in a multicenter pediatric population of 106 patients, 10 patients had a LTE 228 during follow-up, which was triggered by fever in 27%; all of the latter patients were positive 229 for a pathogenic SCN5A variant. Finally, preliminary data in a pediatric cohort indicated that 230 mainly children with a SCN5A mutation developed a type 1 ECG during fever (43.8% of 231 children who developed a type 1 ECG during fever had a SCN5A mutation vs 4.2% of children 232 without a type 1 during fever) and had events during follow-up (7/21 vs 0/47). 36 These studies 233 collectively indicate that sodium channel function is sensitive to temperature. This sensitivity 234 may be due to altered temperature-sensitive kinetics, in particular accelerated inactivation, 37 235 and/or decreased sodium channel expression at higher temperatures. 38 3. If these higher risk patients develop a high fever (>38.5C) despite paracetamol 247 treatment, they will need to attend the emergency department*. The emergency 248 department must be forewarned to allow assessment by staff with suitable protective 249 equipment. Assessment should include an ECG** and monitoring for arrhythmia. If an 250 ECG shows the type 1 Brugada ECG pattern, then the patient will need to be observed 251 until fever and/or the ECG pattern resolves. If all ECGs show no sign of the type 1 ECG 252 pattern, then they can go home to self-isolate.

Nevertheless, if possible, we advise (Figure 1) to 172 monitor QT-intervals at baseline and at 4h after administration of (hydroxy)chloroquine and/or 173 anti-viral therapy in patients with congenital or acquired LQTS, patients already taking other 174 QT-prolonging drugs, and patients with structural heart disease or bradycardia. A second ECG 175 is recommended after 1-3 days. In all other patients, QTc-interval monitoring should be 176 performed 24h after start of therapy. During the course of (hydroxy)chloroquine and/or 177 anti-viral therapy, QTc-interval monitoring is furthermore indicated in case of worsening 178 kidney/liver function and electrolyte disorders (in particular K + , Ca 2+ and Mg 2+ ), especially in 179 LQTS patients or patients with abnormal QT-intervals at baseline. Of particular concern is the 180 COVID-19 associated diarrhea which may lead to hypokalemia with adverse effects on the 181QTc interval. In addition, beta-blocker treatment should be considered if the patient is not yet 182 treated. Cardiologists throughout Europe, Canada and the US have initiated a QT-interval 183 registry for COVID-19 patients treated with chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine and/or anti-viral 184 drugs and contribution is open to all. 185In summary, we advise (Figure 1): 186\u2022 QTc-interval monitoring in patients with known LQTS, acquired QT-prolongation or 190 conditions associated with acquired QT-prolongation (e.g. use of other QT-prolonging 191 drugs, structural heart disease, bradycardia <50/min, liver and renal disease) 192\u2022 When QTc is above 500msec, we advise consultation with a cardiologist 193 (\"QT-specialist\") for guidance (which might, e.g., result in intensified monitoring, 194 raising potassium levels, and/or discontinuation of one or more QT-prolonging drugs) 195\u2022 Patients with acquired LQTS or patients using a combination of QT-prolonging drugs 196should have a high serum potassium level. Avoiding hypokalemia is not enough and the 197 adagium should be \"a serum potassium of 5 is better than 4.\"30 198 Brugada syndrome 199 Brugada syndrome (BrS) is a familial arrhythmia syndrome disorder characterized by the 200 type 1 Brugada ECG pattern in the right precordial leads of the ECG (coved type ST-elevation 201 and T wave inversion in lead V1 and/or V2) and an increased risk for ventricular fibrillation 202 and sudden cardiac death. Up to 30% of patients with BrS carry a loss-of-function pathogenic 203 variant (mutation) in SCN5A, the gene that encodes the cardiac sodium channel, as the 204 pathophysiological substrate of their disease. 31 The most frequently used drugs for 205 SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 patients are not on the list of drugs to be avoided by BrS 206 patients. 32 However, attention to BrS patient management is relevant in the setting of the 12 fever, and since fever has been unequivocally associated with life-threatening arrhythmic 209 events (LTE) in patients with the disorder. 33 210",
