DOCK8, encoding a guanine nucleotide exchange factor highly expressed in lymphocytes, regulates actin cytoskeleton, which is critical for migration through collagen-dense tissues, such as skin 6 . Analyzing deep metagenomic sequencing data from DOCK8-deficient skin samples demonstrated a notable increase in eukaryotic viral representation and diversity as compared to healthy volunteers. De novo assembly approaches identified hundreds of novel human papillomavirus genomes, illuminating microbial dark matter. Expansion of the skin virome in DOCK8-deficient patients underscores the importance of immune surveillance in controlling eukaryotic viral colonization and infection. ",

Studying primary immunodeficiency (PID) patients provides a unique perspective on the degree to which altered immunity may influence the human microbiome, and, how in turn, microbiota may interact with the host to drive disease. Skin-associated bacterial and fungal communities of PID patients displayed increased ecological permissiveness with decreased site specificity and temporal stability 19 . We sought to investigate the potential eukaryotic virome composition and stability in a PID patient population with a high frequency of severe, recalcitrant cutaneous and systemic viral infections. Dedicator of cytokinesis 8 (DOCK8) deficiency is a rare autosomal recessive, combined immunodeficiency within the spectrum of hyper-IgE syndromes 5 . In addition to recurrent cutaneous and sinopulmonary infections, these patients can suffer from severe food allergies with anaphylaxis, eczematous dermatitis with bacterial skin infections, mucocutaneous candidiasis, and cancer susceptibility. The cutaneous viral-associated manifestations of DOCK8 deficiency include molluscum contagiosum, herpesvirus infections, and warts (HPV infections) along with atopic dermatitis (Fig. 1a and 5 ).",

These shotgun metagenomics microbial reads were mapped to a multi-kingdom reference database and compared with similar skin metagenomics data from five representative healthy volunteers (3 adults and 2 children 1, 20 ) . Skin microbiome of healthy adults and children is dominated by bacteria with low viral abundance (8.7% mean phage abundance and 6.4% mean eukaryotic viral abundance (Supplementary Table 3) , also in 3, 20 ) . By contrast, DOCK8-deficient patients' skin displayed a significantly higher relative abundance of eukaryotic viruses (mean relative abundance 92.6 \u00b1 9.2, p = 0.00061, Fig. 1b, Supplementary Fig. 1a and Supplementary Table 4 ). Three DOCK8-deficient patients (patients D8_pt23, D8_pt24 and D8_pt27) with >25% of metagenomics reads mapping to the bacterial kingdom also had less severe systemic complications associated with DOCK8 deficiency in the first two decades of life. Skin-associated bacterial and fungal communities of DOCK8-deficient patients demonstrated similar diversity and composition when compared to healthy controls, based upon shotgun metagenomics, bacterial amplicon (V1-V3 of 16S rRNA gene) and fungal amplicon (ITS1 region) datasets ( Supplementary Fig. 1b, 1c and 19 ).",

To explore our hypothesis that unmapped reads represented novel viral genomes, we performed reference-free de novo assembly of filtered reads from each skin sample after subtracting mapped bacterial and fungal reads. From this large dataset, 10,435 contigs were eukaryotic viruses with high coverage; of which 8,631 contigs were from the Papillomaviridae family. To identify novel viral genomes, all (near-complete) papillomavirus genomes (6-8 kb) were screened against the reference Papillomavirus Episteme (PaVe) database and then clustered at 95%, which resulted in 250 non-redundant HPV genomes ( Supplementary Fig. 3 ). Incorporating these HPV genomes into our reference genome database contributed to a significant increase in mapped reads from 53.3% \u00b1 20.1 to 72.3 \u00b1 18.8% (p<2.2e-16). At one extreme, the percentage of mapped reads increased from 1.2% to 92% with inclusion of new HPV genomes, illuminating skin microbial 'dark matter' (Supplementary Fig. 4a Supplementary Table 9 ). Three additional eukaryotic viral contigs were novel genotypes of ssDNA Torque teno virus, a genus of Anelloviridae ( Supplementary   Fig. 4b) , with 76-82% nucleotide identity with the closest reference genome for the gene used for phylogenetic classification ( Supplementary Fig. 4c) 21 .",

Some of these HPV types were at modest levels but decreased from both sites simultaneously; e.g. D8_Pt04 lost HPV9 on both Pc and Ra, decreasing from 0.3 to 0 and 0.8 to 0%, respectively; and D8_Pt21 gained HPV15, with relative abundance increasing from 0.07 to 0.3 and 0 to 0.5% on Pc and Ra, respectively (Supplementary Table 12 ).",

            "text": "While severe recalcitrant cutaneous DNA viral infections in DOCK8 deficiency suggested an expanded DNA virome, the increased incidence of viral infections in general prompted us to examine the RNA virome. We overcame the technical hurdle of extracting sufficient biomass for sequencing from non-invasive skin samples and collected a total of 207 skin and nares swabs from DOCK8-deficient patients; within-patient samples were combined based on skin physiology and/or anatomical proximity to achieve sufficient RNA for sequencing (see Methods for details). We generated 31 Gbp of rRNA-subtracted, microbial RNA-Seq data from four combined skin sites of nine DOCK8-deficient patients (Supplementary Table  13 ). The majority of viral RNA reads mapped to DNA viruses, mostly Papillomaviridae and Polyomaviridae (Supplementary Table 14) , which may indicate active viral replication. The relative abundance of the genera of polyomaviruses and papillomavirus detected in the RNA and DNA datasets were highly similar ( Supplementary Fig. 7a ). The nares of DOCK8deficient patients revealed colonization with several RNA viral families, including members of Coronaviridae (Coronavirus species), Picornaviridae (Rhinovirus, Enterovirus and Kobuvirus species), Orthomyxoviridae (Influenza) and Paramyxoviridae (Parainfluenza) (Fig. 4a ). Using reference-free de novo assembly of viral and unmapped RNA reads, we identified contigs with 85-97% identity to distinct reference Human Rhinovirus (HRV) genomes, in multiple samples from three different patients. From these, we constructed two full genomes of putative novel Rhinoviruses variant and genotype (RhinovirusA genome detected in a single patient and a RhinovirusB genome detected in two other patients), with 89% and 80% nucleotide identity to the closest genotype (A60 and B93), respectively, at the VP1 gene used for phylogenetic assignment ( Supplementary Fig. 7b ). One DOCK8-deficient patient exhibited high relative abundances of Rubella virus, whose genome carried signature mutations of the vaccine strain. Among the nine patients who had RNA viruses detected in their nares, five had undergone clinical lab testing for respiratory pathogens with 3/5 positive results directly corresponding with clinical lab results (D8_Pt16, D8_Pt19, D8_Pt21). The other two patients had negative clinical tests and notably lower relative abundances (less than 0.5%) of Rhinovirus (D8_Pt20) and Parainfluenza (D8_Pt20, D8_Pt21).",

In contrast, the mean relative abundances of MCV reads in patients without clinical molluscum contagiosum lesions was quite low (mean 0.4%).

Expanding the knowledge of HPV diversity may promote the development of computational tools for predicting and assigning unknown sequences from metagenomics surveys and of molecular assays for rapid identification of viruses with oncogenic potential, like some members of the HPV community.

A similar search for divergent Polyomaviridae returned no additional contigs. From 8914 Papillomaviridae contigs, we subsetted 3725 contigs that were within a size range of 6-8 kb, which is the similar to the size of an average HPV genome (~7.9 kb). These genomes were masked using an HPV reference downloaded from the PaVe database ( 42 and www.pave.niaid.nih.gov) to remove all regions \u2265500 nt with more than 90% identity by BLASTN. Genomes with \u22654000 nt unmasked were kept, resulting in 2189 genomes. Papillomaviridae have circular genome which is problematic for alignment-based clustering algorithms so the mash algorithm 43 was used instead to build a graph of 95% identical contigs which were then clustered using SPICi 44 . This threshold was set in order to remove redundant genomes but still retain genomes that are distant enough to represent distinct HPV types. This clustering resulted in 208 cluster seeds and 42 singletons genomes, yielding a final pool of 250 non-redundant HPV genomes. Using BLASTN to compare the 250 nonredundant genomes to themselves we verified that their nucleotide identity between cluster representatives did not exceed 90%.",

This resulted in 23 Poxviridae contigs which were mostly masked, 6 Herpesviridae contigs (in size range of 750-1800 nt), all assembled from the same sample (patient D8_Pt21) which mapped to Cytomegalovirus genomes not included in our database, and 4 Anelloviridae contigs (Supplementary Fig. 4b) . Three of the Anelloviridae contigs (in the genus Torque teno virus) were assembled from two samples from patient D8_Pt13 with contigs size of 1980, 1270 and 1599 nt. The fourth contig was assembled from a sample from a different patient (contig size 1357 nt, D8_Pt11). These contigs were amplified by PCR using targeted primers from the original DNA extracted from the skin swab and sequences were verified with Sanger sequencing. Due to low coverage of these contigs we were not able to amplify and assemble a complete genome of these putative novel Anelloviruses. A novel anellovirus genotype has been defined as the ORF1 gene having <90% shared nucleotide identity when aligned to any reference genotype, whereas designation as a novel anellovirus species requires <50% sequence identity. Assembled contigs were aligned to reference genomes in our viral database using Muscle 47 v3.8.31 to determine the phylogenetic relationships of the viruses ( Supplementary  Fig. 4c ). The resulting alignment was used to construct a Maximum-likelihood phylogenetic tree, using FastTree 48 v2.1.9 and visualized with FigTree (http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/ figtree/). Unassigned contigs (90,545) were assigned to best protein hit using the BLASTX mode against the nr database and most partially matched to bacterial or phage proteins. RNA reads filtered from rRNA, human, bacterial and fungal reads were de novo assembled in the same manner. However, since rRNA reads represented a significant portion of the data, some of the samples had a very low number of reads (with lowest sample having only 35,331 filtered reads). As a consequence, the assembly yielded a large number of contigs (625,306) , with only about one-third of them passing quality filtration (206,371) (Supplementary Table 17 ). Of these, 122,771 were assigned according to our contig analysis pipeline and only 24,217 were a hit to viral genome. Almost all viral contigs were assigned to DNA viruses (mainly Papillomaviridae), in accordance to the high abundance we detected in read mapping both from DNA and RNA data. 1458 contigs were assigned to RNA viruses. We detected several contigs from the Rhinovirus family, in patients D8_Pt16, D8_Pt21 and D8_Pt22. Contigs from patient D8_Pt16 were identified as a variant of Rhinovirus A60, and contigs from patients D8_Pt21 and D8_Pt22 were identified as a variant of Rhinovirus B97. The Picronaviridae study group defines novelty of a Rhinovirus genotype by the coding sequence of the conserved VP1 gene, with slight differences of between the species; an HRV type should have at least 13 % (HRV-A) or 12 % (HRV-B) nucleotide divergence from all other HRV types. Nucleotide divergence lower than this threshold have been used to assign new variants of a genotype 49, 50 . With primers designed at terminal contig sequences and cDNA derived from the original patient RNA, we amplified across the gaps, Sanger sequenced and assembled two complete novel Rhinovirus variant and genotype (~7 kb), as classified by the conserved VP1 protein 49, 50 (Supplementary Fig.  7b ). Contigs that were unassigned at first were blasted again with adjusted parameters in Blastn and Blastx modes against the non-redundant databases and predominantly were partially matched to bacterial or eukaryotes genomes and proteins.",

MCV-1 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were called against U60315 using Snippy (https://github.com/tseemann/snippy) with default parameters on samples with at least 15x coverage of the MCV-1 genome (49 samples, 10 subjects). Core SNPs were called using the snippy-core program (244 core SNP positions). A histogram of SNPs positions identified uneven SNP coverage, indicative of recombination. Gubbins 54 was used to analyze recombination blocks between MCV-1 genomes and identified one block centered on the MC054L gene, which encodes a putative IL-18 binding protein 55, 56 . Of the two DOCK8-deficient patients who do not display clonal carriage, D8_Pt08 showed two distinct MCV-1 strains, each exclusive to distinct body sites and D8_Pt15 exclusively carries MCV-1 at two body sites and MCV-2 at three other body sites, demonstrating the potential for localized skin colonization from distinct subtypes. A phylogenetic tree was built based on SNPs outside these recombinant regions.",

The nonparametric Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used to determine statistically significant differences between microbial populations. Unless otherwise indicated, P-values were adjusted for multiple comparisons using the Bonferroni or FDR correction (by applying the p.adjust function in R using method = \"bonferroni\" or \"fdr\"). Statistical significance was ascribed to an alpha level of the adjusted P-values \u2264 0.05.
