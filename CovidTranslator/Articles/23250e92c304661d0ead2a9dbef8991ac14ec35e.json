HPIVs can cause a range of upper and lower respiratory tract illnesses including bronchitis, bronchiolitis, laryngotracheobronchitis (croup), and pneumonia [2] . HPIVs are the second most common cause of acute respiratory illness-related hospitalizations in children < 5 years of age, second only to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). HPIVs account for approximately 7 % of all hospitalizations for fever, acute respiratory illness (ARI), or both [3] . Co-infections of HPIV and other respiratory viruses are common and may lead to more complicated and prolonged disease course, especially among children [1, 3] .",

HPIV-4 seasonal patterns are less well-described; the few studies that assessed HPIV-4 focused on solitary outbreaks of HPIV-4 or were limited to countries outside the United States [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] .

For NREVSS, laboratories report on a weekly basis the aggregated total number of tests performed and the number of positive tests determined in the previous week by either of three categories of detection methods; molecular diagnostic assays, virus antigen detection, and viral isolation by culture. The diagnostic method reported from each laboratory varies by surveillance year and by virus. The NREVSS surveillance year begins in July and ends in June of the following year in order to first capture the onset followed by the offset of most respiratory viruses within a 12-month period. A surveillance week was defined as a seven day period lasting from Sunday through Saturday.",

Lastly, the frequency and percentage of HPIV co-detections were assessed with the following viruses: RSV, respiratory adenovirus, influenza A/B, human metapneumovirus, rhinovirus/enterovirus, and coronavirus. Analyses were completed using SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). Among specimens with at least a single HPIV detection, 2618 (96 %) had complete gender and age data, 79 (3 %) had only age data available, and 20 (1 %) had only gender data available. HPIV was predominantly detected among younger age groups, specifically in children two years or younger (36 %). The median age was seven years with a range from 0 to 102 years. The largest proportion of detections were reported among those \u22642 years for all types, notably HPIV-1 (32 %), HPIV-2 (26 %), HPIV-3 (41 %), and HPIV-4 (37 %) (Fig. 3) . By gender, 1353 were male (51 %); males significantly predominated for HPIV-2 only.",

We found that nationally, HPIV-4 exhibited a unique circulation pattern, with a winter peak occurring annually. Previously published descriptions of HPIV-4 circulation have been conflicting, finding either a biennial peak in the fall of odd-numbered years or a peak in the winter of each year [6, 7] . These studies were limited in geographic scope, focusing on local circulation patterns which may explain the difference in conclusions. HPIV-1, 2, and 3 were also characterized by distinct circulation patterns. Biennial peaks of HPIV-1 were seen in the winter of oddnumbered years, with a steady decline in the following spring as described in prior studies [1, 6, 20, 21] . Biennial peaks of HPIV-2 were discernable during the winter of even-numbered years. Our analysis of national-level data demonstrates that peaks of these two serotypes were distinct, occurring in alternating-year cycles during the fall of each respective year. HPIV-3 peaks were typically seen annually during the spring and summer, with smaller peaks in the fall occurring at irregular intervals, as previously noted [1, 3, 6, 20] . We noted no substantial differences among regions in seasonal circulation of HPIV, as noted elsewhere [1, 3, 8] .",

As a result, certain laboratories or regions of the US may be overrepresented or underrepresented in the analysis. NREVSS cannot be used to determine prevalence or incidence of infection because reports represent virus detections but not the number of patients testing positive. PHLIP data represent a subset of NREVSS data, limiting our assessment of age and gender of HPIV detections. Molecular panel tests, which contain HPIV, are more frequently ordered among children than adults in NREVSS, which may have affected the age distribution [22] . Additionally, these data include only a limited pool of clinical and sociodemographic factors including information on comorbidities, racial/ethnic background, or clinical course of infection, which limited the ascertainment of clinical associations among the HPIV types. Future studies should explore these other factors. Lastly, while HPIV testing increased over time, this increase may not be representative of viral activity, but a result of increased availability of multiplex molecular panels which contain HPIV targets. Despite these limitations, data collected through NREVSS provides a comprehensive understanding of HPIV trends in the US. The extensive laboratory network routinely reporting to NREVSS allows us to identify circulation patterns and monitor year-to-year changes in HPIV types, including HPIV-4.",

Overall, HPIV testing increased substantially each year (Supplemental Fig. 1). From July 2011 to June 2012, 100,971 HPIV tests were reported to NREVSS, increasing to 536,527 HPIV tests during July 2017-June 2019. The seasonal distribution and annual prevalence of HPIV by type varied considerably. HPIV-1 rose mainly in the summer and peaked in the fall of odd numbered years (2011, 2013, 2015, and 2017) and declined in the spring of the following year. In contrast, HPIV-2 peaked in the fall of even numbered years (2012, 2014, 2016, and 2018), declining in the spring of the following year. HPIV-3 peaked annually in summer",

HPIV-4 was most commonly seen during the fall, peaking in winter of each year (Fig. 1). Each geographic region had a similar distribution of HPIV detections and seasonal patterns to what was observed nationally (Fig. 2). During 2015-2019, 71,419 specimens tested for HPIV were submitted to NREVSS through PHLIP/PHLIS2. Of those tested, 2717 (4 %) were positive for any HPIV: 2675 tests detected a single HPIV type and 42 tests detected two or more HPIV types. Overall, there were 2765 positive HPIV detections: 593 were HPIV-1 (21 %), 475 were HPIV-2 (17 %), 1312 were HPIV-3 (47 %), and 385 were HPIV-4 (14 %).",
