Our current top-down approach will not provide these countries with adequate supplies of vaccines and antiviral agents. Consequently, they will have to use a bottom-up approach based on inexpensive generic agents that either modify the host response to infl uenza virus or act as antiviral agents. Several of these agents have shown promise, and many are currently produced in developing countries. Investigators must primarily identify agents for managing infection in populations and not simply seek explanations for how they work. They must determine in which countries these agents are produced and defi ne patterns of distribution and costs. Because prepandemic research cannot establish whether these agents will be effective in a pandemic, randomized controlled trials must begin immediately after a new pandemic virus has emerged. Without this research, industrialized and developing countries could face an unprecedented health crisis.",

In 2005, WHO established its Southeast Asian Infl uenza Clinical Research Network to study neuraminidase inhibitor treatment of patients infected with viruses that possess pandemic potential (4). However, infl uenza virus A (H1N1) has developed resistance to oseltamivir, and similar antiviral resistance could develop in a future pandemic virus. Five million treatment courses (10 doses per patient) of oseltamivir have been donated to a WHO stockpile, but WHO has no plans to dramatically increase the size of this stockpile. On their own, the governments of a few countries that do not produce infl uenza vaccines or antiviral agents have purchased supplies of oseltamivir, but their stockpiles are suffi cient to treat only 1% of their combined populations (D.S. Fedson, unpub. data). Not surprisingly, developing countries themselves \"will not allocate scarce resources to stockpile signifi cant quantities of oseltamivir for an unpredictable infl uenza pandemic\" (1) . Clearly, the limited supplies of antiviral agents available to developing countries where these infections now occur will scarcely have any effect on a pandemic after it starts to spread.",

In Indonesia, physicians have reported that everyone infected with the clade 2 infl uenza virus A (H5N1) who did not receive antiviral treatment has died (Table 1) (7) . Given extremely limited global supplies of antiviral agents, this is a terrifying observation. If a pandemic virus were to emerge with a level of virulence approaching that of infl uenza virus A (H5N1) in Indonesia, it could lead to a global population collapse. Many infl uenza virologists doubt this will ever happen and believe instead that infl uenza virus (H7N7) or reemergent infl uenza virus (H2N2) could also cause the next pandemic. Chances are they might be right. Moreover, health offi cials in national governments and international agencies estimate that expected pandemic deaths will be no more than what can be extrapolated from the 1918-1920 pandemic (8) . These offi cials seldom, if ever, use the phrases \"population collapse\" or \"population die off,\" and their estimates may also be right. Nonetheless, in a seminal experiment reported in 1974, Webster and Campbell showed that genetic reassortment, the process that gave rise to pandemic viruses in 1957 and 1968, could give rise to a readily transmissible virus of extraordinary virulence (Figure) (9) . This experiment and human experience with infl uenza virus A (H5N1) in Indonesia suggest it would be prudent for all countries to plan for something much worse than what occurred in 1918-1920.",

For the foreseeable future, this top-down approach will be incapable of providing developing countries with timely supplies of affordable vaccines and antiviral agents. (Most industrialized countries that do not produce infl uenza vaccines will have similar diffi culties, at least for the fi rst pandemic wave.) The Indonesian Health Minister, for one, understands this. With little prospect that people in her country will be able to obtain vaccines against pandemic viruses, she precipitated a standoff with WHO by announcing in February 2007 that unless Indonesia is able to gain access to supplies of vaccines against pandemic viruses, her country will no longer share its infl uenza viruses A (H5N1) with WHO's laboratory-based surveillance system (2) . Despite unorthodox arguments (10) , her position has garnered wide support from the health ministers of many developing countries (11) . Recently, Indonesia agreed to share infl uenza virus A (H5N1) sequences (not the viruses themselves) with the Global Initiative on Sharing Avian Infl uenza Data, but the country no longer promptly reports deaths from infl uenza virus A (H5N1), in defi ance of new International Health Regulations. WHO has been unable to come up with a solution to this impasse. In identifying the major issues and challenges of a pandemic threat facing developing countries, Oshitani et al. have called for better preparedness planning, improved systems for medical care and public health, expanded use of nonpharmaceutical interventions, and strengthened core capacities for seasonal infl uenza surveillance and vaccination (1) . They recognize that this is a challenge few developing countries will be able to meet, but go on to say, \"Preparing for a pandemic by simply strengthening preparedness within a single country is not possible. A pandemic is a global issue, and pandemic preparedness should be considered from a global perspective\" (1). In practical terms, what exactly does this mean? The record thus far indicates that truly international efforts to prepare for pandemic vaccination and antiviral use have been meager. In almost all instances, these efforts have been vastly outweighed by efforts that refl ect national concerns and interests.",

            "text": "Many infl uenza scientists doubt this approach will work (14) (15) (16) . Nonetheless, as reviewed elsewhere (13, 14) , several retrospective studies suggest that outpatient statins (drugs taken to lower cholesterol levels and prevent cardiovascular diseases) reduce 30-day pneumonia mortality rates by \u224850% (Table 2 ) (17) (18) (19) (20) (21) (22) . Most investigators agree that these observational studies must be interpreted with caution and that promising results should be followed by prospective clinical trials. One such trial is already under way, and a preliminary report has shown that in 67 pneumonia patients in intensive care units, treatment with statins reduced the hospital mortality rate by 51% (p = 0.026) (23) . Pulmonary investigators also believe that peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) \u03b1 and PPAR\u03b3 agonists (fi brates and glitazones, respectively) could be used to treat acute lung injury (14) . An important experimental study has shown that the fi brate gemfi brozil, a PPAR\u03b1 agonist used to prevent heart disease, reduced mortality rates in mice infected with infl uenza virus (H2N2) by 54% (24) . Statins and PPAR agonists have antiinfl ammatory and immunomodulatory activities, and there is considerable molecular cross-talk between these agents (14) . Moreover, combination treatment is safe, and in patients with cardiovascular diseases, clinical benefi ts are additive. Used either alone or together, this treatment might similarly benefi t patients during an infl uenza pandemic. Other generic agents, some with direct activity against infl uenza virus, should also be considered (14) . Chloroquine, long used as an antimalarial drug, increases endosomal pH and acts as an antiviral agent by impairing virus release into the cytosol. Resveratrol, a polyphenol found in red wine, reduces infl uenza mortality rates in experimentally infected mice (25) . Catechins (found in green tea) (26) and curcumin (turmeric; found in curry powder) (27) have numerous cell-signaling effects, suggesting that they too might be benefi cial. A combination of agents that act on both the host response and the virus might be required.",

Recently, investigators showed that giving a neuraminidase inhibitor to mice infected with infl uenza virus A (H5N1) was not nearly as effective as treating the mice with an antiviral agent and 2 immunomodulatory agents, mesalazine, a PPAR\u03b3 agonist, and celecoxib, a cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 inhibitor (28, 29) . In this model, targeting the host response to infection was essential for improving survival rates and times. More important, 2 studies in mice showed that intratracheal administration of either a fragment of the PB1-F2 protein of the 1918 infl uenza virus (30) or an inactivated infl uenza virus A (H5N1) (31) caused severe acute lung injury similar to that seen in fatal human cases of infl uenza (either from the 1918-1920 pandemic or from the current H5N1 subtype). In these experimental models, there was no virus replication. Thus, antiviral agents would have had no effect. Although we still lack direct evidence that one or more antiinfl ammatory and immunomodulatory agents alone would effectively treat human infl uenza virus A (H5N1) infections, these results and those from the study of infl uenza virus (H2N2)-infected mice treated with gemfi brozil (24) suggest these agents might be effective.",

            "text": "What types of research on generic agents do we need before the pandemic virus appears? First, experimental studies of several candidate treatment regimens must be undertaken in mice infected with infl uenza virus A (H5N1) or 1918-like viruses ( Table 3 ). The agents used in these studies might have antiinfl ammatory and immunomodulatory or antiviral properties (some might have both), but all must be generic agents that are currently produced in developing countries. Admittedly, these experimental studies in mice will have limitations (32), but they should identify avenues for further research. Once a few treatment regimens have been shown to be effective in mice, they should be tested in ferrets. Later, 2 or 3 of the most promising regimens should be tested in nonhuman primates. After demonstrating the effectiveness of 1 or more treatment regimens in animals, infl uenza virologists should then use in vitro systems to defi ne the molecular mechanisms responsible for their protective activity. However, some of these agents will have broader effects on the host response. For example, although administering a COX-2 inhibitor along with a PPAR\u03b3 agonist improved survival rates and times in mice infected with infl uenza virus A (H5N1) (21) , another study showed that selective COX-2 inhibition was detrimental to the resolution of acute lung injury (33) . Most infl uenza scientists focus their research on the virus or on cell-signaling events associated with viral pathogenesis (34) . Yet the pathophysiologic effects of severe infections involve the entire host, something well known to researchers who study sepsis (35) (36) (37) . Their studies have shown that statins and PPAR agonists stabilize myocardial and microvascular function, preserve integrity of pulmonary endothelial cell tight junctions and prevent pulmonary edema, and promote resolution of acute infl ammation (13, 14) . Thus, other investigators with laboratory and clinical expertise in critical care, cardiopulmonary diseases, and endocrinology and metabolism must be recruited to explore in animals the molecular mechanisms underlying these broad treatment effects on the host. However, in undertaking this research, investigators must not forget that their primary goal is to fi nd effective ways to manage a pandemic in populations and not simply to explain in more precise terms the harmful effects of pandemic virus infection in individuals.",

An international process will surely be required for distributing vaccines and antiviral agents, but experience indicates that the process will be slow and cumbersome and supplies of these agents will remain scarce (2). Nonetheless, developing countries will need abundant supplies of effective agents, and abundance will be guaranteed only if these agents are generic, inexpensive, and produced in developing countries themselves.",

Otherwise, developing and industrialized countries alike could be faced with an unprecedented global health crisis. ",

This study was designed to determine whether the selection and transmission of a new reassortant infl uenza A virus could occur under experimental conditions in vivo that mimic what might occur in nature. Reassortment between 2 antigenically distinct infl uenza A viruses was studied in turkeys that had been previously immunized to induce low levels of antibodies to the hemagglutinin (H) of a nonlethal turkey infl uenza virus (Turkey), and to the neuraminidase (N) of a fowl plague virus (FPV), an avian virus that is highly pathogenic for chickens. Twenty-eight days after immunization, the immunized turkeys were sequentially infected, fi rst with the Turkey virus and 4 h later with FPV. During the fi rst few days, both parent viruses were isolated from the infected turkeys, but by day 4 a reassortant virus containing the FPV hemagglutinin and the Turkey neuraminidase (FPV (H) -Turkey (N) ) was also isolated; within 2 days it became the dominant virus. All infected turkeys died, and only the FPV (H) -Turkey (N) reassortant virus could be recovered. In a separate experiment, similarly immunized turkeys were again sequentially infected, but on day 5 a group of nonimmunized or selectively immunized turkeys (Turkey (H) FPV (N) ) were placed in the same room. All contact birds soon died of fulminant infection caused by the FPV (H) -Turkey (N) reassortant virus. These experiments demonstrated that under conditions of selective primary immunity, a new virus could be generated through genetic reassortment in vivo and that this reassortant virus could be readily transmitted to contacts. The reassortant virus caused uniformly fatal disease in primary infected and contact birds. Thus, under the conditions of these experiments, genetic reassortment gave rise to a new infl uenza virus that led to a total population collapse. Adapted from Webster and Campbell(9).",
