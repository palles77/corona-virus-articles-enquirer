A total of 231 adenovirus-positive respiratory, ocular swab, stool and other specimens from 219 patients collected between April 2010 and April 2011 were included in the study. After a real-time PCR amplification targeting the adenovirus hexon gene, the array-in-well assay identified the presence of B03 (n = 122; 57.5% of patients), E04 0.5%) and F41 (1; 0.5%) genotypes among the clinical sample panel. The typing result was obtained for all specimens that could be amplified (n = 223; 97%), and specificity of the typing was confirmed by sequencing specimens representing each of the different genotypes. No hybridization signal was obtained in adenovirus-negative specimens or specimens with other viruses (n = 30). The array-in-well hybridization assay has great potential as a rapid and multiplex platform for the typing of clinically relevant human adenovirus genotypes in different specimen types.",

            "text": "Human adenoviruses (hAdVs) belong to the genus Mastadenovirus of the family Adenoviridae. There are presently 57 different hAdV types grouped into seven species A to G [1] . Different types cause a wide range of acute and chronic diseases. Acute respiratory disease is predominantly caused by the hAdV types C01, C02, E04, C05 and C06; occasionally by types B03 and B07, whereas gastroenteritis is most commonly associated with the types F40 and F41 [2] [3] [4] . In all age groups, the hAdV infection can include asymptomatic infection or may provoke serious illnesses such as pneumonia (types B03, E04, B07, B14 and B21) or epidemic keratocon-junctivitis (types D08, D19 and D37) [5] [6] [7] [8] . Types E04 and B07 have also caused severe outbreaks of respiratory illness among military recruits [9] . Human AdVs can cause especially severe disease among infants, young children, immunocompromised patients and transplant recipients [10] [11] [12] and hAdV infections occur worldwide as endemic, epidemic and sporadic infections. Therefore, genotype-specific analysis is important for epidemiological studies to provide information on the incidence and distribution of infections by individual hAdV types. Genotype identification is also necessary for the detection of new strains and for understanding hAdV pathogenesis.",

The serological detection methods are usually time-consuming, labourintensive and do not permit a reliable detection of all hAdV serotypes. The availability of rapid diagnostic methods providing uncompromised analytical performance would allow more efficient screening and identification of the pathogen. Today, genotyping by molecular methods such as PCR targeting the hexon or fibre gene, followed by amplicon sequencing or digestion of the amplicon with different restriction enzymes, is often preferred over serotyping [14] . Recently, PCR-based microsphere array and reverse line blot hybridization methods have been described for the detection and differentiation of hAdV genotypes [15, 16] . Another approach to multiplex detection is the microarray analysis, which holds great potential for the detection and typing of pathogens. Microarray techniques are flexible, rapid and suitable for high throughput analysis. The sensitivity of PCR and the specificity of DNA hybridization can be combined when the microarray technology is used for the detection and typing of adenoviruses.",

Although not all hAdV prototypes were available for in vitro testing, in silico analyses gave a specific pattern for most of the targeted genotypes. Predictably, F40 would not be differentiable from F41 just as B14 was not differentiable from B11. Another weakness is that the PCR method alone is not sufficiently specific for hAdV detection. However, the assay has some attractive advantages compared with other assays. First, the hybridization assay is performed in 96-well microtitre plates allowing the use of common laboratory equipment, and the assay is easy to carry out. Second, microtitre plates enable the analysis of 96 samples at one time. When necessary, it is also possible to add more probes to the 96-well microtitre plate, enabling the typing of additional hAdV genotypes in one assay. During the study period, an outbreak of hAdV type B03 infections occurred in the autumn of 2010. Type B03 was commonly associated with conjunctivitis (n = 79; 68%), and respiratory diseases (40; 47%). A study conducted in 2010 [25] reported that restriction enzyme analysis identified three genetic variant types, including two newly described variants, Ad3a50 and Ad3a51. New variant types could be a reason for the high incidence of B03 infections in this study.",
