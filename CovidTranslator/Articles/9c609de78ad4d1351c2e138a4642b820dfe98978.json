Some parts of the world, however, have been left out of the discussion for several years, as is the case of Latin America, only more recently addressed by Pizam (1999) . Also, only a limited number of researchers have approached the topic of tourism education provision in countries of the region, such as Charles (1997) , who wrote about the past and future development of tourism and hospitality education and training in the Caribbean region and Knowles, Teixeira, and Egan (2003) who presented a comparison of tourism and hospitality education in Brazil and in the United Kingdom (UK).",

Tourism education is seen as a problematic issue in the region and as one of the major reasons for the lack of qualified human resources in the sector. Both, employers and National Tourism Organisations, perceive the material taught in tourism education in institutions from their own countries as irrelevant to the real needs of the 'industry'.

Brazilian provision of education is highly regulated by the government through the Ministry of Education and the Federal Council of Education. The government is the main pre-university education provider, with only a small share of the provision of this level of education in the hands of private institutions. At the tertiary level, on the other hand, the number of private Higher Education Institutions has increased significantly since the New Education Principles and Guidelines Act (Lei de Diretrizes e Bases), which sets out the structure of the Brazilian education system (Brazil, 1996) . The liberalisation of the education sector in Brazil and other Latin American countries was a result of the subordination to multilateral agencies, such as the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and the World Trade Organization, which sponsor projects and programmes in the country and directly influence the education policies according to their own interests (Antunes, 2002; Santos, 2002) . Even with a significant increase in the supply of higher education in the country, the percentage of youngsters aged between 18 and 24 that get to university education is only 12%, that is, the smallest in Latin America (Gomes, 2004) .",

A bachelor degree in tourism, for instance, has to have at least 3000 course hours spread over a minimum of 4 years (Ansarah, 2002) . Besides the traditional route to higher education (4-year programmes), industry-oriented 2-year programmes are a recent addition to the provision. All undergraduate curricula are fixed and specified by government bodies and have a similar core curriculum in each subject area, which facilitates the organisation and standardisation of programmes. This approach, however, generally overlooks the regional needs of some parts of the country. At the postgraduate level, there are two main routes available to students, the Iato seii~u programmes and the stricto sensu ones. The former encompasses taught programmes with a minimum of 360 course hours. Such programmes do not award degree titles, just certificates, and are vocational in essence, directed to the development of professional skills. The stricto sensu programmes are the equivalent to MPhil programmes and the doctorates, with a minimum of 2 4 years, respectively. Their objectives are mainly academic and scientific. There is also the vocational masters' degree (Mestrudo Pro~ssionulizui~te), which attempts to research and apply specific knowledge to the context of the professional world.",

The 1990s, on the other hand, represented a milestone in the provision of higher education in Brazil. During this period, the number of tourism programmes increased considerablymore than 900% according to Teixeira (2001) . The fourth phase, according to Ansarah (2002) , will be marked by a search for a balance between quantity and quality of programmes. Alternative curricula will be developed and unconventional programme titles (e.g. Events Management, Eco-tourism, Recreation, etc.) will be created in order to meet the particular needs of each region of the country.",

However, the number of research degree programmes is still far lower than the country's needs, especially when it comes to the need for qualified lecturers for the numerous undergraduate programmes. In 2004, there were only four programmes that were the equivalent to the UK's MPhil and only two doctorate programmes (Lohmann, 2004) . These numbers are better understood when contrasted with the bigger picture. In 2000, there were a total of 1490 research masters' programmes and 821 doctorate programmes available in the country.' Although tourism has been the subject of postgraduate research in several programmes, the first postgraduate tourism degree programme was only created in 1993 (Rejowski, 1996) . Taught masters' programmes, 'industry'-oriented, on the other hand, have grown considerably over the last years. Most private institutions offering tourism education at the undergraduate level see postgraduate taught programmes as a market opportunity to attract more students. However, supply is becoming greater than demand and several programmes do not have a sufficient number of students to start off a group.

The sustainability of the tourism education sector in the country might be under threat because of the high number of institutions and graduates (Mota, 2003) in a market that, as Pizam (1999) highlights, perceives low standards of quality and irrelevance of what is being taught in the programmes to the real needs of the 'industry'.

The creation of the country's first tourism programme at the postgraduate level, however, was a milestone for the further development of tourism research. In addition to the offering of tourism research degree programmes, the establishment of academic journals and the publication of tourism-related books also helped Brazilian tourism research to grow. According to Panosso Netto (2003) , knowledge development in Brazil faces several limitations and, as a result, cutting-edge research is generally outdated when compared to the state of the art internationally. He notes that the epistemology of tourism, for instance, has been seriously discussed by international researchers for over 40 years, whereas the topic has only been the focus of attention in Brazil for a decade or so.",

Currently, there are only four refereed journals in the country acknowledged by most members of the tourism academic community. The growing number of tourism education providers and tourism journals in Brazil, in addition to the increasing interest about it in the academy and the easier access to international cutting-edge research, may lead to the consolidation of a knowledge base of tourism as a research topic. It is argued, however, that the majority of Brazilian tourism research may still lack conceptual, theoretical and methodological maturity. Lohmann (2004) , while making a comparison between tourism research in Brazil and Australia, argues that there is no Brazilian similar to the Council for Australian University Tourism and Hospitality Education (CAUTHE). As a result, there is no academic conference in the country directed to tourism experts and no outlet for cutting-edge research. However, he also notes that the recent creation of the National Association of Postgraduate Tourism Programmes (ANPTUR in the Portuguese acronym), is expected to help promote tourism research in Brazil while giving researchers the opportunity for networking. It is also important to note that several other initiatives, such as the Tourism Research Seminar of MERCOSUR5 (the Southern Cone Common Market), organised by the Universidade de Information available at the portal from where researchers within the institutions' networks access the journals http://www.presidentekennedy.br/retur. MERCOSUR is a free-trade organisation founded by Argentine, Brazil. Paraguay and Uruguay in the 1990s.",
