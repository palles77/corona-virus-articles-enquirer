Targets for the prophylactic or therapeutic interventions include interaction of the spike (S) glycoprotein (S1 domain) with the host cell receptor, fusion of the S2 domain with the host cell membrane, processing of the replicase polyproteins by the virus-encoded proteases (3C-like cysteine protease [3CLpro] and papain-like cysteine protease) and other virus-encoded enzymes such as the NTPase/helicase and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. Human monoclonal antibody blocking S1 may play an important role in the immunoprophylaxis of SARS. Fusion inhibitors reminiscent of enfuvirtide in the case of HIV may also be developed for SARS-CoV. Various peptidomimetic and nonpeptidic inhibitors of 3CLpro have been described, the best ones inhibiting SARS-CoV replication with a selectivity index greater than 1000. Human interferons, in particular \u03b1and \u03b2-interferon, as well as short interfering RNAs could further be pursued for the control of SARS. Various other compounds, often with an ill-defined mode of action but selectivity indexes up to 100, have been reported to exhibit in vitro activity against SARS-CoV: valinomycin, glycopeptide antibiotics, plant lectins, hesperetin, glycyrrhizin, aurintricarboxylic acid, chloroquine, niclosamide, nelfinavir and calpain inhibitors.",

There are essentially two regions, the replicase region and the structural region. The replicase region encompasses two overlapping open reading frames (ORFs 1a and 1b). A translational readthrough by a -1 position ribosomal frameshift allows the translation of the overlapping reading frames into a single polyprotein. Virusencoded proteases, namely the papain-like cysteine protease (PLpro) and the picornavirus Expert Rev. Anti Infect. Ther. 4(2), (2006) 3C-like cysteine protease (3CLpro) cleave the polyprotein into the individual polypeptides required for replication and transcription [8] . The remaining one third of the genome encodes for at least four structural proteins: spike protein (S), envelope protein (E), membrane glycoprotein (M) and nucleocapsid protein (N). Several additional genes encoding additional nonstructural proteins are known as 'accessory genes'. This review will evaluate the different gene products encoded by the SARS-CoV genome as possible points of attack for chemotherapeutic (or prophylactic) agents, thereby reviewing the various strategies that have already been proposed to curb (treat or prevent) a potential SARS-CoV infection. These approaches have to be viewed in the framework of antivirals and antiviral strategies against virus infections at large [11] .",

ACE2 expression in cell lines correlates with their susceptibility to SARS-CoV S-driven infection, suggesting that ACE2 must be a major receptor for SARS-CoV. This, in turn, suggests that the SARS-CoV S protein may be considered as an attractive target for therapeutic intervention [13] . Interestingly, ACE2 expression positively correlated with the differentiation state of human airway epithelia; undifferentiated cells expressing little ACE2 were poorly infected with SARS-CoV, while well differentiated cells expressing more ACE2 were readily infected [14] .",

Systemic peptide mapping has shown that the site of interaction between the HR1 and HR2 regions is between residues 916 and 950 of HR1 and residues 1151-1185 of HR2 [18] . It has also been shown that a peptide, CP-1, derived from the HR2 region, inhibits SARS-CoV infection in the micromolar range: CP-1 bound with high affinity to a peptide from the HR1 region, NP-1 (FIGURE 2) [19]. CP-1 could bind to the HR1 region, thereby interfering with the conformational changes leading to the 6-helix bundle formation (FIGURE 3) and the therewith associated virus-cell fusion process. Obviously, the HR1-HR2 interaction may be viewed as an attractive target for the design of potent peptide-type SARS-CoV entry inhibitors [20, 21] , reminiscent of the HIV-1 gp41 HR2-derived peptide T20 (enfuvirtide) which has been developed as a HIV-1 fusion inhibitor [22] .

The Phe-Phe dipeptide inhibitor shown in FIGURE 7 was found to inhibit the 3CL protease at an IC 50 of 1 \u00b5M (K i = 0.52) and inhibited [38] . Cinanserin (SQ 10,643, a well characterized serotonin antagonist) (FIGURE 8) is another example of an inhibitor of SARS-CoV replication which may act via inhibition of the 3CL protease (IC 50 for the enzyme = 5 \u00b5M; EC 50 values for reduction of viral RNA and infectious particles ranging from 19 to 34 \u00b5M) [39] . Finally, an octapeptide, designed for the SARS-CoV Mpro, namely AVLQSGFR, was reported to inhibit SARS-CoV replication in Vero cells at an EC 50 of 0.027 \u00b5g/ml, while not being cytotoxic at 100 \u00b5g/ml, thus establishing a selectivity index of greater than 3700 [40] . Whether this highly selective antiviral effect was actually mediated by an inhibition of the SARS-CoV Mpro was not ascertained in this study [40] . In addition to 3CLpro, a PLpro is encoded by the SARS-CoV genome. SARS-CoV PLpro processes the replicase polyprotein at three conserved cleavage sites, thus generating the nonstructural proteins NSP1, NSP2 and NSP3. It was recently demonstrated that SARS-CoV PLpro also had deubiquitinating activity [41, 42] . The possibility that SARS-CoV PLpro could deubiquitinate host or viral proteins has added a higher level of functional complexity to this enzyme, and should, in principle, elevate the value of SARS-CoV PLpro as a potential target for therapeutic intervention.",

In fact, non-nucleoside HIV-1 reverse transcriptase inhibitors were shown to have no evident inhibitory effect on SARS-CoV RdRp activity [46] . It is intriguing that during purification, the full-length SARS-CoV RdRp was unstable and was hydrolytically cleaved into three fragments, a N-terminal p12 fragment, a middle p30 fragment and a C-terminal p64 fragment comprising the catalytic domain. The cause of the cleavage is unclear. Nor is it clear whether this cleavage also occurs in the viral life cycle [46] . At present, few, if any, nucleoside analogs have been recognized as specific inhibitors of the SARS-CoV RdRp. There is N 4 -hydroxycytidine, which has been accredited with both anti-HCV and anti-SARS-CoV effects. Against SARS-CoV it proved active at an EC 50 of 10 \u00b5M (selectivity index \u2265 10) [24] .

RNA endonuclease activity is unusual among positivestrand RNA viruses, suggesting that, because it specifically occurs during SARS-CoV replication, it could be considered a target for antiviral drug development. This pertains, in particular, NSP15, to an Mn 2+ -dependent endoribonuclease that specifically cleaves RNA at unpaired uridylate residues. The role of NSP15, which consists of six subunits (arranged as a dimer of trimers) [47] in the CoV infection process, still remains to be elucidated.",

When 80R IgG1 was given prophylactically to mice at doses therapeutically achievable in humans, viral replication was reduced by more than four orders of magnitude to below assay limits. The results demonstrated that the vast majority of SARS-CoVs isolated thus far remain sensitive to 80R.

To enable this approach, carbohydrate-binding agents, such as the Hippeastrum hybrid (amaryllis), Galanthus nivalis (snowdrop) and Urtica dioica mannose-or N-acetylglucosamine-binding lectins could be used to cause deletions, upon repeated exposure (passages), of the glycosylation sites in the SARS-CoV envelope in order to expose the carbohydrate-hidden epitopes to both active (vaccine) and passive (antibody) immune responses.",

These observations were subsequently confirmed in several other studies [55] [56] [57] [58] . IFN-\u03b2 exhibited potent antiviral activity at doses that had been shown to have acceptable safety profiles [55] . Also, IFN-\u03b1 showed an in vitro inhibitory effect starting at concentrations of 1000 IU/ml [56] . In contrast with type I IFNs (\u03b1, \u03b2), type II IFN (\u03b3) had little, if any, inhibitory effect on SARS-CoV replication [57] . The human MxA protein is one of the most prominent proteins induced by IFN-\u03b2. Nevertheless, no interference with SARS-CoV replication was observed in Vero cells stably expressing MxA, which implies that other IFN-induced proteins must be responsible for the strong inhibitory activity of IFN-\u03b2 against SARS-CoV [58] . IFN-\u03b2, in conjunction with IFN-\u03b3, was found to synergistically inhibit the replication of SARS-CoV in Vero cells [59] , and a preliminary uncontrolled study with the IFN alfacon-1 (a synthetic IFN-\u03b1 designed to represent a consensus IFN-\u03b1) suggested that this type of IFN, in combination with corticosteroids might be effective in vivo in the treatment of SARS [60] . Furthermore, a CpG oligodeoxynucleotide, which is able to induce human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) to produce high levels of IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2, has been accredited with strong activity against SARS-CoV in vitro [61] .",

Exogenous synthetic siRNAs can also be incorporated into the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), thereby bypassing the requirement for dsRNA processing by Dicer. In the second phase, a helicase present in RISC unwinds the duplex siRNA, which then pairs by means of its unwound antisense strand to its target messenger RNA (mRNA) that bears a high degree of sequence complementarity to the siRNA. An RNAse (Slicer) within RISC then proceeds to degrade the target mRNA at sites not bound by the siRNA, that is, 10 nucleotides upstream of the 5\u00b4-most residue of the siRNA-target mRNA duplex [63] .",

I. indigotica root (Radix isatidis) is native to China. From the I. indigotica root extracts several compounds, that is, indigo, sinigrin, aloe-emodin and hesperetin, were isolated that inhibited the cell-free and cell-based cleavage activity of the SARS Mpro (3CLpro) at IC 50 values ranging from 10 to 1000 \u00b5M [73] . The inhibitory effects on SARS-CoV replication in cell culture (i.e., Vero cells) were not determined in this study. The cytotoxicity was determined, however, and, based on the ratio of the CC 50 to the IC 50 (cellbased cleavage), hesperetin appeared to be the most selective (selectivity index: \u223c300) [73] . Glycyrrhizin, another plant product that has been isolated from the licorice root (Glycyrrhiza radix), is known as an antiinflammatory substance in Chinese medicine. Glycyrrhizin consists of one molecule of glycyrrhetinic acid linked to two molecules of glucuronic acid (FIGURE 12 ). It has long since been recognized as an antiviral substance, active in vitro against both DNA and RNA viruses, including HIV [74, 75] . Glycyrrhizin has also been shown to inhibit the replication of SARS-CoV, but only at a concentration (EC 50 : 300 \u00b5g/ml or \u223c365 \u00b5M) that would be difficult to achieve in vivo [76] . Through the introduction of certain chemical modifications it proved possible to increase the antiviral potency of glycyrrhizin, but, as these modifications also increased the cytotoxicity, the selectivity index of the glycyrrhizin derivatives was reduced as compared with that of glycyrrhizin (selectivity index: \u226565) [77] .",

Thus, the selectivity index of ATA was estimated to be 187 [78] . The anti-SARS-CoV activity of ATA was tentatively attributed to an inhibitory effect on the viral RdRp [79] . It should be recognized, however, that ATA, which is commonly represented in its monomeric structure but actually occurs as a heterogenous mixture of polymers (FIGURE 13) , is able to bind to, and inhibit, a variety of proteins and cellular processes [80, 81] . ATA has since long been known as an inhibitor of HIV replication [82] , and its anti-HIV activity is at least partially mediated by a specific interaction with the HIV cell receptor CD4 [83] .",

            "text": "It could be postulated that to become a potential anti-SARS candidate drug, the SARS-CoV inhibitor should possess a selectivity index of greater than 100, equally importantly an EC 50 of not (much) higher than 1-3 \u00b5M, so as to be able to achieve sufficiently high plasma (and tissue) drug levels upon systemic administration. Thus, qualifying as potential anti-SARS drug candidates are some of the calpain inhibitors [23, 24] and 3CLpro inhibitors, for example, the Phe-Phe dipeptide inhibitor shown in FIGURE 7 [38] , which exhibited an EC 50 of 0.18 \u00b5M and a selectivity index greater than 1000. Also, the octapeptide, AVLQSGFR, with an EC 50 of 0.027 \u00b5g/ml (selectivity index >3700) [40] seems quite promising following the proposed criteria, and thus would be a number of the miscellaneous compounds such as valinomycin [69] , niclosamide [90] and nelfinavir [91] . Of equal, if not greater, importance is proof of efficacy against SARS in the in vivo setting, which remains to be provided with the aforementioned compounds. Such proof of principle exists for human mAbs [48, 49] , IFN-\u03b1 [62] and siRNA [66] , which means that, should SARS-CoV, or a similar CoV, re-emerge, attempts could be immediately undertaken to prevent and/or treat these infections with human mAbs, IFN and/or siRNA. Being commercially available at present, IFNs (PEG-IFN-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b2 and alfacon-1 etc.) should possibly be considered the best choice to curb SARS, should it strike again.",
