            "text": "Feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) is a fatal systemic viral disease caused by infection with mutated feline coronavirus (FCoV). 1 There is a spectrum of biotypes in FCoVs of varying pathogenicity; for example, the highly virulent FIP virus (FIPV) replicates in macrophages. FIPVs can have nucleotide substitutions in multiple genomic regions of FCoV, including two common substitutions in the genes encoding the putative fusion peptide of the spike protein. 2 FIP, which is most prevalent among younger cats, 3 can be classified into three forms based on clinical findings: (1) the effusive form, characterised by First identification of a single amino acid change in the spike protein region of feline coronavirus detected from a coronavirus-associated cutaneous nodule in a cat an accumulation of protein-enriched ascites and/or pleural effusion; (2) the non-effusive form, characterised by granulomatous inflammatory lesions in several organs; and (3) a mixed form.",

[4] [5] [6] Two of those cases had clinical signs of the non-effusive form of FIP, with ocular and/or kidney involvement, whereas the third case had clinical signs of the mixed form of FIP, with ocular and renal involvement as well as pleural effusion. All three cats in these studies were <2 years old, and they developed papular-to-nodular skin lesions. Histopathologically, the skin lesions reported previously were characterised by a perivascular pyogranulomatous inflammatory reaction in the dermis to subcutis. The presence of coronavirus antigen in macrophages within the skin lesions was confirmed by immunohistochemistry in all three cases. However, genetic evidence of mutated FCoV in the cutaneous lesions of FIP has not been reported. Here, we describe a feline case in which a nucleotide mutation in the FCoV spike gene was identified by real-time reverse transcription (RT)-PCR in a coronavirus-associated cutaneous nodule. The mutation was consistent with previous FCoV mutations commonly associated with FIP. 7",

The cat also had a history of sneezing and nasal discharge from 3 months of age. The cat had received vaccinations against feline herpesvirus (FHV), feline calicivirus (FCV), and feline parvovirus three times each; the primary vaccination was administered at 2 months of age, and booster vaccinations were administered at the age of 3 months and at 1 year and 4 months. Beginning at the age of 2 years and 5 months, unilateral stomatitis in the right mandible became evident. Neither the owner nor the referring veterinarian noticed oral pain in the cat. Although the cat did not show decreased appetite, the cat had lost approximately 0.5 kg of body weight in the previous 6 months. The cat was kept with another Singapura cat that did not show similar clinical signs. Neither of the two cats had received flea-prevention treatments.",

Quantitative PCR for FCoV of a peripheral blood sample yielded negative results (limit of detection: 1 \u00d7 10 3 RNA copies/ml), 10 indicating that the positive detection of FCoV in the skin lesion was not caused by contamination with virus from the peripheral blood. To improve anaemia, the cat received a blood transfusion from a donor cat with blood type A after a crossmatch test. The cat also received intravenous fluid therapy to treat dehydration. The anaemia improved temporarily after the blood transfusion (PCV 27.9%; erythrocytes 585 \u00d7 10 4 cells/\u00b5l; haemoglobin 9.6 g/dl) but worsened again owing to a relapse 28 days after the initial presentation (PCV 11.7%; erythrocytes 228 \u00d7 10 4 cells/\u00b5l; haemoglobin 3.7 g/dl). Fever and dehydration improved from day 1 after therapy and, together with the skin lesion and nasal discharge, remained stable for 10 days. The cat left the hospital at the request of the owner.

Fever and hyperglobulinaemia with polyclonal gammopathy are suggestive of FIP. Hepatic nodules and anaemia are occasionally recognised in cats with noneffusive FIP, but FCoV was not identified in the hepatic nodules of the present case. Based on our collective histopathological and immunohistochemical findings, along with molecular diagnostics and high titre of serum anti-FCoV antibodies, we suspected that the present case had a predominantly cutaneous type of non-effusive FIP that has not previously been described in the literature. As the present case had upper respiratory signs and stomatitis, concurrent FHV or FCV infections were also considered; however, we did not investigate those viruses because the nodular dermatitis with histopathology of pyogranulomatous inflammation did not strongly support the diagnoses.",
