Keywords: SARS-Cov-2; COVID-19; asymptomatic infection In December 2019, the infection of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2) was initially emerged in Wuhan. It quickly became a major epidemic threat in the whole China[1]. Like other parts of China, Sichuan is a province affected by imported cases, and had its first confirmed 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) patient reported on 21st January. Later, a county named Daofu in Ganzi Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture in western Sichuan province experienced an outbreak of SARS-Cov-2 infection in February. Particularly, Ganzi is renowned as a hypoxic plateau area and the population there is made up of mainly Tibetans. Therefore, patients in Ganzi by nature have different geographic and ethnic characteristics compared to patients in many other regions of China. Indeed, in our previous analyses of 83 cases with polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-confirmed SARS-Cov-2 infection collected from a local hospital, we noted divergent characteristics of Tibetans infected cases, characterizing by a considerable proportion of asymptomatic carriers (18/83, 21.7% ),",
