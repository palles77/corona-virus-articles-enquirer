            "text": "The human mitochondrial RNA polymerase (h-mtRNAP) serves as both the transcriptase for expression and the primase for replication of mitochondrial DNA. As such, the enzyme is of fundamental importance to cellular energy metabolism, and defects in its function may be related to human disease states. Here we describe in vitro analysis of the h-mtRNAP kinetic mechanism for single, correct nucleotide incorporation. This was made possible by the development of efficient methods for expression and purification of h-mtRNAP using a bacterial system and by utilization of assays that rely on simple, synthetic RNA/DNA scaffolds without the need for mitochondrial transcription accessory proteins. We find that h-mtRNAP accomplishes singlenucleotide incorporation by using the same core steps, including conformational change steps before and after chemistry, that are prototypical for most types of nucleic acid polymerases. The polymerase binds to scaffolds via a two-step mechanism consisting of a fast initial-encounter step followed by a much slower isomerization that leads to catalytic competence. A substantial solvent deuterium kinetic isotope effect was observed for the forward reaction, but none was detectable for the reverse reaction, suggesting that chemistry is at least partially rate-limiting in the forward direction but not in the reverse. h-mtRNAP appears to exercise much more stringent surveillance over base than over sugar in determining the correctness of a nucleotide. The utility of developing the robust in vitro assays described here and of establishing a baseline of kinetic performance for the wild-type enzyme is that biological questions concerning h-mtRNAP may now begin to be addressed.",

            "text": "Interest in mitochondrial molecular biology and biochemistry has increased over the past decade as data implicating mitochondrial dysfunction in a variety of human diseases and aging processes have accumulated. [1] [2] [3] The range of pathologies now suspected of having a basis in altered mitochondrial function includes, among others, certain cancers, neurodegenerative disorders, muscular dystrophies, and cardiac diseases. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] Although our understanding of which specific defects in mitochondrial molecular biology give rise to particular disease states is improving, [3] [4] [5] 8 very little information about the influence of defective transcription of the mitochondrial genome on human health is available. [9] [10] [11] The human mitochondrial RNA polymerase (h-mtRNAP, also known as POLRMT) produces RNA from the mitochondrial genome, 12, 13 with the help of several accessory proteins. 12, 13 The mitochondrial transcription accessory proteins best characterized to date are h-mtTFA, h-mtTFB2, and h-mtTERF. 12, 13 The human mitochondrial genome consists of only ~16.6 kb of DNA encoding 13 protein subunits, two rRNAs, and 22 tRNAs, all essential to the oxidative phosphorylation pathway, which produces nearly all cellular ATP. [12] [13] [14] h-mtRNAP also serves as the primase for mitochondrial DNA replication. 12, 13, 15 Although mitochondria are believed to be derived from an \u03b1-proteobacterium that took up residence in an early ancestor of current eukaryotic cells, 14 mtRNAPs share no recognizable amino acid sequence similarity with multisubunit bacterial RNAPs. 16, 17 They do, however, share amino acid sequence similarity with the single-subunit T-odd bacteriophage class of RNAPs, 16, 17 of which T7 RNAP is the paradigm. 18, 19 The regions that are the most similar are clustered in a number of subdomains arranged colinearly over the carboxyl two-thirds of mtRNAP sequence. 16, 17 In all species, the mtRNAP is encoded by the nuclear genome and imported into mitochondria. 14 Therefore, it appears that eukaryotes recruited a singlesubunit phage DNA-directed RNA polymerase to transcribe their mitochondrial genomes.",

BL21(DE3)pCG1 cells containing the pET26Ub-h-mtRNAP plasmid were grown in 100 mL of medium (NZCYM) supplemented with kanamycin (25 \u03bcg/mL), chloramphenicol (20 \u03bcg/mL), and dextrose (0.4%) at 37 \u00b0C until an OD 600 of 1.0 was reached. This culture was then used to inoculate 4 L of K25, C20-supplemented medium, to an OD 600 of 0.1. The cells were grown at 37 \u00b0C to an OD 600 of 0.8-1.0 and then cooled to 25 \u00b0C. Protein expression was induced via addition of isopropyl \u03b2-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG, 0.5 mM) and grown at 25 \u00b0C for 4 h. The cells were harvested by centrifugation and then frozen and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C until they were used.

The cell suspension was lysed by being passed through a French press (SLM-AMINCO). Lysates were clarified by centrifugation for 30 min at 25000 rpm (75000g) and 4 \u00b0C, and the clarified lysate was decanted and precipitated with ammonium sulfate to a final concentration of 40%. The ammonium sulfate-precipitated material was suspended in 10 mM CAPS (pH 10.0), 20% glycerol, 10 mM BME, 0.1% NP-40, 500 mM NaCl, and protease inhibitors, and polyethyleneimine (PEI) was slowly added to the solution to a final concentration of 0.25% (v/v) to precipitate nucleic acids. The PEI supernatant was decanted and then diluted into 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 20% glycerol, 10 mM BME, and 0.1% NP40 to a final NaCl concentration of 200 mM.

After being loaded, the column was washed with 2 column volumes of buffer A containing 200 mM NaCl. The column was then washed a second time with 2 column volumes of buffer A containing 350 mM NaCl. Protein was eluted from the phosphocellulose column with buffer A containing 1 M NaCl.

Therefore, complex stability before nucleotide incorporation was examined with the assay design shown in Figure S2a It was unclear whether a nucleotide incorporation event, the length of the scaffold RNA primer, or the length of the scaffold RNA/DNA duplex was the major determinant for the increased stability of the h-mtRNAP-scaffold complex after nucleotide incorporation. Therefore, h-mtRNAP-scaffold complex stability assays were performed with a scaffold that contained an RNA primer that was longer by one nucleotide at the 3\u2032-terminus relative to the 8 bp scaffold, thus providing a 9 bp duplex (Figure 3a ). In addition, h-mtRNAPscaffold complex stability assays were performed with a scaffold that contained an RNA primer that was longer by one nucleotide at the 5\u2032-terminus, providing 8 bp of duplex ( Figure In summary, h-mtRNAP can readily utilize 8 bp scaffolds for RNA elongation, but complexes before nucleotide incorporation exhibit low stability. In contrast, h-mtRNAP complexes with 9 bp scaffolds are quite stable before nucleotide incorporation. These data indicate that RNA/DNA duplex length is a major determinant of the stability of h-mtRNAPnucleic acid scaffold complexes, rather than completion of a nucleotide incorporation event or RNA primer length per se. Despite the stability differences for h-mtRNAP-scaffold complexes, no differences in trypsin cleavage patterns were observed for h-mtRNAP whether it was free in solution, complexed with an 8 or 9 bp scaffold, or complexed with a scaffold after nucleotide incorporation ( Figure S4a of the Supporting Information).",

In the presence of solvent D 2 O, all exchangeable protons will be replaced with deuterons, including sites on the enzyme and substrate. Isotopic replacement that involves a chemical bond that is broken or formed in the rate-limiting step will lead to a kinetic isotope effect. In polymerase reactions, this includes abstraction of the proton from the 3\u2032-hydroxyl of the terminal nucleotide of the RNA primer to activate the attacking nucleophile. In addition, it has been shown that polymerases make use of an active site amino acid residue that functions as a general acid to protonate the pyrophosphate leaving group. 31 Therefore, during polymerase catalysis, two exchangeable protons are transferred in the transition state 26 and replacement of protons with deuterons will result in a SDKIE if phosphoryl transfer is rate-limiting. Estimates of k obs for AMP incorporation at near-saturating ATP concentrations were obtained in H 2 O and in D 2 O in the chemical-quench-flow experiments (Figure 7a,b) . The k obs in H 2 O was found to be 42 \u00b1 2 s \u22121 , a value consistent with k pol values in Figure 6 . The k obs in D 2 O was 13 \u00b1 1 s \u22121 . Therefore, a first estimate of the SDKIE from chemical-quench-flow assays was 3.2.",

The amplitude of product formation in pulse-chase-quench reactions was approximately 30% larger than with the pulse-quench assay design. More product formation under pulse-chase-quench conditions reveals the presence of an isomerized ternary complex and the occurrence of a kinetically significant conformational rearrangement immediately prior to chemistry. 32 The larger end point amplitude further reveals the presence of a conformational rearrangement that functions as a \"kinetic roadblock\" after chemistry. 32, 33 These findings along with the SDKIE on nucleotide incorporation (Figure 7) indicate that chemistry is bracketed before and after by conformational rearrangements and that the three steps are co-rate-limiting for nucleotide incorporation.",

On the basis of comparison of specificity constants, k pol /K d,app , the kinetics of nucleotide incorporation differed by 3-fold for correct ATP (0.4 \u03bcM \u22121 s \u22121 for the 9 bp scaffold and 1.5 \u03bcM \u22121 s \u22121 for the 8 bp scaffold) and were essentially identical for the two scaffolds for GTP and 2\u2032-dATP misincorporation. This finding leads to the conclusion that the 8 bp scaffold is also suitable for evaluation of the kinetics of nucleotide incorporation by h-mtRNAP.",

Most of the soluble fraction of the polymerase binds irreversibly to nucleic acids if standard procedures for purification of nucleic acid polymerases are utilized during and immediately after cell lysis. h-mtRNAP is susceptible to proteolytic degradation and requires the presence of protease inhibitors throughout the purification procedure. Contaminating DNases and RNases will copurify with h-mtRNAP if specific measures are not taken to avoid this in the late stages of purification. The methods described here overcome these difficulties. In addition, we recently showed that h-mtRNAP expressed and purified with this approach accomplishes in vitro mitochondrial promoter-dependent transcription with the help of transcription accessory proteins, demonstrating biochemically relevant activity. 36 h-mtRNAP readily uses small, synthetic RNA/DNA scaffolds as substrates for nucleotide addition. These scaffolds were shown to be utilized by T7 RNAP for promoter-independent RNA elongation. 30 Our reasoning for testing T7 RNAP scaffolds with h-mtRNAP was based on the evolutionary relatedness between these single-subunit DdRps. 16, 17 Complexes between h-mtRNAP and 8 bp duplex scaffolds exhibited low stability, whereas complexes with 9 bp duplex scaffolds were approximately 100-fold more stable (Figure 3 ). McAllister and co-workers observed that T7 RNAP prefers scaffolds with 8 bp of RNA/DNA duplex and that this duplex length corresponds to the size of the transcription bubble for that polymerase. 30 Whether 9 bp of RNA/DNA duplex relates to the size of the h-mtRNAP transcription bubble is unknown but will be of interest in future investigations.",

The fact that the kinetics of activation are first-order suggests the possibility of conformational isomerization following initial binding (Scheme 1, step 2). However, a change in the pattern of cleavage in limited trypsin digests for h-mtRNAP whether free in solution or bound to a scaffold in the presence or absence of a nucleotide substrate was not observed ( Figure S4 of the Supporting Information). In contrast, large conformational rearrangements are well-documented for T7 RNAP in the transition from initiation to elongation state, and these can be revealed by trypsin digestion (refs 30 and 37 and Figure S4 of the Supporting Information). The lack of changes in the trypsin digest pattern in h-mtRNAP does not necessarily mean that conformational differences do not exist before and after binding. This may reflect the fact that sites cleaved by trypsin are the same in uncomplexed and complexed h-mtRNAP. Sequence alignments demonstrated that the conformation-discriminating trypsin cleavage sites in T7 RNAP are not present in h-mtRNAP (data not shown). Therefore, insight into the nature of conformational rearrangements in h-mtRNAP as it binds to the nucleic acid and accomplishes nucleotide incorporation awaits further experimental inquiry.",

            "text": "The h-mtRNAP single-nucleotide incorporation reaction exhibited a solvent deuterium kinetic isotope effect (SDKIE) of approximately 3.3 (Figure 7) , indicating that chemistry is at least partially rate-limiting. The pulse-chase-quench and pulse-quench assays summarized in Figure 8 reveal that co-rate-limiting conformational changes exist both before and after chemistry. The chase of the pulse-chase-quench assay provides time for ternary complexes that are present prior to chemistry to complete product formation. 32 If there was not a kinetically significant conformational rearrangement before chemistry, product formation as a function of time observed in pulse-chase-quench and pulse-quench assays would be the same. The finding that the end point of product formation is higher in pulse-chase-quench than in pulse-quench assays is made possible by a (co)-rate-limiting conformational rearrangement immediately after chemistry that causes product formed during the chase to accumulate. 32 Similar phenomena were observed in the kinetic mechanism for the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I, 32 and Sulfolobus solfataricus P2 DNA polymerase B1. 33 Conversely, a very fast, non-rate-limiting step immediately after chemistry would prevent accumulation of product during the chase because product would be removed as quickly as it formed. This would render a postchemistry conformational step, if one existed, kinetically invisible. An area of long-standing debate in nucleic acid polymerase enzymology has surrounded which steps are rate-limiting and can therefore serve as fidelity checkpoints, during nucleotide addition. [45] [46] [47] [48] Observation of a significant SDKIE and identification of kinetically significant pre-and postchemistry conformational rearrangements for h-mtRNAP suggest that chemistry and the conformational changes that bracket it may participate in correct nucleotide incorporation surveillance (see also below with regard to nucleotide incorporation with the incorrect base or sugar).",

Stronger selection against an incorrect base than an incorrect sugar has been observed for other RNA polymerases. 34, [50] [51] [52] [53] The finding for h-mtRNAP of an only 2-fold increase in K d,app but a 500-fold decrease in k pol for incorporation of a nucleotide with an incorrect sugar (2\u2032-dAMP templated by T) suggests that little selection against incorrect sugar occurs during ground-state binding, the main determinant of K d,app , and rather that the majority of selection against an incorrect sugar occurs in steps that comprise k pol , primarily the conformational-change steps that bracket chemistry and chemistry itself. In contrast, the finding that K d,app was increased 20-fold and k pol was decreased 1000-fold for h-mtRNAP incorporation of a nucleotide with an incorrect base (GMP templated by T) suggests that both K d,app and k pol events are used to discriminate against an incorrect base. The ability of h-mtRNAP to use ground-state binding for selection against incorrect bases suggests that binding is not solely determined by the triphosphate moiety of the incoming nucleotide, in contrast to what has been found for some other polymerases, most notably viral RdRps, which have a distinct conserved motif F that is used to recognize the triphosphate moiety of the incoming nucleotide.

[32] [33] [34] [35] 39, 57 The utility of the methods described here and of the estimates of parameters for the minimal kinetic mechanism for nucleotide incorporation is that they will permit hypotheses about the biological roles of h-mtRNAP to begin to be evaluated, particularly with regard to mutant forms of h-mtRNAP. An extensive literature exists indicating a role in various disease states for the mitochondrial DNA replicating polymerase, Pol \u03b3. 8,58-60 Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) exist in the Pol \u03b3 coding sequence, 8,58-60 and some of these modulate Pol \u03b3 catalytic function [61] [62] [63] [64] and/or are linked to specific human pathologies. 8, [58] [59] [60] In addition, Pol \u03b3 has been demonstrated to be an off target for antiviral nucleoside analogues administered to patients testing positive for the human immunodeficiency virus. [65] [66] [67] The sensitivity of human health to Pol \u03b3 functional integrity argues for the need to understand the biological roles of h-mtRNAP, for which investigations of this nature are almost completely lacking.",

            "text": "The work described here is of practical importance for several reasons. Efficient methods for obtaining large quantities of h-mtRNAP purified to homogeneity have been established. This has allowed the development of quantitative in vitro assays for the biochemical behavior of h-mtRNAP. Adaptation of T7 RNAP RNA/DNA scaffolds to h-mtRNAP promoter-independent assays for nucleotide incorporation and baseline mechanistic data obtained from such assays now make feasible high-resolution, high-throughput kinetic examination of h-mtRNAP under a variety of experimental conditions. Quantitative characterization of the binding and reaction kinetics of h-mtRNAP nucleotide incorporation in a minimal in vitro assay system provides a baseline of information for understanding the contributions of the mitochondrial transcription accessory proteins to RNA synthesis. It also permits evaluation of the biochemical performance of mutant forms of h-mtRNAP that are present in the human population and that may be linked to disease states. Finally, it is now possible to test the hypothesis that h-mtRNAP is an accidental and unwanted target for synthetic nucleoside analogues that cause host morbidity when used as therapeutic agents. The methodological advances and mechanistic data described in this report will help to allow investigations into the biochemical and biological roles of h-mtRNAP function in human health and disease. Formation of catalytically competent h-mtRNAP-9 bp RNA/DNA scaffold complexes is slow. (a) Experimental design. h-mtRNAP (0.5 or 1 \u03bcM) was rapidly mixed with a 5\u2032-32 Plabeled RNA/DNA 9 bp 2AP scaffold ( Figure S6a of the Supporting Information) (0.25 \u03bcM) and ATP (500 \u03bcM) using a chemical-quench-flow process. The reaction was quenched at various times by addition of EDTA (300 mM). (b) Kinetics of formation of catalytically competent complexes. In this assay, binding of h-mtRNAP to the 9 bp 2AP scaffold was reported by single-nucleotide incorporation, a measure of functional complexes. The amount of product formed was plotted as a function of time, and the data were fit to a singleexponential equation (eq 1), yielding k obs values of 0.20 \u00b1 0.02 and 0.21 \u00b1 0.02 s \u22121 for 0.5 (\u2022) and 1 \u03bcM (\u25cb) h-mtRNAP assays, respectively. The absence of the dependence of k obs on h-mtRNAP concentration suggests that a slow first-order event occurs after initial binding, before complexes can elongate RNA. The finding that k obs values from these assays were the same as those observed for the change in fluorescence upon interaction of h-mtRNAP with the 9 bp 2AP scaffold from stopped-flow assays ( Figure S6 of the Supporting Information) suggests that the latter was also reporting on the slow isomerization leading to formation of an incorporation-competent functional complex. The observed change in fluorescence emission was measured (traces shown represent an average of approximately five shots) and fit to a single-exponential equation (eq 1), yielding k obs values of 10 \u00b1 1, 16 \u00b1 1, 22 \u00b1 1, 29 \u00b1 1, 33 \u00b1 2, and 36 \u00b1 2 s \u22121 for 30, 60, 100, 200, 300, and 600 \u03bcM ATP, respectively. (d) Estimation of k pol and K d,app from stopped-flow assays. k obs values were plotted as a function of ATP concentration and fit to a hyperbola (eq 2), yielding a k pol of 40 \u00b1 1 s \u22121 and a K d,app of 90 \u00b1 5 \u03bcM. The kinetic parameters for single-nucleotide incorporation by chemical-quench-flow and stopped-flow methods are in agreement. Larger pool of ternary complexes captured in pulse-chase-quench assays than in pulsequench assays. (a) Experimental design. For pulse-quench assays, h-mtRNAP (1.5 \u03bcM) was incubated with 9 bp 2AP scaffold ( Figure S6a of the Supporting Information) (1 \u03bcM) for 60 s and then rapidly mixed with [\u03b1-32 P]ATP (100 \u03bcM) using a chemical-quench-flow assay.",

(a) Chemical-quenchflow data. h-mtRNAP (0.125 \u03bcM) was incubated with 5\u2032-32 P-labeled RNA/DNA 9 bp 2AP scaffold (Figure S6a of the Supporting Information) (0.1 \u03bcM) for 3 min and then rapidly mixed with ATP (25, 50, 100, 250, or 500 \u03bcM) using a chemical-quench-flow method. Reactions were quenched at various times with EDTA (300 mM). The amount of RNA product was plotted as a function of time and fit to a single-exponential equation (eq 1), yielding k obs values of 10 \u00b1 1, 17 \u00b1 3, 23 \u00b1 2, 28 \u00b1 4, and 35 \u00b1 6 s \u22121 for 25 (\u2022), 50 (\u25cb), 100 (\u25a0), 250 (\u25a1), and 500 \u03bcM ATP (\u25b2), respectively. (b) Estimation of k pol and K d,app from chemical-quench-flow assays. k obs values were plotted as a function of ATP concentration and fit to a hyperbola (eq 2), yielding a k pol of 40 \u00b1 2 s \u22121 and a K d,app of 70 \u00b1 10 \u03bcM. (c) Stopped-flow fluorescence. Use of the 9 bp scaffold containing 2AP (Figure S6a of the Supporting Information) permitted evaluation of the kinetics of single-nucleotide incorporation by a second method, measurement of fluorescence changes in a stopped flow. h-mtRNAP (0.125 \u03bcM) was incubated with 9 bp 2AP scaffold (0.1 \u03bcM) for 3 min and then rapidly mixed with ATP (30, 60, 100, 200, 300, or 600 \u03bcM) using a stopped-flow method.",

(a and b) Chemical-quench-flow assays in H 2 O or D 2 O. h-mtRNAP (0.125 \u03bcM) was incubated with 5\u2032-32 P-labeled RNA/DNA 9 bp 2AP scaffold (Figure S6a of the Supporting Information) (0.1 \u03bcM) for 3 min and then rapidly mixed with a near-saturating concentration of ATP (500 \u03bcM) using a chemical-quench-flow method. Reactions were quenched at various times with EDTA (300 mM). The amount of RNA product was plotted as a function of time and fit to a single-exponential equation (eq 1), yielding k obs values of 42 \u00b1 2 s \u22121 in H 2 O (a) and 13 \u00b1 1 s \u22121 in D 2 O (b). The SDKIE was approximately 3.3. (c) Stopped-flow assays in D 2 O. h-mtRNAP (0.125 \u03bcM) was incubated with 9 bp 2AP scaffold (0.1 \u03bcM) for 3 min and then rapidly mixed with ATP (25, 50, 100, 200, and 500 \u03bcM) using a stopped-flow method. The observed change in fluorescence emission was measured (each an average of approximately five shots) and fit to a single-exponential equation (and 500 \u03bcM ATP, respectively. (d) Estimation of k pol and K d,app in D 2 O from stoppedflow assays. k obs values were plotted as a function of ATP concentration and fit to a hyperbola (eq 2), yielding a k pol of 12 \u00b1 1 s \u22121 and a K d,app of 100 \u00b1 10 \u03bcM. Comparison with the k pol value in H 2 O (Figure 6d) indicates a SDKIE of approximately 3.3. A SDKIE on K d,app was not observed. Estimates of the SDKIE on the rate constant for singlenucleotide incorporation from chemical-quench-flow and stopped-flow assays are in agreement.",
