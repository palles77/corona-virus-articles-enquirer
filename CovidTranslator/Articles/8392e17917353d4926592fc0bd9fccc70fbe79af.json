The visitors were an entirely heterogeneous group consisting of visitors to both admitted and non-admitted patients, family members and non-family members, and individuals with and without experience of being a patient themselves. We did not measure these variables within this group. Those \"patients waiting to be seen\" were registered and waiting to see a physician. Their disposition had not been decided at the time of interview. Admitted patients had a decision decided upon, but did not necessarily have admission orders written when surveyed. The purpose of sampling these three groups was to determine the opinion of members of the general public with an immediate interest in the subject (visitors), non-boarding patients, and those patients who were actually being boarded in the ED.",

We employed the Sidak correction for multiple comparisons. A multivariate model using backward stepwise logistic regression was constructed to determine if subjects' preferences were influenced by specific ED circumstances, the number of other patients waiting, level of nursing staffing, ambulance traffic, and whether or not the ED was on ambulance diversion either during the 4-h period when the subject participated or in the preceding 4-h period.",

There were 477 visitors, 532 patients waiting to be seen who did not have a disposition, and 213 patients being boarded. The age and gender compositions of the patient population are shown in Figure 1 . A racial, gender, and age description of the entire sample, including visitors, is shown in Figure 2 . Those patients actually being boarded split fairly evenly as to preferred location for boarding. Patients waiting to be seen and visitors showed progressively decreasing tolerance for ED boarding. A similar trend was noted for subjects' opinions of a reasonable wait time to be moved to an inpatient bed from the ED (Table 1) . Combining all three groups, 801 (65.5%; 95% CI 62.8%-68.2%) stated a preference for being boarded in the hallway of an inpatient ward rather than in the ED, 406 (33.2%; 95% CI 30.6%-35.9%) would choose the ED, and 15 (1%; 95% CI 0.7%-2.0%) had no preference. There were no significant differences when evaluated by gender, season, or between daytime and nighttime participants. The commonly cited reasons among boarded patients for preferring inpatient ward boarding were privacy concerns and reduced noise levels (n \u03ed 32, n \u03ed 36). The most common reasons for preferring ED boarding are easy access to a doctor and the excitement of watching the care of other patients (n \u03ed 30, n \u03ed 5). An appropriate denominator for these reasons is difficult to select as most patient comments reflected frustration at waiting times rather than specific reasons for their preference for ED or ward boarding.",

Although the advantage of a simple survey tool such as ours is that it provides a simple answer, it cannot answer in depth questions as to why patients hold the preferences that they do. Is it possible that actually being an ED boarder is less horrid than imagining being one? That visitors were less tolerant of it than patients suggests this may be the case. ED staff do attempt to make boarders' stays as bearable as possible, often leaving them in an examination cubicle with family members without regard to visiting hours imposed elsewhere in the hospital. Additionally, experienced patients may well value being able to gain access to a physician easily, as is the case in the ED. Although disruptive to patient flow, and creating the potential for disharmony between Emergency Physicians and the admitting services responsible for the boarded patients, ease of physician access was valued by many of our patients who stated a preference for ED boarding. As we did not anticipate these results, we had not designed our survey tool to probe these questions.",

Alternately, it is conceivable that the participants would sense that a socially more acceptable answer would be to choose ward boarding. These potential biases could not be measured.

The survey was then administered verbally by the research assistant.Sometimes we do not have any beds available for patients in the hospital. As a result, patients who are admitted to the hospital have to spend a long time in the Emergency Room, often in busy hallways. We would like your opinions on this. All of your answers are confidential and will not affect your care in any way. If you don't want to answer any or some questions, that's okay.We value YOUR opinions and thank you for taking the time to help us improve our service planning. ________________________________________________________________________________________________",
