The SARS epidemic started in November 2002 in the Guangdong province in China and within a few months had affected more than 8000 patients and caused 774 deaths in 26 countries on five continents [2] . Sporadic cases of SARS have been reported recently and highlight the risk for repeated epidemics. A striking feature of SARS during the epidemic was its high rate of nosocomial transmission [2, 3] and the high proportion of young, healthy patients who progressed to become critically ill. During the outbreak, approximately 20% to 30% of patients required intensive care unit (ICU) admission [4\u2022,5\u2022,6-9] . Approximately 20% of these admissions were heath care workers [4\u2022,5\u2022] . Therefore, the provision of ICU care plays a potentially important role in the support of patients with severe SARS.",

ICU admission usually is late and occurs 8 to 10 days after symptom onset. Acute respiratory distress syndrome occurs in almost all admitted patients and most require mechanical ventilation. ICU admission is associated with significant morbidity, particularly an apparent increase in the incidence of barotrauma and nosocomial sepsis. Long-term mortality for patients admitted to the ICU ranges from 30% to 50%. Many procedures in ICUs pose a high risk for transmission of SARS coronavirus to health care workers. Contact and airborne infection isolation precautions, in addition to standard precautions, should be applied when caring for patients with SARS.

The use of steroids for the treatment of other types of ARDS also is controversial. Trials of short-term, high-dose steroid therapy in early ARDS have failed to show a benefit, with some trials showing an increased risk for infection and increased mortality [23] . One study showed that the use of lower doses of steroids in the late phase of ARDS (7-14 days from diagnosis) might favorably modify the fibroproliferative phase of the disease and result in improved oxygenation and successful extubation [24] , but the design and interpretation of the trial have proved contentious [25] .

Therefore, all ICU studies reported attempts to limit tidal volume to 6 to 8 mL/kg estimated lean body weight, limit the plateau or peak airway pressure to less than 30 to 35 cm H 2 O pressure, titrate PEEP to minimize the inspired oxygen concentration, and target moderate arterial oxygen saturation (88% to 95%), while allowing the PaCO 2 to increase if necessary, provided the pH was greater than 7.15.",

Although a recent large, randomized, controlled trial of prone ventilation showed no improvement in mortality or organ dysfunction overall, it might be beneficial in the more severely ill patients [32] . Although prone ventilation was used to a varying degree in mechanically ventilated SARS patients, not enough data are provided to draw any conclusions regarding its efficacy in this setting [4\u2022,5\u2022,11\u2022] . In Hong Kong, the experience with prone ventilation was one of extreme interpatient variability in response (determined by improved oxygenation in the prone position). It is interesting to speculate on the idea that SARS may be a form of ARDS of pulmonary origin (ARDSp), which may have a different pathophysiology than ARDS of extrapulmonary origin (ARDSexp) [33] . In general, ARDSp is associated with more pulmonary consolidation, and ARDSexp with more interstitial edema and compression atelectasis. The latter appears to have a higher potential for alveolar recruitment and clinical response with prone positioning than does the former [34, 35] . Whether SARS-induced ARDS falls into the ARDSp category is unknown; however, prone positioning is a relatively safe procedure that rarely worsens a patient's respiratory status. The use of nitric oxide in ARDS had not been shown to improve outcome [36] , and anecdotally, the experience in Toronto and Singapore also demonstrates little benefit from nitric oxide in patients with SARS [4\u2022,5\u2022] .",
