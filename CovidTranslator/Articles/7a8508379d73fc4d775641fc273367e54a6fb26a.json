An unusual feature of the lesions in the CNS was the presence of pyknotic cells within myelin sheaths. A sequence of observations indicated that such cells were lymphocytes which had insinuated themselves into the myelin sheath by passage along the interperiod line. The presence of lymphocytes within myelin sheaths, a process which did not lead to demyelination, was considered to represent a change which reflects the specificity of the immune response in this disease. The detection of this change in other CNS autoimmune diseases, notably those associated with virus infections, may be important as an indicator of pathogenetically relevant lymphocyte-myelin interactions.",

Although there may be demyelination in the spinal roots (Pender, 1987) , there is little if any demyelination of central axons (Kerlero de Rosbo et al., 1985; Vandenbark et al., 1985; Pender, 1987) . Clinical signs appear to correlate best with the extent of edematous changes in the spinal cord suggesting that effector T cell-central nervous system (CNS) vasculature interactions may be particularly important; however, in some species peripheral nervous system (PNS) demyelination may also contribute to the clinical disease (Pender, 1988) .

            "text": "It appears that this process per se does not lead to demyelination as evidence of primary myelin loss in the spinal cord was minimal. Perhaps paradoxically, these interactions were not observed in the PNS and yet mild segmental demyelination was clearly evident there. Thus, at least in the PNS this process is not obligatory for demyelination to occur and as demonstrated by others, central demyelination may be dependent on the presence of specific humoral factors (Schluesner et al., 1987; Lassmann et al., 1988) . Although intramyelinic pyknotic cells have been observed in EAE (Bubis and Luse, 1964; Lassmann et al., 1988) , their genesis has not been examined in detail. We have recently observed this change in association with the delayed demyelinating lesions of Theiler's virus infection in mice (Blakemore et al., 1988) and it is illustrated in a paper on Semliki Forest virus infection in mice by 23 Gates and coworkers (1984) and in a study on Venezuelan equine encephalomyelitis in mice (Dal Canto and Rabinowitz, 1981) . As insinuation of lymphocytes into myelin sheaths is a process which is unlikely to occur by chance it must represent a specific cell-cell interaction which can be related to the sensitizing antigen (MBP) used in the present study. In neurotropic virus infections this interaction may occur as a response to viral antigen expressed in the myelin sheath, or may indicate the presence of autoreactive lymphocytes which have been, in some way, amplified by the viral infection. It is therefore pertinent to examine all virally induced demyelinating diseases in which autoimmunity has been implicated (e.g. Watanabe et al., 1983) to see if these intramyelinic pyknotic cells are present.",

However, previous studies at the light microscope level by one of us (Sedgwick et al., 1987) found no evidence of infiltrating lymphocytes in the CNS of animals injected with activated ovalbumin-specific splenocytes. We would conclude from this that the observations made here reflect a specific cell-cell interaction related to MBP. What is not clear is how MBP and major histocompatibility (MHC)restricted T cells may be involved in such an interaction given the reported absence of MHC antigens on the bulk of cells in the CNS and the cytoplasmic location of MBP. With regard to the latter, it is now clear that T cells recognize peptide fragments of antigen and that these may be derived from cytoplasmic proteins (Townsend et al., 1986) . The sequestered location of intact MBP is therefore not in itself a problem with regard to T cell recognition.",
