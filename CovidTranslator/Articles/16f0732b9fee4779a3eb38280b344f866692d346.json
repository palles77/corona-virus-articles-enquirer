According to the Interim Guidelines issued by the World Health Organization (WHO) on January 12, 2020, 3 patient throat swabs and sputum samples were collected and subjected to a nucleic acid (RNA) test for COVID-19. We included all 55 consecutive patients with COVID-19 who were treated between January 20 and March 15, 2020; none were excluded. Patients were considered the 'mild' group (mild/moderate), whereas those were considered the 'severe' group (severe/critical); these classifications were according to the criteria stated in the COVID-19 Diagnosis and Treatment Plan issued by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China. 2 The study was reviewed and approved by the Ethics Committee of Shenyang Chest Hospital (approval number: KYXM-2020-001-01) and was also documented by the Ethics Committee of the Shenyang Sixth People's Hospital.

Among the patients treated with antibiotics, 21 were in the mild group (44\u00b768% of this group); their median treatment time was 13\u00b75 days (IQR 5\u00b775-9\u00b725 days), with 15 (71\u00b742%) treated with moxifloxacin and two (9\u00b752%) receiving carrimycin. The remaining antibiotic recipients comprised all eight patients in the severe group (100%), with a median treatment time of 9 days (IQR 9\u00b775-15\u00b725); four patients (50%) were treated with moxifloxacin and two (25%) with linezolid. Seven patients (12\u00b772%) were treated with glucocorticoids, 20 (36\u00b736%) received recombinant human interferon alpha-1b, and nine (16\u00b736%) were treated with thymalfasin (Figures 1-3 ).",

A retrospective study of patients with Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) in 2019 showed that interferon did not accelerate virus clearance, 10 while a study of patients with SARS showed that alpha-interferon did not improve the patients' prognosis. 11 In the present study, a small number of patients were treated with ribavirin, and alpha-interferon was simply used to assist aerosol inhalation.

Ji et al.5 also confirmed the efficacy of umifenovir for the treatment of coronavirus infection in an in vitro study. Our present findings indicated that umifenovir might benefit patients with mild symptoms. In the severe group, eight patients (100%) were administered antiviral drugs for a median time of 17\u00b750 days (IQR 11-19\u00b725 days); 4 (50%) were treated with lopinavir/ritonavir and 3 (37\u00b750%) received a combination lopinavir/ritonavir regimen. Chu et al.6 found that lopinavir/ritonavir could inhibit coronavirus replication to some extent, thereby reducing the risk of ARDS or death in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).Chan et al. 7    confirmed the efficacy of the combination of lopinavir/ritonavir and interferon-\u03b2 for the treatment of MERS-CoV infection in animal models. In the present study, the use of lopinavir/ritonavir in the severe group was apparently effective in mitigating fever symptoms, promoting lung shadow absorption, and rapidly restoring the number of lymphocytes. The efficacy and safety of lopinavir/ritonavir are expected to be verified in future clinical randomized controlled trials.",

Experience with SARS 13 and MERS 14 also suggests that prophylactic antibiotics may be appropriate after assessing the risk of co-infection in patients with severe symptoms. Bacterial infection rates after COVID-19 infection remain unclear. In the present study, 12 (57\u00b714%) of patients in the mild group were administered prophylactic drugs and 9 (42\u00b786%) underwent empirical treatment (mainly with single-antibiotic moxifloxacin); the possibility of atypical pathogenic bacteria such as Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection was also considered. In the severe group, 5 (62\u00b750%) of patients were administered prophylactic medication and 3 (37\u00b750%) received empirical treatment. Prophylactic medication was administered to patients complicated with diabetes, chronic lung diseases, and ARDS who were at the early stage of receiving glucocorticoids. Broad-spectrum antimicrobials were recommended for patients at a higher risk of multidrug-resistant bacterial infections in the severe group, with drug doses adjustable according to the results of pathogen cultures. No evidence of secondary bacterial infection was observed in patients who received prophylactic medication. The present study suggested that the early and prudent use of prophylactic antibiotics in patients with COVID-19 may help reduce the risk of co-bacterial infections.",
