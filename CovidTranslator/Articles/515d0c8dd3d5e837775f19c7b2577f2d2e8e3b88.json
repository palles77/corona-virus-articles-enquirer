Though diagnostic tests are fundamental to the ability to detect and respond, many health systems are already experiencing shortages of reagents associated with this test. Here, testing a pooling approach for the standard RT-qPCR test, we find that a single positive sample can be detected even in pools of up to 32 samples, with an estimated false negative rate of 10%. Detection of positive samples diluted in even up to 64 samples may also be attainable, though may require additional amplification cycles. As it uses the standard protocols, reagents and equipment, this pooling method can be applied immediately in current clinical testing laboratories. We hope that such implementation of a pool test for COVID-19 would allow expanding current screening capacities thereby enabling the expansion of detection in the community, as well as in close integral groups, such as hospital departments, army units, or factory shifts.",

Nevertheless, as monitoring capacity is limited, testing in most countries is generally focused on acutely ill patients, while potentially infectious carriers at the community remain undiagnosed. As many countries are already experiencing shortages of diagnosis kits and factories struggling to keep with the demand [5] [6] [7] , it has become important to come up with new ways to conserve the reagents used for diagnostic tests. At the same time, as the disease is novel, it is of value to validate any modifications to the testing process before universal adoption [8, 9] .",

In this method, first suggested by Dorfman in 1943 [10] and perfected over the years [11] [12] [13] , samples are mixed and tested at a single pool, and subsequent individual tests are made only if the pool tests positive. In addition to being used in the clinic for infectious disease diagnostics in previous epidemics [14, 15] , pooling has been proven to work for RT-qPCR [16, 17] , a time-consuming step for which the reagents are expected to be in short supply [18] .

For instance, additional amplification cycles could lower detection limit allowing better detection for pools of more than 32 samples, which based on extrapolation of the data we expect would allow the 64-sample pools of positive sample #5 to cross the threshold. In addition, some abnormalities as with duplicate B in positive samples #5 and #2 could have been due to interference from contamination in one or more of the samples. The unusual peaks for positive sample #2 could be due to a changing salt concentration that disturbed the TaqMan probe. Since both these issues could be solved by further diluting the RNA samples with water, it is worthwhile to explore whether diluting samples with different ratios of water could improve the integrity of the signal in pooled results. While we tested samples with a range of different signal strengths, the detection of samples with even lower signals may warrant the use of smaller pools. Adding a few additional PCR cycles could be considered as a means to increase detection rate of such low viral load samples. In general, as RT-qPCR kits and protocols vary internationally, use of suggested pooling may require validation for each specific setting.",

While the frequency of infection in these groups may be low, diagnosing even a single positive person typically requires quarantine of the entire group to prevent further spread in the community. In these surveillance applications, pooling may allow more routine monitoring and detection of low frequency of carriage thereby informing policy makers, reducing transmission, and alleviating the strain on healthcare services.",
