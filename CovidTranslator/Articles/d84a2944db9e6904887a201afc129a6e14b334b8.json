Neutralizing antibodies can therefore potentially prevent virus entry into target cells and cell-to-cell spread of infection. Our present study focused on the selection of neutralizing single-chain Fv (scFv) antibodies of a phage-displayed nonimmune human scFv antibody library against gB of HSV-1. To enrich specific scFvs, two phage antibodies were isolated against amino acid residues 31-43 derived from the N-terminal part of gB using panning technique. Two scFvs, scFv-gB 1 and scFv-gB 2 , with frequencies of 45% and 20% were obtained from scFv clones after performing PCR and MvaI fingerprinting. In phage ELISA analysis, both gB 1 and gB 2 scFvs demonstrated high reactivity with the gB peptide. In the neutralization assay, scFv-gB 1 and scFv-gB 2 represented neutralizing effects of 55% and 59%, respectively. Upon further enhancement of the neutralizing effects of these antibodies, they can be considered as new potential alternatives in the treatment and prophylaxis of HSV-1 infections.",

            "text": "Herpes simplex virus (HSV) type I remains a significant pathogen and many people (60 to 80% of the adult population) around the world have been reported to be infected with this virus [1] . HSV-1 tends to the nerves and establishes a long-term latent infection in the nervous system [2] . In certain people, recurrent infections occur in the trigeminal ganglia following periodic reactivation of latent virus [3, 4] . The virus causes a variety of diseases with a spectrum of severities, including cold sores (fever blisters), conjunctival and corneal lesions, pneumonia and meningoencephalitis in the immunocompromised individuals [1, 5, 6] . Antiviral drugs are able to reduce viral infection and are considered as efficacious treatments for HSV-1. However, virus resistance to these agents is increasing [7] . Several glycoproteins play a critical role in virus entry into mammalian cells and cell-to-cell spread, including gB, gD and gH/gL. The first stage to establish an infection is low-affinity and reversible attachment of the virus to the cell surface that is mediated by gB binding to surface heparin sulphate proteoglycan (HSPGs) [8] . In the next stage, gD interacts with one of the multiple potential entry receptors, nectin 1, 3-O-sulfated heparan sulphate or herpesvirus entry mediator (HVEM). Following gD attachment to one of its receptors, it undergoes conformational changes and a pH-independent fusion of an active multi-glycoprotein complex involving gB, gD, gH and gL will occur [9, 10] .",

These regions include (i) initial 12 residues of the N-terminal part, (ii) residues 454 to 475, 391 to 410, and a less-defined zone within domain II, (iii) residues 697 to 725 of domain V and residues within domain I, and (iv) residues of domain IV nearby to domain III [12] . gB elicits a remarkable amount of neutralizing antibodies.

The smallest antibody fragments are scFv molecules (26-27 kDa) [15] . scFv antibodies have several advantages in terms of pharmacokinetic characteristics including lower retention in non-target tissues, higher penetration into target tissues, and lack of inducing human anti-mouse antibody responses [16, 17] .

Monoclonal antibody H1817 that belonged to 6A subgroup bound functional region 4 (FR4) in domain VI of gB. FR4 containing the first 12 residues of the N terminus formed the epitope of MAb H1817. MAb H1817 had high neutralizing effect and reduced the plaque number on Vero cells by N 50% [24] . The antibody recognized a single peptide spanning residues 31 to 50 as previously reported.

            "text": "Plaque reduction assay was used to test the neutralizing activity of scFv antibodies. Hitherto, neutralizing scFv antibodies have been produced against many viral proteins, but surface glycoproteins have been the most appealing target owing to their important role in virus attachment to receptors of host cells; examples of such antibodies include scFvs against HA (Haemagglutinin) of influenza A virus H5N1 subtype [20] , gB and gH cytomegalovirus [19] , respiratory syncytial virus [36] , rabies virus [37] , and Enteric coronavirus [38] . In a previous study, one recombinant Fab-phage antibody (Fab54-7) was selected against the gB of HSV-1 and HSV-2 using panning. This Fab isolate was not capable of neutralizing either strain when used alone [39] . Nejatollahi et al. isolated one scFv-phage antibody (scFv-gD 2 ) against glycoprotein D with a neutralizing effect of 76% [21] . In this study, two scFv-phage antibodies (scFv-gB 1 and scFv-gB 2 ) could neutralize virus with neutralizing effects of 55% and 59%, respectively, and significantly decreased cytopathic effects in Vero cells. Moreover, both scFvs could inhibit the virus in vitro when used alone (Table 1) , and did not require dimerization to exert neutralizing effects.",

These results encourage further attempts (mainly through genetic engineering) to promote the development of scFv antibodies with preserved binding capacity but enhanced neutralizing effects. Also, future studies are warranted to test the neutralizing effect of the identified scFv antibodies in a purified and phage-free form to obtain a better assessment on their neutralizing effect and also test the dose-response association for the neutralizing effects of ScFvs. Optimized scFv antibodies with enhanced neutralizing effects could also be relevant for testing in clinical trials.",
