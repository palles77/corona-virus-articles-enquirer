            "text": "Heterogeneity in host contact patterns profoundly shapes population-level disease dynamics. Many epidemiological models make simplifying assumptions about the patterns of diseasecausing interactions among hosts. In particular, homogeneous-mixing models assume that all hosts have identical rates of disease-causing contacts. In recent years, several network-based approaches have been developed to explicitly model heterogeneity in host contact patterns. Here, we use a network perspective to quantify the extent to which real populations depart from the homogeneous-mixing assumption, in terms of both the underlying network structure and the resulting epidemiological dynamics. We find that human contact patterns are indeed more heterogeneous than assumed by homogeneous-mixing models, but are not as variable as some have speculated. We then evaluate a variety of methodologies for incorporating contact heterogeneity, including network-based models and several modifications to the simple SIR compartmental model. We conclude that the homogeneous-mixing compartmental model is appropriate when host populations are nearly homogeneous, and can be modified effectively for a few classes of non-homogeneous networks. In general, however, network models are more intuitive and accurate for predicting disease spread through heterogeneous host populations.",

Heterogeneities in pathogens, host populations and the interactions between them profoundly affect the dynamics of infection. For example, in 1984, in a study of the spread of gonorrhoea in the United States, Hethcote and Yorke showed that 60% of all infections were caused by a small group of individuals making up only 2% of the entire population (Hethcote & Yorke 1984) . In 1999, a cluster of five cases of measles in a small elementary school in The Netherlands led to an outbreak of approximately 3000 cases, despite the fact that 96% of the population of The Netherlands was vaccinated against measles at the time (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2000) . In the spring of 2003, two individuals travelling from Vancouver and Toronto, respectively, were infected almost simultaneously with SARS by a source in Hong Kong. There were no secondary cases reported from the individual from Vancouver; in contrast, the infected individual from Toronto went on to infect five other people, which led to an outbreak of 200 cases in Toronto (Poutanen et al. 2003) .",

In this article, we will focus on disease-independent heterogeneity in host contact rates. That is, the number of potentially diseasecausing interactions can vary widely across a host population. Although this is only one aspect of host heterogeneity, it is an important one. Variability in contact patterns can stem from social structure, age, sex, spatial structure and behavioural differences. This heterogeneity is ubiquitous at many scales and can cause variability in disease parameters such as infectivity and susceptibility (Hethcote & Yorke 1984; Addy et al. 1991) . Such individual-level diversity can profoundly shape population-level disease dynamics.",

This simplifying assumption makes the analysis tractable but may not adequately reflect reality. Despite this assumption, these homogeneousmixing compartmental models have proved to be robust and predictive (Anderson & May 1992; Mollison et al. 1993) . Although we will focus on the simplest compartmental model, we note that this approach has been successfully extended to capture large-scale host heterogeneities. These extensions of the simple compartmental framework have included age-specific contact patterns and heterogeneities induced by spatial structure (Ball et al. 1997; Bj\u00f8rnstad et al. 2002; Grenfell et al. 2002) , but they do not allow for individual-level resolution.",

We start with a brief introduction to the contact network framework and then translate the homogeneous-mixing assumption into network terminology. Using several real and simulated datasets of human contact networks, we show that the homogeneous-mixing assumption may give rough but reasonable approximations for many populations. We then characterize the 'epidemiological distance' between these empirical networks and the homogeneous-mixing assumption of the simple model. Finally, we review and evaluate a variety of methodologies for incorporating contact heterogeneity, including several modifications to the simplest compartmental framework. We emphasize that many of the new network-based approaches are as mathematically tractable as the simplest compartmental models; although the compartmental framework can be extended to consider many complexities, the elegance with which the network-based approaches incorporate heterogeneity makes them an attractive option for future epidemiological studies.",

The interpersonal contact patterns that underlie disease transmission can naturally be thought to form a network, where links join individuals who interact with each other. During an outbreak, disease then spreads along these links. All epidemiological models make assumptions about the underlying network of interactions, often without explicitly stating them. Contact network models, however, mathematically formalize this intuitive concept so that epidemiological calculations can explicitly consider complex patterns of interactions. Formally, a contact (or social) network model explicitly represents host interactions that mediate disease spread. A node in a contact network represents an individual host, and an edge between two nodes represents an interaction that may allow disease transmission. A node's degree is the number of edges attached to it (i.e. its number of contacts) and the degree distribution of a network is the frequency distribution of degrees throughout the entire population.",

With large or infinite variance in degree, scale-free networks can have exceedingly low or non-existent epidemic thresholds; this means that even the sparsest networks are highly vulnerable to epidemics. Despite recent popularity, however, it is not clear that realistic epidemiological networks are generally scale-free, and thus whether they deserve so much attention in epidemiology.

Consider a regular random network with homogeneous degree k. Suppose that disease spreads from infected nodes to susceptible contacts with a rate of t 0 . Because contacts are random, we can assume that the fraction of contacts that are infected is equal to the fraction of infected individuals in the network as a whole, or i t Z I \u00f0t\u00de=N . Then, the force of infection on any given susceptible individual will be l 0 Z ki t t 0 , which is equal to that given by the homogeneous-mixing compartmental model with aZk and tZt 0 . This mapping is only approximate because the two models view effective contact differently. In compartmental models, the identity of a contact is determined randomly and instantaneously for each transmission event; in static network models, on the other hand, the identities of contacts are chosen randomly but remain fixed for the length of an individual's infectious period. The models thus yield different values for the basic reproductive ratio and expected equilibrium values (Keeling & Grenfell 2000) .",

In fact, a complete network is just a regular random network in which each individual contacts all NK1 other individuals, and thus is one of many valid (regular) network interpretations of the equations above. The force of infection in a complete network is l 0 z\u00f0N K1\u00dei t t 0 . For most populations, however, it is unrealistic to imagine that individuals are in constant contact with all other individuals. Thus, it is more realistic to interpret the edges in the complete network as 'possible' contacts and the transmission term t 0 as a combined effective contact and transmission rate. Figure 2a ,b demonstrates that, indeed, the dynamics predicted by the homogeneous-mixing compartmental model are a close approximation to stochastic simulations of disease transmission through a regular random network. The predicted final size of an outbreak (figure 2a) is shown as a function of T, the per contact probability of transmission integrated over the entire infectious period of an infected individual. We generated these and all other random networks described in \u00a75 using the configuration model (Molloy & Reed 1995) . The stochastic epidemiological simulations are based on a discrete-time, chain binomial, SIR model (Bailey 1957) . (See appendix A in the electronic supplementary material for further details.)",

Starting with a regular random network, we use a greedy rewiring procedure to gradually generate an exponentially distributed network. In particular, we iteratively select a random edge in the network, and change its destination to a new node (chosen in proportion to its degree). This process reduces the degree of the original destination node and increases the degree of the new destination node (which already had high degree), and thus progressively increases the variance in the degree distribution. (Details on the rewiring algorithm can be found in appendix C in the electronic supplementary material.) We monitor the structural evolution of the network during the rewiring process in terms of the coefficient of variation (CV ) in degree-the standard deviation in degree divided by the mean degree.

Figure 4b illustrates the epidemiological consequences of rewiring for a particular probability of transmission (TZ0.25). The y-intercept values in figure 4b (structural distanceZ0) indicate the amount of error realized if one uses a homogeneous-mixing model to make predictions on an exponential network. For example, in a population with a mean degree of 8, the homogeneous-mixing model has a 17% error in the prediction for final size of epidemic; while for a network with a mean degree of 16 (such as the urban contact network for Portland, Oregon discussed in \u00a74.1), the error is approximately 8%. In general, for a given probability of transmission, the discrepancy between the homogeneous-mixing model and the true epidemiology decreases as the mean degree increases.

Second, late in an outbreak, the reverse occurs, and disease-causing contacts are fewer than expected because the newly infected and remaining susceptible populations tend to have low numbers of contacts. Figure 5 illustrates this changing distribution of contacts in the susceptible and infectious populations over the course of an outbreak. As the disease spreads, not only does the average number of contacts per infected individual change, but also the variability in the number of contacts decreases.

            "text": "Incorporating these heterogeneities into analytical models of disease spread has proved to be a critical challenge. Differential equations-based models enjoy the advantages of being tractable, yielding to sensitivity analysis and providing temporal behaviour, but they often lack attention to detail in the underlying process. Individual-based models allow individual-level heterogeneities to be taken into account and can prove to be very useful in making public health decisions, but can often be intractable. Despite the challenges, many powerful analytical approaches have been developed in recent years to make predictions of disease spread in heterogeneous populations. We review some of these approaches here. Percolation theory methods are based on generating functions, and only require the degree distribution of the network and the average transmissibility T of the pathogen, i.e. the probability that an infected individual will transmit disease to a susceptible contact during his or her infectious period. These methods are very general and mathematically tractable. They provide excellent final-state predictions, but do not predict the dynamics of an outbreak (Moore & Newman 2000; Newman 2002; Meyers et al. 2003 Meyers et al. , 2005 Meyers et al. , 2006 . Pair approximation methods (Keeling 1999 ) are based on a differential equation model of counting the number of pairs of individuals in each disease class. These methods are particularly useful for networks with clustering or spatial networks. There are many useful extensions of pair approximation methods for networks with various structures (e.g. Eames & Keeling 2002 ), but we consider only the simplest of these models in the analysis below. Moreno et al. (2002) and have developed a dynamical framework based on a system of degree-based differential equations. These models track numbers of individuals in each disease state for each degree class (there are 3k differential equations in the system for an SIR model, where k is the number of unique degree classes). Finally, Volz (in press) has developed a powerful probability generating function (PGF)-based differential equation model that accurately tracks global epidemiological dynamics in complex random networks (we give details of each of these approaches in appendix D in the electronic supplementary material).",

Figure 6 compares this approach with the homogeneous-mixing compartmental model. Aparicio and Pascual do not actually discuss adaptations of their model to exponential or scalefree networks.

Keeling (2005) suggests modifying the transmission term to be a function of time, b(t), and fitting this time-dependent term to case-reporting data. Keeling has shown that this approach works well, given sufficient epidemiological data. Using a model similar to those introduced by Severo (1969) , Liu et al. (1987) and Hochberg (1991) , Roy & Pascual (2006) suggest modifying the infection term of the homogeneous-mixing compartmental model to be tk S p I q , where the 'heterogeneity parameters' k, p and q are estimated via leastsquares fitting to simulation data. They demonstrate the success of this approach on small-world networks. Similarly, Stroud et al. (2006) modify the term representing the proportion of susceptibles in the homogeneousmixing model with an empirical exponent \u00f0S=N \u00de v , where v is estimated from simulation data. They successfully demonstrate this approach on several urban contact networks . We choose to evaluate the Stroud model as a representative of this class of modifications (figure 6). Figure 6 shows that neither of the tested modifications succeeds in capturing the disease dynamics across all network classes and probabilities of transmission. These efforts to account for contact heterogeneity seem somewhat ad hoc, and not justified from 'first principles'. A flexible modification to the simple framework must be able to capture the evolving distributions of contacts illustrated in figure 5. During the course of an epidemic, the epidemiologically active portion of the network (individuals who are either susceptible or infectious) shrinks and changes in contact structure. The nature of this change fundamentally depends on the initial network structure. The homogeneous-mixing compartmental model takes into account the changing densities of the epidemiologically active individuals in the population (changing values of S and i t ), but not the changing distribution of contacts among epidemiologically active individuals (constant a).",

This value decreases as the epidemic progresses and high-degree nodes recover from disease and thereby are removed from the epidemiologically active portion of the network.

The total number of edges leading to infected individuals at time t is I \u00f0t\u00dehki I \u00f0t\u00de , where hki I \u00f0t\u00de is the average degree among currently infected nodes, and the number of all contacts in the network is Nhki, where hki is the average degree in the original network.

The exact form of l 0 t , however, depends on the contact structure of the population and can be found with one of two methods. One could use analytical methods borrowed from network modelling to estimate (or calculate exactly) the function l 0 t . This would mean, however, that an entire set of network equations would have to be embedded within the compartmental framework, defeating the purpose of a simple modification. Another option would be to simulate exactly a full epidemic on the contact network, and estimate l 0 t by fitting linear or quadratic functions to the values of hki S\u00f0t\u00de and hki I \u00f0t\u00de as a function of outbreak size from the simulation data. Figure 6 shows that this option indeed performs better than existing modifications, but is cumbersome in comparison with the latest generation of network models. Thus, we do not advocate its general use, but present it simply to provide insight into the mechanisms of infection during an epidemic.",

Epidemiologists have recently focused on scale-free contact networks made up of a chaste majority and a small, highly promiscuous minority. Human contact patterns indeed exhibit more heterogeneity than assumed by homogeneous-mixing models, but they do not appear generally to be scale-free. The diverse populations we considered above have exponentially distributed contact patterns (figure 3). The epidemiological behaviour of exponential networks is typically much closer to the predictions of the homogeneous-mixing models than that of scale-free networks, although this depends on the transmission rate of the pathogen ( figure 2 ).",

If the network is close to homogeneous, the homogeneous-mixing compartmental model is a reasonable choice, although network models are equally tractable, and can be reduced to a few parameters by assuming an idealized approximation for the degree distribution (figure 2). If the population is heterogeneous, but falls into a few specific classes of networks, there may be simple modifications to the homogeneousmixing compartmental framework that perform quite well (e.g. Aparicio & Pascual 2007) , and again one has a choice of frameworks (figure 6). If, however, the network is exponential or scale-free, or perhaps is not well approximated by any of these common distributions, then neither the homogeneous-mixing model nor the modifications can adequately capture the evolving structure of the host network (figure 5).",

For example, Hethcote and Yorke successfully modelled the spread of gonorrhoea by dividing populations into several homogeneously mixed groups based on gender and sexual activity (Hethcote & Yorke 1984) . Anderson and May evaluated vaccination programmes for childhood infections using age-structured models, in which the transmission term is replaced by a 'who acquires infection from whom' matrix of transmission rates (Anderson & May 1985) . Bjornstad and Grenfell have developed the time-series SIR (TSIR) framework to model seasonal changes in contact patterns that influence the spread of measles Grenfell et al. 2002) . Ball and colleagues introduced a general patch model in which hosts mix at high rates locally and at low rates globally (Ball et al. 1997) . Although these approaches have been highly successful, we note that several of them require an a priori categorization of individuals into epidemiological type classes (e.g. by age, sex or location). In general, it may be difficult to identify epidemiologically meaningful groupings, particularly for a newly emerging disease.",
