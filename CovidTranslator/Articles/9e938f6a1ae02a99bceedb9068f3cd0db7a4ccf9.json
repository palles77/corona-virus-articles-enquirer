Two recent experimental papers suggest that interactions between the immune system and corticosterone may be important in mediating synergistic interactions between pathogens that enhance rates of co-infection in birds. As part of a long term study on the effect of the bacterial pathogen Mycoplasma gallisepticum in house finches Haemorhous mexicanus, Dana Hawley and her team asked the question to what extent are the stress hormones that are important for energy mobilization and regulation of the immune system influenced by experimental infection with the bacterium M. gallisepticum [2] . They found that corticosterone levels increased after house finches were infected with M. gallisepticum, decreased again to pre-infection levels once the infection was cleared, and that individuals with greater disease severity had the highest corticosterone concentrations. Trying to identify factors that influence West Nile virus transmission, Lynn Martin and his team started from the premise that stress hormones might represent a key link between individual-level of infection, population-levels of parasite transmission, and zoonotic disease risk. They experimentally manipulated zebra finch Taeniopygia guttata stress hormones by implanting corticosterone-filled silastic tubules and examined subsequent feeding preferences, feeding success, and productivity of mosquito vectors [3] .

Cornet et al. [4] asked to what extent variable relapse rates of birds with chronic Plasmodium infections would represent a plastic transmission strategy used by the parasite in fluctuating environments. They showed that in domestic canaries with chronic Plasmodium relictum infections the parasite responded to the birds being bitten by mosquitoes by increasing its parasitaemia, and hence increasing its transmission probability. On the other hand, while various authors have suggested that stress-related hormonal changes would increase haematozoan parasitaemia [7, 8] the effect of corticosterone on parasitaemia had already been tested experimentally by Applegate 45 years ago! While attempting to understand what drives the spring increase in Plasmodium relictum infection intensity in house sparrows with a chronic infection, Applegate [6] treated the birds with corticosterone; this resulted in an increase in Plasmodium parasitaemia: a higher proportion of blood films had demonstrable parasites, and a higher proportion of erythrocytes was infected than in the control group. In a follow up experiment, Applegate and Beaudoin [6] demonstrated that corticosterone and not gonadotropin caused the spring relapse in avian malaria.",

Could coinfection have contributed to the emergence and subsequent evoluton of virulence of M. gallisepticum [9, 10] ? At first glance, coinfection cannot be beneficial to either parasite, nor the host; if all else is equal, coinfected hosts should die faster than hosts with a single infection as they are experiencing two sources of pathology. Alternatively, the presence of two pathogens may reduce the immunopathological effects of an over-worked immune system and this may allow each pathogen to persist for longer in coinfected host. This could potentially enhance the transmission success of one or both pathogens or enhance colonization of a new host species by a novel pathogen.",

            "text": "Prior infection with one pathogen (the malaria parasite Plasmodium) may facilitate later infection with and transmission of another completely unrelated pathogen, the bacterium Mycoplasma gallisepticum. A similar situation is the example of Babesia microti (a malarialike parasite, that infects red blood cells and is the cause of babesiosis) and Borrelia burgdorferi, a bacterium that causes Lyme disease [11] . Diuk-Wasser and colleagues showed how Babesia only successfully establishes in populations in which Lyme disease is already present. More subtly, these examples suggest that prior infections such as malaria, or parasitic helminths, may help facilitate the emergence of pathogens such as Ebola, Nipah, Dhondt Hendra, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) or Zika virus. It also underlines the previously under-explored potential role that coinfection interacting with host endocrine stress might play in mediating emergence of novel pathogens. For example, pregnant mothers who are often immunologically stressed and have major upheavals in their endocrine system are more susceptible to mosquito bites [12] . Was this a significant factor in the emergence of Zika virus? To date, the role of endocrine and nutritional processes in the within-hosts dynamics of pathogens have been essentially ignored. It may prove to be an important missing link in many future studies of the emergence and subsequent coevolutionary dynamics of many host parasite systems. Arrows show causal relationships proven experimentally. Infection with Mycoplasma gallisepticum causes an increase in corticosterone level (A) [2] , making the bird more attractive to mosquitoes (B) [3] , and causing an increase in Plasmodium parasitaemia directly (C) [5, 6] and indirectly (D) [4] . The question mark represents the hypothesis that Plasmodium infection in a bird increases disease severity caused by Mycoplasma gallisepticum which would result in a positive feedback loop. Dhondt ",
