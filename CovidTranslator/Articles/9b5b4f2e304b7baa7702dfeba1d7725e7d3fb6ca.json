Pathogens of animals and plants are being transported as well, and this can affect global food security. 4 Establishment of arthropod vectors, such as mosquitoes, that are competent to transmit human pathogens in new geographic areas expands the regions that are vulnerable to outbreaks of some vectorborne infections. This chapter focuses only on pathogens that directly affect human health and on their sources (Table 106-1) .

            "text": "Infectious diseases vary by geographic region and population, and they change over time. When moving from one region to another, humans are exposed to a variety of potential pathogens and also serve as part of the global dispersal process. 1 Microbes picked up at one time and in one place may manifest in disease (and potentially be transmitted) far away in time and place. Because many microbes have the capacity to persist in the human host for months, years or even decades, the relevant time frame for study of geographic exposures becomes a lifetime. Furthermore, microbes also move and change and reach humans via multiple channels. Caring for patients requires an understanding of the basic factors that underlie the geography of human diseases and events that cause shifts in the distribution and burden of specific diseases. Current travel capacity contributes to massive population movements and rapid shifts in diseases and their distributions, but technology also provides communication channels that aid clinicians who care for patients with unfamiliar medical problems. This chapter reviews the factors that shape the global distribution of infectious diseases and the forces that are expected to shift distributions in the future. Examples illustrate the range of factors that affect the distribution and expression of infectious diseases. 2 Many authors have traced the origins and spread of infectious diseases through history. A century and a half ago, John Snow noted that epidemics of cholera followed major routes of commerce and appeared first at seaports when entering a new region. Yersinia pestis, the cause of plague, accompanied trade caravans and moved across oceans with rats on ships. Exploration of the New World by Europeans introduced a range of human pathogens that killed one-third or more of the local populations in some areas of the Americas. The plants and",

Today, most infections that are found only in focal areas have biologic or geoclimatic constraints that prevent them from being introduced into other geographic regions. For example, the fungus Coccidioides immitis, which causes coccidioidomycosis, thrives in surface soil in arid and semiarid areas with alkaline soil, hot summers and short, moist winters; it is endemic in parts of south-western USA, Mexico and Central and South America. People become infected when they inhale arthroconidia from soil. An unusual wind storm in 1977 lifted soil from the endemic region and deposited it in northern California, outside the usual endemic region. 5 In general, infection is associated with residence in or travel through the endemic region.

Malaria is a vector-borne infection that cannot become established in a region unless a competent vector is present. The presence of a competent vector is a necessary but not sufficient condition for human infection. The mosquito must have a source of malarial parasites (gametocytemic human or, rarely, nonhuman primates), appropriate bioclimatic conditions and access to other humans. The ambient temperature influences the human biting rate of the mosquito, the incubation period for the parasite in the mosquito and the daily survival rate of the mosquito. Prevailing temperature and humidity must allow the mosquito to survive long enough for the malarial parasite to undergo maturation to reach an infective state for humans. Competent vectors exist in many areas with no malaria transmission, because the other conditions are not met. These areas are at risk of the introduction of malaria, as illustrated by several recent examples in the USA and elsewhere. 7, 8 An estimated 77% of the world's population lived in areas with malaria transmission in 1900. By 2002 about 48% lived in at-risk areas, but because of population growth and migration the total global population exposed to malaria had increased by 2 billion since 1900 (see Figure 106 -2). 9 For example, in Africa, the population in malaria endemic zones increased by almost 200 million people between 2000 and 2010. 10 This contrasts with the situation in the USA, where malaria was endemic in many areas into the 20th century ( Figure 106 -3), with estimates of more than 600 000 cases in 1914. Even before extensive mosquito control programs were instituted, transmission declined. Demographic factors (population shifts from rural to urban areas), improved housing with screened doors and windows, and the availability of treatment were among the factors that contributed to this decrease.",

The World Health Organization estimated that about 65% of infectious diseases deaths globally in 1995 were due to infections transmitted from person to person. 17 Burden from these diseases is unevenly distributed across populations and among different countries. Poor sanitation, lack of clean water, crowded living conditions and lack of vaccination contribute to the disproportionate burden from many of these infections in lowand middle-income countries (LMIC). In industrialized countries, pockets of high risk persist. Disadvantaged populations have higher rates of tuberculosis, HIV and many other infectious and noninfectious diseases.

Other pilgrims who became colonized with the epidemic strain introduced it into sub-Saharan Africa, where it caused a wave of epidemics in 1988 and 1989. The epidemic clone spread to several countries. 28 In 1996 in Africa, major outbreaks of meningococcal meningitis occurred (>185 000 reported cases with a case fatality rate of ~10%) caused by N. meningitidis serogroup A, clone III-1. 29 In Canada, a virulent group C, ET-15 strain of N. meningitidis was associated with an increased case fatality rate. 30 In these examples, the virulence of the microbe and travel and trade acted synergistically to change the epidemiology and burden of disease. In 2000, serogroup W135 N. meningitidis caused an outbreak of infection in pilgrims to the Hajj and spread to their contacts and others around the world. Studies using serotyping, multilocus sequence typing, multilocus DNA fingerprints and other techniques found identical W135 isolates in multiple countries. Before this outbreak, pilgrims from many countries received a vaccine that protected against serotype A but not W135. The polysaccharide meningococcal vaccine reduces risk of disease in the vaccinated individual but does not prevent oropharyngeal carriage or transmission of N. meningitidis. 31",

A key factor that determines whether a pathogen can persist and spread in a new population is its basic reproductive rate, which is the number of secondary infections produced in a susceptible population by a typical infectious individual. To become established in a new host population, a pathogen must have a basic reproductive rate that exceeds one. The basic reproductive rate for a pathogen is affected by a range of biologic, social and environmental factors, so may vary by place and population. Also critical in determining how easily an infection can be controlled is the proportion of transmission that occurs before onset of symptoms or during asymptomatic infection. 32 Multiple factors restrict the introduction and spread or persistence of infection in a region (Box 106-4). Nutrition determines susceptibility to and severity of many infections. A substantial proportion of disease burden in LMIC can be attributed to childhood and maternal weight and micronutrient deficiences. 33 Before measles vaccine was introduced, the epidemiology of measles exhibited marked periodicity in large populations, with peaks typically occurring every 2-3 years. 34 In small island communities (or other isolated populations), outbreaks typically occur only after periodic introductions from outside. It has been suggested that measles, as it has been known in the 20th century, could not have established itself much before 3000 bce because before that time human populations had not achieved sufficient size to sustain the virus.",

Because four serotypes of dengue virus exist and infection with one serotype does not confer lasting immunity against other serotypes, a person can be infected more than once. One study found the risk of developing severe dengue after repeat infection was 82-103 times greater than after primary infection. 39 In an outbreak in Cuba, 98.5% of cases of dengue shock syndrome (DSS) or dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) were in persons with a prior dengue infection. 40 Risk factors for severe dengue identified in epidemiological studies include young age, virus strain, and host genetics. 41 Factors that have aided the spread of dengue include increasing travel to and from tropical regions; expansion of the regions infested with Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus; population growth and increasing urbanization in tropical areas; the use of nonbiodegradable and other containers that make ideal breeding sites for the mosquito; inadequate vector control programs and increasing resistance of vectors to insecticides.",

In Mexico, for example, more than 50% of patients with late-onset seizures have computed tomography (CT) evidence of the parasitic infection, neurocysticercosis. 67 In Peru, 29% of persons born outside Lima who had onset of seizures after 20 years of age had serologic evidence of cysticercosis. 68 In northern Thailand, melioidosis is a common cause of sepsis, accounting for 40% of all deaths from community-acquired sepsis. 69 In considering the consequences of exposures in other geographic regions, relevant data in assessing the probability of various infections include the duration of visit, activities and living conditions during the stay and the time lapsed since the visit. Among British travelers to West Africa, the relative risk of malaria was 80.3 times higher for persons staying for 6-12 months than among those staying 1 week. 70 In Malawi, the risk of schistosome infection increased directly with duration of stay. Seroprevalence was 11% for those present for 1 year or less, but this increased to 48% among those present for 4 years or longer. 71 In a study of persons with cysticercosis, the average time between acquisition of infection and onset of symptoms was about 7 years. 72 For malaria, it is necessary to know not only whether infection can be acquired in a specific location but also the species of parasites present and the patterns of resistance to antimalarial agents. Figure  106 -8 shows the distribution of malaria. Analysis of data from the GeoSentinel Surveillance network, a network that uses travelers as a sentinel population, finds marked differences in the spectrum of disease in relation to the place of exposure. 22, 73 Expression of disease may vary depending on age of first exposure, immunologic status of the host, genetic factors and the number and timing of subsequent exposures. Temporary residents of endemic regions have different patterns of response to a number of helminths from those of long-term residents. In cases of loiasis, temporary residents have immunologic hyperresponsiveness, high-grade eosinophilia and severe symptoms that are not seen in long-term residents of the same area. 74 Genetic factors can affect susceptibility to infection or expression of disease. Some persons, for example, are genetically resistant to infection with parvovirus because they lack appropriate receptors on their erythrocytes. 75 Persons lacking Duffy factor cannot be infected with the malarial parasite, P. vivax.",

Importation of wild animals from Ghana into the USA led to an outbreak of monkeypox, an infection previously known to exist in Africa. Humans became infected by handling domestic prairie dogs (sold as pets) that had been housed with the imported wild animals from Africa. 60 Aedes albopictus introduced into the USA via used tires shipped from Asia 61 has since become established in at least 21 contiguous states of the USA and in Hawaii. Aedes albopictus can transmit dengue and chikungunya viruses and is a competent laboratory vector of La Crosse, yellow fever and other viruses. Multiple strains of eastern equine encephalitis virus have been isolated from Aedes albopictus in Florida.",

From there, the rabies enzootic spread for hundreds of miles, reaching raccoons in suburban and densely populated regions of the north-east USA. Spill-over of the rabies virus variant into cats, dogs and other animal populations and direct raccoon-human interactions have had costly consequences. 63 Highly pathogenic avian influenza A (H5N1) is a global concern. 64 It is entrenched in poultry populations in Asia and Africa and has caused outbreaks in Europe and the Middle East. Although the virus causes high mortality in infected humans, thus far H5N1 has not been able to establish sustained transmission from person to person. Most humans appear to have been infected via close contact with poultry or their products. Although the virus can be carried by migratory birds, 65 most introductions appear to have been related to movement of poultry and poultry products. In South East Asia risk was associated with duck abundance, human population and rice cropping intensity. 66 946 SECTION 6 International Medicine: Principles of International Health *Note: In this map, countries with areas endemic for malaria are shaded completely even if transmission occurs only in a small part of the country.
