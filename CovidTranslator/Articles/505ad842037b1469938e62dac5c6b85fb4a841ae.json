Economists estimated a 41 per cent decline in East Asia tourism during 2003, loss of 11 billion yuan (US$1.3 billion) income to China, and loss of 2 billion Canadian dollars to the province of Ontario. 9 Globally they estimated SARS' adverse economic impact at US$100 billion. 3 Globally, the case fatality rate was estimated at 14-15 per cent. 10 WHO acknowledged that one consequence of travel restrictions against Canada might be failure of other countries to report SARS or other epidemics because of adverse economic consequences. Thus, effectiveness of the IHR came into question. 11",

WHO and its member countries adopted IHR 2005 to prevent and respond to globalization of public health risks through international travel and trade restrictions. Its terms bind 194 countries including all 193 WHO Member States. 12 Effective as of 2007, IHR 2005 expands the original IHR beyond specific diseases to include any event that constitutes a public health risk. It requires signatory countries to implement surveillance and reporting measures. 2 It also expanded WHO powers to declare public health emergencies, mandate disease surveillance, and to issue recommendations about travel and trade restrictions. 13 WHO guidelines mandate reporting disease cases or events that may constitute a 'public health emergency of international concern'-specific diseases, such as novel influenza viruses, and natural or human-source disease events such as release of chemical, biological, or radiological materials. 12 The WHO Director-General, in consultation with an Emergency Committee, is to determine whether an event constitutes such an emergency. 4 They will assess risks of disease spread and justifications offered for restrictions on international travel or trade: that is, do they meet the requirements of IHR 2005? 2 If WHO declares a 'Public Health Emergency of International Concern' it may then issue temporary recommendations for country responses. The drafters intended to minimize interference with international traffic and trade. 2 Since implementation of IHR 2005 in 2007, WHO has declared few such emergencies. 13 IHR 2005 also requires signatory states to implement systems to strengthen public health surveillance and responses, 12 including at border crossings. 2 National strengthening of capabilities are to be complete by 2012: assessment, plan of action, and full implementation. 14 Extensions may be granted to low resource countries if justified by lack of funding. 13, 14 To redress unilateral state imposition of trade and travel restrictions without adequate scientific basis, the IHR 2005 requires states meet a burden of proof to justify economic restrictions.",

            "text": "The 2009 H1N1 influenza outbreak emerged in Mexico, then spread further into North America and to most countries worldwide. Mexico responded aggressively, instituting broad community mitigation strategies: closure of public places and businesses, and education about sanitation measures, quarantine, and isolation. 17 During the spring of 2009, significant social and economic disruption caused trade losses estimated at more than $2.3 billion. 17 International health experts found that Mexico acted quickly, proactively, and with transparency. 18 Yet legal and academic public health commentators looked back to question the benefits of Mexico's actions in light of the resulting negative economic and social impact plus possible repercussions, such as discouraging future outbreak reporting. 15, 18 Again disease spread was associated with travel. The United States CDC reported that several countries identified 2009 H1N1 influenza infections in persons who traveled to Mexico 7 days prior to illness onset. 19 Airline transport data showed a strong correlation between countries that received high numbers of passengers from Mexico, and increased risk of disease importation. 20 Despite Mexico's efforts and the response of the WHO, countries enacted trade and travel sanctions unilaterally. China and Hong Kong imposed quarantine for travelers from North America. 21 Other countries advised against non-essential Mexico travel, and some went further, enacting travel bans to other affected countries. 21 Some states also restricted exports of pork products, despite lack of support from WHO or the World Animal Health Organization. 13 Twenty countries banned imports of pork and other kinds of meat from Mexico, Canada and the US. 21 Egypt took the extreme measure of slaughtering 400 000 pigs. 21 Mexico attempted to block these scientifically unsupported trade restrictions by filing a statement with WTO. The response was slow and unsatisfactory: a WTO joint statement with other international organizations that pork products were not the source of 2009 H1N1 influenza failed to rule that import bans violated, for lack of scientific evidence, international trade treaties. 15 Two 22, 23 Yet, underreporting of disease outbreaks associated with perceived threats of adverse economic consequences is not limited to SARS and 2009 H1N1 influenza. Developing countries that depend on international trade and tourism but lack adequate disease surveillance capacity have historically underreported or failed to report epidemics. 24 Under the original IHRs, certain WHO Member States failed to comply with reporting requirements. These lapses prompted other countries to impose excessive health measures, including some prohibited by the IHR -creating further disincentives to report, for fear of economic harm. 15 Even under IHR 2005, this pattern continued with SARS and 2009 H1N1 influenza. Conflict between public health and trade and travel interests have included: K beef import bans for bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), K travel restrictions due to infectious disease outbreaks in developing countries, and K the recent ban on imported vegetables during the European Union E. coli outbreak. [25] [26] [27] Hence, legal and public health observers currently share the concern that unnecessary trade, travel, and human rights restrictions (such as humane treatment of extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis patients) may continue to impede reporting under IHR 2005. 4, 13 Gaps in Global Governance IHR 2005 relies on Member States to define appropriate emergency protective health measures. However, there is no formal system to review rapidly trade restrictions imposed during public health emergencies. A country has no specific international forum or mechanism to turn to for review of economic sanctions imposed by other countries during an emergency, as in the case of Mexico during the 2009 H1N1 influenza. 15 Lack of mandatory dispute resolution or enforcement mechanisms within IHR 2005 and reliance upon WTO dispute adjudication make redress and enforcement unlikely. These deficits create further disincentives to report outbreaks and to comply with IHR 2005. 13 IHR 2005 permits WHO to suggest that states engaged in overly restrictive health measures 'reconsider' their approaches, review restrictive measures within 3 months (taking into account WHO recommendations and IHR 2005) -and within 48 hours of implementation, inform WHO of restrictive measures, the health rationale, and the scientific evidence. 2 Given the confusing mix of state underreporting and imposition of unsupported trade and travel restrictions, plus the need to report rapidly Public Health Emergencies of International Concern, analysts have called for exploring new solutions. All recognize that public health considerations may take precedence over trade. They allow members to manage international trade policies in a way consistent with national health objectives. 28 Both the TBT and SPS Agreements permit public health-based trade restrictions, provided they do not unnecessarily infringe on trade. 28 SPS specifically allows states to impose trade restrictions to ensure food safety and protection from infectious diseases, when supported with scientific evidence. 28 TRIPS and the Doha Declaration deal primarily with access to drugs at affordable prices through globalized intellectual property regimes, including the option for states, under certain circumstances, to grant compulsory licensing for production of products to meet public health needs. 28 Trade restrictions related to public health have generally been considered compatible with WTO agreements; when time-limited and minimizing collateral disruption of trade. 15 Prior to IHR 2005, commentators suggested that WTO, using its dispute settlement mechanism, was an appropriate forum to address concerns about trade restrictions emanating from SPS-based health measures. 29 Assessment of what constitutes a health risk, however, differs across WTO agreements, varying in scope and in the evidence needed to support restrictive trade measures. 28 The result has been fragmented trade and public health regulation, lacking consistency and systematic public health input from WHO.",
