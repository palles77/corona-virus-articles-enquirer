A previous surveillance study in the Qikiqtaaluk Region identified a substantial number of cases with multiple infections (coinfection). 6, 11 In 2009, influenza A (H1N1) virus emerged and disproportionately affected indigenous populations. 12, 13 The primary objective of this surveillance study was to compare hospital admission rates for lower respiratory tract infections, including respiratory syncytial virus infections, across the Canadian Arctic to assess for regional differences, specifically, to identify the regions with the highest burden of disease in 2009. Secondary objectives included describing the viruses identified and coinfections.",

A case-control study in the Qikiqtaaluk Region identified the following factors as being independently and significantly associated with an increased risk of hospital admission for lower respiratory tract infection: Inuit race, smoking during the pregnancy, residing in communities without a hospital, overcrowding and lack of breastfeeding. 11 Canadian Inuit, like many other indigenous peoples globally, have major gaps in determinants of health 20 such as food security 21 and number of people in the household. 22 The reason for such a large discrepancy between the Northwest Territories and the other regions is not clear. Contributing factors may include lower unemployment rates and higher per-capita income in the Northwest Territories, 23 which influence food security and nutrition and, consequently, rates of lower respiratory tract infection. The proportion of Inuit in Nunavut and Nunavik is 80%-90%, compared to 11.1% in the Northwest Territories, 24 which suggests that an important risk factor may be ethnicity. A 5-year chart review comparing admission rates for lower respiratory tract infection among Inuit infants in Nunavut versus First Nations infants in the Northwest Territories showed a higher incidence among the Inuit despite similar geographic and social conditions. 8 The authors raised the question of genetic predisposition to severe disease. 8 Consistent with that hypothesis, a case-control study showed that an Inuit infant with 4 Inuit grandparents had a nearly 4-fold higher risk of hospital admission for lower respiratory tract infections compared to children of mixed race and non-Inuit children. 11 In a retrospective study of another First Nations group in northern Ontario, McCuskee and colleagues 25 reported lower rates of respiratory tract infections, 44 per 1000 infant-years, comparable to those in the Northwest Territories but much lower than those in the rest of the Arctic.",

            "text": "Respiratory syncytial virus was the most common virus associated with lower respiratory tract infections in our study, followed by picornaviruses. This distribution is consistent with a recent study of children admitted with communityacquired pneumonia in the United States. 26 Most of the infants in the current study were born at term, without underlying disease. The annual hospital admission rate for respiratory syncytial virus infection rate in 2002, before the introduction of palivizumab, was 166 per 1000 live births in the first year of life and as high as 328 per 1000 live births among infants less than 6 months of age in rural communities in the Qikiqtaaluk Region. This is in contrast to the 5-20 admissions per 1000 live births for US infants. 9 The annual rates of respiratory syncytial virus infection among infants less than 1 year of age in the Kitikmeot Region and Nunavik in the current study, 195 and 176 per 1000 live births, respectively, are higher than those in sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America and Asia. 1 Not only are these rates exceedingly high, there are also very large costs associated with these admissions, primarily related to expensive medical evacuation and lengthy stays in the intensive care unit. 27 Overall, 30% of infants in whom a virus was detected had coinfection. This is consistent with previous findings in the Qikiqtaaluk Region of viral coinfection rates of 18.2% by enzyme-linked immunoassay in 1995 6 and 21.6% on initial screening with a direct immunofluorescent panel in 2002. 11 The significance of viral coinfection remains controversial. Because the polymerase chain reaction method is highly sensitive, it may detect viruses that are not responsible for the illness or from remote infection. In the current study, the length of stay increased with increasing number of viruses detected. Thus, regardless of the biological mechanism, coinfection appeared to be a marker of more severe disease. We hypothesize that a contributor to multiple infections in this population is overcrowding. A previous study showed that overcrowding in the Qikiqtaaluk Region had an independent OR of 2.49 for risk of admission for lower respiratory tract infection. 11 Canadian Inuit are 10 times more likely than other Canadians to live in overcrowded, substandard housing. 22 The prevalence of household crowding is higher in Nunavut than in other northern areas (30% v. 12%). 28",

However, with the surveillance and chart review we believe that very few hospital admissions were missed. Not all infants had full viral testing, which underestimates rates of viral detection. Infants admitted to tertiary centres are more likely to have complete testing, which creates a bias toward detection of viruses in sicker infants. Severity of illness was determined only by the length of stay as transfer to tertiary centres may be biased by local expertise and proximity. Although this study was successful in capturing most admissions for lower respiratory tract infections from the Canadian Arctic, milder cases admitted overnight to a local health centre may have been missed. As this study did not capture outpatient visits, the true burden of lower respiratory tract infections is underestimated.",

Respiratory syncytial virus infection remains one of the most important health issues in these regions and needs to be addressed as a major public health priority, with concerted efforts to reduce the burden of disease.",

Among the 264 cases with positive results, 1 infectious agent was detected in 184 cases (69.7%), 2 in 67 cases (25.4%), 3 in 10 cases (3.8%), and 4 in 3 cases (1.1%). Respiratory syncytial virus was detected in 124 admissions (41.6% of admissions with testing for this virus); there were 51 cases of coinfection. Piconaviruses were detected in 111 cases (51 alone, 60 as part of a coinfection). Influenza A (H1N1) was detected in 36 infants (12.1% of those tested).
