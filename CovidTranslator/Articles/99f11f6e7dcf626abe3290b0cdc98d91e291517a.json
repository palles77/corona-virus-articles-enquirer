The HIV-1 protease inhibitors saquinavir, atazanavir, and ritonavir, were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and used in the culture medium at final concentrations of 1 \u03bcM or 5 \u03bcM. The DMSO at a final concentration of 0.1% was added to the control cultures. Cell culture. Human embryonic kidney cells (HEKs) from the 293T cell line (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA, U.S.A.) were cultured in the Dulbecco\uf0a2s Modified Eagle Medium (Invitrogen, Life Technologies Corporation, Carlsbad, CA, USA) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (BioWhittaker, Walkersville, MD, USA) at 37\u00b0 C in a 5% CO 2 environment. Luciferase reporter assay. The HEK293T cells were harvested from an actively growing culture and plated on CoStar White 96-well tissue culture plates (Corning Incorporated Life Sciences, Lowell, MA, USA) at 2 \u00d7 10 4 cells per well. After 24 hours at approximately 70% confluence, the cells were transfected with appropriate plasmid combinations using the jetPEI transfection reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions (Polyplus transfection, Illkirch-Graffenstaden, France): a plasmid for fusion protein CD4(HA)hivp-GAL4-VP16 or FAS(HA)-hivp-GAL4-VP16, a plasmid coding for (wild type or mutant) HIV-1 protease, the reporter plasmid pABM2 with GAL4-binding sites and coding for firefly luciferase (15 ng), and pHRL-TK coding for the constitutive Renilla luciferase transfection control (5 ng). The cells were harvested 24 or 48 hours after transfection and lysed with 25 \u00b5l of 1 \u00d7 Passive lysis buffer (Promega Corporation). The activities of the firefly luciferase and Renilla luciferase were measured using the dual-luciferase assay (Promega) and Orion II microplate reader (Berthold Technologies, Pforzheim, Germany). The activation of Gal4-VP16 was demonstrated (i) with relative luciferase expression (relative light units [RLUs]), where we normalized each sample's firefly luciferase activity with the constitutive Renilla luciferase activity determined within the same sample (Figures S3 and S4), (ii) with normalized relative luciferase expression (normalized RLUs), where we first normalized each sample's firefly luciferase activity with the constitutive Renilla luciferase activity and then normalized all results to the results, where the empty vector (pcDNA3) was present instead of pNL4\uf02d3.HSA.R\uf02d.E\uf02d (Figure S2), or (iii) by calculating the RLU relative to the output where the highest amount of plasmid pNL4\uf02d3.HSA.R\uf02d.E\uf02d, G48V/I54T, or V82A (Figure 3) or GFP-PR or GFP-PR(G48V/I54T) (Figure S5) was present in the medium without protease inhibitors. Confocal microscopy. HEK293T cells (5 \u00d7 10 4 cells per well) were seeded in 8-well tissue culture chambers (\u00b5-Slide 8 well, Ibidi Integrated BioDiagnostics, Martinsried, Germany). At 30% confluency, the cells were transfected with plasmids: 40 ng of CD4(HA)-hivp-CFP-6xHis or FAS(HA)-hivp-mCherry-2xNLS with or without 320 or 360 ng pNL4\uf02d3.HSA.R\uf02d.E\uf02d using the jetPEI transfection reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions (Polyplus transfection). pcDNA3 was added to the transfection mixture to obtain a total of 360 or 400 ng DNA per well. The images were acquired 2 days after transfection using a Leica TCS SP5 laser-scanning microscope mounted on a Leica DMI 6000 CS module equipped with an HCX PL APO 63x (NA 1.4) oil-immersion objective (Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany). A 458-nm laser line of a multi-ion argon laser was used for the excitation of the CFP, and an emitted light was detected between 480 and 550 nm. A 543-nm HeNe laser was used for the excitation of the mCherry, and an emitted light was detected between 560 and 620 nm. A 405-nm diode laser was used for the Hoechst 33442 dye excitation, with a detection window between 450 and 500 nm (Cat. No. 639, ImmunoChemistry Technologies, Bloomington, MN, U.S.A.). The Hoechst 33442, at a final concentration of 1 \uf06dg/ml, was added to the medium and incubated for 30 minutes at 37\u00b0 C in a 5% CO 2 environment before image visualization. A 633-nm HeNe laser was used for the excitation of secondary antibodies labeled with Alexa Fluor 647, and emitted light was detected between 650 and 700 nm. For the detection of the HA tags in the fusion transmembrane receptors CD4(HA)-hivp-GAL4-VP16 or FAS(HA)-hivp-GAL4-VP16, the cells were first fixed and permeabilized with 4% paraformaldehyde (Roti-Histofix, Carl Roth, Karlsruhe, Germany) and 0.1% Triton-X100 (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, U.S.A.). They were then incubated with rabbit anti-HA antibodies (Cat. No. H6908, Sigma) for 1 hour at 37\uf0b0\uf020C and Alexa Flour 647 conjugated goat antirabbit secondary antibodies (Cat. No. A-21245, Invitrogen, Life Technologies Corporation, Carlsbad, CA, U.S.A.) for 45 minutes at 37\u00b0 C. The Leica LAS AF software was used for the acquisition. Raw confocal images were analyzed using the ImageJ software (http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/). Quantification of IFN-\uf0621 levels. The HEK293T cells were harvested from an actively growing culture and plated on CoStar White 96-well tissue culture plates (Corning Incorporated Life Sciences, Lowell, MA, U.S.A.) at 2 \u00d7 10 4 cells per well. After 24 hours at approximately 70% confluence (96-well plates), the cells were transfected with appropriate plasmid combinations using the jetPEI transfection reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions: a plasmid for fusion protein CD4(HA)-hivp-GAL4-VP16 (10 ng), a plasmid coding for (wild type or mutant) HIV-1 protease, and an effector plasmid pABM2(IFN-\uf0621) with GAL4binding sites and coding for IFN-\uf0621 (15 ng). At 48 or 72 hours after transfection, we collected the culture medium. For determination of IFN-\uf0621 in the medium of the transfected HEK T cells, we used the AlphaLISA\u00ae kit (Product No. AL265 C/F, Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA, U.S.A.). The samples were analyzed in duplicate in half area 96-well plates (1/2 AreaPlate TM -96, Perkin Elmer) according to the manufacturer\u00b4s protocol. The plates were read using an EnSpire plate reader (Perkin Elmer). Nine to 10 standard assay points were used to generate a standard curve for the determination of IFN-\uf0621 concentrations in the measured samples. Western blot analysis. The HEK293T cells were harvested from an actively growing culture and plated on CoStar White 6-well tissue culture plates (Corning Incorporated Life Sciences, Lowell, MA, USA) at 1 \u00d7 Transmembrane receptor constructs are expressed at the cell surface of HEK293T cells. CD4(HA)-hivp-GAL4-VP16 and FAS(HA)-hivp-GAL4-VP16 were tagged with an HA-tag at the extracellular side of the receptors. Cells were transfected with (a) 80 ng of CD4(HA)-hivp-GAL4-VP16 or (b) FAS(HA)-hivp-GAL4-VP16. At 48 hours posttransfection, the cells were fixed, permeabilized, and stained with anti-HA (rabbit) antibodies, followed by fluorescently labeled secondary antibodies (Alexa Fluor 647 anti-rabbit). Receptors at the cell surface were detected using confocal microscopy. The microscopic images are representative of five separate observations. Scale bar = 10 \u00b5m. Activation of synthetic anti HIV-1 signaling device with HIV-1 protease. Active HIV-1 protease activated the transcriptional factor Gal4-VP16 by cleaving the HIV-1 protease cleavage site and releasing the activator from the membrane anchor. Consequently, the transcriptional activator GAL4-VP16 triggered the expression of reporter firefly luciferase. Saquinavir and ritonavir inhibited protease activity. The HEK293T cells were transfected with a reporter plasmid coding for the firefly luciferase, a plasmid constitutively expressing the Renilla luciferase, a plasmid expressing the HIV-1 protease (or the pcDNA3 plasmid as a negative control) (60 ng), and increasing amounts of the plasmids coding for (a) CD4(HA)hivp-GAL4-VP16 or (b) FAS(HA)-hivp-GAL4-VP16 in the medium with or without the HIV-1 protease inhibitors saquinavir or ritonavir (DMSO, 0.1% final concentration). The cells were lysed 48 hours after transfection, and the firefly and Renilla luciferase activities were measured. Normalized luciferase activity (nRLU) represents the activity of the Gal4-VP16 activator. Error bars represent the SD obtained from four experimental replicates. The data are representative of three independent experiments. The two-tailed student's t-test, assuming two-sample equal variance, was used for pairwise comparisons. HIV-1 protease mutants activate the synthetic anti-HIV-1 signaling device. The HEK293T cells were transfected with a reporter plasmid coding for the firefly luciferase reporter, a plasmid constitutively expressing the Renilla luciferase, the plasmid pNL4\uf02d3.HSA.R\uf02d.E\uf02d or the plasmid for HIV-1 protease mutants (G48V/I54T or V82A), and 10 ng of (a) CD4(HA)-hivp-GAL4-VP16 or (b) 10 ng of FAS(HA)-hivp-GAL4-VP16. The cells were lysed 24 hours after transfection, and the activity of the firefly and Renilla luciferase reporters was measured. RLU represents the relative luciferase activity or Gal4-VP16 activity. Error bars represent the SD obtained from four experimental replicates. The data are representative of three independent experiments.",
