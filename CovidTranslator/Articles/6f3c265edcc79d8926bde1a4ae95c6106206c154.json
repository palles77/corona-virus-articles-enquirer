In addition, several experiments have shown that NGP1-01 has neuroprotective activity ( Fig. 1) . 6 intracellular calcium that was challenged with cumulative additions of the compounds to be tested. The data presented in Table 1 indicate that the presence of a substituent in C-3 in the 2-oxaadamantane nucleus is essential for NMDA receptor antagonism. Thus, primary amine 7 and all its N-alkylated and N-dialkylated derivatives (2a,b, 3a,b, 4, and 8) are inactive as it is the case of the methyl derivatives 10a and 11a. Phenyl derivative 10c is only a weak NMDA receptor antagonist while more lipophilic amines 10b and 10d show a similar potency than amantadine. Further enhancement in potency was achieved by alkylation of 10b, the most active derivative being 12, a tertiary amine that is seven times more potent than amantadine, but still ten times less potent than memantine. Contrary to our expectations, all the benzyl derivatives were found to be inactive. This is in striking contrast with NGP1-01 that features a benzyl group essential for NMDA receptor antagonism, and with previous work by our groups that found that benzylated ring-contracted analogues of amantadine showed NMDA receptor antagonism. 12",

However, current drugs are characterized by toxicity, the need for administration under medical supervision, and in many cases, a lack of efficacy. New drugs to combat this important disease are urgently needed. A range of adamantylamine compounds have trypanocidal activity. 4 We therefore investigated whether this property also extended to (2-oxaadamant-1-yl)amine derivatives.",

As was the case with the NMDA receptor antagonism, the presence of a substitution at the C-3 position in the 2-oxadamantane nucleus was found to be essential for trypanocidal activity. Of these compounds, the tertiary amines 11a,b were found to be the most active. Amine 11b had an IC 50 = 10.92 \u00b1 0.21 \u03bcM and an IC 90 = 15.54 \u00b1 1.14 \u03bcM, while the trimethyl derivative 11a had an IC 50 = 3.97 \u00b1 0.75 \u03bcM and an IC 90 = 6.82 \u00b1 0.84 \u03bcM. Amine 11a was the most potent compound tested, being approximately twice as active as rimantadine (IC 50 = 7.04 \u00b1 0.12 \u03bcM; IC 90 = 13.97 \u00b1 1.68 \u03bcM), and at least 30 times more active than amantadine (IC 50 > 130 \u03bcM). Amines 2a,b, 3a,b, 4, 7, and 8, which lack the C3 substitution, had no activity at concentrations up to 5 mg mL \u22121 .

The presence of a substitution at the C-3 position is essential for NMDA receptor antagonism. Although 11b, 12, and 15 were more potent than amantadine against NMDAinduced calcium increase in cerebellar granule neurons, they were less potent than memantine. In contrast with the model compound NGP1-01, all our benzyl derivatives were devoid of NMDA receptor antagonism activity. None of the tested compounds showed antiviral activity. Two tertiary amines, 11a and 11b, displayed a significant level of trypanocidal activity; 11a was twice as active as rimantadine. The mechanism by which adamantylamine derivatives kill trypanosomes is unknown, but it has been hypothesized by analogy with the known properties of this class of compound that it may involve channel blocking activity. 4 The data obtained with the trimethyl amine 11a now provides a basis for exploring if related derivatives have enhanced activity.",

For GC/MS analyses, a 30-meter column [5% diphenyl-95% dimethylpolysiloxane, conditions: 10 psi, initial temperature: 35 \u00b0C (2 min), then heating at a range of 8 \u00b0C/min till 300 \u00b0C, then isothermic at 300 \u00b0C] was used. The electron impact (70 eV) or chemical ionization (CH 4 ) techniques were used. Only significant ions are given: those with higher relative abundance, except for the ions with higher m/z values. Accurate mass measurements were obtained using ESI technic. Absorption values in the IR spectra (KBr) are given as wave-numbers (cm \u22121 ). Only the more intense bands are given. Column chromatography was performed on silica gel 60 \u00c5 (35-70 mesh).

An additional portion of NaBH 3 CN (95%, 100 mg, 1.60 mmol) and acetaldehyde (0.26 mL, 4.8 mmol) was added, the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 16 h, and then it was concentrated in vacuo to dryness. Water (30 mL) was added to the residue, the suspension was basified with NaHCO 3 (saturated aqueous solution), and was extracted with EtOAc (3 \u00d7 15 mL). The combined organic extracts were dried with anhyd Na 2 SO 4 , filtered, and concentrated in vacuo. The residue was taken in EtOAc and 12\u00b7HCl (320 mg, 73% yield) was precipitated by adding an excess of a solution of HCl in Et 2 O.

Cells were loaded with 6 \u03bcM Fura-2 AM (Invitrogen-Molecular Probes) for 45 min. Afterwards, the coverslip was mounted on a quartz cuvette containing a Locke-Hepes buffer using a special holder. Measurements were performed using a Perkin-Elmer LS-50B fluorometer equipped with a fast-filter accessory, under mild agitation and at 37 \u00b0C. Analysis from each sample was recorded real-time during 1200 s. After stimulation with NMDA or glutamate (100 \u03bcM, in the presence of 10 \u03bcM glycine), increasing cumulative concentrations of the compound to be tested were added. The percentages of inhibition at every tested concentration were analyzed using a nonlinear regression curve fitting (variable slope) by using the software GraphPad Prism 4.0.",
