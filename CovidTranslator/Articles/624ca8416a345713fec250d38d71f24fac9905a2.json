It is known to cleave small peptides, such as angiotensin I and bradykinin and changes their biological activities, leading to upregulation of blood pressure. Here we describe a new activity for ACE: a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored protein releasing activity (GPIase activity). Unlike its peptidase activity, GPIase activity is weakly inhibited by the tightly binding ACE inhibitor and not inactivated by substitutions of core amino acid residues for the peptidase activity, suggesting that the active site elements for GPIase differ from those for peptidase activity. ACE shed various GPI-anchored proteins from the cell surface, and the process was accelerated by the lipid raft disruptor filipin. The released products carried portions of the GPI anchor, indicating cleavage within the GPI moiety. Further analysis by high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry predicted the cleavage site at the mannosemannose linkage. GPI-anchored proteins such as TESP5 and PH-20 were released from the sperm membrane of wild-type mice but not in Ace knockout sperm in vivo. Moreover, peptidase-inactivated E414D mutant ACE and also PI-PLC rescued the eggbinding deficiency of Ace knockout sperms, implying that ACE plays a crucial role in fertilization through this activity.",

Patients with the acquired hematopoietic disorder paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria have defective biosynthesis of GPI in hematopoietic stem cells 1, 2 . The discovery of the PIGA gene and its mutations in paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria has opened the avenue for investigating the mechanisms involved in GPI biosynthesis, although the information on the metabolic system of GPI-anchored proteins is still limited 6, 7 .",

            "text": "First, we established an assay system to monitor the GPIase activity, taking advantage of the temperature-dependent phase separation of the aqueous TritonX-114 solution, which can separate water-soluble released proteins (products) from detergent-soluble GPI-anchored proteins (substrates) at 37 \u00b0C. When GPI-anchored proteins are deprived of their lipid moiety, they shift from the detergent-soluble phase to the water-soluble phase. This assay system was used for monitoring GPIase activity through purification. We examined this activity in various organs using both EGFP-GPI and the placental alkaline phosphatase (PLAP) as probes for GPI-anchored proteins and found a substantial activity in testicular germ cells (see Supplementary Fig. 1 online) . We also examined the expression of Gpld1, the gene that encodes a GPI anchor-cleaving enzyme in mammals 22, 23 , in various tissues. Because testicular germ cells do not express Gpld1, this activity may be compensated by other factors (Supplementary Fig. 2 online) . Therefore, we decided to identify the molecular entity of the enzyme responsible for GPIase activity in these cells. Using serial liquid chromatography that started from detergent-soluble fraction of mouse testicular germ cells, we purified a 100-kDa protein and subsequently identified it as ACE by proteomics analysis (Fig. 1a , Table 1 and Supplementary Fig. 3 online). To confirm that this GPIase activity involved ACE, we performed a similar assay using either a recombinant product of testicular isoform ACE (ACE-t; Supplementary Fig. 4 online) or a commercially available rabbit ACE (ACE-S) and purified PLAP as substrate ( Supplementary  Fig. 5 online). The products released by this activity had the same size as those of bacterial phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase (PI-PLC), a commonly used GPI anchor-cleaving enzyme, implying that this activity cleaves GPI-anchored protein located in proximity to the cleavage site of PI-PLC (Fig. 1b) . Similar activities were shown by both molecules in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1c , data not shown), confirming that ACE was responsible for GPIase activity and did not require other factors for the action.",

Because EDTA has some inhibitory effects on PLAP enzyme action 24 , immunoblotting was performed using antibody specific for PLAP to check for PLAP release. GPIase activity was inhibited by 1 mM of EDTA but not by an amount (10% less) at which peptidase activity was considerably inhibited (Fig. 2a) .

These mutants showed only a trace peptidase activity but retained GPIase activity at a level comparable with that of wildtype ACE-t (Fig. 2b) . The GPIase activity of H413K-H417K mutant, which cannot capture the zinc ion at the peptidase active site, was also inhibited by high-dose EDTA but not by CyDTA or EGTA (Fig. 2c) , suggesting that EDTA-induced inhibition of GPIase activity is mediated in a non-metal-chelating manner 25, 26 and that the GPIase action of ACE does not require zinc ion.

Most of the GPI-anchored proteins are localized and packed in the lipid raft [28] [29] [30] . Furthermore, increased accessibility of GPI-anchored proteins to shedding enzyme was observed upon disruption of lipid raft 31 . Because filipin has no pharmacological effects on ACE GPIase activity, as assessed by PLAP conversion assay (data not shown), exogenous ACE seems to be prevented from accessing the substrate molecules by this membrane microstructure. In contrast, both ACE and PI-PLC had no effect on the transmembrane protein E-cadherin, implying that the activity of ACE is unique for GPI-anchored protein shedding.

This conclusion was supported by the fact that its tandem mass spectra showed intense dehydrated ions of (M + H) + at m/z 642 and less intense ions at m/z 498 that underwent neutral loss of mannose-H 2 O. These results suggest that ACE cleaves GPI anchor as an endo-mannosidase, different from PI-PLC cleavage, which is more proximate to the protein.",

Furthermore, this activity of ACE might also be different from that of GPI-PLD, the only enzyme known so far to cleave GPI anchor in mammals 22, 23 . It has been reported that GPI-PLD releases GPI-anchored protein only when it is expressed intracellularly in culture cells 23 . In contrast, ACE efficiently released GPI-anchored protein from the cell surface. Because GPI-PLD cleaves GPI anchor at the phosphorus-oxygen bond of the phosphatidylinositol backbone 22 , inositol acylation may also prevent completion of GPI-anchored protein release by GPI-PLD. Indeed, GPI-PLD could not release DAF from the intact erythrocyte 37 . In contrast, A recent crystallographic study has shown that positioning of Glu414 is consistent with its function and that ACE has a single fissure-like groove with zinc buried in the center 19 . Two histidines in the well-characterized core sequences of the catalytic site, HEMGH and downstream glutamate 17 , are ligated with zinc. ACE-specific inhibitors also bind here, implying that this structure is indispensable for the peptidase activity. On the other hand, the results of amino acid replacements and metal chelating experiments suggest that the microstructure necessary for the GPIase activity is different from that required for peptidase activity.",

We believe that the sperm capacitation process includes a similar reaction caused by filipin treatment of culture cells.

Based on these findings, our results suggest two scenarios: (i) functional activation of some GPI-anchored proteins on the sperm surface upon their release; (ii) exposure of a zona pellucida-binding factor after the shedding of some GPI-anchored proteins. By using a cell-surface biotinylation technique, we found that ACE released several proteins from the membrane fraction of germ cells (G.K., unpublished data).

Ace cDNA was obtained by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using mouse testis cDNA as a template and primer pairs, 5\u00b4-TGAATTCCACCATGGGCCAAGGTTGGGCTACTCCAGG-3\u00b4 and 5\u00b4-GAATTCGTCACTTATCATCATCATCCTTATAATCCTGCTGTGGCTCCAG GTACAGGC-3\u00b4. This encodes a FLAG-tagged version of the soluble testicular isoform. Peptidase-inactivated mutants with amino acid Glu414 replaced by aspartate or His413 and His417 replaced by lysine were synthesized by sitedirected mutagenesis using 5\u00b4-CTTGGTGATAGCGCACCACGATATGGGCC ACATCCAGTATTTCATGCA-3\u00b4 and 5\u00b4-CATGGAGGACTTGGTGATAGCGC ACAAGGAAATGGGCAAGATCCAGT ATTTCATGC-3\u00b4 as mutation primers, respectively. The culture supernatants of transfected COS7 cells were collected and recombinant ACE was purified by anti-FLAG M2-agarose affinity column (Sigma) and TSK gel 3000SW (Tosoh). In this study, we also used the somatic isoform of ACE (ACE-S) from rabbit lung (Sigma A-6778). The ACE peptidase activity was measured as described previously 43 . We measured both GPIase and peptidase activities of recombinant proteins and ACE-S three times independently and obtained similar results. in the sperm of wild-type and Ace knockout mice detected by immunoblotting. The acrosin and fertilin-\u03b2 are indicated for water-soluble and detergent-soluble fraction controls, respectively. +/+, wild-type; -/-, Ace knockout. DS, detergentsoluble fraction; WS, water-soluble fraction. (b) Binding of Ace-knockout sperm to the zona pellucida after various treatments. The amount of Ace used for treatment was equivalent to the endogenous ACE activity. (c) Number of sperm bound to the egg. Values are mean \u00b1 s.e.m. *P < 0.001, **P < 0.005, compared with buffer control; P < 0.3, comparison of wild-type ACE with ACE-E414D; P < 0.5, comparison of wild-type ACE with PI-PLC; P < 0.05, comparison of PI-PLC with PI-PLC + Inositol-P (Student's t-test). a b c",
