Furthermore, the Japanese Society of Pediatric Pulmonology and Japanese Society for Pediatric Infectious Diseases announced the \"Guidelines for the Management of Respiratory Infectious Diseases in Children in Japan\". Internationally, many guidelines, including those established by the American Thoracic Society and Infectious Diseases Society of America, have been published from various countries. Thereafter, clinical research on respiratory infectious diseases has advanced, leading to the accumulation of many outcomes regarding epidemiology, clinical diagnosis, and treatment. However, the types of microorganisms that cause respiratory infectious diseases have increased with the number of resistant bacteria. In addition, conditions have also varied with causative microorganisms through the recent compromised host's severe status. The place of treatment varies: from the outpatient clinic to the ICU. Physicians responsible for treatment also vary: practitioners, hospital doctors, pulmonologists, emergency physicians, board certified member of JAID, Japanese antimicrobial chemotherapy physician. There are a large number of options of antimicrobial drugs that are available, including new drugs; therapeutic strategies are confused. On the other hand, recently, the entity of PK-PD has been commonly recognized, and the importance of scientifically using antimicrobial drugs has been emphasized. In addition, the Japanese Society of Chemotherapy established a system for antimicrobial chemotherapy-certified physicians, and promoted the widespread, adequate use of antimicrobial drugs. Based on these, the two societies prepared the JAID/JSC Guidelines for the Treatment of Respiratory Infectious Diseases. If specific treatment guidelines can be presented, this may contribute to an improvement in the treatment responses of respiratory infectious diseases, a reduction in health expenditure, and the prevention of resistant bacteria.",

To prepare the guidelines, a committee was established in 2012, and a draft was published on homepage based on an approval from the boards of directors at the two societies through a review-based consensus. Opinions were collected from the two societies' members. In Japan, there have been no such guidelines covering respiratory infectious diseases. In the future, with further advances in research, the contents of the guidelines must be revised. However, we successfully provided treatment guidelines that are the most advanced at present.",

[71] , Polymicrobial infection does not always require the prompt antimicrobial therapy that covers anaerobes.

Furthermore, there are many opportunities to undergo antimicrobial drug therapy that affects the indigenous microflora. For such reasons, gram-negative bacillus (enteric bacteria or P. aeruginosa) frequently colonize within the oropharyngeal region of the elderly patients or long-term bedbound patients, many of whom need airway suctioning or have tracheostomy that may serve as portal of entry of environmental pathogen. Oropharyngeal microflora primarily consisting of these gram-negative bacteria can be aspirated into the airway after surgery requiring sedation or anesthesia, or during or after endoscopic examination [57, 72, 73] . Briefly, anaerobes may be an occasional pathoen in polymicrobial infection as seen on Gram staining of patients with suspected aspiration pneumonia, but S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, S. aureus, Klebsiella spp., P. aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter spp. are more commonly involved in many cases, being similar to the microorganisms that are thought to be the major pathogen of hospital-acquired pneumonia. This is in contrast with the community-onset aspiration pneumonia, represented by lung abscess, in that anaerobes are primarily involved [67, 71] .",

            "text": "In the treatment of hospital-acquired pneumonia, the duration of antimicrobial therapy generally tends to be longer than required for the following reasons: opacity on chest X-ray often remains for reasons other than pneumonia even after the start of antimicrobial drug treatment; and there may be a large number of latent nonpneumonia (or non-infectious-disease) factors that may cause increase in body temperature or CRP level in inpatients [75] . However, if appropriate antimicrobial drug treatment is performed, it is possible to complete treatment in 1 week [57] . In strains such as Enterobacter spp., Serratia spp., Citrobacter spp., and Morganella spp. (Table 5 GNR b ), the expression of intrinsic antimicrobial-drugresistance genes encoded in chromosome genes is induced during antimicrobial drug treatment, a phenomenon which is basically rarely seen in E. coli, Klebsiella spp., H. influenzae, and M. catarrhalis (Table 5 GNR a ) ( Table 5) [74, 76, 77] . Therefore, if adequately chosen treatment parameters are improved, antimicrobial treatment could be completed with careful follow up of patients' condition. Although it is useful to recognize these pathogens, abbreviated as SPACE (Serratia, Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter, Citrobacter, and Enterobacter), as a representative microorganism group that causes hospital-acquired pneumonia, the SPACE group is essentially a common colonizer. Therefore it is important to bear in mind that antimicrobial drug is not always indicated upon the isolation of SPACE to avoid selection of antimicrobial resistant bacteria related to unnecessary or long-term antimicrobial therapy [65, 67] . LZD should be selected [78, 79] (AI). The therapeutic efficacy of LZD is similar to those of glycopeptides [50, 80] . The penetration of LZD into the alveolar epitheliumlining fluid and intra-alveolar sputum is more favorable. Therefore, use of LZD should be encouraged in cases of restricted sputum expectoration, such as VAP [51] (BII). Exclusive use of a single drug may accelerate the acquisition of resistance to the agent [81e83] (CI). As DAP is inactivated by pulmonary surfactants, its use should be avoided for MRSA pneumonia. -Glycopeptides should be selected as first-line drug for pneumonia caused by Corynebacterium sp [84] (AII).",

Several studies reported that the overall clinical efficacy of LZD, including the incidence of side effects, was superior to VCM in patients with hospital-acquired pneumonia caused by MRSA [85, 86] . However, since the dosing of VCM in these studies have been considered suboptimal, further study is needed [51, 87] . Some investigators have recommended that, when MRSA is susceptible to CLDM or MINO on a susceptibility test, LZD, a protein synthesis inhibitor should be administered given the possible involvement of the Panton-Valentine leukocidin [78, 88] . If a prompt improvement is achieved by the intravenous drip of LZD 600 mg q12h, or if the patient's condition is not critical, switch from the intravenous administration to an oral preparation of LZD, which shows high bioavailability [89] , is encouraged. As DAP is inactivated by pulmonary surfactants, it should not be used to treat MRSA pneumonia. This may not apply to the treatment of septic pulmonary embolism [90] .",

Even when pneumonia is not severe, the host's activities of daily living (ADL) and an underlying disease/immunodeficiency reduce the prognosis in many cases [98] . As this type of pneumonia develops in a variety of uneven populations, it is difficult to simply determine severity classification. Therefore, considering various conditions, the entity of \"treatment category\", involving the ethical aspects of geriatric care, was introduced based on evaluation by the attending physician who knows the patient well ( Fig. 1 ). Frequent basic conditions or concomitant diseases for NHCAP in Japan include an advanced age, central nervous diseases, aspiration, a reduction in ADL, and tubal feeding. Their factors are aspiration pneumonia itself or risk factors, and HCAP in Japan may overlap with aspiration pneumonia [99] . On the other hand, in NHCAP patients, MRSA, P. aeruginosa, and anaerobes are more frequently isolated in comparison with CAP patients. It is necessary to switch therapeutic strategies, considering these causative microorganisms. Refer to the next section \"2.4 Aspiration pneumonia\" (p. 19 ).",

The results suggested that Chlamydophila spp. is a target of treatment, as described for CAP. Therefore, in Group A, combination therapy with a b-lactam and macrolide or monotherapy with a respiratory quinolone should be performed (BII). In Group D, an anti-P. aeruginosa drug should be combined with CPFX, PZFX, or AZM for injection, considering Legionella or Chlamydophila spp. pneumonia. However, concerning combination therapy with a macrolide (CII) in patients without \"severe pneumonia requiring intensive care\", as described below, the evidence level is not always high from the perspectives of medical economics, side effects, and resistant bacteria [106] . Some studies examined the mortality rate with respect to the presence or absence of treatment covering atypical pathogens, and reported that the mortality rate was significantly lower in the presence of such treatment [17] .

Furthermore, the prevalence of penicillinresistant Pneumococcus, which has been internationally emphasized as an issue, and macrolide-resistant Pneumococcus, which has been markedly observed in Japan, was also a background factor for establishing respiratory quinolones as an option [109] . The previous use of antimicrobial drugs, which is often observed in patients with NHCAP, is considered to be a risk factor for resistant Pneumococcus [110] . A study reported that penicillin or EM resistance in HCAP patients was more advanced than in CAP patients [100] . A study indicated that the efficacy of oral therapy with LVFX was similar to that of CTRX injection therapy in 619 patients with CAP [111] . Another study reported that, among 680 patients with non-severe HCAP, oral LVFX was useful in those with no description of causative microorganisms [112] . However, when aspiration pneumonia is suspected, GRNX or MFLX should be selected, because the effects of LVFX on anaerobes are weak. Furthermore, several studies suggested the usefulness of MFLX, which is not influenced by the kidney function and does not require dose regulation, in elderly patients with NHCAP [113, 114] .",

A study reported that initial treatment with narrow-spectrum antimicrobial drugs did not always lead to a poor prognosis [119] . In particular, according to two articles [120, 121] , it is not necessary to consider resistant bacteria in HCAP patients in whom causative microorganisms are unclear; treatment in accordance with CAP treatment is sufficient (BII). However, an advanced age, central nervous diseases, aspiration, and a reduction in ADL are the clinical characteristics of aspiration pneumonia. The condition of NHCAP in Japan overlaps with aspiration pneumonia [122] . Therefore, in Group B, to which patients admitted for the first time, with no recent use of antimicrobial drugs, correspond, antimicrobial therapy with b-lactamase inhibitor-containing penicillins is appropriate, as described for CAP. However, when aspiration pneumonia is suspected, CTRX and LVFX should be avoided (BIV). For the management of enteric bacteria, candidate drugs for Group B, PAPM/BP, may be selected. Actually, it is not necessary to consider P. aeruginosa in patients with CAP or non-ICU HAP. A study indicated that ertapenem, which is not effective for P. aeruginosa, was useful [123] , as demonstrated for PAPM/BP. However, another study reported that the widespread use of ertapenem induced the cross resistance of P. aeruginosa to other carbapenems; the use of PAPM/BP alone should be avoided [124] (BIV). In elderly persons, with a high risk of aspiration, who are repeatedly admitted and discharged, Klebsiella is often involved. TAZ/PIPC is more useful according to a study [125] (BII). In patients in whom Gram-negative bacillus is detected on Gram staining of sputum or those in whom the involvement of enteric bacteria is suspected, PAPM/BP or TAZ/PIPC should be selected (BIV).",

As the antimicrobial activities of fourth-generation cephems and quinolones against anaerobes are weak, these drugs should be combined with MNZ, CLDM, or SBT/ABPC. Recently, the resistance of the Bacteroides fragilis group to CLDM has advanced [128] . Therefore, in Europe and the United States, MNZ is selected as a first-choice antimicrobial drug against anaerobes. However, the rate at which the B. fragilis group is involved in oral anaerobes is low, and combination therapy with CLDM may be selected [129, 130] . Therefore, for combination therapy with fourth-generation cephems, we recommend the two drugs. When there is a risk of MRSA, such as previous admission, they should be combined with VCM, TEIC, or LZD. If there is no abscess formation, ABK is also effective.

In elderly persons admitted to long-term care beds or nursing homes, risk factors include dysphagia and tubal feeding according to international data on pneumonia that develops in nursing homes [137e139]. In Japan, frequent underlying diseases in patients with NHCAP also include central nervous diseases and dementia, which are closely associated with aspiration. The proportion of patients after percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) is high [140] . However, among various types of community-acquired pneumonia, a diagnosis of aspiration pneumonia is made based on onset factor-based classification, and is not equal to NHCAP diagnosed primarily based on the place of onset or grade of nursing. According to data in Spain, aspiration pneumonia accounts for 20.6% of patients with healthcareassociated pneumonia (HCAP) requiring admission. This percentage was markedly higher than in those with communityacquired pneumonia (CAP) requiring admission (3.6%), but corresponded to no more than 1/5 [100] . On the other hand, a multicenter cooperative study involving inpatients with pneumonia in Japan, where the rapid aging of society is advanced, reported that 60.1% of patients who were admitted with CAP had aspiration pneumonia. Even in patients with CAP, which is not classified as NHCAP, the involvement of aspiration cannot be ignored [141] . Furthermore, the study indicated the involvement of aspiration in 86.7% of patients, aged over 70 years, with CAP/ HAP [141] . In the future, the significance of distinguishing aspiration pneumonia among patients with NHCAP or HAP and changing therapeutic strategies should be examined. However, NHCAP more markedly affects ADL compared to CAP, and the aspect of elderly pneumonia is emphasized; it may be significant to positively diagnose aspiration pneumonia and establish therapeutic strategies different from those for CAP [142] .",

Three studies reported that, in a group in which TAZ/PIPC was selected as a drug to be combined with aminoglycosides for VAP treatment, the mortality rate was lower than in a group in which CAZ was selected [159e161]. In particular, when pneumonia was caused by P. aeruginosa, the clinical effects of TAZ/PIPC were more potent than those of IPM/CS (BII). For monotherapy, information on the culture of protected specimen brush (PSB) samples or broncho-alveolar lavage (BAL) fluid is strongly recommended [70, 162] . On the other hand, an observational study indicated that threedrug therapy (two anti-P. aeruginosa drugs \u00fe an anti-MRSA drug) deteriorated the prognosis; an RCT should be conducted in the future [60] . Therefore, if there is a risk of resistant bacteria, at least broad-spectrum antimicrobial drugs must be used for empiric therapy. However, assuming causative microorganisms with reference to Gram staining reactions, minimum necessary antimicrobial drugs should be selected based on local factors (antimicrobial drug susceptibility pattern of each type of bacteria in each hospital). Recently, the entity of ventilator-associated tracheobronchitis (VAT) was proposed, and the disadvantages of aggressive treatment have been discussed [163] . In a multicenter cooperative study, patients with VAT, which occurred in the ICU, were divided into two groups with and without antimicrobial drug therapy, and the results were compared. In the former, the incidence of VAP was significantly lower, and the mechanical ventilation-free period was significantly longer. In addition, the ICU mortality rate was significantly lower. On the other hand, there was no significant difference in the appearance of resistant bacteria between the two groups [164] .

Patients with a peripheral blood absolute neutrophil count (ANC) of <500/mL or those in whom the ANC is estimated to reach <500/mL within 48 h are regarded as having neutropenia [215] . Of these, the risk is higher in patients with an ANC of 100/mL or less in whom the period is estimated to exceed 7 days. Many patients with neutropenia do not show purulent sputum or abnormal findings on chest X-ray even in the presence of pneumonia. Therefore, when fever persists, thoracic CT should be performed in the early stage. All microorganisms including general bacteria (gram-positive bacteria, gramnegative bacteria), fungus, and viruses may cause pneumonia. In particular, in addition to neutropenia early after homologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, infection-prone features associated with humoral/cellular immunodeficiency related to the administration of immunosuppressives persist over a long period. Furthermore, the concomitant development of acute/chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is a risk factor for the onset of pneumonia. In addition, non-infectious pulmonary disorder related to drugs/radiation for pretreatment may occur, and it is important to differentiate it from infectious diseases (Fig. 9 ) [214, 216] .",

In this article, this name is also used. -The secondary assessment of a study examining the efficacy of rifapentine and INH showed that factors for unsuccessful treatment/recurrence included a cavity on chest X-ray at the start of treatment and positive findings on culture at the completion of initial treatment for 2 months [256] . Similarly, when the treatment period was extended from 6 to 8 months in patients with silicotuberculosis, in whom the unsuccessful treatment/recurrence rates are high, the recurrence rate decreased from 22 to 7%. Therefore, various guidelines recommend that maintenance treatment should be prolonged over 3 months in patients with a cavity and those showing positive findings on septum culture at the completion of initial treatment [254, 255] . -In 1990, Combs et al. compared the results of treatment between a group treated with INH, RFP, and PZA for 2 months and, then, with INH and RFP for 4 months and that treated with INH and RFP for 9 months, and reported that the efficacy and incidence of side effects were similar [257] . Based on such a study, the following regimen is recommended as standard treatment (B) in the Guidelines for the Management of Tuberculosis in 2012 in Japan: when PZA cannot be used for some reason, INH, RFP, and EB or SM, are administered for the first 2 months, and, subsequently, two drugs, INH and RFP, are administered for 7 months. -Patients who are infected with M. tuberculosis, but do not develop tuberculosis are regarded as having latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI). INH administration for LTBI decreases the incidence of tuberculosis by 25e92% [258] . Previously, this was called preventive therapy, but is currently termed LTBI treatment. The decrease in the incidence of tuberculosis is correlated with compliance with INH, and more marked preventive effects may be achieved when compliance is higher [258e260]. In a study involving INH administration to LTBI patients with an old shadow on chest X-ray, this therapy inhibited the onset of tuberculosis in 65 and 75% of patients treated for 6 and 12 months, respectively (there was no significant difference between the two groups) [261] . Based on the data, some studies recommended that the period of standard INH administration for LTBI should be 9 months [262e264]. However, a consensus regarding an effective administration period (6 or 9 months) has not been reached from various aspects including the efficacy, compliance, expenses, and incidence of side effects. Actually, the administration period should be determined based on compliance and the incidence of side effects. -In LTBI treatment, RFP should be used for 4 or 6 months as an alternative drug when the oral administration of INH is impossible for some reason. The preventive effects of RFP on the onset of tuberculosis in LTBI patients may be similar to those of INH. Furthermore, the incidence of liver dysfunction is lower than that related to INH [265e267]. However, for the use of RFP, drug interactions must be considered.",

[269] . In Japan, Tanaka et al. conducted combination therapy with CAM (10 mg/kg) and EB/RFP/KM in 39 patients, and indicated that 89.5% of those who underwent initial treatment became negative for MAC [270] . Concerning CAM, many studies have reported a correlation between the in vitro drug susceptibility and treatment response [271e273]. Furthermore, a study indicated that AZM was as effective as CAM [274] . -RBT, which was published in the drug price in NHI scheme in Japan in 2008, was also approved for tuberculosis and non-tuberculous Mycobacterium infection, including pulmonary MAC infection. The drug interactions of RBT are less marked than those of RFP, and RBT is used as a first-choice drug for disseminated MAC infection in HIV-infected patients [275] . On the other hand, RBT induces side effects such as uveitis. In elderly patients, in whom pulmonary MAC infection frequently develops, various side effects, such as gastrointestinal disorder, make long-term therapy difficult [276] . In addition, no study has indicated that RBT is more effective than RFP for pulmonary MAC infection in non-HIV-infected patients. Therefore, RFP should be selected as a first-choice drug for pulmonary MAC infection in non-HIV-infected patients. -Kobashi et al. divided 146 patients with pulmonary MAC infection into two groups: a group treated with CAM, RFP, EB, and SM (intramuscularly injected at 15 mg/kg 3 times a week for 3 months) and a group treated with saline, and conducted a randomized, double-blind, comparative study [277] . In the SM-treated group, the rate at which the culture of sputum became negative was higher than in the salinetreated group (71.2 vs. 50.7%, respectively). There has been no high-quality study demonstrating the usefulness of combination therapy with aminoglycosides other than their study. However, various guidelines recommend that combination therapy with SM, AMK, or KM should be performed for 2e3 months in the initial phase of treatment in patients with a cavity or severe nodular/bronchodilatation type infection based on experience [276, 278, 279] . Guidelines in the United States recommend SM or AMK, and comment that no study has showed which of two drugs, SM and AMK, is more effective, although SM has been more frequently used [276] . In Japan, SM or KM is recommended [279] . -Based on the results of these studies, the Non-tuberculous Mycobacterium Infection Control Committee, Japanese Society for Tuberculosis recommends the following doses and administration methods for chemotherapy for pulmonary MAC infection in the \"Opinions regarding Chemotherapy for Pulmonary Non-tuberculous Mycobacterium Infection---Revision in 2012\": RFP: 10 mg/kg (up to 600 mg)/day, once a day, EB: 15 mg/kg (up to 750 mg)/day, once a day, CAM: 600e800 mg/day (15e20 mg/kg), once a day or two divided doses (800 mg: two divided doses), and SM or KM: 15 mg/kg or less (up to 1000 mg), intramuscularly injected 2 or 3 times a week [279] . -A cooperative statement on non-tuberculous Mycobacterium infection by the American Thoracic Society/Infectious Diseases Society of America recommends therapy with CAM at 500 to 1000 mg/day or AZM at 250 mg/day, EB at 15 mg/kg/day, and RFP at 10 mg/kg/day (up to 600 mg) for patients with a cavity or severe nodular/bronchodilatation type infection. In addition, it is recommended that combination therapy with SM or AMK (8e10 mg/kg, 2e3 times a week, patients aged over 50 years: 500 mg or less) for 2e3 months in the initial phase should be considered [276, 280] . -The treatment period is established as about 1 year after the culture becomes negative in the above guidelines, but this is not based on evidence. In the Guidelines for the Management of Non-tuberculous Mycobacterium Infection, which were published by the British Thoracic Society, the treatment period of pulmonary MAC infection is established as 2 years. In the future, an optimal treatment period should be investigated.",

Although some studies reported combination therapy with LZD or quinolones, its efficacy has not been established. -Based on such a background, a combination of surgical resection of the lesion and combination chemotherapy is the only treatment that is expected to achieve the complete cure of pulmonary infection with M. abscessus in which the lesion is localized [284, 288, 289] .",

When encountering patients with chronic infection who do not respond to general antimicrobial drugs, tuberculosis should be considered for differential diagnosis. Mycobacteria that can be cultured are classified into two types: M. tuberculosis complex and non-tuberculous Mycobacteria (NTM) [247] . M. tuberculosis is a major type of M. tuberculosis complex, and has a strong infectivity from humans to humans. Childhood tuberculosis is classified into two types based on age [247] . Briefly, primary tuberculosis represented by hilar lymph node tuberculosis and meningitis, which develop following primary infection, is characteristic of infants and children. The interval from infection until onset is short, and the morbidity rate is high. In addition, this disease may lead to a severe condition. Pulmonary/hilar lymph node tuberculosis in infants and children is asymptomatic, or the general condition is favorable even in the presence of fever or cough in many cases. When primary tuberculosis is detected based on dyspnea or an unfavorable general condition in addition to fever or cough, many infants/children have military tuberculosis or meningitis. On the other hand, secondary tuberculosis with a cavity lesion or nodular shadow in the lung field is frequent in junior high school students or older. Symptoms such as cough, sputum, fever, and thoracic pain are often observed. In most children, the source of infection can be clarified through detailed peripheral contact screening at the time of onset. Usually, the source of infection is clarified in 2/3 to 3/4 of children. It is often their fathers/mothers or grandfathers/grandmothers [290e292].",

In many cases, it is difficult to bacteriologically or histologically make a definitive diagnosis in comparison with adult tuberculosis. Usually, it is possible to make a definitive diagnosis by comprehensively evaluating epidemiological/clinical information such as opportunities for the source of infection to contact with tuberculosis patients, tuberculin reaction-or QuantiFERON TB (QFT)-based verification of infection, imaging findings suggestive of tuberculosis, such as chest X-ray findings, verification of M. tuberculosis from sputum or gastric juice, and individuals' resistance including the grade of BCG vaccination-acquired immunity and age, as well as by considering treatment responses in some cases. QFT is a very useful testing method to quantitatively measure IFN-g and diagnose tuberculosis infection without being influenced by BCG. However, assessment in infants/children should be further examined in the future [293] . When a definitive diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis cannot be made based on chest X-ray findings alone, thoracic CT, which facilitates the detailed evaluation of the presence or absence and extent of tuberculous lesions, is useful for diagnosis. Furthermore, imaging findings of tuberculosis do not change in a short period in many cases.",

Therefore, it is often detected as a Mycobacterium-positive smear of sputum, that is, Gaffky's positive reaction. Initially, some patients are regarded as having infectious tuberculosis, and admitted to a tuberculosis ward. Symptoms and imaging findings are also similar between nontuberculous Mycobacterium-and M. tuberculosis-infected patients. Unless detected bacteria are identified, or unless either gene is detected using the nucleic acid amplification method, it is difficult to differentiate the two types of bacteria. However, it is important to recognize that tuberculosis and non-tuberculous Mycobacterium infection are different diseases [276, 294] . The most important point is that non-tuberculous Mycobacterium infection does not transmit from humans to humans, differing from tuberculosis, an infectious disease in humans. Therefore, it is not necessary to isolate the patient, and, as a rule, patients requiring admission should be managed in a general ward.

A large-scale controlled study reported that INH therapy decreased the incidence of tuberculosis by approximately 50e60%. For drug administration, the risk of tuberculosis onset should be concretely and flexibly evaluated based on the tuberculin reaction, opportunity of infection, age, and state of BCG vaccination in individual patients [247] . -Treatment for non-tuberculous Mycobacterium infection: Nontuberculous Mycobacterium infection is refractory despite combination therapy with antitubercular drugs.

In patients with B. pertussis-related bronchitis, antimicrobial drugs relieve symptoms only during the catarrhal period, but, if B. pertussis-related bronchitis is suspected based on clinical symptoms, previous vaccination, lymphocyte-predominant leukocytosis, an anti-PT antibody titer, and LAMP findings, antimicrobial drugs should be used.

The worms may migrate through mediastinal soft tissues to the brain, causing eosinophilic meningitis or cerebral paragonimiasis in some cases [397] . Since Paragonimus spp. is widely distributed around the world, Japanese travel to endemic area such as China, Korea, Thailand, and Philippines possible to infect with Paragonimus spp. As well as foreign patients from endemic areas, this disease always is considered when a patient has respiratory symptoms and/or lung lesions with eosinophilia [398] . Chest X-ray findings vary: not only pulmonary parenchymal lesions, such as nodular (\u00b1cavity formation) and infiltrative shadows, but also pleural lesions, such as the retention of pleural effusion and pneumothorax, are sometimes observed [399] . Many patients show peripheral blood eosinophilia and/or elevated serum total IgE. Immunodiagnosis to detect parasite-specific antibody has been proven as the most useful and reliable tool. Not only patient's serum but also pleural effusion could examine by immunological test. Commercially available anti-parasite antibody screening test is including Paragomimus spp. In Japan, egg-detection rate among paragonimiasis patients nowadays is low; for example 51.2% in sputum and 53.8% in BALF [66] , 66.7% in bronchoscopic aspirate [397, 399] .",

This condition shows a chronic course, differing from simple pulmonary eosinophilia. Cough, dyspnea, and stridor with exacerbation at night are observed. Fever, malaise, and weight loss are noted in some patients. On chest X-ray, bilateral reticular nodular lesions are detected. Peripheral blood eosinophilia and an increase in the anti-filaria antibody titer are observed. In case of TPE, no microfilaria is detected [403] . If treatment is not performed, the condition may gradually exacerbate. It is important to adequately make a diagnosis for the differentiation of this disease. In the world, 130,000,000 persons are infected with lymphatic filaria, but TPE occurs in less than 0.5% of these. The risk of this disease in travelers is unclear, and most patients consist of foreign persons from endemic areas [412] .",

Therefore, a half dose (1 mg/kg) should be administered 3 times a day for 12 days [413] . -D. immitis D. immitis parasitize in the dog right ventricle and pulmonary artery, where mature female worms produce microfilaria that circulate in peripheral blood. Infection to humans is mediated by microfilaria-ingesting mosquitoes. D. immitis larvae in human subcutaneous tissue inserted by mosquito bite, some larvae migrate to the heart and die. Dead worms produce infarcts then they lodge in pulmonary vessels. There are few symptoms [402] . In patients with symptoms, thoracic pain, cough, bloody sputum, stridor, and fever have been reported. Typical chest X-ray findings include solitary coin lesions. In many cases, an abnormal shadow of the chest X-ray is indicated on a health checkup, and D. immitis infection is pathologically diagnosed from a tissue specimen extirpated under a tentative diagnosis of lung cancer. At this point, peripheral blood eosinophilia is rarely observed [403] .",

The symptoms of this disease are more marked than those of primary pulmonary cryptococcosis: fever, general malaise, cough, sputum, bloody sputum, dyspnea, and thoracic pain. -Laboratory findings: Chest X-ray and CT show solitary or multiple nodular and infiltrative shadows. Cavitary lesions are observed in a lot of cases. Cryptococcus glucuronoxylomannan antigen-positive reactions are detected. -Causative microorganisms: This disease is caused by C. neoformans. -Specific condition: If this disease develops in AIDS patients, it may deteriorate to a systemic infectious disease in the early stage, particularly causing meningoencephalitis. Therefore, treatment in accordance with Cryptococcus encephalomeningitis should be performed.---Drugs to be recommended---Pulmonary cryptococcosis in the host with an underlying disease more frequently leads to a severe condition compared to primary pulmonary cryptococcosis.

Three major signs consist of fever, dry cough, and dyspnea. The mode of PCP onset in HIV-infected patients is slower than in non-HIVinfected patients. In the former, fever and hypoxemia are relatively mild, and the mortality rate is low. -Laboratory findings: Typical chest X-ray and CT findings include a diffuse, ground glass opacity extending from the pulmonary hilum to the bilateral sides. On CT, a ground glass opacity expanding like a map is observed in some cases. In addition, various shadows such as multiple nodes/cysts are detected.
