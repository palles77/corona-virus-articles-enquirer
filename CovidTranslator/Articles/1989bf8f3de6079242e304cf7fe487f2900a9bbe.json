However, evidence exists of potential community spread, with the virus spreading easily and sustainably in the community in some affected geographic areas such as China. 4 A case has also been reported in the USA in which the individual had not been exposed to anyone known to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 and had not travelled to countries in which the virus is circulating. 5 Potential enteric transmission also has implications for those working with human waste and wastewater, for whom WHO guidance has been developed specifically in relation to COVID-19. Overall, the provision of safe water, sanitation, and hygienic conditions can offer protection from any infectious disease, including COVID-19.",

But environmental surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 could serve as a data source, indicating if the virus is circulating in the human population. Previously, this tool has been successfully applied for preclinical identification of Aichi virus. 6 The possibility of faecal-oral transmission of COVID-19 has implications, especially in areas with poor sanitation where diagnostic capacity might be limited, such as Africa. Wastewater surveillance, especially in areas with a scarcity of data, might be informative, as we have previously shown in monitoring antibiotic resistance on a global scale. 7 AMdRH ",
