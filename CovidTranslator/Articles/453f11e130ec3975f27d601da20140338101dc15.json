This has been a perennial challenge as type I FCoV strains do not easily adapt to cell culture. Here we characterize replication kinetics and plaque formation of a model type I strain FIPV Black in Fcwf-4 cells established at Cornell University (Fcwf-4 CU). We determined that maximum virus titers (> 10 7 pfu/mL) were recoverable from infected Fcwf-4 CU cellfree supernatant at 20 h post-infection. Type I FIPV Black and both biotypes of type II FCoV formed uniform and enumerable plaques on Fcwf-4 CU cells. Therefore, these cells were employable in a standardized plaque assay. Finally, we determined that the Fcwf-4 CU cells were morphologically distinct from feline bone marrow-derived macrophages and were less sensitive to exogenous type I interferon than were Fcwf-4 cells purchased from ATCC. 1991; Pedersen et al., 1984) , but a recent study proposes a more https://doi.",

FCoV infection is widespread among domestic feline populations, especially within multicat households and catteries, which can exhibit upwards of 96% seropositivity (Addie et al., 2003; Addie and Jarrett, 1992; Hohdatsu et al., 1992; Pedersen, 2009 Pedersen, , 1976 Vennema et al., 1998) . Despite the global burden of FCoV infection, there are no currently approved therapeutics to treat FIP; however, reports of direct inhibition of virus growth and treatment of individual cats using small molecule viral inhibitors have been promising (Kim et al., 2016 (Kim et al., , 2015 (Kim et al., , 2013 (Kim et al., , 2012 Murphy et al., 2018; Pedersen et al., 2017; St John et al., 2015) .",

            "text": "FCoVs are typically grouped into two biotypes (or pathotypes), which have been classified as feline enteric coronavirus (FECV) and feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV), based on tissue tropism, disease progression, and genetic markers (reviewed in Kipar and Meli, 2014; Pedersen, 2014 Pedersen, , 2009 , although the range of disease signs and clinical outcomes are likely to extend beyond these two basic definitions. Endemic FECV causes mild enteritis associated with loose stool and diarrhea and commonly leads to an asymptomatic, persistent infection (Addie, 2011; Addie et al., 2003; Pedersen et al., 2008) . A subset of these infections (3-10%) result in lethal FIP (Addie and Jarrett, 1992; Pedersen, 1976) arising from a shift in virus tropism and systemic infection of monocytes and macrophages. Perturbations of the host feline immune state leading to immune deficiency can allow virus replication to surge (Pedersen, 2009; Tekes and Thiel, 2016) , resulting in the formation of a quasispecies and the genetic sampling required for progression of FECV to the second biotype, FIPV. The internal mutation theory proposes that, within an individual animal, FIPV arises directly from FECV due to accumulation of non-synonymous mutations in spike (S) (Licitra et al., 2014 (Licitra et al., , 2013 Rottier et al., 2005) and group-specific proteins (Chang et al., 2010; Herrewegh et al., 1995; Lin et al., 2009; Pedersen et al., 2012; Phillips et al., 2013; Poland et al., 1996; Vennema et al., 1998) . The resulting infection of monocytes and macrophages by FIPV leads to systemic spread and development of immune-mediated FIP (Pedersen, 2009) .",

Type I viruses account for the bulk (80-90%) of natural infections in domestic cats, while type II FCoV, a naturally-occurring recombinant between the type I and canine coronavirus (CCoV) spike proteins (Herrewegh et al., 1998) , is far less prevalent (< 10%) (Addie et al., 2003; Benetka et al., 2004; Hohdatsu et al., 1992; Kennedy et al., 2002) . A commendable number of studies focus on type II FCoV as these viruses are much more easily propagated in cell culture.

            "text": "It is critical that we investigate type I FIPV in laboratory cell culture in order to understand the basic virology of natural infection, characterize type I clinical isolates, test novel therapeutics, and develop effective feline vaccines with broader coverage. However, this has been challenging because type I FCoVs cannot be easily adapted to laboratory cell culture; furthermore, the receptor for type I is not known (Cham et al., 2017; Dye et al., 2007; Hohdatsu et al., 1998) , making the identification of highly permissive cell types difficult. Select type I isolates, such as the FIPV Black strain used in this study, have been adapted to growth in tissue culture at the cost of reduced in vivo virulence (Black, 1980; Pedersen, 2009; Tekes et al., 2007; Thiel et al., 2014) . Feline airway epithelial (AK-D) cells propagate FIPV Black (Regan et al., 2012) ; however, these cells do not represent natural tropism for FIPV. Felis catus whole fetus 4 (Fcwf-4) cells are a more physiologically-relevant feline macrophage-like cell line (Jacobse-Geels and Horzinek, 1983), but these cells come with several technical drawbacks for studying type I FIPV. First, Fcwf-4 cell doubling time is slow (> 31 h) (American Type Culture Collection, 2013) and cells do not grow to high density. Second, previous studies report that type I FIPV grows to low titers (< 10 5 pfu/mL) in these cells relative to type II (> 10 6 pfu/mL) (Tekes et al., 2012) and can be measured by determining the 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID 50 ) (Ramakrishnan, 2016; Reed and Muench, 1938) or by plaque assay (Tekes et al., 2012 (Tekes et al., , 2010 . Third, type I virus kinetics are variable in Fcwf-4 cells, requiring between 15 and 72 h to achieve maximum titer (Jacobse-Geels and Horzinek, 1983; Tekes et al., 2012 Tekes et al., , 2007 This Study) . Finally, some reports suggest that type I is highly cell-associated (Jacobse-Geels and Horzinek, 1983; Pedersen et al., 1984) and multiple freeze-thaw cycles may be required to recover virus. Together, these factors have made investigation of type I FIPV challenging.",

We found that an Fcwf-4 cell line established at Cornell University College of Veterinary Medicine, designated Fcwf-4 CU, propagates type I FIPV to significantly higher titers in cell-free supernatant and with more rapid kinetics compared to commercially available Fcwf-4 cells.

Surprisingly, the cell-free virus titers were higher than the cell-associated titers at all time points and in all cell types assayed (Fig. 1B) .

FIPV Black formed large, uniform syncytia in Fcwf-4 CU cells, while individual cell-death-induced clearings were observed in infected AK-D cells ( Fig. 2A ). Of note, maximum titers from both cell types were obtained just prior to the appearance of major CPE, allowing a visual guide to virus collection. To further demonstrate this point, Fcwf-4 CU and AK-D cells infected with FIPV Black were labeled with an anti-nucleocapsid antibody (CCV2-2) (Poncelet et al., 2008) and visualized by immunofluorescence prior to the induction of major observable CPE. As expected, the majority of cells were positive for virus antigen (Fig. 2B ) and the differences in CPE are clearly shown: note the syncytial membrane fusion in infected Fcwf-4 CU cells and the maintenance of distinct cell membranes in infected AK-D cells (Fig. 2B) . Together, these results demonstrate the ability of the Fcwf-4 CU cells to rapidly produce high levels of type I FIPV Black in cell-free supernatants.",

To this end, we calculated the endpoint titer and compared the size, uniformity, and timing of virus plaque development over time in AK-D, Fcwf-4 ATCC, and Fcwf-4 CU cells following infection with 10-fold dilutions of the same FIPV Black virus stock initially grown on Fcwf-4 CU cells. A detailed description of the plaque assay is provided in the Materials and Methods; we note here that Oxoid agar is critical for visualizing clear plaques. At 2 days post-infection (dpi), FIPV Black formed enumerable plaques on both AK-D and Fcwf-4 CU cells with the latter cells producing more numerous and larger plaques at higher dilutions (Fig. 3 top) . Plaques were not observed in Fcwf-4 ATCC cells at 2 dpi (Fig. 3 top) . Plaques were detected at 3 dpi (Fig. 3 middle) ; and were more clear at 4 dpi in Fcwf-4 ATCC cells (Fig. 3 bottom) . Calculated titers overall were higher in Fcwf-4 CU (> 10 7 pfu/mL) than in AK-D cells (\u226510 6 pfu/mL); however, we report that both cell types are useful for determining virus titer, whereas the Fcwf-4 ATCC cells are not ideal for use in this assay.",

            "text": "The apparent differences in production and kinetics of FIPV Black virus in two Fcwf-4 cell lines led us to ask if there are morphologic or functional differences between the two cell types. To answer this question, we first compared the single-cell morphologies of Fcwf-4 ATCC, Fcwf-4 CU cells, and primary feline bone marrow-derived macrophages (fBMDMs) by Wright-Giemsa staining. The typical morphologic characteristics of feline macrophages (large cytoplasmic inclusions, a non-dominant nucleus, a non-ruffled cell membrane) (Bienzle et al., 2003) were observed for the fBMDMs (Fig. 4A) . Comparison of the two Fcwf-4 cell lines revealed stark differences in morphology. Fcwf-4 ATCC cells were large with a smooth cell membrane and had large and abundant cytoplasmic inclusions comparable to the fBMDMs (Fig. 4A ). Fcwf-4 CU cells were more similar in size to fBMDMs; however, the Fcwf-4 CU cell line exhibited fewer cytoplasmic inclusions and more cell membrane ruffling (Fig. 4A ) than either the fBMDMs or Fcwf-4 ATCC cells. Neither Fcwf-4 cell line had a \"true\" macrophage morphology further corroborating their original \"macrophage-like\" description (Jacobse-Geels and Horzinek, 1983). As macrophages are innate immune cells that restrict virus replication through production of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) in response to type I IFN, we reasoned that differences in virus replication may be due to variation in cell IFN-responsiveness. Therefore, we asked if Fcwf-4 ATCC and CU cell lines differed in responsiveness to exogenous type I IFN by measuring the resulting ISG54 transcript production following treatment with IFN. Remarkably, Fcwf-4 ATCC cells produced significantly higher ISG54 transcripts in response to IFN stimulation compared to Fcwf-4 CU cells (Fig. 4B) , suggesting that the Fcwf-4 CU cells are much less responsive to IFN. This is not to say, however, that Fcwf-4 CU cells are insensitive to IFN since they also exhibit significant, dose-dependent ISG54 transcript production. Together, these data highlight the distinct morphology of the Fcwf-4 CU cells and suggest that enhanced virus replication in these cells may be due, at least in part, to reduced IFNresponsiveness.",

Fcwf-4 CU cells were infected with type I FIPV Black or one of two type II viruses, FIPV 79-1146 or FECV 79-1683. Cell cytopathic effects were observed over time in these cells, with the viruses all forming similar, large syncytia (Fig. 5A) . Cellfree virus titers were determined at 12 and 24 hpi. All three viruses accumulated to titers > 10 6 pfu/mL in supernatants by 24 hpi (Fig. 5B) , with FIPV 79-1146 reaching the highest titer. The kinetics of the type II viruses were faster than the type I FIPV Black strain, producing higher titers by 12 hpi (Fig. 5B) and inducing more substantial syncytial CPE by 16 hpi (Fig. 5A) . Next, we asked if the Fcwf-4 CU cells could be utilized in a plaque assay for determining the titer of type II FCoV. Indeed, both FIPV 79-1146 and FECV 79-1683 formed clear, uniform, enumerable plaques at 24 hpi (Fig. 5C) . Thus, we have demonstrated that the Fcwf-4 CU cells replicate both FCoV types and biotypes to high titers and are employable in a plaque assay to consistently determine the titers of all viruses assayed.",

However, different groups have reported major variations in the growth kinetics, maximum obtainable titer, and techniques for recovery of this virus from tissue culture (Jacobse-Geels and Horzinek, 1983; Pedersen et al., 1984; Tekes et al., 2012 Tekes et al., , 2007 Thiel et al., 2014) . For example, maximal titers measured by determining the TCID 50 can range between > 10 3 (Jacobse-Geels and Horzinek, 1983) and 10 4 TCID 50 /mL (Takano et al., 2015) at 24-48 hpi, or measured by plaque assay between > 10 4 (36 hpi) (Tekes et al., 2012 (Tekes et al., , 2007 and > 10 7 pfu/mL (20 hpi) (This Report). This suggests either high variability in the Fcwf-4 cell lines used or co-adaptation between a particular virus and Fcwf-4 cell line used during laboratory cultivation. Indeed, we report significant differences in FIPV Black replication properties between an Fcwf-4 cell line that was newly purchased from the ATCC, and the Fcwf-4 cells that were established at Cornell University. The enhanced rate of FIPV Black virus growth and increased maximum titer (> 10 7 pfu/mL by 20 hpi) obtained from infected Fcwf-4 CU cells, however, may not be due to coadaptation with our particular strain of FIPV Black, as these cells also replicated both biotypes of type II viruses. Instead, the Fcwf-4 CU cells may be highly susceptible to FCoV infection in general and therefore may be particularly useful in generating highly-permissive cell types to isolate and grow clinical type I FCoVs. The increased virus infection of Fcwf-4 CU cells could be due to any number of cellular factors; however, it is tempting to speculate that the reduced IFN-responsiveness of the Fcwf-4 CU cells relative to the Fcwf-4 ATCC cells may significantly enhance infection in the former. Further, these Fcwf-4 CU cells may express a higher density of the yet unknown type I virus receptor (Cham et al., 2017; Dye et al., 2007) and therefore may be critical in identifying the receptor or other cellular characteristics that allow for enhanced type I virus replication.",

In contrast, we found significantly higher titers of virus in cell-free supernatants and speculate that multiple freeze-thaw cycles may actually decrease virus titer by damaging the virus envelope. The release of virus into cell supernatants and the uniform CPE observed in AK-D and Fcwf-4 CU cells were critical in establishing a standardized plaque assay using either cell type. Further, we report that the stage of CPE development can be used as an indicator of when maximal virus titers can be recovered. One possible explanation for the varied reports on titer of FIPV Black is that laboratory lines of Fcwf-4 cells have deviated from the original ATCC stock. This is likely what occurred at Cornell University to produce the Fcwf-4 CU cell line, given that Fcwf-4 cells were obtained from the ATCC and then passaged for many years. To our knowledge, this is the first report describing the phenotypic differences between the original Fcwf-4 cells available from the ATCC and a distinct lineage that was derived from the original cells.",

However, our studies with the Fcwf-4 CU cell line demonstrate that rapid, high titers of type I FIPV Black can be recovered from cell-free supernatants and enumerated using a standardized plaque assay. It is our hope that the Fcwf-4 CU cells will alleviate some of the technical hardships associated with the growth of type I FCoV and expedite investigation of a wider range of type I FCoV strains. The Fcwf-4 CU cells, due to their distinct growth kinetics and enhanced replication of FIPV Black virus, will be deposited at the ATCC to facilitate their distribution to the research community.",

Cell culture supernatants were routinely collected after 3 days of culture and then heat-inactivated at 95\u00b0C for 10 min. PCR amplification for mycoplasma detection was performed using a forward primer: 5'-GGC GAA TGG GTG AGT AAC ACG -3' and a reverse primer: 5'-CGG ATA ACG CTT GCG ACC TAT G -3'. Thermocycler settings were as follows: initial denaturation at 95\u00b0C for 10 min; 35 cycles consisting of denaturation at 95\u00b0C for 45 s, annealing at 60\u00b0C for 45 s, and extension at 72\u00b0C for 60 s; and a final extension at 72\u00b0C for 10 min. The PCR products were analyzed on 1% (w/v) agarose gel. DNA fragments were visualized with a UV transilluminator after being stained with ethidium bromide. If mycoplasma was detected, the cells were treated for 7 days with 0.5 \u03bcg/mL of mycoplasma removal agent (Bio-Rad, #BUF035). All results shown here are from mycoplasma negative cells. IACUC approved protocols. Total bone marrow content was collected. Red blood cells and fatty tissue were removed by lysis in ACK lysis buffer and straining through a 0.70 \u00b5m filter (Falcon). The remaining cells, predominantly hematopoietic stem cells, were cryopreserved at 5.0 \u00d7 10 7 cells/mL in 90% FBS and 10% DMSO. Feline bone marrow derived macrophages (fBMDMs) were differentiated as previously reported (Gow et al., 2013) with slight modification. Briefly, 5.0 \u00d7 10 7 bone marrow cells were plated in 100 \u00d7 26 mm petri dishes (VWR, #25387-030) in DMEM (Corning, #10-017-CV) supplemented with 20% FBS, 10,000 IU/mL recombinant human (rh) M-CSF (PeproTech, #300-25) and 50 \u03bcM \u03b2-mercaptoethanol then incubated at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO 2 . At day 3, supernatant was removed, clarified of cells, diluted 1:1 with fresh DMEM supplemented with 20% FCS and 10,000 IU/mL rhM-CSF, and returned to cells. fBMDMs were recovered on day 6 by gentle aspiration in PBS following 30 min, 4\u00b0C incubation in PBS.",
