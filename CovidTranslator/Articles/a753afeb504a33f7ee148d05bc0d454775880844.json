Markers of infection included histology, immuno~stochemistry, virus quantification and virus serology. All BALB mice developed severe disseminated disease with high mortality due to encephalitis and hepatitis. Peak MHV titers appeared in brain, liver, spleen and intestine on days 3 or 5. Age at inoculation did not influence virus titers in brain, spleen or intestine, but virus titers in liver were inversely proportional to age at inoculation. In 6-wk-old BALB mice, virus was cleared from spleen, intestine and liver by day 30 and from brain by day 60. In intestine, MHV was localized to lymphoid tissue, without fecal excretion. SJL mice of all ages developed remarkably milder disease with low mortality occurring only among mice inoculated at 1 wk of age. SJL mice inoculated at 1 wk had disseminated infection at day 3, but lesions and antigen were cleared from most organs by day 5. Mice inoculated at 3 and 6 wk of age had minimal or no involvement of peripheral organs, and mice inoculated at 12 wk of age had infections restricted to the nose. At day 5, MHV titers in brain, liver, spleen and intestine were significantly lower or undetectable in SJL mice of all ages compared to age-matched BALB mice. In 6-wk-old mice, MHV was cleared from all organs by day 10. Serum antibody titers to MHV were many-fold higher in BALB mice, compared to SJL mice, which mounted only a modest response.",

            "text": "Since its initial isolation from the brains of mice with posterior paresis (Cheever et al., 1949) , the JHM strain of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) has received considerable attention as a neurotropic MHV strain that experimentally induced encephalitis and demyelination in mice and rats (Bailey et al., 1949; Goto et al., 1977; Knobler et al., 1981 Knobler et al., , 1982 Sorenson et al., 1980; Stohlman et al., 1981; Wege et al., 1981 Wege et al., , 1983 Weiner et al., 1973) . Although its neurotropic properties have been emphasized, MHV-JHM is similar to several other MHV strains and isolates, with tropism for not only brain, but also many other tissues in susceptible hosts (Barthold and Smith, 1984; Barthold 1986) . Strains such as MHV-S and MHV-A59 also produce brain lesions similar to MHV-JHM (Barthold et al., 1986; Barthold and Smith, 1983; Koolen et al., 1983; Taguchi et al., 1979; Woyciechowska et al., 1984) . It is now becoming apparent that different MHV strains, like coronaviruses of other species (Wege et al., 1982) , are either primary upper-respiratory or enteric pathogens in mice. In hosts that are more susceptible by virtue of immaturity, genotype, or impaired lymphoreticular function, respiratory MHV strains are likely to disseminate secondarily to multiple organs, but enterotropic MHV strains tend to be more restricted to enteric mucosa (Barthold, 1986; Barthold et al., 1985) . Commonly studied, protot~e MHV strains (1, 3, A59, JHM, S), are primary respiratory viruses in the mouse.",

Among susceptible BALB mice in the present study, mortality was highest in the youngest age group, but virus titers in most target organs did not reflect age-related differences. We did find, however, decreasing virus titers in liver with increasing age at inoculation in BALB mice. Mice of the SJL genotype are exceptionally resistant to mortality following i.c. inoculation with MHV-JHM, particularly after 6 wk of age (Knobler et al., 1981b (Knobler et al., , c, 1982 Stohlman and Frelinger, 1978; Stohlman et al., 1980 Stohlman et al., , 1982 . We found that resistance of SJL mice to i.n.-inoculated MHV-JHM occurs early in life and may evolve at different rates in different organs. Brain resistance to i.n. inoculation appeared to begin in mice inoculated at 1 wk of age, was relatively strong in mice inoculated at 3 wk of age, and absolute in older mice. Mice infected at 3 days of age were highly susceptible to brain infection. Liver was remarkably resistant to infection in all SJL age groups, including mice infected as young as 3 days of age. Lymphoid tissue was a target in SJL mice inoculated at 3 or less wk of age, but not older mice. It is difficult to assess if these differences were due to reduced access of virus to target tissues or tissue resistance per se, since mice were inoculated i.n. with virus. Tissue resistance is likely, since it has also been shown that direct i.c. inoculation of 445-wk-old SJL mice with MHV-JHM resulted in low levels of virus replication in brain, liver and spleen at 2 days, but virus had cleared by 4-7 days after inoculation (Knobler et al., 1982) . Age-related differences do not appear to be due to acquired immunity to MHV, since our studies precluded natural exposure.",

The nose has been shown to be an important target organ of MHV-JHM and MHV-S ( Barthold and Smith 1983; Goto et al., 1977; Taguchi et al., 1979a) . A number of MHV strains, including MHV-JHM, have been shown to infect lung following i.n. inoculation, However, viral antigen is restricted to alveolar septal cells, usually endothelium, rather than airway epithelium (Barthold and Smith, 1983 Smith, , 1984 Carthew and Sparrow, 1981) . Intestine was infected in mice of the present study, but virus activity was localized to gut-associated lymphoid tissue, with no appreciable virus in feces. In contrast, enterotropic MHV strains replicate nearly exclusively in enteric mucosal epithelium, regardless of age or genotype (Barthold, 1986; Barthold and Smith, 1984; Barthold et al., 1985) . Our current data support other studies (Barthold and Smith, 1984) showing that urinary organs do not play a significant role in MHV replication and excretion. Reproductive tract transmission has not been fully explored. Vertical trans~ssion in utero has been shown experimentally following intravenous MHV-JHM inoculation (Katami et al., 1978) . Furthermore, ME-IV-like particles have been observed in endometrium of naturally infected athymic nude mice (ConSmith et al., 1976) .",

Lesions were present through day 30, but were resolving at day 60 and had disappeared by day 90. Infectious virus was detectable through day 30, but not at day 60. Central nervous system infection is far more variable following i.e. insulation, since outcome is deter~ned by virus strain, virus dose, host age and host genotype (Haspel et al., 1978; Weiner, 1973) . Persistent brain infection has been demonstrated in some mice that survive i.e. inoculation with MHV-JHM and MHV-A59. With MHV-JHM, active demyelination has been observed in one study for up to 16 months (Herndon et al., 1975) . Foci of recurrent demyelination and infectious virus have been shown in brain at 365 days after i.c. inoculation with a temperature-sensitive mutant of MHV-JHM (Knobler et al., 1982b, c) . Demyelination has also been observed for up to 6 months after i.c. inoculation of MHV-A59, and low levels of MHV-A59 RNA can be detected for up to 10 months (Lavi et al., 1984a, b) . Others (Robb et al., 1979) have found that MHV-JHM, MHV-A59 and their temperature-sensitive mutants induce a high rate of demyelination, but few mice have persistent demye~nation beyond 2-3 months. Most MHV studies, including our current data, have demonstrated a transient rather than persistent course of MHV infection in all tissues, including brain (reviewed in Barthold, 1986) .",
