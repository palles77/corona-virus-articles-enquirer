            "text": "Pneumonia is the sixth leading cause of death in the United States and the number one cause of death from infectious diseases. The patient with pneumonia is managed in the intensive care unit (ICU) when severe forms of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) are present or when a hospitalized patient develops a lifethreatening nosocomial pneumonia (NP). A newly defi ned entity, health care-associated pneumonia (HCAP), is a form of NP that arises in patients who have been in contact with environments such as nursing homes and hemodialysis centers that expose them to the multidrugresistant bacteria present in the hospital; these patients frequently develop severe pneumonia. 1, 2 In the ICU almost 90% of episodes of NP occur in patients who are being mechanically ventilated for other reasons, and this is termed ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The elderly account for a disproportionate number of critically ill patients with all forms of pneumonia, often because they commonly have comorbid illness that predisposes them to more severe forms of infection, and their short-and long-term mortality is higher than that of younger patients. 3 In all forms of severe pneumonia, antibiotic resistance is an increasing problem, especially among pneumococci in CAP, and with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter spp., extended-spectrum \u03b2-lactamase-producing gram-negatives, and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in VAP and HCAP. 1, 2 Although patients with HIV infection and those with other immunocompromising diseases commonly develop pneumonia, the approach to managing these patients is very specifi c and different from that used in immunocompetent patients. Therefore these populations are not discussed here.",

            "text": "Pneumonia is unusual among medical illnesses because its pathogenesis, therapy, and prevention can be discussed, but there is tremendous controversy about how to best diagnose its presence. Although the clinical defi nition requires the presence of a new radiographic infi ltrate and supporting clinical information for the presence of infection, the diagnosis of ventilator-associated pneumonia is imprecise, and most physicians are relegated to managing patients from this imperfect perspective. Considerable controversy exists about whether a more precise and accurate bacteriologic defi nition of pneumonia would lead to improved patient outcome, with some recent studies focusing on this issue. 2, 4, 5 Numerous other controversies related to pneumonia therapy and prevention are also debated among critical care physicians and are discussed in this chapter. destabilization of another serious medical problem. 1, 8 In patients with severe CAP, the expected mortality rate for those admitted to the ICU is 35% to 40%, but higher rates have been observed if the majority of ICU-admitted patients are mechanically ventilated, implying that the prognosis is worse if ICU care is fi rst provided late in the course of illness. 9 One recent study found that CAP accounted for 5.9% of all ICU admissions in the United Kingdom and that 59% were admitted within the fi rst 2 days of hospital stay. In this group, 55% were mechanically ventilated on ICU entry and the mortality rate was lowest (46%) in those admitted within the fi rst 2 days, compared with those admitted later in the course of hospital illness. 9 On the basis of a number of studies, a reasonable benchmark is that approximately 60% of all ICU CAP patients will be mechanically ventilated at the time of admission. 6, 7, 10 Among those with VAP, mortality rates can be as high as 50% to 70%, and case-control studies have documented mortality directly attributable to the presence of pneumonia. 11 Antibiotic-resistant organisms may add to the mortality rate of VAP, not because of increased virulence but rather because these organisms are often not anticipated and, when present, are often initially treated with ineffective antibiotic regimens. 12 HCAP is a form of NP that includes patients with pneumonia developing any time during their hospital stay (including on admission) who have been exposed to the drug-resistant bacteria present in the health care environment. This includes any patient with a history of hospitalization in the past 3 months, admission from a long-term care facility, need for dialysis or home infusion therapy, home wound care, or antibiotic therapy in the past 3 months. 2, 13 A number of studies have defi ned the risk factors for severe forms of CAP and VAP, as well as the clinical parameters associated with an increased risk for patient mortality.",

            "text": "In a meta-analysis of 33,148 patients with CAP, the overall mortality rate was 13.7%, but those admitted to the ICU had a mortality rate of 36.5%. 17 Eleven prognostic factors were signifi cantly associated with different odds ratios (ORs) for mortality: male sex (OR = 1.3), pleuritic chest pain (OR = 0.5), hypothermia (OR = 5.0), systolic hypotension (OR = 4.8), tachypnea (OR = 2.9), diabetes mellitus (OR = 1.3), neoplastic disease (OR = 2.8), neurologic disease (OR = 4.6), bacteremia (OR = 2.8), leukopenia (OR = 2.5), and multilobar infi ltrates (OR = 3.1). In other studies the clinical features that predict a poor outcome (Box 43-2) include advanced age (older than 65 years), preexisting chronic illness of any type, the absence of fever on admission, respiratory rate greater than 30 breaths per minute, diastolic or systolic hypotension, elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) (>19.6 mg/dL), profound leukopenia or leukocytosis, inadequate antibiotic therapy, need for mechanical ventilation, hypoalbuminemia, and the presence of certain \"high-risk\" organisms (type III pneumococcus, S. aureus, gram-negative bacilli, aspiration organisms, or postobstructive pneumonia). Other studies have found that when CAP patients have a delay in the initiation of appropriate antibiotic therapy of more than 4 hours, mortality is increased. [18] [19] [20] Prognostic scoring approaches have been applied to predict mortality in CAP patients, and two prominent systems are the pneumonia severity index (PSI) and a modifi cation of the British Thoracic Society rule, referred to as CURB-65. 8, [21] [22] [23] The PSI is a complex scoring system that places patients into one of fi ve risk groups for death on the basis of age, presence of male sex, comorbid illness, and certain laboratory and physical fi ndings. This tool is good for predicting mortality, but it heavily weights age and comorbidity and does not account for the social needs of patients, so it may not help to defi ne the optimal site of care for a given patient. The CURB-65 approach assesses the presence of confusion, elevated Prognostic scoring systems have been used to defi ne the need for ICU admission, with the suggestion that ICU care be considered for those in PSI classes IV and V or those with a CURB-65 score of 3 or higher. 8, 23 This may not always be effective because up to 37% of those admitted to the ICU are in PSI classes I to III, and risk for death (which PSI can measure) is not always the same as need for intensive care. 8 Conversely, patients in higher PSI classes do not always need ICU care if they fall into these high-mortality-risk groups because of advanced age and comorbid illness, in the absence of physiologic fi ndings of severe pneumonia. Neither of the current prognostic scoring systems is ideal by itself for defi ning the need for ICU care, and both can be regarded only as providing decision support information that must be supplemented by clinical assessment and judgment. In addition, the two scoring approaches should be viewed as being complementary to one another. 24 For example, in one recent study that compared the PSI with the CURB-65, both were good for predicting mortality and in identifying lowmortality-risk patients. However, the CURB-65 appeared to be more discriminating in defi ning mortality risk in the severely ill. 23 In another study, Ewig and colleagues 25 examined the 10 criteria in the 1993 American Thoracic Society guidelines to defi ne severe CAP. They found that need for ICU was defi ned by the presence of two of three minor criteria (systolic BP <90, multilobar disease, PaO 2 / FIO 2 ratio <250) or one of two major criteria (need for mechanical ventilation or septic shock). 25 On the basis of these observations, the 2001 ATS guidelines for CAP recommend that severe CAP could be defi ned on the basis of the presence of these features. 1 Other investigators have shown that the use of early and effective empiric therapy can improve survival in the setting of severe CAP. Retrospective data have shown a reduced mortality for admitted CAP patients who are treated within 4 hours of arrival to the hospital, compared with those who are treated later. 18 Ineffective initial empiric therapy was a potent predictor of death, being associated with a 60% mortality rate, compared with an 11% mortality rate for those who received initial effective therapy. 10 Similarly, in other studies of CAP, the combined use of a \u03b2-lactam and a macrolide antibiotic was associated with a lower mortality than if other therapies were given. 26, 27 Among patients with severe CAP, another important prognostic fi nding is clinical evolution, as refl ected by radiographic progression during therapy. 6 The elderly with CAP often have a higher risk of dying than other populations, in part because adverse prognostic features are particularly common in this population. 3 In one series the mortality rate of nursing home-acquired pneumonia was 32%, compared with a mortality rate of 14% in other patients with CAP. 28 One factor that may explain this fi nding is that older patients often have atypical clinical presentations of pneumonia, which may lead to their being diagnosed at a later, more advanced stage of illness, resulting in an increased risk of death. 29 In part, as a consequence of these unusual clinical presentations, when these patients come to the hospital for evaluation, there are often delays in establishing the correct diagnosis. This leads to delays in initiating timely therapy and further increases the risk of dying. 20 Older patients from nursing homes who present with pneumonia are now included in a separate category, HCAP (discussed earlier).",

It declines thereafter to a risk of 2% per day for days 6 to 10 and to a rate of 1% per day or lower after this. 30 Noninvasive ventilation for respiratory failure is associated with a much lower risk of pneumonia than endotracheal intubation. The relation between pneumonia and ARDS is particularly interesting. As many as one third of all cases of ARDS may be the result of pneumonia, and in some series pneumonia is the most common cause of acute lung injury. Not only can a variety of CAPs serve as a cause of ARDS, but secondary NP is the most common infection acquired by patients with established ARDS. [31] [32] [33] However, it has been shown that when patients with ARDS develop pneumonia, it is generally a late event, occurring after at least 7 days of mechanical ventilation. 32 Pneumonia also presents a particular problem in the postoperative patient, particularly after elective thoracic, cardiac, or abdominal surgery. Other surgical groups that are at high risk for pneumonia include the victims of major trauma, particularly those suffering head injury and blunt chest trauma. When a patient has a pulmonary contusion, it may be diffi cult to distinguish this process from secondary lung infection on the basis of clinical and radiographic fi ndings.",

Rello observed that pulmonary superinfection had a 67% mortality, whereas primary NP had a 38% mortality rate. 41 In earlier studies, Graybill 42 observed a 62% mortality rate with superinfection pneumonia, compared with a 40% mortality rate for primary nosocomial lung infection. These data, as well as information from Fagon and colleagues 43 and Trouillet and colleagues, 44 emphasize the important role of prior antibiotics in enhancing mortality, an outcome that is likely the result of secondary infection by more virulent pathogens. As a result, antibiotic use has two pivotal roles in prognosticating outcome from NP: outcome is improved if the correct therapy is chosen, but if this therapy is followed by superinfection, then mortality is much more likely, generally because these infections involve diffi cult-to-treat, drugresistant organisms.",

This may occur because the patient has an inadequate immune response, often as the result of underlying comorbid illness; because of anatomic abnormalities (endobronchial obstruction, bronchiectasis); or because of therapy-induced dysfunction of the immune system (corticosteroids, endotracheal intubation). 2, 45, 46 In addition, genetic variations in the immune response make some patients prone to overwhelming infection because of an inadequate response and others prone to acute lung injury because of an excessive immune response. 16 In fact, the failure to localize the immune response to the respiratory site of initial infection may explain why some patients develop acute lung injury and sepsis because the infl ammatory response extends to the entire lung and systemic circulation. 47 Pneumonia can even occur in patients who have an adequate immune system, if the host defense system is overwhelmed by a large inoculum of bacteria (massive aspiration) or by a particularly virulent organism to which the patient has no preexisting immunity or to which the patient has an inability to form an adequate immune response. With this paradigm in mind, it is easy to understand why previously healthy individuals develop infection with virulent pathogens such as viruses (infl uenza), Legionella pneumophila, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. However, for chronically ill patients, it is possible for them to be infected not by these virulent organisms but also by organisms that are not highly virulent. Because of host defense impairments, organisms that commonly colonize these patients can cause infection as a result of immune responses that are inadequate. These organisms include enteric gramnegative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, P. aeruginosa, Acinetobacter spp.) and fungi (Aspergillus and Candida spp.).",

Although most pneumonias result from micro-aspiration, patients can also aspirate large volumes of bacteria if they have impaired neurologic protection of the upper airway (stroke, seizure) or gastrointestinal illnesses that predispose to vomiting. Other routes of entry include inhalation, which applies primarily to viruses, Legionella pneumophila and Mycobacterium tuberculosis; hematogenous dissemination from extra-pulmonary sites of infection (right-sided endocarditis); and direct extension from contiguous sites of infection. In critically ill hospitalized patients, bacteria can also enter the lung from a colonized stomach (spreading retrograde to the oropharynx, followed by aspiration), a colonized or infected maxillary sinus, and colonization of dental plaque, or they can enter the lung directly via the endotracheal tube (from the hands of staff members). Recent studies have shown that the use of nasal tubes (into the stomach or trachea) can predispose to sinusitis and pneumonia, but that a gastric source of pneumonia pathogens in ventilated patients is not common. 48, 49 ",

            "text": "The endotracheal tube bypasses the fi ltration and host defense functions of the upper airway and can act as a conduit for direct inoculation of bacteria into the lung. This route may be particularly important if bacteria colonize the inside of the endotracheal tube itself. 50, 51 This can occur if tracheobronchial organisms reach the endotracheal tube, a site where they are able to proliferate free from any impediment by the host defense system. Bacteria commonly grow at this location in a biofi lm, which promotes the growth of multidrug-resistant organisms. 51 The biofi lm represents a \"sequestered nidus\" of infection on the inside of the endotracheal tube, and particles can be dislodged every time the patient is suctioned. This is one of the mechanisms explaining the strong association between endotracheal intubation and pneumonia. Given the presence of biofi lm in endotracheal tubes, it may be tempting to regularly reintubate patients and use a fresh tube, but this approach is not recommended because reintubation is itself a risk factor for VAP. 52 Just as a patient's own tracheobronchial fl ora can spread to the endotracheal tube and amplify to large numbers, a similar phenomenon can occur in respiratory therapy equipment and in ventilator circuits. 53, 54 Ventilator circuit colonization studies indicate that the greatest numbers are found at sites closest to the patient, not the ventilator, suggesting that circuit contamination originates from the patient. 53 One highly contaminated site is the condensation in the tubing, and this material can inadvertently be inoculated into patients if the tubing is not handled carefully. Because condensate colonization occurs in 80% of tubings within 24 hours, it does not appear that frequent ventilator circuit changes are useful or even able to reduce the risk of pneumonia; in one study, tubing changes every 24 hours (rather than every 48 hours) served as a risk factor for pneumonia. 55 Although most patients have ventilator tubing changed every 48 hours, several studies have shown no increased risk of infection if tubing is never changed or changed infrequently. 56, 57 The use of heat moisture exchangers may be one way to avoid this problem, but they have had an inconsistent effect on preventing VAP. In addition, frequent changes of heat moisture exchangers (i.e., every 24 hours) have not been shown to have an impact on the incidence of VAP, and heat moisture exchangers should be changed no more frequently than every 48 hours. 58 ",

In nonventilated patients, cough is the most common fi nding. Cough is present in up to 80% of all CAP patients but is less common in those who are elderly, those with serious comorbidity, or individuals coming from nursing homes. Patients with CAP and an intact immune system generally have classic pneumonia symptoms, but the elderly patient can have a nonrespiratory presentation with symptoms of confusion, falling, failure to thrive, altered functional capacity, or deterioration in a preexisting medical illness such as congestive heart failure. 59 The absence of clear-cut respiratory symptoms and an afebrile status have themselves been predictors of an increased risk of death. Pleuritic chest pain is also commonly seen in patients with CAP, and in one study its absence was also identifi ed as a poor prognostic fi nding. 60 Certain clinical conditions are associated with specifi c pathogens in patients with CAP, and these associations should be evaluated when obtaining a history (Table  43-1) . 1 For example, if the presentation is subacute, following contact with birds, rats, or rabbits, then the possibility of psittacosis, leptospirosis, tularemia, or plague should be considered. Coxiella burnetii (Q fever) is a concern with exposure to parturient cats, cattle, sheep, or goats; Francisella tularensis with rabbit exposure; hantavirus with exposure to mice droppings in endemic areas; C. psittaci with exposure to turkeys or infected birds; and Legionella with exposure to contaminated water sources (saunas). Following infl uenza, superinfection with pneumococcus, S. aureus including MRSA, and Hemophilus infl uenzae should be considered. With travel to endemic areas in Asia, the onset of respiratory failure after a preceding viral illness should lead to suspicion of a viral pneumonia, which could be severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) or avian infl uenza. 61 Endemic fungi (coccidioidomycosis, histoplasmosis, and blastomycosis) occur in well-defi ned geographic areas and may present acutely with symptoms that overlap with acute bacterial pneumonia.",

Recently, the Clinical Pulmonary Infection Score (CPIS) has been applied to patients with VAP. Six criteria are scored on a scale from 0 to 2 for each, and pneumonia is diagnosed with a total score of at least 6 (out of a maximum of 12). 62 The criteria are (1) fever, (2) purulence of sputum, (3) white blood cell count, (4) oxygenation, (5) degree of radiographic abnormality, and (6) the presence of pathogens in the sputum. Many studies have documented that VAP is diagnosed more often clinically than can be confi rmed microbiologically, and the diagnosis is further obscured by the fact that most mechanically ventilated patients are colonized by enteric gram-negative bacteria. Thus the fi nding of potential pathogens in the sputum has no diagnostic value. In addition, some patients can have purulent sputum and fever, without a new infi ltrate, and be diagnosed with purulent tracheobronchitis, an infectious complication of mechanical ventilation that may also require antibiotic therapy but is not pneumonia. 2 In taking a history from a patient with NP, it is important to identify any risk factors for drug-resistant organisms. For ventilated patients, these include prolonged ICU stay (>5 days), recent antibiotic therapy, and the presence of health care-associated pneumonia. 2, 44 In CAP patients, risk factors for drug-resistant pneumococcus include recent \u03b2-lactam therapy, exposure to a child in daycare, alcoholism, immune suppression, and multiple medical comorbidities. 1,63",

The most common cause of CAP is pneumococcus (S. pneumoniae), an organism which is frequently (at least 40% of the time) resistant to penicillin or other antibiotics, leading to the term drug-resistant S. pneumoniae (DRSP). Fortunately, most penicillin resistance in the United States is still more commonly of the \"intermediate\" type (penicillin minimum inhibitory concentration, or MIC, of 0.1 to 1.0 mg/L) and not of the high-level type (penicillin MIC of 2.0 or more). 66 Pneumococcal resistance to other antibiotics is also common, including macrolides and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, but the clinical relevance and impact on outcome of these in vitro fi ndings is uncertain, and most experts believe that only organisms with a penicillin MIC of greater than 4 mg/L lead to an increased risk of death. 67 All patients with severe CAP should be considered to be at risk for DRSP and, in addition, those admitted to the ICU can have infection with atypical pathogens, which accounts for up to 20% of infections, either as primary infection or as co-pathogens. The identity of these organisms varies over time and geography. In some areas, Legionella is a common cause of severe CAP, whereas in others Chlamydophila pneumoniae or M. pneumoniae predominate. 68 Other important causes of severe CAP include H. infl uenzae; S. aureus, which includes MRSA (especially after infl uenza); and enteric gram-negatives (including P. aeruginosa) in patients with appropriate risk factors (particularly bronchiectasis and steroid-treated COPD). Recently, a toxin-producing strain of MRSA has been described to cause CAP in patients after infl uenza and other viral infections. This community-acquired MRSA is biologically and genetically distinct from the MRSA that causes NP, being more virulent and necrotizing and associated with the production of the Panton-Valentine Leukocidin (PVL). 69, 70 Viruses can be a cause of severe CAP including infl uenza virus, as well as parainfl uenza virus and epidemic viruses such as coronavirus (which caused SARS) and avian infl uenza. 61 Viral pneumonia (SARS and infl uenza) can lead to respiratory failure, and occasionally tuberculosis or endemic fungi can result in severe pneumonia.",

Many of these patients who are at risk for gramnegatives would now be reclassifi ed as having health care-associated pneumonia (HCAP). 2,13 Some ICU patients are at risk for pseudomonal infection, whereas others are not, and the risk factors for P. aeruginosa infection are structural lung disease (bronchiectasis), corticosteroid therapy (>10 mg prednisone/day), broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy for more than 7 days in the past month, previous hospitalization, and malnutrition. 2 Although aspiration has often been considered a risk factor for anaerobic infection, a study of severe CAP in elderly patients with aspiration risk factors found that this population is likely to have gram-negative infection and, using sensitive microbiologic methods, anaerobes were uncommon. 71",

In addition, some patients are also at risk for infection with other organisms, depending on the presence of risk factors such as prolonged hospitalization (>5 days), prior antibiotic therapy, recent hospitalization (within 90 days), recent antibiotic therapy, residence in a nursing home, or need for chronic care outside the hospital. 2, 44 Patients with these risk factors can possibly be infected with multidrug-resistant (MDR) gram-positive and gram-negative organisms including MRSA, P. aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter spp. Recognition of the multiple risk factors associated with these resistant pathogens has made it clear that there are patients with \"early-onset\" NP (within the fi rst 4 days of hospitalization) who can be infected with MDR organisms. In addition, up to 40% of patients with VAP have polymicrobial infection, involving multiple pathogens. 72 Most data on NP bacteriology come from patients with VAP, and the etiology in nonventilated patients is presumed to be similar on the basis of the presence of risk factors for drug-resistant pathogens. In patients with VAP, infection with enteric gram-negatives is more common than infection with gram-positives, although the frequency of MRSA infection is increasing in this population, as is infection with Acinetobacter spp. 73 HCAP patients have been included in the NP guidelines as being a group at risk for infection with MDR gram-positive and gramnegatives. 2 Although most ICU-admitted patients with this illness are infected with these organisms, one study of nursing home patients requiring mechanical ventilation for severe pneumonia showed that these organisms were not present if the patient with severe pneumonia had not received antibiotics in the preceding 6 months and was also of a good functional status (as defi ned by activities of daily living). 74 In approaching the bacteriology of NP, it is important to recognize that each hospital, as well as each ICU within a given hospital, can have its own unique fl ora and antibiotic susceptibility patterns, and thus therapy needs to be adapted to the organisms in a given institution, which can change over time. 75 In addition, it is especially important to know this information because antibiotic resistance is a common factor contributing to initially inappropriate empiric antibiotic therapy. Choosing the wrong empiric therapy has been a particular problem for organisms such as P. aeruginosa, Acinetobacter spp., and MRSA. 12 These highly resistant organisms can be present in up to 60% of patients who develop VAP after at least 7 days of ventilation and who have also received prior antibiotic therapy. 2, 44 ",

As mentioned, these clinical fi ndings may be sensitive but not specifi c for infection, and efforts to improve the clinical diagnosis of pneumonia have involved the previously mentioned CPIS. 79 Many patients with suspected NP can have other diagnoses that can be suggested by the rapidity of the clinical response and by the nature of the clinical fi ndings. These diagnoses include atelectasis and congestive heart failure (rapid clinical resolution) or, in the case of a lack of response to therapy, infl ammatory lung diseases, extrapulmonary infection (sinusitis, central line infection, intraabdominal infection), or the presence of an unusual or drug-resistant pathogen. In addition, the presence of pathogenic organisms in sputum culture is not diagnostic because this fi nding cannot separate oropharyngeal and tracheobronchial colonization from parenchymal lung infection. The situation is further complicated because some ventilated patients can have nosocomial infectious tracheobronchitis, an illness with all the clinical features of pneumonia but with no new lung infi ltrate, and this illness may also require antibiotic therapy and involve the same pathogens as VAP. 2 In an effort to make the diagnosis more secure, and to avoid the overuse of antibiotics, some investigators have used quantitative sampling of lower respiratory secretions collected either bronchoscopically (bronchoalveolar lavage, protected specimen brush) or nonbronchoscopically (endotracheal aspirate, nonbronchoscopic catheter lavage), particularly in patients with suspected VAP. When quantitative cultures are collected, some investigators have defi ned the presence of pneumonia by the growth of bacteria at a concentration above a predefi ned threshold concentration. 4, 5 Although the results can guide therapy decisions, most clinicians use antibiotic therapy, regardless of quantitative culture data, in patients who have clinical signs of sepsis and suspected pneumonia. Regardless of whether quantitative cultures are used, all patients with suspected NP should have a lower respiratory tract culture collected prior to the start of antibiotic therapy. If this is not a quantitative culture, then a sputum or tracheal aspirate should be obtained and the fi ndings reported \"semiquantitatively\" as light, moderate, or heavy growth of bacteria. 2, 5 Unfortunately, a negative culture is diffi cult to interpret if the patient has had initiation or change in antibiotic therapy in the preceding 72 hours. If, however, either a quantitative or semiquantitative culture is negative or does not show a highly resistant pathogen, and antibiotics have not been changed in the past 72 hours, the therapy can often be stopped or focused to a narrower spectrum. 2, 80 THERAPY For all patients with severe pneumonia, algorithms for initial empiric therapy have been developed on the basis of the most likely etiologic pathogens in a given patient and clinical setting. If diagnostic testing reveals a specifi c etiologic pathogen, therapy can be focused on the results. In addition, as mentioned earlier, if an anticipated pathogen is not present in a diagnostic sample, it may be possible to stop empiric coverage of that organism (Fig. 43-1 ).",

The rationale for this approach was to provide broad antimicrobial coverage, prevent the emergence of resistance during therapy, and potentially provide synergistic activity if a \u03b2-lactam antibiotic was combined with an aminoglycoside (for P. aeruginosa pneumonia). However, only with bacteremic P. aeruginosa pneumonia has combination therapy (generally with an aminoglycoside and a \u03b2-lactam) been shown to be superior to monotherapy. 81, 82 One practical problem to this approach is the aminoglycosides themselves, a class of antibiotics with a narrow therapeutic-to-toxic ratio, and a high incidence of nephrotoxicity, particularly in elderly patients. When these drugs are used, it is important to use enough antibiotic to achieve high peak serum levels to optimize effi cacy but to also avoid elevated trough levels, which correlate with toxicity. When peak serum levels have been monitored, levels of more than 7 \u00b5g/mL for gentamicin and tobramycin and more than 28 \u00b5g/mL for amikacin have been associated with more favorable outcomes. 83 One other limitation of aminoglycosides is their relatively poor penetration into bronchial secretions, achieving only 40% of the serum concentrations at this site. In addition, antimicrobial activity is reduced at the low pH levels that are common in the bronchial secretions of patients with pneumonia. These concerns may explain the fi nding in one study that the addition of an aminoglycoside to imipenem had no added effi cacy for severe NP and only added renal toxicity. 84 In addition, a meta-analysis of the value of adding an aminoglycoside to a \u03b2-lactam in critically ill patients, including many with pneumonia, found no therapeutic benefi t. 82 It has now become standard to administer aminoglycosides by combining the total 24-hour dose into a single dose, rather than in divided doses.",

In the absence of these highly resistant pathogens, antibiotics that have been effective as monotherapy for severe VAP include imipenem, meropenem, cefepime, ciprofl oxacin, high-dose levofl oxacin (750 mg daily), and piperacillin/tazobactam. 2, [86] [87] [88] [89] [90] In the patient with severe pneumonia, it is usually necessary to start Algorithmic approach to managing severe pneumonia. Patients are categorized into community-acquired pneumonia and nosocomial pneumonia/ventilator-associated pneumonia. Each group undergoes diagnostic testing, followed by empiric therapy based on the most likely etiologic pathogens. The resulting clinical response is used to guide the duration of therapy or to decide whether to broaden the differential diagnosis to other processes. CA-MRSA = community-acquired MRSA; CAP = community-acquired pneumonia; MDR = multidrug resistant; NP = nosocomial pneumonia; VAP = ventilatorassociated pneumonia. therapy with multiple agents, but after tracheal aspirate or other lower respiratory tract cultures become available, it is usually possible to \"de-escalate\" to monotherapy, particularly if a highly resistant organism is absent. 80 In some circumstances monotherapy should not be used: (1) in any patient with severe CAP because the effi cacy of this approach has not been demonstrated; (2) in suspected bacteremic infection with P. aeruginosa; (3) in the empiric therapy of VAP, if the patient has risk factors for infection with MDR pathogens; and (4) if the patient has NP and both S. aureus and P. aeruginosa are identifi ed in culture as the etiologic pathogens. Monotherapy should never be attempted with a thirdgeneration cephalosporin because of the possibility of emergence of resistance during therapy as a result of production of chromosomal \u03b2-lactamases by the Enterobacteriaceae group of organisms. 2 If P. aeruginosa is a target organism of therapy, antibiotics with effi cacy against this pathogen are necessary. Anti-pseudomonal \u03b2-lactam antibiotics include the penicillins piperacillin, azlocillin, mezlocillin, ticarcillin, and carbenicillin; the third-generation cephalosporins ceftazidime and cefoperazone; the fourth-generation cephalosporin cefepime; the carbapenems imipenem and meropenem; the monobactam aztreonam (which can be used in the penicillin-allergic patient); and the \u03b2-lactam/\u03b2lactamase inhibitor combinations ticarcillin/clavulanate and piperacillin/tazobactam. Other antipseudomonal agents include the quinolone ciprofl oxacin; high-dose levofl oxacin; and the aminoglycosides (amikacin, gentamicin, tobramycin).",

            "text": "For ICU-admitted CAP, initial therapy should be directed at DRSP, Legionella and other atypical pathogens, enteric gram-negatives, and other selected organisms on the basis of epidemiologic risk assessment. Therapy is chosen, depending on whether or not the patient is at risk for P. aeruginosa (\"modifying\" risk factors listed earlier). In all the treatment algorithms, no ICU-admitted CAP patient should receive empiric monotherapy, even with one of the new quinolones. 1 This recommendation is based on the fact that the effi cacy (especially for meningitis complicating pneumonia), effective dosing and safety of quinolone monotherapy has not been established for ICU-admitted CAP patients. In one recent study comparing levofl oxacin with a \u03b2-lactam/quinolone combination, the single-agent regimen was not shown to be effective for patients in septic shock and for those treated with mechanical ventilation. 91 Recommended therapy for severe CAP, in the absence of pseudomonal risk factors, should be with a selected intravenous \u03b2-lactam (e.g., cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, ertapenem, a \u03b2-lactam/\u03b2-lactamase inhibitor combination) combined with either an intravenous macrolide or an intravenous antipneumococcal quinolone (levofl oxacin or moxifl oxacin). For patients with pseudomonal risk factors, therapy can be with a two-drug regimen using an anti-pseudomonal \u03b2-lactam (imipenem, meropenem, piperacillin/tazobactam, cefepime) plus ciprofl oxacin (the most active anti-pseudomonal quinolone) or levofl oxacin (750 mg daily). An alternative is a three-drug regimen using an anti-pseudomonal \u03b2-lactam plus an aminoglycoside plus either an intravenous antipneumococcal quinolone (levofl oxacin or moxifl oxacin) or a macrolide. 1, 92 In addition to the antibiotic approach to therapy outlined earlier, there are several other considerations in the management of CAP. These include providing the fi rst dose of therapy as soon as possible (within 4 hours of arrival in the hospital) and providing coverage in all patients for atypical pathogens using either a macrolide or a quinolone in the regimen on the basis of the data that such an approach reduces mortality. 26, 27, 93 Even in patients with pneumococcal bacteremia, the use of combination therapy (generally with the addition of atypical pathogen coverage to pneumococcal coverage) has been associated with reduced mortality compared with monotherapy. 93 In addition, certain adjunctive therapies should be considered including oxygen, chest physiotherapy (if at least 30 mL of sputum daily and a poor cough response), aerosolized bronchodilators, and corticosteroids (if hypotension and possible relative adrenal insuffi ciency are present). An analysis of the use of activated protein C for patients with septic shock demonstrated that 35% of the patients in the pivotal clinical trial had underlying CAP and that activated protein C was most effective for those CAP patients with an APACHE II score of greater than 25, a PSI class of IV or V, and a CURB-65 score of at least 2. Patients with pneumococcal infection and inadequate therapy also benefi ted, although the benefi t was minimal in those treated with adequate therapy. 94 In addition to their value in patients with relative adrenal insuffi ciency, corticosteroids may be helpful in severe CAP because of their immunomodulating effect. One randomized controlled trial of 48 patients compared hydrocortisone infusion (240 mg/day) with placebo and found that steroid therapy reduced mortality, length of stay, and duration of mechanical ventilation. 95 These fi ndings require other studies to confi rm the benefi t of this adjunctive therapy.",

            "text": "Antibiotic therapy should be given promptly at the fi rst clinical suspicion of pneumonia, and empiric therapy should be dictated by considering whether the patient is at risk for infection with MDR pathogens, primarily because of the presence of recent antibiotic therapy, a prolonged hospital stay, or the development of infection after residing in a nursing home or other chronic care setting (such as a dialysis center) or if there are other risk factors for HCAP. Patients without risks for MDR pathogens can be treated for the \"core pathogens\" listed earlier, generally with a monotherapy regimen of a second-generation or non-pseudomonal third-generation cephalosporin, a \u03b2-lactam/\u03b2-lactamase inhibitor combination, ertapenem, or a quinolone (levofl oxacin or moxifl oxacin). 2 If the patient is allergic to penicillin, therapy can be with a quinolone or the combination of clindamycin and aztreonam. Probably not all HCAP patients need therapy directed against MDR pathogens, and monotherapy has been successful in the absence of MDR pathogens. MDR pathogens are not likely in HCAP patients who do not have at least two of the following: severe infection, recent antibiotic therapy in the past 6 months, poor functional status. 71 In the selection of an empiric therapy regimen, it is necessary to know which antibiotic the patient has recently received (within the past 14 days) and to choose an agent that is in a different class because repeated use of the same class of antibiotic may drive resistance to that class, especially if the pathogen is P. aeruginosa. 97 Similar fi ndings have been made for patients with bacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia and CAP, and repeat use of an agent within 3 months may mean that the patient is being treated with an agent to which pneumococcus is more likely to be resistant. 98 In addition, the recent use of quinolones may present a particular problem because, in the ICU, recent quinolone therapy may predispose to not only quinolone-resistant organisms but also to infection with MDR pathogens, extended-spectrum \u03b2-lactamase producing gram-negatives, and MRSA. 99 For all patients with VAP, it is important to use the correct dose of antibiotic (see Box 43-4 for recommended doses for patients with normal renal function). 2 Although it is possible to identify, on the basis of risk factors, the patient who is likely to be infected with MDR pathogens, it is important to realize that each hospital and each ICU has its own unique organisms and patterns of antimicrobial resistance and that these patterns change over time. Therefore it is necessary to monitor local patterns of resistance and to choose empiric therapy that is likely to be effective in a given clinical setting. 75 One other concept that has been incorporated into some studies of empiric therapy is that of \"antibiotic rotation,\" which means the standard empiric regimens are intentionally varied over time to expose bacteria to different antibiotics and thus minimize the selection pressure for resistance. In some studies this approach has been effective in reducing the incidence of infection with resistant organisms. 100 One limitation of antibiotic rotation is that it may mean the use of the same regimen repeatedly in the same patient, and this may itself be a risk factor for selecting for resistance. In addition, there are unanswered questions about how long each cycle of therapy should last, what agents should be cycled, how effective the approach is for medical versus surgical patients, and whether cycling should focus on gram-positive and gramnegative organisms. 101 Patients at risk for MDR pathogens generally require combination therapy rather than monotherapy. Combination therapy is most valuable because it provides broadspectrum coverage, thereby minimizing the chance of initially inappropriate therapy. Recent data have shown that combination therapy using an aminoglycoside with a \u03b2-lactam is no more effective than monotherapy with a \u03b2-lactam for severe infections including those caused by P. aeruginosa, but dual-pseudomonal therapy is still recommended for patients at risk for this pathogen in order to minimize the chance of initially ineffective therapy. 2, 82 The empiric therapy for patients at risk for MDR pathogens should include an aminoglycoside or quinolone (ciprofl oxacin or high-dose levofl oxacin) plus an anti-pseudomonal \u03b2-lactam (imipenem, meropenem, piperacillin/tazobactam, aztreonam, or cefepime). If the patient is at risk for a second ICU-acquired infection (and most are), it may be prudent to use an aminoglycoside for the fi rst episode of infection, reserving the quinolone for Box 43-4",

This could be either linezolid or vancomycin, and recent data have suggested the superiority of linezolid for both survival and clinical cure in patients who have been documented to have MRSA VAP. 103 Many patients with NP will get an initial empiric therapy that is broad-spectrum, and thus it is important to consider \"de-escalation\" of the initial regimen as serial clinical and microbiologic data become available (see Fig.  43-1) . 80 If the patient has received a broad-spectrum regimen and the cultures do not show MDR organisms, then the patient can fi nish therapy with any of six monotherapy regimens that have been documented to be effective for severe VAP, in the absence of MDR organisms: ciprofl oxacin, imipenem, meropenem, piperacillin/tazobactam, cefepime, and high-dose levofl oxacin. If P. aeruginosa is present, combination therapy with a \u03b2-lactam and aminoglycoside should continue for 5 days, after which the patient can be switched to monotherapy with an agent to which the organism is sensitive. 2 When deescalation has been used, meaning either the switch to a more narrow spectrum regimen, the use of fewer drugs, or both, mortality in VAP has been reduced, compared with when patients do not have de-escalation. 37, 38, 80 Many unrealized opportunities exist for using this approach in patients with P. aeruginosa infection and sensitive pathogens and in those with a good clinical response and negative respiratory tract cultures. 80 If the lower respiratory tract cultures are negative, it may be possible to stop therapy (especially if an alternative diagnosis is suspected) or to shorten the duration of therapy. In addition, if cultures show that the initial empiric regimen was appropriate and if the patient has a good clinical response (refl ected by a drop in the CPIS), then it may be possible to reduce the duration of therapy to as little as 7 to 8 days, although this may not be pos-sible if the etiologic pathogen is P. aeruginosa or MRSA. 104 Adjunctive therapeutic measures are necessary in some patients including chest physiotherapy, aerosolized bronchodilators, and mucolytic agents. For selected patients who are infected with highly resistant organisms and are not responding to systemic antibiotics, it may be valuable to add aerosolized antibiotics (e.g., gentamicin, tobramycin, colistin, ceftazidime). Aerosolized administration of antibiotics offers the advantage of achieving high concentrations of antibiotics at the site of infection. As a result, it may be possible to overcome the problems of poor lung penetration of certain agents (aminoglycosides) and provide the high levels of antibiotics that are necessary to kill certain resistant organisms. Locally administered antibiotics are rarely absorbed, and systemic toxicity is minimized. Despite these theoretical advantages, many effi cacy questions remain to be answered by clinical trials. Pending more information, locally instilled or aerosolized antibiotics are not usually recommended for routine treatment of pneumonia but may have a role as adjunctive therapy in patients with MDR organisms not responding to systemic therapy. 105 ",

Even for the patient who is recovering from CAP, immunization while in the hospital is appropriate to prevent future episodes of infection. The evaluation of all patients for vaccination need and the provision of information about smoking cessation are now performance standards used to evaluate the hospital care of CAP patients. If there is uncertainty about whether the patient has recently been vaccinated, it is probably best to give a pneumococcal vaccination because repeat administration, even more often than recommended, is not generally associated with an adverse reaction. 106 Hospital-based immunization is recommended. One study found that among 1633 patients with pneumonia treated in the hospital, 62% had been hospitalized in the preceding 4 years. 107 In addition, 80% of these patients had a high-risk condition that would have qualifi ed them to receive pneumococcal vaccine.

Recently, these interventions have been combined into \"ventilator bundles,\" which have been demonstrated to reduce the incidence of VAP if applied carefully. 108, 109 Most of these bundles include multiple interventions, so it is diffi cult to know which individual manipulations are most valuable. Successful bundles have included interventions such as elevation of the head of the bed to 30 degrees (to avoid the risk of aspiration present with the supine position), daily interruption of sedation to attempt weaning, peptic ulcer disease prophylaxis, endotracheal tube suctioning (possibly with a closed suction system), hand washing, careful oral care, and tight control of blood glucose. 110 Despite the success of this approach, one recent randomized study has demonstrated a lack of benefi t and feasibility of routine head-of-the-bed elevation. 111 Other widely used measures in mechanically ventilated patients are avoidance of large inocula of bacteria into the lung (careful handling of ventilator circuit tubing); mobilization of respiratory secretions (frequent suctioning, use of rotational bed therapy in selected individuals); nutritional support (enteral preferred over parenteral); placing of feeding tubes into the small bowel (to avoid aspiration, which is more likely with stomach tubes); and avoidance of large gastric residuals when giving enteral feeding. In addition, any tube inserted into the stomach or trachea should be inserted through the mouth and not the nose, whenever possible, to avoid obstructing the nasal sinuses and prevent nosocomial sinusitis, which can lead to NP. 110 A specially adapted endotracheal tube that allows for continuous aspiration of subglottic secretions may interrupt the oropharyngeal to tracheal transfer of bacteria and reduce the incidence of pneumonia. 112 Because endotracheal intubation is a risk for pneumonia, noninvasive positive pressure ventilation should be used whenever possible. This approach is associated with a lower pneumonia risk than traditional mechanical ventilation. Prophylactic systemic or topical antibiotics have no specifi c role, but some data suggest that patients with coma caused by stroke or head trauma and those who may have aspirated during an emergent intubation may benefi t from a 24-hour course of systemic antibiotics. 113 \"Selective digestive decontamination,\" which includes systemic and topical intestinal antibiotics, remains controversial as a method to reduce the incidence of pneumonia. Literature support exists in some selected populations. This approach carries the risk of promoting antibiotic resistance. 2",
