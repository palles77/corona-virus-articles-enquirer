Most people attempt to minimize contact with others, and move themselves to avoid crowds. This dispersal may be adaptive regarding the intensity of media coverage and the population numbers in different patches. We propose an epidemic model with such adaptive dispersal rates to examine how appropriate adaption can facilitate disease control in connected groups or patches. Assuming dependence of the adaptive dispersal on the total population in the relevant patches, we derived an expression for the basic reproduction number R 0 to be related to the intensity of media coverage, and we show that the disease-free equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable if R 0 < 1 , and it becomes unstable if R 0 > 1 . In the unstable case, we showed a uniform persistence of disease by using a perturbation theory and the monotone dynamics theory. Specifically, when the disease mildly affects the dispersal of infectious individuals and rarely induces death, a unique endemic equilibrium exists in the model, which is globally asymptotically stable in positive states. Moreover, we performed numerical calculations to explain how the intensity of media coverage causes competition among patches, and influences the final distribution of the population.",

Hethcote [1] is one of the pioneers who proposed epidemic models with population dispersal between two patches. Subsequently, numerous studies have contributed to investigations on the effect of population migration on the spread of disease, and to determining whether migration can increase disease persistence. When formulating such disease models with migration, the adoption of a constant or adaptive dispersal is considered.",

We examined SIS models with a constant dispersal rate in [ 2 , 3,4 ] . The main results include (1) establishing a threshold below which the disease becomes extinction and above which the disease persists and tends toward a certain level; and (2) identifying the effect of the dispersal rate on this critical value. From the designed examples, they revealed that, depending on other parameters in the system, changing the dispersal rate in a certain patch may either benefit or damage the capacity for disease control. However, the random behavior of each individual can be affected by change of the environment or social consideration. Accordingly, the authors in [4] proposed a compelling but unsolved problem in studying an epidemic model with a variable dispersal rate. In epidemiology, [5] is one of the few studies that examined adaptive dispersal among patches by applying mathematical models. Managing wildlife through culling, vaccination, and habitat management is efficient for disease control [6] . Therefore, the authors in [5] developed a mathematical model to describe the effect of increased movement caused by culling individuals. However, from a mathematical perspective, this model involves additional nonlinearity, and leaves the global dynamics of the endemic case unsolved.",

Recent studies [7, 8] have taken media coverage within a habitat into consideration to study epidemic problems. The present paper proposes an endemic model with density-dependent dispersal among patches by considering two facts: First, information on disease spread and the characteristics of pathogens is revealed through international organizations, such as the World Health Organization, and quickly communicated through media coverage, such as through television news, newspapers, Internet news, and mobile instant messaging. Education on the latent periods of disease typically results in individuals taking precautions against crowding and adopting social distancing. Second, animals have a natural reaction against disease, which possibly leads to blind escaping from crowding. In addition, the carrying capacity for a species within an area does not change according to the population number, and offspring must establish their own habitat [9] .",

Section 3 presents a calculation of the basic reproduction number of the connected patches, and a discussion on how media intensity influences this threshold value. To present a dynamic investigation in one model consistently, we treated a particular case and obtained global dynamics according to different levels of disease spread. In addition to the theoretical results regarding dynamical characteristics, we present examples to discuss changes in the population number concerning the strategy of adaption in Section 4 . This paper concludes by presenting a brief comparison of our results with those of other studies as well as a discussion on prediction concerns.",

In the absence of media effect, population disperse randomly; that is, individuals travel among patches with constant dispersal rates. When media coverage is taken into account, the density of population will affect the strategy of migration among patches. Naturally the adaptive dispersal rate is not only related to the alertness to the disease of individuals, but also closely related to the number of total population due to obscure symptoms in the initial infection. Therefore, we comprehend the population behaviors of escaping from crowds by two factors: the dispersal rate has positive (respectively, negative) functional response to the number of total population in the habitat (respectively, destination).

First, taking inner-elusion in patch-1 helps inner control of disease spread, but damages the disease control in patch-2. Hence, adopting adaptive dispersal in a patchy disease model represents competition of disease control between different patches. Second, for fixed positive b 21 , the population of infectious individuals I * 1 in patch-1 under linearly adaptive dispersal rate, is smaller than that under the case of nonlinear adaption. Therefore, it is more efficient to control disease by adopting linearly adaptive dispersal rather than nonlinearly adaptive dispersal.

It assumes a constant intensity, c ij , of media report in each patch. In fact, there may exists complicated process leading to the outbreak of a disease, and the intensity of media varies to reflect different levels of disease spread. Here, we review the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003 to see how the media report affected the strategy of dispersal between Mainland China and Taiwan, two patches which are connected mainly by airplanes, during the period of epidemic. We refer to the monthly data of the ratio of immigration among the total population reported by Department of Statistics, Ministry of the Interior, Taiwan [31] . Fig. 5 a depicts the effect of SARS on the number of immigration from Mainland China (patch-2) into Taiwan (patch-1). The dash curve represents the ratio of immigration for each month in 2002 by natural dispersal from Mainland China into Taiwan ( a 12 ), and the solid curve is the ratio of each month in 2003 effected by the impact of SARS. In Fig. 5 b, we calculate the intensity of adaption according to the data in Fig. 5 a and the mode of adaption (N ) with b 12 = 0 , for focusing on the role of c 12 . According to the report of World Health Organization, the first onset of SARS in Taiwan happened at 2003 March 13, and the broad spread begun around mid-April and ended at mid-June [32] . The intensity of adaption in Fig. 5 b, which reveals larger values from April to July, agrees with the period of outbreak of SARS. Therefore, the intensity of media influence varies to reflect different levels of disease spread and the dispersal rate of population between Mainland China and Taiwan does change and depend on the intensity of media report.",

(ii) When the disease is a pandemic (i.e., R 0 > 1 ), increasing the intensity of media coverage can substantially reduce the number of infectious individuals at the endemic equilibrium, and reveals competition for disease control in different patches. (From Fig. 2 and 3 ) (iii) When R 0 > 1 , applying the strategy of media coverage results in a considerable reduction in the time for disease extinction in local patch, but substantially reduces the total population of the patch that executes the policy. (From Fig. 4 ) (iv) By applying the same intensity of media coverage, the amount of both compartments in different patches synchronizes over time. (From Fig. 4 ) Unanswered questions concerning the general model (2.1) remain. For example, does the model possibly involve multiple endemic equilibria? Can it exhibit a periodic state through Hopf bifurcation? Time delay is another intrinsic characteristic in biological systems. In [33] , oscillations can be induced by disease related death in a model with maturation delay. A question arises in (2.1) that if there exists an oscillation caused by the time delay from the transmission of media information. In addition, diseases without a latent period exist, and individuals move to avoid those with symptoms",
