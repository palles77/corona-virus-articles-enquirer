While humanity finds antibiotics incredibly useful in our battle against infectious disease, bacteria did not create them for our benefit. Instead, they make antibiotics to kill off other bacteria that are competing for the same habitat or resources. Similarly, bacteria synthesize toxic proteins known as bacteriocins to kill their relatives because closely related strains of bacteria are likelier to compete with each other. For example, many strains of Escherichia coli deploy a wide variety of bacteriocins (referred to as colicins) intended to kill other strains of E. coli. The genes for colicins are normally carried on plasmids, and many of these plasmids are commonly used in molecular biology and genetic engineering (see Chapter 3). Yersinia pestis, the plague bacterium, also makes bacteriocins (called pesticins in this case) designed to kill competing strains of its own species ( Fig. 22 .1).",

Bacteria deploy bacteriocins against their fellow-often closely related-bacteria with the deliberate intention of killing them. In contrast, proteins produced by bacteria that act against higher organisms are referred to as toxins. Perhaps counterintuitively, pathogenic bacteria do not usually \"intend\" to kill the organisms they infect. Rather, they want to manipulate them long enough to survive and reproduce. The longer the host stays alive, the longer it provides a home for the infecting bacteria. Just like antibiotics, some bacterial toxins are useful to humans. The bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis produces an insect-killing toxin that is harmless to vertebrates, and this \"Bt toxin\" has been used extensively in genetically modified crops. (See Chapter 15.) Lower eukaryotes also regularly engage in biological warfare. Paramecium, a ciliated protozoan, carries symbiotic bacteria (Caedibacter) known as kappa particles that grow and divide inside the larger eukaryotic cell (Fig. 22 .2).",

There are many reasons why bacteria have developed this resistance, but all of the explanations have one thing in common: the proliferation and misuse of antibiotics. For instance, medical doctors often prescribe antibiotics to patients who have an infection, even if it is unknown whether the disease is bacterial. Other times, the wrong antibiotic is prescribed. In many developing countries, antibiotics can be bought over the counter without a prescription. Compounding the dilemma, patients who receive antibiotics often do not comply with the recommended dose, ending treatment as soon as they feel better. This has the effect of selecting for the survival of the bacteria that have already developed a slight resistance to the drug. When the patient propagates the infection, he unintentionally passes on these toughened survivors. The widespread use of antibiotics in animal feed-which farmers use to fatten up livestock-is also a major contributor to the problem. There have been reports from around the world of totally drug-resistant tuberculosis, which as the name implies, appears to be resistant to all treatment. In a 2013 report, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued an urgent warning about infections from (1) Clostridium difficile, which causes diarrhea and is often acquired by patients in healthcare settings who were treated with antibiotics for other infections;",

Because several properly functioning binding subunits are required to deliver the active subunit, one approach to antitoxin therapy relies on utilizing dominant-negative mutations in the binding subunit of the toxin. The mechanism involves the binding of a defective protein subunit to functional subunits resulting in a complex that is inactive overall. (The term dominant-negative refers to mutations in which an abnormal gene product sabotages the activity of the wild-type gene product. Consequently, most dominant-negative mutations affect proteins with multiple subunits.) Dominant-negative mutations have been deliberately isolated in the B protein (called the \"protective antigen\") of anthrax toxin. Mixing mutant subunits with wild-type ones resulted in the assembly of inactive heptamers that bind the A subunits (called \"lethal factor\" and \"edema factor\") of anthrax toxin. As a result, the toxic A subunits cannot be transported into target cells ( Fig. 22.8 ).

Today, biological warfare is feared less from nations and more from terrorist groups or \"lone wolves.\" But there is disagreement over just how much of a threat this poses. Many believe that terrorists would be incapable of carrying out an effective, largescale biological attack. For instance, in 1984, the Rajneesh cult gave food poisoning to about 750 citizens of a small Oregon town for political purposes by adding Salmonella to salad bars. Aum Shinrikyo, a Japanese cult that perpetrated a sarin gas attack in the Tokyo subway in 1995, experimented with biological weapons, but to no avail.

Also, vaccines have side effects. Consider the anthrax vaccine used by the U.S. army that was approved in 1971. Vaccination requires six inoculations plus annual boosters.

However, recent experiments with mousepox (Ectromelia virus) have given disturbing results. Mousepox is related to smallpox, but it only infects mice. Its virulence varies greatly depending on the strain of mouse. Genetically resistant mice rely on cell-mediated immunity, rather than antibodies. Natural killer (NK) cells and cytotoxic T cells destroy cells infected with mousepox virus, thus clearing the virus from the body. Researchers modified mousepox virus by inserting the human gene for the cytokine interleukin-4 (IL-4). IL-4 is known to stimulate the division of B cells, which synthesize antibodies. The rationale for engineering the virus was that IL-4 would stimulate the production of geographus, stabs fish with a venom-filled \"harpoon\" located in its proboscis (Fig. 22.25) .",

This approach could detect 5 to 10 particles of a biological warfare agent.

Channels for sodium ions are incorporated into the membrane. When the ion channels are open, sodium ions flow across the membrane and a current is generated in the gold electrode. The ion channels consist of two modules, each spanning half the membrane. When top and bottom modules are united, the ion channel is open. When the top module is pulled away, the ion channel cannot operate. Binding of biological warfare agents by the antibody fragments separates the two halves of the channels, which in turn affects the electrical signal ( Fig. 22.33 ). ",
