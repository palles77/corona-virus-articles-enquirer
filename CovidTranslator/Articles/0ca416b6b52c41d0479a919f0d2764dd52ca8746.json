It is suspected that, driven by buoyancy force, the polluted air that exits the window of the lower floor may re-enter the immediate upper floor through the window on the same side. This cascade effect has been quantified and reported in a previous paper, and it is found that, by tracer gas concentration analysis, the room in the adjacent upstairs may contain up to 7% of the air directly from the downstairs room. In this study, after validation against the experimental data from literatures, Eulerian and Lagrangian approaches are both adopted to numerically investigate the dispersion of expiratory aerosols between two vertically adjacent flats. It is found that the particle concentration in the upper floor is two to three orders of magnitude lower than in the source floor. 1.0 mm particles disperse like gaseous pollutants. For coarse particles larger than 20.0 mm, strong deposition on solid surfaces and gravitational settling effect greatly limit their upward transport.",

A few studies attempted to combine epidemiologic investigations with airflow analysis, but the airflow analysis remained to be preliminary [1, 2] . In the investigation of the outbreak in a high-rise residential estate in Hong Kong, the CFD simulation did indicate that the transmission pattern between adjacent high-rise blocks qualitatively agrees with the wind direction. In the related study aiming to reveal the vertical transmission pattern in one building, multi-zone modeling technique was employed, which had inadequacies in modeling airflow through large window openings [3] . Niu and Tung [4] used on-site tracer gas measurement to experimentally investigate the re-entry possibility of exhaust air from the lower floor into the immediate upper floor for high-rise residential buildings with single-sided natural ventilation conditions (Fig. 1) . It was revealed that the upstairs room may contain 7% of the exhaust air from the lower floor, which can help explain the presence of SARS-CoV RNA found on the window sill deposits in the upstairs of an index patient. Gao et al.'s [5] CFD study on the dispersion of one tracer gas agrees with the on-site measurement. With the help of the Wells-Riley infection risk model, Gao et al. [5] estimated the vertical cross-household infection risk in the upper floor using the data of tuberculosis. It was found that a significant infection risk up to 6% for the upstairs residents can be resulted in, when merely assuming an 8 h continuous stay at home.",

            "text": "On the other hand, recent systematic reviews [6, 7] concluded that person to person respiratory virus transmission could occur in three possible modes: airborne transmission, droplet transmission, and direct contact with secretions (or fomites). Currently, by droplets transmission it is meant short-distance (usually less than 1 m) transmission via large droplets (X5 mm diameter) generated during coughing, sneezing, or talking, and by airborne transmission it is meant long-distance transmission via the dissemination of virus-laden droplet nuclei (particles less than 5 mm that result from the evaporation of large droplets). But whether the three transmission modes are mutually exclusive and which mode is the most significant transmission route for a particular disease are debatable. In general, it is believed that respiratory droplets movements in the room air play a key role for airborne transmitted diseases. Arguably, airborne transmission does not necessarily cause long range infections since a wide range of other confounding factors are also playing important roles, and these include the shedding rate, viability and infectiousness of the pathogen and the wind, temperature and humidity conditions. In general, aerosol dynamics differs from gaseous pollutants due to the effects of gravity, inertia and deposition at solid surfaces. Therefore, as a companion paper of Gao et al. [5] , which studied the airflow and gaseous pollutants between vertically adjacent floors, this study simulates the transport possibilities of droplet residuals by using both Lagrangian and Eulerian methods. The aim is to explore whether the virus-laden aerosols could be carried upward by inter-flat airflows between floors in high-rise residential buildings when the gravity and surface deposition effects are considered.",

The convection terms are discretized by second order upwind scheme and the diffusion term by central difference also with second-order accuracy. The variables at the near-wall cells and the corresponding quantities on the wall are bridged by the standard logarithmic law wall function. The turbulent effect is modeled by the RNG k-e model [9] . Although large eddy simulation (LES) has been adopted to investigate wind field and indoor-outdoor airflows due to its capacity of handling the unsteadiness and intermittency of the flow as well as providing detailed information on the turbulence structure, the RANS models are extensively used in industrial and engineering practice because they generally use about one order of magnitude less CPU time than LES while keeping an acceptable accuracy.",

If particle loadings are even higher than 10 \u00c03 , particleparticle interaction becomes important [10] . Since indoor particulate levels normally vary from several to hundreds of mg/m 3 (about 10 5 -10 7 particles/m 3 ) the two-phase flow can be deemed as dilute systems and one-way coupling is rational. A single-phase turbulence model can be used to represent the mixture.",

            "text": "In both numerical approaches, all particles are assumed to be spherical. Particle coagulation, reflection at walls, re-suspension, and phase-change such as evaporation, which may actually occur in indoor environments, are ignored. According to Hinds [11] , coagulation rate is proportional to the square of the number concentration. Supposing a diameter of 1.0 mm and a concentration of 10 7 particles per m 3 , 1% decrement of particle number concentration needs about 500 days. This time scale is much larger than the indoor airflow time scale in that the indoor air can be renewed several times per hour. Particles' bounce back from a solid surface is influenced by particle size, surface material, orientation, initial momentum and even electrostatic forces. Fine particles have a strong probability to stick on the solid surfaces, especially on those made of synthetic fibers [12] . Morawska [13] demonstrated that pure water droplets may completely evaporate within 0.003 and 0.3 s for 1 and 10 mm droplets respectively, at a condition of 80% relative humidity (RH). These periods are much shorter than their settling time, the indoor airflow time scale, and even shorter than the sneezing and coughing processes (around 0.5 s). Nicas et al. [14] suggested that evaporation from respiratory particles with an initial diameter less than 20 mm be treated as an instantaneous process. The droplets produced from sneezing and coughing could have a significant amount of pathogens-carrying residues. The equilibrium diameter of the desiccated particles is generally estimated to be around one-half of its initial diameter [14] . Small pathogenscarrying particles (diameter less than 10 mm) can reach the alveolar region with a different efficiency, posing an infection risk for a susceptible person [11] . Based on this information, in this study we simulated the movements of particles with diameter of 1, 10, and 20 mm.",

The third term in Eq. (1) represents the additional forces exerted on the particles. In the current study, Brownian force, and Saffman's Lift force are taken into account in that they may be significant for fine particles. Thermophoretic force is included as well to reflect the non-isothermal condition. As the density ratio between particles and air is in the order of O(10 3 ), other forces, such as Basset force, pressure gradient force, virtual mass force, are neglected because their fraction inF addi is infinitesimal [17] . Detailed descriptions of these forces are available in the Fluent manual [8] . The effect of turbulence on particle dispersion is modeled by using a stochastic method, i.e. the discrete random walk (DRW) model to simulate the fluctuating velocity. Stochastic realizations of turbulence have been successfully applied in many works [18, 19] . The DRW model assumes turbulence is isotropic and the random velocity fluctuations follow a Gaussian probability distribution:",

In the pure-buoyancy driven case, the ACHs through the windows are highest for both floors. A gentle approaching wind of 1.0 m/s normal to the window has very little influence on the ACH. However, 4.0 m/s wind could lower the ACH by 30-50% by suppressing the buoyancy force. In the windless situation, 7.5% of the air leaving from the window of the lower floor can re-enter into the upper floor. 1.0 m/s wind deflates the plume emitted from the lower window into the upper window, resulting in a higher re-entry ratio (10.9%). But 4.0 m/s wind confines the convection of air and thus reduces the ratio to 3.5%.",

The results of 10.0 and 20.0 mm particles differ from the 1.0 mm particle remarkably. Different from gaseous pollutants, two factors constrain the cascade effect of coarse particles: the particle' gravity which counteracts with the upward buoyancy force and the deposition at solid surfaces. The latter one is a self-cleaning mechanism of particles which contributes to the decreased suspended concentrations in the lower floor and the reduced outlet concentrations. For an approximate estimation of particle' settling effect, the ratio of two time scales is indicative: the time required by the particle to settle down across the room height and the time needed to refresh the total volume of room air once [31] . For the current air change rate of 7.2-10.1 h \u00c01 , the ratio of the falling time of 2.7 m (room height) for particles larger than 15 mm to the air change time is comparable. As wind speed increases from 0.1 to 4.0 m/s, the windward airflow field simulated by the k-e model becomes more diffusiondominated. The ratio of particle concentration in the upper floor to that in the lower floor decreases. In case of 4.0 m/s, the ratio is 0.3% for 20.0 mm particles. It implies that in the design of ventilation and air distribution systems, the indoor air speed level is essential to determine the suspension of particles in the room air. Air at higher speeds could entrain larger particles, and even makes deposited particles re-suspended. Although, according to the deposition model by Lai and Nazaroff [25] , high friction velocity in the boundary layer will also increase the deposition velocity, this effect is negligible for particles larger than 2.5 mm because deposition onto the upward facing surfaces caused by gravitational force constitutes most of the overall deposition.",

In spite of the different definitions of the ''ratio'' in the two approaches, excluding the factor that some particles may enter into the upper floor and then move out of the same floor through the window, the particulate mass in the upper floor predicted by the DRW model is still lower than that by the drift-flux model. Fig. 8 shows that the discrepancy becomes large for fine particles, and small for coarse particles. For a close view of the results from the DRW model, Table 2 gives the numbers of deposited particles in both flats. Even for 1.0 mm particles, more than 70% of the particles have been predicted to be absorbed by the inner surfaces of the lower flat. This result is obviously irrational. Therefore in current settings, the application of the DRW model may falsely give us an overoptimistic result with regard to the upward transport of viruses by natural ventilation airflows. In the best case when wind velocity is 4.0 m/s, three out of 8000 particles of 20.0 mm can get into the upper floor. In terms of infection risk, this may still be indicative, given that one infected person may sneeze several times and one sneeze produces more than one million particles [37] . In principle, the Lagrangian method has an advantage to track the trajectory of each particle. Fig. 9 shows the locations of 500 representative particles at various times after their generations. In less than 3 min, particles could enter the space of the upper floor. This may well explain the epidemiologic findings that the SARS virus was found within the deposits on the window-sill above the room whose host was infected during the SARS outbreak in Hong Kong.",

Particles smaller than 24 mm make up about 90% of the total aerosol numbers, while particles greater than 24 mm contain more than 90% of the total aerosol mass. It remains unclear how many pathogens of some airborne diseases such as SARS are carried in each of the particle size bin.
