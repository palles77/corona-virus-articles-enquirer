However, the antigenic properties of this N protein are largely unknown. To facilitate the studies on the function and antigenicity of the SARS-CoV N protein, 6\u00d7 histidine-tagged recombinant SARS-CoV N (rSARS-N) with a molecular mass of 46 and 48 kDa was successfully produced using the recombinant baculovirus system in insect cells. The rSARS-N expressed in insect cells (BrSARS-N) showed remarkably higher specificity and immunoreactivity than rSARS-N expressed in E. coli (ErSARS-N). Most of all, BrSARS-N proteins were expressed as a highly phosphorylated form with a molecular mass of 48 kDa, but ErSARS-N was a nonphosphorylated protein. In further analysis to determine the correlation between the phosphorylation and the antigenicity of SARS-N protein, dephosphorylated SARS-N protein treated with protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) remarkably enhanced the cross-reactivity against SARS negative serum and considerably reduced immunoreactivity with SARS-N mAb. These results suggest that the phosphorylation plays an important role in the immunoreactivity and specificity of SARS-N protein. Therefore, the BrSARS-N protein may be useful for the development of highly sensitive and specific assays to determine SARS infection and for further research of SARS-N pathology.",

Antibodies to the SARS-N protein are highly detectable in SARS patients, and the antigenicity of SARS-N protein is better than that of the SARS-CoV spike (SARS-S) protein (Chan et al., 2005a,b; Shi et al., 2003; Wu et al., 2004) . Furthermore, the N proteins are capable of inducing protective immune responses against SARS-CoV infection (Kim et al., 2004) . These features make it a suitable candidate for the development of diagnostic agents, and possibly subunit vaccines. Because the SARS-N gene contains no glycosylation sites (Marra et al., 2003) , SARS-N proteins have been expressed mostly in E. coli (ErSARS-N proteins) for use as a diagnostic reagent. However, some cross-reactive responses of this recombinant protein with the antibodies against other coronaviruses have been detected by Western blot and ELISA (Sun and Meng, 2004; Woo et al., 2004; Yu et al., 2005) . Since serum antibodies against the other coronaviruses are widespread within the human population (Hruskova et al., 1990; Schmidt et al., 1986) , it is important to clear the antigenic properties of this recombinant protein.",

Therefore, we examined the antigenic specificity of BrSARS-N protein compared with ErSARS-N using an indirect ELISA on five SARS positive sera and 180 SARS negative sera. ErSARS-N protein included for comparison in the present study was expressed in the same cDNA construct at the ORF of BrSARS-N protein. This protein was previously observed to be cross-reactive with SARS negative serum (Sun and Meng, 2004; Woo et al., 2004; Yu et al., 2005) . In reactions in which equal amounts of each rSARS-N protein were coated onto ELISA plates, higher specificity was observed in the BrSARS-N protein than in the ErSARS- N protein. Thirty-four of the 180 SARS negative sera showed OD 450 values higher than 0.500, ranging from 0.500 to 1.000 in ErSARS-N-based ELISA. In contrast, when the BrSARS-N protein was used, only four of 180 SARS negative sera showed OD 450 values below 0.400 (data not shown). To further analyze the specificity of rSARS-N protein, we chose five SARS negative sera that had showed high OD 450 values (>0.500) on ErSARS-N-based ELISA. The specificity of rSARS-N protein was confirmed by indirect ELISA (Fig. 2A) and Western blotting using these negative sera and five SARS positive sera. For positive serum, ErSARS-N protein showed strong positive bands at approximately 46 kDa, while BrSARS-N protein showed two major antigenic bands of approximately 46 and 48 kDa (Fig. 2B,  left panel) . For negative serum, all of the five negative sera showed a strong false-positive reaction with ErSARS-N protein at the same size band of 46 kDa as result of SARS positive serum, while none of the five negative sera showed false-positive reactions at the two major antigenic bands of BrSARS-N protein (Fig. 2B, right panel) . This result indicated that the high value in indirect ELISA using ErSARS-N protein was not to the result of the potential interaction between residual E. coli antigens and antibodies against E. coli in human serum. Thus, the ErSARS-N protein has a higher cross-reactivity with SARS negative serum than BrSARS-N protein.",

There was no decrease in the intensity of the asterisk band indicating contaminated protein from insect cells during purification of recombinant protein (Fig. 5A, upper panel) , which suggests that the enzyme specifically removed only the phosphate residues from the protein. In addition, a shift of the 48 kDa bands was observed, with a drop to a lower mass of 46 kDa after treatment with PP1 (Fig. 5A, upper panel) ; the two isoforms were confirmed as SARS-N protein by Western blot using SARS-N mAbs (Fig. 5A, middle panel) . This result indicated that the isoforms of 48 kDa and 46 kDa in BrSARS-N protein represent the phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated form, respectively. These data also revealed that isoforms of 48 kDa were expressed more abundantly than isoforms of 46 kDa (Figs. 1B and 5A), and suggested that BrSARS-N protein is highly phosphorylated in insect cells. This feature of BrSARS-N protein may be the cause of greater immunoreactivity and specificity than that expressed in the prokaryotic system, as shown in Figs. 2 and 3 .",

In the present study, BrSARS-N was also contained within these Ntermini, and all of the human serum samples used in this study contained high titers (approximately 1:320 HAI unit) of antibodies against human coronavirus OC43 and 229E (data not shown). The BrSARS-N protein showed little cross-reactivity with SARS negative sera in Western blot analysis as well as indirect ELISA.

However, the BrSARS-N and ErSARS-N proteins were showed different levels of antigenicity in the present study. The differential antigenicity of both rSARS-N proteins was demonstrated by Western blot under denaturing conditions, and did not result from the conformation of SARS-N protein. The phosphorylation of N protein is a well-documented phenomenon in many coronaviruses (Calvo et al., 2005; Chen et al., 2005; Surjit et al., 2005; Wilbur et al., 1986; Zakhartchouk et al., 2005) . Given that this phosphorylation event is restricted to the eukaryotic system, the ErSARS-N protein would have properties different from those of the native N protein. In contrast with the prokaryotic expression system, the baculovirus-insect cell expression system can provide this type of post-translational modification similarly to that of mammalian cells. In the present study, the BrSARS-N protein was abundantly phosphorylated. This suggests that this N protein may have similar antigenicity to that of the native N protein. Therefore, we investigated whether the phosphorylation of SARS-N protein could affect the cross-reactivity with SARS negative serum and immunoreactivity with SARS-N antibodies.",

These previous reports suggest that the phosphorylation is closely related to the antigenicity of recombinant protein. In this study, we were able to observe that the phosphorylated BrSARS-N protein shows little cross-response with SARS negative serum under denaturing conditions, but BrSARS-N protein dephosphorylated by PP1 remarkably enhance a false-positive reaction against SARS negative serum. This probably occurs because the phosphorylation at conserved epitopes may inhibit non-specific binding of crossreacting antibodies, which may result in higher specificity of the BrSARS-N protein than the ErSARS-N protein. Therefore, these data indicate that phosphorylation is required for preservation of the antigenic specificity of SARS-N protein under denaturing conditions. Although phosphorylated BrSARS-N protein showed a higher specificity than nonphosphorylated ErSARS-N protein under denaturing conditions, the BrSARS-N proteins in Western blot analysis under native condition showed high antigenic cross-reactivity with SARS negative serum, similar to that shown by ErSARS-N protein (data not shown). This result indicates that some conformational epitopes of SARS-N protein might cause the cross-response with SARS negative serum; this occurs independently upon the phosphorylation of SARS-N protein. Thus, the use of phosphorylation BrSARS-N protein in Western blot analysis under denaturing conditions would be more suitable for use in SARS serology than compared to other diagnostic methods. Furthermore, SARS negative and positive serum could be clearly distinguished by indirect ELISA using BrSARS-N protein under physiological conditions, similar to that observed for Western blot under denaturing conditions. SARS-N protein containing no cysteine residues and no disulphide bonds would be less stable than other structural proteins of SARS-CoV and the surface of microtiter plate used in indirect ELISA is highly charged. Therefore, the conformational epitopes of SARS-N against cross-reacting antibodies may be destroyed by the surface of the plate, and/or cross-reacting epitopes may be hidden by the surface. As ELISA-based serology is less labor-intensive and easier to standardize than Western blot assay, Western blot confirmation of positive ELISA results is probably a better choice for routine use in clinical laboratories.",

Indeed, the immunoreactivity of BrSARS-N protein was remarkably reduced when this protein was dephosphorylated with PP1, which suggests a correlation between the phosphorylation and the antigenic reactivity of SARS-N protein. Since coronavirus N proteins exist as phosphorylated forms in mature viral particles and most of the SARS-N proteins expressed in eukaryotic cells are highly phosphorylated (Surjit et al., 2005; Wilbur et al., 1986; Zakhartchouk et al., 2005) , the major antibodies against N protein in SARS patients may be those that act against the phosphorylated form.

We can also demonstrate that phosphorylation of the N protein plays an important role in the antigenicity and specificity of SARS-N protein. Therefore, it is believed that the BrSARS-N protein may be a more suitable antigen for the development of sensitive and specific diagnostic methods than ErSARS-N protein, and will be useful in further investigations of SARS-N pathology.",

Uninfected (lane 1) and infected cells with a recombinant baculovirus expressing the full-length SARS-N gene of the SARS-CoV Urbani strain (lane 2) were collected at 48 h post-infection. Cell lysates were analyzed in a 10% SDS-PAGE gel and revealed with Coomassie brilliant blue staining, revealing a major 46 and 48 kDa band expressed in insect cell-infected recombinant baculovirus. (B) Western blot analysis of purified SARS-N protein. The purified recombinant proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE (lane 1) and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (lane 2).The membrane was incubated with SARS-N mAbs, followed by HRP-conjugated anti-mouse IgG, and detected by chemiluminescence staining. A strong immunoreactive band and a minor band were detected at 48 and 46 kDa, respectively, suggesting that those proteins are SARS-N proteins. (C) The comparison of mass differences among BrSARS-N, ErSARS-N, and MrSARS-N protein by SDS-PAGE analysis. This result revealed that BrSARS-N was showed to a similar mass pattern with MrSARS-N protein, but molecular weight of ErSARS-N protein was slightly lower than BrSARS-N and MrSARS-N.",
