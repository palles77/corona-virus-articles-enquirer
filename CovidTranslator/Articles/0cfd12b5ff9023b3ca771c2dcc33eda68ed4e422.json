Maximum neutralising antibody concentration was found to coincide with the second protein peak. Lower level activity was found in the first peak and in the trough between the first and second peaks. These higher molecular weight neutralising components probably correspond to 7 S IgG complexes, IgA or IgM. Feline serum and peritoneal fluid from FIP infected cats showed similar profiles. The optical density of the second peak was extremely high in FIP cases as a result of hypergammaglobulinaemia, a characteristic of the disease. This peak contained high levels of neutralising activity in both serum and peritoneal fluids as shown in Figures 2 and 3 . Very little activity was found in the first peak region and it was not affected by DTT. No activity was found in the third peak. Pooled fractions from the second peaks of both feline serum and peritoneal fluid were adsorbed with sheep anti-cat IgG. Before adsorption immunoeleetrophoresis of both samples (Fig. 4) showed a single precipitin arc of IgG, using sheep anti-eat IgG as precipitating antiserum. TGEV neutralising titres of 2,825 for fehne serum and 710 for peritoneal fluid were recorded. However, after adsorption both titres were reduced to less than 20 and the IgG preeipitin lines were lost completely. ",

DTT did not destroy the TGEV neutralising activity, although it was shown to be fully effective under the conditions used, by the effect on the IgM in the bovine serum tested. Thus the aetivity demonstrated ia feline fluids was unJikely to be a macroglobulin. Feline sera and peritoneal fluids were not more affected by kaolin absorption than specific antibody. Most non-specific inhibitors, such as that described for avian infectious bronchitis virus (9) , are affected by one or more of these methods. As pretreatment of cells was not effective it is unlikely that the activity was mediated by interferonlike substanees.
