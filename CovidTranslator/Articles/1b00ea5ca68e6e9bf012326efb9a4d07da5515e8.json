Initial rates of ascorbate uptake were diminished by lowering the external concentrations of either Ca 2 \u00a7 or Na \u00a7 The Na*-dependence of astroglial ascorbate uptake gave Hill coefficients of approximately 2, consistent with a Na+-ascorbate cotransport system having stoichiometry of 2 Na \u00a7 ascorbate anion. Raising external K \u00a7 concentration incrementally from 5.4 to 100 mM, so as to depolarize the plasma membrane, decreased the initial rate of ascorbate uptake, with the degree of inhibition depending on the level of K \u00a7 The depolarizing ionophores gramicidin and nystatin slowed ascorbate uptake by astrocytes incubated in 5.4 mM K+; whereas, the nondepolarizing ionophore valinomycin did not. Qualitatively similar results were obtained whether or not astrocytes were pretreated with dibutyryl cyclic AMP (0.25 mM for 2 weeks) to induce stellation. These data are consistent with the existence of an electrogenic Na \u00a7 cotransport system through which the rate of ascorbate uptake is modulated by endogenous agents, such as K \u00a7 that alter astroglial membrane potential.",

In vivo, cerebral ascorbate concentration is controlled by secretory and transport mechanisms of brain cells (15) . Type-1 astrocytes are an abundant glial cell type comprising approximately 30% of brain volume. We showed previously that type-1 astrocytes from both rat and mouse brains possess a concentrative L-ascorbate uptake mechanism. Initial rate of ascorbate uptake saturated with increasing external ascorbate concentration, reflecting a high affinity interaction that could be described by Michaelis-Menten kinetics (17) . Uptake was also dependent on external Na + concentration (17) and was inhibited by nonpermeant anion transport inhibitors (18) , indicating that the ascorbate transporter is located in the plasma membrane. Preincubation with ouabain inhibited the initial rate of ascorbate uptake (17) . Since ouabain inhibits the Na +, K + ATPase that maintains transmembrane Na + and K + gradients, a possible explanation for this observation is that ouabain reduces the electrical potential across the membrane which, if the stoichiometry is more than one Na \u00a7 per ascorbate, would lead to inhibition of ascorbate influx.",

Comparisons between mean values based on a single level of treatment (e.g. initial rate of ascorbate uptake by cells incubated with or without external Ca z+) were evaluated using paired t-tests. For simultaneous comparisons of two or more treatments, differences between means were evaluated using repeated measures analysis of variance and the Tukey-Kramer test (26) .

However, qualitatively similar effects of Ca 2+, Na +, K +, and ionophores were obtained whether or not astrocytes were pretreated with dibutyryl cyclic AMP to change their morphology from polygonal to steIlate cells. The initial rates of ascorbate uptake were diminished by lowering the external concentrations of either Ca + or Na +. Approximately 30% of initial ascorbate uptake was inhibited under conditions of low external free Ca 2+ (Table I ). In contrast, removal of external Na + inhibited the initial rate of ascorbate uptake by approximately 90% (Table I) . Kinetic analysis of the relationship between Na + concentration and the rate of ascorbate uptake was carried out. Estimates of maximal uptake velocity (Vm~,) in the presence of 5 IxM external ascorbate were obtained from two linearizations of the data.

In the present study, we provide evidence that Na + and ascorbate are cotransported with a stoichiometry of greater than one Na + per ascorbate anion, predicting an electrogenic transport activity (Figure 1) . To test this possibility, the effects on ascorbate uptake of agents known to alter membrane potential were examined. Raising external K + incrementally from 5.4 to 100 raM, so as to depolarize the plasma membrane, immediately decreased the initial rate of ascorbate uptake, with the degree of inhibition depending on the concentration of K + (Figure 2 ). In contrast, control addition of NMG + chloride to the medium, to increase osmolality without increasing K \u00a7 concentration, did not affect ascorbate uptake. Uptake rates in medium containing 138 mM Na + and 5.4 mM K + were 90+13 and 168+35 nmol/g protein/rain in polygonal and stellate astrocytes, respectively, and adding 95 mM NMG + chloride to this medium yielded ascorbate uptake rates of 91+ 10 and 142+_28 nmol/g protein/min in polygonal and stellate astrocytes, respectively (mean _+ SEM of four independent experiments performed in triplicate).",

(29) reported coefficients nearer to unity (1.1 with 25 ~M ascorbate and 1.4 with 200 ~xM ascorbate in the medium) for bovine adrenomedullary cells. Another respect in which ascorbate transport by astrocytes and adrenomedullary cells differs is that lowering external Na + concentration decreases the apparent Vm~ of ascorbate uptake in astrocytes (17) but not in adrenomedullary cells (29) . Using bovine adrenomedullary cells, Diliberto et al. (29) observed that simultaneously lowering external Na + and raising K + concentrations decreased ascorbate uptake. However, this effect was attibuted mostly to Na + substitution. In the present experiments, KC1 was added to the medium, instead of substituting K + for Na +, so as not to disturb external Na + concentration. The effect of increased osmolality on ascorbate uptake was found to be neglible when assessed by addition of NMG + chloride to the medium. The high permeability of astrocytes to K +, however, renders their membrane potential virtually a K + equilibrium potential and sensitive, therefore, to alterations in the external concentration of this cation (30, 31) . In situ, K + released by discharging neurons may act as a signal to adjacent astrocytes and selectively alter certain transport activities (31, 32) . Those transport activities that are sensitive to K + may be identified through studies of cultured astrocytes, which already have shown that raising K + to 20 mM increases 2-deoxyglucose uptake (33, 34) but has no effect on sorbitol uptake (35) . The present experiments indicate that high K + inhibits the rate of clearance of ascorbate from the extracellular fluid into astrocytes (Figure 2 ). Periods of neuronal firing activity such as occur during seizures can elevate extracellular K + to 10-12 mM (36-38) and may thereby alter astroglial ascorbate transport.",

Based on those observations, it would be predicted that 55 mM K + would depolarize the membrane to about -20 mV and 100 mM K + to about -5 inV. Therefore, the electrical gradient favoring Na+-ascorbate uptake would be largely dissipated at 55-100 mM external K + concentration. We found that, under these conditions, the initial rate of ascorbate uptake was decreased by approximately one-half ( Figure  2) . Similarly, abolition of the membrane potential by nystatin or gramicidin (28) , reduced the initial rate of ascorbate uptake by approximately one-half ( Figure 3 ). It may be concluded that membrane potential contributes significantly to the mechanism that mediates concentrative Na+-ascorbate uptake by astrocytes.",
