The number of cases continues to grow exponentially reaching 492,000 people in 175 countries as of March 25, 2020. 22,169 people (~4.5%) infected with SARS-COV-2 virus have died. We have developed an exponential regression model using the COVID-19 case data (Jan 22 -Mar 22, 2020). Our primary model uses designated Phase 1 countries, who exceed 2500 cases on Mar 22. The model is then applied to Phase 2 countries: those that escaped the initial Phase 1 global expansion of COVID-19. With the exception of stabilizing countries (South Korea, Japan, and Iran) all Phase 1 countries are growing exponentially, as per 2500 ( ) = 120.4 \u00d7 0.238 , with a rate, r = 0.238 \u00b1 0.068. Excluding China, the BRICS developing nations and Australia are in Phase 2. Case data from Phase 2 countries are following the model derived from Phase 1 countries. In the absence of measures employed to flatten the curve including social distancing, quarantine, and healthcare expansion, our model projects over 274,000 cases and 12,300 deaths in the US by Mar 31. India can expect 123,000 cases by April 16. By flattening the curve to the growth rate of stabilizing countries (r = 0.",

These models may be stochastic in nature, creating probability distributions by moving about random variables, or deterministic in nature, compartmentalizing the population across various groups. The Susceptible Exposed Infectious Recovered (SEIR) model is a widely utilized mathematical model in the COVID-19 outbreak 14 . Liu et al reviewed the models of 12 studies which calculated the basic reproductive number (R0) of the SARS-COV-2 virus 15 . The studies examined employed various techniques of subdividing the population and utilizing historical data of related diseases (i.e. SARS, MERS) to estimate the potential impact of COVID-19. While these models help simulate the possible course of a disease given population and disease characteristics, each model becomes outdated as various governments implement restrictions on its population. Infectious disease dynamics are classically considered as exponential in nature. However, Maier and Brockmann demonstrate that COVID-19 is affected by \"fundamental mechanisms that are not captured by standard epidemiological models\" 16 . This is notably true in early phases of disease expansion. Consequentially, COVID-19's behavior warrants the examination of models outside of inductive logic.",

This deductive 'outside-in' observational approach allows us to derive models without consideration of ever-changing population dynamics reflective of health policy measures being implemented. We seek to apply our model to nations which have avoided the initial expansion of COVID-19. In this study, we model the pandemic's impact on the United States and BRICS developing nations. India's 657 cases, as of March 25, represent ample seeding, priming the nation for a devastating expansion of cases and fatalities.",

Norway exhibits the minimum rate at 0.191, while the United States has the greatest at 0.295. The mean rate of expansion of Phase 1 countries is 0.238 (95% CI 0.170-0.306).

Our instinct of examining relatively manageable changes to the case load to make policy decisions will quickly be eclipsed by the exponential expansion of this disease. Further complicating the matter is an estimation that 17.9% of COVID-19 patients are asymptomatic 23 . Looking at the data from the Diamond Princess cruise line, most of the cases occurred before or around the start of the quarantine. This reemphasizes the importance to make proactive, as opposed to reactive, policy decisions.

The mean rate of expansion is 0.245, with standard deviation 0.0305. Japan, a member of the G7, is displayed as a strikeout due to being present in the exclusion criteria. However, we display it for comparison purposes. Note that Japan's rate of expansion, r, is approximately 3 times below the average for G7 nations.",
