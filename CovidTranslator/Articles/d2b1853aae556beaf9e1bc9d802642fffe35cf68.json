            "text": "There was a major outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) affecting more than 300 patients occurring in a private housing estate in Hong Kong, in which an infected renal patient was suspected to be the primary source. It is unknown whether renal patients would represent a distinct group of patients who share some characteristics that could predispose them to have higher infectivity. In this context, we have encountered 4 dialysis patients contracting SARS in a minor outbreak, which involved 11 patients and 4 health care workers, in a medical ward of a regional hospital. Of these 4 dialysis patients, 1 patient was receiving hemodialysis while the other 3 patients were on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis. Fever and radiological changes were their dominant presenting features. All were having positive results for SARS-associated coronavirus ribonucleic acid by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction performed on their nasopharyngeal aspirates or stool samples. It appeared that treatment with high-dose intravenous ribavirin and corticosteroids could only resolve the fever, but it could not stop the disease progression. All 4 patients developed respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation on days 9 through 12. At the end, all of the patients died from sudden cardiac arrest, which was associated with acute myocardial infarction in 2 cases. From this small case series, it appeared that dialysis patients might have an aggressive clinical course and poor outcome after contracting SARS. However, a large-scale study is required to further examine this issue, and further investigation into the immunologic abnormalities associated with the uremic state in this group of patients is also warranted.

            "text": "M ANY COUNTRIES in the world have been seriously affected by the outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) since March 2003. 1 It is a new emerging infectious disease with a novel coronavirus being identified as the causative agent. 2, 3 Hong Kong has been one of the most severely affected areas. 4, 5 Of the 1,755 cases reported in Hong Kong so far, 321 cases originated from a major outbreak in Amoy Gardens, a high-rise and densely populated private estate. 6 An epidemiological investigation has linked the outbreak to a faulty sewage system. The system was probably contaminated by the excreta of an index case who was a patient with chronic renal disease on dialysis. While the exact spreading mechanism remains uncertain, it has been speculated that a patient having renal failure might carry an extraordinarily high viral load, which could lead to a large outbreak. It would also be interesting to know whether the clinical course and outcome of a renal patient having SARS would be different from that of other SARS patients. In this regard, we have encountered a minor SARS outbreak occurring in a ward of a regional hospital involving 11 patients and 4 health care workers. All of the cases fulfilled the modified World Health Organization (WHO) definition of SARS. 2 Of these 11 patients, 4 were on dialysis. We have therefore taken the opportunity to examine the clinical courses and outcomes of these patients to see whether they represent a distinct patient group.",

Two days after her discharge from the hospital, she was readmitted to room 6 again because of fever, chills, and rigors. On admission, she was advised to put on a surgical mask, although she showed no symptom of upper respiratory tract infection other than fever. Her initial chest radiograph revealed an ill-defined right lower zone air-space opacity, which rapidly worsened after admission. She was then transferred to the isolation ward after staying in the original ward for 46 hours. Her 7 roommates were then cohorted for suspected SARS contacts.
