One approach is related to the different isolating rates in latent period and invasion period. Experiments show that the increasing of isolating rates in invasion period, as long as over 0.5, contributes little to the preventing of epidemic; the improvement of isolation rate in latent period is key to control the disease spreading. Another is a specific mechanism of message delivering and forwarding. Information quality and information accumulating process are also considered there. Macroscopically, diseases are easy to control as long as the immune messages reach a certain quality. Individually, the accumulating messages bring people with certain immunity to the disease. Also, the model is performed on the classic complex networks like scale-free network and small-world network, and locationbased social networks. Results show that the proposed measures demonstrate superior performance and significantly reduce the negative impact of epidemic disease.",

            "text": "Though the medical conditions are improved significantly, epidemics have never been away from human world, especially in developing countries. Of growing concerns are adverse synergistic interactions between the emerging diseases and other infectious. Poor sanitation and lack of medical knowledge lead to the wide spreading of disease in developing countries, such as Ebola and MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus). Besides, some of traditional contagions are resistant to drug treatments now, such as malaria, tuberculosis, and bacterial pneumonia. These kinds of diseases are defined as new emerging infectious disease (EID), which have increased in the past 20 years and will keep growing in the near future [1] . There are several remarkable characteristics in the EID: unpredictable, not preventable, irremediable, high mortality, rapid transmission and wide scope of influence. The expansion of disease spreading can lead to social panic at some level. It is hence imperative to study effective control strategies to prevent the disease diffusion. Many of researchers have tried to explore the prevention measures of EID. As a practical method, the information diffusion on epidemic dynamic has attracted much attention in recent years. A path-breaking work in this field was taken by Funk et al., who proposed an epidemiological model that considers the spread of awareness about the disease [2, 3] . Lima et al. proposed that the propagation of disease can be reduced by the spreading of immune information, which make individuals resistant to disease and then work against the epidemic propagating [4] . A model of competing epidemic spreading over completely overlapping networks was proposed by Karrer and Newman, revealing a coexistence regime in which both types of spreading can infect a substantial fraction of the network [5] . Wang and Tang distinguish two types of disease spreading and proposed the dynamic model of asymmetrically interacting and disease spreading. Their research focuses on three problems: the different network structures and information spreading dynamics; the asymmetric effects of one type of spreading dynamics on another; the timing of the two types of spreading [6] . Moreover, several researches are also meaningful to us [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] . Trpevski et al. explored the rumors propagation in multiple networks [7] . Zhang et al. proposed a model considering time delay and stochastic fluctuations [8] . Ababou et al. investigated the spreading of periodic diseases and synchronization phenomena on exponential networks [9] . Rakowski et al. put forward an individual based model to study the effects of influenza epidemic in Poland. A simple transportation rule is established to mimic individuals' travels in dynamic route-changing schemes, allowing for the infection spread during a journey [10] . All the above efforts are worth approving but the specific ways of message spreading are ignored. This paper enriches the research in this area, and the proposed methods are shown to have a significant effect in epidemic prevention.",

The infection period is further divided into latent period and invasion period. The former is characterized by the tiny indisposition; the latter is featured by onset of clinical signs and symptoms. Moreover, according to the research of Lessler et al., the latent period is essential to the investigation and control of infectious disease [14] . In this period, the infectious individuals have obtained the ability to spread diseases, yet without obvious symptom to arise attention, e.g., the latent period of influenza remains only one to three days, yet the epidemic can sweep through a city in less than six weeks. Furthermore, according to the health experts Sartwell's research, the period of latent period varies between individuals in the same regular fashion as do other biological characteristics [15] . The distribution of days seems to follow the ''normal'' curve. Based on their theory, we investigate several common infectious diseases and collect their incubation period in Table 1 and then get the average length of latent period which approximates to 7 days.",

Until the next week (invasion period), the node would be isolated at a high probability of v 2 . If isolated, the node would deliver immune messages to its direct and indirect neighboring nodes. If not, it would continue to spread disease within the scope of 100 km. The process is derived from Eqs. (2.2) and (2.3).",

Making a comparison, the former is over 7.14% than the latter. After analyzing, we summarize two reasons to express the weak distinction: firstly, most neighboring nodes have been infected and the space of infection becomes smaller in invasion period; secondly, the high isolation rate reduces the number of infectors. The green line in Fig. 7(b) represents the number of infectors while taking preventive measures. Compare to the previous red line, number of infectors decreases over 68.7%.",

Green points represent the susceptible people; red points stand for the infected people; blue points denote both the isolators and immune people (who collect enough messages). Source of infection is located in North America. To simulate the free spreading process of disease, there is no prevention measure in the beginning. As we can see from the first four panels, the uncontrolled disease spreads from America to the Europe and Asia successively. In fact, the prevention measures are started at the fourth week but remain with a weak and limited power. We attribute it to the latent period of disease, which is set to a week basis. Later in the fifth and sixth weeks, the regional infectious disease evolves into a global outbreak. Most of patients are experiencing the invasion period clinically and may be isolated at a very high rate. The immune measures show their great effects right now. The covering square of blue points is expanding. After nine weeks, the epidemic is under control completely.",

Under the premise of medical research, we assume the rates of patients who are isolated in latent period and invasion period are different. Besides, the specific messages sent from the isolators to their direct and indirect neighbors are originally proposed. Information quality and information accumulating effect are also considered in the model. Second, several valuable results are obtained by simulating the model in scale-free and small-world networks: (i) The increasing of isolation rate in invasion period, as long as over 0.5, contributes little to the prevention of epidemic; the improvement of isolation rate in latent period is key to control the spread of disease. (ii) Infectious diseases are easy to control as long as the propagating message achieves a certain quality. (iii) In the scale-free network with a very low degree (\u27e8k\u27e9 = 2), the epidemic will not diffuse on the network despite the weak immunity in population. (iv) Compared to scale-free network, epidemics in small-world network appear three characteristics corresponding to the number of infectors: slow growth, slow convergence and lower peak.",
