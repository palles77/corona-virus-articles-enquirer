Six nanoliposomes differing in cationic lipids were formulated and screened in vitro and in vivo for cellular delivery functions in lung cells/tissues. Although the six nanoliposomes showed similar siRNA delivery efficiency in vitro, they exhibited significant differences in pulmonary cellular delivery functions in vivo. Among the various nanoliposomes, cationic dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-ethylphosphocholine and cholesterol (ECL)-based nanoliposomes showed the highest pulmonary cellular delivery in vivo and the lowest cytotoxicity in vitro. The delivery efficiency of fluorescent siRNA in ECL nanoliposomes was 26.2-fold higher than that of naked siRNA in vivo. Treatment with Mcl1 (myeloid cell leukemia sequence 1)-specific siRNA (siMcl1) using ECL nanolipoplexes reduced target expression in B16F10 cell lines, whereas control, luciferase-specific siGL2 in ECL nanolipoplexes did not. In metastatic lung cancer mouse models induced by B16F10 or Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) cells, intratracheal administration of siMcl1 in ECL nanolipoplexes significantly silenced Mcl1 mRNA and protein levels in lung tissue. Reduced formation of melanoma tumor nodules was observed in the lung. These results demonstrate the utility of ECL nanoliposomes for pulmonary delivery of therapeutic siRNA for the treatment of lung cancers and potentially for other respiratory diseases.",

[3] [4] [5] Since siRNA is processed and binds to specific mRNAs in the cytoplasm, the intracellular delivery of siRNA is a prerequisite for the silencing of target genes. However, the relatively large size and negative charges of siRNA makes it impossible for siRNA to diffuse through the cell membrane from extracellular spaces.",

            "text": "The lung has been an attractive target organ for siRNA-based therapy. 6 Intravenous administration of functionalized lipopolyamine was reported to provide knockdown of a target gene in the lung tissue of normal mice. 7 However, upon systemic administration, siRNA may be rapidly degraded and cleared from the bloodstream, leading to inefficient delivery to target cells. 8 Compared with systemic delivery, the direct localized administration of siRNA via the pulmonary route may allow higher retention of siRNA in lung tissues and reduce systemic toxicity. 9 Reflecting the several advantages of pulmonary delivery over systemic administration, two of the four siRNA drugs currently in Phase II clinical trials are delivered intranasally or by inhalation. 8 Despite these advances, there remains a need for the development of effective nanocarriers of siRNA for direct pulmonary delivery. A recent study reported that delivery is a crucial barrier against the effective silencing of target genes by intratracheally administered naked siRNA. 10 Several nanocarriers have been studied for localized lung delivery of siRNA. For example, a poly (ester amine) polymer has been used for aerosolized siRNA delivery in mice, 11 and a fatty acid-modified polyethylenimine derivative was recently studied for intratracheal administration of siRNA in mice. 12 In this study, we screened various cationic nanoliposomes for delivery efficiency in vitro and in vivo after intratracheal administration in mice. For cationic nanoliposomes, we tested 1,2-dioleoyl-3-trimethylammonium-propane (DOTAP), 1,2-di-O-octadecenyl-3-trimethylammonium propane (DOTMA), and 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-ethylphosphocholine (EDOPC) as cationic lipid components. DOTAP and DOTMA have been used previously as cationic lipid components of cationic liposomes or nanoparticles for siRNA delivery. For example, DOTAP-modified cationic poly (DL-lactide-co-glycolide acid) nanoparticles have been used in an inhalable dry powder formulation of siRNA, 13 and DOTAP-based cationic liposomes have been reported as a system for delivering siRNA to lung cancer cells. 14 DOTMA-based cationic liposomes have been used to increase the cellular delivery",

            "text": "In addition to the lack of correlation between in vitro and in vivo fluorescent dsRNA delivery efficiencies, there was a lack of correlation between pulmonary cellular delivery efficiency (Figure 3a) and whole lung tissue delivery, as determined by molecular imaging (Figure 3c) . Fluorescent dsRNA has been used as a model for evaluating the cellular uptake of various siRNA nanocarriers. 23 Although, we observed more than a 20-fold increase in fluorescent dsRNA delivery in ECL nanolipoplexes compared with the naked form, there was no difference in fluorescence intensity in whole lung tissue images. The discrepancy between in vivo cellular level and whole tissue level data might reflect the presence of naked fluorescent dsRNA in the extracellular spaces of lung tissues, which yields a fluorescence signal on molecular imaging comparable to that of nanolipoplexed fluorescent dsRNA inside pulmonary cells. These results emphasize the importance of measuring cellular uptake levels of siRNA in vivo in evaluations of nanocarriers, in addition to molecular imaging of whole tissues or the entire body. The in vivo tumor distribution of polymeric micelles with or without folate ligand modification has also been investigated at tumor tissue and tumor cell levels. 24 In this previous study, the tumor tissue distribution of polymeric micelles was found to be similar regardless of folate ligand modification. Despite a similar distribution at the whole tissue level, polymeric micelles with folate ligand were taken up by the cells, whereas plain polymeric micelles were found in the extracellular spaces. This study provides additional support for the interpretation of the discrepancy between whole tissue distribution and target cell-level uptake, presented above. ECL nanolipoplexes not only showed the highest in vivo pulmonary cellular delivery of fluorescent dsRNA, they also exhibited the lowest cytotoxicity in B16F10 cells. In Figure 4 , we aimed to compare the cytotoxicity of all cationic nanoliposomes per se, not of siRNA. We thus used nanolipoplexes formed by nonfunctional luciferase GL2 siRNA, rather than cytotoxic siMcl-1. 23 The cytotoxicity of cationic nanocarriers has been reported to reflect interaction of the cationic component with the mitochondrial membrane, activation of the caspase 3 pathway, and induction of mitochondrially mediated apoptosis. 25, 26 The dependence of cytotoxicity on the cationic lipids might be explained in part by the degradation kinetics of these lipids in endosomal environments and the toxicity of their cellular degradation products. Unlike chemically synthesized cationic lipids such as DOTA and DOTAP, EDOPC is a derivative of the natural lipid phosphatidylcholine with a simple modification. 27 Because of structural similarity to natural phosphatidylcholine, EDOPC is considered to be more readily metabolizable in the body. It has been reported that EDOPC is readily hydrolyzed by phospholipase A2, and metabolized with a half-life of a few days in cells. 21 Moreover, the greater viability of cell treated with ECL relative to those treated with EDL (Figure 4 ) may be explained by the additional presence of the cationic lipid DC-Chol in EDL rather than the natural Chol present in ECL.",

For the in vivo study, we compared the anticancer activity of siMcl1 in free or ECL nanolipoplexes, not with L2K complexes. L2K is commercially supplied for in vitro transfection of nucleic acids for cell culture. For in vivo experiments, L2K needs to be complexed with siRNA sufficient for intratracheal administration dose (0.21 mg/ kg). However, the L2K at its currently supplied concentration could not form nanolipoplexes with siRNA at the concentrations for in vivo injection. Mcl1 has been reported to be an antiapoptotic protein involved in the proliferation and survival of lung cancer cells. 28, 29 Moreover, overexpression of Mcl1 has been found in lung cancer tissues. 30 Thus, silencing of the Mcl1 protein by siMcl1 is predicted to promote the apoptosis of cancer cells. Consistent with this, siMcl1 has recently been reported to enhance the apoptosis of various solid tumor cells, including lung cancer cells. 31 In addition, intratumoral treatment with siMcl1 complexed to a tocopherol derivative of oligochitosan-based nanoparticles was shown to inhibit the growth of KB tumors xenografted in mice. 23 Finally, the co-delivery of siMcl1 with a histone deacetylase inhibitor using a cationic nanoliposome was demonstrated to provide synergistic anticancer activity after intravenous administration. 32 Using lung metastasis after intravenous injection of B16F10 cells into mice as a lung cancer model, we found that intratracheal administration of siMcl1/ECL nanolipoplexes reduced the formation of B16F10 tumor nodules in lung tissue. Previous studies have used this approach to establish an in vivo lung metastasis animal model. 33, 34 This lung cancer model has significant advantages as an orthotopic disease model in that it may mimic the pathogenesis of metastatic lung cancer in humans. Intratracheal nebulization with a microsprayer was used for lung delivery of siMcl1, 35 an administration method that may more closely mimic a clinically suitable aerosol dosage form than the intranasal route.",

            "text": "Formation of tumor nodules was lowest in the siMcl1/ECL nanocomplex-treated group, consistent with the highest uptake of siMcl1 by pulmonary cells in vivo (Figure 2b) and silencing of the antiapoptotic Mcl1 in lung tissue at both mRNA and protein levels in this group. Previously, siRNA against SARS coronavirus was intratracheally administered to rhesus macaques. 36 In this latter study, siRNA was delivered in the naked form using 5% glucose in distilled water as a carrier solution. A recent report on the uptake and efficacy of naked siRNA via intratracheal administration in mice 10 suggested that delivery remains a key obstacle to the efficacy of topically administered, naked oligonucleotide in the lung, supporting the importance of effective delivery systems for localized delivery of siRNA. Several possibilities may exist to explain the highest siRNA delivery efficiencies of ECL nanolipoplexes in the lung tissues. One possibility is the enhanced serum stability of ECL as compared with other cationic liposomes. EDOPC, a cationic derivative of dioleyoylphosphatidylcholine, has a structure similar to natural membrane lipid component phosphatidylcholine. 37 EDOPC is known to have a phase transition temperature very similar to the natural phosphatidylcholine, and be quite insensitive to ionic strength. 37 The low sensitivity of EDOPC to ionic strength in biological environment may confer the stability of ECL in vivo, and contribute to the higher interaction with lung epithelial cells. Previously, the serum stability of EDOPC-based lipoplexes with plasmid DNA was reported. In the study, the incubation of EDOPC and plasmid DNA complexes in nearly pure serum did not reduce the transfection efficiencies. 21 These previous studies support that the high in vivo efficiencies of ECL might be contributed in part by the serum stability of EDOPC. Moreover, we cannot exclude the possibility that EDOPC may enhance the interaction with lung cells after intratracheal administration. The biodistribution study in mice following the intravenous administration of plasmid DNA with EDOPC-based nanoparticles revealed the discrete expression of plasmid DNA in lung tissues. 17 Our results suggest the importance of cationic lipids and colipids for selection of in vivo siRNA delivery. The effects of cationic lipid structure on siRNA transfection efficiencies have been previously reported. The head groups of cationic lipids were shown to influence the in vivo siRNA delivery efficiencies. The small molecular dissimilarity in the ionizable cationic lipids resulted in significant differences in the gene-silencing potencies of siRNA in mouse. 38 The head groups affecting the pKa values of cationic lipids may modulate the extent of positive charges at physiological pH, and consequently influence the adsorption of plasma protein, and biodistribution behavior. 39 Moreover, the extent of unsaturation in hydrocarbon chains of cationic lipids may affect the siRNA delivery efficiencies. The high degree of unsaturated bonds in hydrocarbon chains of cationic lipid is known to facilitate siRNA delivery. 40 In addition to the cationic lipids, the co-lipids were reported to play an important role in the siRNA delivery efficiencies. Among various co-lipids, DOPE has been widely used as a co-lipid for cationic liposome-mediated transfecton of siRNA and plasmid DNA. 41 The role of DOPE is not fully understood, but a recent study reported that DOPE might affect the structural transition of cationic liposomes at the acid pH of late endosomes in the cells. 42 Moreover, DOPE in cationic liposomes has been reported to induce the formation of hexagonal phase, facilitating the release of nucleic acids from the complexes in endosomes. 43 Although, we used DOPE as a co-lipid in this study, the inclusion of polyunsaturated fatty acids such as linoleic acid and linolenic acid in lipid nanoparticles were shown to further enhance the in vivo gene-silencing efficiencies. 44 In this study, we specifically demonstrated the anticancer therapeutic effect of siMcl1 in ECL nanolipoplexes in a B16F10metastasized lung tumor model. But the effective pulmonary cellular delivery efficiency of siRNA and the in vivo silencing of target protein in lung tissue suggest the utility of ECL nanoliposomes for inhalation dosage forms of other siRNA and nucleic acid therapeutics. It is anticipated that inhalable siRNA will be applied to various lung diseases, including cystic fibrosis, inflammatory conditions, infectious diseases, and cancers. 6 Because ECL nanoliposomes provide a means for delivering pathogenic protein-specific siRNAs to lung cells in aerosol dosage forms, they offer an approach for targeting malignant proteins whose overexpression contributes to the pathology of various lung diseases.",

Cationic nanoliposomes were prepared using the lipid-film hydration method as previously described. 32 Chol was purchased from the Sigma-Aldrich (St Louis, MO), and the lipids EDOPC, DOTAP, DOTMA, DC-Chol, and DOPE were obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids (Birmingham, AL, USA). These lipids, dissolved in chloroform, were mixed at different compositions and evaporated using a rotary evaporator to eliminate the organic solvent. For nanoliposome preparation, EDOPC, Chol, and DOPE (15 \u03bcmol total lipids) were mixed at a molar ratio of 8:5:2 ( Table 1 ). In other nanoliposome formulations, DOTAP or DOTMA were used instead of EDOPC, and DC-Chol was used in place of Chol. Thin lipid films were hydrated with 1 ml of 20 mmol/l HEPES (pH 7.4), and the resulting nanoliposomes were extruded three times through 0.2 \u03bcm polycarbonate membrane filters (Isopore; Millipore, Billerica, MA) using an Extruder (Northern Lipids, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada). After complexation of various cationic nanoliposomes with siRNA, the sizes and zeta potentials of nanolipoplexes were determined using an ELS-8000 instrument (Photal, Osaka, Japan).",
