These results and those from future research will permit better pandemic planning and allow intervention strategies to be tailored to the specific demographics and resource constraints found in developing countries. [1] and the possible occurrence of a highly pathogenic virus strain is of concern to health authorities worldwide. South-East Asia is especially at risk given the continuing presence of highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 in wild bird populations in close proximity to domestic poultry and humans. Indonesia is a major hotspot for continuing H5N1 infection [2] . Given the high mortality rates seen with human cases of H5N1 and the possibility that this strain may re-assort or mutate to become readily transmissible between humans, as has been shown using a ferret model under laboratory conditions [3] , research has been conducted to inform the development of appropriate pandemic preparedness plans. A key goal of this effort is to determine the effectiveness of interventions, in terms of their ability to reduce infection and consequential mortality rates.",

These models, and analyses using them, give limited guidance as to the impact which an influenza pandemic may have on lowincome countries such as PNG and those in sub-Saharan Africa [13] . These countries have markedly different demographic and community structure and limited resources and infrastructural constraints in comparison with developed countries. Significantly, it has been shown that co-morbidity is a strong predictor for severe and fatal outcomes following influenza infection [14] . High rates of co-morbidity arising from influenza infection coupled with disease conditions generally absent in developed countries (such as chronic malnutrition, malaria, tuberculosis, pneumonia and HIV) will result in a significantly increased burden on health infrastructures in low-income countries already operating above capacity.",

One new infection per day was introduced into the population during the whole period of the simulations, and randomly allocated to a household. The simulation period was divided into 12 hour day/night periods and during each period a nominal location for each individual was determined. This took into consideration the cycle type (day/night, weekday/weekend), infection state of each individual and whether child supervision was needed to look after a child at home. Individuals occupying the same location during the same time period were assumed to come into potential infective contact. Details of the simulation procedure are presented in [10] . The effectiveness of social distancing interventions, such as school or workplace closure, may be quantified by comparing the passage of the influenza virus in the community with and without interventions activated, and presented as the reduction in the daily and cumulative illness attack rates. Pharmaceutical-based interventions were not considered as antiviral agents may only be available in limited quantities in a PNG setting, whilst a vaccination campaign would face significant delay, supply and delivery constraints. Two intervention strategies considered feasible in a PNG setting were examined. These were: school closure involving all schools, with home isolation of all affected children; and a more rigorous strategy involving school closure coupled with 50% reductions in community-wide contact, workplace participation, and contact in neighbourhood hubs.",

Comparing the attack rates when interventions are activated, both intervention strategies (solely school closure and rigorous social distancing) are much less effective in a PNG setting compared to the Australian one. The mitigated illness attack rates in the PNG model are approximately 3 times higher than those in the Australian model with the interventions being 60% -70% less effective.

Neighbourhood hubs were introduced to reflect the known mixing patterns occurring with adults not working in designated workplaces, such as found in regular contact in marketplaces. The addition of such contact hubs increased individual-to-individual contacts and hence infection transmission opportunities, (see in Table 2 ) with approximately 2,000 additional symptomatic infections resulting, for all three (mitigated and nonmitigated) scenarios.

School closure scenario The school closure intervention in the Madang model is found to be approximately five times less effective compared to that of the Albany model. Simulation results suggest a 9.4% reduction (46.6% to 42.2%) in the illness attack rate can be achieved in Madang due to school closure whereas a 48.6% reduction (31.7% to 16 .3%) can be achieved in Albany (see Table 1 ). For the no-hub Madang-nnh model, school closure is ~3.5 times less effective compared to the Albany model. Table 2 (middle panel) indicates an illness attack rate of ~15,000 in Madang compared to ~4,800 in Albany. Much higher case numbers occur in households, workplaces and the wider community (including neighbourhood hubs) than in Albany, highlighting the poorer efficacy of this intervention strategy in a PNG setting. The Madang-nnh model also has higher household and workplace transmission than in Albany. Note that while there is a significantly higher proportion of under 17 year old children in Madang (40%) compared to Albany (28%), our field survey indicates that 50% of school age children in Madang do not attend school, hence school closure is less effective in disrupting the transmission chain (household 1 / school / household 2) compared to Australia.

These countries have poorer access to antiviral drug and vaccine-based interventions and higher extant disease burdens, compared to developed countries.

If this value is alternatively assumed to be 20 or 30 individuals, additional contacts gives increased transmission and results in higher final attack rates. Compliance with home isolation of school children following school closure intervention has been examined and compliance reduction from 100% to 50% considered. Effects of the compliances on the illness attack rates have been presented in Table A4 . For the purely school closure intervention, illness attack rate increases by ~3% in Albany as reduced isolation permits additional childto-child contact. In the Madang models, reduced compliance with home isolation during the period of school closure has minimal effect on the attack rate as ~50% school age children do not attend school. In all three models, reduced compliance has minimal effect if rigorous social distancing intervention is applied. ",

It is known that during past influenza pandemics developing countries have experienced considerably higher mortality rates compared to developed countries. Furthermore, many developing countries lack appropriate pandemic preparedness plans. Mathematical modelling studies to guide the development of such plans are largely focused on predicting pandemic influenza spread in developed nations. However, intervention strategies shown by modelling studies to be highly effective for developed countries give limited guidance as to the impact which an influenza pandemic may have on low-income countries given different demographics and resource constraints. To address this, an individual-based model of a Papua New Guinean community was created and used to simulate the spread of a novel influenza strain. The results were compared to those obtained from a comparable Australian model.",

            "text": "It has been shown under laboratory conditions that the highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza strain may re-assort or mutate to become readily transmissible between humans. [2] In response to the threat of influenza pandemics, most countries have developed pandemic preparedness plans. [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8] . However the level of completeness of these plans with regards to World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines [9] varies dramatically between developed high income countries and developing, low-income countries. [7, 8] Low-income countries suffer the highest rates of morbidity and mortality from influenza pandemics. Data from the 1918/19 pandemic suggests much higher mortality rates in India compared to Europe and the USA. While in northern Europe and the USA mortality rates were consistently below 1%, over 4.3% average mortality was reported from India, with some Indian provinces exceeding mortality rates of 7%. [10, 11] Even in the mild H1N1 pandemic of 2009, 59% of the estimated 284,500 deaths occurred in Africa and South-East Asia. [2] These differences are most likely due to the significant association of influenza mortality with comorbidities usually absent in the developed countries (such as chronic malnutrition, malaria, tuberculosis, pneumonia and HIV). [12] Furthermore it has been shown that the increased mortality rate due to an influenza pandemic is strongly associated with per capita income. [11] It is apparent that the burden of the next pandemic will also be focused overwhelmingly on the developing world, a point made by the WHO and others. [5, 11, 13, 14, 15] A substantial number of pandemic influenza models have been constructed in the past decade. A key goal of this effort is to determine the effectiveness of interventions, in terms of their ability to reduce infection and consequential mortality rates. Although it has been recognized that the major burden of mortality from influenza pandemics is suffered by low-income countries [5, 11, 16] the primary focus of the vast majority of these models is on examining intervention effectiveness in developed (e.g., the USA and European countries [17, 18, 19, 20] ) and middle income countries (e.g., Thailand [21, 22] ). Given the markedly different demographic and community structure, as well as resource and infrastructural constraints in comparison with developed countries, these models have limited capability to predict the impact of an influenza pandemic on low-income countries [23] . In addition, many low-income countries are located in tropical or subtropical regions where the timing and impact of influenza epidemics are more poorly understood than in temperate regions, where they are known to have a well-defined winter season. [15] To address this 'modelling gap' an individual-based disease transmission model of pandemic influenza has been developed for Papua New Guinea (PNG), based on the methods used previously to develop a pandemic influenza model of Albany, Western The model was used to describe the spread of a novel influenza strain after introduction into the community. The resulting illness attack rate was determined together with data indicating where person-to-person transmission occurred. An unmitigated outbreak and two outbreaks with PNG-feasible intervention strategies activated were simulated and the results compared to those obtained using the Albany, Australia model.",

The addition of such contact hubs increased individual-to-individual contacts and hence infection transmission opportunities (see Table 2 ) with approximately 2,000 additional symptomatic infections resulting, for all three (mitigated and non-mitigated) scenarios.

Surveys have shown that a higher proportion of low-income countries have social distancing interventions planned in the case of a pandemic, compared to high income European countries due to their feasibility and cost-effectiveness. Pharmaceutical-based interventions were not considered in this study due to cost and delivery issues found with low-income countries. [4, 8] Consideration may need to be given to some form of antiviral agent use, possibly for case treatment, given the poor performance of purely social distancing interventions in developing countries as suggested by this study. The advantage of antiviral use is that it may be targeted at reducing within-household transmission, a location of transmission otherwise not impacted by social distancing interventions. The present study shows that larger numbers of transmissions occur within households due to the larger household sizes in countries such as PNG. Furthermore, low-income countries generally have population health profiles not seen in developed countries, including the prevalence of diseases such as malaria, tuberculosis and HIV. [44] Antiviral treatment of influenza cases co-infected with such diseases may be an appropriate intervention strategy given the poorer health outcomes which co-morbidity may impose. [12] The provision and use of antiviral agents will have challenges not faced by industrialised countries, due to the cost of providing an antiviral stockpile and subsequent distribution of antivirals in countries which have health systems already stretched to capacity. [15] The importance of suitable pandemic influenza preparedness plans for low-income countries is recognized by the WHO [45, 46] . Disease transmission models will play a role in guiding policy makers in determining the effectiveness of possible pandemic countermeasures. History tells us that low-income countries are likely to be more affected, yet almost all models deal with mitigation strategies for developed nations with good health infrastructure and low prevalence of endemic diseases. 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 Daily case incidence for the no intervention, school closure and rigorous social distancing (school closure and workplace and community contact reductions) scenarios is shown.

            "text": "It has been shown under laboratory conditions that the highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza strain may re-assort or mutate to become readily transmissible between humans. [2] In response to the threat of influenza pandemics, most countries have developed pandemic preparedness plans. [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8] . However the level of completeness of these plans with regards to World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines [9] varies dramatically between developed high income countries and developing, low-income countries. [7, 8] Low-income countries suffer the highest rates of morbidity and mortality from influenza pandemics. Data from the 1918/19 pandemic suggests much higher mortality rates in India compared to Europe and the USA. While in northern Europe and the USA mortality rates were consistently below 1%, over 4.3% average mortality was reported from India, with some Indian provinces exceeding mortality rates of 7%. [10, 11] Even in the mild H1N1 pandemic of 2009, 59% of the estimated 284,500 deaths occurred in Africa and South-East Asia. [2] These differences are most likely due to the significant association of influenza mortality with comorbidities usually absent in the developed countries (such as chronic malnutrition, malaria, tuberculosis, pneumonia and HIV). [12] Furthermore it has been shown that the increased mortality rate due to an influenza pandemic is strongly associated with per capita income. [11] It is apparent that the burden of the next pandemic will also be focused overwhelmingly on the developing world, a point made by the WHO and others. [5, 11, 13, 14, 15] A substantial number of pandemic influenza models have been constructed in the past decade. A key goal of this effort is to determine the effectiveness of interventions, in terms of their ability to reduce infection and consequential mortality rates. Although it has been recognized that the major burden of mortality from influenza pandemics is suffered by low-income countries [5, 11, 16] the primary focus of the vast majority of these models is on examining intervention effectiveness in developed (e.g., the USA and European countries [17, 18, 19, 20] ) and middle income countries (e.g., Thailand [21, 22] ). Given the markedly different demographic and community structure, as well as resource and infrastructural constraints in comparison with developed countries, these models have limited capability to predict the impact of an influenza pandemic on low-income countries [23] . In addition, many low-income countries are located in tropical or subtropical regions where the timing and impact of influenza epidemics are more poorly understood than in temperate regions, where they are known to have a well-defined winter season. [15] To address this 'modelling gap' an individual-based disease transmission model of pandemic influenza has been developed for Papua New Guinea (PNG), based on the methods used previously to develop a pandemic influenza model of Albany, Western Australia [20, 24, 25] . The chosen location of Madang, a town of approximately 35,000 on the northern coast of the island of New Guinea has, along with all of PNG, different demographics and individual-to-individual contact patterns compared to those in developed countries. Papua New Guinea has an annual per capita income of about $US 2500,-and is thus at a similar level of development as many African nations. [26] The model was used to describe the spread of a novel influenza strain after introduction into the community. The resulting illness attack rate was determined together with data indicating where person-to-person transmission occurred. An unmitigated outbreak and two outbreaks with PNG-feasible intervention strategies activated were simulated and the results compared to those obtained using the Albany, Australia model.",

To achieve simulations for a particular basic reproduction number R0, \u03b2v was adjusted; details of the procedure for estimating \u03b2v and R0 are given in [20] . A pandemic with a basic reproduction number of 1.5 is used in this study, and corresponds to some estimations of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic [34, 35, 36, 37] and the 1957 and 1968 pandemics [38, 39] . Since it is virus intrinsic, we assumed that \u03b2v was similar in Madang and thus calculated R0 in the Madang and Madang-nnh models using the \u03b2v corresponding to an R0 of 1.5 in the Albany model. Details of parameter settings used in each model are given in Table A2 in the Supplementary Data File. Individuals in each household and contact hub make contacts within a close-contact mixing group, taken to be the entire household or a subset of larger hubs, and also make additional non hub-based random community contacts. The individual-toindividual transmission probability in larger households was moderated by household size using data from a study by Cauchemez et al [40] . This reflects the assumed reduction in pairwise contact in households with greater than 3 members and is significant in the Madang context, where the average household size is 6.32 compared to 2.54 in Albany.",

For a pandemic in a developed country setting having a basic reproduction number R0 of 1.5 and an illness attack rate of 31.7%, the same pandemic characteristics applied in a PNG setting with no interventions activated resulted in higher rates of influenza transmission, with an attack rate of 46.6% and reproduction number R0 = 1.88 (Table 1) . Comparing the attack rates when interventions were activated, both intervention strategies (solely school closure and rigorous social distancing) were much less effective in the PNG setting compared to the Australian one. The mitigated illness attack rates in the PNG model were approximately 3 times higher than those in the Australian model with the interventions being 60% -70% less effective. We also conducted experiments with the Madang-nnh model, where neighbourhood contact hubs were omitted, to contrast the transmission characteristics with and without these contact hubs. The results of these simulation experiments are included in Tables 1 and 2 . It should be noted that the Madang model with neighbourhood hubs included is believed to be more representative of population mixing characteristics in PNG, following local knowledge. Neighbourhood hubs were introduced to reflect the known mixing patterns occurring with adults not working in designated workplaces, such as found in the regular contact which may occur among individuals in marketplaces. The addition of such contact hubs increased individual-to-individual contacts and hence infection transmission opportunities (see Table 2 ) with approximately 2,000 additional symptomatic infections resulting, for all three (mitigated and non-mitigated) scenarios. In terms of cumulative illness attack rate, the Madang model gave a basic reproduction number R0 of 1.88 and an illness attack rate of 46.6%, compared to that of the Madang-nnh (no neighbourhood hub) model with R0 = 1.74 and an illness attack rate of 40.8%. The daily case incidence resulting from simulating the Albany, Madang and Madang-nnh models is presented in Figure 2 for the three scenarios. It is apparent from the results presented in Table 1 that there is a greater proportion of influenza cases occurring within households in both Madang models note that Madang has a total population of ~35,000 compared to ~30,000 in Albany.",

Similarly, in the rigorous contact reduction scenario the effect of delayed response on attack rate was more ",

Surveys have shown that a higher proportion of low-income countries have social distancing interventions planned in the case of a pandemic, compared to high income European countries due to their feasibility and cost-effectiveness. Pharmaceutical-based interventions were not considered in this study due to cost and delivery issues found with low-income countries. [4, 8] Consideration may need to be given to some form of antiviral agent use, possibly for case treatment, given the poor performance of purely social distancing interventions in developing countries as suggested by this study. The advantage of antiviral use is that it may be targeted at reducing within-household transmission, a location of transmission otherwise not impacted by social distancing interventions. The present study shows that larger numbers of transmissions occur within households due to the larger household sizes in countries such as PNG. Furthermore, low-income countries generally have population health profiles not seen in developed countries, including the prevalence of diseases such as malaria, tuberculosis and HIV. [44] Antiviral treatment of influenza cases co-infected with such diseases may be an appropriate intervention strategy given the poorer health outcomes which co-morbidity may impose. [12] The provision and use of antiviral agents will have challenges not faced by industrialised countries, due to the cost of providing an antiviral stockpile and subsequent distribution of antivirals in countries which have health systems already stretched to capacity. [15] The importance of suitable pandemic influenza preparedness plans for low-income countries is recognized by the WHO [45, 46] . Disease transmission models will play a role in guiding policy makers in determining the effectiveness of possible pandemic countermeasures. History tells us that low-income countries are likely to be more affected, yet almost all models deal with mitigation strategies for developed nations with good health infrastructure and low prevalence of endemic diseases. Daily case incidence for the no intervention, school closure and rigorous social distancing (school closure and workplace and community contact reductions) scenarios is shown. The blue, red and green curves represent the Albany, Madang and Madang-nnh models respectively. Compliance with home isolation of school children following school closure intervention has been examined and compliance reduction from 100% to 50% considered. Effects of reduced compliances on the illness attack rates and their corresponding 95% CI (in parentheses, shaded rows) are presented in Table A4 . For the purely school closure intervention, the illness attack rate increases by ~3% in Albany as reduced isolation permits additional child-to-child contact. In the Madang models, reduced compliance with home isolation during the period of school closure has minimal effect on the attack rate. This is due to ~50% school age children not attending school. In all three models, reduced compliance has minimal effect if additional rigorous social distancing interventions are also applied. Alternative intervention activation timing assumptions for school closure, workforce reduction and community contact reduction are examined and two different settings are considered. Effects of these alternative assumptions on the illness attack rates and their corresponding 95% CI (in parentheses, shaded rows) are presented.

'Census data classified a significant proportion (16.2%) of adults as unemployed and do not attend a designated workplace [17] . Local knowledge indicated that these adults do have daytime contact with others outwith the home, such as working or visiting the two informal markets. To address this feature an additional daytime contact location (neighbourhood hub) was introduced, with unemployed adults in each census unit allocated to neighbourhood hubs of 10 individuals. In addition, these hubs also have 25% of all local school age pupils allocated to them, accounting for half of the 50% of school age children which do not attend school.' The seeding assumption of 1 case per day was chosen to reliably begin a local epidemic in every stochastic simulation. Analysis of the low transmissibility scenario shows that seeding at this rate for 7 days results in a sustained epidemic in >97% of the simulation runs and 100% with two weeks of seeding, with higher percentages for the higher transmissibility scenarios. Seeding at this rate is continued throughout the simulation in order to capture the case where an epidemic may be initially suppressed by a rigorous intervention strategy, but may subsequently break out if intervention measures are relaxed.",

'Pharmaceutical-based interventions were not considered in this study due to cost and delivery issues found with low-income countries. However, consideration may need to be given to some form of antiviral agent use, possibly for case treatment, given the poor performance of purely social distancing interventions in developing countries as suggested by this study. The advantage of antiviral use is that it may be targetted at reducing within-household transmission, a location of transmission otherwise not impacted by social distancing interventions. The present study shows that larger numbers of transmissions occur within households due to the larger household sizes in developing countries. Furthermore, low-income countries generally have population health profiles not seen in developed countries, including the prevalence of diseases such as malaria, tuberculosis and HIV. [18] Antiviral treatment of influenza cases who are co-infected with such diseases may be an appropriate intervention strategy given the poorer health outcomes which co-morbidity may impose. [7] The provision and use of antiviral agents will have challenges not faced by industrialised countries, due to the cost of providing an antiviral stockpile and subsequent distribution of antivirals in countries which have health systems already stretched to capacity.

It is known that during past influenza pandemics developing countries have experienced considerably higher mortality rates compared to developed countries. Furthermore, many developing countries lack appropriate pandemic preparedness plans. Mathematical modelling studies to guide the development of such plans are largely focused on predicting pandemic influenza spread in developed nations. However, intervention strategies shown by modelling studies to be highly effective for developed countries give limited guidance as to the impact which an influenza pandemic may have on low-income countries given different demographics and resource constraints. To address this, an individual-based model of a Papua New Guinean community was created and used to simulate the spread of a novel influenza strain.

            "text": "It has been shown under laboratory conditions that the highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza strain may re-assort or mutate to become readily transmissible between humans. [2] In response to the threat of influenza pandemics, most countries have developed pandemic preparedness plans. [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] . However the level of completeness of these plans with regards to World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines [9] varies dramatically between developed high income countries and developing, low-income countries. [7, 8] Low-income countries suffer the highest rates of morbidity and mortality from influenza pandemics. Data from the 1918/19 pandemic suggests much higher mortality rates in India compared to Europe and the USA. While in northern Europe and the USA mortality rates were consistently below 1%, over 4.3% average mortality was reported from India, with some Indian provinces exceeding mortality rates of 7%. [10, 11] Even in the mild H1N1 pandemic of 2009, 59% of the estimated 284,500 deaths occurred in Africa and South-East Asia. [2] These differences are most likely due to the significant association of influenza mortality with comorbidities usually absent in the developed countries (such as chronic malnutrition, malaria, tuberculosis, pneumonia and HIV). [12] Furthermore it has been shown that the increased mortality rate due to an influenza pandemic is strongly associated with per capita income. [11] It is apparent that the burden of the next pandemic will also be focused overwhelmingly on the developing world, a point made by the WHO and others. [5, 11, [13] [14] [15] A substantial number of pandemic influenza models have been constructed in the past decade. A key goal of this effort is to determine the effectiveness of interventions, in terms of their ability to reduce infection and consequential mortality rates. Although it has been recognized that the major burden of mortality from influenza pandemics is suffered by low-income countries [5, 11, 16] the primary focus of the vast majority of these models is on examining intervention effectiveness in developed (e.g., the USA and European countries [17] [18] [19] [20] ) and middle income countries (e.g., Thailand [21, 22] ). Given the markedly different demographic and community structure, as well as resource and infrastructural constraints in comparison with developed countries, these models have limited capability to predict the impact of an influenza pandemic on low-income countries [23] . In addition, many low-income countries are located in tropical or subtropical regions where the timing and impact of influenza epidemics are more poorly understood than in temperate regions, where they are known to have a well-defined winter season. [15] To address this 'modelling gap' an individual-based disease transmission model of pandemic influenza has been developed for Papua New Guinea (PNG), based on the methods used previously to develop a pandemic influenza model of Albany, Western 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59  60   F  o  r  p  e  e  r  r  e  v  i  e  w  o  n  l  y   5 Australia [20, 24, 25] . The chosen location of Madang, a town of approximately 35,000 on the northern coast of the island of New Guinea has, along with all of PNG, different demographics and individual-to-individual contact patterns compared to those in developed countries. Papua New Guinea has an annual per capita income of about $US 2500,-and is thus at a similar level of development as many African nations. [26] The model was used to describe the spread of a novel influenza strain after introduction into the community. The resulting illness attack rate was determined together with data indicating where person-to-person transmission occurred. An unmitigated outbreak and two outbreaks with PNG-feasible intervention strategies activated were simulated and the results compared to those obtained using the Albany, Australia model.",

Since it is virus intrinsic, we assumed that \u03b2v was similar in Madang and thus calculated R0 in the Madang and Madang-nnh models using the \u03b2v corresponding to an R0 of 1.5 in the Albany model. Details of parameter settings used in each model are given in Table A2 in the Supplementary Data File. Individuals in each household and contact hub make contacts within a close-contact mixing group, taken to be the entire household or a subset of larger hubs, and also make additional non hub-based random community contacts. The individual-toindividual transmission probability in larger households was moderated by household size using data from a study by Cauchemez et al [42] . The reduction of the probability of within-household transmission with household size is also shown in Figure A1 in the Supplementary Data File. This reflects the assumed reduction in pairwise contact in households with greater than 3 members and is significant in the Madang context, where the average household size is 6.32 compared to 2.54 in Albany.",

For the transmission characteristics described above, analysis shows that seeding at this rate for 7 days results in a sustained epidemic in >97% of the simulation runs and 100% with two weeks of seeding, with higher percentages for the higher transmissibility scenarios. Seeding at this rate is continued throughout the simulation in order to capture the case where an epidemic may be initially suppressed by a rigorous intervention strategy, but may subsequently break out if intervention measures are relaxed. After the beginning of a sustained local epidemic, any subsequent variation in the amount of seeding has very little effect on the progress of the local epidemic, as the number of imported cases is much smaller than those generated by the local epidemic. Preliminary analyses using the present model have shown that even if the seeding rate is increased to 5 infections per day, after 7 days the number of infections generated from the self-sustained local epidemic is twice the number of imported infections, and by 14 days local infections outnumber imported infections by a factor of 8.",

The addition of such contact hubs increased individual-to-individual contacts and hence infection transmission opportunities (see Table 2 ) with approximately 2,000 additional symptomatic infections resulting, for all three (mitigated and non-mitigated) scenarios.

Furthermore, low-income countries generally have population health profiles not seen in developed countries, including the prevalence of diseases such as malaria, tuberculosis and HIV. [49] Antiviral treatment of influenza cases co-infected with such diseases may be an appropriate intervention strategy given the poorer health outcomes which co-morbidity may impose. [12] The provision and use of antiviral agents will have challenges not faced by industrialised countries, due to the cost of providing an antiviral stockpile and subsequent distribution of antivirals in countries which have health systems already stretched to capacity. [15] The importance of suitable pandemic influenza preparedness plans for low-income countries is recognized by the WHO [50, 51]. Disease transmission models will play a role in guiding policy makers in determining the effectiveness of possible pandemic countermeasures. History tells us that low-income countries are likely to be more affected, yet almost all models deal with mitigation strategies for developed nations with good health infrastructure and low prevalence of endemic diseases. These countries have poorer access to antiviral drug and vaccine-based interventions and higher extant disease burdens, compared to developed countries. For the reasons, development of appropriate intervention strategies focused on countries such as PNG needs to occur. ",

[2] In response to the threat of influenza pandemics, most countries have developed pandemic preparedness plans. [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] . However the level of completeness of these plans with regards to World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines [9] varies dramatically between developed high income countries and developing, low-income countries. [7, 8] Low-income countries suffer the highest rates of morbidity and mortality from influenza pandemics. Data from the 1918/19 pandemic suggests much higher mortality rates in India compared to Europe and the USA. While in northern Europe and the USA mortality rates were consistently below 1%, over 4.3% average mortality was reported from India, with some Indian provinces exceeding mortality rates of 7%. [10, 11] Even in the mild H1N1 pandemic of 2009, 59% of the estimated 284,500 deaths occurred in Africa and South-East Asia. [2] These differences are most likely due to the significant association of influenza mortality with comorbidities usually absent in the developed countries (such as chronic malnutrition, malaria, tuberculosis, pneumonia and HIV). [12] Furthermore it has been shown that the increased mortality rate due to an influenza pandemic is strongly associated with per capita income. [11] It is apparent that the burden of the next pandemic will also be focused overwhelmingly on the developing world, a point made by the WHO and others. [5, 11, [13] [14] [15] A substantial number of pandemic influenza models have been constructed in the past decade. A key goal of this effort is to determine the effectiveness of interventions, in terms of their ability to reduce infection and consequential mortality rates. Although it has been recognized that the major burden of mortality from influenza pandemics is suffered by low-income countries [5, 11, 16] the primary focus of the vast majority of these models is on examining intervention effectiveness in developed (e.g., the USA and European countries [17] [18] [19] [20] ) and middle income countries (e.g., Thailand [21, 22] ). Given the markedly different demographic and community structure, as well as resource and infrastructural constraints in comparison with developed countries, these models have limited capability to predict the impact of an influenza pandemic on low-income countries [23] . In addition, many low-income countries are located in tropical or subtropical regions where the timing and impact of influenza epidemics are more poorly understood than in temperate regions, where they are known to have a well-defined winter season. [15] To address this 'modelling gap' an individual-based disease transmission model of pandemic influenza has been developed for Papua New Guinea (PNG), based on the methods used previously to develop a pandemic influenza model of Albany, Western 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 The model was used to describe the spread of a novel influenza strain after introduction into the community.

Using virus intrinsic transmission characteristics calibrated with the Australian model, simulations were performed using the Madang model.

The addition of such contact hubs increased individual-to-individual contacts and hence infection transmission opportunities (see Table 2 ) with approximately 2,000 additional symptomatic infections resulting, for all three (mitigated and non-mitigated) scenarios.

For the Madang-nnh (no neighbourhood hub) model, school closure is approximately 3.5 times less effective compared to the Albany model. Table 2 (middle panel) indicates an illness attack rate of ~15,000 in Madang compared to ~4,800 in Albany. Much higher case numbers occur in households, workplaces and the wider community (including neighbourhood hubs) than in Albany, highlighting the poorer efficacy of this intervention strategy in a PNG setting. The Madang-nnh model also results in higher household and workplace transmission than the Albany model. Note that while there is a significantly higher proportion of under 17 year old children in Madang (40%) compared to Albany (28%), our field survey indicates that 50% of school age children in Madang do not attend school, hence school closure is less effective in disrupting the transmission chain (i.e., household 1-to-school-to-household 2) compared to Australia.

As with all modelling studies, the accuracy of results is limited by the quality of data used to construct the model. In the case of influenza epidemic modelling, outcomes are dependent on assumptions about the number, duration and physical closeness of contacts between people, and how these attributes of contact affect transmission probability. These data are very difficult to estimate, with the best data source available being [46] . In the absence of high-quality reliable data, we have made plausible assumptions regarding interpersonal contact, and, in the Albany case, these are reflective of the data in [46] .",

            "text": "The interventions used in the present study are based on social distancing. Surveys have shown that a higher proportion of low-income countries have social distancing interventions planned in the case of a pandemic, compared to high income European 17 countries due to their feasibility and cost-effectiveness. [3, 4, 6, 8, 47, 48] Pharmaceutical-based interventions were not considered in this study due to cost and delivery issues found with low-income countries. [4, 8] Consideration may need to be given to some form of antiviral agent use, possibly for case treatment, given the poor performance of purely social distancing interventions in developing countries as suggested by this study. The advantage of antiviral use is that it may be targeted at reducing within-household transmission, a location of transmission otherwise not impacted by social distancing interventions. The present study shows that larger numbers of transmissions occur within households due to the larger household sizes in countries such as PNG. Furthermore, low-income countries generally have population health profiles not seen in developed countries, including the prevalence of diseases such as malaria, tuberculosis and HIV. [49] Antiviral treatment of influenza cases co-infected with such diseases may be an appropriate intervention strategy given the poorer health outcomes which co-morbidity may impose. [12] The provision and use of antiviral agents will have challenges not faced by industrialised countries, due to the cost of providing an antiviral stockpile and subsequent distribution of antivirals in countries which have health systems already stretched to capacity. [15] The importance of suitable pandemic influenza preparedness plans for low-income countries is recognized by the WHO [50, 51]. Disease transmission models will play a role in guiding policy makers in determining the effectiveness of possible pandemic countermeasures. History tells us that low-income countries are likely to be more affected, yet almost all models deal with mitigation strategies for developed nations with good health infrastructure and low prevalence of endemic diseases. These countries have poorer access to antiviral drug and vaccine-based interventions and higher extant disease burdens, compared to developed countries. For the reasons, development of appropriate intervention strategies focused on countries such as PNG needs to occur. 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 (top table) , Madang (centre table) and Madang-nnh (bottom table) models are presented. One of the key differences between the Albany and the Madang models is that ~50% of school age children do not attend school in Madang compared to Albany. There are ~8900 school age children in Madang among which ~4300 do not attend school. Another key difference is ~5700 individuals (including unemployed adults and the ~50% of children not attending school) in Madang are assumed to mix in neighbourhood hubs. If no neighbourhood hubs are included, then the individuals who are in neighbourhood hubs in the Madang model in daytime would mix only in their households, as in the Madangnnh model. The baseline assumption in the main results is that individuals in neighbourhood hubs mix with 10 other individuals. If this value is assumed to be 20 or 30 individuals, additional contacts gives increased transmission and results in higher final attack rates. The table gives the final attack rate and their corresponding 95% CI (presented in parentheses, shaded rows) for the Madang model for the no intervention, school closure, and rigorous social distancing scenarios, under the assumption that the neighbourhood group size is 10, 20 or 30 individuals. Compliance with home isolation of school children following school closure intervention has been examined and compliance reduction from 100% to 50% considered. Effects of reduced compliances on the illness attack rates and their corresponding 95% CI (in parentheses, shaded rows) are presented in Table A4 . For the purely school closure intervention, the illness attack rate increases by ~3% in Albany as reduced isolation permits additional child-to-child contact. In the Madang models, reduced compliance with home isolation during the period of school closure has minimal effect on the attack rate. This is due to ~50% school age children not attending school. In all three models, reduced compliance has minimal effect if additional rigorous social distancing interventions are also applied. Alternative intervention activation timing assumptions for school closure, workforce reduction and community contact reduction are examined and two different settings are considered. Effects of these alternative assumptions on the illness attack rates and their corresponding 95% CI (in parentheses, shaded rows) are presented. 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59  60 ",

The effectiveness of social distancing interventions was determined using the PNG model and contrasted with the Australian model.Key messagesA moderately transmissible pandemic occurring in PNG may be expected to result in a larger illness attack rate compared to that in a developed country setting.Feasible social distancing intervention strategies may be significantly less effective in PNG compared to the Australian setting. Compared to Australia, the larger household sizes contribute both to the larger attack rates in PNG and to the lower effectiveness of the interventions.The larger proportion of children in PNG and the fact that 50% do not attend school lessen the effectiveness of school closure interventions.",
