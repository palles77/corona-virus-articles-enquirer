The rotavirus gene encoding the VP7 protein was cloned into the coronavirus cDNA. BALB/c and STAT1-deficient mice were inoculated with the recombinant viral vector rTGEV S-MHV -VP7, which replicates in the intestine and spreads to other organs such as liver, spleen and lungs. TGEV-specific antibodies were detected in all the inoculated BALB/c mice, while rotavirusspecific antibodies were found only after immunization by the intraperitoneal route. Partial protection against rotavirus-induced diarrhea was achieved in suckling BALB/c mice born to dams immunized with the recombinant virus expressing VP7 when they were orally challenged with the homotypic rotavirus strain.",

TGEV has a single-stranded, plus sense 28.5-kb RNA genome (Penzes et al., 2001) . Open reading frames (ORFs) 1a and 1b, which encode the replicase (rep) are located at the 5\u2032-end of the genome and comprise approximately two-thirds of the entire RNA. The 3\u2032-end of the genome includes the genes encoding structural and nonstructural proteins, in the order 5\u2032-S-3a-3b-E-M-N-7-3\u2032 and occupy one-third of the genome de Groot et al., 2010) . TGEVs are enveloped spherical viruses containing four essential structural proteins: the membrane (M), the small envelope (E), the spike (S), and the nucleocapsid (N) proteins. The M protein spans the membrane three or four times and interacts with the nucleocapsid (N) and spike (S) proteins during assembly (Escors et al., 2001) . The S protein, a large type I transmembrane glycoprotein, forms peplomers and is responsible for viral attachment to specific host receptors and membrane fusion (Lewicki and Gallagher, 2002; Sune et al., 1990 ). The small envelope (E) protein is a transmembrane protein that is present as a minor structural component. The N protein wraps the genomic RNA into a nucleocapsid (Escors et al., 2001; Kapke and Brian, 1986) .",

Since coronaviruses generally infect mucosal surfaces, both respiratory and enteric, they could be used to target the antigen to the enteric and respiratory areas to induce a strong secretory immune response; (iv) the tropism of coronaviruses may be engineered by modifying the S gene (Haijema et al., 2003; Kuo et al., 2000; Sanchez et al., 1999) ; (v) nonpathogenic coronavirus strains infecting most species of interest (human, porcine, bovine, canine, feline, and avian) are available and therefore suitable to develop safe vectors; and (vi) infectious coronavirus cDNA clones (Almazan et al., 2000; Casais et al., 2001; Thiel et al., 2001; Yount et al., 2003) and coronavirus-derived replicons (Almazan et al., 2004 (Almazan et al., , 2006 are available to design expression systems.",

In this study, a viral vector has been developed based on porcine transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV) full-length genome sequence expressing the rotavirus VP7 protein. Genetic engineering techniques were used to generate this recombinant vector from a cDNA fragment containing the full-length genome sequence of TGEV. Thereafter, the tropism of the TGEV-derived vector was modified by replacing the spike S protein with the homologous protein from mouse hepatitis virus (MHV-A59 strain). The recombinant vector replicated stably in vitro in murine cell cultures producing the rotavirus VP7 protein. The vector was inoculated to BALB/c and STAT1\u2212/\u2212 mice and in vivo replication was confirmed in different organs by RT-PCR and immunofluores-cence of histological sections. BALB/c mice immunized with the vector produced rotavirus-specific IgG and IgA class antibodies, as determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Cytokine production in serum samples and cultivated splenocytes of inoculated mice was determined by analysing protein levels of 10 cytokines using a multiplex bead-based flow cytometry assay. The protection study in the newborn mouse model demonstrated partial protection (62% of the challenged animals) against rotavirus-induced diarrhea by the homotypic rotavirus RF strain.",

The plasmid pBAC-TGEV-S MHV -C11 was transfected into BHK-21 cells that 6 h later were overlaid into monolayers of murine LR7 or porcine ST cells to select for recombinants that had acquired the ability to infect murine cells and had simultaneously lost the ability to infect porcine cells (Fig. 1 ). LR7 monolayers cocultured with BHK-21 transfected cells exhibited syncytia formation 48 h posttransfection. By contrast, ST monolayers cocultured with BHK-21 transfected cells did not show detectable cytopathic effect, even up to 96 h posttransfection (data not shown). The growth kinetics of the rTGEV S-MHV/C11 , TGEV, and MHV-A59 in porcine ST and murine LR7 cells were compared (Fig. 2) . The growth rate of MHV-A59 and rTGEV S-MHV/C11 was quite similar; however, MHV-A59 reached a peak titer (3 \u00d7 10 6 PFU/mL) sooner than rTGEV S-MHV/C11 (5 \u00d7 10 5 PFU/mL), at 12 and 24 h postinfection, respectively. only in porcine ST cells, in which MHV-A59 and rTGEV S-MHV/C11 failed to grow, thus indicating that TGEV S protein replacement with the chimerical TGEV-MHV-A59 S protein had altered the host species specificity of the virus (Fig. 2 ).",

Consistently, recombinant viruses were unable to produce syncytia or cytopathic effects in porcine ST cells. As shown in Fig. 3A , no plaques of any size were evident on ST cell monolayers at 72 h postinoculation with recombinant viruses, in contrast to the plaques generated by wild-type TGEV on the same cells. In the same postinfection period, however, smaller plaques were obvious on LR7 cells infected with rTGEV S-MHV/C11 , while wild-type TGEV was unable to form plaques on these cells. These results confirmed that TGEV S protein replacement with chimerical TGEV/MHV S protein was sufficient to change the species tropism of the virus. The rTGEV S-MHV/C11 virus grew successfully in LR7 cells, causing an extensive syncytia and cytopathic effect comparable to that of MHV-A59. This indicated that rTGEV S-MHV/C11 had acquired the capacity to generate syncytia, which is typical of MHV-A59 but not of TGEV, due to the expression of the MHV-A59 S protein (Fig. 3B) . These results were further confirmed by infecting CMR cells (Caco-2 transfected with the MHV receptor) with rTGEV S-MHV/C11 (results not shown). The growth kinetics of the recombinant rTGEV S-MHV/C11 vector in different murine cells lines showed that LR7 was the most productive cell line, reaching a titer of 6 \u00d7 10 7 FFU/mL). The CMR cells yielded titers of 10 6 FFU/mL, whereas other cell lines (3T3, MC57 and BALB Cl.7) yielded lower titers (less than 10 4 FFU/mL) (results not shown).",

One control group was inoculated intragastrically with rTGEV S-MHV/C11 . Anti-TGEV serum IgG antibody responses were detected at high titers in the mice inoculated intranasally and intraperitoneally (1/2500) (p b 0.05), and at lower titers in mice inoculated intragastrically (1/500) (p b 0.05) (Fig. 6A ). We examined whether intranasal inoculation of rTGEV produces antigen-specific IgA in the mucosal compartment. To test whether a mucosal response was induced, intestinal contents as well as serum samples from immunized mice were analyzed by ELISA for TGEV intestinal IgA. The second inoculation of rTGEV led to a significant increase (p b 0.05) of detectable serum IgA, which rose slightly after the third inoculation (Fig. 7) . IgA levels in the intestinal contents varied between animals, with detection of IgA production in the intestinal lumen in two out of six inoculated mice (results not shown).

However, although the engineered TGEV with murine tropism replicated in murine cells, it reached titers of at least 1 log lower than the parental virus MHV. This suggests that the replication machinery of TGEV is slightly less efficient in mouse cells, and that specific cell factors present in porcine cells may be required for optimum virus replication. In other reports in which S chimeric proteins were assembled between MHV (murine tropism) and FIPV (feline tropism) the viral titer decreased from 10 to 100 times, providing additional support for the requirement of species-specific cell factors for optimum coronavirus replication (Kuo et al., 2000) .",

MHV usually causes subclinical infection, producing significant mortality in immunodeficient mice only (Compton et al., 1993) . There are two major disease patterns of MHV based on the tropism of the viral strain, the respiratory and the enteric pattern, which have been identified by intranasal inoculation of mice with different MHV strains (Barthold and Smith, 1984) . In the enteric pattern (mainly produced by JHM strain), the virus infects intestinal mucosa and spreads to the organs and bloodstream. Meanwhile, in the respiratory pattern (represented by A-59 strain) the virus primarily replicates in the nasal cavity and infects the olfactory bulb, thus entering the brain through the olfactory nerve. The inhaled virus invades the lungs, with subsequent viremia and dissemination to other organs through the bloodstream. Our data suggest that the recombinant rTGEV S-MHV/C11 virus follows a respiratory rather than an enteric pattern. The virus infected both strains of mice evaluated in this study, BALB/c and immunocompromised STAT1\u2212/\u2212 mice. In addition to having changed species tropism, a modification in tissue tropism was also observed. The recombinant virus replicated in the lungs, showing a respiratory pattern similar to the parental virus MHV-A59, infecting the same organs but less efficiently. Viral RNA was detected in different organs, and replication was confirmed by immunofluorescence assays on tissue sections. In fact, infectious virus was recovered by cell culture. These results were confirmed by analyzing the kinetics of viral RNA detection. Our data suggest that the recombinant virus was attenuated in mice, particularly if its virulence is compared with that of MHV, which is lethal for STAT1\u2212/\u2212 mice (Durbin et al., 1996) . These authors showed that litters of this knockout mouse died of fulminant hepatitis. The engineered rTGEV S-MHV/C11 vector was attenuated in STAT1\u2212/\u2212 mice as no deaths were recorded in this mouse strain.",

            "text": "The results of this study show that the engineered rTGEV vector promoted an immune response in BALB/c mice to the vector itself and to the rotavirus VP7 protein. The recombinant virus triggered a humoral response in mice via systemic (serum IgG and IgA) and mucosal (intestinal IgA) antibodies. Nevertheless, only partial protection was achieved. This could be due to the limited stability of the heterologous gene within the vector. The stability of heterologous genes within viral vectors is associated to virus recombination and mutation rates. Insertion of foreign genes in coronavirus may result in large deletions rather than point mutations (de Haan et al., 2005) , and these deletions can be caused by intra and inter-molecular recombination events (Lai, 1996) . The emergence of deletion variants without foreign genes may led to viruses with higher fitness. Probably this is the main drawback that compromises coronaviruses efficacy as vectors. Besides, recombinant proteins may also contain toxic domains that can affect the level of heterologous gene expression. In principle, this limitation can be overcome by identification of these toxic domains and their elimination by site-directed mutagenesis. Previous attempts to develop a rotavirus vaccine through the expression of cloned genes encoding the outer capsid proteins VP4 or VP7 have achieved diverse results. In most studies, trials immunizing animals against rotavirus by VP7 protein expression have been of limited success due to the complexity and instability of neutralization domains of the expressed VP7 (McGonigal et al., 1992; Salas-Vidal et al., 1990) . In other studies, only antibodies to denatured VP7 were induced, indicating that the expressed protein was immunogenic; however, it did not elicit the formation of antibodies that neutralized virus (Johnson et al., 1989; Salas-Vidal et al., 1990) . Some authors suggest that calcium binding is necessary to form the neutralization domain on expressed VP7 (Dormitzer et al., 1994) . Studies of VP7 expression in prokaryotic vectors (E. coli and attenuated strains of S. typhimurium) obtained disappointing results (Arias et al., 1986; McCrae and McCorquodale, 1987) . Expression of rotavirus in vaccinia virus vector gave good results when VP7 was expressed on the plasma membrane of infected cells, which was achieved by adding the membrane anchor and cytoplasmatic domain from influenza virus hemagglutinin (Andrew et al., 1990) . Similar results were reported for the same VP7 construct expressed in a recombinant type 5 adenovirus (Both et al., 1993) .",

Data are mean values \u00b1 SD. *Significantly higher than cytokine levels produced by preimmune sera or not stimulated splenocytes (p b 0.05 by the Mann-Whitney test or Wilcoxon test). Non S, nonstimulated. inoculation than the intragastric or intranasal routes. This antibody response was enhanced after the second inoculation and was maintained after the third inoculation. Specific antibody response to the vector itself was detected in mice inoculated by all three routes. The virus may infect organs through mucosal surfaces at low efficiency, whereas a direct route of inoculation, such as the intraperitoneal route, probably led to an increased viral replication allowing a wider dissemination of the vector to other tissues, and thus a stronger immune response. Production of mucosal IgA antibodies against VP7 was not detected in BALB/c mice inoculated intragastrically with rTGEV S-MHV/C11 -VP7. In contrast, anti-TGEV intestinal IgA antibodies were induced after intragastric inoculation with rTGEV S-MHV/C11 , although in only two out of six inoculated mice. The low replication of the recombinant virus in BALB/c mice probably hampered the antibody IgA response in mucosal areas.",

IL-10 was induced only after splenocyte stimulation with rTGEV S-MHV/C11 virus, but not with rTGEV S-MHV/C11 -VP7, possibly due to a lower priming by this recombinant. In line with our results, enhanced IL-10 production has also been reported in splenocytes of mice coinfected with MHV and Trypanosoma cruzi, and endogenous IL-10 downregulates IFN-\u03b3 production (Torrecilhas et al., 1999) . Furthermore, we found an increase in GM-CSF levels in the serum and in stimulated splenocytes of the inoculated mice. GM-CSF strongly influences the biological functions of many different phagocytic and immune cells, stimulating the production of granulocytes and monocytes (Rasko, 1997) .",

We observed that maternal rotavirus-specific antibodies partially protected suckling newborns against rotavirus-induced diarrhea. Suckling pups born to dams inoculated with rTGEV-VP7 by the intragastric or intraperitoneal routes were challenged orally with homotypic (RF) or heterotypic (EDIM) rotavirus. Sixty-two percent of pups from mothers immunized intraperitoneally were protected against rotavirus RF diarrhea, although only 13% of pups from mothers immunized intragastrically were also protected. However, when challenged with the heterotypic murine EDIM strain, only 18% of pups born to intraperitoneally immunized dams were protected against diarrhea. These results are consistent with the differences in VP7 antigenicity between RF (G6 serotype) and EDIM (G3 serotype) rotavirus strains and also coincide with antibody production, because only female mice that produced rotavirus-specific antibodies protected their pups against rotavirus-induced diarrhea. The expression of other VP7 proteins with different antigenic specificities and the simultaneous coexpression of different rotavirus proteins must be addressed in order to achieve more efficient protection against rotavirus infection using TGEV-derived vectors.",

Briefly, serum samples were inactivated for 30 min at 56\u00b0C and serially diluted 4-fold in MEM (Gibco). All dilutions were incubated in the presence of 50-100 peroxidase focus forming-units of rotavirus RF strain for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. Then, each mix was added in duplicate to MA104 cell culture monolayers grown in 96-well microtiter plates (Costar) and incubated at 37\u00b0C. At 18 h.p.i., the cells were fixed with methanol/acetone and an immunoperoxidase assay was performed. Briefly, MAb 2F3E7 against rotavirus VP6 protein was diluted in 1:200 in PBS-BSA and allowed to react with the monolayer for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. After three washes, the secondary antibody HRPconjugated against mouse IgG (Sigma) diluted 1:2000 in PBS-BSA was added for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. The plates were then washed five times with PBS and stained with DAB (Fast DAB, Sigma). Neutralizing titers were considered as the inverse of the sample dilution that showed 60% reduction of peroxidase focus forming-units.",
