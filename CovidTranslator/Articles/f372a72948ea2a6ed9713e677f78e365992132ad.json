Acute respiratory tract infections of the upper and lower respiratory tract are caused by a wide variety of viral and bacterial pathogens, which require comprehensive laboratory investigations. Conventional serological and immunofluorescence-based diagnostic methods for acute respiratory tract infections lack sensitivity when compared to polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based approaches and the development of new diagnostic methodologies is required, to provide accurate, sensitive and rapid diagnoses.",

The performance of this DNA microarray-based analysis exhibited comparable sensitivities and specificities to multiplex real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reactions (rtPCRs) confirming the potential diagnostic utility of the method. In contrast to routine multiplex PCR, the microarray incorporates an intrinsic redundancy as multiple and non-identical probes per target on the array allow direct intra-assay confirmation of positives. This study demonstrates that microarray technology provides a viable alternative to conventional serological-based approaches and multiplex PCR for pathogen identification in acute respiratory tract infections.",

In 2002, lower respiratory tract infections accounted for 3.9 million deaths worldwide; 6.9% of all deaths that year (WHO, 2004) . Viral and bacterial co-infections are frequently observed using PCR-based investigation, which in many cases are not detected by current serological-based and direct antigen detection methods. Therefore, the development of new diagnostic methods is required to enable the detection of a broad range of pathogens. Indeed an accurate, sensitive and rapid differential diagnosis can influence patient management, reduce potentially inappropriate antibiotic use and aid infection control measures in institutional settings.",

However, viral antigen detection tests are used increasingly because of low demand on equipment and cost effectiveness (Grandien, 1996) . In addition, virus isolation is slow, expensive and labour intensive; often requiring 1-5 days incubation to detect or confirm the absence of cytopathic effects. In addition, with decreasing resources fewer clinical laboratories have the appropriate facilities and expertise to undertake culturebased investigations (Koenig et al., 2001) . Culture-based methods are also used for bacterial detection and are also hampered by slow turnaround times for reporting of results and insufficient sensitivity (Peters et al., 2004) . Serological profiling is also used often, however, this can require more than two weeks for antibodies to develop and sequential samples, which are often not collected and are usually required to confirm the diagnosis (Nilsson et al., 2008; Wong et al., 2008) .",

Molecular techniques offer several advantages over conventional serology-based methods, including speed, ease of standardisation, automation and high assay sensitivities and specificities (Dong et al., 2008) . To date, DNA microarray technology has been used predominantly for gene expression profiling studies in basic research applications (Hegde et al., 2000) . Clinical presentations of acute respiratory tract infections are diverse and non-specific; therefore an efficient laboratory assay that can detect a panel of common respiratory pathogens would be advantageous. In addition, large-scale screening may identify co-infections, which would not have been detected previously. Microarray-based analysis is a cost-effective approach that yields reproducible results and can allow replicate analyses in a single assay run. This is achieved by spotting of solid phase arrays with multiple copies of the same probe, alternative probes within the same target amplicon and/or mismatch probes allowing intra-assay confirmation of results that is not readily possible with multiplex rtPCR-based approaches.",

The chip may contain a number of different probe types depending on the specific application and allows all steps of the hybridisation reaction to be conducted within the AT vessel, obviating the requirement for a separate hybridisation chamber or other additional laboratory equipment. The hybridised target is visualised by enzyme-catalysed precipitation and the microtubes are read using a simple low cost, transmission scanner. A previous study revealed that specific hybridisation to virus-specific oligonucleotide probes can be obtained from a single PCR amplifiable target copy .",

Variations in sample quality may impact on the viability of virus for culture and also the number of available cells for immunofluorescence investigation, whereas PCR is less impacted by poor sample quality. Therefore, molecular techniques are required for an accurate and rapid diagnosis. PCR tests are considered very sensitive, and our data has shown that the combined PCR and DNA microarray-based assay was capable of detecting and identifying 18 pathogens from throat swab specimens in a single run.

In addition, precipitation staining utilised in the microarray approach described herein does not have problems with respect to signal stability, quenching effects and cross-talk between detectors which can be encountered with rtPCR. Most importantly, microarrays have a significantly greater multiplexing capability than rtPCR as presently a maximum of five targets can be analysed per well which in best practice would employ one filter for the internal control leaving only four filters to detect pathogens per reaction.

This technology allows for differential diagnoses and an advantage of the microarray is that it provides more clinically relevant information. This technology will inevitably impact on the management strategy of respiratory infections and potentially could be employed to limit outbreaks in institutions as well as to decrease empiric antibiotic usage where the pathogen responsible can be shown to be viral. The ability to attach large numbers of probes on each solid phase and the comparatively low cost per pathogen tested of such an oligonucleotide microarray-based assay compared to multiplex rtPCR suggests it may be a potential alternative for clinical testing. Furthermore, the increased capacity of such testing will broaden the approach to diagnosis and patient management. Timely molecular test results can contribute to good antimicrobial stewardship and help prevent secondary complications associated with antibiotic treatment, such as intravenous line infections or potential toxic/allergic side effects. Of the 7 patients with an Influenza A or B positive test result, two had been admitted to general medical wards. The admission of influenza patients into open wards poses a significant infection control hazard as this could potentially result in influenza outbreaks. Molecular testing of respiratory specimens could help initiate appropriate isolation and infection control measures to protect other patients.",

However, this technology is also being employed in the clinical laboratory for diagnosis of viral pathogens in clinical specimens and can potentially become a frontline screening assay supplanting quantitative PCR in the management of herpesvirus and adenoviral infections in the immunocompromised patient population (Muller et al., 2009) . While high-density in situ synthesised DNA microarrays can offer a greater analytical sensitivity and can accommodate a greater number of probes for a more advanced approach to analysis, e.g. resequencing microarrays (Lin et al., 2007) and genotyping (Lodes et al., 2007) , low density DNA microarray-based analysis is a cost-effective assay concept. In the future, combining microarray hybridisation with high-throughput, automated DNA extraction and amplification will have a significant impact on high-throughout analysis. Regarding the role of spotted DNA microarrays in diagnostics, we have shown that a suitable low density platform is available for the development of diagnostic assays. Though less sensitive, this may paradoxically be of benefit in the identification of clinically significant levels of pathogen. The cost and ease of automation incorporating liquid handling and multiplexing capability makes this platform an attractive alternative technique for the standardisation purposes required in clinical diagnostics. This is specifically relevant when current commercial assays do not meet the test algorithms for a particular clinical laboratory and this may have an impact on the approach to specimen testing in the clinical laboratory and hospital setting. This will inevitably aid the detection, monitoring and therapeutic treatment of disease. DNA microarray-based analysis may thus be a potential alternative for clinical testing, providing more information on pathogens allowing better assessment of the viral aetiopathogenic agent(s) responsible for respiratory illness in the case viral and bacterial of co-infections.",
