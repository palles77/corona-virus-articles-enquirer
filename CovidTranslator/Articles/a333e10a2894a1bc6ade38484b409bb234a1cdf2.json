Of six homogenization buffers tested, 0.1 M citrate buffer (pH 7.0) gave the best results for the ICA. In the ICA, addition of 0.1% thioglycolic acid in the homogenization buffers that have been widely used in enzymelinked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) was deleterious to the reaction because of undesirable coagulation of the colloidal gold. ICA using the anti-SDV monoclonal antibodies was 8 times and 16 times more sensitive than double antibody sandwich-ELISA and ICA using the anti-SDV polyclonal antibody, respectively. The analysis is complete in only 15 min. Furthermore, ICA using the anti-SDV monoclonal antibodies could also detect SDV-related viruses.",

Therefore, we focused our attention on developing rapid, simple detection methods for SDV. A rapid immunofi lter paper assay (RIPA) has been developed and is often used to detect plant viruses (Tsuda et al. 1992; Ohki and Kameya-Iwaki 1996) . Although we tried this method for SDV, we could barely detect the virus in 1 : 10 diluted extracts of SDVinfected plants. An immunochromatographic assay (ICA) was also developed to detect pathogens of humans such as hepatitis B virus, infl uenza virus, and others (Sato et al. 1996; Vaughn et al. 1998; Guan et al. 2004; Weinberg and Walker 2005) . Recently, ICA has been used in plant detection devices, the Pocket Diagnostic (Central Science Laboratory, York, UK) and ImmunoStrip (Agdia, Elkhart, IN, USA), for viruses of vegetable and ornamental plants. ICA is a very simple and rapid test with a one-step sample application, as opposed to ELISA with multiple steps such as washing, incubation, and secondary color development. Therefore, we developed a new system and a versatile plastic assay device for ICA for plant viruses, and we report here on the fi rst application of the ICA system in detecting SDV in the fi eld.",

To determine which of the six homogenization buffers was the most suitable for ICA, the ICA results using four different virus isolates and the buffers were compared. Of the six buffers, 0.1 M CB gave the strongest, most stable staining (Table 1) . When using 0.1% thioglycolic acid in the homogenization buffers, none of the virus isolates produced any positive test lines and the intensities of all reference lines were very weak. Sensitivities of ICA and DAS-ELISA were compared using young shoots from an SDV-infected tree at the end of July (Table 2) . ICA using Mabs remained sensitive up to a 1 : 640 dilution, while DAS-ELISA remained sensitive to a dilution of 1 : 80, indicating that ICA using Mabs is eight times more sensitive than DAS-ELISA.",

The anti-SDV polyclonal antibody-colloidal gold conjugate suspension was prepared at a concentration of optical density at 520 nm (OD) of 0.208, and was deposited onto glass fi ber; Case 3-2, The immunochromatographic device conditions were as described in Case 3-1, except that the concentration of optical density at 520 nm (OD) was 0.416; Case 3-3, The immunochromatographic device conditions were as described in Case 3-1, except that the concentration of optical density at 520 nm (OD) was 0.833; Case 1, The immunochromatographic device conditions were as described in Case 3-1, except that all the antibodies were monoclonal and the concentration of optical density at 520 nm (OD) was 0.305 a S-58 polyclonal antibody b Test line intensities for ICA: + +, strong (positive); +, moderate (positive); \u00b1, weak (positive); \u2212, negative was performed. The concentrations of the conjugate in cases 3-1, 3-2, and 3-3 were adjusted to give absorbances of 0.208, 0.416, and 0.833 at 520 nm, respectively. In case 3-1, the ICA detected SDV up to a dilution of 1 : 40 of the infected young shoot and was negative for the uninfected shoot, while ICA in cases 3-2 and 3-3 produced falsepositive lines for the uninfected shoot. On the other hand, ICA using the Mabs detected SDV up to a dilution of 1 : 640 and produced no false-positive lines for the uninfected shoot. This indicated that the sensitivity of ICA using Mabs was 16 times higher than ICA with the Pab. The effect of the concentration of the anti-SDV monoclonal antibody on the nitrocellulose membrane was also evaluated. From 0.25 to 2.0 mg/ml, the sensitivity reached a plateau at 1 mg/ml. Therefore, we selected 1 mg/ml as the optimum concentration (data not shown).",

Homogenization buffers without thioglycolic acid have been reported by Salomone and Roggero (2002) and Salomone et al.

Of the six homogenization buffers tested, 0.1 M citrate buffer (pH 7.0) gave the best results. assembled on an adhesive plastic sheet cut into 6-mm wide strips inserted in a plastic device Citrus tristeza virus in ICA using polyclonal antibody returned 5% false positives in the total test results when compared with ELISA; thus, this level was acceptable only as a screening method (Salomone et al. 2004 ). Porter et al. (1999) reported that ICA and ELISA were similar for sensitivity and specifi city in the detection of dengue virus. Guan et al.

As for specifi city, the reactivity of ICA was clearer than the ELISA kit for SDV-RV (seven virus isolates) detection and ELISA with the same combination of Mabs (Table 4) . We think the 100% specifi city (seven of seven samples) was the reason that ICA requires no washing process and that the complex of the colloidal gold conjugates and virus moves on the nitrocellulose strip by capillary action.
