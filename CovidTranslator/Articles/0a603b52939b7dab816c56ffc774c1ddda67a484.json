Currently, over a billion people travel annually, with over 65 million visits made from the UK. Seeking pre-travel advice should be an essential part of any trip for a traveller. The key elements of pretravel advice are health risk assessment, health promotion and risk management; this involves advice on prevention of malaria, travellers' diarrhoea, sexually transmitted infections and accidents, as well as appropriate vaccinations.
