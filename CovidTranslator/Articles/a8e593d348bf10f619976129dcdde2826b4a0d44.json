Infection of a number of inbred mouse strains, including BALB/c, C57BL/6, and 129S, with primary human isolates of SARS-CoV results in the replication of the virus within the lung tissue without the subsequent development of readily apparent clinical disease (11, 16, 41) . Infection of aged BALB/c mice results in clinically apparent disease that more closely mimics some aspects of SARS in humans (36) . However, immune responses in aged mice are known to be altered (5, 15) , and thus, the mechanisms that control the induction of disease may differ between adult and aged mice. Recent work has demonstrated that serial passage of SARS-CoV in mice results in a mouse adaptation that leads to more profound replication of the virus in the lung (28, 34) . However, the time to death from this mouse-adapted SARS-CoV is 3 to 5 days, which is much more rapid than the time to mortality observed in fatal cases of SARS in humans.",

Our results demonstrate that MHV-1 replicates to similar levels in the lung in each of these inbred strains of mice regardless of their relative levels of susceptibility, as measured by weight loss and clinical illness. Both A/J and C3H/HeJ mice exhibited enhanced weight loss and clinical illness following i.n. MHV-1 infection compared to BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice. Analysis of many different inbred mouse strains confirmed A/J and C3H/HeJ mice as the most susceptible to i.n. MHV-1 infection. Interestingly, C3H/HeJ mice harboring a natural mutation in the gene that encodes Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) that disrupts its normal function exhibited greatly increased morbidity and mortality after i.n. MHV-1 infection compared to wild-type C3H/HeN mice. Our results indicate that TLR4 plays an important role in respiratory CoV pathogenesis.",

Tissues were initially screened to define the breadth of morphological parameters that were of interest for subsequent histopathologic grading.

Histopathologic grading of lesions was modified from previous descriptions (4, 14, 38) . The distribution of lesions was graded as follows: 1, absent to rare detection; 2, localized focus to multifocal, involving less than \u03f31/3 of the lung parenchyma; 3, multifocal to coalescing foci, involving \u03f31/3 to 2/3 of the lung parenchyma; and 4, coalescing to diffuse, involving more than \u03f32/3 of the lung parenchyma. Edema was defined as eosinophilic seroproteinaceous fluid within the alveolar lumen. The edema severity was graded as follows: 1, absent to rare detection; 2, mild, partially filling the alveoli with lacy to wispy fluid; 3, moderate, with partial filling of alveoli by pools of eosinophilic fluid; and 4, severe, with complete filling of alveoli by eosinophilic fluid with absence of detectable air space. During infection, pulmonary inflammation was primarily composed of lymphocytes, macrophages, and variable numbers of neutrophils. This infiltrate was localized to interstitial and perivascular spaces with a general lack of airway involvement. Accordingly, the severity of cellular infiltration was graded as follows: 1, absent to rare detection of interstitial inflammatory cells; 2, mild, with increased cellularity with minimal alteration of alveolar septa/interstitium thickness; 3, moderate, with increased cellularity of alveolar septa/interstitium with increased wall thickness and perivascular aggregates of inflammatory cells; 4, severe, with coalescing aggregates of perivascular inflammatory cells, increased cellularity and thickness of the alveolar septa/ interstitium with increased inflammation \"spillover\" into the alveolar lumen.

At day 4 p.i., all four strains of mice exhibited high titers of MHV-1 in the lungs, with A/J mice exhibiting significantly (P \u03fd 0.05) higher virus titers than C3H/ HeJ mice. There was no significant (P \u03fe 0.05) difference in the virus titers between A/J mice and either BALB/c or C57BL/6 mice. Interestingly, C57BL/6 mice, which did not exhibit weight loss or show any signs of clinical illness, had levels of virus that were not statistically different (P \u03fe 0.05) than those of C3H/HeJ and BALB/c mice, which both exhibited weight loss and clinical disease at this time point (Fig. 1) .

Figure 3A to D shows a representative section taken at day 9 p.i. from each strain of mice at low power to demonstrate the relative amount of edema that developed in the lungs of each strain. In all mouse strains examined, MHV-1 infection induced a diffuse mononuclear cell infiltration in the lungs that was primarily localized to interstitial and perivascular spaces with a general lack of airway involvement. We did not observe significant strain-dependent differences in the distribution of inflammatory cells in the lung. However, A/J and C3H/HeJ mice exhibited more prominent pathological changes in the lung, including hyaline membrane formations, syncytia, fibrin depositions, cellular necrosis, and severe pulmonary edema (Fig. 3E to H) . A/J mice exhibited significantly higher (P \u03fd 0.05) total inflammatory scores at days 5 and 9 p.i. than C57BL/6 mice (Fig. 4A ).

In contrast, total mononuclear cell counts in the lungs of A/J, BALB/c, and C57BL/6 mice were similar between days 5 and 9 p.i., whereas C3H/HeJ mice exhibited a sharp increase in the number of mononuclear cells at days 7 to 9 p.i. (Fig. 5B) . Examination of the character of the inflammatory cells within the BAL fluid of BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice revealed that the majority of the infiltrating cells were lymphocytes and macrophages ( Fig. 6A to C) . In contrast, A/J mice showed a higher proportion of neutrophils at day 5 p.i., which subsequently declined by days 7 and 9 p.i. Interestingly, a high proportion of neutrophils were found in the BAL of C3H/HeJ mice at all time points examined. These results indicate that the increased severity of disease exhibited by A/J and C3H/HeJ mice is not the result of an increased magnitude of pulmonary inflammation compared to BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice.",

To examine both major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-linked, and non-MHC-linked factors, disease severity was evaluated in 10 additional strains of inbred mice to determine their relative susceptibilities to i.n. MHV-1 infection. C57BL/6 mice (H-2 b MHC) were resistant to MHV-1-induced disease as measured by weight loss (Fig. 8A ). In contrast, BALB.B10 mice (also H-2 b MHC, with BALB/c background genes) exhibited a moderate amount of weight loss early (days 3 and 4) after infection followed by rapid recovery. Among strains of mice expressing the MHC H-2 d haplotype, BALB/c mice lost approximately 10% of their starting weight by day 3 p.i., gradually recovering weight over the next 2 weeks (Fig. 8B) . B10.D2, DBA/2J, and NZB/BlNJ mice failed to lose substantial weight following MHV-1 infection, indicating that they are resistant to MHV-1-induced weight loss. Among H-2 k mice, CBA/J and B10.BR mice exhibited moderate weight loss between days 3 and 9 p.i. Moreover, like BALB/c and BALB.B10 mice, BALB.K mice exhibited a moderate loss of weight between days 3 and 5 p.i., rebounding quickly afterwards. As expected, infection of the mixed MHC haplotype A/J mice also resulted in rapid weight loss and high mortality. The above-mentioned results indicate that most strains expressing either the H-2 b or the H-2 d MHC haplotype are resistant to MHV-1-induced disease. Strains that carry the BALB/c background genes exhibit moderate susceptibility to MHV-1-induced weight loss independent of their MHC disposition. All mice expressing H-2 k MHC haplotypes exhibit moderate susceptibility to MHV-1induced weight loss Because C3H/HeJ mice lack a functional TLR4 gene, we wanted to further assess the role of TLR4 in susceptibility to MHV-1-induced disease. We first examined either wild-type or TLR4-deficient mice on the C57BL/10 (H-2 b MHC haplotype) background. Like C57BL/6 mice, C57BL/10SnJ mice were resistant to MHV-1-induced weight loss (Fig. 9A) . C57BL/10ScN mice, which are homozygous for a null mutation of the TLR4 gene (31, 45), did not exhibit weight loss that was significantly different from that of C57BL/10SnJ mice. Thus, TLR4 deficiency does not render a resistant strain susceptible to MHV-1-induced disease. We next examined the effect of TLR deficiency within the susceptible C3H H-2 k mice. C3H/HeJ mice lost approximately 20% of their body weight by day 8 p.i. (Fig.  9B ). In addition, C3H/HeJ mice also exhibited a high mortality rate, with the majority of the mice dying between days 7 and 10 p.i. C3H/HeN mice (wild-type TLR4) followed a weight loss trend similar to that of C3H/HeJ mice during the first 7 days of infection, but C3H/HeN mice then exhibited more robust recovery than C3H/HeJ mice. These results indicate that TLR4 deficiency increases susceptibility to MHV-1-induced disease within C3H mice.",

C3H/HeJ mice exhibited an approximately 70% mortality rate by day 14 p.i., whereas C3H/HeN mice exhibited only 20% mortality during this time frame (Fig. 10) . Increased mortality was not associated with an increase in virus replication in the lung, as virus titers were not significantly different between the C3H/HeJ and C3H/HeN mice at day 4 or 7 p.i.

MHV-1 was shown to replicate in the lung and produce pulmonary pathology in A/J mice that shared several key characteristics with the lung pathology noted in human SARS cases (3, 9, 29, 43) . In the current study, we examined the disease induced by i.n. administration in several strains of mice and showed that i.n. infection of A/J and C3H/ HeJ mice resulted in increased weight loss, clinical illness, and Penh compared to either BALB/c or C57BL/6 mice. Several observations indicate that the adaptive immune response may play an important role in the enhanced morbidity and mortality we observed in A/J and C3H/HeJ mice. First, BALB/c mice mirror the weight loss observed early after MHV-1 infection of A/J and C3H/HeJ mice. However, by day 5 p.i., when the adaptive immune response would start to become apparent, BALB/c mice start to regain weight whereas A/J and C3H/HeJ mice continue to lose weight. In addition, our preliminary data indicate that depletion of both CD4 and CD8 T cells published data). The factors that drive the weight loss in A/J and C3H/HeJ mice are currently unknown; however, the cytokine tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u2423) represents a likely candidate. Macrophages and T cells are the primary producers of TNF-\u2423, and when it is released in large quantities, TNF-\u2423 production has been associated with cachexia in mice. Antibody-mediated TNF-\u2423 depletion has been shown to ameliorate the weight loss observed following infection with either respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) or influenza virus (19) . Thus, TNF-\u2423 likely contributes to the development of weight loss following MHV-1 infection; however, this has yet to be formally tested. Although MHV strains can cause mortality associated with liver disease, we do not believe A/J and C3H/HeJ mice were succumbing to liver disease. Infection of either A/J or C3H/ HeJ mice with a higher dose (2 \u03eb 10 5 PFU) of MHV-1 administered intraperitoneally does not induce disease or mortality in either mouse strain. In addition, we also examined the liver via histology during the course of these studies, and we did not find liver pathology that would be consistent with the time frame during which our mice succumbed to the infection (data not shown).",

Consistent with findings reported by Imai et al. (20) , we observed that TLR4-deficient mice exhibited improved lung function compared to wild-type controls (Fig. 11 ). TLR4 polymorphisms in humans have been linked to an increase in disease severity following infection with RSV (26, 33, 42) .

The C3H/HeJ mice succumbed to the infection primarily between days 7 and 10 p.i., suggesting that the TLR4 deficiency impacted a critical event influencing the adaptive immune response that led to the death of these mice.

            "text": "Consistent with previous work, our results indicate that the genetic background of the host exerts a profound effect on susceptibility to MHV-1-induced disease. C57BL/6 and C57BL/10 mice are extremely resistant to MHV-1-induced disease. TLR4-deficient C57BL/10ScN did not exhibit any increase in MHV-1-induced morbidity. Our results indicate that the host genetic background influences the requirement for TLR4-mediated signals during MHV-1 infection and that the genetic influences that result in resistance to MHV-1-induced disease are dominant over the requirement for TLR4-mediated signals. With the identification of several new CoVs within the last few years, including SARS-CoV (1, 24, 47, 48) , human CoV HKU1 (46) , and human CoV NL63 (44) , it has become increasing apparent that CoVs can be the cause of significant virus-induced respiratory disease in humans. However, studies examining the immunobiology of CoV infections in the respiratory tract remain scarce. Mice infected i.n. with MHV-1 represent an excellent model of CoV-induced lung injury that may provide additional insights into the pathogenesis of CoV infection in humans. ",
