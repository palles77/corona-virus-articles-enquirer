Most of the cases and deaths have occurred in Wuhan city in China where the outbreak started. As drugs or vaccines are not yet available, various non-pharmaceutical measures have been recommended to reduce the spread of infection, including hygiene and disinfection, improving environmental control, early detection and reporting, isolation, quarantine, use of personal protective equipment, social distancing and travel restrictions (( World Health Organization (WHO) 2014 ; Bell et al., 2006 ) ). In most pandemic plans, tiered strategies which target front line health workers first, followed by the general community, are usually defined. Yet many of these strategies have some level of controversy attached and lack a large evidence base . Some are starting to be phased out in some settings such as the use of thermal scanners at airports, due to a lack of evidence, especially for infections with pre-symptomatic transmission ( Gunaratnam et al., 2014 ) . However, the use of other interventions continues to be debated.",

The World Health Organization (WHO), the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other leading health organisations have different recommendations for the selection of respiratory protec-tion. For example, the WHO recommends using masks to protect health workers from COVID-19 during routine care and respirators during aerosol generating procedures ( World Health Organisation (WHO) 2020 ). In contrast, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) 2020 ) and the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control ( European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) 2020 ) recommend using respirators during both routine care of COVID19 patients and high risk situations. Individual countries also have different policies; some are in line with the WHO, and others with the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. For example, the Australian ( Communicable Diseases Network Australia (CDNA) ) and Canadian guidelines ( Government of Canada ) align with the WHO, while UK ( Public Health England ) and Chinese guidelines ( Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention 2020 ) align with the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and European Center for Disease Prevention and Control. While all organisations recommend using N95/ P2/FFP2 or equivalent respirators, Public Health England (UK) recommends using filtering facepiece 3 (FFP3) respirators for all cases and the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control recommends using FFP3 during aerosol generating procedures. Australian guidelines also recommend powered air purifying respirators while performing aerosol generating procedures on multiple patients. Although US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines also discuss powered air purifying respirators indication of their use is not clear.",

The community trials show a benefit of face masks with or without hand hygiene, conditional on compliance ( Simmerman et al., 2011 ; Aiello et al., 2012 ; Aiello et al., 2010 b; Suess et al., 2012 ; MacIntyre et al., 2009 ; Cowling et al., 2009 ).

Masks were originally designed to prevent spread of infections from wearers to other people around them, referred to as \"source control\". They are also used to protect from infections transmitted through the droplet mode and splashes or sprays of blood or body fluids. Disposable medical or surgical masks are common types of face masks used by both health workers and general public. In contrast to this, respirators are designed for respiratory protection. A medical or surgical mask may be enough to prevent droplet transfer, while a respirator is required for airborne infection. In terms of mask use, the physical barrier may also prevent contact transmission such as hand to face/mouth/nose. A respirator may provide protection against multiple modes of transmission, including droplet, airborne and hand-to-mouth/nose transmission. Whilst the relative contribution of each mode is difficult to quantify, clinically, the debate about the modes of transmission is academic if an intervention is shown to prevent infection.",

There had been evidence of airborne transmission of SARS as well, therefore respirators were recommended for SARS during 2002-03 outbreak ( McKinney et al., 2006 ) . In Canada, initially masks were recommended, but this recommendation was later changed to respirators due to the deaths of health workers. A recent study demonstrated the presence of coronavirus in anal swabs from infected patients and possibility of transmission through faecal-oral route ( Zhang et al., 2020 ) . Transmission dynamics for COVID-19 are still unclear and pharmaceutical control measures are not yet available, therefore N95 or higher respirators should be offered to health workers who are working at the frontline ( MacIntyre et al., 2014 a; MacIntyre et al., 2014 b). Health workers and other first responders in high coronavirus transmission areas (e.g. Wuhan) should use respirators during routine care of coronavirus cases. Health workers and first responders in low risk countries should use a respirator when encountering a suspected or confirmed case of coronavirus. If respirators are not available, then masks should be used.",

Certified respirators should be used in healthcare settings and certification processes should be managed by a regulatory body, for example in the US the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health regulates the certification process under regulation 42 CFR 84 ( National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) 1995 ). Similarly, in Europe, the European Norm standard ( European Directive ) and in Australia, AS/ NZS 1716 standard regulates respirator use ( Standards Australia Limited/Standards New Zealand 2012 ). All guidelines, except the WHO and the Australian guidelines, briefly discuss the need for fit testing but do not provide detail on fit testing procedures. The WHO and the Australian guidelines do not mention fit testing and instead mention fit check (or seal-check) which is not equivalent to fit testing. All guidelines however highlight the importance of training for respiratory (and other personal protective equipment) use.",

If respirators are not available, masks should be used. Extended use and reuse are high risk practices and may lead to selfcontamination to the wearer and should be avoided. In case of shortage, extended use should be balanced against the risk of infections and the wearer should not remove masks between patients encounters. There should be a uniform policy around the use of personal protective equipment to avoid confusion which places occupational health and safety of health workers as a high priority.",
