Since esiRNAs are directed against long target sequences, the genetic variations in the target sequences will have little influence on their effectiveness. The ability of esiRNAs to inhibit hepatitis B virus (HBV) gene expression and replication was tested. EsiRNAs targeting the coding region of HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) and the nucleocapsid (HBcAg) inhibited specifically the expression of HBsAg and HBcAg when cotransfected with the respective expression plasmids. Both esiRNAs reduced the HBV transcripts and replication intermediates in transient transfected cells and cells with HBV genomes integrated stably. Compared with synthetic siRNA, esiRNA targeting HBsAg was less effective than the selected synthetic siRNA in terms of the inhibition of HBV gene expression and replication. However, while the ability of synthetic siRNAs for specific gene silencing was impaired strongly by the nucleotide substitutions within the target sequences. The efficiency of gene silencing by esiRNAs was not influenced by sequence variation. The transfection of esiRNA did not induce interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) like STAT1 and ISG15, indicating the absence of off-target effects. In general, esiRNAs strongly inhibited HBV gene expression and replication and may have an advantage against HBV strains which are variable genetically.",

Although effective vaccines are available to prevent the transmission of HBV, HBV infection remains a global health problem due to about 350 million of chronically HBV-infected people worldwide. These individuals have a relatively high risk of developing end-stage liver diseases, such as liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (Seeger and Mason, 2000) . To date, treatment regiments for chronic hepatitis B are costly and have limited effectiveness. Only about one-third of the patients treated with alpha-interferon show a sustained response. Nucleoside analogues do not eliminate the virus completely and may select resistant viral variants (Marcellin, 2002) . Thus, it is urgent to develop new antiviral drugs against HBV.",

In the natural RNAi pathway, siRNAs are derived from the processing of long dsRNAs by the nuclease dicer into discrete 21-mers. Using chemically synthesized or vector-expressed siRNAs, many clinically important viruses including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, HBV, and hepatitis C virus (HCV) could be inhibited in vitro (Haasnoot et al., 2003; Li et al., 2005; Randall and Rice, 2004; Stevenson, 2003; Wu and Nandamuri, 2004) .

This problem could be overcome by targeting alternative sites on viral genomes as shown for HCV (Wilson and Richardson, 2005) . Due to the genetic variability of HBV, a treatment with siRNAs faces the problem with naturally occurring or treatment-induced nucleotide substitutions in the HBV genomes. Thus, gene silencing strategies targeting multiple sites are warranted. Yang et al. (2002) showed that Escherichia coli RNase III can digest dsRNA efficiently into short pieces with the same end structures as siRNAs. These endoribonuclease-prepared siR-NAs (esiRNAs) are able to target multiple sites within an mRNA, and have been verified to silence target mRNA efficiently and specifically (Calegari et al., 2002; Kittler et al., 2004; D. Yang et al., 2004; H. Yang et al., 2004; Zhu and Jiang, 2005) . In the present study, the ability of esiRNA to inhibit the HBV gene expression and replication was investigated. The esiRNAs targeting the HBV S and C gene were prepared by in vitro transcription and RNase III digestion. The inhibition of the HBV gene expression and the replication by esiRNA were demonstrated in transient cotransfection experiments and in a cell line with a stably integrated HBV genome. The effect of esiRNA targeting HBV S gene was compared further with that of chemical synthetic siRNAs.",

EsiRNAs were generated finally by digestion of the purified dsRNA with RNase III at 37 \u2022 C for 1 h, and verified by gel electrophoresis on a 4% agarose gel.

Therefore, the ability of esiRNA and synthetic siRNAs to inhibit HBV gene expression and viral replication was compared. Three synthetic siRNAs siHBs1-3 targeting the coding region of HBsAg inhibited the HBsAg expression with different effectiveness (Fig. 4a) . However, the silencing of the HBsAg expression by synthetic siRNAs was impaired strongly by nucleotide variations (Fig. 4b) . A G to A substitution at the position 17 in the target sequence reduced the ability of siHBs1 to inhibit the expression of HBsAg. Similarly, the two nucleotide substitutions in the target sequence of siHBs2 abolished the silencing effect completely. In contrast, these mutations did not affect the silencing effect of SesiRNA (data not shown, see below).",

The esiRNA directed against the coding sequences of HBsAg and HBcAg was capable of inhibiting the HBV gene expression and viral replication both in transient cotransfection system and in HepG2.2.15 cells. The inhibition effect was specific and dose-dependent. Theoretically, the esiRNA targeted at HBsAg should be more effective than its counterpart targeted at HBcAg. Since the HBV S region is shared by the major viral transcripts, all these RNA species were suppressed by SesiRNA. However, CesiRNA was as effective as or even more effective than SesiRNA. CesiRNA inhibited the HBsAg expression likely acting indirectly through reduction of HBV replication or by other unknown mechanisms. Interestingly, both SesiRNA and CesiRNA effectively inhibited HBV replication in HepG2.2.15 cells while only HBeAg expression was reduced by CesiRNA. One explanation is that only a small amount of HBsAg transcripts is needed for the synthesis of HBsAg.",

The ability to use siRNAs targeted simultaneously at different regions of a viral genome may increase the efficiency of the treatment and, in addition, will prevent the appearance of resistant mutants. Eight genotypes A-H of HBV can be distinguished. Each genotype differs from the others by more than 8% at the nucleotide level. Phylogenetic analysis has shown that the eight genotypes can be subdivided further into genotypical subtypes (Schaefer, 2005) . It is difficult to identify a highly effective siRNA target at a conserved 19-21 nt sequence in all these genotypes and genotypical subtypes. EsiRNAs generated from long dsRNA are mixtures of siRNAs with diverse specificities, and would be able to target the whole mRNA sequence and retain the ability for gene silencing. The results in the current study showed that esiRNA generated from HBV subtype ayw is applicable for different HBsAg subtypes tested. In contrast, single nucleotide mutation in the target sequence abrogates the silencing effect of chemically synthetic siRNAs. Similarly, Weinberg et al. (2007) used a vector to produce a dicer substrate that could generate multiple siRNAs. This approach would have the advantage of limiting escape and targeting a range of sequences found in different viral genotypes or quasispecies.",

According to these criteria, there would be only a limited number of optional sequences for RNAi targeted on a given mRNA. Processing of long dsRNA generates a variety of small dsRNA molecules with different degrees for RNA interference. Thus, it is understandable that esiRNAs would be less effective in comparison with a defined, optimized synthetic siRNA within the range of used concentrations.
