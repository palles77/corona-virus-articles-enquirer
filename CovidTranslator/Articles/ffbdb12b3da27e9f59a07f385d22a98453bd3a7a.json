The identification of five other PCRribotypes in 3/8 (37.5%) and 2/6 (33.3%) of inoculated and control calves, respectively, indicated early natural infection ( 24 h of age). Five of 14 cecal samples had C. difficile ( p = 0.01).

This strain had been isolated from a diarrheic calf (Rodriguez-Palacios et al., 2006) and is a recognized cause of CDAD in humans. Initially, pure colonies of this strain were incubated anaerobically (37 8C for 48 h) in 50 mL of C. difficile selective broth supplemented with cysteine hydrochloride, moxalactam and norfloxacin (CDMN, Oxoid, England) (Aspinall and Hutchinson, 1992) . This broth was used to inoculate bottles with 400 mL of pre-reduced brain heart infusion (BHI, Oxoid, Canada) broth. After 24-36 h of incubation, and centrifugation at 4000 \u00c2 g for 10 min, the sediment was re-suspended in 50 mL of sterile BHI broth, which was administered to the calves within 2 h of preparation. Sterile BHI broth (50 mL) was used as placebo for control calves.",

These finding contrasts previous studies in hamsters, piglets and foals where diarrhea was induced in most animals within 48-72 h of oral infection (Arroyo et al., 2004; Jones et al., 1988; Post et al., 2000; Sambol et al., 2001) . It is uncertain if diarrhea would have developed later, if calves had been monitored further. As CDAD in humans occur a few days after discontinuation of antimicrobial therapy (Beaugerie et al., 2003) , some models of infection include the concurrent administration of antimicrobials to facilitate the induction of CDAD (Sambol et al., 2002) . Antimicrobials were not used in this study as the main objective was to investigate the sole effect of an early ingestion of C. difficile. It is unknown if diarrhea had occurred if these calves had received antimicrobials. However, the failure to induce disease in the absence of antimicrobial therapy indicates a difference in susceptibility compared to neonatal foals (Arroyo et al., 2004) , and questions the role of C. difficile as a primary pathogen in calves. It is important to consider, however, that failure to induce disease experimentally does not rule out the possibility that C. difficile is a bovine pathogen. Rather it indicates that simple exposure to C. difficile is not adequate to cause disease.",
