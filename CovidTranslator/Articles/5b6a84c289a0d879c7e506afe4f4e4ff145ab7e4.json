Ninety-one newborn calves from three dairy farms were assigned into two groups; \"Eco\" group (n = 46) calves were drenched with Greek oregano (Origanum vulgare ssp. Hirtum) essential oil (ECODIAR\u00ae liquid 5%) at the dose of 12.5 mg/kg body weight once per day until the age of 10 days. \"Conts\" group (n = 45) calves were left untreated and served as controls. All animals were monitored daily for the incidence of diarrhea until the age of 15 days and their fecal score was recorded. Fecal samples were collected on days 3, 6 and 10 for microbiological and parasitological evaluation. Average fecal score throughout the experiment, incidence of diarrhea, duration and severity of diarrhea episodes were significantly lower in Eco group compared to the controls. Daily administration of oregano essential oil in calves for the first 10 days of their life effectively diminishes the severity of naturally acquired diarrhea under field conditions and, under certain hygiene practices, possess a preventive effect against neonatal diarrhea syndrome.",

The most important infectious agents associated with the disease are enterotoxic Escherichia coli K99/F5 (ETEC), Rotavirus A (RVA), Bovine coronavirus (BCoV), and Cryptosporidium spp. with RVA and Cryptosporidium spp. being most frequently identified in fecal samples from young calves (Gulliksen et al., 2009; Bartels et al., 2010; Silverl\u00e5s et al., 2010) .

It has been proven in many experiments in vitro that oregano essential oil and its main constituents, carvacrol and thymol, have strong antibacterial activity against gram negative bacteria and especially E. coli (Elgayyar et al., 2001; Si et al., 2008; Nazzaro et al., 2013) . Apart from its antibacterial properties, oregano essential oil was also found to have antiviral (Pilau et al., 2011) and anticryptosporidial (Gaur et al., 2016) effects in vitro. Based on these properties it could be hypothesized that the administration of oregano essential oil in newborn calves might have beneficial effects not only in treating but also in preventing diarrhea syndrome. In the available literature there is not any relevant controlled research evaluating potential prophylactic or treatment effects of oregano essential oil on diarrhea in calves aged < 15 days. In the only available study it was observed that the administration of oregano leaves had comparable effects with neomycin on the duration of diarrhea in diarrheic calves aged 7 to 20 days without however using control group (Bampidis et al., 2006) .",

The calves were randomly alternately assigned into one of two groups according to their birth date in each farm until the total number of 30 calves per farm was reached. In Farm 1 however 31 calves were finally used due to a twin birth at the last calving. The experiment was run in all 3 farms simultaneously from September 10th 2016 to November 12th 2016.

In order to evaluate its possible preventive effect against diarrhea, oregano essential oil was administered to the calves of Eco group for the first 10 days of their life, given that the great majority of the diarrhea cases commence during this period, as occurred at the present study. It was selected to continue the administration of the oregano essential oil in calves of Eco group that remained diarrheic beyond the age of 10 days in order to be able to estimate its possible treatment effects as well. In the available literature there is not standardized dosage for oregano oil in calves. In a former experiment Table 3 Incidence of diarrhea, percentages of calves with adequate passive immunity transfer and percentages of positive calves to Cryptosporidium spp., Rotavirus A (RVA), Bovine coronavirus (BCoV) and enterotoxic Escherichia coli K99/F5 (ETEC) in the three farms of the experiment (Farm 1, 2 and 3) and in calves drenched with oregano essential oil (Eco) or left untreated as controls (Conts). the dosage of 10 mg/kg was used (Bampidis et al., 2006) . According to our experience in practice, diarrheic calves that weight about 40 kg are empirically orally drenched by the farmers with 10 ml of ECODIAR liquid 5%, which corresponds to the dosage rate of 12.5 mg/kg that was used at the present experiment. Oregano oil, even at the concentration of 5%, has very strong flavor; in order to avoid any milk consumption refusals it was selected not to mix it with milk but to administer it immediately after feeding as an oral drench, by diluting the drenched quantity with normal saline until 60 ml. The followed practice ensured complete milk consumption and was not associated with discomfort of the calves during administration. The percentage of calves with adequate passive immunity transfer using 52 g/l as the cut-off value for serum total protein concentration exceeded the critical level of 90% (McGuirk, 2010) in all farms. These results indicate that the farms selected for the study had successful colostrum management practices (McGuirk, 2010) and that the distribution of calves with failure and adequate passive transfer is equal between groups. Additionally, as expected, the non-significantly different serum total proteins concentrations among groups imply that the administration of oregano oil does not impair the acquirement of passive immunity.",

The hardly identical percentage of positive animals and the insignificant differences on the virus shedding among groups indicate that oregano essential oil administration does not prevent the infection of calves with RVA. This is in accordance to in vitro observations that carvacrol, the main component of oregano oil, does not possess antiviral activity against rotavirus when added before but only when added after the inoculation of cell cultures with the virus (Pilau et al., 2011) .",

However, even though non statistically significant, the percentage of positive animals in Eco group was lower compared to the controls. This finding was constant in all 3 farms and implies that oregano oil might possibly be associated with reduced infection rates. Supporting towards to this point of view is the significant reduction of oocyst shedding from day 3 to day 10 of the experiment in Eco group whereas it remained constant in the control group. Such an effect warrants further evaluation and cannot be excluded, given that oregano oil is effective against other protozoa in vivo in other animal species (Giannenas et al., 2003; Toulah et al., 2012; Mohiti-Asli and Ghanaatparast-Rashti, 2015) . Furthermore, it was recently proved in an in vitro study that at certain concentrations oregano oil as well as carvacrol alone effectively reduced (50%) the infectivity of Cryptosporidium parvum on cell cultures (Gaur et al., 2016) .",

This effect could be attributed to the inhibition of coliform bacterial overgrowth in the small intestine of diarrheic calves by oregano essential oil due to its strong antibacterial activity against E. coli (Elgayyar et al., 2001; Si et al., 2008; Nazzaro et al., 2013) . In support to this point of view, Bampidis et al. (2006) observed that oregano essential oil drenching had comparable results with neomycin administration per os on the treatment outcome of diarrhea due to E. coli in calves. Furthermore, the significantly lower number of calves with systemic illness that needed antimicrobial and supportive therapy in Eco group compared to the controls, which is suggestive of lower cases of bacteremia (Constable, 2004) , could also possibly imply that oregano essential oil might inhibit intestinal coliform overgrowth. However, this hypothesis has to be further investigated. The detection of similar number of E. coli in the fecal samples of calves in Eco and control group is not contrary to the proposed mode of action of oregano essential oil, given that E. coli numbers in the large intestine do not reflect the numbers in the small intestine (Constable, 2004) .",
