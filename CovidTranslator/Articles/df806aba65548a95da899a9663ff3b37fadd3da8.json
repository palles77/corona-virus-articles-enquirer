In a study by Kapoor et al., HCoSV strains were classified into 4 species (A, B, D, E). HCoSV was also found in a child with acute diarrhea in Australia (2) and, subsequently, was detected in China, Thailand, and Brazil. In China, 3.2% of hospitalized and 1.6% of healthy children were HCoSV positive, and all virus strains belonged to species A (3); in Thailand, HCoSV was detected in an adult patient but not in children with acute diarrhea (4); and in Brazil, the percentage of HCoV-positive symptomatic children (3.6%) was comparable to that reported in China; however, in 2 groups of asymptomatic children from whom samples were collected at different periods, HCoSV was detected in highly divergent percentages (6.5% vs. 49.2%) (5) . In Brazil, HCoSV was also detected in an HIV-positive adult patient with acute gastroenteritis, and \u224875% of symptomatic HCoSV-positive patients were co-infected with other gastroenteric viruses. Kapusinszky et al. recently conducted phylogenetic analysis of viral protein (VP) 3-VP1 genes, which revealed greater genetic variability of HCoSV strains, and proposed splitting species A into 24 species (A1-A24), D into 5 species (D1-D5), E into 2 species (E1-E2), and classifying F as 1 species (6).",

She had cough and fever (38\u00b0C), abdominal cramps, and diarrhea (6-10 bowel movements/day, liquid but not bloody). Routine fecal examination and cultures were negative for common gastrointestinal bacteria (Mycobacteria, Salmonella, Shigella, and Campylobacter spp.), parasites (protozoa and helminths), and viruses (astrovirus, norovirus, rotavirus, adenovirus). Because of the patient's persistent gastrointestinal symptoms and a positive fecal calprotectin result, a colonoscopy was performed; it revealed inflamed cecal mucosa without ulcerative lesions. Histologic examination of colonic biopsy samples showed mild, chronic, interstitial inflammation, including eosinophils and lymphoid microaggregates. Therefore, fecal samples were examined for less common gastroenteric viral agents-rhinovirus, bocavirus, enterovirus, parechovirus, coronavirus, sapovirus, aichivirus and HCoSV-by using conventional and real-time PCR or nested reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) (1, (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) . Samples were negative for all gastrointestinal viruses searched for except for HCoSV. This virus was detected by a nested RT-PCR targeting the 5\u2032 untranslated region (UTR) (1) and quantified on the basis of serial log 10 dilution of extracted nucleic acid estimating the presence of 10 7 RNA copies/ mL in fecal samples. The 316-bp 5\u2032 UTR amplicon was sequenced by using an ABI Prism 3100 DNA automatic sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA), assembled by Sequencer software, version 5.0 (Gene Codes Corporation, Ann Arbor, MI, USA), and compared with available HCoSV sequences with the BLAST program (http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). Nucleotide identity with the HCoSV species D (species D1) (GenBank accession no. FJ438908) was 93%.",

Although homology was greatest (97% nt and 81% aa identity) with a strain from Australia (GenBank accession no.
