Understanding the early transmission dynamics of the infection and evaluating the effectiveness of control measures is crucial for assessing the potential for sustained transmission to occur in new areas. Combining a mathematical model of severe SARS-CoV-2 transmission with four datasets from within and outside Wuhan, we estimated how transmission in Wuhan varied between December, 2019, and February, 2020. We used these estimates to assess the potential for sustained human-to-human transmission to occur in locations outside Wuhan if cases were introduced.",

Most internationally exported cases reported to date have history of travel to Wuhan. 2 In the early stages of a new infectious disease outbreak, it is crucial to understand the transmission dynamics of the infection. Estimation of changes in transmission over time can provide insights into the epidemiological situation 3 and identify whether outbreak control measures are having a measurable effect. 4, 5 Such analysis can inform predictions about potential future growth, 6 help estimate risk to other countries, 7 and guide the design of alternative interventions. 8 However, there are several challenges to such analyses, particularly in real time. There can be a delay to symptom appearance resulting from the incubation period and delay to confirmation of cases resulting from detection and testing capacity. 9 Modelling approaches can account for such delays and uncertainty by explicitly incorporating delays resulting from the natural history of infection and reporting processes. 10 Additionally, individual data sources might be biased, incomplete, or only capture certain aspects of the outbreak dynamics. Evidence synthesis approaches, which fit to multiple data sources rather than a single dataset (or datapoint) can enable more robust estimation of the underlying dynamics of transmission from noisy data. 11, 12 Combining a mathematical model of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) transmission with four datasets from within and outside Wuhan, we estimated how transmission in Wuhan varied between December, 2019, and February, 2020.

The model also incorporated uncertainty in case observation, by explicitly modelling a Poisson observed process of newly symptomatic cases, reported onsets of new cases, reported confirmation of cases, and a binomial observation process for infection prevalence on evacuation flights (appendix pp 1-3). The incubation period was assumed to be Erlang distributed with mean 5\u00b72 days 14 (SD 3\u00b77) and delay from onset to isolation was assumed to be Erlang distributed with mean 2\u00b79 days (2\u00b71). 2, 15 The delay from onset to reporting was assumed to be exponentially distributed with mean 6\u00b71 days (2\u00b75). 2 Once exposed to infection, a proportion of individuals travelled internationally and we assumed that the probability of cases being exported from Wuhan to a specific other country depended on the number of cases in Wuhan, the number of outbound travellers (assumed to be 3300 per day before travel restrictions were introduced on Jan 23, 2020, and zero after), the relative connectivity of different countries, 16 and the relative probability of reporting a case outside Wuhan, to account for differences in clinical case definition, detection, and reporting within",

The model had three unknown parameters, which we estimated: magnitude of temporal variability in trans mission, proportion of cases that would eventually be detectable, and relative probability of reporting a con firmed case within Wuhan compared with an inter nationally exported case that originated in Wuhan. We assumed the outbreak started with a single infectious case on Nov 22, 2019, and the entire population was initially susceptible. Once we had estimated R t , we used a branching process with a negative binomial offspring distribution to calculate the probability an introduced case would cause a large outbreak. We also did a sensitivity analysis on the following three key assumptions: we assumed the initial number of cases was ten rather than one; we assumed connectivity between countries followed WorldPop rather than MOBS Lab estimates; and we assumed that cases were infectious during the second half of their incubation period rather than only being infectious while symptomatic.

The model captured the exponential growth in case onsets in early January, the rising number of exported case onsets between Jan 15, and Jan 23, 2020, and the prevalence of infection measured on ten evacuation flights from Wuhan to seven countries. We estimated that 94\u00b78% (95% CI 93\u00b71-96\u00b71%) of the Wuhan population were still susceptible on Jan 31, 2020 (figure 2). Our results suggested there were around ten times more symptomatic cases in Wuhan in late January than were reported as confirmed cases (figure 2), but the model did not predict the slowdown in cases that was observed in early February. The model could also reproduce the pattern of confirmed exported cases from Wuhan, which was not explicitly used in the model fitting (figure 2). We found that confirmed and estimated exported cases among the 20 countries most connected to China generally corresponded with each other, with the USA and Australia as notable outliers, having had more confirmed cases reported with a travel history to Wuhan than would be expected in the model (figure 2). There was evidence that the majority of cases were symptomatic. We estimated that 100% (95% CI 51-100) of cases would eventually have detectable symptoms, implying that most infections that were exported internationally from Wuhan in late January were in theory eventually detectable. As a sensitivity analysis, we repeated the analysis with a large number of initial cases, different mobility data, and the assumption that presymptomatic cases could transmit. In these analyses, we observed the same result of a decline in R t from more than 2 to almost 1 in the last 2 weeks of January, 2020 (appendix pp [10] [11] [12] [13] .",

The model also did not predict the more recent slowdown in cases, suggesting that transmission might have declined more than our model-which did not fit to this case data-estimated during early February, 2020. Our estimates for international cases in specific countries were broadly consistent with the number of subsequently confirmed exported cases outside Wuhan. However, there were notably more cases exported to France, USA, and Australia compared with what our model predicted. This could be the result of increased surveillance and detection as awareness of SARS-CoV-2 increased in late January, which would suggest earlier exported cases might have been missed, or could be the result of increased travel out of Wuhan immediately before introduction of travel restrictions on Jan 23, 2020.",

            "text": "Based our on estimated reproduction number and published estimates of individual-level variation in transmission for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, we found that a single case introduced to a new location would not necessarily lead to an outbreak. Even if the reproduction number is as high as in Wuhan in early January, it could take several introductions for an outbreak to establish, because high individual-level variation in transmission makes new chains of transmission more fragile, and hence it becomes less likely that a single infection will generate an outbreak. This factor highlights the importance of rapid case identification and subsequent isolation and other control measures to reduce the chance of onward chains of transmission. 20 Our analysis highlights the value of combining multiple data sources in analysis of COVID-19. For example, the rapid growth of confirmed cases globally during late January, 2020, with case totals in some instances apparently doubling every day or so, would have had the effect of inflating R t estimates to implausibly large values if only these recent datapoints were used in our analysis. Our results also have implications for estimation of transmission dynamics using the number of exported cases from a specific area. 21 Once extensive travel restrictions are introduced, as they were in Wuhan, the signal from such data gets substantially weaker. If restrictions and subsequent delays in detection of cases are not accounted for, this could lead to artificially low estimates of R t or inferred case totals from the apparently declining numbers of exported cases. Our model estimates benefited from the availability of testing data from evacuation flights, which allowed us to estimate current prevalence. Having such information for other settings, either through widespread testing or serological surveillance, will be valuable to reduce reliance on case reports alone. There are several other limitations to our analysis. We used plausible biological parameters for SARS-CoV-2 based on current evidence, but these values might be refined as more comprehensive data become available. However, by fitting to multiple datasets to infer model parameters, and conducting sensitivity analyses on key areas of uncertainty, we have attempted to make the best possible use of the available evidence about SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics. Furthermore, we used publicly available connectivity and risk estimates based on international travel data to predict the number of cases exported into each country. These estimates have shown good correspondence with the distribution of exported cases to date, 22 and are similar to another risk assessment for COVID-19 with different data. 23 We also assumed that the latent period is equal to the incubation period (ie, individuals become infectious and symptomatic at the same time) and all infected individuals will eventually become symptomatic. However, there is evidence that transmission of SARS-CoV-2 can occur with few reported symptoms. 24 Therefore, we did a sensitivity analysis in which transmission could occur in the second half of the incubation period, but this did not change our overall conclusions of a decline in R t from around 2\u00b74 to almost 1 during the last 2 weeks of January. We also explored having a larger initial spillover event and using different sources for flight connectivity data, both of which produced the same conclusion about the decline in transmission. In our analysis of new outbreaks, we also used estimates of individual-level variation in transmission for SARS and MERS-CoV to illustrate potential dynamics. However, it remains unclear what the precise extent of such variation is for SARS-CoV-2. 17 If transmission were more homogenous than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV, it would increase the risk of outbreaks following introduced cases. As more data become available, it will be possible to refine these estimates; therefore we have made an online tool so that users can explore these risk estimates if new data become available (appendix p 4).",
