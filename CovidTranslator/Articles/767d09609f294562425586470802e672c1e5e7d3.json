Viruses like respiratory syncytial virus, human rhinovirus, human metapneumovirus, parainfluenza viruses, and influenza may act as sole pathogens or may predispose to bacterial pneumonia by a variety of mechanisms. New, emerging, or reemerging viral pathogens occasionally cause outbreaks of severe respiratory tract infection in children. The 2009-2010 H1N1 influenza virus pandemic resulted in increased rates of influenza-related hospitalizations and deaths in children. Rapid viral diagnostic tests based on antigen detection or nucleic acid amplification are increasingly available for clinical use and confirm the importance of viral infection in children hospitalized with CAP. Recently published guidelines for the management of CAP in children note that positive viral test results can modify clinical decision making in children with suspected pneumonia by allowing antibacterial therapy to be withheld in the absence of clinical, laboratory, or radiographic findings that suggest bacterial coinfection.",

In the U.S., there are about 2.5 to 3.3 million episodes per year [3] , with more than 200,000 hospitalizations [4] . Among immunocompetent children, CAP may be caused by a wide variety of microbes, including many viruses, \"typical\" bacteria (e.g., Streptococcus pneumoniae), atypical bacteria (e.g., Mycoplasma pneumoniae), Mycobacterium tuberculosis and related species, and fungi such as Histoplasma capsulatum [5-10, 11\u2022\u2022] . Viral infections are involved with 80 % of episodes of CAP in children under 2 years old and 49 % of older children [12] .",

Viral etiologies vary by geography, season, and the age of patients studied, but respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human rhinovirus (HRV), human bocavirus (HBoV), human metapneumovirus (HMPV), and parainfluenza viruses (PIV) are described consistently as the most common viruses associated with CAP in children. Coinfection with influenza and a bacterial pathogen has been associated with the development of severe disease [18] [19] [20] [21] . Severe cases of RSV bronchiolitis requiring mechanical ventilation often have bacterial coinfection [22, 23] . Development of CAP caused by bacterial pathogens that have colonized the upper airway may be facilitated by viral respiratory tract infections that (1) damage ciliated respiratory epithelium and interfere with normally protective mucociliary clearance mechanisms [24] , (2) augment adhesion of bacterial pathogens to respiratory epithelial cells [25] [26] [27] , (3) directly diminish the effectiveness of neutrophils or other components of innate or adaptive immunity [28] , (4) allow overgrowth of bacteria in the nasal passages that increases the likelihood of aspiration into the lower respiratory tract, and/or (5) facilitate translocation of bacteria in the upper airways across mucosal barriers into the bloodstream, with secondary bacteremic seeding of the lung parenchyma [29] .",

Low-level human-to-human transmission may have occurred, although widespread circulation has not been noted as yet. This strain appears closely related to an influenza A variant that circulated in the mid-1990s. A recent seroprevalence study in 2012 in Canada showed that many adolescents and young adults, but not children under 14 years or adults over 44 years old, have antibodies that are cross-reactive with this strain [53] . This emergence suggests that new influenza strains can emerge globally and substantiates the need for ongoing influenza surveillance.",

A current example is DAS181, which acts at the level of the host, rather than the microbe, by blockade of influenza virus binding to sialic acid residues on respiratory epithelial cells [73] .",
