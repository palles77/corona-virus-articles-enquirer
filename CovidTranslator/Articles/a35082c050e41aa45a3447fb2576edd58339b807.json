Industrial chemicals have been present in the environment for only an instant in evolutionary time, a period that in some cases has not been long enough for the appropriate functional groups to evolve in catalytic sites of enzymes. In other cases accumulation of chemicals in the biosphere is the result of the mobilization of large amounts of compounds as a consequence of industrial activities. The introduction of xenobiotics or the massive mobilization of compounds present in natural resources cause a problem regarding the integration of these compounds into the natural nutrient cycles. As a consequence of the progressive accumulation of pollutants in the biosphere, environments hostile to biological systems, ie those polluted by aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons, chlorinated compounds, nitrotoluenes, dyes, explosives, organic solvents, etc are increasing'.",

With regard to chemical pollutants, it is evident that the manufacture of toxic and recalcitrant compounds should diminish and eventually cease. Such chemicals must be replaced with nontoxic alternatives that can be mineralized. However, these changes will inevitably take a number of years, as the possible negative effects of many compounds have not yet been investigated. This makes active measures necessary to eliminate or detoxify pollutants. One of the most promising approaches is to optimize the biodegradative capacities of microorganisms, accelerate the evolution of new activities, and exploit them to eliminate these pollutants 2 \u2022 The introduction of some chemicals into the environment selects for the evolution of the corresponding catabolic activities, ie, the herbicide 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) and insecticides such as DDT and parathion, can be mineralized biphenyls and explosives such as 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene 1 -14 \u2022 Furthermore, some of these recombinant bacteria and their parental wild-type strains have been selectively introduced in polluted and nonpolluted environments, and their survival, performance and ability to transfer recombinant DNA (rDNA) have been monitored. Active conditional biological containment systems based on several killing functions and coupled to the regulatory elements of catabolic pathways have been developed and tested in model recombinant bacteria in which survival or death was preprogrammed. In addition, to decrease the transfer and spread of new traits from the released GEMs to the indigenous microbiota, the GEMs can be supplied with a universal barrier to gene dispersal, based on killing function conferred by the colicin E3 RNase.

B13 exhibits two ortho-cleavage pathways, one each for the metabolism of benzoate and the other for catabolism of 3-chlorobenzoate 19 \u2022 These pathways do not allow the mineralization of other chlorobenzoates or alkylbenzoates' 3 \u2022 The chromosomal ortho-cleavage pathway for benzoate seems to be similar to other catabolic pathways for the metabolism of benzoate by pseudomonadaceae. The 3-chlorobenzoate pathway is partially chromosome encoded and partially plasmid encoded. In this pathway, 3-chloroben-\u2022 zoate is first oxydized to 3-chlorocatechol by chromosome encoded genes (Fig. 3) ; then 3-chlorocatechol undergoes ring cleavage and chlorine elimination, a process in which three plasmid-encoded enzymes-catechol I,2-dioxygenase, chloromuconate cycloisomerase and dienelactone hydrolase -are involved. Growth of the bacteria on 3-chlorobenzoate resulted in amplification of the plasmid encoded genes involved in the process, in order to increase protein dosage 20 \u2022 Pseudomonas sp. B 13 cannot grow on 4-chlorobenzoate or mixtures of alkyl-and halobenzoates. In contrast, Pseudomonas sp. FRI (pFRC20P), a derivative of B13 that was constructed through the recruitment of genes from different microorganisms, is able to grow on 4-chlorobenzoate ( Fig. 3 ) and mixtures of alkyl-and chloroaromatics 1 \u2022. Its construction involved chromosomal integration of the genes for the metabolism of 4-chlorobenzoate and alkylbenzoates to 4-chlorocatechol and alkylcatechols respectively. The construct was completed by the introduction of a mobilizable plasmid (pFRC20P) carrying a key gene for the conversion of alkyl-lactones resulting from the metabolism of alkylcatechols. The genes encoding the IDL plasmid toluate dioxygenase (xylXYZ) and the next enzyme in the pathway (a dehydrogenase encoded by xy/L) plus the positive regulator xylS, were cloned into Tn5 and delivered into the host chromosome. This allowed the recombinant bacteria to grow on 4-chlorobenzoate, and allowed the metabolism of 4-methylbenzoate to -y-methyl-lactone. The resulting bacterium was called Pseudomonas sp. FRI. Cloning of an isomerase from Alcaligenes that allowed the conversion of the -y-methyl-lactone into /3-methyl-lactone 21 in plasmid pFRC20P allowed mineralization of the alkylbenzoate. Further, this isolate grew, and simultaneously assimilated, mixtures of alkyl-and halobenzoates. Both Pseudomonas sp.",

Although these markers are extremely useful in molecular genetics and microbial ecology, their use in uncontained applications is perceived as less desirable 27 . To avoid their use in GEMs designed for environmental applications, a series of nonantibiotic resistance markers were developed. These include spontaneous resistance to the herbicide phosphinothricin 28 , cloned resistances to bialaphos, resistance to heavy metal ions such as mercury, arsenate or tellurite 29 \u00b7 30 and nutritional markers such as the genes that enable the organism to grow on lactose as the sole C-source31. Some of these markers were introduced into host microorganisms via mini-Tn5 derivatives 6 \u00b7 29 \u00b7 30 . Another approach, which may ultimately solve the problem of the persistance of selectable markers, is the use of a selectable marker, ie kanamycin resistance, flanked by two tandem res (resolution) sites of plasmid RP4, which can be provided as a cassette within a mini-transposon 32 \u2022 The res site is a short sequences which, once recognized by the resolvase of the ParA system, undergoes a site-specific recombination event that results in the deletion of the intervening DNA sequences 33 . ParA can be provided in a suicide replicon. An alternative marker is the use of genes encoding light activities, such as lux and luc:34. This system has now been used to mark and track Pseudomonas strains able to attach to maize plant roots (C. Ramos, unpublished) . An alternative to the introduction of a selectable marker in the target strain is to make use of means that specifically recognize the target microbe. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are powerful tools for tracking microorganisms because they can recognize epitopes on the surface of bacteria, and thus serve as in situ identifiers. A series of mAbs were raised against whole cells of Pseudomonas putida KT24403 5 . One was shown to recognize the 0-antigen of Pseudomonas putida LPS. In the laboratory, this mAb specifically recognized the strain when grown in different culture media and at different growth stages. The mAb, which is highly specific, was used to track the strain after its release in a mesocosm established in the Plussee Lake in northern Germany 35 .",

The strategy was to combine the killing function with the regulatory system of a degradative pathway in such a way, that the cells survive in the presence of the xenobiotic (repression of the killing gene), but after 1354 BIO/TECHNOLOGY VOL. 12 DECEMBER 1994 completion of degradation of the compound the killing gene is turned on, and the cells die53. This approach has been tested in relation to the 10L pathway responsible for the mineralization of different benzoates. With the detailed knowledge about the genetic control of the genes involved in this degradative path-way54, it was possible to design engineered combinations of the expression system of the 10L genes and a suicide gene. One of the promoters of the 10L genes was fused with the E. coli loci gene whose product represses a promoter, P1.c which in the present context was fused with the killing gene (Fig. 4) . In the presence of m-methylbenzoate the 10L promoter is activated, which implies that the repressor protein is made, and consequently the killing function is not expressed; the cells survive, and degradation of m-methylbenzoate is allowed. After removal of the aromatic inducer the repressor is no longer expressed from the 10L promoter, and therefore no inhibition is exerted on the promoter responsible for expression of the killing function\". After completion of the task of the designed organism (degradation of m-methylbenzoate), it destroys itself through substrate regulated induction of the suicide system.",

The system involves two genes, the co/E3 gene, encoding the RNAse colicin E3, and the immunity immE3 gene, which codes for a specific inhibitor of the lethal function, the immunity E3 protein 57 \u2022 The target of colicin E3 is located at the 3' end of the 168 rRNA which is conserved virtually in all prokaryotic and some eukaryotic genera 58 \u2022 Cleavage of this sequence separates the mRNA binding sites from the remainder of the 16S rRNA, thereby inhibiting protein synthesis and leading to cell death. In the GEM, the gene specifying the lethal function is closely linked to the determinant of the novel phenotype, whereas the immunity gene is located far from the recombinant genes, so that co-transfer of immunity gene with the kill gene is highly unlikely. Transfer of the determinant of the novel phenotype to a new organism will be accompanied by transfer of the lethal function, but not of the immunity function, and as a consequence the recipient organism will be killed (Fig. 5) . The genes co/E3 and immE3 have been cloned and constitutively expressed separately 56 \u2022 The immE3 gene was integrated into the \u2022 chromosome of different E. coli and Pseudomonas putida strains.

Effectiveness of the containment system \u00b7was tested with different DNA transfer mechanisms (transformation and conjugation), and different recipient microorganisms of environmental importance. There were representative of the main subgroups of Proteobacteria: P. putida and P. fluorescens ('y subgroup), Alcaligenes eutrophus and Comomonas acidovorans ({3 subgroup), Rhiwbium meliloti and Agrobacterium tumefaciens (a subgroup). In all cases the colicin E3 lethal function decreased the frequency of plasmid transfer by four to five orders of magnitude.
