The epidemic lasted for 2 months and the government quarantined 16,993 individuals for 14 days to control the epidemic. The 2015 MERS-CoV epidemic in ROK was almost entirely nosocomial, through intra-hospital and hospital-to-hospital -specific morbidity and mortality rates from the 2015 MERS-CoV epidemic in ROK are different in certain respects from those of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in China and the ROK. The general shape of the epidemic curve from the 2015 Korea MERS-CoV outbreak was a standard unimodal Gaussian curve with peak morbidity in the 50-59 year age cohort, similar to that of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic for China shown in Figure 1. The sex ratio among confirmed cases from the 2015 Korea MERS-CoV epidemic in the ROK was male biased, with a 60:40 ratio of males to females, the reverse of that observed in the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, which has a 40:60 male female ratio among confirmed cases reported as of 11 Mar 2020 [6]. Although nosocomial transmission has been an important factor in the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in both China and the ROK, community transmission has been the predominant driving factor for the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in ROK. Improvements in hospital infection control policies and practices, coupled with the development and implementation of more sophisticated infectious disease surveillance and response training programs, are believed to be important factors in the apparent relatively low rate of nosocomial transmission in the ROK during the current pandemic.The available data indicate that the epidemiological characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 infections appear to distinctly different from those of typical human coronaviruses and the recently-emerged zoonotic coronaviruses (SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV), zoonotic influenza viruses (e.g., H5N1, H7N9, H792), seasonal",

Lack of adherence to social-distancing and self-quarantine recommendations appears to be a key factor in the high ratio of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals associated with the Shincheonji religious community also. Observational data collected throughout the course of the COVID-19 pandemic in the ROK indicates much lower rates of compliance with ROK government social distancing recommendations by individuals in the young adults and teenagers in the 15-29 year age cohorts, which could help explain the relatively higher rates of infection among the 10-19 and 20-29",
