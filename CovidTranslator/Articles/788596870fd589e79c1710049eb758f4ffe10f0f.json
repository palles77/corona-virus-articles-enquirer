To characterize the specific role of swine influenza virus in PRDC presentation in Colombia, 11 farms from three major production regions in Colombia were examined in this study. Nasal swabs, bronchial lavage and lung tissue samples were obtained from animals displaying symptoms compatible with SIV. Isolation of SIV was performed in 9-day embryonated chicken eggs or Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cells. Positive isolates, identifi ed via the hemagglutination inhibition test, were further analyzed using PCR. Overall, 7 of the 11 farms were positive for SIV. Notably, sequencing of the gene encoding the hemagglutinin (HA) protein led to grouping of strains into circulating viruses identifi ed during the human outbreak of 2009, classifi ed as pandemic H1N1-2009. Serum samples from 198 gilts and multiparous sows between 2008 and 2009 were obtained to determine antibody presence of APP, Myh, PCV2 and PRRSV in both SIV-H1N1p-negative and -positive farms, but higher levels were recorded for SIV-H1N1p-positive farms. Odds ratio (OR) and P values revealed statistically signifi cant differences (p<0.05) in PRDC presentation in gilts and multiparous sows of farms positive for SIV-H1N1p. Our fi ndings indicate that positive farms have increased risk of PRDC presentation, in particular, PCV2, APP and Myh.",

Influenza A viruses have been isolated from different species, including humans, pigs, dogs, horses, sea mammals and birds (Kuntz-Simon G, et al., 2009; Webster R G, et al., 1987) . The viruses are classified into subtypes based on antigenic properties of the external glycoproteins, hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA). Influenza A viruses have been further classified into 16 HA and 9 NA subtypes (Webster R G, et al., 1987; Fouchier R, et al., 2005) . The proteins are highly variable and critical for the induction of antibody response in the host (Gramer M, 2008) . Although other subtypes have been identifi ed, infl uenza A virus H1N1, H1N2 and H3N2 subtypes are the most prevalent in pig populations worldwide (Kuntz-Simon G, et al., 2009) .",

            "text": "In pigs, the disease is characterized by sudden onset, coughing, dyspnea, fever and prostration, followed by rapid recovery. Lesions generally develop rapidly in the respiratory tract and regress quickly. The course and severity of disease are likely to vary with the strain of the virus, age and immune status of the host (Easterday B C, et al., 1999) . Morbidity is high (near 100%), but mortality is low (usually less than 1%). Recovery begins 7 to 10 days post-infection. Subclinical infections are common, and most pigs can be reinfected with other strains without showing clinical signs (Reeth V K, et al., 2006) . Porcine respiratory disease complex (PRDC), a multifactorial condition, is a serious health problem in growing and finishing pigs, and poses a threat to the swine industry worldwide. PRDC results from a combination of viral and bacterial agents, including porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), swine influenza virus (SIV), Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae (Myh), Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae (APP), Pasteurella multocida and porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) (Kim J, et al., 2003) . Although the etiology of PRDC involves multiple pathogens and varies among farms, several researchers maintain that etiology is mainly associated with Myh and PRRSV (Dee S, 1996; Thacker E L, et al., 1999) . Pneumonia caused by PRDC is characterized by slow growth, decreased feed effi ciency, lethargy, anorexia, fever and cough.",

Surprisingly, however, sequencing results led to grouping of viruses isolated from the farms within the original H1N1 pandemic of 2009, four of which shared 99% homology. Therefore, it is important to consider swine infl uenza virus of pandemic origin as a pathogen playing an infl uential role in the presentation of PRDC in commercial pig farms in the country. The pandemic H1N1/09 virus (A/CA/4/09) is a swine infl uenza A virus subtype H1N1 strain responsible for the 2009 fl u pandemic. The virus originates from swine, but was never established as circulating in pig populations before its detection in humans (Reeth V K, et al., 1996) . SIV-H1N1p presentation in Colombia may have been attributed to human transmission from pigs, as reported in various countries (Weingartl H M, et al., 2010; Sreta D, et al., 2010; Pereda A, et al. 2010) . This hypothesis is based on the presentation of disease outbreaks in pigs and humans, as well as reports by the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE), which documented the presence of the virus in various countries, including Argentina, Canada, Australia, Ireland and United States.",

Co-infection studies of PRRSV and SIV have yielded conflicting results in terms of clinical disease. In animals experiencing swine influenza infection and PRRSV infection as a secondary pathogen, the disease is exacerbated, leading to prolonged fever, increased cough and weight loss ( Van Reeth K, et al. 1996; Kitikoon P, et al., 2009 ). On the other hand, prior infection with PRRSV does not aggravate acute SIV presentation but can generate subsequent chronic infection (Pol J M, et al., 1997) .",

Destruction of these cells in the lung by PRRSV is suggested as the key event causing lung susceptibility to secondary pathogens (Gucht S V, et al., 2014; Van Reeth K, et al., 1994) . PRRSV and SIV are the primary etiologic agents associated with respiratory disease of pigs in the United States (Choi Y, et al., Association of SIV-H1N1p with PRDC in sows from commercial pig farms in Colombia 2003) and co-infection could explain this role in porcine respiratory disease complex presentation. Primary SIV infection of epithelial cells of the airways results in cellular necrosis, production of infl ammatory mediators and rapid infiltration of phagocytic cells, including lung alveolar macrophages (PAM) susceptible to PRRSV infection. SIV infection-infl ammation may increase the target cells for initial infection of PRRSV, resulting in increased and prolonged pneumonia (Kitikoon P, et al., 2009) . Based on results from the current study, we propose that SIV-H1N1p blocks PRRSV replication or vice versa, and presentation of the disease is dependent on virulence and the time interval between infections (Kitikoon P, et al., 2009) .",

Clearly, the different forms of presentation of respiratory disease in pigs are attributed to the interactions of viral and bacterial agents, and although the etiology of PRDC involves multiple pathogens with variations among farms, limited information is available on the spread of the virus in our pig population. The current study showed that PCV2 and APP are the main viral-bacterial agents interacting with SIV-H1N1p in positive animals. Although it is difficult to establish whether swine flu virus is a pandemic primary, secondary or opportunistic agent, our data clearly indicate that SIV-H1N1p plays an important role in the presentation of PRDC, signifying the need to increase agricultural surveillance to prevent future outbreaks.",
