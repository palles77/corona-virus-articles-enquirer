Through a mean-field approximation and large-scale numerical simulations, we find that postponing the transition from the infectious to the recovered states can largely reduce the epidemic threshold, therefore promoting the outbreak of epidemics. On the other hand, if we consider nonuniform transmission among individuals, the epidemic threshold increases, thus inhibiting the spreading process. When both mechanisms are at work, the latter might prevail, hence resulting in an increase of the epidemic threshold with respect to the standard case, in which both ingredients are absent. Our findings are of interest for a better understanding of how diseases propagate on structured populations and to a further design of efficient immunization strategies.",

Especially in recent years, some emerging infectious diseases, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome(SARS) [2] , avian influenza [3, 4] , and swine influenza [5] , have resulted in huge life and economical losses. Thus, analyzing and understanding the propagation of infectious diseases is of great significance to efficiently control potentially devastating epidemic outbreaks as well as to deploy tailored immunization strategies. Traditionally, there are two typical epidemic models: the Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS) and the Susceptible-Infected-Removed (SIR) models. Both kinds of models have been intensively studied during the last few years, adding to the traditional well-mixed hypotheses usually invoked by the models [6] an ever increasing dose of realism.",

Today, the modeling of infectious diseases and their prevention and control has become an interdisciplinary issue which has attracted the attention of scientists from epidemiology, biology, mathematics, physics and computational sciences [10] [11] [12] [13] . In particular, Pastor-Satorras and We assume that after the initial infection, the newly infected node will remain infectious during a time window of T + 1 time steps, after which the node recovers and gets back to the susceptible state.",

Similar conclusions were also found for the SIR model on SF networks by Moreno et al. [16] . These alarming results have inspired a great number of related works, and most results point out that the topology of interactions dominates the spreading dynamics in complex networks [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] .",

For instance, the issue of delayed recovery can be thought of as the time elapsed since an individual becomes infected and the moment he/she starts the treatment that could lead to recovery [37, 38] . This is especially relevant when studying spreading dynamics of diseases for which spontaneous recovery not due to medical treatment is unlikely. In what follows, we study the effects of such delayed recovery on the epidemic thresholds of an SIS dynamics that takes place on top of homogeneous and heterogeneous networks. Moreover, we also consider the case of nonuniform transmission (i.e., the fact that the spreading capabilities of an individual depend on his/her number of contacts) and the situation in which both mechanisms are concurrently active. To this end, we make use of the heterogeneous mean-field theory and perform large-scale numerical simulations, which we show are in agreement with the analytical predictions.",

Fig. 4 shows the numerical results, which confirm that the underlying networks do not determine the epidemic thresholds. Actually, they are the same in both panels for all values of T simulated. Fig. 5 describes what happens when both mechanisms are simultaneously active.

The latter mechanism is intended to model situations in which subjects avoid contacting all of their neighbors and therefore their contagion capabilities are reduced. The former, on the contrary, accounts for a common attitude of sick subjects, who quite often refrain from taking a treatment from the very initial stages of the disease, thus delaying their recovery. Through a mean-field analysis and numerical simulations, we have shown that the delayed recovery reduces the epidemic threshold whereas the nonuniform spreading has the opposite effect. It is worth stressing that in our model, the delayed recovery is introduced as an independent parameter, and not through smaller values of \u03b3 , as the latter is a parameter that characterizes the disease and we are accounting for a behavioral reaction, i.e., that of postponing the treatment. When both ingredients are simultaneously present, whether or not the new effective epidemic threshold is reduced with respect to the standard case depends on their interplay: if contacts between spreaders and susceptible individuals are significantly reduced as could be the case in a real epidemic, then the disease-free region will be larger. Otherwise, the longer permanence of infected subjects as such will not be compensated by their reduced contagion capabilities. Altogether, our results point out that in order for different countermeasures to be effective, which usually include isolation of sick individuals and therefore cutting down the number of potential susceptible-infectious contacts, other aspects such as the presence of ''free-riders'' that delay their recovery should also be taken into account.",
