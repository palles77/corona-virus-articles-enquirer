Feline coronavirus (FCoV) is comprised of two closely related biotypes: (1) a ubiquitous form present in virtually all large multi-cat environments which leads to seroconversion and causes very little disease, known as feline enteric coronavirus (FECV) and (2) a much less common mutant form of FECV that has gained the ability to replicate in macrophages, and causes feline infectious peritonitis known as FIP virus (FIPV). Both biotypes exist in at least two strains (types I and II) with large numbers of genetic variants.",

This procedure is based on the findings that some queens do not shed the virus, some queens will stop shedding after several weeks if not re-exposed, and that even if they do shed, very young kittens have maternal resistance to the virus (Addie and Jarrett, 1992) . Therefore, if you can prevent outside infection, you should be able to remove the kittens from the queen before they can be infected and then continue to raise them clear of the infection. Early weaning and isolation is not just a good idea for the control of FCoV, but also for the control of feline calicivirus, feline herpesvirus, Bordetella bronchiseptica, Microsporum spp. and the many enteric infections to which kittens are susceptible.",

The procedure requires quarantine rooms and procedures that absolutely ensure that new virus does not enter. It also works best when the isolated queens are not shedding FCoV, when they are shedding low levels, or when they can clear the infection early after being isolated. The single factor that most assures these conditions is the number of animals. The success of early weaning and isolation in FCoV control depends on effective quarantine and low numbers of cats in the household, preferably under 5 or 6. If there are less than 5 or 6 cats, the chances of there being high or persistent shedders is low. Also, human abodes do not easily allow for adequate quarantine space for large numbers of queens and kittens and the time and money required to maintain quarantine goes up in proportion to the number of queens and litters under quarantine. As examples of environment and cat numbers, all kittens under 8 weeks old submitted to a USA shelter were FCoV negative (Pedersen et al., 2003) . These were kittens that largely came from one-queen homes. In contrast, a Swiss study in large catteries demonstrated viral infection of kittens as young as 2 weeks old (Lutz et al., 2002) . It is clear that low FCoV exposure will delay infection, while high exposure can overcome maternally derived immunity at an early age.",

Second, some breeders believe that early weaning exacts a social price on the kittens. In recognition of both concerns, the group recommended that early weaning not be undertaken without careful consideration. FCoV-free households would not be required to undertake routine isolation and early weaning. Where kittens are isolated with their queen, extra care must be taken during the 2-7 weeks-of-age period to socialise the kittens. The success of early weaning should also be measured, and not continued in situations where it is not working. Kittens that have been successfully reared free of the FCoV should be antibody negative at 12 weeks of age. If they are antibody positive, it means that they have been infected with the virus.",

The virus is very widespread, even among outdoor cats, and it is easily carried on clothes, hair, hands, shoes, etc. (Pedersen et al., 1981) . Therefore, the objective of isolation and early weaning should not be to prevent infection forever, but to delay it. It is known that immunity to FIPV does not develop until around 16 weeks of age (based on experience with Primucell \u00ae vaccine (Pfizer) (reviewed by Pedersen et al., 1995) ). We also have anecdotal evidence that FIPV infection in shelter and cattery kittens occurs in the first 2 months or so of life, even though the actual disease may not appear outwardly for many weeks, months, and sometimes years.",

Cats with high titres (1:400) are almost always shedding high levels of virus. Some of these cats will stop shedding upon isolation, and this will be demonstrated by a decrease in their titre to low or negligible levels. If a cat is persistently shedding virus, the titre will always remain high. If laboratories cannot offer accurate antibody testing, than the alternative is for commercial laboratories to make available quantitative RT-PCR to measure viral load. PCR based tests would be a direct measure of virus shedding. Veterinarians would be supplied with a faecal swab in a tube and a bar code. This would allow for accurate submission of samples.",

Do high shedders or resistant cats have genetic markers for either state? Susceptibility to FCoV infection is likely to be different to susceptibility to the mutant FIPV. We know that the heritability of FIP is about 50%; susceptible cats being approximately twice as likely to develop FIP as other cats (Foley and Pedersen, 1996) . That is why we do not recommend breeding cats that have thrown kittens that later developed FIP. This would be especially true of toms, which can sire so many more kittens and therefore have a greater genetic influence on the bloodline.",

Most infected cats develop immunity, but the immunity disappears when the virus is controlled and the cats are then reinfected. Most cats are repeatedly infected with the same strain of FCoV, as well as by different strains (Addie et al., 2003) .

Immunohistochemistry to identify viral proteins in macrophages within lesions can be used on tissues taken at biopsy or necropsy. Positive immunohistochemical staining of macrophages within lesions is considered the most definitive test for FIP. However, the possibility of detecting replicating FCoVs within circulating monocytes by RT-PCR was presented at this meeting and looks promising (Simons et al., 2002) .

Most cats with FIP are from 6 months to 3 years of age, come from shelters or catteries, and show signs of cyclical antibiotic resistant fevers and specific physical manifestations depending on the form of the disease and location of lesions. A second tier of test findings include characteristic analysis of peritoneal or pleural effusions, elevated white blood cell counts with neutrophilia and lymphopenia, elevated globulin levels, and non-regenerative anaemia of chronic disease and hypoalbuminemia, and elevated fibrinogen. Laboratory tests, such as the serology and RT-PCR should comprise a third tier of diagnostics. Because a wide range of tests is quite expensive, it is prudent to start with basic tests first and add additional procedures only if preliminary testing justifies them. For these reasons we recommend starting with a laboratory approach only when the clinical signs are strongly suggestive of FIP and keeping in mind a list of possible differential diagnoses. This might help to choose the best panel of tests to apply to your case.",

In particular, protein and globulin determination, cytology and bacterial cultures should be performed. These tests might strongly support the diagnosis of FIP, when high proteins and/or globulin concentrations are found in a sterile effusion with cytologic signs of a nonspecific inflammatory process. In any case, they will rule out septic effusions and neoplasia (mainly lymphomas), but might not be enough to differentiate FIP from, for example, cholangiohepatitis. The detection of FCoVs in the effusion is the only conclusive test in these cases. To do this, immunocytologic techniques (immunofluorescence, immunohistochemistry) are preferable to the detection of FCoV genome by RT-PCR: although RT-PCR might easily detect FCoV in the effusions (Kita et al., 2002) , as previously stated, it is a very sensitive technique and can detect any small amount of virus that might extravasate from blood to the effusion during every inflammatory process in cats with circulating FCoVs. In contrast, immunocytology detects only large amounts of virus and, moreover, allows identification of macrophages as the cells carrying the FCoVs. A positive result using these techniques can thus confirm the diagnosis of FIP, while an eventual negative result does not exclude the disease (Hartmann et al., 2002) . In these cases, as in dry forms, the detection of other clinico-pathological changes is needed to support the clinical diagnosis of FIP.",

It is not possible in this report, to list all possible differential diagnoses, due to the extreme variability in clinical signs detectable in dry forms. This list, however, should include any possible cause of fever of unknown origin (FUO), uveitis, neurological alterations, hepatic or renal failure. The panel of tests to be used should be decided based on these symptoms and should always include a complete CBC (non-regenerative anaemia, neutrophilic leukocytosis and in particular, lymphopenia might have a high diagnostic value for FIP), the determination of the albumin/globulin ratio, eventually followed by a serum protein electrophoresis in the case of high globulins ( 2 and -globulins are expected to be elevated during FIP), and the measurement of 1 -acid glycoprotein levels (high concentrations of this protein, although not specific, might be strongly suggestive of FIP; Duthie et al., 1997) . Although none of the above mentioned changes is per se suggestive of FIP, the presence of multiple alterations in cats with symptoms suggestive of FIP might highly increase the probability of correctly diagnosing the disease. Other tests might also be considered: in pure neurologic forms, for example, diagnostic imaging can exclude the presence of intracranial tumours, and antibody titre in CSF can be evaluated and compared to those in blood; a high CSF/blood ratio might be detected during FIP, based on the assumption that antibodies are produced within the CNS but the results of this test must be carefully considered, since alterations of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) are often present during FIP. The presence of a BBB damage can be excluded by measuring the serum:CSF ratio of antibodies against other infectious agents (e.g. herpesviruses). The cost/benefit ratio of such a complicated panel of tests, however, strongly reduces its practical use. The detection of histologic lesions consistent with FIP has been considered the only conclusive test for FIP for a long time (Barlough and Stoddart, 1998) and the finding of viral antigen in the lesions using immunofluorescence or immunohistochemistry (again, RT-PCR, is too sensitive) allows further confirmation of the diagnosis. Unfortunately, surgical biopsies cannot be taken frequently during FIP, due to the poor general conditions of the affected cats. The probability of detecting histologic lesions or positive macrophages in ultrasound-guided tru-cut biopsies (TCB) or in fine needle aspiration biopsies (FNA) is very low and negatively correlated with the extension of the pyogranulomatous foci (Paltrinieri, manuscript in preparation). Based on the general health status, the clinician should then decide among the following three diagnostic approaches: expose the cat to the risk of anaesthesia and laparoscopy/ laparotomy to obtain surgical biopsies and gather a conclusive diagnosis of FIP; perform a non-invasive bioptic technique (TCB, FNA) with the possibility of a false negative result; obtain only a presumptive diagnosis based on clinico-pathological changes. A presumptive diagnosis, however, would be not enough to subject the cat to any treatment.",

Although encouraging results obtained using feline recombinant feline interferon have been presented at this meeting (Ishida et al., 2004) further data are needed before recommendation of extensive use of this treatment. The best treatment at the present time is to stage the disease and treat symptomatically. As long as the cat is eating, feeling relatively well, and not losing weight, affected animals should be fed a high quality diet and kept as stress free as possible. In contrast, if the cat is losing condition, is suffering from specific debilitating signs of the disease, and has a poor quality of life, treatment should be counselled against. Severely affected animals should then be euthanased, due to short survival expectation. Even in cats with mild initial disease signs, the ultimate mortality is over 95%. However, miracle cures do happen from time to time, and miracles cannot happen unless they are allowed time to happen.",

            "text": "1. In the absence of an effective vaccine, it was considered a priority to prevent cats becoming infected with FCoV at all. It was considered important to look at ways of minimising virus dose. Existing cat litters need to be checked for their ability to limit FCoV transmission by biocidal action and/or good clumping. The effect of flushing litter trays on FCoV spread needs to be investigated. 2. The ideal vaccine should protect against FIP, give good mucosal immunity to prevent infection and reduce virus shedding. Development of a therapeutic vaccine should also be considered, both to treat cats with FIP and to attempt to stop carrier cats from shedding. For the latter, it is essential to establish where the virus is in carrier cats (the ileum and colon are the most likely areas) so that immune clearance of virus from this area is taken into consideration in vaccine development. 3. The group was concerned about antibody dependent enhancement (ADE) being a laboratory artefact (Vennema et al., 1998) . Studies have shown that 40% or more of cats with FIP shed FCoV from their gut, but that the virus is of the intestinal type and will not cause FIP when given to susceptible kittens (Foley, J.E., and Pedersen, N.C., UC Davis, unpublished information) . In contrast, virus taken from internal lesions readily induces FIP. The FIP causing virus is only present within macrophages in internal lesions, where it has no access to the outside. However, some investigators have seen 'outbreaks' of FIP, which can best be explained by an FIPV carrier. Although there are alternative explanations for such mini-epidemics, it is theoretically possible for cats with lesions in their kidneys or intestinal wall to shed FIPV in urine or feces. 5. More molecular work needs to be undertaken on the exact mutations that cause FCoVs to become FIPVs and how these mutations change the behavior of the virus:",

More work is required to understand exactly what FIPV does in the infected macrophage. In addition, the cytokine profiles of naturally infected cats needs to be determined. 8. The phenomenon of resistant cats requires further investigation. Might it be possible to breed cats resistant to FCoV infection? Could resistant cats simply have been exposed very early in life (e.g. in the first week) and therefore have become immune tolerant? 9.

A reasonable challenge virus needs to be defined. The 79-1146 strain is probably not a good choice, since it is extremely virulent and also is a type II FCoV. The working group called for standardisation of vaccine challenge protocols worldwide, using a constant virus dose, strains more representative of natural infection (including types I and II) and natural exposure challenge (i.e. challenge not given parenterally). The virus dose threshold over which FIP develops would need to be established. A challenge virus stock should be made and stored in two or three locations worldwide and supplied from there to those working on novel vaccines. 4. The current belief is that cats with FIPV do not transmit the mutant virus to other cats",
