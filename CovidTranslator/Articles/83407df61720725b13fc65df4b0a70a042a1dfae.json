IL-17A and IL-17F are important molecules in neutrophil recruitment and granulopoiesis 2 . IL-23 has also been shown to be crucial as an upstream regulator of IL-17 production in vivo 11, 12 . Mice with a homozygous deletion of the gene encoding IL-17 receptor A (Il17ra), which can bind both IL-17A and IL-17F ( ref. 13 ), are susceptible to lung infection with the Gramnegative bacteria K. pneumoniae. These mice do not mount a normal mucosal granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) response, which leads to defective granulopoiesis in response to the infection 14 . Antibodies to IL-17A have also been shown to impair intraabdominal abscess formation in response to Bacteroides fragilis 15 and host defense against Bordetella pertussis 16 and Mycoplasma pulmonis 17 .",

Here we show that human bronchial epithelial (HBE) cells express IL-22R and that IL-22 and IL-17 induce host defense genes, as well as increase the clonogenic potential of HBE cells. Using an experimental model of Gram-negative pneumonia, we show that IL-22 is produced in a time-dependent fashion, similarly to IL-17A and IL-17F ( ref. 12 ), and is regulated by IL-23. Neutralization of IL-22 resulted in a marked bacterial dissemination from the lung that was exacerbated by the absence of IL-17A. IL-22 also increased the expression of host defense genes in mouse lung epithelium and, among these, lipocalin-2 was required for IL-22augmented epithelial antimicrobial activity in vitro. These data demonstrate that IL-22 has a crucial role in mucosal host defense, and they support the concept that the T H 17 cell lineage and the effector molecules produced by these cells evolved to effect host defense against extracellular pathogens at mucosal sites.",

Similar to mice deficient in IL-23 (Il23a \u2212/\u2212 ), mice deficient in IL-17RA, which is required for IL-17A and IL-17F signaling 13 , are not more susceptible to H37Rv M. tuberculosis infection than wild-type mice ( Supplementary Fig. 1 online) . Moreover, IL-17RA signaling is not required for host defense against another T H 1-dependent pathogen, Listeria monocytogenes ( Supplementary Fig. 2 online), and these mice have normal interferon-\u03b3 responses upon antigen recall to the pathogen ( Supplementary Fig. 2 ). This is consistent with normal T H 1 immunity and host resistance against L. monocytogenes in Il22 \u2212/\u2212 mice 22 .

There was a significant increase in IL-22-producing CD90 + cells in K. pneumoniae-infected mice compared to uninfected controls ( Supplementary Fig. 5b ).

Compared to WT mice or Il17a \u2212/\u2212 mice given control antibody, WT mice treated with antibody to IL-22 were moribund 24 h after infection and had to be killed.

Administration of antibodies to IL-22 did not affect induction of IL-17A in this model ( Supplementary Fig. 6 online). Consistent with a more crucial role for IL-22 than for IL-17A in mucosal host defense, increased dissemination to the spleen was not detectable in Il17a \u2212/\u2212 mice until 48 h after infection (Fig. 2f) . Moreover, administration of IL-22-specific antibody to Il17a \u2212/\u2212 mice before infection with K. pneumoniae resulted in significantly greater bacterial growth in the lung (Fig. 2g) and significantly more bacterial dissemination to the spleen (Fig. 2h ) at 24 h after infection.

However, compared to WT mice, mice treated with antibody to IL-22 showed no difference in BAL G-CSF and CXCL1 protein concentrations ( Fig. 3a,b) . Despite the lack of a function for IL-22 in regulation of G-CSF and CXCL1 in WT mice, Il17a \u2212/\u2212 mice given antibody to IL-22 had lower Csf3 abundance compared to Il17a \u2212/\u2212 mice given control antibody, but this difference was not statistically significant. Moreover, CXCL1 expression was partially dependent on both IL-17A and IL-22, as it was lower in Il17a \u2212/\u2212 mice treated with antibody to IL-22 (Fig. 3b) . In contrast to G-CSF, IL-22 was crucial for IL-6 production in the lung, as both antibody to IL-22-treated WT and Il17a \u2212/\u2212 mice had statistically significant reductions in BAL IL-6 abundance 24 h after infection (Fig. 3c) . A similar pattern was also observed with CCL3 (Fig. 3d) , where mice treated with antibody to IL-22 had significantly lower CCL3 in the BAL fluid at 24 h after infection compared to control mice. In the absence of IL-17A, antibody neutralization of IL-22 resulted in a further reduction in IL-6 and CCL3 abundance, suggesting a requirement for both IL-17A and IL-22 in this response.",

Of note, very little IL-22 was detected in these samples (Fig. 6e) . Based on the fact that in our mouse pneumonia model, IL-22 levels were higher in lung tissue than in BAL, we sought to determine whether IL-22 responses were elevated in lung lymphoid tissue in humans. We isolated cells from explanted hilar lymph nodes from individuals with end-stage cystic fibrosis undergoing lung transplantation (n = 5), in addition to uninfected control lung lymph nodes from individuals without cystic fibrosis (n = 2). Compared to uninfected lung lymph nodes from individuals without cystic fibrosis, dissociated lymph nodes cells from P. aeruginosa-infected subjects with cystic fibrosis had significantly increased spontaneous production of IL-17A (Fig. 6f) , IL-17F and IL-22 (Fig. 6g) , and production of these cytokines were stimulated with concanavalin A (ConA), a glycoprotein that stimulates T lymphocyte proliferation (Fig.  6f,g) .",

IL-22 expression in vivo is regulated by IL-23, and rescue of Il23a \u2212/\u2212 mice is associated with increased lung epithelial expression of CXCL1, CXCL2 and CXCL9. Similar to the situation in Il17ra \u2212/\u2212 mice, IL-17A was crucial for the induction of G-CSF, a key regulator of granulopoiesis in response to an infectious challenge 14 , in the lung. However, IL-22 was more important than IL-17A in regulating pulmonary IL-6 and CCL3 production. Studies in Il17a \u2212/\u2212 mice show that IL-6 and CCL3 are coordinately regulated by both T H 17 effectors, suggesting that the synergy observed with IL-17A and IL-22 in human bronchial epithelial cells in terms of gene expression is relevant in the in vivo setting as well. Additional activities of IL-22 not shared by IL-17A were the effect of increasing clonogenic frequencies of HBE cells, as well enhancing repair of transepithelial resistance. These activities of IL-22 may be crucial for maintaining barrier function at epithelial surfaces. In support of this, WT and Il17a \u2212/\u2212 mice that received antibody to IL-22 had more rapid bacterial dissemination outside of the lung compared with mice given control antibody. In vitro MTEC studies show that a key gene regulated by IL-22 in the epithelium is lipocalin-2, which is required for epithelial host defense against K. pneumoniae in vitro. This is consistent with the fact that Lcn2 \u2212/\u2212 mice are susceptible to certain Gram-negative bacteria, depending upon which siderophores they express 25, 26 .",

These data strongly suggest that the T H 17 lineage evolved to mediate host defense at mucosal and serosal surfaces against extracellular pathogens. Additionally, neutralization of IL-17A has been shown to abrogate host defense against lung pathogens, such as K. pneumoniae and M. pulmonis 14, 17 , systemic infection with the fungus Candida albicans 29 , as well as in the setting of intra-abdominal infection, B. fragilis 15 and E. coli 30 . Potential host defense mechanisms downstream from IL-22 and IL-17A, in addition to granulopoiesis, are the regulation of chemokine gradients and the mucosal production of antimicrobial proteins such as \u03b2-defensins 31 and calgranulins 20 . It is noteworthy that IL-22 responses are significantly elevated in lung lymphoid tissue from human subjects with cystic fibrosis. This is consistent with elevated levels of antimicrobial peptides in the sputum and BAL of these individuals 32 and may explain in part why bacteremia with P. aeruginosa is rare in these individuals.",

In this study, IL-17A regulated the expression of CXCL9 and CXCL10, thereby regulating T H 1 cell recruitment 24 . It has recently been shown that IL-17A is also required for vaccine-induced immunity against S. pneumoniae 33 and B. pertussis 16 . The vaccine-induced immunity observed in S. pneumoniae infection was independent of antibody production 33 , suggesting that T H 17 cells may regulate mucosal immunity apart from humoral immune responses. Thus, adjuvants that are capable of regulating IL-22 or IL-17A production may serve as robust adjuvants where one desires strong mucosal immunity. A caveat of this approach is the fact that T H 17 cells are also important in autoimmunity 1, 34 . Recently, it has been shown that IL-27 is a key negative regulator of T H 17 immunity 35, 36 and may be crucial for limiting T H 17-induced pathology in the setting of infection. In summary, both IL-22 and IL-17A have independent roles in maintaining host defense against K. pneumoniae, and these results raise the possibility for new therapies to use these cytokines to limit or prevent mucosal infections.",
