Although there is debate over when and how they may happen, there is little question that such events could have significant and far-reaching health, social, and economic consequences. Moreover, smaller outbreaks, such as influenza and West Nile Virus, 5 occur with greater regularity. Internists can play vital roles in identifying, responding to, and containing bioterrorist attacks and disease outbreaks if they understand their role in these events.",

Internists are also well-positioned to work with various health care personnel and services during a disaster. Therefore, Internists must understand early warning signs of bioterrorist and infectious agents, proper reporting channels and measures, and ways that they can help contain and treat the consequences of epidemics, outbreaks, and attacks.",

Depending on the agent and its mode of transmission, the population density, and the population's access to health care, it can be days or even weeks before anyone can recognize the problem. As the early response may be crucial in containing the problem and minimizing resultant morbidity and mortality, efforts have been made to develop biosurveillance systems to detect outbreaks and attacks. [7] [8] [9] These systems collect pertinent data (e.g., pharmacy drug sales, emergency department visit chief complaints, and air samples) and search for irregularities that suggest a problem is occurring. However, these systems are by no means foolproof because they only look for a finite set of clues, do not cover every part of the United States, and may provide equivocal information. Moreover, there could be delays between the point that biosurveillance systems detect suspicious patterns and when the public health system responds. Therefore, Internists might be the first to become aware of a problem and pivotal in initiating the public health response. Internists see large numbers of patients with various health problems and may be the patients' only interaction with the medical community for symptoms resulting from infectious diseases and injuries from radiation, chemicals, and/or burns. So they could be the first to report attacks or outbreaks and initiate public health response. Indeed, there are examples of \"astute\" clinicians being the first to recognize epidemic or bioterrorist attacks (e.g., the 1999 New York City West Nile outbreak, 5 the 2001 anthrax attack cases, 10, 11 and the 2003 SARS epidemic in Vietnam 12 ).",

Seven had mediastinal widening, and 8 had pleural effusions. All but 1 had elevated liver transaminases. A combination of these findings is highly suspicious for inhalational anthrax, especially in a young, otherwise healthy patient and/or when a patient initially experiences nonspecific influenza-like symptoms followed first by a brief period of apparent recovery, and then, by an abrupt resurgence of more severe symptoms. 15 However, in a majority of cases, early symptoms are vague and readily mistaken for more common upper respiratory infections (e.g., influenza, plague, tularemia, and staphylococcal enterotoxin B) or viral gastroenteritis (e.g., hepatitis A, cryptosporidium, and salmonella).",

Different organ systems can be affected (e.g., meningitis from inhalational anthrax, sepsis from typhoidal tularemia, and pneumonia from influenza), so complete examinations are important. Websites providing extensive treatment and prophylaxis information include the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) (http://www.bt.cdc.gov/), Food and Drug Administration (FDA) (http://www.fda.gov/cder/drugprepare/default.htm), Department of Health and Human Services (http://www.hhs.gov/disasters/index.shtml), and National Library of Medicine (http://www.nlm.nih.gov/ medlineplus/biodefenseandbioterrorism.html); 2. administer prophylaxis to the exposed but not the infected. Determining exposure can be difficult as patients may claim that they have been exposed. In a large-scale epidemic or attack, public health officials may set up temporary stations for mass vaccination and prophylaxis. However, many patients may still appear at clinics requesting prophylaxis; 3. triage who gets treated in a large outbreak/attack. Internists will have to prioritize who should receive treatment, especially when necessary resources and skilled manpower are limited. Knowing when and how to ration treatments can be challenging, particularly in chaotic conditions. Although Internists may feel compelled to acquiesce to every patient's needs, their primary responsibility in public health emergencies is the public. 24 While clear guidelines have not been established and rationing decisions are rather controversial, certain groups such as essential personnel (e.g., health care workers, police, fire fighters, and other individuals integral in responding to a public health disaster) should receive priority. Essential personnel are needed to prevent more casualties and fatalities and could spread contagious diseases to many other people; 4. treat mental health consequences. Public health disasters can result in significantly increased mental health problems including anxiety, depression, and posttraumatic stress disorders. [25] [26] [27] [28] Evidence suggests that even people who witness, hear, or read about a disaster can be affected. 29, 30 Shortages of mental health professionals in a disaster often require Internists to handle patients' mental health issues. 31-35 5. treat comorbidity exacerbations. Evidence suggests that undue environmental stresses can exacerbate comorbidities such as heart disease and respiratory disease. [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] In addition, during public health disasters, patients with certain chronic diseases (e.g., diabetes and chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases) may not have adequate access to maintenance treatments. 44 PROPER REPORTING AND THE PUBLIC HEALTH AND LAW ENFORCEMENT CHAIN OF COMMAND Figure 1 illustrates the public health chain of command. Internists suspecting an attack or epidemic should immediately inform the local or state health department and contain any possible threat in their clinics, especially if the agent is contagious. Providing information to wrong people (especially news media) may cause mass terror and delay the public health system's response. Therefore, Internists must remain calm, understand how their words can be misunderstood and misconstrued, follow instructions from appropriate health, military and law enforcement officials, and allow properly trained public health officials to deal with the media.",
