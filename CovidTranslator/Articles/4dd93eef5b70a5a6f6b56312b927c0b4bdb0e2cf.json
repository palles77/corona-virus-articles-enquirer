We have generated C-terminal truncated mutants by serial truncations. The quaternary structure of the enzyme was analyzed using both sedimentation velocity and sedimentation equilibrium analytical ultracentrifugation. Global analysis of the combined results showed that truncation of C-terminus from 306 to 300 had no appreciable effect on the quaternary structure, and the enzyme remained catalytically active. However, further deletion of Gln-299 or Arg-298 drastically decreased the enzyme activity to 1-2% of wild type (WT), and the major form was a monomeric one. Detailed analysis of the point mutants of these two amino acid residues and their nearby hydrogen bond partner Ser-123 and Ser-139 revealed a strong correlation between the enzyme activity loss and dimer dissociation.",

However, Bacha et al. [15] showed that the N-terminal His-tag affected the K d .

As shown in Fig. 1A , His 6 tag at the C-terminus is pointed away from the dimer interfacial region. It is reasonable to assume that it will not affect the quaternary structure of the Cterminal truncation mutants; but for those mutations at the inner site, it might create problems.

Mutation at S139 to Ala could destroy neither the enzyme activity nor the dimeric structure (Table 3) . Significant difference with WT in enzyme activity and dimeric stability were found only in the double mutants, S123A/R298A and S139A/ Q299A. The functional role of these serine residues was not clear. Similar results on S139A were reported by Barrila et al. [17] .",

Increased hydrophobic interactions between the subunits of the double mutants might be accounted for these seem odd results. We have no further structural evidence to prove this speculation yet. However, we have a large number of mutants in hand that allow us to evaluate the correlation between the kinetic and dimerization properties of the enzyme.",

Although K d increased as the K m /k cat and k cat decreased, K m did not. This data suggested that K d was related to the catalysis but not to the apparent binding ability between substrate and proteases. Similar observations were found for the relationship between K m / k cat , K m , k cat , and k off . The k off also affected only the catalytic rate but not the substrate binding ability. The increase of K d and k off correlated with the increase of monomeric form protease, which also correlated directly with the decrease of enzyme activity. All these results indicated that the monomeric SARS-CoV main protease was enzymatically inactive and this enzyme provides an ideal model system to study an enzyme activity regulated through quaternary structure.",
