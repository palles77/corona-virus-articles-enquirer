For in vitro evaluation, siR-NAs expressing BHK-21 cell lines (BHK-L and BHK-N) were developed using transduction with Lenti-L and Lenti-N lentiviruses encoding siRNAs against RV-L and N genes, respectively. When these cell lines were challenged in vitro with RV Pasteur virus-11 (PV-11) strain, there was reduction in number of RV-specific foci and target gene transcripts indicating inhibitory effect on RV multiplication. For in vivo evaluation, mice were treated intracerebrally with lentiviruses and challenged with 20 LD 50 of RV challenge virus standard-11 (CVS-11) strain by intramuscular route in masseter muscle. Five out of eight mice treated with Lenti-N survived indicating 62.5 % protection. The control and Lenti-L-treated mice died within 7-10 days indicating lethal nature of challenge virus and no protection. These results demonstrated that siRNA targeting RV-N could not only inhibit RV multiplication, but also conferred protection in mice against lethal RV challenge. These findings have implication on therapeutic use of siRNA targeting RV-N against RV infection.",

            "text": "One of the striking features of RNAi to perform sequencespecific degradation of perfectly complimentary RNA mediated through small interfering RNA (siRNA) has led to the development of a new therapeutic to target viralassociated RNAs without affecting host cellular RNAs. Animal as well as human pathogenic viruses are exceptional targets for RNAi because of their exogenous and unique nature of sequences in the host, which minimize off-target side effects. Specific inhibition of essential viral genes to prevent viral multiplication in mammalian cells can be triggered by the introduction of synthetic 21-23nucleotide double-stranded siRNA [1, 2] or alternatively, by the transcription of siRNAs from a DNA construct driven by the RNA polymerase expression cassettes [3] . The RNAi-based antiviral approach has been investigated against several viruses ([4] for review), including human immunodeficiency virus [5, 6] , hepatitis B virus [7, 8] , dengue virus [9] , human papilloma virus [10] , poliovirus [11] , hepatitis C virus [12] , respiratory syncytial virus [13] , severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus [14] , and influenza virus [15] . In addition, several reports have investigated the potential of RNAi against rabies infection [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] .",

            "text": "Rabies virus (RV) is an RNA virus belonging to the genus Lyssavirus under the family Rhabdoviridae. This virus is highly neurotropic and is usually transmitted from one infected animal to another animal or human by bite. The virus enters the nervous system of the new host through nerve endings at or near the bite site. RV does not establish a viremia in the infected host; however, the viral pathogenesis targets the brain using the peripheral nerves and neurons of the central nervous system (CNS) for virus replication and transport. Under natural condition, RV infection of the CNS causes only relatively mild neuropathological changes without prominent evidence of neuronal death [21] . This observation has led to the concept that the neurologic symptoms in rabies result from neuronal dysfunction rather than neuronal cell death. With promising power of RNAi to selectively eliminate target RNA in the cell without disturbing cellular function or no cytopathological changes, a strategy can be developed to inhibit the RV multiplication in CNS to block the pathogenic process and, therefore disease progression may be prevented. Among the five RV proteins, the nucleoprotein (N), phosphoprotein (P), and polymerase (L) proteins are important targets for RNAi owing to their roles in both viral transcription and replication. There are reports on in vitro evaluation of RNAi on rabies targeting viral structural genes like, N [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] . Further, glycoprotein (G) also remained a potential target for RNAi because RV-G is considered to be essential for virus trans-synaptic spread between neurons in vivo [22, 23] . Other targets for RNAi on rabies were nonstructural genes, like matrix (M) and phosphoprotein (P) with limited antiviral potential [24] .",

All the control mice developed rabies-specific symptoms and died within 6-7 days post-challenge with median survival of 7 days. There was no protection in mice treated with Lenti-L; however, median survival days were increased to 10 days compared with control mice. Treatment of mice with Lenti-N (lentivirus expressing siRNA against RV-N) demonstrated 62.5 % protection (Fig. 7) . The mice that survived after 14 days did not develop symptoms of rabies and remained healthy till the entire period of observation for 1 month. These results indicated that treatment of mice with lentivirus expressing siRNA against RV-N conferred modest protection against lethal RV challenge.",

            "text": "The replication cycle of negative-sense RNA viruses, including RV, consists of two successive events, namely, transcription of the viral genes to produce viral proteins, followed by replication of virus genome using virusencoded polymerase (L) protein. Among the five viral proteins, the nucleoprotein (N) has an important role in the formation of ribonucleoprotein-RNA complex, required as template for transcription [29] . It is observed that level of RV-N protein is very crucial for the switch from transcription to replication during virus life cycle [30, 31] . Therefore, in this study, the RV-L and N genes have been targeted through RNAi approach to evaluate their effects on RV multiplication. Previous studies, including ours, have evaluated the effect of siRNAs targeting different RV genes on RV multiplication in vitro in BHK-21 cells and in vivo in mice [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] . The inhibitory effect of siRNAs against RV-N was found efficient in interfering with the expression of viral genes and conferred moderate protection against lethal RV challenge in mice treated intracerebrally with adenovirus-expressing siRNAs [19] . In this present study, we selected lentiviral system for siRNAs delivery which has advantage over other siRNAs' delivery methods, namely, long-term, continuous silencing of target gene and delivery into wide range of cells including, both dividing and nondividing cells (e.g., neurons). Apart from this, lentiviral vectors are less immunogenic, which makes them a preferred vector system for in vivo delivery [32] . These characteristics of lentiviral vector make them suitable for siRNAs delivery to nerve cells, the target cell for RV infection.",

The reduction in the number of RV-infected foci in siRNAs expressing cells compared with control cells indicated inhibition in RV multiplication. This inhibition was quantified by the levels of RV gene transcripts by qPCR. Since RNAi functions by identifying and degrading mRNA that shares sequence complementary with the siRNA, qPCR analysis was used to analyze the effect of siRNAs on RV-N or L mRNA expression. The levels of RV-L and N mRNA in the siRNAs expressing and RV-infected cells were significantly reduced compared with control cells. However, the si-L was less efficient in the transcript reduction assay (Fig. 5) . This is in corroboration with the observation that siRNA against N of Nipah virus was more effective than siRNA against L [33] , suggesting that transcript quantity might also play a role in siRNA efficacy. In RV-infected cells among all RV transcripts, RV-N transcripts are the most abundant, and L transcripts are the least abundant [34] . Apart from transcript reduction assay, both siRNAs (si-L and si-N) were equally effective in reducing the RV target gene expression (Fig. 3) , RV-specific foci (Fig. 4) , and progeny RV release from siRNA expressing cells (Fig. 6 ). Since RV-N and L proteins have interrelated effects on virus multiplication [24] , siRNAs targeting RV-L and N genes exhibited nonsignificant difference in inhibition of RV multiplication.",

The lenti-N-treated mice showed 62.5 % protection. This indicated that knockdown of RV-L gene by siRNAs could only prolong the outcome of infection. In contrast, knockdown of RV-N gene by siRNAs could not only prolong the outcome of disease but also conferred 62.5 % protection. Less effectiveness of knockdown of RV-L gene on mice protection might be due to its limited role in pathogenesis as it encodes nonstructural RNA-dependent RNA polymerase protein for virus genome replication. However, significant protection with mice treated by si-N might be attributed to the dual role of RV-N protein: as viral structural and regulatory protein during RV pathogenesis [24, 30, 31] .",

These studies supported that RV-N mRNA could be a good target for intervention to inhibit RV replication. In our previous study using adenoviral delivery, the siRNAs targeting RV-L and N genes demonstrated low (33.3 %) and moderate (66.6 %) levels of protection, respectively, in mice treated with adenoviruses expressing siRNAs [19] . In this study using lentiviral delivery, the siRNA targeting RV-L inhibited RV multiplication in vitro in BHK-21 cells but did not protect mice against lethal RV challenge. However, the siRNA targeting RV-N could not only inhibit RV multiplication in vitro in BHK-21 cells, but also demonstrated consistent moderate level of protection in treated mice against lethal RV challenge. These reports indicated significant implication on the use of viral vector-based siRNA delivery as an antiviral approach against RV infection. Further, the potential of siRNA targeting RV-N for therapeutic use against RV infection can be explored after careful optimization of dose and time of therapeutic administration either alone or in combination with siRNAs targeting other RV genes.",
