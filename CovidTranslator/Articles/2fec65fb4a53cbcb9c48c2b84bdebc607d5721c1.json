It was then introduced into rice genome by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. A total of 30 regenerated plants with hygromycin resistance were obtained in the selection media. The putative transgenic individuals were tested for the presence of ureB in the nuclear genome of rice plants by PCR analysis. Expression of ureB gene in rice plants was verified by RT-PCR and Western blot analysis using polyclonal human antiserum for transcription and translation levels respectively. These results provide a basis for further studies on the accumulation level of UreB recombinant protein in transgenic rice and potential utilization of trans-genic rice for delivery of edible vaccines against Helicobacter pylori.",

The standard treatment for H. pylori infections has depended on antibiotics in combination with proton pump inhibitors (Bazzoli et al. 2002) . Antibiotic-based triple therapies are, however, not practical for global control due to the high cost, patients' noncompliance and low effectiveness due to the development of antibiotic resistance among strains of H. pylori (Telford and Ghiara 1996) . Vaccination against H. pylori is therefore one of the most effective ways to control H. pylori infection and, indeed, administration of oral bacterial antigens can protect mice against H. pylori infection (Ferrero et al. 1994) .",

            "text": "Helicobacter pylori urease is essential for colonization of the stomach as it allows survival under acidic condition. Moreover, urease (including subunit proteins UreA and UreB) is one of the main antigens recognized by the human immune response to H. pylori, and UreB seems to be more protective than UreA (Ferrero et al. 1994) . Recently, recombinant urease has been used in vaccination trials to prevent infection by H. pylori in mice (Del Giudice et al. 2001) . Therapeutic mucosal immunization with recombinant UreB in mice induce a Th2 CD4 + T-cell response (Ermak et al.1998) . The antigen delivery system can influence the immune response qualitatively as well as quantitatively (Sheikh et al. 2000) . Although several approaches have been investigated, most have only focused on the bacterial systems. Plantmade vaccines are specially attractive as plant are free of human diseases, reducing screening costs for viruses and bacterial toxins. In addition, expression of vaccines in plants tissues provides a heat-stable environment, and enables oral delivery, thus eliminating injection-related hazards. It has been demonstrated that proteins produced in transgenic plants are capable of invoking protective immune responses against important pathogens (Haq et al. 1995; Mason et al. 1996; Arakawa et al. 1998) .",

The recombinant pCAMBIA13011-ureB plasmid enables selection of transformants on media containing hygromycin and stably integrates into nuclear chromosomal plant DNA. Callus was induced from the seeds of rice explants within 4 weeks in N6 medium. Transformation of rice with pCAMBIA13011-ureB was carried out using A. tumifaciens infiltration. The transformed calli were selected on solid N6 medium with antibiotics (40 lg hygromycin/ml and 500 lg cefotaxime/ml). To determine whether the CaMV35S promoter was active in callus tissue, clones were subjected to GUS histochemical assay after 4 weeks of selection. After staining for 16 h, 60% clones showed blue colouration although the intensity of staining varied considerably. The resistant calli were transferred to regeneration medium for shoot and root development. A total of 30 independent transgenic plants were obtained under hygromycin selection and transferred to soil in a greenhouse.",

The chances of acquiring mucosal immunity against infectious agents that enter the body across a mucosal surface are also increased with oral vaccines. Oral delivery of vaccines through consumption of edible plant tissue has been demonstrated to work effectively and induce both mucosal and systemic immune responses without the need of an adjuvant (Tacket et al. 1998) . It has been shown that plants can express, fold, assemble, and process foreign antigens and can provide both a simple vaccine-manufacturing process as well as a matrix suitable for oral immunization (Domansky et al. 1995 , Haq et al. 1995 , Tacket et al. 1998 , Richter et al. 2000 . Transgenic plants have been increasingly used for the expression of different antigens, and plant based vaccines are especially attractive as plants offer some distinct advantages over other systems.",

However in view of the antigen associated with tobacco plants it may not be the right choice to use as a source of edible vaccine. In the present study, a full-length ureB gene from a clinical strain ZJC02 of H. pylori successfully expressed a protective antigen in transgenic rice plants. However, the main disadvantage with transgenicplant based vaccines productions is the low accumulation of the antigen expressed. Several researches are currently focusing on how to increase the expression of recombinant proteins using specific reticulum retention signal sequences (Arakawa et al. 1998 , Gomez et al. 2000 . Our results represent the first report of H. pylori ureB gene expression in transgenic rice plants. This recombinant protein is recognized by human serum antibodies produced in response to a wild-type H. pylori infection, thereby opening the possibility of a low-cost alternative production of oral vaccines to H. pylori. The immunogenicity and extent of protection offered by oral delivery of the UreB protein expressed in rice remains to be tested. With the demonstration of successful ureB gene expression in rice plants, we are poised to move on towards making an edible vaccine against H. pylori.",
