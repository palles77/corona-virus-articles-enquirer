Background: Nurses play an essential role in all phases of disaster management. For nurses to respond competently, they must be equipped with the skills to provide comprehensive and holistic care to the populations affected by or at risk of disasters. Methods: A scoping review was conducted using the Joanna Briggs Institute methodology. The review used information from six databases: the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Ovid MEDLINE, ScienceDirect, ProQuest, Scopus and the Education Resources Information Center. Keywords and inclusion and exclusion criteria were identified as strategies to use in this review. Results: Twelve studies were eligible for result extraction, as they listed domains of the core competencies. These domains varied among studies. However, the most common domains were related to communication, planning, decontamination and safety, the Incident Command System and ethics. Conclusion: Knowledge of the domains of the core competencies, such as understanding the content and location of the disaster plan, communication during disaster and ethical issues is fundamental for nurses. Including these domains in the planning and provision of training for nurses, such as disaster drills, will strengthen their preparedness to respond competently to disaster cases. Nurses must be involved in future research in this area to explore and describe their fundamental competencies in each domain.",

Both natural and manmade disasters have significant effects on the health and the physical, emotional and psychological states of community members [27] . To control the possible negative effects of a disaster, a disaster management strategy must be implemented. The four main stages of providing proper disaster management are mitigation, preparedness, response and recovery [7] . Typically, mitigation and preparedness are implemented before a disaster occurs; the response stage is initiated during the disaster; and the recovery stage is carried out after the disaster [27] . The disaster management phases are summarised in Table 1 .",

Nurses provide holistic care for victims and their families. Daily et al. [8] argued that, at the scene of a disaster, nurses can work as coordinators, information distributers, emotional and psychological supporters and clinical and first aid providers; further, they can triage victims and prioritise patients' needs for care. Confidently responding to disasters and effectively providing help to the affected people requires adequately prepared nurses.",

First, the pre-event phase focuses on ensuring that nurses possess adequate knowledge, skills and abilities in the identification of risks, execution of response plans and preparation for all types of disasters before they occur. Second, in the disaster phase, nurses must provide physical, psychological and holistic care competently for individuals, families and communities along with special populations, such as children and the elderly. Finally, during the post-disaster phase, recovery and reconstruction take place. According to the ICN and WHO [16] nurses must have the sufficient knowledge and skills to care for the affected communities, individuals and families, not only in the immediate period but also in the long term.",

They are often not well prepared for caring for patients with symptoms related to biological weapons [1, 19, 34] . To ensure that nurses are well prepared and have the adequate knowledge and skills required for all phases of disaster management, international efforts have been made to develop the core competencies of disaster nursing [8, 34] ; however, these core competencies are inconsistent in their terminology and structures. For example, nurses in Japan are not familiar with the term competencies [17] . There is also a lack of evidence supporting the most appropriate set of the core competencies of disaster nursing [8] . Determining the most common domains of the core competencies of nurses identified in previous studies would help develop specific education programmes for disaster nursing preparedness, provide training and conduct research. This notion was supported by Ling and Daily [20] , who claimed that the development of education and training programmes for competencies in general or for specific areas is required to strengthen the level of preparedness of nurses worldwide.",

Surprisingly, among the seven core competency domains, no themes were generated for several of the important domains [15] study were measured, as they seem broad and were not determined based on specific objectives. In 2008, three studies were conducted in the United States to explore the core competencies of disaster nursing [26, 11, 31] . Each study contributed to the body of knowledge on disaster nursing by organising the competencies in each phase of disaster management. Polivka et al. [26] identified a total of 25 competencies (10 for disaster preparedness, 8 for response and 7 for recovery). Everly et al. [11] identified five domains of core competencies, while Subbarao et al. [31] identified seven domains, including planning, communication and ethics. Although there were differences in the number of domains in the three studies, they found similar domains, such as planning, communication and the Incident Command System (ICS).

Although considerable progress was made in their study, concerns regarding the core competencies in triage, transportation and psychological issues remained unexplored. However, a solution was proposed by Schultz et al. [29] , who identified 19 core competencies and more than 90 objectives. In doing so, they contributed to knowledge regarding disaster management for all healthcare providers (i.e., physicians, nurses and emergency management staff), both inside and outside of hospitals. The last study used a different methodology, as emergency nurses in Brazil were interviewed about the domains of the core competencies of disaster management; as a result, five domains were identified with a total of 17 competencies focused mainly on preparedness and response [22] .",

The ICN Disaster Nursing Competencies were designed to serve all nurses globally [16] and applies to all nursing settings (mental health, public health nursing, emergency nursing, nursing education, etc.).

Competencies related to planning include being aware of the location of the disaster plan and having the ability to activate it [37] . For an enhanced response, nurses should understand the purpose and content of the disaster plan. For instance, to provide effective action during a critical event or disaster, nurses must know how to respond, communicate and formulate a new plan if the situation changes suddenly [29] . For nurses to be capable of initiating a disaster plan, they must participate in its creation, as well. The proper execution of a plan requires continuous evaluation, education, training and drills [5] . After 9/11, the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organisations (JCAHO) challenged all healthcare organisations in the United States to create plans that would facilitate the effective management of disasters [10] . These plans were required to include the assessment and preparedness phases, understand risks and minimise their effects and provide outlines of the response and recovery processes [10] . These requirements suggest that nurses will respond more effectively to disaster situations if they are familiar with the content and location of the disaster plan. To ensure that this is the case, education, training and further research that investigates the current issues associated with planning, such as barriers to nurses' participation in creating disaster plans, is highly recommended. However, it must be acknowledged that staff nurses in many countries already participate in disaster exercises and training activities related to disaster management. These activities range from drills and discussion-based programmes, such as seminars and tabletop exercises, to more complex operation-based initiatives, including functional and full-scale exercises [27] .",

The JCAHO further emphasised the importance of cooperation and communication between healthcare institutions and the develop-ment of a chain of command [10] . All nurses must demonstrate proficiency in their understanding of the principles of communication as well as of alternative approaches. Previous studies have shown that hospitals often exhibit poor communication and a lack of planning, motivation, empowerment, common language, disaster-trained staff, qualified and knowledgeable managers and emergency ICSs [39] . Moreover, nurses must know the structure of the ICS at the national, local and institutional levels [23, 29] , understand the roles of the command staff and comprehend how communication flows in the system. It is also imperative that nurses understand the decision-making process during times of disaster [37] .",

For proper decontamination to occur, nurses must be able to identify the essential equipment and use protective personal equipment properly [32] . Access to protective personal equipment, vaccinations and other resources increases the potential willingness of nurses to respond to a disaster [24, 34] . Moreover, nurses must be familiar with decontamination procedures and be capable of using the required equipment to protect both their own safety and the safety of patients. Willingness and competence are required for effective responses, such as were seen in the global responses to severe acute respiratory syndrome Previous studies also considered ethics in disaster as an essential knowledge area for all healthcare providers, including nurses. For instance, Walsh et al. [35] demonstrated that healthcare providers must be proficient in identifying and discussing the general ethical issues relating to the standards of care and resources during times of disaster. Having adequate knowledge and a full understanding of the principal ethical issues involved in disaster situations can prepare nurses to respond with confidence to related problems [28] . Considering ethics is important; as such, ethics should be included as a consideration in disaster nursing education, drills, research and planning [12] .",
