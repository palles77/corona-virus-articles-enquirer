Where the earliest exposure is not specified in the \"start source\" column, we noted that the case must have been exposed some time since the beginning of the outbreak (Dec 01, 2019). Where the last possible exposure is not given in \"end source\", we noted that exposure must have occurred before symptom onset. In the Singapore dataset, some cases had a travel history or contact with a known location or presumed source of the virus and this defined a most recent time of exposure. For these we proceed as in Tianjin. Other individuals had estimated exposure times based on the symptom times for their presumed infector. For these, we define an exposure window using the symptoms of their presumed infector \u00b14 days. Having defined exposure windows, we proceed with interval censoring as in the Tianjin data.

The ICC intervals are the time differences between the symptom onset in the putative index (PI) and the others, so the collection of times t j \u2212 t pi for each j in the cluster. These intervals are not samples of the serial interval distribution, because it need not be the case that the PI infected the others. Vink et al [17] used a mixture model in which ICC intervals t j \u2212 t pi can arise in four ways: (1) an outside case infects PI and j; (2) PI infects j; (3) PI infects an unknown who infects j and (4) PI infects unknown 1 who infects unknown 2 who infects j.",

Because the incubation period is different for early-and late-occurring cases in our data, on average transmission for early-occurring cases is 2.79 and 1.2 days before symptom onset (Tianjin, Singapore) and 8.2, 3.3 days before (Tianjin, Singapore) for late-occurring cases. The fact that serial intervals are shorter than incubation periods is robust in our sensitivity analysis (Table S3 ). These estimates are strengthened by the fact that we have estimated both incubation period and serial interval in the same population and by the fact that we obtain the same result in two distinct datasets. In both sets of estimates, samples of the incubation period minus serial interval are negative with probability 0.8 or higher (Tianjin) and 0.7 or higher (Singapore), suggesting that a substantial portion of transmission may occur before symptom onset (see Supplementary Information and Figure S2 ), consistent with the clinical observations reported by Rothe et al.

We find differences in estimated incubation period between early and later cases; this may be due to presymptomatic transmission or differences in reporting and/or in perceived exposure as the outbreak progressed, in the context of social distancing measures. Finally, our shorter serial intervals lead to an estimate of the basic reproduction number of approximately 2 in both datasets, suggesting that stopping half the transmission events may be sufficient to control outbreaks.",
