Higher profit margins on processed foods have promoted the creation of 'obesogenic' environments, which through progressively integrated global food systems have been increasingly 'exported' to developing nations.

However, limited consideration was given to these areas. These two globalization mechanisms (trade and urbanization) play a role in the increasing levels of exposure to all four risk factors, essentially serving as new vectors for the spread of NCDs. This article will begin with an examination of the current literature supporting pathways between trade and investment, urbanization, unhealthy diet, and NCDs. This is followed by a descriptive analysis of trends in investment, trade, the food environment and NCDs in four Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) countries: Cameroon, Kenya, Nigeria, and South Africa. The conceptual framework utilized in this paper is then explored further through the testing of a model connecting urbanization, trade and investment, overweight and obesity, and deaths attributable to NCDs, specifically cardiovascular disease (CVD), in forty-eight SSA countries, using structural equation modelling. While tobacco has been included as a control variable in the analytical sections, the focus remains on unhealthy diet, via overweight and obesity pathways, to CVD, given the rapid emergence and complexity of the global diet. The findings will be considered within the current context of global health policy discourse around healthy diets and NCDs, the potential role for practitioners and the World Trade Organization (WTO) in a health in all policies mandate, and the current World Health Organization (WHO) Global Action Plan (GAP) on NCD reduction. This paper aims to demonstrate the substantial role of globalization processes in changing the built food environment and the consequent increase in metabolic risk factors for NCDs in the developing world. It is fundamental at the outset to note that there is no one reality for SSA countries; stage of development, rural-urban divisions, and dietary habits vary widely across the region, as will be demonstrated in the trend analysis. Thus, any conclusions must be retained at the SSA regional level; extrapolating to any one SSA nation would require careful consideration of individual nuances.",

            "text": "Tiffen 9 provides the fullest description of the links between agriculture, globalization, and urbanization. At the beginning of a country's agricultural development, food is produced almost solely for household or family use, with high labour to output ratio. With most of the population engaged in the same task there were no markets for agricultural goods, and thus no incentives to produce a surplus. However, as nonagricultural sectors are created and cities spring up, the motivation to grow a surplus in exchange for consumer goods develops. In the case of SSA, in a highly developed and globalized era, the agricultural sector was able to access new production that included an emphasis on export cash crops. In addition, the acquisition of new capital to substitute machinery for labour accelerated urban drift; growing the demand for an agricultural surplus. The absolute and relative population in the agricultural sector is continuing to decline, ultimately leading to larger, more capital-intensive farming schemes. This cycle of agricultural intensification and reduced human input has contributed to rural-urban migration patterns; escalating urbanization rates. While further historical accounts of these pathways are needed, Tiffen's accounts are instructive.",

            "text": "Rural-urban inequality is neither a new concept, nor a uniquely African phenomenon. 12, 13 An examination of 24 SSA countries revealed that living standards for rural residents are almost universally lower than for their urban counterparts. 14 That said, there are growing concerns regarding rising urban poverty in developing countries, with urbanization becoming synonymous with slum growth. 15, 16 One estimate has suggested that 65% of the SSA population reside in slums 10 ; while UN Habitat has proposed that more than 70% of the urban population have inadequate access to housing, water supply, and sanitation. 17 A 2013 World Bank report demonstrated that the development of mega cities was associated with faster economic growth, but higher income inequality. 18 The very existence of a global food industry has vastly changed what types of foods have become available. The overriding responsibility of transnational food corporations (TFCs) to their stakeholders requiring that they maximize investor returns, usually by increasing profits, gives industry only two options; push more product or improve profit margins. 19, 20 The most profitable items in this industry are highly processed products, including fast food, snacks, and beverages that are made up of large amounts of starch, sugars and low-quality fats. 19 Furthermore, it is also reasonable to assume that brands cannot easily be built up around fruits and vegetables, thus items such as the \"Big Mac\", \"Whopper\", or \"Blizzard\", become favourable for their capacity to be personalized and build brand loyalty in emerging markets. Healthy food as a 'bad' global commodity and unhealthy food as a 'good' global commodity (branding, long shelf life, valueadded processing) have become the prevailing paradigm. Thus, the two revenue streams of TFCs, more product and more profitable products, have contributed to rising rates of overweight and obesity worldwide. 21 The three fundamental areas of food securityavailability, access, and utilisationdiffer between the urban and rural context and across urban socio-economic groups. 22 In the urban context, processed foods are more affordable and require less time and energy to prepare than traditional foods, shifting the diet of the urban poor towards processed and imported foods 23, 24 which contain increased amounts of fat, sugar, salt, and preservatives. 22 One study in Tanzania demonstrated that while sweet potatoes, cassava, and papaya were the most commonly reported foods in the rural diet, the urban diet consisted primarily of bread, cookies, vegetable oil, beef and milk. 25 This finding has been corroborated in more recent studies, providing additional evidence that within urban environments traditional diets are being abandoned in favour of a more Western diet 26, 27 ; however, there is evidence for an increasingly Westernized diet in some rural areas as well. 28 Rural-urban migration contributes to the transition from reliance on the ability to produce food, to reliance on the ability to purchase food. For example, in Mozambique, those in metropolitan areas purchased 92% of their food, while those in rural areas purchased only 29% of the food they consume, Malawi has similar statistics, with 91% in metropolitan areas and 36% in rural areas 29 These patterns may vary in more economically developed SSA countries, such as South Africa. 28 The urban poor have barriers to accessing wholesale and discount supermarkets, often placed outside the city, due to a lack of personal or public transportation. 22 This requires them to purchase in small neighbourhood shops where prices are higher and there is a limited availability of meat and produce. Also due to a lack of available finances, storage capacity, and refrigeration they must purchase food in smaller quantities, prohibiting them from savings on bulk purchases. 22 With busy urban lifestyles, increased time spent commuting to work, a growing number of women engaged in the workforce, and small living spaces ill-equipped for cooking, there are less time and space available for food preparation, thus pushing more urban residents to rely on cheap, preprepared convenience foods. 22 For example, slum-dwellers in Kenya consume more street food than those in low-middle income neighbourhoods, given the lure of low prices. 30 Temple and Steyn 31 demonstrated that the most economically efficient way for the urban poor in South Africa to meet their energy needs was through energy-dense foods, including rice, beans, breads, pastas, and snack foods. Furthermore, they approximated that a healthier diet cost 69% more than an unhealthy one, rendering it unaffordable for approximately 80% of the population. Consequently, due to changes in availability, accessibility, and utilization, urban dwellers, particularly the urban poor, are consuming diets of greater variety and energy intake, but ultimately lower in micronutrient quality, 22 generally leading to increased rates of overweight and obesity.",

Growth in FDI has outpaced growth in both GDP and trade in developing countries more than six-fold 32 ; in fact, it has become the primary source of external financing in developing countries. 33 China has been heavily pursuing investment in Africa, raising total FDI from $20 million in the early 1990s, to $100 million in 2000, and over $1 billion in 2006. 34 While data suggest that Cameroon, Tanzania, and Uganda are the largest African recipients of FDI into the food and drink sector, 35 acquiring detailed breakdowns of FDI by sector and host or home economy is immensely difficult.",

            "text": "The liberalization of trade and FDI has introduced measures that have the capacity to help or hinder improved food security in SSA. Under the World Trade Organization (WTO), treaties such as the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and the Agreement on Agriculture, can improve food availability through the reduction of import barriers, which help bring international food imports into the domestic market at lower prices. 36, 37 Alternatively, increasingly affordable imports may be paralleled by the conversion of traditional domestic production to export-oriented production, or 'cash crops'. This is due in part to the legacy of colonial influences that prioritized production of coffee, copra, cotton, sesame, peanuts, and sugar, for export to Western markets. 21, 38 Integration into global food markets deepened with the imposition of structural adjustment programs (SAPs), instituted primarily by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, targeted privatisation and liberalization as forms of expenditure-reduction and revenue-generating policies to restore economic balance and repay international loans. SAPs contributed to the reduced availability of traditional food crops, and increased exposure to a Western diet of refined sugars, wheat, and prepared food products which have been implicated time and again in the development of NCDs in SSA. 38 This dietary shift is also attributed to the continued agricultural export subsidies that allow developed countries to artificially suppress food prices making it difficult for domestic markets in developed countries to compete. 39 Increased quantities of cheap food imports and cash-crop exports create conditions of import-dependency and threaten short-and long-term food security. [40] [41] [42] Growing national food insecurity is illustrated by the rise in the number of developing countries that are now net food importers (from 74 in the 1995-1999 to 89 in the 2005-2009 periods). 43 Relative to trade, FDI may be exerting larger structural changes on the food environment in SSA through TFCs. Investment liberalization has allowed TFCs to grow both horizontally, through mergers and acquisitions of local corporations, and vertically, gaining control over all levels of the food system, such as production, processing, distribution, and retail. 44 TFCs are able to capitalize on locations with the most favourable cost, regulatory, political, and social structures. 45 Under the WTO's General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS), countries have the option to liberalize services incidental to agriculture, hunting, forestry, and fishing, and to open their wholesale trade services, retailing services, and franchising. The extent to which all SSA countries have liberalized these sectors, and/or provided limitations on market access and national treatment, is not explored in this paper. However, a brief look at South Africa is revealing. South Africa has fully liberalized the commercial presence of services related to agriculture, hunting, forestry, fishing, wholesale trade, retailing, and franchising, without stipulation regarding market access or national treatment. While direct causal relationships are difficult to demonstrate, the country's current obesity epidemic, with as much as 65.4% and 31.3% of their population reported to be overweight and obese, respectively, 46 may speak volumes to its adoption of the global food system.",

As well, there may be general benefits to the economy through growth of agricultural, manufacturing, distributing, and retail sectors, if done within the country, providing wages for the purchase of food. In the case of South Africa, researchers have found that although supermarkets have increased physical access to healthier foods, they have simultaneously increased economic access to unhealthy foods, charging between 30% and 110% less for unhealthy foods relative to healthy foods when compared on a price per calorie basis. 47 Additionally, evidence of South Africa's 'sub-imperialist' actions across Africa, that is, its role as a key African nation facilitating imperialist expansion 48 can be seen in the rapid expansion of grocery retail into large parts of SSA. 49 As of 2010, four South African supermarkets held over half of the retail share of the food market in South Africa, 50 two of which (Shoprite and Pick 'n Pay) had opened a cumulative 143 supermarkets as of 2003 across Botswana, Egypt, Lesotho, Malawi, Mauritius, Madagascar, Mozambique, Namibia, Swaziland, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. 49 The selective targeting of highly processed foods and the growing obesity epidemic warrant a closer look at the relationship between FDI and diet-related health outcomes.",

The former involves changing cultural expectations and taste preferences around food 21, 51 ; while the latter involves a tactic known as glocalization: adapting products to a subset of consumer preferences. 52 Marketing and advertising are essential to the growth of TFCs in foreign markets; in recognition of this the United States food industry spends over $30 billion a year on advertising and promotions, more than any other industry, including tobacco. Not surprisingly, advertising dollars directed at developing countries are on the rise. 21 A growing concern around trade, and particularly, investment agreements, involves the diminishing policy capacity at the national state level. Many developing nations, especially low-income countries (LICs), rely heavily upon tariffs for tax revenues. Pressure in trade treaty negotiations to remove and lower tariffs can result in reduced government revenues, with most LICs and some middle-income countries unable to compensate for these tariff losses due to weak tax regimes, a large informal (untaxed) employment sector, 40 and reliance on regressive VAT (consumption) taxes that, in SSA, are now as high as they can realistically be pegged. 53 In the end, tariff reductions can decrease funding and diminish regulatory capacity for public health and education institutions, key sectors in offsetting the negative consequences of an unhealthy food environment.",

Of particular concern is the growing number of Bilateral Investment Promotion and Protection Agreements (BIPAs). South Africa has presently signed 22 BIPAs, all of which contain an investor-state dispute settlement clause, allowing foreign private investors to initiate arbitration if they believe their investment has been expropriated by new public legislation or regulation. While expropriation is customarily allowed for a public purpose, under BIPAs this would require compensation. Important here is that expropriation includes regulatory measures enacted by the state in the protection of public interest which may diminish the value of their investment. This raises numerous concerns regarding the regulation of the food industry and the potential for lawsuits surrounding lost profits if, for example, nations were to ban the sale of processed food items in school cafeterias. A full exploration of the BIPAs, beyond the scope of this paper, is nonetheless necessary for a more complete understanding of the potential ramifications for the food industry in SSA, and to provide guidance to those countries considering future investment agreements.",

SSA, with some notable exceptions such as South Africa, is only beginning to enter the nutrition transition (a diet made up of progressively more energy-dense foods, high in fat, salt, and sugar). Studies of Nigeria, Kenya, and South Africa, have all consistently demonstrated higher rates of obesity in urban, relative to rural, populations, with urban women having the highest prevalence in all three countries. 54, 55 This finding supports the link between urbanization, an increasingly processed diet, and rising obesity rates.",

Information on caloric availability was sourced from the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations' food balance sheets. To avoid any large annual variations unrepresentative of overall trends, data were averaged across three year time- points.

            "text": "Despite some fluctuations, between 1995 and 2009 Cameroon has experienced rising levels of inward FDI, although its FDI outflows appear to be on a downward trend since the early 2000s (see Fig 2) . An examination of its food imports and exports provides a clear picture of Cameroon as a net food importing country, with import levels rising rapidly in all categories between 1995 and 2012, with the exception of meats, and vegetables and fruit (see Fig 3A) . In regard to vegetables and fruit, Cameroon is a net exporter, with export levels on the rise. Where people are purchasing their food is changing; grocery retailers' sales have climbed from approximately $2.98 billion in 2001-03 to $5.49 billion in 2010-12 (see Fig 4) . Cameroon has seen an increase in total calories available daily per capita, up from 2064 in 1995-97 to 2451 in 2007-09 (see Fig 5) . The majority of their dietary calories are still available from cereals and roots, with animal and vegetable oils generally increasing; suggesting they are only beginning to enter the nutrition transition. Fig 6 demonstrates that Cameroon's overweight and obesity prevalence is also rising, with recent rates as high as 33.2% and 12.6%, respectively. This trend, coupled with the knowledge that 22% of Cameroon's population is classified as undernourished, 62 suggests that the food supply reaching the population may be of poor nutritional quality, and/or diminished in caloric value. Cameroon struggles with food affordability, such that the average household spends 52.3% of their total household expenditures on food, well above the global average of 38.8%. 62 While mortality rates due to diabetes mellitus, ischaemic heart disease, and cardiovascular disease appear to be declining over time (see Fig 7) , in 2008 NCDs accounted for approximately 31% of all mortality. 46 Kenya Kenya has experienced rising levels of both FDI inflow and outflow between 1995 and 2009, although FDI into the country soared starting in the 2007-09 (see Fig 2) , largely due to privatization sales in the telecommunications and railway industries. 63 In the categories of beverages, fish and seafood, meats, and vegetables and fruit, Kenya exports considerably more product than they import, while the opposite is true for cereals and sugar products (see Fig 3B) . Kenya has seen similar increases in grocery retailers' sales as Cameroon, up from $3.8 billion in 2001-03 to $5.2 billion in 2010-12 (see Fig 4) . Their total calories available daily per capita have fluctuated, although with little change overall between 1995-97 and 2007-09 (see Fig 5) . The Kenyan diet consists primarily of cereals with low dietary diversity. 62 Fig 6 demonstrates that Kenya has seen small increases in their overweight and obesity prevalence, with recent rates at only 14.5% and 1.2%, respectively. Kenya has had a continued struggle with food security, such that 33% of their population remains classified as undernourished, 62 questioning the logic of exporting fish and meat products from a country with low availability of quality protein and an insufficient supply of food to feed their people. 62 Mortality rates due to ischaemic heart disease and cardiovascular disease are declining, while mortality rates attributable to diabetes are increasing rapidly (see Fig 7) ; in 2008 NCDs accounted for approximately 28% of all mortality. 46 Nigeria Nigeria has experienced consistently rising levels of inward FDI, while outflows have been negligible; the value of funds repatriated since the 2004-06 period has been less than their investments abroad (see Fig 2) . Nigeria is primarily a food importer, with food exports relegated to vegetables and fruit which are approximately on par with imports (see Fig 3C) . Nigeria has had immense growth in grocery retailers' sales, increasing from $10.1 billion in 2001-03 to $26.8 billion in 2010-12 (see Fig 4) . Furthermore they have considerably higher total calories available daily per capita than Cameroon or Kenya, growing from 2545 in 1995-97 to 2758 in 2007-09 (see Fig 5) . The Nigerian diet is dominated by cereals and roots with oils playing a growing role and, like Cameroon, the country is entering the nutrition transition. Fig 6 exhibits a growing overweight and obesity problem, with 2010-12 rates at 26.4% and 5.9%, respectively, up from 17.1% and 2.3% in 1995-97. Nigeria has a relatively small population classified as undernourished (6%), although with food consumption already at 64.7% of total household expenditure, one of the highest rates globally, and no food safety net programs in place, a large percentage of their population will be vulnerable to spikes in food prices. 62 NCD mortality rates attributable to diabetes, ischemic heart disease, and cardiovascular disease appear to be declining in Nigeria (see Fig 7) ; although they still accounted for approximately 27% of all mortality in 2008. 46 ",

Over the 1995-97 to 2009-12 period South Africa continued to increase its exports in beverages and fish and seafood, with small declines in sugar exports (see Fig 3D) . At the same time they increased cereal, dairy, and in particular, meat product imports. Of our four countries, South Africa has the highest annual grocery store retail sales, rising from $13.5 billion in 2001-03 to $43.6 billion in 2010-12 (see Fig 4) . Additionally, Fig 8 demonstrates that consumer food service sales are primarily accounted for through independent grocery retailers, followed by fast food chains, grocery store chains, restaurants (not falling into another category), cafes and bars, street stalls, and take-out/delivery food, all of which have been increasing to varying degrees. South Africa has the highest total caloric availability daily per capita, up from 2809 in 1995-97 to 3002 in 2007-09 (see Fig 5) . While their diet is still primarily cereals and roots, the larger role of oils, meats and fats, and sugars, demonstrates their advanced standing in the nutrition transition in SSA. Parallel to these findings, South Africa has some of the highest rates of overweight and obesity in the region; Euromonitor approximates that in 2010-12 32.7% and 22.7% of the population were overweight or obese, respectively. These estimates are considerably more conservative than the previously reported WHO estimates (65.4% and 31.3%), highlighting some of the data issues in the SSA region; however the Euromonitor estimates were kept for consistency within the trend analysis. That said, South Africa is a country of vast inequalities, with a Gini income coefficient of 0.631, where 1.0 represents maximal inequality and most OECD countries are around 0.3 or less. 64 South Africa's income inequality is the second highest worldwide just behind Lesotho at 0.632. 65 Not surprisingly, 27% of their population is classified as undernourished and, despite food affordability and availability being generally good on average, there are huge inequities in access. 62 Mortality rates due to NCDs appear to be stagnant or, in the case of diabetes mellitus, increasing (see Fig 7) ; NCDs accounted for approximately 29% of all mortality in 2008, 46 similar to three other country profiles.",

We ran two models, one with overweight and one with obesity, based on a large body of evidence supporting increased CVD mortality with increasing BMI categorization.

The second is the prevalence of tobacco smoking in the population, similarly to establish that the connection between the predictive factors in our model and CVD would exist while accounting for the impact of tobacco.",

SEM is generally a large data technique requiring sample sizes of anywhere between 100 to 200 cases. 71 However, as pointed out by Kenny, 72 this may be an unrealistic expectation when an upper limit exists on N, such as when the unit of analysis is a country. With the exception of three countries (R\u00e9union and Western Sahara due to insufficient data, and South Sudan due to its independence only occurring in 2011), all SSA countries were included in this model, almost achieving population saturation. Missing data were estimated using AMOS's full information maximum likelihood (FIML) estimation, which has been established to outperform common methods for handling missing data. 73 Numerous indices exist for assessing the model fit; based on the recommendation from Schreiber et al. 74 for single models without modifications, the Tucker-Lewis Index (TLI), the Comparative Fit Index (CFI) and the root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) will be reported. Hu and Bentler 75 have recommended the TLI and the CFI to exceed .95, and the RMSEA be below .06 to determine an acceptable fit. As is convention, we will also report the chi-square test (\u03c7 2 ) which measures the difference between the expected and the observed model; low \u03c7 2 values are desired with a probability level greater than 0.05 to indicate that the hypothesized model is not statistically significantly different from the observed data. AMOS does not produce standard errors when there are missing data, prohibiting the calculation of confidence intervals; although where the p-value is less than .05 (one-tailed), it can be inferred that zero would not be contained in the 95% confidence interval. The standardized regression weights (\u03b2), also known as path coefficients, are a form of effect size allowing direct comparison of the influence of independent variables on the dependent variable.

This suggests the presence of a net suppression effect, wherein a predictor variable (overweight and obesity) has a regression weight with an opposite sign to its correlation with the criterion variable (CVD). This can occur when a predictor variable shares considerable variance with one or more additional predictor variables, the predictor variable with the weakest relationship with the criterion variable will be the automatic recipient of the 'sign flip.' 76 In this case both overweight and obesity are correlated with tobacco, and exude the smallest effect on the proportion of CVD deaths. The direct effect of the KOF on CVD deaths may be smaller, but because it also acts indirectly through overweight, obesity, and tobacco, it does not get the 'sign flip'.",

Consistent with previous findings, 66-69 overweight and obesity had variable effects on CVD deaths, such that the direct effect of obesity on CVD death approached significance, while the effect from overweight was negligible.

In Canada for example, 25% of the population aged 15 years and over were smokers in 1999, and by 2011 this number was down to 17%. 77 However, between 1995 and 2011, 36.3% of Canadians increased their BMI, 78 reaching a national overweight and obesity prevalence rate of 52.1% in 2011. 79 In a similar vein, researchers in the United States reported that between the years of 1980 and 2000 there was a 43% reduction in deaths due to coronary heart disease (CHD), half of which could be attributed to medical therapies and the other half to a reduction in risk factors. However, they also estimated that the number of deaths due to CHD could have been reduced an additional 18% had it not been for the rising rates of obesity and diabetes. 80 Results from the trend analysis show that the levels of FDI inflows and grocery retail sales are increasing for all countries. The per capita access to daily caloric intake is rising, with the exception of Kenya, where it has largely remained stagnant. Data from all four countries examined revealed that they were rapidly increasing their imports in cereal/cereal products and sugar/sugar products/honey; major contributors to energy-dense, processed foods. While Cameroon, Kenya, and Nigeria appear to only be entering the nutrition transition, South Africa's caloric consumption patterns and obesity epidemic presage a bleak future for SSA countries following in its footsteps. The trend towards rising prevalence of overweight and obesity coupled with declining death rates attributable to NCDs, with the exception of diabetes mellitus, was surprising at first. Upon further reflection it seems highly probable that this finding could be accounted for by SSA's rapid population growth (2.7% annually 81 ). Data represented over the population, such as those presented here, i.e., the number of NCD deaths per 100,000 inhabitants, mean that growth in the numerator (total NCD deaths) must outpace growth in the denominator (total population), in order for such statistics to reveal change. Utilizing mortality as an endpoint, rather than morbidity, means that it will take some time for NCDs to cause death. Even assuming an aging population, the overall population growth (which still remains substantial in SSA) would have the effect of lowering mortality rates, unless the portion of people dying from NCDs outpaced the proportional rise in overall population. Importantly, this does not mean that the proportion of overall deaths due to NCDs is declining. Thus, future analyses may benefit from examining the change in percentage of deaths attributable to NCDs rather than the absolute numbers averaged over a growing population.",

This is a particularly concerning phenomenon in developing regions, such as SSA, entering a rapid nutrition transition, wherein fetal adaptations to an early nutrient-limited environment increases later life susceptibility to noncommunicable disease. 82 Future food security strategies must address equitable access to healthy caloric availability in SSA; an increased volume of calories alone is no longer sufficient for realizing global food security goals.",

It recommends the creation of policies to improve the availability, affordability and acceptability of healthier food products, particularly within public institutions, such as schools, other educational institutions and the workplace.

Additionally, global strategies such as the GAP-NCD have seemingly yet to acknowledge the potential for diminished capacity to act through regulatory strategies, such as those directed at the food industry, due to the protection provided to investors through international investment treaties. As has been suggested here, the growing number of bilateral and regional investment promotion and protection agreements raises serious concerns regarding the autonomy of the nation state to protect public health without facing retribution for expropriation of investment due to regulatory measures. Those committed to health-based public policy have thus had new challenges emerge; they now need to enhance their understanding of and participation in trade and investment treaties to ensure that sufficient capacity and space for effective public health regulation are protected.

While there may exist a theoretical foundation for the proposed pathways, crosssectional, ecological data preclude definitive assertions of causality. It is also possible that there were potentially important confounding variables omitted from the model that may better explain changing proportions of CVD deaths. That being said, we believe that there is a strong literature base supporting the inclusion of our selected variables. Additionally, there is a concern regarding the ability to access high-quality, comprehensive datasets on African nations. For example, the current data were limited to CVD mortality rates, an outcome that may take an excessive period of time to demonstrate change. Future work would benefit from examining non-fatal outcomes and morbidity statistics, such as diabetes prevalence, hypertension, or non-fatal cardiac events, if the data were to become available. Lack of transparency from TFCs and retailers, and inadequate monitoring of population consumption patterns make it difficult to directly assess changes in the food environment. A global effort to monitor changes in product-specific retail sales, marketing and advertising, FDI into the food manufacturing and processing industry, and other indicators of dietary change and nutrition transition will be imperative to policy efforts targeting unhealthy food environments. Improved longitudinal monitoring of NCD risk factors and outcomes in SSA, such as the work being conducted by the WHO's Global Burden of Disease group will permit development of more advanced models in future research.",

As demonstrated by the work in Canada and the United States, two countries that have been actively targeting the tobacco epidemic, the reductions they are achieving in CVD and NCD deaths through tobacco regulation are being offset or diminished by rising overweight and obesity epidemics.

This is not a new finding, as economic growth is known to change both food consumption patterns and exposure to new food products. What is compelling is the finding that global economic integration via trade and investment liberalization is also positively related to these outcomes, over and above economic growth. National and regional policy discussions, while informed by the WHO's GAP for NCDs, must also attend to the impact of trade and investment liberalization policies on intermediate risk factors, as well as the potential of such treaties to limit policy space for public health regulation. 83, 40, 84, 85 This requires careful analyses (health impact assessments) of present trade and investment treaties to ensure that governments in their NCD control programs fully utilize existing policy flexibilities within these treaties. These include using compulsory licensing or parallel importing for access to generic drug treatments, restricting in non-discriminatory ways imports of unhealthy food products while reducing tariffs on imports of healthy foods, reviewing investment treaties to ensure that intellectual property rights are not considered in the definition of 'investment' and considering, as is the case in South Africa, not renewing such investment treaties that may be expiring. It also means ensuring that any new trade or investment treaty is carefully drafted to protect policy space for future public health regulation. These are not activities that most physicians, and certainly cardiovascular specialists, are familiar with. However, most countries have active academic and civil society organizations attempting to move forward this agenda, which could benefit in their work from the support of the medical community. This support could extend to health professional participation in trade, policy and health policy forums convened by such governments or civil society groups and, in the latter case, consideration to some direct financial assistance for their work. At a minimum, physicians and specialists need to recognize that managing CVD risk requires far more than managing individual behaviour choices.",
