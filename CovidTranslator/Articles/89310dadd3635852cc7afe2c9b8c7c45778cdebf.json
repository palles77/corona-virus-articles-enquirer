RESULTS-6.5% of donor samples gave moderate neutralization of XMRV, but not control pseudotypes. However, further testing by Western blot revealed no evidence of antibodies against MLVs in any of these samples. Furthermore, no evidence of infectious virus or viral nucleic acid was observed.",

Initial studies found XMRV nucleic acids and/or proteins in prostate cancers 1,2 and even a low percentage of prostate tissues from individuals with no history of prostate cancer 2 . In contrast, several other studies have failed to detect XMRV in prostate cancer tissue 3, 4 . Much of this controversy is likely explained by PCR and other nucleic acid contamination 5, 6 . Despite XMRV originally being isolated from human prostate cancer samples 1 , it is in all likelihood a laboratory artifact, created by the passage of human prostate tissue through mice 7 . This resulted in infection with, and subsequent recombination between, at least two endogenous MLVs 7 . Cell lines created from this tissue, and harboring XMRV, were likely distributed to many laboratories working on prostate cancer.",

            "text": "The controversy surrounding the association between XMRV and chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), is, if anything greater. It was reported by Lombardi and colleagues that two-thirds of CFS patients from the U.S. harbored XMRV compared to 4% of controls 8 . Importantly, this work was based on three separate lines of evidence: i) direct and indirect nucleic acid detection in PBMC, stimulated PBMC and plasma; ii) culture of replication-competent XMRV from plasma and PBMC by co-culture with human prostate cells and iii) serological evidence using a flow cytometry assay. In addition to the association with CFS, the presence of virus in plasma and blood cells, coupled with the relatively high prevalence observed in apparently healthy controls suggested that XMRV may be both blood transfusiontransmitted and a real threat to the safety of the U.S. blood supply. However, many other groups failed to detect XMRV in PBMC samples from CFS or healthy individuals [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] . At least two studies tried to fully replicate the initial study using PCR, culture and serology, without any convincing evidence of XMRV in either CFS patient or healthy controls 14, 15 . Furthermore, more recent testing of specimens from the Lombardi et al study revealed some of the previously reported PCR-positive specimens were contaminated with XMRVcontaining plasmid sequences leading to the partial retraction of these PCR results from the Lombardi et al. publication 16 . Additionally, a recent multi-laboratory blinded study using 15 previously reported XMRV/MLV-positive subjects as well as validated negative controls, demonstrated that virus culture assays used in Lombardi et al. were prone to crosscontamination 17 . Thus, this leaves only the serological results as possible evidence for the presence of XMRV or other MLVs in humans. In the same multi-laboratory study 15 the assays used by Lombardi et al. detected a serological response in some specimens; however this reactivity was not consistent within replicates of the same plasma sample and no statistical association was observed in CFS patients compared to blood donors, while three other highly sensitive assays in the study failed to detect a serological response in any specimen 17 .",

            "text": "Micro-neutralization assays have been used extensively as diagnostic and specificity tests for many viruses, including alphaviruses and influenza 18, 19, 20 . Indeed, neutralizing antibodies are typically formed as part of a highly specific response to conformational epitopes. Neutralization of XMRV in 11/40 (27.5%) of serum samples was observed in prostate cancer patients 21 suggesting that a micro-neutralization assay for XMRV would be feasible and useful. In this study, we generated a micro-neutralization assay for studies of blood donors looking for serological evidence of XMRV/MLV infection based on the dual envelope pseudovirus (DEP) assay system we recently developed 22 , which has been proven to be a rapid, sensitive, and specific high-throughput system for antiviral drug discovery targeting viral entry. This assay system is composed of two viruses. Entry of the target virus is driven by the XMRV envelope protein pseudotyped onto the core of a reporter retrovirus, while infection by a second, internal control pseudovirus is mediated by an unrelated envelope and is included to reduce the number of false positives. Using this assay, we screened 354 donors, and identified a small number with a neutralization signature warranting further testing.",

We adopted a similar approach here for XMRV micro-neutralization assay. The assays were performed in 96-well plate format with the aid of liquid dispensing equipment for high-throughput applications. After preliminary experiments, a combination of MLV-luc(XMRV Env) and HIV-ren(Lassa GP), which showed no clear interference between the two envelopes, was chosen for the sera screening. This combination proved to give very robust and reproducible results. A combination of MLV-luc(XMRV Env) and HIV-ren(Lassa GP) from three 96-well plates indicated that the inter-plate coefficient of variation 43 was 8.2% and 5.2% for MLV-luc(XMRV Env) and HIV-ren(Lassa GP), respectively. A set of 20 sera samples indicated that for the intra-assays, the CV of every sample in triplicate was within 5% and for the inter-assays, the CV of every sample from three plates was within 12%, for both MLV-luc(XMRV Env) and HIV-ren(Lassa GP) (data not shown).",

WB is limited to the recognition of linear epitopes and is prone to high-background rates, while EIA can be restricted by the quality of the antigens, antibodies and detection methods. Instead of directly detecting the existence of antiviral antibodies in the sera, the DEP-based micro-neutralization assay is based on the ability of a serum to neutralize pseudovirus infection. Compared with standard assays such as EIAs, the micro-neutralization assay has fewer steps and can be performed by automated liquid handling equipment, which may generate less standard deviation.

In contrast, while we identified 23/354 blood donors (6.5%) able to moderately neutralize XMRV Env-mediated infection, control and other MLV envelopes were poorly or not at all neutralized. None of the samples tested showed any evidence of a serologic response to XMRV by WB testing. Furthermore, all 23 seroreactive samples were negative for XMRV and MLV sequences using PCR or virus culture. These PCR and culture assays were designed to detect a broad range of gammaretroviruses, as well as XMRV specifically, thus, excluding XMRV/MLV and other gammaretroviruses as a source of the non-specific reactivity. The finding that neutralization by the 23 blood donors was specific to XMRV envelopes, but not other MLV envelopes was surprising. Pairwise comparison of the amino acid (aa) sequence of the envelope region between XMRV, and MLV-P or MLV-E shows the aa similarity is about 89% and 68% respectively.",

This could be cross-reactive antibodies raised against endogenous retroviral elements, completely unrelated proteins, or other non-antibody serum factors. Human serum potently inhibits XMRV 14 , however, this is largely complement-driven, and in our assay serum complement was inactivated by heating and did not influence our test results. The relatively high level of non-specificity is greater than that seen with other microneutralization assays 20, 49 , and is partly due to the lack known of human positive cases that can be used in order to accurately set cut-offs for defining specific neutralization. Our results likely also explain other reported XMRV neutralization results in human samples 21 .",

However, it is likely that, as with our micro-neutralization assay, mammalian cell culture-based expression of an unrelated retrovirus Env would be highly prone to non-specific cross-reactivity that can confound the testing and which requires clarification by WB analysis using purified antigen. Indeed, when the Lombardi et al. flow-based assay was used by two laboratories on plasma specimens in a blinded study, high levels of non-specific reactivity was observed 15 .",

            "text": "In conclusion, we developed a robust, high-throughput micro-neutralization assay in order to conduct studies looking for evidence of infection with XMRV and MLV. Although a small proportion of blood donors demonstrated the ability to block XMRV-mediated infection, we found no evidence that this inhibition was mediated by specific antibodies elicited by exposure to XMRV or related MLVs. It is likely that this moderate neutralization is mediated through another, non-specific mechanism. Our findings also explain further the highly non-reproducible and non-specific serological responses detected with other assays 8, 17 . In addition, this micro-neutralization assay system can be easily adapted to screen donor samples against other viruses with careful selection of matching partner virus envelopes, which will provide important information for neutralizing antibody responses and infectious disease profiles. Shown is an example screen of 80 donor serum samples (80-fold dilutions) for XMRV neutralization with virus combinations of MLV-luc(XMRV Env) and HIV-ren(Lassa GP) in a 96-well plate format. Three (B37, B58, and B80) out of a total of over 80 donor sera showed approximately 50% reduction in XMRV Env-, but not Lassa GP-, mediated viral infection in 293T/17 cells. A representative result of 12 donor samples is shown with positive controls containing 1 to 100 copies/\u03bcl of a plasmid harboring a cloned fragment of XMRV gag 37 and negative water controls. First round PCR amplification used primer pair 419F and 1154R and second round PCR amplification used primer pairs Gag-I-F and Gag-I-R, or NP116 and NP117. GAPDH RNA and DNA PCR results for the same samples are shown in the bottom two panels.",

            "text": ", a second publication by Lo and colleagues40 , based only on PCR analysis, also yielded a strong association between CFS and MLV-like viruses40 . These subsequent viruses demonstrated a far greater degree of sequence variation than XMRV, with the majority of sequences resembling polytropic MLV (P-MLV). Although Lo et al. reported very stringent measures to minimize contamination 40 , the most parsimonious explanation, given the extent of reported contamination of laboratory reagents, is that their PCR results are false positives resulting from reagent contamination. Indeed, Lo et al. used Platinum Taq (Invitrogen) for PCR amplification, which several groups have convincingly demonstrated is contaminated with mouse DNA 14,15,50 due to the use of a mouse monoclonal antibody in the enzyme mix. Furthermore, recent detailed phylogenetic analysis of the longitudinal polytropic MLV sequences reported by Lo et al. showed that these sequences are inconsistent with retroviral evolution 51 . Nonetheless, the findings of Lo et al. raised the hypothesis that while XMRV itself is clearly a laboratory contaminant, the serological responses detected in Lombardi et al. may be due to infection by other MLVs or gammaretroviruses. The serological assay used by Lombardi et al. relies on antibody binding to the MLV spleen focus-forming virus (SFFV) Env expressed on the surface of cells.",
