Such reductions following implementation of screening have been well documented (Peto et al, 2004; Bray et al, 2005) . In Taiwan, Pap smear screening was initiated in December 1974 when the Cancer Society of the Republic of China together with gynaecological clinics offered free Pap tests in 1974 Pap tests in -1984 Although the programme was advertised through the mass media, only 2.4% of women in the first and 4.5% of women in the second 5 years were screened (Chou and Chen, 1989) . The National Labor Insurance began to reimburse the Pap test for all women working in the private and public sectors in 1991, and the national screening programme reimbursed by the National Department of Health was implemented in 1992 with an aim to reimburse Pap tests for 2% of the women population. The National Health Insurance was launched in 1995 (Wen et al, 2008) , when it started to reimburse annual Pap tests for all women aged 30 years or more (Koong et al, 2006) . Annual participation gradually increased from 9.4% in 1995 to 27.5% in 2007. But the triennial participation was only 51.0% during 2005 -2007, which was lower than those in most regions with organised screening programme. All Pap tests are mandatory to register in the National Cervical Cancer Screening Registry in Taiwan. Any eligible woman who has not attended for screening for more than 3 years is urged to attend the screening by public health nurses of local health centres. Any screened woman affected with a high-grade squamous intraepithelial or worse lesion is personally interviewed by public health nurses to check whether she has received any biopsy, follow-up Pap test, and treatment.",

The age-adjusted incidence of invasive cancer and carcinoma in situ rapidly reduced in 2003 and rebounded in 2004 might be due to reduction in screening and confirmatory diagnosis of cervical cancers because of the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome in 2003 in Taiwan.",

A recent study of cervical adenocarcinoma incidence in 13 European countries (Bray et al, 2005) found a decline in the United Kingdom, Denmark, and Sweden in the 1990s, primarily among women aged 30 years or more, and an increase in other countries. Improvements of Pap smear technique, such as the extended tip spatula or the endocervical brush, have aided general practitioners to collect inner cervix cells (Buntinx and Brouwers, 1996) . However, the reduction in cervical adenocarcinoma incidence was not observed in all regions where extended tip spatula was generally used (Visioli et al, 2004) . The awareness of adenocarcinoma in situ as precancerous lesions facilitated early detection of malignant lesions (Mitchell et al, 2004) with consequently increased incidence of adenocarcinoma. In Taiwan, the incidence of cervical adenocarcinoma increased for several years after the screening programme was implemented, and then reduced slightly. Whether this significantly reduces cervical adenocarcinoma incidence needs a longer time to determine. 1991 1992 1993 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 80 ",
