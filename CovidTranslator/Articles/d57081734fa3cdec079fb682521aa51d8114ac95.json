Among the various fields of transplantation, none has sparked greater excitement and none greater controversy than xenotransplantation. This chapter will consider the various applications that have been proposed for xenotransplantation, as it is these from which the excitement derives. The chapter addresses the hurdles that prevent the application of xenotransplantation for the treatment of disease today, particularly those hurdles stemming from the immune response of the recipient to the graft. It is from these hurdles and the possibility that xenografts might serve as a vehicle for transfer of infectious organisms between species that the controversy derives.",

            "text": "Although various types of xenografts were contemplated and even tried during all of history, xenotransplantation was first undertaken in the early years of the 20th century for the treatment of renal failure. Experimental surgeons had recently devised the vascular anastomosis as a way of connecting the cut end of blood vessels, and that advance created the field of vascular surgery. The vascular anastomosis would allow the repair of traumatic wounds and the penetration of surgery deeper into body cavities. However, those who developed the procedure realized the vascular anastomosis might also prove to be the critical technical advance needed to replace a sick organ with a healthy one, i.e., for organ transplantation. 1 As exciting as the prospect of organ replacement seemed to be, it was not clear then how one could obtain an organ from a human for transplantation. It was reasoned then that since some cellular components of the kidney and other organs often remain alive long after a person is deceased, harvesting a kidney from a cadaver would be unethical. Because of this concern, the first application of the vascular anastomosis to replacement of organ function was conducted using animals -swine and sheep -as a source of organs instead of humans. The most important reason for interest in xenotransplantation today is to provide a plentiful source of organs, in lieu of human organs, for transplantation. By some estimates, the number of human organs available for transplantation equals as little as 5% of the number needed. 2 In the case of the kidney and liver, this shortage may be blunted by the use of living donors. However, for reasons discussed below, the demand for organ transplantation may soon increase further, and dramatically so.",

When a virus causes organ failure, xenotransplantation might be preferred to avoid infection of the transplanted organ. This approach has already been attempted for treatment of cirrhosis caused by hepatitis virus and loss of immune competence caused by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). A xenograft (or at least a xenogeneic organ) might be used as a temporary measure to preserve life or health until healing occurs (or until a human organ becomes available). Thus, the blood of subjects with fulminant hepatic failure has been through swine livers as a way of improving the subject's condition so that the patient could undergo allotransplantation. Xenografts might be used to deliver genes or gene products for complex metabolic pathways, exploiting the ability to express heterologous genes at high levels in genetically engineered animals. Xenografts (human-toanimal) have even been advanced as systems that might coax the differentiation of stem cells into functional tissues and organs. 3 Unfortunately, despite the many potential uses and the long history of interest in xenotransplantation, daunting biological barriers presently prevent widespread application of xenotransplantation. These barriers include the graft injury caused by the immune response of the recipient against the graft, physiological incompatibilities between the transplant APPLiCAtions for XenotrAnsPLAntAtion and the recipient, and the possibility that the graft might transfer an infectious organism to the recipient. We shall consider all of these barriers, particularly the first.",

Activation of the alternative pathway of complement appears to provide a primary barrier to xenotransplants between many combinations of donor and recipient species. In some settings, however, for example in transplants of porcine organs into baboons or humans, the alternative pathway of complement is not spontaneously activated, presumably because factor H is functional across these species.

Despite the obvious advantages of administering complement inhibitors, this approach has several important limitations. First, the action of complement inhibitors is transient, whereas complement activation persists. Second, systemic inhibition of complement compromises host defense against infections. The alternative, and now standard, approach to controlling activation of complement is to express complement regulatory proteins of the recipient as the product of transgenes in the would-be source of xenografts. 6 For example, expression of human decay-accelerating factor, CD59, and membrane cofactor protein in transgenic pigs has led to prolonged survival of organs from those pigs transplanted into nonhuman primates. 5, 7 Xenoreactive natural antibodies All vertebrates capable of producing antibodies have at least some natural antibodies. These antibodies are called 'natural' antibodies because they are produced without a known history of sensitization with the corresponding antigen. Natural antibodies include polyreactive antibodies, which bind to many different and disparate types of antigens, and monoreactive natural antibodies, which mainly recognize one or a few saccharides.

Perhaps because of uncertainties about the importance of NK cells in the barrier to xenotransplantation, therapeutic strategies for inhibiting these cells have been discussed but so far have not been advanced.

To which extent and by what mechanism T cells recognize xenogeneic cells, however, have been matters of controversy. T-cell responses to xenogeneic cells appear to be defective when evaluated in vitro because cytokines and co-stimulatory molecules produced by xenogeneic antigen-presenting cells (APCs) act poorly on responding T cells. However, xenogenic APCs can present foreign MHC antigen to T cells, presumably through the use of alternative co-stimulatory pathways and cross-reactive properties of T-cell receptors. T cells may also respond in vitro to foreign peptides presented by self-APC. Although the nature and intensity of T-cell responses to xenotransplantation are still not completely known, the response is likely to be at least as intense as the response to allotransplantation, owing to the diverse set of antigenic peptides, an amplifying effect of humoral immunity and inflammation on cellular immune responses, and defective immune regulation. 14",

Such interest should stem from xenotransplantation as an experimental model. Thus, today, one can find no better or more rigorous model than a xenograft for testing the efficacy of therapeutics for the complement or coagulation systems. Furthermore, xenografts have provided very powerful models for elucidating the mechanism of complement-mediated injury, the pathophysiology of endothelial cell activation, and the biological phenomenon of accommodation. 6 Finally, xenografts have begun to teach unexpected lessons, such as the developmental implications of cell fusion and mechanisms of transfer of viruses between species. 18 \ufffd referenCes \ufffd ",

Fusion of a cell infected with a virus with an uninfected cell allows the virus (dark black bar) from infected cell (blue) to enter the genome of uninfected cell (red) by nuclear fusion. When the virus is activated and buds from the 'infected' cell, it acquires surface proteins from the uninfected fusion partner (red) and is thus capable of infecting other similar cells by viral entry. When nuclear fusion allows a virus of one species to enter the genome of another species, mutation and translocation of chromosomes may facilitate the generation of novel viruses.
