To gain insight into the host immune mechanisms developed upon PCV2 infection, early innate and adaptive immune responses were examined in 1-week-old, caesarean-derived, colostrum-deprived piglets using a subclinical infection model of PCV2 in combination with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) as a potential immunostimulation factor. The use of LPS did not show any significant effect on the course of PCV2 infection, nor did in the evolution of the immunological parameters evaluated. Ex vivo responses were detected as early as 1 day post-infection (PI) and consisted of an elevation of the plasmatic levels of interleukin (IL)-8 in PCV2-inoculated pigs followed by an increase on plasmatic IFN-a at day 5 PI. Regarding IL-10, only one PCV2-inoculated pig was positive (day 7 PI); this pig was the only one in which viremia persisted until the end of the study. In vitro cytokine determination showed that, regardless of the treatment administrated to the pigs, an IL-10 release was observed when peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) cultures were stimulated with PCV2. Seroconvertion to PCV2 measured by an immunoperoxidase monolayer assay (IPMA) occurred between 7 and 14 days PI, whereas neutralizing antibodies (NA) did not appear until day 29 PI. PCV2 DNA was first detected in serum at day 7 PI, reaching the peak of viremia between days 14 and 21 PI, followed by a drop in viral load that was found coincident with the appearance of PCV2-specific IFN-g-secreting cells (PCV2-IFN-g-SC) and NA. Results from the present work suggest that viral clearance might be mediated by the development of PCV2-IFN-g-SC in contribution to the PCV2-specific NA.",

            "text": "Several studies have suggested the interaction between PCV2 and the immune system as a key event in the pathogenesis of PMWS. PCV2 infects monocytic-lineage cells (Gilpin et al., 2003; Rosell et al., 1999; Vincent et al., 2003) , and its long-lasting persistence within macrophages and dendritic cells (DC) has been suggested as a potential mechanism of dissemination for PCV2 throughout the body . In addition, PCV2 impairs the ability of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) to respond to mitogens (Darwich et al., 2003a ) and viral DNA has been shown to block the activity of natural interferon-producing cells (NIPC) to produce IFN-a, which in turns affects the ability of these cells to mediate antiviral responses upon the infection (Vincent et al., 2007) . Besides, PCV2 has been demonstrated to induce IL-10 secretion in in vitro cultured PBMC (Darwich et al., 2003a; Kekarainen et al., 2008) , leading to down-regulation of other cytokines produced during recall antigen responses (Kekarainen et al., 2008) . The authors of these latter studies suggested the involvement of IL-10 in the suppressed Th 1 responses observed during the course of PMWS. This hypothesis is also supported by other works performed on blood samples of PCV2-experimentally inoculated pigs, in which the elevation of IL-10 in plasma was correlated with either development of PMWS (Stevenson et al., 2006) or increased PCV2 load in serum (Darwich et al., 2007) . Altogether, these data suggest that the mechanisms used by PCV2 to counteract the host immune defences are likely to lie under the immunomodulatory activity of its viral components.",

Group A pigs were kept as uninoculated controls; group B animals were intraperitoneally inoculated with 50 mg/kg of LPS from Salmonella typhimurium (Sigma-Aldrich, L7261); group C pigs were inoculated with 10 5.2 TCID 50 of the Burgos strain of PCV2 (1 ml orally and 1 ml nasally) produced in PK-15 cells, and group D pigs received simultaneously PCV2 and LPS at the doses stated above. In order to study the events taking place at the early stages of infection, thirty-two piglets were sequentially necropsied within the first 8 days of the experiment. The remaining pigs were followed up throughout the experimental period, being bled at days 0, 7, 14, 21 and 29 post-inoculation (PI) for serum and PBMC collection.

Among them, the use of immunostimulants and co-infections following PCV2 infection is apparently the most successful strategy to experimentally reproduce clinical disease, suggesting the activation of the immune system as a potential triggering factor of PMWS (Tom\u00e1 s et al., 2008) . In the present study, the effect of immunostimulation on the course of PCV2 infection was evaluated in 1-week-old CDCD piglets by injecting them with LPS, simultaneously to PCV2-oronasal inoculation. Although LPS was claimed to have a positive effect on PCV2 replication in pulmonary macrophages (Chang et al., 2006b) , our data showed no significant effect of LPS on the evolution of PCV2 infection (Fernandes et al., 2007) and the immunological parameters evaluated throughout the experiment. These results might suggest that the LPS-induced viral replication reported in vitro does not apparently occur in vivo, or not extensively enough to trigger PMWS under the present experimental conditions. Nevertheless, further studies such as the local effect of LPS on PCV2 target tissues should be performed to conclude that, since no significant induction of plasmatic pro-inflammatory cytokines attributed to LPS administration were detect.",

            "text": "Regarding the innate immune responses against PCV2, the earliest event detected following PCV2 infection was an increase in the plasma levels of IL-8 (day 1 PI). The ability of PCV2 to induce IL-8 production in porcine alveolar macrophages or PBMC has been previously reported (Chang et al., 2006a; Darwich et al., 2003a) and agrees with the inflammatory nature of the lesions usually seen in PCV2-infected animals. In the present study, other proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-1b or TNF-a were not detected in serum with a consistent pattern. However, the lack of detection of these cytokines in plasma does not exclude them from playing a role in early phases of the infection, since they could have been acting locally at the site of viral replication without reaching levels high enough to be detected in serum. In contrast, a clear IFNa response was observed in PCV2-inoculated pigs at day 5 PI. IFN-a is considered a crucial cytokine for the host antiviral defences, being involved not only in innate responses but also in regulating the adaptive immunity generated upon viral infections. Indeed, the ability to counter IFN-a-mediated responses through different pathways, and thereby interfere with the immune mechanisms of the host, has been reported for several viruses (Garcia-Sastre and Biron, 2006) . In the case of PCV2, recent studies showed that PCV2 or PCV2-CpG motifs may inhibit or induce IFN-a responses (Vincent et al., 2005; Wikstrom et al., 2007) depending on the cell subset studied and on the structure of CpGs. Vincent et al. (2007) reported that PCV2 was able to block IFN-a induction in NIPCs, suggesting the inmunomodulatory activity of PCV2 as a key event in the pathogenesis of PMWS. In this respect, those animals withstanding the infection without developing clinical disease should be able to counteract the inhibitory activity of PCV2, probably by means of strong innate responses. In the present study, the substantial amounts of IFN-a detected in plasma of all PCV2inoculated pigs at early stage of infection indicated that development of an early innate response against the virus was generated. The fact that no PCV2 genome neither PCV2-associated lesions were found in tissues of the early necropsied pigs might be attributed to the ability of PCV2 to persist in monocytic-lineage cells without active replication , and therefore being undetectable by a standard HIS technique. These results, together with the fact that PCV2 is known to mediate inhibition of NIPC responsiveness, suggest that the balance between the host ability to mount a proper innate antiviral response and the virus ability to dampen it might be determinant for the infection evolution and triggering of the disease.",

In contrast, in vitro results showed an induction of IL-10 release in response to PCV2 stimulation of PBMC, regardless of the treatment administrated to the pigs. The involvement of IL-10 in the pathogenesis of PMWS has been suggested in several studies. Darwich et al. (2003b) found an overexpression of IL-10 mRNA in thymus of PMWS-affected pigs in correlation with lymphoid lesions. Also, cytokine profile evaluation of blood samples from PCV2-experimentally inoculated pigs showed an association between elevated plasma levels of IL-10 and development of PMWS (Stevenson et al., 2006) . In vitro, PCV2 has been demonstrated to induce IL-10 secretion in PBMC cultures, which, in turns, lead to repression of other cytokines (Kekarainen et al., 2008) . Altogether, these data suggest that the ability of PCV2 to induce IL-10 might contribute to the immunosuppressive status observed in the course of PMWS. In our study, none of the pigs developed clinical disease and viremia decreased by day 29 in all pigs but one, in which viremia persisted until the end of the study (data not shown). Interestingly, this pig was the only one with detectable IL-10 in serum and also with one of the lowest IFN-a response generated. These results suggest that some pigs -those controlling the progression of the infection -might counteract the ability of PCV2 to induce an IL-10 release, most probably by means of strong IFN-a responses.",
