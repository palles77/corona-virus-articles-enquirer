Monoclonal antibody (mAb)-based immunotherapy is a promising strategy for disease control. Here we use a human Ab phage display library and H5 hemagglutinin (HA) ectodomain to select ten neutralizing mAbs (nAbs) with a remarkably broad range among Group 1 influenza viruses, including the H5N1 \"bird flu\" and the H1N1 \"Spanish flu\" strains. Notably, nine of the Abs utilize the same germline gene, VH1-69. The crystal structure of one mAb bound to H5N1 HA reveals that only the heavy chain inserts into a highly conserved pocket in the HA stem, inhibiting the conformational changes",

Pandemic influenza, which occurs when a new virus emerges and infects people globally that have little or no immunity, represents a grave threat to human health: for example, the 1918 \"Spanish Flu\" pandemic caused an estimated 50 million deaths2,3. Vaccines have historically been the mainstay of infection control. However, due to rapid antigenic drift, the vaccine antigen needs to be updated annually based on global influenza surveillance4,5, and it is not always fully successful. In addition, some recent H5N1 vaccines have shown promising results6-9, but none has been reported to elicit a broad neutralizing response in humans. Neuraminidase inhibitors, especially oseltamavir (Tamiflu), remain the primary antiviral treatment, but they have limited efficacy if administered late in infection, and widespread use is likely to result in the emergence of resistant viral strains10,11.",

Sequence and structural analysis of all 16 HA subtypes points to the existence of just two variants of this epitope, corresponding to the two classic phylogenetic groupings of HA (Groups 1 and 2). We therefore tested eight further Group 1 HA subtypes, and demonstrated a remarkable and unprecedented cross-subtype binding and/or neutralization spectrum. Since we had used a Group 1 subtype (H5) for our panning, our nAbs, as expected, failed to neutralize a Group 2 subtype, H7. These results nevertheless raise the possibility that a cocktail comprising a small subset of nAbs raised against representatives of the two groups could provide broad protection against all seasonal and pandemic influenza A viruses.",

We used H5 activated by cleavage of the single chain precursor, HA0, into two polypeptides, HA1 and HA2. Cleavage leads to the partial burial of the \"fusion peptide\" (the first ~21 residues of each HA2) into the stem19,21, which also contributes to the formation of each of three hydrophobic \"pockets\" located below the large trimeric receptor-binding head. In the complex, one F10 nAb binds into each pocket, burying ~1500 \u00c52 of protein surface. Only the heavy chain (VH) participates directly in binding, utilizing all three of its complementarity-determining regions (CDRs).

Phe55 lies across a flat hydrophobic surface formed by the main-chain of the fusion peptide, residues 18 2 -21 2 ; it also makes favorable orthogonal aromatic interactions23 with the side-chains of Trp21 2 at the back of the pocket, and His18 1 at the front (subscripts 1 or 2 refer to HA1 or HA2, and the numbering scheme follows the structure of H3 (pdb:2hmg)17,24).

In addition, free energy calculations26 point to dominant binding contributions (~70% of the total favorable free energy) of the three conserved residues in the VH segment (Fig. 5b) . In CDR-H2 derived from germline V1-69, position 55 is always Phe, and position 54 is always hydrophobic (M/I/L/V). In our nAbs, CDR-H3 always has a Tyr predicted to lie at the tip of the CDR3 loop (conserved at the 6th position). The conformation and sequence of the CDR1 loop does not seem to be critical, since the other Abs we isolated do not contain the somatic mutation (Gly26=>Glu) found in F10, and are predicted to have canonical structures. The sixth VH gene we isolated is derived from the germline gene, VH1-2; its H2 loop has the same length as VH1-69, but by virtue of a change from Ala to Arg at position 7222 it is predicted to adopt a distinct conformation (\"type 3\"), which presents loop residues 3 and 4 to the antigen (rather than residues 4 and 5 in type 2 loops). The specific somatic mutation at position 4, from Asn to Met, presumably promotes H5 binding. It is not possible to predict the structure of the larger H3 loop, but a tyrosine is located at the center of the loop that may play an analogous role to that in VH1-69.",

Our data point to this event occurring at an early step in the infectious process, although we cannot rule out the possibility that the nAbs act at a later stage, given the close packing of molecules on the surface of the mature virion which might restrict early access to the epitope. The only previously published crystal structure of an HA-nAb complex that inhibits membrane fusion utilizes a different mechanism: it prevents conformational changes by cross-linking the upper surfaces of adjacent subunits in the head31.",

It is straightforward to model the locations of the F10 epitope residues in this model of the fusogenic state (see Supplementary Note 1). All 8 epitope residues, which were fully exposed in the neutral pH structure, become either part of the new hydrophobic bundle core (Thr41 2 , Ile45 2 , Val52 2 and Ile56 2 ), or they make networks of H-bonds with the C-terminal arms and other elements that stabilize the new bundle (Lys 38 2 , Gln42 2 , Thr49 2 , Asn53 2 ).

As noted above, we repeatedly isolated nAbs that utilize the same VH germline gene (IGHV1-69 or \"VH1-69\"). Huang et al. 43 have pointed out that this is the only VH gene that consistently encodes 2 hydrophobic residues at the tip of its CDR-H2 loop; indeed, it is the only germline gene to encode a Phe at this position, which makes several critical interactions with H5. Moreover, the \"type 2\" H2 loop, which is long and compact, is only predicted to occur in 4 out of the ~50 human germline genes. These factors may explain at least in part the remarkable ability of nAbs derived from this germline gene to cross-react with viral epitopes: their unusual ability to bind to conserved hydrophobic pockets. Such pockets are likely to have an important function and for this reason they are often cryptic in the unactivated state of the antigen. For example, VH1-69 is the predominant gene utilized by a group of CD4-induced (\"CD4i\") nAbs raised against the HIV-1 surface glycoprotein, gp120, where the \"pocket\" is part of a conserved co-receptor binding site that is only exposed transiently upon binding to its primary receptor, CD443. Similarly, an antibody raised against the HIV gp41 trimeric \"inner-core\" fusion protein intermediate utilizes the hydrophobic tip of its VH1-69 CDR-H2 loop to insert into a conserved hydrophobic pocket that blocks further assembly to the fusion-competent 6-helix structure44. In vivo, B cells carrying the VH1-69 gene are the primary mediators of innate defense against HCV infection, generating antibodies against its membrane fusion glycoprotein, E245, although the epitope and mode of action have not been determined. Notably, as we found in the current study, VH1-69 is not the only germline that is suitable for achieving neutralization in a similar manner. Another recent example is a nAb against Ebola virus surface glycoprotein, KZ52, which uses the VH3-21 germline46. However, their common ability to lock viral envelope proteins into a non-fusogenic conformation offers support for the possibility of a general strategy for broad-spectrum and/or potent viral neutralization.",

Analysis of their data (Supplementary Note 3) indicates that the antibodies are also derived from the VH1-69 germline gene, and share other key characteristics, including the Met-Phe pair in CDR-H2 and a tyrosine at the tip of CDR-H3. Thus it would appear, at least in this case, that our non-immune (H5-naive) donor library approach generated antibodies with characteristics very similar to those found using immunized-donor-based phage-display libraries derived from H5N1 survivors.",

It is unlikely that the F10 epitope provokes self-tolerance mechanism(s) via auto-antigen mimicry48 (Supplementary Note 5). Rather, we hypothesize that an immunodominant Ab response to the highly-exposed globular head may overwhelm the Ab response to the F10epitope, although it remains possible that other immune exclusion mechanism(s) may preclude natural Ab responses against the F10 epitope. It is not surprising that many viruses are highly adept at keeping their most critical (and conserved) determinants of pathogenesis cryptic, in which case subunit-based vaccines, utilizing properly presented fragments of F10 or F10-like epitopes, may offer distinct advantages over whole-virus-based approaches for the induction of broad spectrum nAbs in vivo49, 50. In summary, we have used in vitro methodologies to isolate a family of high affinity broadspectrum human nAbs against HA that show potent in vitro and in vivo efficacy against both highly pathogenic H5N1s and H1N1s. We show that they inhibit the post-attachment fusion process by recognizing a highly conserved epitope within the stem region of HA at a point where key elements of the conformational change are brought into close apposition. Our initial experiments suggest that this region is recalcitrant to the generation of escape mutants. The prospects for their use for passive immunotherapy would therefore seem to be excellent, either alone or in combination with small molecule inhibitors (Supplementary Note 6). Finally, our structural work pinpoints the reasons why Group 2 HAs do not bind the nAbs described here: despite surface sequence similarities, they form a structurally distinct group, but one that is also highly conserved and therefore may be amenable to a similar panning discovery approach.",

The structure was solved at 3.2 \u00c5 resolution by molecular replacement with PHASER using the structures of H5 (A/Vietnam/1194/04; PDB code 2IBX) and a homology model of F10 based on the structure of SARS nAb 80R (PDB code 2GHW)53,54 as starting models. The asymmetric unit contains two H5 trimers and three F10 molecules per trimer, and was refined using REFMAC555 with simulated annealing in CNS55 and manual rebuilding with Coot56 and Xtalview57. The final maps are of high quality, and key features such as the F10 CDR loops and interfacial residues are unambiguous and consistent in the 6 copies. The final model includes 503/503/503/497/497/497 residues for the 6 independent copies of H5, 235/235/236/233/234/234 residues for the 6 F10scFvs, 24 N-acetyl-D-glucosamine and 6 \u03b2-D-mannose units, but no water molecules. The R FREE is .29 with excellent geometry as assessed with PROCHECK58 and Rampage ( Table 1) : percentage of residues in favored, allowed and outlier regions are 90.0%, 9.5%, and 0.5%, respectively.",

One monomer has HA1 (yellow) and HA2 (blue) colored differently; the path of FP through the epitope (red) is outlined, while mutations not affecting binding are in cyan (see Fig. 4d ). The fusion peptides (FP and FP') are labeled in both monomers. Epitope residues are labeled white (HA2) or yellow (HA1), the position of buried residue H111 2 is shown as a black ball labeled \"H\". (d) Binding of the 3 nAbs to H5 mutants in the \u03b1A helix. Note the very similar response to all mutants tested. Mutations were made either to alanine or to the corresponding H7 residue. 293T cells were transiently transfected with mutants; 24 hours after transfection, nAbs or ferret anti-H5N1 serum were used to stain the transfected cells. Mean fluorescent Intensity (MFI) was normalized against ferret anti-serum (100%) to account for different expression levels. Circles below residue numbers indicate estimated contribution to the binding energy at each position: strong=red, intermediate=yellow; neutral=blue. Residues without a circle are not directly involved in the epitope but are discussed in the text. Colored highlighting on the sequences indicates conservation within clusters and groups, with orange indicating high conservation/invariance. Other colors (eg. yellow, cyan, pink) highlight residues that are cluster/subtype specific. The network of inter-helical contacts that stabilize the fusogenic structure60 are indicated below the HA2 sequences. Subtypes that can be recognized/ neutralized by F10 are indicated with \"+\" on the far right. \"(+) or (-)\" indicates a predicted positive/negative binding.
