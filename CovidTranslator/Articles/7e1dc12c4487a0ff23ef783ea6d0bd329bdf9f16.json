            "text": "Most secretory and membrane proteins contain carbohydrate moieties covalently attached through an amide linkage to asparagine residues. This has been shown to occur through the en bloc trasfer of a preformed oligosaccharide from a lipid-linked donor to specific glycosylation sites containing the required Asn-X-Ser(Thr) acceptor consensus sequence (for reviews, see Hubbard and Ivatt, 1981; Kornfeld and Kornfeld, 1985; Struck and Lennarz, 1980) . The mature lipid-linked oligosaccharide, 1 containing a Glc 3 Man 9 GlcNAc 2 structure ( Fig. 1) , is transferred cotranslationally to the nascent polypeptide chain on the luminal face of the rough Fig. 1 . Processing of Asn-linked oligosaccharides to a representative biantennary complex structure. The scheme depicts the processing from the transfer of Glc 3 Man 9 GlcNAc 2 from its dolichol pyrophosphoryl derivative to the nascent polypeptide chain still bound to the ribosome, followed by processing reactions in the ER and Golgi complex. Oligosaccharide processing enzymes are listed above the line; the reaction they catalyze is diagramed below the line (except for the alternate processing reaction, 3a). The subcellular localization of processing events are depicted by the brackets. Structures susceptible or resistant to digestion by endo H, an enzyme frequently used as a diagnostic test for processing to complex structures, are indicated. Symbols: \u03c8 , glucose; O, mannose; \u25a0, TV-acetylglucosamine; \u00b7 , galactose; \u25ba, fucose; \u2666, sialic acid. endoplasmic reticulum (RER) (Struck and Lennarz, 1980) . The luminal orientation of these oligosaccharides results in a defined luminal polarity for all subsequent oligosaccharide processing events. Oligosaccharides of the nascent glycoproteins can then be modified from this common precursor to a variety of mature structures. Minimal modification will result in oligosaccharides containing mannose-terminal branches (high-mannosetype), while more extensive modification may result in structures containing GlcNAc, Gal, fucose, and sialic acid characteristic of complex-type oligosaccharides (Fig. 1) . Partial processing of one or more oligosaccharide branches may also result in both mannose-terminal and complextype modifications on different branches of the same oligosaccharide (hybrid type) (for review, see Kornfeld and Kornfeld, 1985) .",

            "text": "Modification of the common precursor to form these mature structures begins almost immediately after the cotranslational oligosaccharide transfer. The outer a-l,2-glucose and the inner two a-l,3-glucosyl residues are removed by glucosidases I and II, respectively. Each of these enzymes has been purified to homogeneity and has been localized to the mem- branes of the RER (Burns and Touster, 1982; Brada and Dubach, 1984; Hettkamp et al., 1984; Hino and Rothman, 1985) . The removal of a single a-l,2-mannosyl residue on some glycoproteins by the action of an ER mannosidase apparently occurs prior to the transfer of these molecules to the Golgi complex (see Section II,A). Further trimming of a-l,2-mannosyl residues proceeds in the Golgi complex by the action of mannosidase I (see Section II,B). This enzyme is responsible for the complete removal of a-l,2-mannosyl residues to form Man 5 GlcNAc 2 . Removal of the final two mannosyl residues to yield the Man 3 GlcNAc 2 core structure present on complex-type oligosaccharides requires the prior addition of a GlcNAc residue to the 2 position of the mannose on the a-1,3 branch of Man 5 GlcNAc 2 (see Fig. 1 ). This transfer is accomplished by GlcNAc transferase I, an enzyme which has been purified and characterized from bovine colostrum (Harpaz and Schachter, 1980a) and rabbit liver (Oppenheimer and Hill, 1981) . After the formation of GlcNAcMan 5 GlcNAc 2 , a second Golgi mannosidase, mannosidase II (see Section II,C) catalyzes the removal of the two remaining terminal a-1,3-and a-l,6-linked mannosyl residues. The rigid substrate specificity of this enzyme therefore results in an overlap of the trimming phase of complex-type oligosaccharide synthesis with the subsequent elongation phase.",

The crude enzyme solubilized from ER membranes has a higher initial rate of hydrolysis for the Man 9 GlcNAc species when compared to the Man 8 _ 6 GlcNAc structures (Bischoffand . As discussed below (Section II,A,2), evidence is accumulating for a dMM-insensitive mannosidase activity in ER membranes capable of cleaving Man 9 GlcNAc 2 to a specific Man 8 GlcNAc 2 isomer; thus the specificity of the ER mannosidase activity was consistent with such a role. Unfortunately, when a more detailed examination of the substrate specificity of the purified soluble enzyme was performed, no preference for Man 9 GlcNAc 2 was found . Analysis of the intermediate structures generated by the digestion of Man 9 GlcNAc revealed that there is no apparent specificity in the removal of mannosyl residues by either the soluble or the membrane-associated enzyme. suggest that the difference between the free oligosaccharides and the protein-bound structures may confer steric or conformational features to the latter substrates allowing a greater specificity of hydrolysis. There may also be differences in specificity between the enzyme in association with the ER lipid bilayer in comparison to a soluble or detergent-solubilized form of the enzyme. Finally, in a temporal respect, nascent glycoproteins would presumably encounter an ER mannosidase for only a brief period prior to routing elsewhere in the cell.

The trimming of the mannose residue to form a single Man 8 GlcNAc 2 isomer is accomplished by a specific ER processing enzyme (see discussion above). There are significant differences between this enzyme and the ER processing mannosidase of rat liver, however. The yeast enzyme shows the appropriate substrate specificity in vitro, has no activity toward the synthetic substrate /?-nitrophenylmannoside, and is inhibited by the mammalian mannosidase I inhibitor, dMM (Jelinek-Kelly et al., 1985) .

The precursor for Sindbis virus glycoproteins E2 and E3 is a single polypeptide (PE2) in the ER containing Man 8 GlcNAc 2 oligosaccharides. Following proteolytic cleavage in the Golgi complex these glycoproteins are rapidly converted to complex oligosaccharides (Hakimi and Atkinson, 1982) . In fact, nascent vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) G glycoprotein still bound to poly somes has been found to contain a variety of intermediates of glucose trimming (Glc 3 Man 9 GlcN Ac to Man 9 GlcNAc) as well as a significant amount of Man 8 GlcNAc (Atkinson and Lee, 1984) . Similar results were obtained with a mutant of VSV G protein which accumulates in the ER, namely, the glycoprotein accumulates with Man 8 GlcNAc (Gabel and Bergmann, 1985) . A note of caution is appropriate in interpreting these results and some of those discussed below because the transfer of nonglucosylated oligosaccharide from lipid to protein has been detected in mammalian cells (Romero and Herscovics, 1986) .",

The glycoprotein synthesized in the absence of dMM contains Man 8 _ 6 GlcNAc 2 structures. In the presence of the inhibitor, however, the HMG-CoA reductase-bound oligosaccharides were predominantly Man 8 GlcNAc 2 . These results suggest that there are two a-1,2-mannosidase activities involved in the processing of this ER membrane glycoprotein. The first activity is very close to the site of protein synthesis (RER) and is insensitive to inhibition by dMM, while the second activity is sensitive to dMM and, based on the rotavirus CCCP results discussed above, may be spatially separated from the first activity. Preliminary evidence for a dMM-sensitive ER mannosidase involved in the processing of the oligosaccharides on a rat growth hormone-influenza hemagglutinin hybrid protein has recently been presented (Rizzolo and Kornfeld, 1987) . In addition, Schweden et al. (1986) have isolated a dMMsensitive a-l,2-mannosidase from calf liver microsomes which recognizes Man 9 _ 7 GlcNAc 2 but not Man 6 GlcNAc 2 and has a requirement for divalent cations (see section B.2). Whether this second dMM-sensitive activity represents an alternate form of the previously characterized Golgi mannosidase I which may reside in low levels in ER membranes and slowly act on resident ER membrane proteins or is an additional previously uncharacterized ER mannosidase is presently under investigation.",

The dMM-insensitive a-l,2-mannosidase activity in this cell line is apparently acting on less than half of the total cellular glycoproteins.

The oligosaccharides of Sindbis virus glycoproteins, when grown on three different host cell lines, were found to vary in the extent of host-dependent processing at the individual glycosylation sites. Oligosaccharides at one site on glycoprotein El were predominantly complex-type structures in baby hamster kidney cells but were high-mannose structures at the same site in chick embryo fibroblasts. Other glycosylation sites in the same molecule were maintained as exclusively complex-type structures (Hsieh et al., 1983b) . The observation that a second glycosylation site on the same molecule can be processed to a complex structure in all three host cell lines suggests that the host-dependent variation in glycosylation did not result from alternate transport routes containing differing processing machinery. Since the polypeptide structure and presumably the conformation of the viral glycoprotein substrate remained constant, the only differences between the cell lines were probably the limits in the steric constraints required by one host cell processing enzyme to gain access to the viral glycosylation site when compared to the equivalent processing enzyme of the other cell lines.",

Individual glycosylation sites on this glycoprotein were isolated, and the time course of oligosaccharide processing at each site was assessed. Surprisingly, sites which were destined to be high-mannose oligosaccharides with Man 6 _ 5 GlcNAc 2 structures were processed to these structures after only a 30-min chase, while those destined to eventually become complex structures remained Man 8 _ 7 GlcNAc even after a 180-min chase. Since the isomeric forms of Man 8 GlcNAc 2 at each of the sites were identical, the differences in processing time could not result from a difference in the order of mannose removal, but merely the rate of removal. These authors hypothesized that the rate of processing of the oligosaccharides at these individual sites depends on the extent of substrate accessibility of each processing intermediate to the processing enzymes at each site. Ratelimiting steps in processing might therefore reflect conditions where the constraints on substrate accessibility were most severe. Accumulation of specific intermediates of processing would not need to reflect a delay in the transport of a glycoprotein substrate to the site of a new processing mannosidase, as suggested previously by these authors (Hickman et aL, 1984) , but merely reflects a rate-limiting processing step.",

These authors present evidence, however, that the conformation of the oligosaccharide on the H chain is constrained through an interaction with the polypeptide chain in such a way that is renders the oligosaccharide unable to be recognized by GlcNAc transferase III, the enzyme which adds the bisecting GlcNAc.",

When the protein was expressed in mouse L cells the polypeptide was glycosylated at the same single glycosylation site, but the oligosaccharides at this site contained 27% complex, 23% high-mannose, and 50% nonbisected hybrid-type oligosaccharides. Although the addition by GlcNAc transferase III of a bisecting GlcNAc on chicken ovalbumin would convert these oligosaccharides to a structure which is no longer a substrate for mannosidase II, an explanation which has been used to account for bisected hybrid structures on this protein (Schachter et al., 1982) , in the mouse L cells ovalbumin oligosaccharides contain hybrid structures even in the absence of a bisecting GlcNAc. The negligible amount of hybrid oligosaccharides in the total cell glycoproteins suggests that ovalbumin hybrid structures do not result merely from a stoichiometric competition between mannosidase II and galactosyltransferase, but that an interaction between the oligosaccharide and the polypeptide on ovalbumin hinders the action of mannosidase II even in the absence of a bisecting GlcNAc. Whether this is caused by the mere proximity of the polypeptide to essential oligosaccharide structural features or an interaction between the oligosaccharide and the polypeptide which alters the oligosaccharide conformation will require further structural analysis.",

As described above, however, several investigators have suggested that the early stages of mannose trimming may occur in the ER. Although these studies support the hypothesis of a Man 9 GlcNAc 2 to Man 8 GlcNAc 2 cleaving activity in ER membranes, they leave open the question of whether further trimming occurs at this location by an alternate mannosidase I-like activity Brown and Hickman, 1986; Schwenden et al., 1986) or in the Golgi complex by the previously characterized enzyme (Tabas and Kornfeld, 1979) . Since mannosidase I activity has been localized to the eis (Dunphy et al., 1981; Rothman, 1981) or medial (Dunphy and Rothman, 1985) regions of the Golgi complex by a combination of kinetic and cell fractionation studies, the question of how ER glycoproteins are processed beyond a Man 8 GlcNAc 2 structure in the ER remains unanswered. Although the possibility of an additional ER mannosidase exists, the evidence does not exclude mannosidase I was a processing enzyme even for ER proteins.",

A more precise technique for the analysis of the subcellular localization of this enzyme would be to use immunocytochemistry. Fortunately, the enzyme has recently been purified, and a specific antibody has been raised (see Section II,B,2).

The homogeneous enzyme preferentially removes the central mannose on Man 9 GlcNAc yielding a single Man 8 GlcNAc isomer and further cleaves through two Man 7 GlcNAc isomers, and a single Man 6 GlcNAc isomer, to the final Man 5 GlcNAc structure which is a substrate for GlcNAc transferase I.",

These authors, in examining the effect of dMM on the process-ing of IgM and IgD, found that while the secretion of these glycoproteins was not affected by the inhibitor, the oligosaccharides of the secreted material contained mostly Man 9 GlcNAc (75%) along with Man 8 GlcNAc (25%) structures. Subsequent studies have shown that this inhibitor will cause the accumulation of Man 9 GlcNAc 2 on the glycoproteins of Rous sarcoma virus (Bosch et al., 1985) , influenza virus (Elbein et al., 1984; Burke et al., 1984) , and vesicular stomatitis virus (Burke et al., 1984) while not interfering with their cell surface expression or viral infectivity. The cell surface expression of the human class I histocompatibility antigens was also not altered by this inhibitor (Burke et al., 1984) . In HepG2 cells dMM caused a delay in the proteolytic processing of cathepsin D while increasing the fraction of the enzyme which was secreted (Nauerth et al., 1985) , but in parallel studies in fibroblasts the inhibitor did not alter either the segregation or maturation of the enzyme. 1-Deoxymannojirimycin in combination with other analogous glycosidase inhibitors such as deoxynorjirimycin, castanospermine, and swainsonine should therefore by a useful tool in determining the precise role of the sequential steps of oligosaccharide maturation on localization and biological activity of cellular and secreted glycoproteins.",

Similar MNT derivatives of galactose and glucose have been shown to irreversibly inhibit the corresponding galactosidases and glucosidases (Van Diggelen et al., 1980) and have been instrumental in both examining the expression of these enzymes in human cells (Van Diggelen et al., 1981) and uncovering the metabolic defect in combined galactosidase and neuraminidase deficiency (Van Diggelen et al., 1981) . Treatment of perfused rat liver by Docherty et al. (1986) with mannose-MNT resulted in the secretion of a r acid glycoprotein containing Man 9 _ 7 GlcNAc. Recovery of the secretion of normal complex-type structures following the removal of the inhibitor took over 24 hr, probably reflecting the synthesis of new enzyme. Since this compound results in the irreversible inhibition of mannosidases it could also theoretically be used as a covalent active site probe. Further studies on the inhibition of isolated processing mannosidases would be helpful, however, to further assess the inhibitor studies in vivo. Unfortunately, the restricted availability of the mannose-MNT derivative and the difficulty of synthesis of mannosylmethylamine, the precursor of mannose-MNT, may also prove to be factors affecting the general use of the inhibitor in processing studies.",

These authors also mentioned concurrent studies on a ricin-resistant CHO cell line, clone 15B, which revealed that a deficiency in a GlcNAc transferase caused the accumulation of oligosaccharides with a Man 5 GlcNAc 2 structure. This observation was, in fact, the first evidence that the full cleavage of mannosyl residues to the Man 3 GlcNAc 2 core found in complex oligosaccharides required the prior addition of a GlcNAc. Several investigators Tulsiani et al., 1982b; Harpaz and Schachter, 1980b) have since shown that rat liver contains an enzyme which is dependent on the prior addition by GlcNAc transferase I of a single GlcNAc in an a-1,2 linkage to the lower a-1,3 branch of Man 5 GlcNAc 2 . This mannosidase cleaves both the a-1,3-and a-1,6-mannose residues of GlcNAcMan 5 GlcNAc 2 but does not recognize as a substrate Man 5 GlcNAc 2 , GlcNAc 2 Man 5 GlcNAc 2 (with one bisecting \u00df-1,4-GlcNAc on the core \u00df-l,4-mannose), or GalGlcNAcMan 5 GlcNAc 2 (Tulsiani et al., 1982b; Schachter et al., 1982) . Thus this enzyme, with a very restricted substrate specificity toward two specific a-1,3-and a-1,6mannosyl residues on GlcNAcMan 5 GlcNAc 2 , was named mannosidase II for its position as the second Golgi processing mannosidase in the maturation of complex oligosaccharides (Tulsiani et al., 1982b) .",

In addition, both activities are inhibited by swainsonine, an indolizidine alkaloid which also inhibits the lysosomal enzyme (Tulsiani et al., 1982a) . Activity of the enzyme toward GlcNAcMan 5 GlcNAc is at least 10-fold higher than the corresponding activity toward the high-mannose oligosaccharides Man 9 _ 5 GlcNAc. Lack of activity toward oligosaccharides containing a bisecting GlcNAc or a galactose added to the nonreducing GlcNAc of GlcNAcMan 5 GlcNAc 2 implies that the relative levels of any of three key processing enzymes, namely, mannosidase II, GlcNAc transferase III, and galactosyltransferase, will determine the fate of oligosaccharide processing toward complex, bisected hybrid, or hybrid structures, respectively. Thus, a relative excess of mannosidase II will result in the cleavage to GlcNAcMan 3 GlcNAc 2 prior to the substrate being \"frozen\" in a hybrid structure by GlcNAc transferase III or galactosyltransferase activities.

In general, though hybrid structures are induced, there are few cases of swainsonine causing an altered function of cellular or secreted glycoproteins. Yeo et al. (1985) detected a slight acceleration in intracellular transport of the secretory glycoproteins transferrin, ceruloplasmin, a 2 -niacroglobulin, and \u00abi-antitrypsin while no alteration in the rate of transport of the nonglycoprotein albumin was observed. The inhibitor was also shown to inhibit receptor-mediated uptake by the mannose receptor (Arumugham and Tanzer, 1983a; Chung et al., 1984) but this probably results from the production of cell surface glycoproteins containing hybrid oligosaccharides. These structures, which are effective ligands for the mannose receptor, probably compete with exogenously added ligand for receptor binding. Swainsonine was also found to be a potent immunomodulator both in vitro and in vivo (Kino et al., 1985) , while inhibitor treatment of tumor cells has been shown to alter the recognition of these cells by allogeneic lymphocytes (Powell et al., 1985) . Therefore, although mannosidase II and the resulting complex oligosaccharides it produces may not be essential for the expression or localization of specific glycoproteins in homogeneous cell populations in culture, the interaction of heterogeneous cell populations in mammalian tissues may be more strongly effected by the shift in oligosaccharide structure.",

The enzyme is synthesized in both 3T3 and HeLa cells as a 124 kDa polypeptide containing endo H-sensitive oligosaccharides which contribute ~7 kDa to the apparent molecular mass of the molecule. In both cell lines the oligosaccharides are eventually converted to mostly (HeLa) or entirely (3T3) endo H-resistant structures. The HeLa cell enzyme is further processed by the addition of O-linked oligosaccharides which cause a shift in apparent molecular mass to 134-136 kDa. These studies demonstrated the addition of sulfate to the relinked oligosaccharides of mannosidase II in both cell lines as well as covalently bound phosphate and palmitate. The phosphate on the HeLa cell enzyme was found as serine phosphate moieties. The half-life of the enzyme in both cell lines was about 20 hr, which was slightly shorter than the rate of turnover of the total cellular protein.",

An unexpected result, however, was that the catalytic domain was quite resistant to digestion by a wide variety of the proteases used in the topology studies. Chymotrypsin, pronase, and proteinase K could all cleave the intact 124 kDa polypeptide to a 110 kDa form which, at least after chymotrypsin digestion, retained all of the original catalytic activity. A similar cleavage could be accomplished by trypsin or V-8 protease to a 115 kDa form. This cleavage could not be demonstrated in nonpermeabilized intact Golgi membranes. In saponin-permeabilized membranes chymotrypsin cleavage resulted in the production of the 110 kDa cleaved form, which, if the membranes were sedimented, was found in soluble form in the supernatant. Both the cleavage and release were dependent on the presence of both detergent and protease. These results suggest that the 110 kDa form represents a soluble form of the enzyme generated by protease digestion. Triton X-114 phase separation studies confirmed that the 110 kDa polypeptide represents a hydrophilic catalytic domain while the 124 kDa intact enzyme is a hydrophobic integral membrane protein.",

R. P. Tulsiani and O. Touster, unpublished) . This result suggests that the brain of at least two species contains a swainsonine-sensitive a-mannosidase other than mannosidase II.",

In spite of the advances made in understanding the roles of these enzymes, many intriguing questions still remain. The apparent multiplicity of mannosidases cleaving early high-mannose intermediates suggests that there may be a distinct physiological function for each of the a-l,2-mannosidase activities. The finding of a broad-specificity membrane-bound mannosidase in brain also raises questions about alternate routes of biosynthesis of glycoproteins. Finally, fundamental questions in cell biology, such as determinants for the localization of organellar glycoproteins and regulation of the levels of glycoprotein processing enzymes in the cell, are being pursued through the cloning and expression of processing mannosidases. The solutions to these and other problems will, we hope, lead to a further understanding of the role of glycoprotein structure in the physiology of a cell.",
