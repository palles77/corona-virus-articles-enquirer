            "text": "The sudden increase of COVID-19 cases is putting a high pressure on healthcare services worldwide. At the current stage, fast, accurate and early clinical assessment of the disease severity is vital. To support decision making and logistical planning in healthcare systems, this study leverages a database of blood samples from 404 infected patients in the region of Wuhan, China to identify crucial predictive biomarkers of disease severity. For this purpose, machine learning tools selected three biomarkers that predict the survival of individual patients with more than 90% accuracy: lactic dehydrogenase (LDH), lymphocyte and high-sensitivity Creactive protein (hs-CRP). In particular, relatively high levels of LDH alone seem to play a crucial role in distinguishing the vast majority of cases that require immediate medical attention. This finding is consistent with current medical knowledge that high LDH levels are associated with tissue breakdown occurring in various diseases, including pulmonary disorders such as pneumonia. Overall, this paper suggests a simple and operable formula to quickly predict patients at the highest risk, allowing them to be prioritised and potentially reducing the mortality rate.",

The virus causes fever, cough, fatigue and mild to severe respiratory complications, eventually leading to patient death. On March 6, the total amount of cumulated infection cases over the world was 97,000 and 3,400 deaths [WHO] . On March 11, the virus outbreak was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization, as the virus spread to 114 countries, totalling over 118,000 recorded cases and 4,300 deaths [WHO] . So far, it has been reported that 26.1-32.0% of COVID-19 infected patients are prone to develop critically ill cases 1, 2 . Furthermore, recent reports expose an astonishing case fatality rate of 61.5% for critical cases, increasing sharply with age and for patients with underlying comorbidities 3 . Both the reach and severity of cases is putting great pressure on the medical services, and readily lead to a shortage of intensive care resources.",

The capacity to distinguish cases that are at imminent risk of mortality, therefore, has become an urgent yet challenging necessity. Under those circumstances, we retrospectively analysed blood samples of 404 patients from the region of Wuhan, China to identify robust and meaningful markers of mortality risk. For this purpose, a mathematical modelling approach based on state-of-the-art interpretable machine learning algorithms was devised to identify the most discriminative biomarkers of patient survival. The problem is formulated as a classification task, where the inputs are basic information, symptoms, blood samples, laboratory test, including liver function, kidney function, coagulation function, electrolyte, inflammatory factors taken from originally general, severe and critical patients (Table 1) and their associated outcomes corresponding to either survival or death at the end of the examination period. Through optimization, the classifier aims to reveal the most crucial biomarkers distinguishing patients at imminent risk, thereby relieving clinical burden and potentially reducing the mortality rate.",

Injured alveolar epithelial cells could induce the infiltration of lymphocytes, leading to persistent lymphopenia as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV did, given that they share similar alveolar penetrating and antigen presenting cells (APC) impairing pathways 13,14 . A biopsy study has provided strong evidence that the counts of peripheral CD4 and CD8 T cells were substantially reduced, while their status was hyperactivated 15 . Also, Jing and colleagues reported the lymphopenia is mainly related to the decrease of CD4 and CD8 T cells 16 .

Although the original database covered more than 3,000 patients, most clinical outcomes had not yet been released at the time of this study. We look forward to subsequent large sample and multi-centred studies. Second, although we had a pool of more than 80 clinical measurements, here our modelling principle is a trade-off between the minimal number of features and the capacity of good prediction, therefore avoiding overfitting. Finally, this study strikes a balance between model interpretability and improved accuracy. While clinical settings tend to prefer interpretable models, it is possible that a black box model may lead to improved performance.",

We developed an XGBoost machine learning-based prognostic model that can predict the survival rates of severe patients with more than 90% accuracy using the last sample and 90% from any other blood sample, enabling detection, early intervention and potentially reduction of mortality in high-risk patients with COVID-19.
