            "text": "Zoonotic disease emergence is not a purely biological process mediated only by ecologic factors; opportunities for transmission of zoonoses from animals to humans also depend on how people interact with animals. While exposure is conditioned by the type of animal and the location in which interactions occur, these in turn are influenced by human activity. The activities people engage in are determined by social as well as contextual factors including gender, age, socio-economic status, occupation, social norms, settlement patterns and livelihood systems, family and community dynamics, as well as national and global influences. This paper proposes an expanded \"One Health\" conceptual model for humananimal exposure that accounts for social as well as epidemiologic factors. The expanded model informed a new study approach to document the extent of human exposure to animals and explore the interplay of social and environmental factors that influence risk of transmission at the individual and community level. The approach includes a formative phase using qualitative and participatory methods, and a representative, random sample survey to quantify exposure to animals in a variety of settings. The paper discusses the different factors that were considered in developing the approach, including the range of animals asked about and the parameters of exposure that are included, as well as factors to be considered in local adaptation of the generic instruments. Illustrative results from research using this approach in Lao PDR are presented to demonstrate the effect of social factors on how people interact with animals. We believe that the expanded model can be similarly operationalized to explore the interactions of other social and policy-level determinants that may influence transmission of zoonoses.",

However, these are only the latest in a series of outbreaks of novel diseases in humans during the last decade of the 20th century highlighting the need for focus on the zoonotic (animal) origin of viral infections. For instance, avian influenza H5N1 was identified in Hong Kong in 1997 (Mounts et al., 1999) ; Rift Valley fever caused an estimated 27,500 human infections and reported loss of approximately 70% of livestock (primarily sheep and goats) in Garissa District, Kenya, in 1997e1999 with reports of disease in four other provinces in Kenya as well as in Somalia and Tanzania (Woods et al., 2002) ; an outbreak of Nipah virus in Malaysia in 1998e1999 caused at least 283 human cases of encephalitis and 109 deaths (Chua, 2003) with an estimated 1.1 million pigs culled in efforts to stop transmission (FAO and APHCA, 2002) ; and outbreaks of West Nile virus occurred in Europe from 1996 to 1999 (Hubalek and Halouzka, 1999) and the United States beginning in 1999 (WHO, 2012) . In 2001 Taylor and colleagues (Taylor et al., 2001) inventoried known human infectious disease pathogens and pointed out that 61% of all pathogens and 75% of emerging disease pathogens were zoonotic in origin. About 80% of human viral pathogens are zoonotic (Morse et al., 2012; Taylor et al., 2001) .",

The premise of One Health is that people, animals and the environment form an interdependent ecosystem that needs to be considered in a coordinated manner (FAO et al., 2008; Frank, 2008) .

Most of the discussions to date about drivers of emergence (Daszak et al., 2000; A. Dobson and Foufopoulos, 2001; Karesh et al., 2012; Patz et al., 2004; Smolinski et al., 2003) have focused on anthropogenic land use changes e essentially resource exploitation (logging, mining, establishment of plantations, dam building) and associated road building and pollution. These factors are fundamental drivers of disease emergence in wildlife through their effects on habitat fragmentation, biodiversity and hostpathogen dynamics. A second set of frequently mentioned drivers focuses on movement of hosts and pathogens through travel and the transport and trade of animals and animal products. Finally, increased human-animal contact occurs because of increasing human population density and its consequences e encroachment of humans into previously undisturbed areas and the development of larger scale or more intensive animal production systems (Slingenbergh et al., 2004) .",

The ecological factors included El Ni no-cycle related drought, land use change (deforestation and reduced habitat for fruit bats due to logging) and fire arising from slash and burn agriculture that displaced bats to orchards in Ipoh. In addition, key factors included local practices regarding location of piggeries in and near fruit orchards and pigsties constructed so that water run-off from roofs e and fruit dropped by bats e was directed into the pigsty. The result was that pigs were able to eat bat-saliva-contaminated fruit, became infected and then infected their handlers.",

For preventing, or at least slowing, the emergence of new diseases e and for more efficient response to outbreaks e we need to have a better understanding of these proximate determinants. One route to preventing recurrence of Nipah virus at pig farms would be to implement policies and regulations addressing the \"upstream\" land use changes that eventually led to emergence. A second, complementary route is through interventions affecting what Chua calls \"the pattern of pig and orchard farming\" (Chua et al., 2002) ; that is, human activities at the local level.

There is a lively debate about the proximate determinants of prevalence, which may include animal biology, pathogen ecology, animal density, biodiversity and animal movement, among others (Keesing et al., 2010) . On the human side of the model the probability of spillover transmission from animals is primarily affected by the likelihood of someone encountering an infected animal or its excreta, determined by the frequency with which people come in contact with specific types of animals that might carry infections and the type of contact they have with animals; that is, by the types of activities in which they engage.",

Wild animal meat purchased in markets is frequently more expensive than domestic animal meat; a market survey carried out by WCS and FHI360 in Laos (unpublished) showed that brush-tailed porcupine meat cost three times as much as domestic pork per kilogram. In addition, within-family dynamics can affect who gets exposed and with what frequency and intensity. As an example, family type e e.g. single parent, nuclear family or extended e will affect whether and how intensely children are socialized to hunting or what food allocation rules are practiced to determine who gets to eat what part of the animal (Whitehead, 2000) .",

Various customs with regards to specific animals may serve different social functions that can shed light on other determinants of exposure. For instance, hunting some animals may confer certain social standing in the community and sharing the products of a hunt maybe used as a way of incurring favors (Gurven and von Rueden, 2006) . Food taboos related to animals, often applied differentially to subgroups (e.g. children, pregnant women, individuals from different castes), can serve several purposes including protecting health, marking special events, protecting or allocating scarce resources, or creating group cohesion (Meyer-Rochow, 2009 ). Settlement patterns affect the variety and number of animals to which people might be exposed. For example, how houses are constructed, which may be associated with ethnicity and/or socioeconomic status, may determine risk of rodent infestation (Bonner et al., 2007) . Rodent abundance is also affected by location of housing relative to different types of animal habitat and open water sources and to waste disposal sites (Bonner et al., 2007; Masi et al., 2010; Promkerd et al., 2008) . It is important to note that while increasing urbanization produces habitats unsuitable for many species of animals, urban-adapted wild animals can occur at higher densities in urban and peri-urban areas than in more rural areas (Bradley and Altizer, 2007) . Finally, governance and politics, from local to international levels, can affect not only the extent and impact of some of the anthropogenic land use changes mentioned above but also social dynamics at all levels to influence who gets exposed and with what frequency and intensity. Our expanded model increases the level of detail of the One Health framework and strengthens the foundation for understanding the interplay of factors that lead to disease emergence. Below we describe a research approach based on this expanded model.",

As a first step, we chose to start this endeavor simply, by comparing groups distinguished by different social determinants of human activity involving animals, e.g., gender, age, ethnic norms, livelihood systems, settlement patterns. The study is designed to facilitate such comparisons, for example, of different population groups (e.g., two ethnicities) living in the same location, thus having similar access to animals, or the same group in locations where access to animals is likely to differ (e.g., one ethnic group living in different settings). In addition, the design includes separate samples of men and women to assess the effect of gender on exposure and provides for subsamples of children likely to have different frequencies or types of exposure than adults.

Given current realities, a more in-depth understanding of the specific (\"micro\") aspects of the human-animal interface that can result in spillover events would complement current efforts for planning prevention or mitigation strategies. The expanded One Health model asserts that different people living in the same location, affected by the same large-scale drivers, may be at different risk of spillover because of the social factors that influence the types of activities they engage in. Who is at risk and how they are at risk of spillover are determined by social factors, such as those affecting communities within societies and families and individuals within communities (e.g., gender, age, family structures, SES, occupation, community resources), norms with regards to different animals (e.g., food taboos or preferences), settlement patterns that can limit or increase contact with certain animals (e.g. how homes are constructed) and livelihood systems that may involve direct or indirect contact with animals (e.g., whether or not people rely on subsistence or commercial hunting). Information about these factors can be used to develop targeted interventions to reduce risk. As illustrated by the development of the human-animal exposure study, the expanded model can guide a more in-depth exploration of the human-animal interface. Information generated from such studies can be critical for identifying specific groups that are at high risk of spillover and assessing possible routes of transmission. For instance, in Lao PDR, where a human-animal exposure study informed by the expanded model was implemented with different groups living in the same general location, the unexpected finding that children were more exposed than adults to some animals suggests that children might warrant a special look if there is a concern about transmission of viruses from bats and rats. On the other hand, if the concern is about viruses from nonhuman primates, a focus on Hmong men might be very important.",

For instance, in the communities described in this paper, hunting and ingestion of key animals previously implicated in outbreaks (rodents, bats and nonhuman primates) is common: men and boys hunt, and different sub-groups of the communities eat these animals, albeit at different rates. In addition, raising animals such as chickens and pigs, which are known to be intermediary hosts, is a universal activity. Depending on the specific animal, virus or route of transmission, interventions might be able to target specific groups involved in different activities. For example, since men and boys are the groups most involved in hunting, they could be the specific focus of general programs to promote safer hunting practices, but if exposure to rats/mice were a particular concern, the intervention would need to include women and girls as well. General interventions addressing butchering and preparation of animals should involve all age/gender groups.",

Other groups are encouraged to use the model as a basis for developing studies to explore the complex interaction of various social and environmental factors that result in disease emergence. Some of the questions to be explored might include: how does urbanization and exposure to \"international\" norms affect attitudes and patterns of consumption of different types of wildlife meat? What effects do various approaches to communitybased natural resource management in different types of communities have on the frequency and type of interaction with domestic and wild animals? How do national policies regarding universal primary education and their implementation at the local level affect community and family expectations, their socialization of children and different family members' relation with domestic and wild animals?",

A cross-sectional survey of a large group of individuals such as reported here is appropriate for capturing an overall snapshot of the human-animal interface, including all the animal species people could come interact with as well as all the major activities and locations associated with interactions. Other approaches would be optimal for more focused studies targeting a specific group of animals (e.g. primates) or specific activities (e.g. hunting). For instance, exposure could be documented by intense observation of individuals over long periods of time or by asking people to keep diaries of specific activities such as hunting or eating. More in-depth qualitative or ethnographic studies can help tease out the social and cultural influences shaping specific types of interactions with animals. It is important, however, to remember that all these methods bring their own set of methodological and ethical challenges that would need to be carefully considered, similar to the process described in this paper for the cross-sectional study.",
