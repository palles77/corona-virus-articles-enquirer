We have investigated the secretion of these hormones in schizophrenic patients to assess these claims of diagnostic specificity.",

No subject was taking psychotropic drugs at the time of study (the schizophrenics had had neuroleptic medication discontinued 1-12 years previously). All subjects had been in bed for 1-2 h before blood sampling and the same proportion of each group was awakened from sleep. Cortisol and melatonin were assayed blind from coded serum samples by radioimmunoassay9,1O and results are shown in the table. Log transformed data were analysed by Student's t-test. Five chronic schizophrenics (33%) had undetectable midnight melatonin levels, which were considered for these calculations to be at the detection limit (7 pg/ml).",

I However, rotavirus infection in the newborn is frequently symptomless. There has been increasing interest in the epidemiology of neonatal rotavirus infections because of possible roles of such infections in the transmission of disease to susceptible household contacts and in the acquisition of immunity to the disease during infancy (in infants colonised in the neonatal period). The frequency of neonatal rotavirus infection varies from zero to 52%, and there are wide geographical and seasonal variations in incidence.2,7 We report here on experience at a neonatal nursery in Baltimore.",

Stool specimens were obtained on term infants on the first day of life and, when possible, a second sample was obtained before discharge (at age 2 -5 days). In the preterm infants, stool specimens were obtained on the day of admission (day 1 or 2 of age) and then weekly until discharge. Stools were tested for rotavirus antigen by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. 8 1025 (87%) of the 1175 infants (902 term and 273 preterm) admitted to the nursery during the study period were studied. 200 (83%) of the preterm infants had two or more stool samples tested and 405 (52%) of the term infants had more than one stool sample tested. Rotavirus antigen was detected in 13 infants (I -3%). The incidence of rotavirus colonisation was 1 7% in preterm and 1 3% in term infants, but this difference was not significant.
