Based on surface marker expression individual cells at different stages of human B cell development are isolated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting. For each cell Ig heavy and corresponding Ig light chain gene transcripts are amplified by nested RT-PCR and cloned into eukaryotic expression vectors to produce monoclonal human antibodies of the same specificity in vitro. All reactions are performed in 96-well plates and allow cloning of large numbers of Ig genes. The recombinant antibodies are tested for reactivity with diverse self-and nonself antigens and the reactivity profile can be directly linked to the complete Ig heavy and IgL chain gene sequence information that is obtained as part of the cloning strategy. In summary, our method to clone and express human monoclonal antibodies is unbiased, highly efficient, requires only small cell numbers and the recombinant antibodies allow direct conclusions on the frequency of specific human B cells in a diverse repertoire.",

Basic understanding of the expressed human antibody repertoire at different stages during B cell development came from Ig gene analyses from cDNA libraries of bulk isolated human B cell subpopulations and single B cells of defined origin (Huang and Stollar, 1991; Huang et al., 1992; Shiokawa et al., 1999; Wang and Stollar, 2000) . Other studies compared the Ig gene usage and Ig gene characteristics among distinct B cells subpopulations from healthy individuals and patients with autoimmune diseases and demonstrated that differences in the overall representation of individual Ig genes are part of the normal B cell repertoire (Stewart et al., 1993; Demaison et al., 1995; Pascual and Capra, 1995; Demaison et al., 1996; Dorner et al., 1998; Dorner et al., 1999; Hansen et al., 2000) .",

However, sequence analysis alone does not allow predictions on antibody reactivities. To date human antibodies of defined specificities were obtained in large by cloning Ig genes from hybridomas or Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) transformed human B cells. Obtaining these stable human B cell lines involves low efficiency and therefore highly selective procedures (Stahli et al., 1980; Aman et al., 1984; Redmond et al., 1986; Borrebaeck et al., 1988; Crain et al., 1989; Laffly and Sodoyer, 2005) . Thus, they cannot be used to document the frequency of B cells with defined specificities or Ig gene usage in individual B cell populations. To overcome these limitations we developed a strategy to clone and express antibodies from single human B cells of defined origin (Wardemann et al., 2003) . The recombinant antibodies can be generated in large amounts to provide sufficient material for testing in various assays (Wardemann et al., 2003; Meffre et al., 2004; Ng et al., 2004; Herve et al., 2005; Samuels et al., 2005; Yurasov et al., 2005; Tsuiji et al., 2006; Yurasov et al., 2006; Herve et al., 2007; Tiller et al., 2007) .",

The RosetteSep\u00ae human B cell enrichment antibody cocktail (Stemcell Technologies Inc.) crosslinks non-B cells to multiple red blood cells (RBCs), forming immunorosettes which pellet along with free RBCs when centrifuged over a buoyant density medium. If necessary, for example due to low B cell counts in samples from patients with autoimmune disease, B cells were enriched using anti-CD19 magnetic beads (Miltenyi Biotech). Purified mononuclear cells were stained on ice with anti-human antibodies (Becton Dickinson) directly coupled to fluorescein-isothiocyanate (FITC), phycoerythrin (PE), allophycocyanin (APC), or biotin to distinguish among individual B cell subpopulations (Table 1) . Biotinylated antibodies were detected using Streptavidin-PECy7 (CALTAG). Single cells were sorted on a FACSVantage (Becton Dickinson) excluding cell duplets into 96-well PCR plates (Eppendorf) containing 4 \u03bcl/well of ice-cold 0.5\u00d7 phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 10 mM DTT, 8 U RNAsin (Promega), 0.4 U 5\u2032-3\u2032 Prime RNAse Inhibitor (Eppendorf).

Sequences were analyzed by IgBLAST comparison with GenBank (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/igblast/) to identify germline V(D)J gene segments with highest identity. IgH complementarity determining region (CDR)3 length was determined as indicated in IgBlast by counting the aa residues following framework region (FWR)3 up to the conserved tryptophan-glycine motif in all JH segments or up to the conserved phenylalanin-glycine motif in JL segments (Kabat, 1991) . The number of positively (Histidine (H), Arginine (R), Lysine (K)) and negatively charged (Aspartate (D), Glutamate (E)) amino acids (aa) were determined for each IgH and IgL CDR3 region. IgH chain D genes and D gene reading frames (RF) were identified following the criteria of Corbett et al. (Corbett et al., 1997) . Polymorphisms were identified by comparison with published germline sequences (http://imgt.cines.fr) or based on our own observations. In contrast to sequences from cloned Ig genes, 2 nd PCR product sequences are unlikely to show the mutations that were introduced by the Taq polymerase and would do so only if the mutations were introduced early during the PCR. Analysis of Ig gene sequences from naive B cells lacking somatic mutations allows the detection of Taq-mediated misincorporated nucleotides by comparison to published germline sequences. Our own observations show that the single misincorporated nucleotides can be seen in less than 10% of all 2 nd PCR product sequences analysed (Wardemann et al., 2003 and TT, unpublished observations) .",

Digests were carried out with the respective restriction enzymes AgeI, SalI and XhoI (all from NEB) in the same plate in a total volume of 35-40 \u03bcl and digested PCR products were purified as described before ligation into human Ig\u03b31, Ig\u03ba and Ig\u03bb expression vectors containing a murine Ig gene signal peptide sequence (GenBank accession no. DQ407610) and a multiple cloning site upstream of the human Ig\u03b31, Ig\u03ba or Ig\u03bb constant regions. Transcription is under the influence of the human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) promotor and clones can be selected based on resistance to ampicillin.

PCR products of the expected size (650 bp for Ig\u03b31, 700 bp for Ig\u03ba and 590 bp for Ig\u03bb) were sequenced to confirm identity with the original PCR products (Fig. 1 ). Due to the use of error-prone Taq-Polymerase approximately 10% of all cloned inserts contained mutations leading to aa exchanges if compared to the nucleotide sequences obtained from 2 nd PCR products of the same Ig gene before cloning and were therefore excluded from further analyses (data not shown). Plasmid DNA was isolated from 3 ml bacteria cultures grown for 16 h at 37\u00b0C in Terrific Broth (Difco Laboratories) containing 75 \u03bcg/ml ampicillin (Sigma) using QIAprep Spin columns (Qiagen).

If immunofluorescence assays are performed, special care needs to be taken to discriminate between weak unspecific background staining patterns to subnuclear and cytoplasmic structures frequently observed for non-reactive antibodies if used at high concentrations and for polyreactive antibodies with similar but stronger binding patterns. It is important to note that subnuclear and cytoplasmic staining patterns are not sufficient to determine if an antibody is polyreactive.

All PCR, purification and cloning reactions are performed in 96-well plates, which allows the fast and efficient handling of large numbers of clones. Full-length Ig gene transcripts were amplified in two nested PCRs. The first PCR used forward primer mixes specific for the respective V H , V\u03ba or V\u03bb leader regions and a single reverse primer specific for the respective constant region. If desired reverse primer mixes can be used for example for the amplification of IgH chains with different isotypes such as \u03bc, \u03b3 and \u03b1. Except for the amplification of Ig\u03ba genes that are amplified with a single forward primer (panV\u03ba), nested IgH and Ig\u03bb PCRs are performed with mixes of forward primers which include the AgeI restriction site and anneal to the first 18 nucleotides of the respective V genes (Table 2 ). If used in combination with the reverse 3\u2032Sal J H gene primer mix or the 3\u2032Xho C\u03bb primer, respectively, these PCR products can be directly used for cloning. However, the use of primer mixes frequently leads to the introduction of aa exchanges in the annealing region due to crosspriming of non-identical primers in the mix. To avoid such alterations or if restriction sites were not introduced by the 2 nd PCR primers as for the amplification of Ig\u03ba genes, nested PCR products were sequenced to identify the specific V and J gene combination for each gene. Furthermore, amplification of IgH chains using the nested reverse primers specific for the constant regions of all 4 human isotype subclasses (3\u2032C\u03b3CH1, 3\u2032IgG internal; Table 2 ) allowed the discrimination of each subclass antibody after sequencing.",

Our strategy to clone Ig genes from single human B cells shows comparable efficiency. However, the production of recombinant monoclonal antibodies as described here is not limited to distinct B cell populations and does not depend on prior stimulation.

This method is well suited to study the expressed antibody repertoire in humans. Strategy to clone and express human monoclonal antibodies. IgH and IgL chain genes were amplified by nested RT-PCR from single cell cDNA generated by amplification with random hexamers before ligation into eukaryotic expression vectors. 1 st PCRs were performed with forward primer mixes specific for the leader region and reverse primers specific for the respective IgH, Ig\u03ba or Ig\u03bb constant region. 2 nd PCRs were performed with forward primer mixes specific for FWR1 and respective nested reverse primers specific for the IgH, Ig\u03ba and Ig\u03bb J genes or constant regions. If 2 nd PCR primers contained restriction sites, the products were sequenced and directly cloned. Alternatively, to avoid the introduction of aa exchanges by the use of primer mixes and for the cloning of full-length Ig\u03ba genes, 2 nd PCR products were sequenced to determine the respective V and J gene. After that V gene and J gene specific primers containing restriction sites were used in another round of amplification using the 1 st PCR product as template. All PCR products were sequenced before and after expression vector cloning. For recombinant antibody production, plasmids containing inserts with 100% identity to the original PCR product were co-transfected into HEK 293 cells and antibodies were purified from supernatants after culture. Reversion of somatic mutations. (A) PCR strategy to revert mutated Ig genes into their germline counterparts. Asterics indicate somatic mutations. PCR 1 amplifies a germline VH gene corresponding to the VH in the mutated clone with gene specific primers. Primers used in PCR 2 revert somatic mutations in the mutated clone. Homology of the PCR 2 forward primer to the reverse primer used in PCR 1 is indicated. The PCR 2 reverse primer is JH-specific and contains the SalI restriction site. PCR products 1 and 2 are fused via the homologous region (indicated) in a subsequent overlap PCR using the same 5\u2032AgeI VH specific forward primer as in PCR 1 and the 3\u2032SalI JH specific reverse primer used in PCR 2 to generate the complete germline VDJ sequence. IgL chain somatic mutations are reverted following the same principle. Overlap PCR products are cloned into the respective expression vectors. (B) Partial sequence of a representative mutated IgH gene (top) starting in FWR3 and including the CDR3 region and the conserved J H tryptophan (W) -glycine (G) motif (FWR4). The corresponding unmutated germline configuration after successful reversion of somatic mutations as indicated on the bottom. Dots represent nucleotide identity.
