Little attention previously had been paid to these pathogens due to their relatively innocuous nature. Previously described species include HCV-229E and HCV-OC43, both of which cause respiratory infections. Although coronaviruses primarily infect respiratory mucosa, they also have been demonstrated in gastrointestinal mucosa (12) .

Even before the arrival of SARS, some first responders were reluctant to provide mouthto-mouth assisted ventilations, even with a barrier device (31) . The potential presence of an infection like SARS can be expected to make first responder intervention less likely. Current CDC guidelines recommend full personal protective equipment (PPE), outlined below, for the transport of any known SARS patient.

Registration and assessment may then continue after ED personnel employ CDC-recommended PPE: gown, gloves, N95 respirator, and eye protection (35) . Strict hand washing also must be exercised (34) .

Once disposition of a SARS patient is completed, a terminal cleaning of the room should be done with standard hospital disinfectant (36) . The decision to involuntarily quarantine a patient for suspected SARS will require serious consideration as well as some adjustments to normal ED operations. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has granted involuntary quarantine authority to the U.S. Coast Guard, U.S. Customs Service, and individual state health departments (5). This authority was exercised for a tourist with SARS symptoms who was involuntarily held for 10 days in the State of New York as well as for an airline passenger returning to Minnesota from the Philippines through San Francisco (37, 38) . The HHS guidelines were then inactivated in June 2003, due to the cessation of new human cases (39) . The power to quarantine rests with government officials, but because the ED is the primary portal of entry to most hospitals, it is logical to surmise that the ED would become a major site of any quarantine action should the guidelines need to be reactivated.",

With current CDC guidelines, the key discriminator that separates a patient with potential SARS from a multitude of other ED patients with respiratory complaints is the travel or exposure history. If widespread community transmission occurs in the United States, then it will become exceedingly difficult to separate out the SARS cases. Likely this will be combined with a much greater number of patients presenting without SARS but with similar symptoms and heightened concern for what their symptoms represent. One solution may be placing all patients with any historical concern for SARS in any available isolation measure, even if this means possibly mixing those with and without SARS. Other less attractive alternatives include more stringent triage guidelines, which may prolong the movement of suspected patients out of the waiting room, or the use of isolation rooms throughout the hospital for triage to minimize the mingling of patients, which may contaminate other sections of the hospital. Any overwhelming or shutdown of a hospital, as has already occurred in Beijing, will increase the burden on the remaining local EDs as well as adversely affect those patients who will have to seek their medical care elsewhere (40) .",

Recent successes have occurred in controlling the SARS epidemic despite the lack of specific details; primarily through general health measures and coordinated public health policies. Although the United States has thus far escaped the brunt of the SARS outbreak, the experiences of other affected countries have raised numerous concerns about our ability to respond to this rapidly emerging infection. SARS is both a considerable ongoing threat and a harbinger of the increasing incidence, scope, and virulence of emerging infections that the American public and emergency personnel will continue to face in the 21 st century.",
