However, the N95 respirators were deformed and could not be reused after disinfection [6] [7] [8] . Although UVC irradiation and ethanol disinfection had little effect on the properties of the equipment, they were not effective at eliminating pathogens [7] [8] [9] . The material of PPRPHs is thermoplastic urethane (TPU) or polyvinyl chloride (PVC) which differs from the N95 respirator. UVC cannot penetrate this material. The electric air supply system of the PPRPH cannot withstand in high temperatures. Therefore, UVC, autoclave and dry heating sterilization are not suitable for the PPRPHs.",

VHP can automatically degrade into water and oxygen in nature, and therefore is friendly to the environment. Hydrogen peroxide decontamination systems are widely used to reduce the risk of infection in hospitals, biosafety laboratories, and so on [10, 11] .

A. J. Beswick, et al. have summarized the existing gas disinfection methods in their paper, which includes formaldehyde vaporization, hydrogen peroxide-based fumigation, chlorine dioxide and ozone [22] . Formaldehyde is a toxic chemical and has been classified as a Group 1 human carcinogen. For this reason, a choice of alternative, effective fumigation technologies is desirable. However, none of the fumigants existing are harmless, and all have workplace exposure limits [22] . VHP can decompose into water and oxygen automatically, making it easier to handle after disinfection. Thus VHP was selected to decontaminate the protective equipment in this study. ",

The VHP transport pipes were connected to the VHP generator with the fumigation chamber. Protective equipment can be placed in the fumigation chamber (Figure 1) . B. Unger-Bimczok, et al. found that the hydrogen peroxide concentration was an important factor in the inactivation efficacy [23] , which was also verified in this study. The results indicate that the disinfection efficacy of VHP is directly related to the consumption of hydrogen peroxide solution (Tables 1 & 2) . VHP can be automatically degraded to the H 2 O and O 2 after relative short time of injection. An effective disinfection time was 60 min, with an initial 15 min injection, followed by a 45 min incubation, during which VHP degradation is occurring.",

The concentration of VHP is the direct factor of influencing the disinfection effect. Thus the air flow and fan power used in the cabinet is of critical importance. Although the distributed ventilation technology was adopted in the development of fumigation cabinet, the concentration of VHP in each position is not uniform, which may be related to the placement of four PPRPHs leading to the creation of four small cavities. Future studies should focus on the influence of airflow patterns on the concentration of VHP in such a nested structure to make the concentration of VHP more uniform.",
