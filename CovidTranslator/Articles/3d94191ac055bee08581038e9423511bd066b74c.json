Accurate diagnosis is essential: Acute streptococcal pharyngitis warrants diagnosis and therapy to ensure prevention of serious suppurative and nonsuppurative complications. Life-threatening infectious complications of oropharyngeal infections, whether streptococcal or nonstreptococcal, may manifest with mouth pain, pharyngitis, parapharyngeal space infectious extension, and/or airway obstruction (Tables 1.4 and 1.5). In many cases, the history and/or physical exam can help direct diagnosis and treatment, but the enormous number of potential causes is too large to address all of them.",

Some cause distinct clinical syndromes that are readily diagnosed without laboratory testing (Table 1.6; see also Tables 1.1 and 1.4). In pharyngitis caused by parainfluenza and influenza viruses, rhinoviruses, coronaviruses, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), the symptoms of coryza and cough often overshadow sore throat, which is generally mild. Influenza virus may cause high fever, cough, headache, malaise, myalgia, and cervical adenopathy in addition to pharyngitis. In young children, croup or bronchiolitis may develop. When influenza is suspected on clinical and epidemiologic grounds or confirmed by testing (polymerase chain reaction [PCR] is most accurate), specific antiviral therapy is available for treatment of patients and prophylaxis of family members. RSV is associated with bronchiolitis, pneumonia, and croup in young children. RSV infection in older children is usually indistinguishable from a simple upper respiratory tract infection. Pharyngitis is not a prominent finding of RSV infection in any age group. Parainfluenza viruses are associated with croup and bronchiolitis; minor sore throat and signs of pharyngitis are common at the outset but rapidly resolve. Infections caused by parainfluenza, influenza, and RSV are often seen in seasonal (winter) epidemics. Many agents can be identified using multiplex or targeted PCR testing, but there is rarely reason to test outpatients and infrequent benefit to testing inpatients except to confirm and treat influenza.",

Acute infectious mononucleosis is usually associated with a positive heterophile test result and antibody to VCA and EA ( Fig. 1.2) . The findings of acute exudative pharyngitis together with hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, and generalized lymphadenopathy suggest infectious mononucleosis. Early in the disease and in cases without liver or spleen enlargement, differentiation from other causes of pharyngitis, including streptococcal pharyngitis, is difficult. Indeed, a small number of patients with infectious mononucleosis have a throat culture positive for group A streptococci. (They are likely streptococcal carriers; see subsequent text.) An indistinguishable syndrome can occur with cytomegalovirus, but differentiation is rarely of clinical importance. Serologic evidence of mononucleosis should be sought to oral prednisone or cimetidine. There are reports of improvement after tonsillectomy.

Antibiotic therapy also reduces the incidence of suppurative sequelae of GAS pharyngitis, such as peritonsillar abscess and cervical adenitis. In addition, treatment produces a more rapid resolution of signs and symptoms and terminates contagiousness within 24 hours. For these reasons, antibiotics should be instituted as soon as the diagnosis is supported by laboratory studies. There are numerous antibiotics available for treating streptococcal pharyngitis (Table 1 .9). The drugs of choice are penicillin and amoxicillin. Despite the widespread use of penicillin to treat streptococcal and other infections for many decades, resistance of GAS to penicillin or any other \u03b2-lactam antibiotic has not developed. Amoxicillin has been demonstrated to be effective in eradicating GAS when given by mouth once daily for 10 days. The convenience of once-daily dosing and palatability make amoxicillin an attractive approach despite its somewhat broader spectrum of antimicrobial activity. Penicillin can be given by mouth twice daily for 10 days or intramuscularly as a single injection of benzathine penicillin. Intramuscular benzathine penicillin alleviates concerns about patient compliance. A less painful parenteral alternative is benzathine penicillin in combination with procaine penicillin. Intramuscular procaine penicillin alone is not effective for prevention of ARF because adequate levels of penicillin are not present in blood and tissues for a sufficient time. Other \u03b2-lactams, including semisynthetic derivatives of penicillin and the cephalosporins, are at least as effective as penicillin for treating streptococcal pharyngitis. The broader spectrum of the cephalosporins and their higher cost relegate them to second-line status. The decreased dosing frequency of amoxicillin and some cephalosporins may improve patient adherence.",

Peritonsillar abscess (\"quinsy\") manifests with fever, severe throat pain, dysphagia, \"hot potato voice,\" pain referred to the ear, and bulging of the peritonsillar area with asymmetry of the tonsils and sometimes displacement of the uvula (Fig. 1.4 ; see also Table 1 .4). There can be peritonsillar cellulitis without a well-defined abscess cavity. Trismus may be present. When an abscess is found clinically or by an imaging study such as a computed tomographic (CT) scan, surgical drainage is indicated. Peritonsillar abscess occurs most commonly in older children and adolescents. Retropharyngeal abscess represents extension of an infection from the pharynx or peritonsillar region into the retropharyngeal (prevertebral) space, which is rich in lymphoid structures (Figs. 1.5 and 1.6; see also Table 1 .4). Children younger than 4 years old are most often affected. Fever, dysphagia, drooling, stridor, extension of the neck, and a mass in the posterior pharyngeal wall may be noted. Surgical drainage is often required if frank suppuration has occurred. Spread of GAS via pharyngeal lymphatic vessels to regional nodes can cause cervical lymphadenitis. The markedly swollen and tender anterior cervical nodes that result can suppurate. Otitis media, mastoiditis, and sinusitis also may occur as complications of GAS pharyngitis. Additional parapharyngeal suppurative infections that may mimic streptococcal disease are noted in Table 1 .4. Furthermore, any pharyngeal infectious process may produce torticollis if there is inflammation that extends to the paraspinal muscles and ligaments, producing pain, spasm, and, on occasion, rotary subluxation of the cervical spine. Oropharyngeal torticollis lasts less than 2 weeks and is not associated with abnormal neurologic signs or pain over the spinous process. Invasive sterile site or bacteremic infection with GAS is unusual as sequelae to pharyngitis.",

Some of these patients may be chronic pharyngeal carriers of GAS who are suffering from a new superimposed viral infection; others may have been nonadherent to therapy.

Prevalence in studies in Europe is reported to be about 10% in patients with pharyngitis not caused by GAS, but large surveillance studies have not been performed. In a U.S. study of students at a university health clinic, F. necrophorum was detected by PCR in 20.5% of patients with pharyngitis and 9.4% of an asymptomatic convenience sample; some had more than one bacterium detected by PCR of throat swabs. Many of the pharyngitis patients with F. necrophorum had signs and symptoms indistinguishable from patients with increased likelihood for GAS pharyngitis: About onethird had fever, one-third had tonsillar exudates, two-thirds had anterior cervical adenopathy, and most did not have cough. The symptomatic overlap of F. necrophorum and GAS and the presence of asymptomatic carriage could complicate the clinical assessment of sore throat in adolescents but F. necrophorum is difficult to culture from the throat and neither a rapid test nor PCR is available for use in clinical care. F. necrophorum pharyngitis can be associated with development of septic thrombophlebitis of the internal jugular vein, known as Lemierre syndrome ( Fig. 1.8) . Approximately 80% of cases of Lemierre syndrome are due to this bacterium, but the proportion of patients infected or colonized with F. necrophorum who develop pharyngitis and Lemierre syndrome is unknown. Patients present initially with fever, sore throat, exudative pharyngitis, and/or peritonsillar abscess. The symptoms persist, severe neck pain and swelling develop, and the patient appears toxic. Septic shock may ensue along with metastatic complications, especially septic pulmonary emboli. Diagnosis is confirmed by computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging of the neck and isolation of the organism on anaerobic blood culture. F. necrophorum is usually sensitive in vitro to penicillin, but some isolates produce \u03b2-lactamases, and treatment failure with penicillin has been reported. Many expert clinicians use metronidazole, clindamycin, a \u03b2-lactam in combination with a \u03b2-lactamase inhibitor (such as ampicillin-sulbactam), or a carbapenem. The septic thrombophlebitis of Lemierre syndrome can be polymicrobial; combination antibiotic therapy may be beneficial. Some patients require surgical debridement and/or incision and drainage.
