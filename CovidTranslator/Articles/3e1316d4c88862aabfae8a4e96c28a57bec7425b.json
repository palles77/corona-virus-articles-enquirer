The results demonstrate that the randomly unpredictable amino acid pairs are more sensitive to the mutations. The larger is the difference between actual and predicted frequencies, the higher is the chance of mutation occurring. The effect induced by mutations is to reduce the difference between actual and predicted frequencies. The amino acid pairs whose actual frequencies are larger than their predicted frequencies are more likely to be targeted by mutations, whereas the amino acid pairs whose actual frequencies are smaller than their predicted frequencies are more likely to be formed after mutations. These findings are identical to our several recent studies, i.e. the mutations represent a process of degeneration inducing human diseases.",

This is possible because the accumulating evidence shows that there are several mutations in SARS related coronavirus (SARS-CoV). So far 15 point mutations have been documented in SARS-CoV proteins: two in the 221 amino-acid-long membrane glycoprotein [2, 15, 17, 19, 24] , three in the 1255 amino-acid-long spike glycoprotein [2, 15, 17, 24] and ten in the 7073 amino-acid-long replicase polyprotein [2, 8, 11, [15] [16] [17] 24] . Naturally we would expect these three SARS-CoV proteins to have other forms of mutations rather than those documented, and the new mutations would lead to the difficulties in diagnosis and treatment of SARS.",

The spike proteins of coronaviruses are large, type I membrane glycoproteins that are responsible for both binding to receptors on host cells and for membrane fusion. The spike proteins of some coronaviruses are cleaved into S1 and S2 subunits. S proteins also contain important virus-neutralizing epitopes, and amino acid changes in the spike proteins can dramatically affect the virulence and in vitro host cell tropism of the virus [6, 7, 22] . Still at present it is only the spike glycoprotein, in which a considerable amount of mutations has been documented. Using the Blastp program to align three spike glycoproteins from humans, we find little cue on the likelihood of which amino acid would mutate in SARS spike glycoprotein.",

            "text": "the third row shows how many types do not appear. From the viewpoint of amino acid pairs, no matter the length of a protein is, the number of its theoretically possible types cannot be more than 400, and therefore the difference between proteins is either how many types of theoretically possible amino acid pairs appear or how many times a theoretically possible type of amino acid pair repeats or both. Table 1 shows 59, 86 and 66 types are absent from the spike protein of SARS-CoV, strain 229E and strain OC43 (third row in the Table) , respectively. Still Table 1 shows that 76, 78 and 61 types appear once in the spike protein of SARS-CoV, strain 229E and strain OC43 (fourth row in the Table) , respectively, and so on. The absent types include 17 randomly predictable and 42 randomly unpredictable with regard to SARS-CoV spike protein, 37 randomly predictable and 49 randomly unpredictable with regard to strain 229E spike protein, and 12 randomly predictable and 54 randomly unpredictable with regard to strain OC43 spike protein. Still we can classify the present amino acid pairs as randomly predictable and unpredictable with respect to theoretically possible types and pairs, because some theoretically possible types appear many times (from row 5 to row 23 in Table 1 ). The columns 3, 4, 5 and 6 in Table 2 show how many predictable and unpredictable types and pairs in human spike proteins. When corresponding the position of each mutation to predictable pairs and unpredictable pairs, we find that a vast majority of mutations occurs at the unpredictable pairs (columns 7, 8, 9 and 10 in Table 2 ). Fig. 1 shows the ratios of frequency difference (AF\u2212PF) versus mutation number per each type of substituted amino acid pairs in spike proteins. It can be seen that there is a general tendency in the ratios, i.e. the larger the difference, the higher the chance of mutation occurring. Therefore, the difference between actual and predicted frequencies indicates the potential chance of mutation occurring in amino acid pairs. As the point missense mutations substitute one type of amino acid to another one, we can gain some insight into the mutation tendency after comparing the difference between actual and predicted frequencies in substituted and substituting amino acid pairs. For the numerical analysis, we calculate the difference between actual frequency (AF) and predicted frequency (PF) in amino acid pairs before and after mutation, i.e. (AF\u2212PF). For instance, a mutation at position 244 substitutes \"I\" to \"T\" which results in two amino acid pairs \"DI\" and \"IW\" changing to \"DT\" and \"TW\", because the amino acid is \"D\" at position 243 and \"W\" at position 245. The actual frequency and predicted frequency are 7 and 5 for \"DI\", 1 and 1 for \"IW\", 2 and 6 for \"DT\", and 0 and 1 for \"TW\", respectively. Thus, the difference between actual frequency and predicted frequency is 2 with regard to the substituted amino acid pairs, i.e. pairs affected by mutations. Fig. 2 shows the difference between actual and predicted frequencies in both substituted and substituting amino acid pairs in spike proteins. It can be seen that the substituting pairs distribute more centrally and symmetrically than the substituted pairs do. The sum of differences between actual and predicted frequencies is statistically smaller in substituting amino acid pairs than in substituted ones in Table 3 (the Student's t-test, P < 0.05). These statistical differences suggest that the mutations lead to the deduction of difference between actual and predicted frequencies. From a probabilistic viewpoint, this means that the mutations are more likely to occur, and these findings are similar to the results in our recent studies [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] . As mentioned in Section 2, the actual frequency can be equal to, larger than or smaller than the predicted frequency. Accordingly we can look at these relationships with respect to the substituted (Table 4 ) and substituting (Table 5) pairs. Table 4 reveals that more than 75% of mutations occur at the pairs, whose actual frequency is larger than their pre- Table 5 Classification of substituting amino acid pairs with respect to mutations in the spike proteins from different human coronaviruses dicted frequency in one or both substituted pairs (the first three rows in unpredictable pairs). Comparing the first three rows with the last two rows in unpredictable pairs, we can see that the mutations are more likely to target the pairs whose actual frequencies are larger than predicted frequencies. Therefore, Table 4 suggests which type of amino acid pairs are more likely to be substituted, i.e. the different sensitivities of amino acid pairs to mutations in spike proteins. Table 5 shows in which types of amino acid pairs the mutations are likely or unlikely to form in spike proteins. We can find that more than 60% of mutations result in one or both substituting pairs whose actual frequencies are smaller than their predicted frequencies. Taking the results in both  Tables 3 and 4 into account, the mutations are likely to attack the pairs whose actual frequencies are larger than their predicted ones and the consequences of mutations are likely to form the pairs whose actual frequencies are smaller than their predicted ones. In such a manner, the mutations reduce the difference between actual and predicted frequencies (Fig. 2) .",

Firstly, the present results demonstrate that the randomly unpredictable amino acid pairs are more sensitive to the mutations (Table 2) , although these 3 spike proteins are constructed by different types of amino acid pairs which repeat different times (Table 1) . Furthermore, the larger the difference between actual and predicted frequencies is, the higher the chance of mutation occurring is (Fig. 1) . The effect induced by mutations is to reduce the difference between ac-tual and predicted frequencies (Fig. 2) . Finally, the amino acid pairs whose actual frequencies are larger than their predicted frequencies are more likely to be targeted by mutations (Table 4) , whereas the amino acid pairs whose actual frequencies are smaller than their predicted frequencies are more likely to be formed after mutations (Table 5 ). These findings are identical to our recently publications [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] .",

Table 6 lists the amino acid pairs with the frequency difference being larger than 3 in spike protein from SARS-CoV, as these amino acid pairs seem to be more vulnerable to mutations (Fig. 1 ). With these sensitive amino acid pairs in mind, we can easily determine their positions. For example, the \"NF\"s are located at positions 129-130, 178-179, 230-231, 304-305, 526-527, 528-529, 699-700, 783-784, 951-952, 1056-1057 and 1090-1091 in spike protein from SARS-CoV. Moreover we notice that Table 6 Amino acid pairs being more likely to be targeted by mutation in the spike protein from human SARS-CoV Difference between actual and predicted frequencies the positions of \"FN\"s overlap with \"NF\"s at positions from 526 to 530, at which the highly possible mutations would be more likely to occur. This hypothesis can be supported by the mutations found in other proteins, such as human collagen \u24235(IV) chain precursor [29] , p53 protein [34] and so on. In such a manner, we could predict the potential mutations in the spike protein from human SARS-CoV with possible amino acid pairs and positions.",
