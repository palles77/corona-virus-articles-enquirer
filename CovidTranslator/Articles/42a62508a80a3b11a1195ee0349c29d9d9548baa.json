By this, the effect of their cell-free supernatants as well as of certain species-related metabolites (sakacin A, nisin, and lactic acid) was investigated on different viruses after exposure at 24\u00b0C for 3 days. Viruses were incubated with supernatants and metabolites in a dilution ratio of 1:10. Data for antiviral effects towards murine norovirus S99 (MNV), influenza A virus A/WSN/ 33 (H1N1), Newcastle disease virus Montana (NDV) and feline herpesvirus KS 285 (FHV) were generated in vitro simulating pH and temperature conditions according to raw sausage fermentations. Investigations showed no antiviral effect of sakacin A and nisin on MNV, H1N1, FHV and NDV. Furthermore, the antiviral potential of D,L-lactic acid was determined for MNV and H1N1. At raw sausagerelated pH values (5.0-6.2) it could be shown that the virus titre for MNV and H1N1 was reduced by a maximum of 3.25 log and 2.5 log units, respectively. In addition, 29 culture supernatants of different bacteria species, mainly LAB and staphylococci, were tested for their antiviral activity against MNV. Only the cell-free supernatant of a Lb. curvatus strain showed a higher virus titre reduction of MNV by 1.25 log units compared to the control. Further studies on the characterisation of this cell-free supernatant were carried out, however, the antiviral substance could not be identified so far.",

For example, use of starter cultures [e.g., lactic acid bacteria (LAB), staphylococci, and micrococci] for microbial fermentation is a crucial step to obtain microbiological safety of short fermented raw sausages as it can prevent growth of pathogenic microorganisms in these products. For that, starter cultures must be quickly increased at the initial ripening time (Luecke and Hechelmann 1985) . They contribute to an improvement in hygienic safety, high and constant levels of quality, shelflife and sensory attractiveness (Hammes and Knauf 1994) . Besides the positive effect of improving organoleptic properties, different microorganisms are used as protective cultures (Abee et al. 1995) . They compete with other organisms about nutrition and are able to produce antimicrobial substances like organic acid, hydrogen peroxide, diacetyl or bacteriocins (Jay 1982a, b; Kroeckel 1998 ).",

Carl Roth, T196,) and filtrated through a 0.22 lm PES diaphragma (TPP Techno Plastic Products AG, Trasadingen, Switzerland, 99722). Altogether, the antiviral potential of 29 cell-free supernatants originated from species listed in Table 1 was tested on the infectivity of MNV. MNV was incubated in a dilution ratio of 1:10 with the supernatant for 3 days at 24\u00b0C (pH 6.2). The virus titre reductions of all experiments were compared to the control (native MRS-/ brain heart broth with MNV). The pH value (Symp Hony SB 70P, VWR International) was controlled in all assays before and after 3 days of incubation. Because of the results derived from the screening of bacterial supernatants, where an effect of Lb. curvatus 1 for MNV was detected, further studies were carried out using different methods of treatments to identify possible antiviral substances. The supernatant was frozen (-21\u00b0C, 1 h), heated (100\u00b0C, 10 min) and treated with bovine liver catalase to exclude an inhibition due to hydrogen peroxide production. These experiments were repeated once. In addition, catalase treatment of the supernatant was performed four times. In three tests, 2 ll catalase/ml supernatant (equivalent to 68 U/ml, Sigma-Aldrich Chemie GmbH, Steinheim, Germany, C1345-1G) was used and in a fourth experiment the catalase volume per ml was doubled. Furthermore, the supernatant was separated according to different molecular weights. For this purpose VIVACON \u00d2 500 concentrators with membrane cut offs by 2, 10, 30, 50 and 100 kDa (VWR International GmbH, Darmstadt, Germany, 518-0010/0011) were used. This experiment was performed twice. The virus titre reductions of all experiments were controlled regarding their significant differences compared to the control (native MRS broth with MNV) and the untreated cell-free supernatant of Lb. curvatus 1 (native supernatant) with MNV. For each test, the mean reduction of the virus titre was determined from each of five sample approaches.",

The bacteriocins sakacin A and nisin did not reduce the infectivity of MNV, H1N1, FHV and NDV. It can be seen in Table 2 that the mean virus titre reductions did not greatly differ from their controls. Different high bacteriocin activities (400-25.600 AU/ml) in the test series had no additional effect on the virus titre (data not shown). In all trials, the adjusted pH value (6.2) was stable before and after incubation. Thus, a statement regarding an effect on the viral envelope could not be made. Moreover, a direct transfer of these results to food is not possible and further studies should be carried out.

Therefore, the effect of D,Llactic acid on MNV and H1N1 was examined. The mean reduction of virus titres in comparison to values obtained at pH 6.2 is shown in Fig. 2 . The virus titre was reduced between pH values of 5.0 and 6.2 by a maximum of 3.25 log units (MNV) and 2.5 log units (H1N1), respectively. The pH values did not differ from each other immediately and after 3 days of the exposure. All samples without virus were assessed as not cytotoxic. Also Straube et al. (2010) could detect a virus inactivation of influenza A viruses (H3N8) with lactic acid. However, it is known that the inactivation of influenza by acid depends on the different subtypes (Scholtissek 1985) . Therefore, a direct transfer of the results to another subtype is limited. According to the results, it could be assumed that the pH decrease in fermented food like raw sausages could be an effective measure for risk reduction concerning viruses. An application of starter cultures with rapid and high acidification might improve the safety of raw sausages in relation to viral pathogens. However, investigations in fermented sausages with lactic acid should be carried out to confirm this. However, the obtained results of our study concerning MNV S99 are contrary to those of Cannon et al. (2006) . They determined virus titre reductions of less than 1 log unit at pH 2 only, by exposing MNV-1 in buffered solutions (citrate buffer, phosphate buffer and carbonate buffer) of certain pH values from 2 to 10 for up to 2 h. A reason for different results could be the use of different test systems for the detection of viral infectivity. While Cannon et al. (2006) used the plaque assay, in the present study the cytopathic effect was visually determined using the endpoint dilution assay. Another possible reason for contrary results could be the use of different virus strains. Therefore, a direct transfer of the results to another strain is not possible.",

Only the cell-free supernatant of Lb. curvatus 1 showed a higher virus titre reduction of the MNV by 1.25 log units in comparison to the control. This antiviral effect was confirmed by five trials. Furthermore, it was verified that the mean virus titre reduction of MNV differed significantly from the control (p \\ 0.05). This supposes a bacterial strain-specific production of antiviral metabolites (Botic et al. 2007 ). Further investigations were carried out for determination of the antiviral properties of the cell-free supernatant. No significant antiviral effect could be obtained anymore (p [ 0.05) after heating, whereas freezing did not significantly influence the antiviral effect on MNV compared to the native cell-free supernatant (p [ 0.05). Therefore it might be assumed that the antiviral substance is of proteinaceous nature. An effect by hydrogen peroxide, often produced by different LAB, can be excluded by catalase treatment, because it did not significantly influence the antiviral effect of the supernatant on MNV (p [ 0.05) (Fig. 3) . Moreover, the cell-free supernatant was separated according to different molecular weights. All collected fractions from 2 to 100 kDa exhibited the same significant antiviral effect (p = 0.02) like the entire supernatant.
