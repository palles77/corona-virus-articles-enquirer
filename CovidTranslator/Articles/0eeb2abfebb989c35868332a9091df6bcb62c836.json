This article investigated the long-term impact of food crises on the financial performance of restaurant firms and identified the factors that influenced this impact. This explanatory study examined the case of Jack in the Box, whose 1993 Escherichia coli scare was the first and largest restaurant-associated food crisis in modern times. An event study method was used to uncover stock price movements of Jack in the Box, in conjunction with 73 unrelated food crises that occurred from 1994 to 2010. Stock prices of Jack in the Box exhibited significantly negative responses to other firms' food crises, moreover, the negative spillover effect was stronger if the crisis occurred closer in time, was similar in nature, and was accompanied with no recall execution. These findings shed light on the long-term financial impact of food crises and offer insights for crisis managers to develop more effective crisis management strategies.",

In this context, a spillover effect refers to the phenomenon in which information about brand A influences a consumer's beliefs regarding brand B, even if the impact is not explicit (Ahluwalia et al., 2001) . Previous research has demonstrated the presence of spillover effect within the same brand family or product category (Balachander and Ghose, 2003) , across product categories (Erdem, 1998) , and from one product attribute to another (Ahluwalia et al., 2001) . However, researchers have paid little attention to spillover effect at the firm level, which occurs across companies in the same category. For example, negative publicity regarding an Escherichia coli (E. coli hereafter) scare at Wendy's may negatively affect Jack in the Box, because of the indirect influence of negative publicity and the latter restaurant's prior association with E. coli.",

During rival firms' crises, competitors can grab more market shares (Tsang, 2000; van Heerde et al., 2007) and increase consumer awareness through aggressive advertising (Dawar, 1998) . Roehm and Tybout (2006) also find a negative spillover effect, demonstrating that negative consumer perceptions about one brand can spill over to competing brands in the same product category. Moreover, when a firm A has a crisis history, the advantage of being a competitor during a firm B's (rival firm) crisis may be offset by negative associations between the firm A and a crisis of firm B. In this respect, a rival's product harm crisis may become a threat if the firm is associated with a negative past event.",

Because 59% of all reported foodborne illness outbreaks in the United States are attributed to the restaurant industry (CDC, 2006) , it is critical to investigate possible negative spillovers among restaurant firms.

Those incidents caused illnesses and deaths, resulted in negative consumer perceptions of quality, decreased sales revenues, tarnished firm reputations, and lower marketing efficiency (Dawar and Pillutla, 2000; van Heerde et al., 2007) . Coombs (2004) suggested that despite its disastrous results, the unexpected and accidental nature of a crisis can serve as a cushion for affected firms in rebuilding consumer trust. However, empirical evidence shows that the media tend to report on past crises in relation to similar crises for very long time. For example, it is common for E. coli-related media reports to cite Jack in the Box as an example, though the event occurred 18 years ago. Fig. 1 displays the number of news articles containing words \"Jack in the Box\" and \"E. coli\" using LexisNexis database, evidencing that Jack in the Box still appears in media reporting in relation to E. coli up to present.",

Psychological research asserts that people access negative memories more easily and quickly than positive memories (Richins, 1983) . Brands also depend heavily on publicity through widespread mass media, yet negative publicity is more powerful and salient in media reporting than positive publicity (Weinberger et al., 1991) . Constant negative publicity can drive firms into a downward spiral (Weinberger and Romeo, 1989) , and media attention may make a crisis more visible to the general public (Ahluwalia et al., 2000) . In responding to other firms' food crises, a firm with a food crisis history may be affected by unrelated crises, that is, by a negative spillover effect. Seo et al. (2013) examined the impact of food safety events on firms, asserting that it takes approximately one year to recover from a crisis after an outbreak. Although their study investigated the impact of food crises on firms' financial performance, the findings were limited to short-term impacts. To identify the long-term impact, the current study features an exploratory case study, using Jack in the Box, and investigates whether the firm's stock prices have been influenced by other restaurant firms' food crises between 1994 and 2010. In addition, this study empirically tests for the presence of negative spillover on Jack in the Box's stock returns, while attempting to quantify the magnitude of spillover effect in terms of time, similarity, and recall execution.",

Initially, researchers considered positive side effects from line or brand extension strategies (Balachander and Ghose, 2003) . When spillover occurs within a brand family, information or perceptions about existing products transfer to newly launched products that use the same brand name, which ideally results in rapidly built consumer loyalty. Marketing practitioners cultivate brand relatedness and strength in their brand portfolio to increase marketing efficiency through positive spillovers.",

Unexpected product harm crises or brand scandals may evoke a negative spillover effect on the products or brands if consumers perceive that products in a brand family share similar quality standards and brand images (Lei et al., 2008) . Moreover, Dahlen and Lange (2006) found that a disaster for one brand can be \"contagious,\" such that it influences both the product category and competing brands. As brands come to depend more on publicity, the possibility of negative spillovers onto competitors when a firm experiences a crisis also increases. For example, even if brand A has little to do with the crisis associated with brand B, it may still be affected by negative publicity if there is any association between the two brands.",

Furthermore, Vassilikopoulou et al. (2009) assert that time significantly influences consumers' perceptions, attitudes, and intentions. Consumers thus perceive less danger and adopt better impressions and future purchase intentions one year after a crisis, such that time helps reduce the negative effects of a crisis on consumer responses. Crisis managers then may expect to observe a time effect, by which consumers are less likely to recall a past negative event over time. Accordingly, a firm may be able to recover from a crisis.

            "text": "The accessibility-diagnosticity framework offers a theoretical explanation of this negative spillover effect (Feldman and Lynch, 1988) . The framework describes how the negative image of one brand spills over to perceptions of other brands if there is a strong association between them. When consumers consider brand A informative about brand B, its image influences perceptions of brand B. The framework also indicates that product similarity increases diagnosticity and accessibility (Feldman and Lynch, 1988) . For example, attribute-level similarities have a greater effect than overall product similarity does on consumer perceptions (Broniarczyk and Alba, 1994; Roehm and Tybout, 2006) . Moreover, categorization theory asserts that product similarity provides strong cues for categorization, which lead to higher levels of both diagnosticity and accessibility (Mervis and Rosch, 1981; Sujan, 1985) . Resonance theory, which explains cognitiveoriented activities in information processing, indicates that greater correspondence induces a stronger resonance effect (Wan, 2008) . It also supports the notion that the spillover effect is promoted by product similarity. Thus, when Lei et al. (2008) examined the effects of the strength and directionality of brand relatedness on spillovers within a brand family, they found that negative spillover within a brand family was stronger and more salient with a higher number of associations. Furthermore, Janakiraman et al. (2009) extended the scope of this research to a product category and tested negative spillover effects on competing brands. They found a moderating effect of product/brand similarity on perception spillovers, revealing that perception spillovers occurred when brands were sufficiently similar. Thus, this study proposes the effect of similarity in terms of operation type and type of foodborne illness on negative spillover effect on Jack in the Box:",

Thomsen and McKenzie (2001) found significant negative returns of food companies following food recalls, and Chen et al. (2009) supported that proactive recall strategies caused more negative stock returns compared to that of passive recall strategies. In contrast, previous literature suggested positive consequences of recall execution such as increasing perceived responsiveness of a firm, reducing consumers' risk perception, and maintaining future purchase intentions (Dawar and Pillutla, 2000; Siomkos and Kurzbard, 1994) . More importantly, while previous research focused on the effect of recall strategy on a firm that announces the recall, the effect of recall announcement on other firms has not been explored.",

When a firm A deals with a crisis, the event may influence the stock returns of a firm B which is in the same industry with a firm A due to the high correlation that exists between firms in the same industry. The market evaluation of a firm A becomes a determinant of evaluation of a firm B by market investors. In this sense, a recall announcement of a hospitality firm A may become a driver influencing market evaluations of a hospitality firm B especially when the firm B has a past crisis history. Considering the positive effect of recall execution in reducing consumers' risk perception (Dawar and Pillutla, 2000; Siomkos and Kurzbard, 1994) , an announcement of a hospitality firm recalling suspected products may be perceived as positive signal by market investors which may reduce negative spillovers on other hospitality firms. In this sense, the recall execution may become a good news for other hospitality firms because investors perceive less risk with product recalls than without recalls.

However, accounting measures lack technical robustness, because some accounting data are only available on a quarterly basis. In addition, accounting measures reflect the impacts of both firm-and market-specific events, making it difficult to tease out the impact of firm-specific events. Coombs (2004) uses a scenario-based survey to examine the impact of crisis history on consumers' perceptions of crises. Although Coombs reports significant findings, such as an intensifying effect of a past crisis on consumers' responses, measuring consumer intentions cannot fully capture the impact on associated firms. In contrast, event studies that investigate stock price movements (Chang and Zeng, 2011; Chen et al., 2007; Salin and Hooker, 2001) suggest that market measures capture immediate and direct reactions to crisis outbreaks. According to the efficient market hypothesis, changes in stock prices represent the economic impacts of a particular event, based on the market's evaluation of the firm's future cash flows (Fama, 1970) . Thus, stock returns were selected for the current study to measure the economic impact of food crises on an associated firm.",

It is not desirable to use the method when the event dates are not precise and when events are not price-sensitive because the impacts may not be incorporated into stock prices (Brown and Warner, 1980) . In addition, although most event studies rely on parametric test statistics, the parametric tests are considered to lack detailed assumptions about the probability distribution of returns. Instead, the use of non-parametric tests such as sign test and rank test is suggested by Cowan (1992) to ensure the results of parametric test statistics. In order to overcome such shortfalls of using event study method, the current study identifies the event dates using Marler Clark's website while cross-referencing the Lexis-Nexis database. To eliminate the confounding effects, treatments are made as explained in the methodology section. Lastly, both parametric and non-parametric tests are performed to confirm the reported test results as suggested by Peterson (1989) .",

For example, Chen et al. (2007) examined the impact of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreaks on the stock returns of seven hotels in Taiwan within one month after the outbreak. Salin and Hooker (2001) investigated the influence of food recalls on stock prices of four food-related firms after 10, 20, 30 and 40 days since the recall announcements. In addition, hospitality research investigated the impact of fed policy announcements (Chen, 2012) , terrorist activities (Chang and Zeng, 2011) , and IT news (Lee and Connolly, 2010) on hospitality stock returns. Although a number of studies examined the short-term impact of crises or events, research on the long-term effects of a food crisis is lacking. Thus, the current study investigates the longterm impact of food crises on a firm with a past crisis history.",

(2007) examined the impact of product harm crises on marketing efficiency by using Kraft Food Australia's 1996 salmonella food poisoning case. Rittichainuwat (2006) also used a case study of the tsunami that hit Thailand in 2004 to examine how the tourism industry recovers from natural disasters. In turn, this study examines the negative spillover effects reflected in stock returns due to food crises, using a case study of Jack in the Box, by adopting ESM.",

In January 1993, Jack in the Box suffered a major corporate crisis from an E. coli outbreak that gained tremendous media attention and shocked millions of customers. The Jack in the Box E. coli outbreak remains the largest and deadliest food crisis associated with restaurants. It resulted in the deaths of four children and sickened more than 700 people in multiple states. Jack in the Box lost millions of dollars in sales and revenue as a result of the crisis (Braun-latour et al., 2006) . As an effort to recover its brand image and regain consumer confidence, Jack in the Box took several responsive recovery actions, including recalling products, closing restaurants, retraining employees, and conducting several nationwide marketing campaigns (Israeli, 2007) . By the mid-1990s, those efforts were largely successful such as increases in sales and revenue, and in 1997, the lawsuits came to a close. In 2004, Jack in the Box became a recipient of the \"Black Pearl\" award for innovations in food safety and quality. Accordingly, it is frequently considered a successful case of recovering from a food-related crisis. However, are there possible negative spillovers from other firms' food crises on Jack in the Box? or did Jack in the Box fully recover from the devastating memory of E. coli?",

Second, any cases overlapped with significant events of Jack in the Box were removed from the data. The events of Jack in the Box included announcements of implementing HACCP (Hazard Analysis & Critical Control Points) to manage food safety and quality of foods, changing the company name from Foodmaker to Jack in the Box Inc, conducting a new advertising campaign, and winning food safety award during the period from 1993 to 2010 (Miller, 2007) .

In addition, with an estimation window of 275 trading days, or one calendar year, ending 20 days before the event, we calculated market returns using an equal-weighted index (Cowan, 2003) . By using the daily stock returns for Jack in the Box and market returns obtained from CRSP data files, both ARs and CARs were calculated. Following Brown and Warner (1980) , a market model was chosen to obtain the estimates of expected returns.",

As ESM specifies, AR refers to the difference between actual and expected returns, such that it can reflect the isolated effects of a firm-specific event, separate from overall market movements. In the current study, AR is calculated as the average value of JACK's stock prices in response to 73 events. We calculated CAR as the sum of daily ARs (Eq. (5)). For example, CAR 1 is calculated as the sum of AR on day 0 and AR on day 1, CAR 2 is the sum of AR on day 0, AR on day 1, and AR on day 2.

Unlike previous studies using a regression analysis for cross-sectional analysis (Borde et al., 1999; Chang and Zeng, 2011) , this study used ANCOVA because of dichotomized nature of testing variables as well as the benefit of ANCOVA in showing the pattern of changes in ARs and CARs over time.

Following the same data collection procedure used for JACK, we obtained historical stock prices for the four restaurant firms from CRSP in line with previous literature (Chen et al., 2009) . In order to eliminate the confounding effect, any cases within the period of 10 days before and after foodborne illness outbreaks of Wendy's, Darden, Yum, and McDonald's were removed from data prior to the analysis. Those events include, for instance, foodborne illnesses associated with McDonald's in 1998 , Wendy's in 2000 , KFC in 2002 , Olive Garden in 2005 , and Taco Bell in 2006 . This elimination enables us to remove the possibility of negative spillover of other firms on themselves regardless of the influence of Jack in the Box. The ARs and CARs of the four restaurant firms (hereafter, OTHER) were calculated using the same event windows to determine whether the changes in ARs and CARs for OTHER differed from those for JACK. To test the significance of this difference, we also performed a one-way ANOVA. Fig. 3 . Significance of ARs and CARs of Jack in the Box in response to 73 other food crises.

The results imply that the negative spillover effect on JACK was much more pronounced than on OTHER.

Following the accessibility-diagnosticity framework (Feldman and Lynch, 1988) , the greater the similarity between a later crisis and the earlier Jack in the Box crisis, the stronger the negative spillover affects Jack in the Box. Consumers likely perceive stronger linkages between the current crisis and a past crisis if they are similar, which may result in stronger spillover effects on the firm with a crisis history. Therefore, if a crisis occurs in another firm that is similar to the firm's past crisis, a crisis manager must engage in crisis management efforts.

Although the current study did not examined the direct relationship between recall execution and negative spillover, the results of CARs responding to recall execution imply that stock returns are positively influenced by others' recall announcements. When a hospitality firm announces a recall strategy, the recall is perceived as positive by investors which positively influence the market evaluation of other firms in the hospitality industry. The finding on the effect of recall execution is interesting considering previous literature emphasizing the negative consequences of recall announcement on stock returns (Chen et al., 2009; Thomsen and McKenzie, 2001) . Although the recall announcement can threat stock returns of a hospitality firm suffering from their own crisis, the recall can be a positive signal to other firms in the hospitality industry. Given the positive consequences of recall execution, effective communication among hospitality firms during crises becomes more crucial to protect each other during one's crisis.",

Such intensified impact of crises was detected earlier by Chen et al.

The present study shed lights on the hidden long-term impacts from food crises on hospitality firms by providing empirical results opposing the widely known successful story of Jack in the Box. Whether a firm has a past crisis history is considered a critical factor in Situational crisis communication theory (SCCT), influencing the type of appropriate crisis response strategies (Coombs, 2004) . Considering that the SCCT model deals with the crisis of own company, the model can be extended by including factors influencing the negative spillover from others' crises. Further, the appropriate crisis response strategies to others' crises can be designed accordingly. Moreover, unlike previous research focusing on short-term impacts of crises, the examination on the long-term impact of crisis enriches the crisisrelated hospitality literature. The idea of negative spillover effect in a long-term perspective can be further applied to other crises threatening the hospitality industry such as natural disasters and business fraud. In addition, the magnitude of negative spillover effect may differ depending on the type of crises, which may be a focus for future research.",

If a firm has a pre-developed crisis management plan, crisis managers should conduct appropriate crisis management strategies, such as communicating with the media and the public.

Medical and health care researchers have developed a simulation-based curriculum for clinical education and training in response to crises (Gaba et al., 2001; Gaba, 2004) , and radiology crisis management researchers have developed a computerized realistic simulation (Sica et al., 1999) . Using scenario-based crisis management strategies to train managers may enable restaurant and hotel managers to deal more appropriately with an unexpected crisis. In developing crisis scenarios, case studies may be especially effective as a means to predict diverse crisis situations and suggest appropriate response strategies. For example, Braun-latour et al. (2006) examined the childhood memory-based advertising strategy of Wendy's in responding to a hoax driving negative publicity in 2005. This unique advertising strategy helped it recover from its tainted brand image and might be useful when applied to other restaurant brands that suffer ill effects from rumors, hoaxes, and negative publicity. Chien and Law (2003) also investigated the responses of Hong Kong hotels to the SARS outbreak in March 2003, which provided good examples of appropriate responses by hotels during crises. Case studies offer various examples to use in developing scenario-based crisis management strategies. In this sense, the current study provides essential guidelines for restaurant crisis managers by not only warning of the danger of food crises but also offering response strategies when others experience their own crises.",

            "text": "Considering the immense impact of food crises, managers should pay more attention when determining their firms' branding strategy. Restaurant firms should consider their branding strategy as a marketing tool that can not only increase brand awareness but also protect brands in case of crises (Rao et al., 2004) . Although corporate branding can be an effective strategy to facilitate brand awareness, it also can endanger the whole brand family when faced with a crisis. In contrast, using a house-of-brand strategy, which allows sub-brands to use different names than the parent company, may protect members of the brand family when just one of them is involved in a crisis. In this sense, the house-of-brand strategy may be effective in minimizing negative spillover on the entire brand family. For example, in 1993, the parent company of Jack in the Box was Foodmaker, which held several other restaurant brands. Although Jack in the Box's crisis was a severe event, the images of other brands were not negatively influenced, because Foodmaker used the house-of-brand strategy causing weak associations among brands. If the parent company had used a corporate branding strategy, the results of the crisis might have been more severe.",

First, a case study approach limits the generalizability of these findings to other firms. By demonstrating the presence of negative spillovers on Jack in the Box, this study provides a snapshot of the impact of food crises on restaurant firms. Second, in addition to stock prices, there are other potential measures of the impact of a crisis on firms, such as return on assets, return on investment, or consumer perceptions. Although stock prices are immediate and direct measures, further studies may adopt other approaches to clarify the long-term impact of food crises on restaurant firms.",

            "text": "Considering that the current study only focused on food crises, future research may focus on other types of crises such as natural disaster, human-caused accidents, or business fraud. For instance, hotel industry has suffered from an accident like MGM Grand fire in Las Vegas in 1980 which killed 85 people, and 9/11 crisis from terrorist attacks in 2001 resulting in almost 3000 deaths (Stafford et al., 2002) . The enhanced understanding on the impacts of such crises on hospitality industry may help crisis managers design effective crisis communication strategies. In terms of methodology, one method of examining the impact of crises on firms may be a longitudinal study which enables researchers to compare consumers' intentions before and after the outbreak of crises. Despite the difficulty of conducting a longitudinal study, the method may overcome the limitation of the manipulated nature of scenario-based survey by maximizing the reality of survey. Lastly, although the current study used only one company, Jack in the Box, future studies may select more than one hospitality company that had similar crises in the past. For example, there were a number of hospitality companies suffered from foodborne illnesses such as salmonella and E. coli. The use of ESM along with the focus on other types of crises may enrich the existing crisis-related hospitality research.",
