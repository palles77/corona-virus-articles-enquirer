            "text": "Background: The nursing work environment, which provides the context of care delivery, has been gaining increasing attention in recent years. A growing body of evidence points to an inseparable link between attributes of the nursing work environment and nurse and patient outcomes. While most studies have adopted a survey design to examine the workforce and work environment issues, this study employed a phenomenological approach to provide empirical evidence regarding nurses' perceptions of their work and work environment. Aim: The aim of this study was to advance our understanding of the phenomenon of increasing nurse turnover through exploring frontline registered nurses' lived experiences of working in Hong Kong public hospitals. Methods and participants: A modified version of Van Kaam's controlled explication method was adopted. Individual semi-structured interviews were conducted with 26 frontline nurses recruited from ten acute regional, district and non-acute public hospitals in Hong Kong. Their perspectives in regard to their work and work environment, such as workload, manpower demand and professional values, were extensively examined, and a hypothetical description relating the nursing work environment with nurses' turnover intention was posited. Results: Contemplation of nurses' experiences revealed the vulnerable aspects of nursing work and six essential constituents of the nursing work environment, namely staffing level, work responsibility, management, co-worker relationships, job, and professional incentives. These essential constituents have contributed to two sets of forces, stabilizing and destabilizing forces, which originate from the attributes of the nursing work environment. Nurses viewed harmonious co-worker relationships, recognition and professional development as the crucial retaining factors. However, nurses working in an unfavorable environment were overwhelmed by destabilizing forces; they expressed frustration and demonstrated an intention to leave their work environment. Conclusions: The nursing work environment is a complex entity comprising multiple constituents; its attributes affect nurses' perceptions of their work and work environment, which warrant special attention in addressing the phenomenon of increasing nurse turnover.",

Hong Kong, which has adopted a Western healthcare system, is no exception to this global issue. In the local context, all public hospitals are managed by a statutory body called the Hospital Authority. Recent news has reported imminent concern regarding the shortage of nursing staff in local public hospitals, noting a staggering rise in the voluntary turnover rate from 3.2% in to 4.7% in 2008 /2009 (Moy, 2009 ). Since public hospitals account for more than 95% of hospital beds in Hong Kong, the phenomenon has provoked the public's concern regarding its potential threat to the provision of quality care. The local health authority has been adopting strategies such as better salary and promotion prospects to attract and retain nurses, but the effectiveness is yet to be evaluated. However, past studies have suggested that financial incentive is only one of the many factors determining turnover; the underlying causes are complex that need to be addressed by an integrated plan (Milisen et al., 2006) .",

The most prominent works are the two studies led by Aiken et al. (2002) and Needleman et al. (2002) , who quantifiably evaluated the association between nurse staffing levels and patient outcomes. Aiken et al. (2002) conducted a study on surgical patients and found that higher patient-to-nurse ratios resulted in significant increases in patient mortality and failure-to-rescue rates. Needleman et al. (2002) undertook a similar study on medical and surgical patients and concluded that nurses who spent more time on direct patient care could significantly reduce the duration of patients' hospitalization and the incidence of adverse events. There are, however, some researchers who have refuted the relationship between nursing manpower and quality of care (Currie et al., 2005; Feinstein, 2002) . They argued that provision of care relies on the collective efforts of multidisciplinary members, and patient outcomes should not be attributable to the staffing level of a single profession. Yet there is no doubt that nurses, who offer round the clock surveillance, have been important guardians of patients' well-being. To ensure delivery of quality health services, an adequate and stable nursing workforce is a requisite.",

The nursing work environment, which provides the context of care delivery, has been identified as the crux that determines nurse and patient outcomes (Aiken et al., 2008; Kotzer and Arellana, 2008) . Magnet research, which originated in the early 1980s, has continued to prevail in the past decade. The studies explore the features of ''magnet'' hospitals, which are conducive to promoting professional nursing practice and nursing retention, and the findings have further consolidated the positive influence of the ''magnet'' environment on nurses' job satisfaction, autonomy, stress management and outcomes of care (Kramer and Schmalenberg, 2003; Spence Laschinger et al., 2001) . Intensive voices have been noted regarding the need to create a healthy work environment for health professionals (Shirey, 2006) . A wide range of attributes of the nursing work environment has been identified, including resources, managerial support, coworker relationships, leadership, autonomy, financial incentives, care delivery models, and sense of professionalism. Researchers further inquired into the issues by devising instruments to capture the features of the nursing work environment. These comprise several well-known instruments such as the Nursing Work Index (NWI) (Kramer and Hafner, 1989) , the Revised Nursing Work Index (NWI-R) (Aiken and Patrician, 2000) , the Practice Environment Scale (PES) (Lake, 2002) , and the Perceived Nursing Work Environment (PNWE) instrument (Choi et al., 2004) . Since then, increasing attention has been drawn to the attributes of the nursing work environment, which have been measured through quantification of nurses' perceptions.",

Phenomenologists believe in the existence of the true essence of a phenomenon, and stress the importance of uncovering the essence of a phenomenon through understanding the meanings of people's lived experiences (Parse, 2001) . This study employed the phenomenological approach to explore nurses' lived experiences of working in real-life contexts, which are crucial to understanding the essence of the phenomenon of increasing nurse turnover in local public hospitals.",

The method delineates systematic operational processes to discover the structures and patterns of human experiences, and is composed of two phases: the pre-scientific and scientific phases of explication (Parse, 2001; Van Kaam, 1966) . In the pre-scientific phase, the informants provide raw descriptions of their lived experiences. The descriptive expressions are then processed through a scientific explication approach that involves six overlapping steps: listing and preliminary grouping, reduction, elimination, hypothetical identification, application and final identification (Van Kaam, 1966) . The process of inquiry leads researchers through a journey of intuiting, describing, reducing and analyzing data to search for the essence of a phenomenon (Parse, 2001) . It enables researchers to make explicit the implicit meanings of human perspectives and behaviors, so that researchers can formulate conceptual knowledge pertinent to the understanding of the phenomenon (Omery, 1983; Van Kaam, 1966) . The operational processes of the control explication method are delineated in further detail in the analysis section.",

Snowball sampling involves recruiting informants through nominations by primary informants, who are invited to make referrals of eligible informants from among their acquaintances (Polit et al., 2001) . This sampling strategy is one of the non-probability sampling methods that have been commonly applied in qualitative research; it allows researchers to reach informants who are willing to share their views in regard to the study issue, and has been upheld as practical and cost-and time-efficient (Gall et al., 2003) . In this study, potential informants were referred by two initial contacts, a hospital administrator and a newly graduated registered nurse. Each of the two primary informants was then invited to nominate two potential informants from among their friends or colleagues who were nurses working in local public hospitals. Subsequent recruitments resulted from nurses making further referrals from among their acquaintances. The sampling of informants ceased when data saturation was noted, which refers to a stage when the analysis of emerging empirical data does not reveal any new findings. Analysis of the verbatim transcripts of the first 22 interviews identified a list of descriptive expressions that were categorized under segments, while further interviews with four nurses revealed only variations in the existing segments without emergence of other new findings. The 26 nurses were recruited from ten acute regional, district and non-acute public hospitals in the local context, and their demographic characteristics are presented in Table 1 .",

Phrases that described nurses' perspectives on their work and work environment were extracted and listed. Descriptive expressions that conveyed common meanings were grouped and categorized into segments. Researchers further examined the unifying meanings of the descriptive expressions; overlapping and vague expressions were reduced and modified into more precise terms, while extraneous descriptions were eliminated. Ten randomly selected transcripts (40%) were read again by the research team members and eight final year nursing students who were involved in the later part of the study, so as to ensure that the list of descriptive expressions identified was exhaustive and integral to nurses' experiences.",

The results of the study showed that harmonious collegial relationships, appreciation from stakeholders and professional enhancement are the key elements that support nurses. A favorable environment that supports nursing work with stabilizing forces such as effective management and appropriate incentives can further alleviate nurses' vulnerability at work. However, an unfavorable environment that overwhelms nurses with destabilizing forces such as inadequate staffing, unsupportive management and inequitable employment terms can lead to frustration and dissatisfaction among nurses, which have potential impacts on their turnover intention. Fig. 1 presents a hypothetical model that explicates a dynamic equilibrium between nursing work and the stabilizing and destabilizing forces in the nursing work environment. Nurses' work has been sustained by an embedded sense of professional value gained from recognition, personal and professional development, and a sense of support contributed by intimate and supportive co-workers. Meanwhile, nurses who work in the contexts are constantly interacting with other factors. Unfavorable factors that emanate destabilizing forces cause nurses to lose their equilibrium; nurses who lack support from the organization may not be able to tolerate the overwhelming vulnerability, and a disequilibrium (Fig. 2 ) then arises. To sustain an equilibrium between the two sets of forces, organizational efforts are needed to improve the nursing work environment; destabilizing forces have to be transformed to stabilizing forces in order to support nursing practice.

The contemporary nursing work environment was noted to have been overwhelmed by destabilizing forces such as inadequate staffing and ineffective management; the finding of an imbalance between two coexisting but opposing forces or situations is comparable to the results of both McGillis Hall and Kiesners's (2005) and Hallin and Danielson's (2007) works, which are the few qualitative studies that have examined nurses' work environment and experiences. McGillis Hall and Kiesners (2005) described nurses as working in an environment with high effort and low reward, while informants in Hallin and Danielson's (2007) study perceived their work situations as more stressful than stimulating. This disequilibrium, which results in work stress, can have a detrimental effect on nursing practice and nurse and patient outcomes; the attributes of the nursing work environment therefore require special attention.",

Nurses in this study gave negative appraisals of the need to manage sudden and unexpected incidents and to bear the legal responsibility for work. This was in contrast to McNeese-Smith's (1999) study, which revealed nurses showing enjoyment at the challenging nature of their profession. Further analysis of nurses' characteristics indicated that younger nurses tend to tackle challenges more positively, while senior nurses tend to view them as a burden. Stress induced by the fear of making errors has also been consistently reported in past studies (Gallagher et al., 2003; McNeese-Smith, 1999) . In the local context, government and media reports on the occurrence of errors and sentinel events have further drawn the public's attention to the performance of healthcare personnel (Lui, 2008) . Nurses, as the largest workforce among the health professions, are seen as accountable for any errors that happen during the caring process. When asked about their responsibility for patient safety, 96% of nurses and more than 90% of physicians, administrators and pharmacists viewed it as the primary responsibility of nurses (Ramsey, 2005) . Meurier et al. (1997) found most nurses willing to take responsibility for their errors, but they experienced emotional distress that resulted in diffidence at work. The researchers further highlighted the need to cultivate a positive culture of learning from errors, so as to build defenses for patient safety.",

Nurses are alert to its potential impacts on staff well-being, which render them more liable to errors and injuries. Absenteeism was also commonly reported in previous studies (McGillis Hall and Kiesners, 2005; Verhaeghe et al., 2006) . The issues of understaffing and absenteeism have combined to form a vicious cycle. Nurses who are unable to cope with the work burden are absent from work, which further increases the workload of the remaining staff. Those who find the work conditions unbearable gradually develop an inclination to leave their current positions, which leads to increasing voluntary turnover. Tremendous efforts have been dedicated to tackling this global issue by establishing minimum nurse staffing ratios: a one-to-five nurse to patient ratio was proposed for general medical-surgical units (Chapman et al., 2009; Harrington et al., 2000) . Yet skeptics contended that the ratio could not be a gold standard that fits all countries, and quality care should not only be attributable to this single factor (Chapman et al., 2009; Wharrad and Robinson, 1999) . To solve the problem, researchers asserted the importance of understanding nursing work and nurses' context of practice (Spitzer et al., 2006) .",

By offering support and maintaining open communications, management leaders can help counteract nurses' emotional exhaustion resulting from their demanding work environment (Bakker et al., 2000; Schmieder and Smith, 1996) . Supervisory support was also noted to have a significant impact on reducing nurses' intention to leave the nursing profession ( Van der Heijden et al., 2010) . Nurses in this study described management leaders as not understanding their thoughts and needs, and the quality assurance measures imposed as further increasing their workloads. Consistent with their responses, Cooke (2006) noted that nurses are overloaded with audits. Some managers admitted that audits did not reveal much new information; the problems unveiled in audits had already been reflected from other means such as patient complaints and litigations (Cooke, 2006) . Other studies also reported the increasing demands of paperwork, which deprives nurses of direct patient care time (Hallin and Danielson, 2007; McNeese-Smith, 1999) .",

Unlike in other studies (Bucknall and Thomas, 1997; Budge et al., 2003) , nurses in this study rarely discussed their relationships with other interdisciplinary members. Physicians, as the closest partners of nurses, were only mentioned when nurses argued over their autonomy being overridden by them. The discontent over the autonomy issue might have been so intense as to have masked the discussion of the nurse-physician relationship. The debate over autonomy might be explained by the fact that the majority of nurses are baccalaureate nurses, and more educated nurses tend to have higher role expectations (Lu et al., 2006) . Other studies also reported nurses as having limited opportunities to influence patient care decisions and change their work situations (Hallin and Danielson, 2008; Milisen et al., 2006) . This might indicate that the culture of hospital practice is still hierarchical in structure. The findings warrant attention since provision of healthcare requires collaborative team efforts; the struggle of power between the two disciplines can hinder communications, which affects provision of quality care.",

The sense of professionalism was gained from recognition from the public and care recipients. Some researchers attributed it to the past outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), following which nurses' professional image and work values became more widely recognized (Lu et al., 2006) . Besides gaining satisfaction from recognition, nurses acquire a sense of accomplishment from advancing knowledge through the patient care process. Professional incentives, such as the opportunities given to fulfill their own potential, were commonly identified in past studies (Lu et al., 2002; Teng et al., 2007) . Nurses touched only lightly on the issue of financial incentives, showing an understanding that experience and time are needed for promotion. To a certain extent, this reflects that nurses are not mammonists, they look to provide quality care that underpins their personal and professional values. There remains a concern that this sense of professionalism might gradually be undermined by the less favorable work environment, thus hindering them from providing good nursing care.",

Nevertheless, this study has contributed to a fuller understanding of nurses' lived experiences of working in local public hospitals, providing important implications for policy makers.",

Among the various essential constituents of the nursing work environment, the issue of inadequate staffing has received considerable attention, which takes time to be resolved through professional training and detailed resource planning. Limited focus has been placed on other aspects that can be addressed through organizational efforts, such as the inappropriate handling of patients' and relatives' complaints, the sense of deprival of autonomy in patient care, and the existence of work constraints such as frequent audits and documentation. A thorough examination of the healthcare environment should be initiated to identify the obstacles that affect nursing practice and provision of quality care.",

            "text": "Though frustration at work has been widely observed, nurses seldom vocalize their appeals. They tend to be modest and reserved, and readily accept compromised work conditions (Hallin and Danielson, 2007) . This further casts light on the need to cultivate management leaders' sensitivity to frontline nurses' needs. Mounting evidence points to the crucial role of management leaders in providing a productive environment for health professionals. Managers who demonstrate visible leadership are seen as central to success in transforming the work environment; they can foster professional practice by collaborating closely with the organization to streamline the work processes and provide the necessary resources to facilitate provision of care (Armstrong and Laschinger, 2006; Mrayyan, 2004; Shirey, 2006) . More channels of communication should be provided to facilitate interactions between frontline nurses, managers and policy makers. Frontline nurses are the health professionals who provide immediate care to patients and the community; they are an invaluable resource in directing healthcare policies. It should be noted that health policies should never negate nurses' ethical obligation to provide holistic care that underpins the professional values of nursing (Aroskar et al., 2004) .",

The findings generated from these nurses who worked in local public hospitals cannot be taken to represent those who work in different healthcare contexts.

In addition, human perceptions are dynamic, and both nurses' work and their work environment are also subject to changes induced by education, policies, economics and the public's expectations regarding healthcare. It would be meaningful to conduct a longitudinal study in the future, to examine the impacts of different changes on nurses' perceptions of their work and work environment.",
