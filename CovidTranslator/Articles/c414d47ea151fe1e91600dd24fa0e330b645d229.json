With the microarray system, the full biochemical processes, including gene fragment amplification, fluorescence labeling, hybridization, and fluorescence detection, have been performed in the sealed tube without opening the cap. The images are obtained from a fluorescence microscope and captured by a CCD, and the data are transported to a computer through the universal serial bus (USB). After noise reduction, signal intensity is determined from hybridization image and the presence of gene fragments is identified. The final data output includes sample information, process steps, and hybridization results. A lab-ina-tube microarray system for detecting ten respiratory viruses at a single detection is designed.

The common commercial microarray scanners perform two-dimensional scanning with an X-Y stage and detect fluorescence signal with a photomultiplier tube (PMT). These scanners are widely used with the high-density microarray for gene expression profiling and SNPs genotyping [4] [5] [6] [7] . Some of the new scanner systems broaden the detecting optical spectral range. For example, Sinclair et al. reported a newly designed scanner which was capable of collecting fluorescent spectrum from 490 to 900 nm with 3-30 \u03bcm spectral step [8] . By using confocal scanning mode, image-capturing can be performed during DNA fragment hybridizing process to distinguish the hybridization and non-hybridization sequences [9, 10] . However, microarray scanners with confocal technique need a long scan time when they adopt the high resolution detection mode.",

In comparison with linear filters (e.g. smooth filtration), the use of median value in replacement of local average improves image quality under certain conditions. The median filter is better for chip image process because of its ability to reduce random noise, which is created by the noise of hybridization. The limitation with median filtration is the possibility of filtering-out of some useful signal if many bright points (information signal) stay closely.",
