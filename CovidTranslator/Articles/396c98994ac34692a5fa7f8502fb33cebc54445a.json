The present study aimed to exam sleep problems and posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) in Chinese immediately after the massive outbreak of COVID-19. A total of 2027 Chinese participated in the present study. Wuhan-expose history, sleep quality and PTSS were measured with self-rating scales. Results showed that there were significant differences of PCL-5 and of sleep quality scores in different data-collection dates (ps<0.05). There were significant differences of PCL-5 scores (t=-2.93, p<0.05) and latency onset of sleep (\u03c72=9.77, p<0.05) between participants with and without Wuhan-expose history. The interaction effect of Wuhan exposure history\u00d7 sleep quality significantly influenced PCL-5 (ps<0.05). These results indicate that keeping good sleep quality in individuals with high infectious risk is a way to prevent PTSS.",

            "text": "According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-5th edition (APA, 2013), Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is characterized by four symptom groups: (a) involuntary memories of the trauma such as intrusions or nightmares; (b) persistent avoidance of stimuli associated with the traumatic event; (c) negative alterations in cognitions and mood that are associated with the trauma; and (d) alterations in arousal and reactivity that are associated with the trauma. Also in DSM-5, exposure to traumatic events is the immediate causes of PTSD and an essential condition of diagnosis. Being infected with a life-threatening physical illness is a traumatic event and can lead to posttraumatic stress symptoms. For example, 12%-15% survivors of SARS showed one type of PTSD symptom (PTSS) at one month after discharge (Wu et al, 2005) ; the morbidity of PTSD in patients with traumatic injury reached 9.6% at months (Bryant et al., 2017) . In addition, not only being attacked by traumatic illness could cause PTSD symptoms, being contacts and carers of a deadly virus could also lead to symptoms like alternations in mood and arousal (Tine et al., 2016) . Living in the endemic area, every Chinese is a carer and a ( Previous studies have proved that massive outbreaks of epidemics like SARS and Ebola virus disease (EVD) could cause sleep problems in relevant individuals. For example, Yu et al. (2005) reported that midlife women felt \"sleep was restless\" during SARS and this problem was closely associated with their overall negative emotions. Another study showed that chronic post-SARS symptoms were characterized by sleep-related problems (Moldofsky and Patcai, 2011) . Survivors of EVD also reported various sleep quality problems (Keita et al., 2017) . More importantly, Sleep and PTSS are closely related, and sleep disturbances are core features of PTSD. According to the model raised by Richard et al. (2020) , sleep disturbances (short sleep duration, frequent arousals, and et al.) could lead to maladaptive sleep-related compensatory behaviors and cause hyperarousal and anxiety-related disorders like PTSD. Sleep disruption also promoted anxious emotions by disrupt emotion regulation and adaptive memory functions. Thus, it was reasonable to hypothesize that wide-spread transmission of COVID-19 could causes sleep problems in Chinese and result in PTSS.",

We hypothesized that Wuhan residents and individuals who had been to Wuhan or contacted with Wuhan residents, would show more sleep problems and PTSS for they were faced with high possibility of infection of COVID-19. We also explored the relationship among the infection risk, sleep and PTSS to identify the role of sleep problems in the development of PTSD.

Limitations of the current study included the use of a health example and the fact that we used online survey in data collection. Only a few subjects were confirmed or suspected COVID-19 patients in our study. And the mean levels of sleep quality and PTSS were in the moderate range. For those being infected with COVID-19, sleep and metal health problems might be far more severe. Considering the risk of infection, we used online survey to investigate relationship among Wuhan exposure history, sleep and PTSS.

Wuhan-expose history influenced only those with relatively poor sleep quality, but if individuals showed few or none sleep problems, Wuhan-expose was not a risk factor of PTSS. These results indicated that traumatic events provide bases for PTSD but one's ability to keep sleep quality was a protective factor of onset and development of PTSD. This was line with Germain et al.'s (2016) model of sleep and PTSD which indicated that sleep related more closely with PTSS than trauma events. These results were also consist with previous studies which showed alters of REM sleep after uncontrolled stress accounted for the long term physiological and behavioral impairments in an animal model (Vanderheyden et al., 2015). The mechanisms regulating the interactions of traumatic stress and sleep were poorly understood, and we extended previous findings by showing regulation effect of sleep quality on the relationship between trauma expose and PTSD in human samples. To prevent mental illness and protect mental health in the peak rush of COVID-19 and other infectious fatal diseases, health authorities should be mindful of the influence of infectious risks on psychological reactions, propagate the importance of keeping good sleep quality like enough sleep time, keeping early hours etc.",
