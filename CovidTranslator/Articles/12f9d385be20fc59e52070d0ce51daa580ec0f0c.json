This association with ARDS was especially strong among the 311 patients with septic shock (adjusted odds ratio, 12.0; 95% confidence interval, 1.9-74). Among the patients with ARDS, the 54BB genotype was associated with more daily organ dysfunction (p = .01) and higher mortality (adjusted hazard rate, 4.0; 95% confidence interval, 1.6-10). Development of ARDS and outcomes in ARDS did not vary significantly with variant alleles of codon -221, 52, and 57, but the power to detect an effect was limited secondary to the low allele frequencies.",

The MBL protein is encoded by the mannose binding lectin-2 (MBL-2) gene on chromosome 10 . It is now known that circulating MBL levels are due largely to three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in codon 52 (db SNP ID rs5030737), 54 (db SNP ID rs1800450), and 57 (db SNP ID rs1800451) in exon 1 and a promoter SNP at codon -221 (MBLXY; db SNP ID rs7096206) (7) . The variant exon 1 alleles are known as D, B, and C, respectively, whereas the wild-type alleles are known collectively as the A allele. The variant alleles in exon 1 and the X allele in the MBLXY polymorphism have been found to be associated with serum MBL deficiency especially in individuals homozygous for the variant alleles (8, 9) .",

This study has a number of strengths. The prospective determination of ARDS using the American-European Consensus Conference definition helps minimize phenotype misclassification. In addition, clearly defined at-risk controls were used in this study. Using critically ill controls who have the opportunity to develop the outcome is more clinically relevant than using healthy individuals.

Nevertheless, codon 54 may be very significant in the MBL-2 gene. The variant codon 54B allele is more prevalent than codon 52 and codon 57 in the Caucasian populations. Individuals with the codon 54B allele demonstrate even lower MBL protein concentration than individuals with the 52D allele (33) , and what MBL protein is produced was found to be incapable of activating the classic complement pathway (37) .

At low doses of MBL, increasing MBL concentration increases production of proinflammatory cytokines. But at higher concentrations, increasing MBL suppresses these inflammatory cytokines (41) . It is possible that in critically ill patients with the low or defective MBL-producing genotypes, circulating MBL may not be sufficiently high or effective enough to switch from enhancement to suppression of the proinflammatory cytokine response. Unfortunately, the functional significance of the MBL-2 polymorphisms and the inflammatory response of these patients in this study could not be examined.

Indeed, patients in this study who were homozygous for the variant codon 54B allele were more likely to have septic shock on admission to the ICU.

Because of the study design, the results may not be generalizable to the community setting, to immunocompromised hosts or patients without risk factors for ARDS, or with different clinical risks for ARDS. In addition, the analyses were restricted to Caucasians, which reduces the possibility of confounding from ethnicity (42) but does not permit extrapolation of the results to other ethnic groups.",

ICU, intensive care unit; ARDS, acute respiratory distress syndrome. Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) III score on admission to the intensive care unit by genotype for the mannose binding lectin-2 codon 54 polymorphism among all 654 cases and controls.
