There is no report of PCV2 infection-associated morbidity and the level of awareness of stakeholders has never been investigated in Uganda. This cross sectional survey investigated the occurrence of Porcine Circovirus type 2systemic disease (PCV2-SD) among pigs and the associated level of awareness of stakeholders in Central Uganda. Data were collected using questionnaires, Focus Group Discussions (FGDs), key informant interviews and laboratory investigations. All respondents (n = 131) and farmers attending FGDs (n = 31) had never heard of PCV2-SD and only 16.7% (n = 2) of the interviewed animal health workers (n = 12) knew about the disease. Among the farms, 20 piglets presenting with a chronic wasting and a persistent diarrhea were detected and sampled for laboratory investigations. Severe lymphoid depletion with histiocytic and macrophage infiltration in lymphoid organs (n = 8), shortening of intestinal villi (n = 9), abscesses in various organs (n = 15) and granulomatous pneumonia (n = 2) were the major histopathological lesions described. Immunohistochemistry and PCR assays on organs with implicating lesions confirmed PCV2 infection in 25% (n = 5) of the 20 pigs. The study confirmed the occurrence of PCV2 infections among piglets with persistent diarrhea on pig farms in central Uganda and revealed a low level of associated knowledge among farmers and veterinary practitioners. The study arouses the need for systematic studies on prevalence of PCV2 infections and sensitization of stakeholders on occurrence of PCV2 infections in Uganda.",

The occurrence of PCVADs is associated with Porcine Circovirus type 2 (PCV2) which is a single-stranded DNA virus that was first detected and described in Western Canada [1, 2] . PCV2 infections have been reported across Europe, the Americas, Africa and Asia [3] [4] [5] [6] . By far, Porcine Circovirus type 2systemic disease (PCV2-SD) previously called Postweaning Multisystemic Wasting Syndrome (PMWS) and PCV2 sub clinical infections are considered the most economically important PCVADs [7] . Although, infections occur early in life and during fetal development [8] , PCV2-SD typically presents in piglets of 4-15 weeks of age [9] . However, older pigs towards finishing stage are also susceptible [9] . Morbidity often varies from 5 to 30% among cohorts in the nursery or finishing stages while case fatality rate may be above 50% [9] . However, most infections remain unapparent and onset of PCV2-SD is triggered by several environmental stressors and immunosuppression of the host [1] .",

This increases the incidence of carcass contamination at slaughter and presents a serious public health challenge.

Generally, farmers attributed the emaciation of pigs to poor nutrition, helminthiasis or other long standing diseases. When the implicating clinical picture was presented to the farmers, farmers reported the occurrence of such morbidity among grower pigs but no technical personnel had ever talked to them about the disease. One of the farmers (male) with over 600 pigs in Wakiso said, 'When you find any positive result, you let us know such that we improve our management'. Antibiotic therapy especially sulphonamides administration (S-Dime\u00ae, Norodine\u00ae) and deworming were the common treatments administered to the affected piglets.

Also, appropriate management aimed at minimizing the risk factors, may be overlooked by farmers. For example, 99.2% (P < .001) of the farmers mixed weaned piglets from different sows thus age groups and different sources. Also, early weaning (below five weeks) was being practiced by over 30% of the farmers. The later contributes to early withdrawal of maternal antibodies before development of the immune system. The risk of occurrence and aggravation of morbidity due to PCV2 infections is known to be compounded by the above factors [1, [24] [25] [26] . Moreover, most pig farms in Uganda hardly implement proper bio-security measures [17] . Although effective commercial vaccines against PCV2 infections have been developed [27, 28] , their use to control PCVADs has never been explored in Uganda. Occurrence of PCV2 infections on some farms as revealed by this study indicates failure to control triggers for onset of PCV2-SD which presents a big risk for occurrence of epidemic outbreaks.",

Prolonged fixation of tissues in formalin may affect the sensitivity of IHC and PCR. In this study, samples were processed within two weeks to minimize the effects of prolonged fixation of tissues in formalin. Despite the confirmation of PCV2 infections from one district (Wakiso), the extent of the problem may be widespread since there is a limited control in the movement of breeding stock amidst poor diagnosis, subclinical states and limited knowledge. Actually, the study sampled only pigs presenting with chronic diarrhea for laboratory detection of PCV2 in tissues hence subclinical infections which are highly prevalent in other regions of Uganda [6, 17] were not investigated. Chronic wasting among pigs that were negative for PCV2 could not be fully characterized as their causes were not investigated. Such may include malnutrition and viral enteropathies such as rotavirus, parvovirus and corona virus infections among others. Future studies are recommended to investigate the extent of PCVADs and other enteropathies and their contribution to the onset of PCV2-SD.",

Further studies on the prevalence and mapping of PCV2 infections and PCVADs are required to establish the extent of the infection to guide interventions.
