Sequence analysis of the 70 nucleotide region between open reading frames la and lb indicates the presence of a shifty heptamer consensus sequence and downstream sequences that may be needed for ribosomal frameshifting. We constructed four astrovirus cassettes that spanned this region and inserted each into the rhesus rotavirus VP4 gene. The constructs were expressed in an in vitro system, and products were immunoprecipitated by rotavirus amino and carboxy terminalspecific monoclonal antibodies. Ribosomal frameshifting, at an efficiency of 6-7%, was demonstrated in all constructs containing the shifty heptamer and stem-loop. Deletion of the downstream sequence potentially involved in pseudoknot formation did not affect frameshifting efficiency. However, deletion of the shifty heptamer resulted in no detectable frameshift activity.",

This places the first methionine well into the RDRP motif and in a suboptimal context for initiation according to Kozak's rules [17] . Thus, the possibility of an internal ribosome entry site as well as a yet unidentified subgenomic message for polymerase expression are unlikely. Detailed sequence analysis of the overlap region between ORFs la and lb led several investigators to propose ribosomal frameshifting as a mechanism for expression of the astrovirus RDRP gene [13, 21, 31] . Regulation at the level of translation by ribosomal frameshifting was first described for higher eukaryotes by Jacks and Varmus in 1985 for the expression of the Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) Pol gene [16] . Since then, ribosomal frameshifting has been described for many systems including several retroviruses [14] , coronaviruses [2, 4] , yeast double stranded RNA viruses [7] , retrotransposons [1] and most recently astroviruses [25] . A (-1) frameshift at the astrovirus ORFla/lb overlap would allow the expression of an ORFla/lb fusion protein containing the viral polsa'nerase. This viral fusion protein is probably cleaved by viral and/or cellular proteases into active peptides.",

The sequence between the asterisks is completely conserved among the three astrovirus serotypes tested to date [21] The sequence between nt 2792-2834 includes both the shifty heptamer and the potential stem-loop and is completely conserved among the human astrovirus serotypes 1, 2, and 5 that have been evaluated to date [21] . This suggests that this 43 nt region, defined by nt 2792-2834, may encode an important function for human astroviruses. The highest region of complementarity for pseudoknot formation is found between 9 of 10 nt of the loop (nt 2814-2823) of the stem-loop and nt 2975-2984, located 151 nt downstream. Sequences between the stem-loop and proposed pseudoknot forming regions appear to have lower degrees of complementarity with the 10 base loop (see below). The strategy we adopted to prove that these sequences are involved in frameshifting in astroviruses was to clone the suspected frameshift region into the rhesus rotavirus (RRV) VP4 gene. RRV VP4 encodes an 86.5 kDa protein that serves as the outer capsid spike protein for rotavirus [22] . The VP4 gene was selected since well-characterized monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) specific for both the amino-or carboxy terminal-specific portions of the VP4 protein are available [23] . For the astrovirus-VP4 constructs used in the current studies, these MAbs allowed the differentiation of full-length protein translated by (-1) ribosomal frameshifting from a truncated, nonframeshifted protein when translation stops in the (0) frame, as described below. Direct analysis of frameshifting in astrovirusinfected cells was not possible since immunological reagents have not yet been developed for specific astrovirus proteins. The strategy of cloning a suspected ribosomal frameshift region into a foreign gene has also been used to demon-strate frameshifling in the coronavirus, infectious bronchitis virus (IB\u00a5) [4] , and some of the retroviruses such as human immunodeficiency virus [29] . Marczinke et al also adopted a similar scheme using the influenza genes PB1 and PB2 and amino terminal-specific polyclonal antibodies to evaluate the ORF1 a/lb overlap region of the Newcastle strain of astrovirus serotype 1 [25] .",

            "text": "The first VP4-astrovirus chimeric clone studied was designated construct A. Construct A contained 367 nt of astrovirus sequence (nt 2747-3113) and spanned the region from 47 nt upstream from the shifty heptamer to 129 nt downstream of the sequence suspected of forming a pseudoknot (Fig. 1) . The PCR primers used to generate the construct A cassette were forward primer, P1 (5'-GGTTTGG-AAGGTTTCCTCCAA-3'), which contained one VP4 nt (G) at the 5'-end to maintain the frame, and reverse primer, P6 (5'-AACTGTGGATATTCTGA-GAAAAAGT-3'). We hypothesized that if this sequence induces frameshifting, amino terminal-specific MAb 7A12 would immunoprecipitate two products from the in vitro translation mixture: a 40 kDa truncated protein where translation stops in the (0) frame and a 100 kDa chimeric protein in which translation continues in the (-1) frame avoiding the (0) frame stop codon, 45 nt from the shifty heptamer (Fig. 1) . These two products were detected by MAb 7A12 indicating a (-1) ribosomal frameshift has occurred (Fig. 2A, lane 3 ). An 86.5 kDa protein translated in vitro from the VP4 construct with no astrovirus insertion was immunoprecipitated by MAb 7A12 (Fig. 2A, lane 4) . The band below the 100 kDa chimeric protein and 86.5 kDa VP4 is likely an internal initiation product or a partial degradation product and was also detected from RRV-infected cell lysates (data not shown). The carboxy terminal-specific MAb HS2 immunoprecipitated the 100 kDa chimeric protein, but the 40 kDa protein was not detected, as predicted ( Fig. 2A, lane 1) . This verifies the carboxy terminal-specific portion of the translated chimeric protein is VP4. VP4, translated from the VP4 construct, was also immunoprecipitated by MAb HS2 (Fig. 2A, lane 2) . The two bands directly below the uppermost bands in lanes 1 and 2 likely represent internal initiation products in this in vitro system. The identity of the other bands (25-50 kDa) detected by MAb HS2 (Fig. 2A, lanes  1 and 2) were not characterized further but are found in both the VP4 and A Demonstration of ribosomal frameshifting by immunoprecipitation analysis of in vitro translation products: Construct A lanes 1 and 3, and a VP4 construct that does not contain an astrovirus insert, lanes 2 and 4. The VP4 carboxy terminal-specific MAb HS2 was used for immunoprecipitation in 1 and 2, and the VP4 amino terminal-specific MAb 7A12 in 3 and 4. The polypeptides were labeled with 35S-methionine and separated on an 12% SDS-PAGE gel followed by autoradiography. B Identification of important astrovirus sequences in ribosomal frameshifting. The in vitro translation products of constructs A, B, C, and D were immunoprecipitated with the VP4 amino terminal-specific MAb 7A12. The polypeptides were labeled with 35S-methionine and separated on a 12% SDS-PAGE gel followed by autoradiography. This gel was analyzed quantitatively using a phosphorimager to determine the efficiency of frameshifting frameshift constructs. We speculate that these bands represent degradation products not detectable by MAb 7A12. In order to determine what the shifty heptamer and downstream sequence complementary to the loop contributed to frameshifing, three additional constructs (B, C, and D) were designed and generated byPCR. Construct B (191 nt astrovirus cassette) is an abbreviated version of the original construct A, with the shifty heptamer sequence (nt 2794-2800) at its upstreana border and the hypothetical pseudoknot sequence at its downstream border. The upstream potential, but less likely, shifty heptamer (nt 2779-2785) was not included in this construct. Construct C (179 nt) was further shortened by deleting the downstream sequence potentially involved in pseudoknot formation. In construct D (313 nt), the shifty heptamer was eliminated but all downstream sequences (including the potential pseudoknot sequence) found in construct A were maintained. The forward and reverse PCR primers, respectively, used to generate the astrovirus cassettes in constructs B -D were: P2 (5'-AAAAAACTACAAAGGGCCCCAGA-3') and P5 (5'-AGTAGACCAAGGAGATCGT-3') for construct B; P2 and P4 (5'-AGAT-CGTCCCTGGGTTTCTT-3') for construct C; and P3 (5'-GTACAAAGGGC-CCCAGAAGA-3') and P6 for construct D. The location of the Y-end of each primer is indicated by arrowheads in Fig. 1 .",

            "text": "Several factors may explain why construct C, which lacked the downstream sequence potentially involved in pseudoknot formation, shifted with an efficiency equal to A and B. First, our studies were conducted in an in vitro system which may not mimic in vivo conditions, where regulation of frameshifting may be more subtle. Second, the downstream sequence that may be involved in pseudoknot formation is 151 nt from the loop of the upstream stem loop. The distance between the loop and its complementary downstream sequence is greater than that described for pseudoknot structures in other viruses [3, 10] . Jiang et al. suggest a sequence 29 nt from the loop as potentially being involved in pseudoknot formation for astrovirus serotype 2 [13] . This sequence complements the loop of the upstream stem-loop in 5 of 10 nt for serotype 2 and only 4 of 10 nt for both strains of serotype 1. The sequence 151 nt downstream has a homology of 7 of 10 nt for serotype 2, 8 of 10 nt for the Newcastle strain of serotype 1 [31] , and 9 of 10 nt for the Oxford strain of serotype 1 used in this study. A third possibility is that the system we studied does not require pseudoknot formation. This is most likely the case since Marczinke et al. demonstrated that a 37 nt oligonucleotide from the Newcastle strain of astrovirus serotype 1 which contains only the shifty heptamer and stem-loop regions induces frameshifting at an efficiency equal to their largest construct of 2000 nt. Other viral frameshift systems, such as HIV-1 [29] and HTLV-II [8] , also require only a shifty heptamer and stem loop for frameshifting.",

With the addition of the nonenveloped astroviruses, there are now three distinct animal virus families that utilize (-1) ribosomal frameshifting as means of regulation at the level of translation: the Retroviridae, the Coronaviridae, and the Astroviridae.",
