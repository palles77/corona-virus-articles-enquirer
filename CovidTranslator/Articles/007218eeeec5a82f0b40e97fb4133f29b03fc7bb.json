Currently, the world is faced with a number of pandemics attributed to influenza virus, HCV and HIV. Influenza virus has caused four major pandemics during the 20th century of which the 1918-1920 pandemic was most severe and estimated to have killed 50-100 million people worldwide [1] [2] [3] . Nations have implemented pandemic preparedness strategies to create a global front against emerging infectious diseases. Despite existing preventive measures, the current H1N1 influenza pandemic demonstrates the potential for emerging influenza viral threats to quickly surpass these measures and become a pandemic. To date, the CDC has reported nearly 9000 hospitalized H1N1 cases in 2009 from USA alone and there is growing concern over the rise of a more deadly strain coinciding with the regular flu season. In addition to recent events with the influenza pandemic, it is important to note that nearly 40 million people globally are currently living with HIV, while HCV infects over 170 million people worldwide and approximately 30% of those who are chronically infected develop liver fibrosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. It is necessary to thoroughly understand virus-host interactions if we are to address current and future viral pandemics, and this may best be accomplished by taking a systems-level approach in researching virus infection.",

These models are then assessed by introducing perturbations within a given cellular network and monitoring the responses, thereby relating alteration of specific components to the system as a whole. Biological validation of the predictions using a variety of experimental systems allows current models to be refined and also provides the basis for further predictions and hypothesis generation. The Rubik's cube illustrated in Figure 1 symbolizes systems biology as a multidimensional matrix integrating computational models, experimental systems and highthroughput data types in a variety of permutations to solve the puzzle of virus-host interactions. Such efforts are critical to researchers' objectives to identify and prioritize potential host-cell factors for novel antivirals. This is a time of great opportunity for biomedical researchers as better technologies and more integrated approaches will lend new perspective to some of the most trying viral challenges of our time. Systems biology will probably reinforce current pandemic strategies by aiding in the development of effective therapeutics and vaccines.

While failure to induce innate immunity is likely to result in increased infection, an overly aggressive response can exacerbate disease severity, as observed with 1918 pandemic influenza virus infection. Our laboratory has used genomics to profile transcriptional changes in 1918-infected respiratory tissues from mouse and nonhuman primate (NHP) animal models. These demonstrate a strong and early activation of innate immune pathways -coupled with enhanced expression of inflammatory and cell death-related genes -and, remarkably, the host response is sustained throughout the course of infection [4, 5] . The assessment of host response using functional genomics is a discovery-driven approach that has revealed critical information in the regulation of gene expression pertaining to innate immune responses. By probing deeper into virus-host interactions that occur early after infection, it will probably reveal more information regarding disease progression.",

            "text": "To obtain a more complete picture of virus infection, genomics is being integrated with proteomics, which together offer greater coverage of cellular and molecular events occurring during viral replication. Proteomic analysis provides information on relative changes in protein abundance and details regarding post-translational modifications, such as protein phorphorylation and ubiquitination, which can influence effector function and, possibly, infection. Comparative genomic and proteomic analyses have revealed correlations between gene expression and relative protein abundance in a NHP model of influenza infection, particularly with respect to interferon induction. These analyses implicated 'molecular signatures' in the periphery that could signify molecular events of pulmonary influenza infection. Identification of innate immune-related genes coregulated in the lungs and periphery broadly correlated with MX1, IFIT1 and STAT1 immune mediators that were detected in the lungs [6] . Similar studies can serve as a foundation for systems biology approaches to further characterize virus-induced cellular perturbations in the host and, ultimately, identify biomarkers that can be used to detect disease and predict infection outcomes. This information will be particularly useful for measuring exposure if it can be extrapolated to biomarkers in easily accessible fluids, such as blood. For example, immune mediators identified in the blood of vaccinated individuals that can predict vaccine immunogenicity would be informative biomarkers ensuring healthcare workers responding to an outbreak and individuals in and around an epicenter are fully protected. Furthermore, altering standard HIV testing to include biomarkers of early infection may be advantageous -particularly among individuals who develop HIV antibodies more slowly -as earlier diagnosis could translate to earlier initiation of behavioral modifications and antiviral regimens. Similar virus exposure does not have the same impact on all individuals and this variability is in part due to genetic differences. It is essential to consider host genetics when developing biomarkers. The integration of systems genetics into systems biology will allow us to better assess the impact of genotype, concurrent physiological factors (e.g., comorbid conditions, age and gender) and environmental exposures (e.g., diet) on viral infection both separately and in concert. For example, it has been shown that experimental manipulation of exposure to methyldonor micronutrients in pregnant dams can alter the development of offspring through the impact of the micronutrients on epigenetic modification of DNA [7] . Given the potential impact of epigenetics on disease, such studies reinforce the importance of studying intrinsic and extrinsic factors concurrently within the framework of a systems biology approach.",

Current studies examining the response to SARS and influenza infection between the parental strains of the CC project indicate a range of phenotypic response to infection between mice with different genetic backgrounds. There is marked distribution in weight loss among mice of different genetic background following infection with these viruses [Baric R, Pers. Comm.].

This is important as success in determining the host-genetic components to HIV has been relatively slow using the current techniques in isolation. Targeted investigation of CCL3L and CCR5 genotype and genome-wide association studies have indicated an association between HIV infection and variation at CCL3L/CCR5 genes [10] and HLA alleles [11, 12] , respectively. Subsequent targeted investigation of these genetic variants report that CCL3-CCR5 genotype impacts immunity during highly active antiretroviral treatment in HIV patients [13] , and may be useful in conjunction with standard clinical markers to predict risk of AIDS in HIV patients [13, 14] . Studies specifically examining alternate non-HLA genetic variants and HIV have at times indicated that reported associations for these variants may be largely driven by their linkage to HLA [15] . Furthermore, associations between genotype and HIV may depend on confounding factors. This is highlighted by studies that demonstrate the relationship between variants at cytotoxic T-lymphocyte genes and HIV depend on time and the cohort examined [16] . With systems biology approaches, we may be able to uncover the mechanisms underlying these associations.",

For example, single amino acid substitution, H274Y, in the influenza glycoprotein neuraminidase is sufficient to confer Tamiflu resistance in highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses [17] . Recently, this mutation was detected in clinical isolates from H1N1 pandemic virus-infected patients receiving Tamiflu treatment, as well as in an individual who had not undergone drug therapy.

Limitations of using a structure-based drug-design approach merits expansion of antiviral research efforts to include cellular targets that may be exploited for therapeutic intervention. As proof of concept, pharmacological cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors R-roscovitine [21] and flavopiridol [22] have been shown to effectively block Tat-activated transcription of the HIV-1 long-terminal repeat promoter. Genomic and recent proteomic analyses from our laboratory have demonstrated virus-induced perturbations regulating cell-cycle pathways coincide with optimal viral protein production [23] . This implies HIV-and HCV-mediated effects in cell-cycle dysregulation are advantageous for viral replication, perhaps by prolonging the progression of cell death. Information unveiled from these studies presents further opportunity to investigate novel cell cycle-related targets, as well as interrogation of additional cellular networks including ubiquitination and nuclear transport pathways. Furthermore, Chan and coworkers reported that proteome changes detected in HIV-1-infected primary CD4 + T cells during peak viral replication are largely abolished in the presence of a non-nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitor, efavirenz, demonstrating that evaluation of antiviral effects during infection can be functionally validated with proteomics [24] .",

This demonstrates the promise of identifying a host factor or pathway common to distinct viruses. Cellular factors involved in vesicle biogenesis may also present an opportunity to develop novel therapeutics exhibiting broad-spectrum antiviral activity. For example, by modulating endosomal sorting machinery, such as Tsg101 or host factors from the endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) pathway, the production of multiple viruses may be interrupted. Enveloped viruses including HIV-1 and Ebola hijack these factors to facilitate viral budding, and studies have implicated a role for tumor susceptibility gene 101 in the replication of multiple seasonal influenza viruses (e.g., H1N1, H2N2 and H3N1), as well as highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 virus [31] .

A great challenge in HIV research is to understand what differentiates natural host infection from non-natural hosts, as well as immune correlates predictive of vaccine-induced protection. In macaques, SIV infection is pathogenic leading to the progression of AIDS, while African green monkeys (AGMs) pose a restriction to disease exhibiting only mild infection. To understand the molecular differences that underlie the mechanism of host restriction to SIV infection, transcriptional profiles were compared between nonpathogenic (AGMs) and pathogenic (Pigtailed macaques) animals during the acute phase of SIV infection [34] . The innate immune response differentiating these two SIV-infection models could provide useful biomarkers associated with successful vaccination. In a recent companion study, one distinction noted between pathogenic and nonpathogenic SIV infections was an imbalance between T-cell subsets. In macaques, there was a loss of proinflammatory-producing Th17 cells during the course of infection, while AGMs maintained levels of Th17 and T reg populations that were even found to increase during the course of infection [35] .

Several molecular signatures identified from their transcriptomics analysis correlated with CD8 + T-cell responses to the yellow fever vaccine (YF-17D) [36] . Similar associations were observed in a yellow fever vaccine companion study presented by Gaucher and coworkers [37] . However, contrary to the title of the study by Querec et al., a true systems biology approach was not taken into account in evaluating the immunogenicity of YF-17D. If computational analyses modeling Tcell and humoral cellular networks with vaccine-induced host responses had been performed in either of these studies, the authors would then have been closer to a true systems biology approach. In doing so, they would have been able to interrogate the cellular pathways and selected perturbations within these networks to more clearly define immune correlates of vaccine immunogenicity. Gene-expression analysis from YF-17D and TX91 NS1\u0394126 vaccine trials implicate early signatures of innate immune activation as having predictive value for subsequent phenotypic outcomes for these two unrelated viruses. Thus, although systems biology has yet to be fully applied to vaccine research, the approach holds great promise in identifying more concrete biomarkers of successful vaccination and, possibly, immune correlates for multiple viral pathogens.",

To improve our understanding of these complex systems, a greater breadth of high-throughput data may be required in order to help characterize these models. Metabolomics, including lipidomics and glycomics, among others, hold promise for assessing the host response to infection. Metabolomic data will give additional information regarding pathway activation and signaling during viral infection. Metabolomics technologies aim to identify and quantify the broad repertoire of small-molecule metabolites (e.g., metabolic intermediates and hormones) that are present in an organism. Since these chemical fingerprints represent the end products of gene expression, they serve as a functional readout of phenotype and provide a more complete picture of the biology of an organism and its response to perturbation. This rapidly emerging field is receiving considerable attention in the virology community. The integration of transcriptomic and metabolomic data has led to the observation that human cytomegalovirus institutes its own specific metabolic program, which occurs, in part, by virus-induced transcriptional changes that modulate the accumulation of select glycolytic, citric acid cycle and pyrimidine nucleotide biosynthetic intermediates [40] . Subsequent global kinetic flux measurements identified a dependence on increased nucleotide and fatty acid biosynthesis and further demonstrated that pharmacologic inhibition of lipogenic activities impaired viral replication [41] . [44] . Similarly, metabolome analyses of cerebrospinal fluid from SIV-infected macaques facilitated the identification of increased lipid species during infection-induced encephalitis and subsequent transcriptomics studies further uncovered a mechanistic link to increased phospholipase activity [45] . Of further interest is a recent study describing plasma metabolite changes that track the innate immune response occurring during murine infection with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus and provide a potential link between altered metabolites and virus-induced oxidative stress [46] . These studies demonstrate the potential of functional genomics technologies to provide a global view of the host cell response to virus infection, thus identifying candidate regulatory targets for molecular diagnostics and therapeutic intervention. These efforts have led to the identification of previously undescribed protein and lipid bottlenecks that are predicted to play a key role in HCV-associated metabolic reprogramming, and the identification of miRNA-mRNA regulatory modules that may play an important role in post-transcriptional control of apoptotic gene expression during HCV infection [45, 47] .",

Information from this approach will effectively culminate in providing the knowledge, drugs and vaccines to prevent the next pandemic or emerging virus threat. As we are being ushered into a new era of personalized medicine wherein all genetic and environmental exposures are considered in the development of individual treatment regimens, we can expect systems biology to enhance patient treatment options by providing more tailored drug regimens based on individual responses to therapies. At the moment, systems biology may seem to be taking the road less traveled. Yet, as Robert Frost aptly stated, that has made all the difference.",
