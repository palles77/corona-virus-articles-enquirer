In particular, the use of digital technologies to crowd-source and interpret volumes of public information from the Internet for signs of outbreaks-so-called event-based Internet surveillance (EBIS)-has received great interest because of its potential for early detection. The National Academy of Medicine suggests that new information technology, which has increased surveillance capacity even in lowresource settings, be fully exploited. 1 The United Nations recommends that the World Health Organization (WHO) create an open platform to manage and analyze public data on unusual health events globally. 2 Developing the capacity for event-based surveillance is also required under the 2005 International Health Regulations (2005 IHR), 3 an international law that binds 196 states worldwide.",

Existing tools pick up information quickly, but they are limited in their linguistic capabilities and suffer from low specificity. The bulk of detected signals-97% according to one study-are in 7 major languages (English, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Arabic, Russian, and Chinese), 7 raising questions about the representativeness of the information captured. Using a prospective dataset that approximates real-life surveillance conditions, another study found that the pooled data from 6 EBIS tools detected confirmed human cases of influenza A/H5N1 earlier than official reporting 93% of the time. 8 However, those timely true positives constituted only 3% of all signals, whereas the remaining were false positives and late detects.",

After some initial success, 9 Google Flu Trends missed the influenza A/H1N1 pandemic in 2009 and drastically overestimated seasonal flu levels in winter 2012-2013. 10 One problem was overfitting: 50 million candidate Google search queries were tested for fit with historic data on influenza activity, so the odds were high that some of the queries would match by chance. 11 Another problem was that Google's search algorithm as well as user behavior changed over time, so the system needed to be continuously recalibrated. 12 These challenges are not insurmountable, but they underscore the complexity of the task and the resources needed. Real-time feedback from public health practitioners can refine data analysis. The sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value of MedISys were raised by revising search strategies in light of practitioner input. 13 Moreover, EBIS tools work better with human moderation, 7 and they are more effective when used together rather than in isolation. The detection rate approximately doubled when 6 EBIS tools were combined, and overall timeliness improved. 8 Another study found that none of the examined tools could individually detect all studied events before official reporting. 7 Integration is likewise needed to reduce duplication from cross feeding (ie, when one tool draws data from another) and to standardize rumor verification protocol.",

This is because the 2005 IHR's requirement that signatory states develop event-based surveillance capability is one aspect of a broader strategy, other parts of which have encountered implementation problems. The 2005 IHR requires that signatory states build the capacity to promptly and effectively respond to outbreaks by 2012, with possible extensions to 2014 and 2016. According to the latest detailed WHO report, only a third of countries worldwide had attained the law's national public health capacity requirements as of late 2014. 19 The 2005 IHR requires the WHO to help countries respond to outbreaks when they request it. Yet recent publications caution that neither the WHO nor the international community at large has the capacity to provide the needed support and coordination. 1, 2, 6, 20 The 2005 IHR limits the travel and commercial restrictions that signatory states may implement to protect themselves from public health risks abroad. But noncompliance has been rife. 20 In short, it is not enough to detect early warnings of outbreaks, especially because the level of false positive signals is high. Many developing countries lack the infrastructure to conduct followup verification and response efforts, and the WHO currently lacks the resources to assist them. Without an effective verification and response system, the media attention resulting from an early warning can cause unnecessary economic havoc as other countries impose excessive restrictions to international trade and travel, or can lead to a diversion of scarce resources from basic health and nutrition programs to infectious disease control that may not make sense for the local population. An international funding mechanism is needed to safeguard the continued existence and advancement of EBIS, to provide access to all countries, and to strengthen outbreak verification and response capacity at national and international levels.",

Human input needed only for multilingual key word selection for automated textual analysis.Mobile app, Outbreaks Near Me, also available to public for free download.Automated program continuously scans internet for information on potential disease outbreaks. Machine learning system conducts text processing and classifies potential outbreaks by disease and event location. This information is then pushed to and visualized on a world map.
