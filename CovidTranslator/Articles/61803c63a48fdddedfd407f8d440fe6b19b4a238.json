There is an available vaccination program for preventing rotavirus infection, but it has limits and restrictions. Probiotics therapy could be an alternative method of antiviral prevention and modulation against rotavirus infection. In this study, we screened the antiviral activity of probiotic bacteria such as 3 Lactobacillus spp. and 14 Bifidobacterium spp. isolated from young Korean. Three of the bacteria, Lactobacillus ruminis SPM0211, Bifidobacterium longum SPM1205, and SPM1206, inhibited human strain Wa rotavirus infection in Caco-2 cells. Furthermore, these bacterial strains inhibited rotavirus replication in a rotavirus-infected neonatal mouse model. To clarify the mechanism of inhibition, we investigated gene expression of Interferon (IFN)-signaling components and IFN-inducible antiviral effectors. All 3 probiotics increased IFN-\u03b1 and IFN\u03b2 levels compared with the control. Gene expression of IFNsignaling components and IFN-inducible antiviral effectors also increased. Overall, these results indicate that L. ruminis SPM0211, B. longum SPM1205 and 1206 efficiently inhibit rotavirus replication in vitro and in vivo. Especially, the antiviral effect of Lactobacillus ruminis SPM0211 is worthy of notice. This is the first report of L. ruminis with antiviral activity. Anti-rotaviral effects of the 3 probiotics are likely due to their modulation of the immune response through promoting type I IFNs, which are key regulators in IFN signaling pathway.",

It occur a range of clinical symptoms including severe diarrhea, vomiting causing fatal dehydration, shock, and death. The symptoms normally disappear within 3-7 days, but may last for up to 2-3 weeks (Desselberger et al., 2009) . Antiviral therapy is not currently available for the treatment of rotavirus gastroenteritis; fluid replacement and zinc administration have been used to prevent dehydration and treat severe diarrhea (Chandran et al., 2010) . As one of the prevention, rotavirus vaccines are licensed in many countries and are used routinely. The incidence rate of rotavirus disease seems similar all over the world. However, the mortality rate is due to vaccination, fatalities are rare in young children in developed countries (Parashar et al., 2009; Chen et al., 2012; WHO, 2013) . Rotavirus vaccines are safe and efficient for preventing rotavirus gastroenteritis, although they have limits. The vaccination programs have difficulty distribution because of cost. So, new prevention or treatment agents to modulate rotavirus infectious disease are necessary.",

Probiotics are live microorganisms which when administered in adequate amounts confer a health benefit on the host (FAO/WHO, 2001) . Probiotics, such as Lactobacillus spp. and Bifidobacterium spp., are reported multiple potential health benefits including blocking gastroenteric pathogens, enhancing immune responses, and neutralizing viruses (Rolfe, 2000; Minocha, 2009; Zhang et al., 2013) . Preidis et al. (2011) and Sur et al. (2011) reported that probiotics such as Lactobacillus rhamnosus, L. casei, Bifidobacterium bifidum, and Streptococcus thermophilus promote the innate immune response and stimulate cellular multiplication of epithelial cells. Recently, some researchers reported that probiotics are effective in the treatment of rotavirus gastroenteritis (Dubey et al., 2008; Maragkoudakis et al., 2010; Ventola et al., 2012; Vlasova et al., 2013) .",

We selected 3 probiotic bacteria, Lactobacillus ruminis SPM0211, Bifidobacterium longum SPM1205 and SPM1206, that showed the highest inhibitory effect against Wa rotavirus based on the results of a plaque assay on rotavirus-infected Vero cells. These probiotics showed significant antiviral activity in Wa rotavirus infected Caco-2 cells. SPM0211 decreased plaque formation by 45% compared to the control group. SPM1205 and 1206 were also inhibited 10% and 23%, respectively. According to Colb\u00e8re-Garapin et al. (2007) probiotics could block viral attachment at the surface of intestinal cells by competitive inhibition during entry. However, these results did not confirm whether the probiotics inhibited rotavirus replication through modulation of the viral cycle. Therefore, we evaluated rotavirus RNA expression by treating Wa-infected Caco-2 cells with each of the 3 probiotics. All 3 probiotics demonstrated antiviral activity through inhibition of rotavirus replication. SPM0211 showed the most beneficial effects (40% inhibition) against rotavirus infection. SPM-1205 and SPM1206 dropped gene expression by 28%, 30%, respectively, compared to control group. Taken together, these results revealed that SPM0211, SPM1205, and SPM1206 inhibited Wa rotavirus replication and infection. We further investigated the antiviral effects of the 3 probiotics against rotavirus using a rotavirus-infected neonatal mouse model. The control group infected rotavirus lost weight from the fourth day after administration of rotavirus, whereas the normal group steadily increased in weight. In the SPM0211 and SPM1205 administrated group, the rate of weight gain gradually increased without weight loss. Although SPM1206 group lost weight from the fifth day, the rate of weight loss was small and the duration was short compared to control. We evaluated rotavirus gene expression to confirm the antiviral activity of the 3 probiotics. The SPM0211 group had a 56% decreased in rotavirus gene expression as compared to the control group. SPM1206 and SPM1205 reduced rotavirus gene expression 39% and 47%, respectively. SPM1205, SPM1206, and SPM0211 had similarly antiviral activity through inhibition of rotavirus replication in vitro and in vivo.

            "text": "Rotavirus induces inflammation by activating the cytokine response in intestinal epithelial cells (Rollo et al., 1999) . Interferon is a representative cytokine activated by inflammation. Type I IFNs, including IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2, are key components of the host defense against viral infections and possess pow-erful antiviral properties (Randall and Goodbourn, 2008) . IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2, released by virus-infected cells, binds to their specific IFN receptors and leads to activation of the Jak/STAT signaling pathway. Activation of STAT1 induces an IFNmediated antiviral response through effector pathways such as the Mx GTPase pathway, the 20,50-oligoadenylate-synthetase-directed ribonuclease L pathway, the PKR pathway. These effector pathways individually block viral transcription, degrade viral RNA, inhibit translation, and modify protein function to control all steps of viral replication (Sadler and Williams, 2008) . Recently, it was reported that several rotavirus strains suppress IFN production in rotavirus-infected cells (Pott et al., 2011; Angel et al., 2012; Shen et al., 2013) . IFNs have been used as anti-rotavirus agents (Feng et al., 2008; Pott et al., 2011) . Similarly, Park et al. (2013) reported that L. plantarum DK119 exhibits antiviral effects on influenza virus infection by modulating innate immunity. And Lee et al. (2013) reported that B. adolescentis SPM0212 inhibits hepatitis B virus through an IFN-mediated antiviral response. As mentioned above, probiotics have the ability to moderate the immune response and antiviral activity through activation of various cytokines. To clarify the mechanism of antiviral effect of novel probiotics, we assessed whether L. ruminis SPM0211, B. longum SPM1205 and SPM1206 inhibited rotavirus infection through an IFN-mediated antiviral response. The results of IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2 gene expressions were similar to the results of previous studies Park et al., 2013) . All 3 probiotics significantly increased IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2 levels. We founded that IFN-signaling components were also significantly upregulated by each of the 3 probiotics. Besides, treatment with SPM0211, SPM1205, and SPM1206 increased gene expression of IFNinducible antiviral effectors. These results indicated that novel probiotics modulate the immune response by promoting type I IFNs, which are key regulators in the IFN signaling pathway. Interestingly, the antiviral activity of the 3 probiotics was not congruous with the gene expression of IFNinducible antiviral effectors. The reason of above results is predicted that rotavirus suppressed immune response by various mechanisms during the infection period. Our data were indicated that the 3 novel probiotics have antiviral activity through modulating IFN-mediated innate immunity against the rotavirus infection.",
