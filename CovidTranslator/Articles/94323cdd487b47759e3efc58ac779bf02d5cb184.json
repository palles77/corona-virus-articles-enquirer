The present studies investigated the role of the chemokine CxCL10 and its specific receptor, CxCR3, in the host response to pulmonary respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection. Antibody-mediated neutralization of CxCL10 resulted in a significant increase in disease pathogenesis, including airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR), mucus gene expression, and impaired viral clearance. When the pulmonary cytokine levels were examined, only type I IFN and IL-12p70 were significantly reduced. These latter observations were reflected in reduced dendritic cell (DC) numbers and DC maturation in the lungs of RSV-infected mice treated with anti-CxCL10. Neutralization of the only known receptor for CxCL10, CxCR3, resulted in similar increases in pathogenic responses. When bone marrow-derived DC (BMDC) were incubated with CxCL10 and RSV, an upregulation of type I IFN was observed. In addition, T lymphocytes were also examined and a significant decrease in the number of RSV M2 peptidespecific CD8 + T cells was identified. These findings highlight a previously unappreciated role for the CXCL10:CXCR3 signaling axis in RSV-infected animals by recruiting virus-specific T cells into the lung and promoting viral clearance.",

            "text": "Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infects nearly all infants by age 2 and is the leading cause of bronchiolitis in children worldwide [1] . It is estimated by the CDC that up to 125,000 pediatric hospitalizations in the United States each year are due to RSV, at an annual cost of over $300,000,000 [2] . Despite the generation of RSV-specific adaptive immune responses, RSV does not confer protective immunity and recurrent infections throughout life are common [3, 4] . While RSV is especially detrimental in very young infants whose airways are small and easily occluded, RSV is also widely becoming recognized as an important pathogen in transplant recipients, patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), the elderly, as well as likely other patients with chronic lung disease, especially asthma. Recent data suggest that mortality for all ages combined have been approximately 30/100,000 from 1990-2000, with an annual average of over 17,000 in the US [5, 6] . These numbers are likely grossly underestimated, as RSV infection has not been examined in adults in a consistent manner. Thus, RSV not only causes significant exacerbated lung disease in young and old, but also is associated with significant mortality. Although anti-RSV antibodies are available and appear to alleviate severe disease, they perform best when given prior to infection, and few other options exist for combating the RSV infections in susceptible patient populations [7] .",

Chemokines (chemotactic cytokines) have been shown to correlate directly to the intensity of the inflammatory response and are induced by viral infection. In particular, a number of studies have demonstrated that CxCL8 (IL-8), CCL3 (MIP-1alpha), and CCL5 (RANTES) released during the RSV infection correlate to the most severe cases of RSV infection in infants [8] [9] [10] . More recently, chemokine production has been linked directly to recognition of pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) that are expressed during the viral infection [11, 12] . In particular, the recognition of dsRNA by either TLR3 or RIG-I pathways induces the production of type I IFN and chemokines, especially CCL5 and CxCL10 [12] . Blockade of CCL5-mediated responses in animal models of RSV appears to attenuate disease pathogenesis by reducing airway hyperreactivity and mucus overproduction [13] . Little information exists on the potential role of CxCL10 and its receptor CxCR3 in the development of pathogenesis during RSV infection. The results from previous studies, together with the one presented here, indicate that while both CCL5 and CxCL10 are expressed at significantly high levels in vitro and in vivo during RSV infection, CxCL10 appears to have a protective role to the host by reducing viral load and pathogenesis.",

RSV infection in Balb/c mice resulted in significant induction of CxCL10 in the lungs.

Resident lung dendritic cells (and macrophages) are among the first immune cells to encounter respiratory pathogens. Lung DC take up antigen and traffic to lung-draining lymph nodes, where they subsequently prime T cell responses. Pulmonary immunity to viruses and other pathogens also results in the accumulation of large numbers of dendritic cells in the lungs. To determine whether CxCL10 plays a role in the trafficking of these \"inflammatory\" dendritic cells to the lungs during pulmonary RSV infection, mice were treated with control or CxCL10 neutralizing antibodies and the numbers of myeloid (mDC) and plasmacytoid (pDC) dendritic cells in the lungs were assessed. In control IgG treated mice, RSV infection resulted in the dramatic recruitment of mDC to the lungs (Fig.  5A , approximately six-fold over uninfected controls -dashed line). Anti-CxCL10 treated mice had significantly fewer mDC in the lungs (Fig. 5A) . A smaller, but significant increase in pDCs was found in the lungs of RSV infected mice, relative to uninfected lungs (Fig. 5A ). CxCL10 neutralization had no effect on the accumulation of pDCs in the lungs of RSV infected mice. While the gate used to define pDC (CD45 + , low FSC, low SSC, CD11c int , B220 + ) may include some NK DC (~20% DX5 + in both control and CxCL10 neutralized mice, Table 2 ), 50% of the CD11c + B220 + cells co-express Gr-1 (Table 2 ). These data confirm that these cells are predominantly pDC, and CxCL10 neutralization did not affect pDC trafficking to the lungs. This result was unexpected, however, as pDC in the lungs expressed CxCR3 at higher levels than did mDC (Fig. 4B ). CxCL10 neutralization did not affect the recruitment of NK cells or monocyte/macrophages (Fig. 5A ). These results demonstrate that CxCL10 promotes recruitment of mDC to the lungs during RSV infection, but since mDC expressed low levels of CxCR3, relative to pDC, this effect may be indirect.",

BMDC were CD11b + , consistent with published reports, and expressed moderate levels of CxCR3 (Fig. 8A ). RSV infection of BMDC induced dramatic increases in Ifn\u03b14, and CxCL10 treatment of RSV infected BMDC augmented IFN\u03b14 mRNA expression (Fig. 8B) . Interestingly, RSV replication/transcription, as assessed by RSV G protein expression, was significantly decreased in CxCL10 treated BMDC, compared to DC treated with media alone (Fig. 8B) . The addtion of CxCL10 did not directly promote RSVinduced IL-12 production or MHC II up-regulation.

In the present study the role of CxCL10 and CxCR3 induced during RSV infection has been carefully explored using a murine model of disease. The neutralization of either CxCL10 or CxCR3 led to a similar exacerbation of disease pathogenesis with significant increases in AHR and mucus gene expression. These data correlated with the reduction in DC accumulation and viral specific CD8 + T cell numbers. The increased presence of virus gene expression after blocking this mediator cascade indicates that the activation event induced by this chemokine-receptor pair is critical to the function of the anti-viral responses. Furthermore, these results demonstrate that CxCL10 plays a role in modulating the host response to pulmonary RSV infection via promoting leukocyte recruitment and has a role in the trafficking and function of dendritic cells. The expression of CxCL10 has been observed in several models of respiratory virus infection, including Sendai, influenza, SARS-CoV, and adenovirus [20] [21] [22] [23] , as well as in neurogenic viral responses [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] .

A number of studies have shown that type I IFN promotes dendritic cell maturation and costimulatory molecule expression [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] . Recent studies from our laboratory have shown that, in the absence of type I IFN signaling, RSV infected dendritic cells do not mature [34] . Thus, considerable evidence links type I IFN to dendritic cell maturation. Taken together, these results suggest that a likely mechanism for the dendritic cell maturation defect observed in CxCL10 neutralized mice (and consequently impaired T cell response) is a defect in the induction of type I IFN. We suggest that CxCL10 promotes type I IFN in CxCR3 expressing cells (likely pDC in vivo), which in turn promotes mDC maturation via type I IFN.",

            "text": "Clinical studies have suggested that the severity of RSV-induced disease correlates with the influx of leukocytes that lead to the damage in the airways [3] . In particular, studies demonstrated that a number of other chemokines released within the airways during RSV infection, including CxCL8 (IL-8), CCL3 (MIP-1alpha), and CCL5 (RANTES), correlate to the most severe cases of RSV infection in infants [8] [9] [10] [35, 36] . Two of these chemokines, CCL3 and CCL5, have also been shown to be associated with inflammatory responses in animal models of RSV infection. CCL3 has been linked to the severity of primary RSVinduced inflammation as well as with multiple infections with RSV. Furthermore, Domachowske et al [37] demonstrated that infection of mice with paramyxovirus induces increased CCL3 related to eosinophil and PMN recruitment. Likewise, studies examining CCL5 indicate a significant impact on the pathophysiologic responses in primary RSV infection as well as the pattern of leukocyte recruitment and leukotriene release in the lungs during RSV-induced allergen exacerbated disease [13, 38] . Previous studies have also found that the overproduction of mucus and development of airway hyperreactivity is directly related to the expression and activation of CxCR2 (an IL-8 receptor homolog) in mice [39] . At the same time the overproduction of CxCL10, a chemokine clearly associated with viral clearance and disease resolution, is also highly induced by RSV [14, 40, 41] . The overexpression of CxCR3 and CxCL10 ligand appears to mediate a protective response to RSV and therefore this represents a balance for the CCL5/CCR1-induced pathophysiology. In contrast, using a combination of reagents to block CCL5 or CCR1\u2212/\u2212 mice numerous studies have shown that this highly expressed chemokine/receptor pathway corresponds to a detrimental pathologic consequence [13, 37, 38, 42, 43] . Thus, it appears that the appropriate activation and recruitment of CxCR3 + DC and T cell populations mediate a less pathogenic immune environment, while blocking the CCR1/CCL5-mediated pathway would provide a potential therapeutic strategy.",

One well-characterized mechanism via TLR-mediated activation of CxCL10 has been demonstrated in several viral systems including RSV [12, [44] [45] [46] . Initial studies using Poly-I:C to activate CxCL10 production demonstrated that it was one of the highest expressed cytokines during the activation of multiple cell populations including epithelial cells, fibroblasts and astrocytes [44, [47] [48] [49] [50] [51] . More recently, the activation of other dsRNAmediated pathways have also been identified in the overproduction of CxCL10, as well as other IFN-inducible chemokines, including RIG-I and PKR [52] [53] [54] . Additionally, these pathways promote the activation of type I IFN production that provides additional increases in CxCL10 production, thus further augmenting its production within the system and enhancing the anti-viral environment.",

Studies originally identified CxCR3 expression on Th1 CD4 + T cells but not on Th2 T cell populations, indicating a clear dichotomy in recruitment and function [55, 56] . Subsequent studies have identified that CD8 + cytotoxic T cells can also differentially express chemokine receptors, depending upon their state of activation [57, 58] . While there is still a paucity of data that fully define the receptor patterns on CD8 + T cells, CxCR3 appears to be defining for efficient recruitment of cytotoxic T cells for viral clearance in several infection models [25, 26, [59] [60] [61] [62] . A mechanistic picture of the importance of CxCR3 in effective Th1 type anti-viral immunity continues to be developed but also includes the appropriate recruitment of DC populations [21, [63] [64] [65] [66] . In particular, the migration of pDCs into the lymph node from the site of viral infection was found to depend upon CxCR3 providing activation signals for lymph node DC to properly activate efficient anti-HSV immunity [21] . The latter studies suggested that CxCR3 recruited pDC provided type I IFN signals in the lymph node that allowed the activation of the T cell populations. In the present studies we have also observed that pDC preferentially express CxCR3. Furthermore, previous studies have demonstrated a key role of pDC in the clearance of RSV and the maintenance of an effective, non-pathogenic response to RSV [67, 68] . Overall, our studies identify a key chemokine receptor system that initiates and maintains the proper immune environment for anti-viral responses.",

CxCR3 expressing T cells and dendritic cells were detected in anti-CxCR3 treated mice, demonstrating that these antibodies are neutralizing, but not depleting. Serum from immunized rabbits were titered by ELISA and verified for minimal cross-reactivity to a panel of other chemokines and cytokines. Antibodies were purified from total serum by protein A-based affinity columns and the concentration of antibody was determined by spectrophotometry. Neutralizing antibodies (3.5mg/mouse) were administered via intraperitoneal injection 1 day prior to RSV infection and then every 3 days. The efficacy of anti-CxCL10 antibody neutralization in the lungs is shown in Table 1 .",
