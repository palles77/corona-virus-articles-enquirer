This is a rich area of study that includes a vast set of case studies suggesting some important regularities. With that empirical perspective, we then discuss insights from the epidemiology and random graph literatures that help shed light on the spread of infections throughout a society. Contagion of this form can be thought of as a basic, but important, form of social interaction, where the social structure largely determines patterns of diffusion. This literature presents a rich understanding of questions such as: \"How densely connected does a society have to be in order to have an infection reach a nontrivial fraction of its members?,\" \"How does this depend on the infectiousness of the disease?,\" \"How does it depend on the particulars of the social network in place?,\" \"Who is most likely to become infected?,\" and \"How widespread is an infection likely to be?,\" among others. The results on this apply beyond infectious diseases, and touch upon issues ranging from the spread of information to the proliferation of ideas.",

In fact, though disease and the transmission of certain ideas and bits of information can be modeled through mechanical or purely probabilistic sorts of diffusion processes, there are other important situations where individuals take decisions and care about how their social neighbors or peers behave. This applies to decisions of which products to buy, which technology to adopt, whether or not to become educated, whether to learn a language, how to vote, and so forth. Such interactions involve equilibrium considerations and often have multiple potential outcomes. For example, an agent might care about the proportion of neighbors adopting a given action, or might require some threshold of stimulus before becoming convinced to take an action, or might want to take an action that is different from that of his or her neighbors (e.g., free-riding on their information gathering if they do gather information, but gathering information him or herself if neighbors do not).",

First, there are crosssectional studies that concentrate on a snapshot of time and look for correlations between social interaction patterns and observable behaviors. This class relates to the analysis below of strategic games played by a network of agents. While it can be very useful in identifying correlations, it is important to keep in mind that identifying causation is complicated without the fortuitous exogenous variation or structural underpinnings. Second, there are longitudinal studies that take advantage of the inherent dynamics of diffusion. Such studies have generated a number of interesting observations and are more suggestive of some of the insights the theoretical literature on diffusion has generated. Nonetheless, these sorts of studies also face challenges in identifying causation because of potential unobserved factors that may contemporaneously influence linked individuals.",

Influential studies by Granovetter (1973 Granovetter ( , 1985 Granovetter ( , 1995 show that even casual or infrequent acquaintances (weak ties) can play a role in diffusing information. Those studies were based on interviews that directly ask subjects how they obtained information about their current jobs. Other studies, based on outcomes, such as Topa (2001), Conley and Topa (2002) , and Bayer, Ross, and Topa (2008) , identify local correlations in employment status within neighborhoods in Chicago, and consider neighborhoods that go beyond the geographic but also include proximity in other socioeconomic dimensions, examining the extent to which local interactions are important for employment outcomes. Bandiera, Barankay, and Rasul (2008) create a bridge between network formation (namely, the creation of friendships amongst fruit pickers) and the effectiveness of different labor contracts. The extensive literature on networks in labor markets 1 documents the important role of social connections in transmitting information about jobs, and also differentiates between different types of social contacts and shows that even weak ties can be important in relaying information.",

Individuals are heterogeneous (at least in behaviors), and some specialize in becoming well informed on certain subjects, and then information and opinions diffuse to other less informed individuals via conversations with these opinion leaders. Lazarsfeld, Berelson, and Gaudet (1944) study voting decisions in an Ohio town during the 1940 U.S. presidential campaign, and document the presence and significance of such opinion leaders. Katz and Lazarsfeld (1955) interviewed women in Decatur, Illinois, and asked about a number of things such as their views on household goods, fashion, movies, and local public affairs. When women showed a change in opinion in follow-up interviews, Katz and Lazarsfeld traced influences that led to the change in opinion, again finding evidence for the presence of opinion leaders.",

Whether or not products reach such mavens can influence the success of a product, independently of the product's quality. Tucker (2008) uses micro-data on the adoption and use of a new video-messaging technology in an investment bank consisting of 2118 employees. Tucker notes the effects of the underlying network in that employees follow the actions of those who either have formal power, or informal influence (which is, to some extent, endogenous to a social network).",

            "text": "While cross-sectional studies are tremendously interesting in that they suggest dimensions on which social interactions may have an impact, they face many empirical challenges. Most notably, correlations between behaviors and outcomes of individuals and their peers may be driven by common unobservables and therefore be spurious. Given the strong homophily patterns in many social interactions, individuals who associate with each other often have common unobserved traits, which could lead them to similar behaviors. This makes it difficult to draw (causal) conclusions from empirical analysis of the social impact on diffusion of behaviors based on cross-sectional data. 2 Given some of the challenges with causal inference based on pure observation, laboratory experiments and field experiments are quite useful in eliciting the effects of real-world networks on fully controlled strategic interactions, and are being increasingly utilized. As an example, Leider, Mobius, Rosenblat, and Do (2009) elicited the friendship network among undergraduates at a U.S. college and illustrated how altruism varies as a function of social proximity. In a similar setup, Goeree, McConnell, Mitchell, Tromp, and Yariv (2010) elicited the friendship network in an all-girls school in Pasadena, CA, together with girls' characteristics and later ran dictator games with recipients who varied in social distance. They identified a \"1/d Law of Giving,\" in that the percentage given to a friend was inversely related to her social distance in the network. 3 Various field experiments, such as those by Duflo and Saez (2003) , Karlan, Mobius, Rosenblat, and Szeidl (2009), Dupas (2010) , Beaman and Magruder (2010) , and Feigenberg, Field, and Pande (2010) , also provide some control over the process, while working with real-world network structures to examine network influences on behavior. 4 Another approach that can be taken to infer causal relationships is via structural modeling. As an example, one can examine the implications of a particular diffusion model for the patterns of adoption that should be observed. One can then infer characteristics of the process by fitting the process parameters to best match the observed outcomes in terms of behavior. For instance, Banerjee, Chandrasekhar, Duflo, and Jackson (2010) use such an approach in a study of the diffusion of microfinance participation in rural Indian villages. Using a model of diffusion that incorporates both information and peer effects, they then fit the model to infer the relative importance of information diffusion versus peer influences in accounting for differences in microfinance participation rates across villages. Of course, in such an approach one is only as confident in the causal inference as one is confident that the model is capturing the essential underpinnings of the diffusion process.",

First, in a wide variety of settings, associated individuals tend to have correlated actions and opinions. This does not necessarily embody diffusion or causation, but as discussed in the longitudinal section below, there is significant evidence of social influence in diffusion patterns as well. Second, individuals tend to associate with others who are similar to themselves, in terms of beliefs and opinions. This has an impact on the structure of social interactions, and can affect diffusion. It also represents an empirical quandary of the extent to which social structure influences opinions and behavior as opposed to the reverse (that can partly be sorted out with careful analysis of longitudinal data). Third, individuals fill different roles in a society, with some acting as \"opinion leaders,\" and being key conduits of information and potential catalysts for diffusion.",

For example, Conley and Udry (2008) show that pineapple growers in Ghana tend to follow those farmers who succeed in changing their levels of use of fertilizers. Through careful examination of local ties, and the timing of different actions, they trace the influence of the outcome of one farmer's crop on subsequent behavior of other farmers.",

Seminal studies by Ryan and Gross (1943) and Griliches (1957) examined the effects of social connections on the adoption of a new behavior, specifically the adoption of hybrid corn in the U.S. Looking at aggregate adoption rates in different states, these authors illustrated that the diffusion of hybrid corn followed an S-shape curve over time: starting out slowly, accelerating, and then ultimately decelerating. 5 Foster and Rosenzweig (1995) collected household-level panel data from a representative sample of rural Indian households having to do with the adoption and profitability of high-yielding seed varieties (associated with the Green Revolution). They identified significant learning-by-doing, where some of the learning was through neighbors' experience. In fact, the observation that adoption rates of new technologies, products, or behaviors exhibit S-shaped curves can be traced to very early studies, such as Tarde (1903) , who discussed the importance of imitation in adoption. Such patterns are found across many applications (see Mahajan and Peterson (1985) and Rogers (1995) ).",

            "text": "Understanding diffusion is particularly important for epidemiology and medicine for several reasons. For one, it is important to understand how different types of diseases spread in a population. In addition, it is crucial to examine how new treatments get adopted. Colizza, Barrat, Barthelemy, and Vespignani (2006, 2007) tracked the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) across the world combining census data with data on almost all air transit during the years 2002-2003. They illustrated the importance of structures of long-range transit networks for the spread of an epidemic. Coleman, Katz, and Menzel (1966) is one of the first studies to document the role of social networks in diffusion processes. The study looked at the adoption of a new drug (tetracycline) by doctors and highlighted two observations. First, as with hybrid corn, adoption rates followed an S-shape curve over time. Second, adoption rates depended on the density of social interactions. Doctors with more contacts (measured according to the trust placed in them by other doctors) adopted at higher rates and earlier in time. 6 Diffusion can occur in many different arenas of human behavior. For example Christakis and Fowler (2007) document influences of social contacts on obesity levels. They studied the social network of 12,067 individuals in the U.S. assessed repeatedly from 1971 to 2003 as part of the Framingham Heart Study. Concentrating on bodymass index, Christakis and Fowler found that a person's chances of becoming obese increased by 57% if he or she had a friend who became obese, by 40% if he or she had a sibling who became obese, and by 37% if they had a spouse who became obese in a previous period. The study controls for various selection effects, and takes advantage of the direction of friendship nominations to help sort out causation. For example, Christakis and Fowler find a significantly higher increase of an individual's body mass index in reaction to the obesity of someone that the individual named as a friend compared to someone who had named the individual as a friend. This is one method of sorting out causation, since if unobserved influences that were common to the agents were at work, then the direction of who mentioned the other as a friend would not matter, whereas direction would matter if it indicated which individuals react to which others. Based on this analysis, Christakis and Fowler conclude that obesity spreads very much like an epidemic with the underlying social structure appearing to play an important role.",

This then makes it appear as if one agent's behavior closely followed another's, even when it may simply be due to both having experienced a common external event that prompted their behaviors. Aral, Muchnik, and Sundararajan (2009) provide an idea of how large this effect can be, by carefully tracking individual characteristics and then using propensity scores (likelihoods of having neighbors with certain behaviors) to illustrate the extent to which one can over-estimate diffusion effects by not accounting for common backgrounds of connected individuals.",

It could be that similar behavior in fact comes from a process of selection (assortative pairing), in which similarity precedes association. Alternatively, it could be a consequence of a process of socialization, in which association leads to similarity. In that respect, tracking connections and behaviors over time is particularly useful. Kandel (1978) concentrated on adolescent friendship pairs and examined the levels of homophily on four attributes (frequency of current marijuana use, level of educational aspirations, political orientation, and participation in minor delinquency) at various stages of friendship formation and dissolution. She noted that observed homophily in friendship dyads resulted from a significant combination of both types of processes, so that individuals emulated their friends, but also tended to drop friendships with those more different from themselves and add new friendships to those more similar to themselves. 7 In summary, let us mention a few of the important conclusions obtained from studies of diffusion. First, not only are behaviors across socially connected individuals correlated, but individuals do influence each other. While this may sound straightforward, it takes careful control to ensure that it is not unobserved correlated traits or influences that lead to similar actions by connected individuals, as well as an analysis of similarities between friends that can lead to correlations in their preferences and the things that influence them. Second, in various settings, more socially connected individuals adopt new behaviors and products earlier and at higher rates. Third, diffusion exhibits specific patterns over time, and specifically there are many settings where an \"S\"-shaped pattern emerges, with adoption starting slowly, then accelerating, and eventually asymptoting. Fourth, many diffusion processes are affected by the specifics of the patterns of interaction.",

The Bass model provides a clear intuition for why adoption curves would be S-shaped. Indeed, when the adoption process begins, imitation plays a minor role (relative to innovation) since not many agents have adopted yet and so the volume of adopters grows slowly. As the number of adopters increases, the process starts to accelerate as now innovators are joined by imitators. The process eventually starts to slow down, in part simply because there are fewer agents left to adopt (the term 1\u00c0G(t) in (1) eventually becomes small).

For instance, if F is concave with an initial slope greater than 1 and an eventual slope less than 1, this is satisfied. Note that the S-shape of adoption over time does not translate into an S-shape of F -but rather a sort of concavity. 10 The idea is that we initially need a rapid level of change, which corresponds to an initially high slope of F, and then a slowing down, which corresponds to a lower slope of F. Fashions and Random Matching. A different approach than that of the Bass model is taken by Pesendorfer (1995) , who considers a model in which individuals are randomly matched and new fashions serve as signaling instruments for the creation of matches.

Another influence on collective behavior derives from social learning. This can happen without any direct complementarities in actions, but due to information flow about the potential payoffs from different behaviors. If people discuss which products are worth buying, or which technologies are worth adopting, books worth reading, and so forth, even without any complementarities in behaviors, one can end up with cascades in behavior, as people infer information from others' behaviors and can (rationally) imitate them.

Random graph theory provides a tractable base for understanding characteristics important for diffusion, such as the structure and size of the components of a network, maximally connected subnetworks. 13 Before presenting some results, let us talk through some of the ideas in the context of what is known as the Reed-Frost model. 14 Consider, for example, the spread of a disease. Initially, some individuals in the society are infected through mutations of a germ or other exogenous sources. Consequently, some of these individuals' neighbors are infected through contact, while others are not. This depends on how virulent the disease is, among other things. In this application, it makes sense (at least as a starting point) to assume that becoming infected or avoiding infection is not a choice; 11 Such a description is not complete, in that it does not specify the potential correlations between degrees of different individuals on the network. See Galeotti, Goyal, Jackson, Vega-Redondo, and Yariv (2010) for more details. 12 In principle, one would want to calibrate degree distributions with actual data. The literature on network formation, see Bloch and Dutta (Chapter 16, this volume) and Jackson (Chapter 12, this volume), suggests some insights on plausible degree distributions P(d). 13 Formally, these are the subnetworks projected induced by maximal sets C N of nodes such any two distinct nodes in C are path connected within C.

That is, if p(n) over 1/n tends to infinity, then the probability of having a giant component tends to 1, while if p(n) over 1/n tends to 0, then the probability of having a giant component tends to 0. \u2022 The threshold for the network to be connected (so that every two nodes have a path between them) is log(n)/n, corresponding to an average degree that is proportional to log(n). The logic for the first threshold is easy to explain, though the proof is rather involved. To heuristically derive the threshold for the emergence of a giant component, consider following a link out of a given node. We ask whether or not one would expect to be able to find a link to another node from that one. If the expected degree is much smaller than 1, then following the few (if any) links from any given node is likely to lead to dead-ends. In contrast, when the expected degree is much higher than 1, then from any given node, one expects to be able to reach more nodes, and then even more nodes, and so forth, and so the component should expand outward.",

Effectively, an agent just needs at least one agent in his or her neighborhood to take action 1 to enjoy its full benefits, but prefers that it be someone else given that the action is costly and there is no additional benefit beyond one person taking the action. Note that, since c < 1, in any (pure strategy) Nash equilibrium, for any player i with k neighbors, it must be the case that one of the agents in the neighborhood chooses the action 1.

His analysis pertained to identifying social structures conducive to contagion, where a small fraction of the population choosing one action leads to that action spreading across the entire population. The main insight from Morris (2000) is that maximal contagion occurs when the society has certain sorts of cohesion properties, where there are no groups (among those not initially infected) that are too inward looking in terms of their connections. In order to identify the full set of stable of equilibria using the above formalization, consider a diffusion process governed by best responses in discrete time (following Yariv (2005, 2007) ). At time t \u00bc 0, a fraction x 0 of the population is exogenously and randomly assigned the action 1, and the rest of the population is assigned the action 0. At each time t > 0, each agent, including the agents assigned to action 1 at the outset, best responds to the distribution of agents choosing the action 1 in period t\u00c01, accounting for the number of neighbors they have and presuming that their neighbors will be a random draw from the population. Let x t d denote the fraction of those agents with degree d who have adopted behavior 1 at time t, and let x t denote the link-weighted fraction of agents who have adopted the behavior at time t.

This work builds on the empirical observations of peer influence and generates a rich set of individual and aggregate predictions. Insights that have been shown consistently in real-world data pertain to the higher propensities of contagion (of a disease, an action, or behavior) in more highly connected individuals, the role of \"opinion leaders\" in diffusion, as well as an aggregate S-shape of many diffusion curves. The theoretical analyses open the door to many other results, e.g., those regarding comparative statics across networks, payoffs, and cost distributions (when different actions vary in costs). Future experimental and field data will hopefully complement these theoretical insights.",

This misses a central observation from the empirical literature that illustrates again and again the presence of homophily, people's tendency to associate with other individuals who are similar to themselves. Moreover, there are empirical studies that are suggestive of how homophily might impact diffusion, providing for increased local connectivity but decreased diffusion on a more global scale (see Rogers (1995) for some discussion). Beyond the implications that homophily has for the connectivity structure of the network, it also has implications for the propensity of individuals to be affected by neighbors' behavior: for instance, people who are more likely to, say, be immune may be more likely to be connected to one another, and, similarly, people who are more likely to be susceptible to infection may be more likely to be connected to one another. 29 Furthermore, background factors linked to homophily can also affect the payoffs individuals receive when making decisions in their social network. Enriching the interaction structure in that direction is crucial for deriving more accurate diffusion predictions. This is an active area of current study (e.g., see , Bramoull\u00e9 and Rogers (2010) , Currarini, Jackson, and Pin (2006 , and Peski (2008)).",
