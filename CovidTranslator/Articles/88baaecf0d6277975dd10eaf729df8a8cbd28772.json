The development of colonization is complex of delivery, the time of the first colostral feeding, the method of feeding, the volume of colostrum given and its immunoglobulin concentration. Inadequate colostrum-derived passive immunity during the monogastric phase may lead to enteric disturbances (Kruse, 1983; Gay, 1984a) . Calves born into a highly contaminated environment may become infected during delivery with enteropathogens carried by their dams or other cows. In spite of shedding the organisms some calves may remain clinically normal. Diarrheic calves constitute the main source of infection or contamination for the whole herd and for the environment (Radostits and Acres, 1980) . Infectious agents can cause alterations in intestinal structures and functions; they may promote the loss of normal defence mechanisms against secondary opportunistic pathogens leading to malabsorption and malnutrition (Archer, 1984) . Death may occur in older calves, when the primary causal agents can no longer be detected.",

A total of 1428 fixed smears were stained with an automatic staining device (Varistain 24-2, Shandon Southern Products Ltd., Cheshire, U.K.) according to the modified Ziehl-Neelsen technique (Henriksen and Pohlenz, 1981) . The sequential steps of the procedure were; immersion in concentrated carbol fuchsin (Merck 1358, 206, 1.0 g of fuchsin, 10 ml of ethanol, 90 ml of 5% phenol) for 20 min, two 2-min rinses with tap water, immersion in 7% sulphuric acid for 1 min, a 2-min rinse with tap water, and counterstaining with 5% malachite green (Merck 1398, 5.0 g of malachite green, 100 ml ethanol) for 1.5 min and four 1-min rinses with tap water. After air-drying the slides were thoroughly examined at a magnification of 400X and focused when necessary with an oil-immersion lens at a magnification of 1000X. The grade of infection was scored semiquantitatively as follows: 0 = no detected oocysts, + = 1 oocyst, ++ = 2--5 oocysts, +++ = 6--20 oocysts and ++++ = > 21 oocysts per field at a magnification of 400X. The oocysts were identified by comparing their size and internal structure with those of reference slides of Cryptosporidium, kindly supplied by Dr. Sv.Aa.",

If either of the methods gave a positive result the sample was considered to be positive for the virus in question. Each sample was studied by electron microscopy (EM), using a negative staining technique (Ritchie and Fernelius, 1969) . The supernatants were placed on carbon coated formvar grids and stained with 2% potassium phosphotungstate, pH 7.0. The grids were examined with a Jeol-Jem-100S electron microscope (Japanese Electron Optics, Beabody, Mass., U.S.A.) at a magnification of 40 000X. A latex agglutination (LA) method was used to detect rotavixus antigen (Haikala et al., 1983; Morinet et al., 1984) : 20 u[ of the fecal suspension from each sample was mixed with an equal amount of LA reagent on a glass slide from each sample. Negative controls were also made. The test was read after 3--4 min and was considered to be positive if a distinct agglutination was observed, provided that control suspensions remained milky.

The most frequent combination of infectious agents in the present study was Cryptosporidi,m and rotavirus. As suggested by Angus (1983) , Cryptosporidium appears to represent a complication of virusinduced enteritis. The shared anatomic location of both agents is the distal half of the small intestine (Pearson and Logan, 1983) . The data obtained from mixed infection with Cryptosporidiurn and E. coli or rotavirus and E. coli confirm the suggestion that under field conditions the enteric colibacillosis in which E. coli occurs either alone or combined with rotavirus is a disease of calves <4 days of age (Morin et al., 1978; Tzipori, 1981) . In experimental studies gnotobiotic and specific-pathogen-free-calves aged 7--12 days and orally infected with rotavirus alone showed an age-related increase in resistance against this agent; dual infection with E. coli and rotavirus tended to prolong the period of susceptibility.

The non-selective absorption of colostral immunoglobulins has been observed to decline linearly when feeding is delayed by more than 2 h (Busch and Staley, 1980) , however, it is not humoral antibodies but the lactogenic immunoglobulins remaining in the intestine that play a local protective role soon after birth (Busch and Staley, 1980; Gay, 1984a) . Calves that were assisted in sucking or fed with a nursing bottle for the first time remained non-diarrheic. Natural sucking with a functioning esophageal groove reflex leads the colostrum into abomasum. An esophageal feeder or bucket feeding deposits colostrum in the forestomachs, where it is delayed for some hours (Gay, 1984a) . Early sucking ensures normal gastrointestinal motility (Ruckebusch et al., 1983) and the transfer of the lactoglobulins to form a prophylactic barrier against infection in the intestine (Busch and Staley, 1980; Gay, 1984a) .",

Small amounts of colostrum offered frequently may be beneficial in retaining the pinocytic activity of the enterocytes for a longer period rather than a single large amount immediately after birth (Petrie, 1984) . The immunoglobulin concentrations in colostrum varies between cows, tending to increase until 5 years of age (Berger, 1979) . This may explain the decreased occurrence of diarrhea among first-, second-and thirdborn calves. The colostral immunoglobulin concentration decreases as much as 47% from the initial level during the first day of lactation (Berger, 1979) , emphasizing the importance of using first milking colostrum. Poor mothering, the pendulous udders of some cows and difficulties in calving have also been incriminated in a weak sucking drive and a failure in the passive transfer of immunoglobulins (Gay, 1984b) . Lower IgG1 and IgG: concentrations in the colostrum during the first postparturient day have been observed in cows with intramammary treatment at drying off (Geene, 1984) . A prolonged dry period also appears to decrease the average concentrations of IgG~ and IgA in the first milking colostrum (Geene, 1984) . The dams of the non-diarrheic calves (Groups 1 and 2) in the present study were found to have a shorter dry period than dams of the diarrheic calves (Group 3).",
