            "text": "Twenty-eight newborn Holstein heifer calves from the university herd and 8 newborn Holstein heifer calves from a commercial herd were blocked by birth and herd into 1 of 4 treatments: conventional [20% crude protein (CP), 20% fat] milk replacer (MR; treatment C) with (1) or without (0) human visitation, or a higher plane of MR nutrition (28% CP, 20% fat) regimen (treatment A) with (1) or (0) without human visitation. Calves on C MR treatments received 454 g of MR from d 2 to 41. Calves on A MR received 916 g of MR from d 2 to 8 and 1134 g of MR from d 9 to 41. Visitation with calves occurred at 1030 and 1430 h daily from d 1 to 56 and comprised verbal stimulation and stirring of starter grain. An opaque curtain divided the calf nursery, with calves in the front half assigned to visitation treatments and those in the rear half not assigned to visitation treatments. Calves were fed their MR treatment until d 43 (preweaning), after which all calves received half of their allotment of MR until d 49 (weaning). Calves were tracked for the next week until d 56 (postweaning). Starter grain and MR intakes were measured daily along with weekly body weight and skeletal measurements. One half of the calves on each treatment had blood samples taken via jugular venipuncture on d 41 (preweaning), 43, 45, 47, 49, and 51 (postweaning) to evaluate blood glucose, urea, nonesterified fatty acids, and cortisol concentrations. During the preweaning and weaning phases, calves on A0 and A1 treatments consumed more MR, less starter, and weighed more than the C0 and C1 calves. Calves on A0 and A1 had greater average daily gain (ADG), hip and withers gain, were taller at the hip, and had larger girths during the preweaning phase. Overall, body weight, withers and hip heights, and heart girths were greater in A0 andA1 calves during the weaning week. Efficiency of utilization of estimated metaboliz-able energy (ME) intake (ADG/ME) were similar. Glucose and nonesterified fatty acids concentrations were greater in visited calves preweaning. An interaction for glucose was observed during weaning, with A1 calves having the highest concentration and A0 calves having the lowest concentrations during weaning. Cortisol tended to be higher in visited calves during weaning. Postweaning, calves formerly fed A0 and A1 treatments had lower blood glucose and tended to have higher urea and cortisol concentrations than C0 and C1 treatments. The higher plane of nutrition fed calves tended to have higher cortisol concentrations indicating that they experienced more stress due to the removal of MR more than calves fed conventionally. Calves fed the higher plane of MR nutrition consumed more dry matter, ME, and water weighed more, had a greater ADG, and were taller than calves fed the conventional MR. These calves were more efficient (ADG/dry matter intake) when expressed on a dry matter basis, but had similar efficiency when expressed on an ME basis (ADG/ME). Visiting calves did little to reduce the stress of weaning when calves are fed the higher plane of nutrition MR feeding regimen.",

            "text": "Intensified (or accelerated) MR are formulated with a higher level of CP (26-28% DM) than conventional MR (20-22% DM) and fed at a higher rate than conventional MR (>0.7 vs. <0.6 kg/d of DM). Raeth-Knight et al. (2009) observed a doubling of BW by 8 wk of age in calves fed a high-protein, low-fat MR (28% CP, 16% fat). In that experiment, calves were fed the MR at either low solids (12.5%) or high solids (16.7%) until 6 wk of age; this feeding regimen is designed to maximize structural growth. Cowles et al. (2006) observed a pause in ADG in calves fed on the intensified program during weaning compared with the conventionally fed calves. In that experiment, calves were weaned beginning on d 42 and concluding on d 49 of life by only feeding half of the MR powder at the morning feeding. Postweaning, no differences were noted in ADG among treatments; this was due to the decrease in starter grain intake seen before and during weaning in calves fed an intensified program. Preweaning starter intakes were less than half of what calves fed conventional MR were eating (Cowles et al., 2006; Raeth-Knight et al., 2009) . Weaning can be accomplished in several ways, including removing one of the feedings per day or removing feedings abruptly. Sweeney et al. (2010) observed BW loss in calves fed upwards of 12 kg of milk/d and weaned abruptly compared with calves weaned gradually. Hill et al. (2010) observed reduced DM and OM digestibility in the immediate 3 d postweaning with calves fed an intensified MR program. These results (Hill et al., 2010 ) support the results of Terre et al. (2006b) , who observed reduced urinary excretion of purine derivatives from calves fed an intensified program. This same research group (Terre et al., 2007) observed reduced apparent digestibility of DM, OM, NDF, and CP the week after weaning in calves formerly fed an intensified MR regimen. Therefore, rumen development is likely limited in calves fed an intensified program. However, Davidson et al. (2013) found no differences in rumen papillae development by 84 d of age in calves fed either a control MR (20% CP, 20% fat) compared with calves fed an intensified MR feeding program (28% CP, 20% fat).",

            "text": "Behavioral studies provide some insight to losses in growth during the weaning period. When raised with a companion of the same age, calves were less stressed and showed no negative responses to being weaned compared with calves raised alone. The calves raised separately ate less grain and were more stressed during weaning (Chua et al., 2002) . When raised with a companion heifer of the same age and an older weaned heifer, improved results were seen in calf performance before and during weaning. Calves that had an older companion began eating starter at an earlier age, consumed more starter throughout the experiment, and showed few signs of stress during weaning compared with calves raised singly. These data indicate the importance of social learning for calves (De Paula Vieira et al., 2012) . Recently, Jensen et al. (2015) showed that pair-housed calves fed 9 L of milk and allowed to play consumed more concentrate than individually housed calves fed 9 L of milk, suggesting that social interaction will improve starter intake. These calves (pair-housed and fed 9 L of milk/d) also had greater ADG than calves fed 5 L of milk/d that were housed individually or in pairs, or those fed 9 L of milk but housed individually. These data indicate that social interaction can enhance growth and starter intake in calves fed a high plane of nutrition MR and possibly decrease stress during weaning.",

After each calf was visited, the researcher left the barn and locked the barn door again. Calves (C0 and A0) received some indirect visitation, as they were able to hear the researcher through the curtain.

            "text": "A pause in growth was seen in all treatment groups during the weaning week. Leading up to weaning, ADG of the C0 and C1 calves was 65% of the A0 and A1 calves. During weaning, most likely due to lower starter intakes for A0 and A1 calves compared with the C0 and C1 calves, ADG was similar across treatments; this was not observed in other studies. Cowles et al. (2006) observed accelerated MR-fed calves had ADG <20% that of conventionally fed calves during weaning. In their study, calves on the higher plane of nutrition MR consumed almost twice as much MR from wk 3 through 6, but about one-third as much starter. In contrast, calves on A0 and A1 in the current study consumed about 200 g less MR powder and about 50 g more calf starter per day than calves on the high plane of nutrition in Cowles et al. (2006) . Possibly, the stress of weaning was less pronounced in the current study due to the lower MR intakes and the higher starter intakes in the A0 and A1 treatments compared with those of Cowles et al. (2006) . Sweeney et al. (2010) fed calves up to 12 kg of milk daily and milk solids were calculated to be 12.77%; therefore, calves consumed 1,532 g/d of milk solids. Sweeney et al. (2010) evaluated starter intake using 4 weaning methods (22 d of weaning beginning on d 19; 10 d of weaning beginning on d 31; 4 d of weaning beginning on d 37; and abrupt weaning on d 41) in which milk was reduced by 0.55, 1.2, 3.0, and 12 kg/d respectively. Calves that were weaned over 10 or 22 d consumed about 200 g/d more starter preweaning than calves either weaned abruptly or weaned over a 4-d period. In their study, postweaning starter intake (d 41-49) was similar for calves weaned gradually (1-1.2 kg/d) compared with calves weaned abruptly (0.7 kg/d). The abruptly weaned calves weighed more at the end of the preweaning period then the calves weaned over 4 or 22 d. However, the abruptly weaned calves lost 210 g/d over the weaning period compared with the other calves. The calves on the 22-d weaning program, although weighing the least at the end of the preweaning phase, gained over 500 g/d over the postweaning phase. These data suggest that calves should be weaned gradually, especially when they are fed a large amount of milk. In Sweeney et al. (2010) , the 10-d weaning program was the most advantageous because calves did not lose weight during the weaning phase and weighed as much as the calves weaned abruptly. The results of the current study indicated that calves fed the higher plane of nutrition MR did not experience the reduction in BW in abruptly weaned calves (Sweeney et al., 2010) . Cowles et al. (2006) observed reduced ADG dur-ing the immediate postweaning phase in calves fed over 1,300 g of MR powder preweaning. These results were likely due to a combination of gradual weaning and consumption of about 200 g less MR powder and more starter intake. If calves were fed more MR, visitation may have proven to be beneficial in reducing stress and improve performance during weaning.",

Visiting the calf and stirring the starter grain was intended to mimic the care and teaching that cows and peers appear to do for calves (Lensink et al., 2000; De Paula Vieira et al., 2012) as well as to reduce stress typically seen during and after weaning. Visitation alone did not appear to have any effects on grain intake or calf growth, except withers height gain was lower in calves that were visited. During the preweaning phase, calves did not eat any more grain when they were visited and fed conventional MR. Postweaning calves formerly on either A0 or A1 weighed more and were taller, but DMI tended to remain lower than calves fed conventionally (C0 and C1). Jensen et al. (2015) observed greater concentrate intake and greater ADG in calves that were housed in pairs and fed 9 L of milk/d rather than individually raised calves fed 9 L of milk/d; our data do not support these results. Possibly, a longer duration of visitation (>30 s) could have resulted in improved performance in the visited calves. Also, providing a new pail of starter grain at each visit might have stimulated increased starter intake in visited calves, resulting in improved performance and less stress during the weaning period.",

During the weaning week, an interaction for glucose concentration was observed, with A1 calves having the highest glucose concentrations whereas calves on the A0 treatment having the lowest glucose concentrations.

Nonesterified fatty acids can be derived from dietary or adipose sources. In the current study, NEFA were only measured immediate pre-and postweaning, as well as during the weaning week. Possibly the act of visitation could have resulted in a stress and stimulate lipolysis on the last day of the preweaning period (d 41); however, only one sample was taken preweaning. Cortisol concentrations tended to be higher during the weaning week for visited calves. This could be due to the visitor taking a blood sample causing a stress in the calf. Terre et al. (2006a) observed no difference in serum cortisol concentration of calves that were individually or group housed and fed an enhanced milk replacer feeding regimen. Likewise, Sutherland et al. (2014) observed no differences in serum cortisol in calves up to 6 wk of age with different bedding types or space allocations. In 7-mo-old beef heifers, Hickey et al. (2003) either weaned calves abruptly weaned or did not wean and blood samples were taken beginning 168 h before weaning and at 24, 48, and 168 h after weaning. Those authors found no effect of weaning on plasma cortisol, but the effect of sampling increased cortisol concentration regardless of treatment. These data indicate that the act of sampling results in an increase in cortisol concentrations supporting our results. Immediately postweaning, blood glucose concentrations were reduced in calves formerly fed the higher plane of nutrition MR (A0, A1) whereas urea tended to be higher in these calves, possibly suggesting that these calves are transitioning to a ruminant. Concomitantly, these calves tended to have elevated cortisol concentrations indicating that they were experiencing more stress due to weaning than the conventionally fed calves.",
