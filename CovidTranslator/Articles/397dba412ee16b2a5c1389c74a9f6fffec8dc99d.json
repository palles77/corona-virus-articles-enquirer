The model takes into account the structure of the sexual network, the density of infected population in each individual's sexual partners, and a reasonable amount of the influence of noninfectious HIV positive individuals on HIV infectious partners which may occur in communities. In our analytic results, we give a precise epidemic threshold which, together with certain network properties, is then used to analyse and investigate the existence of epidemic and stability in the HIV spreading dynamics. Our results reproduce common observed patterns in the dynamics of HIV spreading in communities.",

In general mathematical models have been used in such complex problems to make predictions which help in the understanding of the infectious disease dynamics and thereby assisting public-health researchers and policy makers to prepare for, detect, and respond to these infectious disease threats. To date, most mathematical models [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] put forward to explain HIV spreading among humans are standard compartmental models based on ordinary or partial differential equations. Although most of these traditional models have succeeded in explaining important aspects involved in the HIV transmission, they have some limitations. Firstly, they assume a very large density of interacting agents [6] , yet in some communities the number of interacting actors maybe small; or even if it is large, the local number of interacting actors can be very low. These standard epidemiological models assume that interaction of agents or actors is random. For sexually transmitted diseases, however, random mixing is clearly a poor approximation of the underlying social reality [7] . Sex is simply not random (see, Ref. [8] ).",

Thus, these models provide a good approximation of virus spreading in networks where the contact among individuals is sufficiently homogeneous. However, most infectious diseases are transmitted through populations via links formed by contacts among individuals. The patterns of these contacts tend to be highly heterogeneous. For instance empirical studies (see, for example Refs. [8, 9] ) demonstrate that variations in the number of sexual partners is very large and while most people report 1-4 sexual partners during their lifetimes, some report several hundred or more. In recent applications (see, for example Ref. [10] ) of the standard models to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), the estimates of the basic reproduction number, R 0 , predicted by the model were different from the observed epidemiology patterns. This inconsistency was attributed to two factors, namely, the basic premise of standard models that all individuals in a community are equally likely to become infected (or infect others) and the fact that in standard models R 0 > 1 predicts, with certainty, an epidemic, whereas in practise R 0 > 1 does not guarantee that an outbreak will ignite an epidemic [10] .",

            "text": "As such various discrete models [12, 7, 13, 14, 10] have also been proposed to explain the spread of diseases in general. The starting point for most discrete models is the fact that the human population can be described as a network (graph) whose vertices are the single individuals and edges representing interactions among them. Analytic tools are then sought to conceptualise interaction structure at the level of persons and as such a cross-disciplinary field known as Social Network Analysis (SNA) is providing these tools [8] . These models have considerable success in capturing local behaviour of actors. Some of the limitations and applicability of these earlier discrete models are reported in Refs. [8, 11, 15] . Apart from assuming homogeneity and assuming particular propagation topology, e.g., models that are tailored to fit special-case graphs (BA power-law, Erdos-Renyi), most of these models have been prized as powerful tools to conceptualise static networks, but because sexual interaction is not static [8] , they are inefficient to make predictions. Another tool used in these discrete models is computer simulation. Although computer simulations allow for all sorts of heterogeneity of persons and networks to be easily built into the model, it is difficult to ignore the fact that this results in the model containing a very large parameter space. Consequently the model becomes much harder to thoroughly analyse than in an analytical mathematical model [8] . Further, some of the network models (for example, Ref. [11, 10] ) offer simple and accurate predictions, but are just not applicable to HIV studies.",

We model the above situation, i.e., the community and its sexual partnering by a graph G as follows. The vertex set of G is the set of people in which two vertices are joined by an edge if and only if the corresponding individuals have a sexual relationship. Thus, for example, the number of neighbours of a vertex is simply the number of sexual partners the corresponding individual has. At each time step we will, according to rules equivalent to R1, R2 and R3 above, colour the vertices of G using colours, white, red and black. The colours signify a susceptible individual, infectious individual, and a noninfectious individual, respectively. We will use the following notation. Let v be a vertex of G. Then c t (v) denotes the colour of v at time t and \u03b7 t (v, C ) denotes the number of neighbours of v with colour C at time t. If B \u2286 V is such that all its vertices have the same colour C , say, at time t, we write c t (B) = C . Now we play the following game on G. A move consists of an update of the colours of the vertices in a synchronised parallel way, according to the following rules: Initially at time 0 some vertices of G are coloured white and a few are coloured red and black.",

Moreover, our model has a high ability, through sexual relations (edges), to capture realistic patterns of mixing behaviour, which undoubtedly has a huge impact on the transmission patterns. Our results proved in Theorem 1 show that for a community, if R 0 < 1, then the epidemic does not ensue. Thus we have managed to find a single property of the network, \u2206, and a threshold value depending on it which informs us when epidemic is prevented. We have identified critical substructures S [v] , where v is a ''superspreader'', in the network and showed in Theorem 2 that the existence of these special substructures ignites an epidemic. Empirical evidence (see, for example Refs. [7, 18, 19, 8] ) reveal a high presence of such substructures in sexual networks of communities. Examples of graphs visualising these substructures are presented in Figs. 3 and 4. On one hand Fig. 3 shows the observed romantic and sexual network at Jefferson High linking 573 students. On the other hand Fig. 4 illustrates the results of the study in Ref. [18] where sexual network structure in a community was used as an indicator of a sexually transmitted disease (chlamydia) epidemic phase and graphs were drawn from historical contact tracing data set recorded. In Ref. [19] , the first sociocentric study of sexual networks among a general population of Sub-Saharan Africa, a giant sexual network of 1803 young adults in the sample villages was constructed. The network constructed has a high prevalence of these substructures.",

The observed tendency (see for example Ref. [20] ) is that no HIV preventive method, such as condoms, is used during intercourse with besties; preventive methods are only reserved for spares. In our substructure, S [v] , where v is a superspreader, the interpretation is simple. Every individual x in S(v) has only one partner v who, by default, is the individual's bestie. It follows that x will not take due care on interaction with v. It is therefore conceivable that the high prevalence of these substructures in empirical networks explain why there have been reports (see, for example Ref. [9] ), in some communities, of a low condom use during intercourse. Our results on substructures encourage policy-makers and public healthy campaigners to direct their prevention efforts on described superspreader individuals rather than pursuing any policy based on large-scale random distribution of the available resources. Thus while it is obvious that in the present form our abstract model is still a toy model, it offers an excellent starting point for relevant research in the subject.",
