Furthermore, MAb showing strong neutralizing activity in Felis catus whole fetus (fcwf-4) cells and Crandell feline kidney (CrFK) cells shows strong enhancing activity in feline macrophages, indicating that the neutralizing epitope and the enhancing epitope are closely related. In this study, we prepared MAb FK50-4 that showed a strong neutralizing activity in feline macrophages, despite the fact that the MAb belonged to the IgG2a subclass. However, MAb FK50-4 did not exhibit neutralizing activity in CrFK cells or fcwf-4 cells, thus showing a very unusual property. MAb FK50-4 recognized FIPV small integral membrane glycoprotein (M protein). Even when feline macrophages were pretreated with MAb FK50-4 prior to FIPV inoculation, this antibody prevented FIPV infection. This reaction disappeared after treatment of FK50-4 with protein A. The neutralizing activity of FK50-4 was also effective on feline macrophages after the cells were inoculated with FIPV. These findings indicated that the FIPV replication mechanism differs between feline macrophages and CrFK/fcwf-4 cells and that a neutralizing epitope that can prevent FIPV infection of feline macrophages after viral absorption is present on M protein.",

The causative agent of this disease is FIP virus (FIPV), which belongs to the family Coronaviridae, genus Coronavirus. In the field, feline enteric coronavirus (FECV) is also prevalent. FECV is antigenically similar to FIPV, and infection with FECV induces mild enteritis in cats. It has been noted that based on genetic and antigenic comparison, FIPV and FECV belong to one feline coronavirus (FCoV) group with a broad range of pathogenicity, rather than considering each virus as independent entity. It is considered that due to reduced immunity in the host (cats), mutation from FECV to FIPV occurs in the host, and the mutated virus induces FIP [23, 29] .",

However, it is also known that some viruses bound to antibodies invade macrophages via the Fc region of the antibody and the Fc gamma receptor (Fc\u2425R) of the macrophage, and eventually, the antibody leads to the enhancement of infection [1, 4-7, 14, 22, 24, 25] . Dengue hemorrhagic fever/dengue shock syndrome is caused by this infection mechanism. This phenomenon is called antibody dependent enhancement (ADE) of virus infection. The antibody against FIPV is also known to enhance the FIPV infection and accelerate the disease onset in cats [19] [20] [21] . Following experimental FIPV infection, cats with FIPVneutralizing antibody frequently develop FIP more rapidly and more severe than do sero-negative cats [19, 30] .",

We previously reported that in vitro FIPV infection of feline alveolar macrophages is enhanced by murine MAbs to the S protein of FIPV [9, 12] . This ADE activity increased with the MAb that showed neutralizing activity with feline kidney cells (CrFK), suggesting that there was a distinct correlation between ADE activity and the neutralizing activity [2, 12, 18] . The ADE activity was dependent on the mouse MAb Ig subclass, and this dependence was closely correlated with the ability of the antibody to bind to feline macrophage Fc\u2425R. Even among the MAbs that have been shown to recognize the same antigenic site, IgG2a MAbs strongly enhanced FIPV infection, whereas IgG1 MAbs did not [11] . The close association between enhancing and neutralizing epitopes is an obstacle to developing a vaccine containing only neutralizing epitopes without enhancing epitopes, and detailed analysis is expected.",

However, MAb FK50-4 showed only neutralizing activity even when feline macrophages pretreated with MAb FK50-4 were inoculated with FIPV. MAb 5-6-2, which was IgG1, used as a control, did not show any neutralizing activity in this method, although it showed a strong neutralizing activity in the method in which the virus-antibody mixture was inoculated into feline macrophages. We concluded that IgG1 MAb could not bind to feline macrophage FcgR, and then the MAb was removed by washing. In contrast, MAb FK50-4, which was IgG2a, may not have been removed by washing due to its strong binding to feline macrophage FcgR, expressing neutralizing activity. When protein A-treated MAb FK50-4 was examined by the same experiments, the neutralizing activity was lost. It was considered that protein A was bound to the MAb FK50-4 Fc region, blocking its binding to feline macrophage FCgR. Furthermore, MAb FK50-4 showed neutralizing activity even when the antibody was added to feline macrophages inoculated with FIPV. These findings suggested that MAb FK50-4 acts on cells after FIPV absorption into the cells and prevents the infection. Antibodies that exhibit neutralizing activity after viral absorption into cells were also reported for herpes simplex virus and adenovirus [8, 31] . Anti-herpes simplex virus glycoprotein-D MAb exhibited neutralizing activity after viral absorption in the cells, similarly to MAb FK50-4. Neutralizing activity was also detected in anti-adenovirus penton antiserum by the same method. Although the neutralization mechanism has not been clarified, FK50-4 may express neutralizing activity via the same mechanism as these antibodies. Furthermore, it was confirmed in this study that MAb FK50-4 recognizes M protein. Coronavirus M protein is thought to play an important role in the viral budding from cells [15] . Viral budding occurs after viral structural protein synthesis. When FIPV reacted with MAb FK50-4 was inoculated into feline macrophages, FIPV antigens were not detected in the cells on IFA assay, indicating that FIPV neutralized by MAb FK50-4 cannot synthesize viral proteins. Therefore, we concluded that the neutralization by FK50-4 is exerted by blocking a certain step in the FIPV replication cycle between fusion of cellular and viral membranes and translation. Further analysis of the mechanism is necessary. Since MAb FK50-4 showed cell tropism in neutralizing activity, it is possible that the FIPV replication manner differs between fcwf-4/CrFK cells and feline macrophages, and this also requires further investigation.",

[13] suggested that an anti-M protein antibody has complement-requiring neutralizing activity. We previously reported that certain M protein-recognizing MAb have enhancing activity. However, Vennema et al. [27, 28] found that when they injected FIPV to cats vaccinated with recombinant vaccinia vaccine expressing S or M protein, FIP onset was advanced in cats immunized with recombinant vaccinia virus expressing S protein, while three of eight cats immunized with recombinant vaccinia virus expressing M protein survived and the disease onset was not advanced. The enhancing activity of MAb on M protein that we reported was very weak compared to that of MAb recognizing S protein. There are many unclear points in the role of M protein in host immunity against FIPV infection, and further investigation is necessary. All reported IgG2a MAbs showing FIPV-neutralizing activity induced enhancing activity in feline macrophages, indicating that neutralizing epitopes and enhancing epitopes of FIPV are located at close sites. However, MAb FK50-4 showed only a neutralizing activity in feline macrophages despite its belonging to the IgG2a subclass. This finding strongly suggested the presence of a new epitope that can prevent FIPV infection of feline macrophages. FIPV infection of feline macrophages is thought to be important in the development of FIP.
