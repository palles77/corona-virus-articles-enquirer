SARS-CoV was detected in a day-14 sputum specimen from one casepatient and in five stool specimens from two case-patients. In one case-patient, SARS-CoV persisted in stool for at least 26 days after symptom onset. The highest amounts of virus were in the day-14 sputum sample and a day-14 stool sample. Residual respiratory symptoms were still present in recovered SARS case-patients 2 months after illness onset. Possible transmission of SARS-CoV occurred in one household contact, but this person had also traveled to a SARS-affected area. The data suggest that SARS-CoV is not always transmitted efficiently. Routine collection and testing of stool and sputum specimens of probable SARS case-patients may help the early detection of SARS-CoV infection.",

To quantify the virus load in respiratory and stool specimens, quantitative RT-PCR was performed using the TaqMan assay and standard curves generated from synthetic RNA transcripts (S. S.

The amount of SARS-CoV in stool from a case-patient with moderate diarrhea was similarly high to the quantity seen in a sputum specimen collected from a different case-patient at the same interval after illness onset. However, no virus could be cultured from any stool specimens that were PCR-positive for SARS-CoV, suggesting that SARS-CoV in feces may be present in the form of either nonviable viral particles or antibody-coated virus. The one household contact who became infected was the person who had more contact with the potential source case-patient during the first week of illness than did other members in the household. This contact was also exposed in Hong Kong along with her husband; however, she became ill >10 days after returning to the United States (16). Previously reported data suggest that the incubation period for SARS ranges from 2 to 10 days (4, 17) , but in some cases, the incubation period may be as long as 14 days (18) . Therefore, the possibility remains that this contact may have been infected in Hong Kong.

We only detected virus in three case-patients: in a sputum sample of one patient at day 14 and in stool samples of two patients at day >14. All upper respiratory specimens in the first 2 weeks after onset were negative for SARS-CoV by RT-PCR; this finding differs from a report in Hong Kong, where viral RNA was detected in nasopharyngeal aspirates of 68% of case-patients at day 14 (21) . Our inability to detect the virus in early respiratory samples may be associated with the type (nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs versus nasopharyngeal aspirates) of collected specimens, as well as with low amounts of virus generally seen in such specimens (1) . Sputum samples may have a higher concentration of virus than upper respiratory specimens (1), consistent with our findings. Stool specimens have been found positive more frequently than upper respiratory specimens during the 2nd and 3rd week of illness, which is in accord with the limited results of this study. The inability to detect SARS-CoV in urine may be the result of a late collection of urine specimens (>14 days after illness onset). A wider use of steroids in treatment of Persistent respiratory symptoms that were reported up until at least 2 months after onset by most of our casepatients were similar to symptoms observed by Avendano et al. (19) in a study of Canadian healthcare workers who were followed for 5 weeks after illness onset, suggesting residual illness in SARS case-patients. However, the progression of these symptoms over time is difficult to interpret without a better appreciation of the pre-illness symptoms. Antibody to SARS-CoV in some case-patients was documented as early as day 10 after illness onset. We did not have an adequate number of early serum specimens from other case-patients to determine when SARS-CoV antibody is first detectable.",
