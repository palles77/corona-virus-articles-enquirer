            "text": "Feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), a feline coronavirus (FCoV) induced disease, is almost invariably fatal with median life expectancy measured in days. Current treatment options are, at best, palliative. The objectives of this study were to evaluate a panel of nineteen candidate compounds for antiviral activity against FCoV in vitro to determine viable candidates for therapy. A resazurin-based cytopathic effect inhibition assay, which detects viable cells through their reduction of the substrate resazurin to fluorescent resorufin, was developed for screening compounds for antiviral efficacy against FCoV. Plaque reduction and virus yield reduction assays were performed to confirm antiviral effects of candidate compounds identified during screening, and the possible antiviral mechanisms of action of these compounds were investigated using virucidal suspension assays and CPE inhibition and IFA-based time of addition assays. Three compounds, chloroquine, mefloquine, and hexamethylene amiloride demonstrated marked inhibition of virus induced CPE at low micromolar concentrations. Orthogonal assays confirmed inhibition of CPE was associated with significant reductions in viral replication. Selectivity indices calculated based on in vitro cytotoxicity screening and reductions in extracellular viral titre were 217, 24, and 20 for chloroquine, mefloquine, and hexamethylene amiloride respectively. Preliminary experiments performed to inform the antiviral mechanism of the compounds demonstrated all three acted at an early stage of viral replication. These results suggest that these direct acting antiviral compounds, or their derivatives, warrant further investigation for clinical use in cats with FIP.",

The broad spectrum antiviral ribavirin demonstrated in vitro efficacy but provided limited clinical benefit and produced toxicity in cats (Weiss et al., 1993) . More recently in a small study involving experimentally infected cats treatment with chloroquine, a drug with demonstrated in vitro antiviral efficacy, was associated with mild improvements in clinical signs, however there was no statistically significant difference in survival time compared to untreated cats (Takano et al., 2013) . Efficacious and safe antiviral therapeutics are desperately needed for FIP treatment.",

FCoV FECV1683 was originally isolated from mesenteric lymph nodes and intestinal washes of a 1.5 year old female domestic shorthaired cat that died of acute haemorrhagic gastroenteritis while FCoV FIPV1146 was originally isolated from the liver, spleen, and lungs from a case of neonatal death in a 4-day-old male Persian kitten (McKeirnan et al., 1981) . Pathogenicity studies of these two isolates have shown that FIPV1146 is highly virulent and reliably causes signs of classic FIP following oronasal inoculation, while FECV1683 causes a low grade fever and mild enteritis, but no signs of FIP (Pedersen, 2009) .

Similarly variation in assay conditions may result in the calculation of significantly different IC50 values.

For both compounds these discordant results are likely attributable to testing at concentrations below their useful therapeutic range and variations in assay conditions and sensitivity compared with previous work. The screening concentration of compounds used in this study was determined based on cytotoxicity testing to achieve cell viability greater than 80%. Previous studies with ribavirin demonstrated IC50 values of 41.7 mg ml \u00c01 (170 mM) (Barlough and Scott, 1990 ) based on a visual assessment of protection from cytopathic effect and 2.5 mg ml \u00c01 (10.2 mM), based on the reduction of extracellular viral titre (Weiss and Oostrom-Ram, 1989) . The concentration used for screening (2.5 mM) was therefore more than 60 times lower than the IC50 previously calculated based on a similar assay endpoint. From the results of the current study, virus yield reduction assays appear to provide a more sensitive assessment of antiviral efficacy than CPE inhibition assays, with the IC50 values calculated based on viral titre reduction significantly lower than those calculated based on CPE inhibition for all compounds. A small antiviral effect of ribavirin cannot therefore be ruled out based on the current findings, as although the tested concentrations did not provide protection against virus induced CPE, it may have been associated with a reduction in extracellular viral titre. The practical relevance of such a small antiviral effect is questionable, particularly given the known toxicity profile of this compound in cats.",

Increased numbers of variably size cytoplasmic inclusions that accumulate the viral dye neutral red suggests these compounds result in a perturbation of the normal endocytic pathway in CRFK cells. Alterations in the endocytic pathway have previously been reported for chloroquine (Dean et al., 1984) , mefloquine (Labro and Babin-Chevaye, 1988) , and for amiloride and some of its derivatives (Dutta and Donaldson, 2012 ). This suggests a common physiological effect on treated cells for all three candidate antivirals and possibly a shared mechanism of action. Viruses are known to usurp a variety of host endocytic pathways for cell entry and intracellular movement and inhibition of these pathways may be a useful therapeutic approach. Although targeting a cellular pathway may be associated with an increased risk of toxicity, if that pathway is critical for viral replication this approach may slow or limit the development of resistance.",

            "text": "Time of addition studies demonstrated all compounds were most effective when added prior to infection, suggesting a mechanism of action involving early stages of viral replication. The CPE inhibition based time of addition assay involved infection at low MOI with a 72 h infection period, allowing for multiple rounds of viral replication. As a result of this, even with the delayed addition of compounds, cells uninfected by the original inoculum are effectively pre-treated prior to challenge with progeny virions produced during the primary replication cycle. Using an IFA-based time of addition study involving a single replication cycle we were able to further clarify of the effect of time of addition, and refine the possible stage of the viral life cycle targeted by each compound. Based on the IFA results chloroquine was effective only if present at the time of infection, supporting the hypothesis that chloroquine acts during cell entry for FCoV FIPV1146, possibly through inhibition of endosomal pH (Takano et al., 2008) . Hexamethylene amiloride and mefloquine provided significant antiviral effects when compound addition was delayed for up to 1 and 5 hpi respectively, suggesting that if the antiviral effects of these compounds arise through perturbation of endosomal function, the effects occur at different stages of the viral life cycle. Alternatively distinct mechanisms of action may account for the observed effects of these compounds, as suggested for other viruses.",

            "text": "There is limited published pharmacokinetic or safety data to inform the potential therapeutic application of the identified compounds in cats and given the relatively low SI of all three compounds consideration must be given to their in vivo safety in this species. The human approved pharmaceuticals chloroquine and mefloquine are generally considered well-tolerated drugs, albeit with a narrow therapeutic index, while the clinical use of hexamethylene amiloride has not been reported. Pharmacokinetic data available for chloroquine and mefloquine in humans would suggest that effective plasma concentrations could be achieved at standard therapeutic doses (Pussard and Verdier, 1994; Simpson et al., 1999) . Chloroquine has been shown to accumulate in leukocytes, where the concentration may be two orders of magnitude greater than that of plasma (Mackenzie, 1983) , with the highest concentration reported in monocytes (French et al., 1987) . Thus therapeutic concentrations may be attained in the target cells of virulent biotype FCoVs at relatively low plasma concentrations, minimising the risk of dose-dependent adverse effects. Mefloquine is known to accumulate within brain parenchyma at concentrations approximately 10-30 times higher than found in serum, with tissue concentrations of up to 50 mM reported (Nevin, 2009; Pham et al., 1999) . Mefloquine may therefore be useful in the treatment of dry (non-effusive) FIP, where CNS lesions are common (Pedersen, 2009 ) although the potential for neurotoxicity must be considered. Although the concentration of mefloquine achieved in the CNS is greater than the CC50 of this compound in immortalised feline kidney cells, in humans this tissue concentration is achievable at therapeutic doses, despite in vitro data in human cells showing a CC50 approximately equal to that determined in the current study (Brickelmaier et al., 2009) . It may be therefore that the more static cell population of the CNS is more refractory to the toxic effects of mefloquine than mitotically active immortalised cells.",
