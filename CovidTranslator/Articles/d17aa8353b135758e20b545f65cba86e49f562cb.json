These concepts are outlined and their relevance in designing control policies for outbreaks is discussed.

The 1918 influenza epidemic spread extremely rapidly and killed 20-40 million people worldwide. The world population has more than tripled since 1918, so high population densities, as well as increasing domestic and international travel, may facilitate such a pandemic. Improved surveillance, technological advances, and an increased understanding of epidemiology together enable societies to prepare for a range of possible pandemic scenarios. National governments and the WHO are monitoring human and avian cases of H5N1 and other novel strains, 4 antiviral treatments are being produced in large quantities for stockpiling by governments 10 and novel vaccines are being developed to protect against the avian form of the virus and being stockpiled by governments. 10 Despite these precautions, the exact characteristics of a potentially pandemic strain which may emerge cannot be predicted exactly, although ranges can be estimated from previous pandemics. [11] [12] [13] Therefore, it is essential to understand how the effects of such an outbreak might be contained, or at least mitigated, for a range of scenarios. Complex, often individual-based, models of influenza outbreaks, informed by re-analysis of previous pandemics, are being used to inform the design of public health strategies should a strain emerge which is capable of human-to-human transmission. 2",

When there are small numbers of cases and R 0 is large, there is a small probability that the epidemic will 'fade-out' after only a few infections because the early cases recover before infecting enough other individuals ( Figure 2a ). This probability of fading out before the epidemic takes off becomes smaller as R 0 gets larger. If R 0 is less than one the outbreak will surely die out.

The higher the transmission rate of the disease per unit time and the longer the duration of the infectious period, the larger the R 0 . A disease which is highly infectious for a short period of time may have the same basic reproduction number as a disease that is not as infectious but has a much longer infectious period. For diseases with similar characteristics the basic reproduction number is different for each population, as the opportunities for onward infection are affected by the contact patterns of a population. In a city where most people commute to work by public transport, for example, the opportunities for onward transmission of an airborne pathogen may be much greater than in less densely populated areas. For many directly transmitted diseases, such as measles 1 and pandemic influenza, 11 R 0 is usually assumed to be similar in unvaccinated populations. For sexually transmitted diseases, large differences in sexual behaviour within populations can lead to estimates of R 0 for heterosexual populations from 2 for low risk populations 17 to over 10 for high activity groups and sex workers. 18 Generation time, serial interval, T g Alongside the basic reproduction number, it is important to have some estimate of how quickly the number of cases of a novel infection will grow and how long an outbreak will last. The generation time, T g , is defined as average time from an individual being infected to that individual infecting others. 1, 14, 19, 20 This includes any latent period when the infected individual may not show symptoms or may not be infectious, and excludes any period when infected individuals may still be showing symptoms but are no longer infectious. It is sometimes assumed to be equivalent to the serial interval, which is the average time from when one person shows symptoms until the person they infect shows symptoms. 20 For SARS this was initially estimated as 8-12 days. 7, 21 Estimating R 0 from the epidemic growth rate, r",

If, however, the infection takes hold, the number of new cases grows exponentially. 1 The rate at which the number of cases will grow during this early stage, r, is dependent on both the reproduction number and the generation time of the infection, and can therefore be used to estimate the basic reproduction number. For a homogeneous population with onward infection occurring throughout the infectious period as R 0 \u00bc rT g \u00fe 1, but there are other formulations for different model assumptions. 1, 19, 22, 23 As for the basic reproduction number, the relationship between the epidemic growth rate, the serial interval, and the basic reproduction number is more complex for heterogeneous populations. 14, 19 In Figure 2c I have used this equation to estimate R 0 from first month of the SARS outbreak in Hong Kong in 2003 (Figure 2c ). The best fitting straight line to the log incidence data gives a growth rate, r, of 0.15 per day (equivalent to a doubling time 4.6 days). The generation time of SARS, T g , has been estimated to be 10 days from data on the number of days between the start of symptoms for individuals who infected each other. 7, 24 We can now use the equation above to get an estimate of the basic reproduction number for SARS as R 0 \u00bc 1 \u00fe 0.15 \u00c2 10 \u00bc 2.5. This relatively simple calculation gives a similar estimate to those made by more sophisticated methods. 7, 21, 25 The basic reproduction number for influenza has been estimated to be as high as 21, 26 but recent reanalysis of pandemic outbreaks estimate R 0 for pandemic influenza to be in the range of 1.4-3.0, 11, 12, 27 which is similar to that for SARS. The generation time for influenza is, however, much shorter than that for SARS, approximately 4-6 days, 11,27 which gives a doubling time of the epidemic of 1-4 days, much faster than was observed for SARS.

Estimation of this number during an epidemic facilitates quantitative assessment of the effectiveness of intervention strategies, with reduction below one meaning the outbreak being brought under control. 25, 28 During the course of the SARS epidemic in 2003, mathematical modelling was an essential tool in showing that intervention methods gradually brought the epidemic under control in Hong Kong, Special Administrative Region of China and Singapore, 7, 8, 25, 28 and that controls appear to have been lifted too early in Toronto, Canada. 29 Reanalysis of the 1918-1919 influenza pandemic shows that public health measures were effective in mitigating this outbreak. [30] [31] [32] Although R is an estimate of average transmission at a population level, individuals vary both in how they respond to an outbreak of a novel infection (such SARS) or an outbreak of a known infection (such as pandemic influenza), and in their behaviour in terms of the number of contacts that they make. 14 Some individuals, termed 'superspreaders', may transmit to many others either because of some characteristic of their infection, because of their contacts or purely by chance -being in the wrong place at the right stage of their infection. 7, 8, [33] [34] Care should be taken when gathering and interpreting data on possible exposures because they may be subject to bias towards previously identified sources and away from transmission from casual contacts; and may neglect asymptomatic transmissions.",

In the 2003 SARS outbreak in Hong Kong, the CFR was very low among the young (o1 per cent for ages o30 years) and increased to 55 per cent for patients over 60 years of age. 15 Very few cases were admitted to hospital among the very young, 6 which is unusual because children are often considered to be the group with the highest rate of transmission of directly transmitted pathogens, while also serving as a source of infection for their parents and other adults (sometimes called a 'core group'). 1 Serological surveys showed little evidence to support asymptomatic cases among this age group.",

If, however, the disease is mainly transmitted to close contacts, for example family members, then contact tracing may be manageable and effective. If transmission is likely for more casual contacts, contact tracing is much more difficult. Contact tracing has also been shown to depend on the degree of variability in the timing of infectiousness between different infected people in the population. 39, 40 Before large amounts of resources are allocated, it may be important to assess the effectiveness of such a policy early in an epidemic through analysis of transmission chains and the impact of the intervention on the effective reproduction number.",

Because of the short doubling time of influenza epidemics, these strategies would have to be implemented when there are very few cases. One such responsive strategy -implementing travel restrictions and prophylactic treatment of everyone within 10 km ring of each case -would require a stockpile of approximately 3 million courses of antiviral drugs to contain an outbreak of pandemic influenza. 11 Following the publication of this analysis by Ferguson et al, Roche donated 3 million doses of their antiviral drug to the WHO for this very purpose and the WHO has set up project to develop protocols for practical implementation of containment.",

[42] [43] [44] [45] The SARS epidemic of 2003 spread across the globe within a matter of days, eventually affecting 27 countries, with suspected cases reported in every populated continent (Figure 1 ). Public health measures, including screening and travel restrictions, can be put in place to slow this spread. The effectiveness of such methods, however, is dependent on the characteristics of the disease. If an infection has an incubation period which is longer than the duration of a flight then infected people are unlikely to develop symptoms during a flight. Thus even 100 per cent effective entry screening is unlikely to be useful in identifying cases. 45 Imported SARS cases caused new outbreaks only in the early stages of the global outbreak, because of effective exchanges of information about the disease, the lack of pre-symptomatic infectiousness, and local outbreak control. If an outbreak is uncontrolled, then the number of new cases continues to grow exponentially and sheer weight of numbers means that cases will be exported. Travel reductions of greater than 99 per cent will be required to slow the spread of influenza. 43, 44, 46, 47 Strategies aimed at protecting the public from pandemic influenza should focus resources on surveillance and rapid control of outbreaks wherever potentially pandemic strains arise. 48",

There are many clinical and biological tasks to be completed, such as formulating a case definition and treatment strategies, identifying the aetiological agent and developing diagnostic tests. Alongside these tasks the estimation of key parameters, such as the basic and effective reproduction numbers, the generation time, and the proportion of transmissions occurring before symptoms, are essential to characterise an outbreak and its potential scope. Estimation of the effective reproduction number during an ongoing outbreak also provides an early indication of whether an infectious disease outbreak is under control or not. CFRs are an important consideration in public policy and must also be estimated accurately.",

Integration of epidemiological and statistical approaches increases the power of such analysis and the usefulness of models. Both statistical analyses and models require high quality epidemiological data, collected and collated centrally while the outbreak is ongoing and made available for analysis. Prediction of the exact progress of an epidemic will never be possible because of the variability of human behaviour. Nonetheless, mathematical models, which precisely represent knowledge and assumptions about disease transmission add significant insight into the dynamics of infectious diseases and are increasingly recognised as a vital part of any public health policy development.",
