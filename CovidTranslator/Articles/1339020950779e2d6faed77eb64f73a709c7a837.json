            "text": "Earn CME credits at http://cme.ctsnetjournals.org Morbidity and mortality during neonatal heart surgery for repair of congenital heart disease has dramatically improved over the past decade; however, it remains higher than in older children and adults. 1 This is partly associated with the exaggerated disruptions of coagulation and the stimulation of the inflammatory response in neonates undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) for congenital heart disease. [1] [2] [3] The disturbances in coagulation that lead to postoperative bleeding in neonates are the result of interactions between many mechanisms. These include factors such as hemostatic system immaturity, hemodilution, systemic inflammation, prolonged bypass times, and the use of deep hypothermic circulatory arrest (DHCA). [4] [5] [6] [7] Increased bleeding and allogeneic blood transfusion requirements have been shown to vary inversely with the age and size of infants requiring cardiac surgery. 8 Transfusion of allogeneic blood products is associated with a number of adverse effects such as infectious agent transmission, the development of postoperative infections, and other transfusion reactions. [9] [10] [11] [12] Previous studies of the use of fresh whole blood to either prime the CPB circuit or meet postoperative transfusion requirements have reported conflicting results. 13, 14 No studies have compared the use of reconstituted fresh whole blood (RFWB) versus standard blood component therapy to prime the CPB circuit and replace postoperative blood loss within the first 24 hours after surgery. We sought to determine whether the use of RFWB during CPB and for the first 24 hours postoperatively would improve clinical outcomes compared with standard blood component therapy. initially created by the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic (March 2002) as well as difficulties in coordinating operations, patient consent, and blood acquisition explain why a lengthier enrollment period was necessary. The surgeons were blinded to the patients' group randomization, whereas perfusion, anesthesia, and cardiac critical care unit (CCCU) staff were unblinded. Institutional research ethics board approval was granted at The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada, with written informed consent obtained from the legal guardian of each patient before enrollment into the study randomization. An independent safety committee oversaw the study with no member having any clinical responsibilities for any of the study subjects and no ties to any of the study investigators. Sixty-four patients met the inclusion criteria of being less than 1 month of age and scheduled for elective cardiac surgery requiring CPB. Exclusion criteria included emergency surgery and patients known to have a pre-existing coagulopathy. Subjects were randomized in blocks of 4 to 6 patients to receive either RFWB in the prime of the CPB circuit and for all transfusion requirements up to 24 hours postoperatively in the treatment group (n \u00bc 31) or standard blood component therapy in the control group (n \u00bc 33). Required sample size was calculated on the basis of previous study of fresh whole blood versus component therapy. 13 It was calculated that a sample size of 50 patients would detect a 50% reduction in chest tube volume loss with alpha of.05 and power of 90%.",

In univariate analysis, chest tube loss at 24 hours in CCCU, inotropic score at 24 hours, duration of ventilation, and hospital stay were all found to be significantly associated with age of blood product given in the prime and throughout CPB, exposure to allogeneic donors, and platelet count at the end of bypass.

Only lower platelet count at the end of bypass and exposure to higher number of allogeneic donors were independent predictors of higher inotropic score at 24 hours. Lower platelet count at the end of bypass and older age of blood cells given in the prime and throughout bypass were found to be independent predictors of longer duration of hospital stay.

[9] [10] [11] Efforts should be made to reduce allogeneic donor exposure. The use of fresh whole blood has been shown to reduce postoperative bleeding in infant patients. However, recent transfusion medicine standards do not support its widespread usage. 13, 15 The preparation of the RFWB product used for our study followed the current CBS and hospital transfusion laboratory standard operating procedures, including duration of blood storage. The reconstituted product used in this study may be superior to tradi-tional fresh whole blood owing to pre-storage leukocyte depletion and the storage of platelets at room temperature. 16, 17 Pre-storage leukocyte depletion is a standard for blood component preparation in Canada, with the current filters reducing the number of leukocytes present in blood by 4 logs (10 \u00c04 ), a value below which it is believed that alloimmunization or suppression does not occur. 18 Platelets stored at room temperature exhibit better hemostatic properties than when stored at cold temperatures, which is routine in traditional whole blood storage. 19 The neonates who received RFWB had significantly improved clinical outcomes, including less postoperative chest tube volume loss during the first 24 hours in the CCCU, significantly lower inotropic scores, decreased ventilation time, and reduced hospital length of stay.",

An increase in the length of storage of PRBC has been associated with an increase in the risk of postoperative pneumonia and an increased duration of stay in the cardiac surgical population.

A few major issues with the study design are to be considered when contrasting both studies. First, the use of fresh whole blood for priming the bypass circuit only while using component therapy for further transfusion requirements might have obscured the effect of fresh whole blood. Second, the use of blood (in both arms of the study) that had not been leukodepleted could offset gains made by using fresh whole blood. Finally, morbidity and mortality rates in the postoperative period might have confounded the results and overshadowed any improvements made with the use of fresh whole blood. Furthermore, another study by Manno and colleagues 13 also found that the use of fresh whole blood for priming and for perioperative and postoperative requirements was associated with improved clinical outcomes, thus supporting the results of the current study.",

Nonetheless, many features of a fresh reconstituted whole blood strategy show that they are independently associated with improved outcomes: fresher blood, smaller number of exposures, and higher platelet count during bypass. Many of these features can be obtained with this modified component therapy protocol even when single donor whole blood is unavailable. As such, when single donor RFWB is not practical, an alternative strategy may include the use of reconstituted fresh components from multiple donors. This may replicate the effect of RFWB without the challenge of obtaining single donor products. The addition of fresh platelets in the prime will achieve a higher platelet count on initiation of bypass and throughout surgery, which was found to be an important element of the effect of RFWB. Because this assumption is not yet supported by research, future studies could focus on methodologies to emulate the effect of RFWB using different techniques when RFWB is not available.",

The enrollment period had to be extended owing to logistic issues that meant only a limited proportion of eligible neonates could be enrolled in the study. However, the date of surgery was not found to be associated with clinical outcomes. Further, the age of red cells and platelets in the component therapy group was older than that used in other centers but was within acceptable CBS standard operating procedures. The assessment of blood loss in the postoperative period only took into account drainage from chest tubes and did not account for potential blood collecting in the pleural cavity or blood accumulating in the mediastinum for patients with open chests in the intensive care unit. Despite the fact that using chest tube volume loss as a surrogate for postoperative bleeding could underestimate total blood loss, there are no reasons to believe that this difference would be unevenly distributed between experimental groups. Finally, previous surgical studies have also used chest tube volume loss as a surrogate for postoperative bleeding in pediatric patients undergoing open cardiac surgery. In conclusion, this study advocates the use of single donor RFWB to prime the bypass circuit, throughout CPB, and for transfusion requirements during the first 24 hours after surgery. This technique was associated with a significant reduction in chest tube volume loss for neonatal patients undergoing CPB for cardiac surgery. Furthermore, those patients who received RFWB had significantly better clinical outcomes, including decreased need for inotropic support, reduced ventilation time, and shorter hospital length of stay. In light of these data, adopting a modified practice of using platelets in the prime, fresher blood components, and limiting donor exposure could be highly beneficial.",
