PRRS virus (PRRSV) was identified as the etiological agent of the disease (Thiel et al. 1993) . PRRSV genome is a positive-strand RNA of approximately 15,000 nucleotides, comprising 8 open reading frames (ORFs). ORF1 is comprised of two large overlapping ORFs, ORF1a and ORF1b (Meulenberg et al. 1993; Thiel et al. 1993) . ORF1a is translated directly whereas ORF1b is translated by a ribosomal frame shift, yielding a large ORF1ab polyprotein that is cleaved by virus-encoded proteinases into products related to the virus transcription and replication (Allende et al. 1999) . After the autocatalytic release of nonstructural protein 1a (Nsp1a), Nsp1b and Nsp2, the remainder of the ORF1ab polyprotein is cleaved into at least 10 nonstructural proteins (Nsp3-12) by Nsp4 (Ziebuhr et al. 2000) . PRRSV Nsp4 belongs to the 3C-like serine proteinases (3CLSP), or 3C-like proteinase (3CLpro). The predicted catalytic triad of PRRSV 3CLpro Ao-Tian Xu and Yan-Jun Zhou contributed equally to this study.",

Although the substrate contained the sequence recognized by wild-type 3CLpro, it was not cleaved by the mutant proteinase (Fig. 4 , lane 1), demonstrating that the proteolytic activity was mediated by PRRSV 3CLpro. Moreover, the Ser 118 to Tyr mutation caused a complete loss of Fig. 1 Schematic representation of the PRRSV genome and construction of expression plasmids. ORF1a and 1b polyproteins are predicted to be cleaved into Nsp1a, Nsp1b and Nsp2 through Nsp12. The plasmid pT7HisPro was designed to encode PRRSV 3CLpro. The plasmid pET32a-Nsp3 0 4 was designed to cover the last 8 residues of Nsp3 and the whole sequence of Nsp4   Fig. 2 Effect of temperature on proteinase activity. The enzyme (5 lM) and substrate (5 lM) were incubated in 50 mM Tris/HCl (pH 7.0) buffer containing 100 mM NaCl for 24 h at the indicated temperatures cleavage activity, confirming the importance of Ser 118 residue as a functional element. In addition, no cleavage activity was observed in other two control reactions without either the substrate or the enzyme (Fig. 4, lane 2, 3) .",

In contrast with this finding in PRRSV, high concentrations of Na ? strongly inhibited the proteolytic activity of 3CLpros of the Chiba strain of Norovirus and equine arteritis virus (Someya et al. 2005; van Aken et al. 2006) . K ? (500 mM) did not inhibit proteolytic activity either (data not shown). Neither did Mn 2? , Mg 2? or Ca 2? at 5 mM (102, 95, and 103%, respectively), suggesting that PRRSV 3CLpro might be located or work in a confined environment inside infected cells rather than spreading throughout the whole cells. Further study is necessary to elucidate where and how PRRSV 3CLpro works in infected cells. Cu 2? and Zn 2? at 5 mM decreased the proteolytic activity to 62 or 50% (Fig. 5b) . Cu 2? and Zn 2? inhibit several viral proteinases, such as 3CLpros of severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus and norovirus (Hsu et al. 2004; Someya et al. 2005) . These results may facilitate designing anti-PRRSV drugs that contain metal ion-conjugated compounds, which have been used in 3CL protease inhibitors for SARS-CoV (Hsu et al. 2004 ).",

The proteolytic activities of these mutant proteins were measured in the trans-cleavage assay described above. As expected, all the substitutions of amino acids His 39 , Asp 64 and Ser 118 abolished the proteolytic activity (Fig. 7) . In a previous study, substitution of the predicted nucleophilic Ser 118 with Ala in PRRSV 3CLpro produced an inactive enzyme (Tian et al. 2009 ). The X-ray crystal structure of PRRSV 3CLpro revealed that the protein folded into two b-barrel structures (domains I and II), typical of the Fig. 5 Effect of NaCl concentrations (a) and divalent cations (b) on proteinase activity. The effect of metal ions was examined by preincubating the enzyme with the compound of interest for 2 h at 8\u00b0C.
