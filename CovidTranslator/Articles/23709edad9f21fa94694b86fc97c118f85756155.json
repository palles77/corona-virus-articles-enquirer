The pregnant sows were immunized once (42-49 days before farrowing) or twice (42-49 and 7-15 days before farrowing) by the oral, intramuscular or conjunctival route with the 188-SG strain. Sows exposed to virulent TGEV in the field and experimentally infected sows (two oral inoculations during pregnancy) were used as positive controls leading to high protection. The neutralizing antibody response to vaccination and/or infection was studied in serum and milk. No protection against mortality was observed in the litters of ( 1 ) the nine seronegative, susceptible sows, with piglet mortality of 65/70, (2) the seven once orally vaccinated sows, with mortality of 44/54, (3) the seven sows vaccinated twice by the conjunctival route, with mortality of 55/76. Moderate protection was observed in ( 1 ) the eight sows vaccinated intramuscularly twice with piglet mortality of 36 / 90, ( 2 ) the seven orally and intramuscularly vaccinated sows with piglet mortality of 31 / 51. In contrast, improved protection was observed in ( 1 ) the 10 sows vaccinated twice orally, with piglet mortality of 23/95, (2) the four naturally infected sows with piglet mortality of 6/41, (3) the six sows experimentally infected with virulent TGEV with piglet mortality of 1/59. No correlation was found between neutralizing antibodies titers in serum and milk and protection rate of the piglets. The results indicate that relative protective lactogenic immunity against TGEV is induced only by repeated ingestion of the attenuated 188-SG strain of TGEV.",

            "text": "Transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE) of swine is a highly contagious enteric viral disease of pigs under 2 weeks of age. It is well established that sows which have recovered from TGE are able to transmit protective immunity to their suckling pigs (Hooper and Halterman, 1966; Bohl et al., 1972) . Neutralization of TGE virus (TGEV) in the lumen of the gut of the newborn by antibodies continuously supplied by colostrum and milk of immune sows is believed to provide passive protection to suckling piglets. Numerous TGEV vaccines have been evaluated but their efficacy is questioned (Henning and Thomas, 1981; Bohl et al., 1982; Bohl, 1982; Moxley and Olson, 1989) . These attenuated TGEV live vaccines fail to initiate the gut and mammary gland immune response essential for providing optimal immunity (Salmon, 1987 ) . The low stability of cell culture adapted TGEV strains in gastric and gut juices (Laude et al., 1981; Aynaud and Bottreau, 1984) , which may destroy the virus during transit through the gut, is probably responsible for failures of oral vaccination. Using a survivor selection process in gastric juice, we have selected an attenuated mutant of TGEV which survives in the physico-chemical environment of the digestive tract of adult pigs (Aynaud et al., 1985) . Preliminary experiments carried out with a limited number of sows had indicated that this new TGEV mutant was capable of inducing a protective lactogenic immunity and that could be considered as a candidate for an oral TGEV vaccine (Aynaud et al., 1985) . The purpose in the present work was to study the lactogenic immunity afforded to suckling piglets on 40 sows immunized with this new mutant using oral, intramuscular and conjunctival routes. Passive protection was assayed by exposure of piglets to a standard challenge dose of fully virulent TGEV and antibody response was evaluated by titration of neutralizing activity in serum and milk collected from immunized sows at the time of challenge exposure.",

With the Miller strain, the age of piglets at challenge was noted by Moxley and Olson (1989) as a factor influencing the mortality rate. In our experimental conditions, a statistical analysis carried out on the 59 litters challenged with the highly virulent Gep-II strain, demonstrated no significant relationship between age of piglets at challenge and mortality rate (correlation coefficient r2= 0.005, P> 20%).",

            "text": "We compared the ability of the 188-SG strain given by different routes, to induce lactogenic protection. There is considerable variation among groups of vaccinated sows in regard to the mortality rate of piglets, 81% (oral route ) to 24% (oral/oral route). It is evident that booster immunization is essential to induce high protection. The oral route for priming and for boostering also influenced the induction of a high protection rate (76%) against mortality similar to that observed among naturally infected sows (75%). This observation indicated that repeated oral administration of vaccine influences the development of TGEV protective immunity. Absence of detectable humoral immune response after oral vaccination with ultraviolet treated virus suggests also that repeated antigenic stimulations of the gut with an appropriate replicating antigen is needed for optimal induction of passive protection. The heterogeneous immune response among the eight sows vaccinated and boosted by the intramuscular route (four litters well protected and four fully susceptible ) was similar to the observations reported by Bohl and Saif ( 1975 ) after intramuscular injection of pregnant sows with virulent TGEV. As postulated by these authors, passive protection is strongly dependent on whether the sow gut was infected by a haematogenous spread of virus. The possibility that infected macrophages (Laude et al., 1984) spread the vaccinal virus to the gut or mammary gland after intramuscular administration has been suggested. Arguing the concept of a common mucosal immune system, we postulated that conjunctival route (Montgomery et al., 1983) , which has been used successfully against various pathogens (Fensterbank et al., 1985; Tannock et al., 1985; Kramer et al., 1987) , would be an alternative approach to oral immunization. Unfortunately it was inefficient in our experiments in terms of protection although all vaccinated sows exhibited serum and milk neutralizing antibodies after conjunctival vaccination. The reason of this lack of success is unknown but it probably suggests that the conjunctival route is not able to induce local antigenic stimulation of gut.",

However, after challenge exposure 95% of vaccinated sows showed an anamnestic antibody response, generally higher when the degree of protection of the litter was low. In contrast, all naturally or experimentally infected sows failed to show such anamnestic response. We suggest that the lack of anamnestic response observed in sows after challenge exposure of piglets could be considered as an a posteriori index of protective lactogenic immunity. These present results confirmed our previous preliminary observations (Aynaud et al., 1985; Shira'i et al., 1988) . Furthermore, when sensitive immunochemical approaches (ELISA, immunoadsorbent) were used, IgA antibody was detected at time of challenge in the milk of experimentally infected sows and also in milk of orally vaccinated and boostered sows . But in contrast to infected sows, the IgA antibody level was never predominant in the milk of vaccinated sows, suggesting that mechanisms involved in TGE lactogenic immunity induced by attenuated 188-SG strain could be different from those for virulent TGEV strain (Bohl et al., 1972) .",

The exact mechanism leading to induction of protective immunity following immunization with the 188-SG strain is still unknown. 188-SG strain is characterized by different in vitro properties (resistance to acidity and proteases, higher content of structural antigens, delay in viral multiplication) (Aynaud et al., 1985; Nguyen et al., 1987a) which can have possible repercussions on conditions of virus multiplication and also presentation of viral antigens at the surface of infected enterocytes. The amount of appropriate antigen produced by gut epithelial cells and processed by antigen presenting cells would perhaps be a crucial factor mainly involved in induction of optimal local immune response and the development of TGEV lactogenic immunity. Better knowledge in this field and analysis of milk immune factors connected with protection is without doubt the key of any improvement in TGEV immunization, whatever the type of vaccine.",
