            "text": ". On the other hand, the use of indicator molecules that interact differentially with singleor double-stranded DNA has been widely exploited in indirect approaches. Bioconjugation is commonly not required because electrostatic or hydrophobic interactions take place easily. A different possibility for indirect detection is the use of enzymes, alternative that enhances assay sensitivity enormously because of their inherent amplification. Although enzymes can be directly conjugated to DNA strands, the use of a well-known affinity interaction such as avidinebiotin is an easy alternative. Horseradish peroxidase has been widely used as enzyme label as well as glucose oxidase and alkaline phosphatase (AP). AP (EC 3.1.3.1) is a hydrolase that converts orthophosphoric monoesters into alcohols and thus various phosphate esters can act as substrates. As the name suggests, they are more effective in alkaline media. 3-Indoxyl phosphate (3-IP) has been proposed as an adequate substrate for AP in immunoelectrochemical approaches [6] . Because of its satisfactory electrochemical behavior (see Chapters 5, 30 , and 31), it has been used for the development of AP-based enzyme immunoassays. In this experiment, AP is used to detect DNA hybridization events on gold electrodes.",

Reducing the cell volume has several advantages, the first being the decrease in the diffusion distances required for analytes to reach their surface-bound receptor partners. A simple, cheap, and easy-to-handle homemade device is presented allowing the performance of the hybridization procedure and sequential detection. Square wave voltammetry (SWV) (see Chapters 3 and 24) is employed for measuring in a fast and sensitive way. This experiment is adapted from Ref. [7] . The sequence chosen as target for the development of this genosensor corresponds to a gene that encodes the nucleocapsid protein (422 amino acids) of the SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) virus, specifically a short lysine-rich region that appears to be unique to SARS and suggestive of a nuclear localization signal [8] .
