            "text": "V iral infections of the bovine respiratory tract represent significant pathogens. These infections are manifested by various clinical signs and lesions in bovine respiratory disease (BRD) with varying morbidity; mortality; loss of production (treatment costs, reduced weight gain, and carcass value); and lowered economic return to the producer. The principal viruses in BRD have historically and by emphasis on vaccination centered on bovine herpesvirus-1 (also referred to as infectious bovine rhinotracheitis virus [IBRV] , parainfluenza-3 virus (PI-3V), bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV), and bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV). [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] Also, bovine adenovirus (BAV) and, more recently, bovine coronaviruses (BCV) have been included. 6, [13] [14] [15] Viruses in BRD may cause primary infection with disease, either singly or in combination with other viruses. A significant role for viruses in BRD is their interaction with bacteria and Mycoplasma spp. in bacterial pneumonias. [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] These severe bacterial pneumonias are caused by Mannheimia haemolytica, Pasteurella multocida, and Histophilus somni. Mycoplasma bovis represents another agent observed in these severe bacterial pneumonias often initiated by primary viral infections.",

Young calves are especially susceptible to viral infections because their maternally derived immunity from colostrum is reduced with age. 16 Calves held under stressful conditions such as markets, commingling during marketing and shipment, inadequate nutrition, overcrowding, and severe climatic changes are more prone to BRD. Often calves fresh from closed herds of the ranch operation are highly susceptible as they enter the marketing channels and are commingled with other calves, facilitating the spread of the viruses. Viruses are shed primarily in respiratory secretions of the nose, eyes, and sometimes feces. Direct or close contact with animals' infectious secretions are major modes of transmission.

The disease is most common in cattle over 6 months of age. 1 The BHV-1 also survives in cattle recovering from primary infections with latency as a hallmark of the BHV-1 ecology. 1, 19 The latent virus may be found in trigeminal and sacral ganglia with recrudescence later by stress or administration of corticosteroids. 1, 19 After recrudescence/reactivation, the virus may be detected in nasal secretions with potential spread to contacts. Interestingly there may be an effective primary immune response acquired after natural infection or vaccination to control reexcretion (shedding). 19 A secondary immune response boosted by reactivation may also inhibit reexcretion. 19 Animals with high antibody BHV-1 titers (neutralizing) before reactivation did not reexcrete virus after reactivation treatment. 22 Cattle receiving MlV BHV-1 vaccines may also have latent infections with the vaccinal strains. 1, 19 The host immunity to BHV-1 has been extensively studied with both T cells (cell-mediated immunity [CMI]) and B cells (humoral/antibodies) important in recovery and prevention on reexposure. 1, 19 Clinical Forms",

Intranuclear inclusions and focal areas of necrosis in the liver and adrenals are seen in BHV-1 abortions. The virus may be isolated from the placenta, fetal liver, and adrenals. Recently the use of contemporary BHV-1 reagents such as monoclonal antibody and IHC has enhanced BHV-1 abortion diagnosis. Serology using acute serum at time of abortion and a convalescent sample 3 to 4 weeks later in the aborting cow is unrewarding because the initial infection of the dam may have occurred as much as 100 days earlier, and thus she may already have seroconverted.

The passive BHV-1 immunity via BHV Ig had a reduction on the efficacy of the MlV BHV-1. 29 The passively administered BHV-1 antibodies protected against viral shedding in viral-challenged calves. 29 The MlV parenteral vaccines were the initially licensed for use in cattle for protection against BHV-1. 30 Vaccines are attenuated by multiple passages in cell culture and/ or in heterologous species' cell cultures and often retain their ability to replicate in a susceptible animal, possibly causing a viremia. MlV parenteral vaccines are relatively inexpensive, offer a convenient route of administration, and stimulate a rapid onset of immunity (i.e., within 3 days of administration). [31] [32] [33] In general, one dose given to a susceptible animal stimulates protective immunity, which varies in duration depending on the clinical form of the disease challenge. Calves receiving a combination MlV vaccine including BHV-1 were protected for at least 126 days after vaccination as measured by protection against infection. 34 The MlV parenteral vaccines may cross the placenta and infect the fetus, causing abortion. 35 Most MlV BHV-1 parenteral vaccines are not approved for use in pregnant heifers/cows or nursing calves. 27 Recently companies have received label claims for BHV-1 and BVDV MlV vaccine use in pregnant cows providing they vaccinated with that line of vaccines within 12 months and to nursing calves provided their dams were vaccinated within 12 months. 27 MlV intranasal vaccines generally can be divided into two types, based on the attenuation process: (1) those modified by passage in a cell culture 36, 37 and (2) those modified by treatment such that they become \"temperature sensitive\" 38 (i.e., they do not replicate at internal body temperature). MlV intranasal vaccines stimulate protection in susceptible animals with only one dose, in contrast to the chemically altered MlV parenteral vaccines. The label directions for selected, but not all, MlV intranasal vaccines may indicate that they can be safely used in pregnant cattle. 27 These vaccines induce a rapid onset of protection (within 3 days of administration), possibly through interferon production and release into nasal secretions. 36 One benefit of MlV intranasal vaccines is that they stimulate immunity to mucosal surfaces of the upper respiratory tract, the portal of entry of the virus. Another benefit is their potential to immunize calves that are already seropositive because of maternal (humoral) antibodies passively transferred through the colostrum. 39 Animals vaccinated with the MlV intranasal vaccines may transiently shed virus in the nasal secretions and therefore might infect susceptible contact animals. 40 The chemically altered BHV-1 vaccine strain for parenteral use was modified by nitrous acid treatment, which caused changes in the viral genome resulting in a strain (temperature sensitive) that is unable to replicate at normal internal body temperature. 41 Presumably, because of the limited viral replication, the vaccine requires two doses to stimulate immunity. Because it is temperature sensitive and should not replicate in the host, the vaccine can be used in pregnant cattle. 27, 41, 42 In one study heifers received two doses of the vaccine and were challenged with BHV-1 7 months later (at 6 months' gestation). These heifers showed a significant reduction in the number of abortions and stillbirths compared with controls. 42 Inactivated viral vaccines are prepared by growing virus in cell cultures and then inactivating them with chemicals. An adjuvant is added to the inactivated strain to help stimulate an immune response. Inactivated BHV-1 vaccines require two doses (14-28 days apart) when used for the initial vaccination of susceptible cattle. Historically it has been thought that inactivated vaccines against viruses did not induce as long a duration of immunity as the MlV vaccines, nor did they confer protection against mucosal infections. Controlled studies are required to determine the duration of immunity induced by inactivated BHV-1 vaccines and MlV vaccines, both for respiratory disease and fetal infections. Disadvantages of inactivated vaccines are that the onset of protection may not be as rapid as with MlV parenteral or MlV intranasal vaccines and two doses are required. An advantage of the inactivated vaccines is that they can be used in pregnant cows and nursing calves.",

Recent studies, however, have shown that calves given an MlV parenteral vaccine did not shed virus in their nasal secretions nor did contact animals become infected with the vaccine virus. [46] [47] [48] Multiple companies have received label claims for MlV vaccines containing BHV-1 and BVDV for pregnant cows provided the cows had received the same line of vaccines with the MlV BHV-1 and BVDV within 12 months and/or before breeding. likewise, these vaccines could be used in nursing calves if cows previously vaccinated with that line of vaccines according to the label. Veterinarians and producers should follow explicitly the label precautions for the respective vaccine. Another concern is that the MlV vaccine virus may recrudesce, with resulting shedding of virus in cattle either stressed or receiving corticosteroids. 49 Realistically, concern about transmission of BHV-1 to animals in contact with those receiving MlV parenteral vaccines would be negligible if the contact animals were properly immunized and immune to BHV-1.",

Also, the challenge may be for only one form of disease, usually the respiratory type. Such challenges may detect only protection against a severe form of the respiratory disease. BHV-1 manifests itself in other forms such as abortions, neonatal disease, genital disease (male and female), and conjunctivitis. Yet little or no data are available about the efficacy of vaccines against these other forms of disease. For example, in one case the genital form of BHV-1 disease (infectious pustular vulvovaginitis) occurred in heifers that had received an MlV parenteral vaccine 5 months earlier. 52 Given the lack of duration of immunity studies for all BHV-1 vaccines individually and the cost of vaccines, breeding animals are usually vaccinated at least annually. In some feedyard situations the animals may be revaccinated during the feeding period. It is industry practice that feedlot cattle receive a monovalent BHV-1 MlV parenteral vaccine at reimplant time at approximately 100 days after arrival.

These advances are especially noted for herpesviruses including BHV-1. In addition to conventional vaccines manufactured via propagation of MlV and inactivated BHV-1 strains, current and future technologies offer opportunities for other vaccines. 53, 54 These include subunit vaccines with a portion of the virus, deletion mutants with specific viral genomic fragments deleted, live vectored strains, DnA vaccines using plasmids, and plant-based vaccines. Deletion mutant BHV-1 vaccines as marker vaccines with selected glycoprotein genes deleted along with diagnostic tests for the deleted genes permit identification of vaccinates under control programs. 53 Recently needle-free delivery of vaccines has been developed and implemented. 53 By highpressure gas delivery, vaccines may penetrate the skin and be administered intradermally, subcutaneously, or intramuscularly. 53 Such delivery is designed to minimize damage resulting from intramuscular injections. Two studies compared needle-free intramuscular injection of multivalent MlV vaccine containing BHV-1 with conventional subcutaneous injection via syringe in dairy calves and feedlot cattle. In both studies antibody titers to BHV-1 were higher at day 21 postvaccination than conventional needle injection. 55, 56 The best possible vaccine provides protective immunity in the host against infection (viral replication) when challenged, protects the animal against all forms of disease including multiple organ and systemic forms, and provides lifelong mucosal and systemic immunity. Ideally the vaccine recommendations would incorporate the results of field trials that are carefully designed to show the efficacy of the vaccine against a pathogen. unfortunately little information is available, as can be seen by a review of the literature, for evaluating the field efficacy of the respiratory disease vaccines. 57 The summary of results was mixed for BHV-1 vaccines and for other respiratory viral and bacterial vaccines.",

            "text": "The four viral structural proteins are the capsid protein (C) and three glycoproteins of the envelope (Erns [ribonuclease], E1, and E2) at the 5' region of the viral genome ( Fig. 42-1) . These three glycoproteins (GP) are involved with the induction of neutralizing antibodies. The E2 (GP53) glycoprotein is considered the principal epitope for viral neutralizing antibodies. The nonstructural proteins (nS) are toward the 3' region of genome. The biotypes of BVDV are based on presence or absence of cytopathology in cell cultures, cytopathic (CP) or noncytopathic (nCP). 3,70-73 The nCP strains encode for an intact nS2-3 protein; however, the CP strains have the nS2-3 cleaved into separate nS2 and nS3 proteins. This is a molecular event separating the CP and nCP biotypes. Although not part of the assembled virion, the individual nS proteins may have functions including protease and polymerase activity. Genomic variabilities encode for these proteins, and there is diversity noted by monoclonal binding studies. 77 The BVDVs are a diverse group, both by antigenic and genomic properties. [78] [79] [80] [81] [82] [83] [84] until recently in the united States, BVDVs were divided into two major genotypes, BVDV1 and BVDV2. In the united States there are three major subtypes: BVDV1a, 1b, and 2a. One isolate of BVDV2b in the united States has been reported from a feedlot case of fatal pneumonia. 11 Reports indicate that there are 11 subgenotypes of BVDV1. 85 The phylogenetic analysis of BVDV can be performed by analyzing genomic sequences of five different regions: 5'-uTR, npro, E2, nS3, and nS5B-3'uTR. 86 Based on homology using a 5'-uTR region, there was 67.1% homology between BVDV1 (including BVDV1a and BVDV1b) and BVDV2a strains. 81 And there was 85.3% homology between BVDV1a and BVDV1b strains. 81 BVDVs cause important and commonplace infections in domestic cattle worldwide. 3 In addition, other susceptible domestic species include sheep (also susceptible to the related border disease virus), goats, pigs, and a wide range of wild ruminants, as well as camelidae and cervidae species. 3 The most important reservoirs of the virus are the PI cattle. PI cattle are the result of susceptible pregnant cattle becoming infected between 42 and 125 days of gestation. 87 The infected fetuses are carried to term, born infected and immunotolerant to the BVDV strain causing the infection. The calves are lifelong shedders of the virus in all body excretions/secretions including feces. Animals with acute, transient infections shed virus at far smaller amounts and for a shorter time than PI cattle. 3 The distribution of the BVDV subtypes in the united States has been reported in two groups of livestock: BVDV isolates from cases submitted to diagnostic laboratories and from PI cattle in various management schemes. The prevalence of BVDV biotypes and subtypes was determined in BVDV-positive samples from diagnostic laboratory accessions. 88 The results were 89.3% nCP strains, 8.4% CP strains, and 2.3% in which both CP and nCP were isolated. The distribution of the BVDV subtypes was 45.8% BVDV1b, 28.2% BVDV1a, and 26% BVDV2a. In a survey of northwestern u.S. diagnostic laboratory accessions, there were 18.5% BVDV1a, 40.7% BVDV1b, and 40.7% BVDV2. 89 A survey of BVDV-positive samples from bulk milk and infected cattle indicated 49.1% BVDV1b, 11.3% BVDV1a, and 39.3% BVDV2a. 90 Thus it appears that in the united States, BVDV1b is the predominant subtype in diagnostic laboratory cases.",

In PI animals, BVDV is present in the serous secretory and ductular epithelium from the nasal mucosa to the lung, along with infected respiratory tract leukocytes. 94 The potential for iatrogenic mechanical transmission via infected veterinary instruments and rectal palpation was also suggested as a possible role for biting insects. 3 In reality, the large amount of virus continually shed by PI cattle is considered the most important source of BVDV. 3, 93, 95 The BVDV may also be transmitted via infected semen or embryo transfer. 3 An important reason for monitoring the safety and purity of MlV bovine vaccines is that nCP strains, accidentally introduced into vaccines, have induced BVDV disease in susceptible vaccinates. The movement of BVDV in viremic heifers/cows to the developing fetus/oocyte or to the uterus can result in disruption of the fertilized oocyte's implantations in addition to causing developmental defects or PI individuals.",

Infection with a CP strain may occur via exposure to CP strains circulating in cattle, but it most likely occurs when the nCP PI strain mutates to form the related CP strain. 70 The disease is characterized by severe digestive tract disease with ulcers and erosions throughout the tract, skin lesions, and hoof lesions (interdigital). The disease is uniformly fatal. Concern was that MlV BVDV vaccination may have contributed to MD. However, with such a low PI rate (<1% of cattle entering the feedlot) and almost all cattle at the feedlot receiving the MlV BVDV vaccines, there is an extremely low incidence of MD to support that connection to BVDV vaccine. Also, one study demonstrated that vaccination of PI calves with different MlV vaccines did not induce MD. 108",

In addition to BVDV, other viral agents could be isolated as well from the nasal swabs. Selected organ tissues collected at necropsy can be used as inoculum for viral isolation. Most BVDV are nCP: thus agent identification in positive cell culture cases is confirmed for BVDV antigen by fluorescent antibody tests, ElISA, or immunoperoxidase staining. neutralization tests with monospecific BVDV antisera or monoclonal antibody are sometimes used. likewise, CP agents are confirmed by these same tests.",

Selected diagnostic laboratories may request a second sample for IHC after the first positive IHC test. However, in at least three studies one positive IHC from fixed notches was suitable criteria for PI status. 92, 93, 126 This approach was confirmed when acutely infected animals were tested by the IHC and found to be IHC negative. 104 The use of the ACE test detecting BVDV antigen in the fluids of the fresh notches is available now in state diagnostic and commercial laboratories. Recently, a variety of tests were evaluated in PI cattle entering a feedlot. 93 Positive ACE samples were detected in PI calves when compared with concurrent samples for IHC. 93 A limited number of low ACE positives (<5%) were IHC negative. Such low ACE positives should be retested. The ACE test for BVDV was negative in fresh notches in all acutely infected animals. 104 Thus a negative ACE test is expected for acutely infected cattle. In another study of five diagnostic methods for BVDV, only PI calves were positive in skin samples by IHC and ACE test. 127 In some studies pooling of samples and screening either by ACE in fresh notches or RT-PCR will detect a positive in a pool of several samples. [128] [129] [130] The positive pool members were then tested individually by the ACE test to identify the individual positive animals. 129, 130 The number of individual samples present in the pooled samples with positive PCR assay results ranged from 50 to 100. 130 Screening cattle using pooled samples is an attempt to reduce the cost of testing. The sensitivity of the ACE test using pooled saline from two notches was less than 100%. 128 Increasing the pool size for the ACE test will decrease the sensitivity. 128 likewise, another study reported that pooling with 10 samples, 1 positive and 9 negative (1:10), could result in failure to detect 10% of the PI samples and pooling of 100 samples could result in 50% failure to detect a positive. 131 Veterinarians electing to test for PI cattle should consult their diagnostic laboratory for the tests being offered. Most state diagnostic laboratories offer both the IHC and ACE on notches. Most laboratories adhere strictly to the u.S.

Worldwide there have been attempts to use other technologies for BVD vaccine including viral subunit, DnA vaccines, and, more recently, an equine herpesvirus vector expressing BVDV structural proteins. 132, 133 Cattle respond to the MlV and KV by development of a humoral (B-cell) response with neutralizing antibodies. 12, 80, 104, 134 Passively acquired antibodies from BVDV antibody-positive dams have been shown to provide protection. 135, 136 Also, calves fed colostrums from vaccinated dams were protected against BVDV disease. 137 In addition, high maternal antibody concentrations blocked a protective response to MlV BVDV1a vaccine. 138 Vaccination with MlV BVDV vaccine will also induce activated T-cell subsets after vaccination. 139 Cattle can also have an activated T-cell system in situations where the calves have maternal antibodies to BVDV. 140 The total protection against BVDV is not likely limited to either T-cell or B-cell function. One must consider, however, the potential for maternal antibodies to inhibit the active immune response following vaccination. With the half-life of approximately 23 days, the date the calf responds to vaccination will depend on the quality and quantity of antibodies absorbed. One study indicated some calves could retain colostral antibodies up to 299 days based on half-life calculations, 16 whereas other calves maintained antibody levels for a much shorter time (mean of 192 days).",

BHV-1 and BVDV vaccines are often given to adult breeding beef herds at pregnancy check. This is a management decision, not related to the pathogenesis of BVDV or BHV-1. Vaccinations at pregnancy check for BHV-1 and BVDV have little or no benefit for the fetus, and in some cases, if the dam is susceptible, the fetus may become infected. Ideally vaccination should occur before breeding to maximize protection against fetal infection. uSDA-licensed vaccines, both MlV and killed, are used before breeding. 27 For the MlV, it is generally recommended that the vaccines be given 30 to 60 days before breeding or exposure to bulls in natural breeding operations. Certain MlV virus vaccines can be used safely in pregnant cows and are labeled as such. 27 Generally, these vaccines require vaccination prebreeding and/or within a time frame such as the preceding 12 months. Caution must be given to each vaccine label's inserts for those requirements. The same requirements apply to the vaccination of nursing calves. Some MlV vaccines are approved for nursing calves, but label restrictions should be followed, especially as they relate to the vaccination status of the dam. ",

Two doses are given in that maternal antibodies may persist blocking the first dose 16 or, in some cases, a seronegative calf will not respond to vaccination and does respond after a second dose. 155 The initial dose could be given before weaning such as at branding. Other cattle operations may wait until weaning for the first dose and give the second dose 3 to 4 weeks later. Industry practices in beef are moving toward MlV vaccines, although some veterinarians and producers elect to use KV vaccines. One approach is to use KV for the first dose followed by MlV. 156",

The PI animal is the central figure as the principal reservoir exposing susceptible cattle. BVDV disease and its impact on cattle are evident in many management situations, from breeding herd to the stocker and feedlot operations. The emphasis should be to recognize that the BVDV PI begins with infection in the breeding herd. Controlling BVDV fetal infections will reduce and, ideally, eliminate the PI animal. The detection and removal of the PI animal is the goal of BVDV control along with biosecurity and effective vaccination. With the diagnostic tests available to detect PI cattle, BVDV impact on cattle production can be greatly diminished with the removal of these individuals.",
