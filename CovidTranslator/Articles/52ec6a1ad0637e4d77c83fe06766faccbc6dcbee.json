Therefore, we used two indexes to represent the level of healthcare: Health Care Index (HCI), 9 and Healthcare Access and Quality Index (HAQI). 10 HCI is based on surveys from visitors of one open website and questions for these surveys are similar to many similar scientific and government surveys. 9 HAQI uses 32 scaled cause values, providing an overall score of 0-100 of personal health-care access and quality by location over time. 10 Firstly, we found that mortality rate, incidence, and death per 1000,000 people were correlated with DCI (Spearman's rank-order correlation, all p < 0.05) ( Figure 4A ), and this association was more prominent in countries with local transmission ( Table 2 ). This finding is consistent with Ji et al.'s findings 7 and suggests that rapidly increasing cases in a short time can result in more cases and even more deaths.
