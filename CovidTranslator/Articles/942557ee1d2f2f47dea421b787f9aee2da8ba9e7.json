            "text": "Total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are important pollutants that affect public health in urban areas, especially in developing and oil-rich countries such as Iran. This assesses the relationship between TPH and PAHs in street dust and suspended dust, and investigates toxicity level in the urban environment of the most important petrochemical center in Iran. For this purpose, 21 and 48 street dust samples were collected for TPH analysis and PAH analysis, respectively, in Asaluyeh County. Moreover, seven air dust samples were taken for PAH analysis. TPH concentrations ranged between 240 and 4400 mg kg \u22121 , with a mean of 1371.43 mg kg \u22121 . The maximum \u2211PAH concentration (6016.3 mg kg \u22121 ) was detected in a petrochemical complex while the minimum \u2211PAHs content (16.93 mg kg \u22121 ) was measured in an urban area. The mean concentrations of total PAHs in street dust particles were 491.35 mg kg \u22121 in summer and 304.04 mg kg \u22121 in winter. The results indicated that PAH concentration in summer was higher. PAH sources were identified using both PAHs ratios and robust statistical methods such as Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE), backward GEE, logistic regression, principal components analysis (PCA) in conjunction with multiple linear regression (MLR) and positive matrix factorization (PMF). The results showed that PAH species generally originate from pyrogenic sources and about 0.08% of TPH was typically PAHs. However, petrogenic sources of PAHs in the industrial areas were 11.2 times more abundant than in urban areas. Also, backward GEE model demonstrated that TPH is more influenced by HMW PAHs, particularly indene. Estimated incremental lifetime cancer risk (ILCR) was higher than 10 -4 , showing that Asaluyeh inhabitants (especially children and indoor workers) are probably exposed to cancer risk, particularly through dermal contact and dust ingestion.",

            "text": "Urban design and geographic location are two important factors in amplifying effects of environmental contaminants. Over the last few decades, several studies were carried out to link urban quality with urban design. For instance, Nikolopulou et al. (2004) investigated microclimate in multiple open urban spaces. Based on air ventilation assessment, the development of urban planning guidelines was considered by Ng (2009) . Oke (1988) also investigated optimum street canyon characteristics according to diverse climate-related criteria in urban regions and demonstrated a number of useful relationships between the geometry and the microclimate of urban street canyons. Previous studies are potentially helpful in establishing guidelines governing street dimensions to be used by urban designers. On the other hand, rapid urbanization, population growth and consequent accumulation of contaminants pose major challenges for people and planners. For more explanation, in 2003, Hong Kong was hit by severe acute respiratory syndrome, which led to numerous fatalities. Thus, a number of focused studies were conducted with a recommendation being utilization of air ventilation systems (Ng, 2009) .",

The county is limited to the Persian Gulf in the south and a mountain range in the north (Abbasi, Keshavarzi, Moore, & Mahmoudi, 2018; Abbasi, Keshavarzi, Moore, Turner et al., 2019) . The northern barrier prevents the southwest-northeast wind current to disperse the pollution load and hence resulting in increasing the air pollution potential. Thus, it is important to select appropriate methods to investigate contaminants and their effects on human health. Accelerated urban and industrial development and a huge petrochemical complex are already reported to be responsible for the high level of pollutants in Asaluyeh port (Alahverdi & Savabieasfahani, 2012) .",

However, there are risks for shallow aquifers, which may be used for private wells for drinking water purposes (Amadi, Abbey, & Nma, 1996; Albers, 1995; Todd et al., 1999) . Also, different TPH compounds may be separated from the original mixture (depending on the chemical properties), evaporated, dissolved into the groundwater or attached to soil particles. Hence, human can be exposed to these compounds through respiration, ingestion and dermal pathways (Todd et al., 1999) . TPH provides an estimate of the concentration of higher molecular weight hydrocarbons, while PAHs provide an estimate of more toxic oil components (Wade et al., 2011) .",

The primary function of PCA was a reduction in the number of variables while retaining as much as possible of the original information; therefore, variables with similar characteristics were grouped into factors (Fang et al., 2004) . When PCA was performed with Varimax normalized rotation, each principal component score contained information on all PAHs combined into a single number, while the loadings indicated the relative contribution for PAHs species made to that score (Kong et al., 2012; Yongming, Peixuan, Junji, & Posmentier, 2006) .",

Other advantages of PCA include: (i) Lack of redundancy of data given the orthogonal components; (ii) Reduced complexity in images' grouping with the use of PCA; (iii) Smaller database representation since only the trainee images are stored in the form of their projections on a reduced basis; (iv) Reduction of noise since the maximum variation basis is chosen and so the small variations in the background are ignored automatically (Phillips et al., 2005; Srinivasulu Asadi et al., 2010) ; (v) Results cannot be weighted to account for uncertainties in the measured data; (vi) PCA models cannot properly handle missing data or values below the detection limit (both of which commonly occur in environmental measurements); and (vii) MLR analysis of the factor scores was used to quantify source contributions to samples based on pollutants (Larsen & Baker, 2003; Ashayeri et al., 2018) . PCA's key disadvantages of PCA are: (i) The covariance matrix is difficult to be evaluated in an accurate manner (Phillips et al., 2005) ; (ii) Even the simplest invariance could not be captured by the PCA unless the training data explicitly provides this information (Li et al., 2008) ; and (iii) PCA is not as powerful as other statistical methods in small datasets (Karamizadeh et al., 2013) .",

Other advantages include: 1) The GEE algorithm has been incorporated into many major statistical software packages, including SAS, STATA, R, and S-PLUS, 2) the model is robust to the misspecification of correlation structure, because the parameter estimate remain consistent, 3) when the working correlation structure is correctly specified, the parameter estimates from GEE are efficient (Liang & Zeger, 1986; Khajeh-Kazemi et al., 2011) . GEE's limitations include: 1) in the case misspecification of the working correlation matrix the parameter estimates from GEE can be inefficient (Liang & Zeger, 1986) , 2) the consistency of the estimated parameter depends only on the correct specification of the mean model; but there is no universally accepted test for goodness-of-fit for mean model in GEE that extends beyond binary dependent variable (Barnhart & Williamson, 1998) , 3) GEE parameter estimates are sensitive to outliers or contaminated data and in that cases GEE fails to give consistent estimators and more seriously will lead to incorrect conclusion (Preisser & Qaqish, 1996 Qu & Song, 2004) , 4) In GEE due to lack of an objective function it is complicated to use model selection criterion (Pan, 2001) , 5) if the correlation parameters are not consistently estimated, GEE fails to produce consistent estimators (Crowder, 1986 (Crowder, , 1995 .",

The maximum, minimum and mean TPH are 4400, 240 and 1371.43 mg/kg, respectively. The high concentration of TPH is probably related to petroleum products, oil carrier trucks and automobiles. The TPH concentrations in refineries and petrochemical units are lower than those of the urban areas and far from the authors' expectation (Fig. S1 ). This can be the result of many factors such as washing the connecting roadways. Such roadways in refineries and petrochemical units (industrial areas) are regularly washed, and hence pollutants adsorbed to street dust are removed (Kennedy, 2003; Zhang, Dou et al., 2008) . Consequently, the concentration of pollutants in such places is lower than in regions where street dust remains on the street surface for a long time. According to Adeniyi and Afolabi (2002) , street dust pollution can be identified when TPH concentration is higher than 10-100 mg/kg, indicating that all collected samples in Asaluyeh are polluted. Hence, measuring TPH subunits such as PAHs seemed reasonable (Fig. S1 ).",

            "text": "sampling site in a petrochemical company), while minimum \u2211PAHs (16.93 \u03bcg/kg) occurred in P42 (a sampling site in an urban area). During summer and winter, the mean concentration of total PAHs in street dust particles was 491.35 and 304.04 \u03bcg/kg, respectively. In general, \u2211PAHs concentrations at petrochemical stations are higher compared to urban areas. Contrary to many previous studies that show a higher concentration of PAHs in winter, in the current study, total PAHs are higher in the summer (Fig. 2a) . As already mentioned during winter, meteorological conditions like shorter daylight periods, low temperature, low volatilization, lower atmospheric mixing height, reduced vertical dispersion due to thermal inversion, increased use of heaters, enhanced sorption to particles at lower temperature and low photochemical reactivity of PAHs would increase PAHs content during winter (Baalbaki et al., 2018; Gope, Masto, George, & Balachandran, 2018; Liu, Cheng, Ou et al., 2007; Periera-Netto, Krauss, Cunha, & Rego, 2006) . Nonetheless, this is not the case everywhere and depends on many other factors. For example, in the current study, heating devices are not frequently used and the weather is not that cold in winter. It was also found that PAHs concentration during monsoon season is lower than summer because the heavy washout and runoff can wash street dust and their adsorbed PAHs (Gope et al., 2018) . Therefore, rainfall and runoff can be important for washing street dust in the winter, rather than PAHs themselves. According to Nowak, Crane, Stevens, Hoehn, and Walton (2008) , precipitation helps wash away some surface contaminants, but PAHs are not readily washable. For example, \u0160krbi\u0107, \u0110uri\u0161i\u0107-Mladenovi\u0107, \u017divan\u010dev, and Tadi\u0107 (2019) reported similar results to those of the current study. The higher concentrations of PAHs in street dust sampled in summer might be attributed to the additional pollution sources in summer such as the emission from numerous motorcycles that are not driven during the cold months (\u0160krbi\u0107 et al., 2019) . It is worth mentioning that PAHs emission from motorcycles was about 10 to 16 times greater than those from vehicles equipped with catalyst and low emission automobiles (Pham, Kameda, Toriba, & Hayakawa, 2013) . In addition, natural gas and diesel fuel are used in Asaluyeh for generating electricity. Considering hot and humid weather in the summer, a sharp . Both petrochemical and other industrial areas indicated high average concentrations of low molecular weight (LMW) PAHs (2 and 3 rings), while only urban areas demonstrated remarkable mean content of high molecular weight (HMW) PAHs (4 rings and above). The main pollution source of PAHs is believed to be motor vehicles in urban areas of the current study. Generally, the LMW PAH species are produced by crude oil products at low to moderate temperatures, such as wood and coal combustion (Wang et al., 2011) , but the HMW compounds are generated, for instance, when fuel is burned in engines at high temperatures (Mastral & Callen, 2000) . Molecular weight of 4 rings PAHs lies between those of LMW and HMW PAHs and their characteristics are comparable to the properties of HMW and LMW PAHs (Table 1) . Therefore, they may occur both in industrial regions (with high potential for generating LMW PAHs) and in urban areas (with high potential for producing HMWPAHs).",

            "text": "On average, the percentage of PAHs with 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 rings are 1. 98, 30.90, 29.81, 33 .27 and 4.04%, respectively (Table 1 and Fig. 3) . The abundance of PAHs based on ring numbers in the street dust of Asaluyeh follows the order of 5 rings > 3 rings > 4 rings > 6 rings > 2 rings. The 5 ring compounds indicated that industrial and traffic pollutants are more abundant (Wilcke, Amelung, Martius, Garcia, & Zech, 2000). Obviously, PAH compounds with 2 and 3 rings have less molecular weight and hence are more volatile than PAHs with 4 to 6 rings Liu, Cheng, Ou et al., 2007) . Therefore, the greater concentration of PAH compounds with 2 and 3 rings at the mentioned stations indicates their recent release from pollution sources in the environment. High concentration of the 5 and 6 ring species probably reflects incomplete fuel combustion in industry and petroleum carrier trucks. These compounds have a strong tendency to deposit and bond to soil or dust particles (Khalili, Scheff, & Holsen, 1995) . Also, the mean of combustion PAHs (the sum of Flu, Pyr, BaA, Chr, B(b + k)F, and BaP (Rogge, Hildemann, Mazurek, Cass, & Simoneit, 1993; Rajput & Lakhani, 2009 )) to total PAHs in the street dust samples is 0.64 \u03bcg kg \u22121 and constitutes a significant proportion of the total PAHs concentration. According to International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), carcinogenic PAHs include Nap, BaA, Chr, BeP, BbF, BkF, BaP, DbahA, and Ind. The mean ratio of carcinogenic PAHs to total PAHs (CANPAHs/PAHs) is lower than the mean ratio of the non-carcinogenic PAHs to total PAHs (NCANPAHs/PAHs) indicating higher abundance of the non-carcinogenetic PAHs (Table 1) . Furthermore, considering Fig. 2c , the concentration of carcinogenic PAHs is higher than the value of non-carcinogenic PAHs, especially in regions with high traffic load. The carcinogenic PAHs concentration is also higher in summer (Fig. 2c) . Fig. 2b depicts lower LMW PAHs concentration in winter because as already pointed out LMW PAHs are easily washed by surface runoff in this season. In Previous studies the bioavailable fractions of organic pollutants is reported as the sum of water-soluble and acidsoluble fractions which that negatively correlate with the log K ow of organic pollutants. Therefore, HMW PAHs are more stable than LMW PAHs and rainfall washes LMW more efficiently (Wang, Zhu, & Zhang, 2015) (Fig. 2b) . Table S3 reveals that the concentrations of PAHs in Asaluyeh street dust are more varied and higher than Isfahan (Iran), Beijing (China), Cairo (Egypt) and Ulsan (South Korea), and lower than Tehran and Bushehr (Iran), Manchester (UK), Guangzhou (China), New Delhi (India) and Istanbul (Turkey). Generally speaking, comparison of contamination in different regions and sampling sites is almost impossible. The reason is that many factors (including climatically and geological) can greatly affect the results. Hence, one must always bear in mind that origin of pollution may also be geogenic rather than anthropogenic. Furthermore, the intensity of precipitation varies in different locations and thus may wash street dust and pollutants differently. Finally, different sampling and analytical methods must be taken into account when a comparison is made. It is worth noting that similar studies were conducted in Asaluyeh, Bushehr and Bandar Abbas cities (south of Iran) with almost the same climate, weather, and sampling methods. The main reason for differing concentrations of PAHs in Bandar Abbas are anthropogenic activity such as traffic load and industrial activity. More specifically, the industrial activity (petroleum units) and traffic load in Asaluyeh are higher than Bushehr and Bandar Abbas resulting in higher PAHs concentration in Asaluyeh. Thus, traffic load and industrial activity are two important factors that affect contamination of street dust. As mentioned, Asaluyeh is limited to the Persian Gulf in the south and mountains to the north. Thus, the sweeping effect of wind blowing from sea toward mountains (the northern barrier) highlights air and street dust pollution due to lack of dispersion. This sweeping effect of wind can be severely reduced in areas surrounded by mountains. Short and long-term exposure to PM 10 in outdoor and indoor environments can result in respiratory and cardiovascular diseases placing an economic burden on society due to medical expenses or even death of experienced workers (Martins & da Gra\u00e7a, 2018) .",

Since PAHs were not investigated in Asaluyeh where the weather is warm and humid, for more certainty in PAHs results, sampling campaign was conducted in winter over approximately a ten-day period (27/1/2018 to 6/2/2018). The results revealed that the PM concentration varies in different days depending on weather condition. For example on 28/1/2018, high wind speed increased resuspended dusts. However, PM concentration and temperature generally had a positive correlation. Furthermore, it is evident that increasing temperature decreases soil moisture and consequently increases resuspended dust (Figs. 4 and S2) . The maximum (6.25 \u03bcg/m\u00b3), minimum (0.72 \u03bcg/m\u00b3) and average (2.38 \u03bcg/m\u00b3) concentrations of PM10 did not exceed the USEPA (100 \u03bcg/m\u00b3) and WHO (50 \u03bcg/m\u00b3) air quality standards. Also, according to PM10 concentration, calculated air quality indices (AQIs) ranged from 0.66 to 5.78 with an average of 2.2 indicating \"good\" category. Fig. 4 shows variations of the PAH concentrations in the (re-)suspended dust samples collected daily in industrial and urban areas. The highest \u2211PAHs is 4.73 ng/m 3 in N4 sampling site (a petrochemical company), while the minimum \u2211PAHs was 2.84 ng/m 3 in U1 station (an urban area). The average air dust PAH content in the study area is 3.75 ng/m 3 with non-carcinogenetic PAHs being more abundant than carcinogenetic ones. The results indicate higher total PAHs and LMW PAHs concentrations in the industrial areas (petrochemical units) compared with urban areas. Among combustion-derived PAHs, HMW-PAHs are abundantly generated at high temperature (automobile motors), while the petroleum-derived residues have relatively high LMW- PAHs content (Mai et al., 2003) . Figs. 3 and 4 reveal that the decreasing trend of LMW PAHs concentrations is: air dust > winter street dust > summer street dust. This clearly shows that two major factors affecting LMW PAHs concentration include (i) temperature (ii) volatility. It is no surprise that the filter dust has relatively high levels of LMW. LMW (2-3 rings) PAHs are known to be relatively more volatile resulting in their less abundance in settled dust compared to air particles. Also, given the lower temperature in winter, higher LMW PAHs concentration was observed. PAH concentration and temperature have a negative relationship since PAHs (especially LMW PAHs) are temperature sensitive and with increasing temperature, PAHs volatilize. It is interesting to know that PM and PAHs concentrations have a negative correlation owing to dilution of the PAHs concentration by increased suspended dust concentration (Figs. 4 and S2) .",

In this study, PCA as an extraction method, Varimax rotation for better representation of data and eigenvalues greater than 1 were used to extract factors. By using this statistical test, the number of variables can be reduced and presented in several main components, each containing several variables. The data were also analyzed by KMO test for evaluating the number of samples and Bartlett test for measuring similarity of data prior to performing factor analysis. The KMO and Bartlett values were more than 0.6 and lower than 0.3, respectively, while the total variance of the components was more than 70% of the total data variance. Hence, suitability of factor analysis was approved for reducing the number of variables and identifying hidden structures between the data. Regarding the results of PCA (Table 2) , the first component represented 67.6% of the total variance and included LMW PAHs (naphthalene, acenaphthene, fluorine, phenanthrene and anthracene) that mostly originate from oil leaks that evaporate and degrade rather easily Liu, Cheng, Ou et al., 2007) Liu, Cheng, Ou et al., 2007) . The presence of pyrene and chrysene in this group indicates that their origin is petroleum burning. Burning fossil fuels commonly leads to the formation of a large amount of pyrene, benzo[a]pyrene, benzo[b]fluoranthene and benzo[k]fluoranthene, all included in the second component (Hwang, Kusch, Barral, & Huffaker, 2003; Rajput & Lakhani, 2009). Benzo[g,h,i] perylene and indene have both similar molecular weight and tendency to be absorbed into dust particles. Generally, the MLR results indicated that the first and second components include 74.05% and 25.95% of the total PAHs concentration in Asaluyeh, respectively (Table 2) . A fact that reflects LMW PAHs being usually generated in petrochemical units in the industrial areas probably make the main proportion of PAHs in the study area.",

The Asaluyeh street dust and air dust particles are potentially influenced by three sources of PAHs including, (i) pyrogenic, (ii) petrogenic, and (iii) geogenic sources (soils, dust, minerals and etc.). The PMF model was run 20 times for the three factors in which PAHs with a signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio between 0.2 and 2, and missing or values below an MDL greater than 50% were considered as weak variables. Fig. 5 indicates the source profiles of PMF model in the street dust and air dust, respectively. In terms of street dust, Benzo(k)fluoranthene, Benzo(a)pyrene, Dibenz(a,h)anthracene, Benzo(ghi)perylene and Indene are grouped in the first factor with high factor loading values which feasibly originated from urban sources and include HMW PAHs. HMW compounds have similar chemical and physical properties and originate from vehicle motors. In the second factor which can be considered as representing industrial sources (refinery and petrochemical units), most LMW compounds constitute the main PAHs. On the other hand, the third factor demonstrates characteristics of 4 ring PAHs which are similar to HMW and LMW PAHs and are classified as moderate molecular weight (MMW) PAHs. They probably originated from mixed pyrogenic and petrogenic sources.",

The second and third factors include petrogenic and pyrogenic sources, respectively. HMW PAHs are mostly pyrogenic and originate from fossil fuel combustion (often in urban areas) and LMW PAHs are mostly petrogenic and originate from oil leaks (often petrochemical units in industrial areas). Also, the temperature is effective on all three factors, which is due to the effect of temperature on (re-)suspended dust generation and sensitiveness of PAHs to temperature Due to the fact that the transport and fates of PAHs of street dust and (re-)suspended dust in urban ecosystems such as Asaluyeh County should be identified, an estimation of the partitioning of PAHs between street dust and (re-)suspended dust may give beneficial insights. Generally, three scenarios may occur that include (i) direct PAHs attachment to air dust, (ii) street dust PAHs evaporate and then attach to air dust, (iii) resuspension of street dust as air dust. In the first two scenarios, LMW PAHs concentration is expected to be higher than HMW PAHs concentration. Hence, Fig. 6 reveals that the LMW PAHs concentration in the air dust is higher than street dust. The atmospheric LMW PAHs (2 and 3 rings) mainly occur in the vapour phase, while HMW PAHs (5 rings or more) are often limited to particles. Regarding atmospheric temperature MMW PAHs (4 rings) partition between the particulate and vapour phases (Srogi, 2007) . Therefore, according to Fig. 6 , PAH species display different transmission values in street dust Bold value signifies: P value < 0.05. ",

            "text": "Diagnostic ratios of PAH species are commonly used to distinguish pyrogenic and petrogenic sources of PAH compounds. These ratios can explain potential PAHs emission sources. Generally, LMW/HMW, Phe/ Ant, Ant/(Ant + Phe), Flu/(Flu + Pyr), BaA/(BaA + Chr) and Ind/ (Ind + BghiP) ratios are used for this purpose (Table S4) . LMW/HMW ratio < 1 indicates pyrogenic and > 1 shows a petrogenic source (Zhang, Dou et al., 2008) . Phe/Ant ratio > 15 and < 10 reveals petrogenic and pyrogenic sources, respectively (Takada, Onda, Harada, & Ogura, 1991) . Furthermore, Ant/(Ant + Phe) > 0.1 and < 0.1 are indicative of pyrogenic and petrogenic sources (Pies et al., 2008) . Similarly Flu/(Flu + Pyr) < 0.4 ratio indicate a petroleum source, while ratios between 0.4 and 0.6 indicate gasoline emissions, while ratios between 0.6 and 0.7 indicate diesel emissions sources (Yunkera et al., 2002) . If BaA/(BaA + Chr) is lower than < 0.2, it reveals petrogenic PAHs, and ranges from 0.22 to 0.55, 0.38 to 0.64 and 0.35 to 0.50 show gasoline emissions, diesel emissions and petrogenic origin, respectively (Simcik, Eisenreich, & Lioy, 1999; Sicre et al., 1987; Wang, Tian, Yang, Liu, & Yi-Fan, 2009; Yunkera et al., 2002) . Also, ratio of Ind/(Ind + BghiP) < 0.2; 0.2 to 0.5; and > 0.5 indicate petroleum and petrogenic; petroleum combustion; and coal, grass, and wood sources, respectively (Zhang, Luo, Wong, Zhao, & Zhang, 2006) . Table S4 presents the calculated ratios in this study. As it can be seen, PAHs in Asaluyeh street dust, generally originate from pyrogenic sources, but a closer look at each sampling site (Fig. S3) , reveals that PAHs sources (in both summer and winter) are mostly petrogenic in the industrial area and pyrogenic in urban areas, and probably originate from diesel and fossil fuel combustion and also automobiles, gasoline (Table S4 and Fig. S3 ). About (re-)suspended dust, all samples illustrated diesel emissions (except N2 sample that showed a mixed source). In the industrial areas, in addition to petrochemical units, the movement of vehicles is effective and the air pollution can move a long distance (Fig. S3) . For more certainty, logistic regression analysis was used in the current study. A benefit of logistic regression analysis compared with other statistical methods (such as t-test) is that it takes into account the number of polluted stations, while other statistical methods are based on the concentration of pollutants. In the current study, logistic regression analysis was used to compare pyrogenic and petrogenic sources of PAHs between industrial and urban areas (Table 6 ). It can be seen that there is a significant difference between industrial and urban areas in terms of PAHs origin (Sig = 0.04). Accordingly, Exp (B) indicated that petrogenic PAHs in industrial areas are 11.2 times more abundant than in urban areas. The reason is that in industrial areas, petrochemical and refining processes and consequently petrogenic sources for PAHs are more common. Also, combustion of fossil fuels by motor vehicles in urban areas produces pyrogenic PAHs.",

Based on residential/commercial and industrial scenarios for dermal contact and ingestion exposure pathways, the average estimated ILCRs for both adults and children is more than 10 \u22124 and for inhalation pathway, lower than 10 -6 (Table 7) . Therefore, dermal and ingestion pathways are the main routes of exposure to PAHs and pose a high potential health risk, while exposure through inhalation pathway is acceptable ( Table 7) . The results also indicated that mean cancer risk is higher than 10 \u22124 and carcinogenic risk is high and worrying. Also, the results revealed that estimated ILCR for residential/ commercial areas is higher than in industrial areas and that in the industrial areas dermal and inhalation pathways for indoor workers are more hazardous. Finally, according to different groups and scenarios, children are exposed to higher health risk (Table 7) .",

            "text": "TPH and PAHs distribution in Asaluyeh County revealed that the reason for pollutants accumulation in the street dust is not confined to human activity. The streets enriched with dust are a dynamic environment and can change easily. For instance, human activity, precipitation, wind blow, street wash out and management plans all affect street dust. On the other hand, pollutants are affected by temperature, sunlight, human activity, technology level, remediation operation and several other factors. Therefore, all above-mentioned factors should be considered in environmental monitoring. However, in the current study in order to obtain more precise results, strong statistical methods such as GEE, backward GEE, logistic regression, PCA-MLR and PMF were used. Logistic regression demonstrated petrogenic sources for PAHs in the industrial and pyrogenic sources in the urban areas. Since TPH is used as an organic pollutants indicator including PAHs, backward GEE model was used and demonstrated that TPH is more influenced by HMW PAHs, especially Indene. Also, decreasing trend of LMW PAHs concentrations is: air dust > winter street dust > summer street dust. This clearly shows that two major factors affecting LMWPAHs concentration include (i) temperature (ii) volatility. Eventually, this study will help to design effective control and mitigation strategies to improve ambient air quality by providing information about source pollutions and create engineering mechanisms for air ventilation. Finally, the proposed statistical methods provide a valuable and reliable means of environmental evaluation. ",
