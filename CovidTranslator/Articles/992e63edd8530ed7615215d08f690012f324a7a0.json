Detection of these virulent sequences below the *1% level, using standard cloning and sequence analysis, proved difficult, and thus a more sensitive reverse-transcription real-time PCR procedure was developed to detect both virulent and avirulent NDV F0 sequences. Reverse-transcription real-time PCR analysis of the quasispecies of a number of Newcastle disease virus field isolates, revealed variable ratios (approximately 1:4-1:4,000) of virulent to avirulent viral F0 sequences. Since the ratios of these sequences generally remained constant in the quasispecies population during replication, factors that could affect the balance of virulent to avirulent sequences during viral infection of birds were investigated. It was shown both in vitro and in vivo that virulent virus present in the quasispecies did not emerge from the ''avirulent background'' unless a direct selection pressure was placed on the quasispecies, either by growth conditions or by transient immunosuppression. The effect of a prior infection of the host by infectious bronchitis virus or infectious bursal disease virus on the subsequent emergence of virulent Newcastle disease virus was examined.",

The virus responsible was the Albiston Gorrie strain, which nucleotide sequence analysis revealed had an F0 cleavage signal of 112 RRQKRF 117 and an HN extension of seven amino acids [5] . It was not until the mid-1960s that it was recognized that Australia had its own endemic, avirulent strains of NDV, represented by the Queensland D26 and V4 strains [27] . These strains have since been characterized at the molecular level and shown to have avirulent F0 cleavage sites and HN extensions of 45 amino acids [25, 28] . Hooper et al. [13] reported that certain strains of NDV were involved in a respiratory form of the disease; however, these viruses were still considered to be of low virulence [14] . The first occurrence of virulent NDV since the 1930s occurred in NSW at Dean Park in 1998 [7] . These virulent viruses were characterized by sequence analysis and shown to have F0 cleavage sequences of 112 RRQRRF 117 and HN extensions of 45 amino acids. Using phylogenetic analysis, the virulent viruses were postulated to have emerged from an avirulent progenitor virus by the accumulation of two nucleotide changes at the F0 cleavage site [7, 8] .",

Previous molecular analysis of NDV associated with outbreaks of virulent disease in chickens in Australia (1998 Australia ( -2002 demonstrated that some field isolates were capable of harbouring virulent virus in their quasispecies without causing overt clinical signs of disease [16] . In one particular field isolate (PR-32) isolated during this study, 26% of the quasispecies consisted of virulent viruses; however, when inoculated into birds, the virus appeared to be avirulent. In the quasispecies model of RNA virus genomes, mutations occur through errors made in the process of copying existing RNA genome sequences. Due to the ongoing production of mutant sequences during the replication of the RNA virus genome, the virus population is made up of a ''mutational cloud'' of closely related sequences referred to as quasispecies [6] .",

Of interest, during the course of the NDV outbreak, several other viruses, notably the S vaccine strain of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) and infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) were co-isolated with NDV, and it was decided to investigate the possible effect(s) of a co-existing infection with these viruses on that of NDV. To these ends, we have developed a real-time PCR that was capable of effectively detecting the presence of both virulent and avirulent sequences in a viral quasispecies and investigated some selection parameters that could affect changes in this ratio, such that virulent virus was able to replicate in the brain of a bird and alter what would generally be an apparent avirulent infection into an outbreak of virulent virus in chickens. We also investigated the rate at which nucleotide mutations occurred in the NDV genome with passage in tissue culture and in vivo, with particular attention paid to the F0 cleavage site of the F gene.",

DNA fragments were purified after electrophoresis through 1% (w/v) agarose-TAE buffer containing ethidium bromide (0.5 lg/ml). DNA bands were visualized using a transilluminator, excised from the gel and purified using a QIAquick gel extraction kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (QIAGEN). Purified DNA was then sequenced using the Big Dye terminator sequencing system (ABI), and sequencing reactions were run and analysed on an ABI 377 Automated Sequencer (ABI). DNA fragments were sequenced in both directions from two independent RT-PCR reactions to generate a consensus sequence for each isolate. DNA sequences were aligned and analysed using the Clone Manager and Align programs (Scientific and Educational Software, State Line, USA).",

In the presence of trypsin, the time course for syncytium formation by avirulent viruses was the same as for virulent viruses. When the isolate 98-1154, with an estimated virulent component of 0.1% (using RRT-PCR), was placed on CEF cells (without trypsin), no apparent infection was seen for approximately 7 days. However, on the eighth day, synctia began to form, and CEF cells were cultured for another 24 h before harvesting the tissue culture medium. When the virus present in the tissue culture supernatant was analysed for quasispecies distribution by sequence analysis, it was found that 18% of the viruses contained virulent F0 sequences (RRQRRF). However, sequence analysis of Gene sequence analysis of Australian NDV isolates [8] had revealed the presence of another clade of ND viruses with HN extensions of seven amino acids, which had an F0 cleavage sequence of 112 RKQGRL 117 . These viruses, like the progenitor virus responsible for the virulent NDV outbreaks in Australia, require only two nucleotide changes in the sequence coding for the fusion gene cleavage site to result in an F0 gene coding for a virulent virus. Four field isolates of this clade (NG2, NG4, Q2-88 and Q4-88) were propagated on CEF cells in the absence of added trypsin for prolonged periods. Syncytium formation was seen in CEF cultures infected with all virus isolates within 9 days.

It was intended that these mixtures of PR-32 with plaque-purified 98-1154 would mimic the observation that field isolates of NDV are a mixture of sequences with different nucleotide changes needed for a virulent F0 cleavage sequence. Eight days after inoculation with NDV, three birds [one from the group that were inoculated solely with undiluted PR-32 (but challenged previously with IBV and killed humanely on day 9 after NDV inoculation), one from the group preimmunised with IBV and then inoculated with PR-32 and 98-1154 at a ratio of 1:4, and one from the control group (inoculated solely with PR-32:98-1154 at a ratio of 1:4 and not pre-immunised with IBV)] developed nervous clinical signs. One bird died, and the other two recovered from their clinical signs and appeared healthy. Tissue samples were harvested from the three birds described above, cultured in eggs and allantoic fluids, and analysed by PCR for the presence of NDV.

On the fourth day after NDV exposure, the entire flock (26 birds) exhibited respiratory clinical signs, a symptom generally seen with NDVs having 7-, 9-or 14-amino-acid extensions to their HN proteins [8, 13, 14] ; however, approximately one-third of the flock also developed classic clinical signs associated with virulent NDV infection (head tremors, ''star-gazing'' and ataxia). Fourteen days after infection with NDV, brains from these birds were examined by PCR and immuno-peroxidase staining for the presence of NDV genome and antigens, respectively. The presence of virulent virus was confirmed in the brains and tissues of these birds by sequence analysis of PCR products, which identified the virus as being derived from the plaque-purified PR-32 isolate.",

However, using RRT-PCR (reverse transcription realtime PCR), which is used as a quantitative method to determine the presence of individual sequences within nucleic acid mixtures [19] , it was possible to determine the ratio of virulent to avirulent F cleavage sequences within a mixed population of nucleic acid sequences to a much lower level of 1:1 9 10 -3 -1:5 9 10 -3 . This low level of virulent virus remains in the viral population without apparent affect in infected birds until a selection pressure is placed upon it. Infection of chickens with an NDV field isolate (PR-32) for which 26% of its viral population consisted of virulent virus was still defined by sequence analysis of the consensus sequence as an avirulent isolate. Moreover, the observed clinical signs in infected birds inoculated with this field isolate were also consistent with that of an avirulent infection, with no virulent clinical signs observed [16] . Thus, it appears that virulent sequences can remain undetected in the viral quasispecies until a selection pressure is placed upon the isolate so that the virulent virus becomes the dominant sequence present in the quasispecies and virulent clinical signs are observed upon infection. It was shown that under selection pressure, in the form of prolonged passage in tissue culture, virulent virus could emerge from an apparently avirulent inoculum. Avirulent plaque-purified NDV (98-1154) grown in CEF cells in the absence of trypsin resulted in the emergence of virulent virus after a period of 6-9 days of tissue culture, presumably due to mutations accumulating at the F0 cleavage site to alter the sequence to 112 RRQRRF 117 . The level of virulent virus that emerged after tissue culture was shown by quasispecies distribution to increase from an undetectable level to 1-18% of the total viral population. Virulent virus was also demonstrated to be present in field isolates of NDV isolated in Australia in the 1980s, which belonged to a separate clade from those associated with the 1998-2002 NDV outbreaks. These latter viruses were shown to have HN extensions of seven amino acids. The presence of these virulent viruses in an avirulent background remained undetected until a selection pressure was applied. This observation demonstrated that there exist at least two clades of Australian ND viruses that are two nucleotides away from having a virulent F cleavage motif and have the potential to cause virulent NDV outbreaks.",

In the field, several mechanisms could be responsible for these selection pressures, e.g. tissue tropism or altered host states, such that replication of the virulent virus is favoured over that of an avirulent virus. One mechanism explored was the presence of a preexisting avian virus prior to subsequent NDV infection. In many instances, field isolates of viruses from infected poultry contained other avian viruses such as the vaccine strain S of the coronavirus IBV, the birnavirus IBDV or NDV. Therefore, the possibility that a pre-existing viral infection could alter the tissue tropism of NDV was investigated.",

After a delay of several days, respiratory clinical signs began to appear, followed by the appearance of classic neural signs. Virulent virus was isolated from these birds from both neural tissue and swabs. Of interest were some of the birds that survived the transient expression of neural signs seen with the PR-32 virus and IBV pre-infection. The two birds that survived recovered completely within 24 h and thereafter could not be distinguished clinically from other birds in the flock. This had been observed with other birds infected with virulent NDV during the Australian outbreaks and may be an important factor in the ability to clearly diagnose the clinical signs associated with these viral infections. PCR amplification of tissues and cloacal swabs of the two surviving birds from the IBV experiment were negative for IBV and NDV at the termination of the experiment. It has been noted that if a prior infection with IBDV exists, this can cause transient immunosuppression in infected birds [4, 29] . This may explain the observation that after IBDV inoculation, NDV infection occurred and immunosuppression allowed rampant NDV replication of the PR-32 isolate, which then acquired a mutation at its F0 cleavage site. This virus could then reach neural tissue and replicate prior to elimination of the virus by the immune system, resulting in virulent virus dominating the quasispecies and with virulent clinical signs being seen in the infected bird.",

Thus, this method is unable to detect quite high levels of virulent virus hiding in the population, as was demonstrated with the original field isolate of PR-32. This isolate had a quasispecies population comprising 26% virulent sequences [16] , but sequence analysis resulted in an avirulent consensus sequence. Thus, sequence analysis as currently performed may not detect virulent sequences present in field isolates of NDV. It has been postulated that virulent and avirulent NDV strains arose from each other by spontaneous mutation [17] . It is widely recognized that mixtures of virulent and avirulent viruses often co-exist in a single NDV sample, but only the majority phenotype is expressed [9] . This variation has been found regardless of whether the virus population originated from a single particle or from many. Most subpopulations in an NDV strain exist at ratios to each other that range from 1:1 to 1:50 [10] . Virulent strains of NDV have been found to be more consistently heterogeneous than strains of lower virulence [22] .",

The fastest way to disrupt stable virus equilibrium is to change its adaptive landscape, which happens frequently in nature through the host immune response, infection of a new host or tissue or interference from defective interfering particles [12] . Thus, it may be inferred that outbreaks caused by virulent NDV can occur by coinfection with other viruses in poultry, followed by repeated NDV re-infection in these bird populations. The suggested implication of an involvement of immunosuppression in the emergence of virulent NDV (by IBDV) and the possibility that other avian viruses may exert an influence on the host are worthy of further investigation.",
