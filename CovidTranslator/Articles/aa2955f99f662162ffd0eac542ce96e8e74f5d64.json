            "text": "The nucleocapsid (N) protein of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) is the principal component of the viral nucleocapsid and localizes to the nucleolus. Peptide sequence analysis of the N protein of several North American isolates identified two potential nuclear localization signal (NLS) sequences located at amino acids 10 -13 and 41-42, which were labeled NLS-1 and NLS-2, respectively. Peptides containing NLS-1 or NLS-2 were sufficient to accumulate enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) in the nucleus. The inactivation of NLS-1 by site-directed mutagenesis or the deletion of the first 14 amino acids did not affect N protein localization to the nucleolus. The substitution of key lysine residues with uncharged amino acids in NLS-2 blocked nuclear/nucleolar localization. Site-directed mutagenesis within NLS-2 identified the sequence, KKNKK, as forming the core localization domain within NLS-2. Using an in vitro pull-down assay, the N protein was able to bind importin-\u2423, importin-\u2424 nuclear transport proteins. The localization pattern of N-EGFP fusion peptides represented by a series of deletions from the C-and N-terminal ends of the N protein identified a region covering amino acids 41-72, which contained a nucleolar localization signal (NoLS) sequence. The 41-72 N peptide when fused to EGFP mimicked the nucleolar-cytoplasmic distribution of native N. These results identify a single NLS involved in the transport of N from the cytoplasm and into nucleus. An additional peptide sequence, overlapping NLS-2, is involved in the further targeting of N to the nucleolus.",

PRRSV isolates are further divided into North American and European genotypes, represented by VR-2332 and the Lelystad virus, respectively (Nelsen et al., 1999) . Other members of the arterivirus group include lactate dehydro-genase-elevating virus (LDV) of mice, equine arteritis virus (EAV), and simian hemorrhagic fever virus (SHFV). The arteriviruses, toroviruses, and coronaviruses are members of a single order, Nidovirales (Cavanagh, 1997) . The arteriviruses structurally resemble togaviruses but similar to coronaviruses replicate via a nested 3\u0408-coterminal set of subgenomic mRNAs, which possess a common leader and a poly-A tail (Lai, 1990; Snijder and Meulenberg, 1998) .",

Even though the North American and European PRRSV N proteins are only about 63% identical at the amino acid level, they share a common antigenic region between amino acids 52 and 69 (Rodriguez et al., 1997; Meulenberg et al., 1998; Wootton et al., 1998) . During virus replication, the N protein localizes to the cytoplasm and nucleolus of cultured porcine macrophages and MARC-145 cells infected with either North American or European PRRSV genotypes (Rowland et al., 1999 ). An identical nucleolar-cytoplasmic distribution pattern is observed for the N protein of another arterivirus, EAV (Tijms et al., 2002) , and for the N proteins of group I, II, and III coronaviruses Wurm et al., 2001) . The arterivirus and coronavirus N proteins, when expressed alone or fused to the red-shifted enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP), localize to the nucleolus, demonstrating that translocation across the nuclear pore complex (NPC) and accumulation in the nucleolus are independent of other viral proteins (Rowland et al., 1999; Wurm et al., 2001; Tijms et al., 2002) .",

In addition, cells were identified that contained N in the nucleoplasmic region surrounding the nucleoli. These observations suggest that the localization of N to the nucleolus is a complex and highly regulated process.",

            "text": "The translocation of a protein from the cytoplasm, across the NPC, and into the nucleus is initiated by the binding of a nuclear localization signal (NLS) on the cargo protein to the importin-\u2423 shuttle protein. The cargo/importin-\u2423 complex binds to a second shuttle protein, importin-\u2424, which is then targeted to the NPC. In the presence of additional accessory proteins, including Ran-GDP, and ATP as a source of energy, the cargo/importin complex is transported across the NPC and released into the nucleoplasm (reviewed in Gorlich and Kutay, 1999) . Classical NLS sequences incorporate regions enriched in basic amino acids and generally conform to one of three types (Nakai and Kanehisa, 1992; Hicks and Raikhel, 1995) . The \"pat4\" NLS consists of a continuous stretch of four basic amino acids (lysine or arginine) or three basic amino acids associated with histidine or proline. The \"pat7\" NLS starts with a proline and is followed within three residues by a segment containing three basic residues out of four. The third type of NLS, known as a \"bipartite\" motif, consists of two basic amino acids, a 10-amino-acid spacer, and a 5-amino-acid segment containing at least three basic residues. There are exceptions to these established rules. Proteins that lack an NLS can localize to the nucleus as a result of cotransport with other nuclear proteins. Proteins which possess an NLS may remain cytoplasmic, especially if the NLS is not exposed on the protein's surface (Roberts et al., 1987) . And finally, small proteins less than 50 -70 kDa can passively diffuse through the nuclear pore complex (Paine, 1975; Gorlich and Kutay, 1999) . The addition of an NLS to a small protein that passively diffuses through the NPC confers to that protein all of the properties of NLS-dependent transport (Jans and Hubner, 1996) .",

Therefore, the targeting of a protein to the nucleolus occurs through the diffusion of the protein through the nucleoplasm and accumulation in the nucleolus. Localization to the nucleolus is mediated by a nucleolar targeting sequence (NoTS), which functions by forming an interaction with a nucleolar component, such as a nucleolar protein, rRNA, or rDNA, or small nucleolar RNAs. By definition, the NoTS by itself cannot translocate a protein across the NPC, but once in the nucleoplasm is capable of targeting the protein to the nucleolus (Lixin et al., 2001) . Another route to the nucleolus is the direct translocation of a protein from the cytoplasm to the nucleolus by cotransport with a nucleolar shuttle protein, such as nucleolin, fribrillarin, and B-23, which normally shuttle between the cytoplasm and the nucleolus. The purpose of this study was to gain insight into the mechanism of PRRSV N protein localization to the nucleolus by characterizing the individual oligopeptides domains, which participated in the translocation of the N protein across the NPC and localization to the nucleolus.",

The purpose of this series of experiments was to determine if the translocation of N protein was dependent on a specific NLS domain. Peptide sequence analysis of the N protein of the North American PRRSV isolate SDSU-23983 using the PSORT computer program identified two NLS motifs, a \"pat-4\" NLS, 10-KRKK, and a \"pat-7\" NLS, 41-PGKKNKK (Fig. 1 ). Based on a hydrophilicity plot of the peptide sequence, both NLSs were predicted to be located in regions of the N protein that are highly hydrophilic and accessible for interaction with shuttle proteins. For convenience, the putative NLSs were designated NLS-1 and NLS-2, respectively. Peptide sequences of the N protein from 70 North American isolates deposited in GenBank showed that both NLSs are highly conserved among North American PRRSV isolates. The principal difference between isolates was the conserved substitution of lysines with arginines (data not shown). The European Lelystad virus N protein also contains NLS-1 and NLS-2 domains, which are located at residues 9 and 47, respectively.",

The lack of localization activity from NLS-1 could reflect the inhibitory activity of adjacent residues, which could block the interaction between the NLS and the receptor domain on the shuttle protein. Another possibility was that the NLS was blocked as a result of the tertiary or quaternary conformation of the N protein. Since mutations in the C-terminal 11 amino acids can significantly alter the conformation of the N protein (Wootton et al., 1998) , we investigated the possibility that mutations in the C-terminus, sufficient to affect recognition by mAb, would reveal nuclear localization activity from NLS-1.

To confirm that localization of NP(1-115,G43G44) was NLS-1 dependent, we followed the localization of a NLS double mutant, NP(14 -115,G43G44)-EGFP. As shown in Fig. 3C , the pro-tein product was retained in the cytoplasm, demonstrating the loss of NLS activity after removal of NLS-1. Removal of eight amino acids from the N protein resulted in the loss of immunoreactivity with SR-30 and VO-17 mAbs (Table  1) , but did not alter recognition by SDOW-17, MR-30, or JP-24. The ability of a mutation in the C-terminus of the N protein to recover activity from NLS-1, which is located at the opposite end of the protein, demonstrates that the overall conformation of the native N protein is responsible for blocking NLS-1 activity. Furthermore, since the deletion of amino acids did not affect binding by three of the six mAbs, only a small conformational change is necessary to expose NLS-1.",

Immunoprecipitation of radiolabled proteins from infected cell lysates or in vitro translated products using N-specific antibodies yielded a protein, which migrated at approximately 15 kDa (Fig. 4A, lane 1, Fig. 4B , lane 3). Immunoprecipitation of in vitro translated N protein, derived from the pCITE vector, yielded a slightly slower migrating product (Fig. 4B, lane 3) . The slower migration was consistent with the addition of amino acid residues contributed by the pCITE vector. Since the PRRSV N protein typically forms noncovalent homodimers (Wootton and Yoo, 2003), GST-N was able to precipitate radiolabeled N from cell lysates from infected but not mockinfected cells (Fig, 4B, lanes 4 and 5) . As a negative control, Sepharose GST alone failed to pull down proteins corresponding to the size of native (Fig. 4B lanes 1 and 2) or in vitro translated N proteins (data not shown).

No bands of the correct molecular size were observed when radiolabeled proteins from mockinfected cells or translation products from pCITE vector RNA were incubated with GST-importin proteins. These data show that nuclear shuttle proteins have the capacity to form specific interactions with the PRRSV N protein. Furthermore, the capacity of importin-\u2423 and importin-\u2424 to bind in vitro translated N protein indicates that N-importin interactions are independent of other viral proteins.",

The NoLS associated with viral proteins is usually no longer than 20 amino acid residues and possesses at least nine basic resi-dues overall, including one continuous stretch of four basic amino acids, or two stretches of three basic amino acids. Furthermore, an NLS is usually embedded within the NoLS peptide sequence (Kubota et al., 1999) . Peptide sequence analysis of the regions surrounding NLS-1 and NLS-2 showed no identity with this type of NoLS motif (see Fig.  1 ). Therefore, to locate the smallest peptide sufficient to function as an NoLS, amino acids we followed the localization of NP-EGFP fusion proteins after sequentially removal of amino acid residues from the N-and C-terminal ends. A summary of the results, presented in Fig. 5 , showed that the N protein construct lacking the first 40 amino acids (NP(41-123)) or last 51 amino acids (NP(1-72)) produced a nucleolar-cytoplasmic distribution pattern similar to the full-length N protein, with a small amount of fluorescence in the nucleoplasmic region surrounding the nucleoli. Removal of a single amino acid from either construct, NP(42- 123) or NP(1-71), produced a change in the distribution of EGFP fluorescence, which was most noticeable as an increase in the accumulation of the fusion protein in the nucleoplasm surrounding the nucleoli combined with a corresponding decrease of fluorescent protein in the cytoplasm ( Fig. 5D and E) . The 41-72 peptide, when fused to EGFP, localized to the cytoplasm and the nucleolus (Fig. 5G ) demonstrating that the 41-72 oligopeptide alone can produce a localization pattern similar to the full-length wildtype N protein, supporting the possibility that this domain contains the NoLS sequence.",

The removal of lysine residue pairs 43-KK or 46-KK abolished nuclear transport, but did not affect recognition by a panel of conformation-dependent anti-N mAbs.

Therefore, the absence of immunoreactivity suggests that the N-terminal region, including NLS-1, is normally hidden from the surface of the protein. NLS-1 nuclear localization activity was recovered following the removal of eight amino acids from the C-terminus. The loss of SR-30 and VO-17 reactivity indicated a change in the conformation of the N protein, sufficient to expose NLS-1. Another possibility is that NLS-1 is normally blocked as a result of oligomerization with other N protein molecules. Oligomerization with other N protein molecules may block NLS-1 without affecting the accessibility of NLS-2. In the context of the native protein, NLS-1 can be considered a cryptic NLS.",

            "text": "NLS-dependent nuclear transport is initiated by the interaction between the NLS on the cargo protein with importin-\u2423 (Gorlich and Mattaj, 1996) . A separate importin-\u2424-binding (IBB) domain on the N-terminus of the importin-\u2423 is responsible for forming the interaction between the importin-\u2423/cargo complex and importin-\u2424 (Moroianu et al., 1996) . Importin-\u2424 does not contain an NLS binding site; however, the NLS on viral proteins, such as HIV Rev, can bind directly to importin-\u2424 (Henderson and Percipalle, 1997) . Using a pull-down assay, we demonstrated that the N protein of PRRSV is able to form interactions with murine GST-importin-\u2423 and -\u2424 proteins (Fig.  4) . Furthermore, the formation of an N protein/importin complex using in vitro translated N demonstrates that N protein binding is independent of other viral proteins. Even though these results demonstrate the capacity of N to form stable interactions with importin, these data do not exclude the possibility for the participation of other shuttle proteins in the translocation of N into the nucleus/nucleolus. For example, major nucleolar proteins, such as nucleolin and B-23, can function in the transport of viral proteins from the cytoplasm to the nucleolus through the interaction between long stretches of acidic residues in B-23 and nucleolin with highly basic NoLS domains. B-23 can form stable interactions with Tat, Rev, Rex, and adenovirus V proteins (Frankhauser et al., 1991; Stauber and Pavlakis, 1998; Adachi et al., 1993; Matthews, 2001) . Hiscox et al. (2001) , after comparing the peptide sequences of infectious bronchitis virus and PRRSV N proteins, concluded that the PRRSV NoLS was located between amino acids 37 and 52 (Table  3) . However, our results present a modified picture in which an overlapping peptide covering amino acids 41-72 was capable of reproducing the nucleolar-cytoplasmic localization pattern of the wild-type N protein (Fig. 5) . Even though the 41-72 domain contains an NLS, which is consistent with other viral NoLS sequences, there are some notable differences. The overall length is longer than the 20 amino acids for the typical viral NoLS sequences (Table 3 ) (Kubota et al., 1999) . The second difference is a paucity of basic residues (eight lysines/arginines) and the incorporation of five negatively charged amino residues, making the 41-72 domain relatively more acidic when compared with other viral NoLS domains. At this time we propose that the 41-72 peptide contains an NLS, represented by the core peptide KKNKK, and a separate nucleolar localization domain, which targets N to the nucleolus. The EAV N protein contains a potential nuclear export signal (NES) sequence located at residue 54, which may participate in the translocation of N from the nucleus and into the cytoplasm (Tijms et al., 2002) . The classical NES motif, found in HIV Rev and cellular proteins, is X-R (2-4) -X-R 2 -X-R-X, where X represents a hydrophobic amino acid, such as leucine, isoleucine, or valine, and the letter R represents any amino acid (Fischer et al., 1995; Hope, 1999; Henderson and Eleftheriou, 2000) . Almost all classical NES sequences contain the X-R-X tripeptide core sequence. The HIV Rev protein NES is LGLPPLERLTL (the hydrophobic residues are underlined). The PRRSV N protein contains two regions, sufficiently enriched in hydrophobic amino acids, to function as potential NES sequences. The first, located between amino acids 19 and 30, does not contain an X-R-X sequence. The second peptide, 106-LPTHHTVR-LIRV, contains at least one core tripeptide sequence (in bold and see Fig. 1 ). A nearly identical peptide sequence is found in the N protein of the Lelystad virus. It remains to be determined if the PRRSV protein is exported from the nucleus by way of a classical NES.",

(2002) showed that a coronavirus N protein was able to bind nucleolin, which was associated with the inhibition of cytokinesis, a possible viral strategy to divert biosynthetic resources from the dividing nucleus and into the cytoplasm. Nucleolar N could also have a neutral effect on cell function, i.e., a simple case of molecular mimicry. For instance, peptide regions enriched in basic amino acids, required to bind viral RNA, can mimic NLS and/or NoLS sequences (LaCasse and Lefebvre, 1995) . One intriguing possibility is that localization of N protein to the nucleus/nucleolus represents a novel host cell protection strategy. The sequestration of large quantities of nucleocapsid precursor in the nucleolus would deprive a cytoplasmic virus of an essential structural protein. The incorporation of an export signal in the N protein would represent a counterstrategy, which would ensure that a sufficient quantity of N protein was returned to the cytoplasm where it could participate in the assembly of virions.",

GST fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (Novagen) as described in Wootton et al. (1998) . One hundred milliliters of log phase bacterial culture was induced with 1 mM IPTG, and after 3 h bacteria were pelleted by centrifugation, resuspended in 5 ml of PBS, and sonicated on ice three times for 30 s. Triton X-100 was added to a final concentration of 1%, and proteins were disassociated for 30 min at 4\u00b0C with constant agitation. The insoluble fraction was removed by centrifugation, and the supernatant, containing the GST fusion proteins, was incubated with 100 l of a 50% slurry of glutathione Sepharose 4B beads (Pharmacia) overnight at 4\u00b0C. Beads complexed to the GST fusion proteins were collected at 500g and washed three times in PBS and resuspended in a final volume of 250 l of PBS containing 30% glycerol and 0.1% Triton X-100. To produce radiolabeled recombinant N protein, the N gene was cloned into pCITE and transcribed in vitro using T7 RNA polymerase MEGAscript (Ambion) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The resulting RNA was translated using the rabbit reticulocyte lysate translation kit (Promega) in the presence of 50 Ci/ml of [ 35 S]methionine (New England Nuclear, specific activity 3000 Ci/mmol). To produce the radiolabeled authentic viral N protein, PRRSVinfected MARC-145 cells were labeled at 30 h post-infection with 50 Ci/ml of [ 35 S]methionine for 8 h. Cells were washed and lysed using RIPA buffer (TNE with 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1% SDS).",
