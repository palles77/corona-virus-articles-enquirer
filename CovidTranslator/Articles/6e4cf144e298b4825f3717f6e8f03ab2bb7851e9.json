We chose the word co-detection rather than co-infection or co-colonization because co-infection means all identifi ed microorganisms contributed to the pathogenic effect, and co-colonization may not indicate the causative agent. Co-detection indicates that >1 other pathogen was detected in a sample. The differences among the defi nitions have etiologic meaning, but the data presented here cannot be used directly to address etiology.",

Nasal swab samples have greater potential for contamination with normal fl ora, particularly S. aureus. No data on asymptomatic carriers were available because these persons rarely seek healthcare. However, these fi ndings raise questions about the effectiveness of the single-agent etiology approach toward infectious diseases. Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus and multiple other pathogens are often detected during autopsy (1,2), indicating that co-infection may play a major role in the disease process. In addition, detection of multiple pathogens is associated with increased critical illness in children (7) .",

However, no suggestions were provided for meeting this need. Furthermore, the Centers \"underscore the importance of managing patients with infl uenza who also might have bacterial pneumonia with both empiric antibacterial therapy and antiviral medications\" (2) without identifying measures that would make this task tangible. Current practices of clinical diagnosis based on signs and symptoms inherently lack this type of information. The true value of a multiplex molecular method of screening for infectious respiratory agents depends on the clinical relevance. Among the samples with >1 positive results, 53% had positive results for viral pathogens without co-detection of bacterial pathogens. For these patients, prescription of antimicrobial drugs on the basis of clinical fi ndings alone could serve to spread drug resistance through selective pressure on normal fl ora. Furthermore, limited secondary treatment resources, such as oseltamivir administration during a pandemic, could be prioritized on the basis of screening results. Of the 10,624 samples studied, 70.7% were negative for the pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus strain.",
