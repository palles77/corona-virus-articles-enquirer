The authors used the siRNAs selected from 48 candidates. 9 However, it has been reported that targeting several other sequences in the SARS genome can be effective. 8, 11 In particular the leader sequence, which is present in all of the mRNAs of the SARS-CoV genes, is likely to be a more effective target. 11 Finally, since RNA is not stable in cells, DNA plasmids expressing small hairpin (sh)RNAs 10 might be a better approach for delivering RNAi reagents to the airway epithelial cells. Although delivery of plasmid DNA to the lung is generally not very efficient, helper-dependent (gutted) adenoviral (HD-Ad) vectors have been shown to be highly efficient. 13 Unlike the conventional adenoviral vectors that cause strong host immune responses, HD-Ad vectors are fully devoid of viral genes with significantly reduced host immune responses and have been successfully used to express shRNAs in cultured cells. 14 Whether SARS can be conquered remains to be proven. Nevertheless, the study by Li et al. 4 demonstrated a novel strategy to mitigate SARS and this approach may be applicable to combating other emerging infectious diseases caused by viruses. '",
