The purification procedure involved ammonium sulfate precipitation, ion-exchange chromatography on CM-Sephadex C-50, gel filtration chromatography on Sephacryl S-200HR, and gel filtration chromatography on POROS HS-20. The 20 N-terminal amino acid sequences were determined to be DEYSKPCCDLCMCTRRCPPQ, demonstrating close homology with the sequences of leguminous trypsin inhibitors. The molecular mass and isoelectric point of the inhibitor were estimated by SDS-PAGE and isoelectric focusing to be 19.9 kDa and 6.2, respectively. Trypsin could be completely inhibited by Glytine when the weight ratio was 1.5. The inhibitory activity of Glytine was unaffected by exposure to temperatures up to 100\u00b0C, or within the pH range 2-12. Besides trypsin-chymotrypsin inhibition activity, Glytine demonstrated other biological activities including antiproliferative activity against tumor cells including human liver hepatoma cells Bel-7402 and neuroblastoma cells SHSY5Y. In addition, the inhibitor showed antifungal activity against Pythium aphanidermatum, Fusarium oxysporum, Alternaria alternata (Fr.) Keiss, Fusarium solani, and Botrytis cinerea. This study extended research on leguminous trypsin-chymotrypsin inhibitor and suggested exploitable potential.",

Protease inhibitor is listed as one type of these bioactive proteins having been researched by a number of investigators. Besides inhibiting the activity of protease, protein inhibitors of serine including trypsin and chymotrypsin concurrently demonstrated additional biological activities. For example, HIV protease inhibitors and SARS coronavirus proteinase inhibitors may be used to fight against HIV and SARS virus, respectively [1] . Plant protease inhibitors may be involved in the regulation of programmed cell death in plants. They show insecticidal and antifungal activities, but can also cause inhalant and food allergies [2, 3] . Epidemiological evidence suggests that a diet rich in legumes reduces the incidence of cancer and that this may be due to the presence of protease inhibitors [4] . Both in vivo antitumor and in vitro antiproliferative activities of trypsin inhibitors have been reported [5] .",

The conformation of Kunitz-type trypsin inhibitors is mainly b sheet with a small amount of regular sheet. The insecticidal activity of Kunitz-type trypsin inhibitors has been demonstrated using transgenic plants [8] . Kunitz-type trypsin inhibitors also inhibit other enzymes, such as chymotrypsin, a-amylase, and human plasmin, and block the conversion of prothrombin to thrombin [3] . The Yellow soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.) produced both Bowman-Birk and Kunitz-type trypsin inhibitors [9] . The formation, degradation, and gene expression of Kunitz-type trypsin inhibitor in the soy bean have also been reported [3] . The seeds of bitter gourds, sponge gourds, wax gourds, and M. cochinchinensis produce squash-type trypsin inhibitors with a molecular mass of about 3 kDa [10] .",

Antifungal proteins may also contribute to the defense of a plant against predators such as insects [11] as well as pathogens such as fungi [12, 13] . It is well recognized that there is a wide diversity of antifungal proteins produced by leguminous plants. Some of these proteins and peptides have been classified into different groups based on their structure and/or functions [14] . Combinations of antifungal proteins may be found in a single species of bean; for example, in addition to a protease inhibitor, a lysozyme and a nonspecific lipid transfer protein were isolated from Mung bean (Vigna radiata), and all have fungal inhibition activity [12, 13, 15] .",
