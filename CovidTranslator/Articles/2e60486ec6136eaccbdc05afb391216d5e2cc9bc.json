Instead, the special device, moxa box or moxa holder is used to cover several acupoints simultaneously in one moxibustion intervention. The duration of treatment is over 30 min generally and it will be even longer if the heat-sensitive moxibustion is exerted.

Note: Picture from www.chinanews.com In response to the Chinese government's call upon the solidarity in the fight against COVID-19 and to better apply the external techniques of TCM to the prevention, treatment and rehabilitation of COVID-19, China Association of Acupuncture-Moxibustion (CAAM) developed and issued Guidance for acupuncture and moxibustion intervention on COVID-19 (Second edition) (hereinafter Guidance) [7]. The main content of Guidance is introduced as follows to assist in the effective application of TCM techniques, e.g. acupuncture and moxibustion in treatment of COVID-19. Main content of Guidance Three sections are included in Guidance, named the principle of acupuncture-moxibustion interventions, the methods of acupuncture-moxibustion interventions, and the self-interventions of acupuncture and moxibustion at home under the instruction of physician. Regarding the principle of acupuncture-moxibustion interventions, Guidance emphasizes: The rigorous quarantine and disinfection are required. No matter for the confirmed cases or the convalescent cases, they can be treated in the same room respectively and every suspected one should be isolated in a single room for treatment. During the clinical treatment stage, acupuncture can be combined with western medications and Chinese herbal decoction to achieve the collaborative effect. For the cases at the recovery stage, the core role of acupuncture-moxibustion should be played in the rehabilitation. It is recommended to set up acupuncture-moxibustion based COVID-19 rehabilitation clinic. In reference to the clinical stage identification of TCM suggested in Diagnosis and treatment plan of corona virus disease 2019 (tentative seventh edition) issued by National Health Commission (NHC) of the PRC and State Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine (SATCM) of the PRC, three stages are included in the treatment with acupuncture and moxibustion, e.g. medical observation stage, medical treatment stage and recovery stage. The therapeutic regimens of each stage are introduced as follows. Acupuncture-moxibustion interventions at the medical observation stage (suspected cases) Objective: To motivate the antipathogenic qi of human body and the functions of lung and spleen and scatter epidemic pathogens so as to strengthen the defensive capacity of internal organs.
