The results disprove the ACE inhibition as the only single mechanism and also the direct interaction of potentiating peptides with the bradykinin receptors in transfected COS-7 cells as molecular mechanism of potentiation. Our results indicate a stimulation of inositol phosphates (IP n ) formation independently from the B 2 receptor. Furthermore, the results with La 3+ support the role of extracellular Ca 2+ and its influx through corresponding channels. The missing effect of calyculin on the GPI disproves the role of phosphatases in the potentiating action. These experimental studies should not only contribute to a better understanding of the potentiating mechanisms but also incorporate a shift in the research towards the immune system, in particular towards the immunocompetent polymorphonuclear leukocytes. The chemotaxis of these cells can be potentiated most likely by exclusive inhibition of the enzymatic degradation of bradykinin. Thus the obtained results give evidence that the potentiation of the bradykinin action can occur by different mechanisms, depending on the system and on the applied potentiating factor.",

Indeed the history of BK isolation and characterization has long been closely related to the use of potentiating factors. Werle and coworkers [74] used snake venoms to trigger the formation of BK from plasma and to describe this tissue hormone functionally. Immediately after the isolation, chemical characterization, synthesis and functional characterization, certain snake venoms were described as bradykinin potentiating compounds. Kato and Suzuki [39, 40] , Ferreira et al. [26, 27] , and Ondetti et al. [13, 59] isolated different oligopeptides with bradykinin potentiating activity from the venoms of the two snakes Agkistrodon halys blomhoffii and Bothrops jararaca, including the bradykinin potentiating nonapeptide BPP 9\u2423 (trade name TEPROTIDE).",

Very recently new potentiating peptides have been isolated from the venom of B. jararaca [36] . Surprisingly peptides with potentiating activity have also been formed by the partial hydrolysis of proteins taken from serum [80] , hemoglobin [38, 66, 81] , milk [34, 46] , or wheat germ [51] . Also degradation fragments of angiotensin such as the heptapeptide 1-7 were found to potentiate the BK action [64] .

The inhibition of ACE by various peptide and nonpeptide compounds did not correlate well with the potentiating activity [5, 10] . Furthermore, the maximum of the BK-induced contraction of guinea pig ileum can be enhanced by potentiating compounds [77] . Also the action evoked by enzymatically stable BK agonists can be potentiated in some test systems [78] . Repeated exposure of porcine coronary arteries to BK has led to receptor desensitization. The addition of the potentiating compounds quinaprilat or angiotensin 1-7 fully restored the relaxant effect at a point when BK alone was no longer able to induce relaxation [76] . At the molecular level the co-immunoprecipitation of ACE and the B 2 receptor with an anti receptor antibody clearly indicates an interaction of both partners on the cell membrane [50] . Despite all these contradictory and to some degree confusing findings Regoli and coworkers [29] and Dendorfer et al. [17] have demonstrated that in their test systems (rabbit isolated aorta and venoconstriction) the potentiation by therapeutically used ACE inhibitors results exclusively from the inhibition of enzymatic BK degradation. Nevertheless, the group of Regoli found under influence of ACE inhibitors, a resensitization of the rabbit jugular vein [31] and a change in the density of B 2 receptors in rat spinal cord [60] .",

Phosphorylation of the receptor by protein kinase C leads to internalization [19] (desensitization) and dephosphorylation by phosphatase SHP-2 to resensitization [18, 49] . Bradykinin potentiating factors can influence both desensitization and resensitization, as well as the hetero-oligomerization of the B 2 receptor including the interaction with ACE [54] and other degrading enzymes [15] . At the level of signal pathways, a crosstalk with other pathways induced by other hormones [43] or nonreceptormediated intracellular reactions [28] have been observed.",

Later studies on the molecular basis of bradykinin-evoked actions have been performed more and more on cell cultures instead of smooth muscles. These studies have used primarily Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO cells) cotransfected with the B 2 receptor and ACE, ACE-mutants or neutral endopeptidase (NEP) [15] . Endothelial cells have been used because they constitutively express the B 2 receptor and ACE [49] .",

Our synthesized analogues and fragments of the highly active nonapeptide BPP 9\u2423 show in some cases differences between potentiation and enzyme inhibition of more than five orders of magnitude. This result indicates strongly different structural requirements for both biological activities, and is inconsistent with the exclusive reduction of potentiating action to the inhibition of ACE, as discussed by Regoli and his coworkers [31] and Dendorfer et al.

The inhibitory activity seems to depend on the whole sequence.

At first, the potentiating factors could act like allosteric effectors stabilizing the active receptor conformation. Secondly, these factors could influence the phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of cytosolic parts of the receptor, resulting in desensitization and resenzitization of the receptor. A third possible mechanism consists in the influence of potentiating factors on receptor heterooligomerization. AbdAlla et al. [1] found that both the active high affinity angiotensin receptor AT 1 and the BKR-B 2 are able to form heteromeric complexes in smooth muscle cells. Most importantly, this heterodimerization evokes a signal en-hancement, a further possible useful explanation of the potentiating effect.",

This finding clearly demonstrates that the analogues of BPP 9\u2423 used in this study do not act as allosteric effectors stabilizing the active receptor conformation. Because COS-7 cells do not contain ACE, a heterodimerization of the B 2 receptor with somatic ACE as demonstrated by Erdos and Marcic [19] is impossible in our system. Our radioligand binding curves show no influence of the potentiating peptides on the receptor capacity, indicating that under the test conditions the number of intramembranal receptors was not changed. This result excludes an internalization or reintegration of the receptor under the influence of potentiating peptides.

Our results with the inhibition of Ca 2+ -uptake from extracellular sources by La 3+ indicates that the potentiation of BK-action requires mobilization of Ca 2+ from intracellular stores. On the other hand, in the beginning phase of the BK-evoked GPI contraction extracellular calcium is needed. Thus, our results with La 3+ agree well with the finding of Marcic et al.

These cells constitutively express B 1 as well as B 2 receptors and have a cell specific set of proteases involved in BK degradation. In this system the potentiating nonapeptide BPP 9\u2423 and ramiprilat accelerate the BK-induced migration. In contrast to Ignjatovic et al. [37] , who found on other cells a concentration-dependent direct activation of the B 1 receptor in the absence of kinins, we could not detect any activity of the potentiating nonapeptide without administration of B 1 or B 2 agonists. Though the migratory activity of the proteolytic stabilized BK analogue J725 [16] is potentiated, the action of the nonpeptide agonist FR190997 [4] could not be accelerated by BPP 9\u2423 and ramiprilat. It is difficult to explain this finding. In agreement with the weaker acceleration of the stabilized BK analogue, the effect of the NEP inhibitor phosphoramidon and the concentrationdependent potentiation induced by BPP 9\u2423 , we might suppose that in this test system the potentiation occurs possibly exclusively by inhibition of the enzymatic BK degradation. But, we also have to consider a different mechanism for the peptide and nonpeptide agonist. This assumption is supported in that test by the strongly reduced intrinsic activity of the nonpeptide agonist FR190997 compared to BK itself.",

The observed differences even exceed the different structural requirements for N-and C-terminal catalytic centers of ACE. The experiments with La 3+ gave evidence that the potentiation of smooth muscle contraction requires extracellular Ca 2+ which is taken up through opened channels. The increase of the intracellular level of inositol phosphates, triggered by potentiating peptides, leads to an additional enhancement of the intracellular Ca 2+ concentration. Application of potentiating peptides to COS-7 cells which were transiently transfected with the B 2 receptor and did not contain endogenous ACE, shows no increase in receptor affinity or density.
