            "text": "The eradication of infectious virus from the central nervous system (CNS) following infection with the neurotropic JHM strain of mouse hepatitis virus (JHMV) is thought to be immune-mediated. Furthermore, a significant decrease of infectious virus coincides with the appearance of prominent inflammatory infiltrates in the brain and spinal cord. In the present study, mononuclear cells infiltrating the brain during JHMV infection were isolated and characterized. While all subsets of immune cells were present, there appeared to be a temporal relationship between the peak incidence of CD8 \u00f7 T cells (40% of total isolated cells) and reduction of virus at day 7 post-infection. Cells with the natural killer (NK) phenotype (at least 30%) were also present throughout infection. These data suggest that CD8 \u00f7 T cells and NK cells are prominent among cells which infiltrate the brain during JHM virus infection and may have important roles in reduction of virus within the CNS.",

While re-Following infection with JHMV, viral titers in the CNS increase rapidly, reaching a peak around day 5 post-infection (p.i.) and declining thereafter. Between days 7 and 9, a significant reduction in virus titer is observed and by day 11 when infection is fatal for the majority of the animals, only low numbers or no detectable virus are found (Sussman et al., 1987; Williamson and Stohlman, 1990) . The rapid decline in viral titer after day 5 p.i. coincides with the observation of prominent perivascular cuffs in the parenchyma (Erlich et al., 1989) . This temporal relationship between the amount of virus present and the appearance of infiltrating inflammatory cells in the CNS, suggests that infiltrating cells may play a direct role in reduction of infectious virus. The infiltrate consists of both polymorphonuclear and mononuclear cells which penetrate the parenchyma of both gray and white matter (Erlich et al., 1989) . However, the phenotypes of the mononuclear cells have not been identified.",

The percentage of Thy-1 \u00f7 cells increased with increasing numbers of total infiltrating cells, reached a peak on day 9 and decreased by day 11. However, different patterns of infiltration were observed for the CD4 \u00f7 and CD8 \u00f7 T cell subsets. Both T cell subsets were detectable on day 5 p.i. albeit in small numbers. CD4 \u00f7 cells made up only 6% of the total cells recovered and only 3% were CD8 \u00f7. The percentage of CD4 \u00f7 cells rose gradually during the course of infection and continued to increase on day 11. The percentage of CD8 \u00f7 cells, however, increased dramatically, reaching a peak on day 7 (40% of the total cells) after which a gradual decline was observed. Throughout the course of infection, the majority of the cells infiltrating the brain were ASGM( (greater than 60%). Double-immunofluorescent staining (Fig.  2a) revealed that the majority of the ASGM( cells were of bone-marrow origin (T200 +, ASGM{). Furthermore, Fig. 2b shows that some of the ASGM1 ~ cells also express Mac-1 suggesting the presence of activated macrophages. NK cells (Kasai et al., 1980; Young et al., 1980) , cytotoxic cells (CD8 +) (Stuttles et al., 1986) and activated macrophages (Wiltrout et al., 1985) have been shown to express surface ASGM 1. Since the percentage of ASGM~-cells always exceeded the sums of the percentages of CD8 + and Mac-1 + cells, these results suggest that at least 30% or more of the cells infiltrating the brain during JHMV infection may be NK cells. A large percentage (35%) of the cells present at day 5 appear to be macrophages (Mac-1 +); however, their presence apparently declined with progression of disease. The percentage of B cells (as identified by surface immunoglobulin staining) remained fairly constant throughout the disease (10-15%). The phenotypes of cells present in brains of sham-injected mice are also listed in Table 1 . Since the majority of the cells were Mac-1 + or ASGM~, these data suggest that T lymphocyte infiltration is not a prominent feature following a stab wound lesion in the brain.",

The exact mechanism(s) by which viral replication is kept in control is unknown. That the immune response plays a role is shown by the observations that mice which are immunosuppressed prior to infection, either by irradiation or by specifically depleting host T cells, are unable to clear virus from the CNS. Moreover, the appearance of an inflammatory infiltrate at a time when a significant decrease in replicating virus occurs further suggests that the inflammatory cells may have a role in reducing virus. Hence, the identification of the subpopulations of the cells infiltrating the brain based on their phenotypic and potential functional characteristics may provide information regarding their role(s) in viral clearance in the local CNS environment.",

The importance of the cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response in the CNS is further emphasized by recent observations that both astrocytes (Skias et al., 1987) and oligodendrocytes (Ruijs et al., 1990) are susceptible to cytolysis by class I-restricted lymphocytes.",

While similar numbers of LGL were observed initially in MHVinfected mice, they did not continue to increase or reach the numbers observed following LCMV infection. Since CTL activity within the LGL population following LCMV infection peaked at day 7 p.i., Natuk and Welsh (1987) suggested that the failure to detect an MHV-specific CTL response may be due to the lack of accumulation of MHVspecific CTL/LGL in the injection site. Our finding that a large percentage of cells infiltrating the CNS on day 7 p.i. are CD8 \u00f7 suggests that the CNS may be an area of accumulation of virusspecific CTL following intracerebral infection. At this time the CD4:CD8 ratio of cells recovered from the CNS of infected mice is 0.2-0.6 : 1, which is in contrast to that observed in their cervical lymph nodes (1.4-2:1, data not shown). This suggests that there may be a differential accumulation of CD8 + cells in the brain. It is presently not known what proportion of these may be JHMV-specific cytotoxic cells. CTL infiltration of the CNS has also been observed in mice infected with other neurotropic viruses such as West Nile virus (Liu et al., 1989) and LCMV (Oldstone et al., 1986) . That the differential accumulation of CD8 + cells in the brain resulted from virus infection rather than a non-specific breaching of the blood-brain barrier was further supported by the observation that few CD8 \u00f7 cells were present among the mononuclear cells isolated from shaminjected mice. The fact that Mac-1 + or ASGM~ cells and not lymphocytes (Thy-1 \u00f7, CD4 \u00f7, CD8 \u00f7 or slg +) were prominent in brains of sham-injected mice correlates well with the observation that cells which accumulate around stab wounds of the brain are macrophage/microglia-like cells (Kaur et al., 1987) .",

Since ASGM1 is found in white matter (Kusunoki et al., 1985) , it is possible that some neural cells may express ASGM 1 on their surface. However, the ASGM~-population within the cells we have isolated is clearly of bone marrow origin since ASGM~-cells constitute 70-100% of the T200 \u00f7 cells throughout JHMV infection. This was further confirmed by double-immunofluorescent staining which showed that the majority of ASGM~-cells were indeed also T200 \u00f7. In addition to the finding that cells with the NK phenotype are present among the infiltrates, cytolytic activity against the NK-sensitive YAC-1 target cell was observed.

The present study shows that within 5 days of intracerebral infection, 65% of the infiltrating cells are ASGM~. At this time 35% of the cells are macrophages (Mac-1 +) and only 3% are CD8 \u00f7. Since activated macrophages and some CTL may also be ASGM~-, at least 27% of the mononuclear cells infiltrating the brain at day 5 may be ASGM~-NK cells. In fact, a significant number of ASGM~\" cells (exceeding the sums of CD8 + and Mac-1 \u00f7 cells) and, therefore presumably NK cells are present through JHMV infection. A large percentage of cells bearing the allotypic NK cell marker NKI.1 (Burton et al., 1982; Koo and Peppard, 1984) have also been detected in infected C57BL/6 mice at day 12 p.i. (unpublished observation), further substantiating the finding that cells with the NK phenotype accumulate in the brain during JHMV infection. The presence of cells with NK phenotype and function in brain infiltrates may explain the early transient clearance of virus (prior to day 7 p.i.) in mice which have been depleted of CD4 + or CD8 + cells (Williamson and Stohlman, 1990 ).",
