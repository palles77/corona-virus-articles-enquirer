Advances in in vitro and in silico techniques now allow researchers to examine the intricacies of a virus, especially on a molecular level. Both primary cell cultures and immortalized cell lines derived from animal tissues are commonly used to study a virus' effect on the biology of a cell. However, an intact living organism is required to fully evaluate the interactions between a virus and its host. The innate and acquired immune responses play key roles in the course of a viral infection and can only be studied in an animal model (or a human host). Furthermore, animal models are required for testing therapeutics and evaluating vaccines.",

Even for infections of animals, it is not always feasible to use the natural host, and it may be necessary to use a different species as a model. The model animal should not be expected to identically mimic the disease seen in the subject being modeled, but rather to act as a surrogate in understanding the infection process and clinical disease produced. This information can then be compared to what is observed in the natural host. Because a single animal model may often not be able to duplicate every feature of a virus infection exactly as it would occur in the natural host, different species may be used to study different aspects of pathogenesis. For example, a rhesus macaque may be used to recapitulate the clinical disease seen with a virus that naturally infects humans, while a mouse may be used to study the immune response to virus infection at the cellular level.",

Prior to the 1970s, the rat, hamster, and the guinea pig were the most common animal models used in virus studies. However, with advances in transgenic and knockout technology, mice have quickly become the dominant species used. In 2013, virology publications involving mice outnumbered publications for all other species combined. For many other animal species, full genome sequencing has recently increased the information available for analysis of the host response to virus infection. Also, the use of certain selected species has increased in use in recent years due to their fit as models for particular infections.

Other new methods have also markedly expanded the information obtained from animal experimentation.

There are a wide variety of reagents and tools available for mice, providing researchers with the ability to study almost any aspect of the immune response. In addition, mouse and human species genomes share many similarities, such as the approximate number of protein-coding genes and regions of conserved orthologous sequences. Of particular relevance to studies of pathogenesis, the murine histocompatibility complex is well described, and many aspects of innate, cellular, and humoral immune responses were originally described in mice and subsequently identified in humans. Together, these characteristics have made the mouse the preferred animal for deciphering the host immune response to many virus infections.",

For example, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), the cellular receptor used by the newly emergent Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), is absent in mice. Therefore, a virus native to another species must often be adapted to mice through multiple passages. This technique selects for viruses with mutations that increase virulence, but may also alter pathogenesis. In the case of SARS-CoV, 15 passages of the Urbani strain in young BALB/c mice resulted in a virus (MA15) that is lethal in mice. Aspects of disease seen in severe human cases of SARS were reproduced by MA15 as the result of six coding mutations associated with host adaptation. On the other hand, adaptation of yellow fever virus to mice altered the disease from hepatitis to encephalitis, and the mouse-adapted virus was encephalitogenic (not hepatotropic) in nonhuman primates. Over the last few decades, numerous techniques to alter the mouse genome have been developed. With the sequencing and availability of more than 100 laboratory and wildderived inbred strains of mice, researchers are now able to map genetic loci associated with disease susceptibility and identify quantitative trait loci underlying phenotypic variation. Methods to create knockout and transgenic mice have become increasingly accessible, and mice with spontaneous or engineered mutations are readily available for study. These important advances are described later in this chapter.",

The Andean Incans in Peru originally domesticated the guinea pig to use as a food source and for sacrificial offerings. Dutch fanciers introduced them to Europe in the sixteenth century and bred them to create several colors and hair-coat varieties. They are more docile than smaller rodents, and their relatively low maintenance costs make them preferable to larger, more expensive nonrodent species. Although not as well characterized as the mouse, the guinea pig immune system shares many characteristics with that of humans. Despite this, few molecular and immunologic guinea pig reagents are commercially available, posing a hindrance to their use for viral pathogenesis studies. Possibly the greatest advantage guinea pigs possess is the ability to recapitulate the gross and histologic pathology seen with many human viral diseases. They are most commonly used to study DNA viruses and negative-sense RNA viruses. Guinea pigs are highly susceptible to several arenaviruses and filoviruses and have been used in studying the pathogenesis of human hemorrhagic fevers including those caused by Ebola, Marburg, Junin, and Lassa viruses. These viruses generally replicate to high titers in immune-competent animals, and the clinical disease, hematologic profile, and pathology produced are similar to those observed in humans. Because of this, the guinea pig is a viable model for testing the efficacy of potential therapeutics. Guinea pigs are also popular models for several respiratory pathogens, including respiratory syncytial virus and influenza virus. These animals reproduce many of the characteristics of viral replication and pathology seen in humans and have been used to study aerosol infection and transmission efficiency between individuals.",

In outbred populations, individual animals commonly differ in their responses to virus infection. For example, in pigtail and rhesus macaques, some major histocompatibility complex alleles can present an immunodominant epitope of the SIV Gag protein, leading to lower viral loads than that seen in animals with other alleles. Likewise, the immune response to pathogens and outcomes after infection can differ greatly among inbred mouse strains. For example, mice that have functional Mx1 proteins (e.g., wild Mus spretus mice) are less susceptible to influenza virus infection than those with nonfunctional proteins (e.g., C57BL/6 and BALB/c). Different mouse strains can also have biased immune responses that can affect susceptibility to a virus infection. For example, C57BL/6 mice tend to skew toward a Th1 response whereas other strains, such as BALB/c and DBA/2 mice, tend to have a predominant Th2 response. Therefore, it is essential to use the same strain of mouse in experiments where consistency of a phenotype is important, such as for \"knockout\" and \"knockin\" comparisons.

Dramatized in Richard Preston's The Hot Zone, a quarantined shipment of cynomolgus macaques in Reston, Virginia, created significant concern when it was discovered that the monkeys were infected with a previously unidentified strain of Ebola virus. However, the monkeys were also infected with simian hemorrhagic fever virus, an arterivirus, which exacerbated the disease severity and contributed to their deaths. Coinfection has the potential to markedly affect the immune response to an experimental virus infection. Immunosuppressive viruses, such as simian retrovirus in macaques, can result in an altered immune response to experimental infection and disease from opportunistic secondary infections. Subclinical infection can alter the immune response of immune-competent animals and have an impact on virus studies. A number of natural infections can spread silently in colonies of laboratory mice and affect experimental outcomes. Examples include viruses such as lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, lactate dehydrogenase virus, mouse hepatitis virus, Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus, murine norovirus, and mouse parvovirus, bacteria such as Helicobacter, Pasteurella, and Staphylococcus species, and parasites such as pinworms and fur mites. Many commercial vendors sell and animal facilities maintain \"specific-pathogen free\" animals, and sentinel programs monitor resident colonies for subclinical infections and infestations.",

Vaccines produced each year for seasonal influenza reduce morbidity and mortality, but are far from optimal. With the emergence of new strains with pandemic potential, such as H1N1, H5N1, and H7N9, animal models are needed to investigate pathogenesis and immune responses and to develop new vaccines. Waterfowl are the natural reservoir for influenza A virus, and certain avian strains can infect several mammalian species, including pigs, dogs, horses, and ferrets. Of increasing public health concern is the transmission of highly pathogenic influenza strains from birds to humans. Host restriction is highly dependent on the linkage of the sialic acid (SA) receptors found on respiratory cells. Like humans, ferrets and nonhuman primates have both \u03b12,6-and \u03b12,3-linked sialic acid receptors in the lower respiratory tract, but only \u03b12,6-linked SA receptors in the upper respiratory tract. In contrast, birds and mice predominantly have \u03b12,3-linked sialic acid receptors throughout the respiratory tract. Avian influenza isolates preferentially use \u03b12,3-linked receptors, whereas mammalian isolates use \u03b12,6-linked receptors. If there is a mutation in the receptor-binding site of an avian isolate, it could potentially jump species and infect mammals. If such a strain of influenza virus to which humans have no preexisting immunity crosses the species barrier, there is the potential for a pandemic, such as occurred in 1918.",

The Jackson Laboratory in Maine, one of the largest suppliers of mice in the United States, currently has over 200 inbred mouse strains available. Most strains also have multiple substrains due to the distribution of parent strains to different researchers and vendors. They in turn established their own colonies, eventually resulting in genetic divergence from the progenitor strain.

This timeline has been significantly decreased with the advent of more advanced genetic screening technology. While ten generations of backcrossing are traditionally required to create a congenic mouse, the use of speed congenics has reduced this timeline to as little as five generations. This process uses microsatellite markers or single nucleotide polymorphisms to select for progeny that not only possess the desired genetic manipulation, but also the greatest amount of genetic information from the desired background strain. Advances in DNA sequencing technology and computational analysis have further decreased the amount of time and labor required to produce genetically manipulated mice. New developments in mouse genetics are constantly being published, and as these technologies are fully validated and optimized, the availability of genetically manipulated mice to better study viral pathogenesis will further improve.",

However, different species sometimes more appropriately model the observed disease, such as common marmosets for the coronavirus-induced Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), or Syrian hamsters for hantavirus pulmonary syndrome induced by Sin Nombre virus. Because many emerging viruses must be studied at high containment levels, such as BSL-3 or BSL-4, it is often desirable to use smaller animal species that are easier to house and handle. More often than not, emerging viruses are zoonotic, with one or more animal species acting as a reservoir. Examples include passerine birds for West Nile virus, field mice or rats for the hantaviruses, pteropid fruit bats (flying foxes) for the henipaviruses, and camels for MERS-CoV. These animals act as long-term carriers and transmitters of the virus and generally do not develop disease. However, it is informative to understand how the virus establishes persistence or latency in the reservoir species while facilitating virus shedding or transmission.",

The poliomyelitis vaccine was developed as a result of 40 years of research using nonhuman primates. Where species-specificity prevented use of an animal model for vaccine development, such as human papillomavirus, related animal viruses were used as surrogates. In this case, viruslike particle vaccines containing papillomavirus L1 capsid protein were tested in rabbits, cattle, and dogs infected with species-specific papillomaviruses before starting clinical trials in humans.",

Ferrets are an important experimental host for pathogenesis studies of influenza, in part because they respond to influenza type A virus infection in a manner similar to humans. In addition, ferrets differ from mice and many other experimental animals because they have the same distribution of sialic acid receptors as do humans, with \u03b1-2,6-linked receptors in the upper respiratory tract and \u03b1-2,3-linked receptors in the lower respiratory tract. In the experiment illustrated above, a human isolate of influenza type A H5N1 viruses was genetically modified to introduce mutations that would change its receptor preference from \u03b1-2,3 to \u03b1-2,6 sialic acid receptors. Both wild-type and genetically modified strains were passaged in ferrets 10 times, to determine if they could be adapted to spread by aerosol from animal to animal. The modified (but not the wild-type strain) was aerosol-transmissible after passaging in ferrets. Redrawn after Herfst et al. (2012).",
