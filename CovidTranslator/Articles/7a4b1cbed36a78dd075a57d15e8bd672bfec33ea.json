We introduce a novel mechanical ventilator (Mechanical Ventilator Milano, MVM), inspired by the Manley ventilator [11] . In 1961, Roger Manley \"suggested the possibility of using the pressure of the gases from the anaesthetic machine as the motive power for a simple apparatus to ventilate the lungs of the patients in the operating theatre\" [12] . We have tried to design the MVM with the same principle of simplicity in mind. The main difference is the use of electricallydriven pneumatic valves instead of mechanical switches to ease large scale production. The MVM does not include a system to measure the tidal volume provided to the patient with each breathing cycle, but rather a system to mea-sure the peak and average expiratory flow rate. The MVM adheres as much as possible to the guidelines for \"Rapidly Manufactured Ventilator System (RMVS)\" [13] recently released by the UK Medicine & Healthcare products Regulatory Agency.",

Pressure regulation of the end-expiratory cycle is achieved by discharging the expiratory flow in a simple vent trap, which sets the desired minimum expiratory pressure precisely at 5 mbarg/cm H 2 O. Another vent trap connected to the line delivering oxygen to the patient ensures that the maximum pressure delivered does not exceed 30 mbarg.

The parts selected are also characterized by their ease of mass-scale manufacturing; Ease of Construction: assembly of the parts into a complete MVM can be completed with a set of limited and clear instructions. The process for loading the software into the controller is simple. The controller software is open source and available for customizations by end users; Cost Containment: the total cost of components is a few hundreds of e 's. Ease of Deployment: the only required facilities are a line of pressurized oxygen and standard AC electric power (either 220 V or 110 V). The MVM can be deployed wherever a source of pressurized oxygen can be made available. It is suitable for home care and for use in ambulances. It is convenient to deploy in care clinics with centralized oxygen supply systems, such as COVID hospitals or COVID-care areas in general hospitals; Customizability: the MVM can operate in different configurations (independent and patient assisted) as described in Section 3. The operating parameters can be tuned by the operator with a simple user interface; Scalability: the MVM control system is based an a WiFi micro-controller which allows to monitor and tune the parameters of multiple units with a single work station; Reliability: all the components in this units are commercial and readily available. The reliability of MVM has to be carefully studied based on the specifications of the components.",

We have verified that an orifice with diameter of 6 mm is sufficient to guarantee that a proper respiratory minute volume is delivered to the patient; Humidifier OTH1: the incoming oxygen flow is humidified before reaching the patient by entering the oxygen therapy humidifier OTH1; Vent trap VT1: vent trap VT1 is filled with a vertical column of oil, which raises the minimum vent pressure to a value of approximately 30 mbarg. The value of the minimum vent pressure can be easily adjusted in the neighborhood of 30 mbarg by varying the oil level or by adjusting the vertical position of the tube reaching below the oil surface. The vent line connects directly to the atmosphere, guaranteeing that the pressure differential delivered to the patient does not exceed the preset minimum vent pressure of VT1; Nasal or oronasal mask: from OTH1, the incoming humidified oxygen flow is delivered to the patient outfitted with a non-vented NIV mask. Breathing system: the NIV mask is connected to a breathing system, supporting the attachment of two plastic tubes of typical size 22 mm connecting respectively to pneumatic valves PV1 and PV2, and to a smaller plastic tube leading to pressure sensor PS1. The standard for connection of the breathing system is the 22 mm cone and socket combination defined in the publication \"ISO 5356-1:2015 -Anaes-thetic and respiratory equipment -Conical connectors -Part 1: Cones and sockets\" [16] . Oxygen line: the oxygen line from OTH1 to the patient is branched into a line connected to vent trap VT1; Expiration pneumatic valve PV2: PV2 controls the expiratory flow. As for PV1, a valve orifice with diameter of 6 mm is sufficient to guarantee the flow corresponding to the expiration of a proper respiratory minute volume; Vent trap VT2: vent trap VT2 is filled with a vertical column of liquid, which raises the minimum vent pressure to the value of 5 mbarg; Spirometer SP1: a portable digital spirometer can be connected to the vent line of vent trap VT2 to monitor the peak and average expiratory flow rate. We are also investigating the possibility to integrate the spirometer in the main control unit, shifting its installation point so that it is directly connected to the downstream port of PV2; Note on VT1 and VT2: both those liquid based vent traps act as adjustable pressure relief valves where the pressure level can be monitored. They could be replaced by mechanical pressure relief valves set at fixed values of 30 and 5 mbarg respectively. They are very compact objects available on the market, the only drawback being the pressure in the ventilation line cannot be monitored.",
