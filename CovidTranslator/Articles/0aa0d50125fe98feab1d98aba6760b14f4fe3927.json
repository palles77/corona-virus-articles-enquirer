            "text": "Bovine herpesvirus 5 (BHV5) infection of young cattle is frequently associated with fatal neurological disease and, as such, represents an attractive model for studying the pathogenesis of viral-induced meningoencephalitis. Following replication in the nasal mucosa, BHV5 invades the central nervous system (CNS) mainly through the olfactory pathway. The innate immune response triggered by the host face to virus replication through the olfactory route is poorly understood. Recently, an upregulation of conserved pathogenassociated molecular pattern, as Toll-like receptors (TLRs), has been demonstrated in the CNS of BHV5 experimentally infected cows. A new perspective to understand hostpathogen interactions has emerged elucidating microRNAs (miRNAs) network that interact with innate immune response during neurotropic viral infections. In this study, we demonstrated a link between the expression of TLRs 3, 7, and 9 and miR-155 transcription in the olfactory bulbs (OB) of 16 cows suffering from acute BHV5-induced neurological disease. The OBs were analyzed for viral antigens and genome, miR-155 and TLR 3, 7, and 9 expression considering three major regions: olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs), glomerular layer (GL), and mitral cell layer (ML). BHV5 antigens and viral genomes, corresponding to glycol-C gene, were detected in all OBs regions by fluorescent antibody assay (FA) and PCR, respectively. TLR 3, 7, and 9 transcripts were upregulated in ORNs and ML, yet only ORN layers revealed a positive correlation between TLR3 and miR-155 transcription. In ML, miR-155 correlated positively with all TLRs studied. Herein, our results evidence miR-155 transcription in BHV5 infected OB tissue associated to TLRs expression specifically ORNs which may be a new window for further studies.",

BHV5 is a neurotropic virus that produces neurological disease mainly in young animals worldwide, especially in South American countries (Vogel et al. 2003) . Following primary replication in the nasal mucosa, BHV5 is believed to invade the central nervous system (CNS) mainly through the olfactory route (Vogel et al. 2003; Mori et al. 2004; Perez et al. 2006) . The olfactory mucosa is composed by a neuroepithelium divided into layers organized initially by nasal mucosa, olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs), glomerular layer (GL), cribriforme plate, mitral cell layer (ML), and limbic system (Mori et al. 2004 ). The olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) are bipolar neuronal cells whose axons leave the epithelium, penetrate the cribriform plate, enter the olfactory bulb and, finally, make synapse with the dendrites of mitral cells in the glomerular layer (Mori et al. 2004; Shivkumar et al. 2013) . Mitral cells project to the olfactory and limbic systems, mainly the olfactory cortex and hippocampus, respectively (Mori et al. 2004; van Riel et al. 2015) . During acute infection, BHV5 gains access mostly to the CNS cranial areas, indicating that viral invasion occurs more directly along olfactory neurons (Chowdhury et al. 1997; Favier et al. 2014) . Despite evidences indicating that BHV5 uses the olfactory pathway to invade the CNS, detailed information on the sequential progression of the virus-and the host-mediated immune events-through the OB layers is lacking.",

Cattle experimentally infected with BHV5 showed an overexpression of TLRs 3, 7, and 9 in the frontal cerebral cortex, including the OBs, during acute infection and/or following virus reactivation (Marin et al. 2015) . We have previously demonstrated that the host immune response and inflammation play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of acute encephalitis by BHV5 in cattle (Cardoso et al. 2016b) . In many aspects, there is a consensus that BHV5 acute infection induces activation of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines that eventually lead to brain injury, especially in frontal cortices (Marin et al. 2015) . However, the portion/areas of the OBs more affected by inflammation process remain unclear.",

Mature miRNAs are able to cause either mRNA degradation or translational repression regulating physiological process by target genes after their transcription (Glazov et al. 2009 ). Moreover, host miRNAs control herpesvirus infection by inhibiting viral or host transcripts (Piedade and Azevedo-Pereira 2016; Powdrill et al. 2016; Dickey et al. 2017) . Recent data indicate that miR-155 plays a critical role in immunity, inflammation, and viral infections (Bhela et al. 2014; Dickey et al. 2016) . Moreover, miR-155 is expressed in a variety of immune cells, including B cells, macrophages, types of T cells, NK cells, and dendritic cells Dickey et al. 2017 ). In addition, miR-155 modulation may act to control Japanese encephalitis virus infection (Pareek et al. 2004) and to enhance T cell trafficking in a model of coronavirus-induced neurological disease (Dickey et al. 2016) . In fact, a number of studies have demonstrated that T cell responses are impaired in the absence of miR-155 during infection with some neurotropic viruses (Bhela et al. 2014; Bhela et al. 2015; Dickey et al. 2016; Dickey et al. 2017) . Recently, induction of miR-155 was associated to HSV1 acute encephalitis in a mouse model (Majer et al. 2017 ). Considering the finding described for HSV1 encephalitis (Shivkumar et al. 2013; Bhela et al. 2014; Grey 2015; Sorel and Dewals 2016; Majer et al. 2017) , it would be worth to investigate miRNA expression in the CNS during BHV5 infection.",

            "text": "Toll-like receptors (TLRs) play an important role in host defense against pathogens, including viruses. Among these, TLR3, TLR7, and TLR9 are involved in antiviral responses through cytokine activation, such as the type-I IFNs (Xagorari and Chlichlia 2008) . Studies focusing on the interaction between BHV5 and TLRs in the CNS are scarce (Marin et al. 2015) . The results presented in the present study provide new information on the regulation of TLR3, TLR7, and TLR9 in ORNs, GL, and ML of OBs by association of their expression with miR-155 transcription. Taken together, these data indicate that BHV5 infection may result in a differential expression of TLRs in neural tissues. Basically, TLR3 showed correlation with miR-155 transcription in ORNs, and all studied TLRs were positively correlated with miR-155 transcription in ML.",

The olfactory neuroepithelium consists of a limited number of cell types, including ORN (Winkler et al. 2015) . The course of neurotropic virus infection may include a latent phase in the OBs and neuroepithelium, representing potential for virus reactivation (Mori et al. 2004) . For example, HSV1 established latent infection in the murine OBs after experimental infection (Shivkumar et al. 2013) and Equine herpesvirus type 1 (EHV1) remained latent in mitral cells after experimental infection of mice (Mori et al. 2004) . Moreover, after experimental inoculation of rabbits, BHV5 is transported retrogradely from the nasal cavity and may be found in the OBs and limbic system (Ludlow et al. 2016 ). These findings are in agreement, to what has been described in the present study. Nonetheless, Fig. 2 Analysis of negative samples showed OBs, divided into a ORNs, b GL, and c ML stained with N200 monoclonal antibody whereas OEolfactory epithelium, olfactory receptor neurons, and GL-glomerular layer are represented, respectively.

Moreover, defects in TLR3interferon (IFN) and IFN-responsive pathways were shown to facilitate HSV encephalitis (Verma and Bharti 2017) . Therefore, TLR3-mediate immune response in CNS infection should be considered an important pathway to control neuroinvasion (Verma and Bharti 2017) . In addition, capillaries in the OBs were shown to be susceptible to virusinduced vascular leak and to facilitate neuroinvasion (Winkler et al. 2015) . Recently, a novel role for miR-155 in host defense in a model of viral-induced encephalomyelitis has been supported, by enhancing antiviral T cell responses including cytokine secretion, cytolytic activity, and homing to the CNS in response to coronavirus infection (Dickey et al. 2016 ). In conclusion, miR-155 may play either a host-protective or damaging role during neuroinflammation, depending on the disease trigger (Pareek et al. 2004 ). Interestingly, BHV5 has been shown to encode different microRNAs when compared with BHV1, which could help to explain the differences in cell/tissue tropism (Tang Qi et al. 2014) . Taking our results together, we can speculate that ORNs could be the target cells for BHV5 neuroinvasion during natural infections. In, the HSV1 system, it was established a possible link between miR-155 overexpression and susceptibility of the CNS to virus infection (Bhela et al. 2014) in accordance to what has been proposed in the present study. In addition, induction of miR-155 has been recently associated with HSV 1 acute encephalitis in a mouse model (Majer et al. 2017) .",
