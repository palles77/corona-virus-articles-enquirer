In each of these countries, nonrandomized comparative clinical trials were initiated. The Ebola-Tx trial in Conakry, Guinea, enrolled 102 patients by 7 July 2015; no severe adverse reactions were noted. The Ebola-CP trial in Sierra Leone and the EVD001 trial in Liberia have included few patients. Although no efficacy data are available yet, current field experience supports the safety, acceptability, and feasibility of CP as EVD treatment. Longer-term follow-up as well as data from nontrial settings and evidence on the scalability of the intervention are required. CP sourced from within the outbreak is the most readily available source of anti-EVD antibodies. Until the advent of effective antivirals or monoclonal antibodies, CP merits further evaluation.",

During EVD outbreaks, both are local and readily available sources of anti-EVD antibodies. Blood transfusion is routinely done in all 3 high-transmission countries involved in the current EVD outbreak; however, plasma has numerous advantages in these settings. Using apheresis, a single donor can give substantially more CP, up to 10 mL/kg every 2 weeks, compared with 1 unit of 450 mL whole blood (approximately 250 mL plasma) every 3-4 months for CWB; hence, more patients can be treated. CP can be given intravenously over a much shorter time period (30 minutes vs 3-4 hours) and hence is less demanding for healthcare teams in Ebola treatment centers. The pathogen inactivation step during CP production increases the safety of the intervention. CP transfusion is also safer with fewer transfusion reactions; CP needs to be ABO compatible, but there is no need for bedside cross-matching [13] . Additionally, CP can be stored for much longer periods.",

The design that would provide the best evaluation would be a randomized trial in which one or other intervention would be compared with control patients not receiving the intervention. However, such randomized designs have proved unacceptable in the volatile settings of the current Ebola outbreak, and researchers have at the early stages resorted to nonrandomized study designs [29] . All CP trials were designed to include concurrent control patients. For example, in the Ebola-Tx trial, controls were to be patients presenting when no ABO-compatible plasma was available. However, when the trial started, the supply of CP increased significantly and the number of patients decreased, resulting in sufficient supply of CP to treat nearly all patients. Consequently, it will compare the mortality of treated patients with that of historical controls, with the inherent possibility of biased comparisons. Key concerns in all trials regarded potential confounding factors including variations in patient characteristics, Ebola virulence on presentation, and differences in standards of supportive care over time. For example, the systematic placement of intravenous access lines in patients for CP treatment could encourage more aggressive intravenous hydration during the trial period. How easy it will be to interpret the results of the trials will depend, to a large extent, on the size of the mortality reduction, if any, associated with the intervention.",

This can potentially increase the risks of adverse reactions due to preanalytical, analytical, or postanalytical errors. These errors could potentially lead to severe reactions if ABO-incompatible plasma with high titers of hemolysins were administered. The ability to monitor patients for and to react to severe, acute adverse reactions is clearly limited by the environment of many Ebola treatment centers.

In consideration of the study design limitations described in this article, these trials may not yield definitive data on the extent to which such treatment reduces case fatality rates. However, it is expected that they will, at minimum, provide some indication of the utility of CP and the challenges in delivering such treatment, in future trials. Additional research on CP, hyperimmune globulins, and monoclonal antibodies in animal and clinical studies is required to identify the optimal treatment regimen and better understand the mechanism of action.",

In each new outbreak, available hyperimmune globulins or monoclonal antibodies will first have to be evaluated against the causative strain and possibly followed by the production of a new product, all of which takes time. Until the advent of potent, safe, affordable, and effective antivirals, and the development of effective vaccines, the use of convalescent blood products should remain part of the potential response to EVD.",
