[7] [8] [9] [10] Infection transmission between COVID-19 patients and healthcare workers has also been documented. 11 Given the current status of the COVID-19 outbreak, the US Surgeon General, 12 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 13 American College of Surgeons (ACS), 14 American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA), and Anesthesia Patient Safety Foundation (APSF) 15 have recommended considering rescheduling or postponing some elective surgeries with the goal of conserving limited resources, such as ventilators and ICU beds, and mitigating the risk of \"exposing other inpatients, outpatients, and health care providers to the risk of contracting COVID-19\" from asymptomatic but infectious patients. 14 However, the American Hospital Association, the Federation of American Hospitals, the Association of American Medical Colleges, and the Children's Hospital Association have written a joint letter opposing the surgeon general's advice. 12 Multiple hospitals, including several major hospital systems in WA, are canceling or postponing elective surgery procedures, 16, 17 but there are other hospitals that have declared they will proceed with elective cases. 18 The goal of this study is to provide a quantitative analysis and model for preventable COVID-19 infections from elective outpatient or ambulatory surgery cases. Our model can also be adapted to analyze COVID-19 transmission in other healthcare settings. Furthermore, given the controversy over the appropriate handling of elective surgical cases during this pandemic, we hope that our results may have a positive impact on health policy and public health. Given much of the uncertainty regarding the pathophysiology and epidemiology of COVID-19, and the potential policy implications of our results, we chose to focus on lower bounds for preventable infections instead of upper bounds.",

We derived this number for two reasons: 1. The number of clinical staff involved specifically in perioperative care for outpatient elective surgeries is unavailable and 2. Given the current state of the pandemic, institutions may attempt to minimize the numbers of non-essential staff involved in the care of each patient in order to reduce the risks of COVID-19 transmission. At minimum, each patient must interact with 4.5 HCW: one anesthesiologist, one surgeon or proceduralist, one circulator, one scrub technician, and 0.5 pre-operative / Post-Anesthesia Care Unit (PACU) nurses for both pre-op and post-op care, since the PACU nursing ratio is usually 1 nurse to 2 patients and the same nurse can care for a patient during pre-op and post-op. Note that the actual number of HCW that patients will interact with can often be higher. The number of patients that each set of perioperative staff works with varies depending on the length of surgery and scheduling preferences. Based on the clinical experiences of one of our authors, we will use the assumption that each HCW is responsible for an average of 5 cases or 5 unique patients. Thus, we came up with the ratio of 4.5 HCW / 5 patients, or 0.9 HCW/patient. Given our estimate of 3047 ambulatory surgery patients per day, this approximates 2742 HCWs involved in ambulatory surgery care per day.",

Due to the incubation period of the virus, 6 coupled with the current resource limitations in the US, COVID-19 infections will not be detected until symptoms become evident. To estimate the asymptomatic infected population, we looked at confirmed COVID-19 cases and back-calculated the population count that would have likely been in the pre-symptomatic incubation phase on previous dates. Based on recently published studies, the average incubation period of COVID-19 is around 5 to 6 days. [23] [24] [25] For this model, we used the shorter incubation period of 5 days, meaning that symptoms begin on day 5.

Using data for Washington through March 17, 2020, we were able to calculate that there were at least 447 asymptomatic cases on March 13, 2020. However, this likely underestimates the actual prevalence of asymptomatic cases because this only includes the infected individuals that eventually tested positive, excluding those who ultimately never developed symptoms or only developed mild symptoms, those who developed severe symptoms but were never tested, and those who were tested but had a false negative result. Furthermore, the number of COVID-19 infections in the US and in WA have been steadily increasing over time. 2, 3 News reports that the virus is thought to have been circulating within communities for weeks prior to the outbreak also support the idea that this number underestimates the actual prevalence of asymptomatic cases. 26 Next, we needed to determine the ratio of asymptomatic uninfected people to uninfected people in the general population. We subtracted the confirmed infections on March 13, 2020 and the asymptomatic infected population on that day from the total population of WA in order to determine the uninfected population.",

Thus we multiplied our ratio with 3047 total patients per day and 2742 total HCW to arrive at the initial values of 0.18 asymptomatic infected patients per day, 3046.82 uninfected patients per day, 0.16 asymptomatic infected HCW, and 2741.84 uninfected HCW. Asymptomatic infected HCW were further subdivided into groups based on how long they had been infected. Because asymptomatic COVID19+ individuals would remain in the workforce, we included infected HCW in the perioperative workforce for days 1-4 of their infections (during which time they could also infect other HCW and patients), and then removed them from the workforce once they reached day 5 and displayed symptoms. For our initial conditions, we divided asymptomatic infected HCW evenly into .

Since we are interested in the total infection spread, data for some known infected population, both symptomatic and asymptomatic, is required. For this, we used data extracted from the Diamond Princess cruise ship, 27 since the close quarters approximate the perioperative setting. Due to the isolated nature of the ship, health officials were able to test everyone onboard the cruise ship, even if there are no symptoms evident. Using the data at hand and the equation above, we can readily determine the transmission constant by dividing the number of new cases at time t + 1 (with time measured in days) by the product of infected population at time t and the uninfected population at time t, which we calculated to be an average of k = 1.219e-4.",

However, looking at the rapid growth of COVID19+ cases in the US, from 1 case on Feb. 29, 2020 to 4661 confirmed cases just 17 days later, 2 it nevertheless should be noted that any mitigation should be implemented given the infectious nature of the virus.",
