Given the success of this meeting, a second meeting was organised, now called 'Emerging Viruses of Zoonotic and Veterinary Importance', at Churchill College, Cambridge, UK, on 24-26 July 2017 to encourage discussion of emerging virus infections from a One Health perspective.",

            "text": "Infectious disease not only affects human health, but has an impact on the stability of food production and the survival of wild species. This is formulated in the One Health approach to infectious disease, where the possibility of infectious agent movement between species, including human beings, is key. Whilst a major driver of emerging virus disease research is public health concern over zoonotic infections, there are also veterinary drivers for emerging viral diseases. Such diseases may have devastating effects on wildlife populations, affecting the ability of these populations to withstand the global environmental changes we are causing. They may be diseases of production animals, affecting food production efficiency and the ability to trade. Finally, they may affect domestic pet animals, causing welfare issues and increased costs to owners. The articles in this special issue of The Veterinary Journal reflect some of the content of the meeting. 1 There is an increasing focus on emerging diseases fuelled by the human Ebola virus epidemic and Zika virus emergence. These reflect a more public face of disease spread than is seen in the veterinary world. Recent intrusions of notifiable viral diseases of veterinary species into Europe and Russia include lumpy skin disease, peste des petits ruminants, bluetongue, avian influenza and Newcastle disease.",

The continued surveillance of wildlife (Bodewes, 2018) and domestic animals, including livestock (Bourret, 2018) and companion animals (Caddy, 2018), to identify novel viruses is particularly important in understanding the sources and risks of viruses affecting the health of animals and humans. A greater understanding of virus replication, pathogenesis and transmission allows intervention strategies to be formulated, including development of vaccines and antiviral treatments. Understanding of replication of Zika virus is exemplified by the paper by Royle et al. (2017) , whilst the review by Pusterla et al. (2018) summarises what is known about a novel coronavirus of horses.",

These types of drivers are discussed in the review by Heffernan (2018) , whilst the potential for spill-over between different hosts is highlighted in the systematic literature search by Glennon et al.
