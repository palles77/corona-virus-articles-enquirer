            "text": "Bovine respiratory disease (BRD) is responsible for the majority of morbidity, mortality, and production losses occurring in feedlots. This experiment evaluated the effects of BRD incidence on subsequent finishing performance, efficiency, carcass characteristics, and lung scores of steers. Crossbred steers (n = 516) were monitored daily for clinical signs of BRD (BRD attributed morbidity and mortality were 66.5 and 13.2%, respectively). A subset of calves (n = 174) were grouped by the number of times treated for BRD (BRDX) and randomly allocated to finishing pens. The BRDX experimental groups included never treated for BRD (0X; 8 pens) and treated 1 time (1X; 8 pens), 2 times (2X; 8 pens), or 3 or 4 times (3/4X; 8 pens). Arrival BW was not different among BRDX groups (P = 0.17); however, BRDX during the receiving period decreased performance, resulting in BW of 324, 316, 285, and 260 kg for 0X, 1X, 2X, and 3/4X, respectively, at the start of finishing (P < 0.001). Ultrasound estimates, BW, and visual appraisal were used to target a common body composition (average days on feed = 182). With increasing BRDX, days on feed increased linearly (P = 0.002), whereas HCW, DP, rib eye area, QG, and unconsolidated lungs decreased linearly (P \u2264 0.03). These results suggest that with additional days on feed, calves treated multiple times for BRD are able to reach similar compositional endpoints as their untreated cohorts; however, it may not be possible for these calves to reach the same QG and carcass yield.",

            "text": "Bovine respiratory disease (BRD) is a complex illness and a multitude of stressors, viruses, and bacterial pathogens can potentially contribute to its onset (Duff and Galyean, 2007) . Development of clinical BRD frequently occurs via a primary infection with one or more respiratory viruses. The initial viral infection combined with a compromised immune system then allows for the rapid colonization of bacteria within the lungs (Hodgins et al., 2002) . The BRD complex accounts for the majority of morbidity, mortality, decreased production, and economic losses in feedlots. Woolums et al. (2005) implicated BRD as the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in 561 feedlots in 21 states. Morbidity attributed to BRD can account for approximately 75% of total morbidity, and mortality attributed to BRD accounts for 36 to 80% of total mortality in feedlot cattle (Vogel and Parrott, 1994; Edwards, 1996; Smith, 1998; Chirase and Greene, 2001) . In a 2011 survey, NAHMS (2013) stated almost all feedlots (96.9%) had cattle that were affected by BRD and that BRD was the most common illness in feedlots, affecting 16.2% of cattle placed on feed. Economic losses from BRD result from antimicrobial treatments, increased labor, mortalities, chronic BRD cases, and decreased performance of calves treated for BRD. Powell (2013) estimated annual economic losses resulting from BRD to be in excess of $2 billion.",

Calves were purchased over the course of 1 wk in September at livestock auctions throughout Oklahoma and transported (average distance = 135 km) to the Willard Sparks Beef Research Center (WSBRC) at Oklahoma State University. Upon arrival at the feed yard, calves were individually weighed and a uniquely numbered ear tag was placed in the left ear of each calf. Calves were given ad libitum access to prairie hay and water, and allowed to rest 24 to 48 h before initial processing. Initial processing consisted of vaccination for infectious bovine rhinotracheitis virus, bovine viral diarrhea virus types 1 and 2, parainfluenza 3 virus, and bovine respiratory syncytial virus; vaccination for Clostridium chauvoei, Clostridium septicum, Clostridium novyi, Clostridium sordellii, and Clostridium perfringens types C and D; and treatment for the control of internal and external parasites (Ivomec Plus; Merial, Duluth, GA). Bulls (n = 355) were surgically castrated by incising the scrotum with a Newberry castrating knife followed by emasculation by a single individual, and calves with horns (n = 57) had their horns tipped with a Keystone dehorner.",

The remaining 48 steers never met antimicrobial treatment criteria for BRD, never received an antimicrobial, and thus were not allocated to the ANC receiving experiment. These untreated calves were fed, housed, and managed identically to those calves on the ANC receiving experiment. For this experiment, calves were grouped by previous experimental ANC and the number of times treated for BRD (BRDX) and then randomly allocated to finishing pens so that only a single ANC and BRDX were represented within a pen. This was done to allow for the analysis of interactions between BRDX and previous ANC experimental treatments. Calves selected for this experiment were representative of the initial experimental population and were subsampled from the experimental population based on BW.

A clinically normal appearing calf was assigned a severity score of 0, whereas a 1 was assigned to a calf with mild clinical signs, a 2 would have been assigned to a calf with moderate clinical signs, a 3 was assigned to a calf with severe clinical signs, and 4 was assigned to a moribund calf. For a calf to be assigned a score of 4, the calf had to be unable to rise; require assistance to rise; or have extreme difficulty standing, walking, or breathing.

All continuous animal performance and carcass characteristic data were analyzed using the MIXED procedure of SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC) with pen serving as the experimental unit. Nonparametric carcass data, liver scores, and lung consolidation and adhesion scores were analyzed as binomially distributed data using the GLIMMIX procedure of SAS with the mixed model notated above. Before analysis for the main effect of BRDX, analysis for the interaction of BRDX and previous ANC experimental treatment was completed. Any interactions that existed between BRDX and previous ANC are notated in Tables 3, 4, and 5. Only 3 significant interactions were observed for all of the variables analyzed. Orthogonal contrasts were then performed for the linear and quadratic effects of BRDX. Contrasts were not considered unless the overall model was significant (P \u2264 0.05) or tended to be significant (0.05 < P \u2264 0.10). Data were analyzed with mortalities (4; 3 digestive and 1 BRD) included in the analysis (deads in). One calf from the 2X group and 3 calves from the 3/4X group died during the experiment. Because of circumstances beyond our control, the calves slaughtered at 197 DOF experienced a longer chill time at the packing facility before grading. Due to calves being slaughtered at varying DOF and there being a difference in chill time before grading between the slaughter groups, Lung consolidation: 0 = clinically normal, healthy lung with <5% consolidation of lung tissue; 1 = \u00b15% consolidation of lung tissue or mycoplasma-like lesion; 2 = >5% but <50% consolidation of lung tissue, missing lung, or mycoplasma-like lesion; 3 = >50% consolidation of lung tissue, missing lung, or mycoplasma-like lesion. 5 Lung adhesion: 0 = clinically normal, healthy lung; 1 = minor threadlike fibrous adhesion; 2 = extensive fibrous adhesion. slaughter group was included in the model statement for the analysis of carcass quality parameters.",

This base carcass price was then adjusted for any individual yield and quality premiums or discounts (Table 6 ) based on the carcass data parameters and then multiplied by the individual HCW for each animal to calculate an individual carcass value for each calf. This carcass value represents the actual price paid for each individual calf at the time of slaughter. After carcass values were calculated for each BRDX group, the actual cost of antimicrobials used in the experiment was subtracted from each respective BRDX group. For 3/4X, the average costs of 3 and 4 antimicrobial treatments was used. Next additional labor and other expenses were accounted for at an assumed cost of $7.25 per antimicrobial administered. Yardage was then adjusted based on actual DOF for a pen and a yardage cost of $0.40/steer per d. Finally, feed cost was also adjusted based on actual DMI for a pen and a diet cost of $33.27 per 100 kg ($301.85 per ton) on a DM basis. These adjustments resulted in a total calf value (Table 7) . Total calf value was determined as the carcass value adjusted for actual costs resulting from BRD treatment including the purchase price of antimicrobials, increased labor costs associated with treatment and care, adjustments in yardage costs based on variations in DOF, and adjustments in feed costs based on variations in DOF and DMI.",

Obviously, this cannot be accomplished by feeding all calves to equal DOF, so our second objective was to attempt to slaughter each pen of calves at a common compositional endpoint. Our target was to slaughter all pens when calves within that pen reached a 12th-rib fat thickness of 1.27 cm regardless of DOF. Because of the desired collection of carcass data and lung scores at slaughter combined with the distance to the slaughter facility from WSBRC, logistical concerns compelled us to slaughter calves in as few slaughter groups as possible while maintaining our goal to slaughter all calves at a common compositional endpoint. By using a combination of ultrasound estimates, BW projections, and visual appraisal, we were able to project an ideal individual slaughter date for each pen. After this was accomplished, pens were fairly easily separated into early and late slaughter groups by their individual predicted slaughter dates and all pens were able to be slaughtered in 2 groups (DOF = 166 or 197). By allowing DOF to fluctuate, all BRDX groups were slaughtered between 1.28 and 1.40 cm of 12th-rib fat.",

However, when contrasting 3X heifers with chronically ill heifers, there was a significant decrease in final BW for chronically ill heifers (Holland et al., 2010) . The differing results observed in the final BW of these 2 experiments could simply be the result of how the BRDX groups were structured for those calves receiving 3 or more antimicrobial treatments that suffered from an extreme BRD challenge. Thomson et al. (2012) also reported no differences in final BW even though steers treated 2 or more times for BRD weighed 20 kg less than untreated steers. Roeber et al. (2001) and Waggoner et al. (2007) evaluated animals in 2 separate Ranch to Rail programs where animals were also slaughtered on a market-ready basis. Similar to the findings of Holland et al. (2010) , final BW was not different among animals administered varying antimicrobial treatments in the 2 Ranch to Rail programs. However, Roeber et al. (2001) and Waggoner et al. (2007) both found a numerical decrease (8 and 18 kg, respectively) in final BW for calves requiring 2 or more antimicrobial treatments. In a review of individual carcass characteristics of 33,073 steers fed in commercial pens linked to previous BRD treatments, Erickson et al.

This retrospective approach has also been conducted using the presence of lung lesions or lung scores at slaughter (Gardner et al., 1999; Thompson et al., 2006; Schneider et al., 2009 ). Finally, other experiments have simply evaluated the performance of a single pen or lot of cattle with high incidence of BRD (Thomson et al., 2012) . These experiments can provide good evidence of performance of treated cattle on a large commercial scale. However, none of these methods are ideal, because they either cannot account for DMI and efficiency measures, or they simply lump nontreated and cattle receiving differing numbers of BRD treatments within a pen or lot together to determine intake and efficiency of the pen or lot.",

Obviously, without knowing which calves would eventually require treatment, we were not able to measure intake during the receiving period, but previous data would suggest that the morbid calves in our experiment were likely consuming less feed than healthy animals during this time. It is likely that much of the decrease in prefinishing ADG observed in the current experiment by calves that required antimicrobial treatment for BRD could be the result of altered feeding behavior and decreased DMI by these calves. Because all calves in the present experiment received the same diets during both the receiving and finishing phases, differences in performance resulting from nutrition would primarily be related to differences in DMI by morbid animals.",

This DMI depression during the first interval of the finishing period for calves that required antimicrobial treatment for BRD is likely a carryover effect from the receiving period. These results would be similar to those reported by Holland et al. (2010) , who noted a linear decrease in DMI during the first 65 DOF. There was a tendency (P = 0.07) for DMI to be different from d 92 through 138; however, there was no linear or quadratic trend (P \u2265 0.12). No other differences in DMI (P \u2265 0.49) were detected among the BRDX groups. When DMI was evaluated as a percentage of average BW for the feeding period, a BRDX \u00d7 ANC interaction (P \u2264 0.03) was observed for d 92 through 138 and d 139 to final. A significant linear increase (P \u2264 0.001) was observed for all other intervals as well for the entire finishing period for DMI as a percentage of average BW. This increase in DMI as a percentage of BW would serve as additional evidence of the attempted compensation for reduced performance that occurred during the receiving period among antimicrobial treated calves. Holland et al. (2010) reported a linear increase or a tendency for linear increase in DMI as a percentage of BW over 2 intervals but no difference in DMI as a percentage of BW over the length of the experiment. Gain:feed was not different (P = 0.20) among BRDX during the first 45 d of the finishing period. However, the increase in ADG with increasing BRDX from d 46 to 91 and from d 92 to 138 combined with similar DMI among BRDX groups during these same intervals resulted in linear increases (P \u2264 0.01) in G:F over the subsequent 2 intervals. From d 139 to the end of the experiment, this difference in G:F was no longer present (P = 0.26); calves in the 2X and 3/4X groups became numerically less efficient, resulting in overall G:F not being significantly different (P = 0.22) among the BRDX groups.

Cattle in the 3/4X group were finished to the greatest numerical fat thickness, and there was a numerical increase in 12th-rib fat thickness observed for both 2X and 3/4X calves compared with 0X. We wanted to ensure that 2X and 3/4X calves had every opportunity to reach the same quality and yield grades as the 0X calves.

(1999) reported that the presence of pulmonary lesions was a better predictor than antibiotic treatment records for losses in ADG resulting from BRD. One reason for this finding is that cattle that were never treated for clinical signs of BRD frequently had evidence of lung damage at slaughter. However, using the presence of lung lesions at slaughter as a predictor of previous BRD incidence is not without fault, becuase it has also been reported that cattle that have be treated for clinical signs of BRD have lacked the presence of any detectable pulmonary lesions at slaughter (Wittum et al., 1996; Gardner et al., 1999; Thompson et al., 2006; Schneider et al., 2009) . Holland et al. (2010) argued that even though the lung lesion data were not different between the BRD treatment groups in their experiment, the differences in preconditioning phase performance, combined with increased haptoglobin concentrations and rectal temperatures in treated heifers, indicated that the BRD treatments administered were related to an active infection. Currently, there is no perfect diagnostic tool to determine the incidence of BRD in feedlot cattle, and thus, determining the true production and economic losses due to BRD is extremely difficult. However, we would agree with the assessment of Holland et al. (2010) that measuring finishing performance, carcass characteristics, and ultimately economic losses due to BRD based on antimicrobial treatment for the clinical signs of BRD is appropriate and accurate.",

These values are dependent on the price of cattle at the time of slaughter, the choice select spread, and individual grid premiums and discounts. In addition, the cost of inputs greatly affects the total value of cattle at slaughter. As an example, the average cost per antimicrobial treatment administered in this experiment was $13.73. However, NAHMS (2013) reported that the average cost of antimicrobial treatment for BRD in all feedlots was $23.60.",

However, decreases in BW and DP as BRDX increased resulted in larger differences in total carcass value as BRDX increased. Calves never treated for BRD had an average carcass value of $1,643.80, whereas 1X, 2X, and 3/4X groups returned $1,612.67, $1,589.01, and $1,540.46, respectively, resulting in a linear decrease (P = 0.001) in total carcass value. When total calf value was calculated by adjusting for the cost of antimicrobials, increased labor, and variation in yardage and feed consumption due to differences in DOF, the differences in value among BRDX groups became more magnified. The total calf value for 0X remained the same, whereas 1X, 2X, and 3/4X groups had total calf values of $1,605.93, $1,476.91, and $1,413.35, respectively (linear P < 0.0001). These differences in total calf value resulted in a reduction of $37.87, $166.89, and $230.46 for 1X, 2X, and 3/4X, respectively, when compared with 0X. Brooks et al. (2011) examined the economic impact of BRD treatments for the heifers in the experiment conducted by Holland et al. (2010) . Interestingly, heifers treated once for BRD returned $10.12 per head more than those heifers never treated (Brooks et al., 2011) . However, heifers treated 2 times, 3 times, or deemed chronically ill returned $11.08, $72.01, and $143.28 less per head than those heifers never treated (Brooks et al., 2011) .",

The additional DOF results in increased costs but also allows for compensation of lost performance and recovery of economic losses incurred early in the feeding period. Consequently, the railing or realizing of calves treated multiple times for BRD would not be recommended because losses can be minimized if these calves are allowed additional DOF and marketed as finished cattle. However, these calves will likely never achieve equivalent carcass yields, USDA QG, and, consequently, carcass value as calves never treated for BRD. Therefore, the economic losses of calves requiring multiple BRD treatments can be ameliorated with additional DOF, but not eliminated. In this experiment, the incidence of clinical BRD resulted in a 2.3, 10.2, and 14.0% decrease in total value for calves treated once, twice, and 3 or 4 times, respectively.",
