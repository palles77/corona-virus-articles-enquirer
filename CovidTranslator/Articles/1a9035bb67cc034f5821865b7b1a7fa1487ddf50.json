The aim of the study was to find out how the impact of the SARS event might have affected nursing students in identification with the nursing profession. A total of 10 nursing students were interviewed. This study showed that the SARS crisis enhanced a reconstruction of worldview and affirmed the professional identity of nursing students. Central themes derived from the interview were (1) appreciation and sharing of nursing identity; (2) a sense of moral duty; (3) a change of worldview and feeling of self-growth. This study provided insights to nursing education that acquisition of professional identity could be enhanced through reflective appreciation of critical events such as SARS.",

Even senior students were restricted from placement in hospitals. In this regard, they might have experienced feeling of own inadequacy as well as unachieved professionalism. Since nursing jobs certainly held elements of risk when caring for SARS patients, especially undetected cases, nursing students at this moment were likely to be motivated to clarify their devotion to and reaffirm the meaning of nursing to them.",

After all, it highlights the ethical nature of the professional culture that ultimately leads to quality future practice. Law and Arthur's study (2003) showed that perceptions of nursing significantly affect career choice of Hong Kong high school students. Spouse's (2000) interviews with British nursing students indicated that holding a positive nursing image helps sustain motivation and retention in the nursing program. Ohlen and Segesten (1998) affirmed that professional identity is foundational to the assumption of various nursing roles. Glen (1998) assured that professional identity with inherent ethical virtue contribute much to quality nursing practice. Given the current increasing public demand of high quality care in Hong Kong, professional and motivated nurses are in great need. Therefore, it is of deep concern for nursing schools to recruit and retain students who are capable and contented with their nursing identity.",

She argued that an individual develops a sense of personal identity by appropriating beliefs, emotions and motivation that are socially appreciated. Fagermoen (1997, p. 435) stated that ''professional identity emerges through a process of self-formation in which social interaction and self-reflection are the basic processes''. She opined that working as a nurse involves a realization of self, at the same time, nurses are being perceived by society as responsible for patients' well-being, they are required to be other-oriented in thoughts and actions. Based on these interlink relationships, personal as well as professional identity, with appropriation of social appreciated values, is established through a reciprocal process of social interaction. In between, self-reflection of own thoughts and actions are the key to the processing of both personal and professional identification. Bruner and Kalmar (1988) suggested that reflective activities such as self talk and narrative recounts on life stories enhance self formation. This self formation is subject to periodic transitions which are often triggered by emotionally powerful life events (Magai and Nusbaum, 1996) . The process of periodic and incidental recounts of ''who am I?'' helps to revise and extend a self-organizing systems in form of emotional and cognitive processing (Lewis and Ferrari, 2001) . In other words, it is through this integration of cognitive and emotional Severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak components during a reflective process that leads to organizing of personal and professional self.",

Approximately 10 h of audiotape resulted in over 40 pages of transcripts. A collaborative approach to analysis was employed. Intensive discussions on the phenomenological themes of the lived experiences were made among the research team, insights and understandings were derived from the data. The themes were examined, analyzed, reinterpreted and reformulated as appropriate during the process as suggested by Miles and Huberman (1994) . A range of themes were sorted and these are reported as below.",

Vanhanen and Janhonen (2000) , affirmed that education plays a major part in restructuring nursing students' orientations to nursing. According to Schon (1987) , the most important aspects of professional education are acquisition of worldviews of that discipline. This involves a change of perspectives of own relationship to that particular discipline. Mezirow (1978) used the term 'perspective transformation' to describe the process of becoming aware of our assumptions about oneself and others. He suggests two paths to perspective transformation: one is a sudden insight; the other is through series of transitions which permits one to revise his/her assumptions about oneself and others. The SARS outbreak was unique in promoting a sense of belonging and bonding that made nursing students feel a part of the nursing profession. More importantly, the event provoked an instant positive change of perspectives regarding nursing identity. However, tremendous way of change is too much for us; rather, we would like to turn this critical experience into a learning opportunity. We suggest a steady instillation of nursing identity into the minds of nursing students. By incorporating SARS experiences into nursing education curriculum, a sharing session is proposed to be integrated with nursing subjects such as ethics or professional development. This session will introduce students to a rich array of materials related to SARS events, including featured story and reports, thematic video. As life stories provide a great deal of information to students as to how they should view their professional worlds, this session will have nursing professionals' sharing their vivid life experiences with SARS.",
