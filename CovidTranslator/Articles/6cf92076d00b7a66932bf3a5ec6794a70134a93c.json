With a microcarrier concentration of 5 g/l in spinner flasks, a density of 3 x lo6 cells/ml was reached in 7 days. Under these conditions, cells supported virus growth to the same extent as when they were grown on the plastic substratum. This was shown by a similar development of virus-induced syncytia, the release of an equivalent number of infectious progeny virions per cell, similar recoveries observed after concentration and purification and an identical appearance of the purified virus under the electron microscope. On the other hand, the technical convenience of microcarriers and the ease of scale-up emphasize their potential for the growth of coronaviruses.",

The results are shown in Table 1 . There was no statistically significant difference in the release of infectious virus per cell. Moreover, a single small 250 ml flask of infected cells on microcarriers released as many infectious virions as eleven 150 cm2 dishes. When virus was concentrated and purified from the growth medium of infected DBT cells on microcarriers, similar recoveries of infectivity were observed as with virus obtained from cells grown on culture dishes (Table 2) .

The results show that DBT cells could be successfully grown on Cytodex I microcarriers. Using a microcarrier concentration of 5 g/l, a density of 3 x 106 cells per ml was obtained after 7 days. This is similar to various other cell types that were used on microcarriers, as reported before (Anonymous, 1981) . Cell morphology was identical on microcarriers as on plastic dishes. This suggested that conditions were optimal for testing viral replication. When MHV was introduced into the microcarrier culture at an MOT of 0.01, virus replicated rapidly and cell destruction was complete within 18 h. However, virus-induced syncytia detached from the microcarriers whereas the latter remained attached on plastic flasks. It is likely that the stirring of microcarriers led to the release of syncytia from their surface. Nevertheless, a similar viral titer of more than 10' PFUlml was obtained in both culture conditions. The virus was similarly amenable to concentration and purification and showed an identical morphology in the electron microscope. Thus, the growth of DBT cells on microcarriers did not affect the replication of this murine coronavirus compared to plastic dishes, as monitored by cytopathic effect, output of infectious virus per cell, its behavior upon concentration and purification and its morphological appearance.",

In the former, labware is reduced and it is much less time consuming than more conventional culture techniques. Laboratory manipulations are also reduced, thus diminishing risks of contamination. Moreover, under the present experimental conditions, comparable virus yields were obtained. The optimization of media supplements and gas exchange found in a perfused microcarrier culture should allow an increase in microcarrier concentration and ultimately permit a higher density of cells to produce even more virus particles.",

Microcarrier cultures should also prove invaluable for the study of poorly replicating viruses, as well as for the large scale production of viral vaccines, including the expression of molecularly cloned viral genes.",
