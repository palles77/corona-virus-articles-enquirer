            "text": "The history of contact between animals and humans has always involved infectious diseases, and today more than half of the infectious diseases of humans are zoonotic in origin. In fact, the majority of \"emerging\" infectious diseases in the past three decades are zoonotic. Therefore the control and prevention of these diseases can be accomplished only through improving approaches to reducing disease transmission among humans and other animals. Despite the great deal of attention that has been focused on emerging infectious zoonotic diseases, including severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), West Nile virus, monkeypox, and avian influenza, there has been less discussion and effort targeted at the environmental \"drivers\" of such diseases. One possible reason is that the traditional approach of the human health community to zoonotic disease has been an \"us versus them\" approach. The problem is viewed as an infectious animal reservoir that then poses an infectious risk to humans-either through direct contact with infected animals and their excretions, meat, milk, or other tissues, or via a vector transmission bringing the pathogen from the animal population into human hosts. The control of such \"us versus them\" diseases has traditionally involved measures such as control of the animal reservoir (through culling, quarantine, or vaccination) or vector control (through pesticides and personal protection). For many zoonotic diseases, however, such approaches are limited because the ultimate causes of infection in the animals may not be addressed sufficiently. For example, Nipah virus emerged as a deadly pathogen in Malaysia when pig farms were built close to forest areas frequented by fruit bats (Figure 9 -1 and Color Plate 9-1).

Another risk is sharing living spaces with potentially infected animals; high rates of brucellosis infection have been reported among goat-herding families that bring goats into family bedrooms during the winter. 11 A rare occurrence among veterinarians is the self-inoculation (needlestick, splash or spray to mucous membranes, or broken skin) of vaccine strains of Brucella (RB51 or B. abortus strain 19, or B. melitensis Rev-1) during animal vaccination; this represents one of the rare reported occupational risks of animal vaccination. 12 Outbreaks have occurred in laboratory workers who handled Brucella cultures outside biological safety cabinets, 9 and dog handlers are considered to be at risk from B. canis. However, analysis of recent cases in the United States indicates that brucellosis is increasingly a foodborne disease associated with ingestion of unpasteurized dairy products from infected animals. 10 ",

A history of contact with animals, laboratory exposure, or consumption of unpasteurized dairy products should make clinicians suspect brucellosis. Diagnosis in humans is based on culturing the organism from blood, bone marrow, or other tissue, and/or serology. Cultures may be slow to grow and require caution in handling. Elevated immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies titers by ELISA or other tests including serum agglutination (SAT) are often key to the diagnosis, as active infection titers often exceed 1:160. Infection with B. canis may produce antibodies that do not react with standard Brucella test antigens; therefore specific B. canis serology must be requested if this infection is suspected. PCR techniques have shown promising results but are still in development. 21 In dogs, cultures of blood and tissue are also used. There are several serological tests. The RSAT test has a high sensitivity but low specificity. The mercaptoethanol test also has low specificity; positive results must be confirmed by other tests such as the agar-gel immunodiffusion (AGID) test. 4 Possible herd infection in cattle is diagnosed using the Brucella milk ring test, which is sensitive but not specific (Color Plate 9-7). 4 Blood samples are collected from slaughtered animals.

Campylobacter shedding is more frequent in kittens and puppies versus adult animals. At least in kittens, an average carriage of about 4 to 6 weeks was observed (unknown in dogs). Treatment for animals with diarrhea is appropriate because it likely decreases the days of shedding and the number of organisms shed. Appropriate hand hygiene is critical in households with foster puppies. Treatment for asymptomatic dogs would probably not be appropriate (because of antibiotic resistance issues) even though a fair number of puppies and kittens shed Campylobacter when they are asymptomatic. Likely the quantity of organisms is less, and studies seem to support contact with dogs with diarrhea as a source. 23 caused by C. larii and C. fetus.

C. hominis is a human pathogen, although infection has been found in lambs, cattle, and other mammals. C. parvum infects humans, cattle, and other ruminants. Other species reported in humans include C. canis (dogs), C. felis (cats), and C. meleagridis (birds). Cryptosporidia colonize the intestinal and biliary tracts but can also be found in the lungs. The organism reproduces in the intestinal tract to produce oocysts. Oocysts are immediately infectious as shed in feces.

Then these trophozoites undergo sexual reproduction (meronts) to produce sporozoites, most of which acquire a protective cover to form an oocyst. These oocysts are passed in the feces, where they are immediately infective. Sporozoites that remain in the intestine without developing a cyst wall are able to reinfect the host, perpetuating infection. 5 The infectious dose is about 130 organisms to initiate a C. parvum infection in 50% of healthy volunteers. 6 Cattle can shed up to 1 million organisms per gram of feces. Most transmission appears to occur through ingestion of oocysts. Vehicles of transmission include drinking water, direct fecal-oral contamination, foodborne exposure, or contact with contaminated objects leading to ingestion ( Figure  9 -28). Infected drinking water and freshwater bathing areas have been the sources of large human outbreaks, such as the sickening of more than 400,000 people in Milwaukee, Wis., due to improperly treated municipal water supply in 1993. 7 A secondary means of transmission is by inhalation of aerosolized oocysts.",

Human infection occurs by ingesting these eggs, either through contamination of food or by direct contact with dogs or other definitive hosts. Children are often infected because of more intimate contact with dogs and frequent hand-tomouth contact. Once ingested, the eggs hatch into larvae (oncospheres) in the small intestine. Migrating through the intestinal wall, they lodge in the liver, lung, or other tissues. There they form cysts containing protoscolices. E. granulosus tends to form large, slowly growing unilocular cysts with a well-defined limiting membrane. By contrast, E. multilocularis form multilocular cysts, also known as \"alveolar\" cysts, without a limiting membrane and grow more aggressively. 4 This results in the potential for E. multilocularis to cause more serious complications. When dogs feed on the carcass of an intermediate host containing cysts, the protoscolices develop into adult worms in the dog intestine (Color Plate 9-20).",

The primary reservoir for A. phagocytophilum consists of small mammals, including deer mice (Peromyscus) and wood rats (Neotoma), although deer may also play a role. 9 Vectors of A. phagocytophilum are ticks of the genus Ixodes, including I. scapularis, I. ricinus, I. pacificus, I. triangulaceps, I. spinipalpis, and I. persulcatus (Color Plate 9-23). 4 These hard ticks are also the vector for Borrelia burgdorferi, Babesia microti, and tickborne encephalitis; therefore coinfection is common. The vector for E. chaffeensis and E. ewingii is the Lone Star tick (A. americanum). In dogs, the brown dog tick (R. sanguineus) is the principal vector for A. platys and E. canis. 10 Dermacentor variabilis, the American dog tick, can also be a vector of E. canis infection. 11 Accidental hosts for these agents include humans, dogs, cats, and ruminant animals.",

Giardia species are found in most mammals, and while different strains appear to have adapted to specific host species, molecular tools for typing particular isolates are now allowing an examination of how much zoonotic transmission is taking place. The current classification includes at least seven distinct assemblages (genotypes) of G. intestinalis: A and B are found in humans and a number of other animals, and C through G appear to be more host specific. 2,3 Giardia organisms exist in two forms, a vegetative trophozoite form capable of causing illness in the host, and a transmissible cyst form that is shed in feces ( Figure 9 -55). The cysts measure 7 to 10 microns by 8 to 13 microns and can survive up to 2 months in water, where they are resistant to routine chlorination. Upon ingestion by a host, the cysts develop into pathogenic trophozoites that cling to the brush border surface of the intestinal mucosa and reproduce by fission.",

Both cysts and trophozoites can be found in the feces (diagnostic stages). 1, The cysts are hardy and can survive several months in cold water. Infection occurs by the ingestion of cysts in contaminated water, food, or by the fecal-oral route (hands or fomites). 2, In the small intestine, excystation releases trophozoites (each cyst produces two trophozoites). 3, Trophozoites multiply by longitudinal binary fission, remaining in the lumen of the proximal small bowel where they can be free or attached to the mucosa by a ventral sucking disk. 4, Encystation occurs as the parasites transit toward the colon. The cyst is the stage found most commonly in nondiarrheal feces. 5, Because the cysts are infectious when passed in the feces or shortly afterward, person-to-person transmission is possible. While animals are infected with Giardia, their importance as a reservoir is unclear. (From Centers for Disease Control and Prevention: Giardiasis. http://www.dpd.cdc.gov/dpdx/HTML/Giardiasis.htm.

Humans may transmit human influenza virus to pet ferrets and swine. 3 The epizootic of H5N1 high pathogenicity avian influenza in domestic and wild birds in Asia, Europe, and Africa has focused increased attention on the potential of influenza viruses to cross species barriers and cause human disease, although this is still considered a rare event and the H5N1 epizootic has not, to date, produced a pandemic virus. Dogs and cats have become naturally and experimentally infected with avian influenza viruses but have not as yet been shown to transmit the infection to humans. A swine influenza A H1N1 virus that emerged in Mexico in the spring of 2009 has further underscored the zoonotic nature of this disease. Human cases were identified worldwide within 1 week after the cause of the outbreak had been identified. As of October 25, 2009, the World Health Organization had confirmed more than 440,000 humans infected with the pandemic H1N1 virus and 5700 deaths worldwide (http://www. who.int/csr/don/2009_10_30/en/index.html). Human-toanimal transmission of the virus has also caused outbreaks in swine and turkeys (http://www.fao.org/news/story/en/ item/29532/icode/). 4 H1N1 influenza infection has also been documented in ferrets and a cat (http://www.usda. gov/documents/FINAL_RESULTS_2009_PANDEMIC_ H1NI_INFLUENZA_CHT.pdf). influenza outbreaks in the growth/early finishing animals. Breeding herds are often vaccinated as well. \u2022 All horses in contact with other equines should be vaccinated against equine influenza. Three types of equine influenza virus vaccines are available. 8 Inactivated vaccines and canary pox vector vaccines are administered intramuscularly. The initial series consists of 2 doses of vaccines given 3 to 6 weeks apart followed by boosters every 6 months. Annual influenza vaccine boosters may be sufficient for horses at low risk of exposure once they have been primed with 3 doses of vaccine over a 7-month period. The third vaccine type, modified live cold-adapted vaccines, is administered intranasally. One priming dose is recommended followed by boosters every 6 months. ",

Each virus carries one H and one N glycoprotein type (see Figure 9 -63). Sixteen hemagglutinin subtypes (H1 through H16) and 9 neuraminidase (N1 through N9) have been identified from avian hosts. 10 Seasonal human influenza A viruses recognized to date have possessed H1, H2, or H3 and N1 or N2 glycoproteins. Influenza A (H1N1) and A (H3N2) have been circulating worldwide in human populations since 1977. Influenza B, which occurs only in humans and seals, is also responsible for significant human morbidity globally each year. 5 Influenza C is rarely recognized in comparison to A and B viruses but can cause focal human epidemics. New seasonal influenza viruses evolve from point mutations (antigenic drift) in the surface glycoproteins, particularly the H, which frequently happens during viral replication. Gene segment reassortment among influenza A viruses can also occur. If these reassortments involve human and animal influenza viruses, they may lead to significant antigenic changes (antigenic shifts) that can result in the emergence of a novel virus subtype (Figure 9 -65). Influenza viruses exhibit various degrees of host adaptation with easy transmission between individuals within the same species, and greater difficulty of infection and unsustainable transmission to unrelated host species. 11, 12 The basis of this host or species adaptation is unclear, but the presence of the proper constellation of gene segments is critical and may include specific hemagglutinin binding to receptors on host cells, especially respiratory cells, and their differential distribution; cleavability of hemagglutinin protein; presence or absence of glycosylation sites on the hemagglutinin; length of neuraminidase protein and its affinity for the sialic acids; and ability of polymerase complex to function within the host cell. 13 Strains of avian influenza virus are classified as low pathogenic (LP) or high pathogenic (HP) based on their lethality in chickens. 14 Currently HPAI H5N1 is circulating in Asia, Europe, and Africa. However, other highly pathogenic strains have caused outbreaks in the recent past, including H7N7, H7N3, and H5N2. All HPAI viruses have been H5 and H7, but most H5 and H7 viruses are of low pathogenicity.",

Typical clinical signs associated with LPAI reflect an upper respiratory tract disease or reproductive disease in hens (i.e., drops in egg production with abnormal eggs). However, some H5 and H7 LPAI viruses have mutated into HPAI viruses in the field. Signs of HPAI include high mortality rate; sudden death without premonitory clinical signs; lethargy; severe decrease in egg production; facial edema with swollen eyelids, comb, wattles, and hocks; purple discoloration of the wattles, combs, and legs; upper respiratory tract signs; incoordination; and diarrhea. 30 Turkeys are susceptible to certain strains of H1 and H3 swine influenza viruses. 31, 32 Swine influenza A H1N1 and H3N2 viruses are endemic in swine populations in the United States. 33 Clinical signs of influenza in pigs include fever, coughing, nasal and/or ocular discharge, dyspnea, and depression. Reproductive problems are seen in both males and females. Milk production may also be reduced. The morbidity period is usually 5 to 7 days. Morbidity can reach 100%. Mortality rates are low, usually between 1% and 3%; however, secondary bacterial infections may develop and increase mortality. 25 Influenza A viruses H3N8 and H7N7 cause equine influenza in horses and other equids. The incubation period is generally 1 to 3 days. Incubation periods as long as 7 days have been reported. Clinical signs include fever; a harsh, dry cough; and serous to mucopurulent nasal discharge. In partially immune or vaccinated animals, one or more of these signs may be absent. Other typical signs include depression, muscle Potential transmission route soreness, anorexia, and enlarged submandibular lymph nodes. Young foals lacking maternal antibody protection are susceptible to a fatal viral pneumonia. Horses can also develop a potentially fatal secondary bacterial pneumonia, pleuropneumonia, and myocarditis. 8, 34 Infected horses may shed virus over an extended period starting during the incubation period and ending a week or more after apparent recovery. Peak viral shedding is thought to occur during the first 24 to 48 hours when the animal is febrile. 8 The virus is spread via aerosolized respiratory droplets and fomites with an attack rate that can approach 100% in susceptible populations.",

Young children and older adults are less likely to present with these symptoms. Infants may present with high fevers. A septicemia-like disease, cough, and fever are seen in 64% of children younger than 5 years, and fewer than one in three nonhospitalized patients 60 years or older present with typical influenza signs. 5 Laboratory confirmation of disease is important. Specimens should be collected the first few days after onset of symptoms or no more than a week after disease onset in young children. The most common diagnostic tests currently used in clinics, doctors' offices, and hospitals are rapid influenza tests using immunochromatography. These tests require no reagent additions or wash steps, usually detect both influenza A and B, and use respiratory tract specimens specified in the manufacturers' instructions. 38 Results are available within 30 minutes. The accuracy of these tests depends on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay, the amount of virus in the sample, and the specimen type used. Infants and young children shed the highest viral titers, and these tests perform best in this patient group. The rapid tests typically have greater than 90% specificity and an average 70% sensitivity for detecting influenza.

The infection takes two basic forms: cutaneous and visceral, but disease syndromes may overlap. The severity of human infection ranges from mild skin lesions to severe disfiguring facial involvement or systemic disease with organ failure and death. This zoonotic disease is transmitted by insect vectors, usually of the phlebotomine sand fly family. Leishmaniasis has been transmitted directly from dog to dog in the United States. Worldwide risk of leishmaniasis is increasing in both humans and animals. Factors responsible may include the transboundary movement of humans and animals, global climate change affecting the distribution of vectors, the HIV epidemic, 1 and increasing contact of humans with wilderness areas where the disease is endemic. In addition to being a disease of travelers returning to the United States, there is an expanding focus of human cases of leishmaniasis in Texas, as well as an ongoing outbreak of canine visceral leishmaniasis in foxhounds in the eastern United States. The complex interrelationships of leishmaniasis infection in animals and humans demand ongoing cooperation between animal and human health professionals to detect new cases and better control this challenging disease.",

The MAT has a high specificity for specific serovars. However, it may lead to underdiagnosis if a person is infected with an unusual serovar not well covered by the standard test. Serial serology titers are required to document seroconversion-a fourfold increase in titer is considered evidence of recent infection. 6 The use of PCR techniques for diagnosing human leptospirosis has been reported. 23 In animals, the MAT and ELISA are also used; paired sera are preferred.

As they feed on the blood of vertebrates, the larvae can become infected with B. burgdorferi. After feeding, the larvae become less active and mature into nymphs by the following spring. 18 The majority of human cases occur in the spring and summer as a result of bites by nymphs that are active and seeking a blood meal to allow them to develop into adults. 8 Once they have fed, the nymphs develop into adults. The adult female lays eggs the following spring to continue the cycle.

            "text": "The relation of environmental factors to the risk of Lyme disease is complex but it appears that landscape modification in the United States related to suburbanization of the human population is playing a significant role. As suburban developments and other human built environments encroach into land that was previously forest habitat, they produce \"fragmentation\" of forests (Figure 9 -82). This breaking up of forested area into patches interspersed with human residential development has caused an increase in deer populations by providing ideal vegetative habitat (including ornamental shrubs for deer to eat) and reduced pressure of being hunted and predators. It also appears to favor increases in populations of peridomestic Peromyscus, which are important hosts for Ixodes ticks and for B. burgdorferi. Such forest fragmentation has been shown to be related to tick abundance and infection rates. 20 However, individual human behavior appears to play an important role in determining human risk, including time spent outdoors and use of protective repellents and clothing. Another environmental factor is climate and climate change. Warmer winters may result in increased tick abundance during the following spring and summer. 21 Because the environment appears to play a role in Lyme disease risk, studies have examined whether environmental modifications can reduce such risk. Area-wide acaricide use reduces tick populations, but many communities are reluctant to use wide-scale pesticides. However, targeting small areas of high human exposure, such as residential yards, has been highly effective in reducing nymphal tick density. 22 Treating host animals with acaricides, such as the \"four poster\" method of treating deer with acaricide at feeding stations, has reduced tick populations, but the distribution of bait designed to reduce tick feeding on rodents is less effective. By eliminating the deer population, the maintenance host of ticks, the risk of Lyme disease has been nearly eliminated in an island setting. 23, 24 Integrated pest management can be effective to aid in tick control, including landscape modification around dwellings (see \"Key Points for Clinicians and Public Health Professionals\").",

Dogs have not been reported to have the bull's-eye rash. Approximately 5% of seropositive dogs develop clinical Lyme disease. 6, 26 Clinical signs may not appear for 2 to 6 months after infection and may include lameness, fever, anorexia, myalgia, lethargy, lymphadenopathy, cardiac arrhythmias (rarely), neurological signs, and ocular manifestations (Color Plates 9-43 and 9-44). 3, 6 Dogs have also been reported with Lyme arthropathy, a recurrent arthritis with lameness particularly in the tarsal and carpal joints (Figure 9-85) . Lyme nephropathy, a chronic protein-losing nephropathy that may be related in part to immune complex deposition, can progress to a fatal acute oliguric or anuric renal failure. 6, 26 Some have questioned whether the nephropathy could be related to coinfections with other agents. Coinfection with other tickborne diseases is common, either transmitted by the same tick vector (A. phagocytophilum, Babesia microti, or Bartonella species) or other tick vectors (Ehrlichia species and Rickettsia rickettsii). 3, 6 Previous infection with B. burgdorferi does not appear to confer immunity. Cats appear to be largely asymptomatic but can rarely develop arthritis. 27 Serosurveys using ELISA antibody screening have reported seroprevalence rates in horses greater than 80% in endemic areas. 28 Although a wide range of clinical conditions have been associated with Lyme infection in horses, clinical infection is considered to be extremely rare and poorly understood. 29 EM lesions have been experimentally caused by infecting rabbits with B. burgdorferi.

However, a search should be performed for possible coinfection with agents such as Anaplasma and Babesia. When the rash is not present but Lyme disease is suspected and pretest probability is 20% or greater, serological testing using a two-step method is recommended. This consists of a screening ELISA test followed by a confirmatory Western blot if the ELISA is indeterminate or positive. If less than 4 weeks has elapsed since the onset of infection, both IgG and IgM should be tested; if more than 4 weeks have elapsed, only IgG should be tested. The two-step method is considered to have high specificity and a low risk of false-positive diagnosis. 31, 32 In animals, a rapid antibody test has been developed to detect antibodies against the C6 B. burgdorferi protein and correlates well with the Western blot immunoassay. 33 This test detects only antibodies against antigen acquired through natural exposures, and therefore will not yield positive results in vaccinated animals. 6 In dogs, testing validates exposure to the B. burgdorferi organism but not clinical illness. Supporting evidence for a diagnosis of Lyme disease is based on history of exposure to B. burgdorferi through exposure to Ixodes ticks in an endemic area, clinical signs, positive C6 peptide and/or Western blot antibody test results, ruling out other differential diagnoses, and response to antibiotics. 6 Controversy exists in the veterinary literature about whether healthy dogs should be routinely screened for B. burgdorferi antibodies. 6 Limitations to serological testing include a long incubation period, presence of subclinical infections, cross- Prophylaxis with oral doxycycline may be offered to adults or children if a tick bite is due to an adult or nymphal I. scapularis tick that has been attached for at least 24 hours, less than 72 hours has elapsed since removal of the tick, and the use of doxycycline is not contraindicated (doxycycline 200 mg PO for 1 dose; children 8 and older, 4 mg/kg). 1 Following a tick bite, regardless of whether prophylaxis is given, individuals should be monitored for any signs of disease such as development of a fever or an EM rash. The use of antibiotics for disease treatment depends on the stage of disease. Table 9 -42 outlines recommended antibiotics regimens outlined by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA). The use of macrolides should be reserved for persons who are unable to tolerate tetracyclines, penicillins, or cephalosporins because their efficacy may be lower.",

[17] [18] [19] Several serological studies conducted in urban areas have shown that the prevalence of LCMV infection among humans ranges from 2% to 5%. 11 In Baltimore, LCMV antibodies were found in 4.7% of 1149 inner-city residents tested, 6,20 and 49% of these reported house mice within their residence. 21 The true incidence of LCM is unknown because many cases go unreported owing to the self-limiting effect in healthy individuals and lack of recognition by physicians.",

The resistance of S. aureus to \u03b2-lactam antibiotics (penicillins and cephalosporins) including methicillin is due to the production of a penicillin-binding protein (PBP2a) encoded by the mecA gene, which is carried on a transposable genetic element called the staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec). There are at least five different SCCmec types (I-V) and several subtypes. 34 The PBP2a protein is expressed in the cell wall and has a low affinity for \u03b2-lactam antibiotic binding. Some MRSA also have membrane-bound protein pumps to remove antibiotics. Although strains of S. aureus that are resistant to methicillin have been identified for many years, some recent clones circulating in humans since 2000 include genes coding for Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL), a membrane toxin that appears to be related to virulence (Figure 9 -88). 29 The bacteria are stable in the environment for 17 hours in sunlight, 46 hours on glass, less than 7 days on floors, 42 days in carcasses and organs, and 60 days in meat products. 35",

In addition to skin and soft tissue infection, pneumonia, and other pathologic conditions, asymptomatic nasal carriage rates of 30% or greater have been reported. Previous surveys have indicated that human nasal carriage rates of MRSA are much lower than for S. aureus in general, but this may be changing. 41 In animals, S. aureus is not as common a pathogen as other Staphylococcus species such as S. pseudintermedius (previously referred to as S. intermedius). 7 However, recent studies have found significant carriage rates of MRSA in dogs and cats from almost all body sites tested (wounds, abscesses, and chronic pyodermas). Other animals that carry MRSA include horses, pigs, elephants, rabbits, cattle, and birds. 4, 12, [14] [15] 17, 21, 42, 43 Strain-typed MRSA infections found in dogs and cats are typically indistinguishable from predominant human strains. 3, 6, 8, 44, 45 To date, studies have shown transmission of MRSA from people to animals and animals to people, but it is not clear whether animals are a significant reservoir for people. However, evidence suggests that several new MRSA strains may have entered human populations from pigs and cattle. 4 A study in a small animal hospital found 9% of the dogs were MRSA carriers, whereas almost 18% of the staff was infected. 5 Among S. aureus isolates from sick animals in veterinary teaching hospitals, 14% were MRSA. 46 Among healthy dogs and cats in the general population, MRSA prevalence has been reported at 1% to 3%, although there was a high rate of infection with methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (MRCoNS). 14 The epidemiology in pigs may be different. A relatively high prevalence of nasal carriage of MRSA has been reported 47 in agreement with previous studies showing transmission between pigs and farmers. 14 MRSA infections associated with pigs and calves have emerged as a significant concern in Europe. Studies have identified pig or calf contact as significant risk factors for both colonization or infection with a specific MRSA strain, called ST398, which has been found in pigs in Europe, Asia, and North America. [15] [16] [17] 42 Astoundingly high rates of colonization have been identified in pig and cattle farmers. 15, 16, 25 There is concern that this strain is now causing infections beyond direct human contacts and that farm animals may be an important reservoir of this strain for human infections. 25, 48, 49 ",

In most cases, MRSA isolates are susceptible to a variety of antimicrobials, and commonly used antimicrobials such as chloramphenicol may be used. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is often useful; however, adverse effects (keratoconjunctivitis sicca, arthropathy) must be considered.

Fleas are the principal vector of plague. Urban plague has been linked to exposure to the oriental rat flea Xenopsylla cheopis (Color Plate 9-51), which commonly infests Rattus species. Fleas, once infected, may remain infectious for a year or longer. 11 Both male and female fleas can transmit the infection. Wild rodent fleas vary by species in their ability to be effective vectors. Cat fleas (Ctenocephalides felis) are considered poor vectors for plague. 3, 11 The human flea (Pulex irritans) may spread the infection between humans in situations of crowding and poor sanitation. 11",

            "text": "Rift Valley fever (RVF) is a zoonotic arboviral disease that primarily affects ruminant livestock (cattle, sheep, and goats) and camels, but the disease can also occur in humans. Cattle, sheep, and goats appear to be particularly susceptible to infection. Animal infection is characterized by acute hepatic necrosis; increased abortions among pregnant animals; and high mortality rates in young, neonatal livestock populations. Most human infections are asymptomatic or may present as an uncomplicated influenza-like illness. However, a small percentage of human infections may result in significant neurological illness, retinitis, hepatitis, or hemorrhage progressing to death. RVF virus could potentially be introduced into the United States by an infected person or animal, especially during their viremic phase, or by an infected vector. Although RVF is currently found in Africa and the Arabian Peninsula, the virus has the potential to become established in other geographical areas owing to the abundant range of competent vectors capable of transmitting infection, the high level of viremia that develops in both infected animals and humans that allows sustainability of the virus, and the ability of the virus to adapt to different ecological conditions. However, for the virus to become established in the United States, climatic conditions must be favorable to ensure survivability of the mosquito vector, and appropriate numbers of livestock are necessary for adequate amplification of the virus. A recent publication evaluated potential pathways of RVF introduction into the United States and concluded that air transportation of a viremic civilian or mechanical transportation via aircraft or ship of an RVF-infected vector were likely pathways for introduction of RVF virus into the United States. 1 Therefore it is essential that communication among animal and human health officials be coordinated to detect this potentially devastating zoonotic infectious disease. Fortunately, a multiagency working group has been formed to discuss a research agenda, modeling efforts, and surveillance and response capabilities, among other activities, to develop a comprehensive national RVF prevention and response plan. 2",

In newborn lambs, kids, and calves after an incubation period as short as 12 hours, the most prevalent clinical sign is death, preceded by fever. Mortality rates can approach close to 100% in some species. Older animals may demonstrate weakness, anorexia, listlessness, and a nasal discharge. Infection in adult cattle and small ruminants is often subclinical; however, some animals may develop fever, anorexia, bloody diarrhea, and a mucopurulent nasal discharge. Adult camels do not demonstrate clinical signs of illness; however, they do abort. The mortality rate in adult livestock may range from 10% in cattle to 20% in sheep.

Cases of abortion in ruminants also support the diagnosis in humans. Recent human infection is determined by serology to detect IgM antibodies by ELISA; by virus isolation during the acute, viremic phase; or by RT-PCR to detect viral antigen. 28 In animals, the differential diagnoses for a \"storm\" of abortions in pregnant ruminants and a high mortality rate among young/neonatal ruminants includes a number of diseases such as brucellosis, ovine enzootic abortion, Nairobi sheep disease, rinderpest, peste de petit ruminants, vibriosis, ephemeral fever, Wesselsbron disease, trichomonas, and heartwater. To detect RVF infection in animals, heparinized blood may be analyzed for virus isolation, especially during the acute phase when virus levels are elevated. Acute and convalescent sera can be used to detect a rise in antibody levels by ELISA or hemagglutination inhibition; antibody is present within 6 to 7 days after infection. 31 Tissue specimens may also be submitted for virus isolation as long as they are not formalinized. Electron microscopy may be used to detect viral particles in tissue specimens or RT-PCR can be used to detect viral antigen. For histopathological review, the best necropsy samples to submit in 10% buffered formalin include the spleen, liver, and brain (particularly from aborted fetuses).",

Other risk factors include achlorhydria, antacid treatment, antibiotic therapy, and malnutrition. Ownership of reptiles and other pets (including rodents) is a risk factor for infection (Figures 9-118 and 9-119 ). An estimated 4% of the U.S. population owns reptiles, and a FoodNet study estimated that 6% of reported salmonellosis cases in the United States were attributable to reptile and amphibian ownership. 8 Salmonellosis can also be an occupational disease. An outbreak occurred among 45 workers in companion animal veterinary medical facilities, and lack of proper biosafety precautions was considered the cause. 9 Other cases have occurred among veterinary pathologists performing necropsies, 10 workers producing poultry vaccines, 11 and workers exposed to raw meat. 7 Newborns and debilitated animals are at risk of more severe disease. Crowding, boarding, mixing, and malnutrition are stressors that predispose many animals to infection. Group housing is associated with higher rates of infection in cats. Feeding dogs and cats raw meat has been found to increase the risk of infection. 12 Dry pet food and pig ear dog treats have been found to be contaminated and pose a risk to pets and their owners.",

Reports of scabies in humans date back to antiquity, and it was the first infectious disease linked to a specific etiology with the use of a microscope. In 1834 the mite was conclusively demonstrated on a young female patient in a Paris clinic, establishing the association between the mite and its dermatological manifestations. 1 This little-appreciated historical event represented the first etiological diagnosis in medicine. In human medicine, scabies continues to cause both sporadic cases and outbreaks in industrial countries, and immunocompromised persons can experience severe infection. Dogs and many other animals also experience significant infections with variants of S. scabiei that are adapted to particular host species. With close contact such as occupational exposure, transmission of animal scabies variants from animals to humans can occur. Although such zoonotic infestations (pseudoscabies) are usually self-limited, they underscore the importance of communication between human and animal health professionals about cases of skin rashes occurring concurrently in humans and animals. This section focuses on scabies, but there are a number of other mite species that infest animals and are capable of causing self-limited skin infections in humans that may be misdiagnosed or missed by medical providers.",

Adult mites are 0.3 to 0.5 mm long and roughly circular with four pairs of legs (Figure 9-125) . Variants of S. scabiei are found in a variety of animal species but are taxonomically indistinguishable between human and animal species. For example, scabies in dogs is caused by S. scabiei var canis. 2 In addition to S. scabiei, a number of other mites that infest animals are able to also cause skin rashes in humans. Table 9 -60 lists some of these mite species with zoonotic potential. Dermanyssus gallinae, the red poultry mite, is a nocturnal blood-sucking mite that is the most common mite found in pigeons. Close contact with poultry, wild birds, or nesting material can lead to human infection, which presents as a nonspecific dermatitis that is intensely pruritic and often misdiagnosed. 3, 4 Cheyletiella species, the walking dandruff mite, may be present as a subclinical infection in dogs and cats but can cause an erythematous, papular rash in humans in contact with infected animals. The papules are usually on the arms, trunk, and buttocks and develop into yellow crusted lesions that can be intensely pruritic. Rarely, bullous eruptions and systemic reactions have been reported. 5, 6 Otodectes cynotis is a common mite found in the ears of dogs and cats, where it causes local irritation. It can migrate to other parts of the pet's body, and because it is not host specific, it is capable of infecting humans as well, causing a papular skin rash or an external otitis. 6 Notoedres cati (feline scabies) is a rare but highly contagious disease of cats that can also infect humans, 7 causing a pruritic rash within hours without visible skin burrows (Figure 9 -126 and Color Plate 9-66).",

Puppies, especially those from a pound or animal shelter or whelped in a large breeding kennel, may be at increased risk. Dogs that are allowed to roam freely and contact wildlife or other dogs, including at dog parks, may be at higher risk of infestation. 6 Debilitated animals may be at increased risk of severe cases of sarcoptic mange. Wildlife also can sustain scabies; foxes are particularly susceptible to heavy mite infestations (Figure 9 -127).

The material adhering to the blade from two to three postage stamp-sized areas is then transferred to a microscope slide, diluted with more oil if necessary, with a cover slip applied after using it to scrape excess oil adhering to the scalpel blade, and the wet mount specimen is examined under \u00d74 and \u00d710 low power. The slide should be methodically examined as follows: Sweep left to right, move down one field, and right to left until the entire slide area is examined for mites (adults, nymphs, or larval mites) or distinctive eggs and the smaller scybala (fecal pellets that are numerous and distinct brown-gold/orange in color). Occasionally some skin lesions may be due to the Demodex folliculorum mite (eyelash mite) that has widespread distribution in human populations.

Patients, especially the elderly with a history of extensive home care or long-term care residency, may have a large number of mites from skin with red, raised, pruritic lesions and evidence of secondary eczematization. Although these lesions are not specifically crusted scabies, these cases are classified as \"atypical crusted scabies\" or \"aggressive scabies\" and require more intense treatment and oversight. 15 In dogs and humans, skin scrapings may not always produce mites or their effects but call for thorough attempts at recovery nonetheless. After scraping and in the absence of mites, a diagnosis can be made based on exclusion of other diseases, epidemiological links, clinical impression (degree of pruritus, history, distribution pattern), and response to treatment.",

Family members should be treated even if asymptomatic. The majority of patients respond to one treatment, and although there is a lack of well-controlled studies documenting that two applications are better than one, treatment is usually repeated, especially if there is microscopic and/or morphologic evidence of treatment failure. Patients in institutional settings may have a higher mite burden and require one to two additional treatments. Scabies in immunocompromised individuals (crusted or Norwegian scabies) generally requires much more intense scabicidal treatment. Keratolytic agents (salicylic acid or alpha-hydroxy acid products) can be used to soften tissue, permitting better penetration of topicals, coupled with frequent reassessment and longer periods of contact isolation.

The immature oocysts shed in cat feces are not immediately infectious but take 1 to 5 days to sporulate into mature oocysts with viable sporozoites (Figure 9-139) . These infectious oocysts can persist in the environment for several months. If they are ingested by an intermediate host either directly or through contaminated soil, they begin to asexually multiply in the host's intestinal epithelium and produce tachyzoites. The tachyzoites disseminate in the intermediate host's bloodstream and lymph system both freely and intracellularly within monocytes and macrophages. 4 After several weeks of rapid multiplication, the intermediate host may develop immunity.

The first time cats are infected, the parasite's life cycle is completed when some of the bradyzoites initiate a sexual cycle to produce unsporulated oocysts that are shed in the feces for 1 to 2 weeks. Cats are typically resistant to reinfection. 5 The primary routes of toxoplasmosis transmission to humans are the ingestion of raw or undercooked meat that contains viable cysts, the ingestion of infectious oocysts due to contact with cat feces or contaminated soil or fomites, and congenital infection. The relative importance of these different routes of transmission is poorly understood and probably varies by geographical region. A survey of more than 6000 commercial samples of beef, chicken, and pork from retail stores in the United States found a low incidence of infectious cysts, with viable T. gondii detected only in samples of pork. 6 Transplacental transmission occurs during active infection of the mother with the tachyzoite phase. The risk of transmission from an infected pregnant woman to her fetus is considered lower in early pregnancy (although the consequences to the fetus are greater) than in subsequent weeks. 7 Other transmission pathways include organ transplants and blood transfusions.",

Symptoms, when they occur, are usually self-limited and can include significant cervical or other lymphadenopathy and fever with atypical lymphocytosis. Rarer complications can include toxoplasmic chorioretinitis, myocarditis, and myositis. The incidence of ocular toxoplasmosis in immunocompetent persons is believed to be more common than previously thought, and toxoplasmosis is one of the most common causes of uveitis in the general population, leading to vision loss in some cases. 8, 9 Encephalitis and even death can occur but are rare in immunocompetent hosts. 9 In immunocompromised patients, toxoplasmosis often produces severe disease, including encephalitis and cerebral abscesses (Figure 9-140) , pneumonitis, chorioretinitis (Color Plate 9-70), and myocarditis with a high mortality rate if the disease is not treated in a timely fashion. Symptoms of encephalitis can include confusion, seizures, sensorimotor deficits, and ataxia. 10 Infection in immunocompromised humans may be the result of reactivation of latent infection but can also result from acute infection. Organ transplants can be a source of infection in immunocompromised persons. 9 One of the most significant complications of human toxoplasmosis infection occurs when a pregnant woman is in the acute phase of the illness (tachyzoite phase) and the organism passes to a fetus, resulting in congenital infection. Congenital toxoplasmosis can present as mild to severe disease, with complications including hydrops fetalis, perinatal death, prematurity, decreased birth weight, retinal scarring, and a classical triad of chorioretinitis, hydrocephalus, and cerebral calcifications (Figure 9-141) . Although more than half of infected newborns are considered normal shortly after birth, most will develop ocular and/or other complications if not treated. 11",

For many years, TSEs were referred to as slow virus infections because of their transmissibility, resistance to filtration, and long latent periods. Most pathologic features of prion diseases involve the CNS. TSE agents, such as the agent of scrapie, are remarkably resistant to disinfection and inactivation by heat, radiation, or chemicals, 7 although more robust disinfection strategies are effective. 8 Strains differ between abnormal prions infecting different species, possibly related to variations in the threedimensional protein structure or length and sequence of the amino acid chain. The BSE agent has been transmitted experimentally, using a variety of techniques and doses, to other species, including cats, mice, pigs, sheep, goats, cattle, mink, macaque monkeys, and marmosets. 9",

Of these, CJD is the most common. 2 GSS and FFI are genetically mediated diseases, whereas kuru transmission has been linked to cannibalism among islanders in the South Pacific. CJD has three main variants: sporadic CJD (sCJD), iatrogenic CJD, and variant CJD (vCJD). vCJD is associated with BSE. Recently a new type of CJD has been described, known as proteinase-sensitive prionopathy (PSPr). 13 Iatrogenic CJD is a rare form of CJD that has been linked to corneal transplants, growth hormone derived from pituitary extracts, dura matter grafts, and contaminated neurosurgical instruments. 7 sCJD is characterized by a rapidly progressive dementia with confusion and often associated movement disorders such as ataxia and myoclonus. It is typically a disease of older individuals (median age, 68 years). In sCJD the electroencephalogram (EEG) may show periodic high-voltage complexes. Samples of CSF are acellular with normal glucose but may show elevation of protein including a protein known as 14-3-3. 14 vCJD differs from sCJD in a number of ways, including the younger age of patients (median age, 28 years), the prominent symptoms of paresthesias, the lack of specific EEG findings, specific MRI findings of an increased signal in the posterior thalamus, and the ready detection of the agent in lymphoid tissue. Patients with vCJD also have a prolonged clinical course compared with patients with sCJD (median illness duration of 13 to 14 months vs. 4 to 5 months for sCJD). 7",

Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC), which includes M. tuberculosis and M. bovis, has been found in Egyptian and New World mummies 1,2 and recovered from spinal and bone lesions of Iron Age human remains in Britain and South Siberia. 3, 4 In animals, there is documentation of TB in buffalo in China more than 500,000 years ago. 5 TB is believed to have been a key factor in the extinction of mammoths and mastodons around 10,000 years ago. 5 Approximately one third of the world's human population, or about 2 billion people, are infected with TB; active cases of TB in 2006 were reported to exceed 9 million. 6 Coinfection with HIV disease accounts for more than 15 million cases of TB infection, and TB is an important cause of HIV-related deaths throughout the world. TB has now become the leading cause of death from any infectious disease worldwide, with mortality from tuberculosis in 2006 of 1.7 million. 6 TB in livestock and wildlife is a worldwide problem and has serious socioeconomic ramifications, especially in developing nations. In the United States, recent surveillance has shown a resurgence of TB in animals among diverse species such as white-tailed deer, 7 bobcats, coyotes, opossums, raccoons, and red foxes. 8, 9 Although the public health linkage between TB in humans and other animals has been recognized for more than a century, the key issue was believed to be human infection with bovine TB through the ingestion of unpasteurized dairy products. However, recent advances in molecular diagnosis have shed light on additional human-animal TB issues including occupational and reverse zoonotic infection. This section discusses TB in humans and other animals. Infection with non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) is covered in an accompanying summary.",

There are more than 120 species of mycobacteria, which are generally divided into rapidly growing (visible on culture within 7 days) and slow growing (those requiring longer periods of growth). Most mycobacteria are not considered pathogenic. The species of greatest pathogenicity to humans and other animals are those classified as Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC), the etiologic agents of TB. Of all the mycobacteria, only MTBC and M. leprae (the agent of leprosy) are obligate intracellular organisms; the others live freely in the environment. Because of the importance of MTBC as a pathogen to humans and other animals, other mycobacteria are generally referred to as nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) or mycobacteria other than tuberculosis (MOTT). However, as they are found throughout the environment, they may also be referred to as environmental mycobacteria (EM). These NTM are discussed below in a separate section. TB was traditionally thought to be a zoonotic disease transferred to humans during the neolithic ages through contact between humans and animals domesticated for livestock. It was therefore believed that M. tuberculosis had evolved from M. bovis. There is now evidence that all members of the MTBC evolved from a TB progenitor, M. prototuberculosis, estimated to be as old as 3 million years (Color Plate 9-75). In addition, researchers have shown that tubercle bacilli are able to exchange parts of their genome with other strains, a process that is crucial to the adaptation of pathogens to different host species. 10, 11 ",

TB in wildlife has become a major problem in many parts of the world, and transmission of disease is increasingly bidirectional at the livestock-wildlife interface in industrialized and developing countries. Wildlife reservoirs such as badgers, opossums, ferrets, deer and other cervids, feral pigs, African buffalo, and bison serve as sylvatic reservoirs and ongoing sources of infection to pastured animals primarily through contamination of water and food sources within their shared environment. The presence of multiple maintenance hosts favors the long-term persistence of infection and disease among differing populations. 15, 16 Conversely, infection in wildlife species such as kudu, baboons, lions, and hyenas may represent a sporadic spillover from a livestock reservoir. Therefore TB in livestock and pastured animals will no longer be able to be eradicated or controlled by traditional livestock control programs that do not take into account the wildlife disease reservoirs. In addition to the risks of transmission between wildlife and livestock, wildlife TB can pose a zoonotic threat to game hunters who butcher carcasses (respiratory and cutaneous exposure) and who consume undercooked meat. 17, 18 In addition, TB in peridomestic wildlife such as nonhuman primate populations in Asia may pose a risk of direct zoonotic transmission to humans via close contact.",

Antigen of the tubercle bacilli then stimulates the host's cellular immune response and the immune cascade is triggered. Immunologic control or containment of the infection is achieved through a potent cell-mediated immune response beginning with helper T-lymphocytes and, later, a delayed hypersensitivity response.

However, because cellular immune response usually takes between 4 and 12 weeks to be elicited, it may not, or only partially, be stopped there. The MTBC bacillus may then spread systemically via the regional lymph nodes and lymphatic system and enter the bloodstream (primary disease). Hematogenous circulation of the tubercle bacilli is generalized but may affect mainly organs and tissues that are more densely vascularized, such as bone, liver, spleen, central nervous system, kidneys, and genital tract, where the bacilli are then targeted by local mononuclear phagocytes. These organs, along with lymph nodes, are therefore the most common sites of extrapulmonary disease. Studies of tissue from infected asymptomatic individuals have shown viable M. tuberculosis in primary lesions in the lung and in lesionfree areas of lung and lymph nodes. Although primary lesions can occur anywhere in the lung, postprimary disease most commonly develops in the apical regions. 19 The immune system continues to attempt to isolate the bacillus, forming granulomas or tubercles (Color Plate 9-76) The granuloma may become thick walled and dense, effectively encapsulating the organism and preventing further spread. The bacilli then become latent within the granulomas. These granulomas may eventually calcify. The major route of transmission for humans (and one of the main routes for animals) is through respiratory aerosolization. When there is active TB in the lungs, the bacillus is expelled and aerosolized in the form of droplet nuclei through coughing (or any explosive respiratory action such as singing, shouting, sneezing, or talking). For these droplet nuclei to be inhaled and reach the alveoli in humans, they must be 3 to 5 microns or less in size. In animals, the exact sizes of infecting droplet nuclei may vary depending on the species.",

The efficiency of transmission of TB depends on a number of factors, as shown in Box 9-7. 20 The second most common route of transmission is through the gastrointestinal tract by the ingestion of infected material. Drinking or eating unpasteurized milk products traditionally has been the principal means by which humans have acquired zoonotic TB. 21 In industrialized countries pasteurization and strict herd testing and management have made such gastrointestinal transmission rare, but zoonotic TB caused by M. bovis acquired through ingestion may be seen in immigrants from countries with a continuing prevalence of M. bovis infection in cattle or livestock. 22, 23 Of note are the recent documented human-to-human transmissions of M. bovis, including an epidemiologically linked cluster of six cases identified in the United Kingdom. Five of the patients had pulmonary TB disease and one had TB meningitis 24 ; only one was known to be HIV infected. The index case had a history of occupational exposure and consumption of unpasteurized milk and cheese both as a young adult and recently in a country not free from bovine TB. In another cluster, human nosocomial transmission of M. bovis among HIV-infected individuals occurred in a Spanish hospital, resulting in 30 deaths. 25 Humans may also serve as a source of TB infection for animals, including nonhuman primates, cattle, dogs, and macaws. [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] Animal-to-animal transmission of TB occurs through respiratory and gastrointestinal routes. 32 Respiratory infection can occur in herds or closely quartered animals through pulmonary disease or draining lymphadenopathy.

The 1-year mortality rate for treated, HIV related TB is 4 times the rate of non-HIV related TB, around 35%. TB also worsens HIV disease by inducing stimulation and replication of T-cell lymphocytes. These T cells are then targeted by the virus, resulting in increased HIV replication. If the tuberculous infection is initially contained by the immune system, which then subsequently experiences a significant deterioration in the quantity and function of T-helper cells, the bacillus may no longer be contained and the TB reactivates. In addition, the cytokines produced in response to TB infection stimulate the production of HIV in vitro. 33 Active TB is usually a slowly progressive disease characterized by systemic symptoms of weight loss, fatigue, anorexia, fevers, chills, night sweats, and wasting. The severe weight loss and wasting associated with the disease led to its former name of consumption. When the disease is pulmonary, presenting symptoms may also include a persistent cough (with or without sputum production), chest pain, and hemoptysis. Although TB is generally a chronic, debilitating disease, it may present with an acute, rapidly progressing course. Disease is generally pulmonary, followed by lymphatic drainage and local lymphadenopathy, or disseminated (especially in immunocompromised hosts; Color Plate 9-77). Manifestations may vary depending on the extrapulmonary site of disseminated disease. Central nervous system involvement may present as either meningeal or parenchymal disease. Meningitis more commonly affects the basilar meninges, and the cranial nerves may also be involved. Parenchymal lesions may be single or multiple and present as solid tuberculomas or TB abscesses. Symptoms will depend on the location of the lesion and/or mass effect from surrounding edema (Figure 9-151) . TB may also present in the spinal vertebrae (Pott's disease) (Figure 9-152) . ",

In humans, 0.1 mL of purified protein derivative (PPD) is placed on the inner surface of the forearm. More complete information on TB skin test placement, reading, and interpretation is available at http://www.cdc.gov/TB/pubs/slidesets/ core/html/trans4_slides.htm. The TST is usually read after 48 to 72 hours. The induration (not the erythema) is measured and should be recorded in millimeters, not simply as negative or positive. In humans, a positive TST reaction may be measured for up to 7 days, although a negative reaction can only be read until 72 hours. The TST, however, has limited sensitivity and specificity. In humans, there is an overall false-positive rate of 20% and a false-negative rate of 20%. False-positive results may be seen in NTM infection, recent Bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) vaccination, or incorrect administration. False-negative results may occur in overwhelming TB disease, anergy, recent TB infection, newborns, recent live-virus vaccinations, some viral illnesses, incorrect administration, or waning immune response (usually due to age or prolonged time since infection). Because of the possibility of a waning immune response, in some instances a two-step TST is performed. In those situations, an initial TST may serve to stimulate, or boost, subsequent TSTs. A two-step TST is therefore currently recommended for baseline testing in those who will undergo periodic testing, such as health care workers. 37 This helps to differentiate between a boosted reaction and one due to recent infection. The criteria for determining whether a human TST is positive depends on the risk group of the individual. Table 9 -69 defines the size of the induration per risk group. Figure 9 -155 n This technician is in the process of correctly placing a tuberculin skin test in this recipient's forearm, which will cause a 6-mm to 10-mm wheal (i.e., a raised area of skin surface) to form at the injection site. The tuberculin skin test is used to evaluate people for latent tuberculosis infection. In the United States, this skin test consists of an intradermal injection of exactly one tenth of a milliliter of tuberculin, which contains 5 tuberculin units. Correct placement of this intradermal injection involves inserting the needle bevel slowly at a 5-to 15-degree angle. The needle bevel is advanced through the epidermis, the superficial layer of skin, approximately 3 mm so that the entire bevel is covered and lies just under the skin surface. A tense, pale wheal that is 6 mm to 10 mm in diameter appears over the needle bevel. (From Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Public Health Image Library, Atlanta, Ga.

Table 9 -72 shows common potentially pathogenic mycobacteria, classified according to growth rate as either rapid growing (less than 1 week) or slow growing (more than 1 week). Transmission of NTM is achieved through inhalation or ingestion of water, particulate matter or aerosols, or through trauma. 47 NTMs are not generally considered communicable between humans and animals or as zoonotic infections and as such are not reportable diseases. Consequently, epidemiological data on the prevalence of NTM disease are not well established and surveillance information is limited. The clinical and epidemiological presentation of NTM infection has changed dramatically in recent years. This is thought to be due, in part, to the ability of these organisms to survive and flourish in habitats shared with humans and other animals, such as drinking water. In addition, an increase in the proportion of HIV-infected and other immunosuppressed hosts suggest a continuing and increasing prevalence of NTM infections in the future. Human risk factors associated with NTM disease include comorbid lung conditions such as prior TB disease, silicosis, and bronchiectasis, and host immunosuppression such as HIV infection. With the rise of HIV infection in the 1980s came increasing reports of disseminated human NTM infections, such as M. avium complex (MAC).",

Primary respiratory signs are uncommon. Rarely, tubercles may be seen on the face and oral cavity of infected birds. 51 The diagnosis of avian TB usually has been made by culture of the organism, although adequate culture specimens may be difficult to obtain. The finding of mycobacterial organisms in histology associated with inflammatory cells and the clinical presentation have been used to make a presumptive diagnosis. PCR testing is available, although the results must be interpreted carefully. 52 A positive result means that there are mycobacteria present but does not necessarily mean that it is the cause of disease. Most birds with avian TB either succumb to the disease or are euthanized. In some areas it is a reportable avian disease. Other than in birds, MAC infection in mammals is sporadic and not considered transmissible. However, disseminated disease has been reported in captive, nondomestic hoofed animals and in immunosuppressed dogs and cats. 53 M. marinum may commonly be found in marine animals and water. It can be transmitted directly from fish or marine animals to humans; it may indirectly be transmitted through water or contaminated equipment, such as aquariums (see above). Infection in ecothermic fish may present as a systemic disease with internal tuberculomas, anorexia, weight loss, skin defects, spinal deformities, abdominal distention, and exophthalmia. The prognosis in fish is poor; those affected are usually killed and removed from the environment, as infection may be transmitted if the fish are cannibalized.",

Although most cases are charac- terized by the abrupt onset of fever, chills, fatigue, myalgia, headache, and nausea, several distinct forms of the disease are related to the mode of transmission and the virulence of the organism. Infection caused F. tularensis subspecies tularensis may progress to septicemia, with disseminated intravascular coagulation, acute respiratory distress syndrome, CNS involvement, and multiorgan failure. Disease related to F. tularensis subspecies holarctica is more likely to produce mild symptoms with a low case fatality rate. Most cases (87%) 19 present as ulceroglandular tularemia, resulting from insect bites or direct contact with an infected carcass (Figure 9 -159 and Color Plate 9-81). One of the first symptoms is lymphadenopathy localized in the area where the bite or scratch occurred. A painful papule develops either simultaneously or within several days at the site of the initial skin entry. This papule then ulcerates, taking several weeks to heal. 5 The lymphadenopathy may also suppurate and become ulcerative (Color Plate 9-82). Rarely, if there is contact with conjunctival membranes, oculoglandular tularemia develops, with purulent conjunctivitis and lymphadenopathy. Glandular tularemia resembles the ulceroglandular form but without skin lesions. 19 Primary pneumonic tularemia results from inhalation of infected aerosols and manifests as pneumonitis and bronchiolitis, which may lead to respiratory failure. Pneumonic tularemia may also develop as a complication of other forms and is associated with a higher mortality rate. 19 The typhoidal form of tularemia is considered rare, is caused by ingestion of contaminated food or water, and may be difficult to diagnose. Symptoms can include fever, gastroenteritis, septicemia, and pneumonia. Ingestion may also lead to oropharyngeal tularemia with throat pain, prominent pharyngitis, oral ulcers, and enlargement of cervical lymph nodes.",

The virus was first detected in the Americas in 1999 by a veterinary pathologist when a flavivirus was identified as the cause of an apparent zoonotic encephalitis outbreak in humans and corvid birds (e.g., crows and jays) in Queens, New York. WNV has since become the most important cause of mosquito-borne disease in North America. It spread across the 48 continental United States in 6 years, and more than 27,000 human cases and 25,000 horse cases of WNV disease were reported during the period 1999 to 2007. Outbreaks of human or equine WNV encephalitis have also occurred in southern Europe, Israel, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Russia. WNV is an example of a disease where tracking sentinel cases in birds, 2 horses, dogs, 3 and other animals, as well as WNV positive pools of mosquitoes, has proved useful for efforts aimed at early detection and prevention of human cases. Several zoonotic arthropod-borne (arboviral) diseases are known to circulate within the United States, including St. Louis encephalitis (SLE), Eastern equine encephalitis (EEE), La Crosse encephalitis (LAC) and Western equine encephalitis (WEE). These arboviruses may have different vector and vertebrate hosts than WNV but many of the guidances discussed below are relevant for prevention of and control of them all.

There are three licensed WNV vaccines currently available: an inactivated whole virus vaccine, a live recombinant canary pox vector vaccine, and a modified live chimera vaccine. The American Association of Equine Practitioners provides the following guidance on WNV vaccination of horses 7 : Primary vaccination of previously unvaccinated horses with either the inactivated or canary pox vector vaccine involves administration of 2 doses of vaccine 4 to 6 weeks apart followed by revaccination at a 12-month interval. Label instructions for the modified live chimera vaccine recommend a single injection followed by a 12-month revaccination interval. More frequent boosters may be warranted for juvenile (<5 years) or geriatric (>15 years) horses. Although the licensed WNV vaccines are currently not labeled for administration to pregnant mares, many veterinary practitioners do administer them to pregnant mares. Booster vaccination of pregnant mares 4 to 6 weeks before foaling provides passive, colostral protection to their foals. To avoid interference from colostral antibodies, primary vaccination of foals from vaccinated mares should be started at 4 to 6 months of age. Foals should receive a third dose in the spring of the year following their birth. Foals of unvaccinated mares should ideally receive two doses of vaccine before the mosquito-borne disease season starting at 3 months of age. The modified live flavivirus chimera vaccine is labeled for foals 5 months or older. A single dose should be administered followed by a second dose at 10 to 12 months of age (before the next WNV season). \u2022 Prevent dogs and cats from eating birds and other wildlife.

Acute encephalitis, polyarthritis, and myocarditis have been reported in dogs. 22 Fever and lethargy have been reported in cats. In addition, WNV has been isolated from the brain of a cat with neurological disease. 25 Outbreaks of WNV disease with high mortality rates have been seen among farm-raised alligators. The virus appears to spread via fecal-oral transmission in the alligator pens (Color Plates 9-87 and 9-88).",

Individuals who only received 1 dose in their first year of vaccination should receive 2 doses in the following year. The TIV is injected into the deltoid muscle of older children and adults. Infants and young children without adequate deltoid muscle mass should be vaccinated in the anterolateral aspect of the thigh. The LAIV is made from a weakened virus and can cause mild illness in some individuals (runny nose, headache, sore throat, or cough). It is approved in healthy people (without underlying health problems predisposing them to complications from influenza) between 2 and 49 years who are not pregnant. Two doses of LAIV administered at least 4 weeks apart are recommended for 2-to 8-year-old children who are receiving an influenza vaccine for the first time. If the child receives only 1 dose in the first year, 2 doses are recommended the following year. The intranasal vaccine comes in a prefilled, single-use sprayer containing 0.2 mL of the product. Approximately 0.1 mL (i.e., half of the total sprayer contents) is sprayed into one of the nostrils and the second half of the vaccine dose is administered into the other nostril.\u2022 Clinicians should strongly consider seasonal influenza vaccination for poultry and swine workers.6   \u2022 CDC guidance for detection, testing, and treatment of patients infected with the pandemic H1N1 virus and recommendations for vaccination of people at risk for infection with the novel virus strain can be found at: http://www.cdc.gov/H1N1FLU. \u2022 At the time of publication, CDC guidance for detection, testing and treatment of patients infected with the pandemic H1N1 virus and recommendations for vaccination of people at risk for infection with the novel virus strain were at: http://www.cdc.gov/H1N1FLU/. \u2022 Public health recommendations regarding influenza change rapidly. Please consult the WHO (www.who. int) and CDC (www.cdc.gov) websites for up to date information. Clinicians \u2022 Contact state veterinarian and public health department to report suspected or confirmed cases of animal influenza. \u2022 Wear appropriate PPE when examining animals with suspected influenza infection. This includes gloves and surgical masks-if a highly pathogenic avian influenza, swine influenza, or human influenza strain is suspected, an N-95 respirator should be used. \u2022 Test and isolate sick animals. \u2022 Use appropriate infection control measures in the practice (hospital and clinic) to avoid environmental contamination and nosocomial spread of the virus. 7 \u2022 Educate the animal owner regarding zoonotic risk (where applicable) and need for adequate PPE and handwashing. Offer direct communication with family physician. \u2022 Counsel ferret owners that these pets are susceptible to several human influenza strains. \u2022 Be aware of the USDA's National Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) Response Plan. Should HPAI be identified in the United States, a team of federal and state officials will be deployed to the area to assess the scope of disease and the resources needed to confine it. \u2022 Veterinarians and veterinary staff should receive annual seasonal influenza vaccinations. \u2022 If an outbreak of HPAI is identified in wild birds, consider diagnosis in domestic birds or bird predators with clinical signs and potential virus exposure. \u2022 Influenza virus vaccines are available for swine, dogs, horses, and domestic birds. Several inactivated wholevirus swine influenza vaccines are currently on the market. The vaccines help reduce the severity of disease in pigs but do not provide complete protection against infection. Many in the swine industry use autogenous vaccines produced against the strain circulating in their herd. Animals are usually vaccinated during the late nursing-early weaning stage to prevent",

Vaccines have been used in specific high-risk situations targeting a known hemagglutinin subtype of avian influenza virus, such as in outdoor-reared turkeys in the upper Midwest United States when in contact with avian influenza-infected migratory ducks, or for turkeys in areas of high swine concentration. Avian influenza vaccination requires approval of the state veterinarian, and with H5 and H7 avian influenza, the approval of the USDA. Most licensed vaccines are inactivated whole avian influenza virus in oil-emulsified adjuvant, which requires individual bird handling and subcutaneous or intramuscular injection. One fowl poxvirus recombinant containing an influenza H5 hemagglutinin gene insert is licensed for emergency use.

            "text": "In 1986, an outbreak of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) occurred in the United Kingdom that was eventually linked to the use of livestock feed containing meat and bone from animals infected with a prion disease (prion is short for proteinaceous infectious particle). Shortly afterward, outbreaks of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) were reported in zoo animals and domestic cats that had consumed BSE-contaminated meat products. In retrospect, this unusual occurrence of prion diseases in animals was a sentinel event for human health risk. In 1996, the emergence in humans of a variant form of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD), a progressive dementia, was attributed to consumption of contaminated beef from BSE-infected cattle. As a result of the implementation of a number of feed bans, such as a prohibition against feeding mammalian protein to any farmed animals in the United Kingdom, the incidence of reported cases of both BSE and vCJD has dropped dramatically in recent years. Outbreaks in cats and other animals also declined related to similar feed bans. Despite the success in controlling BSE and vCJD, prion diseases continue to be a public health concern. Sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), which has no known link to animal prion diseases, occurs worldwide at a case rate of approximately 1 case per 1 million persons. 1 Other variations of human prion disease are reported worldwide at lower rates (see \"Disease in Humans\" section on the following page). Chronic wasting disease (CWD), a prion disease of wildlife such as deer and elk, is extending its range in the United States and Canada. Scrapie, a prion disease of sheep, continues to affect sheep and goat populations in some parts of the world. The origin, transmissibility, and ability for cross-species infection of these diseases remain poorly understood. Therefore ongoing vigilance for the emergence of TSE-related disease in humans and other animals by human and veterinary clinicians and public health authorities is warranted. Francisella tularensis causes an acute febrile illness in humans and other animals that can be fatal. The incidence of tularemia has decreased in the United States since the first half of the twentieth century. 1 However, sporadic outbreaks continue to occur, and the disease has emerged in regions where it previously had not been recognized. Moreover, its widespread occurrence in wildlife and arthropod vectors, its ability to persist in water and soils, and its high infectiousness for both humans and domestic animals make it both a high-priority biological terrorism agent as well as a zoonotic pathogen with potential to cause significant health effects in human and animal populations.",
