Nasal washings of volunteers experimentally infected with rhinovirus showed a 100-fold increase in PMN concentration 1 to 2 days after inoculation. 20 This influx of PMNs coincides with onset of symptoms and correlates with the presence of a colored nasal discharge. 21 A yellow or white nasal discharge may result from the higher number of PMNs, whereas the enzymatic activity of PMNs (due to myeloperoxidase and other enzymes) may cause a green nasal discharge. A potent chemoattractant for PMNs is produced by cells in culture infected with rhinovirus. 22 This chemoattractant has been identified as interleukin-8 (IL-8). 23 Elevated causes bronchiolitis in children 2 years or younger, influenza viruses cause febrile respiratory illness with severe lower respiratory tract involvement, adenoviruses cause pharyngoconjunctival fever, parainfluenza viruses cause croup in young children, HBoV is associated with wheezing, and enteroviruses cause a variety of illnesses, including aseptic meningitis and herpangina.",

            "text": "In temperate climates in the northern hemisphere, the predictable yearly epidemic of colds begins in September and continues un abated until spring. This sustained epidemic curve is a result of successive waves of different respiratory viruses moving through the community (Figure 26 -1). The epidemic begins with a sharp rise in the frequency of rhinovirus infections in September (after children return to school), which is followed by PIVs in October and November. RSV and HCoVs circulate during the winter months, whereas infection due to influenza virus peaks in the late winter. The epidemic finally ends with a small resurgence of rhinovirus infections in the spring. Adenovirus infection occurs at a constant rate throughout the cold season. 5 The frequency of colds varies with age. A 10-year study of families with children who did not attend a childcare facility showed that the peak incidence of colds occurs in preschool children 1 to 5 years old, with a frequency of 7.4 to 8.3 colds per year. Infants younger than 1 year averaged 6.7 colds per year, and teenagers averaged about 4.5 colds per year. Mothers and fathers experienced about 4 colds per year. 6 With the greater exposure of children to other preschool children in childcare facilities, the frequency of colds in children younger than 6 years has increased. Thus, the typical preschool child experiences at least one URI per month throughout the cold season.",

            "text": "Viral transmission occurs primarily in the home setting, although the exact mechanism of spread has not been clearly established. Colds can be spread by: (1) small-particle (<5 \u00b5m in diameter) aerosol, which infects when inhaled; or (2) largeparticle (>10 \u00b5m in diameter) droplets, which infect by landing on nasal or conjunctival mucosa; or (3) direct transfer via handto-hand contact. 7 Small-particle aerosol is an effective method of transfer for influenza virus 8 and coronavirus 9 but not for RSV. 10 Rhinoviruses are most likely spread by large-particle droplets or direct transfer. Rhinoviruses can survive as long as 2 hours on human hands and up to several days on other surfaces. Studies in young adults have shown that infected individuals commonly have rhinovirus on their hands, which can be efficiently levels of IL-8 and other cytokines (IL-1\u03b2, IL-6) also have been demonstrated in the nasal secretions of infected individuals. 24, 25 Furthermore, elevated levels of albumin and kinins (predominantly bradykinin) in nasal secretions have been shown to coincide with the onset of symptoms in experimental rhinovirus infection. 20 The elevated concentration of albumin and kinins likely results from exudation of plasma proteins due to greater vascular permeability in the nasal submucosa. The method by which viral infection initiates this vascular leak has not yet been determined. The release of kinins resulting from plasma exudation may augment the symptoms of the cold; bradykinin alone can cause rhinitis and sore throat when sprayed into the noses of uninfected individuals. 26 The paranasal sinuses usually are involved during an uncomplicated cold. In one study, computed tomographic (CT) scans obtained during the acute phase of illness revealed abnormalities of one or more sinuses in 27 (87%) of 31 young adults. 27 Without antibiotic therapy, there was complete resolution or marked improvement of the sinus abnormalities in 11 (79%) of the 14 subjects in whom second CT scans were obtained 2 weeks later. In another study, MRI revealed that 60% of children with upper respiratory tract infections had major abnormalities in their paranasal sinuses; these tended to resolve without antibiotic therapy. 28 It is not known whether these sinus abnormalities result from viral infection of the sinus mucosa or from impaired sinus drainage secondary to viral rhinitis. Nose-blowing can generate enough pressure to force fluid from the nasopharynx into the paranasal sinuses, suggesting that nose-blowing may force mucus containing viruses, bacteria, and inflammatory mediators into the paranasal sinuses during a cold. 29 The middle ear can also be involved during uncomplicated colds. Studies in school-aged children have shown that two-thirds will develop abnormal middle-ear pressures within 2 weeks after onset of a cold. 30 Otitis media was not diagnosed during the study, as ears were not examined and none of the children sought medical care. It is not known whether the abnormal middle-ear pressures result from viral infection of the mucosa of the middle ear and eustachian tube or from viral nasopharyngitis with secondary eustachian tube dysfunction.",

A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in preschool children with URIs showed that treatment with an antihistaminedecongestant combination (brompheniramine maleate and phenylpropanolamine hydrochloride) produced no improvement in cough, rhinorrhea, or nasal congestion, although a larger proportion of the treated children (47% versus 26%) were asleep 2 hours after treatment. 34 Numerous decongestants, antitussives, and expectorants are available over the counter, but there is no evidence to support their use in children. A study of phenylephrine, a topical decongestant, in children 6 to 18 months old showed no decrease in nasal obstruction with its use during a URI. 35 In a study comparing placebo, dextromethorphan, and codeine for cough suppression in children 18 months to 12 years old, cough decreased in all patients within 3 days, but there was no difference in cough reduction among the three treatment groups. 36 Guaifenesin, an expectorant, has not been shown to change the volume or quality of sputum or the frequency of cough in young adults with colds. 37 Echinacea preparations, commonly believed to be effective in the treatment of the common cold, have been shown to have no effect on the prevention or treatment of rhinovirus infection 38 as has intranasal zinc gluconate for treatment of colds 39 or prevention of experimental rhinovirus colds. 40 In January, 2008, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued an advisory strongly recommending that over-the-counter cold and cough medications not be given to infants because of the risk of life-threatening side effects.",

New-onset fever and earache during this period may herald the development of bacterial otitis media, which occurs in about 5% of colds in preschool children. Persistence of nasal symptoms for longer than 10 days has been thought to signify the development of a secondary bacterial sinusitis. However, a recent study found that 20 children hospitalized for preseptal or orbital cellulitis, indicative of bacterial sinusitis, had symptoms of acute respiratory tract infection for 7 days or less prior to hospitalization, suggesting that the complications of rhinosinusitis can occur during the first few days of a cold. 43 Bacterial pneumonia is an uncommon secondary infection. For children with underlying reactive airways disease, wheezing is common during the course of a viral URI; at least 50% of asthma exacerbations in children are associated with viral infection. Children who experience more than one lower respiratory tract infection (such as croup or bronchiolitis) during their first year of life have an increased risk of asthma thereafter. 44 Other complications are epistaxis, eustachian tube dysfunction, conjunctivitis, and pharyngitis.",

As the determinants of this process are further elucidated, treatments may be developed that can interrupt or ameliorate release of inflammatory mediators and thus prevent or reduce the symptoms of the common cold. Vaccines are unlikely to be useful for prevention, given the large number of serotypes of some cold viruses as well as the lack of lasting immunity to others. The use of alcohol-based hand gels has been suggested as a means of reducing secondary transmission of respiratory illnesses in the home, 45 but this was not shown to be effective in one field trial. 46 Also, virucidal tissues have been shown to be effective in preventing viral passage and transmission, and may reduce secondary transmission by about 30%. 47, 48 Until new methods are developed, prevention of the common cold is limited to avoiding self-inoculation (transfer of virus from contaminated fingers to nasal or conjunctival mucosa) by removing virus through handwashing or by killing virus with application of a virucide to the hands.",
