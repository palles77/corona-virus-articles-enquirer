            "text": "A prospective epidemiological study was conducted to evaluate the incidence of febrile cough episodes among adult Muslims travelling from Marseille to Saudi Arabia during the Hajj pilgrimage and to assess if use of statin had an influence on this incidence. In total, 580 individuals were presented with a questionnaire. A significant proportion of individuals had chronic medical disorders, e.g. diabetes mellitus (132, 22.8%) and hypertension (147, 25.3%). Pilgrims had a low level of education and a low employment rate. Sixty (10.3%) were treated with statins for hypercholesterolemia. Four hundred and fourty-seven pilgrims were presented a questionnaire on returning home. A total of 74 travellers (16.6%) experienced fever during their stay in Saudi Arabia (67 attended a doctor) and 271 (60.6%) had cough (259 attended a doctor); 70 travellers with cough were febrile (25.9%). Seventy per cent of the travellers who suffered cough episodes developed their first symptoms within 3 days, suggesting a human to human transmission of the responsible pathogen, with short incubation time as evidenced by a bimodal distribution of cough in two peaks at a 24 h interval. None of demographical and socioeconomic characteristics, underlying diseases or vaccination against influenza significantly affected the occurrence of cough. Diabetes correlated with an increased risk of febrile cough (OR = 2.02 (1.05-3.89)) as well as unemployment ). Use of statins had no significant influence on the occurrence of cough and/or fever during the pilgrimage. This result suggests that while treatment with a statin has been demonstrated to reduce the mortality from severe sepsis associated with respiratory tract infections, it probably does not play a role in the outcome of regular febrile cough episodes as observed in the cohort studied here.",

            "text": "Each year, approximately 2000 Muslims travel from Marseille to participate in the Hajj, gathering with over two million pilgrims from all over the world. Health risks during the Hajj are a critical issue due to the extreme congestion of people [1] . Infectious diseases represent a major problem during the pilgrimage with acute respiratory infections (ARI) as the most common cause of admission to hospital [2] [3] [4] . Hajj pilgrims during their 1-month stay in Saudi Arabia experience relatively homogeneous accommodation conditions, and undertake identical rituals, while retracing the footsteps of the Prophet Mohammed, thus being very likely exposed to the same risk of ARI. In recent years, several non-randomized studies have linked statin use with decreased risk of severe sepsis or death from severe infections, including pneumonia [5] [6] [7] . Recent prospective cohort studies confirmed previous observations [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] while another suggested that the apparent beneficial effect of statins probably reflected a 'healthy user' effect, as statin users appeared to be younger, healthier, better educated, and socially and economically more privileged compared to non-statin users [13] . These controversial findings also raised questions about the potential role of statins in the prophylaxis of infectious diseases such as pandemic influenza [14] . Muslims departing from Marseille to participate in the Hajj have been found to have a median age of 61 years, with more than one third being over 64 years old [15] , and are therefore likely to use statins in a significant proportion. We conducted a prospective epidemiological study to evaluate the incidence of febrile cough episodes among Hajj pilgrims from Marseille and to assess if statin use could have an influence on this incidence. The socio-economic situation and health characteristics of the travellers were not consistent with the hypothesis of a 'healthy user' effect.",

Nine individuals were hospitalized (two in Saudi Arabia, one in Algeria and six upon returning to France). Among the six patients hospitalized in France, two had a respiratory tract infection. Haemophilus influenzae was identified as the responsible pathogen in one of these two patients who was also suffering from diabetes. Among the four other hospitalized patients, two had unstable diabetes mellitus and two had haematological disorders. A total of 74 travellers (16.6%) experienced fever during their stay in Saudi Arabia (67 attended a doctor) and 271 (60.6%) had cough (259 attended a doctor). Just over 25% of the travellers with cough were febrile. Dates of beginning of fever and cough are shown in Fig. 1 . A first peak was observed on 28 December, followed by a second peak on 30 December. The mean duration of fever was 3 days (range 1-15 days) while the mean duration of cough was 11 days (range 2-30 days). None of demographical and socio-economic characteristics of pilgrims significantly affected the occurrence of cough. Similarly, previous travel to Saudi Arabia, diabetes, hypertension and chronic respiratory diseases, as well as vaccination against influenza had no significant influence on the occurrence of cough during the pilgrimage (Table 3 ). When considering only the cases of cough associated with fever, travellers with diabetes appeared to have an increased risk compared to other patients in univariate analysis (OR = 2.02 (1.1-3.7), p 0.02). Similarly, individuals of <65 years and unemployed had a greater risk of cough associated with fever (OR = 2.22 (0.98-5.03), p 0.05).

Of particular concern was the finding that a significant proportion of individuals had chronic medical disorders, e.g. diabetes mellitus and hypertension. Similarly, high rates of diabetes and hypertension were found in patients [20] . We also observed that the level of education of Hajj pilgrims was particularly low, with a proportion of 83.1% of individuals with a level of education below that of a certificate of primary school education compared to 42.3% in the total immigrant population and 24.1% in the general population of south eastern France (PACA) [21] . The pilgrim employment rate was seven-times lower and the proportion of pilgrims living in social housing in state-owned property was twice that of the total immigrant population in the same region [21] . These results, together with an overall low rate of vaccination against tetanus, diphtheria, poliomyelitis and influenza [15] , suggest that Hajj travellers departing from Marseille represent a category of travellers particularly at risk for travel-related diseases and that their socio-economic conditions should be considered during the pre-travel visit regarding cost-effective vaccines.",

A study based on clinical criteria of influenza-like illness among pilgrims from Pakistan reported rates of 36% in influenza-vaccinated pilgrims and 62% in pilgrims not vaccinated against influenza [23] . Another study involving English pilgrims, based on seroconversion rates, showed an attack rate of 30% among the vaccinated and 41% among the non-vaccinated participants [24] . Finally, an ARI attack rate of 26% was recently observed among medical team members treating pilgrims in Saudi Hospitals [25] . Vaccination coverage against influenza did not influence the occurrence of ARI in our experience, which strongly suggests that influenza virus was not the pathogen responsible for the observed symptoms. When investigating the pathogens causing respiratory tract infections in hospitalized patients during the Hajj, H. influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Streptococcus pneumoniae appeared to be the most common pathogens (30%) in one study [26] , while Mycobacterium tuberculosis was the most common pathogen (20%) identified in a study on communityacquired pneumonias during the 1994 Hajj [27] . Viral pathogens are also commonly identified during the Hajj, representing 11-20% of pathogens responsible for upper respiratory tract infections in hospitalized pilgrims with Influenza A and B virus, rhinovirus and adenovirus being the most common [26] [27] [28] [29] .",

Overcrowding and continuous close contact, notably in the desert plains of Mina and Arafat where accommodation in collective tents is necessary, greatly increases the spread of respiratory tract infections. Under these conditions a single case of severe acute respiratory syndrome during the Hajj may cause an epidemic of unprecedented scale. During pre-Hajj consultation such an event should be considered in counselling travellers. Hand disinfection with alcohol-based scrubs should be recommended as it was proven to protect from ARI development; it should be acceptable to most pilgrims given the religious insistence on ritual purity before the five daily prayers [32] . The Saudi Arabian Ministry of Health has recommended that masks be used to minimise droplet spread [33] . However, regular use of surgical facemasks was recently shown to offer no significant protection against ARI, and intermittent use of surgical-type masks is associated with increased risk of infection [25] . Furthermore, many Muslims consider covering of the face during the Hajj to be prohibited; therefore general compliance with this advice is unlikely. Vaccination against H. influenzae and Pneumococcus should be recommended to travellers suffering from chronic respiratory disease and diabetes mellitus conditions. Vaccination against diphtheria, tetanus, poliomyelitis and pertussis should be updated when required and vaccination against influenza systematically proposed.",
