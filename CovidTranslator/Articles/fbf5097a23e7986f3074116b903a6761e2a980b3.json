To date, no effective treatments exist and current prophylactic therapy access is limited and is only w50% effective. To attenuate the risk of RSV infection, we hypothesized that bioengineering of either the virus particle or host cell via the covalent grafting of methoxypoly(ethylene glycol) [mPEG] would prevent infection. To this end, the anti-viral effects of grafting concentration, linker chemistry and polymer length on RSV infection was assessed. For viral modification, short chain polymers (2 kDa) were significantly more effective than long chain (20 kDa) polymers. In contrast, modification of host cells with small polymers provided no (w0%) protection while long chain polymers effectively prevented infection. For example, at 48 hours post-infection at a multiplicity of infection of 0.5 and grafting concentrations of 5, 7.5, and 15 mM, 20 kDa mPEG decreased infection by 45, 83, and 91%, respectively. Importantly, both viral and host cell PEGylation strategies were able to provide near complete protection against RSV infection of both non-polarized and polarized cells. In conclusion, mPEGmodification of either RSV or the host cell is a highly effective prophylactic strategy for preventing viral infection.",

Analogous to these allogenic receptor-ligand interactions, we have shown that direct mPEG-modification of simian virus 40 (SV40) prevents host cell infection [13] . Furthermore, mPEG-modification of host cell surface proteins protected cells from viral challenge with Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV), mouse adenovirus (MAV), rat coronavirus (RCV), and SV40 [13] .

Virus MOI ranging from 0.5 to 0.01 were modified with 2 or 20 kDa SVAmPEG for HeLa cell challenge (Fig. 2) . As shown, at the very high MOI of 0.5, low grafting concentrations of SVAmPEG (2 mM) of either the 2 or 20 kDa polymers were ineffective at preventing viral invasion. However, as grafting concentration increased (!5 mM) a dose-dependent decrease in viral infection was noted with a near complete abrogation of infection at !12.5 mM. Interestingly, at the 7.5 mM grafting concentration at an MOI of 0.5, the 2 kDa mPEG polymer was significantly (p < 0.006) more effective at preventing viral infection than the 20 kDa chain ( Fig. 2A) . As the MOI decreased, the relative dose-dependent efficacy of mPEG grafting increased due to a greater polymer to virus ratio (i.e., more chains per viral particle). An interesting finding was that, as a general trend, RSV modification with short chain polymers (2 kDa) provided improved antiviral efficacy over long (20 kDa) chain polymers, especially at lower grafting concentrations (e.g., MOI 0.05 and 0.01 at 2 mM grafting concentration; p < 0.007). At higher RSV grafting concentrations (!12.5 mM), both polymer lengths yielded nearly complete protection against viral infection at all MOI.

Again, as noted in Figs. 1 and 2, for both SCmPEG and SVAmPEG, shorter polymers showed a trend towards enhanced protection over the long chain polymers at lower grafting concentrations; i.e., when the virus particle to polymer ratio is low. At these low virus:mPEG ratios the improved efficacy of the 2 kDa polymer may be partially due to the distribution of virus specific proteins within the viral envelope. On the RSV virion the G (attachment) and F (fusion) proteins form glycoprotein spikes that are 6-10 nm apart and extent 11-20 nm from the virion surface [20] . Previous studies on mPEG polymers grafted to artificial surfaces have shown that 2 kDa mPEG extends w6 nm from the surface [27] , while 20 kDa mPEG extends w50 nm from the surface (estimated length based on [27] ). As mPEG is a highly flexible molecule, each grafted mPEG chain inhibits large molecules or particles (i.e. other mPEG chain, antibodies, cells) from interacting with the cell surface within the radius of the polymer. Thus given the distance between glycoprotein spikes on the RSV virion, grafting of 2 kDa mPEG will likely result in the direct modification of a greater number of glycoprotein spikes. Grafting of 20 kDa mPEG will likely result in fewer spikes being modified as the initially bound mPEG will exclude other polymer chains from grafting to spikes in close proximity. At higher grafting concentrations, the self-exclusion effect of grafted mPEG is partially overcome resulting in high levels of surface modification. This effect is further enhanced with the SVAmPEG due to its longer half-life.",

However, the ability to produce an anti-viral barrier by the direct PEGylation of the target cells (e.g., nasal epithelial cell) of the virus would be of significant clinical utility. As noted in Figs. 5-7, direct grafting of the 20 kDa mPEG polymer to mammalian cells resulted in a potent anti-RSV barrier. Indeed, at higher grafting concentrations (!7.5 mM) very significant protection was observed at all MOI. However, polymer size was a crucial determinant of this anti-viral effect. In contrast to direct modification of RSV, the 2 kDa polymer demonstrated no efficacy when modifying target cells. These findings were somewhat surprising as previous studies with mPEG-modified host cells in other viruses models demonstrated some efficacy with smaller polymers although large polymers were clearly superior [13] . Furthermore, our previous studies on surface charge camouflage and antigenic masking of cell surface epitopes also showed that both short and long chain polymers conferred protection, although large polymers were similarly more effective [9, 12] .",

Because of the dramatic difference in host cell protection seen between the 2 and 20 kDa mPEG polymers, our findings may provide some insight as to the size of the RSV receptor. When 2 kDa mPEG is grafted to the cell surface it will produce an mPEG zone of exclusion that extends approximately 6 nm above the surface [27] . In contrast, 20 kDa mPEG will project w50 nm from the surface (theoretical estimate based on [27] ), therefore, a much deeper mPEG zone of exclusion is created. Given the differing efficacies of the two polymer lengths, it is likely that the RSV receptor extends more than 6 nm above the cell surface, but does not extend past 50 nm. Thus, the RSV receptor would be effectively hidden by the 20 kDa polymer, but remain unprotected by the 2 kDa polymer.",

Thus, it is probable that the direct mPEG-modification of polarized nasal epithelial cell will confer protection in vivo. Application of a viscous, activated mPEG gel to the nasal cavity will sufficiently modify the epithelial cells within a 3-5 minute exposure [13] to yield an effective broad spectrum anti-viral barrier. As previously noted, this anti-viral prophylaxis is effective against both enveloped and non-enveloped viruses. However, future in vivo studies will be necessary to determine if prophylactic therapy with an mPEG-based therapeutic would provide enhanced protection against RSV-mediated disease relative to current immunoglobulin based prophylactic therapies.

Interestingly, while 2-20 kDa polymers demonstrated efficacy when modifying the RSV particle itself, only long chain polymers conferred protection against RSV when derivatizing the target cells. This polymer size effect was not due to a size difference between RSV (150-300 nm) and HeLa cells (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) (19) (20) (21) (22) (23) (24) mm in diameter), but potentially reflects the size of the currently unknown RSV receptor as short chain polymers were effective against other viruses [20, 28] . Hence, our findings suggest that activated mPEGbased anti-viral therapies must take into consideration both the known and unknown interactions between the virus and host cell. This may be most readily accomplished using long chain polymers only, or by using a combination of long and short chain polymer species. Thus, this study further supports the potential clinical utility of mPEG grafting to host cells as a new broad spectrum, antiviral prophylactic therapy.",

As shown, short chain polymers and SVA-linker chemistry exhibited enhanced efficacy at lower grafting concentrations.

(A) Anti-viral effect of RSV modification using three different linker chemistries coupled to a 5 kDa polymer. mPEG-modification of RSV prevented infection (i.e., syncytia formation) in a dose-dependent manner with SVAmPEG showing enhanced protection relative to SC-and CmPEG. Insert: binding of mPEG-RSV to target cells was visualized by immunofluorescence staining 90 min post-challenge at 4 C (to prevent internalization) with an MOI of 0.5. (B) Comparison of 2 and 5 kDa SCmPEG, and 2, 5 and 20 kDa SVAmPEG-modification of Long Strain A RSV. As discussed, SVAmPEG was superior to SCmPEG in preventing infection by polymer modified virus. Short chain polymers, especially using the SCmPEG, were statistically superior to long chain polymers.
