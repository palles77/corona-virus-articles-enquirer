It is useful to distinguish two kinds of behaviour. One can be termed stability, which represents the ability of a system to return to an equilibrium state after a temporary disturbance; the more rapidly it returns and the less it fluctuates, the more stable it would be. But there is another property, termed resilience, that is a measure of the persistence of systems and of their ability to absorb change and disturbance and still maintain the same relationships between populations or state variables.",

These intertwined SESs are assumed to be complex adaptive systems (CASs), i.e., they have the capacity to self-organize and adapt based on past experience and changing conditions, and are characterized by nonlinear dynamics that may generate uncertainties regarding system behavior (Norberg and Cumming, 2008) . Consequently, in SES the resilience approach to change involves not only recovery from unexpected shocks and avoiding undesirable thresholds or tipping points, but also the capacity to adapt to ongoing change and fundamentally transform SES if necessary (Walker et al., 2004; Folke et al., 2010) . The resilience approach is considered to lie within the broad emerging field of sustainability science, which studies the interactions between nature and society for long-lasting human well-being without compromising the social, economic and environmental foundations.",

The fact that several crops contribute to the provision of food and can be substituted for each other provides redundancy in food supply for these farmers. It is known that different crop types or species often respond differently to disturbances such as drought or disease (response diversity) and hence simultaneous failure of all crops is unlikely. Therefore, in this case the redundancy and diversity in food supply for these farmers enhance the resilience of this particular provisioning ecosystem service.",

The existence of a variety of organizational forms such as government department, nongovernmental organization and community organization with overlapping domains of authority can provide both redundancy and response diversity in governing or regulating the usage of ecosystem services. In regulating the use of a particular ecosystem service, if different organizations all play a similar role, redundancy is present because the regulatory function will continue even if one or more of the organizations become dysfunctional. As organizations with different sizes, cultures, funding mechanisms and internal structures are likely to respond in different ways to various socioecological challenges, these differences between organizational forms and structures naturally lead to response diversity (Williamson, 1985; Ostrom, 2005) . Hence, if managed properly, the functional redundancy and response diversity in the social governance system are likely to enhance the system's adaptive capacity and resilience for maintaining ecosystem services and dealing with disturbance and change.",

            "text": "Several issues concerning diversity and redundancy should be addressed. It is known that in some SESs, high redundancy and low response diversity may coexist. This happens when there are many system elements contributing to a particular ecosystem service, but all the elements have similar structures either by design (e.g., human institutions or activities) or due to environmental or historical constraints. This kind of system may function well when change and disturbance occur within the traditional range of variation experienced by the system, and thus resilience is expected for the provision of ecosystem services. However, when facing new types of disturbance, such as those caused by climate change, the system is likely to be vulnerable because of the lack of options available for responding to the new challenges (Janssen et al., 2007) . Also, a very high level of diversity and redundancy can sometimes have negative impacts on the resilience of ecosystem services, because it increases the possibility for inactivity within some aspects of SES. In management organizations, high redundancy may hinder governance functions for ecosystem services, because it tends to increase not only administrative costs, but also the potential for power struggles and contradictory regulations that are known to compromise the ability of governance systems to respond effectively to change (Jentoft et al., 2009 ). These problems should be noted when studying diversity and redundancy for enhancing the resilience of ecosystem services in SES. In ecological systems, there is less evidence of negative influences of high diversity and redundancy on system resilience to change and disturbance.

Similarly, in disturbance experiments, scientists found that recovery of macrobenthic communities was largely determined by the degree of connectivity across metacommunities (Thrush et al., 2008) . Well-connected habitats with no physical barriers facilitate the recolonization of nearby sites, making loss of species due to change and disturbance less likely than poorly-connected habitats.

In general, the possible configurations of an SES are shaped within certain bounds set by the controlling variables, which constitute the basic conditions for the system to develop its underlying structure and processes. For instance, under high rainfall conditions it is typical to find forests, and under low to medium rainfall conditions savannas (tropical grassland with scattered trees) are normally found.

In these situations, whether a particular place has savanna or forest at a particular point in time depends on the past configuration of the system, or more specifically, depends on which feedback processes have been dominant. With some disturbance, such as a drought or a large fire, the landscape can even abruptly shift from a forest to a savanna (or from a savanna to a forest with different disturbances), as a result of the change in the feedback processes triggered by the disturbance.

All SESs have limits to how large a shock or how much change they can be exposed to and still recover and keep functioning as before. When critical limits in controlling slow variables are exceeded, the feedbacks that keep the system in a particular configuration are significantly weakened or totally disappear, and thus the system is unable to buffer or absorb the changes. In the example of the forest to savanna shift, a key slow variable is the ratio of grass biomass to woody biomass, which decreases under the pressure of heavy grazing by cattle. When this ratio drops to a critical level there is too little grass to sustain fires that are sufficiently hot to burn and kill shrubs. As the small shrubs grow into trees, the SES will then shift to a forest configuration (Aneries et al., 2002) . Note that in this case, fire is a key reinforcing feedback that maintains the grassy landscape of savannas.",

Consequently, the system is structured and functions in a different way, and produces a different set of ecosystem services. In ecological systems, such large, persistent and often abrupt system reorganizations are known as regime shifts. Regime shifts often occur suddenly, because the feedback mechanisms buffer change and leave little observable change to the system until the onset of regime shift. Similarly, changes in controlling slow variables, and thus the gradual erosion of resilience in the system, are frequently being ignored. Hence, a critical aspect of enhancing resilience in an SES is concerned with improving the management of slow variables and feedbacks to ensure that the system remains in a configuration that produces desired ecosystem services.",

Recent examples of transformations in ecosystem management suggest that changes in underlying mental models that acknowledge the characteristics of SES as CAS can lead to improvements in the resilience of ecosystem services. The large-scale rezoning of Australia's Great Barrier Reef, one of the seven natural wonders of the world, is a case in point. This management change was driven by increased recognition of the importance of connectivity, nonlinear change and multiscale interactions in coral reef systems (Olsson et al., 2008) . By introducing spatial restrictions on fishing and other uses of the reef, the rezoning aimed at enhancing the resilience of ecosystem functions to a range of disturbances including temperature anomalies and cyclones. CAS thinking in this approach is evident in two aspects: maintaining connectivity within the reef system and increasing the system's capacity to absorb large disturbances; and importantly, recognizing the values and perspectives of different reef users. After decades of implementing this precautionary and adaptive management approach, improvements in the resilience of the reef's marine ecosystems to climate-change impacts were evident through ecological monitoring and experimentation, but challenges remain as the problem domain has become increasingly complex (Brodie and Waterhouse, 2012; Brodie, 2014) .",

Also, as a CAS approach implies a change in management paradigm from a focus on causality and control within short time-frames, to a focus on coping with change and uncertainty over longer timescales, ineffective operations in this management shift may occur. In addition, an incorrect attitude toward a CAS mental model may regard it as a static management form, rather than a dynamic management approach that pursues continued learning, experimentation and adaptation.

A study of five US community-based forestry organizations involved in collaborative ecological monitoring programs found that comonitoring activities led to single-loop learning, which identified changes in recommendations for optimal treatment of invasive weed species, and double-loop learning, which led to the realization of the significance and need for sustainable harvesting of mushrooms. These learning processes together altered social attitudes and assumptions toward adaptive management of SES. In the case of Australia's Great Barrier Reef, the change of perceptions among politicians and the public from viewing the reef as pristine to viewing it as a severely threatened ecosystem cleared obstacles for stronger protection of the reef and its associated ecosystem services (Olsson et al., 2008) . Both of these shifts in perceptions occurred through processes of learning. These experiences highlight the role of learning in potentially supporting the resilience of ecosystem services.",

All 155 passengers and crew aboard the Airbus A320 successfully evacuated from the partially submerged airframe as it sank into the river; they were rescued by nearby boats. The incident came to be known as the \"Miracle on the Hudson,\" which occurred when the plane turned into a flock of Canadian geese about two minutes after takeoff, at about 3000 ft (912 m). Several of these huge birds were sucked into the twin engines, causing both engines to quickly lose power. As the aircraft lost altitude, the flight deck crew decided that the plane could not reach the closest airfield. They therefore diverted to the nearby Hudson River and executed a controlled water landing, about 3 minutes after losing power, saving all on board.",

From flight time limitations to fatigue risk management system (FRMS)-a way toward resilience (Cabon et al., 2011) Fatigue is known to be a major risk for safety in aviation. The flight and duty time limitations employed in civil aviation are a traditional approach to prevent fatigue through the regulation of duty hours. However, besides the inherent rigidity of regulations from an operational point of view, this method often fails to take into account all the complex dimensions of fatigue. In order to cope with this complexity, FRMSs are progressively emerging. Rather than setting absolute duty time limitations, an FRMS approach evaluates each operation in terms of fatigue risk. The International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO, 2011) defines an FRMS as \"a data-driven means of continuously monitoring and maintaining fatigue-related safety risks, based upon scientific principles and knowledge as well as operational experience that aims to ensure relevant personnel are performing at adequate levels of alertness.\"",

Some suggestions on the overall monitoring process are given below, including four scenarios for developing a coherent strategy for monitoring fatigue risk: a. \"Continuous\" mode: In this \"basic\" mode, there is continuous feedback from the systematic monitoring on the risk matrix. For example, a risk that was not identified in the risk matrix is added after specific events are identified through air safety reports.",

Proactive mode: In this mode, a focused monitoring is triggered after a significant change (e.g., introduction of a new route, schedule change). The risk matrix is updated on the basis of the results. d. Reactive mode: In this mode, a focused monitoring is triggered because of a significant change of an indicator of the systematic monitoring, e.g., frequency of air safety reports and associated aircrew fatigue report forms increased in the last months on a specific roster. The implementation of FRMS requires a combination of tools and methods in order to manage the complexity of the impact of crew fatigue on their safety performance. FRMS can be seen as a concrete way to engineer resilience because it requires the organization to adjust its functioning by reintroducing safety managed by humans in addition to safety controlled by regulations. 2. Practices for noticing and dealing with the critical-a case study from the maintenance of power plants (Lay, 2011) In high-risk, high-pressure complex work such as the maintenance of power plants, quality and safety incidents can happen and sometimes be extremely costly for both the service provider and the customer. Thus, consistent high-quality job performance with few incidents can be the most important differentiating factor when selecting a service provider. Conventional safety and quality programs are often limited in scope and tend to be micro-focused on specific, historical incidents or trends. Principles of resilience theories can be applied to design a broad, proactive strategy for noticing signs of a critical situation and moving into different actions to reduce the risk in order to improve performance in line with the plan.",

Through workshops with experienced project managers and operational support staff, signs that an outage could be approaching an out-of-control situation or risk profile change were hypothesized.

Cognitive strategies in emergency and abnormal situations training-implications for resilience in air traffic control (ATC) (Malakis and Kontogiannis, 2011) The management of emergencies and abnormal situations (EAS) in the ATC system entails substantial challenges for air traffic controllers. The fundamental assumption behind refresher training is to provide air traffic controllers with the required skills and knowledge to meet successfully a wide range of challenges imposed by EAS. Using cognitive systems engineering principles, a set of cognitive and team strategies was used to explore patterns of resilience in dyadic teams of operational controllers during real and simulated emergencies in a major European Area Control center. The investigation of real incidents revealed operational problems that were different from those encountered during refresher training. This case study presents initial findings with the potential of providing insights into cultivating sources of resilience that will supplement current refresher training.",

Recognition: to timely and accurately detect early signs of an impending emergency and play out mentally the progression of events c. Managing uncertainty: to assemble and assess a model of the situation and establish safety-related goals d. Planning: to employ standard and/or contingency planning for the unfolding situation e. Managing workload: to timely and accurately organize the required tasks and respond to interruptions and distractions f. Team coordination and communication g. Error management and task management Based on the results of refresher training programs, it is concluded that these failuresensitive cognitive strategies provide important practical examples of the potential for resilience at two levels. First, they provide insights on how adaptations by controllers in the form of cognitive strategies are employed to support resilience in the case of safety-critical events. Second, these cognitive strategies are used as building blocks in the development of advanced safety training programs with the aim of cultivating sources of resilience in the ATC system.",

The ability to handle multiple goals involves the use of both downward and upward resilience traits to address potential conflicts. Here, downward resilience means that macrolevel directions and solutions prepare for resilience through clear goal structures, infrastructure, and procedures that handle the trade-offs between safety and efficiency. Upward resilience means that decisions made at the microlevel in a system reflect a commitment to safety in case of goal conflicts. Changes, caused either by external or internal drivers, may alter these resilience traits by introducing loss of oversight. Changes made at the macrolevel of the system might have unintended consequences on the microlevel, and vice versa.",

In a trade-off situation, this may result in over-reliance on the individual's judgment-at the expense of cautious prudence. Technicians and airport operators might rely too heavily on experience and knowledge, thus taking unnecessary chances without fully embracing the body of rules. Interrelations necessitate an exchange of knowledge across professions. The tension between downward and upward resilience in the aviation system studied is balanced by a strong professionalism throughout the system, which functions as a buffer and makes safety goals prevalent over production goals. To uphold this art of balancing, it is crucial to develop strong but flexible goal rules at the macrolevel to demonstrate a commitment to safety that microlevel actors find trustworthy. At points of intensified production pressure and higher organizational tempo, extra investments in sources of resilience are required to keep production/safety trade-offs from sliding out-of-balance. In other words, safety investments are most important when least affordable (Woods, 2006) . 3.

An evolvable system may perform changes to the system, decreasing its level of performance or reliability for a specific time range (1) to compensate for faults or (2) during exceptional circumstances (graceful degradation). In other words, a resilient system must have the ability to be adaptable, understanding adaptability as the ability to evolve while executing. Hence, adaptability is a subset of evolvability and requires the ability to anticipate changes prior to the occurrence of the resulting damage. Therefore, a resilient architecture must possess different mechanisms to acquire both attributes: (1) static predesign fault-tolerant techniques (robust) and (2) dynamic techniques (elastic) that may be achieved with the ability to reconfigure elements of the system (reconfiguration).

Taking into consideration all these attributes, resilience is defined as follows: Fig. 2.3 illustrates the different attributes and measures of resilience. As seen, most of them are important design principles of traditional computer systems. For clarity, the definitions of reliability, safety, security, and performability as discussed here are given below: Reliability: Reliability R(t) is the probability that a system or component will perform its intended function (without failure) over the entire interval [1, t] under specified environmental and operating conditions. Safety: In safety-critical systems, safety describes the absence of catastrophic failures for users and the environment when a failure takes place. Security: Security is the concurrent existence of three attributes: integrity, maintainability and availability. Integrity can be defined as the absence of improper system state alterations. Maintainability refers to the ease and rapidity with which, following a failure, a repairable system can be restored to a specific operational condition. Availability can be simply defined as \"readiness for correct service\" (Avizienis et al., 2004) .",

In addition, big complex systems are more prone to faults, thus lowering reliability. G Reliability: The highest reliability of individual components is preferable, but always keeping in mind the cost efficiency of its implementation. G Redundancy: Deliberate introduction of HW and software redundancy provides the required level of reconfigurability to reach performance and reliability goals. G Reconfigurability: Apart from the simplicity, reliability and deliberate introduction of redundancy, it is essential to achieve balance between performance, reliability, and power. Reconfigurability serves three main purposes: performance, reliability, and power awareness.
