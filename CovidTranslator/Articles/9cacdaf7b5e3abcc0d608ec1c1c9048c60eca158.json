Forging such connections will help drive the development of mathematical models to better understand and predict both pathogen behavior and the epidemiology of infectious diseases, including malaria. However, the datasets that can aid in identifying these links and models are vast and not amenable to simple, reductionist, and univariate analyses. These datasets require data mining in order to identify the truly important measurements that best describe clinical and molecular observations. Moreover, these datasets typically have relatively few samples due to experimental limitations (particularly for human studies or in vivo animal experiments), making data mining extremely difficult. Here, after first providing a brief overview of common strategies for data reduction and identification of relationships between variables for inclusion in mathematical models, we present a new generalized strategy for performing these data reduction and relationship inference tasks. Our approach emphasizes the importance of robustness when using data to drive model development, particularly when using genome-scale, small-sample in vivo data. We identify the use of appropriate feature reduction combined with data permutations and subsampling strategies as being critical to enable increasingly robust results from network inference using high-dimensional, low-observation data.",

Plasmodium vivax infections are typically characterized by fever spikes every 48 h, but the shorter life cycle of P. knowlesi typically manifests as a daily spike in fever [1] . Around 10% of P. falciparum infections result in severe malaria, with somewhere between 10% and 50% of those severe cases being fatal [2] , while P. vivax infections may more rarely cause severe malaria [3] . Within the same species, specific strains of the parasite can be quite different, causing (for example) varying efficiencies of vector infection (and thus of disease transmission) [4] or strain-specific resistance to certain classes of drugs [5; 6] . All of these parasite variations are on the backdrop of host variations, which can have a tremendous impact on the presentation of the disease even between different individuals infected by isogenic parasites. Complicating the situation even further is that all of the above factors (whether related to host, parasite, or vector) are only things already known to be key in the disease, with potentially numerous additional critical factors that we just have not discovered yet.",

One critical question, even if by virtue of its primacy in the process of developing models, is: what variables should be included in the model? As suggested above, a wealth of proteomics, metabolomics, and other measurements can provide the data that can help to build an effective model, but sifting through the large volume of measurements that do not correlate to the phenomenon of interest to identify the ones that do is a monumental task requiring appropriate statistical treatment. Even supposing that the right variables to include in a mathematical model could be identified, the notion of how to include these variables is the next significant task. One may know that a specific gene is important in a process, but that does not sufficiently inform the mathematical model. Does that gene affect only one other molecule (variable) in the system? If so, which variable does it affect? If it affects multiple variables, how many does it affect, and which ones? And then beyond this, if one knows which interactions to include, there is still the open question of the appropriate functional form to represent this interaction.",

These models may be on a molecular scale, indicating transcriptional or other regulation within a pathogen or indicating the interactions between host and pathogen biology. They may also be on a much larger scale, capturing epidemiological dynamics as a function of key aspects of the hosts, pathogens, and vectors. In either case, it is crucial that the methods used to identify the variables and relationships to be included in the model are as robust and accurate as possible. This is particularly relevant for cases where taking a large number of samples is not feasible, particularly in vivo clinical studies involving infected humans in need of treatment and non-human primate experiments where both cohort size and sampling frequency are limited on ethical grounds. One must extract as much information as possible in as reliable a way as possible with a comparatively small number of observations.",

We consider this task particularly in the context of systems where we expect to have a fairly small number of observations with significant biological variability. We present a unique approach that uses clustering to reduce the dimensionality of a dataset, concatenation of clustered genes to increase the effective number of observations, and permutation and cross-validation analysis to ensure that the results of network inference are trustworthy for the purposes of modeling and not disproportionately influenced by random variation. Taken together, this represents an efficient and reasonable approach to drive the generation or improvement of mathematical models in infectious disease research.",

Methods include principal component analysis (PCA), partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), and numerous variations thereof that reduce the original variable space to a few composite variables [7; 8] . In the ideal case, samples from the same group are close to each other in the reduced feature space, and the weight of the original variables in these key composite variables can be used to drive further downstream interpretation and analysis, including ontological analyses like enrichment analysis. Other methods for group classification tasks (e.g., support vector machines or artificial neural networks) can create classifiers capable of separating two sample classes, though with potentially increased difficulty in interpreting the biological meaning of the mathematical representations in the inferred classifier.",

In this approach, variables deemed unimportant in early model development are considered candidates for elimination from the model, with progressively more parsimonious models developed. Lasso can be embedded in regression models to minimize the number of parameters included [13] : a full regression model built on all variables is decreased in complexity by using smaller constraint parameters in the Lasso, eliminating variables with insignificant impact on the regression.

These directed relationships are quite amenable to inclusion in mathematical models, as they give a reasonable starting point for how to include a set of relationships in a model. However, our selection of Bayesian networks does have some significant drawbacks based on the type of data to which we will apply them. First, Bayesian networks can be computationally expensive to infer for large numbers of variables; in the limit of tens of thousands of variables, they may be nearly intractable.

We note a key choice in the use of these clusters: rather than using the clusters as starting points within which we would infer networks of relationships, we will instead use them as a way to separate out diverse sets of variables which can be treated as one \"node\" in the network inference problem. In this way, we minimize the redundancy between variables and hopefully maximize the relevance of inferred relationships.

Any relevant datapreprocessing step (Step 1 in Figure 1 ), typically specific to the experimental technique generating the data matrix (e.g., transcriptomics vs. metabolomics), must first be performed. Depending on the data, such steps may include filtering outlier or low-confidence data, imputation of missing data, and scaling or normalization of the data to make them more suitable and uniform for later analysis. The preprocessed data then pass through the feature selection step (Step 2). As stated above, we choose to focus on clustering methods to reduce the feature space. Many algorithms could be selected, including K-means clustering [17] , hierarchical clustering [15; 16] , quality-based or quality-threshold clustering [46; 47] , modulated modularity clustering (MMC [48] ), or others. In Section 4.1, we describe in more detail why we choose to use quality-based clustering for our feature selection. After clustering, the original high-dimensional feature space is reduced from M features to M 1 clusters, where M 1 << M. A training dataset is then created by selecting m features as representatives from each cluster (Step 3). If m = 1, only one feature is selected to represent each cluster and the training dataset is an M 1 \u00d7P matrix. If m > 1, the observations of these m features will be concatenated together and the training dataset will be an M 1 \u00d7(mP) matrix. We hypothesize that this feature concatenation is reasonable because the variables found in a given cluster are highly correlated with each other and have very similar temporal profiles; they can thus be considered to be separate observations of the profile represented by that cluster. (The use of quality-based clustering in Step 2 further supports the validity of this hypothesis.) As the data are usually continuous rather than discrete, a data discretization step (Step 4) is applied to facilitate fast and efficient Bayesian network structure inference.",

Information regarding the relationship between variables thus is not taken into account in these methods, and may be a likely casualty of the discretization process. However, in the context of the applications described here, it is these very dependencies between variables that we seek. It thus is important to retain as much information as possible regarding the information flow between variables during discretization, and so we choose to use a more complex discretization method, namely information-preserving discretization [49] , so that the variables are not considered in isolation. Specifically, a set of real-valued variables is initially discretized into D discretization levels where D is a large number (for instance, D = P if P \u2264 100, or D = 100 if P > 100, for the purposes of saving computational cost).

Of the three algorithms defined above, the online implementation of MMC has a threshold of 1000 variables for the clustering, so we use the top 1000 significant (as determined by F statistics) variables for the clustering for all three methods. k-means clustering is a widely-used and straightforward approach to generating clusters from data. Given some parameter k, the algorithm looks to identify k distinct clusters of variables that minimize the within-cluster sum of squares distances: where x is the vector of all observations for a given variable, S i is a cluster (set) of variables, S is the set of all S i , and \u03bc i is the vector mean of the variables in cluster S i across each sample. That is, it looks to make k clusters that are as compact in the full-dimensional space as possible. Though this is an np-hard problem, there are a variety of tools available for heuristic or approximate solutions of the problem. One of the key difficulties, though, is defining k in cases where there is no a priori justification for the selection of a specific k value. It is thus common practice to do the clustering with multiple values of k and use a scalar quantity called the Figure Of Merit (FOM) to indicate how \"good\" the current clustering is [50] . This FOM is calculated in a jackknife fashion by applying the clustering to all but one experimental conditions (samples) in a dataset and using the left-out observation to assess the predictive power of the current clustering.

We note that the presence of these clusters is not merely an artifact of the algorithm. Clustering a dataset where all measurements within a variable are permuted returned zero clusters. Clustering a dataset where for each variable, the time points for each animal were permuted returned only one non-singleton cluster containing two variables.

Among them, 79 transcripts (~95% of the largest cluster found with d = 0.3) overlap across the largest clusters found with three different d values.

Not using feature reduction makes the scale of the network inference problem intractable for Bayesian network modeling (in terms of computational time, robustness, and identifiability), and thus necessitates the use of a different class of models or algorithms to identify relationships in the data. We will consider as a representative example the CLR method, briefly explained in Section 2.2, and previously used in multiple systems biology studies of pathogens [21; 22; 23] . We have run CLR with the original data (1000 features \u00d7 35 observations), assuming all features as the possible \"transcription factors\" in the algorithm, meaning that any gene can have a connection to any other gene. With an FDR threshold of 0.05, over a thousand interactions are found. Using different background estimating functions, CLR returned different interaction networks: 6143 interactions found using the \"normal\" function (shown in Figure S3 .a), 6084 interactions found using the \"beta\" function, 6847 interactions found using the heuristic strategy described in Gardner's paper [20] , and 1087 interactions found using the \"epanechnikov\" (finite support) kernel density estimator (shown in Figure S3 .b). The dependence of the number of connections on the background estimating function is not ideal, but is fairly robust in all but the \"epanechnikov\" case. More important, though, is the scale of the network: with over 1000, and usually over 6000, interactions discovered, the generated information is still too voluminous to use in driving the development of mathematical models. This analysis would at best be a first step before further, likely graph topology-based, analysis of the results to continue to search for the few most important variables and connections in the system. (We note that using CLR on the feature-reduced dataset is not successful; at the same FDR threshold, there are no significant connections in the network for any of the background estimating functions, presumably due to insufficient sampling to form a background distribution from which to distinguish true connections.)",

Each cluster becomes one feature, which requires selecting a representative for the cluster. Previous methods using clustering as a feature selection step have used an average or centroid gene as a representative of the cluster, or the gene closest to the centroid, so as to ensure that \"real\" data is being used rather than synthetic data that is not present in the original dataset [51] . To investigate the effect of choosing different representatives, we created 4 different datasets by choosing the centroid (Dataset 1), the closest gene to the centroid (Dataset 2), the second closest gene to the centroid (Dataset 3), and the third closest gene to the centroid (Dataset 4) as the representative of each cluster. Each dataset consists of 26 features with 35 observations (where m = 1 and P = 35 in the data processing workflow of Figure 1 ). The four different datasets then in turn went through the same data discretization step (Step 4) and BN structure learning step (specifically, the sparse candidate method [37] for network inference in Step 5)) with the same subset sampling strategy (N = 1000).

For typical proof-of-principle approaches for Bayesian network inference algorithms, the number of samples used is typically hundreds or thousands; for instance, a previous study using the K2 inference algorithm explored the use of sample sizes from 100 to 10,000, concluding that 3,000 was sufficient to reproduce the results of having all 10,000 observations [33] . For the case of in vivo experiments in general, and non-human primate experiments in particular, sample sizes that large are experimentally and ethically infeasible. As a result, random noise in the representative genes seems to drive the identification of connections between clusters rather than the signal that those genes are supposed to represent. To compensate for sample size limitations, we selected multiple features from each cluster and concatenated their observations together to create pseudogenes with greatly increased numbers of observations. For our first analyses, we chose to use ten genes per cluster, yielding for each cluster a new feature with 35 \u00d7 10 = 350 \"observations\" instead of the single representative gene with 35 observations previously used for network inference. We chose to use 10 genes since this would be the maximum number of genes possible for all of our 26 large clusters; in addition, the resultant number of observations is more in line with sample sizes previously demonstrated to be reasonably effective for Bayesian network inference.",

The overlap among the discovered interactions across datasets has increased markedly, though. Nearly 80% of the connections identified in Dataset 5 are present in its permuted version, Dataset 6, substantially better than the best overlap from the single-gene case, which was 20%. This result suggests that the network inference is not sensitive to gene order in the pseudo-gene. Moreover, there is substantial overlap between Dataset 5 and Datasets 7 and 8, suggesting that small changes in the information content do not substantially affect the inferred networks. Dataset 9 exhibits the least amount of overlap with Dataset 5; this outcome is intuitive, as the features are not only the least representative of each cluster, but also the least similar to each other, thus adding the most noise to the data. However, this worst-case scenario is still better than the best example from the singlegene representative analysis, indicating the improved robustness imparted by using multiple genes as representatives of a cluster.

Accordingly, we implemented another round of network inference using pseudo-genes containing five genes per cluster to see if fewer features in a pseudo-gene could still provide robust network inference. To compare the performance of the five-gene representation to that of the ten-gene representation, we generated six more analogous datasets by using the five features closest to the cluster centroid (Dataset 11), the five features closest to the cluster centroid with the feature order randomly shuffled per cluster (Dataset 12), the second-through sixth-closest genes to the cluster centroid (Dataset 13), the third-through seventh-closest genes to the cluster centroid (Dataset 14), the five genes furthest from the centroid (Dataset 15), and five randomly selected genes (Dataset 16).

This very small relative change in probability would likely not significantly affect one's expectation of whether this is a real connection, but would have the effect of completely eliminating it from consideration in further analyses. If multiple permutation datasets are being considered, then each permutation would carry the risk of eliminating a possibly real interaction through a relatively small change and a threshold effect. While this would certainly indicate that such connections may rank as less likely than the more conserved inferred connections, it seems undesirable to exclude more connections from further considerations due strictly to the effects of noise near a threshold border. This is particularly true in the context of all of the effort already expended to identify higher-confidence connections, combined with the need to provide as thorough an exploration of network space as possible in order to drive the development of accurate mathematical models. In these cases, Inference Selection Strategy 2, which averages the probabilities across all datasets being compared, may be desirable for being reasonably inclusive but still selective for highly likely interactions.",

As listed in Table 4 , the performances of the four datasets with the feature order randomly shuffled are quite similar. However, it is evident that adding small perturbations to the data as induced by the feature order permutation method may cause different connections to be removed via thresholding for different pairs of datasets. Accordingly, when looking at the intersection of all datasets, only 14 of the connections originally present in Dataset 5 remain in the analysis, even though there are quite a few more connections that may have just barely missed the threshold in only one of the permutations. The connections present in all four permuted datasets are represented by the solid edges in the network in Figure 5 . Using Inference Selection Strategy 2, on the other hand, identifies 19 connections as consistent across all of the permutations. The additional five edges, represented in Figure  5 with dotted lines, compensate for any potential threshold effect in one dataset by even higher likelihood of presence in other datasets. So, while Inference Selection Strategy 1 may be useful if a more restrictive set of connections is desired, we believe that the second strategy provides a better balance of restrictiveness with inclusiveness and is potentially a more useful candidate network for downstream biological inference and future modeling purposes.",

Although some computational methods (e.g. CLR) can efficiently learn networks from large genome-scale datasets, the identified networks are usually far too large and dense to directly inform later mathematical modeling. The necessity of developing approaches for exacting a concise and meaningful network that could benefit mathematical modeling becomes imperative for such large-scale datasets.

Choosing multiple features from each cluster greatly improves the robustness of Bayesian network learning results, with more features (e.g. m = 10) performing slightly better than fewer features (e.g. m = 5). However, choosing fewer features allows more clusters to be considered, so there is a compromise between the learning robustness and the breadth of the analysis.",

Discretization maintains the structure of the data and has the effect of reducing the \"resolution\" of the data from its original form, but it also reduces the number of samples required for effective Bayesian network inference. We used a more complex discretization method than the commonly-used equal-interval or equal-quantile discretization so as to maintain as much mutual information in the dataset as possible. For the network learning step, we used a subset sampling strategy with 10% of the samples randomly omitted for N independent but overlapping subsets (e.g. N = 1000). We then used permutations of the pseudo-gene construction to identify the connections least susceptible to individual-gene noise and thus most likely to be real, and identified two similar inference selection strategies that provide slightly different levels of conservatism in selecting the most likely connections.",

            "text": "There are certainly limitations to the system described herein. First, we restrict ourselves to only clusters of at least a certain size, and not every critical gene may have so many similarly regulated genes. This limitation is ultimately a result of the selection of Bayesian networks as a modeling approach: Bayesian networks require significant numbers of observations for reliable inference and became less computationally tractable as they get bigger. These limitations are significant, particularly in light of the obviously limited number of samples (observations) available from genome-scale experiments. However, this tradeoff was viewed as reasonable in comparison to the limitations of full genome-scale networks, which are often dense and difficult to interpret. Other limitations of our work include incomplete consideration of all of the factors that may affect downstream results. For transcriptome sequencing, for example, assumptions in mapping reads to genes, splice isoforms, or other transcriptional units may affect the information content of the data and ultimately the inference. For other types of data, the methods used for missing value imputation may also be a significant factor. It is critical to consider these steps as well when defining an overall data analysis and interpretation pipeline. Finally, we have not yet considered the task of biological interpretation of the results. Enrichment analyses might be used to characterize which of the candidate interactions are most likely given previous biological knowledge or to confirm that the overall network seems reasonable. We have restricted focus here to only the statistical treatment of the data, with the expectation that robust results are more likely to be real rather than artifacts.",

Such applications will ultimately be best informed and driven by developing mathematical models that capture our knowledge of the system and make predictions to guide future experiments. The framework presented here is a useful, efficient, and reasonable way to help identify the most relevant information from genomescale experimental datasets that can help drive both the modeling and later experimental follow-ups necessary to validate our understanding of the system. Specifically, we believe that the proposed method will be useful to identify the factors that may impact infectious disease, whether in the host or the pathogen, and will help lead to improved models and understanding of infectious disease, whether on a molecular or an epidemiological level.",

Histograms are shown for all clusters with at least ten genes, as found by quality-based clustering with d = 0.3. All clusters have extremely high internal correlation with few or no outliers; x-axis scale is the same as in Figure 2 . The y-axis represents the percentage of robust connections, which is calculated as the total number of edge occurrences found across all subsamples that are retained at a given threshold, expressed as a percentage of all edge occurrences ever observed in the subsampling scheme for a given cluster representation scheme and for all relevant datasets, even if inferred for only one subsample for one dataset. The solid line represents the inference results using the single-gene representation of clusters, for Datasets 1 through 4; the dashed and dotted lines represent using 5 and 10 genes, respectively, for each cluster to form pseudo-genes for use in network inference and using Datasets 11 through 14 and 5 through 8, respectively. For any cutoff enforcing reasonably robust results across resampling replicates, the multiple-gene representation of clusters is far more reliable. ",
