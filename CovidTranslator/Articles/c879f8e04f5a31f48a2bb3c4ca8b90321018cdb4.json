The incubation period of SARS ranges from 2 to 16 days, with a mean incubation time of 6.4 days [5] . Infected people develop influenza-like symptoms with the lung as target organ (e.g., high-grade fever, chills, myalgia, headache, and dyspnea), resulting in an up to 40% mortality rate, especially in older patients [6, 7] . As evidenced by sporadic cases reported in late 2003 and in 2004 (http://www.wpro.who.int/sars/docs/pressreleases/pr 31122003. asp and http://www.who.int/csr/don/2004 05 18a /en/index. html), SARS-CoV still remains a constant threat for epidemic outbreaks.

Similarly, immunization with the IBV large S protein induced virus neutralizing antibodies, but the percentage of protected chicken was between 50 and 90%. On the other hand, initial immunization studies with the IBV NC protein applied as protein or DNA vaccine also induced protective immunity, obviously provided by CD8 Tcells and possibly by local antibodies [11, 12] . Similar observations have been reported also from other coronavirus infections in animals [13, 14] .

When immunizing with the NC protein by the mucosal route, vaccine formulations contained 0.5 g of a pegylated synthetic derivative of the TLR2/6 agonist MALP-2 (macrophage-activating lipopeptide of 2 kDa from Mycoplasma fermentans) as mucosal adjuvant [17, 18] .

Serial 2-fold dilutions of pooled sera in PBS/1% BSA were added (100 l/well), and plates were incubated for 2 h at 37 \u2022 C. After four washes, secondary biotinylated antibodies were added followed by 1 h incubation at 37 \u2022 C. After six washes, 50 l/well (1:1000) of peroxidase conjugated streptavidin (Pharmingen) was added, and plates were further incubated for 45 min at room temperature. After final six washes, the substrate ABTS [2,2 -azino-bis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid)] in 0.1 M citrate-phosphate buffer containing 0.1% H 2 O 2 was added, and plates were incubated for 30 min at room temperature. The end-point titers were expressed as the last dilution giving an A 405 of 0.1 U above the A 405 of negative controls. The IgG isotypes present in serum samples were determined by ELISA as previously described [19] , using as secondary antibodies biotinconjugated rat anti-mouse IgG1 or IgG2a (Southern Biotechnology Associates, Birmingham, UK).",

            "text": "The majority of the experimental vaccines recently developed against the SARS-CoV aimed at initiating a sterilizing immunity via virus neutralizing antibodies. This included the use of inactivated SARS virus and the S protein, as well as different delivery systems thereof, such as DNA and viral vectors (Adenovirus, Rabies, Parainfluenzae, MVA-Vaccinia). These animal trials demonstrated the potential of the S protein for promoting the induction of neutralizing antibodies and, in some cases, also protection against viral challenge [23, 24] . Several immunization studies have also been performed with the NC protein of SARS-CoV applied as protein, DNA or in viral vectors (e.g., Adenovirus, MVA). The good immunogenicity of the NC antigen could be shown by the induction of antibody and/or T-cell responses [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] . In this work, we performed a sideby-side comparison of different strategies to optimize the immune responses against the NC protein of the SARS-CoV. The live attenuated MVA vector was used for protein delivery to achieve good and long lasting systemic and local T-cell responses [33] . For the induction of humoral immune responses, recombinant NC protein was co-administered with a systemic or a mucosal adjuvant by different routes (intramuscular and intranasal). Special attempts were also carried out to fine-tune and broaden the elicited responses by combining the different candidates in prime-boost vaccination protocols. The inclusion of MVA-NC in the heterologous prime-boost protocols was based in the well-known capacity of recombinant MVA to boost cellular responses in a previously primed host. Primeboost regimens using different viral vectors expressing the same recombinant antigen proved very efficient in enhancing the target antigen specific immune responses in comparison to homologous vector immunizations, most likely because these approaches circumvent the problem of anti-vector immunity [34] [35] [36] . In this context, priming with NC protein co-administered with a mucosal adjuvant, followed by a boost with MVA-NC appealed as the more promising approach to promote both humoral and cell mediated responses against NC. This would be expected to lead to a better control of viral infection at both mucosal and systemic level.",

However, in mice receiving the prime-boost protocol, the T helper response pattern was switched from a dominant Th2 to a mixed Th1-Th2 respect to animals vaccinated with NC + alum alone. In contrast to that observed at humoral level, significantly stronger proliferative responses in comparison to the control mice receiving MVA alone (P \u2264 0.001) were only observed in animals receiving the prime-boost protocol. The same was true in terms of the observed increment in the number of IFN-\u2425 producing cells. Hence, the MVA-based boost was critical to modulate the elicited immune response towards a mixed Th1/Th2 response pattern, as well as to optimize the cellular responses. Nevertheless, vaccination by the parenteral route was not able to induce relevant amounts of antibodies in the respiratory tract.",

Both protocols were also proven effective in terms of stimulating local production of NC-specific sIgA in the broncho-alveolar lavages of vaccinated mice (P \u2264 0.04). Interestingly, these vaccination protocols were even more effective than the parenteral prime-boost protocols in terms of stimulating proliferative responses (P \u2264 0.001), with the strongest response in mice vaccinated twice with NC + MALP-2. However, when analyzing the cytokine production of splenocytes from immunized mice, a significant increment in the number of IFN-\u2425 producing cells was only observed in mice receiving the heterologous prime-boost protocols respect to the control groups (P \u2264 0.001). Furthermore, the highest increment in the number of IL-2-producing cells in response to antigen stimulation was detected in mice receiving the mucosal formulations, followed by those receiving the parenteral heterologous prime-boost protocol (P \u2264 0.002). As expected, IL-4 production was maximal in mice immunized with NC protein and alum by intramuscular route (P \u2264 0.01). Thus, our data demonstrated that the heterologous prime boost protocol based on intranasal priming with NC + MALP-2 and intramuscular boosting with MVA-NC is able to induce good humoral and cellular immune responses at systemic and mucosal level. The strength of the observed immune responses was similar or even better than that reported in former studies (e.g., using DNA-or Adenovirus-based approaches alone) [27, 30] . Furthermore, these experiments indicate that one MVA-NC boost is enough to stimulate a single NC protein prime, and is clearly superior to a homologous MVA-NC prime/boost [32] .",

            "text": "There is a general consensus that vaccination by the mucosal route offers several advantages over parenteral immunization since mucosal vaccination promotes immune responses at both systemic and mucosal levels, whereas parenteral immunization only stimulates systemic responses. Recently, it has been shown that in fatal SARS cases predominantly alveolar pneumocytes are infected, as demonstrated by the detection of the SARS-CoV nucleoprotein [37] . Thus, the stimulation of an efficient local immune response at the portal of entry is highly desirable for a pathogen like the SARS-CoV. In fact, this strategy can lead not only to protection against disease but also against infection (i.e., colonization), thereby contributing to reduce the risk of horizontal transmission. Although the stimulation of S protein-specific antibody responses seems to be essential in order to protect against SARS infection [24, 38, 39] , there is the possibility of antibody-dependent enhancement and exacerbation of the disease, which in turn underlines the need for alternative vaccines [40] . The use of NC protein as an alternative vaccine approach may also become attractive by the fact that nucleoproteins from different animal coronaviruses share antigenic cross-reactivity, which may be of interest for a vaccine against a \"human\" virus with an animal origin [41] .",

Usually, the production of IFN-\u2425, a Th1 cytokine associated with cell-mediated immunity and resistance to intracellular pathogens, is dramatically increased during SARS-CoV infection, whereas IL-4, the dominant Th2 cytokine, which promotes humoral immunity that protects against extra cellular microbial infections, is decreased after onset of SARS-CoV infection. There is also an up-regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor alpha, IL-1\u00df and IL-6, which might enhance disease outcome [42, 43] . Thus, the stimulation of a Th1 dominant response with increased number of IL-2 and IFN-\u2425 producing cells by the mucosal/systemic protein/MVAbased prime-boost protocol appeals as an additional advantage of this promising vaccination approach.",
