Thus, the goal of this study is to better characterize AM phenotype of allergic asthmatic compared with normal subjects using genomic expression analyses. Microarray analyses were performed with AM isolated from bronchoalveolar lavage. Robust multiarray analysis (RMA) normalization and Smyth's moderated t test were used to select differentially expressed genes. Fifty differentially expressed genes were identified. Nineteen have been classified in categories linked to stress or immune responses and among them; nine are part of the heat shock protein (HSP) family. Difference of expression for three (HSPD1, PRNP, SERPINH1) of the five selected genes were validated using real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Enzymelinked immunosorbent assay was used to measure the protein level of heat shock protein 60 (HSP60), the protein encoded by HSPD1, and showed difference in AM protein level between allergic asthmatic and control subjects. In summary, this study suggests that HSP gene family, particularly HSP60, is involved in AM functions in a context of allergic asthma. These results also support the involvement of AM immune functions in the development of an allergic asthmatic response. \u1b67",

They participate in lung immune homeostasis through phagocytosis and the release of mediators in response to these agents [2] . They also modulate immune response by inhibiting antigen presentation by dendritic cells, T-cell activation, and B-cell antibody production [3, 4] .",

Microarray analyses of gene expression have already demonstrated their effectiveness in the characterization of tissue or cellular phenotype in asthma and other complex traits [10] . One of its principal advantages is to allow the discovery of novel possible pathways as this technique looks at all genes independently of their respective known functions [10] . According to this, gene expression microarrays have been chosen to achieve the principal goal of this study, which was to characterize AM phenotype of allergic asthmatic subjects. Our results demonstrated a possible implication particularly for HSP in the immune functions of AM in asthma physiopathology, as nine HSP were underexpressed by AM of allergic asthmatic subjects.

All subjects were recruited at respiratory specialized clinic and gave their consent for participation. The baseline evaluation included a questionnaire on health status and respiratory conditions, a physical examination, skin prick tests using 26 common aeroallergens (pets, house dust mites, dust, tree pollens, grass pollens, ragweed, molds, and feather) and the measurements of forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV 1 ) and of the dose of methacholine that resulted in a 20% fall in FEV 1 (PC 20 ) . Clinical characteristics of the subjects are given in Table 1 . Asthmatic subjects had positive skin prick tests (at least one positive response, i.e., wheal diameter \u05463 mm at 10 minutes). Table 2 lists the tested allergens and the sensitization profile of the subjects. Asthmatic subjects presented asthma symptoms that required treatment with an inhaled short-acting \u2424 2 -agonist on demand or associated allergic rhinitis symptoms that required a histamine-antagonist on demand. The bronchoscopies and the bronchoalveolar lavages were performed for research purposes only; they were performed as previously described on local anesthesia and using five 60-ml boluses of prewarmed saline solution in the right middle lobe [12] . To improve homogeneity of the samples, bronchoalveolar lavages were performed at the same time of the day and only if subjects did not experience inflammatory or allergen response (e.g., flu or hay fever) during the previous month. Bronchoalveolar lavages were not performed during the pollen season for the sensitized subjects. RNA was available for four subjects per phenotype to run real-time RT-PCR.",

Microarray analysis was performed with Affymetrix Genechip HG-U133A microarrays containing 22,283 oligonucleotide target probes (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). Hybridization and scanning of image were performed at the McGill University and Genome Quebec Innovation Centre (www. genomequebec.mcgill.ca). To minimize technical variability, RNA processing steps (RNA extraction, probe labeling and chip hybridization) were performed in parallel for control and asthmatic samples. Detailed probe synthesis hybridization and washing protocol have been previously described [13] . The scanned images were analyzed using the Microarray Analysis Suite 5.0 (MAS5, Affymetrix) and the raw image files obtained (CEL format) were used for statistical analysis. Analyses were performed with the Affy and Limma packages available in Bioconductor (http://www.bioconductor.org), which uses R language (http://www.R-project.org) [14, 15] . Quality tests to look at artifact or variability among microarrays were done with the Affy package. Probe intensities from the 10 chips were first normalized using robust multi-array analysis (RMA), which comprises background correction, quantile normalization, and median polish steps. Use of the RMA method in conjunction with p value and fold change cut-off (p value \u03fd 0.05 and absolute fold change \u03fe1.50) allowed us to not perform multitesting correction [16, 17] . To even better decrease false discovery rate, Smyth's moderated t test was used instead of standard t test (Limma package) [16] . Mean calculated for all allergic asthmatic subjects of each group.

They were selected according to known functions suggesting a possible involvement in asthma pathogenesis ( Table 3 ). Considering that nine HSP genes are found differentially expressed, a particular interest was given to this family. Indeed, among the nine HSP genes, two genes that were not documented in alveolar macrophages but have known functions possibly linked to asthma development were selected. Of the five genes selected, only CCR1 has been shown to be expressed in AM [20] , but a possible difference of expression linked to asthma has not been documented yet. Real-time RT-PCR showed expression of all five genes in AM from control and asthmatic subjects and confirmed the difference in gene expression between asthmatic and control for three of them: HSPD1, PRNP and SERPINH1 (Fig. 1 ). Real-time RT-PCR data showed that these three genes were significantly underexpressed in AM of asthmatic subjects (2.16-, 1.52-, and 3.63-fold, respectively; p \u03fd 0.05), as observed in microarray data (2.08-and 1.52-fold for two HSPD1 transcripts, and 1.75-and 1.80-fold for PRNP and SERPINH1, respectively; p \u03fd 0.05, Table 3 ).",

This HSP has been recently linked to the regulation of immune response [21] [22] [23] [24] , but its involvement in AM functions has not yet been investigated. Therefore, this gene was selected for subsequent analyses to compare its protein and genetic expression in alveolar macrophages of control and asthmatic subjects. The immunocytochemistry data showed similar expression of HSP60 protein in AM of control and asthmatic subjects (90% \u03ee 5% and 90% \u03ee 4% of positive cells for control and asthmatic subjects, respectively). This result was not surprising, as HSP60 is constitutively expressed in cells for its chaperone activity [25] . However, the result suggested a difference in each cellular protein level instead of a difference in the number of cells expressing the protein (Fig. 2 ). Thus, HSP60 protein level in cell lysates of AM from control and asthmatic subjects was measured using ELISA. HSP60 level was significantly higher in AM of asthmatic subjects (35.0 \u03ee 14.5 ng/ml) compared with controls (15.4 \u03ee 10.8 ng/ml) (Fig. 3 ).

However, as these differences of expression have been validated by a second technique, it suggests that they probably are the result of other mechanisms as modulation above in their respective biologic pathway or epigenetic regulation [29] . Real-time RT-PCR was selected to validate genomic expression data because this technique usually confirm about 87% of microarray results done using RMA analyses [30] . It is consistent with the confirmation of the underexpression of three of the five genes (HSPD1, PRNP, and SERPINH1) in allergic asthmatic compared with control AM, according to the small number of genes tested (Fig. 1) .

First, it stimulates secretion by T cell, regulatory T cell (Treg), and B cell, of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 [21] [22] [23] . Second, HSP60-stimulated Treg also inhibits two proinflammatory cytokine secretion by T cell; tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and IFN-\u2425 [23] . Third, HSP60 has the capacity to inhibit T-cell chemotaxis [24] . It may also have an autocrine effect on AM, as direct binding of this protein on a specific receptor on this cell type has been demonstrated [35] . Consequently, all of these functions support an implication for this protein in immune roles of AM in asthma pathogenesis.

The sample sizes used for the gene expression profiling and the protein level analyses may seem limited. However, they were sufficient to achieve statistical significance between phenotypic groups in both experiments [36, 37] . Furthermore, the use of both robust normalization and cut-offs for p value and fold change in gene expression profile allowed detecting differentially expressed genes with the used sample size [13, 15, 38] . Moreover, the relative uniformity within and between the asthmatic groups is a major strength of the study. Indeed, the good similarity for lung function for all allergic asthmatic subjects included in this study, and the fact that they have comparable medication and allergen sensitization profiles (Tables 1 and 2) , eliminates confounding with regard to asthma medication dosage and atopic status.",

There are three principal reasons for mRNA and protein level discrepancy: post-transcriptional mechanisms, the in vivo half-life of proteins, and the errors and noises in mRNA and protein measurement techniques [39] . Interestingly, Gustavsson et al. have evaluated the half-life of HSP60 in HELA cells to be 37.5 \u03ee 2.7 hours [40] . According to this long half-life, a decrease in HSPD1 mRNA expression might be visible in protein level only several hours later. Moreover, it is documented that protein level can be regulated at transcriptional or at translational level [39] . Proteins turnover that are regulated at transcriptional level shows correlation of 0.89 between protein levels and transcript abundance. However, this correlation is approximately only 0.20 for proteins regulated at the translational level [39] . These data suggest the possibility that HSP60 level can be regulated at the translational level, which could HSP60 protein expression by alveolar macrophages of control and allergic asthmatic subjects. Bronchoalveolar cells of four control subjects and four allergic asthmatic subjects were fixed with PLP-sucrose and immuncytochemistry was done using ABComplex/AP method and Fast-Red coloration with Mayer's hematoxylin counterstaining (magnification \u03eb1,000). Immunocytochemistry for HSP60 expression of (A) isotypic negative control, (B) control subjects, and (C) allergic asthmatic subjects. Results shown are representative. There was no difference in positive alveolar macrophage cell count for HSP60 between control and asthmatic subjects (90% \u03ee 5% and 90 \u03ee 4% of positive cells for control and asthmatic subjects, respectively).
