Over the last four decades ten major stampedes (with 100 fatalities) have occurred at Hajj (Table 1) ; it is believed that, a crane collapse and a stampede disaster during the Hajj 2015 killed over 2000 people [2] . Despite the frequent occurrence of mass disasters at Hajj, pilgrims' awareness and concern about these incidents have not been previously explored. This study assessed Australian pilgrims' risk perception of mass disasters compared to that of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and Ebola during the Hajj ",

The catastrophe in 2015 happened when fewer pilgrims were concerned about disasters indicating that bringing about behavioral change such as through public awareness, social distancing and the prediction of the peak time of congestion are important in avoiding, if not averting, mass casualties [5] . Lack of some pilgrims' awareness about the risk of accidents such as stampedes is concerning, as less prepared pilgrims might be more readily vulnerable to such disasters. Currently there is no official health recommendation on disaster prevention from the Saudi Arabian Ministry of Health, but these findings indicate that such recommendation could be helpful.",
