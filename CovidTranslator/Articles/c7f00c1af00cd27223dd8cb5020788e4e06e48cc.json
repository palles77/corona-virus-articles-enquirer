Owing to the high electronegativity of fluorine, the carbonyl carbon of TFMK is a highly active electrophile. It is generally believed that hemiketal or hemithioketal is formed by the nucleophilic attack of the hydroxyl or thiol group at the active site when TFMKs are employed as the inhibitors against serine or cysteine proteases, respectively. Previous studies 19 indicated that TFMKs demonstrate a competitive slow, tight-binding inhibition against human leukocyte elastase. Recently, Zhang et al. 20a described N,N-dimethyl glutaminyl fluoromethyl ketones as 3CL protease inhibitors. One of these compounds was found to have low toxicity in mice, and another one was found to have an EC 50 value of 2.5 lM based on the cytopathic effect (CPE) inhibition assay. However, the in vitro inhibition has not been characterized in detail. Sydnes et al. 20b also reported the synthesis of glutamic acid and glutamine peptides with a CF 3 -ketone unit as 3CL protease inhibitors.",

Scheme 1 shows the four-step synthesis of various N-protected trifluoromethyl ketones. The preparation of nitro alcohols 3 was carried out by C-C bond formation between nitroalkanes 2 and trifluoroacetaldehyde ethyl hemiacetal under the basic condition of catalytic potassium carbonate. The choice of nitroalkanes defines the P 1 group of the final inhibitor. For instance, 1-nitro-2-phenylethane 2a introduces a benzyl group at the P1 site. Subsequent reduction to amine alcohols was performed either by PtO 2 -or Raney nickel-catalyzed hydrogenation. The use of PtO 2 was avoided in the reduction of 3a because undesired saturation of the phenyl ring was observed. At this stage, the trifluoroamine alcohols were coupled with N-protected amino acids or long-chain acids by using HBTU and DIEA (or Et 3 N) to afford 4a-g. Final oxidation using Dess-Martin reagent generated the desired trifluoromethyl ketones 5a-h.",

Moreover, in consistence with the previous reports of cathepsin B and human leukocyte elastase, 18b,19 prolonged incubation of 3CL protease with 5h exhibited a time-dependent decrease in enzyme activity as a function of the inhibitor concentration. The inhibitor was found to produce progressive tightening of inhibition, as shown by a 30-fold decrease in the K i value (from 8.8 to 0.3 lM) in 4 hr ( Table 2 and Fig. 2 ). As indicated by the NMR studies, the trifluoromethyl ketone moiety exists as an equilibrium mixture of ketone and hydrate forms. The timedependent tightening of inhibition is likely due to the slow formation of a covalent adduct through the nucleophilic attack of the thiol group on the carbonyl carbon.",

Alternatively, computational molecular modeling was used to construct a model for the acyl-enzyme complex. On the basis of the crystal structure of 3CL protease with a chloromethyl ketone (CMK) inhibitor, the analog of trifluoromethyl ketone, determined by Yang et al., 7 we first constructed the models for the four possible stereoisomers of the covalent adducts between the protein and compound 5h. All the models were constrained with a covalent link between the thiol group of Cys-145 and compound 5h, in consistent with the analog experimental complex structure by Yang et al. 7 In comparison with the analog experimental structure, only the (S,S,S,S) isomer of compound 5h with the R configuration of carbonyl carbon adjacent to CF 3 group agreed with the binding mode of the CMK inhibitor, in particular all four amino acid side chains of compound 5h fitted into the bind pockets of the 3CL protease active site. All the other three stereoisomers were ruled out because all these molecules were unable to bind to the active site under the covalent constraint. The computational model of the (S,S,S,S) isomer is different from the binding mode of the CMK-3CL protease complex structure in that the P1, P2, P4 side chains in compound 5h occupied S2, S1, and S4 sites, respectively, in 3CL protease (Fig. 3) . The binding mode discrepancies were expected consequences due to the difference between the amino acid side chains of the two inhibitor analogs. The proposed detailed covalent attacking mechanism was shown in Figure 4 . into a mixture of substrate (6 lM) and inhibitor 5h. Over the entire 120 min time window, the uninhibited enzyme displayed a linear progress curve, whereas the inhibited enzyme with a different concentration of inhibitor showed a time-dependent reduction of activity.",

Subsequent coupling was performed using decanoic acid (40.7 mg, 0.24 mmol), HBTU (98.7 mg, 0.26 mmol), and DIEA (117 lL, 0.71 mmol) by the routine procedure.
