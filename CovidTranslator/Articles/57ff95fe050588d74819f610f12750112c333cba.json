We identified a bi-planar dicarboxylic acid compound, called SCF-I2, as an inhibitor of substrate phosphodegron recognition by the yeast F-box protein Cdc4. SCF-I2 inhibits the binding and ubiquitination of full length phosphorylated substrates by SCF Cdc4 . A crystal costructure reveals that SCF-I2 inserts between the \u03b2-strands of blades 5 and 6 of the WD40 propeller domain of Cdc4 at a site that is 25 \u00c5 remote from the substrate binding site. Long-range transmission of SCF-I2 interactions distorts the substrate binding pocket and impedes recognition of key determinants in the Cdc4 phosphodegron. Mutation of the SCF-I2 binding site abrogates its inhibitory effect and explains specificity in the allosteric inhibition mechanism. Mammalian WD40 domain proteins may exhibit similar allosteric responsiveness and hence represent an extensive new class of druggable target.",

E3 enzymes, also referred to as ubiquitin ligases, specifically recognize discrete sequence motifs in substrates termed degrons. The human genome encodes at least 600 E3 enzymes, each of which has the potential to recognize multiple substrates 4 . The largest class of E3 enzymes, the cullin-RING ligases (CRLs), were discovered through identification of the multi-subunit Skp1-Cdc53/Cullin-F-box protein (SCF) complexes 1, 2 . A large family of F-box proteins recruit substrates to the core SCF complex via protein interaction domains, typically leucine rich repeats (LRRs) or WD40 repeats, often in a phosphorylation dependent manner 1, 2, 5-7 . The SCF enzymes likely target hundreds of different substrates 4, 8-10 and thus hold untapped potential for drug discovery 4 .",

The FP assay achieved a Z-factor of 0.8, based on negative (DMSO solvent only) and positive (unlabelled CPD peptide) controls. A screen against a 50,000 compound library enriched for drug-like molecules 17 yielded 44 hits that inhibited the CPD-Cdc4 interaction by at least 50% (Fig. 1a) . Two of these compounds, denoted SCF-I2 and SCF-I6, strongly inhibited the interaction of full length phospho-Sic1 with Cdc4 and prevented Sic1 ubiquitination by SCF Cdc4 (Fig. 1b) . We pursued only SCF-I2 because SCF-I6 appeared to cause non-specific loss of Skp1-Cdc4 complex from the capture resin ( Fig  1b) . SCF-I2 corresponds to 1-(2-carboxynaphth-1yl)-2-naphthoic acid, which is a derivative of 1,1\u2032-binapthyl-2,2\u2032diol, also known as BINOL, a bi-planar axially chiral atropisomer that is widely used as a scaffold in chiral synthesis 18 . The two hydroxyl groups of BINOL are substituted by carboxylic acid groups in SCF-I2 (Fig. 1c) . The form of 1-(2carboxynaphth-1-yl)-2-naphthoic acid) used in our all of our assays was an undefined racemic mixture of the R-and S-enantiomers, which are non-interconvertable at even high temperature 18 . SCF-I2 was 10-fold less potent than unlabeled CPD peptide in the FP assay, with an IC 50 = 6.2 \u03bcM versus 0.5 \u03bcM, respectively (Fig. 1c) . SCF-I2 inhibited binding and/or ubiquitination of both full length Sic1 and Far1 with an IC 50 of ~60 \u03bcM ( Supplementary Fig. 1b,c) ; the weaker apparent affinity of SCF-I2 in these assays may reflect differences in the interaction of peptides and full length substrates with Cdc4. SCF-I2 did not affect the activity of the closely related E3 enzyme SCF Met30 , which recruits its substrate Met4 via the WD40 domain of the F-box protein Met30 ( Supplementary Fig 1d) 19 .",

Unbiased difference electron density maps revealed that SCF-I2 binds to the WD40 repeat domain of Cdc4 at a site that is 25 \u00c5 distant from the CPD binding pocket (Fig. 2a) . The eight WD40 repeat motifs of Cdc4 form a canonical propeller structure in which each propeller blade consists of four anti-parallel \u03b2-strands and intervening loop regions ( Supplementary Fig. 2) 20 . SCF-I2 embeds in a deep pocket on the lateral surface of the \u03b2propeller between blades 5 and 6 ( Fig. 2a,b; Supplementary Fig. 2 ). Cdc4 engages only one of two enantiomers of SCF-I2, the (R)-(+) equivalent of BINOL. The top napthalene ring system of SCF-I2 inserts deeply between blades 5 and 6 forming extensive hydrophobic contacts with Leu628, Ile594, Leu634, Trp657, and Ala649 (Fig. 2b ). In addition, the carboxyl group of the top ring system hydrogen bonds to the NH group of the Trp657 side chain and forms a salt bridge with the side chain of Arg664. The bottom napthalene ring system is more solvent exposed and forms a stabilizing co-planar stacking interaction with the side chain of Arg664 and van der Waals interactions with the side chains of Ser667 and Arg655. The carboxyl group of the bottom ring system also forms ionic interactions with the side chains of Arg655 and His631.",

Rather, the SCF-I2 binding pocket is induced by separation of blades 5 and 6 and a drastic shift of the \u03b221-\u03b222 linker that connects the two blades (Fig. 2d) . The reorientation of the \u03b221-\u03b222 linker entails a 5 \u00c5 shift of the main chain and a massive 13 \u00c5 shift of the side chain of His631 from a buried to solvent-exposed position (Fig. 2d,e) . These large conformational alterations create an interblade void that is filled by the rearrangement of residues proximal to the CPD binding pocket (Fig. 2d,e) . The void is filled in part by a swap of side chain positions between Val635, which is normally buried and adjacent to His631, and the normally solvent-exposed Leu634 side chain; as a consequence of this rearrangement, the side chains of Val635 and Leu634 traverse 6 and 8 \u00c5, respectively. The position vacated by Leu634 in turn is filled by rotation of the side chain of Tyr574. Critically, both Tyr574 and Leu634 comprise part of the highly conserved CPD binding infrastructure. In the CPD peptide-Skp1-Cdc4 complex 20 , Tyr574 and Leu634 line the hydrophobic P-2 binding pocket within the central pore ( Fig. 2e ) and thereby dictate the preference for hydrophobic residues at the P-2 position of the CPD consensus motif 14, 20 . The P-2 pocket is thus severely distorted by the reoriented side chains of Tyr574 and Leu634 in the SCF-I2 bound structure. In addition, the hydroxyl group of Tyr574 participates in stabilizing H-bond interactions with the side chain of Arg572, one of the four invariant essential Arg residues found in all Cdc4 orthologs 20 . Arg572 stabilizes the orientation of Tyr548, which in turn directly hydrogen bonds to the CPD phosphate group in the P0 position. Thus, SCF-I2 critically compromises the main binding pockets for the P-2 and P0 positions of the CPD consensus sequence 14, 20 . As predicted by this structural model, the effects of SCF-I2 are mimicked by a Tyr574Ala mutation, which results in a 20-fold reduction in affinity of Cdc4 for the CPD peptide (Fig.  2f) .",

Mutation of each Arg residue individually to Ala attenuated the inhibition of Cdc4 by SCF-I2 by at least 50-fold (Fig. 2g) . Alleles bearing either mutation fully complemented Cdc4 function in vivo, indicating that this region of Cdc4 does not normally play a critical role in substrate recognition or SCF catalytic activity ( Supplementary Fig. 3a) . To investigate the structural features of SCF-I2 required for Cdc4 inhibition, we tested a panel of available BINOL analogs for activity in the FP assay ( Supplementary Fig. 3b,c) . This series demonstrated the importance of the napthalene ring systems that participate in numerous hydrophobic interactions and the carboxylate groups that form electrostatic interactions with the two Arg residues on Cdc4. These mutational and structure-activity results validate the binding mode for SCF-I2 observed in the crystal structure.",

This proved to be the case as SCF-I2 inhibited the CPD-Fbw7 interaction only at high concentrations (Fig. 3a) . The residual inhibitory activity of SCF-I2 towards Fbw7 might be due to the conservative Arg-to-Lys substitution and the conservation of most other residues that form the induced SCF-I2 binding pocket (Fig 3b;  Supplementary Fig. 2) . Alignment of all human WD40 domains revealed that, aside from the two surface Arg residues, the pattern of SCF-I2 contact residues is often conserved (Supplementary Fig. 4) .

These rearrangements induce a binding pocket for the C-terminal farnesyl moiety of the partner G T \u03b3 subunit, which may serve to regulate membrane association of the G T \u03b2\u03b3 complex 22 . Comparison of our SCF-I2-Cdc4 structure and the phosducin-G\u03b2\u03b3 structure reveals three highly similar features. First, the ligandbound forms of both structures exhibit an analogous buried-to-exposed transition of the conserved His residue at the apex of the connector between the affected blades (Fig. 3c) . Second, the Cdc4 and G\u03b2 structures show a remarkably close juxtaposition of induced binding pockets for the SCF-I2 and farnesyl ligands, respectively (Fig. 3c) . Third, these rearrangements occur between blades 5 and 6 for both WD40 structures.

Moreover, allosteric inhibitors may be combined with conventional binding pocket inhibitors to increase potency 27 . The yeast genome encodes at least 113 proteins with WD40 or WD40-like domains that function in signaling, transcription, chromatin remodeling, mRNA splicing, DNA replication and repair, protein synthesis, the ubiquitin system, autophagy, vesicle trafficking, the cytoskeleton and organelle biogenesis (Supplementary Table 2 ). In humans, WD40 domains occur in at least 256 different proteins and perform similarly diverse functions (Supplementary Table 3 ). Biomedically important WD40 domain proteins include the F-box proteins Fbw7 and \u03b2-TrCP 8 , target of rapamycin (TOR) kinase complex subunits 28 and G\u03b2-subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins 21, 27 . Our findings suggest that the WD40 domain may be generally accessible to allosteric modulation by small molecules.",

High controls contained 1.5 uL of DMSO only and low controls contained 1.5 \u03bcL of unlabelled cyclin E peptide in DMSO at a final concentration of 10 \u03bcM. Binding activity was calculated as the average sample value minus the mean of low controls divided by the mean of high controls minus the mean of low controls. Compounds were classified as initial hits if the binding value was below 50% of control. Dose response curves were carried out using the same conditions as above and EC 50 values calculated as previously described 17 . Determination of IC 50 was performed using a non-linear regression analysis using a sigmoidal dose response equation (variable slope) with no weighting or restraints (Graphpad Software, San Diego CA). mP units were normalized to no compound controls, i.e.,100% binding, for graphical representation.",

SCF-I2 is shown in yellow. Red dot indicates modeled position of the P0 phosphate position. PB indicates propeller blade. b, Stereo diagram of SCF-I2 bound between PB5 and PB6 of the WD40 domain of Cdc4. SCF-I2 is shown in yellow; critical contact residues in Cdc4 are shown in blue stick representations. c, Surface representation of SCF-I2 binding region on Cdc4 in the absence (top) and presence (bottom) of bound SCF-I2. d, Stereo diagram of main chain conformational shifts induced by SCF-I2. The structure of Cdc4 in the absence of SCF-I2 but in the presence of a CPD phosphopeptide substrate (yellow) is shown in purple; the structure of Cdc4 in the presence of SCF-I2 (yellow) is shown in blue. e, Schematic of allosteric alterations caused by binding of SCF-I2. Positions of SCF-I2 bound conformations are shown in red; X indicates abrogation of an H-bond caused by rotation of Tyr574. f, Binding curves for WT Skp1-Cdc4",
