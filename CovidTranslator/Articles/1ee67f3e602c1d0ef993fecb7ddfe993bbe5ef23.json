            "text": "Being inspired by the presence of a naturally-occurring 5,6dimethylbenzimidazole nucleotide in Vitamin B12, research on benzimidazole nucleosides was initiated by medicinal chemists in the 1950s and '60s. This led to the synthesis of a trichloro analog in Townsend's laboratory at the University of Utah and later the discovery of its activity against HCMV in John's laboratory. Much work, in both their laboratories at the University of Michigan, established that it and its 2-bromo analog (BDCRB) have excellent activity against HCMV with very low cytotoxicity. Surprisingly, it was found to be inactive against other herpes viruses and it did not need conversion to a triphosphate to be active against HCMV. Collaborative studies with Karen Biron at Burroughs Wellcome established that, unlike many other anti-virals that inhibit viral DNA synthesis such as ganciclovir (GCV), these compounds acted by a novel mechanism, inhibition of viral DNA processing. It was the viral resistance studies which revealed the viral targets, pUL89 and pUL56. These two proteins, with pUL104, form a complex known as the terminase which cuts newly synthesised HCMV DNA into unit lengths for packaging into virions. Although BDCRB had many desirable properties in vitro, it had poor pharmacokinetics in mice and monkeys due to hydrolysis of its glycosidic bond; therefore it was not developed for human use. Much additional work in Drach's and Townsend's laboratories at Michigan and by Biron's group at Burroughs Wellcome ultimately led to two potential drug candidates, BDCRB pyranoside and maribavir (Fig. 2) . Both compounds have excellent activity against HCMV, low toxicity, and excellent pharmacokinetics. Clearly, their modes of action differed markedly from that of GCV. Quite unexpectedly, they have different mechanisms of action.",

            "text": "BDCRB pyranoside has a mechanism of action very similar to its parent compound BDCRB, inhibition of DNA processing. In contrast, maribavir inhibits DNA synthesis, albeit indirectly. It is a 2isopropylamine derivative of BDCRB except that it has the unnatural L-sugar configuration. Its mechanism of action involves inhibition of the viral kinase (pUL97), which phosphorylates another viral protein, pUL44. Phosphorylated pUL44 is necessary for viral DNA synthesis. Thus inhibition of pUL97 by maribavir inhibits viral DNA synthesis. Interestingly, pUL97 is also the kinase that activates (phosphorylates) GCV. Resistance studies confirmed that a single mutation in UL97, resulting in a mutation in the kinase (Leu397Arg), was necessary and sufficient for resistance to maribavir. In a further study of resistance, virus already resistant to BDCRB was passaged in increasing concentrations of maribavir and resistant virus was isolated. This strain grew at the same rate as the wild-type virus and was resistant to both BDCRB and maribavir. As expected, resistance to BDCRB was due to known mutations in UL56 and UL89. However, no mutations were found in UL97. Further investigation showed that a single base change in UL27 (T1004C) was necessary and sufficient for resistance to maribavir. The role of the encoded protein was then unknown but the amino acid mutation (Leu335Pro) is in the middle of the protein.",

It is a guanosine nucleoside analog which is very active against HCMV. Unlike the benzimidazole nucleosides, it also inhibits Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8). Like GCV, it is phosphorylated by the kinase encoded by UL97. It is more potent in vitro and in vivo than ganciclovir but has a somewhat different pattern of resistance. In one resistant strain, the key mutation formed a stop codon resulting in a truncated pUL97 kinase protein. The phosphorylation of CPV by pUL97 is more efficient than that of GCV, with a considerably lower K m and higher V max . Interestingly, the phosphorylation of CPV to its monophosphate (CPV-MP) by pUL97 is stereoselective; only the (+) isomer of CPV-MP is formed. A single enzyme, GMP kinase, phosphorylates CPM-MP to both its di-and triphosphates. In contrast, acyclovir and GCV require additional cellular enzymes to convert their diphosphates to active triphosphates. Cyclopropavir is currently in Phase I clinical trials for the treatment of HCMV infections.",

Through to the early 1990s, he synthesized several other nucleoside analogs with bicyclic bases having good activity against HSV-1 and VZV. During the 1990s, emphasis switched to investigating the effect of modifying the sugar ring, in particular the synthesis of six-membered rings containing an oxygen or a double bond.

            "text": "Back in 1984, Erik De Clercq showed Piet a paper on AIDS, one of the authors being Phil Furman. This publication stimulated the search for anti-HIV compounds. Many compounds were discovered with potent activities (and good selectivity indices) against HIV. Piet worked out the first structure-activity relationships of anti-HIV dideoxy nucleosides. Starting in the late 1980s, Tony Hol\u00fd synthesised a series of phosphonates. At the 2013 ICAR, Erik De Clercq recalled how this work led, ultimately, to tenofovir, which was to become a major success for treating HIV-infected patients. From its first introduction in 2001, its market share has increased to well over 40%. In 2002, having a single-pill regimen was agreed as a way forward to simplify, and thereby enhance, HIV therapy. This led to Atripla being approved in 2006, Complera in 2011 and Stribild in 2012. Tenofovir, in its various prodrug forms, is now available in over 130 countries and is distributed widely to the known HIVinfected population. In line with this research, Piet synthesized phosphonate nucleosides, with a threose sugar moiety, which showed anti-HIV activity in the same range as 9-(2-phosphonylmethoxyethyl) adenine (PMEA). Piet's work had taken a different pathway. It is possible to link several nucleotides together to form aptamers. For example (Fig. 5) , the above antiviral nucleosides, which have a 6-membered ring in place of the natural furanose, could be incorporated into hexitol nucleic acid (HNA) aptamers. X-ray studies revealed the structures of HNA-RNA duplexes and HNA-HNA duplexes, the latter having a similar overall form to that of an RNA-RNA duplex with the same base sequence. HNA-containing aptamers were shown to be potent and specific inhibitors of trans-activating region (TAR)mediated transcription. Normally, an HIV encoded protein, transactivator of transcription (TAT), binds to cellular factors and to the viral TAR RNA regulatory element, resulting in a vastly increased rate of transcription of all HIV genes. HNA-containing aptamers prevents this interaction and so inhibit HIV replication. It took four years to engineer a polymerase that would utilise HNAs to assemble a strand complementary to a DNA template. In line with this research, hexitol-modified siRNA has shown good activity in an in vivo anti-HBV model. This success stimulated the concept that it may be possible to generate new forms of biologically active DNA.",

Alternative nutrient media could be fed into the chambers and the culture from one chamber could be used to seed the second chamber, the former culture being removed. In this example, the aim was to replace thymine with 5-chlorouracil ( Fig. 6) using Escherichia coli. Initially, the nutrient contained 10% 5-chlorouracil and 90% thymine. With each cycle, seeding one chamber from the previous one, the proportion of 5-chlorouracil was increased. After 180 days, in which there had been about 4000 generations of E. coli, thymine had been replaced totally by 5-chlorouracil. An interesting outcome was that the alternative base led to a change not only in the genotype but also in the phenotype; the ''new'' E. coli cells were much longer than the original. This is the first example of a DNA polymerase being adapted through evolutionary pressure to accept a nucleotide analog, resulting in the generation of a new living organism.",

However, from day 4 to 13, the polymerase inhibitor (RG-7128) had continued to reduce the viral load, reaching a reduction of log 10 2.7. On the other hand, the protease inhibitor (VX-950) did not give a sustained reduction, with the viral load starting to increase from day 6. At day 13, the viral load was only log 10 2.2 less than baseline. Nucleotide analogues have two advantages over other classes of inhibitors. There is a high genetic barrier to resistance selection, due to the HCV RNA polymerase being highly specific for its natural substrates and template. This specificity can be altered but only under extreme evolutionary pressure (see Section 3). Also, nucleotide analogs often have pan-genotype activity because the active site of the HCV NS5B polymerase is so highly conserved.",

In a collaboration between Gilead and Craig Cameron at Pennsylvania State University, the researchers sought to identify the toxicity target(s) for ribonucleotide analogues, including C-Nuc1 and others that had been stopped in Phase II trials. These studies showed a correlation between C-Nuc1 and the Phase II candidates, R1626, NM283 and BMS986094/IDX184. All the latter were efficiently incorporated into RNA by the mitochondrial RNA polymerase (>70% of the corresponding natural nucleotide). The triphosphate of C-Nuc1 was also an efficient substrate (22% the rate of ATP). In contrast, the active nucleotide analogs, formed by drugs approved for the treatment of HCV, were poor substrates. Ribavirin was poorly incorporated (about 5%) and sofosbuvir was below the limit of detection (= 0.02%). More extensive in vitro and cell culture evaluation of the compounds could have saved the expense of taking them into clinical trials.",

Adding a CN group to the 1 0 position of C-Nuc1 did not change its activity as an HCV NS5B polymerase inhibitor (IC 50 0.3 lM) but it did reduce incorporation in the mitochondrial RNA assay (<0.02%). However, in the absence of a nucleotide prodrug to bypass the first phosphorylation step, the resulting di-substituted nucleoside analog would not be a drug candidate because it was not efficiently activated in cells. Application of a nucleotide prodrug strategy allowed this nucleotide to be pursued further. Oral absorption, delivery of the monophosphate into hepatocytes and high hepatic extraction were criteria used as part of the prodrug optimization process. A nucleotide prodrug, GS-464335 (a mixture of diastereoisomers at phosphorous) was well absorbed in dogs (>80%). Comparing the pre-hepatic and post-hepatic plasma drug levels, about 80% of the absorbed drug was taken up by the liver. Inside cells, GS-464335 was converted to the corresponding monophosphate which was efficiently converted to the triphosphate. At 24 h, the triphosphate levels remained about 2-fold above the IC 90 value. A pure stereoisomer was selected and later named GS-6620. In a Phase II trial (900 mg, bid 5 days), the mean reduction in HCV load was about log 10 1.5. Two subjects achieved HCV RNA <25 IU/ ml. However, the pharmacokinetics and antiviral responses were highly variable. Whereas the activity results were disappointing, clinical proof of concept was observed in terms of safety. GS-6620 did have a markedly improved safety profile relative to C-Nuc1, progressing through chronic toxicology studies in rats and dogs at relatively high doses.",

The first approved prodrug of tenofovir (TFV) was TFV disoproxil fumarate (TDF). More recently, TFV alafenamide (TAF) has been progressed into clinical development. A key difference in the properties of the two prodrugs is their stability in plasma, with half-lives of 0.4 and 90 min, respectively. Even with a short halflife, TDF gave better delivery of TFV into cells, as indicated by the HIV EC 50 values in cell culture assays but there clearly was room for improvement; the EC 50 values for TFV, TDF and TAF are 1.2, 0.015 and 0.003 lM respectively. Whereas the gain in cell culture EC 50 value may be modest, this is not the only gain. The increased stability of TAF allows it to load on-target cells and tissues (e.g., lymph nodes) for a longer period of time resulting in increased lymphoid cell and tissue levels at greatly reduced circulating TFV levels, leading to less exposure to off-target tissues (e.g., kidney). In monotherapy studies after oral dosing with TDF (300 mg) and TAF (25 mg), the plasma TFV AUC is reduced from 1920 to 268 ng.h/ml respectively whereas the reduction in HIV load from baseline is improved, from log 10 0.97 to log 10 1.46 copies/ml, respectively, reflecting the more efficient delivery of TAF to target cells and tissues. Clearly the lower dose of TAF (25 mg) relative to TDF (300 mg) will give TAF a marked advantage when considering combination pill therapy.",

The assay read-out will need to be optimized for high-throughput screening (HTS) but, already, the assay has shown some ''hits''. A few compounds inhibited encapsidation of viral RNA. (The HBV virion contains partly double stranded (ds) DNA but the reverse-transcription from RNA to DNA occurs within the capsid.) Within the cell, HBV DNA is transported into the nucleus where the viral DNA forms covalently closed circles (cccDNA). Two specific inhibitors of cccDNA formation have been found. Current nucleotide anti-HBV compounds do give large reductions of HBV DNA in plasma but only a minimal reduction in levels of the HBs antigen (about log 10 0.1). In contrast, one ''hit'', HBF-0259 inhibited surface antigen production but not genomic replication. Structure-activity-relationship (SAR) studies have given the current lead compound, HBV-0215. In conclusion, the cell-based assay, with complete replication of HBV, has markedly improved the screening for anti-HBV compounds although further optimization is still needed to give HTS capability.",

Over the last few years, there has been much progress towards understanding the critical role of the HBV core protein -it is much more than just a protective coat for the genome because it plays a major role in the HBV life cycle. The core protein, being 183 amino acids long, is known as Cp 183 . The first 149 amino acids are involved in core assembly whereas the last 34 residues, rich in serines and arginines, bind to RNA. Phosphorylation of the serines, particularly S155, S162 and S172, is required for specific packaging of full length HBV RNA complexed to the polymerase (reverse transcriptase -pregenomic RNA; RT-pgRNA).",

Inside the core, the area of highest density (highlighted in red) represented the polymerase which was attached to the inner surface of the core. The ''other proteins'' in the core were shown in blue. The current thinking is that the polymerase, initially acting as a reverse transcriptase, is attached to, and guided by, an ''inside railway track''. This enables the polymerase to jump to the other end of the RNA to start the reverse transcription into DNA and then jump again to the other end to start, but never complete, the replication of the complementary DNA strand. The self-assembly of the core is an energetically ''downhill'' process. Somewhat surprisingly, it is possible to get mutations in which the core is even more stable but the RT activity is reduced.",

In a collaborative effort, mice from 8 ''founder'' strains, including 3 wild-derived strains, were selected. The 5 founder laboratory strains were all derived ultimately from a single female mouse ca 1900. The susceptibility of the 8 founder strains to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) differed widely (LD 50 P10 6 -10 2 ). The founder strains were cross-bred. Although ca 90% of the genes was equally distributed among the new mouse lines, there were gene combinations not seen previously. After infecting mice from the different founder strains with a constant SARS-CoV inoculum and measuring virus load at a set time after infection, there was a correlation between virus load and disease (as measured by vascular cuffing). It was possible to relate the effect to chromosomes 3 (27%) and 13 (20%). Hopefully, identification of the important genes may be achieved. By keeping the virus inoculum constant, this system better represents the clinical spectrum of disease. When using this system to evaluate a potential vaccine, it was found that mice, under the age of one year, could be protected. However, there was a range of effectiveness, from good protection to inactive. These variations may give a representation of human diversity.",

The adherence rates were unexpectedly poor in all four studies, particularly low in the study including at risk women. For example in one study, ''high adherence'' was defined as subjects taking at least 80% of drug doses and was achieved by only 54% of subjects. Possible reasons may have been the apparent risk of side-effects (the long consent form included 7 pages of side-effects) and the perception that the subjects, as individuals, were not particularly at risk of infection by HIV. Importantly, the trial did confirm the concept that PrEP could be effective. There was >90% protection in those subjects generally taking 7 doses/week and there was some protection, albeit much less, in subjects taking 2 doses/week. Adherence rates, reported by subjects, were appreciably higher than the rates evidenced by drug blood level measurements taken just before the next dose (i.e. 24 h after previous dose). In an attempt to better understand and model these data, the drug concentrations (TDF/TFV and FTC) in various tissues were measured. The ratio between drug concentrations in blood and tissue samples differed greatly for TDF/TFV, with less variations for FTC.

Although daily dosing with TDF/FTC has not proved sufficiently successful as PrEP in clinical use, it has proved that PrEP is an achievable aim and this has encouraged the progression of other options.",

            "text": "Courtney Fletcher, University of Nebraska, Omaha, NE, USA Atripla was the first triple combination pill taken once daily for HIV therapy. It contained TDF, FTC and efavirenz (EFV). The macaque model has been used to investigate the differing tissue distributions of these drugs and how viral replication may be continuing wherever the drug concentrations are lowest. There are two approaches: tissue homogenates and tissue cells. Tissue homogenates give both the intracellular and extracellular drug amounts. From tissues, mononuclear cells (MNCs) are collected and the intracellular drug concentration measured. This approach is preferred by Courtney but this option may be constrained by sample size and the drug concentration may be underestimated. For exam-ple, with raltegravir, after the MNCs have been washed 3 times, the drug concentration is very low. Much higher raltegravir concentrations are found when the MNCs are cleaned by a rapid spin through oil. Comparing an oil spin and repeated washes, the oil process gives higher drug levels, typically about 50% higher.",

            "text": "This year, the three major award lectures exemplified the strength of ICAR, covering very different areas of research. John Drach (Elion Award) described his journey through the early days of antiviral research, which led to the identification of novel modes of antiviral action that had not been envisaged previously. Piet Herdewijn (Hol\u00fd Award) used evolutionary pressure to select DNA polymerases that accept novel nucleoside analogs. The replacement of thymine by 5-chlorouracil led to the generation of a new form of E. coli. I suggest that this work has important implications in conventional antiviral research. With HIV and HCV protease inhibitors, the genetic barrier is limited by the ability of the viral protease and its substrate (the viral polyprotein cleavage sites) to co-mutate so that the virus can become resistant to the antiviral drug. So far, polymerase inhibitors have not suffered the same fate but this work shows that a poor choice of nucleotide analog could result in a resistant virus with a new type of RNA in which the drug replaces a natural nucleoside. Adrian Ray (Prusoff Award), describing work at Gilead, demonstrated how the prodrug concept can markedly improve both the efficacy and safety of potential drugs. Their progress with HIV and HCV therapies has been remarkable.",

David Margolis summarized work aiming to eradicate HIV from infected subjects and Myron Cohen described current progress with approaches to prevent HIV transmission. I found both these presentations to be informative and stimulating. HIV ''cure'' still seems to be a distant prospect. In contrast, prior to exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) has been shown to be an achievable aim although the need for daily dosing is a barrier to success. Gerardo Garcia-Lerma described recent progress which is likely to radically change the prospects for therapeutic convenience and success. TDF-containing vaginal rings, which need replacing only once a month, are being evaluated. Another exciting prospect is GSK-744 which has been formulated as a long-lasting injection. A Phase I trial confirmed that the drug may be administered at 3month intervals. In the absence of a proven HIV vaccine, PrEP with drugs has become the most promising strategy to reduce HIV infection rates among high-risk populations.",

In my report for the 2013 ICAR, I expressed a hope regarding HCV therapy: ''There is the prospect that the first nucleotide analogue will be licensed by the time of our next ICAR meeting. The combination of a nucleotide analogue and a NS5A inhibitor looks set to transform HCV therapy across all genotypes. As for HIV, single-pill, once-daily regimens are following on quickly''. On 6th December 2013, Sofosbuvir (Sovaldi \u00d2 ) was the first nucleotide analog to be approved in the USA by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treatment of patients with HCV. Approval by the European Union followed soon afterwards, in January 2014. A NS5A inhibitor, ledipasvir, formulated as a single fixed-dose combination pill with sofosbuvir, is progressing quickly through clinical trials. With such remarkable progress being achieved since the 2013 ICAR, I was disappointed to discover that there was no presentation on this topic at this year's ICAR.",

The combination of sofosbuvir/ledipasvir has shown remarkable results in clinical trials, with SVR12 in the range 95-100% across genotypes. This combination was well tolerated. A NDA for the sofosbuvir/ledipasvir combination pill was submitted recently. I do not recall any previous antiviral trials in which the ''intention-to-treat'' analyses showed 100% success rates.",
