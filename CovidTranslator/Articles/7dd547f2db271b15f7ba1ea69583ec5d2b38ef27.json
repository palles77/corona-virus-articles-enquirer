Therefore, demands in detecting the virus in suspected patients in hospitals and clinical laboratories are growing. The Japanese government announced the approval of real-time PCR analysis to detect SARS-CoV-2 for health insurance on March 6, 2020. Here, we compared the detection sensitivity among the primer/probe sets designed by the National Institute of Infectious Diseases (NIID) in Japan and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United States of America. These probes were designed as single-quencher probes. We originally designed the double-quencher probes consisting of the same nucleotide sequencing imposed by the NIID.

Second, the background signal is prone to be low if the probe forms three-dimensional structure owing to self-quenching.

To this end, we utilized a double-quencher system for detecting SARS-CoV-2 by a one-step real-time RT-PCR. As expected, a double-quencher probe decreased the background signal at the baseline which led to a higher dynamic range.

Human-tohuman transmission of the virus accounts for the spread of the virus around the world [2-7]. Human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the receptor for SARS-CoV-2 and one of the potential therapeutic targets [8, 9]. SARS-CoV-2 belongs to a group of SARS-like coronaviruses (genus Betacoronavirus, subgenus Sarbecovirus) which had previously been found in bats in China [10]. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that bats are possibly the original hosts of this virus [11]. SARS-CoV-2 has a single-strand, positive-sense RNA genome with 29,903 base pairs in length (NCBI Reference Sequence: NC_045512.2) [12].

Experiment was independently conducted three times. Blue line shows FAM signal and red shows ROX signal. ZEN/IBFQ double-quencher reduced the background fluorescent signal compared to the TAMRA single-quencher in both N1 and N2 sites.",
