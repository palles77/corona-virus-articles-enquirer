            "text": "Single nucleotide variations (SNVs) at 5 loci (17564, 21721, 22222, 23823, and 27827) were used to define the molecular epidemiologic characteristics of severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) from Beijing patients. Five fragments targeted at the SNV loci were amplified directly from clinical samples by using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), before sequencing the amplified products. Analyses of 45 sequences obtained from 29 patients showed that the GGCTC motif dominated among samples collected from March to early April 2003; the TGTTT motif predominanted afterwards. The switch from GGCTC to TGTTT was observed among patients belonging to the same cluster, which ruled out the possibility of the coincidental superposition of 2 epidemics running in parallel in Beijing. The Beijing isolates underwent the same change pattern reported from Guangdong Province. The same series of mutations occurring in separate geographic locations and at different times suggests a dominant process of viral adaptation to the host. S evere acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a new infectious disease that spread worldwide in early 2003, affecting >30 countries, with >8,098 cases and 774 deaths reported (1) . Beijing, People's Republic of China, experienced the largest SARS outbreak in the world, with 2,523 cases and 181 deaths by June 12, 2003 (2,3) . The epidemic occurred in 2 phases. The first phase began on March 5, 2003 , and was caused by a patient who had been infected in Guangzhou and was involved in a superspreader event (SSE) in Beijing hospitals. Most patients in this period proved to be directly or indirectly linked with the index patient by traditional epidemiologic investigations. Molecular epidemiology, based on genome sequencing of the early isolates, also provided evidence that Beijing infections were closely related to those from the Guangdong epidemic (4). The second phase was marked by widespread transmission in healthcare facilities and communities, with incidence peaking in late April, followed by a dramatic decline in occurrence during the first week of May. The last probable case was noted on May 29, 2003 (5) . During this phase, many case-patients had no apparent contact with SARS patients.",

All or some of the 5 loci were included in previous molecular epidemiologic studies (4, (11) (12) (13) , making them important genetic signatures to differentiate lineage-specific and temporal-specific patterns. In this study, we investigated the genetic variations of SARS-CoV in Beijing based on the 5-locus signature.

Findings of these studies are summarized in the Figure, Beijing had experienced the SARS epidemic from March to June; however, only a few Beijing strains from the early epidemic have been analyzed in previous studies. Our study is the first to provide phylogenetic information on Beijing strains from the early and middle epidemic, as well as the late epidemic, by using the 5-locus motif of previous studies. The series of mutations in the 5-locus motif observed in Beijing followed the same path as isolates in Guangdong Province and the worldwide epidemic, i.e., the early introduction of GACTC motif was followed by transition to a GGCTC motif, before switching to a stable TGTTT motif. The observation of the same series of mutations occurring in 2 separate locations at different times suggests a dominant process of viral adaptation to the host.",
