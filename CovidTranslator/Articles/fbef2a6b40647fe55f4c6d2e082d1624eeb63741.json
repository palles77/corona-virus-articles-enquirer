Non-immune antibody phage display libraries are an efficient in vitro method for selecting monoclonal antibodies and hence ideal in these circumstances. Such libraries can be constructed from a variety of sources e.g. B cell cDNA or synthetically generated, and use a variety of antibody formats, typically scFv or Fab. However, antibody source and format can impact on the quality of antibodies generated and hence the effectiveness of this methodology for the timely production of antibodies. We have carried out a comparative screening of two antibody libraries, a semi-synthetic scFv library and a human-derived Fab library against the protective antigen toxin component of Bacillus anthracis and the epsilon toxin of Clostridium botulinum. We have shown that while the synthetic library produced a diverse collection of specific scFv-phage, these contained a high frequency of unnatural amber stops and glycosylation sites which limited their conversion to IgG, and also a high number which lost specificity when expressed as IgG. In contrast, these limitations were overcome by the use of a natural human library. Antibodies from both libraries could be used to develop sandwich ELISA assays with similar sensitivity. However, the ease and speed with which full-length IgG could be generated from the human-derived Fab library makes screening this type of library the preferable method for rapid antibody generation for diagnostic assay development.",

It involves the display of a polyclonal collection of antibody fragments containing the variable regions, numbering up to 10 11 different clones, on the surface of filamentous phage carrying the genetic sequence of the displayed fragment. Antibody library repertoires can be obtained primarily by two methods, either from cDNA antibody sequences derived from the B cells of immunized or non-immune animal or human donors, or synthetically generated using random nucleotide sequences within selected CDRs (complementarity-determining regions) in combination with one or multiple framework regions to replicate the diversity of a natural antibody repertoire (Conrad and Scheller, 2005) . These sequences are then fused to the sequence encoding the gene III (gIII) coat protein of the phage, enabling expression and incorporation of the antibody fragment on its surface. This collection of phage-displayed antibodies is then panned repeatedly against the antigen of interest, producing a polyclonal phage collection enriched for antigen-specific antibodies, from which individual monoclonal clones can then be identified and characterized.",

Therefore for functional use as an antibody, the clone must be transferred to an appropriate vector for expression of recombinant fulllength immunoglobulin in eukaryotic cell culture (Kohler and Milstein, 1975; Jostock et al., 2004) . However, some antibody clones may fail to express properly or lose affinity during this conversion from a bacterial to a eukaryotic expression system, as well as a change of antibody structural format. This may be caused by the presence of amber stops within coding sequences generated from random synthetic nucleotide sequences (Marcus et al., 2006) , or improper folding. This is a particular problem for synthetic libraries as they have not undergone positive selection within the immune system to remove antibodies that are unable to express or fold properly, unlike libraries generated from natural repertoires. On the other hand, synthetic libraries may have advantages over natural ones in that they possess non-natural sequences that may code for antibodies with unusual specificities that are not present in natural repertoires (Griffiths et al., 1994) .",

Therefore, in this study, we compared the relative ability of a semi-synthetic scFv library and a natural nonimmune Fab library to generate useful diagnostic antibodies that can be converted and expressed as soluble recombinant antibodies to be used as a detection reagent. Our choice of antigens was two commonly cited bioterrorism threats, epsilon toxin (Etox) and protective antigen (PA). While screening of the scFv library produced multiple clones that bound as phage, only a small percentage of clones were successfully expressed as either soluble scFv or full-length IgG and retained specificity and functionality. On the other hand, screening of the Fab library produced multiple high affinity clones against Etox and PA, all of which functioned as soluble Fab. Upon conversion to full-length IgG, they were capable of sub-microgram levels of detection in a sandwich ELISA. Many of the synthetic scFv clones were found to contain amber stops in their CDRs or N-linked glycosylation sites. However, removal of these sequences did not render the majority of these clones amenable to expression as soluble recombinant antibody, suggesting that improper folding may also be a factor. The results of the study suggest that non-immune naturally derived antibody libraries may be preferable to synthetic scFv libraries for rapid isolation of antibodies against typical foreign or pathogenic protein antigens.",

Each scFv monomer is connected to the dimerization motif via the flexible hinge of murine IgG3. Due to the presence of amber stop codons within the antibody CDRs which would prevent expression of the scFv in non-suppressor E. coli strains, overlapping PCR was carried out to introduce a single point mutation to convert the TAG stop codon to GAG, hence retaining the correct amino acid sequence. The sequence was then cloned into the expression vector via NcoI and NotI. Expression of scFv dimers was performed in the non-suppressor E. coli strain HB2151. Inoculated cultures were induced with 0.2 mM IPTG at late log growth phase (OD 600 0.8) and then grown overnight at room temperature.

While other stop codons would result in the non-expression of the antibody-gIII fusion protein, in the TG1 E. coli strain the amber stop codon TAG is translated as glutamic acid due to the presence of an amber suppressor tRNA gene (SupE) (Weigert et al., 1965) .

Three antibodies were found to express poorly with undetectable yield on purification of culture media (I41, I74 and J50). Of the antibodies that were successfully expressed, three (I70, J89 and J96) had no binding ability, while the remaining four (I20, I64, J3, and J49) retained affinity and specificity, in correlation to the results of the scFv ELISA (Fig. 1F) . I64, although initially considered cross-reactive as scFv also had a slight PA-specific signal above background and could be considered a weak binder. On the other hand, the loss of binding of I70 could be attributed to an N-linked glycosylation site on the light chain CDR3, which produced a noticeable shift in mass as observed on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1G) . Glycosylation on the CDR region, which contacts the antigen, is highly likely to interfere with antigen binding. However, glycosylation was also observed in clones that retained binding activity, such as in the light chains of J3 and the light and heavy chains of J49. As these particular chains were observed to have doublet bands on SDS-PAGE, it could be that these two clones undergo incomplete glycosylation, resulting in a portion of expressed antibody retaining binding activity. It is unclear why some clones were unable to express as IgG, but glycosylation was probably not the only determining factor, as only one (I74) out of the three poorly expressing antibodies (I41, I74 and J50) contained a predicted glycosylation site.",

Due to the low number of positive Etox clones (OD N 0.5), additional weaker binders were also selected for further analysis and a total of nine unique clones isolated and sequenced (Fig. 2B) .

To determine whether the antibodies isolated from the scFv and Fab libraries can be used as detection reagents, we evaluated the performance of a panel of library-derived antibodies as capture-detector pairs in a sandwich ELISA. Each antibody was used both as capture and detector for all possible pairings. The choice of capture and detector antibodies is key to achieving high sensitivity in sandwich ELISAs, as pairs that have overlapping binding sites will compete with one another for antigen binding and hence perform poorly in the assay. Therefore, antibody libraries which can produce a large number of unique high affinity clones are advantageous, for they are more likely to generate antibody pairs that target different antigenic sites on the target molecule. As an additional comparison, I20, the best performing PA antibody that remained functional as a soluble scFv and IgG was also included. For the study with antibodies derived from the Fab library screening, purified IgG was used as capture and the biotinylated version was used as detector. In the PA IgG vs IgG-bio sandwich ELISA, clones PA21 and PA29 performed the best as detectors, while clones PA53 and PA64 were identified as the best capture antibodies (Fig. 4A) . In contrast, I20, while specific gave very low signals when used as capture antibody, and did not bind antigen when biotinylated as a detector antibody. As biotinylation seemed to diminish the binding of the scFv library-derived I20 antibody, for all anti-PA IgGs derived from the scFv library that retained functionality (I20, mI64, mJ3 and mJ49), directly HRP conjugated antibodies were used for detection. Both I20 and mI64 were found to work well as either capture or detector while mJ3 was found to be a suitable detector antibody (Fig. 4B) .",

The non-natural structure of scFv may have allowed for some synthetic scFv sequences to fold in a way that allowed specific binding when expressed on phage but not when expressed as soluble antibody.

More importantly, these functional pairs required IgGs that had to be modified to remove their amber stop codons, thus reducing their suitability for rapid development into diagnostic reagents. These pairs also used an IgG that have a significant percentage of polypeptide chains bearing unnatural glycosylations within the CDRs (mJ3), which may render a portion of antibody molecules defective and reduce the functionality of the antibody.",

The main advantage of synthetic libraries is the possibility of isolating 'self' antibodies which would normally be eliminated from natural libraries during negative selection to maintain tolerance. However, this would not be a consideration when screening for antibodies against foreign antigens. In conclusion, our study suggests that natural antibody libraries are preferable to synthetic repertoires for the rapid development of potential diagnostic antibodies to novel pathogens due to the ease and speed at which useful antibodies can be isolated.",
