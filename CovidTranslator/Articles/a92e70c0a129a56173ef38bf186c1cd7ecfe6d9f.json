FCoV and CCoV are each subdivided into two serotypes, FCoV-I/II and CCoV-I/II. A phylogenetic relationship is evident between, on one hand, CCoV-I/FCoV-I, and on the other hand, CCoV-II/FCoV-II, suggesting that interspecies transmission can occur. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the prevalence of coronavirus (CoV)-infected cats according to their contact with dogs and to genetically analyse the CoV strains infecting cats. From 2003 to 2009, we collected 88 faecal samples from healthy cats and 11 ascitic fluids from FIP cats. We investigated the possible contact with dog in the household and collected dogs samples if appropriate. Out of 99 cat samples, 26 were coronavirus positive, with six cats living with at least one dog, thus showing that contact with dogs does not appear as a predisposing factor for cats CoV infections.",

Six divergent strains were identified with the N gene clustering with CCoV-I whereas the 3 0 end of S was related to FCoV-I. Further analysis on those six samples was attempted by researching the presence of the ORF3 gene, the latter being peculiar to CCoV-I to date. We succeeded to amplify the ORF3 gene in five samples out of six. Thus, our data strongly suggest the circulation of atypical FCoV strains harbouring the CCoV-I ORF3 gene among cats. Moreover, the ORF3 genes recovered from the feline strains exhibited shared deletions, never described before, suggesting that these deletions could be critical in the adaptation of these strains to the feline host.",

The rest of the ORFs encode unknown or less-characterised nonstructural proteins.

            "text": "The data of molecular biology of FCoV and CCoV have rapidly accumulated since the early 2000s. FCoV and CCoV strains are classified into 2 main genotypes sharing close relationships. In particular, the S protein from FCoV-II originates from CCoV-II and the S protein of FCoV-I and CCoV-I share 81% identity, which could potentially lead to interspecific transmission of coronaviruses because S mediates cell entry. By sequence analysis of fragments from the M and S genes, Benetka et al. suggested that interspecies transmission of CoVs occurred in a shelter where cats and dogs were in contact. They indeed detected atypical FCoV strains related to CCoV-I (Benetka et al., 2006) . However, since the ORF3 gene had not been described at this time, it was impossible to confirm that these atypical strains belonged to the CCoV-I genotype. The present study was conducted on cats from private owners with the aim to investigate (i) the possible influence of the presence of dogs to the prevalence of cats coronavirus infection and (ii) the genetic characterisation of FCoV strains and CCoV strains from dogs living with CoV infected cats. We collected 88 faecal samples from healthy cats and 11 ascitic fluid from cats with clinical symptom of FIP. Among them, 19 were living with at least one dog in the same household but the percentages of infected cats and non-infected cats in close contact with a dog were not statistically different (Table 1) .",

            "text": "Phylogenetic analysis was performed on 15 coronavirus strains collected from healthy cats, 11 FIP cats and one dog by first sequencing fragments from N and S genes (Figs. 1,2) . Most of the FCoV strains were identified as FCoV-I with the N and S genes clustering with reference FCoV-I strains. Surprisingly, the N sequences from six strains recovered from clustered within the CCoV-I genotype whereas the spike gene of 4 of them ) segregated within the FCoV-I genotype. One significant element is the presence of the accessory ORF3 gene in these atypical FCoV strains, as this gene was described to be peculiar to CCoV-I strains (Lorusso et al., 2008) . Lorusso et al. hypothesised that, CCoV-I may have acquired the ORF3 gene after the divergence of FCoV-I and CCoV-I from their common ancestor, or, alternatively that FCoV-I may have lost the ORF3 gene present in the common parental virus. However, the description of atypical FCoV-I strains harbouring ORF3 gene led to the hypothesis that the ORF3 gene also persisted in some FCoV-I or that these strains may originate from a recombination between FCoV-I and CCoV-I strains. In the present study, we identified one couple of cat and dog (Cat-22 and Dog-1) harbouring coronavirus and living together. Notably, Dog-1 was infected by a CCoV-I strain and Cat-22 by an atypical FCoV-I strain comprising an ORF3 gene. Moreover, strains infecting these animals shared 99% of nucleotide identity within the N gene, the ORF3 genes exhibited the same 29-nt deletion which yielded a stop codon but the S genes significatively differed. It is therefore tempting to speculate that the strain detected in Cat-22 originated from recombination with the CCoV-I strain from the Dog-1. However, without extensive sequence analysis of the full-length genome from some atypical FCoV-I harbouring an ORF3 gene, it would be impossible to clarify whether they originate or not from recombination with CCoV-I and to identify the putative recombination sites.",

The functions of accessory proteins are often unknown but they are regularly implied in tropism switch or in adaptation of a viral strain to a new host species. Thus, adaptation of SARS-CoV from the bat to human was accompanied by several mutations in different parts of the genome including a characteristic 29-nt deletion within the accessory ORF8 gene (Chinese SMEC, 2004; Oostra et al., 2007) . The function of the gp3 protein encoded by the intact ORF3 gene is still unknown. Its biochemical properties, glycosylation and molecular weight have been studied by in vitro translation assays (Lorusso et al., 2008) . Gp3 is a 28 kDa N-glycosylated protein with a cleavable N-terminal signal, indicating that it may be a secretory protein. According to the predictive computer analysis, the truncated gp3 derived from the deleted ORF3 genes retain the same glycosylation site and the signal peptide. More studies on the biological properties of gp3 and its putative truncated counterparts described herein will be necessary to understand their role.",

A bootstrap analysis of 1000 replicates was performed and values above 90% are indicated on the branches. Horizontal branches are drawn to scale; the scale bar represents 0.1 nucleotide substitutions per site. The following reference strains were used for phylogenetic tree construction (GenBank accession numbers are reported in parentheses): FCoVII-79-1683 (AB086904), FCoVII-79-1146 (DQ010921), FCoVI-UCD1 (AB086902), FCoVI-Black (EU186072), FCoVI-KU-2 (AB086881), CCoVII-1-71 (JQ404409), CCoVII-BGF10 (AY342160), CCoVII-INSAVC (D13096), CCoVI-23/03 (AY548235), TGEV (AJ271965), HCoV-229E (DQ2439391). Sequences marked with j were amplified from FIP animals.",
