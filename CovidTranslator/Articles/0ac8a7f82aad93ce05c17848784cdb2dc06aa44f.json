Many viruses utilize RNA helicases in their life cycle, while human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) does not encode an RNA helicase. Thus, host RNA helicase has been involved in HIV-1 replication. Indeed, DDX1 and DDX3 DEAD-box RNA helicases are known to be required for efficient HIV-1 Revdependent RNA export. However, it remains unclear whether distinct DDX RNA helicases cross-talk and cooperate to modulate the HIV-1 Rev function. In this study, we noticed that distinct DDX RNA helicases, including DDX1, DDX3, DDX5, DDX17, DDX21, DDX56, except DDX6, bound to the Rev protein and they colocalized with Rev in nucleolus or nucleus. In this context, these DEAD-box RNA helicases except DDX6 markedly enhanced the HIV-1 Rev-dependent RNA export. Furthermore, DDX3 interacted with DDX5 and synergistically enhanced the Rev function. As well, combination of other distinct DDX RNA helicases cooperated to stimulate the Rev function. Altogether, these results suggest that distinct DDX DEAD-box RNA helicases cooperate to modulate the HIV-1 Rev function.",

For this, Rev contains a classical leucine-rich nuclear export signal (NES) that recruits nuclear export receptor CRM1 [3] [4] [5] . Upon binding to the RRE together with the GTP-bound form of Ran, CRM1 forms the export complex and Rev/CRM1/Ran-GTP complex exports unspliced or partially spliced viral RNA from the nucleus to the cytoplasm [3] [4] [5] .",

            "text": "Helicases are enzymes that hydrolyze nucleotide triphosphates (NTPs) and use the energy to unwind nucleic acid duplexes or to translocate along the nucleic acid strand. Depending on whether helicases unwind RNA or DNA duplexes, helicases are classified into RNA helicases and DNA helicases. Exceptionally, RNA helicase A (RHA) can unwind both RNA and DNA. DEAD (D-E-A-D: Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp)-box RNA helicases, which are ATPase-dependent RNA helicases and are found in all organisms from bacteria to humans, are involved in various RNA metabolic processes, including transcription, translation, RNA splicing, RNA transport, and RNA degradation [7, 8] . Many viruses utilize RNA helicases in their life cycle. Indeed, we recently found that DDX3 and DDX6, DEAD-box RNA helicases, are required for hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA replication [9, 10] . In addition to DDX3 and DDX6, DDX5 binds to HCV NS5B RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and it is involved in the HCV replication [11, 12] . Furthermore, DDX21 plays an important role in the translational control of a Borna disease virus (BDV) polycistronic mRNA [13] . Moreover, the capsid-binding nucleolar helicase DDX56 is important for infectivity of West Nile virus [14] . On the other hand, several viruses carry their own RNA helicases to assist the synthesis of their genome, such as HCV, flavivirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus, rubella virus, and alphavirus, however, HIV-1 does not encode an RNA helicase [15, 16] . Thus, host RNA helicases may be involved in HIV-1 replication [15, 17] . In fact, DDX1 and DDX3 have been implicated in the rep- lication of HIV-1 replication [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] . Both DDX1 and DDX3 interact with HIV-1 Rev and enhance Rev-dependent HIV-1 nuclear export [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] . However, the role of cross talk of these DDX or other DDX DEAD-box RNA helicases is still unknown. To address this issue, we first examined whether distinct DDX RNA helicases cooperate to modulate the HIV-1 Rev function and these DDX interact with Rev.",

            "text": "To investigate the potential role of distinct DDX DEAD-box RNA helicases in HIV-1 Rev function, we first used the Rev-dependent luciferase-based reporter plasmid pDM628 [19, 20, 24] (Fig. 1A) . As previously described, luciferase production was markedly stimulated by Rev, which induced a 15-fold increase in reporter signal (Fig. 1A) . Then, 293FT cells were cotransfected with several HAtagged DDX, including DDX1, DDX3, DDX5, DDX6, DDX17, DDX21, DDX56, pDM628, and/or Rev expression plasmid. While each DDX alone had no effect or marginal effect on the Rev-dependent luciferase-based reporter pDM628 in the absence of Rev (data not shown), all DDX synergized to stimulate the luciferase levels with Rev, respectively (Fig. 1B) . Indeed, DDX1, DDX3, or DDX5 markedly enhanced the Rev function, while DDX6 had a marginal effect. Thus, distinct DDX RNA helicases seemed to regulate HIV-1 Rev function. Since both DDX1 and DDX3 interact with HIV-1 Rev and enhance Rev-dependent HIV-1 nuclear export [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] , other DDX RNA helicases also might bind to Rev. To probe this possibility, we performed co-immunoprecipitation analyses on extracts of 293FT cells expressing Rev and HA-tagged DDX3, DDX5, DDX6, DDX17, DDX21, or DDX56 (Fig. 1C) . Consequently, Rev and HA-DDX3, HA-DDX5, HA-DDX21, or HA-DDX56 could be immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibody, indicating that Rev formed a complex with DDX3, DDX5, DDX17, DDX21, or DDX56, whether directly or indirectly. Importantly, Rev and DDX6 could not be immunoprecipitated, suggesting that Rev does not bind to DDX6 (Fig. 1C) . Thus, we confirmed that several DDX DEAD-box RNA helicases except DDX6 could bind to Rev.",

DDX5 mostly localized in nucleus and seemed to be partially colocalized with Rev in nucleus and nucleolus, while DDX6 predominantly localized in cytoplasmic speckles termed processing (P)-bodies.

            "text": "So far, it has been indicated that host RNA helicases may be involved in HIV-1 replication at multiple stages, such as the reverse transcription of HIV-1 RNA, HIV-1 mRNA transcription, the nu- cleus-to-cytoplasm transport of HIV-1 mRNA, and HIV-1 particle assembly, since HIV-1 does not encode own RNA helicase [15, 17] . Indeed, DDX1 and DDX3 have been implicated in post-transcriptional regulation of HIV-1 [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] . Both DDX1 and DDX3 interact with HIV-1 Rev and enhance the Rev-dependent HIV-1 nuclear export [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] . In addition to DDX1 and DDX3, we have demonstrated that DDX5, DDX17, DDX21, and DDX56, interacted with Rev and stimulated the Rev function ( Figs. 1 and 2) . Quite recently, Naji et al. employed the proteomics and statistical analysis to identify candidate host cell factors that interact with Rev/RRE [25] . In addition to above DDX RNA helicases, they also identified DHX36, DDX24, DHX9, and DDX47 as the Rev-binding DEAD/Hbox proteins [25] . Their interactome analysis of HIV-1 Rev supports and compensates our and their primary findings each other, since they did not demonstrate the direct evidence of these DDX RNA helicases modulate on the Rev function as well as their subcellular localization.",

Then, the oligomerized Rev recruits the CRM1/DDX3 complex that subsequently exports the RRE-containing HIV-1 RNA into the cytoplasm. Accordingly, we have found that combination of DDX1 and DDX3 cooperated to synergistically enhance the Rev-dependent nuclear export function (Fig. 4) . We have demonstrated an interaction of DDX3 with DDX5 (Fig. 3 ), indicating the cross-talk among distinct DDX RNA helicases. In this context, other combinations of distinct DDX RNA helicases, such as DDX3 and DDX5 or DDX1 and DDX21, synergistically cooperated to stimulate the HIV-1 Rev function (Fig. 4) . In addition to DDX, RHA also plays a role in Rev/RREdependent post-transcriptional regulation of HIV-1 [26] . RHA binds weakly to HIV-1 RRE independently of Rev. Thus, various RNA helicases seemed to be involved in the post-transcriptional regulation of HIV-1, however, it remains to be clarified when and where these distinct RNA helicases sequentially or hierarchically orchestrate the Rev-dependent RNA export.",

Relocation of DDX6 from P-bodies and stress granules to virus assembly sites at the perinuclear region was seen in foamy virus infected cells. However, DDX6 did not interact with Gag proteins and was not incorporated into the virion. In contrast, Reed et al. recently reported that DDX6 and Ago2 bind to HIV-1 Gag and DDX6 facilitates Gag assembly independent of HIV-1 RNA packaging [28] . Notably, DDX6 and Ago2, that are major components of P-body and act as microRNA effectors, suppress the HIV-1 replication [29, 30] .",
