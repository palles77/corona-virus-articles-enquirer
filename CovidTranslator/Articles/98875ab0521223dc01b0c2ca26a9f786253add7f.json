We previously reported the isolation of B2.1, a dimeric peptide that binds with high specificity to b12 and competes with gp120 for b12 antibody binding. Here, we show that the affinity of B2.1 was improved 60-fold over its synthetic-peptide counterpart by fusing it to the N-terminus of a soluble protein. This affinity, which is within an order of magnitude of that of gp120, probably more closely reflects the affinity of the phage-borne peptide. The crystal structure of a complex between Fab of b12 and B2.1 was determined at 1.8 \u212b resolution. The structural data allowed the differentiation of residues that form critical contacts with b12 from those required for maintenance of the antigenic structure of the peptide, and revealed that three contiguous residues mediate B2.1's critical contacts with b12. This single region of critical contact between the B2.1 peptide and the b12 paratope is unlikely to mimic the discontinuous key binding residues involved in the full b12 epitope for gp120, as previously identified by alanine scanning substitutions on the gp120 surface. These structural observations are supported by experiments that demonstrate that B2.1 is an ineffective immunogenic mimic of the b12 epitope on gp120. Indeed, an extensive series of immunizations with B2.1 in various forms failed to produce gp120 cross-reactive sera. The functional and structural data presented here, however, suggest that the mechanism by which b12 recognizes the two antigens is very different. Here, we present the first crystal structure of peptide bound to an antibody that was originally raised against \u00a7 These authors contributed equally to this work.",

One strategy to develop such a vaccine is to design immunogens that elicit antibodies similar to the rare human monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) that are effective at neutralizing a broad range of primary HIV-1 isolates (e.g., b12, 447-52D, 2G12, 2F5 and 4E10). However, the design of such immunogens is proving a significant challenge. The main barrier is the limitation in designing immunogens that faithfully reproduce the complex structural features of the viral epitopes that originally induced such neutralizing antibodies.",

Ala substitution of surface-exposed residues on gp120 has demonstrated that b12 binds to a discontinuous epitope, 8 which indicates that residues widely-separated in sequence, but not in space on the protein surface, are required for b12 binding. The crystal structure of intact IgG1 b12 was previously determined at 2.7 \u212b resolution, 9 revealing a 15 \u212b vertical projection of the 18-residue complementarity determining region (CDR)-H3 ringed by two canyons, one of which is formed between CDRs L1, L3 and H3 and the other between CDRs H1, H2 and H3. 10 Ala substitution studies on b12 have implicated CDRs H3 and L1 as regions for its interaction with gp120. 11",

By screening a panel of phage-displayed peptide libraries, we previously isolated and characterized a putative \"peptide mimic\", termed B2.1, that is specific for b12 21 and which effectively blocks the interaction of b12 and gp120. B2.1 is a homodimeric peptide, comprising two identical 18-residue peptide chains joined by a disulfide bridge. It does not react with non-neutralizing antibodies from sera derived from HIV-positive patients (unpublished data, X. Wang, C. Wang, and J.K.S.), suggesting that this peptide recognizes unique features of the neutralizing b12 paratope. In addition, Ala substitution studies on b12 revealed that a number of the mutations that affect binding to gp120 also influence binding to B2.1. 11 Considering these findings, we explored the possibility that B2.1 mimics the b12 epitope on gp120 and might serve as an immunogenic mimic of the gp120 epitope.",

Our previous study showed that the affinity of b12 for phage-borne B2.1 is probably much greater than its affinity for synthetic B2.1 peptide. 21 In this study, we show that the dissociation constant at equilibrium (Kd) of b12 for B2.1 fused to the E. coli maltose binding protein (MBP) is between 20 and 60 nM, which is significantly lower than that of b12 for the synthetic peptide, with Kds between 2.5 and 6.9 \u03bcM. Thus, the affinity of B2.1-MBP fusion most likely reflects that observed for the phage-displayed B2.1 peptide. Alanine substitution studies revealed that 12 out of the 15 residues in the B2.1 sequence contribute to binding to b12, but only six of them are critical. The crystal structure of B2.1 in complex with the b12 Fab revealed that three of these critical binding residues (CBRs) form side-chain contacts with the b12 paratope, whereas the remaining three CBRs are required for the structural integrity of the peptide. Immunization studies with B2.1 in various forms failed to produce cross-reactive antibodies with gp120. Moreover, the fine specificity of the immune sera differed significantly from that of b12, since the sera produced different patterns of reactivity with Ala-substituted B2.1 peptides. Taken together, these results indicate that while B2.1 is bound by b12 with high affinity, it is a poor immunogenic mimic of the b12 epitope, most likely because it does not structurally mimic the full discontinuous epitope on gp120. Our results reveal caveats encountered in defining mechanisms of peptide mimicry of discontinuous protein epitopes, and their relevance to epitope and antibody-targeted vaccines.",

As B2.1 is displayed on phage as a disulfide-bridged fusion to the N-terminus of two pVIII molecules, we fused the B2.1 sequence to the N-terminus of MBP, and gel-purified it as a dimeric protein (B2.1-MBP) that is ostensibly formed via B2.1's disulfide bridge. The K d of b12 IgG for B2.1-MBP were in agreement, being 20 nM and 60 nM as determined by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and KinExA, respectively (Table 1) . Agreement between the Kd values derived by different approaches was also observed for the B2.1 synthetic peptide; equilibrium and steady-state SPR analyses using peptide in solution produced Kds of 5.0 and 6.9 \u03bcM, respectively, compared to and in-solution Kd of 2.5 \u03bcM previously obtained with the KinExA instrument. 21 Thus, the difference in b12's affinity B2.1 as an MBP fusion and a synthetic peptide is significant, being between 42 and 345 fold. Taken together, these results confirm our hypothesis that b12 binds with higher affinity to the B2.1 sequence displayed at the N-terminus of a protein, compared to its syntheticpeptide counterpart, even though both forms are dimers comprising two identical disulfidebridged chains. Thus, we suppose that phage-borne B2.1, which was selected and optimized in the context of the phage, 21 has an affinity closer to that of the B2.1-MBP fusion than to the B2.1 synthetic peptide.",

The asymmetric unit of the crystals consists of a single B2.1 molecule, comprising a disulfide-bridged homodimer (chains P and R), in simultaneous contact with two opposing Fab (chains L, H, and M, K) ( Figure 2 (a)). The two Fabs in the asymmetric unit are essentially identical in structure. In addition, the structures of the two Fab b12 regions in complex with B2.1 peptide are nearly identical to the unliganded b12 Fabs contained within the intact b12 IgG1. 9,10 The only noticeable difference is for the CDR-H3s of the peptidebound b12 structures, which have a slightly taller vertical projection than the equivalent CDR-H3s of the unbound b12 structures (0.6-3 \u212b root-mean-square deviation (rmsd) for the main chain, and 3-8 \u212b rmsd for all atoms, including the distal tip of the Trp H100 side chain; Figure  2 (b)). Arg L29, which contacts Phe P7 of the peptide, and Arg L32, which contacts Asp P9, also adopt slightly different conformations in the bound and unbound structures, due to ligand interaction. In addition, Ser L28 adopts a different rotamer from the unbound structures, although it does not contact peptide (Figure 2(b) ). Otherwise, the overall similarity in structures between the bound and free b12 Fabs (average rmsd. of 0.74 \u212b for all main-chain atoms in all possible combinations of free and bound forms) implies that no gross conformational changes accompany peptide recognition, and that the extended CDR-H3 maintains its rigidity upon B2.1 binding.",

Each chain then forms a hairpin, reverses direction, and extends across CDR-L3 to terminate at CDR-H2 (Figure 3 (a)). The most significant region of peptide interaction is within the depression between CDRs L1, L3 and the light chain N terminus (Figure 3(b) ). Here, Phe P7 forms a side-chain hydrophobic contact with Arg L29 (Figure 3 (c)) as well as hydrogen bonds between its mainchain carbonyl oxygen to the Arg L32 guanidinium nitrogens of CDR-L1 (Supplementary Table 1 ). Ser P8 contacts Ala L93 and Ser L94 indirectly via a water molecule. Asp P9 contacts Ile L28a, Arg L29 and Ser L30 of CDR-L1. Leu P10 contacts the N terminus of the light chain, although these contacts differ between peptide chains P and R due to structural differences between the flexible N termini of the antibody light chains. In peptide chain P, Leu P10 interacts with a side-chain carbon of Ile L2 (Figure 3 (c)), whereas in peptide chain R, Leu R10 contacts a side-chain carbon of Glu M1 (Supplementary Table 1 ). N-terminal residues of the peptide mediate interaction with CDR-H3, where Met P6 contacts Gln H100e and Ser P4 abuts Pro H100d ( Figure 3 (d)). In addition, the side chain of Arg P13 hydrogen bonds to the main chain of Asp H100a and Asp H100b in CDR-H3, although this interaction is only observed for one of the two peptide chains. Various C, C\u03b1, and C\u03b2 atoms of the Orn-Lys-Lys C-terminal extension of B2.1 make hydrophobic contact with CDR-H2. However, these contacts are likely to result from crystal packing rather than specific binding, as they differ for each peptide chain and involve residues that were not part of the original peptide sequence selected by b12. Furthermore, a well-ordered 3-(cyclohexylamino)-1 propanesulfonic acid (CAPS) buffer molecule is also observed bound to CDR-H3 of Fab LH (Suplementary Data, Figure 1 ). This interaction is of interest as the H3 loop of the antibody is key for recognition of the CD4 binding site on gp120. 10",

BALB/c mice were subcutaneously immunized seven times with synthetic B2.1 peptide conjugated to ovalbumin (OVA). B2.1 was immunogenic in this context, producing an average half-maximum serum titer of \u223c73,000 (Table 3 ), yet the sera reacted poorly with gp120 Ba-L , even at low serum dilutions (i.e., titers 1:50). Immunization of BALB/c mice with recombinant B2.1 displayed on the surface of phage, or with synthetic B2.1 conjugated to f1-K phage, also produced a range of very strong anti-peptide titers with averages ranging from \u223c4,000 to \u223c100,000, respectively. However, these immunogens failed to elicit gp120 cross-reactivity (Table 3) . Similar results were obtained using C57BL/6 mice (data not shown). One mouse, immunized with B2.1-expressing phage, produced a titer of \u223c13,000 against the B2.1 peptide, yet failed to produce significant gp120 reactivity (data not shown). BALB/c mice immunized with the B2.1-f1.K conjugate produced somewhat higher anti-B2.1 peptide titers than those immunized with phage displaying the B2.1 sequence (Table 3) , probably because of the increased B2.1 copy number (\u223c1200 copies per B2.1-f1.K phage compared to \u223c200 copies per B2.1 phage). In conclusion, the B2.1 sequence did not elicit antibodies in mice that are functionally similar to b12.",

Whereas Phe P7 seems to be important for binding to both b12 and the murine anti-B1.2 antibodies, significant differences in the effect of Ala substitutions were observed for critical residues, Tyr P5 and Cys P14, which maintain the B2.1's dimeric structure (the Tyr P5 residues of the B2.1 chains stack on each other, whereas its Cys P14 residues form a disulfide bridge that covalently connects the chains). Substitution of these two residues with Ala ablated binding to b12, but did not significantly affect the anti-B2.1 peptide reactivity of the immune mouse sera, indicating that most antibodies elicited by the B2.1/OVA conjugate in mice differ in their fine specificity from b12.",

We have characterized the mode of peptide binding to b12, and have compared it to models proposed for b12-gp120 interaction based on extensive mutagenesis of b12 11 and gp120. 8 Our previous hypothesis was that B2.1 might resemble the D-loop of gp120, based on sequence homology, 21 and the requirement of Asp 279 of the Dloop for binding to b12. 9,11 However, our analysis of the structure of B2.1 synthetic peptide bound to Fab b12, together with the Ala substitution data on phage-displayed B2.1 indicate that, besides Arg 13, only a single cluster of residues, whose core comprises three contiguous CBRs (Phe 7, Ser 8, Asp 9), is in direct contact with b12 Fab. Thus, B2.1 \"mimic\" at most one to two sub-sites on gp120, and not the entire b12 epitope. Our immunization studies with the B2.1 peptide also support this conclusion in showing that B2.1 does not elicit detectable crossreactivity with gp120. The recently-determined co-crystal structure of Fab b12 bound to a gp120 core has revealed that gp120 binds a site removed from the B2.1 binding site, and provides proof that the B2.1 peptide and gp120 interact with b12 by very different mechanisms (pers. comm., P. Kwong and T. Zhou, Vaccine Research Center, NIH, Bethesda, MD).",

These residues are required for b12 binding to B2.1 via critical contacts with Phe P7 and Asp P9. The involvement of these residues in binding to gp120 is also now unclear, as CDR-L1 does not appear to contact gp120 (pers. comm., P. Kwong and T. Zhou). Our study has also revealed that Ala substitution of residues in b12 that do not contact B2.1, such as Asp100f, Asn100g, Tyr100h and Tyr100i of CDR-H3, can also affect binding of b12 to both B2.1 and gp120 11 (Supplementary Table 2 ). These residues are most likely required to maintain the b12 structure, at least, for B2.1 peptide binding. We previously supposed that there must be some overlap in the binding sites for B2.1 and gp120, since there is reciprocal cross-reactivity between gp120 and the B2.1; each antigen can block 100% of b12 binding to the other. 21 However, Figure 2 (b) shows that the structure of CDR-H3 changes somewhat on Fab binding to B2.1; perhaps this or some other structural change induced by peptide binding affects the ability of b12 to bind gp120. Alternatively, the two antigen binding sites on b12 may be close enough or overlap sufficiently to sterically hinder the approach of the alternate antigen when the other ligand is already bound. Our present conclusion, that B2.1 does not mimic the b12-epitope on gp120 and binds to b12 by a different mechanism, is consistent with our recent results with three other MAbs, for which crystal structures of the original Fab-cognate antigen complexes showed that they also bind to discontinuous epitopes 33,34,35 (unpublished data M. I., L. Craig, A. M., M. M. and J.K.S.). Nevertheless, in all four cases, the peptide ligands selected from phage display peptide libraries competed with the original cognate antigen for antibody binding. However, none of the peptide mimics elicited antibodies that were cross-reactive with their cognate antigens. The crystal structure of the Fab-peptide complex described here has allowed us to differentiate contact residues from those required to maintain the structure of the peptide. The structure has also elucidated that only a highly restricted portion of the B2.1 sequence directly contacts b12; therefore, B2.1 cannot reproduce the many critical contacts that b12 very likely makes with the gp120 epitope.",

Thus, the degree to which they faithfully mimic the contacts that the corresponding cognate epitopes make with the same antibodies is unknown. Only one published study has tested the hypothesis that a peptide can mimic the gross structure and antibody contacts made by a cognate epitope. 36 In this study, which involves a peptide that cross-reacts with a carbohydrate epitope, the corresponding crystal structures of the peptide and oligosaccharide individually complexed with the Fab of an anti-carbohydrate antibody showed that both ligands bind in the same overall region of the Fab, but by different structural mechanisms, but the Fab uses different residues to contact each antigen. Interestingly, while the intrinsic affinities of the Fab for each antigen differed by only two-fold, entropic vs. enthalpic contributions of the carbohydrate and peptide to binding were very different. Furthermore, another study compared complexes of the HIV-1 neutralizing antibody 2G12 with a phage-display-selected, gp120-cross-reactive peptide and with oligosaccharide fragments corresponding to the 2G12 epitope on gp120; these studies revealed only slight overlap in the binding footprints on 2G12 for the two antigens (A.M., D.A. Calarese, C.N. Scanlan, K.C. Chow, R. Kunert, R.L. Stanfield, H. Katinger, D.R.B., I.AW. and J.K.S., manuscript submitted). Thus, in those cases, as in the results presented here, it appears that, in screening peptide libraries, antibodies select peptides to fit their cognate paratope, or part of it, but may accomplish binding through very different contacts for peptide and cognate epitope. While these two studies did not test the peptide ligands for immunogenic mimicry, our immunization studies here with the B2.1 peptide clearly showed its failure to elicit gp120-binding antibodies.",

Using the b12 antibody to screen a phagedisplayed peptide library, the authors identified peptides bearing a binding motif, V(W/F)SD, which is similar to the one we previously described, 21 and is shared by B2.1. Although b12 binding to free, or KLH-conjugated peptide was not observed, immunization of mice with whole phage bearing the peptide elicited weak gp120 cross-reactivity, but no HIV-1neutralizing activity; moreover, the anti-peptide antibodies in the anti-phage sera were neither measured, nor tested for competition with the b12 antibody. These results 37 contrast with the immunization results reported here, for which strong anti-peptide titers were, in fact, obtained, yet no appreciable gp120 cross-reactivity was observed. Moreover, this study showed that the critical binding residues in B2.1 that were recognized by the highest titer, anti-peptide sera were quite different from those recognized by the b12 antibody (Figure 1b) . It is possible that the difference in gp120 reactivity of anti-peptide antibodies between the two studies is due to sequence difference that flank the shared, '(Aromatic) SD' motif in these immunogens . Another possibility is that the contribution of the protein scaffold to the peptide structure is different for the two coat proteins to which the peptides are fused (pIII vs. pVIII). Nevertheless, the work of Dorgham et al. 37 is of interest as it suggests that b12-binding peptides may be able to elicit some, albeit weak, gp120 cross-reactivity. However, in order to conclude that the serum antibodies, or cloned scFvs, produced by phage-immunized mice specifically bind the b12 epitope on gp120, it should be demonstrated that b12 blocks their cross-reactivity with gp120.",

Absorbance at 405 nm and 490 nm was measured using a Versamax microplate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) and reported as OD . To verify the amount of phage bound to wells, replicate phage-coated wells were reacted with 1 ug/ml purified rabbit anti-phage IgG in TBS/Tween containing 1% BSA. After six washes, bound rabbit IgG was incubated for one hour with Protein A/G-HRP conjugate, and after six washes, bound HRP was detected with ABTS solution. The relative binding of b12 IgG and Fab to phage mutants bearing alanine substitutions was calculated as percent binding with respect to B2.1 wild-type phage (100%).",

ELISAs were performed essentially as described above, except that 1 \u03bcg OVA, 200 ng B2.1 synthetic peptide, or 100 ng gp120 (Ba-L isolate, kindly provided by T. Fouts, Institute of Human Virology, MD) were among the antigens adsorbed to microplate wells. Mouse sera were serially diluted in TBS/ Tween containing 1% BSA, added to BSA-blocked microwells, and incubated for two hours at room temperature. The wells were washed six times with TBS/Tween and incubated with goat (anti-mouse IgG (Fc))-HRP conjugate (Pierce) diluted 1:2000 in TBS/Tween. Serum reactivity with B2.1 synthetic peptide and for OVA was reported as an IgG titer (i.e., the inverse of the dilution producing the half-maximal OD 405-490 signal on antigen). Serum IgG reactivity with BSA, gp120 and OVA was weak, and therefore reported as the OD 405-490 produced by a 1:50 serum dilution.

Several methods for SPR analysis were used to validate the results. The affinity of b12 for B2.1 synthetic peptide in solution was determined by a binding-inhibition procedure 54,55 (which measures Kd in solution at equilibrium) as described. 56 For solution measurements using the Biacore and KinExA instruments, independent reactions comprising a fixed concentration of antibody and different concentrations of antigen were allowed to reach equilibrium for 12-16 hours; the free antibody concentration was then determined for each reaction, and the K d calculated using the in-solution affinity models of KinExA and BiaEvaluation 3.1 software. For the SPR kinetic method, several analyte concentrations were injected over immobilized b12 antibody. The B2.1-MBP data were fitted to the 1:1 Langmuir binding model. The B2.1 peptide binding curves plateaued quickly to steady-state and, thus, this K d was calculated using the BiaEvaluation 3.1 steadystate model.",
