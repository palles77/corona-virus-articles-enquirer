Receptor specificities, for example, are sometimes modified in this way, such that cells cultured in vitro in monolayers will support replication of viruses to which they are not susceptible in vivo. We wanted a system with which to study the early interactions of enteroviruses with cells of the ileum, which appears to be the site at which most enterovirus infections are initiated in vivo [1] . Explant cultures, in which the component cells are retained in their normal relationships with each other in the tissue, were examined for this purpose. The use of explant cultures for the detection and study of viruses has been reported in recent years [2-5, 7-9, 11] . Since a close analogy exists between the porcine and human digestive tracts and their respective enteroviruses, use of porcine intestinal explants with porcine enteroviruses provides an animal model system relevant to enterovirus infection of human intestines. This report describes replication of porcine enterovirus 3 (PE3) in an explant system from foetal pig intestine, using photosensitization with neutral red (NR) to distinguish between inoculum and progeny virus [10] ,",

Derbyshire and Collins [3] studied Talfan virus, a porcine enterovirus that does not cause enteritis, and found no substantial virus replication in explants of small intestine until 6-8 days after inoculation; more importantly, virus replication could not be demonstrated consistently and appeared to take place after structural degeneration of the epithelium (which occurred within 48 h), presumably in the lamina propria. Bubenstein and Tyrrell [8] reported replication of poliovirus 1 to 1 \u2022215 10 ~ PFU/ml in explants of human foetal ileum after 6 days' incubation; however, the virus continued to grow to maximal titres in the explants after the original intestinal epithelium disappeared. Wyatt [11] reported replication of poliovirus type 1 in human foetal small intestinal explants, with peak titres of more than 1 \u2022 106 PFU/ml after 6 days; no distinction was made in this study between explants of the ileum and other segments of small intestine, and, surprisingly, virus replication was associated with destruction of the epithelium.",

In particular, this technique might permit comparison between various segments of the intestine as to their ability to serve as the initial site of infection; this is a question which has been much discussed but not totally resolved. Such cultures may also serve eventually to explain the apparent inefficiency with which enteroviruses initiate infection in vivo.",
