They possess a broad spectrum of biological activities, such as antioxidant, anti-tumor, anti-inflammatory, and cardio-protective effects. The present study was aimed to evaluate the protective effect of theaflavin on glycoprotein content and tricorboxylic acid cycle enzymes in high-fat diet and streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats as there was no study on this aspect. Diabetes was induced in male albino Wistar rats by feeding them with high-fat diet and injecting them intraperitoneally with streptozotocin (40 mg/kg b.wt).",

However, the dose at 100 mg/kg b.wt showed a significant reduction in the levels of plasma glucose and Homeostatic Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance with concomitant elevation of insulin when compared to the other two doses (25 and 50 mg/kg b.wt). Hence, 100 mg/kg b.wt was fixed as an effective dose and used for further analysis. Theaflavin administration restored the altered glycosylated hemoglobin, hemoglobin and glycoproteins (Hexose, hexosamine, fucose, and sialic acid) and TCA cycle enzymes (isocitrate dehydrogenase, \u03b1-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase, succinate dehydrogenase, and malate dehydrogenase) near the normal levels by correcting hyperglycemia. Improved histological changes were observed in the pancreas of diabetic rats upon treatment with theaflavin which supported the biochemicals investigated.",

More than 220 million people worldwide have diabetes, and this number is likely to more than double by 2030 (World Health and Organization (WHO), 2009).The management of diabetes with insulin and synthetic oral hypoglycemic drugs (biguanides sulfonylurea and metformin) can produce serious side effects and in addition fails to prevent diabetesrelated complications in many patients. A new diabetic management strategy is needed, and it should be more effective and lessen side effects (Prabhar & Doble, 2011) . In this regards, several species of plants and plant-based compounds have been described in the scientific literature as having hypoglycemic activity due to their perceived effectiveness, minimal side effects, and relatively low costs (De Sousa et al., 2004) .",

So, the blood glucose level is the key indicator to evaluate the success of models and the effectiveness of drugs. Experimental results showed that the drugs can significantly reduce high blood sugar, regulate the glycogen synthesis which was very significant to maintain normal blood sugar and improve glucose tolerance. Hence, blood glucose is a key marker for diagnosis and prognosis of diabetes mellitus. Insulin deficiency causes radical elevation in the levels of blood glucose as a result of excessive production of endogenous glucose by hepatic as well as extrahepatic tissues through gluconeogenic and glycogenolytic pathways and reduced consumption of glucose through glycolytic, TCA cycle, glycogenic, and HMP shunt pathways by various tissues during diabetes mellitus (Soling & Kleineke, 1976) . Moreover, Insulin deficiency and high levels of plasma glucose in diabetic condition may result in an increased synthesis of oligosaccharide moieties of glycoprotein; hexose, hexosamine, fucose, and sialic acid have an important role in the maintenance of structural integrity of the membrane bilayer. Cell surface glycoproteins have vital roles in the transport of vitamins and lipids, in signal transduction as hormone receptors and in immunological specificity.",

Glycoproteins are important components of intracellular matrix, cell membrane, and membranes of sub-cellular organelles (Zachariah & Basu, 1993) . During diabetes, synthesis of glycoproteins was decreased because of reduced incorporation of glucose caused by insulin deficiency. Increased glycosylation of various proteins in diabetic patients have also been reported earlier and the elevated of glycoproteins in diabetics may also be a predictor of angiopathic complications (Konukoglu, Serin, Akcay, & Hatemi, 1999; Rahman, Zafar, & Shera, 1990) In this study, we have observed the altered levels of hexose, hexosamine, fucose, and sialic acid in plasma and tissues of streptozotocin and high-fat diet-induced diabetic rats. Theaflavin and metformin administration to diabetic rats normalized the levels of glycoproteins in plasma and tissues. Decreased hyperglycemic state with increased levels of plasma insulin observed in theaflavin-and metformin-treated diabetic rats might be responsible for the beneficial changes in glycoproteins in the plasma, liver, and kidney. In this context, other researchers have shown that a decrease in hyperglycemia could lead to a decrease in glycoprotein levels (Gandhi & Chowdhury, 1979; Latha & Pari, 2005; Sundaram, Naresh, Shanthi, & Sachdanandam, 2012) .",
