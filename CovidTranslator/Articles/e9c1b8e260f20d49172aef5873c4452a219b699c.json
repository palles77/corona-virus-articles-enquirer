The protein sequence and biological function of KGF-2 are similar to that of KGF-1, or fibroblast growth factor 7 (FGF-7) [1] . KGF-2 is produced by fibroblasts of the dermis, the granulation tissue, and the intraepithelial cdT cells; it acts specifically on cells of epithelial origin, including skin keratinocytes, and intestinal epithelial cells, by binding to FGF receptor 2-IIIb (FGFR2-IIIb) [2, 3] . The accelerating effect of KGF-2 on the rate of re-epithelialization in various animal models has been demonstrated [4] [5] [6] . Furthermore, KGF-2's protective properties against radiation and oxidative stress have also been demonstrated in recent studies [7, 8] . These preliminary data undeniably suggests KGF-2 as a promising candidate for the treatment of epithelial damage. Currently, KGF-2 is already being used in clinical trials for the treatment of venous ulcers [9] and oral mucositis, a severe oral ulceration induced by chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy. Large scale production of this promising therapeutic protein is demanded.",

            "text": "Nevertheless, high quality therapeutic proteins require rapid and efficient strategies for protein expression and purification. Currently, fusion protein technology is an effective way to achieve the goal by enhancing expression, decreasing the proteolytic degradation, improving solubility, and facilitating purification of the recombinant proteins [10, 11] . Despite the current advancements in fusion protein technology, it is still burdened with flaws. Most of the fusion systems produce non-native N-terminal amino acids during the cleavage process of the fusion tag, which may lead to serious effects on the biological activities of many proteins. Small ubiquitin-related modifier (SUMO) family proteins are present in all eukaryotes but absent from prokaryotes. Sumoylation has crucial roles in regulation of gene expression, control of nucleocytoplasmic signaling, and faithful replication of a large and complex genome [12, 13] . SUMO fusion system could overcome the problems described above, and has been used to facilitate efficient expression and purification of several proteins in E. coli [14, 15] . The relative ease of maturation of SUMO fusions allows the target protein to be isolated using a standardized purification procedure; and the properties of the SUMO hydrolase, which recognizes the tertiary structure of the SUMO tag, allow the target protein to be produced with a completely native sequence. Butt et al. [16] have observed that 100 SUMO fusions have been isolated without cleavage within the partner protein. SUMO fusion system has also been successfully applied to some difficult-toexpress proteins including matrix metalloprotease (MMP13), and SARS-CoV proteins [14, 15] .",

Laird et al. [18] have observed that only the trunked form of KGF-2 was robustly expressed in a protease-deficient E. coli host. Recently, Wang et al. [19] demonstrated that recombinant human KGF-2 could be expressed in a yeast strain Pichia pastoris. However, the targeted protein with a molecular weight of 19.3 kDa had a significantly lower expression in the supernatant of transformants, induced in normal conditions, than a peptide with molecular weight of 17 kDa, which is speculated to be the degraded product of recombinant human KGF-2. This result suggests that the recombinant human KGF-2 may be susceptible to proteolytic degradation. Therefore, here we attempt to use a hexahistidine-SUMO fusion strategy for expression and purification of recombinant human KGF-2 in E. coli, aiming at decreasing the chance of proteolytic degradation, enhancing expression and simplifying purification of the target protein with Ni-NTA chromatography.",

Three-step polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was conducted to obtain fusion gene of SUMO-hKGF-2. First, we amplified SUMO gene fragment (F1) from a pET28a/SUMO-MT (constructed in our laboratory) plasmid, which contains hexahistidine tag for purification, using P1 and P2 as the forward primer and reverse primer. Second, hKGF-2 gene fragment (F2) was obtained from pET3c/hKGF-2 (constructed in our laboratory) plasmid using P3 and P4 as the primer pair. Finally, using F1 and F2 as the templates, the full length fusion gene was amplified using P1 and P4 as the forward primer and reverse primer. The product from the last round of PCR was cut with BamH I and Xho I (the restriction enzyme sites in the primers are indicated as italic letters), then it was ligated into previously digested vector pET28a to create the SUMO-hKGF-2 fusion protein expression vector, pET28a/SUMO-hKGF-2.

Recently, SUMO was found to have the abilities of enhancing protein expression level, improving protein folding, and protecting the protein from degradation by functioning as a chaperone and a nucleation site for protein folding. Some difficult-to- The start culture was 2 l in a shake flask. The purity was estimated by densitometry analysis of the protein bands in SDS-PAGE gel express proteins have been successfully expressed using SUMO as a novel fusion partner. The goal of this study is to express recombinant hKGF-2 with SUMO fusion in E. coli. Different host strains including BL21(DE3), BL21(DE3)pLyS, and Rosetta TM 2(DE3) were used to express SUMO-hKGF-2 fusion protein. The corresponding expression level was approximately 12, 14, and 30% of the total cellular proteins, respectively. Accumulating evidence suggests that an excess of rare codons decrease expression level of heterologous proteins in E. coli. Moreover, sequence analysis of SUMO-hKGF-2 fusion gene showed that it contained up to 20% of codons rarely used in E. coli, suggesting that rare codons may restrict the expression of fusion protein. To overcome this problem, Rosetta TM 2(DE3) host strain which is a BL21 derivative was designed to enhance the expression of eukaryotic proteins that contain codons rarely used in E. coli by supplying tRNAs for seven rare codons (AGA, AGG, AUA, CUA, GGA, CCC, and CGG) on a compatible chloramphenicolresistant plasmid. The results showed that Rosetta TM 2(DE3) strain is suitable for high-level expression of SUMO-hKGF-2 fusion protein.",

As a His tag was fused at N-terminal of SUMO-hKGF-2, one-step purification with Ni-NTA affinity chromatography was used to purify fusion protein. Moreover, since both SUMO fusion protein and SUMO contained an N-terminal His tag, hKGF-2 could be readily and rapidly purified from the cleaved SUMO-hKGF-2 samples by re-applying the cleaved samples to the Ni-NTA column. Another important property of hKGF-2 expressed by our SUMO fusion strategy is that it is biofunctional, indicating its feasibility of further large scale production.",

Furthermore, this method also protects hKGF-2 from proteolytic degradation in E. coli cells. Hexahistidine-tagged SUMO-fusions facilitated rapid and efficient purification of biological functional recombinant hKGF-2. These results manifest the essentiality of SUMO-fusion proteins by establishing a foundation for which large-scale production of hKGF-2 could be made possible. The practicality of this technique is very well worth considering for potential clinical practices. ",
