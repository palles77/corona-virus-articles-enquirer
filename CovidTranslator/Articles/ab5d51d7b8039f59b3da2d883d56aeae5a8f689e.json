            "text": "LF has been recognized as one of the main virulence components of B. anthracis. Consequently, there is much interest in identifying inhibitors of this metalloprotease. Several hydroxamate inhibitors of LF have been identified 15, 16 , one of which, In-2-LF 16 , has a K i = 1.0 nM in vitro. By incorporating a metalchelating moiety, a potent inhibitor MKARRKKVYP-NHOH (K i = 0.0011 \u00b5M) was generated 17, 18 . Using this information, additional peptidic inhibitors were identified 17 (TABLE 3) . Panchal et al. 19 used a highthroughput assay to analyse the National Cancer Institute's (NCI's) Diversity Set. Several small (nonpeptidic) molecules with drug-like properties were identified (TABLE 3; FIG. 2a) . Some of these compounds were identified via subsequent three-dimensional database mining. On the basis of compounds identified during this study, a common pharmacophore for LF inhibition was generated that will provide a template for identifying new leads. The search for LF inhibitors has also prompted the application of less conventional technologies -for example, a mass spectrometry-based technique was used to identify the inhibitor DS-998 (TABLE 3) 20 . Finally, nature has proven once again to be a pharmaceutical treasure chest: natural products, including epigallocatechin-3gallate (IC 50 = 97 nM), an isolate of green tea (TABLE  3) 21 , and aminoglycosides, including neomycin B (K i = 7.0 nM) 22 , are potent LF inhibitors.",

There are seven BoNT serotypes (A-G), and each cleaves a specific component of the soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor SNARE COMPLEX. This cleavage impairs the release of acetylcholine, and can lead to deadly flaccid paralysis. The toxin is composed of a heavy chain promise 11, 12 . Another method would involve interfering with PA-LF or PA-EF binding events. A polyvalent compound consisting of a polyacrylamide backbone substituted with multiple copies of a peptide (HTSTY-WWLDGAP) provides protection against LF 13 . Finally, identifying or generating molecules that bind within the PA heptamer pore, thereby blocking LF/EF release into the host-cell cytosol, is also a potential avenue for toxin inhibition. In anticipation of such research, Nguyen 14 has generated a structurally viable PA heptamer model that will be useful for future drug discovery. 83 ) binds to a host-cell receptor, where it is cleaved by a furin-related protease, to give active PA 63 . c | PA 63 heptamerizes and can bind to either lethal factor (LF) or oedema factor (EF) (in this depiction the heptamer binds LF). d | The complex is endocytosed, and LF (as shown) or EF (not shown) translocates from the endosome into the host-cell cytosol. e | Therapeutics, in this example NSC 12155 (REF. 19 ), are being designed to enter intoxicated cells and inhibit the protease activity of LF. f | A surface depiction of NSC 12155 bound within the LF substrate-binding cleft is shown.

Furthermore, Breidenbach and Brunger 44 have recently solved the X-ray co-crystal structure of BoNT/A LC complexed with residues 141-204 of synaptosomal-associated protein 25 (SNAP25). This important structure reveals substrate-recognition exosites that could be exploited for inhibitor design. Toosendanin 45 , a triterpenoid natural product, might act at such an exosite. The majority of compounds that inhibit BoNT/B metalloprotease activity are pseudo-peptidic in nature. However, two non-peptidic inhibitors have been described 46, 47 (TABLE 6) . With regard to pseudopeptides, phosphoramidon and three of its synthetic derivatives were found to be weak inhibitors 48 , whereas buforin I has also shown activity against the BoNT/B LC 49 . Recently, a Cys-containing peptide inhibitor was also reported 50 . The most effective pseudo-peptide BoNT/B LC inhibitors to date were identified during the course of several complementary studies. Initially, a series of pseudo-tripeptides with nominal K i values were generated 51 . In subsequent publications 52,53 , side-chain modifications produced more potent inhibitors (TABLE 6) 53 .

SEs and other related exotoxins have been implicated in various disorders and (HC) that targets gangliosidic receptors on nerve terminals, forms a low-pH endosome and translocates the light chain (LC) into the nerve cytosol 26-28 . The LC acts as a zinc metalloprotease, and is responsible for SNARE protein cleavage 29-31 . The HC and the LC therefore provide two viable targets for neutralizing this toxin. The vast majority of research to identify BoNT therapeutics has focused on serotypes A and B. With regard to inhibiting HC activity, Deshpande et al. 32 and Sheridan et al. 33 have proposed that several antimalarial compounds, which delay muscle paralysis following BoNT serotype A (BoNT/A) challenge, act by interfering with the acidity of the toxin-mediated endosome. In addition, Eswaramoorthy et al. 34 have generated a co-crystal structure of doxorubicin bound within the BoNT serotype B (BoNT/B) HC ganglioside-binding site.

In the search for such therapeutics, a number of short 'hinge' peptide inhibitors of the BoNT/A LC have been described 35 . However, the structures of these hinge peptides were not deconvoluted from the test mixtures. Using a substrate-to-inhibitor strategy, Schmidt and co-workers 36-39 generated potent inhibitors of the BoNT/A LC (TABLE 5) . Subsequently, a similar strategy was used by Sukonpan et al. 40 to identify additional peptidic inhibitors. In a recent study 41 , small (non-peptidic and non-chelating) drug-like molecules that inhibit the BoNT/A LC were discovered (TABLE 5) . Two of the most potent inhibitors, michellamine B and Q2-15 (FIG. 2b) , are shown in Although consensus peptides as therapeutics are presently controversial, in some animal models these mimetic peptides have been shown to diminish the toxicity of SAgs [67] [68] [69] . In one such study, Arad and colleagues 70 used a mimetic peptide and produced evidence that divergent SAgs inhibited gene expression of human T H 1 cytokines . In low molar excess over SAg challenge concentration, this peptide mimetic protected mice from the lethal effects of a broad spectrum of these toxins, even when given post-challenge. The peptide is a mimetic of a domain that is structurally conserved among SAgs, yet it is remote from binding sites for MHC class II and TCR. It has been proposed that SAgs might use this domain to bind to a novel receptor that is crucial for their action (Kaempfer R, personal communication). lethal shock syndrome 62 . Many of these exotoxins are relatively easy to produce in large quantities and are remarkably stable. When delivered by aerosol, these agents are highly incapacitating and lethal. Modulating cytokine responses is one of the clear mechanisms to interfere with SE toxicities 63, 64 .",

Fusion inhibition, which has proven fruitful for treating both HIV and influenza 71 , could provide therapeutic opportunities for both viral genera, and is being actively pursued [77] [78] [79] [80] . Inhibition of viral replication seems to be especially feasible for both filoviruses and orthopoxviruses: numerous genomes have been sequenced, several key enzymes identified, basic replicative steps described and structural associations among proteins partially described 77, 81 . This abundance of potential targets could result in several therapeutic approaches, including antisense targeting of the viral genome, inhibition of the replicase or polymerase activity by small-molecule inhibitors, as well as other specific molecular targets essential for the formation of a replication-competent complex 82 . The recent development of reverse genetics and filovirus reporter-based mini-genomes 83 , as well as green fluorescent protein (GFP)-expressing Ebola virus 84 , is expected to significantly facilitate the identification of inhibitors of filovirus replication. Final assembly and viral egress from cells is simpler for filoviruses than for poxviruses. Results from electron microscopy have long indicated that the final assembly of filamentous Ebola and Marburg viruses occurs at cell membranes 85, 86 , and recent work has shown that filoviruses are among the subset of viruses that exploit specialized cell-membrane regions called lipid rafts 87 . Filovirus raft assembly might therefore be a viable target. Reverse genetics experiments can be used to explore whether a putative target, such as furin cleavage site of Ebola virus, is essential for viral infection 88 . Compared with filoviruses, poxvirus egress from cells is considerably more complicated 77 , a situation that would seem to make the target even more vulnerable.

            "text": "Therapeutics for viral infections can be broadly categorized as agents that attack the virus and its replicative cycle directly, or as agents that assist and fortify host immune defences. In principle, there are abundant targets and numerous strategies for both categories. TABLE 8 provides an overview of the strategies and opportunities available for new therapies against a virus, juxtaposed with some of the challenges in bringing such strategies into clinical use. The view presented is necessarily incomplete, but serves to highlight both the apparent vulnerabilities of viruses and the extraordinary challenges inherent to dampening logarithmic viral replication to a medically significant degree. As reviewed recently by De Clercq 71 that antibodies to the viral glycoprotein in conjunction with T-cell responses to this and other proteins are required for optimal protection 94,98-102 . Attempts to influence clinical outcomes in humans by the transfer of plasma from convalescent to ill individuals produced encouraging results 103, 104 , but these studies were inadequately controlled and therefore inconclusive. A common observation in orthopoxviruses is the production of neutralizing antibodies (raised against inactivated virus) that alone prove insufficient to prevent disease and death, but which are protective when combined with an additional antibody population (found in serum from animals that had been infected with live virus) 105 . We repeated this observation both with monoclonal antibodies 106 and with DNA vaccines that evoked antibodies 106, 107 ; in this case, even the most potent neutralizing antibodies (against the vaccinia virus protein L1R) were insufficient to prevent the inexorable spread of virus in infected animals. In contrast, an antibody to a virally encoded cell-surface protein (A33R) was sufficient by itself or in conjunction with anti-L1R to provide robust protection from vaccinia virus in rodents. Others, extending the observations to additional proteins, have reported similar findings 108 , and an experimental DNA vaccine against monkeypox virus in non-human primates yielded concordant results 107 . This raises a question: how might antibodies, in addition to neutralizing antibodies, confer a therapeutic effect? Early observations 92,109 implicated the capacity of antibodies to bind to viral proteins on the surface of infected cells, and subsequent observations, including those with filoviruses and orthopoxviruses, tend to be consistent with the proposed requirement that the targets of non-neutralizing antibodies be externally exposed. Mechanistically, one might evoke complement-mediated lysis of cells, antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (in which Fc receptor-bearing cells destroy virally infected cells), perturbation of late events in viral assembly (as in the drug targeting above) or, as compounds identified that inhibit late particle formation. Additionally, the apparently effective but problematic antiviral drug cidofovir seems to be effective against many orthopoxviruses, and is potentially useful for the treatment of smallpox and vaccinia 71, 89 .",

Although a tremendous amount of effort has been devoted in the past decades to the development of therapeutic strategies targeting virus components, half of this work involves a single virus (HIV). In contrast, the common cellular pathways used by a wide array of viruses have been largely neglected as therapeutic targets. In this regard, genetically engineered microbes represent major challenges for biodefence both because the pathogenicity of the organism might be unrecognized and/or the pathogenicity might be tailored to counter existing pathogen-targeted therapeutics. Host-targeted therapeutics would be the most viable option in coping with such unpredictable challenges. Such host-targeted therapeutics would have two advantages: they would act as broad-spectrum therapeutics and block all of the viruses that use the affected pathway; and they would make it more difficult for the pathogen to develop resistance, because there would be few alternative cellular pathways available for the virus to take advantage of. Besides cellular receptors and cofactors, a number of intracellular pathways, such as the vacuolar protein-sorting machinery 118 , cytoskeletal network 119 and components of cellular antiviral defence 120, 121 , have been identified as crucial for viral pathogenesis. However, despite these advances, our understanding of the host pathways involved in viral pathogenesis remains limited. Genetic approaches such in the case of orthopoxviruses, the targeting of a particularly important but quantitatively minor viral population 105, 108 . In terms of the therapeutic value of antibodies, complexity is added by the search for antibodies in addition to those that can be assayed rapidly by binding or neutralization. Historically, the potency of vaccinia immune globulin (licensed for the treatment of smallpox vaccine complications) was judged by its neutralization capacity, a strategy salvaged by the acquisition of antibodies from donors whose sera also contained many other antibodies as well 110 .",

The goal of some antiviral agents is to tip the balance of the immune response towards innate immunity and allow specific immune clearance mechanisms (adaptive immunity) to take over 111 . At the crossroads of many innate immune responses are interferons, a family of molecules that can directly evoke antiviral responses. However, the utility of interferons as broad-spectrum antivirals has been limited both by the transience and the toxicity of their effects. This has engendered caution about the prospects for a broad array of other newly described cytokines that also stimulate innate immunity. On the other hand, other opportunities for drug intervention have arisen in targeting viral pathogens. The identification of proteins produced by vaccinia and influenza virus that act as interferon antagonists 112, 113 was followed by the demonstration that Ebola 114 and Marburg 115 viruses also make interferon antagonists.

LRN laboratories maintain secure communication channels among themselves, state and local health authorities, CDC and other federal agencies. The mission of the LRN is to maintain a laboratory network that will quickly respond to acts of biological and chemical terrorism. The system is now organized into a collection of surveillance (previously known as level A), confirmatory (level B and C) and national laboratories (level D). FDA-approved assays do not exist for most BSAT. The CDC therefore provides LRN-registered clinical laboratories, which are the front-line laboratory responders to biological terrorism, with approved protocols for most of the category A agents and some category B agents.

This approach, called triangulation identification for genetic evaluation of risks (TIGER) 147 , provides a high-throughput, multiple detection and identification system for nearly all known, newly emergent and bioengineered agents in a single test. This rapid, robust and culture-free system has been used to identify agents such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-related coronavirus before their recognition by traditional methods. Robust and portable systems have been proposed for the development of civilian and military applications. Biosensing represents another evolving mechanism for early detection. Here, single proteinaceous nanometer-scale pores (such as anthrax PA) can be easily applied to provide the physical basis for rapid biosensing applications. The mechanism of nanopore-based detection is simple: analytes that either bind to the nanopore or thread through it alter the ionic current in a characteristic manner. For example, the reversible binding of hydronium and deuterium ions to the \u03b1-hemolysin ion channel causes current fluctuations with amplitude and spectral signatures that indicate the type and concentration of the isotope that is present 148 . The same ion channel was also used to detect and characterize individual molecules of single-stranded DNA that are driven electrophoretically through the pore 149 .

Host-directed detection. A powerful approach for identifying exposed or infected individuals is to develop highly specific and extremely sensitive innate biomarkers that can be detected very early after exposure to a biological agent. There are a number of different types of biomarkers, but one of the most effective methods for identifying highly specific and acutely sensitive biomarkers is through the use of gene-and protein-expression-profiling technologies [151] [152] [153] . The advantage of geneexpression studies is that they are large-scale (able to monitor gene-expression changes across an entire genome in one assay), high throughput and highly cost effective (relative to other methods). For example, one of the areas in which this technology has received the greatest attention is in identifying biomarkers for cancer, a field in which expression profiling has been accepted as a powerful tool for identifying specific biomarkers for disease progression, and discriminating between different subtypes of cancer, and, in some cases, identifying biomarkers for susceptibility to specific therapeutics [154] [155] [156] .",

The FDA might have to review environmental detection technologies if they influence medical decision-making. A measured and conservative approach is likely.

There could be hundreds or thousands of cases before an outbreak is recognized, depending on the sensitivity of the final system. Smallpox virus has a comparatively long incubation time of up to 17 days (TABLE 10) . By the time BioSense detects a smallpox attack, multiple foci of infection across the country, with coincident close contact spread, would most likely already be developing using current disease models 173, 174 . a c b d Figure 3 | A schematic of how components of the national laboratory response network (LRN) coordinate when detecting and diagnosing a biothreat agent. a | Initial responders collect evidence, which is then sent to surveillance laboratories or to confirmatory laboratories directly (b,c). Cooperation between these laboratories facilitates first line response procedures. d | Further confirmation of agent type and area of distribution, is then conducted at national laboratories. facilitated, and that research is focused and completed in a timely manner. In addition, as potential new therapeutics emerge from the drug discovery pipeline, greater involvement from the pharmaceutical industry will be required. It is an accepted fact that the industry is adept at translational research -that is, rapidly and effectively converting potential therapies into approved drugs. However, incentives will need to be put in place to encourage the pharmaceutical industry to conduct such costly studies, and this is where a unifying biodefence entity can have a major facilitating role. Presently, project Bioshield is a start, but needs serious improvements. The ability to develop new therapeutics, and their approval as drugs that can be strategically stockpiled, is urgent. However, new technologies for detecting the release of biothreat agents, and timely protocols for the specific diagnosis of a biothreat agent that has been used, will be needed; this in turn could prevent the chaos that was experienced during the anthrax attacks of 2001. If we start making plans today, and unify our efforts, it will be possible to create a true biodefence shield that will effectively curtail future acts of bioterror.",

This effort has been facilitated by timely and significant increases in support from funding agencies. However, there is a serious lack of organization in how biodefence is currently addressed. Our existing preparedness and response measures are not sufficient to meet the challenges of a bioterrorist attack 158 . This is due not only to a lack of cooperation and coordination, but also to ineffective detection networks, a lack of time-effective diagnostic methodologies and the dearth of a clear vision and strategy to translate all of the publicly funded biodefence research into useful therapies and antidotes. These issues can be easily mitigated with a unified plan of action, orchestrated by a central entity overseeing a comprehensive and organized approach to biodefence. We foresee such a central entity playing a pivotal role in ensuring that cross-communication between agencies is",

The inhibitor sits in close proximity to the enzyme's catalytic zinc (gold). b | Inhibitor Q2-15 docked in the botulinum neurotoxin serotype A (BoNT/A) light-chain (LC) substrate-binding cleft. The BoNT/A LC model is a dynamics conformation 205 generated from the X-ray crystal structure of PDB ref code = 1E1H. Colours are as described for a. Additionally, enzyme residues are rendered in stick. Q2-15 carbons are magenta; and Q2-15 chloro substituents are light green. One of the 7-chloro-quinoline components interacts with the catalytic zinc of the enzyme, whereas the other binds in a pocket located behind the catalytic engine of the enzyme. c | The co-crystal structure of pteroic acid bound in the substrate-binding pocket of the ricin A chain (PDB Ref Code = 1BR6).
