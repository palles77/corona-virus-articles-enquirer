Pneumonia is most common at the extremes of life. Predisposing factors in children include an underdeveloped immune system together with other factors, such as malnutrition and overcrowding. In adults, tobacco smoking is the single most important preventable risk factor. The commonest infecting organisms in children are respiratory viruses and Streptoccocus pneumoniae. In adults, pneumonia can be broadly classified, on the basis of chest radiographic appearance, into lobar pneumonia, bronchopneumonia and pneumonia producing an interstitial pattern. Lobar pneumonia is most commonly associated with community acquired pneumonia, bronchopneumonia with hospital acquired infection and an interstitial pattern with the so called atypical pneumonias, which can be caused by viruses or organisms such as Mycoplasma pneumoniae. Most cases of pneumonia can be managed with chest radiographs as the only form of imaging, but CT can detect pneumonia not visible on the chest radiograph and may be of value, particularly in the hospital setting. Complications of pneumonia include pleural effusion, empyema and lung abscess. The chest radiograph may initially indicate an effusion but ultrasound is more sensitive, allows characterisation in some cases and can guide catheter placement for drainage. CT can also be used to characterise and estimate the extent of pleural disease. Most lung abscesses respond to medical therapy, with surgery and image guided catheter drainage serving as options for those cases who do not respond.",

Tobacco smoking in adults is the single most important preventable risk factor for pneumonia and invasive pneumococcal disease. HIV results in increased rates of disease even when immunocompetence is assumed because of a normal CD4 + T-cell count; thus, lobar pneumonia in otherwise well adults should prompt physicians to consider an HIV test [2] . Pregnancy also results in a marked increase in susceptibility to pneumococcal pneumonia and should be considered in young healthy women presenting with pneumonia [3] .",

This includes both tobacco smoke and smoke related to cooking, heating and so on. Studies of upper and lower respiratory tract infection rates have shown clear correlation with measured domestic smoke levels both in children and among adults who have never smoked tobacco [8, 9] . The mechanism behind this association is likely to involve disruption of the systems that protect the lung against oxidative damage -the lung redox balance. The subject of pulmonary redox balance is still in its infancy, but early data suggest that smoke increases the oxidative stress on pulmonary cells by a pro-inflammatory mechanism [10, 11] , while vitamin levels are crucial in maintaining appropriate anti-oxidant defences. This mechanism provides a possible link with the compelling evidence that zinc supplementation can reduce rates of childhood pneumonia [12] , as zinc is linked to anti-oxidant defence.",

Viral lower respiratory tract infections can manifest in several ways including tracheobronchitis, bronchiolitis and pneumonia. There are no radiological manifestations of note in tracheobronchitis [35] . Bronchiolitis leads to partial airway obstruction with hyperinflation and nodular opacities. Nodules predominate in all forms of viral pneumonia with nodular infiltrates of between 1 and 20 mm [36] . Other common findings are diffuse ground-glass attenuation, which is commonly seen on CT, focal areas of consolidation as the pneumonia progresses and small pleural effusions.",

Initial fears that the 2009 swine variant H1N1 influenza A pandemic would have similar clinical features to SARS have proved unfounded, although severe illness in children is more common with swine flu than with previous seasonal influenza A [43] . Bacterial superinfection is a common occurrence in influenza cases and this has also been observed in H1N1 swine flu [44] . One report on findings in children with H1N1 influenza A has found that chest radiographs in children with a mild and selflimited course of swine-origin influenza A (H1N1) are often normal, but they can demonstrate prominent peribronchial markings with hyperinflation. Bilateral, symmetrical and multifocal areas of consolidation, often associated with ground-glass opacities, are the predominant radiographic findings in children with a more severe clinical course of H1N1 infection [45] .",

In the intensive care setting, the interpretational difficulty with plain films frequently limits their accuracy as a diagnostic tool. CT, with its excellent contrast resolution, is the most sensitive modality for evaluating lung parenchymal infections [71] . In the emergency department setting, a large series of patients with chest radiographic findings of pneumonia also underwent CT examination and CT was found to be useful in guiding therapy or providing an alternative diagnosis [72] . CT, however, is little better than the chest radiograph in helping to determine the aetiology of the infection. Reittner et al [73] found that, with the exceptions of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia and M pneumoniae pneumonia, CT was of little value in the differential diagnosis of the various types of infective pneumonia.",

Although not commonly practiced in the UK, image-guided percutaneous aspiration or biopsy provides another means of obtaining material for microbiological examination.
