It has been demonstrated that MHV-specific CD4 and CD8 T cells are capable of causing demyelination independent of the other T cell subset. Recent work has also demonstrated that activated bystander CD8 T cells mediate significant demyelination. The ability of bystander CD4 T cells to mediate demyelination was investigated using CD4 T cell transgenic mice. The results indicated that bystander CD4 T cells were unable to cause demyelination in MHV-infected mice, despite being recruited into the central nervous system (CNS) and irrespective of activation status. These results suggest that CD4 T cells must recognize antigen in the CNS in order to cause demyelination. D",

By contrast, mice that are immunodeficient, such as those with a genetic disruption of recombination activation gene 1 (RAG1 \u00c0 / \u00c0 ) or mice with severe combined immunodeficiency syndrome (SCID), do not develop demyelination despite harboring large virus titers (Houtman and Fleming, 1996a; Wang et al., 1990; Wu and Perlman, 1999) . These mice die from viral encephalitis 14 -16 days post-inoculation (p.i.) without protection from T cells or antibodies. Adoptive transfer of CD4 or CD8 T cells from immunocompetent mice into MHV-infected RAG1 \u00c0 / \u00c0 or SCID mice results in inflammation and demyelination within 7 days post-transfer (p.t.). Macrophage/microglia recruitment and concomitant demyelination occur rapidly after adop-tive transfer (Wu et al., 2000; Wu and Perlman, 1999) , in large part because pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines are expressed in the central nervous system (CNS) of RAG1 \u00c0 / \u00c0 mice even in the absence of transferred T cells .",

Using MHC class I tetramers and intracellular cytokine staining (ICS), a large fraction of CNS-derived T cells has been determined to be MHVspecific in immunocompetent mice infected with MHV and after adoptive transfer of T cells into infected RAG1 \u00c0 / \u00c0 mice (Haring et al., 2001; Marten et al., 2000a,b; . Despite these sensitive methods of identifying antigen-specific T cells, populations of T cells with unknown specificities exist in the CNS after MHV infection. Although as yet undetermined viral epitopes may be recognized by some of these T cells, some T cells in the MHV-infected CNS are likely not to be MHV-specific. Some of these T cells could be autoreactive, as detected in the CNS of mice with demyelination induced by Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) (Miller et al., 1997) , but autoreactive cells have only rarely been detected in the MHV-infected CNS (Watanabe et al., 1983) .",

Little is known about the trafficking of bystander T cells into sites of inflammation, if they are important in resolution of infections, or if they participate in immune-mediated pathology. In a recent study, we demonstrated that activated bystander CD8 T cells were efficient mediators of demyelination in MHV-infected mice . Using two distinct CD8 TCR transgenic mouse strains, both on a RAG2 \u00c0 / \u00c0 background (P14 and N15), we showed that CD8 T cells with no reactivity to MHV-or CNS-derived antigens could mediate significant demyelination, but only if the T cells were activated either with cognate peptide plus adjuvant, or by infection of the transgenic mice with virus containing the cognate peptide. The amount of demyelination caused by bystander CD8 T cells was approximately one-third to one-half the amount mediated by MHV-specific CD8 T cells at a similar time post infection with MHV (Wu et al., 2000) . The presence of demyelination correlated with increased numbers of activated bystander CD8 T cells, as measured by ICS for interferon-g (IFN-g), in the CNS at the time of peak disease. These results provide strong evidence that activated bystander CD8 T cells are capable of participating in immunopathology.",

In mice treated with hCLIP85:CFA prior to infection, a large fraction (25%, equivalent to approximately 6000 cells/brain; Table 2 ) of CNS-derived TCLi T cells produced IFN-g in response to stimulation with cognate peptide (Fig. 3C, Table 2 ) in the absence of adoptive transfer of MHV-immune cells. After adoptive transfer of undepleted splenocytes from MHVimmune mice, very few TCLi cells responded to stimulation with cognate peptide by making IFN-g (Fig. 3E ) despite the Fig. 2 . Bystander CD4 T cell recruitment into the CNS was increased in the presence of other T cells and after in vivo activation with cognate peptide. Lymphocytes were isolated from the brains of TCLi mice that were infected with MHV (A), infected TCLi mice that were previously treated with hCLIP85:CFA (B, E) and infected TCLi mice that received 5 \u00c2 10 6 undepleted splenocytes from an MHV-immunized B6.PL mouse (C, D, F). Lymphocytes were stained for CD4 and Thy 1.2 (transgenic CD4 T cell marker) as described in Section 2. Lymphocytes from individual animals were analyzed. Histograms shown are representative of results obtained from five TCLi-infected mice, four hCLIP85:CFA-treated, infected TCLi mice and eight infected TCLi mice receiving adoptively transferred splenocytes. Percentages represent the percent of lymphocytes that fall within the indicated gate. Panels D and F were gated on CD4 + cells. presence of a large number of activated MHV-specific T cells (Fig. 3G ,I and Table 2 ). Thus, we observed no functional activation of bystander CD4 T cells in the absence of cognate antigen.",

Although no clear mechanism for this inability has been elucidated, it is most likely a result of the difference in the mechanisms by which CD4 and CD8 T cells mediate demyelination. MHV-infected RAG1 \u00c0 / \u00c0 mice that received adoptive transfer of CD8 T cell-enriched splenocytes from an MHV-immune donor underwent a protracted disease course. These mice survived >11 days p.t. and developed overwhelming demyelination, approaching 40% of the spinal cord. In contrast, recipients of CD4 T cell-enriched splenocytes became moribund within 6-7 days p.t. and exhibited significantly less demyelination (approximately 10% of the spinal cord) (Wu et al., 2000) . These data indicate that MHV-specific CD4 and CD8 T cells cause demyelination by mechanisms that are not completely overlapping. The putative effector function(s) missing from bystander CD4 T cells, which resulted in the inability to cause demyelination, has not been identified. Using a panel of probes for chemokines and cytokines, we have been unable to identify any factors that are critical for demyelination . Our results suggest that macrophage/microglia recruitment or activation is crucial for demyelination to occur. Future studies will be directed at understanding these processes after adoptive transfer of MHV-specific and non MHV-specific T cells.",

IFN-g production was not necessary, however, for CD4 T cellmediated demyelination after adoptive transfer . The ability of myelin-specific CD8 T cells to induce demyelination was also dependent on IFN-g production by these cells in another animal model of MS, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (Huseby et al., 2001) . The mechanisms downstream of IFN-g that ultimately lead to the development of demyelination in either model are unknown. Several possible mechanisms exist, including the increased production by glia of chemokines involved in the recruitment of additional inflammatory cells into the CNS, or the upregulation of antigen presenting molecules on resident cells of the CNS, which may increase the ability of MHV-infected cells to be recognized by incoming T cells. The mechanisms by which CD4 T cells mediate demyelination after MHV infection are less understood.",

Infection of RAG1 \u00c0 / \u00c0 mice with MHV resulted in the expression of several chemokines including MIP-2, MCP-3, MIP-1h, MCP-1, IP-10 and RANTES , which were likely to contribute to the inflammatory process. After adoptive transfer of MHV-specific T cells, recruitment of bystander CD4 T cells was increased. This increase may reflect enhanced production of chemokines, such as RANTES and IP-10 in the CNS after adoptive transfer of CD4 T cell-enriched splenocytes . IP-10, Mig and RANTES are all required for maximal mononuclear cell infiltration into the CNS of MHV-infected immunocompetent mice Liu et al., 2000 Liu et al., , 2001a . Continuous production of IP-10 is also required for maximal inflammation during chronic infection since neutralization of this chemokine resulted in significantly decreased T cell recruitment into the MHVinfected CNS (Liu et al., 2001b) .",

One study, using mice transgenic for an LCMV-specific TCR infected with vaccinia virus (VV), suggested that bystander activation of naive CD8 T cells occurred at low levels. However, Welsh and co-workers, in subsequent studies, showed that this was due to the activation of T cells with dual reactivity to LCMV and a second virus (VV or Pichinde (PV)). Only T cells responding to a subset of LCMV-specific epitopes were elicited by VV or PV. Notably, the anti-LCMV CD8 T cell response elicited by VV was protective against subsequent challenge with LCMV (Brehm et al., 2002; Selin et al., 1994 Selin et al., , 1998 . Also consistent with the specificity of the cross-reactive response, mice doubly transgenic for pancreatic expression of the LCMV gp and for an LCMV gp-specific T cell receptor did not develop diabetes after infection with VV. However, infection with LCMV did result in diabetes, indicating that a response with the correct specificity was able to cause disease (Ehl et al., 1997) .",

Transgenic CD4 T cells trafficked to the eye, were activated, based on surface molecule and cytokine expression, and caused HSK. However, HSK lesions occurred with greater frequency and severity if the bystander CD4 T cells were activated prior to infection (Deshpande et al., 2001; Gangappa et al., 1999) .

The peptide used to stimulate the cells in each panel is indicated at the top of each column. Panels A, C and E show staining of TCLi transgenic T cells after in vitro stimulation with hCLIP85. Panels B, D and F show staining of TCLi cells with no peptide stimulation and serve as controls for panels A, C and E. Panel G shows staining of transferred B6.PL CD4 T cells after stimulation with MHV-specific CD4 T cell peptide M133. Panel H shows staining of B6.PL CD4 T cells with no peptide stimulation and serves a control for G. Panels E -H are gated on CD4 + T cells. Panel I shows staining of B6.PL CD8 T cells after stimulation with MHV-specific CD8 T cell peptide S510. Panel J shows staining of B6.PL CD8 T cells after stimulation with an irrelevant peptide (Ova257) and serves as a control for panel I.
