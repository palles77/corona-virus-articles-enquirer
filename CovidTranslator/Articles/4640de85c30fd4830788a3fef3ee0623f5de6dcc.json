            "text": "The causative agents of infectious diseases are traditionally identified using (i) bioassays, (ii) immunodiagnosis, or (iii) biochemical, biophysical, or microscopic techniques for direct identification. The limitations and merits of these approaches have been discussed by Kurstak et al. (1984a,b) . In summary, bioassays are generally very sensitive, but are often inadequate (long replication time of organisms, antibiotic treatment of patient interferes with cultivation, and sometimes agents cannot be grown in vitro) for rapid diagnosis and treatment. Immunodiagnosis in its various forms will continue to become more important for identification purposes, not only because serological methods have become more refined, but also since the knowledge of the nature of the immune response is increasing rapidly. For example, the paradigm of an IgM primary response and an IgG secondary response seems increasingly oversimplified. However, there will be a shift from the relatively insensitive or complex procedures, such as immunodiffusion, immunoelectrophoresis, agglutination, radioimmunoassay, and immunofluorescence, to enzyme immunoassays. Direct identification will continue to play a role in the diagnosis of infectious diseases, particularly for bacteriology (microscopy), in distinguishing A. Introduction related agents (e.g., electropherograms of rotaviruses), and in the detection of viruses by electron microscopy.",

            "text": "Enzyme immunoassays are rapidly becoming the most important tool in the diagnosis of infectious diseases and increasingly sophisticated formulations of assay systems have been devised. As a general rule, competitive assays are used when specificity is the most important requirement, whereas noncompetitive assays are used when high sensitivity is required. A high specificity is needed when the prevalence of the disease is low, otherwise the majority of positive test results are false positives. In contrast, in the case of diseases with high prevalence, improvements in sensitivity have greater impact on the reliability of the test than improvements in specificity. A numerical example can demonstrate this point. If the prevalence of a disease (i.e., the probability that a positive result is obtained when both specificity and sensitivity are 100%) is 2% and the specificity and sensitivity of the test are both 90%, then a total of 116 positives (18 true positives and 98 false positives) would theoretically be obtained of which only 15.5% are true positives. Increasing specificity will rapidly decrease the number of false positives and thus improve greatly the reliability of the results. For example, increasing the specificity to 95% while keeping the sensitivity at 90% almost doubles the reliability (to 26.9%); conversely, when the sensitivity is increased to 95% but the specificity is kept at 90% the fraction of true positives among the positive test results increases only very slightly, from 15.5 to 16.2%. However, with high prevalence (e.g., 80%) completely different results emerge. When both specificity and sensitivity are 90%, the reliability of positive results is quite good (97.3%), but the reliability of the negative results is relatively poor (69.2%). Thus improvement in the reliability of negative results at high prevalence requires improvement in sensitivity, whereas increasing the specificity has relatively less impact on the reliability of the results. The choice of the enzyme immunoassay in such situations is thus clearly a noncompetitive system with additional steps (enzyme-antibody complexes such as PAP or avidin-biotin systems) for the reasons discussed above. These considerations are of utmost importance but are often overlooked.",

Extrapolation from in vitro studies to in vivo conditions may, therefore, be unwarranted. Second, high density of cells in vitro (e.g., confluence) should be avoided since this leads to a decrease in the quality and reproducibility of the staining. Cells are often best stained at the periphery of the cell layer or at the border of the outgrowth zone.",

The heterogeneity and variability of hyperimmune serum are extremely important characteristics for immunoassays of infectious agents. If two viruses, e.g., HSV-1 and HSV-2, are assayed with a monoclonal antibody to a common determinant, the assay will be unsuccessful in distinguishing the two viruses. However, poly-clonal antisera reflect a multitude of individual activities, some of which will be directed to both viruses while others will not. This results in an improved specificity of the polyclonal antiserum (indicated in literature as \"specificity bonus\"). At the other extreme, however, monoclonal antibodies may be directed to type-specific epitopes on the two viruses resulting in a clear distinction in the assays.",

These economic restrictions combined with an environment ideal for parasite transmission (tropical or subtropical regions) results in widespread parasitic diseases. The simplicity and low cost of enzyme immunoassays are, therefore, real boosts for the diagnosis of many protozoan and helminthic diseases which tend to be the last to benefit from new serological methods. In fact, parasitology has had a prominent position in the development of enzyme immunoassays.

An antihuman \u03bc-chain monoclonal antibody was also used for detection of IgM antibodies to T. gondii by reverse immunosorbent assay (Pouletty et al.. 1985) . Reagents 1. Preparation of wash buffer by diluting 1 volume of concentrated buffer with 24 volumes of distilled water (100 ml per strip) 2. The sera must be diluted with diluted buffer (see 1) 1:101 (at least 10 \u03bc\u0390 of serum with 1 ml of buffer). The controls should be diluted 1:10 with buffer before being brought into the wells or can be pipetted into the wells directly (10 \u03bc\u0390 of control + 90 \u03bc\u0390 of buffer) 3. Preparation of IgM conjugate/antigen mixture by adding 0.7 ml of diluted buffer to each ampoule of IgM conjugate and antigen (one for every strip). Mix the two in a ratio of 1:1 4. Preparation of IgG conjugate by adding 1.4 ml of diluted buffer to each ampoule of IgG conjugate (one for every strip) and mix well 5. Preparation of peroxide/substrate buffer by adding 1.0 ml of urea peroxide solution (one U.P. tablet in 10 ml of distilled water) to the vial of substrate buffer 6. Preparation of substrate by adding 0.5 ml of reconstituted peroxide/substrate buffer (see 5) to 5 ml of distilled water and adding 100 \u03bc\u0390 of TMB solution while mixing. This solution which should be colorless when used is sufficient for four strips Assay procedure 1. Pipet 100 \u03bc\u0390 of the corresponding diluted controls (see reagents, 2) into wells Al ,A2, A3, and B1,B2, B3 and 100 \u03bc\u0390 of diluted serum or plasma (2) into the remaining wells of the appropriate MicroElisa strips (codes Tl for IgG and T2 for IgM). Seal with adhesive tape and incube in incubator or a covered water bath with high relative humidity for 60 min at 37\u00b0C (for all incubation) 2. Prepare IgM conjugate/antigen (reagent 3) or IgG conjugate (reagent 4). Wash the strips four times with buffer (reagent 1). Add to each well 100 \u03bc\u0390 of for IgM strips, conjugate/antigen mixture (reagent 3) and for IgG strips, conjugate (reagent 4). Seal with adhesive tape and incubate for 60 min at 37\u00b0C 3.

Therefore, the latter have not been used as widely as they have been for infectious diseases (virology, parasitology) for which alternative diagnostic methods are not as useful. Nevertheless, enzyme immunoassays are increasingly applied in bacteriology, particularly for cases in which alternatives are less satisfactory.

This method allows large-scale isolation of affinity-purified antibody to LPS, which has a considerable potential for the standardization of serological procedures and for screening and confirmation tests (Butler et al, 1980; Butler, 1981) . Kusama (1983) developed a double-antibody sandwich method for the detection of LPS from the eight most prevalent Pseudomenas aeruginosa serotypes. The importance of P. aeruginosa, an opportunistic pathogen in nosocomial infections, has been increasingly recognized. Its LPS are specific, highly immunogenic, and responsible for various clinical manifestations. They are released in surrounding medium. Kusama (1983) observed that LPS II has a higher reactivity in enzyme immunoassays than LPS I (fractions I and II are separated by gel filtration). This could be due to differences in avidity since Morrison and Leive (1975) observed similar differences in immunodiffusion studies on E. coli 0111:B4 LPS fractions. However, Goldman et al. (1982) showed that E. coli LPS I has neither lipid A nor an oligosaccharide core. Munford and Hall (1979) improved the detectability of gram-negative bacterial LPS by increasing the solubility of LPS with triethylamine, but Kusama (1983) failed to confirm this with enzyme immunoassays. However, Kusama demonstrated that enzyme immunoassays using LPS II are highly sensitive or specific for the various serotypes of P. aeruginosa. Carlsson et al. (1976) screened maternal serum, cord blood, and human milk for antibodies to E. coli 0 LPS. Similarly, Gripenberg et al. (1979) demonstrated antibodies against Yersinia enterocolitica LPS in human serum by enzyme immunoassays. Results quite often differed considerably from those obtained with hemagglutination. The antigen itself could also be detected, but only if 0.5 \u03bcg/liter was present.",

Though Brucella is cultivable, brucellosis has a variable incubation time with an abrupt or insidious onset, so that the majority of tests are confirmatory and based on serology, particularly agglutination (McCullough, 1976) . Enzyme immunoassays are most useful, especially in veterinary medicine, where carriers can be detected by the examination of milk and serum antibodies (Byrd et al., 1979; Thoen et al., 1983) and so serve in eradication programs. However, ideally the microbial antigen should be detected directly. Perera et al. (1983) devised an enzyme immunoassay with a very high detectability for LPS produced by Brucella. They were able to detect 100 fg/ml of solubilized crude LPS (8-10 Brucella cells). After concentration of the sample (serum or plasma) LPS could not be detected, though 10 brucellae added to a suspension of leukocytes from 100 ml of normal bovine blood was readily measured. The failure to detect LPS in concentrated or undiluted serum may be due to inhibitory factors. Though B. abortus is shed in milk, detection is most imperative in pregnant (last trimester) nonlactary animals.",

            "text": "Many diseases require rapid diagnosis for proper treatment. Culture is often too slow or made impossible through the early administration of antibodies (Glynn and Ison, 1981) . For example, the bacterial causes of acute meningitis are most often diagnosed by counterimmunoelectrophoresis (Greenwood et al., 1971) . However, this technique fails to detect antigen in a substantial number of patients (Scheifele et al., 1981; Thirumoorthi and Dajani, 1979; Collins and Kelly, 1983) . However, enzyme immunoassays have at least a 100-fold higher detectability (Drew et al., 1979) and E. coli K 100 (antigenically closely related) does not cross-reac\\ On the other hand, Kaplan et al. (1983) employed enzyme immu-noassays for the detection of capsular antibodies against H. influenzae type b. For this purpose, polyribosephosphate (PRP in the capsule of H. influenzae) is coupled to poly-L-lysine, since alone it does not adsorb reliably to microtiter plates. Prior adsorption of anti-PRP antibodies to the plastic often results in excessive nonspecific adsorption of test sera. Comparisons with radioimmunoassays (Kaplan et al., 1983; Koskela and Leinonen, 1981) are inconclusive with respect to detectabilities and sensitivities. This is far from surprising since the underlying principles of these methods are different. Most often radioimmunoassays for H. influenzae antibodies are based on saturation analysis, whereas the enzyme-mediated method is based on an immunometric assay. Their inherent sensitivity and specificity levels are different, independent of the label used. The most common cause of neonatal sepsis and meningitis is group B streptococcus and the mortality for infants with early-onset infections is about 50%. To prevent vertical transmission, a rapid identification of mothers whose infants may develop infection is necessary. Morrow et al. (1984) developed a monoclonal sandwich enzyme immunoassay which was able to detect 1 ng/ml of native antigen and is serotype specific, whereas Polin and Kennett (1980) devised a competitive immunoassay, also based on monoclonal antibodies, for the same purpose. Meningococcal meningitis is usually diagnosed by culture. However, the detection of these antigens by enzyme immunoassays compares advantageously to other serological procedures (Sippel and Voller, 1980; Sugasawara et al., 1984) , in particular in the latter study when monoclonal antibodies are used (Sugasawara et al., 1984) .",

Beutin etal. (1984) modified these methods by using nitrocellulose membranes as the solid phase (detectability 1 ng/ml). About 95% of normal adults have Clostridium perfringens in their fecal flora and identification of the organism would be insufficient for diagnosis (Bryan, 1969) .

McClane and Strouse (1984) noted that the presence of fecal material apparently decreases the sensitivity of the sandwich assay.

To prevent these undesired reactions, normal serum may be added prior to the tests (K\u00f6per et al., 1980) . S. aureus is important among hospital-acquired infections, and enzyme immunoassay offers advantages over the gel diffusion and counterimmunoelectrophoresis techniques generally used for the detection of S. aureus infections (Carruthers et al., 1984) . A comparison of four versions of enzyme immunoassays showed that the sandwich design with labeled antibody is most satisfactory (Fey et al., 1984) and has a detectability for staphylococcal enterotoxins of 0.1 ng/ml which is far below clinical relevance. This test kit is now commercially available. Many of the procedures for the detection of toxins are based on sandwich methods. These methods require that the second antibody layer (i.e., after solid-phase antibody and test sample with toxin) is either conjugated with enzyme or from a different species so that an anti-immunoglobulin would not react nonspecifically with the solid-phase antibody. This may pose problems in many cases since antibodies for, e.g., staphyloccal enterotoxins presently available are all derived from rabbits, prohibiting the use of anti-rabbit IgG, and many laboratories are not in a position to custom-conjugate enterotoxin antibodies, de Jong (1983) devised a simple but elegant method to circumvent this problem. In his test, de Jong immobilized antibody (1000X diluted in carbonate buffer) and applied the test sample which may contain the enterotoxin. de Jong then mixed an 800-fold dilution of enterotoxin antibody and a 50-fold dilution of anti-rabbit IgG alkaline phosphatase conjugate and incubated this for 2 hr at 37\u00b0C; normal serum (10-fold dilution) was then added, incubated for 30 min, and added to the plates.

This test may detect N. gonorrhoeae that fail to grow on selective media because of the sensitivity of the bacteria to an antibiotic or because they are not viable. In the Gonozyme test treated beads are incubated with a swab specimen and appropriate controls. The bacteria from the positive swab specimen adsorb to the bead. The bead is incubated with antibody to N. gonorrhoeae which reacts with gonococci on the bead. Next, the bead is incubated with antibody-enzyme conjugate containing horseradish peroxidase which reacts with the antigen-antibody complex on the bead. The enzyme reaction after incubation of the washed bead with o-phenylenediamine (OPD) containing hydrogen peroxide (H 2 0 2 ) is determined using a spectrophotometer with wavelength set at 492 nm. Current methods used to identify N. gonorrhoeae in endocervical cultures appear to detect less than 90%. Papasian et al. (1984) evaluated the commercial enzyme immunoassay kit and found a sensitivity and specificity of about 95-98% for specimens from males and 80-88% from females; it would appear that this kit is less suitable for the detection of N. gonorrhoeae in females. This study confirms other reports by Aardoom et al. (1982) and Schachter et al. (1984) but contradicts a similar evaluation by Danielsson et al. (1983) . All investigations agree that this assay has high sensitivity and specificity for detection in specimens from males. The wide discrepancies of results for specimens from females may be due to differences in specimen collection, or may, as Papasian et al. (1984) pointed out, be due to a lack of immunological specificity. The positive predictive value using this commercial kit was about 25% lower for females and needs improvement. It is possible, however, that the choice of culture as standard may not be optimal since this standard may be false negative, and the commercial kit result may in fact be correct, though studies of Stamm et al. (1984) suggest that this is not so. However, this assay could have a major impact on the control of the spreading of gonor-rhea if improved for cervical gonorrhea. For symptomatic gonorrhea, the Gram stain is inexpensive and adequate.",

This method is expensive and the recovery rate is affected by many variables (Reeve et al. y 1975) . The identification of chlamydial antibodies is not as specific as tissue culture but is a very useful adjunct, particularly for epidemiological studies. Though Schachter et al. (1982) suggested that the detection of IgM is the method of choice for the diagnosis of chlamydial pneumonia in infants, Finn et al. (1983) found poor correlation of IgM detection by ELISA with current methods, and Mahony et al. (1983) observed limited sensitivity of chlamydial IgM by ELISA. In contrast Finn et al. (1983) found satisfactory correlations between these techniques and IgG detection by ELISA. Serotype L2 elementary bodies were used as antigens in these studies. Jones et al. (1983) compared the reticulate and elementary body antigens in the ELISA detection of antibodies to Chlamydia trachomatis. Elementary body antigen from a single immunotype may not detect antibodies to another immunotype, whereas the reticulate body antigens appear group reactive. Nevertheless, Jones et al. (1982 Jones et al. ( , 1983 found broad reactivities for both antigens. Less reticulate than elementary body antigens was required to obtain equivalent binding of antibody. Mahony et al. (1983) observed, however, that in their ELISA test the few false negatives obtained were of the C and J serotypes which possess little antigenic relatedness with serotype L2. A major serological problem in the diagnosis of genital chlamydial infections remains the relatively high background (Wang et al., 1977; Schachter et al., 1979) . Some of the background may be due to autoantibodies (Sarkku et al., 1983) known to occur in chlamydial infections (Andersen and M0ller, 1982) . The immunoperoxidase method used in our laboratory to detect C. tramomatis antigens in baby hamster kidney cells (BHK-21) with patients specimens was satisfactory (Fig. 10 .2) and superior to any other histochemical staining. Raymond et al. (1985) demonstrated that a good agreement of results were obtained by the ELISA and microimmunofluorescence assay for detection of antibodies to C. trachomatis.",

(1980) developed a paper ELISA for the same purpose. Dasch (1981) developed a simple procedure for the selective isolation of the protective species-specific protein antigens of Rickettsia typhi and Rickettsia prowazekii which were satisfactory for ELISA.",

This is particularly evident for type A influenza viruses (Laver, 1984) . Some of the antigenic shifts are massive (major antigenic shift). Suddenly, a major antigenic shift in these viruses may occur by the appearance of viruses with a different hemagglutinin (sometimes neuramidase) due to the complete replacement of the RNA segment coding for this antigen. Twelve distinct hemagglutinin subtypes are recognized by WHO. All of the hemagglutin subtypes exist in viruses from birds or lower mammals. There is also a slow but steady antigenic drift. A large number of these antigenic variants were isolated and characterized with monoclonal antibodies (Gerhard and Webster, 1978) . The three-dimensional structure of hemagglutinin has recently been characterized (Wilson et al., 1981) . It contains four independent antigenic areas, one of which is buried, at the distant end of the molecule. Analysis of sequence changes of field strains revealed that this drift does not occur at the same position but may be at a neighboring position (Laver, 1984) and that only a single sequence change may be sufficient to totally abolish the affinity of the monoclonal antibody to the hemagglutinin. A similar situation seems to exist for neuramidase (Webster et al., 1982; Schild, 1984) .",

Class capture assays as designed for RIA were adopted by Duermeyer and van der Veen (1978) for enzyme immunoassays and are used mainly for hepatitis viruses, rubella virus, flavi viruses, and herpes viruses. The design of these assays, discussed in Chapter 4, Section A,l, has improved IgM testing significantly since competition between IgG and IgM is eliminated. This method can be shortened by labeling the antigen (Schmitz et al., 1980; van Loon et al., 1981) . This method may have some drawbacks, however. The IgM is extracted from the serum irrespective of whether it is an antibody and the sensitivity of the test is related directly to the ratio of specific IgM antibodies to total antibodies (Heinz et al., 1981) .",

IgG can be removed when practical, e.g., with protein A, a procedure that has been found effective (Johnson and Libby, 1980) . On the other hand, rheumatoid factor may be eliminated to a greater or lesser extent with polymerized IgG [heat aggregated (Meurman and Ziola, 1978; Leinikki et al., 1978) , glutaraldehyde (Krishna et al., 1980) , or IgG-latex particles (Vejtorp, 1980) ]. None of these methods is completely satisfactory and all have been shown to fail in certain cases. It is important to remember for enzyme immunoassays that antibodies labeled with an enzyme tend to aggregate leading to false positives for sera with rheumatoid factor (Yolken and Leister, 1981; Yolken et al., 1983) . F(ab') 2 does not react with rheumatoid factor since it lacks Fc, and is a prime candidate for class-capture assays. Heterologous IgM antibody reactions may occur quite often with closely related viruses (Aaskov and Davies, 1979; Burke and Nisalak, 1982) , though their titer tends to be low. This requires highly purified antigens (Katze and Crowell, 1980) , and may also provide a means to perform group-specific diagnosis.",

An infection may be asymptomatic in newborn babies, without the generation of persistent antibodies (Gust et al., 1977) , whereas in young children, an infection results mostly in acute diarrhea and the appearance of persisting antibodies (Flewett and Babiuk, 1984) . Reinfection at a later age (symptomatic or asymptomatic) raises the antibody titer. The disease occurs in both endemic and epidemic forms and is estimated to be second in frequency only to the common cold in the United States (Cukor and Blacklow, 1984) . Several viruses may cause gastroenteritis and identification and characterization of the causative agent are needed to understand its epidemiology or immunology and to manage the disease. Among the viruses causing gastroenteritis, rotavirus and Norwalk virus are medically the most important etiological agents, but enteric adenoviruses, caliciviruses, astroviruses, and coronaviruses have also been implicated, though, a host of other virus(like) particles was found in diarrheal stool specimens by electron microscopy.",

Zissis and Lambert (1978) distinguished two human serotypes. The relationship between these two types was elucidated by a rescue technique of noncultivable rotavirus by gene assortment during mixed infection with bovine rotavirus (Greenberg et al., 1981) . Kalica et al. (1981) demonstrated that the subgroup specificity is determined by the major inner capsid protein and the serotype specificity by an outer capsid glycoprotein. The serotypes (four for human rotaviruses) can be distinguished by neu-tralizing antibodies, whereas the subgroups can be distinguished by, e.g., ELISA. Electropherotyping is unlikely to be useful for classification (Chanock et al., 1983) since many different electropherotypes can be distinguished (32 different ones detected from 149 cases by Spencer et al., 1983) and different sequences do not necessarily correlate with different migration patterns. Cukor and Blacklow (1984) suggested that electropherotyping may be of use for limited epidemics or for the study of antigenic drift (evolution of new rotavirus strains). Rotavirus antigens can be localized in the cells by the direct immunoperoxidase technique (Kurstak et al., 1981) with high resolution (Fig. 10.4) . Recently Grom and Bernard (1985) described an enzyme-linked cell immunoassay for detection of rotavirus antigens in which the advantages of the cell culture system for virus isolation are combined with enzyme immunodetection and spectrophotometrical reading of the test.",

In the original enzyme immunoassay, the reactivity of the test specimens was compared to the reactivity of known negative stool samples (Yolken et al., 1977) . Neutralization tests with high-titered antirotavirus serum was thought to be unnecessary for routine testing. However, it became clear that the frequency of nonspecific reactions was high (Krause et al., 1983) . Different modifications have been made to improve reliability, such as adding normal serum, reducing or chelating agents, protease inhibition, or pH neutralization (Hammond et al., 1982; Hogg and Davidson, 1982; Hovi et al., 1982; Beards et al., 1984) . Krause et al. (1983) found the commercial Rotazyme EIA to be unreliable for neonatal specimens. The Rotazyme test seems less sensitive than indirect enzyme immunoassays (Cukor and Blacklow, 1984) . The Rotazyme test from Abbott Laboratories (Table 10. 3) is based on the use of anti-simian rotavirus serum. The assay depends on the fact that simian (SAH) and human rotaviruses share a common group antigen. Cukor et al. (1984) prepared a monoclonal antibody to the common rotavirus antigen (the sixth viral gene product). This reagent was superior in both sensitivity and specificity to the Rotazyme. Their study did not, however, include diarrheal stools of neonates. Coulson and Holmes (1984) developed an improved enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for the detection of rotaviruses in feces of neonates. First incubation 1. Pipet 200 \u03bc\u0390 of each control and each diluted specimen into appropriate reaction tubes or tray wells 2. Add one bead to each tube or well containing specimen or control 3. Apply cover seal gently, tap the tube or tray to cover bead with sample and remove any trapped air bubbles 4. Incubate at 37\u00b0C for 60 min 5. Discard cover seal. Wash each bead three times with 4 to 6 ml of distilled or deionized water Second incubation 6. Add 200 \u03bc\u0390 to enzyme conjugate into each tube or well 7. Apply new cover seal. Tap tube or tray gently 8. Incubate at 37\u00b0C for 60 min 9. Prepare OPD substrate solution (5 to 10 min prior to color development) 10. Discard cover seal. Wash each bead three times with 4 to 6 ml of distilled of deionized water. Remove all excess liquid from the tube or tray by aspiration or blotting Color development 11. Immediately transfer beads to EIA assay tube 12. Add 300 \u03bc\u0390 OPD substrate solution to each assay tube and two empty tubes (substrate blanks) 13. Cover and incubate at room temperature (15-30\u00b0C) for 30 min 14. Immediately compare the color intensity of each tube to the color chart (visual test: do not add acid). Add 1.0 ml \\ N sulfuric acid to each tube. Agitate to mix. Blank spectrophotometer with a substrate blank at 492 nm. Determine absorbance of controls and specimens at 492 nm (for photometric method select a wavelength of 492 nm on a spectrophotometer or use the Quantum analyzer-Abbott). 15. Determine cutoff value by calculating the mean of absorbance of the controls (none of the individual controls should differ more than 0.5 or 1.5 time the mean). Add 0.075 to obtain the cutoff value. The gray zone is defined between 0.75 and 1.25 times the cutoff value For this purpose the rabbit antiserum against SA11 rotavirus was incorporated as both coating and detector antibody, and rotavirus-negative rabbit serum was applied as a coating antibody control to eliminate false positive results. A pretreatment of stools with 0.25 M EDTA increased both specificity and sensitivity of the assay. Bishop et al. (1984) expressed the activity of rotavirus antibody in human sera as units derived from a standard curve, a method successfully adapted by de Savigny and Voller (1980) . They found this to be of particular value for longitudinal epidemiological studies of the effects of neonatal rotavirus infections.",

However, for the detection of antibodies to rotaviruses the adsorption of antigens to the solid phase is desirable. In an epidemiological survey Ghose et al. (1978) used antigens directly adsorbed to the solid phase. Inouye et al. (1984) found that rotavirus antigens could be efficiently adsorbed to the solid phase if pretreated with chaotropic agents (1 M NaSCN, 3 M guanidine-HCl), but that, in order to detect fecal antibodies, an excess or proteins (e.g., fetal calf serum) should be added to protect the antigens from proteolytic activity of feces. In a recent investigation Beards et al. (1984) observed that the inclusion of 0.01 M EDTA into the buffer to dilute the antigens increased the detectabihty of the assay considerably. This is probably due to the conversion of the rotavirus particles to an incomplete form, thus exposing the rotavirus group antigen (Cohen, 1979) . EDTA may thus be effective in reducing false negative results in samples containing predominantly complete particles (Beards and Bryden, 1981) . EDTA should be used at high concentrations since, particularly in neonates, samples may have high calcium ion levels.",

The traditional hemagglutinin and neuramidase inhibition tests are relatively insensitive. Turner et al. (1982) compared the ELISA to hemagglutinin inhibition (AHI) tests and found increases in geometric mean antibody titers with ELISA to be 16 to 71fold, whereas for HAI this was only 3-to 10-fold (depending on antigen used for assay) on infection. Julkunen et al. (1985) found also that the efficacy of enzyme immunoassay in detecting diagnostic antibody uses to influenza A and B viruses was higher when compared with complement fixation and hemagglutination inhibition tests. The presence of antibodies can be tested in sera or in nasal washings. Murphy et al. (1981) detected with ELISA primarily IgG-isotype antibodies to influenza in sera and IgAisotype antibodies in nasal washings. The antibodies manifested a hemagglutin subgroup specificity. Therefore, Murphy et al. (1981) devised a sensitive ELISA for hemagglutinin instead of whole virus. Similarly, Khan et al. (1982a) developed an ELISA for influenza virus neuramidase-specific antibodies. Khan et al. (1982b) also developed an ELISA to M protein (isolated by SDS-gel chromatography), antibodies to which are generally present in patients with severe illness. Hammond et al. (1980) noted a lack of subtype specificity by ELISA. They used end-point titers to find differences, but as pointed out by Madore et al. (1983) , this method may be inadequate. Madore et al. (1983) observed significantly greater antibody concentrations with influenza infection when the areas under the doseresponse curves were considered (or the area generated between the two response curves) than with the end-point method. Many of the other data processing methods also rely on the assumption that the dose-response curves are parallel, but in fact the curve may become steeper without an increase in the end-point.",

Detection of antigens in cells by immunofluorescence or immunoperoxidase can speed up diagnosis but is not as sensitive. Harmon and Pawlik (1982) developed an ELISA for the direct detection of influenza A antigens without prior cultivation. Virus-specific guinea pig immunoglobulins were coated to polystyrene microtiter plates and the antigens were captured from the specimens. This was followed by successive incubations with virus-specific rabbit antiserum and goat antirabbit immunoglobulin antibodies conjugated with peroxidase. The detection limit of the standard test equalled about 10 3 5 TCID 50 units. The inclusion of 1% gelatin in the last two incubations increased sensitivity 3to 6-fold not only because of decreased background but also, interestingly, because of increased readings. This method detected 50-60% of the isolation-positive clinical specimens. Harmon and Pawlik (1982) obtained similar results for the detection of respiratory adenovirus. It is important to note that some patients with clinical findings of influenza virus infection do not have virus shedding (Ksiazek et al., 1980) . It should be possible to increase the sensitivity of the antigen detection by ELISA significantly with some of the new techniques available. Though hemagglutin preparations are not generally available it is relatively simple to purify them (Phelanera/., 1980).",

            "text": "Parainfluenza viruses are a common cause of acute respiratory illness in infants and children. The traditional laboratory diagnosis involves the isolation of the virus from throat swabs or nasopharyngeal secretions and cultivation in primary kidney cell cultures. However, the difficulties in transportation and storage of parainfluenza viruses are notorious; infectivity is very rapidly lost. The identification of the virus produced in the cells is achieved by hemadsorption of guinea pig erythrocytes or hemagglutinin inhibition. These methods are expensive and time consuming. On the other hand, the immune response may also take 2-3 weeks. Wong et al. (1982) found an immunofluorescence assay for the antigen in nasopharyngeal epithelial cells to be more reliable and faster. Sarkkinen et al. (1981a,b) compared immunofluorescence, radioim-munoassay, and enzyme immunoassay for the detection of parainfluenza type 2 and found excellent agreement. They noted that nasopharyngeal washings contained too little antigen in about 50% of the positive cases, both with radio-and enzyme immunoassays. In contrast, aspirating the secretions with a mucous extractor through the nostrils from the nasopharynx yielded specimens which gave, after sonication for 3 min with a sonicator with a microtip, excellent results. No false positives were observed, though the authors advised blocking tests for low absorbance values. Ukkonen et al. (1980) devised an ELISA for parainfluenza-type 1 antibodies. They did not detect an increase in IgM antibodies in cases of increasing antibody titers with the complement fixation method. Van der Logt et al. (1982) confirmed this observation, detecting IgM antibody in a low proportion of the infections. Recently, Julkunen (1984) compared enzyme immunoassay with the complement fixation test for parainfluenza virus antibodies. In this study performed on 180 patients with respiratory symptoms, EIA was found to bring significantly more diagnostic rises in parainfluenza virus type 1, 2, and 3 antibodies compared to the CF test. The enzyme immunoassay could be the diagnostic procedure of choice in parainfluenza virus infections, where reinfection are frequent, with the virus replication usually limited to the upper respiratory tract, and consequently, the antibody responses often remaining faint.",

However, IgM antibody production can be highly variable following secondary infections (Sutherland and Briggs, 1983) . Removal of rheumatoid factor is essential to prevent false positives (Kangro et al., 1984) . Booth et al. (1979 Booth et al. ( , 1982 developed a CMV IgG-antibody test and compared it to other serological methods. Poor correlation was found between RIA and EIA titers. It seems that different antibodies are labeled for these two tests. The anticomplement immunoperoxidase method offers a sensitive method for the specific detection of intranuclear inclusion bodies in infected cells (Fig. 10.5 ). 4.8) . The intranuclear inclusion bodies are specifically stained, whereas the intracytoplasmic inclusion body can be observed by the insignificant background staining. The positive CMV serum was diluted 40x and 1:10 fresh CMV-negative serum was added for complement. The conjugate was diluted 100x. Courtesy of Dr. Yoichi Minamishima and Dr. Seigo Yamamoto with permission to reproduce. Kurstak et al. (1971) used light and electron microscope immunoperoxidase staining for the detection of cytomegalovirus antigens in infected human fibroblasts. It was possible to shorten substantially the time necessary to diagnose infection in comparison with the CPE method. Recently, Sarov and Haikin (1983) proposed a potential application of the indirect immunoperoxidase IgA assay for serodiagnosis of CMV infection using sequential serum samples of patients. Since the persistence of IgA antibodies depends on the virus involved, individual variations among the patients, and, most importantly, on the sensitivity of the method used to detect specific IgA, the immunoperoxidase IgA assay was suggested. In another work Singer et al. (1985) adopted the immunoperoxidase method for detection of serum IgM antibodies to CMV. The antigen consisted of CMV infected human embryonic fibroblasts or isolated nuclei. Rabbit antihuman IgM peroxidase conjugate was used to detect IgM bound to viral antigen. The indirect immunoperoxidase was also recommended as an advantageous method in both diagnosing and evaluating CMV mononucleosis (Abramowitz et al., 1982) .",

            "text": "Class-capture assay for rubella-specific IgM antibody proved a simple, sensitive, and specific alternative for IgM anti-rubella testing and compared favorably to other approaches (Isaac and Payne, 1982) . This method, developed by Duermeyer and van der Veen (1978) , avoids the time consuming or expensive physical separation of IgG from IgM by sucrose density gradient centrifugation or exclusion chromatography (Vesikari and Vaheri, 1968; Gupta et al., 1971) . Class-capture assays using F(ab') 2 conjugates proved reliable and sensitive (Isaac and Payne, 1982) . Removal of nonspecific inhibitors is not necessary and volumes of only 5 \u03bc\u0390 of sample are required. The clinical validation of antibody-capture antirubella IgM-immunoassay was performed by Wielaard et al. (1985) . In their study using monoclonal antibodies IgM was found by EIA in 99 sera on total of 103 sera, known to contain anti-rubella IgM by a sucrose density gradient method. In a second study, 16 out of 17 acute rubella infections were detected by the IgM-EIA. The specificity of the antibodycapture EIA was high and no interference was seen in 60 rheumatoid-factor positive sera, in 100 highly positive IgG sera. Recently Bonfanti et al. (1985) developed a new solid phase enzyme immunoassay for detection of rubella-specific IgG. This procedure uses polystyrene microtiter strips coated with rabbit anti-human IgG immunoglobulins as the solid phase and an enzyme-labeled semipurified rubella antigen as indicator. An advantage of their direct enzyme immunoassay is that the same method and some labeled antigen can be used to test for different classes of immunoglobulins using simply solid phase coated with capture antibodies of different chain specificity. Best et al. (1984) demonstrated problems that may occur when detecting rubella-specific IgM with the Rubazyme-M (Abbott Diagnostics) and the M-antibody capture radioimmunoassay (MACRIA). They recommended that results for rubella-specific IgM should be interpreted with caution. Rubazyme-M is not (currently) recommended by the manufacturer for the diagnosis of congenital rubella by examination of cord blood. This was supported by Best et al. (1984) who found 2/20 false negatives from neonates with evidence of intrauterine infection. In contrast, false positive results due to rheumatoid factors or anti-nuclear antibody were not obtained. Rubella-specific IgM detected in sera from patients with infectious mononucleosis may be due to EBV stimulation of B lymphocytes specific for rubella or result from an incorporation of cellular antigens in the lipoprotein envelope of the rubella virus used as antigen (Morgan-Capner etal., 1983) . Kurtz and Malic (1981) showed that a disadvantage of the ELISA system is that the presence of rheumatoid factor may cause false positive results. The RF can attach the patient's IgG rubella antibody to the solid phase, or it can react with altered IgG in the conjugate. They overcome the latter problem by removing altered IgG from the conjugate or by conjugating only the Fab 2 portion. Another possibility to assure the specificity is to perform a duplicate test on each serum, omitting the addition of antigen.",

Contrary to initial beliefs, HSV type 1 is a frequent cause of genital lesions (38% of isolates; Balachandran etal., 1982) . This is important since HSV type 1 infections differ from HSV type 2 infections with respect to recurrence and response to chemotherapy and their association with cervical carcinoma (De Clercq et al., 1980; Rawls et al., 1980; Reeves et al, 1981) . Frame et al. (1984) developed a double-antibody enzyme immunoassay for HSV typing by employing a polyclonal rabbit capture antiserum with type-common and type 2-specific monoclonal antibodies (Killington et al., 1981) as detectors. This assay is 100% sensitive and 100% specific compared with cell culture and restriction endonuclease analysis. A typing index of 1.5 (ratio of optical density with the HSV-type common antibody to the optical density with the type 2-specific antibody) had been selected for distinguishing type 2 isolates from type 1. HSV-2 antigens can also be detected with the direct immunoperoxidase method on cytosmears of cervical scrapings (Fig. 10.7) , as well as HSV-1 antigens in the bullae of typical erythema multiform lesions after mild, recurrent, localized skin infections (Major et al, 1978) .",

(1978) developed an indirect varicella-zoster virus en- zyme immunoassay whereas Whreghitt et al. (1984) devised a competitive varicella-zoster virus enzyme immunoassay. Though the complement fixation test is usually satisfactory, it is surprisingly inadequate for the detection of anti-varicella-zoster virus antibodies in sera from hemodialysis patients. The competitive enzyme immunoassay is more specific than the indirect assay, though its potential sensitivity is lower (Kurstak, 1985) . It is, however, 20 times as sensitive as complement fixation (Whreghitt et al, 1984) . Cox et al. (1984) developed an in situ enzyme immunoassay to viral membrane antigen to enable the specific estimation of antibodies to varicella-zoster virus. Such a rapid screening test for these antibodies for possible inclusion in zoster immune globulin pools used to alleviate severe clinical effects of infection, particularly due to the shortage of this immune globulin, is essential. For this purpose cells were fixed with 0.05% glutaraldehyde. The in situ enzyme immunoassay can then be expected to be specific for membrane varicella-zoster virus antigen, whereas cross-reacting internal antigen (not expressed at host membrane) does not interfere. Also for diagnostic purpose the immunoperoxidase method was applied successfully to detect antigenic material of herpes zoster virus on cutaneous lesions of patients with dendritic keratitis (Laflamme et al., 1976) .",

The test for HBe is essentially the same (antibody-antigen-antibody sandwich).",

The delta antigen or hepatitis D virus has the appearance of a large HBsAg particle (35 nm), and has HBsAg coat which surrounds an internal component consisting of a small RNA molecule (500 kDa) and \"delta antigen.\" It can be detected in the nucleus of hepatocytes of patients late in the incubation period and in the beginning of the acute phase (Mushahwar et al., 1984) . Shattock and Morgan (1984) developed an enzyme immunoassay to detect delta antigen and anti-delta antibodies. They designed a method with superior sensitivity. Instead of the usual antigen preparation from sonicated liver nuclei preparations, they derived the antigen from detergent-treated serum.

We have followed the infection sequences of different alphaviruses (Sindbis, Chikungunya) by immunoperoxidase. For example, BHK-21 cells infected with Chikungunya virus contained, as revealed by the immunoperoxidase technique, antigens of the viral envelope in the cytoplasmic membrane ( Fig. 10.9 ), and on some intracytoplasmic vacuoles. Kurstak et al., (1980) and Charpentier et al. (1982) postulated, therefore, a process of reverse pinocytosis or exocytosis since specifically stained vacuolar membranes were incorporated in the cytoplasmic membrane. The envelope antigens are incorporated by budding at areas of the cytoplasmic membrane which were positively stained. The usefulness of the immunoperoxidase technique has also been shown for the study of the synthesis of antigens of Dengue-2 and Sindbis viruses. With this method it was possible to demonstrate that Dengue-2 virus antigen is inserted into the plasma membranes (Catanzaro et al., 1974) and that Sindbis virus core antigen is easily detected in the cytoplasm of CER cells (Kurstak et al., 1980) .",
