Assuming a workforce of 30 million, this figure represents a direct cost to British industry of \u00a315 billion ($27 billion) each year.",

As stated by Greenberg, Finland leads the field, but it is a legislative requirement in many countries that all businesses employing more than a relatively small number of workers must provide access to occupational health services. Such services can only be led by legislation from an enlightened government that clearly understands the benefits of occupational health and its value to the economy and the health of the nation. ",

He is right in stating that the UK was a world-class player in academic occupational health in the 1970s, but that the situation today is very different. I believe that the reason for this decline is the failure of successive governments to promote the benefits of good occupational health services to all employers. In the past, such benefits were recognised by most larger employers, who provided comprehensive in-house occupational health services. However, over recent years many of these services have been downgraded or outsourced to external providers. By contrast, the discipline of occupational medicine itself has gained credibility through establishment of the Faculty of Occupational Medicine and a clear postgraduate training and examination structure.",

            "text": "One contribution to solving this problem could be to regulate the price in relation to the portion size of certain high-calorie foods such as hamburgers, fried chips, and sugar-containing drinks. A standard size of portion could be defined by governments, and the cost of larger ones be made the same multiple of the weight. So, for example, a hamburger weighing 170 g would cost twice as much as a standard 85 g hamburger. This would tend to focus competition on reducing price and increasing quality, rather than to provide larger portions for the same or similar price. The effect on consumer choice could be tested in pilot trials. ",
