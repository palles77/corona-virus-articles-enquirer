Hospitals send RODS data from clinical encounters over virtual private networks and leased lines using the Health Level 7 (HL7) message protocol. The data are sent in real time. RODS automatically classifies the registration chief complaint from the visit into one of seven syndrome categories using Bayesian classifiers. It stores the data in a relational database, aggregates the data for analysis using data warehousing techniques, applies univariate and multivariate statistical detection algorithms to the data, and alerts users of when the algorithms identify anomalous patterns in the syndrome counts. RODS also has a Web-based user interface that supports temporal and spatial analyses. RODS processes sales of over-the-counter health care products in a similar manner but receives such data in batch mode on a daily basis. RODS was used during the 2002 Winter Olympics and currently operates in two states-Pennsylvania and Utah. It has been and continues to be a resource for implementing, evaluating, and applying new methods of public health surveillance.",

Mandatory laboratory reporting 4 is also illequipped for early detection, because it takes time before tests are ordered and specimens are obtained, transported, processed, and resulted.",

For completeness, we note that biosensors are being developed (and deployed) that detect organisms in the air and that this type of detection, if feasible, occurs fundamentally much earlier, because the delay introduced by the incubation period of the disease is eliminated from the surveillance system. 7 However, such approaches face unsolved technical problems in the analysis of contaminated specimens (the norm in air sampling). Biosensors also need to be in the right place-on every person's lapel or every street corner and hallway-to provide complete surveillance coverage.",

These methods are generally referred to as syndromic surveillance because they have the goal of recognition of outbreaks based on the symptoms and signs of infection and even its effects on human behavior prior to first contact with the health care system. 8 Because the data used by syndromic surveillance systems cannot be used to establish a specific diagnosis in any particular individual, syndromic surveillance systems must be designed to detect signature patterns of disease in a population to achieve sufficient specificity. For example, it would be absurd to use only the symptom of fever to attempt to establish a working diagnosis of inhalational anthrax in an individual, but it would be very reasonable to establish a working diagnosis of anthrax release in a community if we were to observe a pattern of 1,000 individuals with fever distributed in a linear streak across an urban region consistent with the prevailing wind direction two days earlier. It would be beyond reasonable and, in fact, imperative to establish a working diagnosis of public health emergency if presented with such information.",

Examples of such data include absenteeism data, sales of over-the-counter (OTC) health care products, and chief complaints from EDs. 9 The expenses of manual data collection are avoided; however, the data obtained typically are noisy approximations of what could be obtained by direct interviewing of the patient (in the case of individual level data). Both approaches may play complementary roles with current methods of public health surveillance 10-12 by assisting the physician and public health official with a continuously updated picture of the ''health status'' of a population. 13, 14 A focus of our research has been syndromic surveillance from free-text chief complaints routinely collected by triage nurses in EDs and acute care clinics during patient registration. We have deployed this type of surveillance at the 2002 Winter Olympics and in the States of Pennsylvania and Utah. We described a previous version of the RODS system, 12 but the system has undergone considerable subsequent development both architecturally and functionally.

This design objective is complex and difficult to operationalize because of the large number of organisms and the even larger number of possible routes of dissemination all requiring potentially different types of data for their detection, different algorithms, and different time urgencies. For this reason, our focus since beginning the project in 1999 has been on the specific problem of detecting a large-scale outbreak due to an outdoor (outside buildings) aerosol release of anthrax. Additional design objectives were adherence to NEDSS standards to ensure future interoperability with other types of public health surveillance systems, scalability, and that the system could not rely on manual data entry, except when it was done in a focused way in response to the system's own analysis of passively collected data.",

When a patient arrives at an ED (or an InstaCare in Utah), the registration clerk or triage nurse elicits the patient's reason for visit (i.e., the chief complaint), age, gender, home zip code, and other data and enter the data in a registration computer. The registration computer then generates an HL7 ADT (admission, discharge, and transfer) message and transmits it to the health system's HL7 message router (also called an integration engine). There usually is only one message router per health system even if there are many hospitals and facilities. These processes are all routine existing business activities and do not need to be created de novo for public health surveillance. Figure 1 shows the flow of clinical data to and within RODS. The hospital's HL7 message router, upon receipt of an HL7 message from a registration computer, deletes identifiable information from the message and then transmits it to RODS over a secure virtual private network (VPN), or a leased line, or both (during the 2002 Winter Olympics we utilized both types of connections to each facility for fault tolerance). The RODS HL7 listener maintains the connection with the health system's message router and parses the HL7 message as described in more detail below. It then passes the chief complaint portion of the message to a Bayesian text classifier that assigns each free-text chief complaint to one of seven syndromic categories (or to an eighth category, other). The database stores the category data, which then are used by applications such as detection algorithms and user interfaces.",

After 2 minutes, over-the-counter data will be displayed. The Main screen can be used as a ''situation room'' display. emergency room notes. Its purpose is to provide additional public health surveillance functions that would not be possible if it were located outside of the firewall due to restrictions on the release of identifiable clinical data. The HSRC uses patient identifiers to link laboratory and radiology information to perform case detection. In the past, we have used HSRC to monitor for patients with both a gram-positive rod in a preliminary microbiology culture report and ''mediastinal widening'' in a radiology report. The HSRC is a case detector in a distributed outbreak detection system that is capable of achieving much higher specificity of patient diagnostic categorization through access to more information.",

This feature requires a token that can be passed to a hospital information system that can uniquely identify a patient, and the reason we have prototyped this feature in the HSRC and not in RODS is simply that HSRC runs within the firewall so an unencrypted token can be used. The lookback is accomplished as follows: when a public health user identifies an anonymous patient record of interest (e.g., one of 20 patients with diarrhea today from one zip code), HSRC calls the UPMC Health System Web-based electronic medical record system and passes it the patient identifier. UPMC Health System then requests the user to log in using the UPMC-issued password before providing access to the record directly from its own secure Web site. This approach is not intended to be implemented in HSRC, but rather in the RODS system outside of the firewall of a health system. It is intended to use encrypted identifiers that the health system would decrypt to retrieve the correct record. The HSRC could provide the encryption-decryption service or it could be provided by another data system in the hospital. We estimate that the prevalence of health systems that have Web-based results review in the United States is 30% to 50% and growing so that this approach could very quickly improve the efficiency of outbreak investigations. For these reasons, we have moved to an application service provider model for dissemination in which we encourage state and local health departments to form coalitions to support shared services. We also have been fortunate to have sufficient grant funding from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania to be able to support these services on an interim basis while sustainable funding models evolve.",
