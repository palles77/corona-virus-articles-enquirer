TU-52 tagging entails cell-type specific expression of uracil phosphoribosyltransferase (UPRT) and 53 administration of 4-thiouracil, with the assumption that only cells expressing UPRT would 54 incorporate 4-thiouracil into transcribing RNA. Thio-RNA can then be purified and used for 55 downstream gene expression analyses, or alternatively combined with SLAM-Seq to identify 56 labeled transcripts. TU-tagging has proven useful in several additional systems [14, 16, 17], 57 however, given endogenous [18] and alternative [19] pathways for uracil incorporation, the 58 labeling specificity in this method remains unclear.

            "text": "59 al [15] and by Sharma et. al [13], labeling with TU-tagging of PolI and PolIII transcripts is 60 inefficient, rendering tRNAs and ribosomal transcripts unlabeled. Indeed there are only a limited number of techniques enabling in-vivo targeted labeling of RNAs. 62 In addition to TU-tagging, 5-ethynylcytosine-tagging (EC-tagging) [20] is a new method, which 63 utilizes cell-type specific co-expression of cytosine deaminase (CD) with UPRT to achieve RNA 64 labeling with 5-ethynyluridine (5EU) following administration of 5-ethynylcytosine. Both TU and 65 EC tagging use cre-recombination to express the relevant enzymes in a tissue specific manner and 66 stochastic expression from the cre-promoter may lead to unwanted expression of the enzymes in 67 different tissues [21]. Finally, one recently developed method called Mime-seq allows for cell type 68 specific labeling of microRNA [22]. In this method, tissue specific expression of a plant derived 69 methyltransferase mediates a 3\u2032-terminal 2\u2032-O-methylation of microRNAs that, when combined 70 with a methylation dependent library construction, allows for sequencing of tissue specific 71 microRNAs. Mime-seq allows labeling of miRNAs alone leaving other RNA biotypes unlabeled. 72 Given the need for a technique that allows for a Cre-independent and unbiased labeling of total 73 RNA transcription in-vivo, we developed iTAG-RNA [For In-vivo Targeted Tagging of RNA]. 74 This method incorporates mouse genetics with a novel uridine analog and an established RNA 75 labeling chemistry to allow tagging of total RNA in target cells in-vivo. Using iTAG-RNA we are 76 able to identify transcriptional re-programming of hepatocytes in-vivo following an acute high fat 77 diet stress and to enrich for and identify hepatocyte derived plasma ccfRNAs. Moreover, we are 78 able to identify RNA-based liver-to-adipose RNA transfer. These liver derived ccfRNAs include 79 variable coding and non-coding RNAs such as miRNAs and tRNAs. Among the miRNAs 80 transferred from liver to adipose tissue we find mir-33, mir-10b and mir130a, which target major 81 regulators of cholesterol and lipid efflux and bio-synthesis such as Srebf1 [23], Abca1 [23, 24], 82 Ppara [25] and Pparg [26] respectively. 83 Our study demonstrates for the first time an unbiased technique that allows labelling, tracking and 84 quantification of variable types of ccfRNAs from their transcriptional source to downstream 85 tissues, in which they can potentially act to regulate expression of target genes. We demonstrate 86 RNA-based liver-to-adipose transfer of a myriad of RNA transcripts and their response to an 87 environmental challenge. The continued identification and characterization of RNA based 88 signaling in-vivo is imperative for the understanding of developmental, physiological and 89 pathological processes, and can aid in the future development of relevant disease biomarkers.",

            "text": "Small molecule design and genetic approach for targeted in-vivo labeling of RNA 93 5-Ethynyl Uridine (5EU) is a synthetic uridine analogue extensively used in RNA turnover studies 94 [27] [28] [29] . The nitrogenous base contains an alkyne group that can be covalently linked to an azide 95 group using a simple copper mediated reaction called click chemistry [30, 31] . This synthetic base 96 has been demonstrated to incorporate into transcribing RNA in place of uridine and have little to 97 no biological effects thereafter [27] . Following administration to mice, 5EU is readily taken up by 98 cells with no regard to cell identity, depending to some extent on the administration method and 99 dosage used [27] . Here, we present a novel method for the targeted in-vivo delivery of 5EU. 100 To achieve this, we designed a 'pro-drug' of the 5EU base (HD5EU) that is based on the 'Hep-101 Direct' pro-drug design [32, 33] (Figure 1a) . This design was developed to target small molecules 102 and nucleotide analogues to the human CYP3A4 enzyme and several small molecules of this 103 design have been or are currently in clinical studies [34] [35] [36] . The human CYP3A4 enzyme 104 catalyzes an oxidative cleavage of the HD5EU small molecule which, following a spontaneous 105 beta-elimination, results in the formation of 5EU mono-phosphate that can then be incorporated 106 into transcribing RNA (Figure 1a ). HD5EU was synthesized by Chiroblock GmbH, the identity 107 of the final product was validated using MS, p-NMR and h-NMR and the molecule's purity was 108 assessed at over 98% (Sup. Figure 1a-d) . 109 In addition to the HD5EU small molecule we took advantage of the published humanized liver 110 specific CYP3A4 mouse line FVB/129P2-Cyp3a13 tm1Ahs Del(5Cyp3a57-Cyp3a59) 1Ahs 111 Tg(APOE-CYP3A4) A1Ahs obtained from Taconic [37, 38] . These humanized mice (hCYP3A4) 112 express the human CYP3A4 enzyme under a modified Apolipoprotein E (APOE) promoter and 113 are stably knocked out for nine homologous murine genes, thus leaving the human enzyme as the 114 sole member of the enzyme family to be expressed in a Cre-independent, tissue-specific manner 115 in-vivo. In keeping with published data on the activity of the modified ApoE promoter [39] , qRT-116 PCR and WB analyses demonstrate restricted expression of the human Cyp3a4 enzyme to liver 117 and kidney (Figure 1b-c) . As such, upon administration of the HD5EU small molecule to the 118 humanized CYP3A4 mice, we expect the molecule to be metabolized to bioavailable 5EU mono- 143 To test and validate the metabolism of the HD5EU small molecule, we first isolated primary 144 hepatocytes from hCYP3A4 mice. Following an 8 hour treatment of primary hepatocytes with 145 1mM HD5EU or 5EU, nuclear staining similar to 5EU labeling is clearly evident following click- We administered HD5EU to humanized CYP3A4 mice and already 2 hours following 153 administration found robust nuclear staining in hepatocytes and kidney epithelial cells but in no 154 .

This in contrast to mice administered with 5EU where nuclear staining was 155 evident in multiple tissues (Figure 2b-c and sup. Figure 2a) . Of note, animals administered with 156 HD5EU did not demonstrate any visible side effects. In addition we could not detect any signs of 157 DNA damage or apoptosis in the liver during the different treatment regimens as demonstrated by 158 staining for phosph-P53 and cleaved Caspase-3, supporting HD5EU as a non-toxic agent (Sup To validate that nuclear staining evident in-vitro and in-vivo following HD5EU treatment is indeed 177 indicative of 5EU incorporation into transcribing RNA, we adopted the mass-spectrometry method 178 described by Su et. al [41] . Using a column with a smaller inner diameter and lower flow rates to 179 improve the response of individual nucleotides, we were able to identify a wide range of 180 unmodified and modified nucleotides (Sup. Table 1 ). 5EU (m/z 269.0768) was well separated quantify 5EU incorporation into both short (less than 200bp) and long RNA isolated from the liver 195 of HD5EU treated mice, 2 hours following the administration of the compound (Figure 3f-g) . 8h 196 following HD5EU administration 5EU was still detectable in long RNA (though it could not be 197 accurately quantified as it was below quantification limit), whilst only a moderate reduction was 198 detected in short RNA. 199 Taken together, these results confirm that HD5EU is metabolized in a CYP3A4 dependent manner 200 to 5EU, which is then incorporated into transcribing RNA.

To this end we fed mice with high fat (HFD) or control 241 low fat (LFD) diets for two weeks. Following this acute HFD exposure, which is expected to alter 242 the transcriptional program in the liver [42], we administered HD5EU 2 hours before sacrificing. 243 We then continued to generate poly-A RNA libraries from kidney and liver input and pull-down 244 RNA.",

CYP3A4 catalyzes the oxidative cleavage 457 of an aryl group of the HD5EU molecule, which in turn undergoes spontaneous beta elimination 458 to produce a bio-available 5EU-monophosphate. The existing transgenic mouse model allows in-459 vivo labelling of hepatocytes and kidney proximal renal epithelial cells (Figure 2), as the tissue 460 expression pattern of the enzyme dictates the site of the small molecule's metabolism and 461 subsequent RNA labeling. To validate the specificity of HD5EU metabolism, we demonstrate that 462 HD5EU is indeed metabolized in a CYP3A4 dependent manner to 5EU-monophosphate. 5EU is 463 then incorporated in place of uridine into transcribing RNA (Figure 2-3) and allows highly 464 selective RNA precipitation and sequencing of labeled RNAs (Sup. Figure 3 and Figure 4a). 465 Development of new transgenic models would allow for labeling of multiple tissues of choice. 466 Administration of HD5EU allows enrichment for the transcriptional program of proximal renal 467 epithelial cells and hepatocytes in-situ without disruption of the kidney or liver architecture 468",

The transcripts we identified as labeled in 487 VsWAT demonstrated a greater overlap than expected by chance with labeled plasma ccfRNAs or 488 indeed with labeled transcripts in the liver, supporting their hepatic transcriptional origin. These 489 transcripts including miRNAs and mt-tRNAs (Figure 6b), with the identified miRNAs implicated 490 in post-transcriptional regulation of proteins involved in lipid, cholesterol and fatty acid pathways. 491 Together our results directly demonstrate for the first time, in-vivo transfer of a large variety of 492 RNAs including miRNAs between hepatocytes and visceral adipose tissue (Figure 6g), with the 493 identity of transferred RNAs varying following an acute dietary challenge. In light of the observed 494 diversity and scope of RNA transfer between hepatocytes and adipocytes, our results suggest that 495 the pool of small RNAs in a cell in-vivo results from a balance not only between transcription and 496 degradation, but also influx and efflux of small RNAs from the extracellular environment (Figure 497 6h), with the latter serving as a buffering mechanism for transcriptional and physiological 498 responses in target cells. 499 To date, the majority of potential ccfRNA biomarkers associated with liver pathologies have been 500 miRNAs [71]. Our findings suggest that fragments of protein coding genes together with 501 mitochondrial tRNAs and mitochondria encoded transcripts can also serve as useful biomarkers 502 for hepatic function. Development of additional genetic models similar to the one used can allow 503 for better transcriptional characterization of distinct cell populations in-vivo, with the added 504 benefit of labelling endogenous ccfRNAs in-vivo. Lastly, HD5EU may prove beneficial in clinical 505settings. As metabolic activation of HD5EU requires the human Cyp3a4 enzyme, whose 506 expression under physiological conditions is largely limited to the liver (The human protein atlas.",
