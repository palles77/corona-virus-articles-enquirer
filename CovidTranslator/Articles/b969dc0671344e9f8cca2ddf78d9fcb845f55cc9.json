            "text": "Japanese encephalitis (JE) is one of the leading causes of acute encephalopathy affecting children and adolescents in the tropics. JE virus (JEV) infection causes prominent neurological sequelae in approximately one-third of the survivors. In humans, the inflammatory response of CNS consequent to JEV induced viral encephalitis is mediated through chemokines released by various cells of CNS. In the present study, the chemokine profiles of mouse neuroblastoma cells (N2A) following JEV infection was analyzed by cDNA microarray followed by real-time RT-PCR. Eighty mRNA transcripts belonging to various functional classes exhibited significant alterations in gene expression. There was considerable induction of genes involved in apoptosis and anti-viral response. Modified levels of several transcripts involved in proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory processes exemplified the balance between opposing forces during JEV pathogenesis. Other genes displaying altered transcription included those associated with host translation, cellular metabolism, cell cycle, signal transduction, transcriptional regulation, protein trafficking, neurotransmitters, neuron maturation, protein modulators, ER stress and cytoskeletal proteins. The infection of neurons results in the synthesis of proinflammatory chemokines, which are early important mediators of leukocyte recruitment to sites of viral infection. Our results clearly suggest the implication of chemokines in neuropathogenesis of JEV infection leading to neurological sequelae. Pro-and antiinflammatory agents targeted against chemokines such as CXCL10 may provide possible therapeutic modalities that can mitigate the morbidity associated with JEV infection of the CNS.",

            "text": "Japanese encephalitis has become a major cause of mortality and morbidity in wide areas of south and southeast Asia and kept in a zoonotic transmission cycle between pigs or birds and mosquitoes (Burke et al., 2001; Solomon et al., 2003; Tsai, 2000) . JEV spreads to dead-end hosts, including humans, through the bite of JEV-infected mosquitoes and causes infection of the central nervous system, with a high mortality rate (Parida et al., 2006a) . JEV targets the CNS, clinically manifesting with fever, headache, vomiting, signs of meningeal irritation, and altered consciousness, leading to high mortality and neurological sequelae in some of those who survive (Kumar et al., 1990) . After entry into the host, JEV generates a rapid inflammatory response, including peripheral neutrophil leucocytosis or infiltration of neutrophils in extraneural tissue. Clinically, the infection of JEV results in increased levels of cytokines such as macrophage-derived chemotactic factor, TNF, and interleukin-8 (IL-8) in the serum and cerebrospinal fluid (Khanna et al., 1991; Ravi et al., 1997; Singh et al., 2000) . The increased levels of inflam-matory mediators appear to play a protective role or initiate an irreversible immune response leading to cell death. Despite the fact that Japanese encephalitis is a major disease affecting the tropical world, little is known of its pathogenesis due, partly, to the lack of a suitable animal model and the complex cell interactions in infected individuals. JEV tends to cause a neurotrophic infection, attacking neural rather than non-neural tissues in humans. Experimental studies in rats have demonstrated that neuron cells, especially developing neurons are the major target cells for infection. The role that neurons play in the induction of the immune response following CNS viral infection is poorly understood, largely owing to the belief that these cells are immunologically quiescent. In order to understand the nature and consequence at the transcriptional level, we have carried out the microarray analysis of mock-infected and JE virus-infected murine neuroblastoma cells. The microarray data was validated with qRT-PCR experiments and time point analysis was done to demonstrate the induction of chemokine by JEV-infected neurons as an early defense mechanism. We employed mouse neuronal cells (N2A) as a model system because of the permissiveness of these cells to JEV infection (Murali-Krishna et al., 1995; Yang et al., 2004; Lin et al., 2004; Hong-Lin et al., 2002) . In this study, we demonstrated that virus infection of neuronal cells results in the strong induction of proinflammatory chemokines along with robust anti-viral response. The replicating virus within the infected host neurons alters normal gene expression profiles, which can be of significance in JEV pathogenesis at the molecular level.",

Ccl5-Ccr5 interaction provides anti-apoptotic signals for macrophage survival during viral infection. Ccl5-responsive genes comprise a significant number of enzymes, transcription factors, and miscellaneous molecules involved in neuronal survival and differentiation, including neurite outgrowth and synaptogenesis (Valerio et al., 2004) . There was significant upregulation of a number of ubiquitin-proteasome system related genes such as Usp18 during JE virus replication but it was unclear if this response was anti-viral or if the JE virus utilized components of the ubiquitin-proteasome system for its replication. We found significant upregulation in anti-viral response genes like IFN induced Isg15, Viperin, Mx 2, anti-viral genes like oligoadenylate synthetase, Parp14, Irgm, transcription factor-like STAT and ER stress regulated genes like Herpud1, ATF6 and XBP1. The marked elevation in expression of these genes at 36 h post-infection suggests a highly notable anti-viral response to JEV pathogenesis. Downregulated genes were mainly from focal adhesion and CNS signature, as detailed and vast study is required to elaborate the importance and involvement of these significantly downregulated genes in JEV pathogenesis. Genes like Lypd3, Lgi4 are involved in protein binding, neuron maturation, myelination, etc. The realtime RT-PCR validated genes elucidate the varied transcriptional responses of JE virus-infected neuroblastoma cells. Together with other identified differentially expressed genes, these transcripts provide a better understanding of the pathogenesis of JEV at a transcriptomic level, particularly the molecular events that underpin host defense mechanism against JEV infection.",

Specific components of the response to virus such as Viperin, G1p2, Ifit3, Atf3, Irgm and CXCL10 have been implicated in JE infection for the first time to the best of our knowledge. Future research is required to explore the mechanism of JEV modulation of these genes to evade the host defense response. Our study offers an overview of the cascade of changes in host cellular expression culminating from infection with JEV. The counterbalancing of several anti-inflammatory and proinflammatory pathways together with the variable expression of apoptosis-related genes is a significant finding of the present study.

The emerging picture from this study implicates a central role for the immune response in the pathobiology of JE infection. It will be interesting to compare the host response to different JEV isolates with inactivated preparations of the virus. The present study implies that neurons play an important role in their own defense against viral infections. Although this challenges the long-held belief that neurons are immunologically quiescent, an improved understanding of the proinflammatory effects responsible for immune-mediated control of viral infection and neuronal injury during JEV infection is an essential step for developing strategies for limiting the severity of CNS disease.",
