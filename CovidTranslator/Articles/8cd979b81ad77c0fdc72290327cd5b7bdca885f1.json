FAN1 maintains genomic stability and prevents tissue decline in multiple organs, yet it confers ICL-induced anti-cancer drug resistance in several cancer subtypes. Here we report three crystal structures of human FAN1 in complex with a 5 0 flap DNA substrate, showing that two FAN1 molecules form a head-totail dimer to locate the lesion, orient the DNA and unwind a 5 0 flap for subsequent incision. Biochemical experiments further validate our model for FAN1 action, as structure-informed mutations that disrupt protein dimerization, substrate orientation or flap unwinding impair the structure-specific nuclease activity. Our work elucidates essential aspects of FAN1-DNA lesion recognition and a unique mechanism of incision. These structural insights shed light on the cellular mechanisms underlying organ degeneration protection and cancer drug resistance mediated by FAN1.",

FAN1 is thought to be recruited to ICLs via its interaction with the monoubiquitinated form of the FANCI-FANCD2 complex, and, accordingly, disruption of the nuclease activity of FAN1 sensitizes cells to ICL inducing agents [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] . In ICL repair, FAN1 is thought to co-operate with other nucleases to introduce DNA incisions necessary for the efficient unhooking of the ICL 1-6 . Interestingly, FAN1 inactivation can lead to chronic kidney diseases 7 and autism/schizophrenia 8 , linking defective DNA lesion repair with ageing 9 and neurological disorders 8 . Besides its positive role in genome maintenance, FAN1 is also implicated in conferring chemo-resistance in several cancer subtypes 10, 11 , presenting itself as a promising drug target against chemotherapy resistance.",

Here we report three crystal structures of human FAN1 bound to 5 0 flap DNA and provide biochemical data to elucidate FAN1-DNA substrate interplay. We show that FAN1 forms an asymmetrical dimer to engage the DNA lesion, unwind the flap and incise the unwound DNA intermediate. These results illustrate a highly unusual mode of DNA substrate engagement by FAN1 and provide insights into the critical role of FAN1 in ICL repair and in the prevention of functional decline in different organs.

A stable fragment 5 of FAN1 containing residues 373 to 1,017 (FAN1 373-1,017 ) was used for structural studies, as it covers all the essential domains for DNA processing and preserves near wild-type nuclease activity 5 . For crystallization, a DNA substrate with a one-nucleotide (1-nt) 5 0 flap flanked by two duplex regions of 10 bp, designated as 5 0 -flap (10-1-10) , was mixed with FAN1 373-1,017 carrying an active-site mutation 2 D960A to prevent DNA cleavage. The duplex regions contained 1-nt (A or T) overhangs to facilitate crystallization (sequences in Supplementary Table 1 ). Three different crystal forms of FAN1 373-1,017 in complex with the 5 0 flap DNA were obtained and they diffracted to resolutions of 2.2 \u00c5 (space group P2 1 2 1 2 1 ), 3.8 \u00c5 (P3 1 ) and 4.2 \u00c5 (P3 1 ), respectively. The structures were solved by the single-wavelength anomalous diffraction (SAD) method using signals from iodide ions, which were included in the crystallization buffer for the P2 1 2 1 2 1 crystal form, and subsequently by the molecular replacement method for the P3 1 crystals ( Table 1 ). All three structures were refined to good statistics with excellent geometry (Table 1) . Unambiguous electron density in the three crystal forms clearly reveals three distinct DNA conformations in the cleft formed by two FAN1 molecules ( Fig. 1a -d and Supplementary Fig. 1 ).",

            "text": "The FAN1 373-1,017 molecule has three domains ( Fig. 1e) : a SAP containing domain as the primary DNA-binding domain, a TPR domain mediating inter-domain interaction and part of the dimerization interface and a VRR_NUC domain that harbours the catalytic site. The SAP domain consists of a canonical SAP fold and a SAP 0 region that connects to the TPR domain. The VRR_NUC domain has similar fold and active site residues as the Achaea Holliday Junction resolvase HJC 13 , with a Ca root-meansquare deviation (RMSD) of 2.2 \u00c5 (Fig. 1f,g) . This indicates a similar mechanism of metal-mediated catalysis, even though no metal ion is present here due to the mutation of the metal-coordinating residue D960A. A comparison with the HJC structure suggests that the DNA substrate is oriented at the active site by residues K977/ H832 (K48/R25 in HJC) for hydrolysis mediated by residues E815/ E834/D960/E975 (E9/S29/D33/E46 in HJC) (Fig. 1g) . Consistent with the published data 2,3,5,6,14,15 , wild-type FAN1 373-1,017 exhibits strong endonuclease activity on 5 0 flap DNA substrates, generating two endonuclease products at the fourth nt into the duplex region 3 0 to the branch site and at the seventh nt into the single-strand (ss) region 5 0 to the branch site ( Supplementary Fig. 2 ). It also exhibits exonuclease activity on 5 0 flap, 3 0 flap and double-stranded (ds) DNA substrates ( Supplementary Fig. 2 (Fig. 1a-c) . FAN1 dimer-DNA interactions are observed in all three crystals, each with a distinct DNA-binding form (Fig. 1a-c) . These include (i) a 'substrate-scanning form' (P2 1 2 1 2 1 crystal) wherein the DNA contacts one of the FAN1 molecules in the dimer (Fig. 1a) , (ii) a 'substrate-latching form' (P3 1 crystal 1) wherein the DNA becomes engaged with both FAN1 molecules (Fig. 1b) structurally similar, with the Ca RMSD of 0.8B1 \u00c5. Interestingly, an asymmetric arrangement of two MRE11 molecules has been observed in the structure of the MRE11-DNA complex 16 that functions in DNA double-strand break repair and signalling pathways, suggesting a similar strategy is employed for both enzymes to engage the DNA substrate and to prepare it for endonucleolytic incision. A conserved dimerization mode with some degree of variation is observed in the three FAN1-DNA structures, with the a 9 , a 7 and a 5 b 1 region of the A SAP domain lodging onto the surface inbetween P VRR_NUC and P TPR (Fig. 2a,b) . The helix a 9 seems to serve as a central core interaction module, while a 7 and a 5 b 1 adjust their positions and orientations to adapt to different dimer orientations (Fig. 2c-e) . These interactions are mostly electrostatic in nature, including extensive hydrogen bonds and salt bridges between the two FAN1 molecules. Notably, a more extensive interface is seen in the 'unwinding form' wherein the two FAN1 molecules associate more tightly to unwind the 5 0 flap DNA. We carried out mutagenesis to validate the observed dimer interface (Fig. 2f -h and Supplementary Figs 2e and 3 ). As predicted from the dimer structure, a triple mutation K525E/ R526E/K528E on the core a 9 interface greatly diminished DNAinduced dimerization as revealed by protein crosslinking using the chemical reagent BMH (bis(maleimido)hexane) (Fig. 2f) , sizeexclusion chromatography (SEC, Supplementary Fig. 3e ) and SEC-multi angle lase light scattering (SEC-MALLS, Fig. 2i ). As a consequence, the substrate-binding affinity to 5 0 flap DNA (Fig. 2g ) and endonuclease activity (Fig. 2h) was substantially reduced by this mutation. Surprisingly, the mutant exhibited similar dsDNA exonuclease activity as that of the wild-type enzyme ( Supplementary Fig. 4) , suggesting that DNA-induced dimerization endows FAN1 with 5 0 flap-structure specific endonuclease activity, while the exonuclease activity may not require dimerization. Interestingly, the mutation R982E on the PVRR NUC side of the interface had no effect on DNA-induced FAN1 dimerization (Fig. 2f ) and 5 0 flap DNA-binding capacity (Fig. 2g ), but showed a slightly different binding pattern with 5 0 flap DNA (Fig. 2g) . It almost completely ablated both endonuclease and exonuclease activities ( Fig. 2h and Supplementary Fig. 4 ). This indicates that R982E may perturb the dimerization conformation leading to catalytically unproductive DNA binding.",

The P SAP surface facing the catalytic site constitutes the major DNAbinding site that recognizes the sugar-phosphate backbone of the duplex region downstream of the 5 0 flap (denoted as P Duplex). This surface is the most positively charged and conserved region of FAN1 ( Fig. 3a and Supplementary Fig. 6a ). The binding is achieved through extensive electrostatic attraction and hydrogen bonding interactions (Fig. 3b ). This P SAP-DNA interaction locates the 5 0 flap site at the tip of the P SAP domain (Figs 1a-c and 3b). Interestingly, the DNA in the 'substrate-scanning' form is in a reversed orientation and consequently directs the 5 0 flap away from the VRR_NUC active site (Fig. 1a) . This suggests that DNA may bind in both orientations but only the correct one can lead to substrate latching and unwinding for subsequent incision. 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 1 0 1 1 1 2 1 3 1 4 1 5 1 6 1 7 1 8 1 9 2 3 2 4 2 ARTICLE To validate the role of the P Duplex-binding residues on FAN1, we created the following compound mutants: R420E/R424E/ K425E/K433E and K482E/N490E/Q492E/K493E/Q494E (the locations of the mutations are shown in Fig. 3a and Supplementary  Fig. 2e) . Importantly, both mutants showed significantly impaired binding to 5 0 flap DNA and abolished the endonuclease activity (Fig. 3e,f and Supplementary Figs 4 and 5) . As a control, a compound mutation, R636E/R640E/K642E, distant from the DNA binding and dimerization interfaces had no effect on DNA-binding capacity or nuclease activity (Fig. 3a,e,f) . Besides the electrostatic interactions, residues Y374 and Y436 also form two hydrogen bonds with the phosphate backbone of DNA. To validate their functional relevance, we further tested the Y374F/Y436F mutation and the results showed that it retained WT-like 5 0 flap DNAbinding affinity but was substantially impaired in endonuclease activity (Fig. 3e, f) . This indicates that the two residues (Y374 and Y436) may contribute to appropriate substrate orientation through hydrogen-bonding interactions.",

The observed 'unwinding-form' likely represents a state with partially unwound DNA substrate, as the ssDNA region does not reach the active site for hydrolysis. Further unwinding towards the active site is needed to enable the incision at the previously reported incision point 4 nt downstream of the flap 3 . In the current crystal form, the side chains of A N452 from a 3 and A S460 from a 5 b 1 and the backbone carbonyl of P P979 provide three hydrogen bonds to the backbone of the ssDNA, while P L811 forms stacking interaction with a ribose ring. The compound mutation N452D/S460D/ L811D led to substantially impaired nuclease activity (Fig. 3f) while preserving near-wild type binding affinity to 5 0 flap DNA (Fig. 3e) . This is consistent with the important role of these residues in guiding the ssDNA region to the active site in P VRR_NUC. The energy needed to unwind the duplex region may be generated by the extra interface of both the A FAN1-DNA interaction and the FAN1 dimerization (additional area of 1,200 \u00c5 2 ) as a result of the change from the 'latching form' to the 'unwinding form'.",

To determine how many base pairs must be unwound to allow FAN1 cleavage, the ICL was moved 2, 6, 12 or 16 base pairs away from the flap branch point. Strong inhibition of endonucleolytic incision was observed until the ICL was 6-12 base pairs or further away from the flap site (Fig. 4b) , which is consistent with the flap unwinding observed in our 'substrateunwinding' structure.

SLX1, another 5 0 flap endonuclease, and FAN1 are thought to play overlapping roles in 5 0 flap processing during ICL repair 4, 18, 19 . However, while SLX1 cuts the ssDNA flap at the branch point 20 , FAN1 can create incisions both on the ssDNA flap and within the duplex region downstream (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Fig. 2) 3, 12 . This could be explained by the unwinding of duplex DNA followed by incision of the unwound ssDNA (Fig. 4a) , as suggested by our structural and biochemical data. FAN1 would mediate DNA incision further away from the ICL (Fig. 4c) . The involvement of FAN1 and SLX1 in ICL repair would expand the repair spectrum and properly incise various DNA structures or at different steps of ICL repair. SLX1 has been proposed to play a prominent role in ICL unhooking 18 , while FAN1 may be more involved in the homologous recombination reaction during ICL repair 1, 18, 21 .",

            "text": "The active site and the P Duplex interfaces of FAN1 are evolutionarily conserved from bacteria to humans, while the protein dimerization, DNA flap binding and A Duplex interfaces appear to be unique to higher eukaryotic species ( Supplementary  Figs 6 and 7) . In particular, the core a 9 helix (bearing residues K525, R526 and K528), essential for dimerization and nuclease activity in human FAN1, is substantially shorter or absent in lower species (Supplementary Figs 6b,c and 7) . This suggests that bacterial FAN1 orthologues may use a different mechanism for DNA binding without protein dimerization. This difference may be due to the fact that eukaryotic FAN1 has evolved to work with other cellular factors, as it is recruited to ICL sites via the monoubiquitinated FANCI/D2 complex 1-6 . Moreover, the FANCI/D2 complex has been shown to interact with branched DNA mainly on the exposed positively charged surface of the protein complex 22 . Our structures reveal that human FAN1 also engages DNA in a relatively open conformation that would allow access by other binding partners. This lends support to the potential simultaneous and collaborative binding of FAN1 and FANCI/D2 to a stalled replication fork during its repair, as proposed previously [2] [3] [4] . The FANCI/D2-dependent ICL repair pathway is absent in bacteria, and different catalytic properties for bacterial and human FAN1 have indeed been reported recently 12 . FAN1 mutations 7, 8 have been implicated in ageing and developmental disorders including chronic kidney disease 7 and mental ailments 8 . In this regard, FAN1 could help ensure organ health by minimizing the harmful effects of genotoxins to which the kidney is exposed and of potential ICL inducers in embryonic neural tissues during the period of rapid genome replication 23 . The elucidation of the human FAN1-DNA structure allows us to assess the existing disease-associated FAN1 variants 7,8 via structural mapping (Fig. 4d) 5) ) interfaces likely perturb the dimer structure and impair the DNA-binding activity of FAN1. FAN1 expression has been found to correlate with treatment outcome in breast and ovarian cancers, with increased FAN1 expression leading to a poorer prognosis 11 . In contrast, suppressed FAN1 recruitment to DNA lesions may account for the enhanced response to ICL-inducing chemotherapy drugs in lung cancer 10 .",

Labelled oligonucleotides were annealed with the complementary partner (2 mM each, Supplementary Table 2) in annealing buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 2.5 mM MgCl 2 ) to generate splayed arm structures. A total of 412.5 mM 4 0 -Hydroxymethyl-4, 5 0 , 8trimethylpsoralen (Berry and Associates, Dexter, MI) was added to the annealed oligonucleotides, incubated at room temperature for 1 h, and the mixture was then exposed to UVA light (1.12 J cm \u00c0 2 ) for 15 min to crosslink the complementary strands at the unique TpA site in each substrate. The DNA preparation was resolved in an 8% denaturing gel, whereupon the crosslinked species was excised, electroeluted and concentrated (Amicon Ultra 10,000 MWCO filtration device). The crosslinked species were then annealed with the third strand (X40, Supplementary Table 1) in annealing buffer. In parallel, a substrate without any crosslink was generated by annealing oligonucleotides X0F, X0R and X40.",
