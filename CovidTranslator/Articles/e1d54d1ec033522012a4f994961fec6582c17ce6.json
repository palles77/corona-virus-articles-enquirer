The oropharynx is everything from the caudal edge of the hard palate to the epiglottis. Because the soft palate and fauces are parts of the oropharynx, inflammation of these structures is often lumped under the term pharyngitis. When specific regions of the pharynx, however, such as the fauces, are involved, it is preferable to use the more specific term, e.g., faucitis.",

In response to inflammation, the gingival crevice becomes fluid filled. Crevicular fluid is diffused largely from the blood and contains immunoglobulins as well as microphagocytic and macrophagocytic cells. Antibodies within the crevicular fluid are derived both from the serum and from local plasma cells and lymphocytes.

Likewise, phagocytes are beneficial when they ingest and destroy microorganisms but may be harmful when they harbor pathogenic microbes, spread pathogens from one area to the other, or nonspecifically damage surrounding normal tissues with their cytokines. Lymphocyte-mediated immunity plays an important role in destroying cells harboring pathogenic microbes but can also cause \"autoimmune\" damage to normal fibroblasts and other inappropriate damage. 13 \u2022 52 \u2022 54 Oral immunity is most effective in keeping the normal oral flora in balance and in rapidly eliminating acute infections when they occur. In the case of chronic disease processes, however, oral immunity is apt to be either indifferent to the process or harmful. This is understandable because chronicity is evidence in itself that the infectious process has defied all initial immunologic attempts to contain it. The ineffectiveness or harmful effect of oral immunity in chronic oral infections would also explain why local cellular infiltrates and antibody production increase in direct proportion to the severity and chronicity of local disease activity. 31 Ebersole et alu listed three possible scenarios for the sequence of events in oral infection and immunity in relation to disease activity: (1) infection~ disease activity~ local and systemic immunity; (2) infection~ local immune respons~ disease activity~ systemic immune response; and (3) infection~ local and systemic immune respons~ disease activity. Evidence indicates that the second scenario is most common; disease activity follows a failure of local immunity, and systemic immunity is evoked only after an infectious process becomes well established. This disease activity scenario is best demonstrated by gingivitis and periodontitis. Although a weakness in local immunity allows gingivitis to occur, the systemic immunity that is evoked will usually contain the infection to the gingiva. Periodontitis requires a weakening of both local and systemic defenses.",

Is there any evolutionary significance to the fact that infections often start in the oral tissues? It can be argued that if an infection is going to occur, it is preferable to put that infection in contact with the immune system at the earliest possible time.

Most chronic oral cavity infections in animals or people have a congenital predisposition, but the nature of the defect(s) is not readily apparent at this time. Why are certain groups of humans or animals more susceptible to chronic gingivitis and periodontitis than others? Why do certain individuals develop more dental calculus on the same diets than others? Why do many humans and animals maintain normal periodontal health without any special precautions? Why do some have oral disease that can be managed with faithful prophylaxis, and why do a few individuals have progressive periodontal disease that defies prevention? The congenital nature of such susceptibility is even more obvious in veterinary medicine because of the routine practice of inbreeding animals. There is no question that certain breeds of dogs and cats suffer much more from oral disease than others. It is also obvious from both human and veterinary experiences that the genetic defects underlying these common forms of gingival and periodontal disease are complex and frequently interplay with a number of different environmental and dietary factors. The fact that we do not understand all of the subtle abnormalities that can lead to a loss of resistance and periodontal disease should not be disheartening. Every year new discoveries are made. For instance, the discovery of abnormal phagocytic functions of polymorphonuclear neutrophils has only recently offered an explanation for a large proportion of the cases of juvenile periodontitis in humans. 29 Acquired immunodeficiency is of either infectious or' noninfectious etiology. Certain diseases, such as feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) infection of domestic cats, lead to a slow progressive decline in immune functions. 64 Once these immune functions are diminished to a critical point, secondary infections appear. Given the primary position of the oral cavity in host defenses, it is understandable why many of those secondary infections first appear in the oral cavity.",

For example, lymphocytic/plasmacytic stomatitis is often referred to in feline medicine as a specific disease entity. Infiltrates composed largely of polymorphonuclear neutrophils are more apt to be associated with acute lesions, whereas the addition of increasing numbers and proportions of lymphocytes and plasma cells indicates chronicity. The presence of eosinophils is suggestive of either parasitic or allergic (type 1 hypersensitivity) reactions. Because secondary microbial infection is so common in mouth lesions, most oral inflammatory lesions are of a mixed nature, i.e., containing elements of active and chronic inflammation. Suppurative inflammation will have a predominance of neutrophils, whereas chronic inflammation will have a predominance of macrophages, lymphocytes, and plasma cells. Pyogranulomatous inflammation, which is frequently seen in chronic oral infections in cats, is a mixture of the two. The nature of the cellular infiltrate also varies with the depth of the lesion. Breeches of the oral membranes by any disease process offer an avenue for microorganisms to invade superficially into the underlying submucosa. These may lead to a more suppurative process (neutrocytophilic/ monocytic) near the surface and more immunogenic (lymphocytic/plasmacytic) response deeper. This means that oral biopsy specimens should be large and deep enough to sample the entire disease process.",

For instance, any condition that breeches the oral defense mechanisms may allow normal oral flora to invade the deeper tissues and to elicit inflammation. The ultimate cause of the inflammation, however, is the breech of oral defenses and not the microbes. To complicate matters, the lesion may actually result from the host's attempt to contain immunologically or eliminate foci of microbial persistence, e.g., chronic diffuse ulceroproliferative faucitis associated with chronic oral carriage of feline calicivirus. A biopsy of the latter lesion would demonstrate a severe and diffuse plasmacytic/lymphocytic infiltrate in deeper tissues and a more ulcerative and suppurative process superficially.

Dermatitis, oral ulcers, and hematologic abnormalities (anemia, thrombocytopenia) are seen in a smaller portion of animals. Many cats with SLE will have a low-grade proteinuria and slowly progressive renal failure owing to an immune complex type of glomerulonephritis. The oral ulcers are probably a complication of the systemic vasculitis that so often accompanies SLE in humans and animals. This vasculitis is associated with deposition of immune complex in the basement membranes of small blood vessels.",

Phenolic compounds are the most toxic, although virtually any substance licked into the mouth can cause mouth lesions if groomed into the mouth at high enough concentration or if ingested by the wrong individual. Lesions are most common on the margin of the tip of the tongue (Color Plate 3, Figure 15 ). If enough toxin is ingested, lesions may also be seen on the palate (Color Plate 3, Figure  15 ). High toxin concentrations will also lead to lesions in the oropharynx and even the esophagus. Cats with oropharyngeal/esophageal involvement are often quite ill and may die. The most common clinical sign is dysphagia and hypersalivation occurring within 1 to 2 days or so of exposure. Examination of the mouth at the early stages may demonstrate discoloration, devitalization, and sloughing of affected tissues (Color Plate 3, Figure 15 ). Ulceration develops rapidly, however, and may be the predominant feature. Most cats will continue to eat, especially if fed soft food. Secondary bacterial infection is uncommon, and the lesions are usually well on their way to healing within 5 to 7 days. The main differential diagnosis for toxic oral ulcers is nosocomial feline calicivirus (FCV) infection (see following). Cats are often exposed to calicivirus by vaccination with a live-virus vaccine just before entering the hospital, by direct contact with contaminated oral specula and endotracheal tubes, or by being put into contact with the oral secretions of carrier cats. About 20% of randomly tested cats are calicivirus oral shedders, so the odds of handling an infected animal are high. The virus is shed in both saliva and feces and will live for a few days off of a cat. Therefore contamination of caging by a previous resident cat or the use of improperly cleaned and disinfected litter/food/water pans can transmit the virus. Gloved and ungloved hands can also readily transmit the virus from one eat's mouth to another, especially if hands are not washed or gloves changed between patients. The fact that routine surgical procedures are often done on a group of cats during the same period of time and by the same people also adds to the problem. Oral lesions usually appear within 3 to 5 days of exposure.",

Although there is no doubt that acute FCV infection can cause acute focal to multifocal ulcerative glossitis and palatitis, experimental FCV infection has never been associated with chronic oral lesions like those described from the field. 23 The author and colleagues also recently completed a serosurvey among cattery and household pet cats that tried to link oral carriage of FeL V, FIV, and FCV to chronic inflammatory oral cavity disease. 61 The most common oral cavity lesion observed among cats in this study was a mild to moderately severe gingivitis (affecting about 40% of the cats). This common lesion did not appear to be statistically linked to any of these three virus infections. In contrast, cats with severe oral cavity disease, usually periodontitis with involvement of other tissues (fauces, palate, cheeks, tongue), appeared to have a higher incidence of FIV or FCV/FIV infections than could be accounted for by coincidence or chance. This led to the conclusion that FIV was an important underlying factor in a proportion of cats with more severe oral cavity infections and that FCV may be involved in severe oral cavity inflammations if it occurred with immunosuppressive viruses like FIV. The latter conclusion was supported by studies of Knowles et aJ.2 4 After closely examining a large number of cats with chronic oral inflammatory lesions, one particular lesion stood out, a moderate to severe chronic ulceroproliferative lesion of the oral fauces (see Color Plate 4, Figure 20 ). 49 This lesion was similar to a peculiar chronic stomatitis or gingivitis and pharyngitis that has been previously reported. 2 \u00b7 20 \u2022 63 This chronic ulceroproliferative faucitis occurred in a small proportion of younger to middle-aged cats and persisted for life in spite of all attempts to treat it symptomatically. With time, the proliferative lesion in the fauces often spread rostrally along the teeth, leading to severe gingivitis, periodontitis, and tooth loss.",

Coupling experimental and clinical studies, it can be postulated that (1) FCVinduced feline ulceroproliferative faucitis exists in acute and chronic forms, (2) chronic ulceroproliferative faucitis develops in a small proportion of cats that had acute faucitis and appears to be associated with FCV persistence, (3) chronic faucitis lesions may result from an atypical and persistent immune response on the part of a small proportion of cats toward virus-infected cells in the oral fauces; and (4) the atypical immune response may be enhanced by underlying FIV or FeL V immunodeficiency in a small proportion (10% to 15%) of affected cats. 49 Chronic uleeroproliferative faucitis, with or without periodontitis, has not been successfully treated. Antibiotic treatment, sometimes coupled with local antiseptics, will lessen pain and swelling, indicating that secondary bacterial infection is occurring. Corticosteroids will also alleviate pain and swelling. About one fifth of affected cats will respond somewhat to gold salt therapy. Surgical curettage of severely proliferative faucial tissues is sometimes indicated, as is removal of badly diseased molars. Therapy is usually palliative, however, and most cats are eventually euthanatized. Only rarely will the disease spontaneously go into remission.",

Anaerobic bacteria from the genuses Bacteroides, Fusobacterium, Peptostreptococcus, Propionibacterium, and Clostridium and aerobic bacteria such as Pasteurella multocida, Corynebacterium pyogenes, Actinomyces species, Streptococcus species, Lactobacillus, and Escherichia coli are generally isolated on culture. 26 \u2022 40 A number of unculturable spirochetes and borrelia can also be observed in normal and abnormal mouths.

The pathogenesis of periodontitis in humans was first reported by Page and Schroeder. 34 More recent concepts of the disease have been presented by Newman. 30 The initial lesion is at the marginal gingiva. Tissue inflammation evoked by local bacterial proliferation, usually in the form of subgingival plaques, leads to slow destruction of the ligamentous attachments of the epithelium to the teeth and atrophy of adjacent alveolar bone, thus creating a gingival sulcus. This sulcus traps food and inflammatory exudate and is slowly enlarged by downward extension along the periodontal ligament. Antigenic stimulation leads to increasing accumulations of plasma cells and lymphocytes in adjacent mucosal tissues. With increasing depth of the gingival sulcus, more and more alveolar bone and periodontal ligament is destroyed. This causes the tooth to become less securely anchored and increases its mobility when wiggled. Increased mobility leads to an acceleration of the disease process. Eventually the tooth is lost from lack of support. In some cases, the infection rapidly reaches the tooth root and causes a root abscess.",

Periodontitis has been implicated as the cause of 20% of tooth loss in humans.\u2022 Periodontal disease of cats is difficult to treat; a temporary response is usually seen to careful cleaning and antibiotic treatment. Without eliminating gingival pockets and badly affected teeth, however, and correcting any defects in local or systemic immune defects, symptomatic therapy is doomed to failure. The most common treatment therefore is to radiograph and remove those teeth that have extensive atrophy of the alveolus or tooth root infections, regardless of how solid they appear. Care must be taken to remove all remnq.nts of tooth root and surrounding infected bone. Tooth root retention and bone cyst formation are somewhat unique sequelae of feline periodontitis. 48 Good dental hygiene, which normally includes teeth brushing and the use of oral antiseptics, may delay recurrence, but such procedures are not easily sustained by cat owners.",

The possibility, however, that the cervical periodontitis is secondary to defects in the root cementum, such as described for juvenile periodontitis of humans, 33 should not be discounted. The author has observed several young cats with generalized enamel hypoplasia and severe periodontitis surrounding and overgrowing most of the teeth.",

The owners may not notice them until they are large enough to peer out from under the tongue when the mouth is opened. Treatment usually involves surgical excision. The foreign material may be visualized grossly or may be apparent only on histologic examination. Therefore all excised tissue should be submitted for microscopic studies.

They appear histologically as a hypersensitivity type response involving an eosinophilic cell infiltrate that is centered around focal areas of collagen necrosis. Disease activity is often cyclical in nature; flareups and remissions of lesions occur without seeming reason. Lesions are of an ulcerative (usually the upper lip), linear (usually the skin over the back limbs or pads), or plaque-like nature. Two types of lesions occur in the mouth, a mild to severe ulcerative cheilitis (Color Plate 4, Figure 24 ) and a proliferative (nodular), ulceroproliferative, or plaque-like lesion involving virtually any structure within the oral cavity but in particular the hard palate. 12 Proliferative or ulceroproliferative eosinophilic granulomas in the mouth may be mistaken for cancers, foreign body granulomas, or infectious granulomas. The diagnosis is easily made from a deep biopsy of the lesion, which will show the characteristic pathology of histiocytic proliferation, eosinophilic infiltrate and collagen necrosis. Eosinophilic granulomas are best treated with systemic long-acting corticosteroids. Large oral lesions may have to be resected along with drug therapy.",

This frustration is due to both the high frequency of feline oral inflammatory lesions and our poor understanding of their causes. This poor understanding can be blamed on several things: (1) a rapidly emerging, but still relatively poor, understanding of feline diseases in general and nutrition in particular; (2) a tendency to lump rather than separate specific oral inflammations; (3) a tendency not to use a thorough and systematic approach to diagnosing oral cavity disease; and (4) the reluctance of veterinarians to apply what is already known about human oral cavity diseases to cats. When problems 2 through 4 are adequately addressed, it becomes apparent that we really know more about oral cavity disease in the cat than we thought we knew and that great progress has been made. The task ahead is to define, in precise medical terms, those remaining disease entities of the oral cavity that pose the greatest health risk to cats, to apply what has been already been discovered from human disease counterparts, and to study them systematically.",
