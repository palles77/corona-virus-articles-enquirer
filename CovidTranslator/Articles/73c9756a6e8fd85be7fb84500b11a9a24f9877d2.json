The U.S. military had suffered severely from malaria during World War I, and although the reported incidence had dropped during the 1930s, a cyclical 5-to 7-year pattern of disease raised concern. Because the disease had been endemic in the southern United States, concern was heightened because 600 military bases and more than 1000 essential war establishment facilities were located there. MCWA was the actualization of the vision of Joseph W. Mountin, MD (1891 -1952 , an assistant surgeon general in the PHS and director of the Bureau of State Services, who reported to the surgeon general of the PHS. The headquarters was located in Atlanta, Georgia, with close associations with 15 state health departments, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands, as well as laboratory facilities and field stations in multiple states that worked with all the affected states and territories.",

            "text": "Although the PHS provided leadership for the new program, much of the expertise in malaria had been recruited by the military; therefore, substantial training became an essential component of the multifaceted approach taken by MCWA. Physicians assessed clinical malaria and parasitologists managed the laboratories; however, mosquito control was the emphasis, and engineers and entomologists dominated MCWA. Field staff from the recently terminated Works Progress Administration were recruited to continue their work of draining malaria breeding grounds and larviciding with diesel oil and insecticides (beginning with Paris Green but adding DDT in 1943, which substantially changed the approach to malaria control). State laboratory staff were trained to diagnose malaria by using the most effective techniques. The program's scope expanded to the civilian population and to other vector-borne diseases such as dengue and typhus. MWCA laboratory workers also responded to requests from states for assistance in epidemic investigations, a role previously left to the National Institute for Health (NIH) (now the National Institutes of Health). The MCWA program was regarded as highly successful, and even before the end of the war, Mountin and his staff were considering the future. With the support of Surgeon General Thomas Parran, Jr (Surgeon General, 1936-48) , the Communicable Disease Center was established on 1 July 1946. At the time, CDC had 400 employees and a budget of $1.2 million ( Table 1) .",

This role was solidified in 1950 when the Association of State Health Officials and the American Public Health Association agreed that CDC take the lead in defining what diseases were of highest priority and should be reportable. The key figure in this expansion of the CDC role was Alexander D. Langmuir, MD (1910-93) , who was brought to the CDC in 1949 as Chief of the Epidemiology Division. Langmuir brought experience as a member of the Armed Forces Epidemiology Board, as a practicing epidemiologist at both the local and state health departments in New York, and as a professor teaching at the Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene and Public Health. He also brought vision and a strong personality that helped bring the role of the epidemiologist to prominence at the CDC and in public health practice throughout the country.",

Influential events and decisions in the 1950s, however, truly established the CDC as an agency with national recognition, and Mountin and Langmuir were forces behind the majority of these changes. In 1950, the Cold War set the tone in international affairs, and the Korean Conflict fueled a concern about the pointed use of biologic weapons there and in the United States. Langmuir successfully championed the concept of the Epidemic Intelligence Service (EIS), which would respond to disease outbreaks as part of a program of biologic warfare defense. The EIS program was established in 1951 with the recruitment of 23 men, including 22 physicians and a sanitary engineer. This first class became the disease detectives, the symbol of applied epidemiology practiced at the CDC and the core of epidemiologists who would come to lead the agency in future years. By 2006, more than 2700 men and women had graduated from the program, all with different backgrounds and experiences. Together they have conducted more than 10 000 investigations, not only in infectious disease but also in chronic diseases, injury, and the many other health areas that the CDC has engaged in during subsequent years ( Table 2) . EIS alumni have become public health leaders at the CDC, throughout the United States, and around the world.",

In 1954, the University of Michigan conducted a national randomized trial of the killed virus vaccine developed by Jonas Salk on more than 200 000 U.S. school children during a year when more than 38 000 cases had been reported. The positive results were announced on 12 April 1955, the tenth anniversary of the death of Franklin Delano Roosevelt, y Deceased. and the response was dramatic.

Four days later, Langmuir was directed to establish the national polio surveillance unit he had been advocating, and he immediately directed the EIS officers to focus their efforts on this national emergency. Within less than a week, daily reports were produced by the epidemiologists in the unit. Rapid investigation in the field and in the laboratory clearly implicated one of the five vaccine manufacturers as the source of the epidemic (although a second manufacturer might have had problems as well). Weeks later Surgeon General Scheele was able to announce that the problem had been identified, safety standards had been instituted, and the vaccine was now safe to distribute. The CDC's role had been critical, and the importance of public health surveillance and of the EIS was recognized. National surveillance for Asian influenza in 1957-58, together with the work of CDC epidemiologists and laboratory staff, cemented the national role of the agency in disease control.

The CDC increasingly was recognized for its responsiveness to epidemics of infectious diseases, including drug resistance among hospitalized patients, Salmonella in commercially produced chicken, polio associated with oral vaccine, and for its international work in smallpox eradication and disaster assistance.

This political will, together with improved technology (e.g., the jet injector gun to deliver vaccine), was the impetus for an extraordinary global program. Donald A. Henderson, MD (EIS 1955) , was transferred to WHO to help lead the international effort. A global mass-vaccination strategy was undertaken, and active surveillance documented rapid decreases in illness and death. However, the program began to founder and eradication appeared out of reach. William H. Foege, MD, another EIS alumnus (1962) , demonstrated in West Africa that an active surveillance and containment strategy was an effective complement to the mass-vaccination strategy. In 1979, these efforts resulted in the first successful eradication of a human disease in history, 2 years after the last case of wild-strain smallpox in Somalia.",

In spring 1976, an outbreak of influenza at a military base in New Jersey was identified as being caused by a new strain of influenza A, a strain that was quite different than the strain (A/Hong Kong/H3N2) circulating since 1968. The new strain (H sw 1N1) had demonstrated pathogenicity among humans and its ability to be transmitted person to person, circumstances that were believed to always lead to pandemics. As important, this strain was believed to be closely related to the influenza virus that had led to a pandemic in 1918-19, which had killed 500 000 U.S. residents and an estimated 25 million persons globally, affecting particularly young adults. With the CDC in the lead, scientific experts were engaged during the following months to study the problem. They ultimately recommended the policy that led to the National Influenza Immunization Program, which targeted the entire U.S. population. Vigorous efforts by the president, Congress, the vaccine manufacturers, and the public health system enabled the program to begin in October 1976. Within weeks, the CDC's national surveillance program, in collaboration with the states, uncovered an increased reporting of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome among persons who had been vaccinated during the program. Subsequently, the program was suspended and no epidemic occurred. An association was confirmed in a national case-control study conducted by the agency; the agency was criticized harshly, and other vaccination programs were called into question.",

The Legionnaires' disease epidemic eventually brought 25 EIS officers and many other staff to Pennsylvania and stayed on the front pages for weeks during this bicentennial year. By the end of August, the field team had identified more than 200 caseslaboratory staff had ruled out all known human pathogensand together they had investigated multiple leads in an effort to determine a toxin. Terrorism was considered, and external experts were called in. However, the strongest association identified was with the hotel that had housed the conventioneers and had hosted major business and social activities. The team returned to Atlanta without a definitive answer, and in the context of the mounting criticism around the swine influenza program, continued its work. Finally, in December, Joseph E. McDade, PhD (1940-) , in the CDC's Rickettsial Diseases Laboratory, identified the Gram-negative rod that proved to be the bacterium that caused the epidemic. Legionella pneumophila became the first new human bacterial pathogen identified in decades, and McDade and his coworkers linked it to two previously unsolved epidemics in 1965 and 1968.",

In the summer of 1980, a report from Arizona in the MMWR linked Reye's syndrome with using aspirin. That report was followed by similar data from Ohio and Michigan, which led the CDC to conclude that the association might be real. The aspirin industry aggressively attacked, but the CDC held firm and recommended that aspirin be avoided for children with chickenpox and during influenza epidemics. Surgeon General Julius B. Richmond (1977-81) soon followed with a similar recommendation. The struggle with industry did not stop, but national data demonstrated a noticeable decrease in Reye's syndrome during the next few years. Meanwhile, the CDC was responding rapidly to the national epidemic of toxic shock syndrome among women. Within 6 months, the disease was linked to use of tampons and by the end of 1980, specifically to the use of the Rely tampon, made by Proctor and Gamble. After the manufacturer voluntarily withdrew the product, the epidemic abated dramatically.",

The chemical release in Bhopal, India, and the investigation of toxic oil syndrome in Spain reflected the international recognition of the CDC in environmental health. In 1982, the agency announced a reorganization to reflect these new public health concerns and environmental health, chronic diseases, occupational health, unintentional injuries, violence, and maternal and child health, while maintaining excellence in the prevention of infectious diseases. This reorganization enabled the programmatic growth for the next two decades.",

The pandemic of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) caused by HIV crept slowly into public consciousness, but by the end of the decade, no health problem in the world generated more interest and controversy. The CDC was at the center of both. During those years, more than a third of the agency's budget was directed toward researching this illness and the virus that causes it. The agency's budget grew to approximately $1 billion by the end of the decade. Its constituency grew with the budget, and both domestic and global partnerships expanded considerably. At the CDC, behavioral and social scientists rapidly developed an important niche, and the move of the National Center for Health Statistics in 1987 to what was now the Centers for Disease Control brought a wealth of data and enhanced the role of the statistician at the CDC and in public health practice.",

In 1993, the CDC's name changed to reflect its broadened mission, and it became the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. By 2000, the CDC budget had exceeded $3 billion. The chronic disease budget was $660 million that year and was dedicated primarily to development of programs for preventing breast and cervical cancer. In addition, routine data collection was being established at the state level through the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, and state-based cancer registries were implemented to provide a data baseline for defining problems and evaluating program effectiveness. Emerging infections (e.g., Escherichia coli O157:H7, the hantavirus, and West Nile virus) and reemerging infections (e.g., antibiotic and drug resistance for bacteria, tuberculosis, and malaria), together with an increasing number of effective vaccines, underscored the continuing importance of infectious diseases. By the end of the century, 10 major programs (then termed centers, institute, and offices) were located at the CDC, the last focusing on unintentional injuries and violence. An 11th center was created a year later. Global health programs related to HIV and other worldwide public health concerns continued to grow. By 2000, a global network of more than 30 Field Epidemiology Training Programs modeled on the EIS was established. On any give day, the CDC had more than 200 persons stationed internationally on long-term assignments. Nationally and globally, the science and services of the CDC were in great demand. The MMWR was available on the Internet and in 2006 received 1.2 million hits.",

The first of these threats came in 2001, with the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon followed by anthrax attacks. In response to these events, CDC received substantial increases in funding to enhance preparedness and response capabilities within the Agency and at state and local health departments. Both the Strategic National Stockpile (SNS) of vaccines, medications, and medical supplies as well as the Laboratory Response Network were expanded to improve responses to public health emergencies. This enhanced public health capacity proved critical to national responses to infectious disease outbreaks. In 2003 alone, these included the emergence of a novel coronavirus that sparked the SARS pandemic, the introduction of monkeypox associated with the exotic pet trade, and a resurgence of West Nile virus as it moved westward across the United States. These investments were also important in CDC's responses to environmental disasters including Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005, and the Haitian earthquake and Gulf of Mexico (Deepwater Horizon) oil spill, both in 2010.",

The novel virus causing this pandemic, apparently of swine origin, first appeared in humans in Mexico and quickly spread to the United States and around the globe. CDC's response included developing new diagnostic assays and providing diagnostic test kits to both domestic and international laboratories, increasing influenza surveillance activities, developing candidate viruses for vaccine production, and assisting with vaccine distribution across the U.S. In addition, CDC distributed antiviral drugs and personal protective equipment from the SNS. These efforts resulted in prevention of an estimated 700 000 to 1.5 million cases, 12 000 to 23 000 hospitalizations, and 600 to 1200 deaths in the United States.",

In 2011, President Barack Obama advanced the vision of an AIDS-free generation and set PEPFAR goals to treat 6 million patients and provide treatment to more than 1.5 million pregnant women to prevent mother-to-child HIV transmission by the end of 2013. In support of PEPFAR and to meet other international goals, including polio eradication, CDC had more than 300 internationally deployed staff working in approximately 60 countries in 2014, with over 1300 locally hired employees.",

Surveillance systems supported by CDC, including the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, and the National Health Interview Survey, measure the prevalence of these conditions and risk factors and track these data over time. The Million Hearts Initiative, led by CDC and including other federal partners, aims to prevent 1 million heart attacks and strokes between 2012 and 2017 through a combination of public health interventions (reduction of smoking and intake of trans fat and sodium) and clinical interventions (improved blood pressure control and hypertension management, increasing aspirin use for high-risk individuals).
