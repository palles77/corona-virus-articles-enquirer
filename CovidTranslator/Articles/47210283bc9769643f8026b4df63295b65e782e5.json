Unfortunately, such peptide mimicry of the short \u03b1-helical region in the CHR of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) spike protein has been thwarted by the loss of the peptide's native \u03b1-helical conformation when taken out of the parent protein structure. Here, we describe that appropriate all-hydrocarbon stapling of the short helical portion-based peptide to reinforce its bioactive secondary structure remarkably improves antiviral potency. The resultant stapled peptide P21S10 could effectively inhibit infection by MERS-CoV pseudovirus and its spike protein-mediated cell\u2212cell fusion; additionally, P21S10 exhibits improved pharmacokinetic properties than HR2P-M2, suggesting strong potential for development as an anti-MERS-CoV therapeutic.",

            "text": "Class I viral fusion proteins, such as those of the corona-, retro-, filo-, orthomyxo-, and paramyxoviruses, share similarities in their apparent use of a trimer of \u03b1-helical hairpins, or six-helix bundle (6-HB), to mediate membrane fusion processes of virus to target cell. 1, 2 In the 6-HB viral fusion apparatus, the Cterminal heptad repeat (CHR) segment of the trimeric virus glycoproteins zips up into three \u03b1-helices along the conserved hydrophobic grooves on the periphery of an internal threestranded coiled coil formed by the N-terminal heptad repeat (NHR) region of those fusion proteins. 3, 4 Despite the topologically similar conformation of the fusion-promoting hexameric helical scaffold, their \u03b1-helical portion of the CHR domain displays dramatic differences in length. For example, the fusion core structure of HIV, a Retroviridae family member, contains regular \u03b1-helical CHR domains involving approximately 10 helical turns that bind to the central trimeric NHR helices. 5, 6 In contrast, some other class I enveloped viruses, including Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) of the Coronaviridae family, encode a notable dimorphism in the length of its NHR and CHR helices. 7\u221210 In the MERS-CoV 6-HB assembly, the NHR trimers have \u223c21 helical turns, whereas the central CHR helices are limited to \u223c4.5 turns within the longer heptad-repeat sequence ( Figure  1A ). 11 Blocking \u03b1-helix-mediated NHR/CHR interactions using CHR-derived peptides that target the transiently exposed NHR coiled coil is a promising approach to inhibit membrane fusion and viral infection. 12, 13 With this strategy, a family of decoy \u03b1helices structurally mimicking the lengthy C-terminal helices of HIV was identified as low-nanomolar inhibitors of viral entry. 14, 15 It was disappointing that a synthetic peptide spanning the \u03b1-helical region of the MERS-CoV CHR domain sequence showed no anti-MERS-CoV activity. 11, 16 Although the typical \u03b1-helical region is an important recognition motif for MERS-CoV fusion core formation, this short CHR peptide alone does not retain its native conformation owing to the lack of structural reinforcement provided by the parent protein, which, in turn, retards its binding to partner NHR helices. 11 Peptide stapling based on different macrocyclization chemistry is a key technique for constraining short peptides in \u03b1-helical structures and thereby preorganizing them into their bound conformations to modulate helix-mediated protein\u2212protein interactions with reduced entropic penalty. 17, 18 Among numerous stapling chemistries, rutheniumcatalyzed RCM is one of the most noteworthy methods. 19, 20 This method of producing all-hydrocarbon-stapled \u03b1-helical peptides affords high levels of \u03b1-helix induction and nucleation, thus directly resulting in peptide target-binding proclivity, cell permeability, and serum stability. 21, 22 Furthermore, the therapeutic potential of stapled peptides has been showcased in a growing diversity of biological settings. Two hydrocarbonstapled peptides developed by Aileron Therapeutics have reached clinical trials, epitomizing the early indications regarding the clinical translational potential of these stabilized \u03b1-helical peptidomimetics. 23, 24 In the present study, we employed hydrocarbon stapling to recapitulate the topography of \u03b1-helical motifs found in the MERS-CoV CHR region to inhibit MERS-CoV infection and its spike (S) protein-mediated cell\u2212cell fusion. In the process of developing these stapled \u03b1-helical peptides, we performed a detailed study to identify the optimal stapling sites and the effect of hydrophobic amino acid incorporation to generate promising therapeutics.",

Seminal work investigating the stability of the coiled coil suggests that helices consisting of fewer than three heptads generally do not create enough opportunities for hydrophobic interactions in the core to favor superhelical assembly. 27, 28 On the basis of the X-ray crystallography and coiled-coil sequenceto-structure relationship study, we engineered a peptide containing the three integral heptads, designated as P21, spanning residues 1260\u22121280 of the MERS-CoV S protein CHR as a template for inhibitor design ( Figure 1C ). Analysis of the crystal structure of CHR in complex with NHR helices shows that six residues at the a and d positions (L1262, M1266, L1269, V1273, L1276, and Y1280) are buried in the 6-HB. In addition to the hydrophobic interactions contributed by their side chains, residues L1262, M1266, V1273, and Y1280 form four hydrogen bonds with NHR-helical trimer residues, including Q1023, N1016, Q1009, and K1000, via their mainchain amino or oxygen groups. Meanwhile, the hydroxyl group of the Y1280 side chain accepts a hydrogen bond from the NH group of Q1009 in NHR helices. 11, 16 Together with critical hydrophobic stacking forces, these hydrogen bonds constitute a polar contact network that further tightly ties CHR to NHR helix. We initially utilized the \"staple scanning\" approach along the length of the peptide helix, but away from the critical a\u2212d residues, to identify the optimal stapling sites. We substituted pairs of (S)-2-(4-pentenyl)alanine (abbreviated as S5 residues) at the i and i+4 positions because it is the most widely used unnatural amino acid for such type of staple. 21 Accumulated evidence that underline the structure and stability of coiledcoils has shown that the superhelix stability can generally be ",

First, peptides P21S1\u2212P21S10 were tested for their ability to inhibit MERS-CoV fusion with its target cell using our previously developed MERS-CoV S protein-mediated cell\u2212cell fusion assay. 11 As shown in Table 1 , the linear wild-type P21 exhibited no inhibition at a concentration of up to 50 \u03bcM but when the peptides were cyclized markedly improved inhibitory activity was demonstrated. Among these \u03b1-helical mimetics, P21S8 and P21S10 strongly inhibited S protein-mediated cell\u2212cell fusion, with EC 50 values of 0.26 and 0.33 \u03bcM, respectively, which are even more potent than the most active MERS-CoV fusion inhibitor so far, namely the 36-mer peptide HR2P-M2. 11 Importantly, their unmetathesized analogues, i.e., peptides containing un-cross-linked S5 residues had a dramatically decreased membrane fusion inhibitory potency (Table 1) . These results reveal the critical contribution of hydrocarbon stapling to replicate the local topography of MERS-CoV short C-terminal helices for therapeutic benefit. In addition, shifting the position of the all-hydrocarbon staple had a significant effect on anti-MERS-CoV activity. Peptides P21S2, P21S4, P21S5, and P21S9, with a 2/6, 5/9, 8/12, and 15/19 staple, respectively, exhibited only similar activity compared to their relevant unstapled peptides, whereas peptides P21S1, P21S3, P21S6, and P21S7 had no activity. Compared to P21S8 whose cross-link had the S,S-configuration, its R,R-configured counterpart, P21R8, provided 62-fold weaker anti-MERS-CoV activity, consistent with previous publications revealing the requirement of S-form building blocks for an i, i+4 staple type. 21 Finally, we explored whether the incorporation of hydrophobic mutations at the binding interface could lead to an improvement in biological activity. In our assay, replacing M1266 with Lnorleucine (i.e., Z), which led to P21S8Z, retained the high activity of P21S8 whereas Y1280F alone and the combination of M1266Z and Y1280F showed decreased potencies compared to that of P21S8, indicating the critical role of hydrogen bond formation between Y1280 and Q1009 of the S protein NHR trimer. Although buried hydrophobic residues may contribute more energy toward stabilization of a coiled-coil structure than polar interactions, 28, 32 subtle specific interacting networks are required for hydrocarbon-stapled peptides to stop the MERS-CoV\u2212cell fusion process efficiently.

Subsequently, we tested the potential inhibitory activities of the P21S8, P21S10, and P21S8Z peptides, which exhibited promising inhibitory potency in the cell\u2212cell fusion assay, on MERS-CoV pseudovirus infection in Huh-7 cells. As shown in Table 2 and Supporting Information, Figure S1 , P21S8, P21S10, and P21S8Z could significantly inhibit the MERS-CoV pseudovirus carrying the wild-type S protein, with EC 50 values of 3.03, 0.97, and 2.80 \u03bcM, respectively. Although P21S8 exhibited 2.8-fold greater potency than the positive control HR2P-M2 in inhibiting cell\u2212cell fusion, it was 2.8-fold less active than HR2P-M2 against wildtype MERS-CoV pseudovirus. Notably, P21S10 displayed potency similar to that of HR2P-M2 in both cell\u2212cell and virus\u2212cell fusion inhibition. These results suggest that, unlike P21S10, P21S8 does not have good correlation between its blockage of S protein-mediated membrane fusion and inhibition of wild-type MERS-CoV infection. One of the possible explanations for this discrepancy is that P21S8 may have lower target binding capability than P21S10 during the inhibition of virus infection. In addition, none of these viral fusion blockers displayed significant cytotoxicity to Huh-7 cells up to 100 \u03bcM (Table 2 and Supporting Information, Figure  S2 ). The selectivity index (SI = CC 50 /EC 50 ) of P21S10 was greater than 103. Among clinical MERS-CoV strains, S protein amino acid changes of Q1020H and Q1020R located in the NHR domain were under positive selection and present in nearly all variants. 33 Therefore, we next investigated whether P21S8, P21S10, and P21S8Z would be effective against MERS-CoV strains with the Q1020H and Q1020R mutations. Strikingly, these peptides were effective for inhibiting infection by MERS-CoV pseudoviruses with mutated S protein, with EC 50 values similar to those for inhibiting pseudovirus carrying the wild-type S protein (Table 2 and Supporting Information, Figure S1 ). P21S8 and P21S8Z displayed about 3-fold less potency than HR2P-M2 for inhibiting infection by pseudoviruses carrying S protein with Q1020H or Q1020R mutation; however, P21S10 possessed potency similar to that of HR2P-M2. Because MERS-CoV is primarily infecting the human respiratory tract, we further tested the inhibitory activities of these stapled peptides on MERS-CoV pseudovirus infection in a human lung-derived cell line Calu-3. Strikingly, P21S8, P21S10, and P21S8Z could inhibit MERS-CoV pseudovirus infection in Calu-3 cells with EC 50 values of 2.21, 1.58, and 2.57 \u03bcM, respectively, in an agreement with result observed in experiment using Huh-7 cells (Supporting Information, Table S1 and Figure S1 ). They also had no significant cytotoxicity to Calu-3 cells at the concentrations as high as 100 \u03bcM (Supporting Information, Figure S3 ). Moreover, we evaluated the aqueous solubility of these stapled peptides. P21S8 and P21S10 had aqueous solubilities of 6.47 and 10.5 mg/mL at pH 7.4, respectively, which were 14-fold and 22-fold higher than that of P21S8Z (Supporting Information, Table S2 ), suggesting their good potential for further development.",

CD spectroscopy provides a typical signature for \u03b1-helices with a maximum near 190 nm and double minima at 208 and 222 nm. CD spectra showed that P21 displayed a random coil conformation in phosphate buffer. Strikingly, with the exception of P21S2 that was too insoluble to make accurate measurements, the other hydrocarbon-stapled peptides exhibited \u03b1-helical structure with 15.6\u221254.5% helicity. Among them, the highly effective stapled peptides P21S8 and P21S10 were found to have greatly improved helical propensity, compared to the linear wild-type peptide, with helical contents of 53.7% and 46.5%, respectively ( Figure 2) . Furthermore, these stapled peptides were indeed more helical than their correponding uncyclized linear precursors (Supporting Information, Table S3\u2212S4). These data further confirmed the successful mimicry of the CHR helix via cyclization using the stapling strategy. Interestingly, although the CD spectra for peptides P21S8 and P21S10 were similar to those of P21S6 and P21S7, a difference in inhibitory potency of more than 193-fold was observed between them, suggesting that the much higher biological activity cannot be merely attributed to the helical propensity. Hence, the following target-binding studies were performed to further elucidate their mechanisim of action.",

            "text": "Article peptides derived from the MERS-CoV S protein CHR domain can bind to their NHR target to form a stable \u03b1-helix hexamer. 11 Here, we first sought to determine the interaction of the stapled helical peptides with their native NHR ligand, designated HR1P, to form stable \u03b1-helical complexes using CD spectroscopy. The significant increase over the sum of the individual spectra of two peptides mixed together in equimolar concentrations indicates that the interaction between them led to enhanced helical structures. 34, 35 The isolated HR1P displays a random coil structure in phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) as judged by CD spectroscopy, which was consistent with previous reports. 11 Both P21S8 and P21S10 interacted with HR1P, resulting in 35.5% and 45.6% \u03b1-helical content in the complex, respectively. The CD signals of the P21S8/HR1P mixture and the P21S10/HR1P mixture at 222 nm were dramatically greater than the mathematical sum of those of the isolated peptides, indicating the induction of a large \u03b1-helical structure upon their interaction ( Figure 3A) . Strikingly, the thermal unfolding transition (T m ) values of P21S8/HR1P and P21S10/HR1P reached 71.1 and 76.4\u00b0C, respectively ( Figure 3B ). Together, these CD data are consistent with P21S8/HR1P and P21S10/ HR1P folding to form thermally stable and cooperatively folded helical bundles. Stapled peptides with moderate activity, including P21S4, P21S5, and P21S9, resulted in a less stable interaction with T m values ranging from 56.6 to 66.6\u00b0C while peptides with very poor antiviral activity showed no, or weak, coiled-coil interactions (Supporting Information, Table S4 ). These results demonstrated a strong correlation between the biological activities and the thermal stabilities of the stapled peptides/HR1P complexes. The binding of the stapled peptides to the NHR-derived peptide HR1P was further confirmed using native (N)-PAGE. In N-PAGE, owing to its net positive charge, HR1P did not appear on the gel as it migrated into the solvent under the native electrophoresis conditions; these results are consistent with previous observations. 11 The respective stapled helical peptides with various antiviral potencies were mixed with HR1P and subjected to N-PAGE analysis. As shown in Figure  3C , both P21S8 and P21S10 formed stable complexes with HR1P, as evidenced by new bands at the upper position in the gel concomitant with the fading or disappearance of the stapled peptide bands, suggesting that oligomeric complexes formed via coiled-coil interactions. The N-PAGE results also indicated a stronger binding of either P21S8 or P21S10 to HR1P than the bindings of P21S4, P21S5, and P21S9 to HR1P based on the densities of the residue-stapled peptide bands observed in the ",

Sprague\u2212Dawley rats (200 \u00b1 10 g) were injected intravenously with the three peptides (4 mg/kg). Seven blood samples were collected sequentially over a 240 min period (three animals at each time point), and the concentrations of the intact peptides in plasma were determined by LC/MS/MS analysis. As shown in Figure 4 and Table 3 , although these three peptides exhibited similar in vivo half-lives, the mean value of the maximum blood concentration (C max ) for P21S10 was 3.6\u22125.8-fold greater than those for P21S8 and HR2P-M2. Meanwhile, we observed dramatic differences among the areas under the plasma concentration\u2212time curve extrapolated to the last time point (AUC 0\u2212t ), a measure of the total systemic exposure to a drug, for the three compounds. The AUC 0\u2212t was 91.3 \u03bcg/(mL\u00b7h) for P21S10 as compared to 44.1 \u03bcg/(mL\u00b7h) for P21S8 and 3.36 \u03bcg/(mL\u00b7h) for HR2P-M2. Consequently, P21S10 showed the lowest systemic clearance (0.041 (L/h)/ kg), which was approximately 25-fold less than that of HR2P-M2 (1.04 (L/h)/kg). Thus, the current results indicate that P21S10 should be further developed as a potential drug candidate on the basis of its high potency in inhibiting infection of divergent MERS-CoV strains and its improved pharmacokinetics compared with HR2P-M2.",

These stapled peptides were able to block the formation of the hexameric coiled-coil fusion complex and thus inhibit viral\u2212 host cell membrane fusion. Our data showed that one of these stapled peptides, P21S10, not only preserves the biologically active \u03b1-helical conformation, as found in the MERS-CoV fusion machinery, but also has good potential to be developed into anti-MERS therapeutics based on its promising antiviral activity, effective native ligand-binding capability, and favorable pharmacokinetics. Formation of MERS-CoV 6-HB fusion core between CHR and NHR is basically the result of \u03b1-helixmediated protein\u2212protein interactions wherein the CHR helix can be considered to have two distinct faces, i.e., a buried hydrophobic surface and a solvent-exposed surface. 29 The established rules of thumb that underline the sequence and structure in coiled coils reveal that stabilization of individual helices will enhance the overall stability of the superhelical protein structural motif. 28 Therefore, strategies used for reinforcing the secondary structure of constituent \u03b1-helices in a coiled coil such as introducing intrahelical salt bridges at solvent accessible site and substitution of noncore residues with helix-favoring amino acids have been successfully applied to HIV fusion inhibitor design. 36 We envisioned that these strategies would also be applicable to the further optimization of our lead compounds found in this study. In addition, rather than generating hydrophobic mutations in buried residues, for future design one should also consider the place of polar amino acids at the interactive site of stapled peptides, which could establish attractive interhelical electrostatic interactions or hydrogen bonds, thus increasing their aqueous solubility and target-binding affinity. 37, 38 Overall, considering the universal 6HB fusion mechanism employed by the class I enveloped viruses, our study establishes the paradigm that hydrocarbon stapling may be an attractive strategy for developing viral entry inhibitors designed to control viral epidemics through recapitulating certain \u03b1-helical peptides of the viral fusion core structures so that NHR/CHR coiled coil-mediated interactions are inhibited.",

Second, Grubbs I catalyst (0.3 equiv) in dichloroethane was added to the resin, the mixture was stirred for 6 h at room temperature, and then repeated treatments with fresh catalyst were carried out for 6 h to obtain more complete conversion.

Inhibitors at the indicated concentrations were then added, followed by the addition of 293T/MERS/EGFP cells or 293T/EGFP cells (1 \u00d7 10 4 per well). After coculture at 37\u00b0C for 4 h, the 293T/MERS/EGFP cells and 293T/EGFP cells fused or unfused with Huh-7 cells were counted under an inverted fluorescence microscope (Nikon Eclipse Ti\u2212S).",

(A) Cartoon representations of the MERS-CoV and HIV 6HBs, in which the NHR trimers and CHR segments are colored in gray and green, respectively. In the HIV 6HB structure (PDB 1AIK), the CHR segments form regular helices that pack against the central NHR core. In contrast, only a short helical domain is found within the MERS-CoV CHR (PDB 4NJL). (B) Helical wheel representation of the 6HB. In the CHR, the residues at the a\u2212d positions (yellow) in direct contact with the NHR domains are buried in the 6HB. (C) Interaction between the NHR and CHR peptides, as well as the designed P21 peptide. The dashed lines between the NHR and CHR domains indicate the interaction between the residues located at the a\u2212d positions in the CHR and the e\u2212g positions in the NHR to form the 6HB. The helical domain sequence in MERS-CoV CHR is highlighted in red.",
