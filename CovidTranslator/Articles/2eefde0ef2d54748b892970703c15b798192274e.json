The advice on the various websites seemed very pragmatic: observe basic hygiene, hand-washing and cough etiquette; do not travel when ill and seek medical advice if you become ill after your return. The patient's route to Canada took him through London (34 cases reported in the UK at that time) and Toronto (15 cases in Ontario) to Saskatoon (2 cases).

The lack of further transmission from this first case in the UAE may be a combination of good and effective public health intervention, or serendipity. Even though H1N1 has high infectivity with low case fatality rates, the number of cases globally declined, and WHO declared the end of the pandemic on 10 th August 2010.",
