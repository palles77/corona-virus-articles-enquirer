Methods: We performed a retrospective cohort study on exposed HCWs from August 2016 to January 2018 at a tertiary hospital in Singapore. Demographic factors and TB exposure episodes per HCW were obtained. A modified Poisson regression model was used to identify factors associated with TB infection. Results: A total of 32 TB exposure events occurred during the study period. A total of 881 HCWs with 1,536 exposure episodes were screened with QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-tube assay (QFT-GIT) at baseline and 8 weeks. A total of 129 (14.6%) HCWs had positive QFT-TB at baseline, whereas 22 (2.5%) HCWs had QFT-GIT conversion, with a latent TB infection (LTBI) rate of 1.14 cases per 100 exposure episodes per year. Foreign nationality, non-Chinese ethnicity, and age above 40 years were independently associated with baseline LTBI, whereas having >2 TB exposure episodes and working in internal medicine, medical subspecialties, and psychiatry wards were associated with QFT-GIT conversion. Discussion: The QFT-GIT conversion rate among screened HCWs is low. Foreign HCWs with LTBI likely came from countries with higher TB transmission. Targeted prevention of repeated TB exposures can reduce QFT-GIT conversion. Conclusions: The study results will guide TB contact tracing protocols in health care institutions.",

Singapore has a total population of about 5.6 million, of which a significant proportion (about 2.2 million) comprises permanent residents or foreigners working, staying, or staying as dependents in Singapore. A recent study found an overall 12.7% QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-tube assay (QFT-GIT, Qiagen, Germantown, MD) positivity rate among Singapore residents. The prevalence is higher with older age. 1 Health care workers (HCWs) are at increased risk of occupational transmission of TB infection from patients. [2] [3] [4] A meta-analysis looking at the risk of TB infection among HCWs reported that the risk of latent TB infection (LTBI) and active TB were greater among HCWs, with an odds ratio of 2.27 and incidence rate ratio of 2.94, respectively, compared with the general population. 2 In Singapore, baseline and periodic screening of HCWs for LTBI are not performed routinely. HCWs are only screened for TB infection if they have been identified to have significant exposure to index TB patients based on the contact tracing protocol.",

Therefore, the baseline prevalence of LTBI among HCWs in our study reflects that in low-burden high-income countries. However, our study only obtained baseline LTBI prevalence among HCWs screened for TB exposure, which may not be representative of all the HCWs in the hospital. In addition, the prevalence of baseline LTBI in our study was obtained by calculating the proportion of HCWs with positive QFT-GIT at T0 for each exposure event, which will be an underestimation as it excludes those who had TB infection in the past and were not screened with QFT-GIT at baseline.",

This could be due to foreign HCWs coming from countries with a higher prevalence of TB transmission. Although the incidence of TB in Singapore was 300 cases per 100,000 population in 1960, the incidence rate has declined to 47 per 100,000 by 2017, owing to an active TB control program. This rate is much lower than that of neighboring countries, including the Philippines, which has a TB incidence rate of 554 cases per 100,000 population. 8 As such, foreign HCWs and HCWs of non-Chinese ethnicity above 40 years of age may be at increased risk of baseline LTBI unrelated to occupational TB exposure at work. TB screening of all exposed HCWs at baseline is therefore important to distinguish between baseline LTBI unrelated to work and work-related QFT-GIT conversion postexposure. HCWs with recent occupationally acquired LTBI are at higher risk of TB activation within the first 2 years.",

In comparison, TB contact tracing investigations in the United States found 23% with LTBI and 1% with active TB disease. This could be because of an overly cautious TB contact tracing protocol, which identifies someone as a TB contact if he or she has been exposed to an index TB case at the same location with shared air supply for >8 hours cumulatively. Moreover, the area dimensions of the locations covered for screening of potential TB contacts may have been too broad, involving those who may not have had close contact with the index TB patient. The TB contact tracing protocol also does not take into account the characteristics of the index patient, susceptibility and vulnerability of contacts, and circumstances of exposure, which have been used to assign priorities for contact investigations by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 15 This \"stone in the pond\" risk stratified approach to TB contact tracing has also been used in a tertiary care hospital in Singapore. As such, further studies are needed to better refine our contact tracing protocol through risk stratification based on exposure settings, as well as characteristics of the index patient and contacts. 16 The number of TB exposure episodes per HCW was associated with QFT-GIT conversion in the bivariate analysis. HCWs with 3 or more TB exposure episodes were 2-3 times as likely to develop LTBI compared with those with only 1 or 2 exposure episodes. This finding is supported by Menzies et al 4 who reported that the occurrence of TB infection among HCWs was associated with the likelihood of TB exposure, as estimated by the annual number of TB admissions as well as the presence or absence of adequate TB infection control measures. In other words, the higher the likelihood of TB exposure and/or the poorer the infection control measures, the higher the risk of TB acquisition among exposed HCWs.

As such, our study also reported that HCWs in medical subspecialties and psychiatric 4 to 6-bedded wards as well as internal medicine 4-6 and 10-bedded wards were more likely to develop LTBI compared with those in surgical disciplines OT rooms. On a separate note, although a study done in Italy reported that older age was associated with postexposure LTBI, 17 our study did not find any statistically significant association between old age and postexposure LTBI. As such, measures should be taken to reduce TB exposure among HCWs by having a high index of suspicion and early diagnosis of pulmonary TB cases, as well as educating HCWs on the strict compliance to the donning of appropriate personal protective equipment during patient care. These measures should also be targeted toward HCWs in clinical disciplines more likely to be exposed to repeated TB exposures and at risk of developing LTBI such as internal medicine, medical subspecialties, and psychiatry with multibedded wards. Although HCWs in Singapore still routinely diagnose TB in patients, there could be delays in diagnosis and isolation. The delay in diagnosis could be due to (1) patients with negative AFB sputum smear but culture-positive pulmonary TB 18 ; (2) pulmonary TB patients but atypical chest radiographic findings 19 ; (3) difficulties in obtaining sputum specimen of sufficient quality for AFB smear 20 ; (4) low awareness of TB among HCWs owing to decline in TB rates among local population following stricter TB infection control measures implemented since 1997 21 ; and (5) diverse manifestations of TB masquerading as other diseases. 22 A systemic review found that mean health care system delay in diagnosis of TB in both inpatient and outpatient settings was 28.4 days in low-middle income countries and 21.5 days in high-income countries. 23 Delays in isolation could be because of (1) resistance to isolation among patients and family members because of inconveniences and social isolation 24 ; and (2) shortage of dedicated negative-pressure single-bedded rooms, which was exacerbated by a need to reserve standby single-bedded isolation rooms for emerging infectious diseases like avian influenza A and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus. 25 To reduce likelihood of TB exposure and decrease the risk of TB infection among HCWs, measures should be taken to minimize unnecessary delay in diagnosis and isolation of patients with pulmonary TB. This could be achieved by (1) developing and implementing clear clinical guidelines on the diagnostic pathway and isolation protocols for patients with suspected TB; (2) encouraging same-day sputum AFB smear microscopy for all patients with suspected pulmonary TB, which is faster and as effective as standard AFB smear microscopy over 2 separate days 26 ; (3) increase availability of sputum induction facilities to improve diagnostic yield in patients with suspected TB 27 ; (4) increase supply of single-bedded isolation rooms; and (5) raise awareness of TB among HCWs.",

Furthermore, there could be nonresponse bias from 66 exposed HCWs who defaulted all their QFT-GIT blood test as well as missing data from HCWs who may have missed some of their QFT-GIT blood test appointments. Despite having missing information on the 66 exposed HCWs, we were not aware of any exposed HCWs who developed active TB during and 3 months after the study period. Also, given that Singapore is endemic for TB with an incidence rate of 47 per 100,000 in 2017, HCWs who experienced QFT-GIT conversion may have contracted TB outside of the health care setting and not attributable to his or her exposure to TB patients in the hospital. Further studies may be needed to identify other occupational exposure risk factors associated with TB infection, such as cumulative duration of exposure and geospatial mapping of HCWs' contact with TB index cases. To aid in this endeavor, physicians caring for exposed HCWs should complete a standardized TB exposure form to better document pertinent details of the TB exposure episode.
