It is possible that CS exacerbates lung damage as well as lead to other fetal complications. Siddiqu and Mehra [11] proposed a 3-stage classification model, recognizing that COVID-19 illness exhibited three g rades of increasing severity which corresponded with distinct clinical findings, response to therapy and clinical outcome. A small proportion of COVID-19 patients would transit into the third and most severe stage of illness, which manifested as an extra-pulmonary systemic hyperinflammation syndrome. In this stage, markers of systemic inflammation appeared to be ext remely elevated. Therefore, how to b lock the CS and when to initiate anti-inflammation therapy is critical for reducing death rate of COVID-19.",

Spleen atrophy was observed in all reported cases with decreased numbers of lymphocyte, and significant cell degeneration, focal hemorrhagic necrosis, macrophage proliferation and macrophage phagocytosis were found in spleen. Similarly, lymph node atrophy and the number of lymph nodes decreased, accompanied by necrosis. Immunohistochemical staining showed that CD4+T cells and CD8+T cells were decreased in spleen and lymph nodes [13] . In addition, in the lung with characteristic diffused alveolar damage (DAD), the major infiltrated cells were monocytes and macrophages, moderate multinucleated giant cells, but very few lymphocytes. Most of the J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Journal Pre-proof infiltrating lymphocytes were CD4-positive T cells. Importantly, virus inc lusion bodies can still be detected in type II alveolar epithelia and macrophages, despite that the PCR test was negative in blood or throat swabs [10, 12, 14] .

Small vessels showed hyperplasia, vessel wall thicken ing, lu men stenosis , occlusion and focal hemorrhage. Hyaline thromb i of micro -vessels were found in a proportion of severe cases [10, 13, 14] . Intriguingly, some patients were tested positive with high titer antiphospholipid antibodies, including anticardio lip in antibodies and anti-\uf0622 g lycoprotein antibodies, and were associated with severe thrombosis (unpublished data). The underlying mechanism of vascular damage may be due to the direct injury of endothelial cells by virus, leading to DIC, anti-phospholipid syndrome (APS) and mimicry of vasculitis. The pathological autoimmune responses involved in the anti-virus immunity are worth to be emphasized. Intravenous immune globulin (IVIG) may also play a ro le in modulat ing an immune system that is in a hyperinflammatory state. Overall, the prognosis and recovery from this critical stage of illness is poor, and prompt recognition and application of such therapy may have the greatest yield [11, 17] .",

All the above questions are still under intense debate and do not reach a consensus. The main concern is that anti-inflammatory medicat ions, such as corticosteroid, may delay the elimination of virus and increase the risk of secondary infection, especially in those with impaired immune system. Secondly, bio logical agents targeting on pro-inflammatory cytokines can only inhibit specific inflammatory factor, and thus may not be very effective in curbing the CS in COVID-19 in which other cytokines maybe of significant importance. Thirdly, some anti-in flammation medicat ion such as JAK inhibitors also block INF-a production, which is important in fighting virus, and theoretically may not be suitable for the treatment of inflammatory CS caused by virus as COVID-19.",

One of the known regulators of endocytosis is the AP2-associated protein kinase 1 (AAK1). AAK1 inhib itors can interrupt the passage of the virus into cells and can be helpful in preventing virus infect ions. Baricit inib, a JAK inhibitor as well as an AAK1 inhibitor, was suggested a possible candidate for treatment of COVID-19, considering its relative safety and high affinity. Therapeutic dosage with either 2 mg or 4 mg once daily was sufficient to reach the plas ma concentration of inhib ition [29] . Ho wever, as we mentioned above, the biggest concern about JAK inhibitors is that it can inhib it a variety of inflammatory cytokines including INF-a, which plays an important ro le in curbing v irus activity. Previous studies reported that CQ/HCQ possess a broad spectrum of antiv iral effects on a variety of viruses as diverse as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) [30] , Marburg virus, Zika virus [31], dengue virus [32] , Ebola virus [33] , and SARS-Co V-1 [34, 35] , etc. CQ and HCQ can interfere with the binding of viral particles to their cellular cell surface receptor or the pH-dependent endosome-med iated viral entry of enveloped viruses to inhibit the v iral cycle [32] . They can also interfere with the post-translational modification of viral proteins or impair the proper maturation of viral p rotein by pH modulation [36] . In addition, CQ and HCQ can regulate immune system by affect ing cell signaling and production of pro-inflammatory cytokines.",

Recently, CQ and HCQ have been shown by several studies to reduce the SARS-Co V-2 v iral load and shorten the duration of viremia. Whether their immuno modulatory effect also plays a ro le in the treat ment of COVID -19 still requires further investigation. For coronaviruses, the potential therapeutic benefits of CQ were notably reported for SA RS-Co V-1. In vitro, CQ can prevent SARS-Co V-1 fro m in fecting the glycosylation of a virus cell surface receptor, ACE2 [30] . A very recent publication of results showed that CQ is highly effect ive in the control of COVID-19 infection in vitro [37] . for treat ment of COVID-19 reco mmends chloroquine phosphate is orally ad min istered at a dose of 500 mg (300 mg for chloroquine) for adults, 2 times/ day (no more than 10 days) [39] . The results of this clinical trial confirmed the short -term efficacy of HCQ in the treat ment of COVID-19, wh ich can effectively improve lung imag ing findings, promote a virus -negative conversion, and shorten the disease course. Although the number of cases in HCQ group was relatively small, current data can provide insights for clin icians. The efficacy and safety of HCQ in the treatment of COVID-19 need to be confirmed in further preclinical and clinical trials.",

As CS is relatively common in severe case and often leads to the exacerbation , anti-inflammation therapy may help in preventing further injury. As we know, there are a variety of anti-inflammatory medications, including non steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, glucocorticoids, chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine, immunosuppressants, inflammatory cytokines antagonists (such as IL-6R monoclonal antibodies, TNF inhib itors, IL-1 antagonists, janus kinase inhibitor (JA K) inhib itors, et al. Siddiqu and Mehra suggested that tailored therapy in stage III hinges on the use of immuno modulatory agents to reduce systemic inflammat ion before it overwhelmingly results in mu lti-organ dysfunction. In this phase, use of corticosteroids may be justified in concert with the use of cytokine inhibitors such as tocilizu mab (IL-6 inhibitor) or anakinra (IL-1 receptor antagonist).",

TCZ has been widely used in rheumatic diseases, such as rheumatoid arth ritis.OnAugust 30, 2017, TCZ was approved in the United States for severe life-threatening cytokine release syndrome caused by chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CART) immunotherapy. Wei Haiming, et al conducted a retrospective study observing the efficacy of tocilizu mab in treating severe or critical COVID-19 patients [to be published]. Along with the basic anti-virus treatment, TCZ was applied to 20 patients 400 mg once intravenously. Within a few days, the fever returned to normal and other symptoms imp roved remarkably. 75.0% had imp roved oxygenation. The opacity lung lesion on CT scans absorbed in 90.5% patients. In addition, the percentage of peripheral ly mphocytes returned to normal in 52.6% patients. Their data suggests TCZ might be an effective treatment in severe patients of COVID-19. Till now, several clinical trials have been registered on safety and efficacy of tocilizu mab in the treatment of severe COVID-19 pneumonia in adult inpatients , including a mult icenter, rando mized controlled trial for the efficacy and safety of tocilizu mab in the treat ment of novel coronary pneumonia (NCP) (Ch iCTR2000029765), a single arm open mu lticenter study on tocilizu mab (Ch iCTR2000030796), and comb ination of tocilizu mab and other drugs (Ch iCTR2000030442 and ChiCTR2000030894).",
