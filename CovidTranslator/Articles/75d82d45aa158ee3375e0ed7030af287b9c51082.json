The in vitro frameshifting efficiency is decreased \u22488 fold upon substitution of the 3\u2032 most loop 2 nucleotide (C27) to adenosine, which accepts a hydrogen bond from the 2\u2032-OH of C14 in stem S1. The solution structures of the wild-type (WT) and the C27A ScYLV RNA pseudoknots show that while the RNAs adopt virtually identical overall structures, there are significant structural differences at the helical junctions of the two RNAs. Specifically, C8 + in loop L1 in the C8 + \u00b7(G12-C28) L1-S2 major groove base triple is displaced by \u22482.3 \u00c5 relative to the accepting stem 2 base pair (G12-C28) in the C27A RNA. Here, we employ a double mutant cycle approach to analyze the pairwise coupling of the C8 + \u00b7(G12-C28) and C27\u00b7(C14-G7) or A27\u00b7(C14-G7) hydrogen bonds in the WT and C27A ScYLV RNAs, respectively, and compare these findings with previous results from the beet western yellows virus (BWYV) RNA. We find that the pairwise coupling free energy (\u03b4 AB i ) is favorable for the WT RNA (-0.7 \u00b10.1 kcal\u00b7mol \u22121 ), thus revealing that formation of these two hydrogen bonds is positively cooperative. In contrast, \u03b4 AB i is +0.9 \u00b10.4 kcal\u00b7mol \u22121 for the poorly functional C27A ScYLV RNA, indicative of non-additive hydrogen bond formation. These results reveal that cooperative hydrogen bond formation across the helical stem junction in H-type pseudoknots correlates with enhanced frameshift stimulation by luteoviral mRNA pseudoknots.",

RNA functions in cap-independent translational initiation by providing a binding site for 40S ribosomal subunits in internal ribosomal entry sites (IRES) (1). Riboswitches are naturally occurring aptamers that bind metabolites including adenine, guanine, S-adenosylmethionine, and thiamine pyrophosphatase that directly regulate the expression of enzymes linked to their production or degradation (2). Folded RNA motifs found in coding regions of mRNAs regulate ribosomal recoding by stimulating stop codon suppression, stop codon redefinition, or change the translational reading frame, an example of which is \u22121 programmed ribosomal frameshifting (\u22121 PRF) (3,4). \u22121 PRF occurs during translational elongation where the mRNA slips back by one nucleotide into the \"\u22121\" reading frame relative to the reference \"0\" frame.

The first is a slip site, which in most cases conforms to the sequence X XXY YYZ, where X is any nucleotide, Y is A or U, and Z is any nucleotide except G (11) . The slip site is positioned in the A and P sites of the ribosome at the time frameshifting occurs. Also required for efficient frameshifting is an RNA structural element, which in many cases is an RNA pseudoknot. This RNA structural element is separated from the 3\u2032 edge of the slip site by a 6 to 8 nucleotide linker. The linker length is likely required for optimally positioning the pseudoknot at the mRNA entry tunnel of the ribosome where the RNA helicase activity is thought to be localized (12) (13) (14) . \u22121 PRF is responsible for the production of the genomically encoded P1 and P1-P2 fusion proteins in plant luteoviruses (15) . The stimulatory RNA structure in luteoviral mRNAs is a hairpin (H)-type RNA pseudoknot, which contains two helical stems (S1, S2) connected by nonequivalent loops (L1, L2). Luteoviral RNA pseudoknots are characterized by an intricate collection of stabilizing tertiary structural loop-loop and loop-stem hydrogen bonding interactions (16) (17) (18) (19) . A C + \u00b7(G-C) L1-S2 major groove trans Watson-Crick/Hoogsteen base triple has been observed in all luteoviral pseudoknots thus far investigated and protonation has been shown to be stabilizing by 2-3 kcal\u00b7mol \u22121 at 37 \u00baC (20) . Further, this interaction is essential for the efficient frameshift stimulation by these pseudoknots (16, 17, 21, 22) . Two L2-S1 minor groove interactions at the helical junction have also been shown to be important for pseudoknot stability and maintenance of frameshifting efficiency (20) .",

Surprisingly, substitution of C27 with adenosine resulted in a nearly complete abrogation of ScYLV pseudoknot-stimulated frameshifting in a simple in vitro assay (from 15% to 1.8%, or \u22482-fold above slip-site alone), with virtually no change in the global structure of the RNA (16, 23) .

            "text": "The relationship between global stability and frameshift stimulation is not entirely clear. The global stability of the downstream structural element, per se, cannot be fully responsible for frameshifting since an RNA hairpin of a global stability similar to that of an RNA pseudoknot does not induce comparable levels of frameshift stimulation (24, 25) . This suggests that there is some feature encoded in the pseudoknot topology itself that is capable of modulating frameshift stimulation. Since structure is unlikely to play a major role (23), one possibility is that a small localized destabilization of the helical junction itself is a major contributor to a decrease in global stability and this, in turn, might account for functional differences between structurally similar RNA pseudoknots. We reasoned that such a destabilization in the C27A ScYLV RNA relative to the WT RNA may well originate with distinct energies of pairwise coupling, \u03b4 AB i , of the two stacked hydrogen bonds that cross the helical junction in these two RNAs (16,23) (see Fig. 1 ). In this paper, we employ thermal melting experiments carried out as a function of pH with site-specific deoxycytidine (dC)-substituted RNAs to elucidate \u03b4 AB i of the C8 + H3-G12 O6 and C27 N3-C14 2\u2032-OH (\u03b4 AB WT ) or A27 N1-C14 2\u2032-OH (\u03b4 AB C27A ) hydrogen bonding interactions at the helical junction of the WT vs. C27A ScYLV RNAs and compare these findings to previous studies of the related frameshifting mRNA from beet western yellows virus (BWYV) (see Fig. 1D ) (20) . We find that both WT RNAs are characterized by a \u03b4 AB i consistent with cooperative hydrogen bond formation. In contrast, the C27A ScYLV RNA is characterized by a pairwise coupling indicative of non-additive hydrogen bond formation, despite the fact the helical junction regions of the weakly functional C27A ScYLV and wild-type BWYV RNAs are quite similar (23) .

The criteria used to determine the number of unfolding transitions is described in the text and elsewhere (16) . The final RNA concentration for the UV melting experiments was 2 \u03bcM in a 600 \u03bcL cuvette. Three or more useable melting profiles were collected for each solution condition and analyzed individually to extract \u0394H i and t m,i with the resulting parameters obtained from multiple experiments averaged (see Tables S1-S4, Supporting Information).

The downfield regions of jump-return echo 1D NMR spectra acquired at 10 \u00baC, pH 6.0 for each of the four RNAs are shown in Fig. 2 . The resonance assignments shown for dC14 and dC14/C27A ScYLV RNAs were confirmed by a 200 ms Watergate 1 H-1 H NOESY spectrum collected at 10 \u00b0C (data not shown). The 1D spectra of the WT and dC14 ScYLV RNAs clearly show that both RNAs are stably folded and that the C8 + imino and amino protons are present; both features are diagnostic for the trans Watson-Crick/Hoogsteen C+\u00b7(G-C) interaction between C8+ and the G12-C28 base pair (29) (see Fig.  1B ,C). Although the imino proton chemical shift of C8+ is degenerate with that of G30 in the C27A RNA and G6 in the dC14/C27A RNA, both RNAs are stably folded since the amino protons are clearly present (Fig. 1C,D) . As expected, the 2\u2032-OH of C14 is absent in the dC14/ C27A ScYLV RNA (Fig. 2D ). Since the WT C14 2\u2032-OH resonance (\u2248 8.5 ppm) (16) is in a crowded region of the 1D spectrum, a 200 ms NOESY spectrum was used to confirm the absence of this 2\u2032-OH proton in the dC14 ScYLV RNA (data not shown).",

These RNA pseudoknots are composed of a 5 base pair S1 (4 in the case of potato leaf roll virus (PLRV) (19)), a 3 base pair S2, a 2 nucleotide loop L1, and a 7 to 9 nucleotide loop L2. A coupled equilibrium model comprising three sequential, two-state unfolding transitions (Scheme 1) previously established for the BWYV pseudoknot (26) was applied to other wild-type and variant pseudoknots when sufficient resolution of individual unfolding transitions was observed on the temperature coordinate (20) . Each equilibrium unfolding step is characterized by a van't Hoff enthalpy of unfolding, \u0394H vH , and a melting temperature, t m , (see Schemes 1,2). In the 3-step unfolding profile, the first unfolding step is assigned to disruption of the loop-stem (L2-S1 and L1-S2) interactions in the fully folded (F) RNA pseudoknot to form PK, which is followed by the unfolding of the weaker stem S2 (S1 HP), and subsequently stem S1 (U). In cases where the first two unfolding steps were coincident on the temperature axis and sufficient unfolding enthalpy was recovered under this transition, Scheme 2 was used to analyze the melting profiles. In this scheme. the disruption of the tertiary structural interactions and S2 occurs during the first unfolding transition giving rise to a single S1 HP intermediate (16) .",

The first model is a simple binding model (eq. 1) that attributes the entire change in \u0394G 37 as a function of pH to protonation of a single group in the folded RNA according to the function [1] where \u0394G 37 unprotonated and \u0394G 37 protonated represent the \u0394G 37 values for the fully unprotonated and fully protonated state of the folded RNA molecules, respectively (20) . Here, pK a is an apparent pK a where K a is equal to the acid dissociation equilibrium constant that governs C8 + deprotonation. This may not reflect the intrinsic pK a , since this analysis ignores differential H + binding to the unfolded state relative to the folded state outside of this titratable group, and linkage to acid-induced or alkaline-induced unfolding (see below) (30) . The fits to the data are displayed in Figure 5 (continuous line) with the resolved thermodynamic parameters from the fits compiled in Table 1 . As was previously shown, the C27A RNA is destabilized with respect to the WT ScYLV RNA due to the rearrangement of the helical junction by \u22481.2 kcal\u00b7mol \u22121 over the entire pH-range (16) . The \u0394G 37 protonated of the dC14 RNA is 0.6\u00b10.2 kcal\u00b7mol \u22121 less than the WT ScYLV RNA with \u0394G 37 unprotonated the same within experimental error. Interestingly, the downward shift for C27A in the apparent pK a is only 0.4 units, which is much smaller than the 1.6 unit shift previously observed for the dC14 BWYV RNA (20) . In contrast to the dC14 ScYLV RNA, the \u0394G 37 protonated for dC14/C27A ScYLV RNA is approximately equal to \u0394G 37 protonated for the reference C27A RNA (\u0394\u0394G protonated =0.2 \u00b10.3 kcal\u00b7mol \u22121 ), with the \u0394G 37 unprotonated more positive by 0.7 (\u00b10.3) kcal\u00b7mol \u22121 ; here, there is a negligible shift in apparent pK a .",

            "text": "A standard double mutant cycle strategy was next employed to obtain \u03b4 AB WT and \u03b4 AB C27A using the WT\u00b7H+ as the overall system reference state (see Fig. 7 ). \u03b4 AB WT is the pairwise coupling free energy that defines the extent to which elimination of both C27 N3-C14 2\u2032-OH (via the deoxyC14 substitution) and C8 + H3-G12 O6 (via raising the pH) hydrogen bonds in the WT ScYLV RNA (\u0394G AB WT ) differs from the sum of the loss of each hydrogen bond individually (\u0394G A WT and \u0394G B WT , respectively) (31). Likewise, \u03b4 AB C27A defines the analogous free energy difference for the C27A ScYLV pseudoknot, i.e., loss of the A27 N1-C14 2\u2032-OH (\u0394G A C27A ) and C8 + H3-G12 O6 (\u0394G B C27A ) hydrogen bonds individually or in combination (\u0394G AB C27A ). \u03b4 AB i is therefore defined as [9] \u0394G A i , \u0394G B i and \u0394G AB i are obtained by manipulation of \u0394G 37 protonated for WT\u00b7H+, dC14\u00b7H +, C27A\u00b7H+ and dC14-C27A\u00b7H+ ScYLV RNAs, i.e., the RNA species on the left side of the thermodynamic cube (Fig. 7) . and \u0394G 37 unprotonated for the same four deprotonated RNAs, i.e., those on the right side of the thermodynamic cube (Fig. 7) . These \u0394G 37 protonated and \u0394G 37 unprotonated values are compiled in Table 1 and reproduced on the thermodynamic cube in Fig. 7 (in italics) . For example, \u0394G A WT = \u22125.9 \u2212 (\u22126.5)=0.6 kcal mol \u22121 , \u0394G B WT = \u2212 3.5 \u2212 (\u22126.5)=3.0 kcal mol \u22121 , and \u0394G AB WT = \u22123.6 \u2212(\u22126.5)=2.9 kcal mol \u22121 . Thus, \u03b4 AB WT = 2.9 \u2212 (3.0 +0.6) = \u22120.7 kcal mol \u22121 reflecting a favorable pairwise coupling free energy and indicative of positive cooperativity of hydrogen bond formation (\u03b4 AB i <0) (see Table 2 ). Note that if \u03b4 AB i =0, then \u0394G AB i = \u0394G A i + \u0394G B i . In this case, formation of each hydrogen bond is additive or non-cooperative, and the loss of the A or B interaction is not influenced by the loss of the remaining interaction at site B or A, respectively. If \u03b4 AB i >0, the pairwise coupling is unfavorable and formation of both hydrogen bonds is non-additive. \u0394G A i , \u0394G B i , \u0394G AB i and \u03b4 AB WT and \u03b4 AB C27A values calculated in this way are compiled in Table 2 , as are the corresponding values obtained from a similar analysis of the closely related BWYV and dC14 BWYV pseudoknots published previously (20) . Interestingly, both \u03b4 AB WT and \u03b4 AB BWYV are significantly negative, indicative of positively cooperative formation of these two hydrogen bonds that straddle the helical junction. In contrast, \u03b4 AB C27A has a positive sign, indicative of non-additivity of hydrogen bond formation across the helical junction. This finding is consistent with the free energy cycles that yield \u03b4 AB C8+ and \u03b4 AB C8 (Fig. 7 , left and right). \u03b4 AB C8+ and \u03b4 AB C8 are equal to \u22120.8 and +0.8 kcal mol \u22121 , respectively (see Table 2 ), and reflects the extent to which perturbation of the H-bond donor (dC14) and acceptor (C27A) sides of the same C27 N3-C14 2\u2032-OH hydrogen bond, individually and in combination, is influenced by protonation of immediately adjacent C8. At low pH, this coupling is favorable (\u03b4 AB C8+ <0), i.e., the folding free energy of the double mutant is less negative then the sum of each of the underlying single mutants, with the opposite true at high pH in the deprotonated forms of the RNA (\u03b4 AB C8 >0). Finally, using the WT\u00b7H+ conformation as the reference state for the thermodynamic cube, and denoting \u0394G C WT as \u0394\u0394G protonated for the C27A vs. WT ScYLV RNAs and \u0394G ABC WT as \u0394\u0394G protonated for the dC14/C27A vs. WT RNAs (and \u0394G A WT and \u0394G B WT defined as above) one can also calculate the three-way coupling in this system, \u0394G 3 , according to: [10] where \u0394G 3 is equal to the folding free energy of the triple substitution mutant dC14/C27A RNA at high pH, \u0394G ABC WT , minus the sum of the folding free energies of the single mutants and each of the six pairwise couplings, \u03b4 AB i ( Table 2) . \u0394G 3 is \u22121.8 kcal mol \u22121 , which is indicative of a strong coupling network in the WT ScYLV RNA.",

            "text": "[12] [13] for the binding model, allowing us to define a new term, \u03b4 AB i,eff (pH), the effective pairwise coupling as a function of pH, according to: [14] Exactly analogous expressions were derived for the linkage model (see eqs. 2-4), using pK a and parameters resolved from the linkage model fits (Table 1 , italicized parameters). Plots of \u03b4 AB i,eff as a function of pH are presented as simulated curves using parameters derived from the binding model (Fig. 8A) and linkage model (Fig. 8B ). As expected, at low pH, \u03b4 AB i,eff (pH) = \u03b4 AB i (from Table 2 ) for each RNA; this occurs as a result of taking the WT\u00b7H + , C27A\u00b7H + or BYWV\u00b7H + as the reference state in each case. In Fig. 8A , \u03b4 AB i,eff first goes more negative or favorable for the WT ScYLV (continuous line) and BWYV (dotted line) RNAs; the depth of this trough is essentially determined by the difference in binding pK a 's between the WT and dC14-containing RNAs, which is greater for the BWYV RNA (see Table  1 ) (20) . As the pH is further increased, \u03b4 AB i,eff becomes less negative and vanishes altogether at pH\u22658.0, fully expected since the concentration of protonated RNA molecules becomes very small at high pH. The situation is dramatically different for the C27A ScYLV RNA, where \u03b4 AB i,eff is positive or unfavorable at all pH values, until vanishing as expected at high pH (Fig.  8A, dashed line) . Roughly similar trends in the simulated curves are obtained with the linkage model-derived parameters (Fig. 8B) , except that there are no troughs since eq. [7] is monotonic, and \u03b4 AB i,eff vanishes at significantly higher pH values due to the higher pK a 's derived from this analysis (Table 1 ). Fig. 8C shows the results of plotting \u0394\u03b4 AB i,eff , defined as \u03b4 AB WT\u03b4 AB C27A , derived from the binding (solid line) and linkage (dashed line) model parameters compared to the experimental global \u0394\u0394G 37 measured as a function of pH (16) . This is a measure of the degree to which the relative differences in pairwise coupling free energies across the helical junction measured for the wild-type and C27A RNAs track with global differences in stability between the two RNAs. Although the trends in \u0394\u0394G 37 do not show a simple pH-dependence, the average value of \u0394\u0394G 37 (\u22121.1 \u00b10.3 kcal mol \u22121 , dashed line) is of the same sign and magnitude, and well within the simulated values of \u0394\u03b4 AB i,eff over the entire pH range, with \u0394\u03b4 AB i,eff more negative than \u0394\u0394G 37 at pH<7, and less negative at higher pH values. This is particularly so considering a conservative estimate of \u00b10.5 kcal mol \u22121 uncertainty in the experimental values of \u0394 \u03b4 eff i particularly at low pH (see Table 2 ). These data are therefore generally consistent with the idea that much of the global \u0394\u0394G 37 can be traced to an altered pairwise coupling of these two cross junction hydrogen bonds between functional (WT) and poorly functional (C27A) ScYLV RNA pseudoknots. This is fully consistent with the structures of these two RNAs (16, 23 ).",

            "text": "This result reveals that the energetics of pairwise hydrogen bond coupling is not well predicted by the global structure alone, but it is instead strongly influenced by the context in which these interactions are made. An implicit assumption in any pairwise coupling experiment is that the structures of the molecule lacking one or both hydrogen bonds are essentially identical and all that is missing is the hydrogen bond itself and the energetic consequences that derive from deleting it. Since hydrogen bond strength is influenced by hydrogen bond geometry (length and angle), the extent to which formation of two hydrogen bonds is pairwise coupled could also be influenced by small structural differences among all four RNAs at low vs. high pH. Very high resolution structures of these RNAs under a variety of solution conditions would be required to address this. In fact, introduction of a single deoxyribose substitution in an otherwise all-RNA context may also perturb the sugar pucker from C3\u2032-endo (N-type) to C2\u2032endo (S-type) (32), albeit to varying degrees, which might indirectly influence the magnitude of hydrogen bond coupling by perturbing the local structure. However, this is clearly not the case here since NMR data clearly reveal that the dC14 sugar pucker adopts a C3\u2032-endo conformation, like C14 in the WT RNA (16) . 1 In general, the measured pairwise coupling free energy may not be direct and the presence or absence of specific interactions in the BWYV vs. C27A ScYLV RNAs may play a role in determining the magnitude and sign of the pairwise coupling free energy. One way to establish whether a measured pairwise coupling free energy is direct or indirect is to introduce a mutation or substitution into a third site and i be re-evaluated (31) . If the two values of \u03b4 AB i are not equal, then the AB pairwise coupling is indirect, thus providing evidence for a more complex network of thermodynamically coupled or cooperative interactions. In this regard, it is important to further consider the structural differences between the C27A ScYLV and BWYV RNAs. Comparison of Figs. 1C and 1D reveals that the helical junction of the C27A ScYLV RNA is more strongly over-rotated than the BWYV RNA, which results in poorer stacking of the two junction triple base pairs; this in turn, might influence the degree of pairwise coupling of junction hydrogen bonds in these two RNAs. However, this cannot be the sole reason for the different \u03b4 AB i since the WT ScYLV RNA is even more poorly stacked than in the C27A RNA (see Fig. 1B-C) .",

Interestingly, deletion of C25 in ScYLV RNAs consistently increases frameshift stimulation by \u22482-fold in a variety of structural contexts; simultaneous deletion of C25 with one other L2 nucleotide increases frameshift-stimulation by the C27A RNA 3-fold, resulting in a functional activity indistinguishable from the wild-type BWYV RNA (16) .

The pseudoknot has to be stable enough to resist mechanical unwinding by the elongating ribosome in a kinetically relevant rate, but not too stable as to induce dissociation 1 A NOESY spectrum (\u03c4 m =120 ms) acquired in D 2 O was used to assign the H1\u2032 (5.67 ppm), H2\u2032 (2.70 ppm), and H2\u2033 (3.36 ppm) protons of dC14. Only the sequential dC14 H2\u2032-C15 H6 NOE is clearly observed in this spectrum with the dC14 H2\u2033-C15 H6 NOE not readily detected. In addition, there are no detectable dC14 H1\u2032-H2\u2032 or H1\u2032-H2\u2033 correlations in the TOCSY spectrum under conditions where sugars with known C2\u2032 endo puckers give intense correlations, e.g., U19 (spectra not shown). All of these data are fully consistent with the conclusion that the dC14 sugar adopts a C3\u2032 endo conformation in the dC14 RNA.. of the translation elongation complex. In this way of thinking, the pseudoknot provides a kinetic barrier to ribosome-mediated unfolding (and/or refolding). The studies reported here extend our previous structural work on this system, and support the hypothesis that those helical junctions with favorable \u03b4 AB i may well resist ribosome-mediated resolution of the pseudoknot more effectively than those characterized by less favorable or unfavorable \u03b4 AB i since these would likely lower the kinetic barrier to ribosome-mediated unwinding. In this regard, it will be of interest to investigate hydrogen bond coupling throughout the molecule. For example, although deletion of the 2\u2032-OH protons of C15 or A16 riboses might be predicted to have a significant impact on global stability (20) , it would be of interest to determine how the magnitude of \u03b4 AB i is affected by deoxynucleotide substitutions further from the C8 + \u00b7(G12-C28) major groove base triple. This would provide insight into the cooperativity of the loopstem interactions in frameshifting RNAs. Finally, we note that the magnitude of the pairwise coupling as operationally defined here is dependent on pH, making the prediction that the efficiency of frameshifting induced by luteoviral pseudoknots might also be influenced by the pH.

Optically monitored thermal melting profiles acquired at 260 (\u2022) and 280 nm (\u25cb) for the WT (panels A, C, E) and dC14 (B, D, F) ScYLV RNA pseudoknots at pH 6.0 (A, B), pH 7.0 (C, D) and pH 8.0 (E, F). The smooth lines through the data represent the results of a nonlinear least squares simultaneous fit of the A260 and A280 melting profiles to either a two-(panels A, C, E) or three-(panels B, D, F) transition unfolding model. Best-fit component unfolding transitions at A260 are shown as continuous green, red and blue lines as defined by the two or three sequential unfolding transitions described by Schemes 1 (red, blue) and 2 (green, red, and blue solid lines), respectively. The resulting thermodynamic parameters derived from these fits are compiled in Tables S1-S2. Conditions: 10 mM buffer salt, 0.5 M KCl. Only every fifth data point is shown for clarity. Optically monitored thermal melting profiles acquired at 260 (\u2022) and 280 nm (\u25cb) for the C27A (panels A, C, E) and dC14/C27A (B, D, F) ScYLV RNA pseudoknots at pH 6.0 (A, B), pH 7.0 (C, D) and pH 8.0 (E, F).

Measured \u0394G 37 vs. pH for WT, dC14, C27A, dC14/C27A, BWYV and dC14 BWYV pseudoknots fit to two different models. \u0394G=\u0394G 1 for WT ScYLV RNA (see Table S1 ); \u0394G=\u0394G 1 + \u0394G 2 for dC14 RNA (see Table S2 ); \u0394G=\u0394G 1 for C27A ScYLV RNA (see Table  S3 ); \u0394G=\u0394G 1 + \u0394G 2 for dC14/C27A RNA (between pH 5-7) and \u0394G=\u0394G 2 (between pH 7.5-9) (see Table S4 ). The continuous line (binding equation) through the experimental data represents a fit to a binding model, which ascribes the pH-dependence of the unfolding to protonation of a single titratable group on the folded RNA (see text for details) (eq. 1). The dashed line (linkage equation) corresponds to a fit to the linkage model, which ascribes the pH-dependence of the unfolding to a single ionizable group in the folded state, with multiple ionizable groups in the acid-induced unfolded state (eqs. [2] [3] [4] . The parameter values and associated standard errors from these fits are compiled in Table 1 . Thermodynamic cube that encompasses all linkage relationships between the various ScYLV RNAs investigated in this work. The global reference state is the wild-type ScYLV RNA at low pH, WT\u00b7H+. The numbers in italics below each RNA represent the folding free energies (\u0394G 37 ) derived from the binding equation (eq 1) fits (given in Table 1 ).
