It is found that pairwise conditional correlations among tourism demand for Jeju, Thailand, Singapore and the Philippines are not constant but time-varying. Estimated conditional correlations among Jeju and the three Asian countries are negative over some time periods. This implies that the three Asian countries are substitutes for Jeju in certain specific time horizons. The VEC model is used to investigate the short-run and long-run dynamic relationships and the results reveal that Industrial Production Index and real exchange rates had the positive or negative impact on conditional correlations of tourism demand for these destinations. Tourism policy implications are discussed for managing tourism demand for these destinations.",

            "text": "Over the past several decades, the tourism industry in South Korea has increasingly become a significant segment of the national economy. Tourism expenditures accounted for 3.2% of the total final demand and value-added revenue induced from tourism-related businesses made up 3.5% of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in South Korea in 1988 (Oh, 2005) . Twenty years later, the contribution of travel and tourism to the Korean GDP is estimated to reach 6.6% in 2008 by the World Travel and Tourism Council (2008) . Before 1988, the Korean government restricted outbound travel by Korean citizens to control the outflow of foreign currency while promoting rigorously inbound tourism through mega events such as the 1986 Asian Games and 1988 Olympic Games. As a result, inbound tourism grew rapidly and South Korea enjoyed a surplus in its balance of payment in travel account. However, the Korean government lifted the restriction on outbound travel by Korean citizens as well as the spending limit on credit card use during overseas travel by passing the Liberalization of Travel Code in late 1988 (Mak, 1992; Singh, 1997) . After the removal of the outbound travel restriction by the government, outbound travel by Korean tourists gradually increased and the trend continued markedly throughout the 1990s and the first part of 2000s. Consequently, South Korea experienced seven consecutive years of deficits in the national balance of payments in travel account from 2000 to 2006. For example, the number of inbound tourists to Korea was recorded at 6.16 million while the number of Korean outbound tourists reached 11.61 million in 2006, resulting in a staggering deficit of $8.49 billion in the balance of payments in travel account (Korean Tourism Organization, 2007) .",

Particularly, Korean leisure tourism demand for Asian countries, such as Thailand, Japan, China, Singapore and the Philippines, has markedly increased since 1992, except during the Asia Financial Crisis in 1997 and the outbreak of SARS in 2003. 1 The outbound tourism gradually affected Korean domestic tourism. Jeju Island, located to the southeast of Korea and recently designated as a World Natural Heritage site by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) in June 2007, has been a leisure and honeymoon destination for Koreans. 2 The number of Korean and international tourists to Jeju Island was approximately 4.7 and 0.38 million in 2005 respectively, according to Jeju Special Self-Governing Provincial Tourism Association. 3 Despite Jeju's pristine island landscapes and beach resorts -in comparison to other popular destinations on the Korean peninsula -Korean tourists have been influenced to overseas vacations by many push and pull factors. The push factors include increased discretionary income, relaxed policy on outbound travel and spending, available leisure time, and strong motivations for overseas travel. The pull factors are demonstrated in aggressive marketing by overseas tourism destinations, favorable foreign exchange rates, and convenient and competitive tour packages. The Korean tourism authority is now faced with the challenges of promoting Korean destinations to domestic tourists.",

These determinants can reveal how selected major Korean macroeconomic variables affect Korean tourists' demand for Jeju and the other popular Asian destinations. As a competitive analysis, three Asian countries, the Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand, were selected for this study because these three countries also feature beautiful islands and have been popular with Korean tourists since the 1990s. Thailand, the Philippines, and Singapore were ranked the 4th, 5th and 8th outbound tourist destinations for the Koreans in 2005, respectively. Eighty-six percept of Korean visitors to Thailand, 81.4% to the Philippines and 70.2% to Singapore were reported as leisure tourists by the Korea Tourism Organization in 2005. In addition, Table 1 illustrates that 63.5% of Korean outbound tourists visited Jeju Island as FIT, but 75.9%, 80.3%, and 83.4%, respectively, of Korean outbound tourists took package tours to the Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand.",

The relationship of Korean outbound tourism demand for Jeju and the three Asian destinations can be measured by correlation coefficient. Usually, correlation coefficient is given by a constant which is not time-varying. However, in reality, correlation coefficient of tourism demand between two destinations may not be a constant since it can fluctuate over time. The MGARCH model with DCC specification, proposed by Engle (2002) , provides a useful way to estimate conditional (time-varying) variance-covariance matrix. Thus, the dynamic structure of conditional correlations among Korean outbound tourism demand for Jeju Island and the three Asian destinations can be analyzed by estimating DCC-MGARCH model. Once the time-varying correlation series are determined, the effects of major macroeconomic variables can be analyzed by the usual regression setup. It is well known that many macroeconomic variables are non-stationary (Nelson & Plosser, 1982) . It is therefore very useful to apply VECM to evaluating such non-stationary behavior of time-series variables (Engle & Granger, 1987) . Thus, VECM is applied to determining the effects of major economic variables to the time-varying correlation among Korean outbound tourism demand for Jeju Island and the three Asian destinations.",

            "text": "However, they assumed that the conditional correlation is constant over time, which could be an especially strong assumption in the real world. This study applies the multivariate generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (MGARCH) model, one of the most frequently used methods to estimate the timevarying covariance matrix, to determine the conditional correlation coefficient as a measure for analyzing the time-varying relationships of tourism demand for Jeju and the three Asian destinations. The variance-covariance matrix is estimated each time to calculate the time-varying correlation coefficient. In this study, the MGARCH model with the dynamic conditional correlation (DCC) specification proposed by Engle (2002) was adopted to estimate the conditional correlation among the Korean tourism demand for Jeju Island and the three competing Asian destinations. As in previous research, Chan et al. (2005) noted that the constant conditional correlation multivariate GARCH model is not significantly different from one another and suggested the DCC model of Engle (2002) as a new approach for examining the dynamic structure of interdependent and dependent effects of international tourism demand. Moreover, determinants of the conditional correlations are examined using the vector error correction model (VECM) with time-series data of the Industrial Production Index (IPI) and real exchange rate for each country. The error correction model (ECM) is a frequently adopted methodology for analyzing tourism demand (e.g., Kulendran & King, 1997; Seddighi & Shearing, 1997; Vogt & Wittayakorn, 1998) . Kulendran (1996) applied the cointegration and ECM methods to estimate the short-run and long-run relationships between tourism demand and its determinants using quarterly tourism demand data. Kim and Song (1998) took the cointegration and error correction approach to examine the long-run and short-run international tourism demand of four countries for visiting Korea. After estimating VECM, the authors performed the impulse response and forecasting variance decomposition analyses to determine how major macroeconomic variables affect relationships of tourism demand for these various destinations.",

As a result, various combinations of lag order for AR and ARMA models are constructed. Based on Akaike Information Criteria (AIC) and Schwarz Bayesian Criteria (SBC), AR of order 2 lag order 2, or AR (2), is selected. Table 3 shows the estimated results of the proposed MGARCH model using a maximum likelihood estimation method assuming multivariate normality of error distribution. All the autoregressive coefficients are highly significant. All negative values of c i,1 imply that all tourism demand is negatively related with the previous one. The results of conditional variance equations are b imply that the conditional correlation is time-varying. However, the seasonal effects cannot be created. For countries with island destinations, summer or winter effects turn out to be quite significant. For example, the Philippines and Singapore have strong positive winter effects, e.g., the ''January effect'' for Korean tourists to escape the cold climate at home. The conditional variances for Y jeju , Y phil , Y sing , and Y thai are plotted in Fig. 3 . For Jeju, although the volatility of tourist departures were higher than those of the other destinations before 1990, there have been less fluctuations since 1990. The volatility of domestic visitors to Jeju Island were rather stable despite positive mega events or unfavorable events that took place in Korea in recent years, including the Asian Financial Crisis (1997) (1998) (1999) Thus, it can be surmised that Korean outbound travel to these three Asian countries could have different determinants of volatility due to tourist behavior and various other events. Fig. 4 shows time-varying conditional correlations among the four destinations for Korean tourists. Three periodsdbefore 1988, from 1988 to the Asian Financial Crisis (1997), and 1997-2006dare examined and analyzed. Regardless of these categories, all conditional correlations for tourism demand among the three Asian destinations have shown increasing patterns. This implies that a positive relationship tends to increase as time progresses. However, for the conditional correlations of tourism demand between Jeju and the three Asian destinations, there have been negative conditional correlations over certain time horizonsdfor example, in the early 1980s, around 1990, and around 2000. The negative correlation in the early 1980s could be attributed to strict overseas travel control by the Korean government. The negative correlation during this period could be recognized as the ''substitute effect.'' It shows that the change in demand was entailed by the change in the rate of exchange rate between two goods (Varian, 2005) . Most tourists sensitive to the variability of the price could (1997) , there were distinctive ''U''-shape conditional correlations between Jeju and the three Asian countries. Those ''U''-shape conditional corrections can be attributed to certain macroeconomic variables or Korea's country-specific events. From 1997 to 2006, conditional correlations showed a decreasing pattern, a possible indication of sharp upward trends of Korean outbound tourists. All conditional correlations had similar trends from 1980 to 1988. However, when the Liberalization of the Travel Code was instituted in 1988, it had a significant impact on conditional corrections. It was not long before conditional correlations COR12, COR13, and COR23 appeared in the same trends, usually toward the upper drifts. 6 On the other hand, COR14, COR24, and COR34 displayed decreasing trends from 1988 to mid 1990s. 7 These correlations, COR14, COR24, and COR34, always remained below the former three conditional correlations. The Liberalization of the Travel Code (1988) affected clearly tourists' outbound decisions since tourists had more choices of their overseas vacation destinations. Conditional correlations including Jeju Island were always below the patterns of other conditional correlations. It is thus inferred that the Jeju Island was substituted by the Korean outbound tourists for the three Asian destinations. Therefore, it is important to further analyze the trend of Korean outbound tourism demand after a significant tourism policy change, in this case, after the Liberalization of the Travel Code was introduced in 1988.",

Fig. 5 shows responses of the conditional correlation between Thailand and Jeju Island (COR14). The response of COR14 to a shock to itself has been fluctuating smoothly up to ten months and converged to a positive constant, 0.024. For a shock to IPI, the response of COR14 moved monotonously to 0.0043 for the first ten months and reached 0.0044 in the long-run. The response of the shock to the real exchange rate of Thailand was negative for the first four months, but turned to a positive value and converged to 0.01 in the long-run. This can be regarded as behavioral change of potential tourists regarding Jeju Island. Since there was a positive shock in the exchange rate, price-sensitive potential tourists for Jeju were quick to change their travel plan for Thailand. Therefore, potential tourists for Thailand became actual arrivals so that the correlation between tourism demand of Thailand and Jeju decreased in the short-run. However, in the long-run, tourists who wanted to travel to Jeju and who did not go to Thailand before the exchange rate shock were likely to visit Jeju. This should make COR14 increase in the long-run. The shock to the conditional correlation between the Philippines and Jeju Island (COR34) made COR14 increase by 0.01 in the long-run. On the other hand, the response of COR14 to the conditional correlation between Singapore and Jeju Island (COR24) varied from zero, to \u00c00.011 to zero during the first ten months, and was \u00c00.012 in the long-run.

For a positive shock to COR34, the response of COR24 decreased from zero to \u00c00.001 in the first month, increased from \u00c00.001 to 0.0035 up to ten months, and was 0.0034 in the long-run. The response of COR24 to a shock to the real exchange rate of the Philippines had been widely fluctuating, from zero to \u00c00.012 up to ten months, and converged to a negative constant \u00c00.012 in the long-run. This can be attributed to the changes in the behavior of actual tourists for Jeju Island and Singapore. Some price-sensitive tourists, including potential tourists for Singapore and Jeju Island, tended to alter their plans to visit the Philippines when there was a positive shock to the real exchange rate of the Philippines. Thus, the conditional correlation between the tourism demand of Singapore and Jeju Island was decreasing. However, it is not discernable whether the real exchange rate of the Philippines directly affected tourists bound for Jeju Island and Singapore. Fig. 7 describes responses of COR34 to positive shocks to tested variables, including COR34 itself. The response of COR34 to a shock to IPI was decreasing from \u00c00.0035 to \u00c00.0046 up to ten months and then converged to a negative constant, \u00c00.0046. For a shock to the real exchange rate of the Philippines, the response of COR34 decreased sharply, from \u00c00.0050 to \u00c00.0082 during the first three months, then increased from \u00c00.0082 to \u00c00.0055 up to 18 months, and finally converged to \u00c00.0055 in the long-run. Thus, the positive shocks to the real exchange rate of the Philippines and IPI affected the potential tourism demand of Jeju Island. Since there was a positive shock to the real exchange rate, some price-sensitive tourists originally planned for visiting Jeju were willing to change their decision for the Philippines. In addition, when income increased, the number of tourists destined for the Philippines increased, so that the correlation between the tourism demand of the Philippines and Jeju also decreased in the short-run and in the long-run. The responses of the shock to the real exchange rates of Singapore and Thailand were \u00c00.004 and \u00c00.002 in the long-run, respectively. Thus, Singapore and Thailand can be regarded in the long-run as the substitute destinations for the Philippines and Jeju Island for price-sensitive tourists.",

COR24 was also shown to be mostly autonomous in variance decomposition, but COR14 explained less than 5% variance after ten months, and COR34 affected very slightly, about 1%, on COR24.

It is found that piecewise conditional correlations among tourism demand for Jeju and the three Asian countries are not constant but time-varying. The estimated dynamic conditional correlations among Jeju and these Asian destinations have shown increasing trends from the Liberalization of the Travel Code in 1988 The estimated conditional correlation is used to analyze the determinants of each conditional correlation by considering a regression-based model. By constructing VECM with the Industrial Production Index (IPI) and the real exchange rate, the determinants of conditional correlations are therefore determined and presented. Five important aspects of Korean outbound tourism demand are identified in this study to address the research questions.",

Secondly, regarding the conditional correlation of Singapore and Jeju Island (COR24), the positive shock to IPI affected COR24 from being slightly negative in the first ten months to positive in the long-run. Unexpectedly, the real exchange rate of Singapore, compared with that of the Philippines, did not explain well the variance of COR24 in the long-run. Thirdly, for the conditional correlation of the Philippines and Jeju Island, the shocks to IPI and the exchange rate of the Philippines negatively affected the responses of COR34 in the short-run and in the long-run. The COR14 determined almost 30% of the variance in COR34, but the real exchange rates and IPI explained relatively little. Fourthly, the real exchange rate affected significantly the conditional correlations when it was compared with IPI. Finally, conditional correlations were always shown to be largely autonomous in VD. From time to time, the real exchange rates of the competitive countries better explained their own conditional correlations.",

Evidently, the real exchange rate is a better indicator for Korean outbound tourism demand than other economic indicators. The results indicate that Korean outbound tourists were more concerned with the price of travel. Therefore, policy makers and destination managers in South Korea need to consider the real exchange effect. It is recommended that they consider flexible pricing strategies for Jeju Island to correspond with the change of real exchange rates to improve its competitiveness against the three Asian destinations. Implications for policy planning and destination management are recommended for each destination investigated in this study and then are summarized as general applications for studying tourism demand and volatility.",

Conventionally, tourism demand between two destinations is calculated as a constant correlation coefficient, the constant OLS estimator in the classical linear regression model. However, it is believed that tourism arrival/ departure time-series demonstrate conditional heteroskedasticity with time-varying interdependence between tourism demand and their determinants. The DCC-MGARCH models are able to calculate dynamic conditional covariance matrix and provide useful information which helps determine tourism demand volatility influenced by economic factors and world events during specific periods of time.",

Administratively, the MGARCH models help tourism authority identify outbound/inbound travel pattern changes affected by the changes in the global economic environment, so the policy makers can adjust or adopt tourism policy to respond to market changes in outbound or inbound tourism demand and volatility. Based on the empirical results of this study, the increasing outflow of Korean outbound tourism to the three Asian destinations was fueled by the favorable real exchange effect, the South Korean Tourism Authority needs to formulate new policy to stimulate domestic tourism, such as initiating a marketing campaign with competitive tour products and services. Operationally, destination managers can use the MGARCH models to determine the volatility of tourism flows by analyzing the determinants of time-varying correlations among target market demand for their destinations and then construct competitive marketing strategies to (1) attract target inbound tourists to visit their destinations and (2) develop strategic partnership to promote regional tourism development by leveraging and complementing each destination's assets and marketing resources.",

Competitive pricing of airline fare can promote Jeju Island to Korean mainland outbound tourists. From policy perspective, local and federal governments should consider and support the development of regional low-cost carriers (LCC) to reduce airline transportation cost by drawing experience from the popular Silk Air and Air Asia operated by Singapore Airlines and Thai Airways. In addition, the government can work with the aviation industry to establish a reliable flight-demand forecasting system to plan tourism demand from the Korean mainland. Operationally, tour price for Jeju is obviously higher than those offered by the other competing Asian destinations. Tourism industry in Jeju needs to emphasize the value and experience for the visit. Furthermore, the private sector participants should develop better coordination among travel agencies, airline companies, hoteliers and local merchants to price tour products competitively.More specifically, travel agencies and airline companies should offer various travel package plans which are already well-developed for the overseas visitors to the Korean mainland outbound tourists. Though there are already package plans such as various honeymoon packages, school excursion, and Gold package, for Jeju visitors, these plans are not sophisticated to meet the varied domestic tourism demand. With the development of more affordable group package plans, the price can be competitively determined and Jeju can stay competitive for attracting both international and domestic tourists.Fig. 7.
