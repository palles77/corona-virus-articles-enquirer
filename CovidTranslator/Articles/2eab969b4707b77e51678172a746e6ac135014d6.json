            "text": "Aminopeptidase N (EC 3.4.11.2) belongs to clan MA and family M1, which contain one zinc ion per molecule. The enzyme is well conserved in a variety of species, such as mammals, insects, plants and bacteria. Aminopeptidase N possesses broad substrate specificity and releases most N-terminal amino-acid residues. Together with certain endopeptidases, aminopeptidase N plays a predominant role in peptide degradation for utilizing amino acids as nutrients. Additionally, aminopeptidase N is known to possess significant physiological functions as a receptor without employing its enzymatic activity. For instance, human aminopeptidase N, which has been identified as a CD13 antigen, acts as a receptor for coronaviruses such as the transmissible gastroenteritis virus and human coronavirus 229E (Delmas et al., 1992; Curtis et al., 1992) , while Bombyx mori aminopeptidase N serves as a receptor of Bacillus thuringensis Cry1Aa toxin (Yaoi et al., 1997) . The Escherichia coli aminopeptidase N shares 13.6 and 13.4% sequence identity with its human and B. mori homologues and is an enzyme with a molecular weight of 99 kDa whose N-terminal order of preference is for Arg, Lys and Ala. The enzyme shows some activity for an N-terminal Pro residue, although the reaction is rather slow. This enzyme was first purified from E. coli K-12 in 1982 and its catalytic properties were assessed using Ala-p-nitroanilide as a substrate (McCaman & Villarejo, 1982) . The enzyme was reported to be a monomeric acidic protein containing at least one sulfhydryl group, essential for catalytic activity, which was readily inhibited by p-chloromercuribenzoate. Subsequently, the activity was also found to be inhibited by o-phenanthroline, puromycin, bestatin and amastatin. It has been also shown that the enzyme has aryl amidase and peptidase activities similar to those of aminopeptidase M from mammalian tissues (Yoshimoto et al., 1988) . The nucleotide sequence of the pepN gene encoding aminopeptidase N of E. coli was sequenced and an open reading frame coding for a protein of 870 amino-acid residues was identified (Foglino et al., 1986) . The aminopeptidase N contains a His297-Glu298-Xaa-Xaa-His301-(where Xaa is any amino-acid residue) sequence motif, which is a signature of a zinc-binding region. Despite the length of time since the discovery of aminopeptidase N, its three-dimensional structure has not yet been determined.",

We tried to solve a phase problem by the single isomorphous replacement method, but the phasing power was insufficient to determine the structure. We plan to solve the crystal structure using the multiwavelength anomalous dispersion method with a synchrotronradiation source or using the multiple isomorphous replacement method together with other heavy-atom derivatives.",
