Macrophages are one of the critical cells linking the innate and adaptive immune system, and it has been shown that MSCs can differentiate between pro-inflammatory M1 phenotype and anti-inflammatory M2 phenotype of macrophages. However, it has not yet been fully clarified whether these differentiated macrophages are functional. In this study, we compared the immunomodulatory effects on the CD4 T cells of M1, M2a and M2c macrophages with the macrophages that directly and indirectly cultured with MSCs. We analyzed the changes in CD14, CD64, CD80, CD163 and CD200R expression to evaluate macrophage phenotypes, and the changes in CD4, IFN-g, IL-4, IL-17a and FoxP3 expression to evaluate T helper subsets using the FACS method. The changes in IL-1b, IL-4, IL-10, IL-12p70, IL-17a and IFN-g in the media supernatants were analyzed using the Luminex method. We also performed WST-1 and Caspase-3 ELISA analyses to observe the proliferation and apoptosis status of the T cells. MSCs were found to differentiate macrophages into a distinctive phenotype, which was close to the M2c phenotype, but was not considered as an M2c cell due to the low expression of CD163, a characteristic marker for M2c. While MEM-D, MEM-ID and MSCs showed similar inhibitory effects on the Th2 and Th17 cells, the most significant increase in Treg cell frequencies was seen in MEM-D cells. Macrophages can alter their phenotypes and functions according to the stimuli from the environment. The fact that macrophages educated with MSCs suppressed the production of all the cytokines we evaluated even after the removal of MSCs suggests that these cells may be differentiated by MSCs into a suppressive macrophage subgroup. However, the Treg cell activation caused by direct interactions between MSCs and macrophage cells may be the most prominent observation of this study compared to previous work. As a result, according to our data, the interactions between MSCs and macrophages may lead to differentiation of macrophage cells into an immunosuppressive phenotype, and these macrophages may suppress the T lymphocyte subgroups at least as effectively as MSCs. However, our data obtained from in vitro experiments should be supported by future in vivo studies.",

            "text": "Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are adult stem cells that can be isolated from many tissues, and they have different types, such as chondrocyte, adipocyte or osteocyte (El, 2011) . MSCs also have strong immunomodulation abilities; e.g., they suppress immune cells through the secretion of cytokines, such as prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), indoleamine 2,3 dioxygenase (IDO), hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), and soluble human leukocyte antigen G (sHLA-G) and transform growth factor beta (TGF-b) and interleukin 10 (IL-10) (Budoni et al., 2013; \u00d6zdemir et al., 2016) . Due to these unique properties, MSCs are clinically used in the treatment of graft versus host disease (GVHD) caused by uncontrolled activation of immune cells (Sangiorgi and Panepucci, 2016) and certain autoimmune diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis (RA), Crohn's disease, and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) (Dazzi and Krampera, 2011) . However, the clinical responses of patients to MSC treatment are variable, ranging from good responses to only temporary or no effect (Mastri et al., 2014; Silva et al., 2018) . The immunomodulatory effects of MSCs occur in a non-specific and nonselective manner. When MSCs are activated, they produce certain cytokines, such as PGE2, IDO, HGF, TGF-b and IL-10, which suppress almost all immune cells (El, 2011; \u00d6zdemir et al., 2016; Cho et al., 2014) . However, this suppressive effect only lasts for the lifespan of MSCs. In both pathogen-related infections and autoimmune pathologies, antigen presentation is a crucial step for T cell activation and lineage specific differentiation. During T cell activation, antigen-specific memory cells are formed, resulting in a life-long response (Berard and Tough, 2002; Gray et al., 1991) . To gain a sustainable immune response, T cells should be activated or inhibited by antigen-presenting cells. MSCs are not antigen-presenting cells, and under normal conditions, their major histocompatibility antigen expressions (MHC) are either weak or absent (Dominici et al., 2006; Shi et al., 2018) .",

            "text": "Macrophages are a part of innate immunity, and they play important roles in the antigen presentation and the regulation of immune response. According to the exposed type of cytokine and antigen, macrophages can alter their phenotype and function. It has been shown that IFN-g, LPS and TNF-a stimulation leads to the upregulation of MHC-II, CD80 and CD64 expressions of the cell surface and an increase in iNOS, IL-1b, IL-12 and IL-6 production of macrophages. This type of macrophages is called M1, which activate Th1 immune cells important to the immune response of intracellular pathogens and tumor resistance (Ambarus et al., 2012; Martinez and Gordon, 2014) . Another macrophage group, called M2 macrophages, antagonize the effects of M1 macrophages. M2 macrophages are further divided into the subgroups of M2a, M2b and M2c according to cytokine and antigen stimulation. IL-4 stimulation is specific to the development of the M2a macrophage phenotype. Through IL-4 stimulation, the cell surface expressions of CD200R and CD206 increase but CD14 decreases. Furthermore, the production of Arginase and IL-10 increases (Ambarus et al., 2012; Van Dyken and Locksley, 2013) . M2a macrophages are important for the activation of Th2 cells responsible for immune responses, including encapsulation of parasites and allergy (Martinez and Gordon, 2014; Martinez et al., 2009) . For the emergence of the M2b phenotype, immune complexes and TLR stimulation are required. An appropriate stimulation would increase the IL-10 production of M2b cells but decrease IL-12 production (Anderson and Mosser, 2002; Sironi et al., 2006) . M2c is another subset of M2 macrophages, which are activated by IL-10 stimulation. An increase in the CD163 and CD16 expressions and upregulation of IL-10 and TGF-b production caused by IL-10 stimuli, are specific to the M2c phenotype (Ambarus et al., 2012; Schwarz et al., 2013) .",

However, it has not been yet fully clarified whether these differentiated macrophages are functional. As a professional antigen-presenting cell, te macrophages can help to transfer the immunomodulation effects of MSCs to the adaptive immune cells. In this study, we aimed to investigate the interactions of macrophage and MSCs, and the resulting effects of these interactions on CD4 T cells. For this purpose, we differentiated the macrophage cells into M1, M2a and M2c phenotypes to observe the effects on CD4 T cells with known macrophage phenotypes. In addition, we generated MSC-educated macrophage (MEM) cells by direct and indirect co-culture and compared their effects on CD4 T cells with known macrophage phenotypes.",

            "text": "In this study, we evaluated macrophage polarizations by identifying several distinctive markers for M1, M2a and M2c macrophage phenotypes (Fig. 3) . One of the markers evaluated was CD14, which is a specific marker of monocytes with reduced expression during macrophage maturation (Ambarus et al., 2012) . It is well known that MSCs are IL-10-producing cells (Ma et al., 2016; Qu et al., 2012) , and it has been shown that their maturation can be prevented by IL-10 (Schwarz et al., 2013; Allavena et al., 1998) . We observed that the CD14 expressions of the MEM-D and MEM-ID groups showed a similar pattern to the M2c group, suggesting that MSCs can differentiate macrophage cells into the M2c-like phenotype through direct or indirect effects. CD64 is a member of the Fc\u03b3 family and plays a role in antibodymediated phagocytosis. It has been reported that CD64 expression in monocytes and macrophages increases in response to IFN-g and LPS stimulation but decreases with IL-4 stimulation (Hristodorov et al., 2015) . In another study, Ji et al. showed that the CD64 expression of macrophages increased by M-CSF and IL-10 stimulation (Ji et al., 2004) . For CD64, our findings were similar to the literature in that the CD64 expression of macrophages increased in the M1 and M2c group but decreased in the M2a group. Additionally, the CD64 expressions of the MEM-D and MEM-ID macrophages were similar to those of the M1 and M2c macrophages. As in the case of CD14 expressions, this finding supports the idea MSCs may alter macrophages into the M2c-like phenotype. CD80 is a molecule involved in the full activation of T cells by interacting with the CD28 co-stimulatory molecule of T cells during antigen presentation (Freeman et al., 1992) . Jiang et al. reported that the CD80 expressions of LPS-stimulated macrophages were suppressed by MSCs; however, Spaggiari et al. reported no change (Jiang et al., 2005; Spaggiari et al., 2009) . In our experiments, we observed that the CD80 expressions of the MEM-D group were significantly higher compared to the other groups, except M2c. As shown in Fig. 4 , clusters where T cells interacted, indicating antigen presentation were more common in the MEM-D group than in the other groups. These observations suggest that the co-stimulatory properties of macrophages could be increased by the presence of MSCs.",

In this respect, CD163 is a sensitive marker for M2c macrophages, and we found that the CD163 expressions of the M2c macrophages significantly increased compared to the other groups. Based on CD14 and CD64 expressions observed, we assumed that IL-10 produced by MSCs might differentiate macrophages into the M2c-like phenotype. However, the absence of a CD163 increase in the MEM-D and MEM-ID groups did not support this assumption. Finally, we found that CD200R, a specific MSCs (g). The microscopic images of activated PBMCs (h) and unstimulated PBMCs (i). The activated T cells (orange colored) have accumulated on the surface of macrophage cells, however these accumulations were detected as more dense at M2a and MEM-D co-culture groups compared with the US-M, M1 and M2c co-culture groups. marker for M2a cells, decreased in M1 macrophages and increased in M2a macrophages, which is consistent with the literature. We also observed that similar to CD163, the CD200R expressions of the MEM-D and MEM-ID macrophages were not altered compared to US-M. Not only IL-10, IL-4 and TGF-b, but also various immunosuppressive molecules, such as IDO, HGF, and PGE2 are known to be involved in the formation of immunomodulation effects of MSCs (Chen et al., 2011) . Therefore, macrophages cultured with MSCs are likely to be of a different phenotype than known phenotypes, which is also partially supported by our findings. We used limited and specific markers to evaluate the macrophage phenotypes; therefore, based on limited data, we were not able to make a definitive conclusion concerning the phenotype to which the macrophages cultured with MSCs were closest.",

In terms of macrophages, M1 macrophages stimulate the differentiation of naive T cells into the Th1 phenotype. In contrast, M2 macrophages stimulate Th2 and/or Treg cell differentiation and suppress Th1 differentiation (Martinez and Gordon, 2014; Charles A Janeway et al., 2001; Mills et al., 2000) . Previous research also reported that MSCs suppressed the Th1 response and stimulated Treg cells (Chen et al., 2011; Luz-Crawford et al., 2013) . According to our findings, the CD4 + IFNg + (Th1) frequencies of all groups were similar, except the US-PBMC group. However, there were dramatic and significant decreases in the IFN-g levels of the M2c, MEM-D, MEM-ID and MSC groups. This finding suggests that the CD4 + IFNg + cell frequencies may not be affected by different macrophage phenotypes, but their functions can be suppressed by M2c, MEM and MSC cells.",

The main cytokines of Th2 cells are IL-4, IL-5, IL-13, and IL-10 (Deo et al., 2010; Steinke and Borish, 2001) . The presence of a synergistic interaction between the Th2 cells and M2 macrophages has previously been reported (Muraille et al., 2014) . Our data confirmed that IL-4 stimulated macrophages (M2a) could significantly stimulate Th2 frequencies and IL-4 production. However, although the Th2 frequencies of the groups except M2a were close to each other, the IL-4 levels of the US-M and MEM-ID groups were significantly lower than those of the other groups. In the current literature, different results have been reported about MSC and Th2 interactions. Mareschi et al. found that amniotic fluid MSCs and placenta MSCs could stimulate the IL-4 expressions of activated PBMCs, but not in bone marrow MSCs (Mareschi et al., 2015) . \u00d6zdemir et al. and Gen\u00e7 et al. showed that dental tissue MSCs could suppress the IL-4 expressions of T cells (\u00d6zdemir et al., 2016; Gen\u00e7 et al., 2018) . In our experiments, we used adipose tissue MSCs and observed that the IL-4 levels significantly increased in the MSC and MEM-D groups compared with the MEM-ID and US-PBMC groups.

            "text": "Th17 cells have been reported to play a role in the pathogenesis of many autoimmune diseases; e.g., RA, SLE and Crohn's disease (Tabarkiewicz et al., 2015) . As opposed to Th1 and Th2 cells that are terminally differentiated, Th17 cells can alter their phenotype in response to signals from the environment. For example, Bofeng et al. reported that IL-10 induced macrophages contributed to the pathogenesis of colitis by increasing Th17 activity (Li et al., 2015a) . Haribhai et al. showed that TGF-b-producing M2a macrophages differentiated Th17 cells into anti-inflammatory iTreg cells (Haribhai et al., 2016) . For MSCs and Th17 interactions, Qu et al. reported that Th17 cells were suppressed by IL-10 secreted by MSCs (Qu et al., 2012) , Rozenberg et al. showed that PGE2 secreted from MSCs increased the Th17 response but suppressed the Th1 response (Rozenberg et al., 2016) , and Ghannam et al. noted that MSCs increased Treg cells by suppressing Th17 cells (Ghannam et al., 2010) . Our findings revealed that the Th17 frequencies of the A-PBMC group was significantly higher than those of the remaining groups, except M1 and M2c. The IL-17a levels and Th17 frequencies of the M1 and M2c groups were consistent, but IL-17a remained high in the MSC group (Fig. 7) . According to our data, IL-10 induced macrophages may be important for stimulating both Th17 cell frequency and IL-17a production. However, even if there is no effect on Th17 frequencies, direct or indirect interaction of macrophages with MSCs may have a negative effect on IL-17a production.",

Activation of FoxP3, a specific transcription factor of these cells, leads to the secretion of suppressive cytokines, such as IL-10 and TGF-b (Li et al., 2015b) . A co-inhibitor molecule CTLA-4 is highly expressed on Treg cells and interacts with CD80/CD86 molecules, leading to the secretion of IDO from antigen-presenting cells (Oderup et al., 2006) . 6 .

There are significant differences (p < 0.05) between the \"a\" and the rhombus symbols, \"b\" and the square symbols, \"c\" and the star symbols. Schmidt et al. reported that M2 macrophages stabilized the FoxP3 expression of CD4 T cells, and in this way, led to a decrease in IFN-g and IL-17 production (Schmidt et al., 2016) . Similar to M2 macrophages, MSCs have a positive effect on the activation of Treg cells. Gazdic et al. showed that the interaction between MSCs and Treg cells played an important role in improving acute liver injury in mouse models (Gazdic et al., 2018) . Ozdemir et al. suggested that dental pulp MSCs increased the Treg cell ratio, probably due to the phenotypic shift of Th17 cells to Treg cells (\u00d6zdemir et al., 2016) . In our study, the Treg cell frequencies were significantly higher in the MEM-D group than in the other groups. However, the IL-10 levels of the MEM-D group were significantly lower compared to the other groups, except the MSC group. We reviewed the literature to interpret this finding and found studies showing that over-activated Th1, Th2 and even Th17 cells could produce IL-10 to manage this activation (Maynard and Weaver, 2008; O'Garra and Vieira, 2007; Ye et al., 2007) . It has been reported that the Borrelia burgdorferi and Toxoplasma gondii infections lead to an increase in IFNg + IL-10 + cells (O'Garra and Vieira, 2007) . Another interesting study reported that over-activated virus-specific CD8 + T cells could produce IL-10 in coronavirus infection, and these cells were shown to produce higher levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and cytotoxic proteins than other cells (Maynard and Weaver, 2008) . If we try to interpret our data according to the information in the literature, the direct interaction of MSCs and macrophage cells may increase the frequency of Treg cells even more than the other macrophage phenotypes, and even MSCs themselves. Furthermore, overactivation of T cells may be the cause of elevated IL- Fig. 7 .

As a result, MEM-D, MEM-ID and MSCs may have led to a decrease in IL-10 production due to their potent inhibitory effects on T cell activation. Netea et al. and Quintin et al. reported that macrophages could develop a memory by being educated against a situation they had previously encountered (Netea, 2013; Quintin et al., 2014) . Interestingly, we observed that the MEM-ID cells had similar effects on the Th1, Th2, Th17, and Treg cell frequencies as MEM-D cells. Besides, these effects were similar for the IFN-g, IL-10 and IL-17a levels. This suggests that macrophage and MSC interactions may cause a kind of memory formation in macrophage cells. In addition, this memory appears to develop in a suppressive direction for all T cell cytokine responses.",

It is known that M2 macrophages can suppress T cell proliferation via secretion of NO and IDO or surface molecule PD-L2 (Bingisser et al., 1998; Huber et al., 2010; Munn et al., 1999) . MSCs can also effectively suppress T cell proliferation via cytokines, such as IDO, PGE2, IL-10, and TGF-b (Chen et al., 2011) . According to our findings, consistent with the literature, the proliferation rates of all co-culture groups, except M1 macrophages, were significantly lower than those of the A-PBMC group, and the proliferation rates of the M1 and M2a group were significantly higher compared to the MSC group. These data suggest that macrophages may not be as effective as MSCs in suppressing T cell proliferation. It is also known that macrophages can lead to over-activated T cell apoptosis by secretion of NO and by Fas/FasL mechanism in acute bacterial infections or IFN-g and LPS stimulation (Daigneault et al., 2012; Hortelano et al., 2000) . However, MSCs do not cause lymphocyte apoptosis while suppressing proliferation (Haddad and Saldanha-Araujo, 2014; Xu et al., 2007) . We observed that the Caspase-3 levels were significantly higher in M1 macrophages than in the MEM-ID, MSC and US-PBMC groups, confirming that MSCs can successfully suppress T cell proliferation, but does not lead to apoptosis.",

Although this phenotype was closer to the M2c phenotype, it cannot be considered a M2c cell due to the low expression of CD163, which is the characteristic marker of M2c. While MEM-D, MEM-ID, and MSCs had similar inhibitory effects on Th2 and Th17 cells, the most significant increase in Treg cell frequencies was seen in MEM-D cells. Macrophages can alter their phenotypes and functions according to the stimuli from the environment. The fact that macrophages educated with MSCs suppressed the production of all the cytokines evaluated even after the removal of MSCs suggests that these cells may be differentiated by MSCs into a suppressive macrophage subgroup. However, Treg cell activation caused by direct interactions between MSC and macrophage cells may be the most prominent observation of this study. In conclusion, according to our data, interactions of MSCs and macrophages may lead to differentiate macrophage cells into an immunosuppressive phenotype, and these macrophages may suppress T lymphocyte subgroups at least as effectively as MSCs. However, considering that we obtained our data from in vitro experiments, our findings should be supported by future in vivo studies.",
