The best transmission was when the difference between the highest and lowest transmission value was about 80 and was chosen for further analysis. Later on, the sample tablet was put into the temperature-controlled pool and the FTIR spectra were SP4 C4 recorded in situ. These results were interpreted for 2DIR correlation spectroscopy.

Both the spectra showed two strong peaks at 2925 cm \u00c01 and 2854 cm \u00c01 respectively which were assigned to methylene (CH 2 ) in their asymmetric and symmetric stretch vibration absorption for alkaloids, steroids and triterpenoids plant content [15] . Most of the peaks bound together and overlaid but the characteristic peaks were clearly visible in the range of 1800 cm \u00c01 to 500 cm \u00c01 . Hence, the interpretation have to be based on raw material. There are 5 major peaks with two strong peaks achieving absorbance >0.3 and accompanied by a few peaks which could be combined. The peak at 1745 cm \u00c01 on both spectra exhibited similar intensity for the content of aldehydes, ketones and carbonyl stretching vibration.

The overall picture showed peaks in the spectrum of SP4 were sharper in the two highlighted zones, especially the peak at 1747 cm \u00c01 which showed stronger than that at 1745 cm \u00c01 of C4 in intensity. The region around 1500 cm \u00c01 had double peaks at around 1544 cm \u00c01 in C4 but a single peak at 1537 cm \u00c01 in SP4. This scenario occurred oppositely for the single peak at 1512 cm \u00c01 in C4 and double peaks around 1516 cm \u00c01 in SP4. Fig. 6 . Synchronous 2D-FTIR correlation spectra of SP4 and C4 in the region of 1400-800 cm \u00c01 . Fig. 3 continued the description on the second derivative in the range of 1200-800 cm \u00c01 which consequently played the crucial role of the fingerprint of these samples. The figure was conveniently divided into 3 regions for discussion. First region was observed the peak at 1188 cm \u00c01 in SP4 which disappeared in C4. The peak at 1166 cm \u00c01 in SP4 might be assigned similar absorption with the peak at 1162 cm \u00c01 in C4. The similarity of this region in these two spectra also included derivative in the peak at 1108 cm \u00c01 ; peaks at 1105 cm \u00c01 and 1079 cm \u00c01 of C4 was derived from the peak at 1108 cm \u00c01 in the first derivative spectrum. Both were separated by 26 cm \u00c01 . However, peaks at 1111 cm \u00c01 and 1076 cm \u00c01 in SP4 were separated by 35 cm \u00c01 . SP4 showed different pattern of derivative to C4. As mentioned earlier, the absorption in the range of 1200-1020 cm \u00c01 is attributed for organic anhydrides, ethers and sugars. A report for determination of salylic acid, syringic acid, benzoic acid and anthranilic acid in Radix Isatidis by Wang et al. [16] showed a similar evidence. The derivative from the peaks from 1057 cm \u00c01 to 984 cm \u00c01 in C4 showed slight changes and the peak at 984 cm \u00c01 obviously sharper in SP4. Most of the peaks in the third region of C4 were not as sharp as in those of SP4. Fig. 4 showed the second derivative spectra in the range of 800-400 cm \u00c01 . The lower wavenumber of this range below 500 cm \u00c01 showed fewer big and sharp peaks due to the possibility of noise. The region focused on around 600 cm \u00c01 as the huge peak was specifically located in this region on 1D spectra. The small peaks in the highlighted area could be differentiated by the pattern of absorption in C4 and they are considered constantly low and steady. While in SP4, the scenario changed as the peaks fluctuated. However, most of the peaks showed weak intensity. The peak at 666 cm \u00c01 in SP4 was about twice as high as that at 667 cm \u00c01 in C4. Nakanishi and Solomon [17] reported that the wavelength of absorption in the 700-600 cm \u00c01 referred to the bending of CAH where its overtone may appear around 1250 cm \u00c01 . Compared with 1256 cm \u00c01 in the spectrum of C4 and SP4, diagnostic value is limited.",

The auto-peak spectrum showed the actual sharpness of the peaks. Both peaks were referred to amide I (1650 cm \u00c01 ) and amide II (1550 cm \u00c01 ) and the stronger signal of 2DIR in SP4 indicated the protein content of the seed was changed after spaceflight. Auto peaks at 1495 and 1550 cm \u00c01 in SP4 were sharper than those in C4. The double peaks of SP4 achieved different level as the peak close to 1700 cm \u00c01 was lower. Even the double peaks in C4 were not the same level but the peak close to 1700 cm \u00c01 was slightly higher. The crystal-liked illustration of the 3D-IR spectrum C4 clearly showed different level of absorption. The red spot on the top was the specific scope which is smaller in SP4. The four different direction corners of SP4 contained peaks with similar height and bigger than those of C4.

The main and higher peaks disseminated to four corners which were separated to two clusters and the highest auto peak was located in the upper right of both spectra. Therefore the main differences of both spectra was the correlation square formed by auto peak at 950 cm \u00c01 , crosspeak (950, 1250), auto peak at 1250 cm \u00c01 and crosspeak (1250, 950). By comparison, the intensity of spectrum SP4 of the four main peaks was moderate. Fig. 6 enhanced the comparison which showed that the auto peak from 820 to 1100 cm \u00c01 in C4 was about one time higher than that in SP4. The scenario contradicted with a auto peak at 1200 cm \u00c01 in SP4 which was slightly higher than that in C4. Both spectra in the 3D-FTIR obviously enhanced the performance of differences especially within this range of wave length. The four auto peaks in red top shape pointed four directions in C4 but only a single auto peak with red top shape in SP4.

Under the 1D FTIR spectra, the sample SP4 spectrum has similar absorption IR peaks with that of C4. The second derivative revealed the differences of two spectra. In the range of 1800-1200 cm \u00c01 , the peaks of spectrum C4 was stronger and sharper than that of SP4. The 2DIR spectra of two samples were comparable in the range of 1800-1400 cm \u00c01 . Amide II absorption of SP4 was not preserved as that of C4, but its lower intensity indicated that mutation caused by spaceflight affected the protein structure of the plant and was stable after cultivation with a few generations. Second derivative spectra in the range of 1200-800 cm \u00c01 showed different spectra of two samples. The 2DIR spectrum in the range of 1400-800 cm \u00c01 of C4 was stronger than that of SP4 in the main correlation square. Albeit the range of 800-400 cm \u00c01 of second derivative showed the C4 spectrum contained sharper peaks than that of SP4. 2DIR correlation spectroscopy enhanced and confirmed that there are limited changes between SP4 and C4. In conclusion, spaceflight provided an extreme condition that caused chemical changes in I. indigotica and the changes could be determined with FTIR and 2DIR correlation spectroscopy even after cultivation with several generations.",
