Two free boundaries are introduced to describe the spreading frontiers of the avian influenza. The basic reproduction numbers r F 0 (t) and R F 0 (t) are defined for the bird with the avian influenza and for the human with the mutant avian influenza of the free boundary problem, respectively. Properties of these two time-dependent basic reproduction numbers are obtained. Sufficient conditions both for spreading and for vanishing of the avian influenza are given. It is shown that if r F 0 (0) < 1 and the initial number of the infected birds is small, the avian influenza vanishes in the bird world. Furthermore, if r F 0 (0) < 1 and R F 0 (0) < 1, the avian influenza vanishes in the bird and human worlds. In the case that r F 0 (0) < 1 and R F 0 (0) > 1, spreading of the mutant avian influenza in the human world is possible. It is also shown that if r F 0 (t 0 ) 1 for any t 0 0, the avian influenza spreads in the bird world.",

To explore the pattern of the plague in London and the pest in Mumbai, Kermack and McKendrick constructed the well-known SIR compartment model in 1927 (see [9] ), and the SIS compartment model [10] was introduced by them in 1932. The readers can see some related work in [15] . To understand the epidemiology of some infectious diseases, other compartment models were formulated, for example, the SI compartment model [19] , which is constructed by the assumption that the individual cannot recover from the disease. This model is appropriate for the diseases such as herpes and HIV. If the individual first goes through a exposed period before becoming to the infectious, this can be described by the SEI compartment model (see [27] for example). The SIRS compartment model [20] supposes that the recovered individual has the temporary immunity.",

Today the WHO (World Health Organization) claims that the infectious diseases are still hostile in the human world. From now on, people should be cautious about the diseases and scientists should contribute themselves to eradicate epidemic diseases. Recently, great attention has been paid to study the contagious diseases. In early 20th century, mathematical models have been constructed to study the dynamics of H(t) = \u03b2 2 SH + \u03b5B \u2212 (\u03bc + \u03b1 + \u03b3)H, R(t) = \u03b3H \u2212 \u03bcR, (1.1) where the first two equations form the SI model, which describes the bird system, no recovered bird exists since the highly pathogenic viruses have high death rates. X and Y are the population of the susceptible birds and the infective birds, respectively. The last four equations are SIR model for humans, S, B, H and R denote, respectively, the population of the susceptible humans, infected with avian influenza, infected with mutant avian influenza and recovered humans from mutant avian influenza.

They concluded that the diseasefree equilibrium E 0 := (c/b, 0, \u03bb/\u03bc, 0, 0, 0) is locally asymptotically stable if r 0 < 1 and R 0 < 1; and human-endemic equilibrium E h is locally asymptotically stable if r 0 < 1 and R 0 > 1; while r 0 > 1 the full-endemic equilibrium E + is locally asymptotically stable. Furthermore, they proved the disease-free equilibrium E 0 is globally asymptotically stable when r 0 < 1 and R 0 < 1. It is known that the solution to System (1.2) with Dirichlet or Neumann boundary condition in a bounded domain is always positive for any time t > 0 no matter what the nonnegative nontrivial initial date is. It means that the avian influenza spreads to the whole area immediately even when the infectious is confined to a small part of the area at the beginning. It does not match the observed fact that the avian influenza always spreads gradually. To describe the gradual progress of avian influenza spreading, we are attempting to consider an avian-human influenza model with free boundaries, which describe the spreading frontiers of the virus. In the next section, a mathematical model of the free boundary in both the bird world and the human world is constructed first.",

The following result shows that if R F 0 (0) is big, the mutant avian influenza will spread in the human world.Proof.Let B i and \u03c3(t) be the same as those in Theorem 5.7, and H a (x, t) is defined in Theorem 5.9. Let where \u03c6(x) > 0 and \u03bb R0 \u2212M satisfy (4.4) on \u03a9 = (\u2212h 0 , h 0 ). Without loss of generality, assume that H m0 (x) > 0 and H r0 (x) > 0 for x \u2208 (\u2212h 0 , h 0 ), otherwise we replace the initial time 0 by any t 0 > 0. Therefore, there exists \u03b4 m > 0 such thatDirect calculations give thatAccording to Theorems 5.7 and 5.9, we haveNow, we can chose \u03b4 m and \u03b5 small enough such thatOn the other hand,Moreover,Considering the initial values, if \u03b4 m is sufficiently small, then we have Combining the above results with Theorems 5.7 and 5.9, and applying Lemma 5.8 yield thatfor (x, t) \u2208 (g(t), h(t)) \u00d7 (0, \u221e), andHence, we can get the conclusion thatTherefore, h \u221e \u2212 g \u221e < \u221e by Theorem 5.7.",

Moreover, Noting that \u03b4 1 is small such thatby using Lemma 5.6. Thus lim inf t\u2192+\u221e B i (\u00b7, t) C([\u2212h0,h0]) \u03b4 1 \u03d5(x) > 0 and it follows from Corollary 5.The other case r F 0 (0) = 1 can follow from the above. In fact, for any T 0 > 0, we have g(T 0 ) < \u2212h 0 and h(T 0 ) > h 0 by Lemma 3.2. From Lemma 4.3(iv), we get r F 0 ((g(T 0 ), h(T 0 ))) > r F 0 (0) = 1.
