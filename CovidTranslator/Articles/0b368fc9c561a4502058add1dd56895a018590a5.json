The goals of this article are to 1) discuss the role of the modern autopsy in ascertaining cause of death and advancing understanding of the pathogenesis of infectious diseases, 2) identify major clinical syndromes and the appropriate laboratory methods for detecting etiologic agent(s), 3) review the status of microbiologic cultures in the performance of the modern autopsy, 4) discuss the role and potential limitations of molecular pathology in today's autopsy, 5) review methods for protecting personnel in completion of the autopsy, and 6) discuss the role of the pathologist in community/national response to potential acts of bioterrorism.",

Certain infectious diseases progress so rapidly, so as to be initially considered a sudden death. However, even the most fulminant infectious diseases produce symptoms that precede death and are not instantaneous. Discussions with her roommates confirmed she had complained of respiratory symptoms and severe headache the morning of her death. At autopsy, there was gross evidence of purulent meningitis and culture yielded Neisseria meningitidis. This case highlights the changing epidemiology of meningitis, which includes an increase in cases in college students (3, 4) . Whereas standard cultures were diagnostic in this case, rapid diagnostic techniques, such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) may expedite diagnosis and facilitate early public health interventions (5) .",

Although most cases of bacterial meningitis are due to hematogenous spread, search for a contiguous focus of disease (otitis media, sinusitis) is important in deciphering the pathogenesis of disease. Many infections have distinct seasonal and geographic predilections, which further narrows the differential diagnosis. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), meninges, and CNS parenchyma may be obtained for bacterial, viral, and fungal cultures. Certain organisms such as rickettsia cannot be cultured but may show histological changes that can be evaluated further with IHC or molecular methods.

The list of potential pathogens, however, expands if the patient is neutropenic, asplenic, or suffers from other predisposing conditions, including congenital or acquired immunodeficiency states. Although bacteremic sepsis is most common, sepsis may complicate infections with viruses, rickettsia, fungi, mycobacteria, and parasites. Approaching these cases with a broad differential diagnosis and purposeful tissue sampling is important in delineating the causative agent.",

Although many infections may present with fever and rash, those most likely to lead abruptly to death include meningococcemia, rickettsial infections, and toxic shock syndrome. When evaluating the rash, it is important to note 1) characteristics of the lesions, 2) distribution of the rash, 3) presence of petechiae, and 4) timing and progression of the rash relative to fever and death. Meningococcemia characteristically produces petechial lesions on the trunk, extremities, and mucous membranes. Rocky Mountain spotted fever, a prototypical rickettsial infection, starts as a maculopapular rash that spreads centripetally and evolves eventually to petechiae. Toxic shock syndrome (TSS) produces a sunburn-type rash that desquamates usually after 1-2 weeks. Whereas blood cultures may yield the causative agent in meningococcemia, cultures would be negative in rickettsial infections. A skin biopsy, however, may allow the pathologist to identify the organisms using immunohistochemical stains of formal-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue. In cases of suspected TSS, vaginal and wound cultures may be useful in elucidating the reservoir of bacteria. In a report on the autopsy of a 15-year-old girl with tampon-related TSS, Blair and colleagues demonstrated extensive superficial ulcerations and thrombophlebitis of the vagina, with bacteria on the mucosal surface only (29) .",

Polymicrobial infections contain a mixture of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, sometimes numbering up to 15 different organisms. According to Gorbach, polymicrobial infections should be considered in four settings: 1) following surgical procedures, 2) infection proceeding from a decubitus ulcer or perianal abscess, 3) in intravenous drug users, and 4) spread from a Bartholin's abscess or minor vulvovaginal infection (44) . The premortem diagnosis of a deep skin and soft tissue relies on a constellation of findings that include bullous lesions, gas in the soft tissues, and devitalization of fascial planes, all of which may be confused with postmortem degradation or decomposition. A high index of suspicion for the presence of a necrotizing soft tissue infection must be maintained. Appropriate cultures and full-thickness biopsies should be taken.",

Even if all organs are grossly unremarkable, cultures of blood and spleen should be taken. If the patient was immunocompromised, viral, mycobacterial, and fungal cultures may be needed in addition to standard bacteriology cultures. They offer the following recommendations for obtaining cultures at necropsy: 1) after making the initial incision, visually inspect the cavities for fluid collection and culture them before additional manipulation and culture organs that are clinically suspected of harboring infection; 2) dry the area to be cultured by searing with a hot steel spatula; 3) for tissue cultures, remove 1-cm 3 portion of tissue with sterile instruments and place in a properly labeled, sterile Petri dish; 4) aspirate blood from the right atrium for aerobic and anaerobic blood cultures; 5) aspirate urine directly from the bladder and place in sterile tube; 6) obtain CSF from the lateral ventricle after the skull cap is removed or by cisternal tap through skin; 7) culture abscesses and granulomata from the center and periphery of the lesion; 8) use different sets of sterile instruments for each culture/site; and 9) divide the specimens aseptically for the various laboratories and deliver promptly.",

Although the black coating of the silver stain may distort the morphology of the bacteria, silver impregnation procedures are more sensitive than tissue gram stains especially when only a small number of bacteria are present. After bacteria have been detected, tissue gram stains can be utilized to distinguish between gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.

The central theme in this technique is the binding of an antibody to a corresponding antigen. Immunoenzymatic or immunofluorescence methods are then utilized to visualize the binding of these complexes. This procedure can be utilized on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue. In order to enhance the immunolabeling of viral antigens, tissue sections are often predigested with a proteolytic enzyme in order to free cross-linked antigens. This predigestion step is not usually necessary for bacteria, fungi and protozoans since their antigenicity is not appreciably affected by the fixation and embedding. Thus, IHC can be very helpful in the diagnosis and confirmation of viral diseases, some bacteria, fungi, protozoa and parasites. Many monoclonal antibodies and polyclonal antisera are commercially available. Table 1 lists commercially available antibodies for various infectious agents (60) . The asterisk designates those infectious agents that have been identified by the CDC as potential biologic terrorism agents. In addition, the CDC also has antibodies and antisera to detect Bacillus anthracis, Francisella tularensis and variola virus (61) . Another diagnostic tool, PCR, has proven invaluable in the identification of emerging infections, especially those caused by viruses. The main purpose of PCR is to amplify targeted nucleic acids, either microbial DNA or RNA sequences. Traditional PCR amplifies DNA sequences and a technique known as reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) can be utilized to identify viral RNA sequences. These methods can detect any infectious agent for which even limited DNA and RNA sequence information is know. Although fresh or frozen tissue is preferred, these methods can be performed on fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue. Another advantage of the method is that many samples can be done simultaneously.",

In the case of hantavirus, IHC method using antiserum to hantaviral nucleocapsid antigen was critical in the early understanding of the hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (64) . In the case of West Nile virus, histologic examination of the central nervous system revealed necrosis in the gray matter with infiltrates of microglia and polymorphonuclear leukocytes. These sections were then stained using IHC techniques that utilized an antibody to St. Louis encephalitis virus (SLE), a member of the Flavivirus family. Confirmatory tests using PCR were negative when SLE virus-specific primers were used. In addition, animals not usually associated with SLE outbreaks, such as crows and other birds, were reported to have increased fatalities. One explanation of these differing results was that the antibody used in IHC was known to cross-react with several other members of the Flavivirus serocomplex including SLE, Japanese encephalitis virus and West Nile virus. RT-PCR techniques were then performed utilizing several degenerate primer sets designed to detect a wide variety of flaviviruses.

Autopsies performed for potential investigation of potential bioterrorism should accomplish three goals: 1) establish the disease process and the etiologic agent, 2) determine that the agent of disease is the cause of death, and 3) rule out competing causes of death (61) . A partial list of diagnostic specimens and testing is given in Table 4 . A thorough guidebook for MEs and coroners is available through the CDC website (www. cdc.gov). To accomplish the goals addressed above, the ME should be able to 1) perform complete autopsies with histologic sampling of multiple organs; 2) have access to routine microbiologic testing for organism-specific diagnoses in potential infectious disease deaths; 3) ensure protection from both airborne and bloodborne pathogens for all occupants of the autopsy facility; 4) participate in standardized surveillance for infectious disease mortality; and 5) document death investigative information on standard searchable forms that can be shared with public health authorities (61) .
