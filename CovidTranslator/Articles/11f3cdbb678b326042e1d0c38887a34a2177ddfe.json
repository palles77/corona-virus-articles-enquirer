Methods Twenty cats from 3.3-82 months of age (mean 10.4 months) with various forms of FIP were accepted into a field trial. Fourteen cats presented with wet or dry-to-wet FIP and six cats presented with dry FIP. GC376 was administered subcutaneously every 12 h at a dose of 15 mg/kg. Cats with neurologic signs were excluded from the study. Results Nineteen of 20 cats treated with GC376 regained outward health within 2 weeks of initial treatment. However, disease signs recurred 1-7 weeks after primary treatment and relapses and new cases were ultimately treated for a minimum of 12 weeks. Relapses no longer responsive to treatment occurred in 13 of these 19 cats within 1-7 weeks of initial or repeat treatment(s). Severe neurologic disease occurred in 8/13 cats that failed treatment and five cats had recurrences of abdominal lesions. At the time of writing, seven cats were in disease remission. Five kittens aged 3.3-4.4 months with wet FIP were treated for 12 weeks and have been in disease remission after stopping treatment and at the time of writing for 5-14 months (mean 11.2 months). A sixth kitten was in remission for 10 weeks after 12 weeks of treatment, relapsed and is responding to a second round of GC376. The seventh was a 6.8-year-old cat with only mesenteric lymph node involvement that went into remission after three relapses that required progressively longer repeat treatments over a 10 month period. Side effects of treatment included transient stinging upon injection and occasional foci of subcutaneous fibrosis and hair loss. There was retarded development and abnormal eruption of permanent teeth in cats treated before 16-18 weeks of age. Conclusions and relevance GC376 showed promise in treating cats with certain presentations of FIP and has opened the door to targeted antiviral drug therapy.",

Kim et al synthesized peptidyl compounds that target 3C-like proteases (3CLpro) and evaluated them for their efficacy against feline coronavirus (FCoV) and feline calicivirus, as well as important human RNA viruses that encode 3CLpro or related 3C protease. [3] [4] [5] [6] They identified a series of compounds that showed potent inhibitory activity against various coronaviruses, including FCoV, with a wide margin of safety. The in vivo efficacy of their 3CLpro inhibitors was evaluated in mice infected with murine hepatitis virus A59, a murine coronavirus, and found to cause significant reductions in virus titers and pathologic lesions. 5 There are currently no commercially available antiviral drugs for coronavirus infections in people or animals, and the studies of Kim et al showed that, as a proof of principal, inhibition of 3CLpro can lead to suppression of coronavirus replication in vivo. 4, 5 They suggested that some of their 3CLpro inhibitors may be used as therapeutic agents against these important viruses in domestic and wild cats. This was demonstrated to be the case in a subsequent study using experimental feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) virus (FIPV) infection in laboratory cats. 6 Although experimental FIPV infection is highly fatal once the infection reaches a definable stage, 14-20 days of GC376 treatment caused rapid disease remission in six cats that has lasted over 12 months at the time of writing in the remainder.",

Manual palpation of the abdomen was usually sufficient to identify ascites, enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes, enlargement of the cecum and associated ileo-cecal-colic lymph nodes, masses in the kidneys and colonic infiltration. Manual palpation was augmented, when necessary, by ultrasonography. Eyes were examined initially with directed light for any abnormalities in the retina, precipitates in anterior chamber or on the back of the cornea, and aqueous flare. The presence of ocular disease was confirmed when in question by complete ophthalmoscopic examination conducted by the ophthalmology service of the Veterinary Medical Teaching Hospital (VMTH), UC Davis. The presence of FIPV was further confirmed by qRT-PCR, 6 either from abdominal or thoracic effusions taken at the time of admission or at the time of necropsy. Sequencing of the FIPV protease gene was carried out on cats that relapsed while on therapy, to determine whether potential mutation conferring drug resistance had occurred. 5, 6 The diagnosis of dry-to-wet FIP in three cats (CT03, CT10 and CT14) was based on diffuse enlargement of the colon and histories of loose stools, blood and mucus in the stool, straining to defecate and small-caliber stools prior to occurrence of abdominal effusions. Colonic FIP has been described as a specific variant form of non-effusive FIP. 9 Dry-to-wet FIP was also suspected in cats CT01, CT02 and CT12, owing to a stunting of growth that preceded the appearance of abdominal effusions by many weeks.",

They were closely evaluated at least twice daily for rectal temperature, pulse, respiration, appetite and activity. Clumping litter was used, allowing for daily evaluation of stool volume and consistency, and urination. Whole blood was collected in EDTA or heparin by venepuncture prior to starting treatment, at 2 day intervals while hospitalized, at the time of discharge and at 2 week intervals for the first month and at monthly or greater intervals thereafter. Routine blood testing at each time point included at a minimum a hematocrit, total plasma protein, icterus index, total white blood cell count, differential white blood cell percentages, and absolute neutrophil, lymphocyte, and monocyte and eosinophil counts. Blood serum chemistry values were taken periodically to check for potential drug toxicities. Samples of abdominal effusions were obtained by paracentesis every other day if obtainable, which was usually for the first 3-7 days. Cats presenting with dyspnea were examined by thoracic ultrasonography and a fluid sample obtained by ultrasound-guided paracentesis. Effusions were examined for presence of fibrinous precipitates, an admixture of neutrophils and small/large mononuclear cells, intensity of yellow discoloration, viscosity by threading and total protein content. Cell pellets from peritoneal or thoracic effusions were also examined by qRT-PCR for viral RNA levels as previously described. 6 Cats were discharged to their owners when a positive response to treatment was noted, usually within 5 days. The owner(s) were instructed either by the trial veterinarian or primary-care veterinarian on how to administer the medication twice a day by subcutaneous injection. Injection sites were varied to include the topline from the nape to the mid-back and on the sides of the chest and flanks. Care was taken to avoid depositing drug into the dermis or sequentially at the same subcutaneous site. Owners were encouraged to keep daily logs on rectal temperature, activity, appetite, defecation and urination, and weekly to bi-weekly body weights. Periodic blood samples for CBC and serum chemistry values were obtained by the owners' personal veterinarians and sent to commercial veterinary diagnostic laboratories. Any abnormal signs or behaviors were to be noted and promptly reported. Euthanasia, when required, was conducted either at UC Davis or by the primary-care veterinarian. Bodies of cats euthanized by primary-care veterinarians were immediately refrigerated and sent on ice packs by overnight express mail to UC Davis for necropsy. The owners' request for care and final disposition of the body was honored.",

Despite the favorable initial response, disease signs recurred 1 (CT01, CT05), 2 (CT03, CT04) or 7 (CT02) weeks after the 2 week treatments ended ( Figure  2 ). The cats were then retreated, the rationale being to progressively extend primary and secondary treatment periods for as long as their FIP remained responsive to GC376 (see CT04, CT22, Figure 2 ). New cats that entered the trial were next treated for 3 (CT07) or 4 weeks (CT08, CT16). Cats CT08 and CT16 responded initially, but their disease signs reappeared while on treatment. Cat CT08 developed neurologic disease, whereas cat CT16 had a recurrence of abdominal lesions ( Table 1 ). The primary and secondary treatment periods were then extended to 9 weeks (CT07, CT09, CT10, CT14) ( Figure 2 ). Cat CT09 developed neurologic signs during the 9 week primary treatment and was eventually euthanized when disease signs became severe. Cat CT07 developed neurologic disease 6 weeks after starting the second treatment. At that point, all new cats admitted to the trial, and earlier cats such as CT10, were treated or retreated for at least 12 weeks. The benefit of 12 weeks of treatment was most apparent in cat CT04 that had been treated three other times for shorter periods and then eventually relapsed ( Figure 2 ). Treatment was stopped in cats that had no clinical or laboratory disease signs after 12 weeks of either primary or secondary treatments. It was determined that a minimum treatment period should be around 12 weeks. Cat CT21 was treated for 17 weeks because of delayed improvement in total protein and white blood cell counts ( Figure 2 ).

Renal masses in cats CT02 and CT13 also decreased rapidly in size and were non-palpable after 2 weeks. Enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes were somewhat slower to return to normal size. Palpable thickening of the colon and associated ileo-cecal-colic masses were the slowest to resolve and colonic signs persisted in cat CT03 in the face of treatment and a return to otherwise normal health.

This cat developed severe neurologic signs 3 weeks after starting treatment starting a 4 week treatment regimen (Figures 2 and 8) , whereas the other 12 experienced variable periods of disease remission following primary or secondary treatment lasting from 3-17 weeks (average 7.8 weeks) ( Figure 2 ). All but one (CT09) of these 13 cats was necropsied ( Table 1) . Eight of these cats were euthanized because of severe neurologic signs and five because of recurrences of abdominal disease ( Figure 2 ). Three of the cats that succumbed to neurologic disease (CT05, CT08, CT13) presented because of ocular FIP or ocular involvement was detected secondarily on examination ( Table 1 ). The earliest signs of neurologic disease included fever that persisted in the face of continued treatment, listlessness, sporadic muscle twitches of ears and muscles, abnormal swallowing movements, compulsive stretching of the limbs and loss of normal mentation indicated by brief staring episodes or withdrawal. These signs persisted in the face of treatment for days or weeks, but ultimately progressed to incoordination and tonic/clonic seizures. The appearance and rapid progression of neurologic signs was more apt to occur after discontinuation of treatment than during treatment ( Figure 2 ).",

Experimental disease bypasses the critical early stage that starts as kittens with exposure to an innocuous feline enteric coronavirus (FECV). 12 Naturally occurring FIP results from specific mutants that arise following FECV infection and FIP occurs in the presence of FECV immunity. 13, 14 Experimental FIP, in contrast, is induced in coronavirus na\u00efve cats by an intraperitoneal injection of a large dose of laboratory catpassaged and purified FIPV. Naturally occurring disease is often subclinical for many weeks or months before outward signs of disease are observed, whereas experimental disease signs appear within 2-4 weeks and rapidly progresses. Naturally occurring FIP presents in a variety of clinical forms, whereas the experimental infection is almost always effusive and abdominal. FIP in nature is also affected by a milieu of disease enhancing cofactors, while experimental disease occurs in cats that are free of such extraneous influences. 15 Differences may explain why a small proportion of cats naturally exposed to FIPVs develop disease, whereas 80-100% of experimentally infected cats die. 15, 16 Our predictions proved correct and naturally occurring FIP was much more difficult to treat than the experimental disease. It must be stressed, however, that this trial would not have been approved without the information obtained from pharmacokinetic, acute and chronic toxicity, and efficacy studies conducted on laboratory cats.",

            "text": "This was the first attempt to use a targeted antiviral drug against a systemic and highly fatal disease of veterinary importance. Although no specific antiviral drugs are yet available for coronavirus infections in people or animals, antiviral drugs for other viral infections of people, such as HCV and HIV-1, have been developed for treatment and the use of these drugs provided a sound base for their application to animal diseases such as FIP. HCV mainly infects liver cells, causing persistent viral infection in a majority of people. However, only about 20-30% of them develop liver diseases in 20-30 years. HCV infection can be cleared with non-specific antiviral treatment (interferon and ribavirin) over 6-12 months in about half of patients, and recent introduction of directacting antiviral drugs of 3-6 months, duration considerably increased the cure rate to more than 90%. 2 HIV infection in people leads to a prolonged asymptomatic state and eventually to advanced HIV disease. HIV-1 infects T cells and macrophges and survives in a latent state. More than 30 antiretroviral drugs, most of them used in combinations of two or more drugs, have been successfully used to reduce viral load to undetectable levels in the blood of HIV/AIDS patients. However, the virus rebounds on discontinuation of antiviral treatment, necessitating life-long antiviral treatment. Dissemination of virus to the brain, which is mainly mediated by virus-infected macrophages, and subsequent development of neurologic disease occurs in more than 50% of HIV infections. 17 Therefore, neurologic impairment still remains an important problem even in this antiviral treatment era. These precedents of antiviral treatment of HCV and HIV-1 infections show that treatment outcome (viral clearance vs viral persistence), treatment duration (finite vs continous) and the presence of neurologic sequelae are greatly influenced by viral pathogenesis.",

Although the number of treated cats was small, a surprising amount of information was gleaned, such as how long to treat, potential side effects, how to identify the clinical form of FIP most likely to respond to the therapy, and potential indicators for treatment failures and successes. The field study was based on the experiences gained from pharmacokinetic and efficacy studies undertaken in laboratory cats. The initial treatment period was set to be 2 weeks based on experimental studies, but it was ultimately extended to 12 weeks and longer based on experiences obtained as the trial progressed. This final treatment period was closer to the 3-6 months used to treat HCV infection in people with direct-acting antiviral drugs. 2 Difficulties in treating neurologic disease was also anticipated from experimental studies. Side effects were acceptable and included stinging upon injection and dermal and subcutaneous inflammation when too much drug was given in the same spots. This was also seen first in laboratory cats. A more serious side effect, which was not seen beforehand in laboratory cats, was limited to kittens and involved retarded development of adult teeth and retention or delayed loss of deciduous teeth.",

            "text": "GC376 treatment was successful in inducing a significant remission of disease signs and regression of lesions in 19/20 cats. This result confirms our findings of rapid reversal of clinical signs in laboratory cats with experimental FIP treated with GC376, 6 and extended our knowledge of the drug's effects on a broad spectrum of forms of naturally occurring FIP. Cats came from various parts of the USA and even Peru, thus confirming that geographically diverse field strains of FIPV were equally susceptible to this inhibitor. Marked reductions in viral RNA transcripts occurred in effusions within days of treatment and were associated with rapid improvement of health. However, disease remission was sustained for 3 months and longer in only 7/20 of these cats. Failure to achieve long-term disease remission was ultimately associated with the occurrence of neurologic disease in the absence of gross abdominal lesions or a recurrence/ persistence of gross abdominal lesions in the presence of histologic lesions in the brain and/or eyes. These findings indicate that FIPV has a greater propensity to spread from the body cavities to the brain than previously assumed, especially if given enough time. This spread most likely involves infected macrophages that enter the brain through small blood vessels in the meninges and ependyma. 18, 19 Cats that developed neurologic disease did so either while on treatment (CT05, CT08, CT22) or 2 (CT01, CT02, CT09), 3 (CT13) or 6 (CT10) weeks after treatment was stopped. The most likely explanation for this delay, as well as some therapeutic benefit of higher dosages, was that some GC376 was still able to penetrate into the brain. GC376 levels in cerebrospinal fluid were only 3% of plasma in the brain at 2 h after a subcutaneous injection at a dosage of 10 mg/kg (unpublished data). Although the relative brain drug concentrations in these cats were low, they were still 21.4-fold higher than the levels required to inhibit virus replication in tissue culture. Given this finding, it was assumed that higher dosages would allow more drug into the brain. This assumption was bolstered by experiences with two cats that manifested neurologic signs. Increasing the dosage of GC376 to 50 mg/kg q12h in one cat (CT01) resulted in a noticeable improvement but did not eliminate the signs of brain disease. Extending treatment for a period of almost 3 months at a dosage of 15 mg/kg q12h appeared to delay the progression of neurologic signs in a second cat (CT12), whereas attempts to reduce the total daily dosage in this cat to 10 mg/kg q12h or 15 mg/kg q24h caused neurologic signs to worsen. This suggested that dosages of 15 mg/kg q12h or above allowed enough GC376 to cross the blood-brain barrier to retard but not eliminate neurologic signs.",

            "text": "The high incidence of central nervous system (CNS) diseases in this study was greater than previously reported and unexpected given that cats with signs of brain or spinal cord involvement were excluded from the trial. 20 CNS disease was much more likely to occur in older cats with dry or dry-to-wet disease than in young cats with wet FIP. This indicates that FIPV can enter the brain in many cats, if given enough time. Infection of the CNS appears to involve peritoneal-type macrophages, as FIPV-infected cells in the brains of cats with neurologic FIP more closely resemble peritoneal rather than resident brain macrophages. 18, 19 This should not be surprising, as macrophages migrate to various tissues, including the brain, to carry out immune surveillance and are also targets for a range of infectious agents, such as FIPV and HIV-1. Infected macrophages play a major role in viral dissemination to the brain in patients with HIV and detection of virus in the brain can occur within weeks of infection. 21, 22 However, neurologic impairment usually occurs at a later stage. Anti-HIV drugs also reduce the frequency of severe neurologic impairment, 23 as observed with FIPV and GC376 in the present study. There are also alternative explanations. It is possible that extra-CNS involvement may inhibit the development of brain disease and vice versa. It is common to see CNS disease occur in the absence of visceral disease and vice versa. 13, 20 Suppressing viral replication in the nonneuronal tissues may also enhance positive selection for mutants that are more neurotropic or neurovirulent. However, proof for the latter would require considerable studies using laboratory cats.",

            "text": "There were certain forms of FIP that appeared to influence treatment success. The behavior of GC376 treatment in treating ocular FIP was paradoxical as it responded extremely well to GC376. Even though ocular lesions responded to treatment, all of the three cats with eye involvement ultimately succumbed to brain disease, thus supporting the close anatomic relationship of the eye and the CNS. Chronic ileocecal and colon involvement and stunted growth in older cats also carried a bad prognosis in this study. A number of these cats appeared to develop abdominal effusions only as a terminal manifestation of their disease. Host factors also associated with reduced response to antiviral treatment in other viral infections, such as HCV, include age, sex, liver cirrhosis or fibrosis, race or body weight. 24 Emergence of resistance is a major concern for any antiviral drug, but FIPV is rarely transmitted from cat to cat, 13, 14 and drug resistance, if it does occur, would only be a problem for individual treated cats and not the entire population. Although viral resistance to GC376 was not observed in up to 20 passages in vitro, 6 suggesting that resistance is not easily acquired, long-term and repetitive treatment in vivo may be a stronger selection factor. However, viral resistance did not appear to be responsible for relapses of abdominal diseases in five treated cats. These cats had granulomatous-like masses, often in the colon and ileo-cecal-colic lymph nodes, which may have provided a protected place for viruses to persist. Protection of pathogens within granulomas is a well-documented phenomenon for mycobacteria and applies to other pathogens such as viruses. 24 The status of liver disease (cirrhosis) in HCV infection also increases the risk of relapse and necessitates longer treatment, indicating that viruses may also be protected from drugs when in certain protected sites. 2 The formation of 'protective granulomas' involves a large number of chemokines and cytokines and upregulation of chemokine receptors, addressins, selectins and integrins. 25 Persistence of pathogens in such protected sites may require a higher dose of drug and a longer treatment period.",

            "text": "Treatment failures may also result from an inability of the host to mount a protective immune response during the period when virus replication is being suppressed. Such a failure has been observed for HCV infection of people. 2 T-cell-mediated immunity plays an important role in protective immunity, which occurs for about 20% in acute infection of HCV, 26 and an equal or greater proportion of FIPV infection. [15] [16] [17] The possible synergism of T-cell-mediated viral clearance and antiviral drug therapy in cats with FIP remains to be investigated. There may also be merit in combining antiviral drugs and stimulants of T-cell immunity for FIP treatment, such as the combination of interferons and ribavirin for the treatment of HCV infection. 2 The sustained remission in 6/7 cats that were treated for 12 weeks or longer was somewhat predictable. These cats were 3.3-4.4 months of age when presented for acute signs of either abdominal (C15, C17, C18, CT21, CT23) or thoracic effusive FIP (CT20). This made them younger than all but three (CT8, CT16, CT21 ) other cats in the trial and more closely resembling the 16-week-old laboratory cats with acute-onset effusive FIP that responded well to GC376. 6 The disease, being more acute, may allow less time for virus to spread to the brain or eyes. The acuteness of their disease may have also allowed less time for the infection to permanently compromise any protective immune response. The seventh cat, CT04, was an extreme to these six younger cats. CT04 was the oldest cat in the study at 6.8 years that presented with substantial weight loss (30%) and disease limited to mesenteric lymph nodes. CT04 suffered disease relapses requiring reinstitution of treatment, but all relapses were identical to the presenting condition and did not involve the CNS. Cats with this form of FIP have been known to undergo spontaneous remissions, indicating that there is a tipping point between immunity and disease. 13, 27, 28 Cats CT04 and CT21 demonstrated the wisdom of re-instituting treatment when relapses occurred, providing that those relapses do not involve the eyes or nervous system and are still drug responsive.",

Cat CT21 was outwardly healthy, active and growing after 12 weeks of treatment, but total proteins and white blood cell counts had still not returned to normal as they had in the other six cats. Nonetheless, a decision was made to stop treatment after 17 weeks because of the long period of outwardly normal health. Whether treating for a longer period of time would have prevented a disease relapse 13 weeks after stopping treatment is open to conjecture, but it does raise the point of how long treatment is required in some cats. It also raises the question of how long remission must be sustained to declare the disease cured rather than in a sustained remission. The longest disease-free period has been over 11 months at the time of writing, with five other cats free of infection signs for 5-9 months. Based on clinical and histologic evidence of neurologic disease at the time of fatal relapses, it would seem that the virus will eventually reach the brain and that this may be the most important limiting factor in antiviral drug treatment of FIP.",

However, sustained remissions in this study were more apt to occur in kittens <18 weeks of age presenting with acute onset wet FIP or in cats with dry FIP limited to a mesenteric lymph node and less likely to occur in cats greater than 18 weeks of age presenting with dry, dry-to-wet or ocular disease. Failure to achieve sustained remission was associated with either a high incidence of neurologic disease during or after treatment is stopped or to recurrence of abdominal lesions. Antiviral treatment seemed to slow the progression of neurologic disease but did not reverse it at the dosage employed in this trial. The reason for recurrence of extra-neurologic disease in the face of treatment was not determined but was not associated with mutations in the protease binding region. ",
