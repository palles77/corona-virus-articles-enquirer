The case fatality rate is increased in older people and those with pre-existing disease and is reported to be about 20% in people with COVID-19 who are older than 80 years, 1 although this does not take into account the under-reporting of mildly affected cases. There are about 8\u00b78 million people aged 70 years or older in the UK and many others with health conditions that increase their vulnerability to COVID-19. In the face of the rapid spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, older people and other vulnerable groups are being asked to self-isolate for a considerable time to reduce the risks of infection, with potential adverse effects on physical and mental health.",

Experience from Brazil, Pakistan, Ethiopia, and other nations shows how a coordinated community workforce can provide effective health and social care support at scale. 2-4 To respond to the COVID-19 pandemic, we suggest that CHWs would be young people, aged 18-30 years, in whom the likelihood of serious consequences from COVID-19 is currently deemed low. 1 This demographic is increasingly likely to have been exposed to COVID-19 and therefore have acquired immunity. Large-scale unemployment as a consequence of the economic impact of this pandemic makes this a group potentially in need of employment opportunities. Despite the UK Government's enormous package of benefits designed to retain people in employment, substantial job losses are likely. Furthermore, up to 30 000 medical and physician associate students could be involved who cannot participate in usual clinical placements, possibly until September, 2020, because clinical attachments are being suspended.",

Online courses are available from some academic institutions on COVID-19 and emergency measures to accredit and certificate these courses to agreed standards could be implemented. Recruitment and training could be overseen by Health Education England, commissioned from a higher education provider or devolved to an organisation such as Public Health England.",

CHWs would need to be provided with personal protective and other equipment and trained to follow protocols to assess temperature, blood pressure, and, with the provision of portable pulse oximeters, early detection of severe illness, thus collecting data for clinical and epidemiological purposes. Similar protocols are already in place and used by CHWs in diverse settings-eg, as part of the Integrated Management of Newborn and Childhood Illness. 5 Additionally, home visits for vulnerable people would allow CHWs to assess whether individuals have adequate supplies of food and medicines for long-term conditions, are aware of basic hygiene precautions, and whether they have mental health problems. In future, CHWs might be involved in COVID-19 community testing and possibly supporting vaccine trials. Over time, CHWs might also contribute to the management of long-term conditions through monitoring physical and mental health, and reviewing availability and use of medicines.",

This approach would meet a gap in UK undergraduate experience and might become a long-term feature of medical education. 6 For a future scaled workforce, there will be financial implications, but the costs should be affordable. On the basis of the Brazilian CHW model, estimates of the cost of a scaled CHW workforce in England suggest this could amount to about \u00a32\u00b72 billion per annum for 100 000 CHWs. 7 Such an amount is a small proportion of the existing NHS budget that is projected to increase in the coming years. 8 Some would argue that it is too risky to put CHWs with only limited training in contact with vulnerable members of society. However, there are risks associated with prolonged unmonitored isolation, from the effects of COVID-19, as well as loneliness and mental health deterioration. The risks of using CHWs in this way could be reduced by supervision, with independent monitoring and evaluative research to identify problems early and correct them. The CHWs could visit in pairs to reduce the risks.",

            "text": "People might resist or be reluctant to be visited by CHWs, and they could opt out of home visits at any time, but experience with CHWs in Brazil in the past 30 years suggests this would happen rarely. 4 In Brazil, 250 000 CHWs provide a much needed and relied upon service. CHWs in Brazil have been established for many years, are well integrated into their communities, and provide a wide range of health and social care support activities to each of the 100-150 households that they are responsible for. Therefore, in Brazil, additional roles for preventing the spread of and supporting those infected with COVID-19 or in self-isolation could be integrated into the work of CHWs. Much can be learned from countries with successful experiences of radical, large-scale workforce interventions. 9 It could be argued that this is an unrealistic proposal and that adapting the existing system or training so many people is too challenging. However, current health and social care systems in the UK are under extreme pressure and could become overwhelmed. In a time of fear, isolation, and growing health inequalities, 10 use of CHWs for the COVID-19 response would boost social coherence and fill gaps that have begun to emerge between health and social care and in-person and virtual access to health care. Our proposal for CHWs would produce a large cadre of people with an understanding of basic epidemiological and public health concepts 11 who could challenge scientific misinformation and explain the rationale for specific health policies and interventions to the public. This approach would also help build a new generation of leaders who can help tackle the complex challenges of our age. ",
