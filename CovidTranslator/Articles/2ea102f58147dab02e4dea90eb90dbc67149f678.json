Considering potential sequencing errors at both ends, the genome sequence variations among different strains of 2019-nCoV isolated from patients located in different cities were low considering only 5 several mutations in about 30kb genome per isolate. Based on the nucleotide positions 8517 and 27641, the 2019-nCoV strains can be divided into two major groups (Figs 2A and S2). All the group 1 strains have thymine at 8517 and cytosine at 27641, which are same as corresponding nucleotides in SARS, whereas the group 2 stains have cytosine at 8517 and thymine at 27641 (Figs 2A and S3) . Epidemiological data G1 and G2 strains 10 revealed that the collection date and location of the earliest G1 strain (EPI_ISL_406801) was January 5 th , 2020 in Wuhan, whereas the earliest G2 strain was isolated in December 24 th , 2019 in Wuhan (Fig 2A) . The existence of both genetic groups in the same city indicated co-circulation, but evolved convergently at the early outbreak. Within each group, we also observed additional shared mutations added to multiple strains. Based on 15 these potentially inheritable mutations and the identifying times and locations, we generated a mutation tree map to track individual shared mutations and show the relationships among different isolates (Fig 2A and S2 ). For example, five strains identified in Guangdong from Jan. 10-15 all share the same mutation in nucleotide position 28578 on the background of group 1 might be transmitted by the same person. The similar strain 20 may transmit to three patients identified in Japan on Jan. 29-31 with additional mutation at nucleotide position 2397 and to a patient identified in USA on Jan. 22 with additional mutation at nucleotide position 10818.

To date, there are more confirmed 2019-nCoV cases than that of the whole 2002 SARS outbreak. Coronavirus sequences 10 have been published frequently and consistently over the last 18 years, which included SARS strains isolated from different countries during 2002 SARS outbreak, sporadic CoV strains mainly reported in China, MERS strains isolated from middle east countries such as Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates (Fig 1B). To further understand the evolution of the betacoronaviruses and track the mutations accumulated with 2019-nCoV, we have 15 collected and sequenced 11 full-length 2019-nCoV genome sequences from new patients identified in multiple Chinese cities including Wuhan (Fig 1C).

When the full-length spike protein sequences were compared, 2019-nCoV shares 15 39% sequence homology to human and bat SARS as compared to MERS or other CoV at 29%. Interestingly, we found that 2019-nCoV and pangolin-CoV share near identical amino acid sequence in the RBD (aa 315-550 region) of the spike protein, but not for RaTG13 (Figs 3A and 3D). To confirm this finding, we have compared the pangolin-CoV reported by Liu et al with previously isolated but unpublished pangolin-CoV sequences 20 (Figure S4). Based on the alignment and phylogenetic analysis, we found pangolin/Guangdong/P2S/2019 (EPI_ISL_410544), whereas additional Guangdong province of China in 2019. Next we examined the phylogenetic relationship of the consensus spike protein sequence of 2019-nCoV against 25 representative CoV strains including Hu-CoV, SARS and MERS and five new pangolin-5 CoV strains using a ML method (Figure S4). The results demonstrate that the Spike protein of 2019-nCoV is likely derived from Pangolin-CoV but not RaTG13, all of which could be in the same lineage as BAT_SARS-CoV/bat-SL-CoVZC542. The fact that while 2019-nCoV is most homologous to RaTG13 in overall genome structure the RBD of the spike protein is most homologous to Pangolin-CoV, suggests the possible recombination 10 between RaTG13 like and Pangolin-CoV like strains happens in the evolution of 2019-nCoV. We have manually examined all amino acid mutations in the genome. Due to the presence of the unsequenced regions in the Pangolin-CoV sequence, we did not include any positions flanking these regions. We found that when comparing Pangolin-CoV and 2019-nCoV, in addition to the RBD, regions in nsp14 and 15 also shares consecutive 15 sequences (Fig 3D). To further evaluate the 2019-nCoV relationship with other SARS CoVs, we analyzed the RBM of the 2019-nCoV and different human/bat SARS viruses and observed that they can be clearly divided into two distinct clades (Fig 4A). The clade I viruses include 2019-nCoV, pangolin CoVs, 12 of bat SARS (bat SARS CoV I) such as RaTG13, and human 20 SARS",

Interestingly, the 2019-nCoV stains we have analyzed fall into two distinct groups 10 with different nucleotide polymorphisms at positions 8782 and 28144. Although it remains to be determined if these two distinct groups of 2019-nCoV were evolved before or after transmission from animal to human, both groups were first detected in wuhan and then spread to different regions in China and multiple countries.

Recent studies have indicated ACE2 as the entry receptor for 2019-nCoV 29 although other host cell factors such as TMPRSS2 are likely involved 30 . When we used the receptor binding motifs to conduct phylogenic analysis, we could separate 2019-nCoV, human and bat SARS into two distinct clades. Interestingly, all the viruses known to use ACE2 as the entry receptor are within the clade 15 I whereas all the bat SARS viruses which do not use ACE2 entry receptors belong to clade II. Therefore, we predict that the clade I CoV viruses including the 2019-nCoV can while clade II CoV cannot infect host cells through ACE2. Based on the available genome sequences, there are many more clade II bat CoV (over 49 stains) than clade I bat CoV (about 12 strains). Some of the clade II bat CoV such as ZXC21 and ZC45 are more 20 homologous to the 2019-nCoV than the clade I bat CoV and human SARS.
