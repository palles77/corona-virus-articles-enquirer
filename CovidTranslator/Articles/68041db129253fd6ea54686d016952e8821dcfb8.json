To test the role of the fibrinolytic niche in the regeneration of alveolar epithelium, we compared the self-renewing capacity of alveolar epithelial type 2 (AT2) cells and its differentiation to AT1 cells between wild type (wt) and fibrinolytic niche deficient mice (Plau -/and Serpine1 Tg ). A significant reduction in both proliferation and differentiation of deficient AT2 cells was observed in vivo and in 3D organoid cultures. This decrease was mainly restored by uPA derived A6 peptide, a binding fragment to CD44 receptors. The proliferative and differential rate of CD44 + AT2 cells was greater than that of CD44controls. There was a reduction in transepithelial ion transport in deficient monolayers compared to wt cells. Moreover, we found a marked suppression in total AT2 cells and CD44 + subpopulation in lungs from brain dead patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and a mouse model infected by influenza viruses. Thus, we demonstrate that the fibrinolytic niche can regulate AT2-mediated homeostasis and regeneration via a novel uPA-A6-CD44 + -ENaC cascade.",

To replace aged AT1 cells, AT2 cells undergo self-renewal to maintain alveolar epithelial homeostasis1. The regenerative potential of AT2 cells could be activated for timely recovery from lung epithelial injury2-4, including lobectomy and infections5 , 6. A marked suppression in fibrinolytic activity in local respiratory illnesses (e.g., inhaled smoke and aspirated gastric juice) and pulmonary complications of systemic diseases (e.g., sepsis) has been reported clinically and in animal models7 , 8. Migration and differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in inflamed tissues are regulated by dynamic fibrinolytic niche9-12. The proteolysis of extracellular matrix substrates by urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) could be involved in the benefit of the fibrinolytic niche to the regeneration of skeletal muscles and fractured cartilage13-17. For example, uPA and plasmin, two critical components of the fibrinolytic niche, cleave epithelial sodium channels (ENaC)18 , 19. In addition, functionally multifaceted uPA regulates alveolar epithelial function20 and possesses an A6 motif with a high affinity to CD44 receptors21 , 22. CD44 + AT2 cells show a higher proliferative capacity in fibrotic lungs23. The fibrinolytic niche in alveolar epithelial homeostasis and regeneration mediated by AT2 cells, however, has not been studied systematically. Our results have tested the potential novel contribution of uPA-PAI1-A6-CD44-ENaC cascade to the fibrinolytic niche in regulating the fate of AT2 cells.",

We previously demonstrated that CD44 receptors govern cell survival and the progression of lung fibrosis via the Toll-like receptors and hyaluronan54. The connective domain of uPA has an eight L-amino acid sequence (Ac-KPSSPPEE-NH2), known as A6 peptide55. Binding of the A6 peptide with the link domain of CD44 receptors initiates the downstream signaling56. CD44 -/mice demonstrate an inflammatory phenotype characterized by increased inflammatory cell recruitment and are more susceptible to LPS induced injury. CD44 deficiency leads to impaired expression of negative regulators of TLR signaling in macrophages, an essential event in the prevention of LPS induced inflammatory responses57. Our study demonstrates a new mechanism that the CD44 receptors at the plasma membrane of AT2 cells are a key player for AT2 cell-mediated re-alveolarization. In addition to the reduction in AT2 cells in injured mouse and human lungs associated with aberrant fibrinolytic niche, both Plau -/and Serpine1 Tg AT2 cells cannot develop organoids equal to those of wt mice in vitro, mostly likely due to the author/funder.

This is supported by our previously unreported observations that CD44 + AT2 cells have an enhanced capacity for selfrenewal and differentiation to AT1 cells. Of note, both Plau -/and Serpine1 Tg mice have lesser CD44 + AT2 cells so that the total yield of primary AT2 cells is significantly reduced compared with wt controls. The brain ENaC proteins encoded by the Scnn1a, 1b, 1d, and 1g are involved in adult neurogenesis by the transmembrane sodium signals for the deletion of Scnn1a or functional blockade by amiloride in neural stem cells strongly impairs their proliferation and differentiation58. ENaC has been functionally detected in both club cells and AT2 cells59. Whether ENaC is a member of the fibrinolytic niche for lung stem cell-mediated regeneration is unknown. We recently reported that overexpression of the Scnn1d, a pseudogene in mice, significantly improves the development of organoids in 3D cultures of primary mouse AT2 cells60.

The trachea was cannulated with a 20G catheter to instill 1.5 -2.0 mL dispase followed by 0.5 mL of 1% low melting point agarose. The lungs were dissected and incubated in 50 U/mL dispase solution for 45 min at room temperature. The lungs were gently teased in DMEM/F-12 + 0.01% DNase I and incubated for 10 min at room temperature. Cells were passed through a serial filtration (100, 40, 30, and 10 \u00b5m cell strainers) and centrifuged at 300 \u00d7 g for 10 min at 4 o C. Cells were resuspended in 10 mL medium (DMEM/F-12 + 10% FBS + P/S) supplemented with biotinylated antibodies, rat anti-mouse CD16/32 (0.65 \u00b5g/million cells), rat anti-mouse CD45 (1.5 \u00b5g/million cells), and rat anti-mouse Ter119 (5 \u00b5g) and incubated for 30 min at 37 o C on an incubator shaker at 60 rpm. Resuspended cells were then incubated with pre-washed streptavidin-coated magnetic particles for 30 min at room temperature to remove undesired cells. Selected cells were then resuspended in 10 mL medium (DMEM/F-12 + 10% FBS + P/S) and incubated for 30 min at 37 o C in a sterile Petri dish to allow residual fibroblasts to adhere to the bottom of the dish.",

The interface containing both AT2 cells and alveolar macrophages was collected and further centrifuged at 800 rpm for 10 min, and the cell pellet was washed and resuspended in Ca 2+ , Mg 2+ -free PBS containing 0.5% FBS. The cells were incubated with magnetic beads coated with anti-CD 14 antibodies (Dynabeads\u00ae CD14, Invitrogen) at 4 C for 40 min, and the majority of the macrophages were then selectively depleted with a Dynal magnet (Dynal Biotech, Oslo, Norway).",

The culture medium on the basolateral side was replaced with a serum-free medium in 48 h post seeding. Transepithelial resistance (RT, \u03a9) and potential difference (VT, mV) were measured using an epithelial voltohmmeter (EVOM: World Precision Instrument, USA) in 72 h. The culture medium was then replaced with serum-free media and maintained with the air-liquid interface until day 5. Monolayers were maintained in a humidified 5% CO2 air incubator at 37\u00b0C. Stacked image files (avi format) were segmented with 3D Objects Counter. Surface files were used for both 3D geometrical and shape measures. The 3D surface plot was used to generate surface graphs. This 3D model has the following advantages: 1) Stromal cells are not used (feeder-free). 2) Tight junction proteins are generated to develop an epithelial barrier in an in vivo pattern. 3) Cells are polarized to separate apical and basolateral membranes. 4) Cytosolic and cell surface signal proteins are expressed and distributed in a polarized way. 5) It is suitable for testing the permeability of the epithelial barrier. 6) It complimentarily overcomes the limitations of 3D organoids for studying barrier function and polarization of signaling proteins.",

Cells were then resuspended into a100 \u00b5L mixture (1:1) of growth factor reduced matrigel (Corning, USA) and organoid medium (DMEM/F12 supplemented with 2 mM L-glutamine, 10 % active FBS, 1% ITS, and 10 \u03bcM ALK inhibitor). On each 0.33 cm 2 insert (Corning Costar, USA) 50 uL mixed cells were seeded and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 30 min to allow the matrix to solidify. Then 410 \u00b5L culture medium was added to the bottom well and changed half (200 \u00b5L) of the medium every other day. The DIC images of organoids (diameter \u2265 50 \u03bcm) were visualized with an Olympus IX 73 microscope (4\u00d7 objective, Olympus, Japan) with an Hamamatsu photonics CMOS camera (Orca Flash 4.0; 2,048 \u00d7 2,048 pixels) on a designed day post seeding. The surface area of individual organoid was measured with Image J. The sum of all organoids on each transwell insert was the total surface area. Histologic images of organoids were captured from sliced matrigel. Matrigel containing organoids was fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 1 h, dehydrated with increasing ethanol grades, and embedded in paraffin blocks. Sections at the thickness of 7 \u00b5m were fixed for an additional 5 min in 4% paraformaldehyde, then H & E stain was performed as described previously7.",
