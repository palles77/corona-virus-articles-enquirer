In this research article, an attempt has been made to understand the qualitative behavior of a virus infection model with Lytic and Non-Lytic Immune Responses by perturbing with randomness (white noise) via Lyapunov technique. The conditions for the extinction and permanence of the viral infection in the interacting populations has been found, analyzed and supported with numerical simulations. An application to HIV infection model has also been presented for drawing a comparative study of the model under various modeling methods. The research findings of this paper reveal that a study that includes random fluctuations of the environment prove to be the ideal way to bring out the qualitative analysis of a mathematical model that will depict the real world scenario.",

The combat between the scientists and infectious diseases never seems to take a break and continue even in this contemporary world despite many advancements in the science and technology. Mathematical modeling techniques appeared as boon to the biological scientists as they provided them an artificial environment to experiment without affecting the population directly and cost effective, so they continue to attract millions of scientists even today. Modeling the viral infections in vivo has caught the attention of scientists in recent years with the discoveries of many new members in the family of viral diseases like SAARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) despite the presence of senior citizens (AIDS -Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome, conjunctivitis etc.). The different approaches adopted by mathematical biologists like Huang et al. in Huang, Yokoi, Takeuchi, Kajiwara, and Sasaki (2011), Herz et.al in Herz, Bonhoeffer, Anderson, May, and tried their hand with Delay Differential Equations and Fractional Differential Equations in Zhang, Huang, Liu, and Fan (2015) with regard to intracellular delay in viral dynamics and HIV infection Models with Non-linear incidence rates respectively while M. Pitchaimani et al. in Pitchaimani and Monica (2015) focussed on HIV-1 infection model with three time delays.

In those papers, many discussions have been attempted with simulation results trying to present a clear insight in the viral dynamics. Natural query, now, in the heads are why viral dynamics deserves due attention and capitulates the interests beyond centuries. So, before getting into the model briefing, let us take a short tour on the biological aspects behind the motivation to research the viral dynamics for centuries. In general, any biologically identified organism possess immune system to safeguard itself from the enemies those attack them both anatomically and physiologically, in particular, the genus Homo sapiens being the largely dominating population in terms of evolution as in Bonhoeffer, May, Shaw, and Nowak (1997) , Nowak and Bangham (1996) and Wodarz (2003) . The immune system of the H. sapiens are said to showcase two types of immune responses viz., innate and antigen mediated immunity which are further being put into broader categories of Lytic and Non-Lytic Immune responses when it comes to Antiviral immune effector mechanisms to fight against viral infections which we are about to analyze mathematically through modeling with random effects shortly. The study of viral dynamics continue to be an area of greater research interest as they give an opportunity to unearthen the mysterious behavior of the physiological mechanisms of the human body. These studies help us in deciding the factors like the type of immune response to be effected in the host system to combat the viral infection and the level of treatment such that the hosts are not being exposed to lethal complications. Also, mathematical models provide deeper insights into the various drug therapy strategies used.",

As we discussed in the beginning of introduction, the Lytic and Non-Lytic immune responses play a vital role as the virus not only tend to cause infection in the susceptible cells i.e., its target victims but also tend to spend its life within the poor victims i.e., in the infected cell by replicating its viral DNA thereby adding more victims and spreading infections on a larger scale within the host system. The Lytic components kill infected cells while the Non-Lytic inhibit viral replication through soluble mediators. In the innate type of immunity response, natural killer cells can lyse infected cells and cytokines (for example, interferon \u03b1 ((IFN-\u03b1 1 ) and (IFN-\u03b2 1 )) secreted by various cell types, can inhibit viral replication in a Non-Lytic fashion. In antigen mediated immune response, cytotoxic T Lymphocytes (CTLs) kill infected cells, whereas antibodies neutralize free virus particles. Also, in addition, CD4 + and CD8 + T cells can secrete cytokines that inhibit viral replication (e.g., IFN-\u03b3 1 and tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 1 (TNF\u03b1 1 )). The antiviral immune effector mechanisms enter into action field, thereby discovering chances of eliminating the infectious guests (virus particles) under the capitancy of immune responses (Lytic & Non-Lytic immune responses). The relative roles of the immune responses are decided by the cytopathicity of the virus relative to its replication because if the viral cytopathicity is low in comparison with its rate of replication then a treatment that together induce both the type of immune responses are needed for action while on the contrary situation both types are given space for independent actions to get the situation (infection) under control. A study on mortality deceleration rate has been carried out by Pitchaimani and T. Eakin in Pitchaimani and Eakin (2008) .",

The parameter p expresses the strength of the Lytic component, while the efficacy of the Non-Lytic component is being expressed by the parameter q. The dynamics of the free virus has not been included explicitly in the model (1) because (Bartholdy et al., 2000; Wodarz et al., 2002) assume that the free virus turnover is much faster than that of infected cells, which allows to make a quasi steady-state assumption, where the amount of free virus is proportional to the number of infected cells.",

(2002) , the non-linear incidence rate needs a mention with its effects in biological sense because viral infection models with other incidence rates like saturated incidence rate, linear infection rates do exist and been analyzed by many biologists, so naturally there arises a doubt in the minds how they differ from one another and their effective contribution in the analyzation process. The non-linear incidence rates brings to light that the spread of infection may be through physical movement or any other means of dispersion that an infected individual will have contact with a given number of susceptible individuals in the population. The potential to effectively disperse the disease (virus) could be thought of as being proportional to that number of susceptibles with whom the infected individual makes contact: indeed, more the contact, the infected individual has with susceptibles, the more likely the host is to effectively transmit the disease. It then follows that the magnitude of the realized disease spread could be measured, for example, in terms of the contagious spreading ability of the infected individual. Accordingly, every infected individual will be expected to realize a certain virus (or micro-parasite) spread potential. It can be noted here, that often, a non-linear function could be a better choice to account for factors such as crowding of infected individuals, multiple pathways to infection, stage of infection and its severity or protective measures taken by susceptible individuals. Now, let us move into the discussion of our model of interest (i.e.), a model with random effects.",

            "text": "In the real world, all infections are subject to randomness in terms of natural transmission. The random fluctuations exhibited by the birth and death rates, transmission coefficients and the other parameters in the system to a greater or lesser extent due to environmental fluctuations was revealed by May in May (2001) while the presence of even a small amount of white noise can suppress a potential population was studied by Mao et al. (Mao, Marion, & Renshaw, 2002) . This implies the significance of investigating the effect of random fluctuations in the environment on population dynamics. Many authors (Lahrouz & Omari, 2013; Lahrouz, Omari, Kiouach, & Belma\u00e2ti, 2011a; Schurz, 2001a,b; Yang & Mao, 2014) have studied the effect of environmental noise on the transmission dynamics of disease by proposing SDE models with stochastic disturbances through the perturbation technique which is a standard technique adopted by majority of the researchers in the recent years. A detailed study on the stability analysis for various mathematical models and its applicability in stochastic modeling can be grasped via (Arrowsmith & Place, 1990; Gard, 1998; Khasminskii, 1980; Lahrouz, Omari, & Kiouch, 2011b; LaSalle, 1976; Ruan & Wang, 2003; Schurz, 2007; Schurz & Tosun, 2014; Zhao, Yuan, & Ma, 2015) . In our proposed study, we felt that it is wise to include the randomness by perturbing the infection rate \u03b2\u03b1\u03bb 1 + q\u03ba with white noise because the effective treatment to curb the infection spread and a detailed analysis on the dynamics of the virus in the host system can be explored thereby adding little more knowledge to the literature and the pathologists. With this measure of random effects within the host cell, studies reveal the type of immune cells to be activated in the immune system, for instance antibodies like cytotoxic lymphocytes or CD4 + cells in evoking a specific type of immune response in the host at the present stage of infection so that the spread may be put under the control of therapeutic mechanisms. Also, one cannot deny the fact that some evidences (Hethcote & Vanden Driessche, 1991; Korobeinikov, 2004 Korobeinikov, , 2009a Liu, Hethcote, & Levin, 1987; Xiao & Ruan, 2007) do exist showing that bilinear incidence rate is not much effective as non-linear incidence rate, in case, if the uninfected cells are at large. The random effect included in the infection rate can come out with additional information for curtailing the infectious period (i.e.), the chances of reducing the guest stay (virus stay) duration in the host will reduce the treatment period consequently. In short, the chemotherapy or any other means by which the host can be treated for infection will be shortened once if the dynamical behavior spread can be clearly analyzed and treated earlier. This view convinces us the introduction of randomness in the infection rate \u03b2\u03b1\u03bb 1 + q\u03ba with Gaussian White noise that takes the new form (\u03b2 + F (\u03b1, \u03bb, \u03ba))\u03b1\u03bb 1 + q\u03ba dW dt , where F (\u03b1, \u03bb, \u03ba) is a locally Lipschitz-continuous function on D and W is i.i.d. via perturbation techniques. In this form, let us not forget the fact that the unboundedness of contact rate have also been prevented.",

With this, the focus shift landed towards the methods of mathematical analyzation in a step by step process followed by observations on the conditions that would effect the disease free dynamics together with the chances of existence for chronic infection in the model. Then comes the question about the behavior on the endemic equilibrium solutions (permanency) of the infection model in the longer run and is been answered therein (i.e.), despite the treatment given to the host the chances of permanency is established via mathematical terminologies. Although, the theoretical results assure the authenticity on the dynamics, we tried to prove that these observational results hold on for a larger scale population through the theory of stationary distribution and positive recurrence exhibited by the model. Our primary objective in this paper (i.e.), observational study with empirical data is met by showcasing the simulation results in the form of graphs. An application of this observational study has been tested with a HIV infection model with Non-linear incidence rate in the follow up before concluding the paper with discussions. Some of the mathematical preliminaries that helped to bring out the observational study in this topic viz definitions, results are included in the appendix as they should not form an obstacle in the flow of our objective to analyze the effects of randomness.",

In such cases, the mathematical models admit infection-free equilibrium which will be undertaken into analytic study in the following section. We are pretty aware of the fact that the Lytic immune responses have the ability to kill the infected cells henceforth bringing down the population of infected cells to a larger extent and also preventing the replication of virus inside the host to a minimal level which can be accelerated high with Non-Lytic immune response. In order to make a decision on the type of immune response to be effected in the infected individual to become infection-free it is pivotal to analyze the stability of our proposed model (2) with respect to this condition of equilibrium to initiate Lytic immune response based on the nature of infection caused.",

Thus, in general, if the infection rate can be controlled by stimulating the activities of CytoToxic Lymphocytes (CTL) and cytokines in the host immune system through chemotherapy for some viral infectious diseases as they kill infected cells whereas antibodies neutralize the free virus particles, our system (2) admits the chances of disease free equilibrium even though persistence of the model (2) has been discussed in later sections.

Even though there have been different attitudinal behavior with the values of R 0 < 1 or > 1, the system (2) behaved in the similar way of revolving around disease free equilibrium solution when the value of R 0 is exactly 1. 4. Upon paying due attention, the results further proved that the model under our study displayed invariance towards the initial conditions.(i.e.), the system showed no changes when they are simulated with different initial values, for they are the dependents on the values of R 0 only, thus supporting the results of Theorem 1. 5. Since, the parameter values used in the simulations are not from literature, we further extended our study in the direction of individual behavior of the members of the system (2) so that they guarantee validity as any other models in the similar Literature. Here comes the Fig. 5 to extend its support in this regard showcasing that with the increase in infection rates and lack/failure of appropriate treatment at the right time, the host population may end up in the outbreak of epidemics or at cellular level, uncontrolled spread may lead to immediate death. 6. The Figs. 6 and 7 shows the effects of random noise and the importance of introducing randomness in the model (1). It is clear that the disease-free and endemic equilibrium solutions of the model (2) are not smooth and environmental fluctuations have great influence in the dynamical behavior of the disease. 7. The major difference one can see while comparing the deterministic and stochastic models is that in deterministic system the parameters are assumed to be constant which is not true biologically in day to day life. So, to make our analysis more realistic there arises a need for better theory which is provided by including the environmental variations while modeling the real world scenario mathematically. It is the place where Stochastic Perturbation theory comes Fig. 4 . The above graph shows the simulated results inferred as we planned to observe the robustness of the model for notable small changes in infection and death rates related to both natural and infection related deaths with increase in the rate of immune response by c = 0.95. We present the inferred results as below: For the increase in rates of \u03b2 = 0.002, the infection rate, a = 0.9 and \u00b5 = 0.8 which are disease related and natural death rates, the system showed stability around disease-free equilibrium for the initial values (\u03b1 0 , \u03bb 0 , \u03ba 0 ) = (100, 15, 45) and \u03b3 = 300, p = 0.4, q = 0.5, b = 0.31, c = 0.95 with R 0 = 0.8333 < 1 and (\u03b1 1 , \u03bb 1 , \u03ba 1 ) = (375, 0, 0).",

We studied the existence of strong unique solution of nonlinear SDE's and provided a rigorous proof. This task is non-trivial as we deal with non-linear SDE's. Further, our investigation revealed a biologically relevant domain D on which random dynamics of Susceptible, Virus Population and Immune Responses with non-globally Lipschitz-continuous coefficients takes place. In the presence of erratic unbounded martingale-type noises this fact is non-trivial. Also, stochastic asymptotic stability of disease free and endemic equilibria has been discussed with the help of invariance principle and Lyapunov's second method.",

            "text": "Generally, stochastic asymptotic stability of equilibria is connected to the basic reproduction number R 0 . There may some possibilities in the real stochastic viral dynamics, that the infection can extinct even if the basic reproduction number is R 0 > 1 and can develop if R 0 < 1 but not in all cases. There is no such effect observed in the proposed model. The only possibility what the authors show is that for R 0 < 1 the infection does extinct as it is in the deterministic model. In the proposed viral infection model no such effects are observed at both theoretical and simulated experimental levels. Sufficient conditions for stochastic asymptotic stability can found in terms of parameters and functional dependence on the variable contact and recovery rates. A remarkable fact of the criteria is that a sufficient condition for stability can be found for general local Lipschitz continuous F i 's. The applicability of mathematical approach is demonstrated by some graphical illustrations and the simulations show parametric dependence of asymptotic stability of related equilibria in view of expectations and variances. In this paper, equal importance has been given for both disease-free equilibrium and endemic equilibrium solutions as we look at the current research scenario. In recent years, we felt that many active researches are being carried on those cases in which the disease or infections that continue to exist in the system for instance, HIV infections, AIDS etc and those infections like conjunctivitis are receiving less attention which one cannot deny. So, we thought of carrying out simulations with criteria that would provide a clear idea of the entire dynamics of the disease which may explore the possibilities of extinction as well as survival of the host, in cases of endemicity. Based on our observations, we would also like to add a comment on the type of immune response to be effected in the host because reducing the replicative rate of the virus population by Non-Lytic effector mechanisms is always beneficial whereas increasing the death rate of infected cells can be both detrimental and beneficial, in short, we are prone to side effects on larger scale. We also observed when we simulated the system (22) it seems much effective in comparison with simulation results carried out with Fractional Order as it gives stability conditions in stronger sense. This statement is validated with the simulation results gained in Huang et al. in Zhang et al. (2015) showed that the with the parameter values \u03bb = 23.3, \u03b2 = 0.5, a = 0.02, p = 10, q = 0.79, d = 0.09, b = 0.15, c = 0.0031 even with higher efficacy rates of the Lytic and Non-Lytic Immune responses the basic reproduction numbers for both immune absence equilibrium R 0 = 31.4916 > 1 and immune presence equilibrium R 1 = 30.2250 > 1. The graphs in the paper (Zhang et al., 2015) with the above values evidently shows that the endemic equilibrium stabilizes only after 150 days for smaller order of fractions \u03b1 = 0.56, \u03b1 = 0.65. If we look at the empirical study carried out in our paper, it is evident even a smaller rate of efficacies of Lytic and Non-Lytic components, the stabilization is at a much faster rate as our parameter values are nearly closer to those values in Zhang et al. (2015) . Also, based on our observations we conclude that our model seems to be sensitive to infective rates even though any explicit sensitivity analysis has not been carried out in this paper. The future scope of this article lies in introducing the idea of multi group models with random perturbation in the papers (Ji, Jang, & Shi, 2011; Tan, Pan, Qiao, Zou, & Pan, 2012; Yu, Jiang, & Shi, 2009) by Ji. et al., J. Yu et al. and J. Tan et al. respectively , which will form a new frame work in the literature to analyze the mathematical models with more precision and accuracy.",
