(1991) J. Gen. Virol. 72, 579-587). Sequence analysis showed that mRNA 3 was smaller due to the presence of a new putative RNA-leader binding site upstream of the PRCV ORF-3 gene. However, this observation did not explain the deletion observed in PRCV mRNA 2. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to generate cDNA from the 3' coding region of the putative polymerase gene to the poly (A) tail of PRCV for comparison to the equivalent region from TGEV. The PRCV S protein was found to consist of 1225 amino acids, which had 98% similarity to the TGEV S protein. However, the PRCV S gene contained a 672 nucleotide deletion, corresponding to 224 amino acids (residues 21 to 245 in TGEV S protein), 59 nucleotides downstream of the S gene initiation codon. The PRCV genome from the ORF-3 gene to the poly (A) tail was sequenced for comparison to TGEV in order to identify other potential differences between the two viruses. Four ORFs were identified that showed 98% similarity to the TGEV ORF-4, M, N and ORF-7 genes. No other deletions or any PRCV specific sequences were identified.",

            "text": "Porcine respiratory coronavirus; Transmissible gastroenteritis virus; Coronavirus; Spike; Membrane protein; Nucleoprotein Porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV) appeared about 1984 and rapidly spread throughout the pig population in several, if not all, European countries where it now persists enzootically (Pensaert et al., 1986) and was recently isolated in the United States (Wesley et al., 1990a) . The virus, initially isolated in Belgium (Pensaert et al., 1986) and in Britain (Brown and Cartwright, 1986) , produced serological responses following infection of pigs that could not be distinguished from transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), by available diagnostic tests. The most striking difference between the two viruses was seen in their pathology. PRCV grows principally in the respiratory tract, producing mild or no clinical signs (Pensaert et al., 1986; Pensaert, 1989; O'Toole et al., 1989; Cox et al., 1990) , although, Van Nieuwstadt and Pol (1989) found that a Dutch isolate of PRCV intranasally inoculated into SPF pigs caused a fatal pneumonia. In contrast, although TGEV can grow in the respiratory tract, the virus preferentially grows in the enterocytes covering the tips of the villi in the small intestine, causing diarrhoea and dehydration resulting in high morbidity and mortality in neonatal pigs.",

            "text": "The molecular characterisation of a British isolate of PRCV has been undertaken with the aim of identifying differences between the PRCV and TGEV genomes which may be linked to the different tropisms and pathogenicities of the two viruses. Initial work found that: (1) the putative leader RNA sequences present on the viral RNA species, postulated to be involved in transcription of the mRNA species, were identical for TGEV and PRCV : (2) two of the PRCV mRNA species, 2 and 3, were smaller than the corresponding TGEV species Page et al., 1991): (3) sequencing studies on the PRCV genome, corresponding to the 5'-end of TGEV mRNA 3, identified several small deletions (84 nucleotides) resulting in the loss of the potential TGEV ORF-3a gene (Page et al., 1991) . However, the 84 nucleotides deleted did not account for the size difference, about 600 nucleotides, observed between TGEV and PRCV mRNA 2 nor did the deletions explain the differential binding of the MAbs. In this paper we present sequence data of the PRCV S gene to identify any variation to the TGEV S gene that would account for the size difference of mRNA 2 and the differential reaction of the MAbs and the sequence of the PRCV genome from the ORF-3 gene to the 3' poly (A) tail to identify any other variations in the PRCV genome.",

The size difference, 84 bp, in PRCV fragment E was due to the several small deletions reported by Page et al. (1991) . Fig. 2 . The nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of the carboxyl-terminus of the lb polymerase and S genes, including the ORF-3a pseudogene, from PRCV 86/137004.

The rest of the deduced amino acid sequence of the PRCV S protein showed 98% similarity to the TGEV S protein. The 5'-end region of the PRCV S gene from a second British isolate of PRCV, strain 86/135308, was cloned and sequenced and found to have an identical deletion. The first 20 amino acids of the PRCV S protein were identical to those found on TGEV of which the first 16 fulfil the criteria for a eukaryotic signal sequence with the potential cleavage site between the glycine (16) and aspartic acid (17) residues (Fig. 2) . This 1 c eavage site has been confirmed, for the avirulent Purdue strain of TGEV, by N-terminal amino acid sequencing of the S protein isolated from virions .

However, an in frame fusion at nucleotide 4284 (Fig, 2) resulted in 11 extra amino acids at the C-terminal end of the PRCV pseudogene product which were identical to the amino acids found at the end of ORF-3a from the Miller strain of TGEV (Wesley et al., 1989) . Work by Page et al. (1991) has shown that PRCV has no mRNA species with an ORF equivalent to TGEV ORF-3a at the 5'-end indicating that a gene product equivalent to TGEV ORF-3a will not be produced by PRCV though part of this potential TGEV gene appears as a pseudogene in the PRCV genome.",

The initiation codon of ORF-4 was preceded by the hexameric sequence, CTAAAC, and the initiation codons of the M, N and ORF-7 genes were preceded by the heptameric sequence, ACTAAAC.",

            "text": "In this study the 3'-end of the genome from a British isolate of PRCV was cloned and sequenced. The region analysed consisted of 7822 nucleotides and extended from the 3'-end of the lb subunit of the PRCV polymerase gene to the start of the poly(A) tail. Previous work Page et al., 1991) had shown that two of the PRCV mRNA species, mRNA 2 and mRNA 3, were smaller than the corresponding TGEV species. We concluded that PRCV mRNA 3 was smaller due to the creation of a new putative RNA-leader binding site upstream of a gene equivalent to the TGEV ORF3b gene with the loss of the putative RNA binding site upstream of TGEV ORF-3a. The new putative RNA-leader binding site resulted in a PRCV mRNA 3 species, about 200 nucleotides smaller than the equivalent TGEV mRNA, with a gene equivalent to TGEV ORF-3b at the 5'-end. The study also identified several small deletions, 84 nucleotides in total, in the PRCV genome corresponding to the 5'-end of TGEV mRNA 3. Two of the deletions were in the area corresponding to the potential TGEV gene, ORF-3a, resulting in the loss of this potential gene in PRCV, although part of the gene remained as a pseudogene. This observation was confirmed on a second British isolate (Page et al., 1991) and by Rasschaert et al. (1990) for a French isolate of PRCV indicating that it may be a common feature of PRCV. However, these small deletions could not account for the smaller size of PRCV mRNA 2. This was due to a major deletion of 672 nucleotides, corresponding to 244 amino acids, equivalent to amino acid residues 5 to 229 on the TGEV S protein following cleavage of the membrane signal (Fig. 4) . The deletion was shown to be present on two British isolates of PRCV and a French isolate indicating that this deletion may also be a common feature of PRCV. A cDNA probe, pD24, corresponding to amino acids 66 to 154 of the S protein from TGEV (Miller strain) reacted with the Miller and Purdue-115 strains of TGEV but not to FIPV, feIine enteric coronavirus (FECV), canine coronavi~s (CCV) or PRCV (strain ISU-1) isolated from a pig in Indiana, U.S.A. (Bae et al., 1991) . On the other hand a cDNA probe, pE21, corresponding to amino acids 325 to 451 of the Miller S protein, reacted with both TGEV strains, PRCV (ISU-l), FIPV, FECV and CCV. The region of the Miller S gene corresponding to probe pD24 was within the region deleted from PRCV implying that the American isolate of PRCV may also contain the S gene deletion. The sequence data presented in this study showed that the gene encoding the PRCV ORF-lb polymerase subunit is directly upstream of the S gene, in a similar position as observed for TGEV, with no intervening ORFs, in contrast to bovine coronavirus (BCV) and MHV where other genes or pseudogenes are present. Therefore the results presented in this paper and from previous work indicate that the order of viral genes in PRCV was 5'-[lb-S-3-4-M-N-71-3' whereas TGEV has the gene order 5'-[lb-S-3a-3b-4-M-N-7]-3'. The sequence data also showed that PRCV had only diverged by about 4% when compared to TGEV sequence data.",

Fleming et al. (1986) indicated that the MHV S protein encoded the determinants required for binding to susceptible cells. Comparison of the S protein amino acid sequences from MHV strains, JHM (Schmidt et al., 1987) and A59 (Luytjes et al., 1987) , identified an 89 amino acid deletion in the JHM sequence. Comparison of the S protein sequence from MHV-4 and several neuro-attenuated variants of MHV identified a polymorphic region with respect to deletions ranging from 142 to 159 amino acids (Parker et al., 1989) . The S protein from MHV-4 had an insert of 141 amino acids when compared to MHV JHM. These observations indicate that deletions in the S protein of coronaviruses may be a natural way of altering the tropism and concurrently the pathogenicities of the viruses. The exact mechanism for the deletion events is not known, there is no evidence for repeat sequences or secondary structures allowing the jumping of the polymerase. There is evidence that some coronaviruses may undergo recombination events and this mechanism cannot be ruled out for the introduction of specific deletions within areas of the genomes.",

Due to the deletions in the PRCV genome a gene equivalent to TGEV ORF-3a was present as a pseudogene, but interestingly, the C-terminal end of the gene was the same as the Miller strain. An avirulent small plaque variant of the Miller strain was shown to have 462 nucleotides deleted eliminating ORF-3a (Wesley et al., 1990b) . These observations indicate that ORF-3a is not needed for propagation of TGEV in vitro and in vivo but whether it plays some role in the pathogenicity of TGEV has yet to be elucidated.",

It is interesting that the mRNA4 species, encoding this gene, is the lowest abundance mRNA in all TGEV and PRCV strains examined to date, which might be due to the loss of the adenosine residue at the 5'-end of the putative RNA-leader binding site.",

The ORF-7 gene product has been detected in TGEV (Garwes et al., 1989) and PRCV infected cells using antisera raised against a synthetic oligopeptide, derived from the TGEV ORF-7 sequence, indicating that this gene product has a function in viral replication. Both the TGEV and PRCV ORF-7 gene product sequences have a high similarity to the penultimate ORF in FIPV (De Groot et al., 1988) indicating that this gene may be indicative for the TGEV family of coronaviruses.",
