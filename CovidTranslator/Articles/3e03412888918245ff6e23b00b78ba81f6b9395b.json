In addition, data on high-risk casual contact groups commuting in crowded trains and buses were obtained from a census on transportation modes and introduced into the model. Observational data from previous pandemics were used for the epidemiological parameters. Results Both TAP and STAP interventions were highly effective in suppressing the spread of infection during the early period of an outbreak, but STAP was inferior to TAP in terms of the ripple effect of the administration of antiviral drugs. School closure and restraint were able to bring about a delay in the peak of infection. The combination of TAP, school closure, and restraint interventions were highly effective in decreasing the total number of patients and shortening the epidemic period.",

Since 2003, about 450 cases of avian influenza A (H5N1) infection in humans have been reported in 15 countries, mainly in Southeast Asia [2] . In the study reported here, we have attempted to predict the effectiveness of intervention strategies against an epidemic of a novel influenza that will be caused by new strains of influenza achieving the same transmission ability in humans as avian influenza A (H5N1) by simulating various scenarios targeting Sapporo city, the capital of Hokkaido in Japan, with a population of about 1.9 million. Influenza A (H1N1), which is a new flu virus of swine origin, was first detected in Mexico in March 2009 [3] and has spread rapidly across the globe. A total of 209,438 cases of influenza A (H1N1) infection in over 170 countries, including 2,185 deaths, had been officially reported by late August 2009 [4] . The Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare of Japan [5] designed a ''Pandemic Influenza Preparedness Action Plan'' which, among other measures, includes the administration of antiviral drugs and school closure in the case of an influenza pandemic.",

The combination of three interventions-TAP, school closure, and restraint-would decrease the number of total patients to 0.02% of that with a no-intervention situation and would be highly effective in suppressing infection. In comparison, although the combination of TAP with only school closure or restraint would have some degree of effectiveness in reducing the number of patients, this strategy would be unable to shorten the epidemic period. The results of this study will be helpful in planning intervention strategies against a future influenza pandemic.",

In this model, it was assumed that the rate of crisis was 67% on average, while the other cases were asymptomatic on the basis of the surveillance of avian influenza A (H5N1) infection [16] , and that asymptomatic cases had half the infectivity of symptomatic cases [9] . A confirmative rate in all infections was defined by the ratio of patients who sought medical care and were diagnosed with a novel influenza. Because many cases of avian influenza A (H5N1) appeared to have severe symptoms with vomiting and diarrhea [17] , the confirmative rate was assumed to be higher, at 60%. The illness attack rate is different among different types of viruses [18] , with that of the ''Asian flu'' A (H2N2) being much higher in children than in adults [19] ; in contrast, the illness attack rate of the ''Hong Kong flu'' A (H3N2) was approximately the same among all age groups [20] . The illness attack rate of swine flu A (H1N1) virus has been reported to be twice as high in children as in adults [21] . A study of the sporadic transmissions of avian influenza A (H5N1) virus from birds to humans revealed that children are more susceptible to this virus than adults [2] . Because the age-specific illness attack rate of avian influenza A (H5N1) was similar to that of ''Asian flu'' A (H2N2) [22] , this model adopted the estimated values in the ''Asian flu'' [10] as the age-specific illness attack rate. The mortality in ''Spanish flu'' A (H1N1) in 1918-1919 showed a W-shaped curve, i.e., it was high not among infants and elderly people but also among young adults (25-34 years), an age group which usually has a very low mortality with seasonal influenza [23, 24] . Although the profile for a future influenza pandemic is unclear, we assumed that a novel influenza infection would cause a high mortality similar to the situation of the ''Spanish flu'' A (H1N1) [24] . The age-specific illness attack and mortality rates in this model are presented in Table 1 .",

As treatment, a person must be treated with two tablets of oseltamivir a day for a course of 5 days for treatment; as prophylaxis, treatment consists of one tablet a day over a course of 7-10 days. Antiviral efficacy lasts only during the course, and no residual effect remains thereafter. The administration of antiviral drugs alleviates symptoms, reduces infectiveness, shortens the infectious period as a treatment effect, and also prevents infection as a prophylactical effect [26, 27] . Longini et al. [10] estimated the effects of administering the antiviral drugs that were also adopted in this model and found: (1) the illness attack rate in susceptible persons dosed with antiviral drugs for prophylaxis decreased to 0.30 on average compared with those without dosing (relative susceptibility = 0.30); (2) the probability of developing symptoms of influenza in infected persons dosed with antiviral drugs for prophylaxis decreased to 0.60 on average compared with those without dosing; (3) the infectiousness of infected persons dosed with antiviral drugs for treatment or prophylaxis decreased to 0.62 on average compared with those without dosing (relative infectiousness = 0.62); (4) the infectious period in infected persons dosed with antiviral drugs for treatment or prophylaxis was reduce to 1 day compared with those without dosing.",

There are also many commuters to school and work between wards during the daytime, which leads to the mass movement of people on a daily basis [28] . To simulate the situations of an influenza epidemic on a realistic basis, we adopted an IBM that can reflect the heterogeneous population structure for the targeted area, in which each individual was assigned his/her personal information, such as age, household, residence district, social activity group, and casual contact group. The age structure in Sapporo city [28] is shown in Fig. 1 .

The age-specific rates of the enrollment of college students and employment were determined based on data in the School Basic Survey [30] and the Employment Status Survey [31] .

Two kind of untraceable casual contact groups were considered: a low-risk group who came into contact with other people at markets, in the neighborhoods, etc. and a high-risk group who used public transportation facilities, such as crowded trains and buses. The ratio of high-risk casual contact groups was set at 38% on average in all casual contact groups based on a census of the mode of transportation [29] .

The average contact rate in a playgroup was set to be higher than that in other social activity groups because children spent more time in close proximity to each other at a day nursery. The usual average contact rate in the low-risk casual contact group was set to be quite low because such contacts occur accidentally during outings [12] . On the other hand, the average contact rate in high-risk casual contact groups, such as while commuting on crowded trains or buses, was assumed to be 30-fold higher than that in the low-risk casual contact group. This was assessed by the average commuting time to school and work (an hour per day) [33] . The average contact rates for every group are tabulated in Table 2 . Because it is difficult for symptomatic patients to follow their usual behavioral pattern [34] , it was assumed that a symptomatic patient had a different behavioral pattern from the day after onset; a symptomatic patient retreats to the home, thereby exposing only his/her family [35] .",

In this model, it was assumed that a patient with symptoms would be treated with an antiviral drug just being diagnosed with a novel influenza infection, that all members of his/her household would be dosed with an antiviral drug for prophylaxis on that same day of diagnosis or thereafter, and that a person belonging to the same social activity group as the diagnosed patient would be traced, if possible, and treated with an antiviral drug within a few days of contact [12] . In this strategy, no members of the casual contact group could be traced. One of the advantages of TAP intervention is the small amount of antiviral drugs that are distributed for prophylaxis. The model limits the possible number of symptomatic cases for whom members of the social activity group can be traced for close contact to ten persons for each ward per day because of the limited capacity of the healthcare center (only one center for each ward in Sapporo city) [32] . During the swine flu A (H1N1) outbreak in Japan, not all of the persons in close contact with an infected person could be traced and, moreover, some traced persons refused to take antiviral drugs [36] . Various situations with respect to the proportion of identifiable close contact persons (30, 50, and 70%) and necessary tracing periods (2, 4, and 6 days) were examined.",

Therefore, high-risk casual contact groups based on commuters among wards were introduced into the model. On the condition that the effective reproduction number R t = 1.6, the baseline scenario showed that, on average, 58% of the entire population in the 100-trial simulations would be infected, including the 19% who would be asymptomatic. In past pandemics, the basic reproductive number (R 0 ) was estimated to be 2.0-3.0 for ''Spanish flu'' A (H1N1) [38] and 1.68 for ''Asian flu'' A (H2N2) [35] . For the swine flu A (H1N1) in 2009, R 0 has been estimated to be 1.4-1.6 [21] and 2.2-3.1 [3] based on data originating from the epidemic in Mexico and to be 2.2 based on the epidemic in Japan [39] .

            "text": "School closure and restraint brought about a delay in the peak and a decrease in incidence at the peak. However, it is actually difficult to implement school closure for such a long period, as was assumed in this model, where closure would be continued until no further patients were detected in the ward. Therefore, the effectiveness of school closure may be overestimated. In the outbreak of swine flu A (H1N1) in Japan in 2009, it was reported that the rapid spread of infection disrupted medical institutions [36] . Implementing a policy of school closure and restraint may be one approach to preventing an acute disruption of services at medical institutions. However, school closure also brings about the long-term absence of parents from work, which leads to economic loss [40] . The importance of restraint was recognized by only 46.2% citizens in Japan and the loss of precautions against infection may spread rapidly providing that a novel influenza infection has a low mortality [37] ; therefore improved recognition of the necessity of restraint is needed. The specific combination of the three interventions TAP, school closure, and restraint was shown to be the most effective of all the combined interventions (scenarios 1-5) in terms of suppressing infection. It resulted in a average decrease in total patients to 0.02% of that of the baseline scenario because of concomitantly preventing the spread of infection at an early stage by prophylaxis and decreasing infection risk by school closure and restraint. On the other hand, the combination of prophylaxis with antiviral drugs (TAP/STAP) with either school closure or restraint would reduce the amount of patients to some extent but would not be able to shorten the epidemic period because the influenza infection would be spread among people, unlike the combination of prophylaxis with both school closure and restraint.",

It has been reported that the spread of the infections made it difficult for doctors to diagnose swine flu A (H1N1) cases and that it was also hard to trace persons in close contact during this outbreak [36] . In contrast, STAP is easy to implement because antiviral drugs are distributed only at schools, although STAP does have a weak ripple effect due to drug wastage. Therefore, it is necessary to improve the methods of distribution in STAP, such as its range and frequency.",
