The movement of the COVID-19 virus into the brain through the cribriform plate near to the olfactory bulb could be a route that would enable the virus to enter and influence the brain. Furthermore, the findings such as anosmia or hyposmia in an uncomplicated early stage COVID-19 patient should necessitate a thorough assessment for CNS involvement 17 .",

There is a significant correlation between anosmia and COVID-19 positivity in different provinces (Spearman correlation coefficient: 0.87, P-Value <0.001; figure-Correlation of anosmia and COVID-19 positivity in different provinces of Iran.

Also 83.38 of this patients had decreased taste sensation in association with anosmia. The other clinical findings are summarized in table-1. Approximately, 10.55% of responders had a history of a trip out of home town before anosmia and about 1.1% of participants were hospitalized due to respiratory problems recently. From the family point of view; in 12.17% of responders one of the close relatives has had a history of severe respiratory disease in recent days, at least one of their family members was hospitalized respiratory problem in 7.35% of all and in 48.23% of them at least one of their family members has had recent history of anosmia.At the time of response to questions the range of duration of anosmia onset was from 0 (the same day of onset) till 30 days (11.33\u00b16.81, median=10.00) and more than 85% of responders did not use any drug for anosmia.Use of a numerical scale which coded as 0 (no smell/taste, significantly decreased quality of life) to 10 (full smell/taste, normal quality of life) showed that significant number of patients had smell and taste problem at the time of filling the questionnaire (figures 2 and 3) and quality of life was obviously affected due to anosmia (figure 4).",

Although the exact pathophysiology of post viral anosmia is unclear, but injury could probably happen at the level of the neuro-epithelium of olfactory receptor cells in the nasal roof or in central olfactory routs, however, because of the accessibility of the olfactory cleft, many studies have focused on the neuro-epithelial changes in patients with post-viral olfactory dysfunction. Various animal studies have explained that different viruses could damage central olfactory routs and other regions of the brain 13-16 .
