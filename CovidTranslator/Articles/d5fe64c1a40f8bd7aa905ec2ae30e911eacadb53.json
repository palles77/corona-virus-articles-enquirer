The sequences for pre-hybridizing both oligo and target DNA are designed to be fully complementary with their shared DNA probe in a coaxial stacking configuration; i.e. they hybridize immediately alongside each other along the continuous complement probe strand. The pre-hybridizing oligo and target DNA are differentiated by being labeled with two distinct fluorescent dyes, and the cooperative effect on hybridization efficiency is investigated through the comparison of the stacking and individual hybridization configurations based on the detection signals of the labeling dyes. The results show that the pre-hybridization of a DNA oligo enhances the subsequent hybridization efficiency of the target-DNA coupling onto the same probe. The efficiency is enhanced if the hybridization position occurs at a site close to the substrate surface. #",

Hong et al. (2005) recently presented a nano-size substrate surface to confine probes within a spatial region to control non-specific hybridization. All of these efforts have focused on using complicated molecule-level techniques to improve the hybridization efficiency.

The target was then spread over the chip surface and covered with a TaKaRa TM spaced cover to form a flat reaction slit chamber. Care was taken to avoid creation of trapped air bubbles. The chip was then enclosed in a humid box and incubated at 50 8C for 2 h. The melting temperatures of the target sequences, cRAFL09-Cy3 (17 mer) and cBac-alP1-Cy5 (60 mer), were about 49 8C and 72 8C, respectively. To ensure hybridization efficiency as well as sequence specificity, hybridization temperatures in this study were chosen as 20 8C below melting temperatures of the targets, i.e. around 30 8C and 50 8C, respectively. However, technically, there was no way to hybridize the two targets at two temperatures as they simultaneously existed on the same slide. Therefore, we understood that the hybridization of the 17 mer target at 50 8C was unfavorable, and without the optimal hybridization temperature, Cy3-labeled target would not receive the maximal signal intensity. The fluorescent signals in this study were, however, mainly focused on their relative variation from case to case. Through comparison of various hybridization scenarios at a fixed temperature, it was found that lower intensity readings would not hinder the trend of relative signal variation.",

Once the fluorescent images were generated, the software, GenePix Pro 4.1, was executed to analyze the images. It was set to generate a 6 \u00c2 4 circle array to cover all micro-arrayed spots to measure the fluorescent signal. The software then automatically saved the analyzed data as excel-format files.

Fig. 3 shows the results for cRAFL09-Cy3 and cBac-alP1-Cy5 individually hybridized with their corresponding probes. The counter-intuitive negative correlation between probe concentration and intensity shown in this figure essentially came from the densely immobilized probes restricting the access of target samples to their complementary binding sites. Comparing these two curves in Fig. 3(a) , one may also find that the hindrance effect becomes manifest when the binding sites are located close to the chip surfaces. This site-dependent effect, however, almost disappears for the much larger sized samples labeled with Cy5, as indicated in Fig. 3(b) . This is because the whole probe is almost entirely hybridized, so that the location of the binding site on the probe is no longer an important issue. However, further investigation of the effect of probe concentrations on the molecular hindrance should be conducted if a more complete conclusion is desired.",

As shown in the figure, with the pre-hybridization of cRAFL09-Cy3, the targeted Cy5 intensities of both hybridized probes dramatically increases up to 87% higher than those of the corresponding hybridization of bare probes shown in Fig. 3(b) . This remarkable intensity increase could be attributed to the steric void space created around the bare section of the probe, after the Cy3-labeled sample hybridized, to facilitate the docking of the subsequent Cy5-labeled samples to their binding site in the restricted environment. This demonstration implies that the pre-hybridization of a smaller sized target on the top zone of probes could result in detection-intensity amplification. In addition, from comparison of the two Cy3 curves in Figs. 3(a) and 4(a), one may observe that the Cy3 intensity of probe #2 dramatically drops up to 69% due to the subsequent Cy5-sample hybridization, but intensity of probe #1 has minimal change. The pre-hybridized sample located on the top zone (probe #2) is sacrificed to dissociate from the probe during the subsequent hybridization, however this dissociation is not evident for probe #1. Therefore, the smaller pre-hybridized samples would be easier to dissociate into the free buffer phase above the immobilized probes than into the restricted environment close to the chip surface. Another possibility causing the intensity decrease was the ddH 2 O rinse at the end of each wash. ddH 2 O is salt free and provides no counter ion; hence, there is no charge shielding for the negatively charged DNA sequences and may cause the DNA duplex to be denaturized.",
