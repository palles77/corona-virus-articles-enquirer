In response to \"the alarming levels of spread and severity\", the World Health Organization (WHO) has characterized COVID-19 as a pandemic 10 . This is the first pandemic caused by a coronavirus. Coronaviruses (CoV) are a large family of RNA viruses that cause a variety of mild and severe diseases in humans and animals 11 . Prior to the COVID-19, there were two severe outbreaks of human coronavirus diseases in the past two decades, the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] Super-spreading events, by which an individual patient spread an infection to a large number of susceptible people, were associated with the outbreaks of SARS and MERS [19] [20] [21] [22] . While case clusters with human-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV-2 have been reported [3] [4] [5] [23] [24] [25] , it remains unknown whether super-spreading events occurred in the outbreak of COVID-19. Here, we conducted a retrospective study and identified a super-spreading chain of transmission associated with COVID-19.",

The severe cases showed at least one of the following presentations: (1) Respiratory distress, Respiratory rate (RR) 30 times/min; (2) At rest, oxygen saturation 93%; (3) Arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO 2 ) /Fraction of Inspired Oxygen (FiO 2 ) 300mmHg (1mmHg=0.133kPa). Patients who had close contact with the index patient were defined as secondary cases. Patients who contracted the disease from the secondary cases were classified as tertiary cases. Laboratory investigations: The routine laboratory investigations were performed by the certified clinical diagnostic laboratories inside the designated hospitals. The RT-PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2 were conducted by the Standard Operation Procedures published previously 28,29 . Serum specific IgM and IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 were detected using the immunoassay kit provided by the YHLO Biotech Co., Ltd. (Shenzhen, China) and the fully-automated chemiluminescence immunoassay analyzer (UniCel DxI800, Beckman Coulter, Inc., USA) according to the instructions of the manufacturers. The immune activities were measured as a relative light unit (RLU). The analyzer automatically converts the RLU from the immunoassay into an absolute unit by fitting the standard master calibration curve. A cutoff value of 10.0 AU/ml is considered as positive for both antibodies. analysis: For statistical analysis, all of the continuous variables were performed byShaprio-wilk test and Levene test to analyze normality and homogeneity. Continuous variables were expressed as median (IQR) and compared with T test or Mann-Whitney U test. Categorical variables were expressed as number (n/N%) and compared by \u03c7\u00b2 test, continuity-adjusted \u03c7\u00b2 test author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.",
