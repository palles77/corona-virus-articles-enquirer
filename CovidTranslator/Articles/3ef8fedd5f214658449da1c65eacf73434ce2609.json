By the end of the period, all patients remaining in the ICU had been in the ICU for at least 2 weeks, and there were no further admissions with SARS. During the study period, only patients with SARS or suspected to have SARS were admitted to our ICU. The layout of the ICU is shown in Fig. 1 . The ICU is normally a 22-bed adult multidisciplinary facility, but for 2 days during the first week of the epidemic, the capacity was increased to 24 beds by converting one of the four-bed cubicles into a six-bed cubicle. The number of air changes per hour was 15.6 in open patient areas, 16.9 in isolation rooms and 16.1 in offices. Seventy percent of exhaust air was recycled, except in isolation rooms, where 76% was recycled. Recycled air was filtered prior to recirculation. The quoted efficiency of the filters was 95% of 0.3 \u00b5m saline particles. Isolation rooms were either not used for isolation or were used for protective isolation of patients in whom the diagnosis of SARS was unclear. The nurse-to-patient ratio was 1:1. The following data were collected from patient notes and charts by a trained research nurse: patient demographic data and factors that might affect the rate of transmission of SARSduration of invasive mechanical ventilation, place of intubation, ICU length of stay, number of days with diarrhoea and days from symptom onset to ICU admission. Diarrhoea was defined as two or more loose bowel motions in a calendar day. Duration of exposure to SARS patients was obtained from nursing and medical rosters. Only staff on the roster solely to work in the ICU were included in the study. Time for rest periods was taken into account when calculating number of exposure hours. The exposure hours therefore reflect time spent in contaminated areas of the ICU. All staff who became infected were questioned shortly after becoming infected, to obtain the data presented in Table 1 . All other staff who worked in the ICU during the study period were asked, after the end of the study period, to give a sample of blood to test for SARS seroconversion, to detect asymptomatic infection. Written informed consent was obtained from all staff who agreed to testing.",

Initial fit testing involved a qualitative fit test, with a subsequent quantitative test for those who failed the qualitative test. Staff for whom an adequate fit could not be achieved with a N95 or N100 mask were issued powered air-purifying respirators. A nurse was stationed at the entrance of the ICU to ensure compliance, and staff were encouraged to ensure each other's safety by pointing out protocol errors. Entry and exit from the ICU were segregated. Hoods were the only additional personal protective equipment used for high-risk procedures, such as intubation. Patients were given oxygen at flow rates of up to 15 l/min via simple and reservoir face masks. Venturi-type masks were not used.",

            "text": "The majority of cases of healthcare worker infection occurred early in the outbreak (Table 1) , with three of five cases becoming symptomatic within 10 days of admission of the first patient with SARS. The average incubation period of SARS is 6 days, with a range of 2-16 days [1, 10] . This strongly suggests that the three healthcare workers who became symptomatic within 10 days of admission of the first patient with SARS were infected in the first few days of exposure, when the protective strategies were being developed and vigilance in the correct use of protective equipment was probably lowest. Thereafter, only two members of staff became infected. None of the staff who agreed to testing showed evidence of asymptomatic infection. Our data suggest that, with adequate infection control measures, the risk to healthcare workers in ICU may not be as high as earlier reports suggested [2, 3, 4] . Although significant asymptomatic infection amongst untested staff remains a possibility, this is unlikely, as other data suggest subclinical infection is rare [11, 12] .",

A zero infection rate has been reported by a Singapore ICU that admitted 39 patients with SARS following strict imposition of infection control procedures [13, 14] . This unit used an even higher level of protection, using negative-pressure isolation rooms for each patient and powered air-purifying respirators. In contrast, data from a Toronto hospital, in which personal protective equipment was only inconsistently used by a substantial proportion of staff, showed that eight out of 32 critical care nurses exposed to three patients developed SARS. This occurred despite relatively short exposure times (40-935 min) [3] .",

            "text": "One of the difficulties in determining the effectiveness of infection control measures in SARS is the bimodal nature of spread with the existence of \"super-spreading\" incidents, whereby, one individual infects many others, while many individuals do not infect any others [15, 16] . Different rates of infection may simply reflect the presence or absence of \"super-spreading\" events and may be unrelated to infection control measures. Data from a hospital in Vietnam which treated 33 patients over a 6-week period revealed that no staff became infected despite lax infection control measures during the first week of exposure [17] . It is therefore possible that our low infection rate merely reflects an absence of exposure to super-spreading events. However, we believe this unlikely. Firstly, excluding super-spreading events, SARS is moderately transmissible, with an estimated 2.7 secondary infections per case at the start of the epidemic [15] . Secondly, as discussed above, our patients were likely to be maximally infectious during their ICU admission. Thirdly, many of the individual components of our infection control measures (e.g., use of gloves, gowns, caps and masks) are associated with a decreased SARS infection risk [18, 19] . Fourthly, super-spreading events appear to be associated with older patient age, more severe illness, and larger number of close contacts [16] . Although our patients were relatively young, they were severely ill and, as hospitalised patients, had a large number of close staff contacts.",
