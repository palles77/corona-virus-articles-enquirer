In the presence of 2-mereaptoethanol, three major glyeopolypeptides, gp 180, gp69, gp25 (as a group of similar species) and one major non-glycosylated polypeptide p 58 were detected. The gp 69 is a DVIM specific glyeopolypeptide, in which the glycosidic moieties are linked to the core polypeptide through Nglycosidic bonds, and hence may be correlated with the short projections of the viral envelope. Ful'ther gpl40, which appears in the absence of reducing agents, is apparently a dimer of gp 69 held together by disulfide linkages. The gp 25 family, on the other hand, consists of four polypeptides, two of which axe not metabolically inhibited by tunicamyein suggesting that they are O-linked glycopolypeptides. DVIM seems to be serologically closely related to the MHV-S strain as shown by neutrMization.",

DVIM was found to be very closely related with the HMV-S strain. In addition, bilateral minor cross-reactions between DVIM and MHV-2, or MHV-3, were also observed. In contrast, DVIM showed only weak cross-reaction with MItV-4 (JItM). A strong unilateral cross-reaction was also detected between DVIM and the anti-MHV-2 serum. These results, therefore, showed that in general DVIi~{ is serologieally related to the other strains of murine coronaviruses, particularly to MHV-S. The approximate molecular weights of the virion polypeptides were determined by comparing their etectrophoretic mobilities with those of com-mercially available standards (BIO-RAD) in 7.5 per cent polyacrylamide tube gels, according to the procedure of MAIZ~L (8) . DVIM has four major polypeptides, with molecular weights of 180,000, 69,000, 58,000 and 25,000, respectively. One minor polypeptide with a molecular weight of 90,000 was detected in some preparat4ons. The smallest of the major polypeptide species produced a broad band or a group of three to four closely migrating bands. The PAGE profiles of DVIM were generally similar to those observed for other marine coronaviruses such as MHV-2, MHV-3, and MHV-4, except that one major band with a moh wt. of 69,000 was detected in DIVM virions exclusively. MHV-S strain also had a polypeptide with a moh wt. of 65,000 similar to the 69,000 of DVIM.",

In addition, it appears that gp25 consists of four polypeptides, W, X, Y and Z. Of these the small glycopolypeptide Y also disappeared completely. In contrast the synthesis of both W and X was not affected and Z was only partially a.ffected by this drug. These results, together with the ability of mannose to be incorporated into the polypeptide (Fig. 1 b) , indicated that (B) virion control Discussion The glycopeptide gp 180 appears to be equivalent to the largest glycoprotein, present in the well-characterized mouse hepatitis viruses, and we think it is a peplomerie protein in accordance with the findings of other investigators (7, 14, i5, 16, 17, 23) . Although the minor glycopolypeptide gp90 was weakly detectable in gels, it is also assumed to be a peplomerie protein and hence is probably associated with gp 180 b y noneovalent bonds (17) .",

Removal of the large projections of DVIM, by proteolytic digestions, resulted in the loss of both gp 180 and gp90 from the intact DVIM virions. However, the viral particles still retained their haemagglutinating activity and these correlated with the presence of gp 69 (data not shown). Therefore, this suggested a close relationship between the small granular projections and the viral haemagglutinating activity. We therefore speculate that gp69 is a structural component of the small granular projections which are located close to the envelope. We presume (Fig. 1 c) that gp69 is a subunit of the larger glyeoprotein gp 140, which is bound by disulfide linkages in an oligomerie structure. Interestingly, a similar disulfide linked glyeopolypeptide has been described for the porcine haemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus and for the bovine coronavirus, and it was suggested that this polypeptide may represent haemagglutinin (2, 5, 10, 11) . Generally, therefore, the haemagglutinating coronaviruses may share these oligomeric proteins as a distinctive structural feature in the form of small granular projections. Our studies also revealed that p58 was unaffected by protease treatment (data not shown) and hence were apparently protected by the viral envelope. This suggested that p58 was located internally and hence can be considered as a nueleoprotein as has been proposed by other workers (2, 3, 7, 14, 15, 23) .",

As was shown in Fig. 3 , this family of glyeoproteins consisted of four polypeptide species, designated W, X, \u00a5 any Z. In gels these polypeptides gave bands that corresponded with those reported by ROTTI~R et al. (13) and were comparable to the bands of gp26.5/E i, gp25.5/E 1, gp24.5/E i and p22/X of MHV-A59, respectively. Further, the synthesis of both W and X was not affected by tunieamycin treatment, suggesting that the carbohydrate side chains of these proteins may be linked to polypeptides through an O-glycosidic bonds (4, 9) . In fact, the evidence for the existence of this type of bonds in ])VIM was indicated by their sensitivity to alkali treatment under ~-elimination conditions (data not shown). In contrast, the synthesis of the Y protein as well as gp 180 and gp69 was completely inhibited by tunieamycin treatment. However, we failed to detect any aH-mannose following labelling, which is characteristic for the N-glyeosidic bond glycoprotein (9) , in the gp25 family. Therefore, at present we cannot define the type of glycosidic bonds in the Y protein. AeknoMed0ment",
