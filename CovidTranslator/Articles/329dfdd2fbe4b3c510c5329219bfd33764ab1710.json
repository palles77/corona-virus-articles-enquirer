            "text": "population. We report that domestication of the model yeast S. cerevisiae reprogrammed its life cycle entirely. We tracked growth, gamete formation and cell survival across many environments for nearly 1000 genome sequenced isolates and found a remarkable dichotomy between domesticated and wild yeasts. Wild yeasts near uniformly trigger meiosis and sporulate when encountering nutrient depletions, whereas domestication relaxed selection on sexual reproduction and favoured survival as quiescent cells. Domestication also systematically enhanced fermentative over respiratory traits while decreasing stress tolerance. We show that this yeast domestication syndrome was driven by aneuploidies and gene function losses that emerged independently in multiple domesticated lineages during the specie's recent evolutionary history. We found domestication to be the most dramatic event in budding yeast evolution, raising questions on how much domestication has distorted our understanding of this key model species.",

Domestication greatly contributed to human population expansion and development by releasing labour from food production, but also profoundly altered the domesticated species. Controlled breeding and artificial selection on the segregating genetic diversity created plant and animal crops that now differ drastically from those of their ancestors and wild relatives 1 . Selected traits recur across domesticated species 2 and, due to pleiotropy and linkage, often come with specific, non-desired side-effects. Human-created niches may also impose quasi-domestication and unintentionally favour some traits and genetic variants with side-effects linked to them 3 . Both domestication and quasidomestication therefore results in suites of co-evolving traits, known as domestication syndromes 4, 5 .",

Subsequent domestication for industrial or semi-industrial beer, dairy, rice, cocoa, coffee 7 , bread, palm sap and agave fermentation 8 transformed wild yeast lineages into specialized domesticated breeds [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] . Lab domestication and the subsequent use of budding yeast as a model organism resulted from efforts to breed pure, industrial beer strains 16 . Modern lab strains are genetic mosaics with genomes composed of DNA from diverse domesticated origins 17 . The continued existence of wild yeast not spoiled by extensive gene flow from feral domesticated yeast became accepted only recently 18, 19 . Wild strains are more diverse in terms of single nucleotide variation; domesticated lineages are instead distinguished by genome content variation in form of aneuploidies, polyploidies and the copy number of individual genes and chromosome segments [20] [21] [22] [23] . These structural and copy number variants in domesticated lineages may explain the high phenotypic variation among domesticated lineages and the unexpectedly large intraspecies phenotypic diversity in the species 9, 20, 21, 24 .",

            "text": "While the impact of domestication on the yeast genome is well described, its effect on the yeast biology is poorly understood. The life cycle of an organism represents the very core of its organismal properties, directly defining its fitness. Life cycle changes are therefore dramatic evolutionary events with far-reaching consequences. Budding yeast reproduces asexually under nutrient abundance, expanding its population size. Growing cells first privatize and use the most easily catabolized carbon and nitrogen by repressing mitochondrial respiration and the uptake and use of non-preferred sources 25 . When the preferred sources are consumed, the repression is relaxed and yeast switches to nonpreferred sources, including by respiring the produced ethanol. When an essential nutrient becomes scarce, cell growth and the asexual population expansion ceases. Diploid cells then either pass through meiosis and enter a haploid spore state 26 , shift from unicellular to multicellular filamentous organization 27 or enter into a quiescent G0 stage 28 . These transitions favour survival by repressing metabolism, reproduction and translation, mobilizing nutrients intracellularly by autophagocytosis, and protecting against external challenges [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] .",

Domesticated yeasts were better adapted to maltose, sucrose and higher concentrations of glucose (>0.5%), fructose (>0.5%) and xylose (>2%); all carbon sources that characterize human-made fermenting niches 38 . Domesticated yeasts also better used isoleucine and valine, as well as threonine, which can be catabolized into isoleucine. Isoleucine and valine are degraded in the fermentation induced 39 Ehrlich pathway by Bat1 and Bat2, while threonine is also anaerobically catabolized to propionate during fermentation. Wild yeasts were better adapted to most respiratory carbon sources (ethanol, glycerol) as well as to lower concentrations (up to 1%) of sugars; lower sugar concentrations promote respiration by relieving the glucose repression of respiratory genes 40 . Wild yeasts were also better at using citrulline, serine and alanine. The metabolism of these compounds produces fumarate or pyruvate (and through the latter: oxaloacetate), which are Krebs cycle intermediates intrinsically linked to respiration. In addition, since the replenishment of a cyclic pathway can be achieved by any anaplerotic reactions, the net result of the production of any of the Krebs cycle intermediates would entail a larger availability of precursors for other paths (such as the gluconeogenesis or the mitochondrial production of ATP) 41 . Wild yeasts also better catabolized glycine and phenylalanine.",

Because domesticated strains often carried ploidy variations, we next probed whether poly-or aneuploidy impaired sporulation. Tetraploid and triploid yeasts sporulated as often as diploid, and produced only marginally fewer asci at later time point (Fig. 3c) . In contrast, aneuploidy accounted for some of the early and late sporulation variation (Fig. 3c) . Multiple aneuploidies were worse than a single aneuploidy (Fig. 3c) , and chromosome gain were as bad as chromosome loss. We propose that the presence of extensive chromosomal aneuploidies explains the poor sporulation of the domesticated Ale and African beer clades, as sporulation genes in these strains appeared to be free of loss-of-function nucleotide variants (see below).",

After 7, 21, and 35 days we found nearly equal quiescence survival for wild and domesticated yeasts, with a small but significant advantage for domesticated yeasts in the richest environment (SDC, at days 21 and 35) that best resemble domestication niches (Fig. 4 panel B) .

            "text": "Domestication impairing yeast sporulation represents a truly seismic change to the biology of the organism. Firstly, loss of capacity to enter the yeast spore state, which offers long term survival when nutrients are scarce 30, 31 , leaves domesticated cells instead dependent on entering the G0 quiescence stage. Entry into quiescence also slows ageing and intrinsic death 62 , but much less so than sporulation (Fig. 2d) . Moreover, domesticated yeasts only marginally compensated for the sporulation loss by evolving extended quiescence life spans (Fig. 4b) . Domestication therefore caused a massive net drop in capacity to survive nutrient scarcity. This is likely to be detrimental in wild microhabitats, where nutrient scarcity is the rule rather than the exception for yeasts that lack motility and are unable to relocate when local nutrients are consumed. Secondly, sporulation entails transitioning from a higher to a lower ploidy state. Domesticated yeasts will have no or a much reduced capacity to achieve this shift. Because a lower ploidy state confer faster asexual reproduction in many environments 63 , this is likely to translate into a fitness cost. Third, loss of sporulation means loss of the capacity to form gametes and meiotic recombination. Recombination also occurs under yeast mitosis but at vastly lower rates 64, 65 . Thus, domestication near abolished or impaired the yeast capacity to combine beneficial variants into one genotype, to cleanse otherwise healthy genomes from deleterious mutations 66, 67 , to prevent their catastrophic accumulation through a ratchet mechanism 68 and to generate a sufficiently broad diversity of genotypes to fully exploit and adapt to multi-faceted wild niches 69 . Sexual recombination accelerates yeast adaptation 70 and the loss of sexual recombination is likely to be particularly costly in constantly changing wild niches where fast adaptation is key. Rare subclades of domesticated clades, in particular of the Wine/European lineage, are known to sometimes escape from their domestication niches and to survive as feral isolates in the wild. This is likely thanks to these strains retaining, or having re-acquired, a life cycle closer to that of wild yeast. Indeed, sporulation of feral subclades in the Wine/European clade is notably more efficient than that of other sub-clades (Supplementary fig. 2b ). Whereas purifying selection retains a functional sporulation machinery in all wild isolates, there is little doubt that non-feral domesticated strains with their impaired sporulation capacity, are strongly selected against in the wild.",

Domestication niches, such as grape must with a 20% glucose/fructose content, are often rich in easily fermented sugars. Ethanol production, which is the principle trait selected for in most domestication environments, depends on efficient fermentation of these sugars. Respiration of the sugar, or of the produced ethanol, is both counterproductive to high ethanol content and discouraged by high sugar and, later, low oxygen. The better beer yeast fermentation of malt sugars to ethanol 23 , is widely held to reflect domestication driven adaptation. In contrast, concentrated sugar is relative rare in wild niches and competition for it is fierce, with concentrations unlikely to often exceed the 0.5% threshold at which sugar fermentation kicks in. In contrast to in large industrial tanks where the oxygen is rapidly depleted, oxygen is also often freely available in natural yeast niches, allowing respiration. Second, we found sporulation genes to associate to clade specific loss-of-function variants in genes private to sporulation and meiosis. This is consistent with a neutral drift model, where asexual proliferation in domestication niches relaxes selection on superfluous sporulation and meiosis genes, leaving them free to accumulate mutations. Many of these variants affected the key meiosis specific transcription factors IME1 and NDT80 that are absolutely required for sporulation 72 , underscoring that there is little selective pressure to retain sporulation intact in domesticated isolates.",

Relaxed selection on sporulation may therefore indirectly lower the selection also for respiration, and this could partially account for the worse respiratory growth in domesticated lineages. Niche specific loss of superfluous genes, leading to pseudogenization and ultimately genome reduction, has been suggested to be the predominant driver of natural yeast evolution 21, 75, 76 . Domestication may simply be seen as directing and accelerating this pseudogenization process. A notable direct side-effect of relaxed selection on the sexual life cycle is that correct pairing and segregation of chromosomes during meiosis becomes irrelevant. This reduces selection against chromosomal rearrangements, aneuploidies and odd polyploidies that disturb these processes, allowing their accumulation in domesticated strains 20, 77 . This creates a knock-on effect, as their accumulation in domesticated strains reinforces the loss of the sexual cycle.",

However, we found neither to have altered the yeast life cycle, the core organism-level property of the species. Domestication therefore stands out as the most dramatic event in yeast evolution, being unique in having reprogrammed a central aspect of its organismal biology. Fundamental consequences of domestication on life cycles are not unique to yeast: domestication made banana (Musa sp.) seedless and parthenocarpic 80 and abolished seed and flower production in garlic (Allium sativum) 81 . In contrast to these species, however, yeast is not only industrially important but serves as one of our most widely used model species.

The negative effect of RIM15 loss on sporulation has been experimentally validated 21 . In French Dairy and French Guyana clades sporulation loss was associated with loss-of-function variants in the key meiotic master regulators NDT80 and IME1, as well as in the sporulation associated OSW2, MND2, SPR6, DOM34, AQY1 (French Dairy) and MPC54, DIT2, BMH2, DON1, NUD1 and AQY1 (French Guiana). Nine domesticated Wine/European strains sporulated efficiently, but had premature stop codons (SPO13 G86*; SPO12 K103*) and early frameshifts in the key tetrad formation genes SPO12 or SPO13 50 (Supplementary Fig. 4) and only formed dyads. Previously identified sporulation QTNs were mostly too rare in the sequenced global yeast population to affect sporulation variation overall, with e.g. TAO3 (E1493Q), SPO74 (C16A), MKT1 (G30D) present in 2, 0 and 2 isolates respectively. Sporulation QTNs in IME1 (L325M and A548G), MCK1 (C1112A), RSF1 (D181G), PMS1 (A122G) and FKH2 (A1498C) were more common (from 29 to 420 isolates with homozygous variants) but failed to associate with sporulation, consistent with their effects being restricted by epistasis to only a few genetic backgrounds 46 . Likely epistasis was e.g. found for HOS4 (A1384G) and SET3 (A1783T); while the 89 SET3 (A1783T) homozygotes sporulated better overall (median: +130%), HOS4 A1384G associated with enhanced sporulation only in SET3 (A1783T) homozygotes.",

How much of what we know about this key model species reflects, domestication rather than natural biology and how much has this influenced our understanding of biology at large? Material and methods Yeast strains. We used 987 globally sampled S. cerevisiae isolates, thereby capturing the spectrum of geographic and ecological sources, including both wild and domestication niches 20 . Strains were recently sequenced, their single nucleotide variant based population structure established, and most isolates assigned to one of 26 phylogenetic clades. Because individual domesticated isolates can escape into wild niches and individual wild isolates invade domestication niches, we assigned isolates as wild (n=58) or domesticated (n=574) based on the origin dominating (>66%) in their clade. Strains were labelled \"unassigned\" (n=355) if neither criteria were reached; however, we note that unassigned strains behave as domesticated for most traits here studied. For asexual growth, estimates all n=987 isolates were retained. For estimates of quiescence survival in plain water, n=485 domesticated, n=52 wild and n=289 unassigned isolates with sufficient cell counts, no aggregating and no sporulating isolates were retained. For estimates of quiescence survival in other environments, n=342 domesticated, n=48 wild and n=182 unassigned euploid diploid isolates with sufficient cell counts, no aggregation and not sporulating were retained. For sporulation estimates n=503 domesticated, n=54 wild and n=293 unassigned nonhaploid isolates capable of growth in the pre-sporulation medium were retained. Subsets of isolates were used in follow-up sporulation experiments, as indicated in text. Asexual growth. Clonal populations of all isolate were pre-cultivated as colonies in a 1536 array on top of solid agar (2%) plates containing synthetic complete (SC) medium (0.14% YNB, 0.5% ammonium sulfate, 0.077% Complete Supplement Mixture (CSM, Formedium), 2% (w/v) glucose and pH buffered to 5.8 with 1% (w/v) succinic acid and 0.6% (w/v) NaOH) 30\u00b0C. For alternative nitrogen sources, CSM was excluded and ammonium sulfate limited to 30 mg N/L to prevent nitrogen storage and subsequent growth on stored nitrogen. Pre-cultures were subsampled with short pins and subsamples transferred as 1536 arrays to experimental plates containing the medium of interest (background medium as above). For alternative carbon sources or concentrations, 2% glucose was replaced by the indicated carbon source at the indicated concentration. For alternative nitrogen sources, ammonium sulfate and CSM were replaced by the alternative nitrogen source at growth yield limiting concentrations (30 mg N/L). Cultivation using the Scan-o-matic platform 82 was performed in thermostatic cabinets at 30\u00b0C and constant, high humidity. Cells in each colony were counted at 20 min intervals using high-quality desktop scanners and Scan-o-matic 2.2 (https://github.com/Scan-o-Matic/scanomatic), with exact pixel intensity calibration and transformation into cell counts. Population size growth curves were established, smoothed and transformed into population doubling times (d) and total cell yields (y), as described 82 .To account for spatial variation within and between plates, fixed genotypes (the diploid hybrid DBVPG6756xYPS128) were included in every 4th of the 1536 colony positions on each plate, and their log2 d and y measures were used to normalize the corresponding d and y measures of adjacent colonies. We estimated the mean normalized log2 d and y in each environment for domesticated and wild isolates and called significant differences using a Mann-Whitney test with an FDR-adjusted \u03b1=0.05.Sporulation efficiency and spore viability.

Cells were washed (2x) twice with PBS to remove remaining YPD, and finally resuspended in 200 \u00b5L of PBS (day 0). For each sample and time point, we counted 10,000 cells in a FACS Calibur flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson) using the forward (FSC; cell size) and side (SSC; cell granularity) scatter to distinguish two cell populations: unsporulated, quiescent cells and spores present as smaller and less granular monads. We estimated the sporulation efficiency as the number of asci formed divided by the total cell count. Sporulation among detected asci was confirmed in a wild strain (AKN) by quantification of the promoter activity of SPS2, induced late in sporulation, using a SPS2-GFP fusion protein reporter 83 . Finally, the sporulation efficiency was visually confirmed in a subset of samples by microscopy (as above). Survival in quiescence. We estimated quiescence survival in plain water and in calorie rich and calorie restricted synthetic defined medium in two distinct sets of experiments. Quiescence survival in plain water: Isogenic cultures from n=485 domesticated, n=52 wild and n=289 unassigned isolates were independently grown overnight in liquid YPD in 96 well plates, diluted 1:100 in 200 \u00b5L of fresh YPD and incubated for 24 hours at 30\u00b0C. 20 \u00b5L of each culture were then transferred to 96 well plates containing 180 \u00b5L of phosphate saline buffer (PBS). Cells were washed (2x) and resuspended in 200 \u00b5L of PBS (day 0) for the rest of the experiment. Plates were sealed with adhesive aluminium foil and kept at 30\u00b0C. Quiescence survival in SDC and calorie restricted SDC: Isogenic cultures of n=342 domesticated, n=48 wild and n=182 unassigned euploid diploid isolates were independently grown overnight in liquid SDC (2% dextrose, 0.675% yeast nitrogen base (Formedium), 0.088% complete amino acid supplement (Formedium), pH buffered to 6.0 with 2.5 M NaOH), diluted 1:100 in 200 \u00b5L of either fresh SDC or calorie restricted SDC (0.5% dextrose instead of 2%) in 96 well plates. Plates were incubated at 30\u00b0C and the cells were kept in saturated media for the whole experiment. Aging was considered to start at saturation of the cultures, 72 h post-inoculation 84 . Quiescence survival measurements (all environments): chronological life span was measured as viable cells (%) by flow cytometry based on the uptake of the fluorescent molecules propidium iodide (PI) and YO-PRO-1 iodide (YP). Propidium iodide and YO-PRO-1 are membrane-impermeable nucleic acid binding molecules that enter into necrotic but not into alive cells. Therefore, non-fluorescent cells are alive, while fluorescent cells are not. YO-PRO-1 penetrates also into apoptotic cells 85,86 . At each indicated aging time point, 5 \u00b5L of cells were transferred into 100 \u00b5L of staining solution (Phosphate Buffer Saline + and FL-3 (PI; 488/10 nm excitation, 670 nm emission) channels. Experiments were run in a single replicate and data were normalized to 4 internal controls distributed in each plate. 10,000 cells per sample were analysed. Candidate gene lists: The candidate gene list for sporulation variants was constructed by including all genes belonging to seven GO:TERM categories: GO:0000710 (meiotic mismatch repair), GO:0007126 (meiotic nuclear division), GO:0007127 (meiosis I), GO:0030435 (sporulation resulting in formation of a cellular spore), GO:0030437 (ascospore formation), GO:0051321 (meiotic cell cycle) and GO:0060903 (positive regulation of meiosis I). The candidate gene list for chronological life span was constructed as in Matecic at al. 2010 87 . Loss-of-function variants: We used SnpEff 88 (v.4.1) and SIFT 89 (Sorting Intolerant from Tolerant; v.5.2.2) to predict single base variant effects. An in-house script was used to estimate small frameshifting indels of multiples other than three. Likely losses of gene function were called when such frameshifts, premature stop codons, or loss of either the predicted start or stop codon were found. Assuming loss-of-function variants to be completely dominated by functional variants, we called gene loss-of-function only when such variants were homozygotic.",
