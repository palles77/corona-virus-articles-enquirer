The consistency of the feces is liquid, or pastelike, adapting to the form of its receptacle. The frequency and volume of the excretions can be seen to increase within a highly variable range, starting with very slight diarrhea up to that which can put the patient's life at risk. The volume of feces in a healthy adult is almost 300 ml. Diarrhea's pathogenic mechanism is responsible for an acceleration of intestinal transit.",

It is usually a symptom of gastrointestinal infection, which can be caused by a variety of bacterial, viral and parasitic organisms. Infection is spread through contaminated food or drinking-water, or from person to person as a result of poor hygiene.'' Dr. Sherwood L. Gorbach states: ''Acute diarrhea is often defined as the occurrence of three or more unformed bowel movements a day or any number of such movements when accompanied by fever, abdominal cramps, or vomiting.'' While carrying out studies epidemiologists can use other operative definitions adapted to the objectives of each study, taking into account the sensitivity and specificity of the definitions in each case.",

Main symptoms usually remain for less than 7 days (but can persist up to 2 weeks at most); it can be accompanied by vomiting and fever, but it also presents a greater problem, the possibility of dehydration. It is a result of the alteration of absorption and secretion balance. Causal agents include rotavirus, Campylobacter, nontyphoidal Salmonella, enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli, Vibrio cholerae, and so on. b. Dysentery: When diarrhea is accompanied by visible traces of blood in the feces, it is called dysentery. It is a result of damage suffered by intestinal mucus in the colon ravaged by an external agent, such as Shigella dysenteriae, nontyphoidal Salmonella, Entamoeba histolytica, and Campylobacter. Rapid weight loss is the most frequent consequence. c. Persistent diarrhea: With a duration of more than 14 days, it can start as acute diarrhea or dysentery. It should not be confused with chronic diarrhea due to noninfectious causes. It can produce noticeable weight loss and a risk of dehydration. Causal agents include Shigella, enteroaggregative E. coli, Cryptosporidium, and Giardia.",

The resulting hypovolemic shock can cause renal failure, disorders in other organs, and in the most vulnerable patients it can prove to be fatal. The appearance of diarrhea results from confrontation between aggressive external elements (a causal agent's toxicity or virulence, the quantity of the inoculant dose) and the body's own defense mechanisms. Among the defense mechanisms combating infectious agents, the following can be highlighted: gastric acid, gastrointestinal mucus, intestinal motility, bile salts, regular intestinal bacteria, macrophage cells, lymphocyte cells, and type IgA immunoglobulin in the mucus. Additionally, there are genetic factors that can affect resistance to particular infections; for example, blood group 'O' individuals are at greater risk of suffering from cholera, whereas the socalled nonsecretory individuals, with certain FUT 2 gene mutations, are partially resistant to norovirus infection. Other specific external circumstances such as the ingestion of alcohol or (nonvolatile) red wine could act as protective factors against infection by Salmonella when the ingestion of the microorganism and those kind of drinks is almost simultaneous. There are few vaccines effective against diarrheal diseases. Recently, a vaccine against rotavirus has been authorized, which is expected to show positive results.",

Bad conditions of individual hygiene, nutrition, and existing public sanitation in many poor countries favor the presence of diarrhea. Even when incidences of the infection do not display such great geographic differences, in the case of some viruses, the indicators in terms of its lethality are noticeably different; for example, rotavirus is very frequent in all types of countries, but its severity (mortality rate) is greater in poor countries.

Faced with a similar clinical profile, a child does not have the same probability as an adult of receiving an etiological diagnosis: in the child's case it is more likely. The same happens with serious conditions in comparison to slight ones. The slight diarrheas often go without etiological diagnosis. This is also the case with conditions caused by agents that are not detected by the laboratory participating in the analysis. Age bias, age, and technical ability need to be considered when analyzing epidemiological statistics. However, epidemiological studies were performed in England and Holland at the end of 1990s and in the United States in 2001 and 2002, in which a thorough fecal examination of all patients was undertaken, independent of their age and the seriousness of their condition, including those patients who no longer showed symptoms of diarrhea. In these studies, fecal examination was also carried out in healthy control subjects, so that the frequency in which specific microorganisms appeared could be compared with asymptomatic subjects.",

Specialized laboratories can use more complex techniques that, generally, prove to be more sensitive and specific, but are also more expensive and difficult. Nevertheless, many of the coprocultures a standard laboratory requests and examines are negative. A negative result can be the consequence of the following reasons: diarrhea is not actually infectious, it is caused by an agent for which the laboratory has no data, there is a failure in the test sensitivity, the patient may have taken antibiotics, or there may have been problems in fecal transport. Cases that have returned negative results are a mixture of etiologies, and for that reason further investigation makes little sense. In the EDICS study (Study of Infectious Diarrhea in Castell\u00f3n) of risk factors in infantile diarrhea, no risk factors were found associated to the cases with a negative fecal analysis result. On the contrary, risk factors were found in cases of campylobacteriosis, salmonelosis, or rotavirus. This indeed suggests that the group of negatives is a mixture of different etiological cases without common origin and with few shared risk factors. The appearance of vomit as an initial symptom, the absence of fecal blood (macro-or microscopic,) and low PCR (reactive C protein) are signs suggestive of viral etiology, especially in children.",

On the contrary, Salmonella and, especially, norovirus more characteristically present themselves in the form of outbreaks.

This group of apparently sporadic cases (but which, in fact, are not sporadic) can only be detected by the existence of an exceptionally good monitoring system or by performing specific studies. Steen Ettenberg and other collaborators performed a specific study on cases registered throughout Denmark in the 1990s and found that 13.3% of Salmonella enteritidis, 10.4% of Shigella sonnei, 5.6% of Salmonella serotype Typhimurium, 3.2% of Campylobacter, and 2.0% of Yersinia enterocolitica cases belonged to this type of clusters, which is a large majority unknown to epidemiological monitoring systems. In absolute terms, the cases of campylobacteriosis were the most numerous due to the large amount of patients diagnosed with the infection in the last years of the study. In a much smaller study in Castell\u00f3n (Spain), 10 clusters of this type were identified after systematic investigation of coprocultures in an area of 250 000 inhabitants. Small family clusters of Campylobacter, S. enteritidis, rotavirus, and intestinal adenovirus were found. In addition to the etiology and level of aggregation, a third question arises: the source of infection and its mechanism of transmission. When the etiology is well known, the epidemiology of the agent involved is generally known. Table 2 summarizes some epidemiological characteristics of five infection sources and significant mechanisms of transmission. Figures 2 and 3 represent two outbreaks of diarrhea by norovirus in residential homes for the elderly; these charts clearly demonstrate two mechanisms of transmission. Figure 2 shows a specific outbreak transmitted by foods (foodborne point source outbreak), and Figure 3 shows an outbreak, beginning gradually and progressively exacerbating, in which the transmission mechanism was predominantly 'person to person' and environmental (surfaces, fomites). Figure 4 represents a simple theoretical diagram for the investigation of transmissible disease cases by using the ARMIGO system (agent, reservoir, mechanism of transmission, individual, groups, other people).",

First, a defined, open population with a specific exposure, which refers to people who only momentarily shared an exposure factor, for example, attending a shared dinner or banquet. Second, a defined, closed population with lasting exposure factors, for example, permanent residents within a closed institution, who continually share meals, places, and activities. And third, an indefinite population, with or without specific exposure, which occurs when there is no obvious relationship between people and they are implicated in an outbreak, solely by sharing an exposure factor distributed throughout the population. In the case of laboratory analysis, an epidemic is identified where some rare microorganism in unusually large numbers of people is detected in a fairly prolonged time frame. For example, an outbreak that occurred in the United States in the first half of 2008 was produced by Salmonella Saintpaul with the same genetic fingerprint that affected more than 500 people in 32 states. The epidemic was related to the consumption of tomatoes distributed throughout the country.

There are various groups of rotavirus capable of producing infections in humans. The vast majority of cases are children infected by group A rotavirus. Group B is related to diarrheas in adults and group C to slight diarrheas at any age. Other serogroups are zoonotic and are possibly transmitted by some animals. Rotavirus is the main etiological agent for serious diarrheas in children all over the world. At a very young age, a large number of children have already been infected or reinfected. Rotavirus has limited capabilities for producing outbreaks. The most important problems it constitutes are sporadic and hospital cases. Many cases are relatively serious infections that require hospitalization. According to a study of common rotaviral diarrhea in children under 5 years of age, carried out in 2000 and again in 2004 in Castell\u00f3n, almost half of the patients were hospitalized. In nonindustrialized countries, hospitalizations are fewer because welfare services are less accessible; mortality rates, however, are greater.

Norovirus, especially genogroups I and II, actually constitutes the most frequent cause of viral diarrhea epidemics in industrialized countries. If rotavirus is characterized by producing sporadic cases, norovirus characteristically produces outbreaks; especially in semi-enclosed spaces such as residential homes for the elderly. The infection originates from diverse sources: foods, water, patients, and environment. The fingers are easily contaminated. A small dose of inoculant is sufficient to produce symptoms in susceptible people. On wood, metal, or plastic surfaces, the virus can survive for hours or even days. It has been proven that transmission is possible through typical hand-to-surface contact, such as door handles, telephone receivers, or taps. An experimental study found that contaminated fingers could transfer the virus to the clean surfaces they touch by up to seven times, and at least 14 people could be contaminated by touching the same surface.",

It is possible -as happens with other microorganisms -that this predominance of diagnosed cases in children may be the consequence of a diagnostical age bias. Studies on intestinal infection where adult participants were asked to provide fecal cultures revealed that Campylobacter is also frequent in adolescents, adults, and the elderly. The majority of diagnosed intestinal infections do not require hospital admission. According to the authors of this article, only 15% of cases resulted in patients being hospitalized.",

Companion animals, if they have diarrhea when very young, can pose an infection risk to their owners. The study of risk factors in Campylobacter infection presents difficulties given that the majority of cases are sporadic and in children under the age of 2 years. Exposure to avian or bovine meat products has been related to infection. Exposure is not necessarily by direct consumption; the presence of these products in home kitchens presents a risk factor, probably by cross-contamination due to poor hygienic practices. The existence of other diarrhea cases in the patient's nearby surroundings implies that there are small groupings, small outbreaks not identified by conventional systems of epidemiological monitoring.",

In the nontyphoidal Salmonella group, there are more than 2500 serotypes that can cause gastroenteritis in humans, most common are S. enteritidis and S. typhimurium, although many others have been identified on numerous occasions.

At the beginning of the 1990s, random sampling was carried out for a study in Castell\u00f3n, the estimation was little more than 1 in a 1000. Also, common vegetables (tomatoes, watermelon) and foods with little water activity such as chocolate or powdered milk have been implicated in outbreaks. An outbreak was even transmitted by marijuana consumption. In 2008, an outbreak in the United States transmitted by tomatoes affected more than 500 people in some 30 states.
