A total of 123 neonatal female calves, housed in individual hutches, were enrolled sequentially based on date of birth in 41 blocks of 3 animals each. Calves within each block were allocated to one of 3 treatments: remaining untreated, fed with SCFP (Diamond V SmartCare \u00ae at 1 g/d in milk and NutriTek \u00ae at 5 g/d in starter grain) for the first 63 days of life, or treated with halofuginone (0.1 mg/kg/d) for the first 7 days of life. Fecal samples collected on days 4-21 post-partum were examined for both Cryptosporidium oocysts and coproantigen. The presence and intensity of diarrhea were monitored by scoring daily for the first 4 weeks of life. Calves were weighed at 0, 21, 42 and 63 days of age. Almost all calves were Cryptosporidium-positive at least once during the study. Halofuginone significantly reduced the number of Cryptosporidium-positive fecal samples as compared to the two other groups. Based on the coproantigen scores, both halofuginone and SCFP feeding significantly reduced the intensity of Cryptosporidium infection as compared to the untreated group. Diarrhea was recorded in almost all calves at least once. Neither the proportion of diarrheic calves nor the intensity and duration of diarrhea differed among the 3 treatment groups significantly. The mean daily weight gain during the first 3 weeks of life was significantly lower in halofuginone treated calves than in both other groups; however, at the end of the study period the total weight gain did not significantly differ among the 3 treatment groups. In conclusion, the clinical results and weight gains of pre-weaning supplementation with the SCFP were neither better nor worse than the 7-day halofuginone treatment suggesting that the SCFP feeding may be from the clinical point of view a natural alternative measure, instead of halofuginone treatment, in bovine cryptosporidiosis.",

They belong to the phylum Apicomplexa and have been recently reclassified from coccidian to gregarine parasites (Cavalier-Smith, 2014; Thompson et al., 2016) . More than 30 Cryptosporidium spp. are known at present, the genotype B ('bovine type') of the C. parvum complex being a major enteropathogen in neonatal calves (Broglia et al., 2008; Feng et al., 2018; Holzhausen et al., 2019) . Cryptosporidium spp. have a direct life cycle. In brief, infected hosts shed infectious oocysts with their feces, and new hosts become infected by oral ingestion of oocysts as host-tohost route, from their environment or via oocyst-contaminated drinking water or food. In mammals, Cryptosporidium spp. primarily infect the intestinal epithelium parasitizing the microvillous brush border of enterocytes. The endogenous life cycle includes a first asexual multiplication (merogony) followed by a sexual development (gamogony) and a second asexual multiplication (sporogony) resulting in huge quantities of infectious oocysts which are shed with feces. Oocysts can remain viable and infectious in the environment for months (Fayer, 2008; Deplazes et al., 2016) .",

C. parvum is one of the four main causes of diarrhea in calves within the first 3 weeks of life (Gillhuber et al., 2014; Al Mawly et al., 2015; Anonymous, 2017) . Calves become infected within the first day(s) of life. The infection may cause no clinical symptoms, but is often responsible for a watery diarrhea with acute onset, which can be accompanied by depression, weakness and anorexia. The disease results from a severe villous atrophy in the small intestines. The Cryptosporidium-caused diarrhea generally lasts several days and is self-limiting because of the development of immunity (Thomson et al., 2017) .",

There are two compounds used in the field that were found to have an anticryptosporidial effect in calves after oral administration for several days (treatment starting from the first day of life): halofuginone (Silverl\u00e5s et al., 2009; De Waele et al., 2010; Trotz-Williams et al., 2011; Almawly et al., 2013; Niine et al., 2018) and paromomycin (Fayer and Ellis, 1993; Grinberg et al., 2002) . Halofuginone is the only drug approved against Cryptosporidium for use in neonatal calves by the authorities in Europe (Anonymous, 2000) . However, in a meta-analysis of results from 14 respective studies, it was concluded that \"some beneficial effects were found for the use of halofuginone as prophylactic treatment against cryptosporidiosis, but the substance is toxic and should be used only with severe C. parvum-associated diarrhoeal problems\" (Silverl\u00e5s et al., 2009) . In recent studies halofuginone given prophylactically resulted in reduced oocyst shedding, but did not improve clinical symptoms or bodyweight gain of calves as compared to untreated controls (Trotz-Williams et al., 2011; Almawly et al., 2013) , or was even negatively associated with the weight gain (Niine et al., 2018) .",

For the description of parameters the respective arithmetic mean, standard deviation, minimum and maximum were calculated. Differences of the detection of any pathogen between the 3 treatment groups were analyzed for significance using Chi 2 -test (dichotomous or nominal scaled variables) or Kruskal-Wallis test with Bonferroni corrected Dunn's posttest (ordinal scaled parameters). To get a global basis for evaluation the intensity of the Cryptosporidium infection was estimated using the 'area under the curve' (AUC) of both the oocyst shedding and coproantigen scores over the time. In a first step, the AUC of the respective scores was calculated for each calf during days 4-21. In a second step, a statistical comparison was done for the individual AUC values using the one-way analysis of covariance with repeated measures with respect to the treatment group, having the grouped number of parturitions of cows as a covariate; in case of an overall significant difference, a pairwise comparison of treatments followed using the Student-Newman-Keulstest. In addition to the AUC analysis for oocyst and coproantigen scores, a two-way analysis of covariance with repeated measures with respect to the treatment group and day of observation, again having the grouped number of parturitions of cows as covariate was done (because the scores were not metrically scaled and normally distributed, the results must be seen as exploratory ones). The aim of this additional comparison was to examine the time effect. Correlation analyses were done to analyze the relationship between the number of days with diarrhea and serum total protein concentrations, as well as AUC values of Cryptosporidium oocyst shedding or coproantigen scores. Kappa statistic was calculated to assess the agreement between the results of the two methods used for the detection of Cryptosporidium infection. Additionally, the correlation of scoring results of both these methods was evaluated using Spearman's rank correlation coefficient (r s ) with respect to the scale of the parameters. All the statistical tests were twotailed, and differences or effects with p-values \u2264 0.05 were considered as significant.",

In contrast, co-infections with other enteropathogens (Rotavirus, Coronavirus and E. coli) were detected in a smaller number of calves, and most of them were positive on one day only, resulting in only few positive fecal samples. This is in accordance with results from previous studies (e.g., Gillhuber et al., 2014; Al Mawly et al., 2015; Anonymous, 2017) . Therefore, Cryptosporidium was considered to be the main enteropathogen and responsible for the episodes of diarrhea in the present study. In untreated calves Cryptosporidium oocyst shedding started 9.9 days after birth on average, which is in accordance with previous field observations (e.g., Castro-Hermida et al., 2002; Niine et al., 2018; Urie et al., 2018a) .

There was also a trend, being not significant, for a later onset of oocyst and coproantigen positivity in HALO treated calves than in the two other groups. Finally, the intensity of the Cryptosporidium infection (estimated by AUC values of oocyst shedding or coproantigen scores) was significantly reduced in the HALO group in comparison with CON but not with SCFP.

However, it was interesting to note that the intensity of the infection estimated by AUC values of coproantigen scores (but not of oocyst shedding scores) was significantly lower in SCFP fed calves than in CON ones. This finding may indicate some, although partial effect of the SCFP on the endogenous multiplication of Cryptosporidium, possibly resulting from a modified intestinal environment. Assuming this is correct, a reduced endogenous multiplication of the parasite would result in less pathological alterations in the intestinal mucosa corresponding with the histological findings by V\u00e1zquez Flores et al. (2016) , albeit obviously without clinical improvement. In this context it is of interest to mention that SCFP had been shown to have a positive effect on the intestinal development of preweaned calves (Xiao et al., 2016) and a positive immunomodulatory effect in animals (Park, 2014; Chou et al., 2017) . Of course, it warrants to further investigate the mechanism of action of SCFP.",

This may be a negative consequence of the diarrheal episodes during the first several weeks of life in more or less all calves. The number of diarrheal days was significantly correlated with the intensity of the Cryptosporidium infection indicating that the parasite was responsible for diarrhea in the present study. In contrast, a considerably higher ADG (700 g) at an average weaning age of 66 days was reported for dairy calves in a large-scale US study; however, here clinical signs had been seen in only 38% of the animals, including 21% with digestive signs (Urie et al., 2018b) . Although the HALO treatment showed a partial anticryptosporidial activity, it had no clinical effect in the present study: it did not significantly affect the onset, nor the frequency, duration and intensity of diarrhea, the main clinical symptom of cryptosporidiosis. These results are consistent with observations in previous studies reporting a nonsignificant association between its prophylactic use and the incidence, duration or intensity of diarrhea (Silverl\u00e5s et al., 2009; Trotz-Williams et al., 2011; Almawly et al., 2013; Meganck et al., 2015) .
