            "text": "Since the anthrax letter attacks in October 2001, the US federal government has placed a premium on homeland security, with research and development considered to be a key component of an integrated and unified biodefence strategy. For fiscal year 2003, President Bush proposed a $1.75 billion budget for biodefence research, to be administered primarily through the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) at the National Institutes of Health (NIH). As summarized on the NIAID web site (see online links box), the proposed new biodefence research agenda will broadly focus on studies of CATEGORY A, CATEGORY B and CATEGORY C BIOTERROR AGENTS (for more information, see online links box). These potential bioterror agents share several features, including a high morbidity or mortality that is associated with infection, a high likelihood of personto-person spread, the ability to be made into a weapon and spread by aerosols or food and water supplies, and the potential to cause widespread panic in the public if released into the environment. The goals of this accelerated research and development agenda are to: understand better the molecular mechanisms that are responsible for pathogen transmission, virulence and invasion; develop new animal models of disease that can be used in the study of potential bioterror agents; elucidate host responses to microbes to understand better the complex parameters of innate and acquired immunity, and how they might be manipulated after exposure to potential bioterror agents; develop new vaccines, antimicrobial and antiviral therapeutics, and diagnostic tools against the most threatening diseases, such as smallpox, anthrax, and plague; and to develop research resources such as BSL3 and BSL4 LABORATORY containment facilities to allow more work on category A-C agents than is possible at present. Ultimately, the expectation is that these new research activities will increase our level of preparedness so that we might better respond to, and protect the world's population against, bioterrorism.",

On 4 September 2003, the US Department of Health and Human Services announced the creation of eight Regional Centers of Excellence for Biodefense and Emerging Diseases (RCEs). The aim of the RCEs is to bring together investigators from several disciplines and public and private institutions to tackle the most compelling research questions that are relevant to bioterror agents, particularly anthrax and smallpox, in large, comprehensive programmes (for more information on RCEs, see online links box). Collectively, what sets this new research agenda apart from previous efforts on the study of infectious disease agents is the information derived would be available to all scientists for all time. We could then think about a new postgenomic era of microbe biology.\" (REF. 1 ). As genomics, proteomics and bioinformatics are considered to be key enabling technologies in the development of new methods to deal with potential bioterror agents and emerging infectious diseases, this review summarizes the status of pathogen genome sequencing and analysis at present and discusses how these approaches might best be applied to biodefence preparedness.",

Bioterrorism, by contrast, has a much shorter history. Recent events, in particular the anthrax letter attacks of 2001, have exposed our vulnerabilities in the area of BIOPREPAREDNESS against both natural and deliberate outbreaks of infectious disease. As there is a dearth of investigators who study biowarfare pathogens and only a few specialized facilities for carrying out such research, we only have a rudimentary understanding of the mechanisms of pathogenesis for most of these agents. We also lack rapid and precise diagnostic assays for identifying most of these species. The deliberate release of microbial pathogens can be done, for the most part, without being noticed, until significant numbers of symptomatic patients appear at expectation that in a relatively short period of time these expanded research activities must achieve several key objectives that can provide immediate benefits in the public health arena. It is also anticipated that one of the other positive spin-offs of the new bioterrorism research agenda will most certainly be a better understanding of other more common and naturally occurring infectious agents. This is an important goal because we are at least as vulnerable to emerging infectious diseases as we are to deliberate attacks. The recent severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic that in 9 months killed over 900 people in 31 countries illustrates just how devastating a new disease can be, and how quickly it can spread around the world (for more information on SARS, see online links box).",

Through the power of comparative genomics in silico it is possible to glean insights into new virulence genes, the molecular basis and evolution of pathogenicity, the diversity within closely related isolates, and to formulate hypotheses to be tested experimentally. For example, the sequencing of the B. anthracis genome resulted in the identification of several new putative virulence genes, some of which have recently been shown to encode functional toxins 12 . Several other B. anthracis genes have been identified that encode proteins that are related to proteins that are responsible for virulence in closely related Bacillus species that infect insects 13 . It is not clear whether these genes have the same role in B. anthracis as they do in the other species, nonetheless, they are obvious candidates for future experimental studies. The importance of such studies cannot be overemphasized, because bioinformatics approaches alone are not sufficient to unequivocally predict protein function. The identification of new virulence and pathogenicity genes in bioterror pathogens not only provides new insights into how these agents cause disease, but also potentially provides new targets for antimicrobial and vaccine development.",

These studies showed that distinct sets of genes were differentially regulated during two key steps in the meningococcal infection of potential vaccine candidates 21 . Although proteomics approaches are still limited by factors such as sensitivity and scalability, they are particularly well suited to identifying where proteins are localized in the pathogen (cytoplasmic versus membrane versus secreted proteins), which might be a key step towards understanding the pathogenesis of numerous potential bioterror agents. Of particular interest with regard to the study of bioterror pathogens are the results of a recent study, in which proteomic analysis was used to study the spore coat proteins of B. anthracis and a related but nonpathogenic species, Bacillus subtilis 22 . In response to external stress, both of these bacilli form spores that proteins -are obvious candidates for further studies, which in turn could lead to new approaches to preventing diseases that are caused by N. meningitidis.

Such analyses can be used to identify differences in protein expression between virulent and avirulent strains 20 and MASS SPECTROMETRY Analysis using an analytical instrument that provides accurate information about the molecular mass and structure of complex molecules. This technique can identify and quantify extremely small amounts of peptide by their mass-fragment spectrum. available [32] [33] [34] . This comparative genome hybridization technology can rapidly be applied to the study of large numbers of isolates, identify subsets of genes that might be responsible for phenotypic differences in pathogenesis and virulence, and advance our understanding of microbial evolution and genome heterogeneity. However, one of the limitations of microarray-based analysis of gene content is that the arrays can only provide information on those genes that are represented on an array. Given the genetic diversity that has been observed in some species of bacteria, such as the 26% difference in gene content between the avirulent E. coli K12 strain and the enteropathogenic E. coli 0157:H7 strain 35 , caution is necessary when interpreting comparative genome hybridization data in the absence of comprehensive information about strain variability. One of the most exciting applications of comparative genome hybridization approaches might come from the development of more rapid methods for the detection of biological agents, even when they have been genetically engineered. It is not at all unreasonable to contemplate the fabrication of a DNA chip that contains all of the predicted coding sequences from numerous isolates of the most important human, animal and plant pathogens as a first step in the development of new detection technologies. The read-out from such a 'detector' could provide information on the full genetic complement of any bioterror agent, even if it contains genes or plasmids from other species, any unusual properties that are related to virulence or antibiotic-resistance, or is a synthetic organism that has been built from component genes. The ability to quickly identify and characterize a potential bioterror agent in a single assay would greatly reduce the delays that are inherent in present methods of detection. Progress towards this goal has begun with the development of a multi-pathogen identification microarray (MPID) that has been used to identify 18 pathogenic prokaryotes, bacteria and viruses with a high degree of specificity 36 , and an oligonucleotide array for the detection of closely related orthopox viruses including variola, which is the causative agent of smallpox 37 .",

Until quite recently, the primary approach to antibiotic development within the pharmaceutical industry was to make incremental improvements to existing antibiotic classes to stay one step ahead of resistant microbes 42 . At present antibiotics target three cellular processes in the bacterial cell: DNA/RNA synthesis, protein synthesis and cell-wall synthesis. The reason that these three pathways make excellent targets for antimicrobial compounds is that they represent essential cellular functions. By analogy, any other protein that is essential for cell viability becomes a possible target for the development of entirely new classes of antibiotics. allow them to persist in the environment under extremes of temperature, dessication and time 23 .

Proteome analysis uncovered a set of conserved spore coat proteins and sets of new spore coat proteins that are unique to each species of Bacillus 22 .

Such studies highlight the genes that might be involved in the observed differences in disease outcome after infection. Another study 30 used several approaches, including microarray analysis, to identify 22 genes in murine macrophages that are upregulated in response to infection of cells with Yersinia pestis, which is the causative agent of plague. Several of these genes have previously been shown to be involved in apoptosis. These data are consistent with the fact that many pathogens, such as Y. pestis, are known to circumvent the immune response of the host by interfering with the normal function of circulating macrophages, in this case by triggering cell death, and they indicate that there are possible interventional strategies that might be pursued in the development of new therapeutics to treat this disease.",

            "text": "The availability of pathogen genome sequence data has catalysed research on the identification of new targets for antimicrobial compound, by providing a complete catalogue of genes across a wide range of organisms, which can be compared at various levels 43 . The four attributes of an ideal antimicrobial target are that it is: essential for viability in the microbial pathogen; absent or significantly different in the human host (a parameter that is now much easier to assess given the availability of the human genome sequence); conserved across the appropriate range of organisms; and expressed and relevant to the infectious process. In silico approaches that compare pathogenic organisms and their nonpathogenic relatives can provide a first-pass list of potential genes that are required for colonization, invasion and virulence. Other methods such as transposon mutagenesis [44] [45] [46] and in vivo expression technology (IVET) 47 , for example, have allowed large-scale screening for essential proteins in vitro and in vivo, even when the biological function of a protein is not known. New targets that are identified through such screening programmes can in turn be used in high-throughput screening assays with combinatorial chemistry libraries to identify potential small-molecule inhibitors of protein function. This kind of approach makes full use of the information that is in genome databases by allowing the assay system to drive the identification of new targets 48 53 . The first step in this process is the completion of the genome sequence of the pathogen of interest. In the case of MenB, this took approximately 18 months from the time when it was undertaken in 1998-1999. Today, the complete genome sequence of a pathogen can be obtained in a matter of days to weeks. Several algorithms are used to identify putative cell-surface or secreted proteins that could potentially elicit antibody responses in a human host. For MenB, 570 potential vaccine candidates were identified by bioinformatics approaches. The next step in the process was to produce recombinant proteins in Escherichia coli; approximately 350 proteins were expressed at high levels, purified and used as immunogens in mice. Immune sera were collected and assayed for their ability to bind to the surface of MenB cells and for their bactericidal activity in vitro. Seven proteins had high titres in all of the assays that were carried out and were taken into the final stage of evaluation, which assessed the extent of protein sequence variability in these proteins across large numbers of MenB isolates. From this large-scale screening process, two new vaccine candidates emerged that met all of the criteria. These vaccine candidates are now in Phase I clinical trials.

For example, the comparative genome sequencing of a reference Ames strain of B. anthracis and the Ames isolate from the first patient to die of inhalation anthrax in the attacks of 2001 allowed new polymorphic loci that distinguished multiple Ames isolates to be identified 57 ",

Although it might still be a bit too early to fully assess the impact of genomics on vaccine development, it has been estimated that the availability of genome sequence data, together with the application of large-scale approaches, has reduced the time that is required to identify new vaccine candidates by several years. An added benefit is that the initial screening can be done in a comprehensive way, evaluating all of the potential antigens in a pathogen's genome, and therefore increases the likelihood that the most promising candidates will emerge. Unfortunately, as yet there has not been as much progress using genomics-based approaches in the development of vaccines against pathogens for which T-cell-mediated immunity is most important. This can be largely attributed to the difficulty of predicting T-cell epitopes from protein sequence data alone.",

Victim grant writing, should be one option that is considered. It should be recognized that there is a need for both individual investigator-initiated research programmes on potential bioterror pathogens as well as larger, more comprehensive, multi-investigator research programmes, such as the recently created RCEs. Although research programmes that focus on developing new diagnostics, antibiotics and vaccines using well-proven methods are essential, further funding initiatives that reward innovative thinking should be encouraged. Incentives, such as Project BioShield (for more information, see online links box), that will enable the US government to purchase vaccines and drugs in large amounts, must be created to provide incentives for the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry to rapidly translate basic research results into new products. It is very disturbing that, at a time when microbial genomics has delivered hundreds of potential new targets for antimicrobial compounds, the pharmaceutical industry is scaling back its collective efforts in antibiotic development because the profit margin is not sufficient 43 . In some cases, the key achievements of these research programmes might be drugs or vaccines that are stockpiled for use only in the event of an emergency. Without a continued and sustained market for new products, it is all but guaranteed that these products will not be developed.

Related to this point is the need to remember that collectively we have focused a great deal of attention on human pathogens, but the social and economic devastation that could result from an attack with a virulent plant or animal pathogen, such as foot and mouth disease, could be much greater than what was seen with the anthrax attacks.",

There is no reason we cannot begin to use DNA sequence analysis and DNA microarray technology to collect information on natural variability in large numbers of isolates of the most important pathogens.

One of the biggest challenges before us is the fact that only a limited number of animal model systems are available for the study of the most threatening bioterror agents. Moreover, any clinical trials to evaluate the efficacy of new antibiotics and vaccines against this group of infectious agents will be limited by the the inability to do this testing in human subjects -both because it would be considered highly unethical to deliberately expose volunteers to these infectious agents and because natural outbreaks of these diseases are rare or non-existent.

This strain of B. anthracis was subsequently sent to the US Army Medical Research Institute (USAMRIID) in Fort Detrick, Maryland, where it was used in the US defensive biological weapons programme and distributed to laboratories around the world. At the time of the anthrax letter attacks, scientists at The Institite for Genomic Research (TIGR) were completing the genome sequence of another isolate of B. anthracis Ames that had been obtained from Porton Down in the United Kingdom (Porton strain 1 and 2). Before growth of this bacterial culture, the virulence plasmids had been cured by heat treatment. Because VNTR analysis only examines limited regions within a genome, a project was initiated to evaluate whether large-scale DNA sequence analysis could provide further information on polymorphisms between the different Ames isolates. A DNA sample was obtained from a culture of B. anthracis taken from the first patient to die of inhalational anthrax in Florida, USA (Florida isolate). DNA libraries were made and the Florida isolate was sequenced to eightfold coverage. The sequences of the Florida and Porton isolates were compared and putative polymorphisms were identified and validated as described in REF. 57. The suggested relationship of multiple Ames isolates is illustrated in the figure. Known direct transfers of the isolates (and hence generations of growth) are shown as full arrows. Diamond boxes represent the sources of DNA that were used for genome sequencing. Hypothetical lines of descent are shown as dotted lines. Porton1 and Porton2 are different cultures of the Porton Ames isolate. The figure is modified with permission from REF. 57 \u00a9 American Association for the Advancement of Science (2002).",
