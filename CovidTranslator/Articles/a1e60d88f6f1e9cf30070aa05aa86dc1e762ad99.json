The primary results of the RCT in non-smoking women have been previously published, along with a secondary analysis 1,2 . 69 of the participants in this study were randomised to the FENO based management intervention of MAP, and 73 subjects to the clinical guidelines-based management intervention of the MAP RCT. 15 subjects commenced MAP but were not randomised. The remaining 11 subjects who did not participate in the RCT were not eligible because they were recruited prior to commencement of the MAP study (n=8), or did not wish to have their medications changed (n=2), or were excluded from the MAP study on the basis of exacerbation history (more than 3 courses of OCS in the past year, n=1)..",

The CCQ is not a validated questionnaire. We have calculated the positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) of the CCQ for detecting PCR positive respiratory viral infections in pregnancy using 219 data points. The PPV among pregnant women with asthma was 36.8%, and the NPV was 84.4%. Using 86 data points, the PPV among pregnant women without asthma was 40%, while the NPV was 61.3%, giving an overall PPV of 37.6% and NPV of 76.8%. Receiver Operator Curves were constructed (e- Figure 3 ), but these did not allow a CCQ total score cut-off which was associated with PCR positive infection to be determined. The CCQ has good negative predictive value, and is therefore useful in identifying when infections are unlikely to be present. ",
