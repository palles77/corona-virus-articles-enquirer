The Mano River Union (MRU) countries of West Africa-Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Liberia-have made incremental sustained investments into TB control programmes over the past two decades. The devastating Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak of 2014-2015 in West Africa impacted significantly on all sectors of the healthcare systems in the MRU countries, including the TB prevention and control programmes. The EVD outbreak also had an adverse impact on the healthcare workforce and healthcare service delivery. At the height of the EVD outbreak, numerous staff members in all MRU countries contracted EBV at the Ebola treatment units and died. Many healthcare workers were also infected in healthcare facilities that were not Ebola treatment units but were national hospitals and peripheral health units that were unprepared for receiving patients with EVD. In all three MRU countries, the disruption to TB services due to the EVD epidemic will no doubt have increased Mycobacterium tuberculosis transmission, TB morbidity and mortality, and decreased patient adherence to TB treatment, and the likely impact will not be known for several years to come[ 1 _ T D $ D I F F ] . In this viewpoint, the impact that the EVD outbreak had on TB diagnostic, management, and prevention services is described. Vaccination against TB with BCG in children under 5 years of age was affected adversely by the EVD epidemic. The EVD outbreak was a result of global failure and represents yet another 'wake-up call' to the international community, and particularly to African governments, to reach a consensus on new ways of thinking at the national, regional, and global levels for building healthcare systems that can sustain their function during outbreaks. This is necessary so that other disease control programmes (like those for TB, malaria, and HIV) are not compromised during the emergency measures of a severe epidemic.",

[15] [16] [17] Right from the onset, due to misconstrued conspiracy theories that were propagated by the local media and community gossip about the perceived origin of Ebola virus (EBV), the EVD outbreak was characterized by community fear, stigma, apprehension, and misunderstanding of the role of healthcare centres operating under prevailing epidemic conditions. [15] [16] [17] Where these perceived fears outweighed potential benefits, the creation of Ebola treatment centres further hindered healthcare-seeking behaviour. 16, 17 There was widespread reluctance of people with symptoms such as fever to visit healthcare facilities for fear of being diagnosed or suspected of having EVD. People also refrained from visiting healthcare facilities to avoid being infected with EBV. There was also heightened anxiety amongst some healthcare workers (HCWs) to engage with or treat patients, 18 and many healthcare facilities in all three countries were closed during the outbreak.",

During the EVD outbreak, two HCWs at the DOTS centre contracted EVD and died. Inpatients at the DOTS centre discharged themselves, patients who were on regular chemotherapy avoided the clinic, and prospective TB patients also avoided the healthcare system. Even though the DOTS centre was not closed, its functionality was impaired by the quarantine and patient boycott. The patient boycott in Kenema was related to how Ebola was reported in the District.",

Many parents were gripped with fear, wary of the healthcare centres and possibility of EBV transmission, and avoided vaccination clinics and hospitals. Reasons for boycotting the clinics were varied and included: (1) that children were weighed using the same scales without these being disinfected in-between children, and (2) HCWs had died after contracting EVD in the clinics and hospitals. Others believed the conspiracy theories about EBV transmission that 'the injections received at hospitals contained EBV for killing patients' or that 'when you visit the hospital, they will diagnose you with Ebola'. As a consequence, over 3000 children missed essential vaccinations for TB and other diseases such as measles, which resulted in an outbreak of measles post-Ebola 19 [ 6 _ T D $ D I F F ] and a rise in new TB cases post-Ebola.",

Even though the global funds for TB increased by 2.3% (USD 13 million) in 2014, the amount available to Liberia and Sierra Leone was low (although Guinea had sustained TB funding). As a consequence, there was a failure to bring in drugs that were adequate for TB control in some parts of the MRU (Liberia and Sierra Leone) and this created the conditions for the development of drug-resistant TB . In all three MRU countries, the disruption to TB services due to the EVD epidemic will no doubt have increased Mycobacterium tuberculosis transmission (both drug-resistant and drug-sensitive strains), TB morbidity and mortality, and patient adherence to TB treatment, although the likely impact will not be known for several years to come.",

Furthermore, many HCWs were infected in healthcare facilities that were not Ebola treatment units but were national hospitals and peripheral health units that were unprepared for receiving patients with EVD. According to a WHO report, there were 815 confirmed and probable EVD cases among the HCWs spanning January 2014 to March 2015, with 328 in Sierra Leone, 288 in Liberia, and 199 in Guinea. Importantly, the deaths of HCWs deprived the weak healthcare systems of much needed human resources. For example in Sierra Leone, a nation of just over seven million people, there are less than 1500 HCWs in the entire country. Following the EVD epidemic, HCWs conveyed a feeling of loss of trust within and across health facilities, and between HCWs and communities. 25 [ 1 0 _ T D $ D I F F ] Providers described feeling lonely, ostracized, unloved, afraid, saddened, and no longer respected. They also discussed restrictions on behaviours that enhance coping, including attending burials and engaging in physical touch (hugging, handshaking, sitting near, or eating with colleagues, patients, and family members). Providers described infection prevention measures as necessary but divisive because screening booths and protective equipment inhibited bonding or 'suffering with' patients. The EVD epidemic leaves a smaller workforce, which is trying to deal with the ongoing TB epidemic, and this too will have its toll on the TB care and control services in West Africa.",

Will Zika virus return to Africa in epidemic form? 32 An important lesson from the EVD epidemic is that long-term planning should be based on a holistic approach for strengthening and building health systems and services, moving away from disease-specific national programmes. New ways of thinking at the national, regional, and global levels are required to strengthen healthcare systems. This is required not only to improve the ability of countries and regions to deal effectively with epidemic infectious disease threats, but also to sustain functioning health systems during outbreaks so that other disease control programmes (like those for TB, malaria, and HIV) are not compromised during the emergency measures of a severe epidemic. This will require skilled and trained staff at the national level, and such staff are scarce in most low-income countries. It has previously been argued that central or regional laboratories, able to perform rapid advanced diagnostics on samples from patients with alarming symptoms but without a clear diagnosis, are urgently needed for early outbreak detection. 32 There are important global leadership issues that need to be considered. The role of the WHO in the EVD outbreak and its capability to prevent and control epidemics in developing countries has been criticized and questioned. 36 [ 2 0 _ T D $ D I F F ] So who should take the lead in the proactive surveillance, coordination, and emergency response to future outbreaks? Apart from the WHO, which has advisory and data surveillance functions but cannot act as a funding agency, a suitable choice could be The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, 37 [ 2 1 _ T D $ D I F F ] which provides substantial funds for national programmes for all three diseases, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa. The Global Fund is a public-private partnership founded in 2001 and has invested over $10 billion in interventions for HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria in over 130 countries. The Global Fund could work with national and regional authorities to ensure cross-collaboration between the three diseases and close alignment with the rest of the healthcare programme. The Global Fund could also broaden its remit and support training, diagnostic, and operational research activities for all three diseases. For TB there are other funder initiatives that have arisen post-EVD that provide opportunities for synergistic alignment of capacity building and training across all African regions 38 [ 2 2 _ T D $ D I F F ] and for a 'One Health' approach 39 [ 2 3 _ T D $ D I F F ] to controlling emerging infections .",
