This put enormous pressure on the Chinese government, medical healthcare provider, and the general public, but also made the international community deeply nervous. On the 25th day after the outbreak, the Chinese government implemented strict traffic restrictions on the area where the 2019-nCoV had originateddHubei province, whose capital city is Wuhan. Ten days later, the rate of increase of cases in Hubei showed a significant difference (p \u00bc 0.0001) compared with the total rate of increase in other provinces of China. These preliminary data suggest the effectiveness of a traffic restriction policy for this pandemic thus far. At the same time, solid financial support and improved research ability, along with network communication technology, also greatly facilitated the application of epidemic prevention measures. These measures were motivated by the need to provide effective treatment of patients, and involved consultation with three major groups in policy formulationdpublic health experts, the government, and the general public. It was also aided by media and information technology, as well as international cooperation. This experience will provide China and other countries with valuable lessons for quickly coordinating and coping with future public health emergencies.",

The one with the largest number of deaths in recent human history, the Spanish flu caused by the H1N1 influenza A virus, had infected 500 million people (almost 1/3 of the world population in 1918 [1] ) and killed 25 to 50 million people [2, 3] . In the 21st century, human epidemics caused by viruses have continuously appeared in the public eye. Among them, the new infectious diseases caused by wild animal coronavirus infections in humans have attracted the most attention, reminding us that people should be fully prepared to respond to a larger pandemic that may occur at any time in the future.",

The first infectious disease was reported in November 2002, in Guangdong Province, China [4] . While the source of the virus was not identified yet, this disease spread quickly, infecting many medical staff. On February 21, 2003 , an infected Guangdong doctor travelled to Hong Kong, leading to spread of the virus globally [5] . Not until March 15, after the World Health Organization (WHO) received reports of cases from Guangdong, Hong Kong, and Hanoi, was a global alert on the disease issued, which was officially named \"Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)\" [6] . The pathogen originated from bats [7] and the intermediate host was the masked palm civet [8] . At the beginning of the epidemic, the international community lacked experience for containment of this type of outbreak, and the disease was not officially diagnosed until 146 days after the first case appeared [9] . From April to May 2003, the Chinese government established a comprehensive prevention network, allocated 2 billion yuan to epidemic prevention, built a \"Xiaotangshan\" temporary hospital, and actively treated patients. Because of the low coverage by modern communication networks, there was difficulty in communicating information. Nevertheless, the epidemic response was generally satisfactory [10] . Although interpersonal transmission of the first SARS outbreak (November 2002 to July 2003) was successfully stopped thanks to global cooperation [11] , the worldwide spread of the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) still caused 8447 cases and 774 deaths in 32 countries [12] .",

At the end of December, some hospitals in Wuhan reported several cases of unexplained pneumonia in those with a history of South China seafood market exposure [18, 19] . In December 31 the pneumonia cases of unknown origin were officially reported; in early January 2020, market store owners were evacuated in succession; and Hubei Province began to investigate the source of the virus. However, after only two weeks, the number of mysterious pneumonia cases nationwide had reached 198 by January 18, then reaching 830 by January 23 [20] , and Wuhan immediately began implementing traffic control to prevent the spread of the disease. The \"Level 1 Emergency Response to major public health emergencies\" was implemented, and comprehensive epidemic prevention began. One week later (January 30), the official reported number of confirmed domestic cases had reached 9,692, which exceeded the total number of previous cases of SARS in the world [21] . On the same day, WHO announced that 2019-nCOV constitutes a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) [22] , which noted that this elusive disease is more dangerous than the one in 2003. The Chinese government also made a series of significant responses in a very short period of time, including the establishment of a leading group of experts for epidemic response [23] , the construction of a number of temporary hospitals [24e26], the deployment of medical staff [27] , and the implementation of a comprehensive national epidemic prevention policy [28] . It remains to be seen whether these measures can quickly control the spread of 2019-nCOV.",

By January 30, 2020, the cumulative number of 2019-nCoV cases in China had exceeded the total number of previous SARS cases worldwide [29] , and many new cases appeared in only one month. Currently, there are still more than 3000 new confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV infection daily. As of the date of this publication, the total number of confirmed domestic cases has risen to 78064 [30] . During this period, the diagnosis, isolation, admission and treatment of patients have become the biggest challenges that China and the international community need to face. It is reassuring that the vast majority of cases of 2019-nCOV are still concentrated in China, and the number of transmitting countries and regions is currently 28 (Fig. 1B) , slightly lower than the number of countries that reported SARS cases [12, 31] . In addition, no deaths have been reported in any country outside of China, except for the death of a pneumonia patient in the Philippines [32] (as of February 9, 2020). Since 2019-nCOV has an incubation period of 5.3e19 days (average of 5.2 days) [33] , the effects of international traffic control measures in 2020 need to be further observed.",

Huoshenshan Hospital was successfully constructed at an astonishing speed, and started to receive patients within ten days [25] . On January 26, the Chinese government invested 11.21 billion RMB; after 11 days [34], the investment increased to 66.74 billion RMB [35] in epidemic prevention and control funds, and has deployed more than 10,000 medical staff nationwide to assist Hubei Province [27] . Back in 2003, China built the Xiaotangshan Temporary Hospital in 6 days [36] , with its construction starting as late as 158 days after the first case was reported, indicating that the response to the spread of SARS-CoV was far slower than for 2019-nCoV. Similarly, in the current epidemic, China implemented main domestic response measures before WHO's announcement of the high risk of a global epidemic; while during SARS, China's establishment of temporary hospitals and financial support came after WHO's warning.",

In addition, despite the unpredictability of each epidemic, the process of battling previous epidemics has brought with it valuable experience for responding to future epidemics. The 2019-nCOV epidemic has challenged the limits of our ability to handle it. As a viral infectious disease that can be transmitted through multiple channels, its onset time also coincided with the Spring Festival (the biggest national holiday in China), when over a billion people begin their annual migration in China. The outbreak also originated in the main At early stages of the outbreak, Hubei Province had experienced a shortage of personal protection materials, such as masks and hospital supplies. Thus, it began to collect materials from other parts of the country and urgently transferred them to Hubei Province. As of February 6, 2020, there was still shortage of materials in the province [51] ; this is a wake-up call for us when dealing with future outbreaks. As shown in Fig. 3 , during a public health emergency, the smooth coordination between the government, medical care and the masses is very important. For example, on February 3, when the number of confirmed cases in Wuhan had reached 6384 [52] and there was a shortage of medical resources, the government promptly claimed stadiums, exhibition halls and other places to establish a number of \"square cabin hospitals\" for treating non-critical patients. This was done to free up important resources at Huoshenshan Hospital, Leishenshan Hospital and other sites to treat critically ill patients in a more timely manner [53] . The public was promptly guided by governments at all levels in order to maximally prevent the spread of the virus.",

This technology also allows any traveler to check the trend of population flow and exposure to pneumonia patients during their trip at any time. These technologies have greatly facilitated accurate epidemic prevention and control [58] .",

By uploading and comparing national health data, it is possible to automatically identify past contacts and potential contacts. The comparison and calculation of the resultant data model provides relative risk coefficients for people, so that the government can carry out precise measures. At the same time, China Unicom formed a joint big data team of more than 100 people, provided the government with 1783 comprehensive epidemic analysis reports and developed 13 data models for epidemic prevention [60] . In addition, e-commerce companies including Alibaba and JD.com donated funds along with a large amount of medical supplies during the epidemic [61], using their industry advantages and logistics to facilitate large-scale material delivery. This level of development in e-commerce can fully overcome logistical obstacles that do not involve direct contact between people, to prevent further viral transmission [62] .",

Concurrently, the government also needs to regularly disclose information and ensure international cooperation. For the general population, it is difficult to realize the limitations of government measures and medical care to deal with an emerging infectious disease. However, if the disease spreads too quickly, excessive public support and high expectations may turn into disappointment and propagation of rumors [63] . Patients and uninfected people in both epidemic and non-epidemic areas (Fig. 3 ) also face different levels of psychological pressure, which also need to be addressed.",
