The model has a globally asymptotically stable disease-free equilibrium whenever a certain epidemiological threshold, known as the basic reproduction number R 0 , is less than or equal to unity. We investigate the effect of the time delay on the stability of endemic equilibrium when R 0 > 1. We give criteria that ensure that endemic equilibrium is asymptotically stable for all time delays and a Hopf bifurcation occurs as time delay exceeds the critical value. We give formulae for the direction of Hopf bifurcations and the stability of bifurcated periodic solutions by applying the normal form theory and the center manifold reduction for functional differential equations. Numerical simulations are presented to illustrate the analytical results.",

In many real-world processes, especially, in a lot of biological phenomena, the present dynamics of the state variables depends not only on the present state of the processes but also on the history of the phenomenon, that is, on the past values of state variables. The time delay may influence the dynamics of infectious diseases. In fact, many diseases have different kinds of delays when they spread, such as immunity period delay [7, 8] , infection period delay [9] , and incubation period delay [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] . It is well known that the dynamical behaviors (including stability, attractivity, persistence, periodic oscillation, bifurcation, and chaos) of population models with time delay have become a subject of intense research activities. In particular, the properties of periodic solutions arising from the Hopf bifurcation are of great interest.",

The constant of proportionality \u03b2 is sometimes called the transmission coefficient [28] . This transmission coefficient may well depend on the population size. If the total population size N is not too large, then the bilinear incidence, denoted by \u03b2SI, is proper for the model because the number of adequate contacts by an individual per unit time should increase as the total population size N increases. On the other hand, if the population size N is quite large, then the standard incidence, denoted by \u03b2SI/N , is more realistic [29] . These two incidences are widely used in modeling the transmission dynamics of the human diseases [13, 28, 30] .

The local and global asymptotic stabilities of disease-free equilibrium are established in Sect. 3. The local stability of the endemic equilibrium and sufficient and necessary conditions for the existence of the Hopf bifurcation are analyzed in Sect. 4. In Sect. 5, when the model exhibits the Hopf bifurcation, we employ the normal form theory and center manifold approach to derive formulas for determining the direction and stability of bifurcating periodic solutions. Numerical simulations are carried out in Sect. 6 to illustrate the main theoretical results, and a brief discussion is given in Sect. 7 to conclude this work.",

The model is rigorously analyzed to gain insight into its dynamical features. The study results are summarized as follows. By using the Lyapunov functional method and the LaSalle invariance principle, the disease-free equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable if a certain threshold quantity, known as the reproductive number and denoted by R 0 , is less than unity for all time delays \u03c4 \u2265 0, indicating that time delay does not impact on the stability property of this equilibrium. When R 0 > 1, the contact rate \u03b2 and time delay \u03c4 are regraded as bifurcated parameters. The study results show that if the contact rate \u03b2 satisfies condition (4.8), then the endemic equilibrium E * of model (2.1) is absolutely stable, that is, E * is asymptotically stable for all \u03c4 \u2265 0. Meanwhile, if the contact rate \u03b2 satisfies condition (4.9), then Table 1 and \u03b2 = 7.2875 so that R 0 = 3.1 > 1. The initial conditions are S(0) = 1.92465 \u00d7 10 5 , E(0) = 30, I(0) = 47, and R(0) = 4.03998 \u00d7 10 5 the endemic equilibrium, E * of model (2.1) is conditionally stable, that is, E * is asymptotically stable for \u03c4 \u2208 [0, \u03c4 0 ), and the Hopf bifurcation occurs at \u03c4 = \u03c4 0 . It is observed that the delayed SEIR epidemic model with infectious force in latent and infected period (2.1) exhibits a Hopf bifurcation, called subcritical, which is a different result from the epidemic models with bilinear incidence rate and nonlinear incidence rate that exhibit supercritical Hopf bifurcation; see [27, [41] [42] [43] [44] . This gives the new result that the type of Hopf bifurcation depends on the type of incidence function used in the epidemic model. In addition, the phenomenon of Hopf bifurcation in the delayed SEIR epidemic model with infectious force in latent and infected period depends on contact rate in the sense that the contact rate is a crucial condition to ensure the Hopf bifurcation and time delay can cause the loss of stability via subcritical Hopf bifurcation at the critical time delay \u03c4 = \u03c4 0 .",

There exists an endemic equilibrium state, which is asymp-totically stable, and the transmission of the disease seems to happen immediately (without any delay). Besides public health education, there is another way to destabilize this state and make the education more effective: by the management and care of exposed individuals in a timely fashion at the supervision or the direction of a legally qualified medical practitioner. So, delay in diagnosis and treatment of disease is one of the reasons for the failure in the control of the disease.",
