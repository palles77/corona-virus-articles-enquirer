Understanding the evolution of influenza virus is crucial to determine pathogenesis, vaccine efficacy, and resistance to antiviral drugs. In this study, we investigated the molecular evolution of influenza virus A(H1N1)pdm09 in the 2010/11 influenza season in southern Germany by sequence analysis of the influenza virus hemagglutinin gene from 25 patients with mild, moderate, and severe disease. Phylogenetic analysis revealed co-circulation of different genetic groups. The D222G mutation, which had previously been observed in severe cases, was not detected. Immunocompromised patients were not affected more severely than non-immunocompromised patients (p[0.05), although longer shedding was observed in some of them. Interestingly, additional mutations and potential glycosylation sites were detected in samples from the lower respiratory tract in two patients, but not in the corresponding upper respiratory tract specimens. The H275Y mutation in the influenza virus neuraminidase gene, known to confer resistance to the neuraminidase inhibitor oseltamivir, was detected in one patient.",

The HA determines host-receptor tropism and constitutes the key immunogenic site for the human immune response. Since the beginning of the 2009 pandemic, A(H1N1)pdm09 rapidly evolved, and seven different clades/groups characterized by distinct molecular markers in the HA gene have been reported [23] . The D222G mutation in the receptor-binding domain of the HA gene has been linked to severe cases [10] . Of note, another mutation involving the same residue (D222E) was also observed but could not be associated with more severe cases [1] . Understanding the molecular evolution of influenza virus is therefore crucial to identify mutations that might be associated with a more virulent phenotype. The second surface glycoprotein, NA, facilitates the release of newly synthesized virions from infected cells [5] . Neuraminidase can be blocked by antiviral drugs such as oseltamivir and zanamivir, which act by interfering with the release of progeny virus, thereby preventing new rounds of infection. A single point mutation at position 275 in the neuraminidase glycoprotein, resulting in a histidine-to-tyrosine shift, can confer resistance to oseltamivir [13] .",

Samples were analysed using FTD Respiratory Pathogens version 08/2010 (Fast-track Diagnostics, Junglinster, Luxemburg) as recommended. The assay utilizes 5'nuclease technology (TaqMan) and employs a 5-tube multiplex one-step realtime RT-PCR approach. In tube 1, real-time RT-PCR for influenza virus A, A(H1N1)pdm09, influenza virus B, and rhinovirus are combined. Tube 2 contains reagents for parainfluenza viruses 2, 3, and 4, and brome mosaic virus (BMV) as a PCR inhibition control; tube 3, for coronavirus 229E, coronavirus NL63, coronavirus OC43, and coronavirus HKU1; tube 4, for respiratory syncytial virus A/B, adenovirus, parechovirus, and enterovirus; and tube 5, for parainfluenza virus 1, human metapneumovirus A/B, human bocavirus, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae. The BMV inhibition control was added to each patient sample before nucleic acid extraction. An AgPath-ID One-Step RT-PCR-Kit (Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany) was used for RT-PCR on an ABI 7500 real-time machine (Applied Biosystems, Wiesbaden, Germany). Cycling conditions were as follows: 50\u00b0C for 15 min, 95\u00b0C for 10 min followed by 40 amplification cycles of denaturation at 95\u00b0C for 8 s and combined annealing/extension at 60\u00b0C for 34 s.",

As reported by others [8, 18, 19] , and as published in the ECDC report released in August/September 2011 [23] , co-circulation of different genetic groups was observed. Group 6, characterized by mutations D97N and S185T, was the dominant H1N1 lineage (48 %), followed by group 5 (33 %; D97N, R205K, I216V), group 4 (12 %; N125D) and group 7 (9 %; S185T, S143G, A197T). Although a number of mutations have been reported in circulating A(H1N1)pdm09, they have not significantly affected virus antigenicity and pathogenicity as demonstrated by in vitro studies [26] . Clinically, the mutations D222G and N have been associated with a more virulent phenotype [10] . However, recent studies show that within the current A(H1N1)pdm09 HA framework, the effect of the 222 mutation on receptor binding appears to be less dramatic when compared to the 1918 influenza A(H1N1) virus HA framework, since the binding preference for a2-6 sialylglycans is still maintained [26] . Also, other mutations, such as the double mutation N125D and E374K, have been associated with a more virulent phenotype. This double mutation has been associated with several breakthrough infections despite influenza vaccinations and was identified in some fatal cases [2] . Moreover, it was associated with decreased antibody recognition in vaccinated individuals [21] . The German HA sequences carrying this double mutation originated from an unvaccinated immunocompromised individual with severe illness. Due to the lack of serum specimens, we could not analyze the ability of antibodies to recognize the hemagglutinin of A(H1N1) pdm09 in our study. However, immune escape from the vaccine strains might be an issue of concern.",

However, in two patients, differences between the HA sequence could be detected in viruses isolated either from the upper respiratory tract (URT) or the lower respiratory tract (LRT). In particular, two additional mutations (K130R-M344L in one case and K119N-I216K in the other case) were identified only in the LRT. Moreover, analysis of potential glycosylation sites revealed that the K119N mutation provides an additional potential glycosylation site. Human influenza viruses carrying the K119N mutation show improved growth in eggs and appear to exhibit enhanced virulence in the mouse model [9, 14] . Glycosylation at position 119 is essential for improved virus protein yield in eggs [14] . Egg adaptation of human influenza viruses is known to increase their affinity for the 2,3-sialic acid (SA) receptor and concomitantly impairs their ability to bind to 2,6-SA [11] . Although it is clear that influenza virus tropism depends on several viral and host factors and not only on HA specificity, the presence of the K119N mutation exclusively in the virus isolated from the LRT might indicate a more efficient binding/replication of viruses carrying this mutation to/in cells expressing 2,3-SA. Importantly, 2,3-SA is known to be found in abundance in the lower respiratory tract [20] .",

Since BAL samples are usually significantly more diluted than nasopharyngeal swabs, the observed difference suggests a real replication advantage of the strain harboured in the LRT. Virus histochemistry studies could be used to analyze the pattern of binding of mutants to human respiratory tissue, as already suggested [6, 22] . Moreover, analysis of growth curves of the two isolates in different cell lines may reveal a possible replication advantage, at least in cell culture. Many patients with influenza have more than one viral agent, with reported co-infection frequencies as high as 20 % [4] . We detected co-infection with another respiratory virus in 7 out of 33 samples (21 %), corresponding to 5 of the 25 patients (20 %). The most frequent co-infecting agents were coronaviruses (5 of 7 samples), followed by RSV (2 of 7 samples) and human bocavirus (1/7). Disease resulting from co-infection with influenza virus and coronaviruses has been reported to be more severe [4] , although the number of influenza virus and coronavirus co-infections is low [4, 15, 17] . Here, patients co-infected with coronaviruses showed moderate to severe disease, whereas co-infection with RSV and human bocavirus in one child resulted in mild disease.",
