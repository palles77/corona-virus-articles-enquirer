The sudden appearance of the virus leads to the limited existing therapies for SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, vaccines and antiviral medicines are in desperate need. This study took immune-informatics approaches to identify B-and T-cell epitopes for surface glycoprotein (S) of SARS-CoV-2, followed by estimating their antigenicity and interactions with the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles. We identified four B cell epitopes, two MHC class-I and nine MHC class-II binding T-cell epitopes, which showed highly antigenic features. Allergenicity, toxicity and physiochemical properties analysis confirmed the specificity and selectivity of epitopes. The stability and safety of epitopes were confirmed by digestion analysis. No mutations were observed in all the selected B-and T-cell epitopes across all isolates from different locations worldwide. Epitopes were thus identified and some of them can be potential candidates for vaccine development. : bioRxiv preprint",

SARS-CoV-2 utilizes glycosylated spike (S) protein to gain entry into host cells. The S protein is a trimeric class I fusion protein and exists in a metastable prefusion conformation that undergoes a dramatic structural rearrangement to fuse the viral membrane with the host-cell membrane [1, 9, 10] . The S protein includes the receptor binding S1-subunit and the membrane fusion S2-subunit. The S1 subunit receptor-binding domain (RDB) is specifically recognized by the host receptor. When the S1 subunit binds to a host-cell receptor, the prefusion trimer is destabilized, resulting in the shedding of S1 subunit, and the state transition of S2 subunit to a stable postfusion conformation [11] . The critical function of the S protein can be a breakthrough in vaccine design and development.",

The antigenic tendency value of S protein was estimated to be 1.041 (average), 0.866(minimum) and 1.261 (maximum) (Fig. 1B) . Hydrophilic region is important in initiating immune response, which is generally uncovered on the surface of protein. Parker hydrophilicity of S protein was found to be 1.238 (average), -7.629 (minimum) and 7.743 (maximum) (Fig. 1C) . To find the surface availability of B-cell epitopes, Emini surface accessibility was predicted for S protein with average of 1 , minimum of 0.042, and maximum of 6.051 (Fig. 1D) . Exposed on the surface and hydrophilic in nature making beta turn a vital structure in starting the defense response. Therefore, we predicted Chou and Fasman beta turn to gain the result, 0.997 (average), 0.541 (minimum) and 1.484 (maximum) in S protein (Fig. 1E ). As the parts of epitope connecting with antibodies are typically elastic in nature, we predicted Karplus and Schulz flexibility of S protein and the result was 0.993 (average), 0,876 (minimum), and 1.125(maximum) (Fig. 1F) . A total of 262 B-cell epitopes were selected based on the combination of the results (Supplementary Table 3a ). BcePred [18] was used to predict B-cell epitopes using accessibility, antigenic propensity, exposed surface, flexibility, hydrophilicity, polarity and turns. Overall, we obtained totally 129 B-cell epitopes (Supplementary Table 3b ). Table 1 ). The four B-cell epitopes were mapped to the 3D structure of SARS-CoV-2 S protein (PDB ID: 6VSB), showing that 'VLGQSKRVDFCGKG' and 'GLTGTGVLTESNKK' are in less-exposed region (Figure 2 A, and B) , while 'VRQIAPGQTGKIAD' and 'KIADYNYKLPDDFT' locate in the spike head which is the most exposed region (Figure 2 C) . Discontinuous B-cell epitopes were predicted by Discotope 2.0 using A, B, and C chain of 3D structure of S protein (PDB ID: 6VSB), respectively. The positions of discontinuous epitopes were mapped on the surface of 3D structure of S protein ( Figure 3A ). Most discontinuous B-cell epitopes were mapped on the fully-exposed 'spike head' region ( Figure 3B ) and less-exposed 'spike stem', while a few located in the 'spike root' region of the spike (Supplementary Table 3c ).",

The antigenicity, flexibility, solvent accessibility, disulphide bonds of predicted epitopes were evaluated, yielding four potential B-cell epitope and vaccine candidate. Allergenicity and toxicity analysis confirmed the four B-cell epitopes are of non-allergen and non-toxin. Stability analysis revealed that they can not be digested by multiple enzymes. In addition, two MHC class-I and nine MHC class-II binding Tcell epitopes were predicted to interact with numerous HLA alleles and to be highly antigenic in nature.",

Protein-peptide interactions were performed by PepSite [22]. 10 epitope-protein interactions were reported and the top prediction was chosen. HLA-B*35:01 (1A9E) is of a hetero 2mer structure with 386 residues. Epitope 'LPIGINITRF' was predicted to significantly bind on the surface of HLA-B35:01(PDB ID: 1A9E) through six hydrogen bonds with Leu-1, Pro-2, Ile-3, Gly-4, Ile-5, and Ans-6 (Figure 4 A). Epitope 'IAIVMVTIM' moderately significantly bond to HLA-B35:01(PDB ID: 1A9E) via six hydrogen bonds with Ile-3, Val-4, Met-5, Thr-7, Ile-8, and Met-9 (Figure 4B).
