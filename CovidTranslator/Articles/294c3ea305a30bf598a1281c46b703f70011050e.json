The Asturian Sentinel Surveillance Network (ASSN), which comprises primary care health units (PCHU) throughout the region, has been organized to detect and monitor the mergence of influenza virus outbreaks each year. This surveillance system detects the onset of influenza epidemics and identifies specific strains each season. Although the main role of ASSN, which is included in the Spanish Influenza Sentinel Surveillance System (SISSS), is the study of influenza outbreaks, such network could also be used as a virological surveillance system for other communityacquired viral infections. The importance of similar networks was shown after the emergence of the new influenza virus IAn/H1N1, which was first reported in Mexico during April 2009 and rapidly detected in many other countries. Thus, >600,000 cases and >14,000 deaths had been reported to the World Health Organization during 2009. As the pandemic progressed, it became clear that the majority of IAn/H1N1 infections are mild and indistinguishable from any other seasonal influenza virus infection. 1 Nevertheless, there are few data about the comparison of the clinical features of infection with IAn/H1N1 and with other respiratory viruses.",

Furthermore, one multiplex nested RT-PCR were used to detect IA, IB, RSV A, RSV B, and rhinovirus. 3, 4 Primers from IA, IB, RSV A and RSV B, as well as the amplification protocol, were obtained from Coiras et al. 3 Primers from rhinovirus were obtained from Coiras et al. 4 Metapneumovirus, parainfluenzavirus, and coronavirus were detected by using an \"in-house\" multiplex nested RT-PCR. The first round of amplification was carried out using specific outer primers (Table 1) according to the instructions provided with the Titan One Tube RT-PCR System (Roche, Germany). To increase sensitivity, a second round of amplification was carried out using specific inner primers (Table 1) and Taq DNA polymerase (Gibco BRL) in PCR buffer (1\u00d7) supplied by the manufacturer. The annealing temperature of both amplifications was 55 \u2022 C. The PCR products were analyzed using 2% agarose-TBE gel electrophoresis.

A similar behavior has been observed during 2009 flu pandemic in our region, where a rhinovirus peak (May) preceded the apparition of IAn/H1N1. The second rhinovirus peak (September) has been also reported in other European countries. It has been hypothesized that rhinovirus infection can reduce the probability of IAn/H1N1 infection and that such interference could have been the cause of a delay in the IAn/H1N1 outbreak expansion at the beginning of autumn in those countries. 6 The high incidence of rhinovirus in September (second peak) supports that during weeks 37-40, these respiratory viruses were the cause of a relatively high number of cases, which were attributable to IAn/H1N1 according to the influenza case definition. Our data support that a high percentage of viral infections were clinically misdiagnosed, especially at the beginning of the pandemic (September). A reason of this clinical misdiagnosis may be the fact that major of the symptoms included in clinical influenza case definition are also presented by patients infected by other respiratory viruses, specially rhinovirus, such as has been shown in this work. Clinical misdiagnosis during flu pandemic has been also reported by other authors 7, 8 supporting the idea that the influenza case definition used during 2009 flu pandemic cannot differentiate between other viral infections. Our study offers useful information to face future pandemics caused by influenza virus indicating that differential diagnoses is always required in order to not overestimate the importance of the pandemic.",

Por ello, se estudiaron la incidencia, los aspectos cl\u00ednicos y la distribuci\u00f3n temporal de los virus respiratorios circulantes durante el per\u00edodo de la pandemia gripal. M\u00e9todos: Se recogieron muestras respiratorias de pacientes con s\u00edntomas de gripe desde mayo de 2009 a diciembre de 2009. Diferentes virus respiratorios fueron detectados mediante m\u00e9todos convencionales de cultivo y t\u00e9cnicas de amplificaci\u00f3n gen\u00f3mica. Resultados: Aunque el virus detectado con mayor frecuencia fue el IAn/H1N1, otros virus respiratorios cocircularon durante la pandemia gripal, especialmente rinovirus.
