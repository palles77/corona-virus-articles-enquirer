MERS-CoV emerged in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in 2012 with links to several animals including camels and goats with bats as a strong candidate reservoir. The SARS-CoV story is well known e this virus originated in Guangdong Province in China and led to infection clusters in Vietnam, Hong Kong, Canada and Singapore thanks to the air travel of the individuals who had contact with the index patient in a Hong Kong hotel. Travel can bring us in contact with a broad range of zoonotic contacts, rabid dogs, feral cats, mosquito bites, tick bites, the cornucopia of creatures in Asian wet markets with myriad opportunities for cross-species transfer of pathogens and virus shuffle and reassortment. Zoonotic infections are not new e Yersinia pestis, the bacteria causing plague, established in rodents and fleas, spread through Europe from Asia along established traveller routes (the Silk Road) and caused three devastating human pandemics [3] . A special characteristic of zoonotic infections is that they can re-emerge just when they are considered to be under control or eliminated because they can go into hiding in the animal reservoirs so there is no possibility for complacency. Travellers will act as sentinels for infections but also as disseminators, sometimes even as \"super spreaders\". Mass gathering events such as the Hajj have the potential to amplify the exposure potential to certain pathogens and travel restrictions may need to be enforced.",
