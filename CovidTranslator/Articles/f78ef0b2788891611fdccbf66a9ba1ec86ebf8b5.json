Canonical APP proteolysis occurs via \u03b1-, \u03b2-, and \u03b3-secretases. APP is also actively degraded by protein degradation systems. By pharmacologically inhibiting protein degradation with ALLN, we observed an accumulation of several novel APP C-terminal fragments (CTFs). The two major novel CTFs migrated around 15 and 25 kDa and can be observed across multiple cell types. The process was independent of cytotoxicity or protein synthesis. We further determine that the accumulation of the novel CTFs is not mediated by proteasome or calpain inhibition, but by cathepsin L inhibition. Moreover, these novel CTFs are not generated by an increased amount of BACE. Here, we name the CTF of 25 kDa as \u03b7-CTF (eta-CTF). Our data suggest that under physiological conditions, a subset of APP undergoes alternative processing and the intermediate products, the 15 kDa CTFs, and the \u03b7-CTFs aret rapidly degraded and/or processed via the protein degradation machinery, specifically, cathepsin L.",

Alternatively, APP can be cleaved by \u03b2-secretase [\u03b2-site APP-cleaving enzyme (BACE)], releasing the sAPP\u03b2 ectodomain, 1 and the remaining \u03b2-CTF is then processed by the same \u03b3-secretase, generating A\u03b2 and AICD. 2 Three additional cleavage sites, \u03b4-, \u03b5-, and \u03b6-cleavages, have been reported 3-5 ( Figure 1A) .

To investigate the role of protein degradation systems in APP metabolism, we utilized ALLN, a general inhibitor of protein degradation. [20] [21] [22] [23] We found that in na\u00efve HEK293 cells, treatment with ALLN led to an accumulation of APP fragments ( Figure 1B-D) . This accumulation included the APP C-terminal fragments (CTFs), but not the full length APP (FL-APP). Specifically, \u03b1-CTF was the only abundant CTF species in the vehicle group and was easily identified by two different APP C-terminal antibodies [C1/6.1 and G12A ( Figure 1B ,D, black straight arrow)]. \u03b2-CTF ran ~2 kDa higher than \u03b1-CTF and was recognized by C1/6.1, G12A, and 6E10, the latter of which recognized the N-terminal sequence of A\u03b2 ( Figure 1B -D, black arrowhead). AICD was detected by C1/6.1 and G12A ( Figure 1B ,D, black curved arrow), but not 6E10, and migrated faster than the \u03b1-CTF. The concomitant accumulation of AICD suggested that \u03b3-secretase inhibition was not responsible for the buildup of CTFs upon ALLN treatment. Instead, a common degradation pathway for CTFs and AICD may be affected. This view is supported by previous studies that showed that cathepsins, one of the targets of ALLN, mediate the degradation of both CTFs and AICD. 6, 7 Interestingly, we also observed the appearance of several hitherto undocumented APP fragments, including a 25 kDa CTF (red arrowhead, Figure 1B -D), a 15 kDa CTF (blue arrow, Figure 1B -D), and two less intense fragments migrating at 18 and 20 kDa, which were more visible upon long exposures (orange arrowheads, Figure 1B ,D). The novel 25 and 15 kDa CTFs were recognized by C1/6.1, G12A, and 6E10 ( Figure 1B-D) . These ALLNinduced changes were accompanied by an increase in the level of secreted A\u03b2 40 , which has been observed previously 24 ( Figure 1E ).",

Inhibiting protein degradation would lead to accumulation of unwanted protein, disrupting normal cellular function and possibly inducing apoptosis. 27 Therefore, it is possible that ALLN-induced accumulation of the novel APP CTFs is due to ALLN-induced cytotoxicity. To test this, we measured the amount of LDH released into the cell medium as a way to assess cytotoxicity. As shown in Figure 4A , there was no significant difference in the amount of LDH release between cells treated with 5 \u03bcM ALLN or vehicle for 24 h (p = 0.734). Triton X-100 (2%) treatment served as a positive control and corresponded to 100% cytotoxicity. To test whether the accumulation of novel APP fragments was irreversible, na\u00efve HEK293 cells were treated with 5 \u03bcM ALLN for 24 h and then changed into drug-free medium for different periods of time before cell lysates were collected. As shown in Figure 4B , the level of accumulation of novel fragments, particularly the 25 and 15 kDa CTFs (indicated by red and blue arrowheads, respectively), decreased as the time in drug-free medium increased. This suggests ALLN-induced changes were reversible.",

Specifically, we utilized the mouse fibroblast TS20 cell line, which carries an endogenous mutation in the E1 ubiquitin activating gene, making it temperature-sensitive. At 35 \u00b0C, the E1 ubiquitin activating enzyme is functional, but at 39 \u00b0C it is inactive, precluding ubiquitination of protein. 16 After treatment of TS20 cells with ALLN at 35 \u00b0C, we observed the appearance of the 15 kDa CTF, but not the 25 kDa CTF. This is most likely due to cell type difference. However, this cell line can still be utilized to study the 15 kDa CTF. We reason that if the 15 kDa CTF is ubiquitinated, it should not accumulate if ALLN treatment is performed at 39 \u00b0C, when E1 enzyme is inactivated. However, we found that its accumulation was unperturbed at 39 \u00b0C ( Figure 5D ), indicating that the generation of the 15 kDa CTF is independent of ubiquitinaton. Moreover, no novel APP CTFs were observed in cells treated with vehicle at 39 \u00b0C, indicating that the degradation of the 15 kDa CTF was also independent of ubiquitination.",

It is also important to note that the \u03b7-CTF could potentially be a cluster of two or more fragments close in size, because in some of our Western blots, two fragments were visible. Attempts to immunoprecipitate the novel fragments for sequencing were not fruitful, because of the following factors. First, the \u03b7-CTF migrates at the same molecular mass as the immunoglobulin light chain via SDS-PAGE. Second, current commercially available APP C-terminal antibodies recognize the \u03b4and \u03b7-CTFs, as well as the canonical CTFs and FL-APP that are more abundant, making the enrichment process significantly less efficient for the novel CTFs. Future studies can improve the efficiency of enrichment by using custom antibodies targeting the predicted Nterminal sequence of the novel CTFs.",

[46] [47] [48] Several lines of evidence have suggested a role of lysosome malfunction in AD pathogenesis. For example, autophagic vacuoles (AV), an early component of the lysosome degradation process, have been found to accumulate extensively in AD brains, suggesting impaired maturation of the lysosome degradation pathway. 49 These changes occur before extracellular plaque formation, and the AV are found to be rich in A\u03b2, along with \u03b2-CTF and \u03b3-secretase components, consistent with a role in A\u03b2 production. 49, 50 Interestingly, Glabe and colleague have shown that internalized A\u03b2 42 is largely resistant to degradation in the lysosmes. 51 They further demonstrated in HEK293 stably overexpressing APP that intracellular A\u03b2 42 can lead to altered APP catabolism and accumulation of a series of APP CTFs in size from 16 to 43 kDa. 52 These connections among aging, A\u03b2 42 , lysosome dysfunction, and altered APP metabolism make it intriguing to speculate whether the clearance of \u03b7and \u03b4-CTFs could be impaired in AD and play a potential role in the course of neurodegeneration.",
