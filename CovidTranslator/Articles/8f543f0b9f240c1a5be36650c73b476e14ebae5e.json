            "text": "Cancer treatment in the era of COVID-19 requires consideration of risks and benefits for patients and staff. 1 Recent data suggests patients who have cancer are at increased risk of infection and serious complications from COVID-19. 1 While ASCO has provided resources for patients receiving systemic therapy (https://www.asco.org/asco-coronavirus-information), there remains minimal granular guidance on the delivery of outpatient radiotherapy. Radiotherapy is delivered to nearly 50% of cancer patients, a particularly vulnerable group given their older age, frequent comorbidities, and underlying cancer diagnosis. 2 Prostate cancer is frequently treated with radiation and the most common solid tumor in men; it is a heterogeneous disease where timely therapy is indicated for some cases, and where watchful waiting, active surveillance, or deferral of treatment could be acceptable for others. 3, 4 Given the current epidemic crisis, delaying radiotherapy treatment (which requires multiple visits to healthcare facilities) for prostate cancer patients may potentially reduce the risk of iatrogenic exposure to COVID-19. At the healthcare system level, when clinically appropriate, reducing visits conserves limited hospital resources (e.g. personal protective equipment (PPE)) for use by health-care workers who will have to care for the potentially vast number of hospitalized COVID-19 patients. The decision to delay life-saving cancer treatment in a time of a resource-intensive pandemic represents a clinical conundrum without modern precedent. In these exigent circumstances, guidelines as to how to manage patients who present with prostate cancer would be valuable for the practicing clinician. This manuscript attempts guidance based on rapid expert opinion as to how to manage prostate cancer patients requiring radiotherapy during the COVID-19 pandemic.",

Ultimately the combined effect is that resources will be stressed and normal workflow will not be possible.",

Very few prostate cancer patients require an in person visit during a pandemic, and the minimal value of a digital rectal exam is less than the risk of COVID-19 exposure to patients and staff. Based on your institutional resources and legal requirements, on-treatment visits can also be performed utilizing telehealth technology to further reduce exposure risk. For patients that must be seen in clinic, consideration should be given to having patients wait in their cars or outside the facility prior to their appointment to promote social distancing given high surface stability of Additionally, the number of visitors with patients should be reduced to a minimum. Laboratory testing (e.g. PSA testing) should be performed in settings with minimal contact with staff or other patients, preferably outside of a busy hospital setting if possible. Routine PSA testing posttreatment can safely be deferred by \u22653 months in most instances.",

A simplified schema to help providers of how to perform SBRT is shown in Figure 2 . For centers without the ability to perform image guidance (cone-beam CT with or without fiducial markers), a 20 fraction regimen can be utilized to 60 to 62 Gy. 14, 15 For post-prostatectomy patients, a moderate hypofractionated regimen is preferred of 20 fractions to 52.5 Gy (NCT00541047). 16 For low volume M1 disease either SBRT or 6 Gy x 6 fractions as used on STAMPEDE arm H are safe and acceptable. 17 Dose constraints are provided in the Supplementary Appendix for the above listed regimens.",
