The structural features of the native virus confirm that the hemagglutinin spike is a dimer of VP4, substantiated by in vivo radiolabeling studies. Exchange of native VP4 with a bovine strain equivalent results in a poorly infectious reassortant. No VP4 spikes are detected in the three-dimensional reconstruction of the reassortant. The difference map between the two structures reveals a novel large globular domain of VP4 buried within the virion that interacts extensively with the intermediate shell protein, VP6. Our results suggest that assembly of VP4 precedes that of VP7, the major outer shell protein, and that VP4 may play an important role in the receptor recognition and budding process through the rough endopiasmic reticulum during virus maturation.",

            "text": "The mature rotavirion is -10OOA in diameter and exhibits T = 13 icosahedral symmetry. Rotavirus is classically described as a double-shelled virus, consisting of an inner shell composed of the major structural protein, VP8, and an outer shell composed of two structural proteins, VP4 and VP7 (Estes and Cohen, 1989) . The inner shell surrounds the core, which encompasses the genome and is composed predominantly of VP2, as well as minor amounts of VP1 and VP3. , based on the radial density profile computed from the threedimensional density map of the mature rotavirion, have proposed that rotavirus is a triple-shelled structure with an inner VP2 shell, an intermediate VP6 shell, and an outer shell of VP4 and VP7. The VP2 shell lies between the radii of 210 and 265 A. The existence of this shell is further substantiated by self-assembly of baculovirusexpressed VP2 into shells with a radius of -265 A (Labbe et al., 1991) . The knobby trimers of VP6 constitute the intermediate shell, between the radii of -265 and 350 A. The VP6 shell is bristly in appearance under the electron microscope and is perforated with 132 aqueous channels that lie on a T = 13 levo icosahedral lattice. VP7, a glycoprotein, forms a smooth outer shell of -30 A in thickness, between the radii of 350 and 380 A. This shell contains 132 aqueous channels that are in register with those in the VP6 shell. VP4, the minor of the two outer shell proteins, forms spikes that extend -120 A from the VP7 surface. These spikes are located at one edge of the peripentonal channels and have been suggested to be dimers based on binding of two monocional anti-VP4 Fab fragments per spike (Prasad et al., 1990) . It should be mentioned here that, consistent with the observations that rotavirus is a triple-shelled particle, we will refer to the mature particles as triple-shelled particles (previously described as double-shelled particles) and the particles that lack the outer shell as double-shelled particles (previously described as single-shelled particles).",

VP4 is the rotaviral hemagglutinin (Kalica et al., 1983 ) is a determinant of virulence and growth in ceil culture (Offit et al., 1986) , and appears to be involved in cell binding (Ruggeri and Greenberg, 1991; Bass et al., 1991) and penetration (Kaljot et al., 1988) . In addition, VP4 is susceptible to trypsin, resulting in the cleavage products VP5' (-60 kd) and VP8' (-28 kd). Proteolysis of VP4 significantly enhances viral infectivity (Espejo et al., 1981; Estes et al., 1981) . VP4 may also play a role in the maturation of progeny rotavirions (Maass and Atkinson, 1990) , in which double-shelled particles bud through the endopiasmic reticulum and become transiently enveloped prior to acquisition of the outer shell proteins (Estes, 1990) .",

We have chosen for our structural studies a well-characterized simian variant, SAl 1-4F, and an SAl 1-4F reassortant, R-004. R-004 is genetically identical to SA11-4F with the exception of the VP4 genome segment, which has been exchanged for the bovine strain 8223 equivalent. The exchange of VP4 results in a reassortant with significantly lowered stability and a different plaque morphology .

Structural features observed in the outer surface and inside of SAl l-4F are similar to those described for other strains of rotavirus (Prasad et al., 1990; Yeager et al., 1990) . The surface of the VP7 outer shell is noticeably rippled, with evidence for possible trimeric clustering of the VP7 molecules. The VP7 molecules are arranged on a T = 13 levo icosahedral lattice of -785 A in diameter. A total of 132 aqueous channels perforate the VP7 shell at three distinct locations. Twelve type I channels are located along the icosahedral 5-fold axes. Sixty type II channels are located at the 6-coordinated positions immediately surrounding the 5-fold axes. The 60 remaining type Ill channels are located at the other 6-coordinated positions that neighbor the icosahedral3-fold axes. The spikts, located at one edge of the type II channels, are -120 A in length from the surface of the VP7 shell. There is distinct asymmetry in the shapes of the type II and type Ill channel openings, while the type I channel has a circular opening. The type I channel is significantly smaller than the other two types. Figure 36 shows the surface representation of the R-004 Figure 3C has been rotated to provide different angles for viewing. Several observations are made: two molecules of VP4 appear to participate in spike formation, and VP4 appears to form multiple contacts with VP6. The dimeric nature of the VP4 hemagglutinin is most pronounced in the exterior VP4 portion, while the globular shape of the interior portion may allow the VP4 spike to make multiple contacts with the VP6 trimers that line the type II channels. See text for an explanation of the white arrows and arrowheads. (B) A bottom view of the VP4 spike reveals that the globular domain that lies beneath the VP7 surface is hollow in its center.",

However, the threedimensional structure of the reassortant shows no VP4 spikes. Three possibilities could explain the absence of VP4 in the R-004 structure. First, the heterologous VP4 may be unstable during assembly of the progeny virions and, during purification, become dissociated from the virus. Second, the heterologous VP4 may be present on the R-004 progeny in stoichiometric proportions but be disordered so that no VP4 structure is detected after icosahedral averaging. Third, R-004 may be assembled in vivo without any VP4. Biochemical evidence indicates that the first possibility is correct. have shown that the instability of R-004 is largely a consequence of the interactions between heterologous (8223) VP4 and native (SAl l-4F) VP7. Unpurified R-004 can be neutralized by 2G4, a VPCspecific monoclonal antibody , suggesting that correctly folded VP4 is present on the R-004 particles. However, in the purified R-004 particles, a significantly decreased quantity of VP4 is seen by SDS-PAGE in comparison with SA114F. Furthermore, particle-associated VP4 decreases (along with infectivity) as storage time of the purified R-004 increases when measured by SDS-PAGE and plaque assay (D. C. and R. F. R., personal communication). Therefore, the most likely explanation for the loss of VP4 spikes from R-004 particles suggested by these results is that the heterologous VP4 becomes destabilized and falls off.",

Possible interpretations as to the identity of this globular mass include the following: first, it is the inward extension of the VP4 spike; second, it represents a conformational difference in VP6 between the native and the reassortant; or third, it is a new structural protein. The second interpretation is unlikely, since SAll-4F and R-004 are distinct only with regard to genome segment 4 and its protein, VP4. It isunlikelythat the heterologousVP4in R-004would cause such a large conformational change in either VP6 or VP7 that they would contribute significantly to the observed globular mass. Assuming a protein density of 1.30 g/cm3, the mass of the globular feature is about 60 kd. Such significant mass displacement in VP6 between the native and the reassortant structures is improbable. Furthermore, examination of the VP6 shell in the two structures shows no evidence of mass translocation in R-004. The third interpretation also is unlikely, as there is no evidence for a new structural protein by SDS-PAGE. The observed globular mass is clearly seen connected to the exterior of the VP4 spike. The difference between the two structures is localized only to this region, and the differences elsewhere are insignificant.

The dimeric state of the VP4 spike was initially suggested by Prasad et al. (1990) from a low resolution (-35 A) structure of the simian rotavirus strain SAll (clone 3) complexed with anti-VP4 Fab fragments. These studies revealed two Fab molecules bound to the bilobed structure of each spike. Subsequent structural studies of Yeager et al. (1990) at -37 A, also pointed out the bilobed feature of the spikes in another strain of rotavirus. These authors noted the discrepancies between the structural and biochemical results pertaining to the oligomeric state of VP4 and suggested the need for more experimental evidence. The dimeric nature of the VP4 spike is evident at the present resolution of 28 A. At this resolution, a large separation in the body of the spike is apparent, as well as the intertwining of the two strands of VP4.

Thus, the dimeric configuration is apparently asymmetric. The asymmetry of the spike can be seen clearly in the views provided by Figure 4A . This result is consistent with the result of Prasad et al. (1990) in which the two Fab fragments bound to the VP4 spike at different angles. Prasad et al. (1990) suggested that the Fab fragments exhibited different elbow angles. It is very likely that the antigenic sites recognized by the Fab fragments are not in structurally similar environments, resulting in different angles for Fab binding. One pertinent question is, to what advantage is this asymmetry? It is possible that the asymmetry is required for stabilizing interactions between quasi-equivalent VP7 and VP8 molecules. On the outer virion surface it appears that VP4 interacts with 2 molecules of VP7, but inside it appears that the large globular domain interacts with all six of the VP6 molecules surrounding the type II channel. However, it is possible that there are more specific interactions between the VP4 dimer and 2 of the 6 VP6 molecules.",

            "text": "The presence of a large globular domain internal to the outer shell raises interesting questions regarding the assembly of VP4 in the rotavirus particles. During progeny maturation, newly assembled double-shelled particles migrate from the viroplasm to the rough endoplasmic reticulum, through which they bud, resulting in a transiently enveloped particle (Estes et al., 1983) . The steps by which double-shelled particles become triple-shelled are poorly understood. One pending question is, at what stage does VP4 assembly take place, before or after the assembly of VP7? Our results favor the hypothesis that VP4 assembly precedes that of VP7and, thus, the budding event. It would be difficult for the VP4 internal domain, which is -70 A in diameter, to be incorporated into the rotavirion through the VP7 type II channels, which are only -55 A in diameter. VP4 is synthesized on the free ribosomes in the cytoplasm (Estes, 1990) . Examining Figure 30 , one can envision newly synthesized VP4 interacting with the VP6 of double-shelled particles prior to interaction with the rough endoplasmic reticulum membrane. Once assembled on the double-shelled particles, VP4 may aid in recognition of NS28, a nonstructural protein that has been implicated in mediating passage of double-shelled particles through the rough endoplasmic reticulum (Au et al., 1988) . Maass and Atkinson (1990) reported the interaction of NS28 with VP4 and VP7 in infected cells. More recent evidence indicates that the cytoplasmic C-terminus of NS28 has a binding site for both single-shelled particles and VP4 (Au et al., 1993) . Structural studies on double-shelled particles complexed with NS28 and VP4 will be of interest in this regard.",

The dimeric nature of the VP4 hemagglutinin can clearly be seen in our SA11-4F structure. Radiolabeling studies fur-;$avirus Hemagglutinin Structure ther support this conclusion. We also have found that the VP4 structure traverses the outer VP7 shell and interacts with the intermediate shell protein, VP6. The difference map between SAI 1-4F and the reassortant R-064 reveals a large globular domain beneath the VP7 shell that is part of the VP4 structure. This result suggests that VP4 assembly occurs prior to VP7 assembly and that VP4 might interact with double-shelled particles before budding through the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Future structural studies focusing on double-shelled particles complexed with VP4 should provide better insight into the maturation process of rotavirus.",

It has been shown to be more stable than the standard SAl 1 and is purified at higher yields . Because of these qualities, we have chosen this variant for our structural studies. The second, reassortant virus R-004, was derived from a cross of SAl14F and the bovine rotavirus 8223. R-004 contains all SA114F genome segments except segment 4. Genome segment 4 and its encoded VP4 are derived from 8223 in R-004 (Chen et al., 1989) . In contrast with SA114F, R-004 is very unstable and can be purified only to low yield .

The virus suspension (-5 ul) was placed onto a carboncoated holey grid, blotted, and plunged into a bath of liquid ethane (-1 SOY& The frozen-hydrated specimen was transferred under liquid nitrogen to a GATAN cryoholder and observed in a JEOL 1200 transmission electron microscope at 100 kV and a specimen temperature of -185OC. Micrographs with regions of interest were recorded as focal pairs with intended sequential underfocus settings of -1 pm and -2 pm, using low electron dose of -5 e-/k with a nominal magnification of 30.008 x Computer Image Processing Micrographs were digitized using a Perkin-Elmer Micro-10 microdensi-tome\\er with a step size of 25 pm2 per pixel, which corresponds to 8.33 A in the object. Individual particles were boxed into a 128 x 128 pixel region, floated, and masked with a suitable radius. The threedimensional reconstruction procedure is similar to that used in earlier studies (Crowther, 1971; Fuller, 1987; Baker et al., 1990; Prasad et al., 1992 . Both SA114F and R-004 reconstructions were generated by particles chosen from a single micrograph. The center of each particle (corresponding to the phase origin) was determined using cross-correlation methods. The orientation of each particle was determined by a common lines procedure (Crowther, 1971; Fuller, 1987) which makes use of the icosahedral symmetry. Particles in the image further from focus, which exhibits enhanced contrast, were used to find the orientations of the corresponding particles in the image closer to focus. The images closer to focus were used for the threedimensional reconstruction. Only those orientations that gave rise to a phase residual value of less than 50\u00b0 were considered for the reconstruction. The phase origins and orientations were refined iteratively using intra-and interparticle refinement methods. Once a welldistributed set of particles was established (-40 particles), the threedimensional density map was generated using cylindrical expansion. The reconstructions were computed to a resolution of -28 A, as judged by the phase residual values. Surface representations of the three-dimensional maps were generated and displayed with IRIS Explorer (Silicon Graphics; .",

Two steps were carried out before computing the difference map between native and reassortant structures. In the first step, particles were scaled in Fourier space to account for the possible magnification differences between the two micrographs. The appropriate radial scale factor was computed by calculating the average phase residual for the 80 cross common lines in a pair-wise comparison of the particles, using one particle from the SA114F set as a template. The radial scale factor was varied between 0.85 and 1 .I 5 at an interval of 0.01, and the phase residual for the cross common lines was computed as a function of the radial scale factor. The magnification difference between the micrographs was determined to be -0.8%.",

This factor was previously estimated to be about 7% by Toyoshima and Unwin (1988) . Smith and Langmore (1992) have suggested that their estimation of 14% could be due to thicker ice. To embed the virus particles completely, the ice thickness has to be more than 1008 A. Hence, we chose the value of 14%. Since the reconstructions were carried out to a resolution lower than that corresponding to the first minimum of CTF, no corrections to phases were necessary.",

            "text": "To calculate the CTF, the precise defocus value must be known. To calculate the value of defocus we made use of the Fresnel fringe (white ring) that is seen gracing the periphery of the particle images. The Fresnel fringes arise owing to the interference between the scattered and unscattered electrons. In focus, the particle edge, representing asharp discontinuity in the object, has low contrast, and the Fresnel fringe is not perceptible. When defocused, these fringes are clearly seen, and their width is directly proportional to the level of defocus (Hall, 1966) . The Fresnel fringe manifests itself as a deep valley at a radius corresponding to the outer surface in the radial density plot computed from the three-dimensional density maps (Figure 2) . We varied the defocus value between 0.5 urn and 2.5 pm with an initial interval of 0.2 urn to determine a rough estimate of the defocus value, and later an interval of 0.1 urn to refine our estimate. For each defocus value within the range specified above, the amplitudes in the particles within the first minimum were corrected for the CTF, using C. value of 5.4 mm and a 0 value of 14%. The three-dimensional reconstruction was computed using these corrected amplitudes. A radial density plot was then generated, following the procedure described in from the CTF-corrected reconstructions and examined to see if the minimum from the Fresnel fringe had flattened. Using the disappearance of the minimum in the radial density plots as an indicator, the appropriate defocus value for each reconstruction was determined. This minimum flattens out for SAI l-4F when using a defocus value of 2.2 urn and for R-004 when using a defocus value of 1.6 urn. For confirmation, we also calculated the defocus value of the corresponding micrograph of the focal pair of SAl l-4F, which is 1 urn further from focus, and found the defocus value to be 3.2 urn. The evaluation of the defocus values using the Fresnel fringe is possible only because of the relatively smooth outer surface of the rotavirus particles.",

Arrows point to the plots without CTF corrections. The deep valley observed at -365 A in the plots of the uncorrected maps is due to the Fresnel fringe. The major peaks at -360. -290, and -240 A represent the VP7, VP6 and VP2 shells, respectively. The radial extensions of these shells ate indicated by the double-headed arrows. Below the radius of -200 A, the density contributions are expected to beduetogenomicRNA.
