Yet an instructor, in newly considering this suite of interrelated pedagogical strategies, faces a number of important instructional choices. Different features and their related values and learning outcomes are profiled here, including: the level of student autonomy; instructional focus on content, skills development, or nature-of-science understanding; the role of history, or known outcomes; scope, clarity, and authenticity of problems provided to students; extent of collaboration; complexity, in terms of number of interpretive perspectives; and, perhaps most importantly, the role of applying versus generating knowledge.",

Contextualizing the learning contributes both to student motivation and to the making of meaning (construed by many educators as central to functional memory and effective learning). The cases and problems are not merely supplemental illustrations or peripheral sidebars, but function centrally as the very occasion for learning. This style of learning resonates with views of cognitive scientists that our minds reason effectively through analogy and models, as much as through the interpretation and application of general, abstract principles.",

As students work on cases or problems, they typically exercise and hone skills in research, analysis, interpretation, and creative thinking. In addition to benefiting from practice, students may also reflect explicitly on their experience and thereby deepen their understanding of scientific practices. But such lessons do not emerge automatically. The instructor must make deliberate choices and design activities mindfully to support this aim.",

            "text": "In these three ways, PBL and CBL have proven valuable in many settings and hold promise more widely. An instructor first venturing into the realm of CBL and PBL, however, may easily be overwhelmed by the variety of approaches and the occasional contradictions among them. The literature is vast and includes sometimes conflicting claims about appropriate or ideal methods. This paper aims to introduce some of the key dimensions and to invite reflection about the respective values and deficits of various alternatives. It hopes to inform pedagogical choices about learning objectives and foster corresponding clarity in classroom practice. It also hopes, indirectly, to promote clarity on values and learning outcomes among current practitioners and in educational research and to provide perspective on the discord among advocates of specific approaches. 1 The first two sections below introduce CBL and PBL, respectively, as instructional strategies reflecting certain values. (A teacher might well adopt both simultaneously.) Beyond these basics, there are many dimensions or distinctions to consider, addressed in successive sections (and summarized in Table 1 ). The beginner who ventures further into the literature on PBL and CBL will soon encounter additional programmatic acronyms, taxonomies, and occasionally exclusive definitions. Here, I follow a perspective based on multiple independent dimensions and values to avoid many problematic boundary disputes. 2 In addition, PBL gained recognition largely from applications in professional education-medical, business, and law schools (Butler et al., 2005) . These instructional contexts tend to emphasize training. Contemporary science education, by contrast, tends to highlight student-based inquiry and understanding of scientific practices (National Research Council, 2012) . The original approaches, as models, may need adapting. Most notably, the difference in context, between learning how to apply knowledge and learning how knowledge is generated, can be critical, as described below. The principles surveyed here can help guide the teacher in crafting an appropriate instructional design to accommodate specific contexts and values.",

However, this paper includes many additional distinctions relevant to the outcomes when adopting and adapting CBL or PBL. 2 Various advocates often present their own characterizations as the exclusive method (e.g., Barrows, 1994; Savery, 2006) . Categorization varies. For example, Herreid (2003) contends that PBL is just a subspecies of CBL, while Barrows (1998) , credited with formalizing PBL, expresses dismay at the variety of practices called PBL compared with what he considers \"authentic PBL.\" Focusing on distinctions in pedagogical approaches encourages one to think more rigorously about educational values and aims. For example, is knowing content the ultimate aim? To what degree is understanding scientific practice and/or its cultural contexts also important? What are the aims regarding analytical or problem-solving skills-or learning how to learn beyond the classroom? Is student motivation, or engagement in learning, a goal? Does one hope to shape student attitudes about the value or authority of science-or to recruit more students into scientific careers or to promote greater gender or ethnic balance? What role is afforded to student autonomy, either in shaping one's own learning trajectory or as an independent thinker? Possible outcomes range from traditional conceptual content to skills, attitudes, and epistemic understanding. Different methods foster different outcomes. The goal here is to help one clarify one's aims and align them with the appropriate strategies or teaching tools. 3",

A focus on just the nitrogen cycle alone may forsake a broader awareness of other mineral cycles and their general role in ecosystems.) Nevertheless, a carefully constructed curriculum may use complementary cases to cover standard curricular content (see Schwartz et al., 1997) . On the other hand, some evidence indicates that learning occurs primarily, or most vividly, through exemplars (Kolodner et al., 1996; Gentner et al., 2003; Gentner and Colhoun, 2008) .

The introduction of cogent problems thus tends to amplify the basic virtues of using cases themselves-provided the problems are framed in ways relevant to the student. Almost any declarative knowledge can be rephrased as a question or problem. However, just as a case should be judiciously selected, a problem should be properly framed and contextualized if it is indeed to be motivational. The teacher who begins, without context, \"Today we study the pancreas; now, what is a pancreas?,\" does not engage student interest. Indeed, students can easily spot a rhetorical problem or pseudoproblem. \"Cookbook\" problems are just like cookbook labs. A teacher who needs to institute substantial external motivators for students to complete work, for example, has probably not found the proper problem to inspire active, student-centered learning.

In other cases, the problem engages students in practicing or developing problem-solving skills through firsthand experience.

Both styles, appropriately adapted, may also help foster deeper understanding of the nature of science (or of scientific practice, how science works, or the context of science broadly speaking). However, learning about the nature of science should be both explicit and reflective (Craven, 2002; Schwartz et al., 2004; Scharmann et al., 2005; Seker and Welsh, 2005) .

Close-ended problems can also (alas) foster cheating or rationalization (working backward from a target solution)-quite the opposite of what is intended. Where science content and/or informationfinding skills are the aim, PBL may tend toward close-ended problems. But it need not. In biology, in particular, problems might be reframed and answered at different organizational levels simultaneously. Close-ended problems may also be used to help develop problem-solving or analytical skillsbut then one should carefully tailor assessment accordingly to promote and reward those skills, rather than just to yield \"the right answer.\" Finally, close-ended problems tend to support naive epistemological understanding of knowledge as stable, predetermined, and authority based (Schommer, 1990) .",

Here, a student learns, first, that problem solving or research may not be exclusively individual or univocal: That is, it does not unfold according to some universal linear algorithm (such as \"the\" scientific method). Multiple perspectives may also prove an asset. Other viewpoints may reveal alternative solutions not readily envisioned within a particular mind-set or background.

When varying perspectives interact, one can enhance ways to analyze a problem or imagine its solution. Here, the instructional goal is to guide students in learning discursive skills, such as active listening, that contribute to such social-level analysis. Even criticism may have a positive role, exposing weak assumptions or increasing rigor of evidence. Tolerating criticism may an emotional or attitudinal skill, but it seems to have epistemic value. In yet other cases, in which interpretations conflict, students may learn skills in negotiating solutions or finding creative ways to accommodate apparently incompatible views (Fisher et al., 1991 Montgomery [2010] on glacial geology in 1843). Designated roles provide students a concrete perspective for interpreting a case or problem, which can serve as additional grounding. Unfamiliar roles (or sides in a debate) can also enhance appreciation of alternative perspectives. Even when students continue to work primarily on their own, however, one may still find a fruitful learning role for an exchange of multiple perspectives.",

Consider, for example, a series of challenges posed by one introductory college biology teacher at Radford University. First, students are asked to explain why a particular experimental control is appropriate in a given lab. One lab later, they identify the appropriate control themselves. In the next lab, they select their own variable to investigate and the corresponding control.

Instruction may well begin with modeling skills: providing behavioral exemplars that can be readily applied to similar cases through simple analogy. In addition, problem-solving activities should be scaffolded, or given an incomplete but supportive structure. Teachers may note that problem solving in knowledge-generating cases may simultaneously yield a form of basic epistemological learning: that is, students come to understand that the ability to learn occurs incrementally, based on learning how to learn, and that it is not fixed (or innate; Schommer, 1990) .",

Also, while parading the virtues of critical thinking or higher-order thinking skills, introductory presentations may disregard the implicit epistemic or nature-of-science lessons. For example, problem cases that apply knowledge may convey content well, but simultaneously present science as a reservoir of pre-established knowledge. They may eclipse epistemic understanding about how science generates new knowledge. Indeed, every science lesson indirectly conveys a message about scientific practices and the nature of scientific knowledge. The effective instructor mindfully manages these lessons, aware of potentially unintended outcomes.",

Likewise, participation in knowledge-generating cases, whether direct or vicarious, seems integral to learning or appreciating the nature of scientific research. Similarly, historical cases seem important to learning certain core nature-of-science themes. Finally, to develop more sophisticated epistemological perspectives, students should be exposed to complex cases (complex structure of knowledge), historical cases (conceptual change), knowledge-generating cases (empiricism as a source of authority), and successful experience in problem solving (active role of the knower; Schommer, 1990) .
