            "text": "Oxidative stress and chronic low-grade inflammation in the lungs are associated with aging and may contribute to age-related immune dysfunction. To maintain lung homeostasis, chronic inflammation is countered by enhanced expression of proresolving/antiinflammatory factors. Here, we show that age-dependent increases of one such factor in the lungs, a phospholipase A 2 (PLA 2 ) group IID (PLA 2 G2D) with antiinflammatory properties, contributed to worse outcomes in mice infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Strikingly, infection of mice lacking PLA 2 G2D expression (Pla2g2d \ue032/\ue032 mice) converted a uniformly lethal infection to a nonlethal one (>80% survival), subsequent to development of enhanced respiratory DC migration to the draining lymph nodes, augmented antivirus T cell responses, and diminished lung damage. We also observed similar effects in influenza A virus-infected middle-aged Pla2g2d \ue032/\ue032 mice. Furthermore, oxidative stress, probably via lipid peroxidation, was found to induce PLA 2 G2D expression in mice and in human monocyte-derived macrophages. Thus, our results suggest that directed inhibition of a single inducible phospholipase, PLA 2 G2D, in the lungs of older patients with severe respiratory infections is potentially an attractive therapeutic intervention to restore immune function.",

            "text": "Aging is associated with a decline in immune function, generally termed immunosenescence (Caruso et al., 2009; Cannizzo et al., 2011) , which in turn is often linked to age-related increases in oxidative stress (De La Fuente and Miquel, 2009) . Oxidative stress associated with aging has been attributed to the initiation and maintenance of chronic low-grade inflammation (\"inflammaging\"; Cannizzo et al., 2011) . A consequence of immunosenescence is that many viral infections are more severe in aged individuals (Chen and Subbarao, 2007; Assiri et al., 2013; Saad et al., 2014; Alsolamy, 2015) . Agedependent changes in susceptibility are especially striking in patients with the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) or the recently identified Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), both caused by coronaviruses (SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV). In the 2002-2003 SARS epidemic, all patients under 24 yr of age survived, whereas 6, 15, and >50% of patients aged 25-44, 45-64, and >65 yr of age, respectively, succumbed to the infection, with many developing acute respiratory distress syndrome (Donnelly et al., 2003; Nicholls et al., 2003; Chen and Subbarao, 2007) . This marked age-dependent increase in mortality is also observed in mice and nonhuman primates infected with SARS-CoV (Nagata et al., 2008; Day et al., 2009; Smits et al., 2010; Frieman et al., 2012) . For example, 6-10-wk-old C57BL/6 mice are highly resistant to SARS-CoV and remain asymptomatic even in the absence of interferon signaling (Frieman et al., 2010) , whereas as mice age from for maintaining lung homeostasis and for prostaglandin production, we initially examined CD11c + cells harvested from young and middle-aged mice for global changes in gene expression. Expression levels of 186 genes changed during aging, with many involved in antigen presentation and inflammation ( Fig. 1 B and Table S1 ). Many of these were predicted to contribute to a chronic inflammatory response. However, our previous study showed that levels of a prostaglandin with antiinflammatory properties, PGD 2 , were elevated in aged mice (confirmed in Fig. 1 A) and contributed to poor outcomes after SARS-CoV infection (Zhao et al., 2011) . Therefore, we next focused on genes involved in the AA pathway, including several phospholipases, cyclooxygenases, and synthases, which could modulate PGD 2 levels in the lungs. Of all the genes in the AA cascade, only levels of secreted phospholipase A 2 group IID (PLA 2 G2D) were significantly higher in CD11c + cells in the lungs of middle-aged compared with young mice (using twofold differences as a cutoff; Fig. 1 , C and D). We confirmed these results by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) analyses of CD11c + cell RNA by separating CD11c + and CD11c \ue032 cells from the lungs of naive young and middle-aged mice using magnetic beads and quantifying the expression of PLA 2 G2D mRNA (Fig. 2 A) . We observed 25-30 fold higher expression of PLA 2 G2D mRNA in lung CD11c + compared with CD11c \ue032 cells from middle-aged mice. Comparison of CD11c + cells from young and middle-aged mice revealed that PLA 2 G2D was expressed at levels >50-fold higher in middleaged mice (Fig. 2 A) . Flow cytometric analysis also showed higher expression of PLA 2 G2D in CD11c + compared with CD11c \ue032 cells on a per cell basis in both young and middle-aged mice, as measured by mean fluorescent intensity (MFI; Fig. 2 B ). In addition, middle-aged mice harbored a higher frequency of CD11c + cells expressing PLA 2 G2D compared with young mice (Fig. 2 C) .",

To address whether T reg cells are an additional source for PLA 2 G2D, we depleted CD4 T cells, which includes T reg cells, from middle-aged mice and analyzed lungs for expression of PLA 2 G2D. We observed no changes in the mRNA expression of PLA 2 G2D after CD4 T cell depletion ( Fig. 2 E) , suggesting that CD4 T cells, including T reg cells, are not a major source of PLA 2 G2D in the lungs.",

T cell priming to SARS-CoV requires migration of respiratory DCs (rDCs) from the lungs to the mediastinal LNs (MLN). Primed T cells then migrate back to the lungs. We previously showed that rDC migration was greatly decreased in uninfected and SARS-CoV-infected aged compared with young mice. Concomitant with this decreased rDC migratory capacity was an increase in prostaglandin D 2 (PGD 2 ) in the lungs (Zhao et al., 2011) . PGD 2 , an eicosanoid with both proinflammatory and antiinflammatory/proresolving properties is a downstream metabolite of arachidonic acid (AA; Samuelsson et al., 1987; Rossi et al., 2000; Straus et al., 2000; Serhan, 2014) . PGD 2 binds to two different G-protein-coupled receptors: DP1 expressed on macrophages and DCs (antiinflammatory) and DP2 expressed on Th2 cells (proinflammatory). PGD 2 signaling through the DP1 receptor on respiratory DCs (rDCs) and alveolar macrophages (AMs) in the naive and virus-infected lung, results in, among other effects, decreased CCR7 expression (Hammad et al., 2007; Zhao et al., 2011) . This, in turn, results in decreased rDC migration from the lungs to the MLN and poor T cell responses.",

We used middle aged (10-13 mo) mice, since these mice, like middleaged SARS patients, are much more susceptible to the infection than young (6-8 wk) mice, but have not yet developed many of the features of immunosenescence observed in aged (>18 mo animals) and are easier to obtain. Analysis of several genes involved in AA metabolism and oxidative stress in the lungs revealed, most strikingly, that levels of a phospholipase, PLA 2 G2D, increased as mice aged. Phospholipases hydrolyze phospholipids to release long-chain fatty acids that are further metabolized sequentially by cyclooxygenases and synthases to yield various lipid mediators. In particular, PLA 2 G2D is an enzyme that predominantly contributes to antiinflammatory/proresolving lipid mediator expression (Miki et al., 2013) . Therefore, we reasoned that age-related increases in PLA 2 G2D could contribute to a delayed immune response and poor outcomes after SARS-CoV infection by up-regulating expression of such lipid mediators. Here, we identified age-related alterations in PLA 2 G2D expression in the lungs of uninfected and SARS-CoV-infected mice. Infection of middle-aged mice lacking PLA 2 G2D expression (Pla2g2d \ue032/\ue032 ) with SARS-CoV resulted in enhanced DC migration to the MLN and antiviral T cell responses, more rapid virus clearance and most remarkably, significantly decreased mortality compared with wild-type (Pla2g2d +/+ ) mice.

We initially analyzed mice infected with SARS-CoV because middle-aged but not young C57BL/ 6 mice succumb to infection with this virus, mimicking the human disease (Fig. 5 A; Frieman et al., 2012; Zhao et al., 2012) . Because mortality in middle-aged mice begins at 4 d after SARS-CoV infection, we investigated whether levels of lipid mediators, including PGD 2 , changed at this time. Expression levels of PLA 2 G2D increased in both young and middle-aged mice after infection (Fig. 5 B) . Further, pulmonary lipid profiling on day 4 postinfection (p.i.) revealed significant increases in lung levels of free PUFAs such as AA, EPA, and DHA in middle-aged mice but less so in young mice Hence, we reasoned that higher expression levels of PLA 2 G2D in the lungs of middle-aged mice would result in perturbation in lipid metabolism and that lipid mediators with proresolving functions, other than PGD 2 , would also be produced at higher levels. To investigate this possibility, we performed electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) to determine the levels of free polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), as well as their oxygenated metabolites, including PGD 2 , in the lungs of naive young and middle-aged mice (Fig. 4 , B-D). Initial analyses revealed altered profiles of lipid mediators with both pro-and antiinflammatory function in the lungs of middleaged relative to young mice. Levels of free PUFA such as AA (\ue0766) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; \ue0763) were not significantly different between the groups, whereas the level of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) was higher in middle-aged mice relative to young mice ( Fig. 4 B) . AA metabolites with antiinflammatory (PGE 2 and PGD 2 ) and proinflammatory properties (PGF2\ue061 and Thromboxane [TX] B 2 [a TXA 2 metabolite]) were produced at higher levels in the lungs of middle-aged mice compared with young mice, but levels of 6-keto-PGF1\ue061 (a PGI 2 metabolite) did not differ between the groups (Fig. 4 , C and D).",

To determine whether this was the case, we first instilled OVA-FITC intranasally (i.n.) into uninfected middle-aged Pla2g2d +/+ and Pla2g2d \ue032/\ue032 mice and analyzing MLN 18 h later for OVA-FITC + rDCs, indicative of migration from the lungs. We observed that a higher frequency and number of rDCs migrated to the MLN in the absence of PLA 2 G2D (Fig. 6 F) . We next investigated whether rDC migration was augmented in mice infected with SARS-CoV by instilling CFSE i.n. into middle-aged Pla2g2d +/+ and Pla2g2d \ue032/\ue032 mice 6 h before infection. 18 h p.i. MLN were harvested and analyzed for the frequency of rDCs that migrated from lungs (CD11c + MHCII + CFSE + population).

Further, the absence of PLA 2 G2D augmented CD8 T cell cytolytic activity, measured in an in vivo killing assay (Fig. 7 D) . To investigate if there was also a T cell-intrinsic defect in Pla2g2d +/+ mice, we performed a set of adoptive transfer experiments, transferring splenocytes from uninfected Pla2g2d +/+ or Pla2g2d \ue032/\ue032 mice to CD45 disparate Pla2g2d \ue032/\ue032 or Pla2g2d +/+ mice, respectively, before SARS-CoV infection.

SARS-CoV-infected mice also show similar steep age-dependent changes in mortality, which we show is due, in large part, to increases in levels of a single secretory PLA 2 , PLA 2 G2D, as mice age. A hallmark of aging is lipid peroxidation and subsequent up-regulation of PLA 2 s (Brown et al., 2003; Sun et al., 2004; Hermann et al., 2014) and our results suggest that, in the lungs, levels of PLA 2 G2D singularly increase as mice age. PLA 2 G2D is considered an antiinflammatory/proresolving enzyme, suggesting its up-regulation is actually a measure used in the lung to counter the low-grade chronic inflammation that occurs with aging (Franceschi et al., 2000; Miki et al., 2013) . In support of this notion, treatment with low doses of LPS, which induces oxidative stress and low-grade inflammation, resulted in PLA 2 G2D up-regulation both in CD11c + cells in the mouse lung (Fig. 10 C) and in human monocyte-derived macrophages (Fig. 10 E) . Further, interventions that diminish reactive oxygen species decreased PLA 2 G2D expression (Fig. 10 B) . A recent study demonstrated the proresolving role of PLA 2 G2D in the setting of contact dermatitis in mice; in its absence, resolution was prolonged (Miki et al., 2013) . PLA 2 G2D would be expected to have similar effects in ameliorating disease in the context of autoimmune disease.",

For this purpose, PBMCs were treated with macrophage colony stimulating factor (M-CSF) for 4 d, and the cell-adherent population was incubated with M-CSF in the presence or absence of low levels of LPS (0.1 ng/ml) for an additional 1-10 d. PLA 2 G2D expression was then assessed. In agreement with previous work (Miki et al., 2013) , LPS exposure for 1 d did not result in increased PLA 2 G2D levels (unpublished data). However, we observed increased PLA 2 G2D expression after chronic LPS treatment (10 d), and this was accompanied by increases in MDA levels, indicative of higher oxidative stress (Fig. 10 E) . Thus, chronic oxidative stress, a welldescribed aspect of aging in the human lung, results in increased PLA 2 G2D levels, which could contribute to age-dependent defects in the immune response to SARS-CoV and other respiratory pathogens. derived from \ue0763 fatty acids such as EPA and DHA (Serhan et al., 2002; Buckley et al., 2014; Serhan, 2014) . PLA 2 G2D is known to release free PUFAs into a substrate pool that can be further mobilized to produce proresolving lipid mediators such as DHA-derived resolvin D1 and EPA-derived resolvin E1 among many others (Serhan et al., 2002; Miki et al., 2013) . Notably, EPA levels were higher in the lungs of uninfected middle-aged compared with young mice (Fig. 4 B) , and both EPA and DHA production were higher in uninfected and infected Pla2g2d +/+ mice compared with their Pla2g 2 d \ue032/\ue032 counterparts (Figs. 4 H and 5 F). However we failed to detect any resolvins or protectins, the downstream metabolites of EPA or DHA in the lungs of mice, possibly reflecting low levels of these molecules in lung tissue. Notably, although EPA is higher in middle-aged compared with young lungs (DHA is nearing to significance; P = 0.12; Fig. 4 B) , SPMs are lower in the uninflamed peritoneum of aged compared with young mice (Arnardottir et al., 2014) , suggesting that age-dependent differences in baseline levels of these molecules are organ-specific and could possibly contribute to disease-specific outcomes.",

This specific Increased PLA 2 G2D expression by lung CD11c + cells results in up-regulation of several eicosanoids, with especially prominent effects on PGD 2 production (Figs. 4 D and 5, E and H) . Activation of the PGD 2 -DP1 signaling axis on rDCs results in decreased CCR7 expression so that DP1 antagonism results in augmented rDC migration to the draining LN in uninfected and SARS-CoV-infected mice (Hammad et al., 2003; Zhao et al., 2011) . Of note, inhibition of DC migration by PGD 2 /DP1 signaling is not confined to the lung, because, after skin invasion, Schistoma mansonii releases PGD 2 to inhibit Langerhans cell migration to the draining LN, delaying the initial immune response (Angeli et al., 2001) . Similar effects are observed in Pla2g2d \ue032/\ue032 mice infected with either SARS-CoV or IAV, resulting in enhanced T cell responses (Fig. 7, A , B, and D, and 9 B) and, in the case of SARS-CoV, improved survival (Fig. 8 A) .

            "text": "A key question is why SARS-CoV-infected mice are especially affected by age-dependent changes in PLA 2 G2D expression. One unique feature of SARS is that maximal virus titers in mouse lungs are detected within 24 h after infection (Fett et al., 2013) , nearly coincident with the time of maximal migration of rDCs from the lungs to the DLNs. Furthermore, coronavirus replication results in extensive membrane remodeling with the formation of double membrane vesicles and other membranous structures, the sites of viral RNA synthesis and assembly (Novoa et al., 2005; Knoops et al., 2008; Miller and Krijnse-Locker, 2008) . This virus-induced reorganization of the host cell membrane causes the accumulation of coneshaped lipids, specifically lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) or phosphatidylethanolamine (PE; Escrib\u00e1 et al., 1997; Lee and Ahlquist, 2003; Diaz et al., 2010; Lorizate and Kr\u00e4usslich, 2011; Xu and Nagy, 2015) . Because PLA 2 G2D specifically mobilizes PE to release AA and DHA (Miki et al., 2013) , robust replication of SARS-CoV during the first 24 h of infection likely increases the amount of PLA 2 G2D substrate. Additionally, LPC and PE may form large lipid aggregates; most secreted phospholipases, including PLA 2 G2D, exhibit a tendency to show increased activity when the substrate is presented in this form (Carman et al., 1995; Gelb et al., 1995) . Thus, SARS-CoV infection results in enhanced release of AA into the eicosanoid pathway, which increases the concentration of PGD 2 and downstream products of EPA and DHA, further dampening the immune response. Notably, similar processes may occur in patients with MERS-CoV infections, who also exhibit agedependent increases in susceptibility (Assiri et al., 2013; Saad et al., 2014; Alsolamy, 2015) .",

            "text": "In conclusion, it is likely that in the absence of challenge with a pathogen such as SARS-CoV, elevated PLA 2 G2D expression benefits the host by increasing the level of various immunosuppressive lipid mediators such as PGD 2 , thereby dampening the response to environmental antigens. However in the context of an infection, the higher basal levels of PGD 2 and other proresolving lipid mediators adversely affect the initiation of a protective innate immune response and ultimately adaptive immune response (Fig. 10 E) . Thus, therapeutic interventions that increase the levels of proresolving lipid mediators might have undesirable effects in the context of infection. However, these results also suggest that PLA 2 G2D would serve as a useful therapeutic target in the lungs of patients after infection with SARS-CoV and perhaps other respiratory viral pathogens, including MERS-CoV. Short-term targeting of a single inducible PLA 2 would avoid undesirable effects that might be observed by generalized inhibition of were diluted to a final concentration of 10% methanol (vol/vol) with water. For AA, PGD 2 , PGE 2 , PGF2\ue061, TXB 2 , and 6-keto-PGF1\ue061, internal standards were AA-d8, PGD 2 -d4, PGE 2 -d4, PGF2\ue061-d4, TXB 2 -d4, and 6-keto-PGF1\ue061-d4, respectively, all purchased from Cayman Chemical and added at the aforementioned concentration. For DHA and EPA, LTB 4 -d4 was used as the internal standard. Samples were centrifuged at 3,000 rpm for 10 min and the supernatant was subjected to solid phase extraction using a Strata-X 33 \u00b5m Polymeric Reversed Phase columns (60 mg/3 ml). Columns were purchased from Phenomenex, activated with 3 ml methanol, and washed with 3 ml water. Samples were eluted with 1 ml methanol, vacuum dried, and resuspended in 100 \u00b5l of mobile phase A. The analyses of PUFAs and their metabolites were performed using a Waters Acquity triple quadrupole mass spectrometer coupled with liquid chromatography (Acquity H class UPLC). Samples were then applied to an Acquity UPLC BEH C18 column (130 \u00c5, 1.7 \u00b5m, 2.1 mm \u00d7 100 mm) and fractionated using a step gradient with mobile phase A (63:37:0.02% water/acetonitrile/formic acid) and mobile phase B (1:1 acetonitrile/isopropanol) at a flow rate of 300 \u00b5l/min for most analytes. For DHA and EPA, the mobile phase A was 65:35:0.01% methanol/water/acetic acid and mobile phase B was 100% methanol with 0.01% acetic acid. Columns were run at a flow rate of 250 \u00b5l/min. Primary standards were analyzed in parallel with the samples to enable quantification of the endogenous lipids. Detection of each lipid was performed by multiple reaction monitoring.",
