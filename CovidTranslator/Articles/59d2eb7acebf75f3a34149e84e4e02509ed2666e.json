The infections often result in pneumonia, which is the single largest infectious cause of death in children worldwide and killed an estimated 935,000 children under the age of five in 2013 (1) . ARIs can be caused by viruses, bacteria, or fungi. The availability of improved diagnostic tools has led to the identification in recent years of viruses as an increasingly frequent cause of pneumonia (2) . Previous work from our group and others found that respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), seasonal influenza A (InfA), enterovirus (EV), and adenovirus (Ad) were the predominant pathogens in children with ARI (3) (4) (5) (6) . Adenovirus type 3 (Ad3) and Ad7 were the most prevalent serotypes of Ad that caused ARI (7, 8) , but in recent years adenovirus type 55 (Ad55) has also caused severe pneumonia and death in children and adults worldwide (9, 10) .",

One potential therapeutic option is passive immunotherapy with convalescent plasma or hyperimmune intravenous immunoglobulin (H-IVIG) (12) . Previous work has suggested that this approach might be an effective treatment for infections with Spanish InfA (H1N1), avian InfA (H5N1), 2009 pandemic InfA (H1N1), SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV), and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), among others (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) . However, few studies have been reported using this approach for the most prevalent viral pathogens. Infections with these common viruses have a lower fatality rate than those caused by the viruses listed above, but they cause a large number of severe ARIs (SARIs) and even deaths worldwide every year.",

Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), which is produced from a large pool of healthy volunteers with unknown NAb titers, has been used clinically for preventing and treating bacterial and virus infections (23) (24) (25) (26) (27) . And H-IVIG from vaccine-immunized donors has been used clinically for preventing and treating specific virus infections, such as rabiesvirus and HBV. Given the high infection rate in childhood of viruses causing ARIs, there may be high titers of NAbs against these pathogens in the adult population and, therefore, in IVIG. So healthy blood volunteers may be a suitable source of convalescent plasma. However, up to now, only a few reports have described a neutralizing activity against specific respiratory viruses in support of this hypothesis (28) (29) (30) (31) (32) (33) . Therefore, in the present study we has investigated the prevalence and serum titers of NAbs against the main viruses that cause ARIs, including RSV, seasonal InfA, EV [enterovirus 71 (EV71) and coxsackievirus A16 (CA16)] and Ad (Ad3), as well as those against a rare virus Ad55 which has caused several epidemic outbreaks in recent years, in healthy adults in southern China. We also evaluated the NAb titers against these viruses in commercially available IVIG to discuss the need for preparing H-IVIG from convalescent serum.",

We collected 96 serum samples from healthy donors and performed microneutralization assays to measure the titers of NAbs against several respiratory viruses. As shown in Figure 2 , only to Ad55, a high proportion of samples from healthy adult donors were negative for NAbs (>16); to the other five viruses the highest proportion of samples has NAb at titer 16-128. As shown in Table 1 Further comprehensive analyses were performed and frequency histograms were drawn to illustrate the impact of age on respiratory virus infection. The percentage of samples from age groups of 20-29, 30-39, and 40-49-yearold that were positive for Ad55 NAbs were 0%, 19.75%, and 40.625%, respectively, as demonstrated in Table 2 .

A high proportion of healthy adult donors were found to have NAbs against these common respiratory viruses ( Table 1 ). The high rates of vaccination against and infection with InfA may explain our finding that the highest proportion of NAb positive samples was for this virus and that many of the positive samples had high NAb titers against InfA.",

Our finding that a high percentage of the samples were positive for these viruses demonstrates the high infection rate of these viruses in the Chinese population. A sizable proportion of the samples had high NAb titers (>512) for InfA (25%) and Ad3 (17.71%). Although they were less abundant, some samples also had high NAb titers against RSV (9.38%), EV71 (1.04%), CA16 (3.13%), and Ad55 (4.17%). These results suggest that healthy blood volunteers may be a suitable source for convalescent plasma for use in treating SARIs and preparing blood banks against these specific viruses (20) . Clinically, SARIs are still common in southern China, especially in children and immunodeficient patients. Currently, these cases are sometimes treated using plasma with undetermined NAb titers as general supportive care. In these cases it may be more effective to use plasma with a high NAb titer. With these resources, the relationship between the NAb titer against respiratory viruses and the therapeutic effect could be studied. Additionally, the blood with high titers of NAbs against respiratory viruses also could be used to specifically screen for human neutralizing monoclonal antibodies against individual viruses. In this study, we used the InfA standard strain A/PR8/34 (H1N1), which was isolated over 80 years ago, to evaluate the prevalence of NAbs, and we found that 25% of the serum samples had high NAb titers against H1N1. This result could be explained by the presence of cross-reactive NAbs from natural infection with H1N1 (28, 31, (34) (35) (36) . However, due to the high variability in influenza virus antigenicity, it might be more appropriate to screen plasma using recent epidemic influenza strains.",

Unlike H-IVIG, standard IVIG is produced in the blood of healthy donors and has been widely used clinically for preventing infection. IVIG has also been successfully used for treating CMV infection and parvovirus B19 infection (26, 27) . Only H-IVIG has been used for treating infections with SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and H5N1, which is likely because of the low infection rates of these viruses in the population (12) . The high titers of NAbs against Ad3, and InfA ( Figure 4 ) that we found in samples from healthy donors suggest that Figure 4) ; therefore, high-dose IVIG may be needed for treating infections caused by these viruses. To our knowledge, there have been no studies testing the use of IVIG to treat infections with these viruses, but our results suggest that this treatment should be investigated. However, high-dose IVIG used in children may cause side effect, such as allergic reactions. And commercial IVIG is expensive. It is easy to understand that H-IVIG prepared only from sera with high titer NAb against specific virus would have a much higher titer NAb against this virus, and then could be used at a low-dose. Due to the presences of high NAbs against these viruses in adults, H-IVIG could be prepared from screened sera with high titer NAbs as personalized medicine which may be more economical and effective for treating specific respiratory virus infection. Ad55 is a new type of Ad, which was recombined from Ad14 and Ad11, and it has caused severe infections in China and other regions since 2006 (7) (8) (9) (10) . It is interesting to find that only a low proportion of samples from adult donors were positive for NAbs to Ad55, but that commercially available IVIG had a high NAb titer against this virus. These findings may be due to the fact that the commercially produced IVIG was prepared from healthy donors who came from a larger area. The low proportion of samples from our donors that were positive for NAbs against Ad55 suggests that there may be little protection in the population of southern China and indicates that this area should be frequently surveyed for Ad55 infection. The high titers of NAb against Ad55 in IVIG suggest that IVIG may be potentially effective as an early treatment for Ad55 infection and this possibility should be investigated further.",
