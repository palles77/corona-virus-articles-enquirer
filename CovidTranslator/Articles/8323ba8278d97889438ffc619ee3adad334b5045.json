Characteristics of some major human infectious diseases, divided into two sets: ones predominantly tropical or of tropical origin, and ones regularly occurring at temperate as well as tropical latitudes. Column 1: * = a crowd disease of large human populations (see text). Column 2: the pathogen causing the disease. Column 3: whether transmitted to humans by an animal vector, or else directly from another human and if so by what means (breathed-out air = aerosol, sexual, skin contact, etc.). Column 4: approximate duration, from infection until death or recovery. Column 5: case-fatality ratio in traditional human populations without modern medical treatment or nutrition (from ref. S1 and other sources). Column 6: whether patients who recover thereby develop long-lasting or lifetime immunity against re-infection. Columns 7 and 8: whether the pathogen has a reservoir apart from infected humans, either in the environment or in animals (from ref. S2 and other sources). The term \"reservoir\" means a non-human source of pathogens immediately capable of infecting humans without evolutionary change. Reservoirs may enable a pathogen to persist even in the absence of a susceptible human population large enough by itself to sustain the pathogen. Column 9: our tentative conclusion about the most likely source from which the pathogen reached humans. Column 10: to which of the five evolutionary stages explained in Box 1 we assign the disease. See Notes S1, S2, and S9 for further explanation, and for details and references on each disease. Note S1. Choice of diseases.",

Conclusions about the animal sources of a particular human microbe are obviously limited by testing bias --i.e., which animal species were selected for testing, and which pathogens were sought in them. Given that fact, a certain animal microbe currently considered to be the closest match to a corresponding human microbe might not be its closest relative at all; the true animal ancestor could eventually prove to be a microbe found in some animal species not yet studied. This is clearly true for rubella virus; its confinement to large human populations shows that it must have evolved within the last 11,000 years, and is thus likely still to bear a close relationship to some ancestral animal microbe, yet rubella virus has no remotely close relatives among known microbes, implying that we have not yet found its close animal relative. In the case of Plasmodium reichenowi of chimpanzees, we know of its existence just from one isolate; if that isolate hadn't been found, we would not know the closest relative of human P. falciparum. At present, it appears that smallpox is most closely related to camelpox, but that conclusion is tentative because there might be some more closely-related poxviruses still awaiting discovery. Camelpox itself might prove to be a misnomer; the virus has been isolated from camels but has rarely been sought in other species. It is of note that the identity of the We separate diseases into these two categories, based on their distributions and likely origins. There is little uncertainty about the 10 diseases that we denote as \"tropical\": nine are still largely confined to the tropics (although vivax malaria and yellow fever have also caused some seasonal outbreaks in areas within temperate latitudes), cholera arose in tropical Southeast",

In one study, however, a variola-specific PCR picked up only cowpox isolates, and not camelpox or other isolates S104 . One personal communication suggests that the closest extant relative of variola is tatera poxvirus, which affects African gerbils S105 , although Fenner notes that this and other poxviruses have not been well-studied S106 . In their recent genomic analysis of variola and other orthopoxvirus strains, Esposito et al.

Specifically, if one takes DALY values for the whole world as an objective (albeit not perfect) assessment of modern burdens, and if one ranks diseases according to DALY values, how far down the list should one go and primate origins. With one minor exception, all 10 analyses yielded qualitatively the same directions of differences for all three tests. (That single exception is that Stage-5 diseases barely outnumbered non-Stage-5 diseases among both tropical and temperate diseases on the minimum list, but that Stage-5 diseases predominated among temperate diseases while non-Stage-5 diseases predominated among tropical diseases on the maximum and intermediate lists). As expected merely from considerations of sample size, significance levels of the statistical comparisons were highest for the maximum lists (n = 25), lower for the intermediate list (n = 21), and lowest for the minimum list (n = 16).Thus, our conclusions are robust to variation in the selection criteria, provided that one agrees with our preference for DALY values as an objective assessment of modern disease burdens, and with our non-objective judgments about historic burdens. We encourage other authors who can think of other selection criteria to test them for comparison.Note S4. Paucity of major diseases before Stage 4Combining temperate with tropical diseases, 14 of our 25 major diseases are Stage-5 (confined to humans), 6 are Stage-4 (transmitted to humans both from animals and from other humans), and only 5 belong to Stage 2 (East African sleeping sickness, tetanus) or Stage 3 (Chagas' disease, plague, visceral leishmaniasis). The paucity of Stage-2 and Stage-3 diseases on our list of major human diseases inflicting high mortality is striking, because some Stage-2 and Stage-3 pathogens (such as anthrax, rabies, Ebola, and Marburg) are nevertheless virulent, feared, and objects of much attention. \u00c0 priori, one could have imagined that many of these virulent pathogens would have become major killers on the scale of smallpox and cholera --but few (notably, plague) actually have.",

Thus, many alternative outcomes are indeed possible, and only empirical data rather than \u00e0 priori reasoning can tell us the predominant outcomes.Why does it turn out that, among Stage-2 and Stage-3 diseases, only five have become major killers? At least some are clearly limited in their world toll by limited geographic range and/or low infection rates of animal hosts, inefficient transmission from infected animals to humans, or all three factors. For instance, although untreated rabies is always fatal, it is transmitted to humans only by bites of infected animals (usually dogs or bats), and relatively few dogs and bats become infected and then bite humans, so only a modest number of humans die of rabies. Similarly, while the case-fatality ratio of anthrax can be 20 -100%, human infections mainly involve people who handle infected livestock, but relatively few livestock are infected and few people shear sheep or prepare cowhides, hence anthrax's human death toll remains small. Among trypanosomiases, East African sleeping sickness currently infects (and would kill doi: 10.1038/nature05775 without treatment) several hundred thousand people, but only in tropical Africa within the ranges of its vector (tsetse flies) and of its infected animal hosts; and Chagas' disease in the New World tropics is also limited geographically by its vector (reduviid bugs) and animal hosts (and is now domestic than a wild mammal, because human contacts with domestic mammals are much closer and more frequent. Mumps may have arrived from pigs, smallpox from camels, and tuberculosis from cattle, but in each of these cases there remains some uncertainty about the ancestral pathogen's identity or host range or (in the case of tuberculosis) direction of spread.at least in the case of Chagas' disease, wild mammals are much more likely to have furnished the earliest ancestor, because the agent of Chagas' disease is still transmitted to humans today from over 150 species of wild animals, and Native Americans in tropical South and Central America (where Chagas' disease occurs) traditionally kept only few species and individuals of domestic animals (just dogs, llamas, Muscovy Ducks, and guinea pigs)S9  .",

For example, while anthrax, BSE, Ebola, and Marburg do kill a high fraction of infected victims (100% in the case of BSE), their inefficient transmission assures few infected victims; 100% of a small number is still a small number. Anthrax and BSE are not transmitted from human to human (unless by cannibalism and organ transplants in the case of BSE-type prions); anthrax is treatable by antibiotics; and human-to-human transmission of Ebola and Marburg fades out after a few transfers and is unlikely to occur in the first place outside of specific settings, such as rural hospitals lacking practices and supplies for controlling infections.to warrant. But we acknowledge that virulent pathogens currently exacting a low death toll due to inefficient transmission could become dangerous if they evolved new modes of more efficient transmission (e.g., by aerosolized respiratory droplets) --as may have almost occurred in 1989 with the Reston subtype of Ebola virus S10 .If not anthrax and Marburg, which pathogens do we instead fear? A straightforward prediction, often neglected in our focus on the exotic, is that some new pandemics will emerge from pathogen taxa of which strains have already caused historical pandemics. Prime candidates are two microbes persisting in animal and/or environmental reservoirs capable of generating new strains: influenza virus and, under local conditions of failing hygiene, possibly cholera. We envision these two important diseases of the past again becoming important diseases of the future. Another prime candidate is tuberculosis, of which new strains have arisen through the development of drug resistance, and which is already causing pandemics among human subpopulations with weakened resistance, such as HIV patients.A further prediction involves emerging pathogens transmitted by routes that render their spread difficult to control. Sexually transmitted diseases (STD's) fall in this category, because it is difficult to persuade us to abstain from or change our sexual behavior. HIV offers a grim warning: despite its swift and huge global impact, the AIDS epidemic would have been much worse if the sexual transmissibility of HIV (actually rather modest S11 ) had equaled that of other sexually transmitted agents such as HPV. Similarly, it would be difficult to control emerging pathogens transmitted by our pets (which increasingly include many exotic species as well as traditional domesticated breeds), in chains connecting wild or feral animals to outdoor pets to humans S12 .

Using their analyses of 16S rRNA and hsp65 genes, both Devulder et al. S120 and Kim et al. S121 grouped it with M. caprae (mainly cattle, plus red deer and wild boar), M. microti (voles and other mammals), M. bovis (cows and other mammals S122 ), and M. africanum (human, W./C. Africa) S123 . Devulder et al. also arrived at the same grouping when rpoB and sod genes were used. Krauss et al. S123 state, \"M. africanum is thought to be intermediate between M. tuberculosis and M. bovis; its retention as a distinct species is probably not justified\". Based on an analysis of genomic deletions, Mostowy et al. S122 suggest that M. tuberculosis diverged from the group prior to M. africanum, M. microti, M. pinnipedi, M. caprae, or M. bovis.
