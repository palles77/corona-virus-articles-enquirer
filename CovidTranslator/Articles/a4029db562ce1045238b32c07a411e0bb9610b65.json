            "text": "Many different methods for selecting recombinant viruses are available. The two simplest, and therefore preferable, methods are selection based on restoration of plaque size or coexpression of a fluorescent protein marker such as green fluorescent protein (GFP). Plaque size selection (Blasco and Moss, 1995) provides an extremely simple method of selecting recombinant vaccinia viruses that involves neither drugs nor reporter genes. The parental virus (vRB12) contains a deletion of most of the F13L gene, which prevents vaccinia virus from making normal-size plaques. The transfer vector pRB21 contains a segment of the F13L gene adjacent to the gene of interest, so that recombinant viruses will have a functional F13L gene and will make normal-size plaques that are easily distinguished from the pinpoint plaques of vRB12. Therefore, one merely needs to pick large plaques to isolate recombinant viruses. However, it is important to check that the virus is a double cross-over recombinant. Co-insertion of GFP or other fluorescent protein marker under control of a vaccinia promoter adjacent to the gene of interest allows easy identification of recombinant plaques using a fluorescence microscope. An example is plasmid pLW-44 (Table 14A .4.1) in which GFP is stably inserted into the recombinant virus. A modification of this method, transient GFP selection, is performed using a transfer vector in which a portion of one of the two vaccinia virus flanking regions that surround the cassette containing GFP and the foreign gene is also inserted between the GFP and foreign gene (Fig. 14A.4.2) . Thus, the GFP gene is flanked by direct repeats from one vaccinia virus flank. GFP-expressing plaques are isolated through several rounds of plaque purification to eliminate parental virus. However, the GFP gene is inherently unstable as recombination will readily occur between the two repeat sequences that surround the gene. Subsequent selection of non-GFPexpressing plaques allows isolation of recombinants that express only the foreign gene. Several rounds of plaque purification are necessary to ensure a pure clonal isolate. It is essential that these plaque isolates be characterized by immunostaining, PCR, or other methods to ensure that the desired gene has been incorporated.",

Because MPA blocks the pathway for GMP synthesis, it interferes with the replication of vaccinia and severely reduces the size of vaccinia plaques. This effect can be overcome, however, by expression of the E. coli gpt gene in the presence of xanthine and hypoxanthine (i.e., XGPRT can use either of these as substrate for synthesis of GMP). Thus, coexpression of XGPRT provides a useful selection system. Usually the XGPRT gene is placed adjacent to the gene of interest and within the vaccinia virus DNA flanking sequences. Unlike the TK \u2212 situation, the viral products arising from both single and double cross-over events will be selected. Therefore, it is important to do successive plaque isolations so that the single cross-over events will be resolved. A reverse-selection procedure can be used to delete the XGPRT gene from a recombinant vaccinia virus or replace it with another gene (Isaacs et al., 1990) . Another procedure, transient XGPRT selection, is performed using a transfer vector with the XGPRT gene outside of the vaccinia virus DNA flanking sequences (Falkner and Moss, 1990) . Under these conditions, only the single crossover recombinant virus will express XGPRT, providing substantial enrichment over the parental virus. However, when MPA selection is removed, the desired double cross-over recombinant virus without the XGPRT gene will have to be differentiated from the parental virus by PCR, immunostaining, or other methods.",

Deletion II encompasses parts of the HindIII N-K fragments; deletion III lies within the HindIII A fragment (Meyer et al., 1991) . The TK gene has been successfully used as an insertion site for MVA (Carroll and Moss, 1997; T. Blanchard, pers. comm.) , although there have been reports of some difficulties in isolating stable TK \u2212 MVA (Scheiflinger et al., 1996) . Since there are no MVA-permissive TK \u2212 cell lines, the main attraction for using the TK site is the large number of available transfer vectors that target this site. When some foreign genes were placed under the control of the very strong synthetic early/late promoter, the resulting recombinant MVA were difficult to isolate or unstable (Wyatt et al., 1996) . To date, the examples have been membrane proteins. In most cases, stable recombinants could be made by using a promoter of lower strength, e.g., pm H5 or p 7.5 . When a recombinant protein is somewhat toxic, non-expressing mutants that arise spontaneously can quickly overgrow the culture. To partially circumvent this problem, which has occurred with recombinant genes inserted in deletions II and III, a transfer vector, pLW-73, that directs recombination between two essential genes, I8R and G1L, was developed (Table 14A .4.1). Thus, instability resulting from any deletion of the inserted gene that includes part of either of the two essential flanking genes will result in a non-viable virus that cannot overgrow the culture.",

As discussed there, obtaining a very fine precipitate of calcium phosphate and DNA is critical for efficient transfection. Several factors can influence the quality of the precipitate. First, the pH of the transfection buffer should be between 7.0 and 7.1. Second, the CaCl 2 should be added slowly and mixed gently (not vortexed), only until full mixing is achieved. The tube should then be left undisturbed until the solution is layered on the cells. Cationic lipids are simpler to use and provide similar or better transfection efficiencies. Although the Lipofectamine procedure was described in this unit, other liposomal or cationic lipids are also effective.",

It is also advisable to perform DNA sequencing of the insert to ensure that no mutations have arisen, especially if a PCR product was used for transfection of the foreign gene. Immunostaining is another method that can be used to verify that all plaques/foci express the gene of interest. Non-expressing plaques/foci can be identified by microscopic visualization or double immunostaining. The latter technique requires an antibody to the expressed protein and one to vaccinia with different species specificities. This method has been used routinely with MVA recombinants.",

For each method, recombinant virus (obtained in the transfection; see Basic Protocol 1) is used to infect a monolayer culture of cells. For vaccinia virus, BS-C-1 cells are used because large plaques are obtained; for TK selection, it is necessary to use a cell line such as HuTK \u2212 143B that is deficient in thymidine kinase. For MVA, CEF or BHK-21 cells are necessary. Medium containing 2.5% methylcellulose and the appropriate selective drugs, if applicable, is then pipetted onto the infected cell monolayer. Because of cell-to-cell spread of virus, each productively infected cell gives rise to an infected area on the monolayer. With vaccinia infection the cells are rounded and dead, and thus appear as colorless plaques. is used to remove infected cells from the plaques/foci. The virus is placed in medium and is released by freeze-thaw cycling and sonication.
