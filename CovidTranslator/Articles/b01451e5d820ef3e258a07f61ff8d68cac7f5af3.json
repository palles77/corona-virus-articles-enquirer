For direct visualization of HBV, we determined whether envelope assembly could accommodate the green fluorescent protein (GFP). While the Cterminal addition of GFP to S trans-dominant negatively inhibited empty envelope particle secretion, the N-terminal GFP fusion to S (GFP.S) was co-integrated into the envelope, giving rise to fluorescent particles. Microscopy and topogenesis analyses demonstrated that the proper intracellular distribution and folding of GFP.S, required for particle export were rescued by interprotein interactions with wild-type S. Thereby, a dual location of GFP, inside and outside the envelope, was observed. GFP.S was also efficiently packaged into the viral envelope, and these GFP-tagged virions retained the capacity for attachment to HBV receptor-positive cells in vitro. Together, GFP-tagged virions should be suitable to monitor HBV uptake and egress in live hepatocytes. D 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",

Despite considerable understanding of the details of hepadnaviral genome replication, fundamental insights into the early and late steps of an HBV infection are still lacking. Infection initiates by virus attachment to the hepatocyte and is determined by the HBV envelope. Among the three related large L, middle M, and small S envelope proteins, L has been shown to play the key role in receptor recognition and cell attachment (Le Seyec et al., 1999; Neurath et al., 1986) . The route of subsequent HBV uptake is a yet poorly identified process and may proceed by direct fusion of the viral envelope with the plasma membrane, receptor-mediated endocytosis, or alternate mechanisms (for review, see Cooper et al., 2003) . In favor of a fusion mechanism at the cell surface is the previous demonstration of a pH-independent internalization of HBV in primary human hepatocytes (Hagelstein et al., 1997) . By contrast, infectivity studies performed with the related duck HBV in duck liver cells have demonstrated that viral entry depends on endocytosis (Breiner et al., 1998) .",

Assembly and secretion of subviral particles are solely driven by the S protein and are initiated by co-translational integration of S molecules into the ER membrane (Simon et al., 1988) . The current models for the transmembrane structure of S assume a lumenal disposition (i.e., external in the mature particles) of both the N-and C-termini and four membranespanning segments (Berting et al., 1995; Stirk et al., 1992) . Following dimerization, about 100 transmembrane S monomers then self-assemble with host-derived lipids into spherical empty envelopes, 20 nm in diameter, which are secreted from the infected liver and transfected cell lines with high efficiency. This process is also sustained by the M protein that shares the sequence of S but differs in its Nterminal preS2 extension. By contrast, the L protein along with its N-terminal preS1 plus preS2 domains blocks subviral particle production but is the key player in virion formation (Bruss and Ganem, 1991; Chisari et al., 1986) . The pivotal role of the L protein in the viral life cycle is related to its dual transmembrane topology (Bruss et al., 1994; Ostapchuk et al., 1994; , as its internal (cytosolic) preS domain is needed for envelopment of cytosolic nucleocapsids , while the same external (lumenal) preS domain mediates receptor binding during host cell attachment (Le Seyec et al., 1999) .",

Two chimeras were constructed by fusing either a fluorescenceenhanced GFP in frame to the N-terminus of S (GFP.S) or the yellow-shifted YFP variant to the C-terminus of S (S.YFP) (Fig. 1A) . The fusion constructs were transiently expressed in COS-7 cells and analyzed by GFP-specific Western blotting. The unfused S protein with a C-terminal HA-tag (SHA) was included as reference. As shown in Fig.  1B , lysates of cells contained SHA in its characteristic doublet of a non-glycosylated (p24) and single-glycosylated (gp27) form as a consequence of partial modification at Asn-146. N-linked glycosylation was confirmed by treatment with peptide/N-glycosidase F (PNGase F), which converted the gp27 form of S to its faster migrating p24 form. The GFP.S and S.YFP fusion proteins were stably expressed as 51-kDa polypeptides in accordance with the molecular masses calculated for their non-glycosylated forms (p51) (Fig. 1B) . As evidenced by enzymatic deglycosylation, both fusion proteins appeared in glycosylated forms (gp54) in addition, indicating that they were Fig. 1 .

Nonetheless, for further studies outlined below, it was important to know its precise topology, that is, the orientation of the GFP domain relative to the membrane. According to current models for the transmembrane structure of S, its N-terminus and hence the GFP fusion site are located to the lumenal side of intracellular membranes that is topologically equivalent to the virion surface ( Fig. 4A ) (Berting et al., 1995; Stirk et al., 1992) . To analyze the topological features of GFP.S, expressed in the absence or presence of S molecules, we used proteinase K protection experiments of microsomes prepared from transfected COS-7 cells. Both GFP.S and S proteins were synthesized in HA-tagged form to enable their simultaneous detection by immunoblotting. Consistent with previous works , proteinase K did not cleave the p24/gp27 forms of SHA unless the protecting microsomal membrane was disrupted by detergent ( Fig. 4B , lanes 4-6). By contrast, GFP.SHA synthesized in the absence of SHA chains was accessible to cleavage with the protease in intact microsomes (Fig. 4B , lanes 1-3). Thereby, two HA-reactive fragments were generated that closely resembled the full-length p24 and gp27 forms of SHA. Therefore, cleavage of GFP.SHA must have occurred at least at a very distal site within the Nterminal fused GFP domain. In support of a fully cytoplasmic location of the GFP domain, we were unable to detect GFP-reactive proteolysis products by Western blotting (data not shown). When expressed together with SHA, the topology of GFP.SHA surprisingly changed in such that a fraction of polypeptides was now protected from cleavage with proteinase K by the microsomal membrane (Fig. 4B, lanes 4-6) . These results indicated that the presence of extra SHA chains caused a partial topological change of the N-terminal GFP domain from cytosolic to lumenal, likely as a consequence of GFP.SHA/SHA interprotein subunit interaction. Given the strict correlation between partial N-tail translocation and secretion competence and vice versa, we finally investigated the topological properties of GFP.SHA complemented in trans with a secretion-defective S mutant protein. To this aim, we took advantage of SDTM1HA that lacks the first transmembrane domain and is blocked in the assembly and secretion of subviral particles (Prange et al., 1992) . Consistent with our previous results (Prange et al., 1992) , the deletion mutant predominantly appeared in a glycosylated 24-kDa form (gp24; Fig. 4B, lane 7) . Importantly, SDTM1HA failed to impart a partial lumenal orientation of GFP.SHA (Fig. 4B , lanes 7-9). Together, these data indicated that the topological change of GFP.SHA in the presence of extra S molecules was likely established during the formation and extracellular release of the GFP.SHA/SHA mosaic particles.",

For virus production, human hepatoma HuH-7 cells were transiently transfected with a cloned over-length copy of the HBV genome. On cotransfection with the GFP.S expression plasmid at a 1:1 ratio, virus secretion into the cellular supernatant was reduced about 3-fold (data not shown), whereas no inhibitory effect of GFP.S on the virus secretion profile was observed if a 4-fold excess of the HBV encoding vector was used for co-transfection. Because transfected HuH-7 cells released viral and subviral particles into the culture medium, virions were separated from empty envelope particles by isopycnic CsCl gradient centrifugation. A resolution of these particle types was verified by assaying of fractions for the presence of HBV DNA by the endogenous polymerase reaction. As shown in Fig. 5 (A  and B) , DNA-containing virions banded at a density near 1.24 g/ml around fractions 18-22, with the strongest signal in fraction 20, while empty envelopes were found at their typical density of 1.22 g/ml. Importantly, when probed with a GFP-specific ELISA, the virus-containing fractions were clearly reactive, thus giving first hints to an incorporation of the GFP-tagged S protein during virus assembly. As a final proof, supernatants of HBV + GFP.S co-transfected HuH-7 cells were immunoprecipitated with a GFP-specific antibody prior to detection of the viral genome by dot-blot analysis. For reasons mentioned above, such a precipitation, however, required the presence of detergent (0.5% NP-40) that decreased the limits of detection, likely because some nucleocapsids might leak from the disordered envelope network. Nonetheless, despite these restraints, we could specifically detect the viral DNA in a-GFP-precipitated supernatants (Fig. 5C) .",

Although most permanent cell lines are not permissive to HBV infection, the human hepatoblastoma HepG2 cell line is able to bind the virion (Lu et al., 1996) . For binding, we applied the same assay conditions as validated previously for in vitro infection of primary human hepatocytes (Gripon et al., 1993) . Accordingly, recombinant HBV + S.GFP particles secreted from co-transfected HuH-7 cells (see above) were precipitated with polyethylene glycol (PEG) and reacted with HepG2 cells grown on glass bottom Fig. 4 . GFP.S forms a mixed topology when co-expressed with wild-type S. (A) Model of the transmembrane topology of S at the ER membrane and the virion envelope.

The N-glycosylation site at Asn-146 is indicated by w. (B.) Proteinase K protection assay of GFP.S. COS-7 cells were transfected with HA-tagged GFP.S either alone (lanes 1-3) or together with HA-tagged S (lanes 4-6) or the secretion-defective SDTM1 mutant (lanes 7-9). Two days after transfection, microsomes were prepared and either left untreated or digested with Proteinase K (Prot. K) in the absence (\u00c0) or presence (+) of NP-40, as denoted above each lane. Samples were analyzed by HA-specific immunoblotting. The GFP.S-and S-specific p and gp forms are indicated on the left; the corresponding forms of SDTM1HA are denoted on the right. dishes. After incubating cell cultures overnight, followed by several washes, a strong GFP fluorescence almost evenly distributed on the plasma membrane of the hepatocytes was observed (Figs. 6a and b) . To test the specificity of adsorption, we analyzed the binding properties of GFP.S + S subviral particles that lacked the L envelope protein and thus the receptor binding site. As expected, these particles failed to attach to HepG2 cells thereby yielding only some diffuse background staining (Figs. 6c and d) . However, because infected liver cells and HBV-producing cell lines are known to also produce subviral particles containing the L protein (Nassal, 1996) , we could not totally exclude the possibility that the GFP fluorescence, shown in Figs. 6a and b, might be also generated by binding of this particle type.",

In addition, the control material was probed with a-HBsAg, as shown in the right panel. Fig. 6 . GFP-tagged HBV binds to HepG2 cells. In squares a and b are shown the adsorption of GFP-tagged HBV particles (HBV + GFP.S) to live HepG2 cells, grown on glass bottom dishes, as detected by GFP autofluorescence (magnification, \u00c21600). Under the same assay conditions, GFP-tagged subviral particles (S + GFP.S) did not bind to cells (squares c and d).",

            "text": "Particle formation of the GFP.S chimeric protein, however, depended on the presence of the wild-type S protein, indicating that the fusion construct itself failed to fold into a functional conformation required for assembly. Nonetheless, as judged by the autofluorescence of GFP.S in cells, at least the GFP-tag must have folded properly. Thereby, GFP.S surprisingly appeared in sequestered speckles that overlapped with the ER compartment. The formation of similar structures, termed concentric membranous ER bodies, has been recently observed upon expression of a misfolded mutant of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator that accumulates in these bodies prior to ERassociated degradation (Okiyoneda et al., 2004) . Accordingly, the S moiety of GFP.S might not attain its native transmembrane structure thereby tending to aggregate into discrete speckles. On co-expression with wild-type S, the intracellular distribution of GFP.S completely changed in such that it now yielded a typical membranous ER staining pattern and a high degree of co-localization with S. This result indicates that the proper folding and localization of GFP.S were warranted by interprotein interactions with wildtype S chains. As a consequence thereof, highly fluorescent mosaic particles were formed and secreted, which closely resembled authentic spherical S lipoprotein particles according to density and size.",

            "text": "Furthermore, the GFP.S fusion protein could be also natively incorporated into the virion envelope. GFP, by virtue of its properties, has been successfully used to tag various viruses like, for example, herpes simplex virus type I, vesicular stomatitis virus, vaccinia virus, HIV, and mouse hepatitis coronavirus (Bosch et al., 2004; Dalton and Rose, 2001; Desai and Person, 1998; Stauber et al., 1999; Ward and Moss, 2001) . However, unlike these viruses, HBV is a very small particle with a diameter of 42 nm and a dense packed structure. Even so, it can apparently accommodate multiple copies of GFP, indicating that there is substantial space available between the viral envelope and the nucleocapsid as well as sufficient flexibility allowing the incorporation of proteins in trans. Although we were unable to unequivocally define the location of the GFP-tag within the secreted HBV envelope, our topological analysis of GFP.S suggested an interior (i.e., cytosolic side of microsomes) and exterior (i.e., lumenal side of microsomes) display of GFP. The formation of such a mixed topology is rare among membrane proteins but is a prominent feature of the large L envelope protein of HBV (Bruss et al., 1994; Ostapchuk et al., 1994; . In that case, it is established post-translationally at the ER membrane and is uncoupled from envelope assembly (Lambert and Prange, 2001) . By contrast, the two differently orientated isoforms of GFP.S were only generated upon coexpression with secretion-competent wild-type S molecules, thus hinting to a link between envelope subunit interactions and topogenesis of GFP.S. While the underlying mechanism remains to be determined, it is tempting to speculate that the dual location of the GFP domain might be beneficial for the functionality of GFP-tagged HBV. By splitting the tag to both sides of the virion envelope, the local density of GFP might be lowered thereby limiting the risk of sterical hindrance of the envelope/nucleocapsid interactions at the interior and the envelope/receptor binding at the exterior.",

However, whether these particles even retained their infectivity remains to be addressed. In vitro HBV infection studies had been restricted to primary human hepatocytes that are not readily available. More recently, however, successful experimental infections of tree shrews were carried out that might present a new animal model (K\u00f6ck et al., 2001) . In addition, a human hepatoma cell line has been established that supports HBV infection (Gripon et al., 2002) . Therefore, the GFP-tagged HBV envelope might be useful for the investigation of the early events of virus penetration such as monitoring entry and uncoating in living infected cells and tracing the fate of the envelope structure. With GFP as a marker, it should also be possible to approach sites of viral assembly and to follow the intracellular trafficking and egress of (sub)viral particles during the late stages of an HBV infection.",

The newly created EcoRI site, cutting between codon positions 4 and 5 (nts 170) of the S gene, together with the cognate filled-in AccI site (nts 827) was then used to generate an S encoding fragment for in-frame insertion into pEGFP-C1, giving rise to plasmid pEGFP.S. In parallel, the HA-tagged version of the S gene was similarly cloned, giving rise to GFP.SHA. A reciprocal chimera, containing the yellow-shifted YFP colinearly fused to the C-terminus of S (S.YFP), was created using plasmid pEYFP-N1 (BD Biosciences Clontech), which was opened with XhoI and BamHI.

HBV and subviral particles secreted from HuH-7 (co)-transfected cells were precipitated from 10-ml culture supernatant in the presence of 6% polyethylene glycol 8000 (PEG; Sigma). The pellet was resuspended in 200-Al phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 25% FCS. HepG2 cells were incubated with 50 Al of this concentrate, diluted in 1 ml culture medium with 4% PEG, for 20 h at 37 8C. Cells were washed three times with PBS and analyzed for GFP fluorescence by microscopy.",
