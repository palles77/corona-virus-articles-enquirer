            "text": "Pathogen spillover and cross-species transmission between animals and humans is a major 52 source of infectious diseases and a considerable global public health burden [1, 2] . 53 Understanding the factors that enable or facilitate these processes is a crucial step for such 54 events to be predicted. Host shifting, that is the colonization of a new host species by a 55 pathogen, requires a certain level of overlap in species traits ('ecological fitting') in order to 56 overcome barriers of cross-species transmission and for survival and reproduction within 57 novel host species [3] [4] [5] . In the search for mechanisms and enabling conditions that may help 58 to predict the future emergence of infectious diseases from animal populations, the necessity 59 of considering entire host species communities amongst underpinning biogeographic 60 structure and connectivity have been recently emphasized [6] [7] [8] [9] . 61 Network analyses that describe the connections of different host species in terms of 62 parasite sharing have proven useful in analysing host specificity and parasite spread [10, 11] , 63 particularly since they offer the opportunity to explore community-wide pathogen spread (the 64 distribution of a pathogen among host species, a pattern emerging from past and 65 contemporary host shifting events that connect host species as nodes in a network). Such 66 approaches may lead to increased predictability of future pandemics; for example, some 67 recent \"big data\" studies of mammal-virus associations have explored whether host traits and 68 geographic distribution can predict those species to most likely harbour undiscovered viruses 69 that may cause future pandemics [11] [12] [13] .

The challenge of assessing different 76 animal species in their role for virus spread is understandable, as detailed information about 77 virus sharing across entire communities became only recently available [12, 15] amid the 78 challenge that many virus species remain unknown [16] . 79 We address this knowledge gap by exploring the role of different mammalian species 80 in the spread of viruses through entire host communities. In particular, we tested whether proposed to likely increases their host range through more frequent host shifting and 92 adaptation to distantly related host species, whereas DNA viruses and retroviruses are 93 assumed to be more host-specific due to codivergence with their hosts over much longer to showcase possible differences in pathogen sharing, while we are aware that there are some 142 additional species that may be considered to be domestic animals. 143 We generated four different measures of sampling effort for each mammalian host species, The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/421511 doi: bioRxiv preprint distribution of records among different virus species, i.e. higher overall sampling coverage 151 [24]. We generated these multiple indices as proxies of sampling intensity, as the true 152 sampling effort is not known. This is because records of species interactions in the literature 153 are arguable 'presence-only' records and rarely report the lack of interactions that would 154 reduce the number of pseudo-absences in biotic interaction data [25, 26] . The primary focus of this paper was to explore which mammalian host species might be the 193 most important for spreading viruses due to their sharing of viruses with others, and we were 194 interested in the phylogenetic and functional diversity of host species infected by different 195 virus species. We addressed these aims using three different statistical approaches, which we 196 describe in detail in the SI Appendix. In brief, we used the following statistical approaches: We used the non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test to assess whether the eigenvector centrality 208 measures differed between wildlife and domestic species and among host orders. We applied 209 Dunn's test for multiple comparisons [36] . To account for sampling bias that could bias 210 centrality measures [37] , we randomly removed subsets of interaction records from the The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/421511 doi: bioRxiv preprint",

We gathered ecological trait data from the PanTHERIA [27] and 163 EltonTraits 1.0 [28] databases to characterise all of the sampled mammals using a range of 164 traits likely to impact on their suitability as hosts for parasites. 165 Selected traits were: body mass, which is a key feature of mammals in terms of their 166 metabolism and adaptation to environments; average longevity, litter size and the average 167 number of litters per year as demographic parameters that could be relevant for within-host 168 dynamics of viruses; diet breadth (calculated as a Shannon diversity index based on the 169 proportional use of 10 diet categories as presented in EltonTraits); range area, which we 170 expect to affect the exposure to other mammalian host species; average temperature and 171 average precipitation within a host's distribution as an indicator of climatic niche; latitudinal 172 centroid of distribution as an indicator of the general habitat and climate within which hosts 173 are occurring across a gradient from tropical to polar biotas; and habitat as multiple binary 174 indicators of whether a species uses 1) forest, 2) open vegetation, and/or 3) .iucnredlist.org).

We used this tree to compute pairwise phylogenetic 181 distances based on a correlation matrix of phylogenetic branch lengths [30] and also a vector 182 of phylogenetic distance to humans for all other mammalian host species. We also quantified 183 pairwise ecological distance between sampled mammal species based on a generalised form 184 of Gower's distance matrices [31] using weighted variables based on all of the ecological trait 185 variables described above, following methods in [32]. Phylogenetic and ecological distance 186 matrices as well as vectors of trait variables were scaled (dividing by the maximum for each 187 distance matrix), so all distance measures ranged from 0 to one.

For all host orders and both virus genome types, 311 we found virus sharing to be more likely with closely related species (negative values for 312 coefficients \u03b2phyl that depict increasing virus sharing for smaller phylogenetic distances 313 among pairs of host species). Phylogenetic clustering of host species (which translates into 314 higher host specificity for the viruses) was stronger for DNA viruses shared by Primates, 315 Lagomorpha, Artiodactyla and Chiroptera compared to RNA viruses (figure 3), signifying a 316 general tendency of higher host specificity in terms of phylogenetic similarity for DNA 317 viruses compared to RNA viruses.

In contrast, there was no evidence 342 that the proportion of zoonotic DNA viruses in different host species was linked to any 343 species traits (all odds ratio estimates intersecting with 1). The proportion of zoonotic RNA 344 viruses was smaller for host species, with the largest number of sequences recorded and 345 higher Shannon diversity scores of sequence records (both odds ratios between 0.7 -0.96), 346 suggesting that more intensive sequencing efforts of a large range of these viruses increases 347 the discovery of viruses confined to non-human hosts. The proportion of DNA virus species between host species from different mammalian orders and viruses from 351 different families is illustrated in electronic supplementary material, figure S4, data are 352 presented in electronic supplementary material, table S2. and the emergence of infectious diseases ultimately depend on how 356 pathogens conquer eco-evolutionary barriers to infect novel hosts [39], but spatiotemporal 357 variation in species interaction and pathogen transmission opportunities are proximately 358 driven by host occurrences and community assembly [40, 41]. It comes therefore as little 359 surprise that globally pervasive mammal groups, such as bats and rodents, are often 360 considered to share as many viruses with humans as do primates, our closest relatives [12, 42, 361 43]. Our study adds novel insights into viruses spread across mammalian communities. 362 Specifically, we provide the strongest evidence to date that domestic animals are the most 363 central species in mammalian host-virus interaction networks. We also found rather 364 distinctive patterns of how DNA and RNA viruses are shared and spread among different 365 mammalian groups, with bats and carnivores being only of minor role in spreading DNA 366 viruses through the network. We emphasize the dominant role of domestic species in virus 367 sharing, since domestication status strongly increases the chance of virus sharing among 368 multiple mammalian hosts.

However, the exceptionally high virus sharing of humans and domestic animals with 382 other mammalian species suggest that these species play a crucial role in spreading viruses,383 as frequent virus acquisition and dissemination is the most plausible explanation for such 384 intensive virus sharing. This may reflect the wide geographic distribution and contact 385 opportunities to wildlife across biogeographic borders, given that domestic species are not 386 particularly distinguished from wildlife in terms of ecological traits. In fact, contact 387 opportunity and community assembly have been shown in a number of studies to impact 388 pathogen sharing and host shifting [8, 45]. Many pathogens, including viruses, can overcome 389 species and environmental barriers to infect distantly related hosts and disperse across large 390 geographic areas [46, 47], although strong constraints in host shifting may also cause 391 biogeographic structure in pathogen diversity and zoonotic disease risk [6, 48]. Beside the 392 large geographic ranges and diverse habitats encroached by domestic species, their large 393 populations sizes and high densities, that often excels those of wildlife populations [18], 394 could further contribute to host shifting and pathogen spread.

Here, we reveal for the first time that these two major groups of viruses 402 are differently spread across entire networks of mammalian hosts, an important finding that 403 remains largely unnoticed when solely looking at the species richness and propensity of 404 zoonotic viruses carried in different wildlife species. Remarkably, Chiroptera and Carnivora 405 hold central positions in terms of virus sharing with other species only for RNA viruses, 406 while Primates occupy relatively more central positions in terms of DNA virus sharing 407 among hosts. In practice, these findings translate into a minor role of bats and carnivores for 408 the spread of DNA viruses (and relatively low risk that DNA viruses will spillover from these 409 species to humans), whereas at least a few primate species, namely Macaca mulatta, Pan 410 troglodytes, Chlorocebus aethiops and M. fascicularis, have relatively more central roles in 411 sharing DNA than RNA viruses. We also found that cattle (Bos taurus), goat (Capra hircus), 412 pig (Sus scrofa), horse (Equus caballus) and sheep (Ovis aries), which are globally the most 413 abundant and economically important livestock species [50], are among those species with 414 the relatively highest centrality measures in terms of DNA virus sharing. Importantly though, 415 it should be noted that for all these species, the frequencies of sharing DNA viruses with 416 other host species was considerably lower than sharing RNA viruses regardless of centrality 417 measures (as is also true for group-level estimates for different mammalian orders as depicted 418 in figure 3). We thus emphasize that aforementioned species have a relative crucial role in 419 spreading DNA viruses, whereas RNA viruses generally are much more frequently shared 420 among mammalian host species. In this context, our model framework for analysing patterns 421 in host sharing provides probabilistic estimates of the variation in the pairwise phylogenetic 422 and functional similarities of infected versus potential host species as a signal of host of virological factors that ensure efficient virus replication and 427 transmission within and among host species is in its infancy [51]. Consequently, 428 disentangling host or virus traits as drivers of the differential spread of DNA and RNA 429 viruses among different mammalian orders is currently not possible and requires fundamental 430 research. Possible working hypotheses as to why primates and ungulates are of relatively high 431 central importance in sharing DNA viruses could be linked to mechanisms that enable 432 efficient within-host virus replication and population-level transmission. At the same time, 433 exploring virus attributes of the major DNA virus families shared among these host species, 434 namely Herpesviridae, Papillomavirridae and Adenovirridae (electronic supplementary 435 material, figure S4), may help to explain why these viruses are more likely to be shared by 436 primates and ungulates but are less likely to cross host species barrier with regards to bats and 437 carnivores. Moreover, the strong links of some RNA viruses such as the Bunyavirales to 438 arthropod vectors [52], requires further research into the role of host-vector associations and 439 other transmission modes for the spread of viruses. 440 We recognize several shortfalls in analysing database records of host-pathogen 441 associations. First, any record of a virus species in a host entirely relies on targeted molecular 442 screening. Certain research foci such as the boost in coronavirus research linked to bats after 443 the SARS pandemics [14] may include a sampling bias difficult to capture when only 444 accounting for publication or sequencing numbers as proxies for sampling bias, since the true 445 presence/absence of viruses in non-target host species remains unknown. Undoubtedly, major 446 research efforts are linked to viruses of public health relevance, while there is a dearth of 447 systematic pathogen surveillances in wildlife [53].

            "text": "With sparse data, any direct interpretation of absolute numbers of species richness and 451 interactions could rather reflect the observation process than true biological patterns and 452 processes [26], and we are therefore currently not able to explore such important properties in 453 our study. Network topologies can be also biased by sampling and data aggregation[54]. We 454 control for research effort in our analysis by accounting for variation in relation to455    publications and sequencing numbers, as has been done previously[10, 12]. However, as 456 more complete data from systematic disease surveillance efforts becomes available, it will be 457 desirable to improve such analysis to better distinguish true but undiscovered interactions458 from 'false zeros' among other sources of bias. Finally, we are aware that amalgamating 459 species-specific host-pathogen interactions into N\u00d7N adjacency matrix as used for some 460 network statistics comes at the cost of losing information about pathogen species identity and 461 thus overall connectivity of host species can no longer be traced back to particular pathogen 462 species. Overall, network connectivity and modularity are therefore community-level entities, 463 while a focus on particular virus species would require more detailed analysis of underlying 464 species-level interaction matrices. 465 Our work reveals the importance of domestication status and phylogenetic clustering 466 on the importance of virus sharing among mammals, showcasing also the limited sharing of 467 DNA viruses by bats and carnivores in contrast to primates and ungulates species that readily 468 share both RNA and DNA viruses. The emergence of novel infectious diseases through 469 pathogen spillover is a hierarchical process. Ecological factors that determine the contact 470 opportunity between different host species pave the way for cross-species transmission, host 471 adaptation and subsequent within-host reproduction and transmission, which are then largely 472 controlled by ecophysiological and genetic factors.

Yet, to date little comprehensive work has been conducted of whether host sharing and spread at the network level differ among these viruses and whether they interact with the various groups of mammals in different ways. We used network centrality analysis and Bayesian hierarchical models to quantify the extent of virussharing among different mammalian host species and the proportion of zoonotic viruses carried in different hosts. Within the hierarchical model of virus sharing, probabilistic estimates of the variation in the pairwise phylogenetic and functional similarities of infected 101 and potential host species provides a signal of host specificity. We extracted mammal-virus species-level interactions from the Enhanced Infectious Diseases Database (EID2) [15] in the version from May 2018. In brief, EID2 utilises automated 107 procedure to extract information on pathogens, their hosts and locations from two sources: 1) the meta-data accompanying nucleotide sequences published in the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Nucleotide database (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore); and 2) titles and abstracts of publications indexed in the PubMed database 111 (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed). To date, EID2 has extracted information from 7,1076,379 sequences (and processed 100M+ sequences), and 8,643,203 titles and abstracts. EID2 113 imports names of organisms (1,407,577 of which 157,894 are viruses and 10,071 are mammals) and their taxonomic hierarchy from the NCBI Taxonomy database 115 (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Taxonomy/), and supplements it with an exhaustive collection 116 of alternative names. EID2 also contains information on 2,171 organisms of interest that were 117 not found in the NCBI Taxonomy database (none of which were mammals or viruses). In general, EID2 follows the NCBI definitions of 'species', 'subspecies' and 'no rank', with most unclassified and uncultured species are denoted 'no rank'. After applying the 120 classification rules listed in [15], EID2 contains 15,959 species of viruses and 6.735 species 121 of mammals.The data of interest for this study were associations of mammalian (including human) species with different virus species, independent of location records. We considered a mammalian species to be host to a virus if at least four independent publications or one sequence meta-data reported an association between the host (or any of its subspecies) and the virus (or any of its subspecies or strains). Virus species were assigned to genome type 127 (DNA, RNA or other/unspecified) following NCBI taxonomy as utilised by EID2.Mammal species synonyms and taxonomic orders were standardized using thetaxonomy of [23], the online version of IUCN Red List and Integrated Taxonomic Information System, ITIS (accessed May 2018). This revision enabled us to match the most 131 recent host names to trait data. Of the 816 non-human mammalian host species in our data set, we considered 20 species as 133 'domestic' (including the major commensal rodent species) and all other as 'wildlife'. Domestic species were banteng (Bos javanicus), yak (B. mutus), cow (B. taurus), bactrian 135 camel (Camelus bactrianus and C. ferus), dromedary (C. dromedarius), dog (Canis familiaris 136 and Canis lupus), goat (Capra aegagrus), guinea pig (Cavia porcellus), wild ass (Equus africanus), donkey (E. asinus), horse (E. caballus), cat (Felis catus), guanaco (Lama guanicoe), house mouse (Mus musculus), rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus), sheep (Ovis aries), brown rat (Rattus norvegicus), black rat (R. rattus), pig (Sus scrofa) and vicugna (Vicugna vicugna). We constrained our domestic species selection to these major domestic species only",
