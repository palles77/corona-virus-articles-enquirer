Interactions of three of the best ligands were evaluated in the hydrated state using molecular dynamics simulation at two different temperatures. The docking result showed that AD3BF2D ligand (N-[(1S,6R)-5-amino-5-{[(2R,3S,4S)-3,4-dihydroxy-4-(hydroxymethyl) tetrahydrofuran-2yl]oxy}-4-formylcyclohex-3-en-1-yl]acetamide-3-(1-ethylpropoxy)-1-cyclohexene-1-carboxylate) had better binding energy values than standard oseltamivir. AD3BF2D had several interactions, including hydrogen bonds, with the residues in the catalytic site of neuraminidase as identified by molecular dynamics simulation. The results showed that AD3BF2D ligand can be used as a good candidate for neuraminidase inhibitor to cope with influenza A virus subtype H1N1.",

            "text": "Neuraminidase has become the main target for drug design against influenza virus due to its highly conserved catalytic site and its essential role in influenza virus replication [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] . Oseltamivir is an antiviral drug against neuraminidase that is useful for preventing viral replication in the last stage of the viral live cycle [6] . It directly interacts with the catalytic residues of the neuraminidase catalytic site, while the framework residues stabilize the enzyme structure [7] . Resistance to oseltamivir has already become a widespread phenomenon, and prediction of the neuraminidase structure shows that the resistance could be several times higher than resistance to zanamivir, a neuraminidase inhibitor [8, 9] . Mutations at the conserved residues of neuraminidase appear to associate with oseltamivir resistance in a subtype specific manner [6] . Arg292Lys, Asn294Ser, and His274Tyr are three known types of mutations that manifest oseltamivir resistance in H1N1 influenza virus [1, [9] [10] [11] . The frequency of His274Tyr mutant viruses is 64%, although it varies among different countries [9, 12] . A high prevalence of the mutant virus is seen in South Africa, New Caledonia, New Zealand, the Philippines, and Australia [13] , modest in Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand, but insignificant in Macau and Taiwan [12] . The search for effective drugs that can cope with H1N1 is still ongoing. Li et al. searched zinc fragment database and found the lead compound of Neo6 as a feasible drug candidate [14] . Drug resistance tendecy of oseltamivir towards H5N1 provided valuable data for H1N1 drug design [1, 11] . Six analog inhibitors as drug candidates against H5N1 were suggested by Du et al. [15] . A more robust binding energy than that of zanamivir and oseltamivir was found in compound AG7088 and its derivatives [16, 17] . Oseltamivir has good bioavaibility and is effective for treatment and prevention of epidemic influenza infection in adults, adolescents and children (> one year of age) [18] . Modifcation of oseltamivir to cope with influenza A virus subtype H1N1 has been attempted [1, 11] , which is based on the properties of amino acid residues in the catalytic site of neuraminidase [19] . Drug-target interactions are being investigated using structural bioinformatics tools [20, 21] . In this study, we focused on the modification of the oseltamivir functional groups and molecular docking was performed to determine the best candidate ligand based on the lowest binding energy and interaction. Molecular dynamics simulation is a useful theoretical tool for analyzing the proteinligand interactions with atomic resolutions based on classical mechanics [22] [23] [24] [25] . We also carried out molecular dynamics simulation to evaluate the interaction of candidate ligands and the enzyme in the hydrated state at two different temperatures.",

The multiple sequence alignment method was based on the CLUSTAL W2 program (www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/ clustalw2/index.html) [11, 26] . The alignment result was forwarded into homology pipeline for further processing of 3D structure determination. The homology modeling was performed using the Swiss model, which can be accessed through http://www.swissmodel.expasy. org/SWISS-MODEL.html. 3CKZ chain A [Protein Data Bank (PDB) code] with mutation His274Tyr as template was applied to build the latest structure of N1. Validation of the 3D structure from the homology modeling was performed by protein geometry program and superimposed by superpose program in MOE 2009.10 software [9] . Based on the superimposition, the rootmean-square deviation (RMSD) was calculated to identify structural similarity between template model mutated with 3D structure from homology modeling.",

Modified oseltamivir was built into 3D structure using ACD Labs software. 3D shape was obtained by saving it in the 3D viewer of ACD Labs. Furthermore, the output format was converted into Molfile MDL Mol format using software Vegazz to conform the docking process [30] . Ligand was washed with a computer program; adjustments were made with the ligand partial charge and partial charge optimization using MMFF94x forcefield [9, 31] . The conformation structure energy of ligands was minimized using the root-mean-square (RMS) gradient energy with 0.001 kcal/mol [9] . Other parameters were in accordance with existing default in the MOE 2009.10 software [32] . Molecular docking MOE 2009.10 was applied for optimization and minimization of the 3D structure of the enzyme with the addition of hydrogen atoms [9] . Protonation was employed with Protonate 3D programs to introduce changes in ionization step. The 'wash' process was started by optimization pipeline, on MOE database viewer. Furthermore, partial charges and force field modification were applied with MMFF94x [9, 30] . Solvation of enzymes was performed in the form of a gas phase with a fixed charge, RMS gradient of 0.05 kcal/ mol, and other parameters by using the standard in MOE 2009.10 software [9, 30, 33] . The initialization of the docking process was applied with MOE 2009.10 [9] . Docking simulations were performed by Compute-Simulation dock program. During the docking procedure, ligands were flexible, whereas the receptor was fixed. The application of triangle matcher for the placement method with the iteration of total 1,000,000 energy readings per position and parameter tuning was performed with the standard default value of MOE [9, 33] . A total of 1,000 populations for scoring function were utilized for LondonDG and repetition force field [9, 30, 33] . The first 100 repetitions and the second setting were shown only as one of the best results.",

In the tolerance limit area of residues plot, glysine was not allowed because it did not have a side chain, making Q (phi) and y (psi) angles not limited. The number of residue plot besides glysine showed the quality of the protein structure. The results of the Ramachandran plot showed that only Lys331 was in the outlier. About 95.8% of the residues were in the core region of the Ramachandran map, so that the homology model was used for the docking process. Superimposition was used to find out the degree of similarity between template 3CKZ chain A (PDB code) and the homology model. RMSD was calculated to find out the structural similarity between these proteins. The RMSD value of superimposition was 0.07 A, indicating that the homology model N1 was very close to the structural similarity and was therefore used for the docking process.",

The stability of hydrogen bonds also occured between Glu278 and NH3 functional group of AD3BF2D during simulations at 312 K. The stability of hydrogen bonds was also increased at simulations at 312 K between Arg293 and alcohol of the apioside group as the functional group of AD3BF2D ligand; and this interaction with Arg293 as catalytic residue of neuraminidase resulted in two hydrogen bonds (Fig. 5) . If compared with the interaction that has 10 hydrogen bonds after docking, in the binding catalytic site, interaction after simulations could not form hydrogen bonds due to the mobility of amino acid residues in the catalytic site. It had different motions in solvent or hydrated conditions. These motions proved that there were dynamic enzymes due to the effect of solvent molecules. The presence of the different functional groups in each ligand had various bond effects that resulted in the different conformations. The stable interaction of AD3BF2D ligand to form hydrogen bonds during simulations at two different temperatures provided solid evidence that this ligand had affinity with neuraminidase. More complete ligand interactions data are in the supplementary material (http://www.bioinf.uni-leipzig.de/ ,arli/supplementary_material.pdf). As shown in Fig. 6 , there were changes in conformation of the enzyme-AD3BF2D ligand complex, which occured during simulation, and showed the dynamic behaviour of the enzyme in the presence of solvent and ligand. AD3BF2D ligand remained in the binding pocket after docking, initialization stage and at the end of simulations at 300 K and 312 K. The binding pocket of this complex changed from the 'closed' form into the 'open' state at the end of simulation. Based on the simulation results, the changes in conformation of enzyme-AD3BF2D ligand complex during simulations caused apioside and ammonium functional groups to form more stable interactions with Glu278 and Arg293 compared with others. Those functional groups, namely pentyloxy, aldehyde, and carboxylate did not form hydrogen bonds with binding pocket. More conformation figures of other ligands are listed in the Supplementary Material). Fig. 7A -F shows that the ligand-receptor interaction indeed reached its stability after 2,000-3,000 ps.

The apioside group forms two hydrogen bonds with Arg293, and the ammonium group forms one hydrogen bond with Glu278 as a residue in the catalytic site of neuraminidase. This result of interaction of the apioside and ammonium group with the residue in the catalytic site of neuraminidase indicated that AD3BF2D ligand can inhibit neuraminidase and this ligand can be proposed as a candidate for neuraminidase inhibitor of influenza A virus subtype H1N1.",

A total of 1,232 oseltamivir modified ligands molecules have been designed and screened by molecular docking. Three of the best ligands, AD3BF2D, CA1G3B, and F1G4B were obtained with the lowest binding energy that contradicted to OTV as standard. These ligands 9 interactions were evaluated in hydrated state using molecular dynamics simulation. This work has provided AD3BF2D ligands that have stable interaction with Glu278 and Glu 278, Arg293 and Arg 293 during simulations at temperature of 300 K and 312 K, respectively. Based on these results, AD3BF2D ligand can be used as a candidate for neuraminidase inhibitor against influenza virus A subtype H1N1. ",
