Such a replacement targeted at the introduction of a conformationally rigid link gives the possibility of fixing the mutual positions of the nuclei in the molecule. Based on the comparative activity of the two pairs of diastereomers and the individual enantiomers a possible 3D structure of the pharmacophore can be put forward. In the case of umifenovir, this results in a change in the interaction model with a potential biological target. (For a conformationally mobile thiomethylene link an induced fit model and for the vicinally substituted cyclopropylidene fragment a lock and key model.) Such an approach has been successfully used before in the targeted design of \uf062-secretase inhibitors [5] .",

In view of the absence of antiviral activity in the obtained compounds in the range studied, the separation of individual enantiomers in the pure state was not carried out. The inconsistencies with previous evidence in the literature that were revealed in the course of the biological studies of known compounds again confirmed the need for wider investigation of the relationship of chemical structure and antiviral activity in this series of compounds. The flow rate for all of the HPLC analyses was 1 ml/min. Detectors UV (\uf06c 220 nm) and ELSD. All mass-spectrometric analysis used electrospray ionization. Elemental analysis was carried out on a Vario EL Cube apparatus. The halogen content was determined by combustion of a sample of the material in a flask filled with oxygen and using visual mercurometric titration with alkaline hydrogen peroxide solution as absorbent. A separate determination of chloride anion was carried out by the argentometric method. Melting points were measured by the capillary method using a Buchi M-565 apparatus with a heating rate of 1\uf0b0C/min (corrected values are given). TLC was carried out on Merck Alufolien Kieselgel 60 F 254 and visualized by UV light at 254 nm. Column chromatography used Alfa Aesar L14002 silica gel of size 0.06-0.20 mm (70-230 mesh). All of the syntheses used Alfa Aesar and Acros Organics chemical reagents and solvents. Solvents were dried by standard methods [11] .",

A solution of trans-2-phenylcyclopropane-1-carbazide (1) in anhydrous CH 2 Cl 2 was prepared from trans-2-phenylcyclopropane-1-carbohydrazide (20.0 g, 113 mmol) by method [7] using CH 2 Cl 2 (550 ml) in place of PhMe. It was added dropwise with stirring and cooling in an ice bath to a solution of the 2,2-dimethyl-1,3-dioxane-4,6-dione (Meldrum's acid) (16.3 g, 113 mmol) and (i-Pr) 2 NEt (60 ml, 46.9 g, 363 mmol) in absolute CH 2 Cl 2 (160 ml).
