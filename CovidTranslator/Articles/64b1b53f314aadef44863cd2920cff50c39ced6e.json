The integration and expression of the sLTB-sCOE fusion gene was confirmed in transgenic lettuce by genomic DNA PCR amplification and Northern blot analysis, respectively. Synthesis and assembly of the LTB-COE fusion protein into oligomeric structures with pentamer size were observed in transgenic plant extracts by Western blot analysis with anti-LTB or anti-COE antibodies. The binding of plantproduced LTB-COE to intestinal epithelial cell membrane glycolipid receptors was confirmed by G M1 -ganglioside enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (G M1 -ELISA). Based on the ELISA results, LTB-COE fusion protein made up about 0.026~0.048% of the total soluble protein in the transgenic lettuce leaf tissues. The synthesis and assembly of LTB-COE monomers into biologically active oligomers in transgenic lettuce leaf tissues demonstrates the feasibility of using uncooked edible plant-based vaccines for mucosal immunization. \u00a9 KSBB h\u00c9\u00f3\u00ef\u00e7\u00ea\u00c7\u00ebW=\u00c9\u00e5\u00ed\u00c9\u00ea\u00e7\u00ed\u00e7\u00f1\u00e1\u00d6\u00c9\u00e5\u00e1\u00c5=Escherichia coli \u00dc\u00c9~\u00edJ\u00e4~\u00c4\u00e1\u00e4\u00c9=\u00c9\u00e5\u00ed\u00c9\u00ea\u00e7\u00ed\u00e7\u00f1\u00e1\u00e5=_=\u00eb\u00ec\u00c4\u00ec\u00e5\u00e1\u00ed, \u00c9\u00c7\u00e1\u00c4\u00e4\u00c9=\u00ee~\u00c5\u00c5\u00e1\u00e5\u00c9, \u00e4\u00c9\u00ed\u00ed\u00ec\u00c5\u00c9I=\u00e3\u00ec\u00c5\u00e7\u00eb~\u00e4=\u00e1\u00e3\u00e3\u00ec\u00e5\u00e1J \u00f2~\u00ed\u00e1\u00e7\u00e5I=mbas= = = = =",

The mortality rate of piglets infected by PEDV is as high as 90% [1] . Since the initial identification of PED in Belgium and the United Kingdom in 1978, outbreaks of the disease have also been reported in Korea and Europe [2] [3] [4] [5] . Most vaccines are given parenterally.

The passive mucosal immune responses from feeders might be an effective way of protecting piglets against PEDV infection, because the digestive track infection typically occurs in 1~2 week-old suckling pigs [1] . The neutralizing epitope of PEDV was identified based on the sequence information for the neutralizing epitope of the transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) [7] and oral administration of the transgenic plants expressing the neutralizing epitope induced effective protective immune responses against PEDV infection in mice [8] .",

Plant-based vaccines are inexpensive to produce, easy to store, safe from contamination by animal pathogens, and lack the risk of needle-associated injury and disease spread. In 1990, the World Health Organization (WHO) launched the Children's Vaccine Initiative, establishing goals for the development of mucosal vaccines that are safe, inexpensive, easily (orally) administrated, widely accessible for distribution, and capable of being stored without refrigeration [16] . Plant-based vaccines are realistic mucosal vaccine candidates for these purposes. However, low and no immune responses are obstacles for the use of transgenic plants as vaccines, which are due to the low expression levels of vaccine antigens representing only 0.001~0.3% of the total soluble protein in transgenic plants [17] . The expression of antigens in plants could be improved by using a strong promoter, chloroplast transformation [18] , plant-based codon optimization [19] , agroinfiltration [20] , and magnification methods [21] . A useful, alternative strategy is to use LTB or CTB as carriers and adjuvants to stimulate immune responses to the antigen or to increase uptake of the antigen molecules into the mucosal immune system [22] .",

An aliquot of the supernatant containing 100 \u00b5g of total soluble protein, as determined by the Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad, Inc., Hercules, CA), was separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) at 100 V for 1.5 to 2 h in Trisglycine buffer (25 mM Tris-Cl, 250 mM glycine, pH 8.3, and 0.1% SDS).

Nonspecific antibody binding was blocked by incubation of the membrane in 20 mL of 5% non-fat dry milk in a TBS buffer (20 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, and 500 mM NaCl) for 1 h with gentle agitation on a rotary shaker (40 rpm), followed by washing in a TBS buffer for 5 min.

The expression levels of plant-expressed LTB-COE fusion protein and their affinity for G M1 -ganglioside receptor were determined by G M1 -ELISA [34] .

The G M1 -ELISA demonstrated that the LTB-COE fusion protein produced in transgenic lettuce showed a strong affinity to G M1 -ganglioside. Nontransgenic plant protein extracts and BSA negative controls showed no affinity to G M1 -ganglioside (Fig. 5A) . Assembly of LTB-COE monomers into oligomeric (pentamer) structures is essential for epithelial cell binding and uptake into mucosal immune systems. Therefore, the performance of LTB carrier and adjuvant functions in animals immunized with the LTB-antigen fusion proteins is contingent on pentamer assembly. Both immunoblot analysis and G M1 -ELISA experiments demonstrated that LTB-COE fusion proteins assembled into biologically active pentamer structures in transgenic lettuce.",

Seven out of 11 transgenic lettuce plants showed a positive signal for sLTB-sCOE, but no signal was found in 4 transgenic and non-transgenic lettuces (Fig. 2B). Although genomic DNA PCR analysis showed the bands of sLTB-sCOE fusion genes in all of the transgenic plants, 4 out of 11 transgenic plants showed undetectable mRNA bands of sLTB-sCOE in Northern blot analysis. These different expression levels of sLTB-sCOE fusion gene among the transgenic plants are due to the different incorporation sites of the target gene in the chromosomes of individual plants, known as the 'position effect' [36,37]. The three transgenic plants showing high expression of sLTB-sCOE fusion gene (no.1, 5, and 8) were selected for further analysis.

Plant protein extracts from transgenic plants and known amounts of purified bacterial LTB were used to measure the expression levels of LTB-COE fusion proteins in transgenic plants.

The LTB-COE fusion proteins were detected both in boiled and unboiled samples of transgenic lettuce leaf tissue extracts with anti-LTB antibody (Figs. 4A and 4C). No signal band corresponding to the LTB-COE fusion proteins were detected in boiled or unboiled non-transgenic plant protein extracts.

Several bands and smear bands shown in the immunoblot analysis with antibodies against LTB indicate that assembly and aggregates of LTB-COE fusion proteins might be dependant on high-level expression of LTB-COE fusion proteins in transgenic plant leaf tissues.
