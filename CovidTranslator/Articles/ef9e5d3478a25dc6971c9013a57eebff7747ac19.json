The results of experiments with ten IBV strains are summarized as follows. 1. All the IBV strains tested induced interferon in chick embryo (CE) cells, chicken kidney (CK) cells and embryonated eggs. The Iowa-609 strain induced about 1000 units of interferon in CE cells while the Beaudette-42 strain induced about 200 units of interferon in embryonated eggs; the interferon titers induced by other strains usually ranged from 5 to 60 units. No IBV strain induced interferon in HeLa or BHK-21 cells. 2. IBV particles inactivated by ultraviolet irradiation or by heating lost their ability to induce interferon. 3. The properties of the interferon produced in the present study are similar to those of other interferons produced in chicken cells. 4. HeLa or BHK-21 cells did not acquire resistance to virus infection, after incubation with interferon produced in CE cells. On the other hand, CK cells acquired the same degree of resistance to virus infection as CE cells after incubation with interferon produced in CE cells. 5. All the IBV strains tested were sensitive to interferon in CK cells. The sensitivities of Massachusetts-41 and Holte strains to interferon were similar to that of vesicular stomatitis virus.",

However, the ability of IBV to induce interferon appears rather weak, as the interferon titer with most strains was not high and a few investigators (4, t0) have failed to induce interferon with the Massachusetts strain. Furthermore, a large inoculum was required for interferon induction. No interferon was induced in HeLa or BHK-21 cells by any IBV strain, even though the Be-42 and Holte strains grew in BHK-21 cells (13) . Thus, we suggest that IBV can only induce interferon in chicken cells or organs. However, other mammalian cells must be tested to confirm this suggestion.",

However, unlike some viruses (2, 3, 10, 15, 16) , there is no close relationship between the ability of any strain to induce interferon and its sensitivity to interferon. Similarly, the resistance of the IBV strains to various chemical and physical treatments (12) or their growth in various cells (13) probably bears no relationship to their ability to induce interferon or their sensitivity to interferon. We conclude that IBV is an interferon sensitive virus rather than an interferon inducing virus. However, the interferon sensitivity of the IBV strains should be examined in in vivo systems, as the sensitivity of viruses to interferon is not always the same in different systems (17) .",
