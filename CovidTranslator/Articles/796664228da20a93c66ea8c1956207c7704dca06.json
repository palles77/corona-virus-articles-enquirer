(1) In particular, S. agalactiae capsular type III strains belonging to the hypervirulent clonal complex 17 have been significantly associated with meningitis and account for up to 44 early onset disease and 67% late onset disease cases compared with less than 10% of colonising isolates. (2, 3) Microorganisms interact with host cell lipid rafts microdomains to enter and survive inside the cell. (4) Lipid rafts play an important role in a variety of cellular functions, including polarisation, signal transduction, endocytosis, secretion, cell-cell and cell-pathogen adhesion. Several pathogens, such as viruses, bacteria and protozoa, can use the host-cell lipid rafts to secure their entrance and maintenance inside target cells. The benefit provided by interaction with lipid rafts can vary from one pathogen to another. (5) Lipid rafts are considered as dynamic assemblies of cholesterol and sphingolipids in",

(6) Cholesterol is a major component of microdomains, which differ from nonraft domains of the cell membrane. (7) The cholesterol binding agent, methyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin (M\u03b2CD), can disrupt lipid rafts by depleting cholesterol from lipid rafts and decrease the number of these specialised microdomains on the plasma membrane. (8) Signaling molecules, including PI3Ks, are involved in cytoskeleton reorganisation, compartmentalised in lipid rafts, and are concentrated at membrane ruffles. (9, 10) The ability of S. agalactiae to invade a number of host-cell types has been clearly demonstrated. (1, 11) However, the invasion process is not well understood. Subversion of the PI3K/Akt pathway by S. agalactiae resulted in coordination of actin rearrangement and internalisation of the microorganism. (11) PI3K is the major activator of Akt, playing a central role in fundamental biological processes including cell growth, proliferation, migration and survival, through phosphorylation of a plethora of substrates. (12) Previous studies showed that the integrity of lipid rafts and PI3K activity are required for S. agalactiae invasion to Ishikawa cells. (9) However, further studies are needed to elucidate the involvement of lipid raft components and PI3K/Akt signalling pathway during invasion of human endothelial cells by S. agalactiae. This work provides further evidences that lipid rafts and PI3K are implicated in S. agalactiae invasion to human endothelial cells.",

The viability of total bacteria (intracellular plus surface adherent) was estimated by plating endothelial lysates and counting the resulting colonies emerging in BAB plates containing 5% sheep defibrinated blood. To measure bacterial internalisation, the infected monolayers were rinsed three times with M199 medium and incubated for an additional 2 h period in M199 containing bactericidal amounts of gentamicin (100 \u03bcg/mL, Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO, USA) and penicillin G (5 \u03bcg/mL, Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO, USA). We also performed a count of cells that invaded and adhered shortly after the interaction with S. agalactiae and 0.5 h after. The number of internalised bacteria was determined as outlined above. Adherence rates were determined as: [CFU of total cellassociated (intracellular viable plus surface adherent) S. agalactiae -CFU intracellular S. agalactiae].

Staining for flotillin-1 revealed a colocalisation with GBS90356 strain in untreated HUVEC cells (Fig. 2C ), but no colocalisation was detected in cells treated with M\u03b2CD, a cholesterol depleting agent (Fig. 2F) . We also found a colocalisation of GBS90356 strain and caveolin-1 after pretreatment of HUVEC with M\u03b2CD ( Fig.  2D ), but not in untreated cells ( Fig. 2A) . By contrast, no significant colocalisation could be observed between GBS90356 strain and caveolin-2 in HUVEC cells treated or not with M\u03b2CD (Fig. 2B, E) . These results suggest that caveolin-1 and flotillin-1 could be involved in the invasion of S. agalactiae GBS90356 strain in HUVEC cells. Fig. 3 shows the activation of PI3K/Akt pathway during the interaction between S. agalactiae GBS90356 and HUVEC cells pretreated with LY294002 (PI3K inhibitor) and/or M\u03b2CD (cholesterol depletion agent). Immunoblotting analysis revealed higher levels of phosphorylated Akt with a peak at 15 min post-infection of HUVEC by S. agalactiae. Inhibition assays with M\u03b2CD completely abolished the AKT phosphorylation (Fig. 3A) . To verify whether the phosphorylation of Akt in HUVEC cells, treated or not with M\u03b2CD, was PI3K-dependent or -independent following infection with GBS90356 strain, the specific PI3K inhibitor LY294002 was incubated prior to bacterial infection. Activation of the PI3K pathway occurred at 5 min post-infection and peak at 30 min. Both inhibitors reduced the PI3K phosphorylation (Fig. 3B ). Results were confirmed by densitometry analysis (Fig. 3C, D) . Overall, the results indicate the involvement of lipid rafts and PI3K/AKT pathway activation during S. agalactiae internalisation in human endothelial cells.",

            "text": "Lipid rafts often serve as an entry site for many microorganisms. Studies have shown that extraction of membrane cholesterol inhibited bacterial infection in the early stages of invasion. (15) The mechanisms that underlie this interaction are starting to be unraveled. Several pathogenic bacteria have been associated with lipid rafts, such as Francisella tularensis, Helicobacter pylori, Pseudomonas gengivalis and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. (5) Seveau et al. (16) demonstrated for the first time that the cell adhesion molecule E-cadherin is required in host lipid rafts to mediate Listeria monocytogenes entry. A previous study showed that S. agalactiae exploited lipid rafts to invade human endometrial cells. (9) In this work, we evaluated the influence of host cell lipid rafts during S. agalactiae internalisation in HUVEC by using methyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin (M\u03b2CD), a water-soluble cyclic oligosaccharide that depletes membrane cholesterol and disrupt lipid rafts. (8) Cholesterol-enriched membrane microdomains may provide a platform to concentrate receptors on the host cell membrane. (17) Our data support the notion that lipid rafts on the plasma membrane of HUVEC cells facilitate entry of S. agalactiae GBS90356 strain. The significant decrease in cytoadhesion of GBS90356 strain to human endothelial cells treated with M\u03b2CD indicated that cholesterol depletion from the cell membrane perturbed the attachment of bacteria and altered the GBS90356 entry at post-binding steps. The reduction in the number of GBS90356 in cholesterol-depleted cells probably occurred at initial steps of infection, since significant inhibitory effect was reduced after 4h post-infection and became undetectable at 24 h post-infection (data not shown). Interaction of GBS90356 strain with cholesterol-enriched microdomains occurred probably with the participation of flotillin-1 and caveolin-1-enriched membrane microdomains.",

(18, 19, 20) Several cargo molecules, such as the GPI-anchored protein CD59, cholera toxin B subunit, virus, proteoglycans and proteoglycan bound ligands have been suggested to utilise an internalisation pathway that depends on flotillin. (21, 22) Previous data suggested that the highly dynamic flotillin microdomains become static just prior to their internalisation, which might be caused by coalescence of flotillin oligomers into larger oligomeric structures, participating in the formation of specific non-caveolar microdomains. (23) Currently, our results suggest that S. agalactiae GBS90356 induces flotillin-1 assembly to specific flotillin microdomains, which induce membrane curvature and thus generate membrane buds to entry to the HUVEC. Interestingly, the enrichment of flotillin-1 on post-LAMP endocytic organelles during maturing phagosomes might be involved in actin filament remodeling and lipid changes for phagosome-lysosomes fusion. (18) Further studies to verify if flotillin-1 colocalise with S. agalactiae in early endosomes are in progress.",

            "text": "Interestingly, treatment with M\u03b2CD decreased the colocalisation of GBS90356 strain with flotillin-1, fa- voring bacterial interaction with caveolin-1. Cholesterol levels are important for maintaining membrane fluidity, and its removal can reduce lateral diffusion within the cell membrane. The reduction in fluidity could perhaps affect distribution of receptors within the plasma membrane, which may damage signal transduction events, polarisation and F-actin polymerisation. (24) Our results suggest that cholesterol depletion by M\u03b2CD may have exposed caveolin-1 molecules, favoring recognition by GBS90356 strain. Caveolin-1 is critical for enhancing the innate immune response, which contributes to survival during LPS-induced sepsis. (25) Also observed in intracellular parasites as the inhibition of lysosomal fusion, a classical escape mechanism was observed after infection by Mycobacterium, Chlamydia, Toxoplasma and Trypanosoma cruzi, for example. Another way that pathogens can prolong their survival inside the host is by prevention of host-cell apoptosis and by the modulation of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species generation. (5) Szczepanski et al. (26) revealed that canine respiratory coronavirus enters HRT-18G cells via the caveolin-1 dependent pathway. Thus, these previous results support the notion that caveolin-1 might play a role in the interaction of S. agalactiae and HUVEC cells.",

(10) In this work, we demonstrated that the integrity of lipid rafts microdomains and the activity of PI3K/Akt are required for invasion of GBS90356 strain to human endothelial cells. Indeed, the phosphorylation of Akt and PI3K were suppressed by cholesterol depletion using M\u03b2CD, suggesting that membrane microdomain integrity is important for PI3K/Akt activation during S. agalactiae infection. Peres et al. (27) showed that membrane microdomains were an essential site for PI3K activation during lysophosphatidic acid stimulation in Vero cells. Lipid rafts also induced platelet aggregation via PI3K-dependent Akt phosphorylation by stromal cell-derived factor-1\u03b1 signaling. (10) We cannot exclude the possibility that the results obtained in our studies could be specific to S. agalactiae type III belonging to the hypervirulent ST-17, and that other capsular type III strains could behave in different ways. More studies are necessary to unravel this possibility.",
