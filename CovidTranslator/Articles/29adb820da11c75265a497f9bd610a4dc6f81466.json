Compared with other species of domestic hoofstock, these signs in camelids commonly arise from upper respiratory tract dysfunction or from multisystemic diseases, rather than from pneumonia. Thus, the veterinarian should be prepared to explore beyond thoracic auscultation and beyond the respiratory tract altogether, even if the camelid is demonstrating overt signs of respiratory tract dysfunction.",

The nasolacrimal orifice is positioned on the medial aspect of the lateral cartilaginous wall of the nasal cavity and is usually just beyond what may be seen without an endoscope. This narrowness may be an adaptation to moisten and warm inspired air in the dry, hot, or cold native environments. Regardless of the cause, the narrowness of the airway allows small amounts of compromise to severely restrict air flow and also means that many diagnostic or therapeutic modalities such as paranasal endoscopy and nasogastric or nasotracheal intubation are more difficult to perform on camelids than on some other species. Of the passages, the ventral meatus is the largest, and its ventromedial component represents the widest, straightest path to the larynx. Its dorsal component is approximately half the diameter and often too narrow to allow passage of a tube or endoscope. Therefore, it is helpful to manually press either of those items as ventromedially as possible during entry in to the nose.",

Its pulse is usually palpable, although the structure of the artery itself usually is not. It is usually approached perpendicularly (see Figure 37 -1). The saphenous artery is often both visible and palpable from medial midthigh to below the stifle.

In most cases, the underlying cause is unknown, but it is postulated that this is part of the stress response, especially in weakened or sedated camelids. In some cases, fatigue of the airway musculature caused by chronic high airway resistance or a neuromuscular defect may play a role. Clinical signs include dyspnea, stridor, openmouthed breathing, dorsiflexion of the head and neck, regurgitation, nystagmus, and death. Definitive diagnosis requires upper airway endoscopy ( Figure 37-3) , but the diagnosis can often be inferred, as endoscopy of patients in respiratory distress may be unnecessarily life threatening. Possible treatments include administration of nasal oxygen, maintaining the head and neck in extension, placing a towel over the eyes to reduce sensory input, reversal of sedative medications, and tracheostomy. When stress is the causative factor, handling to administer medications, draw blood samples, maintain the neck in a certain position, or perform other diagnostic or therapeutic procedures may worsen the condition. Such camelids may improve if allowed to recover on their own. However, camelids with spontaneous dorsiflexion rarely improve without some degree of intervention. When this appears to be In dyspneic camelids, endoscopy does reduce available airway and may lead to distress of the patient, so procedures should be completed as quickly as possible.

It results from failure of the buccopharyngeal membranes to completely rupture during the early second trimester of fetal development, leaving membranous or bony obstructions over one or both nasal passages ( Figure 37 -5) . Camelids with unilateral lesions may thrive into adulthood, showing little more than a heightened respiratory rate, open-mouthed breathing, or dyspnea when stressed. Bilaterally affected neonates are born with little or no ability to breathe nasally. Thus, clinical signs start immediately or soon after birth. Affected crias typically display open-mouthed breathing, with the lips pulled away from the mouth, stertor (inspiratory or expiratory), and pronounced nostril flaring (Figure 37-6). They often have difficulty eating and are at high risk for aspiration. Air flow at the nostrils is absent or reduced, and soft rubber tubes cannot be passed nasally beyond the level of the eye. Definitive diagnosis may be achieved by endoscopic examination with a pediatric endoscope (up to approximately 6 mm diameter), plain radiography, contrast radiology, in which approximately 5 to 10 milliliters (mL) of contrast (preferably an organic iodide to reduce risk of aspiration complications) is instilled into each nasal passage and the nose held in dorsal extension Infection on the skin of the nares by Conidiobolus coronatus in two llamas led to proliferation of tissue, chronic nasal discharge, and eventual occlusion of the nasal passages. 14, 15 Conidiobolus is a tropical fungus and most common in the Gulf Coast region in the United States, but one infected llama was a lifelong resident of Illinois. Diagnosis was achieved by histopathologic examination of tissue sections and fungal culture.

The disease is spread by biting Culicoides flies (midges), occasionally through semen, and occasionally transplacentally. Most transmission is strongly linked to fly season. Although cattle rarely show more than occasional reproductive problems, including abortion and birth defects, some other species, particular sheep and some wild cervids and ruminants, often suffer severe, often lethal disease. The underlying lesion is vasculitis. Common clinical signs include fever, anorexia, facial and lingual edema, oral ulceration, cyanosis, lameness, and dyspnea. Death is usually the result of pulmonary edema or secondary bacterial infections.",

Affected camelids may have anything from mild serous discharge to thick, profuse nasal discharge or dyspnea. Fever is uncommon and often associated with a poor prognosis.

With S. zooepidemicus very common in most places with sizeable equine populations, and llamas and alpacas becoming more common, transspecies transmission was just a matter of time. Alpaca fever appears to start as a superficial infection of wounds, the prepuce, or the udder that causes local swelling and discomfort, or as a generalized internal infection. Superficial infections may become generalized, and about half the affected camelids die. Generalized infections may be cleared, leaving abscesses, usually in the abdominal cavity or lungs. In North America, the organism has been isolated from blood, milk, uterine discharges, abscesses, wounds, and body cavity exudates (pleural or peritoneal fluid). Affected camelids have shown a broad spectrum of different clinical signs, ranging from infertility, uterine discharges, abnormal milk, and superficial swelling to tachypnea, dyspnea, cough, tenesmus, diarrhea, and colic. Signs of internal infection are accompanied by fever (102.5\u00b0F-106\u00b0F), depression, and anorexia, but these may not be present with focal disease. Most camelids with the generalized form of this streptococcal disease show signs referable to the abdominal cavity, and a smaller number also or predominately show respiratory signs. 38 This has given rise to the belief that the organism gains access to the body through the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and not the respiratory tract or lymphoreticular organs, as occurs with most other streptococcal infection (in horses, humans, etc.). This is probably untrue. Research has demonstrated the efficiency of respiratory infection, and greater use of ultrasonography in the diagnostic evaluation of sick camelids has identified pleuritis in a high percentage of cases. 37 Alternative forms of transmission are also possible; anecdotally, this infection has been seen in camelids after orogastric intubation and reproductive examinations using equipment that may have been previously used on horses.",

With chronicity, these dull or abnormal areas may grow, and fever, anorexia, and obtundation may develop in a progressive fashion. The leukogram may show inflammatory changes, including either neutropenia or neutrophilia with a left shift. Hyperfibrinogenemia may develop after 24 hours. ABG analysis may reveal hypoxemia. Thoracic radiography may reveal areas of consolidation, particularly in the cranioventral or midventral lung. Tracheal wash or BAL reveals the presence of feed material and inflammatory cells and, if gastric contents are aspirated, also the presence of bacteria, fungi, and protozoa.",

On first occurrence, the camelid's head should be maintained lower than the heart base, and the camelid should be allowed to cough freely. In many cases of acute abnormal regurgitation, the feed material does not reach the lung and may be expelled without causing pneumonia. If feed material has reached the lungs, the camelid should be treated aggressively with broad-spectrum antibiotics and antiinflammatory drugs. Many upper airway and forestomach bacteria are facultative anaerobes, so the chosen antimicrobial agents should cover that spectrum. Combinations of an aminoglycoside with a \u03b2-lactam agent are common, potentially with the addition of metronidazole. Other basic care, including fluid, oxygen, nutritional support, and environmental support, may be necessary in severe cases. The prognosis relates chiefly to the amount of feed material aspirated and how long it is present in the lungs before initiation of treatment.",

Transmission is through inhalation or ingestion of materials contaminated by the wildlife or ruminant host. Transmission among camelids and from camelids to humans is suspected as well. 44, 54, 55 One owner in the United Kingdom was recently diagnosed with the same spoligotype of M. bovis that had previously been found in her herd; a common source of infection, rather than direct transmission from a camelid, is also possible. The potential for direct transmission is supported by the presence of oral granulomas and evidence of granulomas communicating with airways in some camelids and also the recent evidence of infection of the udder. 45, 56 Most mycobacteria affect several organ systems but primarily the lung. The basic lesion is the granuloma, and the usual course is slow progression. Camelids covered with fleece and not monitored carefully may develop advanced disease before it is detected, and anecdotal evidence suggests that infection may take years to become apparent in some camelids. Premortem evaluations have been relatively limited. The most common signs are weight loss, weakness, lethargy, recumbency, and anorexia. External lymphadenopathy may be detectable in some animals; internal lymphadenopathy may also be detectable through rectal palpation or imaging studies. The minority show respiratory signs, which may include a shallow breathing pattern with increased expiratory effort, and general harshness of lung sounds. Hematologic abnormalities may include anemia, neutrophilic leukocytosis, and lymphocytosis. Often, marked hyperglobulinemia with concurrent hypoalbuminemia exists. Thoracic radiography and ultrasonographic evaluation of the chest, liver, spleen, and regional lymph nodes may reveal multifocal radiodense or hyperechoic nodular lesions, possibly coalescing into diffuse areas of consolidation. Biopsies or aspirates of these or transtracheal wash samples may reveal acid-fast bacilli, which may be identified by mycobacterial culture and typed by PCR. Typing is important because the different pathogens have different legal aspects and zoonotic potential. Mycobacterial diseases are reportable in many areas.",

Fungal culture and culture characteristics may be used to identify the causative agent. Because of the infectivity of Coccidioides, all manipulations should be done on sealed samples or within suitable biohazard hoods. Skin lesions may be aspirated or biopsied. Skin testing and serum complement fixation appear to offer inconclusive results.

            "text": "Diaphragmatic defects account for 1% of all reported birth defects in one study. 9 As clinical reports are rare, most of these are likely to have been found in crias that did not survive the immediate postparturient period or were found incidentally in older camelids. 83, 84 Clinical disease is the result of compression of the lungs by herniated abdominal viscera or incarceration of those viscera. Affected crias are likely to be in respiratory distress with tachypnea, dyspnea, and blood gas evidence of hypoxemia and hypoventilation. \"Dog sitting\" may be an attempt to reduce pressure on the lungs. Depending on which viscera passes through the defect and the tightness of the hernial ring, colic and shock signs may also be present. Diagnosis is accomplished by identifying the herniated viscera on an imaging study; radiography, ultrasonography, or crosssectional imaging techniques may all be used. Diagnosis may also be achieved during exploratory surgery to identify the cause of the colic. In that case, extreme care must be taken to avoid abrupt, severe pneumothorax on opening the abdomen or retrieving the viscera through the defect. One report described a 7-year-old llama gelding with incarceration of the ileum, cecum, and ascending colon within the thorax through a smooth-edged diaphragmatic defect. 83 Because of the nature of the defect, a congenital lesion was suspected. Herniation recurred 9 months after surgical repair. A second report described a suspected congenital hernia found in an 18-monthold alpaca with recurrent colic episodes. 84 In this case, the heart was found partially within the abdomen after death. Previous exploratory had not revealed the defect but had revealed adhesions involving the jejunum.",
