This study aims to evaluate a composite objective structured clinical examination (OSCE) that assesses postgraduate year-1 (PGY 1 ) residents' acquisition of the six core competencies defined by the Accreditation council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME). Methods: Six-core-competency-based OSCE was used as examination of the clinical performance of 192 PGY 1 residents during their 3-month internal medicine training between 2007 January and 2009 December. For each year, the reliability of the entire examination was calculated with Cronbach's alpha. Results: The reliability of six-core-competency-based OSCE was acceptable, ranging from 0.69 to 0.87 between 2007 and 2009. In comparison with baseline scores, the summary scores and core-competency subscores all showed significant increase after PGY 1 residents finished their 3-month internal medicine training program. Conclusion: By using a structured development process, the authors were able to create reliable evaluation items for determining PGY 1 residents' acquisition of the ACGME core competencies.",

The Department of Health, Executive Yuan of Taiwan ROC has made efforts in promoting the \"Project of Reforming Taiwan's Medical Care and Public Healthcare System\" since the spread of SARS was controlled. The reform of the medical care system aimed to provide better holistic medical treatment to people. The strategies and methods are strengthening the improvement of resident education and quality of medical care. A project titled \"Postgraduate General Medical Training Program\" was announced by the Department of Health in August 2003. Through this project, each doctor in his/her first year of residency (including internal medicine, family medicine, surgery, pediatrics, dermatologist, ophthalmologist, etc.) is required to fulfill 3 months of an internal medical training course, along with 36 hours of basic courses. In the past, there was no such program in Taiwan to provide general medical training for medical students after graduation. Therefore, the goal of this program is to ensure that all PGY 1 residents have acquired Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) core competence in internal medical care.",

Taipei VGH is a regional medical center that provides primary and tertiary care to active duty and retired military members, and their dependents. Taipei VGH serves as the primary teaching hospital for its internal medicine residency program. The examination was conducted on two consecutive Friday afternoons during the internal medicine training program of all PGY 1 residents. The OSCE consisted of 6 clinical problems (Table 1) ; each clinical problem consists of six core competencies defined by the ACGME ( Table 2 ). The content of each clinical problem is included in Table 1 . 8 The OSCE has neither a written component nor technical skills stations, but is entirely performance-based. At some stations, standardized patients were used to mimic the clinical problems of actual patients. A faculty rater graded each PGY 1 resident according to a given set of 12 predetermined items (using 2 items to evaluate each aspect of the ACGME core competencies) presented in the form of a checklist. The checklists for all 6 OSCE stations have similar items to cover ACGME core competency. The items that PGY 1 presented completely were scored as \"1\" and those not presented were scored as \"0\". All faculty raters attended serial training sessions that included extensive instructions on how to use the checklist in practice rating sessions. At each OSCE station, the raters acted as passive evaluators and were instructed not to guide or prompt the PGY 1 residents.",

            "text": "PCA is a form of factor analysis. In our study, factoranalytic techniques were used to detect structure in the relationship between variables. With PCA, a \"line\" (an eigen vector) is defined in the scatter plot that illustrates maximal variance. This is also known as the \"factor proportion\" or the \"factor load\". The square of the factor proportion gives the percentage of the variability that an element contributes to a system. After this first factor has been extracted, the next line (second eigen vector) that maximizes variances is defined. In this way, one is able to determine the contribution of each consecutive factor to the overall variability of the results. 11, 12 Reliability on the aspects of professionalism and systembased practice were lower (Cronbach's alpha \u00bc 0.31 and 0.419, respectively) than the other four aspects of core competency (Cronbach's alpha: patient care \u00bc 0.577; medical knowledge \u00bc 0.74; interpersonal and communication skills \u00bc 0.576; problem-based learning and improvement \u00bc 0.596). Certainly, the generally low inter-rater reliability of corecompetency-based OSCE indicated that raters were still not familiar with the scoring system in our study. In other words, program directors should further unify the consensus between raters about the core-competency scoring system. 17 Actually, it has been suggested that OSCE is not a good tool to assess medical knowledge. Thus, it is essential for program directors to add chart stimulation recall, oral and multiple choice question written examinations to assess medical knowledge in the future. 14e16 In our study, PGY 1 residents should complete each station within 15 minutes, and a 5-minute changeover time was allowed between stations; total testing time was 2 hours. It had been established that limited testing time is another possible factor for the low inter-rater reliability. Indeed, it was difficult for raters to judge 12 items on the checklist during every 15-minute station in our study. The literature is clear that longer periods improve the reliability of OSCE. 6 Accordingly, longer test period is mandatory for more widely focused complex clinical problem in our core-competency-based OSCE.",

First, scores in each group have a major impact on the mean scores and standard deviations at each year level.

Using the Spearman-Brown formula, it is estimated that two additional stations would be necessary using the bench model with global scoring to achieve a reliability of 0.8. In the present study, each OSCE station measured two aspects of ACGME core competency and assessed two to four specific skills.
