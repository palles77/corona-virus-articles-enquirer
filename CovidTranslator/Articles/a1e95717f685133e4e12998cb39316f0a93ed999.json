            "text": "Newcastle disease (ND) is a contagious disease that affects most species of birds. Its causative pathogen, Newcastle disease virus (NDV), also exhibits considerable oncolytic activity against mammalian cancers. A better understanding of the pathogenesis of NDV will help us design efficient vaccines and novel anticancer strategies. GW3965, a widely used synthetic ligand of liver X receptor (LXR), induces the expression of LXRs and its downstream genes, including ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1). ABCA1 regulates cellular cholesterol homeostasis. Here, we found that GW3965 inhibited NDV infection in DF-1 cells. It also inhibited NF-jB activation and reduced the upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines induced by the infection. Further studies showed that GW3965 exerted its inhibitory effects on virus entry and replication. NDV infection increased the mRNA levels of several lipogenic genes but decreased the ABCA1 mRNA level. Overexpression of ABCA1 inhibited NDV infection and reduced the cholesterol content in DF-1 cells, but when the cholesterol was replenished, NDV infection was restored. GW3965 treatment prevented cholesterol accumulation in the perinuclear area of the infected cells. In summary, our studies suggest that GW3965 inhibits NDV infection, probably by affecting cholesterol homeostasis.",

We therefore hypothesized that GW3965 might inhibit NDV infection. The cytotoxicity experiment showed that GW3965 did not cause significant cytotoxic effects in DF-1 cells at 0.1, 0.5, and 1 lM (Fig. 1A) . We next explored the anti-NDV activity of GW3965 in DF-1 cells. The infected cells were incubated with different concentrations of GW3965 for 12h. The inhibitory effect of GW3965 was assessed by western blot, which demonstrated that GW3965 could significantly reduce the expression level of viral protein NP (Fig. 1B) .",

NF-jB is released and translocated into the nucleolus to regulate gene transcription. To explore the effect of GW3965 on the NF-jB signaling pathway in virus infection, the protein levels of IjBa, p65, phosphor-IjBa and phosphor-p65 were determined by Western blot. The results indicated that GW3965 suppressed the degradation of IjBa and the activation of NF-jB in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3) .

Many studies demonstrate that GW3965 exhibits a potent anti-inflammatory effect on the pathogenesis of various diseases by modulating the production of inflammatory cytokines [10, 45] . To explore whether GW3965 has an anti-inflammatory effect in DF-1 cells, we detected the expression of proinflammatory cytokines in infected cells. The qRT-PCR results showed that GW3965 significantly (p \\ 0.05) reduced the gene expression of IL-1b, IL-6, IL-8, TNF-a and IFN-b induced by NDV infection at 12 h compared to DMSO-treated cells (Fig. 4A-E) .

As cholesterol is essential for virus entry, replication, and production, we hypothesized that ABCA1 might play an important role in the inhibition of NDV infection by regulating cholesterol efflux. To explore the function of ABCA1 in NDV infection, we overexpressed EGFP-ABCA1 (kindly provided by Prof. Pelkmans, University of Zurich) in DF-1 cells, followed by NDV infection. The western blot analysis showed that the NP protein expression level was significantly decreased in ABCA1-overexpressing cells (Fig. 6A, lane 2) , whereas the virus infectivity could be restored when cholesterol was replenished (Fig. 6A, lane 3) . The expression of EGFP and EGFP-ABCA1 were confirmed by western blot analysis (Fig. 6A) . We also determined the cellular cholesterol content in the infected cells and in the infected cells with overexpressed ABCA1. The data demonstrated that the cholesterol content was not changed significantly in virusinfected cells, but overexpression of ABCA1 decreased the cholesterol content in both mock-infected and virus-infected cells (Fig. 6B) . We found that cholesterol replenishment could attenuate the inhibitory effect of GW3965 on virus infectivity (Fig. 6C, lane 2 and 3) . GW3965 also decreased the cholesterol content in both mock-infected and NDVinfected cells (Fig. 6D) . The mRNA level of HMG-CoA reductase (HMGCR), a rate-limiting enzyme for cholesterol synthesis, was determined by qRT-PCR. The result illustrated that the gene expression of HMGCR was not changed significantly in infected cells (Fig. 6E) . We stained the mock-infected and virus-infected cells with filipin III to determine the distribution of cellular cholesterol. The results demonstrated that cholesterol accumulated in the perinuclear area of the infected cells compared to mock-infected cells (Fig. 6F) , which was similar to the result in a previous study on West Nile virus [22] . GW3965 treatment decreased the cholesterol content in both mock-infected cells and NDV-infected cells.",

GW3965 is a widely used ligand that specifically activates LXR-a and LXR-b in many cell lines. Our results showed that GW3965 inhibited NDV propagation in DF-1 cells. It decreased the viral protein expression level and viral gRNA level during the infection. Meanwhile, GW3965 treatment reduced the mRNA and protein expression levels of inflammatory cytokines (including IL-1b, IL-6, IL-8, IFN-b, and TNF-a) in infected DF-1 cells.

Cholesterol is an essential component of cellular membranes and is also vital for the integrity of various viruses, since the envelope membranes of these viruses are derived from the host membranes [12] . Generally, cells upregulate ABCA1 expression to promote cholesterol efflux and reduce cholesterol influx when the intracellular cholesterol concentration is increased [3] . To investigate the function of ABCA1 in NDV infection, we overexpressed ABCA1 in DF-1 cells. The expression level of NP protein was decreased significantly in ABCA1 overexpressing cells. Our studies suggested that GW3965 inhibited NDV entry and replication. GW3965 treatment increases the expression of ABCA1. The content of cholesterol was decreased in GW3965-treated or ABCA1 over-expressing cells because of cholesterol efflux. Considering its regulation of cholesterol efflux, we suspected that ABCA1 might promote cholesterol efflux and affect cholesterol content in the cell membrane that was required for the optimal cell entry of NDV [23] . Several investigations have strongly suggested that lipids, including cholesterol and phospholipids, play critical roles in virus replication. The reason for the inhibitory effect of GW3965 on NDV replication might be multifaceted. One possible explanation is that cholesterol might be vital for producing an optimal lipid environment for virus replication, which could be disrupted by cholesterol depletion after ABCA1 was upregulated by GW3965 treatment. The accumulation of cholesterol in NDV-infected cells partially supported this possibility. In our studies, we did not determine the effect of GW3965 on virus assembly and budding due to the lack of a reliable method. It was shown that lipid rafts are important for ordered assembly and budding of infectious Newcastle disease virus particles [16] . Therefore, we suspected that GW3965 might affect NDV assembly and release, since cholesterol is an important component of lipid rafts.",

Viral NS5A protein, core protein, and viral replication increase LXR-a and its downstream lipogenic gene expression. Viral NS5A and core proteins do not interact with LXR-a, implying that they indirectly increase the transcriptional activity of LXR-a. Further study indicates that viral proteins and viral replication mediate LXR-a expression through the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway [9] . Nef, an accessory protein of HIV, inhibits the activity of ABCA1 in infected macrophages, which could suppress cholesterol efflux and result in the accumulation of intracellular cholesterol. Nef downregulates ABCA1 expression, which requires interaction between Nef and ABCA1 [25] . A new study revealed that Nef disrupts the interaction between the ER chaperone calnexin and ABCA1, which is essential for the functionality of ABCA1 [13] . Activation of Toll-like receptors 3 and 4 by E. coli and influenza virus infection blocks the induction of ABCA1 in culture macrophages and aortic tissue and therefore inhibits cholesterol efflux. Further experiments showed that the crosstalk between LXR and TLR signaling is mediated by IRF3, independent of the MyD-88-mediated pathway [4] . A new study demonstrated that the enhanced TLR4 signaling downregulates ABCA1 expression in cultured WT VSMCs, which is mediated by IRAK1 [11] . The previous study showed that the TLR3 signaling pathway can be induced by NDV infection [6] . We also observed the increased TLR4 gene expression during NDV infection (data not shown), implying the activation of the TLR4 signaling pathway. Further investigations are necessary to determine whether or how NDV proteins affect LXRs or ABCA1 gene expression. Furthermore, the signaling pathways that are involved in the induction of LXRs and downstream gene expression are worth further exploration.",
