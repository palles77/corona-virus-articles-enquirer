T cells participate in both defense and disease progression following MHV infection. Expression of chemokine receptors on activated T cells is important in allowing these cells to traffic into and accumulate within the central nervous system (CNS) of MHV-infected mice. The present study evaluated the contributions of CCR5 to the activation and trafficking of virus-specific CD8 \u03e9 T cells into the MHV-infected CNS mice. Comparable numbers of virus-specific CD8 \u03e9 T cells derived from immunized CCR5 \u03e9/\u03e9 or CCR5 \u03ea/\u03ea mice were present within the CNS of MHV-infected RAG1 \u03ea/\u03ea mice following adoptive transfer, indicating that CCR5 is not required for trafficking of these cells into the CNS. RAG1 \u03ea/\u03ea recipients of CCR5 \u03ea/\u03ea -derived CD8 \u03e9 T cells exhibited a modest, yet significant (P \u0545 0.05), reduction in viral burden within the brain which correlated with increased CTL activity and IFN-\u2425 expression. Histological analysis of RAG1 \u03ea/\u03ea recipients of either CCR5 \u03e9/\u03e9 or CCR5 \u03ea/\u03ea -derived CD8 \u03e9 T cells revealed only focal areas of demyelination with no significant differences in white matter destruction. These data indicate that CCR5 signaling on CD8 \u03e9 T cells modulates antiviral activities but is not essential for entry into the CNS.",

            "text": "Mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) is a single-strand, positivesense RNA virus that is a member of the family Coronaviradae. Intracranial infection of susceptible mice with neurotropic strains of MHV reproducibly results in an acute encephalomyelitis followed by a chronic demyelinating disease similar in pathology to the human demyelinating disease multiple sclerosis (MS) (Houtman and Fleming, 1996; Lane and Buchmeier, 1997) . The acute stage of MHV infection is characterized by replication of virus in both neurons and glia and widespread distribution throughout the parenchyma. In contrast, during the chronic stage of disease, viral RNA and protein predominate within white matter tracts undergoing demyelination. The T cell response to MHV following infection of the CNS is crucial for optimal host defense and clearance of virus Marten et al., 2001; Williamson and Stohlman, 1990 ). In addition, T cells have been implicated as important effector cells in amplifying the severity of demyelination in MHVinfected mice (Houtman and Fleming, 1996; Liu et al., 2001a; Wu et al., 2000) . Therefore, understanding the mechanisms by which these cells traffic and accumulate within the central nervous system (CNS) following MHV infection is important with regard to understanding both host defense and disease progression.",

These observations suggest a role for these molecules in both host defense and disease by attracting targeted populations of leukocytes into the CNS. Indeed, a series of recent studies from our laboratory using both chemokine receptor knock-out mice as well as neutralizing antibodies to select chemokines have clearly demonstrated a nonredundant and important role for chemokines and chemokine receptors in participating in clearance of virus from the brain as well as demyelination (Chen et al., 2001; Glass et al., 2001; Lane et al., 2000; Liu et al., 2000 Liu et al., , 2001b . Given the important role for T cells and chemokine receptors in both host defense and disease development following MHV infection of the CNS, we have sought to better understand how these cells traffic into the CNS following viral infection. A recent report from our laboratory demonstrated that the CC chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5) is important for trafficking of virus-specific CD4 \u03e9 T cells into the CNS of MHV-infected mice (Glass and Lane, 2003) . Analysis of the chemokine receptor profile expressed by virus-specific CD4 \u03e9 T cells obtained from CCR5 \u03ea/\u03ea mice revealed reduced expression of various chemokine receptors, suggesting that CCR5 signaling regulates expression of additional chemokine receptors that participate in T cell trafficking and accumulation within the CNS of infected mice. To expand our understanding of how CCR5 regulates T cell activation and trafficking within the context of MHV infection of the CNS, CD8 \u03e9 T cells specific for the immunodominant epitope present within the spike (S) glycoprotein spanning amino acids 510-518 (S510-518) were generated from either CCR5 \u03e9/\u03e9 or CCR5 \u03ea/\u03ea mice and the antiviral and migration activities analyzed. The results presented indicate that CCR5 signaling imparts a downstream effect on IFN-\u2425 production and CTL activity but is not essential for trafficking into the CNS or the development of demyelination.",

Recipient mice were injected intravenously (iv) with a total of 2.5 \u03eb 10 6 cells, sacrificed 9 days posttransfer (12 days p.i.), and brains were collected to determine viral titers and infiltration of CD8 \u03e9 T cells into the CNS. Although neither recipient group of mice cleared virus, there was a twofold decrease (P \u0545 0.05) in the viral burden within the brains of mice that received CCR5 \u03ea/\u03eaderived CD8 \u03e9 T cells compared to CCR5 \u03e9/\u03e9 -derived CD8 \u03e9 T cells (Table 1) . Interestingly there were comparable numbers of S510-518-specific CD8 \u03e9 T cells present in the CNS of RAG1 \u03ea/\u03ea recipients, suggesting an enhanced antiviral activity by CCR5 \u03ea/\u03ea -derived CD8 \u03e9 T cells (Table  1) . The fact that similar numbers of S510-518-specific CD8 \u03e9 T cells from both CCR5 \u03e9/\u03e9 and CCR5 \u03ea/\u03ea mice were present within the brains of infected recipient mice indicated that CCR5 is not required for entry of these cells into the CNS. Chemokine receptor gene expression on S510-518-expanded CD8 \u03e9 T cells from CCR5 \u03e9/\u03e9 and CCR5 \u03ea/\u03ea mice was compared using semiquantitative RT-PCR analysis. As shown in Fig. 2 , a similar chemokine receptor gene profile is detected in antigen-expanded CD8 \u03e9 T cells from either CCR5 \u03e9/\u03e9 or CCR5 \u03ea/\u03ea mice. Transcripts for CCR1, CCR2, and CXCR3 are prominently expressed in both populations of cells, while CCR3 and CCR4 are not detected. We have previously demonstrated that CCR2 and CXCR3 signaling enhances T cell trafficking and accumulation within the CNS of MHV-infected mice (Chen et al., 2001; Liu et al., 2000 Liu et al., , 2001b . Therefore, it is likely that S510-518-specific CD8 \u03e9 T cells are able to utilize these receptors and gain access into the brains of mice.",

(2002) have reported increased expression of chemokine receptors CCR2 and CCR5 on CD8 \u03e9 T cells following infection with either lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) or vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV). Expression of these chemokine receptors by CD8 \u03e9 T cells was associated with the ability of these cells to migrate to areas of viral infection, suggesting a functional role following infection with either of these viruses. Fukada et al. (2002) report that CCR5 is expressed on both effector and memory CD8 \u03e9 T cells obtained from HIV-infected individuals. These cells were able to migrate in response to RANTES/CCL5, indicating a role in either host defense or immune-mediated pathogenesis by allowing these cells to traffic to areas of viral infection (Fukada et al., 2002) . Further support for CCR5 in contributing to CD8 \u03e9 T cell antiviral immunity comes from a report that demonstrated CTL clones expressed CCR5 and were able to migrate to areas of viral infection that contained the CCR5 ligands MIP-1\u2423/CCL3 and MIP-1\u2424/CCL4 following infusion into HIV-infected patients (Brodie et al., 2000) . Therefore, the accumulated data indicate that CCR5 is expressed on activated CD8 \u03e9 T cells following viral infection and the contributions of this receptor to either defense or disease appear to be dependent on the challenging virus.",

Expression of both RANTES/CCL5 and CCR5 is important in contributing to demyelination following MHV infection by allowing macrophages to traffic into the CNS and participate in white matter destruction (Glass et al., 2001; Lane et al., 2000) . CCR5 is also expressed on activated T cells following viral infection and we have recently determined that signaling through this receptor enhances MHV-specific CD4 \u03e9 T cell accumulation within the CNS presumably by responding to either RANTES/CCL5 or MIP-1\u2423/CCL3 (Glass and Lane, 2003) . The data presented in this article clearly indicate that CCR5 signaling is not required for CD8 \u03e9 T cells to traffic to and/or accumulate within the CNS following MHV infection. Consistent with our earlier studies (Glass et al., 2001) , there were decreased numbers of CD8 \u03e9 T cells present within the CNS of MHV-infected CCR5 \u03ea/\u03ea mice as compared to CCR5 \u03e9/\u03e9 mice at Day 7, and there are increased numbers of CD8 \u03e9 T cells at Day 12 p.i. This may be explained by an impaired ability to rapidly mount an adaptive immune response to virus during acute disease. However, at later stages of infection antigen-specific CD8 \u03e9 T cells are able to accumulate within the CNS. RAG1 \u03ea/\u03ea recipients of CCR5 \u03ea/\u03ea -derived S510-518-specific CD8 \u03e9 T cells displayed lower (P \u0545 0.05) viral titers in the brains compared to recipients of CD8 \u03e9 T cells obtained from CCR5 \u03e9/\u03e9 mice. These data are consistent with the demonstrated in vitro enhanced antiviral activities by CD8 \u03e9 T cells derived from CCR5 \u03ea/\u03ea mice. However, neither recipient group of mice was able to completely clear virus from the brain, which is consistent with recent reports that CD8 \u03e9 T cells alone are not sufficient for elimination of MHV from the CNS Stohlman et al., 1998) .",

However, the overall extent of demyelination in either recipient group was markedly reduced as compared to RAG1 \u03ea/\u03ea mice that received MHV-specific CD4 \u03e9 T cells, which further supports a more prominent role for this T cell subset in contributing to MHV-induced demyelination (Glass and Lane, 2003; Lane et al., 2000) . An interesting observation was the demonstration of an increased numbers of macrophages present within the CNS of RAG1 \u03ea/\u03ea recipients of CCR5 \u03ea/\u03ea -derived CD8 \u03e9 T cells as compared to recipients of CCR5 \u03e9/\u03e9 -derived CD8 \u03e9 T cells. The underlying reasons for increased macrophage accumulation but only limited demyelination within the CNS of these mice are not entirely clear but may relate to altered expression of additional cytokines and/or chemokines that are necessary for macrophage activation and myelin destruction to occur.",

            "text": "In summary, these data highlight the nonredundant nature of chemokine receptor signaling as it relates to T cell activation and trafficking in response to MHV infection of the CNS. CCR5 signaling does not regulate IFN-\u2425 expression by virus-specific CD4 \u03e9 T cells but it is important for trafficking of these cells into the CNS of infected mice (Glass and Lane, 2003) . In marked contrast, CCR5 regulates both IFN-\u2425 and CTL activity by virus-specific CD8 \u03e9 T cells, which correlates with both in vitro and in vivo antiviral activities. However, CCR5 signaling is not required for CD8 \u03e9 T cell migration and infiltration into the CNS. Collectively, these data provide evidence that CCR5 signaling differentially regulates CD4 \u03e9 and CD8 \u03e9 T cell functional activities following viral infection. This is important when considering strategies for targeting this receptor in the treatment of human diseases.",

Control (sham) animals were injected with 30 L sterile saline alone. Animals were sacrificed at defined time points and brains and spinal cords were removed for analysis in studies described. One-half of each brain at each time point was used for plaque assay on the DBT astrocytoma cell line to determine viral burden (Hirano et al., 1978; Lane et al., 1998) . The remaining halves were either used for histological analysis, stored at \u03ea80\u00b0C for RNA isolation, or used for FACS analysis.",

Intracellular cytokine staining for IFN-\u2425 was performed to determine the frequency of S510-518-specific CD8 \u03e9 T cells present in the brains of mice at Days 7 and 12 p.i. The average frequency of total and S510-518-specific CD8 \u03e9 T cells are indicated in the bottom and top right panels, respectively. (B) Total numbers of S510-518-specific CD8 \u03e9 T cells as determined by intracellular cytokine staining for IFN-\u2425. (C) Total numbers of CD8 \u03e9 T cells present within the brains of CCR5 \u03e9/\u03e9 and CCR5 \u03ea/\u03ea at 7 and 12 days p.i. as determined by flow cytometry. Data presented in (A) are a representative plot of five individual mice per group at Day 7 and three individual mice per group at Day 12. Data in (B) and (C) are presented as average \u03ee SEM and represent two separate experiments with a total of five mice in each group at Day 7 p.i. and three mice in each group at Day 12 p.i. *P \u0545 0.05 when compared to CCR5 \u03e9/\u03e9 mice.",
