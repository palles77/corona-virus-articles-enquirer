To investigate whether leukocytes could participate in respiratory pathologies and serve as vector for viral spread towards other tissues, the susceptibility of human leukocytic cell lines and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) to HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 infection was investigated. Human primary monocytes/macrophages were susceptible to HCoV-229E infection, but strongly restricted HCoV-OC43 replication. Moreover, productive HCoV-229E infection of primary monocytes and of the THP-1 monocytic cell line led to their activation, as indicated by the production of pro-inflammatory mediators, including TNF-\u2423, CCL5, CXCL10 and CXCL11 and MMP-9. Moreover, an in vitro chemotaxis assay showed that motility towards chemokines of THP-1 cells and primary monocytes was increased following an acute or persistent HCoV-229E infection. Taken together, these results suggest that infected monocytes could serve as a reservoir for HCoV-229E, become activated, participate in the exacerbation of pulmonary pathologies, as well as serve as potential vectors for viral dissemination to host tissues, where it could be associated with other pathologies.",

Indeed, as previously suggested for HCMV (Smith et al., 2004) , blood-borne monocytes and their differentiated counterparts, macrophages, could be involved in hematogenous dissemination of HCoV-229E to host tissues, including the CNS, as we previously showed this virus to be neuroinvasive (Arbour et al., 2000) . In these examples of viral spread, pro-inflammatory molecules, such as cytokines, matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) and chemokines and their receptors, were shown to play a crucial role in leukocyte activation and their dissemination from blood to various tissue.",

We show that human monocytic cells were susceptible to infection and that cell death was induced in a portion of the cells, in correlation with the initial MOI for the 229E strain. The THP-1 cell line presented a pattern of infection very similar to that of primary monocytes. Both cell types were activated following infection, as shown by the production of pro-inflammatory mediators. Moreover, infection by HCoV-229E increased cell motility and chemokine-driven cell migration. Furthermore, the establishment of a persistent infection in monocytes/macrophages is consistent with the possibility that these cells serve as a reservoir and potential vector for virus dissemination to host tissue.",

Undifferentiated non-adherent monocytic THP-1 cells (1.5 \u00d7 10 6 cells in each well of a 6-well plate) were differentiated by incubating the cultures for 48 h with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) (Sigma) at a final concentration of 100 nM.

Even though primary macrophages may be kept in culture for a long period of time, primary monocytes are very difficult to keep in culture for more than a few days. Therefore, primary cultures of monocytes did not survive long enough to characterize the establishment of a long-term infection. The THP-1 cells allowed us to investigate this possibility. When HCoV-229E infection of both primary monocytes and THP-1 cells was performed at a MOI of 0.1, the kinetics of infection was similar, as shown by infectious virus production ( Fig. 2A) and detection of viral antigens (Fig. 3A) . A long-term HCoV-229E infection of THP-1 cells was established for at least 10 cell passages, over a 2-month period. Indeed, a carrier-state type of persistent infection was observed: only a small proportion (1-2%) of the culture appeared to produce viral antigens, yielding a low infectious virus titer (Fig. 3B) .",

While pro-MMP-9 appeared to be constitutively expressed in the THP-1 cell line and primary monocytes, an increased expression was observed after 72 hpi with HCoV-229E, when compared to mock-infected cells (Fig. 5B) . PMA was used as a positive control (data not shown). Even though PMA induced an increase in the expression of pro-MMP-2 and MMP-9 in THP-1 cells, no modulation of MMP-2 was detected upon infection of either cell type (data not shown).

However, in our study, only viral RNA was detected (data not shown). This could be explained by virus attachment to cell surface lectin-like molecules, as shown for SARS-CoV and other enveloped viruses such as HIV, Dengue and hepatitis C virus (Altmeyer, 2004) . Alternatively, it may be related to the differentiation state of monocytes and its correlation with susceptibility to HCoV-OC43 infection. Indeed, promonocytic THP-1 cells, which were susceptible to a weak productive HCoV-OC43 infection, represent less differentiated cells than primary monocytes/macrophages. Upon PMA-induced differentiation, they lost susceptibility to infection, which is consistent with monocytes being only susceptible to infection during a brief period during their differentiation. This was also suggested for HIV-1 (Schuitemaker et al., 1992; Pauza et al., 1988) , HCMV (Weinshenker et al., 1988) and measles virus (Helin et al., 1999) .",

Our results with primary monocyte-derived human macrophages not only confirm susceptibility to HCoV-229E, but demonstrate their production and release of small amounts of infectious virus into the culture medium. Moreover, detection of HCoV-229E antigens up to 5 dpi (data not shown) suggests that virions still remain in cells for a while even after a short burst of infectious virus produc- Fig. 6 . THP-1 cell and primary monocyte motility and chemokine-driven migration are increased after HCoV-229E infection. Infections were performed at a MOI of 0.1. (A) Chemotaxis assay showed that HCoV-229E infection of THP-1 cells by itself induced a significant increase in cell motility and migration across Transwell inserts. CCL5 and CXCL12-driven migration was also significantly increased following infection but CCL2-driven migration was only significantly modified at 24 hpi and in persistently infected cells. (B) A comparative chemotaxis assay showed that both THP-1 cell and primary human monocyte motility and chemokine-driven migration across Transwell inserts was significantly increased. CCL5-driven migration was already significantly increased at 24 hpi and remained at that level until 48 hpi and CXCL12-driven migration was significantly increased at 48 hpi. CCL2-driven migration was only significantly increased at 24 hpi for the THP-1 cells but not significantly modified for primary monocytes. (C) A representative field of THP-1 cells and primary monocytes that have migrated across Transwell inserts and were allowed to adhere to poly-d-lysine-coated glass slides. Detection of HCoV-229E S protein (green cells with white arrows) was performed using the Mab 5-11H.6. Cell nuclei were stained with DAPI (blue). Results are representative of three independent experiments. Mock-infected THP-1 cells (THP-mock) at 24, 48 hpi and at 60 dpi (persist: persistently infected kept in culture for 2 months, representing 10 passages) were compared to HCoV-229E-infected THP-1 cells (THP-229E-0.1) at 24, 48 hpi and 60 dpi and mock-infected primary monocytes (PrimaryMono-mock) at 24 and 48 hpi were compared to HCoV-229E-infected primary monocytes (PrimaryMono-229E-0.1) at 24 and 48 hpi. The levels of statistical significance between mock-and HCoV-infected cells were evaluated for each condition. The p values were calculated by a t-test and are represented by * where the difference between mock and infected cells was significant. *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001. tion. Kinetics of monocyte infection (Fig. 1A) suggests that it is productive, as previously reported (Collins, 2002) . However, in contrast to the latter report, our results show a transient productive infection, with titers starting to drop between 24 and 48 hpi when an initial MOI of 1 is used. We also show that infection led to cell death in a portion of the cell culture in a MOI-dependent manner (Fig. 1C) , which may involve apoptosis (Collins, 2002) .",

A weakly productive long-term HCoV-229E infection of THP-1 cells at lower initial MOI was also previously reported for HIV-1 (Mikovits et al., 1990) and cells remained responsive to PMA-induced differentiation into macrophagelike cells and produced more infectious virus (Konopka et al., 1993) . Moreover, even though monocytes have a life span of only a few days in circulation (Cline et al., 1978) , a long-term infection in THP-1 monocytic cells is highly relevant, since during their migration towards tissue, monocytes differentiate into macrophages, which are long-lived cells that can harbor virus for a long period of time. Persistently infected THP-1 cells had an increased motility and were still responsive to chemokines (Fig. 6A) , which strongly suggests that monocytes/macrophages could be a reservoir and potential vector for HCoV-229E spread into host tissue, as suggested for HCMV (S\u00f6derberg-Naucler et al., 1994; Sinclair and Sisson, 1996) . Moreover, we show that HCoV-229E infection of THP-1 cells and primary monocytes leads to their activation, as indicated by the production of several inflammation-related mediators and responsiveness to chemokine gradients.",

However, the increase in IL-16 was not seen in primary monocytes, as these cells produced it constitutively (Fig. 4) . Others have reported a faint increase in CXCL8 production and no production of TNF-\u2423 following HCoV-229E infection of THP-1 cells (Yen et al., 2006) . This apparent discrepancy may be due to their use of THP-1 cells manipulated to overexpress DC-SIGN, which could have altered their capacity to produce TNF-\u2423, or to the fact that they measured TNF-\u2423 production at 1 dpi, whereas we analyzed its production over a 3-day period. The same may apply to the apparent discrepancy in the production of CXCL8 in HCoV-229E infected THP-1 cells (Yen et al., 2006) . Constitutive production of high levels of cytokines/chemokines by primary monocytes (Fig. 4) is not surprising: for instance CXCL8, IL-1\u2424, IL-6 and TNF-\u2423 were shown to be constitutively produced by human monocytes (Naldini et al., 2006) .",

The increased production of CCL5 in HCoV-229E-infected cells is also of interest as this chemokine has a chemoattracting potential for memory and activated T cells (Schall et al., 1990) , NK cells (Loetscher et al., 1996) , dendritic cells (Lin et al., 1998) , and monocytes (Fine et al., 2001) . Therefore, migration of HCoV-229E-infected monocytes into the respiratory tract could lead to recruitment of additional immune cells that may eventually cause an uncontrolled upregulation of inflammatory molecules, as is the case in ARDS. Indeed, an increased level of expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) was seen in patients with ARDS (Corbel et al., 2002) , an interesting observation considering that HCoV-229E was associated with severe respiratory distress syndrome in newborns (Gagneur et al., 2002) . Moreover, it was recently shown that the in vitro recruitment of human peripheral blood leukocytes exposed to supernatants of SARS-CoV and HCoV-229E-infected THP-1 DC-SIGN cells (Yen et al., 2006) was significantly higher compared to supernatant from uninfected cells.",

A release of cytokines, such as TNF-\u2423, during infection may also be involved in the upregulation of MMP in monocytes/macrophages (Welgus et al., 1992) . The significant induction of TNF-\u2423 production by monocytes after HCoV-229E infection (Fig. 5A) suggests a synergistic effect between MMP-9 and TNF-\u2423 to facilitate the migration of monocytes into tissues, including the CNS. The MMP-9 production of monocytes was enhanced in the presence of chemokines such as CCL5 and CXCL12 (Webster and Crowe, 2006) . A role for neutrophilderived MMP-9 (Zhou et al., 2002) was also suggested in the breakdown and integrity loss of the BBB (Zhou et al., 2003) during MHV infection of the CNS.",

The production of CCL5 appear more important than that of CCL2 in facilitating migration of HCoV-229E infected cells towards tissue, since the increased migratory capacities of infected cells were more evident towards CCL5 (Fig. 6) . The increased responsiveness to CXCL12 (Fig. 6) is also very interesting since this chemokine is constitutively produced in tissues such as the CNS (Cartier et al., 2005) .

Either type of monocytes may propagate a viral infection (Reuter et al., 2004) .

This could have important consequences on the development of more serious respiratory tract diseases and even in the capacity of the virus to invade other tissues. Even though HCoV-229E is a respiratory pathogen, our previous studies did demonstrate that it has neuroinvasive properties. Since monocytes have access to CNS, our observation that monocytes/macrophages support coronavirus replication is consistent with the possibility that monocytes may contribute to HCoV-229E spread to the CNS. Moreover, the long-term infection of the THP-1 monocytic cell line strongly suggests the possibility of a viral reservoir within monocyte subsets and is consistent with human monocytes harboring HCoV and participating in virus spread towards tissue in general and particularly the CNS.",
