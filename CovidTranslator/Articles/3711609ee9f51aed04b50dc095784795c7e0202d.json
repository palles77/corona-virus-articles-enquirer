The antiviral and cytotoxic activities of all compounds have been tested. Results of broad antiviral evaluation showed that none of the compounds evaluated endowed with anti-DNA or -RNA virus activity at subtoxic concentrations except for the palladium complex 1b. This compound exhibited slightly selective inhibition against cytomegalovirus. The platinum complex 4a exhibited the best cytostatic activities against human cervix carcinoma. Ligands 2, 4 and 5 showed cytostatic potential. The palladium complexes were in general less cytostatic than the corresponding platinum complexes or unliganded congeners.",

In recent years new metal complexes have been identified as a very promising class of anticancer active compounds [6e8] . Metals bound to atoms such as N, O and S can form a chelate ring that binds the metal more tightly when compared to the nonchelate form. Large biological molecules (proteins, enzymes, DNA etc.) are electron-rich but metal ions are electron-deficient. Therefore, interactions occur between metal ions and many important biological molecules. This event has led to the use of metals or metalcontaining agents to modulate biological systems [9] . Organometallic compounds have gained importance as enzyme inhibitors due to the capability of binding large biological molecules more strongly than metal-free organic compounds [10] .",

The other property of metals is to catalyze the formation of reactive oxygen species [11] . The anticancer potential of metal containing agents, from main group elements to early transition metals, have been evaluated [12e14] . Especially organoplatinum compounds such as cisplatin, carboplatin and oxaliplatin are metal-based drugs that are among the most active and widely used clinical drugs in cancer chemotherapy [15e17] . These platinum complexes react in vivo, binding to and causing crosslinking of DNA which finally activates programmed cell death [18] . However, the clinical utility of these drugs is limited to a relatively narrow range of tumors (sarcomas, small cell lung cancer, ovarian cancer, lymphomas and germ cell tumors) because of primary resistance and the development of resistance secondary to the initial treatment [19, 20] . Therefore, unconventional platinum complexes, that could be used in cisplatin-resistant tumors are made by different research groups [21e24] .",

An intense band at ca. 433e344 nm is attributed to the n / p * transitions of C]S group, C]N group and thiophene ring, which are overlapped. The p / p * transitions of the thiophene ring and thiosemicarbazone imine function are rather weak, and observed at ca. 281e258 nm. These two bands are shifted to lower energies (bathochromic shift) after complexation (467e371 nm, 344e264 nm).

The thiosemicarbazones can exhibit thione-thiol tautomerism in solution because of the thioamide (NHeC]S) function. The n(SH) band at ca. The 2500e2600 cm \u00c01 region is absent from the IR spectra of the ligands but the v(NH) band at 3115e3140 cm \u00c01 and the strong band due to v(C]S) at 783e825 cm \u00c01 are present, suggesting that in the solid phase the thiosemicarbazones remain as the thione form [45] . These bands are shifted to lower wavenumbers (13e66 cm \u00c01 ) indicating the coordination of metal through thione/thiol sulfur in all complexes. This coordination is approved by the presence of two new bands at the 502e521 and 400e418 cm \u00c01 region due to v(PteN, PdeN and PteS, PdeS), respectively [46] . The band due to v(CeSeC) of the thiophene ring remains unaltered in complexes (1ae5a and 1be5b), indicating non-participation of the thiophene ring in coordination. The azomethine stretching vibrations n(C]N), characteristic of a Schiff base are observed at 1582e1595 cm \u00c01 [7] . The negative shift (30e78 cm \u00c01 ) of the C]N band was observed in all complexes which exhibit the involvement of azomethine nitrogen upon complexation. On the other hand, the shift to higher wavenumbers of the v(NeN) band, observed for the platinum and palladium complexes, have also been related to the electronic delocalization and occurred as a consequence of coordination through the azomethine nitrogen atom and deprotonation of thiosemicarbazones [47] . Finally, the ligands 1e5 coordinate to platinum(II) and palladium(II) as NS bidentate.",

Confluent cell cultures (or nearly confluent for MDCK cells) in microtiter 96-well plates were inoculated with 100 CCID 50 of virus (1 CCID 50 being the virus dose to infect 50% of the cell cultures) in the presence of varying concentrations (100, 20, 4, . mM) of the test compounds. Viral cytopathicity was recorded as soon as it reached completion in the control virus-infected cell cultures that were not treated with the test compounds. The minimal cytotoxic concentration (MCC) of the compounds was defined as the compound concentration that caused a microscopically visible alteration of cell morphology. The inhibitory concentration-50 (IC 50 ) was defined as the compound concentration required to inhibit cell proliferation by 50%. The methodology of the anti-HIV assays was as follows: human CEM (w3 \u00c2 10 5 cells/cm 3 ) cells were infected with 100 CCID 50 of HIV(III B ) or HIV-2(ROD)/ml and seeded in 200 mL wells of a microtiter plate containing appropriate dilutions of the test compounds. After 4 days of incubation at 37 C, HIV-induced CEM giant cell formation was examined microscopically. Antiviral activity was expressed as the concentration required to reduce virus-induced cytopathogenicity by 50% (EC 50 ).",

Furthermore, the ligands 2, 4 and 5 showed moderately cytostatic activity against in cell cultures (IC 50 : 7.1e57.8 mM for compound 2, IC 50 : 3.6e52.1 mM for compound 4 and IC 50 : 2.4->100 mM for compound 5).
