Preparative columns with different packing sizes were investigated to isolate the three compounds from the extracts of licorice. The 12 \u03bcm chromatographic column showed better separation for the three compounds from licorice. 0.29 mg/g for liquiritin, 1.43 mg/g for glycyrrhizic acid, and 0.07 mg/g for glabridin were obtained and the recoveries were 80.8, 89.7, and 72.5%, respectively. \u00a9 KSBB",

In the first step, 1 g of licorice powder was mixed with 70 mL of methanol for 120 min and the powder was subsequently separated from the solvent and oven-dried again. The following steps were identical to the first but new 70 mL methanol was used. From Table 2 , it is seen that extracted amounts of LQ and GA were extremely low in the second step, and in the third step there was no extraction from the licorice powder.

When the injection volume was 200 \u03bcL, the compounds could still be detected in the 12 \u03bcm column except for glabridin. As the particle size became larger, the column efficiency and resolution deteriorated, because of the smaller contact area of the sample with the surface of the solid packings and due to larger diffusivity and longer flow paths. Hence, from the results, it was determine that a particle size of 12 \u03bcm can be used in the preparative column.",

The analyte peak area values were plotted against the corresponding concentrations of the analytes and the calibration curves were constructed by means of the least-square method. Calibration curves of the three compounds showed good linearity (r 2 > 0.998); the regression equations of LQ, GA, and glabridin were Y = 11,531x \u2212 23.942 (x from 0.01 to 0.1 mg/mL), Y = 9,721.7x + 97.429 (x from 0. 1 to 1.0 mg/mL), and Y = 10,730x \u2212 31.147 (x from 0.01 to 0.1 mg/mL), respectively.",
