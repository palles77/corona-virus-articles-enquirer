Animals were subjected to heterologous prime-boost using vectors from human serotype 5 and chimpanzee derived adenoviruses (human AdHu5 and chimpanzee AdC7) expressing spike protein followed by intranasal challenge with SARS-CoV. Vaccination led to a substantial reduction in viral load and prevented the severe pneumonia seen in unvaccinated animals. The same prime-boost strategy was effective in rhesus macaques in eliciting SARS-CoV specific immune responses. These data indicate that a heterologous adenovirus-based prime-boost vaccine strategy could safely stimulate strong immunity that may be needed for complete protection against SARS-CoV infection.",

The virus emerged as a highly aggressive pathogen in the adult and aged human population as a result of animal-to-human transmission followed by a high rate of human-to-human transmission. The most recent data suggest that bats may be an animal reservoir for the SARS-CoV [1, 2] . SARS-CoV replicates in the cytoplasm of host cells; it contains a single-stranded plus-sense RNA genome which is about 30 Kb in length. The major viral proteins include spike (S), membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins [3] . The main clinical symptoms of SARS-CoV infection are those of severe respiratory illness although SARS-CoV also causes infection of other organs such as the gastrointestinal and urinary tracts. Infected individuals who die within 10 days of the onset of symptoms show diffuse alveolar damage with a mixed alveolar infiltrate, lung edema and hyaline membrane formation [4] . Several inflammatory cytokines (IL-1\u2424, IL-6 and IL-12) and chemokines such as MCP-1 and IP-10 were found to be elevated in infected individuals [5] .",

Intrapulmonary administration of SARS-CoV to immune competent rodents results in infection and some replication although the virus is rapidly cleared and there is little pathology other then mild bronchiolitis [7] . The outcome is substantially different if the animal has defects in host responses such as STAT-1 deficiency where animals develop a progressive infection with severe lung pathology and wide dissemination of the virus [8] . The initial study of SARS-CoV infection in cynomolgus macaques indicated the animals develop a clinical syndrome and lung histopathology similar to what is observed in SARS [9] . Subsequent SARS-CoV infection studies in cynomolgus and rhesus macaques and African green monkeys by two different groups failed to demonstrate significant clinical sequelae and only limited replication of the virus [10, 11] . An initial report on ferrets exposed to SARS-CoV described animal-to-animal transmission and the development of a lethal syndrome not associated with lung pathology [12] . Subsequent work by this group with the ferret model did show replication of SARS-CoV in the lung and pneumonia [13] .",

Killed SARS-CoV, pseudo particles and protein subunit vaccines containing S have produced NABs to SARS-CoV in mouse models which inhibit virus replication in vitro [14, 15] . In fact, a clinical trial of inactivated SARS-CoV is underway in China (http://www.sfda.gov.cn/ cmsweb/webportal/W4291/A43486324.html?searchword= %28SARS%D2%DF+AND+%C3%E7%29,http://www. sfda.gov.cn/cmsweb/webportal/W945325/A32017542.html? searchword=%28SARS%D2%DF+AND+%C3%E7%29). A variety of genetic vaccines expressing various SARS-CoV open reading frames such as S and N have also been tested in mice and have shown production of SARS-CoV NAB and CD8 + T cells and protection in terms of diminishing virus replication in vivo. A human adenovirus vector expressing SARS-CoV antigens was shown to be immunogenic in macaques [16] . In a previous study, we evaluated a number of adenovirus constructs for immunogenicity in mice [17] . These experiments identified two adenovirus vectors capable of eliciting high T cell responses to the S protein of SARS-CoV following intramuscular injection into two different strains of mice. The first vector expresses a codon optimized S open reading frame (i.e., nS) from a CMV promoter in an E1 and E3 deleted genome of human serotype 5 adenovirus (AdHu5). The second vector expresses the same S open reading frame from an optimized chicken \u2424-actin promoter/CMV enhancer in an E1 and E3 deleted genome from the chimpanzee adenovirus AdC7. These two vectors are serologically distinct from one another. An additional advantage of the chimpanzee vector is that pre-existing immunity in humans to natural adenovirus infections should not diminish its efficacy [18, 19] . In this study, we utilize the vaccine platform based on adenoviruses isolated from chimpanzees to develop and evaluate a vaccine for SARS-CoV using the ferret model.",

The PCR fragment was cloned in Topo (InVitrogene, CA) and characterized by sequencing at SeqWright (SeqWright, TX), and was found to be 100% identical to the published sequence [3] . For codon optimization of S cDNA, the cloned Tor2 S gene was used as a template and amplified with overlapping oligonucleotides in which human codon usage were introduced. Resulting overlapping PCR fragments were fused and a full-length codon optimized S cDNA (nS) was created. Plasmid molecular clones AdHu5-CMVnS (AdHu5-nS) and AdC7-CAG2nS (AdC7-nS) vectors were created through a direct cloning of nS insert and greenwhite selection procedure as described elsewhere [20, 21] . The chicken \u2424-actin/CMV hybrid promoter CAG2 used to drive the expression of nS from AdC7 was created by deleting a 955 bp Apa I/Afl II fragment from the original CAGGS promoter [22] . For production of replication-defective AdHu5and AdC7-nS viral vectors, respective DNA was transfected into 293 cells for virus rescue. The rescued vectors were expanded to large-scale infections in 293 cells and purified by the standard CsCl gradient sedimentation method. CsCl was removed by desalting using Bio-Gel P-6DG equilibrated with phosphate buffer saline (PBS). Virus preparations were suspended in PBS with 10% glycerol and kept at \u221280 \u2022 C. Genome structures of the vectors were confirmed by restriction analysis (Age I plus BsrGI for AdHu5-nS and Age I plus AflIII for AdC7-nS) and visual inspection on agarose gels stained with ethidium bromide. Infectivity of the viral vectors was determined by the standard plaque assay on 293 cells and levels of replication competent adenovirus (RCA) contaminants in the vector preparations were inspected as described previously [23] . All viral vector preparations were characterized for the concentration of physical particles (measuring viral DNA particle concentrations spectrophotometerically at 260 nm), the concentration of infectious virus (RCA), genome integrity (enzymatic restriction, see above), and absence of endotoxin using the Limulus Amebocyte Lysate (LAL) gel-clot method (QCL-1000, Bio Whittaker, MD).",

A number of human respiratory pathogens such as influenza have been effectively modeled in the ferret, which has been used to evaluate efficacy of therapeutics and vaccines [28] . In order to develop a model of SARS useful for evaluating the efficacy of adenovirus vaccines, we infected ferrets with SARS-CoV of the Tor2 strain via intranasal administration. Following infection, the animals were monitored for clinical signs of disease and evidence of viral replication and pathology. Pilot studies in which animals were followed for 2 months after infection demonstrated the development of a severe respiratory illness with the highest levels of circulating virus after 2 days and the peak of pathology occurring 5 days after infection. Most animals survived SARS-CoV infection after a long recovery period although the disease can be lethal in rare occasions (manuscript in preparation). Based on these studies, groups of three ferrets were immunized intramuscularly with 5 \u00d7 10 11 genomes/kg of the control or adenovirus-based vaccines and evaluated for vaccine efficacy 2 and 5 days after challenge. The specific studies included: (1) daily observations for signs of illness, (2) harvest of rectal swabs and nasal washes for analysis of infectious virus and viral genomes on days 1, 2 and 5 and (3) necropsy of animals on days 2 and 5 and analysis of tissues for viral load, pathology and expression of SARS-CoV antigens. The a Mean activity score represent the group average of daily activity scores for each ferret (score: 0, normal; 1, alert but playful only when stimulated; 2, alert but not playful when stimulated; 3, neither alert nor playful when stimulated; the scoring system is based on that described by Reuman et al.

Six ferrets per group were evaluated at days 1, 2 and 3 ferrets per group at days 3-5.",

Macaques were followed for the development of NAB to SARS-CoV in blood and activation of SARS-CoV specific \u2425-IFN expressing T cells from PBMCs. Animals were injected IM with 1 \u00d7 10 10 particles of AdHu5-nS and 13 weeks later injected with 1 \u00d7 10 12 particles of AdC7-nS. Following the prime, all four animals generated levels of NAB to SARS-CoV ranging from 10 to 80 (reciprocal dilutions; Fig. 6A ). T cells specific for SARS-CoV S and expressing IFN-\u2425 were measured using the ELISPOT assay with peptides spanning the entire S open reading frame (15 mers with 10 amino acid overlaps) pooled into five independent mixtures. Detectable T cell responses were obtained in all monkeys with the peak for any peptide pool occurring around week 5 at frequencies ranging from 1000 to 4800 spots/million cells (Fig. 6B ). ELISPOT assay was performed for each time point for three of the animals-the data for the fourth animal are similar but less time points were recorded and thus this animal was omitted from Fig. 6B . All animals showed responses to multiple pools, the relative activity of which varied between the different animals. Levels of NABs significantly increased in all animals by 20-fold in average following the AdC7-nS boost (p < 0.01) followed by a gradual decline to levels around 160 \u00b1 80. The heterologous boost also increased IFN-\u2425 expressing T cell frequencies 2-3-fold relative to the peak following the prime and responses were observed within the same peptide pools as observed during the prime in all four animals. The peak of the T cell response was observed around 3 weeks following the boost. Selected samples of peripheral blood mononuclear cells harvested following the boost were also evaluated for antigen specific T cell responses using the intracellular cytokine staining assay which can fractionate the antigen specific T cells into different subsets based on cell surface markers. This analysis showed that the cellular response was primarily CD8 + T cells and was directed against multiple epitopes. For each animal, CD8 + T cell responses were detected to two or three of the five different peptide pools. A summary of the relevant data are shown in Table 2 and an example of one of the assays is shown in Fig. 6C . The T and B cell responses have persisted for 29-38 weeks, respectively, which is the longest time point followed.",

Many of these approaches have indeed elicited antibodies that neutralize SARS-CoV in vitro and activated T cells against SARS-CoV epitopes. Whether any of these would provide protection against a SARS-CoV infection is unclear because correlates of protection have not been defined. Our approach was to utilize a vaccine strategy based on recombinant adenoviruses that has been shown in other systems to activate T cells against a broad range of SARS-CoV epitopes and activate B cells to secrete high levels of NABs [18, 19] . Two animal models were evaluated to assess the efficacy of the adenovirus-based vaccine. Primary evaluation was per-formed in ferrets which in our experience represented the most susceptible and reliable animal model to SARS-CoV infection with high virus replication and marked clinical and pathologic sequelae. This model does have limitations such as the absence of reagents to measure T cell responses and potential differences in the biology of the adenovirus platform as compared to primates. Selected immunological studies were therefore performed in rhesus macaques to assess the ability of the adenovirus platform to elicit SARS-CoV specific T cell responses and NABs production although protection to challenge cannot be adequately modeled in rhesus.",

Both adenovirus vectors, injected individually, substantially diminished viral loads in lung and nasal washes although the effects on lung pathology, which we believe to be the most important end point, were modest (Figs. 2-4) . Heterologous adenovirus prime-boost did further increase NAB production by 10-fold and importantly almost completely prevented lung pathology. It is interesting that we could not differentiate a single adenovirus vaccine administration versus the prime-boost strategy based on viral loads in the lungs at day 5 which in all vaccinated groups were diminished to almost baseline levels (Fig. 2) . Important clinical efficacy was noted only in the group receiving the prime-boost immunization regiment suggesting that clinical outcome is mainly determined early after exposure to SARS-CoV and may be independent of viral load later on. These data suggest that a certain threshold of NAB together with the possible contribution of virus specific T cells may be necessary for clinically meaningful protection. It is interesting to note that the heterologous boost did not increase the SIs over that achieved for the prime (Fig. 5) . This may reflect no real increase in T cell activation. Alternatively this may be a problem of capturing the peak level of T cell activation, which will have different kinetics after the prime and the boost. It is also possible that the level of T cell activation in the prime-boost group was so high that the in vitro stimulation induced apoptosis of antigen specific T cells.",

Animals in the present study were carefully scrutinized for similar pathology in the liver by histological analysis. There was no statistical difference between S vaccinated groups and untreated ferrets (data not shown). A number of reasons may explain the absence of vaccineinduced liver toxicity observed with adenovirus vaccine vectors. One is that our vaccine approach did achieve substantial control of virus replication which was not the case with the MVA vaccine. It is possible that a sub-therapeutic vaccine response in term of SARS-CoV NAB and T cells may lead to induced pathologies by generating enhancing antibodies without sufficient levels of protective T cells and NAB.",

The level of NAB detected in rhesus after the boost was similar or exceeded that which provided protection in the ferret model (compare Figs. 5A and 6A ). It is difficult to compare the CD8 + T cell responses between ferrets and rhesus macaques because of the absence of reagents for the ferrets. However, the CD8 + T cell frequencies to S observed in NHPs were as high as we have seen in our other vaccine projects involving Ebola and HIV and they remained relatively stable.
