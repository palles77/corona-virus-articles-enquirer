            "text": "The simple manipulations required to separate free antibody or antigen from immune complexes immobilized non-covalently on plastic solid phase is probably the most important reason for the rapid increase in popularity of EIA. Desired traits of the solid phase are: (i) high capacity for binding immunoreactants (high surface/ volume ratio); (ii) possibility of immobilization of many different immunoreactants; (iii) minimal dissociation; (iv) negligible denaturation of immobilized molecule; and (v) orientation of immobilized antibody with binding sites towards the solution and the Fc to the solid phase (e.g., Section 13.2.2). Plastic is by far the most popular solid phase, since it makes the procedures extremely simple. However, plastics may also have some important limitatons: (i) they are immunoreactant-consumptive, i.e. often require 10 times more reactants than particulate solid phases or membranes; (ii) the avidity of immobilized antibodies for large antigens decreases by 1-2 orders of magnitude (Zwolinski, G.; Josephson, L.; cited by Parsons, 1981) , probably due to the wide spacing of epitopes or paratopes; (iii) the rate of antibody-antigen interactions is slower than in solution or with particulate solid phases (hours instead oi minutes), due to the necessity of the free immunoreactant to diffuse to the solid phase (association kinetics is largely dictated by diffusion rate; Section 8.4); and, (iv) few suitable antibod-ies will be bound to plastic due to its low adsorption capacity per unit area, particularly if the fraction of high-avidity IgG is low. Nevertheless, plastic has proven extremely useful for EIA.",

However, up to 68% of non-covalently adsorbed antigen may be desorbed during the test (Engvall et al., 1971; Hermann et al., 1979; Lehtonen and Viljanen, 1980b) . This desorption is strongly influenced by the serum used (Dobbins Place and Schroeder, 1982) . If no proper care is taken, a whole spectrum of binding, ranging from very tight to rather loose will be obtained. In each step, some of the loosely bound antigen detaches and competes for the immunoreactant added, leading to decreased detectability and increased variation. Two simple measures can be taken to minimize this problem: (i) to use the immunoreactant for immobilization at the appropriate concentration; and, (ii) to wash extensively after immobilization and after every subsequent step (Christensen et al., 1978; Lehtonen and Viljanen, 1980b) . As many as 6 washes may be necessary instead of the usual 2 or 3 advocated in standard procedures for the complete removal of loosely bound immunoreactants. Though covalent linkage improves binding (Hendry and Hermann, 1980; Suter, 1982) , this is not always accompanied by a similar increase in detectability.",

Protein adsorption to plastic surfaces is generally attributed to non-specific hydrophobic interactions and is independent of the net charge of the protein, although binding is different and characteristic for each protein (Cantarero et al., 1980) . The unique adsorptive behavior of each protein to polystyrene is independent of its p1, charge and molecular weight. Partial denaturation of IgG increases its adsorption, presumably due to an increase in hydrophobicity which, compared to native IgG, increases its detectability in EIA about 5 times (Ishikawa et al., 1980; Conradie et al., 1983 ).",

Early studies of Oreskes and Singer (1961) on the interaction of human IgG with polystyrene indicated that adsorption occurred in two steps, characterized by different binding constants, cor-responding to protein-plastic and protein-protein interaction. Maximum adsorption was observed at the p l of the proteins probably since the electrostatic repulsion between proteins is the lowest at this pH. Undesired multiple layers are also most difficult to remove at pH values near the p l (MacRitchie, 1972) .

Irrespective of the origin of the plates, the coefficient of variation of absorbance can range from 5% for the wells of one plate to 30% of the other for the same lot (Kricka et al., 1980) . Notorious is the 'edge effect' (Chessum and Denmark, 1978; Kricka et al., 1980) : wells at the perimeters adsorb more proteins than those in the interior. Many investigators forego the use of almost 40% of the available wells for this reason. This edge effect has been attributed to differences in surface characteristics of the plastic (Burt et al., 1979) or to thermal characteristics (moulding temperature, cooling) different from those in the interior (Denmark and Chessum, 1978) . A critical analysis of this edge effect (Oliver et al., 1981) indicated that thermal gradients during incubation may be responsible: polystyrene is a poor conductor and a thermal gradient may exist between the outer and central wells during an incubation period of 30 min, with initial and final temperatures of 20\u00b0C and 37\"C, using a routine laboratory incubator. The use of a forcedair incubator may eliminate this edge effect, giving a much lower coefficient of variation and a higher reproducibility. Warming both the plate and the solution to the incubation temperature prior to the addition of the solution seems a simple alternative.",

The frequent use of a given buffer is not necessarily a proof of its superiority. For example, Barlough et al.

This was primarily due to the high pH and not to the carbonate or the ionic strength. The use of PBS, 0.9% NaCl or deionized water as solvent gave superior results in this system. It is not clear from these studies whether or not the carbonate buffer promoted the stacking of multiple protein layers.",

However, incubation may be shortened by increasing the temperature or the antigen concentration ( Fig.  13 .1 and 13.2). Adsorption of densonucleosis virus to polystyrene plates ( Fig. 13.1) , was shown to be optimal at about 10 pg/ml (2 pg/well) and at 37\u00b0C at least 4 times shorter sensitization times (less than 20 min) were required than at 4'C. In contrast, for purified IgG, the optimum coating concentration was 1 pg/ml but at least 60 min at 37\u00b0C were required ( Fig. 13 .2). The optimal concentration of antigens or antibodies for coating is commonly between 1 and 10 pg/ml (Engvall, 1980) . Coating with complete antiserum (Fig.  13 .2) is more complicated since a pronounced optimum is achieved at a dilution of A 10-fold change in this dilution lowers the detection limit by a factor of about 2, whereas at a 100-fold change (i.e., a dilution of or the detectability is 20-30 times less. However, even at its optimum, the detectability with complete antiserum is about 4 times less than with purified IgG (Fig. 13 .2). In some cases, the detectability of EIA can be increased considerably by partial denaturation of the coating material: solid-phase coating was improved when the antibody was exposed to pH 2.5 (Ishikawa et al., 1980) or to other denaturants (urea, high temperature) prior to coating (Conradie et al., 1983) and an increase in the hydrophobicity of the proteins was proposed to be involved in this phenomenon. Since Fab is much more resistant to denaturation than Fc (Section 8.2) it is conceivable that these treatments expose more hydrophobic regions in the Fc region, which may then be preferentially adsorbed. The Fab segments may thus be more oriented towards the solvent, thus increasing the efficiency of antigen binding. In addition, Conradie et al. (1983) observed that more antibody becomes bound. is found, whereas with purified IgG a slight 'hook effect' is observed when tested with the corresponding virus in a sandwich assay. However, the use of purified IgG produces higher detectability than that of complete antiserum for coating. Incubation time required for optimum IgG coating at 37\u00b0C was longer than for DNV Partial denaturation of IgG is carried out with samples containing 10 pg/ml in 50 mM glycine-HC1 buffer, pH 2.5, containing 100 mM NaCl, incubated for 10 min at room temperature and neutralized with 500 mM Tris. The sample is then dialyzed against the coating buffer. Alternatively, IgG may be denatured in neutral buffer by the addition of an equal volume of 6 M urea and incubation overnight at room temperature, followed by extensive dialysis. Thermal denaturation is carried out for 10 min at 70\u00b0C for sheep antibodies or at 82\u00b0C for rabbit antibodies (Conradie et al., 1983) . This treatment may be different for IgG preparations from other species.",

Frankel and Gerhard (1 979) used PVC plates for the quantitation of hybridoma proteins. Among the polystyrene plates, a variation exists in the quantity of additives (lubricants) used in their preparation which may account for some of the differences encountered. Special plates ('immulon') have very little of these lubricants. Nevertheless, it is necessary to establish for each antigen or antibody the most suitable lot. Signorella and Hymer (1984) found that immulon 2 binds three times more prolactin than immulon 1. Most plastics display a negative electrical charge (< potential) at their surfaces which is quite often modified during manufacturing by a treatment for a few seconds with an intense electrical field at the solid-solution interface. This potential gives rise to a diffuse double-layer of ions. The potential is also affected by the adsorbed protein. All these physical parameters may have different but unpredictable effects on EIA (Section 9.2.2) and affect the accuracy of EIA.",

The choice between these shapes depends on the method used for quantitation of the EIA: with a read-through photometer flat-bottomed wells give less variation, for visual inspection U-shaped wells are better. The microtitre plates have not been designed for the EIA but adapted for this purpose and equipment has been devised for these plates; possibilities for more optimal designs are obvious, e.g. by increasing the surface/volume ratio. Labrousse et al. (1982) used microwells (0.8 mm diameter, 0.8 mm depth) drilled in plexiglass plates with the top of the wells (0.2 mm depth) enlarged to a diameter of 1.5 mm. Such wells have a capacity of about 0.30 pl, in contrast with the 2 0 0 4 capacity of the regular plates; however, rapid desiccation poses serious problems. Solutions are added with suitably prepared capillary pipettes. The reduced volume of reagents lowers the limit of the number of molecules which can be detected (i.e. about lo6 antibody molecules). The concentration limits for positive detection remain, however, largely unchanged since the surface/volume ratio is hardly affected. It is conceivable to increase this by a different well design. The reagents could then be more effectively used and the reaction product (enzyme signal) would become less diluted. This aspect remains to be explored.",

            "text": "Plastic tubes are also employed. Here, the choice of the plastic is also critical. Polypropylene is preferred over polystyrene, since it is easier to handle and is less breakable. It is mostly used in commercial kits. There is, however, little or no difference in the coating characteristics of the two plastics. The size of the tubes is 1&12x70-75 mm, and their form may be conical, roundor flat-bottom. Tubes generally require larger volumes (1 ml) than microtitre plates, but their surface/volume ratio can be increased by rotating almost horizontally in circular test-tube racks. Upon slow rotation, a relatively large surface is covered. Disposable polystyrene cuvets are used in some cases since they can be directly used with a common spectrophotometer. Volumes of such containers are quite large. Another often used form is beads. Placed in a round-bottom container only slightly larger than the beads themselves, they have a favorable surface/volume ratio. Beads have been popular in RIA and are used by some commercial suppliers. Shekarchi et al. (1982) used stainless steel microsticks coated with carrier material. Alternatively, plastic microsticks are available from Dynatech Laboratories. Irrespective of their nature (steel, teflon, polystyrene), they may be coated with polycarbonate or nitrocellulose. The latter is applied as a thin film of colloidon diluted with 4 volumes of ether (laboratory grade). The microsticks are dipped in this solution, dried and arranged in a transfer plate designed for use in a microtitre plate. They can be cleaned with 6 N HCl after use.",

            "text": "The attractiveness of these membranes resides in the fact that very small amounts of immunoreactants are required, providing thus a method of choice for many experiments, e.g. monitoring column effluents, screening hybridoma clones, analysis of detergent-dissociated complexes. Minute drops (less than 1 pl, containing about 100 pg, or less if antigen is pure) are applied and dried on the membrane, limiting the binding of the antigen in a small area (diameter less than 1 mm). Other binding sites can then be saturated with an unrelated inert protein or other blocking agents. The subsequent immunoenzymatic revelation of the antigen produces an insoluble colored product which precipitates at the site of the enzyme and is viewed against a white background. The discriminatory power of this technique was claimed to be greater than that obtained in microtitre plates and various substances, such as proteins, nucleic acids, cell membranes, subcellular organelles, fungi, protozoa, bacteria and viruses, were all tightly bound to the membrane (Hawkes  et a]., 1982) . Another advantage of these membranes is that antigens may be bound in the presence of detergents, although a lower efficiency of binding is observed when the concentration of non-ionic detergents (Triton X-100, Tween 80) exceeds 0.01% (Palfree and Elliott, 1982) . Jahn et al. (1984) observed that for small proteins this was due to desorbing during washing and incubation steps. A fixation step (15 min in a solution containing 10% acetic acid and 25% isopropanol followed by rinsing in water) after dotting prevented this desorption, and a 7-fold excess of Triton was found to be beneficial if SDS is present in the sample (up to 7% Triton/l% SDS). The suitability of this solid phase is attested by the rapidly growing number of publications describing their use.",

The precipitate is then dissolved in 40 ml NH40H (specific gravity 0.880) to form a saturated solution. Excess of Cu(OH), is removed by centrifugation after at least 15 min of stirring. About 0.5 g of ABM-cellulose is added to this solution with continuous stirring.

ABM-cellulose forms a white precipitate which is collected after 1 h and washed (by centrifugation) with water to remove all traces of copper. If difficulties arise in sedimenting the precipitate, a few drops of 1 M HCI should be added. The ABM-cellulose is then suspended in 50 ml of 2 M HCI, cooled in an ice bucket and 2 ml 1% NaN0,are added drop-wise.

Fixation of Staphylococci with hot TCA (Lindmark, 1982) removes the negatively charged cell-wall polymer teichoic acid, producing an IgG-sorbent which can bind 1.4 mg human IgG per ml of a 10% (v/v) suspension of bacteria and is stable for about 5 months. Formalin-fixed bacteria (Kessler, 1976) bind 35% more IgG and are stable for at least 1 year. However, IgG can be eluted quantitatively from TCA-fixed bacteria but not from formalin-fixed bacteria, probably due to the interaction between IgG and teichoic acid, unless 80 mM MgClz is included in the acid buffer.",
