            "text": "The 2008 forum on nanotechnology, also funded by NSF, is instructive about the value of non-expert input on esoteric scientific issues 10 . The organizers selected \"from a broad pool of applicants a diverse and roughly representative group of 74 citizens to participate at six geographically distinct sites across the country. \" Participants were informed by \"a 61-page background document-vetted by experts-to read prior to deliberating. \" They produced a hodgepodge of conclusions and recommendations, including \"concern over the effectiveness of regulations\" and \"reduced certainty about the benefits of human enhancement technologies\" but wanted \"the government to guarantee access to them if they prove too expensive for the average American. \" What a surprise: the participants lacked an understanding of the risks and benefits but wanted the government to provide them with entitlements so they could avail themselves of the beneficial products of nanotechnology! As to our disappointment at the report's lack of firm, clear recommendations for regulatory reform to reduce gratuitous regulatory burdens, the Gould et al. 1 letter quotes the then US Secretary of Agriculture Dan Glickman as saying that there must be public trust \"in the regulatory process that ensures thorough review-including complete and open public involvement.\" How does one secure that trust? How many years of fruitless regulation and billions of dollars squandered-to say nothing of untold opportunity costs-are necessary to assuage unwarranted public anxieties? By analogy, should we allow \"complete and open public involvement\" to dictate when a new hepatitis C vaccine or an antibiotic gratuitous regulatory approval, for example, for a transgenic herbicide-tolerant plant that is phenotypically indistinguishable from one produced with less precise and more primitive techniques, is simply indefensible from our perspective. Such regulatory requirements do nothing to advance safety or improve sustainability. They do nothing but inhibit access to safe and desperately needed products by those who need them the most. In developing countries in particular, the combination of poverty, government corruption, and unnecessary case-by-case regulatory reviews is toxic. The NAS panel had an opportunity to point this out, to ease the path to greater food and economic security for those most in need. They failed to seize it.",

We note that regulatory costs vary by trait-crop combination and country. Our report and a recent study of regulatory costs in a developing country show that the regulatory costs for specific countries can be more than an order of magnitude less than $45 million. Indeed, some crop varieties developed with new gene editing methods are not regulated at all in the United States. We conclude that 'regulation of GE crops inherently involves tradeoffs.

Previously, we have engineered an Escherichia coli reporter strain capable of micromolarlevel detection of both vapor-phase TNT and its main impurity and degradation product, 2,4-dinitrotoluene (DNT) 6, 7 .

Our bacterial TNT sensor strain harbors a plasmid-borne reporter in which the DNT/ TNT-inducible yqjF gene promoter 6 is fused to the green fluorescent protein gene gfpmut2. Activation of yqjF, by an as-yet unidentified DNT degradation product, is controlled by the transcriptional regulator YhaJ 8 .
