Transient haematological remission was achieved with intensive plasmapheresis, but cardiac function deteriorated and renal function was not restored. Initiation of eculizumab after 6 months of dialysis significantly improved organ function. At 43 months after presentation, haematological values had normalised and cardiac function had improved. Dialysis was discontinued after 10 months (the longest reported time in a patient with aHUS) and the estimated glomerular filtration rate had recovered to 70 mL/min/ 1.73 m 2 . In conclusion, treatment of aHUS with eculizumab, even after long-term dialysis, can significantly improve renal function. Discontinuation of dialysis and resolution of cardiac function has implications on the potential recovery and treatment choice of such patients. Earlier initiation of eculizumab, however, might have prevented the irreversible renal sclerosis and cardiac dysfunction.",

            "text": "Atypical haemolytic uraemic syndrome (aHUS) is a rare disease mainly associated with uncontrolled complement activation leading to endothelial cell damage and the development of systemic thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA). 1 Clinically, aHUS is characterised by Coombs-negative anaemia, thrombocytopenia and organ dysfunction. The most frequent manifestation of aHUS is kidney damage, but cardiac complications occur in up to 10% of patients due to the systemic nature of TMA. [2] [3] [4] Until recently, plasma exchange/plasma infusion (PE/PI) was the only option to manage patients with aHUS. A key treatment advance was the availability of eculizumab, a humanised monoclonal antibody to C5, licensed in the USA and the EU in 2011, and in Russia in 2013. In studies to date, eculizumab has demonstrated high efficacy in children and adults with aHUS, achieving remission of haematological symptoms and improvement or, in some cases, full recovery of renal function. 5 It is unclear, however, whether there is any benefit of continued prevention of TMA with eculizumab in patients for whom treatment was not immediately initiated and in whom long-term TMA has caused significant injury to organs. We review the relevant literature and present an illustrative case study.",

In a second trial in patients with more recent progression of TMA, four of the five patients receiving dialysis (range, 6-26 days) were able to discontinue dialysis during long-term eculizumab treatment. 5 To our knowledge, the longest reported duration of dialysis before eculizumab treatment permitted dialysis to be discontinued is 4 months, in a 7-month-old girl with aHUS resulting from a CFH mutation. 8 Also, a 21-year-old woman with aHUS discontinued dialysis after 3.5 months as a result of eculizumab treatment. 9 Conversely, there are reports of patients in whom renal damage was too advanced to be recovered with eculizumab treatment even though their prior dialysis duration was shorter (<3 months). 10 11 Initially, management with standard therapy of PI, anticoagulants and steroids was associated with an improvement in symptoms, however, at 1 month post presentation, our patient deteriorated. Seven months of PE did not result in further clinical benefit. Eculizumab initiation led to discontinuation of dialysis in our patient after 10 months of anuria. Notably, long-term eculizumab may allow the recovery and repair of renal tissue, even in patients with long-term disease. In a clinical study of such patients, eGFR increased by a mean of 6 mL/min/ 1.73 m 2 after 6 months of eculizumab treatment and was maintained at 1 year (mean improvement 9 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ). 5 While renal function in our patient has not normalised, eGFR improved to 70 mL/min/1.73 m 2 after 35 months of eculizumab treatment. A renal biopsy revealed characteristics of prior TMA and sclerosis, and ischaemia of renal tissues. Furthermore, eculizumab also improved the patient's critical hypertension and myocardial hypertrophy. In our patient, eculizumab treatment was delayed until the drug was approved in Russia. Earlier treatment might have prevented not only severe and irreversible kidney damage, but also the development of cardiovascular complications.",

Discordant findings of individual biomarkers, including C3, C5a, C5b-9 and CH 50 , have been documented, 7 15 while an ex vivo assay monitoring complement deposition on endothelial cells may prove effective in monitoring eculizumab efficiency and personalising eculizumab therapy. 7 Recently, the key role of mutations and polymorphisms in complement factor genes has been established in aHUS. [16] [17] [18] In our patient, aHUS occurred due to a complement activating condition (vaccination) and multiple genetic risk factors (mutation and polymorphisms) in CFH. The position of the CFH mutation (1218) is important for binding to C3, regulating alternative complement pathway activation on endothelial cells, and is associated with the aHUS disease phenotype. 19 However, the amino acid change (Cys to Tyr) has not been previously reported and is not included in the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Exome Sequencing Project (http:// evs.gs.washington.edu/EVS/). The p.Cys1218Tyr substitution affects the disulphide bond between Cys1218 and Cys1167 (http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P08603), a conserved amino acid at the C-terminus of CFH. Moreover, this change is predicted to be potentially pathogenic by both the mutation analysis software (Sorting Intolerant From Tolerant (SIFT); score 0.00, deleterious change; http://sift.jcvi.org/) and PolyPhen-2 (score 1.00, probably damaging; http://genetics.bwh.harvard. edu/pph2/). The fact that the patient did not manifest any further TMA despite multiple infections (complement activating conditions) during treatment with eculizumab, indicates that the dose utilised was adequate to block terminal complement production.",
