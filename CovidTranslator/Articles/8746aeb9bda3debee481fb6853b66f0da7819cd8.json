            "text": "More recently, S pneumoniae has become more resistant to penicillin and the macrolides. A small proportion of cases are also resistant to fluoroquinolones. Recent antimicrobial use (within 3 months) is associated with resistance to the same class of antibiotics [4] . The 2007 guidelines emphasize the importance of recent prior antibiotic therapy and prescribing a different class of antimicrobial therapy. There is also evidence that resistance to penicillin and cephalosporins may be decreasing or stabilizing, whereas the resistance to erythromycin is increasing. Doern and colleagues [5] , using data from 44 US centers, demonstrated a stable rate of penicillin resistance of 34.2%, with 15.7% intermediate resistance and 18 .5% high resistance. Macrolide resistance had increased, although most was efflux pump mediated and considered to be low-level resistance. Nevertheless, the mean macrolide resistance of pneumococci was 27.2% in a recent meta-analysis [6] . Despite this relatively high rate, it is widely believed that this is likely attributable to the efflux pump mechanism, which is more a laboratory phenomenon, because significant failure rates with the newer macrolides have not been reported. Fluoroquinolone resistance was less than 1%. The most active b-lactam was ceftriaxone, with a resistance rate of 6.9%. Although prior antibiotic use of macrolides, penicillins, cephalosporins, and sulfonamides increased the likelihood of future pneumococcal antibiotic resistance to all these agents, this was not the case for fluoroquinolones, wherein pneumococci resistant to other antibiotics remained susceptible to fluoroquinolones [7] . The fluoroquinolone clinical failures that have been reported mainly have been with ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin. Ciprofloxacin is not considered an antipneumococcal fluoroquinolone, and levofloxacin failures occurred mainly at lower dose ranges [8] . The 2007 CAP guidelines caution that inappropriate overuse of fluoroquinolones (ie, acute bronchitis) hastens the development of resistance.",

These studies used antibiotics that included mainly monotherapy (macrolides or quinolones) in the treatment regimens for atypical organisms rather than a treatment regimen that included b-lactams in addition to atypical coverage, however. A recent report from Arnold and colleagues [11] evaluated the effects of treating CAP in four different worldwide regions with a b-lactam alone versus therapy, including atypical coverage, and reported significant benefits in time to clinical stability, decreased length of stay, decreased total mortality, and decreased CAP-related mortality when atypicals were treated.",

Most EDs instituted policies to improve timing of antibiotic therapy for patients suspected of having pneumonia, 46 (51%) automated chest radiograph (CXR) ordering at triage, 37 (41%) prioritized patients suspected of having pneumonia, and 33 (37%) administered antibiotics before obtaining CXR results. Despite these efforts, the increasing volumes in US EDs and resulting overcrowding made achieving 4-hour quality standards much less likely [14, 15] . Another source of barriers to administer appropriate antibiotics rapidly is the atypical presentation of many patients who have CAP. One study found that altered mental status, absence of fever, absence of hypoxia, and elderly age were significant predictors of antibiotic delays, but it was not clear that such delays contributed to mortality [16] . Pines and colleagues [17] found that less severe illness and nonclassic presentation were associated with antibiotic delays. In another study, Metersky and colleagues [18] found that 22% of their cohort of admitted Medicare patients who had CAP presented in a manner that was atypical enough to cause delays in antibiotic administration. Fee and Weber [19] found that many of the ''outliers'' who were given their antibiotics after 4 hours did not have a diagnosis of ED CAP and many did not have an abnormal chest radiograph.",

For example, the sample used was taken from the National Pneumonia Project from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) and included patients 65 years of age and older but excluded many patients who have immune-compromising conditions. Moreover, although it is assumed that these patients were treated in both studies by emergency medicine physicians in an ED before hospital admission, these details are never described anywhere in either paper; in fact, the term emergency department is not even used in the publications. Several recent editorials and opinion papers [23, 24] have criticized this 4-hour time recommendation. The CMS is in the process of changing the 4-hour window (PN-5b) to a 6-hour window (PN-5c) for reporting purposes. The 2007 CAP guidelines have changed the focus from an absolute time frame to recommending that patients receive the initial antibiotic dose during their time in the ED before being admitted to the hospital. Hospitals were also urged to monitor for inappropriate antimicrobial treatment of patients who do not have CAP [2] .",

Use of local protocols should facilitate improved patient care and documentation for reimbursement. Pham and colleagues [25] reported data on ED treatment of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and pneumonia from the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey involving 544 EDs from 1998 through 2004. Recommended antibiotics were administered to 69% of patients who had pneumonia, and pulse oximetry was measured in 46% of patients who had pneumonia. There were more than 2.7 million opportunities to improve care and 22,000 excess deaths per year associated with current treatment of AMI and pneumonia.

Local pneumonia protocols could be cost-saving, because fewer health care dollars would be spent by identifying patients who have mild disease and could be treated at home. Information from 2007 guidelines on site of care should provide important criteria [26, 27] . The cost differential is hundreds of dollars for outpatient treatment compared with thousands of dollars for an admission. Adherence to protocols also has resulted in shorter hospitalization stays with cost savings.

Symptoms may not have resolved, or had a chance to resolve, or may have progressed. Infrequently, side effects from the antimicrobial agents bring the patient to the ED. The presenting respiratory symptoms may be caused by a nonpneumonic illness. The ED physician should identify the patient with a realistic possibility of pneumonia and differentiate patients presenting with other illnesses and similar symptoms (see Fig. 2 ). Information obtained from the history and physical examination should be helpful in making alternative diagnoses more or less likely. The presence of underlying diseases and medication history may be useful in defining the type of pneumonia and profiling its severity. Metlay and colleagues [29] reported that the absence of any vital sign abnormality or any abnormalities on chest auscultation can substantially reduce the likelihood of CAP. Several studies, including an emergency medicine evidenced-based review [30] , make the point that there is no one historical finding or physical examination finding or combination of findings that can accurately rule in or rule out the diagnosis of pneumonia. Nevertheless, it is still recommended by these authors that history and physical examination findings can help to contribute to the diagnosis of pneumonia; thus, the concept of performing a complete history and physical examination findings continue to be an integral part of evaluating these patients. Moreover, pertinent history and examination findings can help the emergency physician to determine if certain organisms are more likely causative agents and whether antimicrobial resistance is likely.",

An early report by Heckerling and colleagues [31] determined that certain findings, such as fever, tachycardia, decreased breath sounds, and absence of asthma were predictors of finding CAP on CXR. Subsequent studies suggest that no one symptom, sign or examination finding is statistically powerful enough to rule in or rule out the diagnosis of pneumonia on CXR. The absence of any vital sign abnormality, coupled with a normal examination, may nearly excluded the diagnosis, with only a 5% miss rate, as reported recently by O'Brien and colleagues [32] . Despite the lack of predictors to rule in the diagnosis, several vital sign abnormalities (hypoxia, fever, tachycardia, or tachypnea) make the diagnosis of pneumonia more likely [33] . Most consensus recommendations state that a CXR should be obtained in patients older than the age of 40 years and in patients with abnormal vital signs or physical examination findings or the presence of significant comorbidities.",

Although the CXR is still considered the standard of care for diagnosing CAP, highresolution CT scanning may be more sensitive. In a frequently cited study [35] , chest radiography missed 31% of cases of possible pneumonia (8 of 26 cases) that were subsequently diagnosed on high-resolution CT. Diagnosis by CT is being made even more commonly, given the increasing numbers of CT scans done to rule out common causes of chest pain, such as CT pulmonary embolus studies to rule out pulmonary embolus and CT aneurysm studies to rule out aortic dissection.

The PSI was made up of 20 variables and was somewhat cumbersome to use in many EDs. The 2007 guidelines favor the CURB65 (see Box 1) designed by the British Thoracic Society [27] . Only 5 variables are required: newly developed confusion (C), uremia (U), increased respiratory rate (R), decreased blood pressure (B) and age older than 65 years. Niederman [39] suggested that the two instruments should be complementary, because each has its limitations. Although the PSI has been used to determine which patients have a low mortality risk, it can occasionally underestimate CAP severity, especially in younger patients who do not have comorbid illnesses. In one study comparing both instruments in patients in the ED [40] , both successfully predicted which patients had a low risk for mortality. The CURB65 had a better gradation of severe disease, however, with those patients having scores from 2 to 5 having a progressively greater mortality rate compared with the PSI, which has only two categories of severe illness (IV and V). Interestingly, both tools were designed to predict mortality and not to determine the optimal site of care. Renaud and colleagues [41] found that the routine use of the PSI increased the percentage of patients in PSI classes I and II who were treated as outpatients (42.8%) compared with an ED in which the PSI was not routinely used (23.9%). The increased outpatient treatment was not associated with any compromise in patient safety.

Certainly, the low mortality rate in patients treated at home does not justify a search for an etiologic agent. The criticism of routinely obtaining blood cultures is that studies show that they rarely change therapy. A recent emergency medicine study reported that blood cultures altered therapy in only 3.6% of patients and that most of these were changes to narrow therapy, with only 1.0% of patients having their antibiotics broadened [51] . The accompanying editorial by Moran and Abrahamian [52] rationalized that blood cultures still make sense for patients in the ICU because they are more likely to be bacteremic and they are more at risk should empiric therapy be inappropriate. The editorial by Walls and Resnick [23] in the same issue criticized the JCAHO and CMS for adopting the original policy to require blood cultures for all admitted patients who have CAP, because the weight of evidence clearly does not support this. The 2007 guidelines recommend obtaining blood and respiratory cultures in all patients admitted to the ICU. They also suggest obtaining blood cultures in a subset of patients admitted to the ward who have comorbid conditions associated with potentially higher bacteremic rates. Blood cultures should be obtained before empiric antimicrobial therapy. If patients were pretreated with antibiotics, blood cultures still should be obtained in appropriate patients, because resistant organisms may be present. In patients who have bacteremia, antimicrobial susceptibility can guide continued therapy and the appropriate switch to oral agents.",
