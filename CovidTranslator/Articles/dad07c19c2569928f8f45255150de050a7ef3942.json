The complete genome of the SARS-CoV (SARS coronavirus) has since been sequenced. The SARS-CoV nucleocapsid (SARS-CoV N) protein shares little homology with other members of the coronavirus family. In the present paper, we show that SARS-CoV N is capable of inducing apoptosis of COS-1 monkey kidney cells in the absence of growth factors by down-regulating ERK (extracellular-signal-regulated kinase), up-regulating JNK (c-Jun N-terminal kinase) and p38 MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) pathways, and affecting their downstream effectors. SARS-CoV N expression also down-regulated phospho-Akt and Bcl-2 levels, and activated caspases 3 and 7. However, apoptosis was independent of the p53 and Fas signalling pathways. Furthermore, activation of the p38 MAPK pathway was found to induce actin reorganization in cells devoid of growth factors. At the cytoskeletal level, SARS-CoV N down-regulated FAK (focal adhesion kinase) activity and also down-regulated fibronectin expression. This is the first report showing the ability of the N protein of SARS-CoV to induce apoptosis and actin reorganization in mammalian cells under stressed conditions.",

Interestingly, cells transfected with SARS-CoV N showed significant cell death when cultured under conditions of stress induced by serum starvation. In order to quantify cell death under these conditions, we conducted a TUNEL assay. As shown in Figure 1 Given that N-induced cell death was observed at significant levels only in the absence of growth factors, and since it is known that binding of ligands to integrin receptors maintains the major survival pathway through PI3K (phosphoinositide 3-kinase) and MAPK pathways when growth-factor-mediated signalling is absent [8] , we thus postulated that N may be interfering with the integrin signalling pathway. Experiments were designed to monitor the expression levels of the integrin receptor and ligand in Nexpressing cells. We checked the level of one of the most abundant ligands, fibronectin. N expression clearly down-regulated the level of extracellular fibronectin in the absence of serum (Figure 2A , upper panel). However, we were unable to observe a significant difference in the level of fibronectin in the presence of serum, since only a small quantity of protein could be detected by immunoprecipitation. This may be due to lower stability of fibronectin protein in the presence of serum factors. Next, we investigated whether N-mediated down-regulation of extracellular fibronectin level was due to suppression of fibronectin gene expression. For this, we restricted protein transport beyond the endoplasmic reticulum by treatment with brefeldin A, and immunoprecipitated the cell lysate with anti-fibronectin antibody, which showed the total amount of nascent fibronectin protein produced by the cells. As expected, fibronectin levels were found to be lower in N-expressing cells irrespective of the presence or absence of serum (Figure 2A , lower panel), suggesting that N down-regulated fibronectin gene expression. Subsequently, we analysed the levels of the fibronectin receptor (integrin \u03b1 V ), but there was no change in the level of the latter ( Figure 2B ). We then assayed for the activity of FAK, which is a major intermediate factor that co-ordinates signal communication between integrins and downstream effectors such as MAPKs [9] . The level of phosphorylated FAK was significantly down-regulated in N-expressing cells in the absence of growth factors ( Figure 2C ). This result supported further our hypothesis that N-induced cell death was due to interference with the integrin signalling pathway, and that serum factors inhibited this phenomenon dominantly by maintaining the activity of FAK through alternative pathways. Figure 2 (D) shows the expression pattern of N protein in the presence and absence of serum. Two different concentrations of DNA (1.5 \u00b5g and 3 \u00b5g) were used in all the Western blot experiments to rule out any possible experimental artifact.",

To address this, we used rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin to analyse actin distribution in the presence of N. In the presence of serum, N expression had no visible effects on actin distribution (Figure 4A , compare N-protein-transfected cells with non-transfected cells). Figure 4 (C) shows actin distribution in N-expressing cells in the absence of growth factors, i.e. actin filaments concentrated around the nuclear membrane forming a ring-like structure. In contrast, actin is distributed extensively throughout the cytoplasm of non-transfected cells. To prove that the ring-like structure was indeed actin, we employed the specific actin-depolymerizing agent, cytochalasin D, which effectively blocked actin ring formation at a concentration as low as 5 nM ( Figure 4E ). Furthermore, SB203580 was used to verify whether actin reorganization was dependent on the p38 MAPK pathway. As shown in Figure 4 (G), SB203580 inhibited actin redistribution in N-transfected cells. Figures 4(B) , 4(D), 4(F) and 4(H) show N expression in the respective cells (superimposition of FITC-stained image on rhodamine-stained image). Thus we conclude that N-induced activation of the p38 MAPK pathway in the absence of growth factors leads to actin reorganization.",

The level of p-Akt was found to be significantly down-regulated in the absence of serum (Figure 5A, lanes 4-6) . This observation was confirmed further using an expression construct of p110\u03b1 (pCDNA3 PI3K caax 110 HA; Dr A. S.

Expression of this construct together with N rescued the cells from a death phenotype as exhibited by inhibition of caspase 3 activation ( Figure 5E, lane 1) . We then analysed the levels of Bcl-2 expression in the presence of N. Immunoprecipitation of Bcl-2 showed strong down-regulation in the absence of serum ( Figure 5B, lanes 4-6) .

Caspase 3 activation yields a 17 kDa product, which was present in N-expressing cells only in the absence of growth factors. This activation was detected using an antibody that detects both the precursor and cleaved product ( Figure 5C, lane 4) . Caspase 7 activation produces a major product of 20 kDa. Like caspase 3, caspase 7 was also activated only in the absence of growth factors in N-expressing cells. This was detected by an antibody specific for the cleaved caspase 7 only ( Figure 5D, lane 4) . Activation of caspase 3 was confirmed further by Z-VAD-FMK, which blocks its activation ( Figure 5E, lane 3) . However, blocking the p38 MAPK pathway by SB203580 was unable to inhibit caspase 3 activation. Thus we propose that p38 MAPK-dependent actin reorganization and caspase activation are probably two independent functional properties of N. In addition, N-mediated apoptosis was found to be independent of Fas, or the Fas-ligand-mediated pathway, and did not involve modulation of p53 and Bax (results not shown). From these experiments, we conclude that the N protein of SARS-CoV induces apoptosis and actin reorganization by interfering with the integrin signalling pathway during cellular stress induced by the absence of growth factors.",

The principal histopathologic lesions of the atypical pneumonia of SARS are serous, fibrinous and haemorrhagic inflammation in most pulmonary alveoli, alveolar thickening with interstitial mononuclear inflammatory infiltration, diffuse alveolar damage, desquamation of pneumocytes, formation of hyaline membrane and multinucleated pneumocytes, with capillary engorgement and microthrombosis. SARS patients also display lymphopenia, as well as abnormal structures of lymph nodes and spleen including haemorrhagic necrosis, reduced numbers of lymphocytes, depletion of lymph node follicles and atrophy of splenic nodules. Pneumocytes represent the primary target of infection. Severe and similar damage to the pulmonary, lymphohaematopoietic, hepatic and other tissues infected by SARS-CoV is responsible for the clinical features of SARS and may lead to the death of patients [11, 12] . The SARS N protein has been shown to be highly immunogenic. There is predominant antibody response in patients against N [13] . This process may in turn trigger cytokine production which may actually induce apoptosis of the host cells. Our results also show that the N protein of SARS is capable of inducing actin reorganization. Hence the focal sites of infection with an altered cytokine milieu and cytoskeletal reorganization may be able to alter the duration of interaction between the host cells engaged in combating infection, the lowering of which would lead to an unsuccessful immune initiation event and persistent viral presence and replication.",

Moreover, the observed cell death we observed was tissue-type-specific. We could not detect significant cell death in human hepatoma cells which are of epithelial cell lineage. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that the observed stress tolerance of HuH7 cells is a specific property of that particular cell line rather than tissue specificity, since the mechanism of transformation of COS-1 cells and Huh7 cells are different and hence may have resulted from deregulation of different regulatory networks in these two cell lines, leading to an altered end response. Identification of the differentially regulated factors in these two cell lines during N expression might provide a clue in addressing problems associated with viral infection. Also, identification of the upstream effectors of apoptosis in COS-1 cells will reveal the mechanisms responsible for triggering cell death. Future work in these directions will help us evaluate the specific role of N protein in apoptosis induction and classify it as a host response or a response due to the cytopathic effect of N expression. Research along these lines holds great promise for designing therapeutics to alleviate tissue injury during the early stages of SARS viral infection.",

Moreover, human hepatoma cells (HuH7) maintained under similar conditions did not show significant cell death (results not shown). The relatively moderate percentage of death of COS-1 cells observed in our experiments may be attributed to the limitations of the transient transfection method.
