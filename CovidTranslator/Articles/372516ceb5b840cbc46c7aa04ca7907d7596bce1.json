            "text": "A hybridisation-based genosensor was designed on a 100 nm sputtered gold film. This material worked as an immobilisation and transduction surface. A 30-mer sequence that encodes a short lysine-rich region, unique to SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) virus, was chosen as target. A complementary strand (probe), labelled with a thiol group at the 3 -end, was immobilised on the film. After blocking the surface, hybridisation with the biotin-conjugated SARS strand (at the 3 -end) took place. Interaction with alkaline phosphatase-labelled streptavidin permits amplified indirect electrochemical detection. The analytical signal is constituted by an electrochemical process of indigo carmine, the soluble product of the enzymatic hydrolysis of 3-indoxyl phosphate. The use of a sensitive electrochemical technique such as square wave voltammetry allowed a detection limit of 6 pM to be obtained for this DNA sequence, lower than any other found in the bibliography. The parameters affecting the methodology were studied, with special attention being placed on selectivity. Specificity was clearly enhanced when interaction time and stringency (in the form of formamide percentage) were increased. With 1 h of strand interaction and employing 50% of formamide in the hybridisation buffer, a 3-base mismatch strand was perfectly distinguished from the complementary.",

            "text": "Biosensors have become a very important area of Analytical Chemistry, since the majority of current and future analytical requirements are being solved by simple and sensitive devices (Nakamura and Karube, 2003) . Apart from the well-established enzymatic sensors, the selectivity of affinity interactions such as those of antigen-antibody or nucleic acid hybridisation is exploited for the respective development of promising immuno and nucleic acid assays (Campas and Katakis, 2004) . Nucleic acid detection is becoming relevant not only in the field of food analysis but also in clinical diagnosis. A DNA/RNA test addresses the question of whether a patient is infected with a particular pathogen or not. It is advantageous compared to immunoassay in cases of recent infection or underlying immunodeficiency. Moreover, it is very useful for treatment monitoring, since elimination of pathogen nucleic acids indicates successful handling. Miniaturisation, on the other hand, is one of the more recent trends in Analytical Chemistry. Although it is important in all fields, it is of special relevance in the area of biosensors. The simplicity of the electrochemical instrumentation and the type of measurement that is made adapt well to miniaturisation requirements (Matisyk, 2003) . Several alternative ways of electrochemically detecting DNA are possible (Wang, 2002) . The intrinsic electroactivity of adenine and guanine can be the basis for direct measurement of nucleic acids (Wu et al., 2003; De-Los-Santos-Alvarez et al., 2002) . The determination of electroactive indicators that intercalate or otherwise associate with double-stranded DNA (Gherghi et al., 2004; Zhu et al., 2003) is another alternative. The use of enzymes is a possibility that enhances assay sensitivity enormously due to their inherent amplification. Horseradish-peroxidase has been used as an enzyme 0956-5663/$ -see front matter \u00a9 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved. doi:10. 1016/j.bios.2004.10.019 label (Alfonta et al., 2001; Pividori et al., 2001) as well as glucose oxidase (Dom\u00ednguez et al., 2004) and alkaline phosphatase (Carpini et al., 2004; Aguilar and Ritsch, 2003) . Although enzymes can be directly conjugated, the use of a wellknown affinity interaction such as avidin-biotin is an easy alternative. Alkaline phosphatase (AP) converts orthophosphoric monoesters into alcohols and thus various phosphate esters can act as substrates. Phenylphosphate (Jenkins et al., 1988) , p-aminophenylphosphate (Meusel et al., 1995) and p-nitrophenylphosphate (Tie et al., 1992) are among the most common. \u2423-naphthylphosphate (NP), which is hydrolysed to naphthol, has been widely used (Abad-Villar et al., 2002a; Carpini et al., 2004; Xu et al., 2001) . 3-Indoxyl phosphate (3-IP) has been proposed by our research group as an adequate substrate for AP in immunoelectrochemical approaches (Fern\u00e1ndez-S\u00e1nchez and Costa-Garc\u00eda, 1998) . Due to its satisfactory electrochemical behaviour, it has been used for the development of AP-based enzyme immunoassays (Bengoechea-\u00c1lvarez et al., 2002) , this being the first time for it to be used to perform DNA assays on gold surfaces.",

Gold has always been an appropriate material for the electrochemical detection of substances, while also allowing different formats. Thin-film gold electrodes produced by magnetron sputtering have been voltammetrically and amperometrically characterized (Brett et al., 1997) . The quartz crystal balance for piezoelectric measurements and surface plasmon resonance, likewise based on thin gold electrodes, have been respectively used for DNA analysis (Minunni et al., 2003; Jordan et al., 1997) . Gold also offers the relevant possibility of generating self-assembled DNA monolayers through thiol groups (Levicky et al., 1998; Zhang et al., 2002) due to the strong binding between sulphur and gold, which may be considered almost covalent (Bain et al., 1989) .",

Reducing the cell volume has several advantages (Wijayawardhana et al., 1999) , the first being the decrease in the diffusion distances required for analytes to reach their surface-bound receptor partners. Moreover, in the case of enzymatic detection, the product dilution, which is a critical factor in achieving low detection limits, diminishes. A simple, cheap and easy-to-handle homemade device is presented that allows the simultaneous performance of the hybridisation procedure and sequential detection of more that 20 assay sites.",

Bearing in mind that streptavidin adsorbs easily onto gold surfaces, ST-AP (10 L of 7.4 \u00d7 10 \u22128 M solution) was immobilised on the gold film for 10 min by physical adsorption. After cleaning (with 0.1 M Tris-HCl buffer, 1 mM MgCl 2 , pH 7.2), 20 L of 6 mM 3-IP were added. This concentra-tion has already been employed in previous studies (D\u00edaz-Gonz\u00e1lez et al., 2002; Casta\u00f1o-\u00c1lvarez et al., 2004) . After 15 min, 3 L of concentrated H 2 SO 4 , and 7 L of Milli-Q water were added. The acid was needed not only to stop the reaction, but also to sulphonate and solubilise the indigo blue that was formed. Water was added to increase the volume until 30 L, considered the optimum total volume for an adequate operation. The acid:water volume proportion may be changed when great quantities of indigo blue are produced, always maintaining the final volume (10 L). No signal was obtained when the procedure was followed without immobilising AP on the working electrode. The only significant difference between signals recorded for IC solutions or enzymatically generated IC is that, in the latter case, the peak potential moved slightly to more negative potentials. This is possibly due to the in situ generation of the electroactive substance, which favoured the electrochemical process. The potential scan was consequently performed between \u22120.15 and +0.3 V. As the signal obtained for 10 min (29 A) is not much lower than that obtained for 15 min (32 A), 10 min was the one subsequently employed. The relative standard deviation of measurements carried out in different surfaces (n = 4) of a gold film was 5.3%.",

In order to study immobilisation, a label was attached to the other end to generate a detectable signal. As AP is a protein of approximately 150 000 Da, labelling a strand with AP can affect its affinity. To solve this problem, the strand may be labelled at its end with a small molecule, biotin.

In this case, the signal/background ratio was not very high, indicating the appreciable level of non-specific adsorptions. In order to increase this ratio, several parameters such as interaction times and ST-AP concentration were varied. Concentrations of ST-AP ranging from 10 \u22129 to 10 \u22126 M (20 L) were tested with biotinylated albumin being adsorbed for 30 min and an interaction time with ST-AP of 1 h. The best values for this ratio were obtained for a 10 \u22127 M concentration. However, when the double-labelled oligonucleotide strand was immobilised (10 L of 1.02 M solution for 30 min), the amount of indigo blue produced made it necessary to decrease the concentration of 3-IP (from 6 to 3 mM) and to change the volume of acid and water added. Therefore, 5 L of acid and 5 L of water were subsequently added. Since the background signal was still high, the influence of ST-AP concentration was tested once more. When varying the concentration from 10 \u221210 to 10 \u22127 M, the best signal/background ratio was obtained for 10 \u22129 M, which was the one employed for the remainder of the study.",

Although there is a preference adsorption for thiols, disulphides give rise to similar species (Bain et al., 1989) . The length of the chain was chosen so as to allow hybridisation and electrochemical processes to take place, since too dense monolayers do not allow electronic transference (Kelley et al., 1999) . Shorter chains are more volatile and hence more difficult to handle. Thioctic acid and 6-mercapto-1-hexanol produced high background and the S/B ratio was not favourable (1.56 and 1.4, respectively). Although for 1-hexanethiol the background was similar to that obtained for other compounds, the signal was much higher, resulting in a more adequate ratio (4.9). 6-Mercapto-1-hexanol is normally employed for DNA assays; however, the authors have not found any reference to the use of 1-hexanethiol in this type of application despite its favourable behaviour.",

The S/B ratio for 1-hexanethiol was analogous to that obtained when a double-labelled (with biotin and thiol) strand was used. However, it was much lower for albumin. This might be caused by steric hindrance, due to the large size of albumin, which may hinder hybridisation. It has been reported that the creation of mixed monolayers of thiol-modified DNA probe and a spacer thiol (mercaptohexanol) in two steps makes DNA molecules stand up consistently in such a way that they become accessible for hybridisation (Herne and Tarlov, 1997) . Therefore, 1-hexanethiol was employed for the remainder of the study as blocking agent.",

Interaction time (10 min) could not be increased because it is the time in which the ethanolic solution evaporated. Higher drop volumes could not be employed because of drop spill. Repeated additions of the agent two and three times once it had evaporated were tested without good results. Two blocking steps, before and after hybridisation, did not show better results. A decrease in the ST-AP concentration, in the range comprised between 10 \u22129 and 10 \u221211 M, was also tested. Although background decreased, the best S/B ratio was obtained for 10 \u22129 M. Values of 1.5, 3.9 and 6.6 of S/B were obtained for 10 \u221211 , 10 \u221210 and 10 \u22129 M, respectively. Accordingly, the same methodology was employed, always recording the background signal. Fig. 7 shows the effect of time on hybridisation at room temperature and 37 \u2022 C. The signal increases slightly with time up to evaporation (30 min for 37 \u2022 C and more than 60 min for room temperature). This is the contrary to what occurred for immobilisation. Evaporation favours DNA adsorption and diminishes the hybridisation signal. As the drop volume cannot be increased to increase interaction time, hybridisation may be performed for 30 min at 37 \u2022 C or for 60 min at room temperature. As similar signals were obtained at 37 \u2022 C with 20 L for 30 min and 10 L for 15 min, the latter procedure was employed to reduce analysis time and reagent consumption.",

It was successfully applied to the development of genosensors, in particular for the detection of a SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) virus specific sequence. Immobilisation of a DNA probe on the gold surface was carried out through a thiol group attached to the 3 -end with an aliphatic spacer. The parameters affecting immobilisation were studied employing a doublelabelled (biotinylated and thiolated) DNA strand. AP-labelled streptavidin was used for enzymatic detection. Blocking with 1-hexanethiol produced well-defined signals. Evaporation of solutions was a critical point for achieving optimum results, favouring immobilisation while preventing hybridisation. The enzymatic hydrolysis of 3-IP allowed low detection limits (6 pM) to be achieved with respect to analogous schemes reported in the literature. Selectivity of the assay was demonstrated using a 3-base mismatch DNA strand. Clear discrimination was possible employing 1 h of hybridisation time and 50% of formamide in the buffer. Work is in progress to study selectivity in more depth, with the aim of also obtaining discrimination for 2-base and 1-base mismatch strands.",
