            "text": "Understanding infection dynamics in animal hosts is fundamental to managing spillover and emergence of zoonotic infections. Hendra virus is endemic in Australian pteropodid bat populations and can be lethal to horses and humans. However, we know little about the factors driving Hendra virus prevalence in resevoir bat populations, making spillover difficult to predict. We use Hendra virus prevalence data collected from 13 000 pooled bat urine samples across space and time to determine if pulses of prevalence are periodic and synchronized across sites. We also test whether site-specific precipitation and temperature affect the amplitude of the largest annual prevalence pulses. We found little evidence for a periodic signal in Hendra virus prevalence. Although the largest amplitude pulses tended to occur over winter, pulses could also occur in other seasons. We found that Hendra virus prevalence was weakly synchronized across sites over short distances, suggesting that prevalence is driven by local-scale effects. Finally, we found that drier conditions in previous seasons and the abundance of Pteropus alecto were positively correlated with the peak annual values of Hendra virus prevalence. Our results suggest that in addition to seasonal effects, bat density and local climatic conditions interact to drive Hendra virus infection dynamics.",

These pathogens include rabies, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, Ebola, Marburg, Nipah and Hendra virus [1] [2] [3] [4] . To understand the conditions that enable pathogens to spill over from bats to other species, we need to understand the mechanisms driving pathogen dynamics within and among bat hosts. Pathogen spillover events are often associated with sharp increases, or pulses, in pathogen prevalence that vary in amplitude and timing [4] [5] [6] , but the mechanisms driving these pulses are unknown. Therefore, characterizing pulse variation across space and time, and identifying biotic and climatic factors associated with these pulses, will enhance our ability to predict and manage spillover [1, 7, 8] . Longitudinal studies across time and space are necessary to identify such factors [9, 10] , but such studies for wildlife zoonoses are rare. We use a longitudinal dataset of Hendra virus prevalence obtained across Eastern Australia to quantify seasonal, climatic and bat density effects on pulse characteristics.",

Although pteropopid bats of Australia were eventually identified as the natural reservoir hosts of Hendra virus [12] , spatiotemporal variation in Hendra virus prevalence and spillover has only recently been investigated. Recent studies suggest that Hendra virus prevalence peaks during winter months in subtropical Australia [6] ; however, it has not been determined whether this occurs periodically over time. Moreover, the synchrony of Hendra virus fluctuations and the effects of local climatic conditions on prevalence are unknown. Such information is however needed to develop predictions of disease incidence and spillover risk [13] [14] [15] .",

Most evidence suggests that variation in prevalence is explained by the relative abundances of spectacled (Pteropus conspicillatus) and black (Pteropus alecto) flying foxes [16] [17] [18] [19] . However, P. alecto is of particular concern because this species is widely distributed in coastal North Eastern Australia, and often forages in urban and peri-urban areas [20, 21] . P. alecto is also expanding its range southwards and permanently occupying urban habitats [20, 22] . Changes in bat abundance over areas with different levels of human development is important for disease management because such changes are likely to affect the frequency of Hendra virus outbreaks and spillover events [23] . To better assess these risks, it is therefore important to quantify how Hendra virus prevalence changes with the abundance of flying foxes.",

Environmental conditions that increase physiological stress, such as low food abundance [24] or extreme high or low temperatures [25] could favor viral reactivation and could therefore be correlated with the timing or magnitude of pulses. These hypotheses are not mutually exclusive but such patterns of spatiotemporal variation may provide inferences to help decipher the drivers of Hendra virus prevalence.",

To measure Hendra virus prevalence, Field et al. [6] collected urine from plastic sheets that were divided into quadrants and placed under bat roosts. Depending on roost size and accessibility, a variable number of sheets were utilized per roosts (see results). Urine was pooled from within each quadrant and quantitative PCR was used to determine the presence or absence of Hendra virus within each pooled sample. Thus, we define prevalence based on Hendra virus detection per pooled urine sample, rather than per individual bat. Pooled urine samples may have contained urine from up to four species of flying foxes. In the dataset, each pooled urine sample was thus associated with a roost location, a date, a sampling sheet and a quadrant within the sampling sheet [6] . The data also contain qualitative counts of bat species, P. alecto, Pteropus scapulatus, P. conspicillatus and Pteropus poliocephalus, roosting at the site. However, the effects of P. conspicillatus were not considered as this species occurs only in Northern Queensland and had small representations in the data (being present only in Cairns Central).",

Specifically, missing values were predicted by fitting a polynomial function of time that also considered the prevalence values of neighboring sites (when available) in the form of prior information [29] . These priors were thus built using the mean and variance in Hendra virus prevalence across sites, within 300 km (see Fig. 1 ). We used uninformative priors in cases where the variance in Hendra virus prevalence could not be calculated (i.e. when only one data point existed for a given date, or in cases where prevalence across all sites was 0). Our preliminary analyses showed that the prediction of numerous sequential missing values, such as those characteristic of 10 out of the 11 sites (the exception being Boonah) from July 2011 to January 2012, was poor ( Fig. 1) .

To test the effects of temperature, precipitation and bat abundance on Hendra virus pulse amplitude and timing, we used generalized mixed-effects models. For each location, we used average values of precipitation, minimum temperatures and maximum temperatures at four different times: (i) at the time of the pulse to test if immediate effects of climate explain pulse amplitude and timing; (ii) over the previous summer (December-March), (iii) over the previous spring (September-November) and (iv) over the previous winter (June-August). We used these climatic factors measured at previous times to quantify delayed effects of climate on pulse amplitude and timing. At the time of the pulse (i.e. scenario (i)), we also examined whether bat species density had an effect on the amplitude and the timing of the pulse. In each scenario, we fit either the pulse amplitude or pulse timing as response variables, with average precipitation, minimum temperature, maximum temperature and the natural log of bat density as explanatory fixed effects, and site and year of sampling as random effects. Notice that for these analyses, we only used measured prevalence data (i.e. we omitted predicted values). We used z-tests for statistical inference when modeling pulse amplitudes, and t tests when modeling pulse timings [35] .

At the intensively sampled Boonah roost, peaks in Hendra virus prevalence occurred with a 6-month period from Januuary 2013 to January 2014 ( Fig. 2) . Power spectra that suggested periodic signals over longer time frames were also found for Bellingen, Nambucca Heads and Wingham. However, in these cases, statistically significant power spectra (as described by the white contour lines within the figures) were either very localized (e.g. for Bellingen) or fell outside the cone of significance that delimits power spectrum values that are sensitive to edge effects (e.g. Nambucca Heads and Wingham). These results thus show little statistical evidence for long-term periodic signals in Hendra virus prevalence.

Although the largest annual pulse amplitudes tended to be clustered around winter months, the large variation in the timing of these pulses, and the lack of a recurring seasonal signal, suggest that seasonal factors (such as birth pulses, immigration and seasonal transmission) are not alone driving Hendra virus dynamics. We therefore suggest that variation in pulse amplitudes and timings occur because of combined effects of density-driven processes principally involving P. alecto, but also by density-independent factors. Low food availability, driven by climatic conditions that affect flowering, is a potential factor that could increase transmission or viral shedding via reduced immunocompetence. Alternatively, reduced rainfall could increase transmission by increasing contact rates between individuals aggregating around suitable habitats. Our analyses also showed that Hendra virus prevalence was only weakly correlated across sites and such correlations may be explained by the autocorrelation structure within the time series. Therefore, we suggest that site-specific prevalence values are determined by the climatic conditions and bat-virus dynamics occurring at small spatial scales.",

This may result from transmission, or specific patterns of clustering (i.e. species or age groups) within roosting sites. Species clustering could explain variation among sheets because Hendra virus prevalence was positively associated with P. alecto density, but negatively related to the density of P. scapulatus. It is important to note that while the protocol of collecting pooled urine excreted on sheets is logistically feasible and cost-effective, prevalence in pooled urine samples may be both clustered and overestimated if infected bats contribute to pooled urine multiple times. Nevertheless, increased P. alecto density was also associated with increased pulse amplitudes, suggesting that pulse characteristics are influenced by disease dynamics occurring in P. alecto populations. Field et al. [6] suggested that the negative association between P. scapulatus and Hendra virus prevalence was due to the dilution of positive samples by P. scapulatus urine, because Hendra virus has not been detected in the urine of this species. An additional hypothesis is that P. scapulatus density at a site indicates an increase in food availability because the presence of this species is also associated with flower blooms and nectar production [39] . Increased food availability may then reduce Hendra virus shedding by improving bat condition and immunocompetence. A third possibility is that prevalence in P. alecto may be reduced by high P. scapulatus abundance through a 'dilution effect' where higher bat species diversity lowers infection risk. [40] . However, more studies are required to understand such species-specific details of Hendra virus dynamics.",

These conclusions were drawn from visual examination of fitted spline trends to the data. We have built on these results to specifically test whether high amplitude pulses are a winter-only phenomenon. We did not find statistical support for annual or seasonal periodic signals using wavelet analyses. However, we found some evidence suggesting that the highest annual Hendra virus pulses occur in winter [6] , but this result only held after we removed one outlier datum (i.e. summer in Boonah, South East Queensland), which shows that there is variation both in the amplitude and the timing of Hendra virus pulses. This suggests that, although pulses may peak in winter, they can also peak in other seasons. This conclusion is partly supported by the recent spillover of Hendra virus in late November 2016 [41] , associated with an acute food shortage for bats (however, we did not have prevalence data for this spillover event). Thus, monitoring climatic conditions (such as precipitation), nectar availability and patterns of bat movement (as discussed below), may be important for predicting Hendra virus spillover events.",

In addition to hotter and drier conditions, climate change is predicted to increase the frequency of extreme weather events such as heat waves and tropical cyclones, which have been linked to increased bat mortality and high seroprevalence, respectively [24, 25] . Effective management of Hendra virus will therefore require quantifying the effects of density-dependent and density-independent conditions on transmission dynamics.",

The shaded area outside the cone delimits times that may suffer from edge effects in the calculation of the wavelet power spectrum and we therefore do not interpret the results from these areas. Bottom panels show prevalence as a function of time (red dots indicate predicted values).",
