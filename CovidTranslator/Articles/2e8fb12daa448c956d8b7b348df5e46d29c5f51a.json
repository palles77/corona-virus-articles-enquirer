            "text": "Human bocavirus 1 (HBoV1) is a parvovirus associated with respiratory tract infections (RTIs) in children, but a causal relation has not yet been confirmed. To develop a qualitative reverse transcription PCR to detect spliced mRNA from HBoV1 and to determine whether HBoV1 mRNA correlated better with RTIs than did HBoV1 DNA, we used samples from HBoV1 DNA-positive children, with and without RTIs, to evaluate the test. A real-time reverse transcription PCR, targeting 2 alternatively spliced mRNAs, was developed. HBoV1 mRNA was detected in nasopharyngeal aspirates from 33 (25%) of 133 children with RTIs but in none of 28 controls (p<0.001). The analytical sensitivity and specificity of the test were good. Our data support the hypothesis that HBoV1 may cause RTIs, and we propose that HBoV1 mRNA could be used with benefit, instead of HBoV1 DNA, as a diagnostic target.",

The virus does not grow in standard cell lines, and diagnosis has mainly been based on DNA detection with PCR. Detection of multiple viruses in HBoV1 DNA-positive airway samples from children with respiratory tract infections (RTIs) has been a characteristic finding in many studies (2) (3) (4) . In addition, many healthy children have tested positive for HBoV1 DNA (2, 5) ; thus whether the virus actually causes RTIs in children or is just a bystander to other infections has been debated. However, we have shown that the following 3 factors are associated with RTIs: HBoV1 viremia (HBoV1 DNAemia), a high HBoV1 DNA load in nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs), and monodection of HBoV1 DNA in NPAs (5) . In addition, RTIs in HBoV1 DNA-positive children are associated with HBoV1 seroconversion (6) . This evidence supports a causal relation between HBoV1 and RTIs in children, but DNA-based PCR tests do not seem to diagnose HBoV1 infection accurately. We propose that detection of HBoV1-specific mRNA, as a measure of actively transcribing virus, may be a better method.",

The estimated PCR product spanned a spliced segment from positions 241 to 2236 of the complete genome for HBoV1 (GenBank accession no. NC007455), which gives a theoretical PCR product of 242 bp and an alternative product, including a short segment from positions 2044 to 2164, yielding a product of 363 bp ( Figure 1 ). These estimations were based on in vitro studies performed by Chen et al. (7) . The probe targeting the untranslated region upstream of the nuclear phosphoprotein-1 gene had the following sequence: 5\u2032-FAM-TGTCCACCCAAGAAACGTCGTC-TAA-TAMRA-3\u2032 (positions 2295-2319). The PCR for every sample was also run without reverse transcription to test for potential unspecific reactions with viral DNA. The theoretical PCR product from HBoV1 DNA would be 2,236 bp in length, which is too long for amplification by real-time PCR under normal conditions. Total DNA and RNA were extracted by using Nu-cliSens easyMag extractor (bioM\u00e9rieux, Marcy l'Etoile, France), and reverse transcription was carried out with Universal RiboClone random primers (Promega, Fitchburg, WI, USA) and M-MLV Reverse Transcriptase (Life Technologies Corp., Carlsbad, CA, USA) at 37\u00b0C for 60 min. followed by 94\u00b0C for 10 min.

This was done to determine whether the stability of RNA in clinical NPA samples added to virus transport medium was comparable to the stability of RNA in nucleic acid extracts from the easyMag at this temperature. Relative changes in RNA load were measured by comparing logarithmically transformed cycle threshold values (Ct values) obtained from the same experiment.",

On admission, he had HBoV1 DNAemia and analysis of NPAs showed that he had 1) a high HBoV1 DNA load, 2) monodection of HBoV1 DNA, and 3) positive HBoV1 mRNA PCR results. He recovered slowly, and after 10 days a new NPA sample was taken. The HBoV1 DNA load was still high, but the results for the HBoV1 mRNA PCR were negative. Two months later, his NPAs still were positive for HBoV1 DNA and negative for HBoV1 mRNA. The other patients were two 1.5-year-old boys (boys 2 and 3), who had been included in an HMPV follow-up study. Their NPA samples became positive for HBoV1 DNA 1 week after HMPV infection was diagnosed. The initial samples were negative for HBoV1 DNA. The clinical condition was unaltered for both when HBoV1 DNA appeared. HBoV1 DNA loads reached moderate levels for boy 2 and high levels for boy 3, but for both boys, the PCRs were negative for HBoV1 mRNA in 2 consecutive NPA samples taken 5 days apart.

We found that HBoV1 mRNA correlated significantly better with RTIs in children than did HBoV1 DNA, indicating that this PCR may diagnose HBoV1 infection more accurately than PCR for HBoV1 DNA. Splicing is a process specific for mRNA synthesis, and with use of a primer pair spanning an intron, spliced viral mRNA should be specifically detected within the frame of the familiar and robust RT-PCR. This diagnostic technique has been used to diagnose parvovirus in dogs and may also be an option for diagnosing HBoV1 infections in humans (11) . Furthermore, detection of mRNA is routinely used for diagnosing human papillomavirus infections and has been studied for diagnosing human herpesvirus 6 and HIV infections (12) (13) (14) (15) . However, the mRNA tests for these viruses have been based on either specific mRNA extraction, nucleic acid sequence-based amplification technology, or pretreatment with DNase. The advantage with our approach is that no pretreatment, other than cDNA synthesis, is needed. The procedure is performed as a regular RT-PCR with standard equipment and will be easy to use in most routine laboratories. The analytical performance of the test was good with high analytical specificity and sensitivity.",

The PCR was designed so that the theoretical DNA product would be 2,236 bp-too large for amplification to occur in a regular, real-time PCR. For this reason, the PCR products were expected to result from recombination events. Gel and sequence analysis showed that all 3 products had different sizes, ranging from 145 to 457 bp. Moreover, no common sequence profiles were found near the gap junctions, which seemed to be located at random. Homologous recombination, a concentration-dependent process, may explain this phenomenon because it occurred only in NPA samples with extremely high levels of HBoV1 DNA. We speculate that the PCR products might have been subpopulations of nonviable HBoV1 mutants that appeared when virus replication was at its highest. However, the specificity of the test was not affected because it happened only in patients with very high viral DNA loads and strong HBoV1 mRNA signals.",

None of the children without RTIs had detectable HBoV1 mRNA. Because mRNA is a marker of active viral transcription, this finding indicates that the 28 asymptomatic children carried inactive HBoV1 or HBoV1 with low activity. The strong association found between active HBoV1 transcription and RTI in children supports the hypothesis that HBoV1 may cause RTIs. The hypothesis is further supported by the associations found between HBoV1 mRNA and the 3 factors: HBoV1 DNAemia, high HBoV1 DNA load in NPAs, and monodection of HBoV1 DNA-all factors strongly related to RTIs in children (5, 6, 19) .

            "text": "Previously, HBoV1 has been found to persist in NPAs for many months (21) (22) (23) . The molecular basis for this persistence is largely unknown, but 2 recent studies have given evidence in support of persistent circular HBoV episomes (24) (25) (26) . The NPA samples in our study which were negative for HBoV1 mRNA and positive for HBoV1 DNA could be from patients with past HBoV1 infections who were still shedding viral DNA. Boy 1, who was followed up during winter 2011-12, may illustrate this. Results of PCR on NPA samples from this boy were positive for HBoV mRNA only for a short period (<10 days), coinciding with the acute symptomatic infection, whereas HBoV1 DNA persisted for months. An alternative hypothesis might be that the samples negative for HBoV1 mRNA and positive for HBoV1 DNA were from children with a latent HBoV1 infection. The findings in boys 2 and 3, who were followed up during the same winter, may support this hypothesis. HBoV1 DNA in NPAs appeared during an ongoing HMPV infection in both children, but results of PCR for HBoV1 mRNA remained negative in 2 consecutive samples. The lack of detectable HBoV1 mRNA may indicate that HBoV1 did not play a role in these infections. Release of latent HBoV1 DNA from cells disrupted by inflammation caused by HMPV may be a better explanation. More longitudinal studies, including serologic analyses, are needed to further study these relationships. \u2020Triple and quadruple infections were common, and percentages within the columns may therefore add up to >100%.",
