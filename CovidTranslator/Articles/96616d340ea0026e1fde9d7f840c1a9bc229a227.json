            "text": "To understand the pathogenesis of the virus, investigations have been underway in order to uncover the molecular mechanisms involved. Basically, all rotaviruses cause the destruction of columnar absorptive cells on the villus tips of the small intestine leading to the development of profuse diarrhoea. This observation helped to formulate the hypothesis that rotaviruses require trypsin for enhancement of infectivit~y [4] [5] [6] . In addition, it pointed to the fact that rotaviruses have a relatively specific cell tropism. The molecular mechanism involved in the latter function has been identified as the cleavage of VP4, at a specific site, to produce two polypeptides fragments VP5* (approximately 60 k) and VP8* (approximately 28 k). Recently it has been demonstrated that monoclonal antibody directed against VP8* can inhibit binding of rotavirus particles to cells in vitro [7] , indicating that VP8 cleavage product contains an important epitope(s) involved in virus-cell interaction. In addition VP8* portion of VP4 has been found to contain hemagglutinin [8] . We have demonstrated that a peptide corresponding to the trypsin cleavage site (amino acid 232 255) can induce heterotypic protection in vivo [9] . Furthermore, pre-treatment of cells with this peptide before infection with rotavirus prevented both the attachment of 35S-labelled virus and plaque formation and intragastric administration of the peptide protected neonatal mice from challenge with virulent rotavirus [10] .",

Lanes C, D, and corresponding immunoblots C' and D' illustrate that this antiserum also detects this site in the MRV-VP4.

Under these conditions, most of the virus is converted to the single-shelled form. When MRV was incubated under the same conditions, very little glycoprotein was removed from the particles. However, if MRV was incubated in 50 mM EDTA-0.01 M Tris-HC1, pH 8.0, instead of pH 7.4, most of the glycoproteins were removed (Fig. 3A, lane 3-4) . CaC12 treatment of EDTA-treated BRV solubilized nucleocapsid protein at both pH levels (Fig. 3B, lane 2) . These preparations contain little or no contaminating capsid proteins.

[19] that the gene coding for this protein plays a major role in conferring virulence on the virus. In addition in vivo studies using BRV with replaced gene 4 from MRV confirmed this [12, 23] (Tables 1 and 2 ). Analysis of BRV-and MRV-VP4 by carboxypeptidase digestion revealed only one region of heterogeneity between these two viruses in the area spanning amino acids 307 and 407. However, it should be pointed out that the difference between the two isolates can not only be in the area spanning amino acid 307 and 407 and that the analysis of sequence data on gene 4 of both isolates might reveal other site(s) as well. Therefore, confirmation of the differences in potential virulence sites located on gene 4 of both isolates will have to wait till MRV-gene 4 sequence data becomes available. For now, it appears that there are at least two factors which may account for the increased virulence of MRV. The first one is the increased stability of MRV, which may be a consequence of the observed differences in the outer shell proteins of MRV when compared to BRV [33, 34, 37, 38] . The second factor is a specific difference in the primary structure of VP4 which may provide the molecular basis for the increased stability and consequently the increased virulence. Alternatively, the stability and virulence determinant may define two different strategies for conferring virulence on rotaviruses. The MRV has also been shown to be extremely stable in the environment [24] as compared to other human and animal rotavirus isolates explaining the difficulty in keeping rodent's colonies rotavirus-free and preventing nosocomial rotavirus infection [20, [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] .",

In spite of these studies, the subject is still open for controversy. Recently, Broome et al. [31] have reported that VP4 as well as the other two major rotavirus proteins, VP6 and VP7 are not associated with virulence. However, they did not provide sufficient experimental evidence to demonstrate which other gene(s) product(s) are involved in virulence determination. Based on their limited experimental data they have speculated that either gene 5 and/or 2 may be involved in rotavirus virulence determination. It will be interesting to see what data they obtain in their proposed follow up studies.",

Panel 2 illustrates the digest pattern of BRV-VP4 in its reduced form (lanes A and C) and MRV-VP4 in its reduced form (lane B and D). Lanes A and B represent digestion patterns generated after exposure to 10/~g papain, lanes C and D represent digestion patterns generated after exposure to 5.0 l~g S. aureus V8 protease. different rotaviruses Nishikawa et al. [32] observed that the VP4 of standard strain of Nebraska calf diarrhoea virus (NCDV) which is virulent for cows differed in only one amino acid (position 23, Gln to Lys) from the VP4 of an NCDV mutant which was attenuated both for cows and for children which further underline the role played by gene 4 in determining rotavirus virulence. In our studies, however, both of the rotavirus isolates used, replicate very well in the murine system and virus isolated from neonatal mice can be assayed in vitro in cell culture [12] . Furthermore, our reassortants where only gene 4 was replaced, exhibited a pattern of virulence corresponding to the parents from which the gene 4 was derived (Table 1) .",
