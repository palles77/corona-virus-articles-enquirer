Additionally, we tested serum samples from shepherds and abattoir workers with occupational exposure to camels. Samples were screened by recombinant ELISA and MERS-CoV seropositivity was confi rmed by recombinant immunofl uorescence and plaque reduction neutralisation tests. We used two-tailed Mann Whitney U exact tests, \u03c7\u00b2, and Fisher's exact tests to analyse the data. ",

Camel milk as a foodborne source seems unlikely. 8 For secondary infections acquired through human-tohuman contact, mathematical projections predicted that transmission chains in the population cannot be sustained. 9-11 The apparent transmission rate in household settings is low, with fewer than 50% of index patients transmitting the infection to contacts who subsequently had no pronounced clinical symptoms. 12 in people, in terms of replication in cell culture, immune escape, or excretion level. 13 Undiscovered MERS-CoV infections might thus exist in the human population.",

To have optimum sample coverage per province, we included samples from an earlier study (unpublished report) for which detailed information about sex and age was not available for 26% of samples. Nevertheless, samples from both subcohorts should be similar in age and sex composition because both were previously obtained according to calculations by the National Census Bureau to represent the composition of the Saudi Arabian population. This similarity was lent support by the highly similar seroprevalence when we analysed both subcohorts separately.

In accordance with our previous study, 12 seropositivity with rELISA was ten times higher than that with rIFA. 12 This rise can be attributed to the higher sensitivity of rELISA and by putative crossreactivity of low-affi nity IgG, which is raised in individuals with recent infections from the common-cold coronavirus. 23 Despite low detection rates, antibodies were identifi ed widely across Saudi Arabia, including in provinces where outbreaks in people have not been reported. Widespread acquisition of infections without subsequent causation of outbreaks corresponds to the concept of a predominantly zoonotic disease that does not readily spread between human beings. The raised prevalence in rural regions and the signifi cantly increased proportion of infection in groups that are occupationally exposed to camels emphasises the importance of zoonotic acquisitions by dromedary camels. 5-7 However, even though the analysed shepherd samples were collected in six diff erent regions during the fi rst months of 2014, the sampling was not randomised and samples were not strictly taken at the same time as those from the general population. Similar limitations apply for the slaughterhouse worker samples. Direct comparison of seroprevalences between these groups and the general population cohort might thus be biased.

These subclinical infections could act as an unknown source for index patients who cannot recall contact with camels. Importantly, the predominance of men even within serologically confi rmed cases emphasises a potential association with animal exposure because, typically, more men than women in Saudi Arabia associate with camels during leisure activities. Cases of MERS in younger people (aged <45 years) might seem mild or even subclinical, similar to cases in our study of household contact clusters, 12 in which contacts were younger than index patients and mostly asymptomatic.
