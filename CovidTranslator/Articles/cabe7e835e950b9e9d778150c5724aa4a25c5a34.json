In this study, 25/129 (19.4 %) domestic pig and 1/146 (0.7 %) wild boar fecal samples tested in South Korea were positive for PAstV. Positive samples were mainly from pigs under 6 weeks old. Bayesian inference (BI) tree analysis for RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and capsid (ORF2) gene sequences, including Mamastrovirus and Avastrovirus, revealed a relatively geographically divergent lineage. The PAstVs of Hungary and America belong to lineage PAstV 4; those of Japan belong to PAstV 1; and those of Canada belong to PAstV 1, 2, 3, and 5, but not to 4. This study revealed that the PAstVs of Korea belong predominantly to lineage PAstV 4 and secondarily to PAstV 2. It was also observed that PAstV infections are widespread in South Korea regardless of the disease state in domestic pigs and in wild boars as well.",

In South Korea, there have been studies done on astrovirus but were only limited to its detection in human infection. There has been no attempt yet to know the extent of astrovirus infection in the pig population of the country.

The primer pairs used in this study were P1 (TTCTGA GTCA CGAACAGCCA, 1466-1485) and P2 (CATATG CAGCCTGCTCTGAA, 2097-2116) for the S gene of PEDV, T1 (GTGGTTTTGGTYRTAAATGC, [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] and T2 (CACTAACCAACGTGGARCTA, 855-874) for the S gene of TGEV, and rot3 (AAAGATGCTAGGGACAAA ATTG, 57-78) and rot5 (TTCAGATTGT GGAGCTA TTCCA, 344-365) for the segment 6 region of group A Rotavirus. The sizes of the expected products of multiplex RT-PCR were 859 bp for TGEV, 651 bp for PEDV, and 309 bp for rotavirus, which could be differentiated by agarose gel electrophoresis.",

Only one wild boar which is coming from the province of Gyunggi tested positive for PAstV (0.7 %, 1/146). The low prevalence of PAstV in wild boars might have been due to the fact that usually older animals (over 1 year old) have lesser susceptibility to infection and generally wild pigs are more resistant to many diseases than the domesticated ones.",

The low or no incidence of PAstV in Gyunggi A (growing-finishing pigs) and Gyungsang (sows) can likewise be attributed to the lesser susceptibility of adult pigs to infection. The proportion of non-diarrheic and diarrheic pig fecal samples was 14.0 % (18/129) and 6.2 % (8/129), respectively. These results suggest that PAstV is widespread in South Korea regardless of the disease status (with or without clinical manifestations) of pigs. Although Astroviruses are highly prevalent in young pigs and are mostly present in diarrheic pigs, PAstV is a common finding as well in the fecal samples of apparently healthy pigs [21, 22] . The clinical significance of PAstV infection remains to be clarified.",
