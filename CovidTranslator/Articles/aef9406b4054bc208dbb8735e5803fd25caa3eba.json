Electronic medical records of children diagnosed with meningitis caused by S. pneumoniae and all-cause pneumonia, and acute otitis media (AOM) between January 2013-April 2014 were retrospectively evaluated. Direct costs for the treatments of hospitalized patients (pneumonia and pneumococcal meningitis) including costs of healthcare services consisted of costs of hospital bed, examination, laboratory analyses, scanning methods, consultation, vascular access procedures, and infusion and intravenous treatments. Direct costs for patients (AOM) treated in outpatient setting included constant price paid for the examination and cost of prescribed antibiotics. Indirect costs included cost of work loss of parents and their transportation expenses. Data of 130 children with pneumococcal meningitis (n D 10), pneumonia (n D 53), and AOM (n D 67) were analyzed. The total median cost was \u20ac4,060.38 (direct cost: \u20ac3,346.38 and indirect cost: \u20ac829.18) for meningitis, \u20ac835.91 (direct cost: \u20ac480.66 and indirect cost: \u20ac330.09) for pneumonia, and \u20ac117.32 (direct cost: \u20ac17.59 and indirect cost: \u20ac99.73) for AOM. The medication cost (p D 0.047), indirect cost (p D 0.032), and total cost (p D 0.011) were significantly higher in pneumonia patients aged 36 months than those aged <36 months; however, direct cost of AOM were significantly higher in the patients aged <36 months (p D 0.049). Results of the present study revealed that the treatment cost was significantly enhanced for hospitalization and for advanced disease. Thus, preventive actions, mainly vaccination, should be conducted regularly. KEYWORDS children; economic burden; pneumococcal infections; vaccine CONTACT Yasemin Ozsurekci",

While case fatality rate of pneumococcal meningitis was reported as 48% in hospitalized children in Gambia, 5 this rate has been reported as high as 20% in developed countries. 6 According to the results of a study evaluating the global disease burden of pneumonia in children under the age of 5 years, pneumococcal diseases accounted for approximately 11% of overall deaths. 1 Further analyses of the same study revealed that the mortality rate was 119 (87-130) per 100,000 and the case-fatality rate was 5% (4%-9%) for pneumococcal pneumonia; however, for pneumococcal meningitis, the case-fatality rate was as high as 59% (27%-80%) despite the mortality rate of 10 (4-13) per 100,000. Within the European region (including Turkey) identified by WHO, the mortality rate was 25 (18-28) per 100,000 and the case-fatality rate was 5% (4%-9%) for pneumococcal pneumonia, whereas these rates were 3 (2-4) per 100,000 and 38% (32%-58%), respectively, for pneumococcal meningitis. The differences in quality and accessibility of healthcare services may create differences between countries.",

The same report also stated that pneumonia is the second leading cause of mortality by 14% among lower respiratory tract infections. In addition to direct and indirect costs arising from the treatments of these diseases, years of life lost due to mortality also lead to a substantial burden on health-related economic outcomes. Although treatment of these diseases prevents an important portion of resulting mortality, the ratio of DALY caused by these diseases to overall DALY is 12.6 for 0-14 year age group. 12 In the light of these data, it is obvious that pneumococcal diseases lead to a substantial burden on health and economic systems of Turkey in terms of economic cost and morbidity as well as mortalityrelated costs. In the present study, among pneumococcal infections, the highest total cost was estimated for the treatment of pneumococcal meningitis by \u20ac4,060.38 per patient followed by pneumonia by \u20ac835.91 per patient and AOM by \u20ac117.32 per patient. There is a gap of economic burden studies in this area. In a study which evaluated the economic burden of childhood pneumococcal diseases in the Gambia, the median (interquartile range) total societal cost of inpatient pneumonia was US$87.0 (US$63.0-US$129.7) per patient. 13 In Korea, a nationally representative cross-sectional study evaluated the economic burden of otitis media in 2012 reported the total cost of otitis media in 0-9 year age group as 257.87 million Dollars in the outpatient setting. 14 Since there are differences in health policies as well as in national economies of the countries, these results are not comparable.",

The introduction of PCVs has been associated with a significant reduction both in invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) and mucosal pneumococcal diseases in many countries. Following the introduction of PCV13 in the USA, IPD incidence decreased by 91% in children below 2 years of age due to the additional 6 serotypes. 15 In the UK, IPD due to PCV13-only serotypes decreased by 89% after the PCV13 National Immunization Program in children below 2 years of age as compared with the pre-PCV13 periods. 16 In Southern Israel, sequential implementation of PCV7 and PCV13 was associated with decreases in otitis media caused by PCV7 serotypes plus serotype 6A and then by 5 additional PCV13 serotypes (5VT: 1, 3, 5, 7F, 19A) by 96% and 85% in the respective periods. 17 The present study has also some limitations. Firstly, being a single center study is one of the limitations. Secondly, the pneumonia cases included in this study were not proven to be caused by S. pneumoniae; thus, lobar pneumonia cases were aimed to be included as they best represent pneumococcal pneumonia. Thirdly, only hospitalized patients with pneumonia were included. However, if non-hospitalized pneumonia patients were also included, contributory outcomes could be provided both in clinical and economic impact of vaccination. Despite these limitations, this study provides useful insights into economic burden of pneumococcal infections in children (0-5 years old) considering that there is very limited data in this area especially in Turkey. Therefore, further cost studies are needed, particularly in children, to set forth the economic burden of pneumococcal infections.",

Children who were diagnosed with pneumonia after 48 hours of hospitalization and were hospitalized 2 days or more within the last 90 days were excluded. The study was approved by the Non-Interventional Clinical Research Ethics Board of Hacettepe University (Approval number: GO 14/290-22). Direct costs for hospitalized patients with meningitis due to S. pneumoniae and with pneumonia included the costs of healthcare services, medications, and materials. Costs of healthcare services consisted of costs of hospital bed, examination, laboratory analyses, scanning methods, consultation, vascular access procedures, and infusion and intravenous treatments. Data regarding costs of healthcare services were obtained from Hacettepe University Hospital, which uses the unit prices indicated in the National Health Practices Statement (HPS) Appendix-2B (UPDATED Statement of Changes 2013 HPS, dated August 30, 2014). 18 Medication costs were determined based on the prices stated on the hospital invoice. Costs of materials consisted of consumables which were used over the course of hospital stay. Since the etiology of pneumonia cannot be accurately estimated as it is technically difficult, 19 the costs for pneumococcal pneumonia were calculated using overall pneumonia cases. Among the overall pneumonia cases, lobar pneumonia cases were selected for cost calculation as they best represented pneumococcal pneumonia. Since the etiology of AOM cases were not known as well, direct costs for overall AOM treated in outpatient setting were calculated according to package pricing -the price paid to Pediatric Infection and Ear Nose Throat outpatient clinics by the Social Security Institution-which included costs of laboratory analyses, drugs used during examination, and the examination fee. The costs for patients requiring ventilation tube insertion due to AOM were calculated separately. Likewise, the costs for patients who developed hearing loss as a complication of AOM were also calculated separately.",

The average monthly gross earnings (\u20ac774.14) obtained from the Labor Cost Survey 2012 conducted by Turkish Statistical Institute (TurkStat) were used as the basis of the calculation. 20 According to the data from TurkStat, labor force participation rate in February 2014 was 70.0% among males and 28.7% among females. 21 The rate of employment was adjusted to 90% in fathers and 41% in mothers. 22 Daily earnings were determined to be \u20ac23.23 (\u20ac774.14 \u00a3 0.90/30 days) for fathers and \u20ac10.58 [(\u20ac774.14 \u00a3 0.41)/30 days] for mothers. According to the assumptions based on an expert opinion, mothers were assumed to be the primary caretakers and were therefore considered to accrue work loss over the course of a child's hospital stay. The fathers were assumed to have one day of work loss per week over the course of a child's hospital stay. The parents were also supposed to come for the control visits together and thus, it was assumed one day of work loss at each control visit. Workforce losses of the mothers and fathers were calculated by multiplying aforementioned earnings by the number of days of work loss. Expenses for round trip to hospital were calculated by multiplying the number round trips to hospital by \u20ac4.59. 23 It was assumed that the fathers had a round trip to hospital every day over the course of his child's hospital stay and that 5 more round trips to hospital arose from mothers making 1 trip to the hospital on the first day of hospitalization and 1 trip from the hospital on the day of discharge and from both mothers and fathers making 4 round trips to the hospital for two control visits after discharge. All costs were expressed in Euros according to the 2014 currency of Turkish Liras (\u20ac1.00 D 2.9 Turkish Liras, without inflation adjustment). The probabilistic sensitivity analysis was performed to assess the robustness of the indirect cost estimates, including costs for total round trips and workforce losses of the mothers and fathers, for each disease and the sensitivity analysis range value was \u00a725% of the base value.",
