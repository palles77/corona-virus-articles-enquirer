Abnormalities associated with hepatic disease include I. Increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT)-ALT is considered to be liver specific in dogs and cats. Increases are seen with hepatocellular necrosis and inflammation, increased hepatocyte membrane permeability, cholestasis, and production by regenerating hepatocytes during resolution on an initial injury \u2022 Medications such as anticonvulsant drugs and corticosteroids, or hyperadrenocorticism, can result in mild to moderate (2-lOx normal) increases in ALT levels. \u2022 Severe skeletal muscle injury may cause increases in ALT levels of 5-25x normal. b. Increased aspartate aminotransferase (AST)-AST is not liver specific in dogs and cats. It is also present in significant quantities in skeletal muscle. c. Increased alkaline phosphatase (ALP)-Increases in ALP are a result of cholestasis or drug induction. Liver, bone, and corticosteroid-induced isoenzymes are reflected in measurement of serum ALP levels \u2022 Mild increases occur in young animals or animals with severe bone disease. \u2022 Small increases in serum ALP levels in cats suggest significant cholestasis. \u2022 The corticosteroid-induced isoenzyme does not occur in cats.\u2022 Anticonvulsant drug therapy in dogs, but not in cats, can also increase serum levels of ALP. d. Increased gamma glutamyltransferase (GGT)-Increases in GGT indicate cholestasis and increased production by hepatocytes. GGT levels usually resembles ALP levels, except in cats, in which GGTactivity usually exceeds ALP activity.Mild increases (2-3x normal) in GGTmay be related to anticonvulsant drug therapy. e. Increased serum bilirubin concentration-Can be due to either hemolysis or cholestasis. Check the CBC.r. Hypoalbuminemia indicates chronic hepatic disease and a reduction of 70-80% of the functional hepatic mass. I. Decreased BUN concentration may occur because of impaired hepatic ability to convert ammonia to urea. A decreased BUN can also occur in patients on a low-protein diet, those receiving fluid diuresis, and patients with PU/Po. h. Hypoglycemia may occur secondary to decreased hepatic glycogen stores, impaired hepatic gluconeogenesis, and decreased hepatic insulin degradation. However, severe liver dysfunction must be present. Except in dogs and cats with congenital portosystemic shunts, hypoglycemia indicates a poor prognosis. Other causes of hypoglycemia, including sepsis, insulinoma and hypoadrenocorticism, should be ruled out. 4. A coagulation panel should be evaluated.

If there is a transient response to antibiotic therapy, administer prednisone, 1.1 mg/kg q24-48h, in addition to antibiotics. However, glucocorticoid therapy should be reserved as a last resort, as some cases may be worsened. 4. Ursodeoxycholic acid (Actigale) may be beneficial for patients with cholangiohepatitis with biliary stasis and inspissated bile I. The dose ofursodeoxycholic acid is 10-15 mg/kg q24h or 5-7.5 mg/kg q12h. b. Most cats will eat the medication when it is mixed with their food. c. Discontinue the administration of prednisone. d. Do not administer ursodeoxycholic acid to a patient that may have an extrahepatic bile duct obstruction. 5. Furosemide may be beneficial to reduce ascites. 6. Enalapril, 0.125-0.25 mg/kg PO q12-24h, may also be beneficial to reduce ascites. Intravenous fluids and other symptomatic therapy should be administered based on the needs of the individual patient. Vitamin K!, 5 mg/cat SC or PO q12-48h, may be beneficial ifthe patient exhibits signs of a coagulopathy. Nutritional support e. Cats without signs of hepatic encephalopathy should be fed a diet of 30-40% protein. A balanced, high-protein maintenance diet is sufficient. b. Cats with signs of hepatic encephalopathy require a reduced protein diet suchas boiled rice and cottage cheese or Hill's Prescription Feline k/d\u00ae.c. If the cat is anoretic or vomiting, the appropriate feeding tube may be placed.",

            "text": "The etiology is often idiopathic. table food or treats from the table, vomiting, diarrhea, anorexia, restlessness, panting, trembling, weakness, and abdominal pain. Pancreatitis occurs most commonly in the middle-aged to older overweight dog, with females showing a slight predisposition, but may occur in any dog and in cats.In cats with pancreatitis, the signs are usually subtle and include anorexia and weight loss, with or without vomiting. Cholangitis/cholangiohepatitis often occurs concurrently to feline pancreatitis. Physical exam-The patient may have a fever and a depressed mental attitude. There may be signs of dehydration. The patient may assume an unnatural, 'praying', posture or a hunched-up abdomen. There may be pain detected upon palpation of the cranioventral abdomen which may vary from mild to intense. Diarrhea may be present and may be hemorrhagic. A mass may be palpable in the right cranial abdomen. Jaundice, arrhythmias, or external signs of hemorrhage, including petechiae or ecchymoses, may be evident. Laboratory evaluation-1. CBC\u2022. The CBC may reveal a neutrophilic leukocytosis, with or without a left shift. b. Neutropenia with a degenerative left shift may be seen in patients with severe 182 pancreatic necrosis, sepsis, or endotoxemia.c. An elevated PCv, due to dehydration, is common. A USG > 1.025 indicates adequate renal tubular function and helps to rule out advanced renal disease. Ketones and glucose in the urine may indicate concurrent diabetic ketoacidosis. 4. Blood gas analysis-Metabolic acidosis is the most common acid-base disturbance, although acid-base status is unpredictable and should be evaluated in each individual patient. 5. Coagulation profile-A prolonged ACT, prolonged PTT, prolonged PT, increased FSPs, decreased fibrinogen, elevated D-dimer level,and thrombocytopenia indicate DIe. 8. Serum trypsin-like immunoreactivity (TLI) assay is specific for pancreatic disease. Elevations in TLI (> 35 ug/I) are associated with acute pancreatitis. Measurement of TLI in dogs must be done very early in the course of the disease process, because the half-life is short and it tends to rise early in the course of the disease and then rapidly decline. J. Analysis of peritoneal fluid may indicate an intra-abdominal infection. Abdominal radiographs may reveal an increased density and loss of abdominal detail and contrast in the right cranial quadrant of the abdomen. A ground glass appearance indicates the presence of peritonitis. The descending segment of the duodenum may be displaced to the right and the pyloric antrum may be displaced to the left on ventrodorsal views. The duodenum may be displaced ventrally on lateral views. Ileus in the duodenum or transverse colon and gastric distension may be observed. Barium passage from the stomach and through the duodenum may be delayed. Thoracic radiographs-These may reveal pleural effusion or pulmonary edema. Abdominal ultrasonography-This may reveal irregular pancreatic enlargement and a decreased or mottled pancreatic echogenicity. Pancreatic cavitary lesions, such as pseudocysts and abscesses, may be observed. Abdominal effusion may be observed. In patients with concurrent hepatic disease, obstruction of the common bile duct may be seen.Complications and sequelae 1. Acute complications 8. Hypovolemic and endotoxic shock may be indicated by hypothermia, collapse, and circulatory shock. \u2022. If the patient is in shock, administer the flulds at the following rates \u2022 Canine: 90-100 ml/kg first one to two hours.\u2022 Feline: 45-60 ml/kg first one to two hours.\u2022 After the first one to two hours, re-evaluate the patient's cardiovascular status. Generally decrease the rate to 20-40 ml/kg/h in dogs and 20-30 ml/kg/h in cats until the patient is stabilized. Continue at maintenance rates (1-2 ml/kg/h) when stable. b. If the patients is in severe shock, administer 7.5% NaCI,4-5 ml/ kg IVfor dogs. and 2 ml/kg IVfor cats, over 2-5 min (4 ml/kg for dogs with head trauma).c. If the patient is in severe shock, administer Hetastarch or Dextran 70, 20 ml/kg IV. An additional 20 ml/kg of Hetastarch may be administered over the next 6-8 h if needed for continued shock. 184 II. Consider the administration of plasma. 10-20 ml/kg IV. ifthe serum albumin is < 2.0 g/dl and also to replace antiproteases (alpha'<macroglobulins) that are depleted in pancreatitis. 8. Consider the administration of a hemoglobin-based oxygen carrier (Oxyglobin\", 15-30 mllkg IVfor dogs, 5-20 mllkg administered in 5 mllkg increments for cats), red blood cells (I I mil kg, 5 millb) or whole blood (22 mlllb, 10 ml/Ib) if the patient is in severe shock or in hemorrhagic shock. For blood components, perform a cross match and administer blood components through a filter. Oxyglobinw does not require filtration. 5. For rehydration and maintenance, administer intravenous crystalloid fluids at the rate of60 mllkg/24 h for dogs and 40 mllkg/24 h for cats, plus the deficit plus losses. 6. Supplement potassium as indicated by the serum potassium level. 1. Administer broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy 8. Administer a combination of ampicillin (20-40 mg/kg q8h IV), or a firstgeneration cephalosporin (cefazolin (20 mg/kg q8h IV) or cephalothin (20-30 mg/kg q6h IV)), with a fluoroquinolone (enrofloxacin (5-15 mg/kg IV q12h, 5-20 mg/kg IVq24h), ciprofloxacin (5-15 mg/kg PO q12h, 10-20 mg/kg PO q24h)), with an aminoglycoside (amikacin (3.5-5 mg/kg q8h IV or 10-15 mg/kg q24h IV, gentamicin (6-9 mg/kg IVq24h or 2-3 mg/kg q8h IV), or tobramycin (2-4 mg/kg q8h, q24h IV)), or a third-generation cephalosporin (ceftizoxime (25-50 mg/kg IV, 1M, SCq6-8h) , cefotaxime (2Q-80 mg/kg IV, 1M qb-Bhl), and metronidazole, 10 mg/kg IVCRIover 1 h, q8-12h \u2022 Aminoglycosides should be avoided in the presence of dehydration or azotemia as they may cause renal failure. \u2022 Aminoglycosides administered once every 24 h are more effective and cause less renal toxicity. \u2022 If furosemide is utilized, aminoglycosides should be discontinued, as the combination increases the risk of inducing iatrogenic renal failure. \u2022 When the patient is on aminoglycosides, urine sediment should be evaluated at least daily for casts and cellular debris. \u2022 The penicillins have been combined with a~-lactamase inhibitor (ticarcillin-clavulanate (Tirnentin\", 30-50 mg/kg IV q6-8h), ampicillinsublactam (l.lnasyn\", 50 mg/kg IVq6-8h) , and piperacillin-tazobactam (Zosyn\", 50 mg/kg IV, 1M q4-6hl for increased efficacy). b. Administer a combination of cefoxitin (40 mg/kg IVinitially and continued at 20 mg/kg IV q6-8h in the dog and q8h in the cat) and metronidazole ( ",
