SARS has resulted in unprecedented apprehension in the local community and severe economic harm to local business and tourism. More importantly, it has challenged health care workers to use effective infection control measures. In the present article, we will discuss the infection control guidelines for the anesthesiologist that were adopted by our institution, the rationale behind them and the impact of the SARS outbreak on anesthesiologists in Toronto.",

On returning to Toronto on February 23, she stayed in her apartment, which she shared with family members. Two days later, she became ill and died at home on March 5, 2003 . Several of the family subsequently developed respiratory symptoms. The 43-yr-old son was admitted to the emergency department of a community hospital in Scarborough that became the epicentre of the Toronto outbreak. By the end of April, 262 SARS cases (143 probable, 119 suspected) and 21 deaths had been reported in Ontario, the majority in the GTA. 6 All these cases could be traced back to the original index patient. On April 23, WHO issued a travel advisory warning for Toronto, which was removed one week later. On May 14, Toronto was removed from the list of areas affected by SARS as no new probable case had been reported since April 19. However, another cluster of SARS patients was discovered on May 23, 2003. 7 The second cluster was traced to a 96-yr-old man who underwent surgery for a fractured pelvis in a hospital in North York on April 19. While in hospital he developed SARS but it was managed as postoperative pneumonia. He infected several other patients in his ward, including a woman who was later transferred to a rehabilitation hospital. This resulted in a further 118 cases in the GTA as of July 10, 2003. 1 Eventually, on July 2, WHO removed Toronto from the list of areas with recent local transmissions.",

Health organizations and agencies such as WHO, 25 This guideline applies to all surgical patients and is based on long-standing recommendations by Health Canada that masks and eye protection or face shields should be worn where appropriate to protect the mucous membranes of the eyes, nose and mouth during procedures and patient care activities likely to generate splashes or sprays of blood, body fluids, secretions or excretions. 29 For practical purposes, the anesthetic machine is considered 'dirty' and the anesthetic drug cart as 'clean'. The machine is usually the first area anesthesiologists touch after contact with the patient. A large container is positioned on the anesthesia machine in which all airway equipment (laryngoscope blade and handle, mask, suction catheter, etc.) is placed after use. The container and its contents are removed from the OR as soon as possible following intubation. The contents are separated for cleaning, sterilization or disposal before they are returned to the OR. A second set of equipment including clean masks, laryngoscope handles and blades is immediately available. All steps are taken to keep the anesthesia drug cart 'clean'. The cart is used only after hand-washing or removal of the outer pair of gloves. Thus, the infection control team should be informed about the transfer route. The spread of respiratory droplets from the infected patient should be minimized by the patient wearing a N95 mask without an expiratory valve. Staff involved in the transfer and the care of patients in the OR should take full droplet/contact precautions. Clean surgical scrub suits laundered by the hospital should be worn and personalized hats or hair covers are avoided. The rationale for using alcohol-based hand rub, N95 masks, gowns, gloves and powered respirators in the OR has been reviewed recently. 9 Because the SARS-CoV virus is spread by droplets and can survive on inanimate objects for 48 hr, extra precautions and vigilance are important to avoid contaminating anesthesia equipment or surfaces such as the telephone in the OR. Double gloves are recommended when handling SARS patients. The outer pair is removed after direct patient contact and before touching equipment or furniture in other areas of the room.",

            "text": "Of the precautions recommended above, the use of personal protection systems (PPS) may be the most unfamiliar for anesthesiologists. Although it is not currently recommended by Health Canada, 27 hospitals in Ontario are using PPS according to the directive from the Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care of Ontario to all Ontario Acute Care Hospitals for high-risk procedures. 28 The PPS adopted in our institution is the powered air-purifying respirator (PAPR 3M, Berkshire, UK) system while other hospitals have purchased the Stryker\u00ae T4 (Stryker, Kalamazoo, MI, USA) PPS. No consensus has been reached regarding which has the better air filtration system. Nonetheless, these systems are considered to be important barriers to protect health care workers during high-risk procedures such as intubation and extubation. The PAPR consists of a beltmounted powered air purifier with a high efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter, connected via a tube to a lightweight headpiece (Figures 1 and 2) . The HEPA filter removes particles of 0.3 to 15 \u00b5 with an efficiency of 98 to 100%. 30 The lightweight hood or headpiece provides excellent coverage of the head, face and neck. We have several years experience in using the PAPR system in the bronchoscopy suite without disease transmission to health-care workers. There are several important clinical points to remember. First, it takes time, training and assistance to put on the personal protective equipment and the PAPR system properly. Advance warning of a patient in need of tracheal intubation is required in order to prepare properly. Second, the personal protective equipment must be removed in proper sequence to avoid contamination of the users. Third, it is difficult to communicate with each other due to the noise generat-ed by the high flow through the PAPR system. This noisy environment may cause errors due to its potential for miscommunication.",

Il acc\u00e8de \u00e0 son h\u00f4te par la muqueuse du tractus respiratoire et par les yeux. Il peut affecter autant les gens sains que les patients malades.

However, none were addressed specifically to anesthesiologists or to other health care professionals (nurses, respiratory therapists) in managing SARS patients in the operating room (OR) or during airway management outside the OR. Our department, which provides anesthesia service to four teaching hospitals (Toronto General, Toronto Western, Princess Margaret and Mount Sinai Hospitals), developed three sets of institutional guidelines to address these issues: Routine Precautions for non-SARS patients in the OR, Management of SARS Patients in the OR and Emergency tracheal intubation of SARS patients outside the OR (Appendices I-III). The guidelines were developed in consultation with anesthesiologists, intensivists, infection control staff and respiratory therapists. A modified version was adopted by the Canadian Anesthesiologists' Society. (www.cas.ca/meeting/sars).",
