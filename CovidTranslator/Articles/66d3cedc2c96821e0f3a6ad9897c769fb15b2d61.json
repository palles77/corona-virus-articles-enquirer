The genome contains 27,695 nucleotides (nt), and possesses a genomic structure similar to other IBV strains. Sequence comparisons demonstrated that the Sczy3 genome had the highest nt sequence identity with QX-like IBVs and was most dissimilar to the Massachusetts type IBV. Differences in the sequences of genes present in the Sczy3 genome and other IBVs gene sequences were also identified. Phylogenic analysis showed that the entire genome and most of the Sczy3 genes were located in the same cluster as LX4. Recombination analysis showed that Sczy3 is a chimeric strain derived from LX4 (major parental sequence) and H120 (minor parental sequence) suggesting that recombination occurred in a region containing the 3 0 terminal 5a sequence (83 nt), the 5 0 terminal 5b sequence (222 nt), and the 5 0 terminal nucleocapsid protein gene sequence (132 nt). Mutations and intergenic recombination may have played an important role in the evolution of IBVs.",

Six mRNAs (mRNA 1-6) are associated with viral replication. Four structural proteins including the spike glycoprotein (S), small membrane protein (E), membrane glycoprotein (M),and nucleocapsid protein (N) are encoded by mRNA 2, 3, 4, and 6, respectively [7, 8] . mRNA1 consists of ORF1a and ORF1b, which have 42 overlapping nucleotides (nt) and encode for two large polyproteins, pp1a and pp1ab, via a ribosomal frame-shift mechanism [9] . During or after synthesis, these polyproteins are cleaved into 15 non-structural proteins (nsp2-16), one of which is the polymerase. The S glycoprotein is post-translationally cleaved at protease cleavage recognition motifs into the amino-terminal S1 (92 kDa) and the carboxyl-terminal S2 (84 kDa) subunits by cellular proteases [10] . The putative protease cleavage motifs are usually associated with one or more pairs of basic amino acids (e.g., Arg-Arg-Phe-Arg-Arg M41) [11] . The multimeric coiled-coil S glycoprotein extends from the viral membrane, and the S1 subunit is anchored to the viral membrane by the S2 subunit [12] . Proteins 3a, 3b and 5a, 5b are encoded by mRNA 3 and mRNA 5 and are not essential to viral replication [3, 7, 8] .",

Nucleotide variability was observed across the entire genome; however, different regions varied more or less between strain Sczy3 and other IBVs studied.

However, phylogenetic analysis showed that the IBV isolates that clustered with Sczy3 were mainly Chinese isolates. We previously demonstrated that Sczy3 was a QX-like isolate that is prevalent in China and has been identified in other countries in recent years. These results further indicated that IBV isolates that are prevalent in China were significantly evolutionarily distant from Masstype strains. However, IBV vaccine strains commercially used in China today are primarily derived from Mass-type strains such as H120, H52, Ma5, and W93, which may not be able to provide efficient protection against field strains.

Similarity refers to sequence identity (green line) between the minor putative parent H120 and the putative recombinant Sczy3 and that (blue line) between the major putative parent (LX4) and putative recombinant Sczy3. The nucleotide identity was calculated using the Kimura 2-parameter method with a transition-transversion ratio of 2 in each window of 200 bp. The window was successively extended with a 20 bp increment. LX4 and H120 were used as putative parental strains, while Sczy3 was regarded as the putative recombinant strain. The breakpoints where the minor and major parental strains have equal sequence identity with Sczy3 were the predicted recombination sites. Putative recombinant region was the region between the recombination sites (red line) (Color figure online) infections [21] [22] [23] . This study demonstrated that recombination events occurred between non-vaccine and the vaccine strains. In China, the H120 strain is a widely used live vaccine; however, since the early 1980s, IBV has been diagnosed in China and in 1999, the LX4 was identified as a cause of IB [13] . Based on the widespread use of live vaccines and isolation of field IBVs, we hypothesize that Sczy3 represents a chimeric strain derived from vaccine strain H120 and field strain LX4 that evolved independently by point mutations and recombination events.",

Recombination event breakpoint analysis showed that sequences C(T/G)TAACAA, CTTTTG, and CTTTTG(C/T) were not found near recombination regions. Therefore, it was difficult to determine whether these motifs were associated with recombination. Further analyses will be needed to determine the roles of these motifs in recombination events; however, previous studies have suggested that recombination in IBV occurred randomly rather than at specific sites [32] .",
