We recorded histories and results of haematological, biochemical, radiological, and microbiological investigations. We took throat and sputum samples, used RT-PCR to detect M, H7, and N9 genes, and cultured samples in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells. We tested for co-infections and monitored serum concentrations of six cytokines and chemokines.We collected cloacal swabs from 86 birds from epidemiologically linked wet markets and inoculated embryonated chicken eggs with the samples. We identifi ed and subtyped isolates by RT-PCR sequencing. RNA extraction, complementary DNA synthesis, and PCR sequencing were done for one human and one chicken isolate. We characterised and phylogenetically analysed the eight gene segments of the viruses in the patient's and the chicken's isolates, and constructed phylogenetic trees of H, N, PB2, and NS genes.",

Patients were leucopenic and lymphopenic, and had impaired liver or renal function, substantially increased serum cytokine or chemokine concentrations, and disseminated intravascular coagulation with disease progression. Two patients died. Sputum specimens were more likely to test positive for the H7N9 virus than were samples from throat swabs. The viral isolate from the patient was closely similar to that from an epidemiologically linked market chicken. All viral gene segments were of avian origin. The H7 of the isolated viruses was closest to that of the H7N3 virus from domestic ducks in Zhejiang, whereas the N9 was closest to that of the wild bird H7N9 virus in South Korea. We noted Gln226Leu and Gly186Val substitutions in human virus H7 (associated with increased affi nity for \u03b1-2,6-linked sialic acid receptors) and the PB2 Asp701Asn mutation (associated with mammalian adaptation). Ser31Asn mutation, which is associated with adamantane resistance, was noted in viral M2.",

All subtypes of infl uenza A virus, from H1 to H16 and N1 to N9, are detected in wild water birds; H17N10 is found in bats. 1 Although most infections with these subtypes are mild or asymptomatic in avian species, outbreaks in wild birds and poultry have been associated with highly pathogenic avian infl uenza H5, and outbreaks in poultry have been associated with H7 subtypes. 1,2 Human infections are generally con-fi ned to H1, H2, and H3 subtypes, because these subtypes have affi nity for host cell receptors containing \u03b1-2,6-linked sialic acid (which occur in human beings), whereas other avian infl uenza viruses generally preferentially attach to avian host cell receptors, which contain \u03b1-2,3-linked sialic acid. Direct trans mission of avian infl uenza viruses from domestic poultry to people have been documented only for the H5N1, H7N2, H7N3, H7N7, H9N2, and H10N7 subtypes. 1, [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] Human infections due to these subtypes were generally mild and manifested as conjunctivitis and upper-respiratory-tract infections, except for the H5N1 subtype, which was associated with mortality of greater than 50%, and the H7N7 subtype, which has caused one death. 1,4 Since February, 2013, a novel reassortant H7N9 virus associated with human deaths but no apparent outbreaks in poultry and wild birds has emerged in eastern China.

This study was approved by the institutional and haemato logical, biochemical, radiological, and micro biological investigation results into a predesigned database. We recorded patients' acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II (APACHE-II) scores 8 and defi ned acute respiratory distress syn drome and multiorgan dysfunction syndrome on the basis of standard criteria. 9,10 Presumed incubation period was defi ned as the time between last poultry exposure and onset of symptoms. All laboratory procedures for respiratory secretions have been previously reported. 11 Briefl y, we used Taqman real-time RT-PCR under standard thermo cycling conditions to detect M, H7, and N9 genes. The primers that we used were M-forward (GAGTGGCTAAAGACAAGACCAATC), M-reverse (TTGGACAAAGCGTCTACGC), and M-probe (FAM-TCACCGTGCCCAGTGAGCGAG-BHQ1); H7-forward (AGAGTCATTRCARAATAGAATACAGAT), H7reverse (CACYGCATGTTTCCATTCTT), and H7-probe (FAM-AAACATGATGCCCCGAAGCTAAAC-BHQ1); and N9-forward (GTTCTATGCTCTCAGCCAAGG), N9reverse (CTTGACCACCCAATGCATTC) and N9-probe (HEX-TAAGCTRGCCACTATCATCACCRCC-BHQ1). The detection limit of the M, H7 and N9 RT-PCR assays was about 100 copies of RNA per mL. All samples were cultured with trypsin in the Madin-Darby canine kidney cell line for 7 days.

            "text": "Besides the likely absence of protection by pre-existing neutralising antibodies in the general population, the internal genes from the H9N2 virus might also contribute to the severe pathogenesis of this novel infection. Double and even triple reassortant avian H9N2 viruses were well reported, 19 and the six internal genes of the 1997 H5N1 virus originated from avian H9N2 virus. Furthermore, H9N2 and H5N1 viruses both induced prominent cytokine and chemokine activation in human macrophages and epithelial cells compared with that induced by seasonal infl uenza A H1N1 virus. 20 In previous studies, treatment with convalescent plasma or hyperimmune \u03b3 globulin seemed to improve survival of patients and therefore hyperimmune \u03b3 globulin should be considered in the treatment of severe H7N9 infection. 21 Immunomodulatory agents such as celecoxib (but not corticosteroids) improve outcomes of H5N1 infections in mice. 22 Other host factors, such as smoking and obesity, are risk factors for severe infl uenza. 23, 24 Findings from murine models challenged with infl uenza viruses suggest that smoking worsens the response of proinfl ammatory chemokine and cytokines and histological changes of infl ammatory infi ltrates and lung damage, increases viral titres, and impairs pulmonary adaptive T-lymphocyte responses to the virus. 25 Rapid virological diagnosis was established by RT-PCR of the M, H7, and N9 genes and confi rmed by viral culture in cell lines. Similar to H5N1 infection, which mainly aff ected the lower respiratory tract, sputum and endotracheal aspirates might be better than nasopharyngeal and throat swabs for detection of infl uenza A H7N9. 1 The predilection of infl uenza A H7N9 for the lower respiratory tract suggests that the virus might replicate more effi ciently there, where both \u03b1-2,3-linked and \u03b1-2,6-linked sialic acid receptors are noted. 1 \u03b1-2,3linked sialic acid was detected on non-ciliated cuboidal bronchiolar cells at the junction between the respiratory bronchiole and alveolus. A substantial number of cells lining the alveolar wall also expressed this receptor.",

This occurrence could be attributed to the absence of the multibasic aminoacid motif at the proteolytic cleavage site of H, which is associated with broad tissue tropism and organ dissemination and is therefore a key virulence marker of H5 or H7 subtypes of highly pathogenic avian infl uenza. 1 This multibasic cleavage site is a virulence marker in birds but is not confi rmed as a virulence marker in people. No pandemic virus has had this multibasic aminoacid motif. Wild waterfowl such as ducks and geese were the original natural reservoir (for H1-16, N1-9) 26 and provide new genes for making new virus reassortants that then infect domestic poultry, such as chickens, ducks, and geese, which are in close contact with human beings. Further adaptive genetic changes of such viruses in domestic poultry can enable transmission to people.",

Sequence analysis showed that the human H7 had aminoacid substitutions associated with increased affi nity for the human \u03b1-2,6-linked sialic acid receptor. 27 However, binding to the \u03b1-2,3-linked sialic acid receptor is likely to be retained, allowing the virus to circulate in poultry and infect human lower-respiratory-tract mucosae, which contain both types of receptor. 1 Shortening of the N stalk region of H5N1 viruses enhanced adaptation to land-based poultry. 28 An impor tant virus protein, PB2, in combination with two other viral proteins, PB1 and PA, comprise the viral RNA polymerase complex. PB2 is an important determinant of the host range and virulence of infl uenza viruses. Two aminoacids in PB2, 627Lys and 701Asn, have previously been detected in H5N1 viruses isolated from people. 18 Coupled 627Lys-701Asp or 627Glu-701Asn substitutions were thought to be important for effi cient transmission. 29 Although we did not note Glu627Lys substitution in PB2 in our human isolate, we did record Asp701Asn substitution. Another study 14 of the current H7N9 outbreak detailed three cases of infection in Shanghai and Anhui, China; the viral isolates showed Glu627Lys mutation. We noted neither genetic signature for mammalian adaptation-ie, Gln226Leu and Asp701Asn-in the chicken isolate, which suggests that this genetic adap tation might have occurred after the virus jumped from the chicken to the patient.",

One patient did not receive any antivirals and three patients received oseltamivir more than 5 days after onset of symptoms. We do not know whether oseltamivir resistance will emerge (as was the case with the H5N1 virus) because the last H7N9-positive sample from patient 2 was not tested for oseltamivir resistance after 5 days of oseltamivir treatment. Delayed initiation of oseltamivir treatment and use of corticosteroids have been associated with slow decreases in viral load and poor outcomes. 23 In 2003, an H7N7 virus, which contained the multibasic aminoacid motif associated with virulence and the genetic marker for mammalian adaptation (Glu627Lys) caused one fatal infection in the Netherlands. 4 Other severe human infections with the H7 subtype had not been reported before the current H7N9 outbreak. Previous surveillance studies have shown the H7N3 virus to be present in domestic ducks in Zhejiang. 30 Avian H7 subtype viruses are likely to have become established in domestic poultry in Zhejiang. Interaction between newly established H7 subtypes and other avian infl uenza viruses, such as the H9N2 subtype, might have resulted in the current H7N9 strain, which has gained some ability to infect human beings. Further adaptation could lead to less symptomatic infection and more effi cient person-to-person transmission. Aggressive intervention to block further animal-to-person transmission in live poultry markets, as has previously been done in Hong Kong, should be considered. Temporary closure of live bird markets and comprehensive programmes of surveillance, culling, improved biosecurity, segregation of diff erent poultry species, and possibly vaccination programmes to control H7N9 virus infection in poultry seem necessary to halt evolution of the virus into a pandemic agent.",

Our search did not reveal any reports of avian infl uenza A H7N9 virus infection in human beings before 2013. We noted only reports of poultry outbreaks caused by some H7N9 virus strains, which were usually weakly pathogenic for avian species. All reported human infections with avian infl uenza A virus were caused by H5N1, H7N2, H7N3, H7N7, H9N2, and H10N7 subtypes. Severe community-acquired pneumonia and multiorgan dysfunction due to H5N1 infection was associated with a mortality rate of more than 50%, and one death due to the H7N7 subtype has been reported. 4 However, most H7 viruses and other subtypes caused mild respiratory illness or conjunctivitis in people. Most cases were attributed to avian-to-person transmission, and there was little evidence of fi rst generation person-to-person transmission.",

Markers of mammalian adaptation were found in the human virus isolate. Clinical manifestation of this new emerging infection is similar to that of H5N1 infection and can be fatal in patients with substantial cytokine activation and multiorgan dysfunction. Further virological study is important to establish diagnosis and allow early treatment with neuraminidase inhibitors and infection control. Rising poultry and human populations will increase the emergence of novel avian infl uenza viruses infecting human beings.",
