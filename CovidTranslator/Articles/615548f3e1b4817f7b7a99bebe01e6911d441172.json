The viral genomes of coronaviruses have many unique features that make them prone to frequent coding changes, thus generating new candidates in a short period [5] . The reasons behind this rapid mutational frequency are the poor proofreading capability of the viral RNA polymerase and the possibility of recombination between various members of this family [6] . Recent studies showing the (angiotensin-converting enzyme A, (ACE-2)), ACE-2 is the primary receptors for the SARS-CoV-2 and other candidates of the B lineage of the Beta coronaviruses [7] . High expression levels of some potential viral receptors in many hosts from mammals, birds in addition to humans make them susceptible to J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f the virus infection. In recent studies, it is apparent that SARS-CoV-2 uses the mechanism that SARS-CoV used for cell entry. The mechanism of the virus entry to the cell resulting from the interaction between the virus receptors and the spike glycoprotein, after priming of that viral protein by the Serine protease TMPRSS2 [8] . Further, inhibition of TMPRSS2, blocked cell entry by SARS-CoV-2, indicating similar or identical pathways for cell invasion and possible strategies for therapeutics [8] . The WHO declared the virus as a global health emergency on Jan 31, 2020 [9] . As of 10 AM CET 03 March 2020, there are 128920 laboratory-confirmed cases reported to the WHO from 113 countries and territories across the globe with a total fatality of 4747 [10] . Currently, the case fatality rate is relatively low (\u20533.6%) compared to infections with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV, (10%) and MERS-CoV (32%) [11] .",

[12] The reasons behind the switch from the detection of the viral nucleic acids by real-time PCR to CT scanning at that time for patient identification are (i) to give a chance to all patients to get the proper care at the right time (ii) the variation in the incubation period of the viral infection among various people (iii) the possibility of super-spreader of the virus who shed the virus to the environment in large numbers and poses a great risk of infection to the close contact people.

Bats are representing almost one-fourth of the mammalian population [25] . They are widely distributed all over the world in all continents except Antarctica [25] . Bats are classified under the order Chiroptera that are found more than 50 million years ago. This order includes more than 1300 species of bats [25] . Several studies suggested that bats are the common reservoir for the SARS-CoV were the sequences for viruses isolated from Chinese horseshoe bats shared a high degree of identity with SARS-CoV [26] . Metagenomics paved the way for the discovery of a large number of viruses in different species, including bats. There are more than 200 coronaviruses have been identified in various species of bats [27] . The main bat reservoirs of the SARS-CoV was identified in 2003 [28] . Meanwhile, several species of bats including, Taphozous perforatus, Rhinopoma hardwickii, and Pipistrellus kuhlii were believed to be the ancestors for the MERS-CoV [29] .",

However, it remains uncertain whether a similar emergence for SARS-CoV-2 can be postulated. One potential reservoir of SARS-CoV was the Palm Civet cat (Paguma larvata), a member of the Viverridae, a group of mammals found in Asia [30] . SARS-CoV was able to infect and replicated efficiently in these animals [31] . Serosurveillance for the antibodies against SARS-CoV in workers from one wild animal market in Guangzhou was conducted in 2006 [32] . This study showed the presence of specific IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV in these workers where the civet cats were available [32] . This same study confirmed the hypothesis of the implication of civet cats in the emergence and sustainability of SARS-CoV at that time. The identification of this reservoir was one of the milestones in control and containment of SARS-CoV (9), and J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f subsequent banning of the trade of civet cats in the wild animal market was a significant step toward the containing of SARS-CoV [33] . This approach highlights the roles of One Health in controlling such zoonotic pathogens. Based on the evidence gained from studies of SARS-CoV, and from the genetic identity of SARS-CoV-2, it could be postulated that the virus responsible for the recent outbreak is transmit ted from bats to humans either directly or indirectly through adaptation in an unidentified host [34, 35] .",

This study showed J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f a drastic drop in the viral titer after one-minute treatment [39] . This raises the mandate of hand as well as personal hygiene as one of the gold standard control measures for not only coronaviruses but also form most enveloped viruses. Coronaviruses are small, approximately 100-120 nm in diameter. This is making them able to pass the pores of the surgical masks very easily. Thus, wearing special masks with minute pore sizes like N95 could be one of the preventive measures against respiratory pathogens, including influenza and coronaviruses, in comparison to another type of masks [40, 41] . However, the WHO already indicated certain rules for wearing the N95 masks, particularly for the health care workers and people in close contact with active cases [42] .",

Meanwhile, the effect of temperature on the virus infectivity/survival has great impact on the control of this class of respiratory viruses. SARS-CoV may live in the environment at average room temperature about 22 C for 2hrs without losing its infectivity. However, the virus infectivity is greatly affected by exposure to 56\u00baC for at least 30 min [44] . These parameters have great roles in the virus control as we discuss below. As mentioned above, the corona viral genomes are prone to frequent changes due to many factors; a new study highlighted the presence of two variants (L and S) of the SARS-CoV-2. This study confirmed that variant L (more severe) was dominant during the early outbreak in China, which was responsible for at least 70% of the cases at that time. However, the implementation of drastic control measures against the virus posed some selective pressure on this variant then the S variant becomes the predominant at this time [45] .",

To identify the animal reservoirs in the context of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, scientist screened a large number of animals and birds to identify the main reservoir for those two viruses [47, 48] . SAS-CoV-2 was believed to be originated in people who came in close contact with the live wet market in Wuhan, China, late 2019 [22] . In the case of SARS-CoV-2, recent studies used the informational spectrum tools to identify and predict the actual reservoir, the virus receptors as well as potential therapeutic and vaccine targets [49] . The Wuhan wet market was hosting a large number of wild animals, birds, reptiles, and amphibians which never exist in one location in nature [50] . Simply, there is a close J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f human-animal contact in the supply chain of these wild animal markets starting from hunting, transporting, selling, processing, including slaughtering, and cooking. This is in addition to the exposure of people to their blood, secretions, and execrations. This chain poses a great risk for the contact between human and these wild animals, which may put the handlers at risk of infection not only for coronaviruses but also for other pathogens that these animals and birds may harbor. In the light of the One Health concept, control of this emerging virus requires the reduction of the viral shedding to the environment from the main reservoirs, for animal-person transmission and from humans for person-person transmission [35] . Based on the previous experience from the other emerging diseases, particularly SARS-CoV and influenza viruses, avoiding the mixing of various species of animals, birds, and mammals, is highly suggested [51, 65, 66] . This strategy will minimize the possibility of recombination among not only these pathogens but also for other common pathogens in the near future. A large number of bats may also be available in this particular market, including the Rhinolophus affinis. The viral genome of the bat coronavirus from this particular species was close to the SARS-CoV-2 (Table 1) . This result is suggesting these bats are the main ancestor of this virus. About 49% of the first reported human cases had a various levels of contact with this market [22] . A recent study showed that Second, if seroconversion is proved in any of these animals or birds, testing specimens and tissues from these animals or birds must be carried out to detect the virus in these animals. The live poultry markets were responsible for the transmission of many viral pathogens to humans, especially various types of avian influenza viruses [37, 51, 52] . Several studies reported that banning the storage of live poultry in live markets at least for a short period of time for overnight drastically reduced the ability to isolates the avian influenza viruses by 84% compared with the standard procedures [51] . Another study showed a drastic decrease in the number of reported human cases of avian influenza H7N9 by almost 97% after the closure of live poultry markets in four major provinces in China [53] . Thus, banning the live wild animal trading could have substantial effects on the control strategies not only for coronaviruses but also for other pathogens such as avian influenza viruses. Regular monitoring of the dynamic changes of coronavirus in different species of bats is highly recommended.",

Some coronaviruses such as HCoV-229E and MERS-CoV were detected on some environmental surfaces during some outbreaks [57, 58] . One of the critical control measures in the case of airborne infection is to develop novel assays that enable us to detect and estimate the virus concentration in the air. This approach will have great implications, especially in the health care settings. The process of decontamination of the virus-contaminated surfaces by the appropriate disinfectants or virucidal agents was successful in case of other respiratory viruses such as SARS-CoV and avian influenza [59] .

First, personal and hand hygiene are the gold standard approach toward minimizing the possibility of infection for J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f individuals. This can be achieved by washing the hands with the antiseptics and or soaps and water for at least 30 seconds as per the WHO guidelines [61] . This approach will reduce the virus load in the contaminated hands from virus droplets, which might touch the nose or mouse of persons. Second, practice extreme caution by applying a social distance of at least one meter between you and anyone who is coughing or sneezing [61] . Third, educate the public on how to avoid the frequent touching of the mucous membranes, especially those of nose, mouse, and eyes [61] . Fourth, respiratory protection and hygiene through wearing the most appropriate personal protective equipment, as suggested earlier, according to the WHO's standards [61] . Fifth, vomiting and diarrhea were reported in many SARS-CoV-2 patients [62] . This is suggesting the possibility of the fecal oral route as a mode of transmission of the virus [62] . This stresses out the importance of hand hygiene to avoid any possible transmission of the virus through the fecal oral route. Sixth, one of the main pillars in the control of virus spreads is the identification of the infected personnel. It is one of the crucial steps toward reducing the virus spread in a community.",

Seventh, special attention should be paid to how to protect the health care workers dealing with active cases. They should provide by the standard originated from bats [25, 65] . This highlights the mandate for continuous monitoring of the coronaviruses population in bats as an alarm to the emergence of new novel coronaviruses in the future. Second, there is ongoing research to develop antiviral therapy that might help in the treatment of the active human cases of the SARS-CoV-2. Each approach mainly depends on a unique strategy to halt the virus replication or disrupt it at a certain point; thus, the virus cannot complete its replication cycle in the host. Therefore, it reduces the possibility of virus shedding from the infected patients to its close contacts. A recent study used some serine protease TMPRSS2 inhibitors to prevent the virus from entry to the cell. These compounds are clinically approved and potentially will reduce the virus replication [8] . Some FDA approved anthelminthic compounds such as niclosamide have potent antiviral effects not only for SARS-CoV-2 but also for other viruses, including SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, Zika virus, and HCV [63] .",

Identification of the intermediate host or reservoir for the SARS-CoV-2, if any, could be one of the milestones of the combating of this virus. This could be done in two consecutive steps. First, conduct a large scale serological testing of the animals and birds sold in this market immediately before this epidemic. This surveillance will give an J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f idea if particular animals or birds reacted to the virus and carry specific antibodies against it.",

This may help in the largescale decontamination and disinfection of regions where the virus spread, including streets, hospitals, factories, public transportation, parks, worship places, and schools. The environment plays some essential roles in the transmissibility of the virus, as suggested by the correlation between the role of public transportation through the domestic buses, trains, even luxurious cruise ships, and the rate of the reported human SARS-CoV-2 cases [66]. These public transportations like trains, buses, and planes require thorough disinfection between uses.",

Identification of the infected patients as early as possible and tracing his contact with regular monitoring and testing remains the gold standard approach for minimizing the spread of the virus in certain community. Regular monitoring of the circulating air and the cooling systems will help to trace back any circulating virus in a particular region. Eights, the main current challenges facing the containment of the virus is the spread of the virus via J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f traveling. Special precautions should be implemented during the travel of the citizens from one country to another especially these countries with a high number of reported cases. Although physical examination through the thermal cameras that help identifying the people suffering from fever is helpful in identifying some potential cases, it may not be necessary that every person suffering from fever is an infected person. One the other hand, some patients did not show any symptoms during the early stage of infection. Additional quick tests should be implemented to identify some potential cases. However, this may require further equipments and designated places in every airport to conduct such measures, at least during the outbreak. This will help in reducing the potential introduction of positive cases to a certain country or provinces within a country in case of quarantine measures. More research is essential to unravel many unknown aspects of the virus evolution, transmission cycle, pathogenesis, and control. Special attention should be directed toward understanding the high transmissibility rate of SARS-CoV-2 compare to other coronaviruses like SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.Strategies based on the development of novel vaccines and antiviral therapeuticsOne of the most significant obstacles facing the control of SARS-CoV and other coronaviruses such as MERS-CoV is the absence of any licensed vaccine or even medication available for prophylactic and treatment purposes. However, there is an ongoing race among scientists and pharmaceutical companies to develop these useful pharmaceutical preparations for controlling SARS-CoV-2 across the globe. There are many vaccine candidates currently in the clinical trials, while others are still under testing. One strategy for the development of coronavirus recombinant vaccines is to map the neutralizing epitopes within the spike glycoprotein of the virus, express them in vitro then use the expressed protein as a vaccine. These vaccines usually trigger the host cell immune response to produce specific antibodies against the virus; thus, protection against J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f any potential natural infection may be achieved. These strategies will help in the protection of an at-risk group of people, particularly the immunocompromised and people suffering from chronic diseases. The regular monitoring of various coronaviruses, especially in various species of bats, animals, and birds on the genomic level, is highly recommended. Some studies suggested the most human coronaviruses; including SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, HCoV-229E, and HCoV-NL63",
