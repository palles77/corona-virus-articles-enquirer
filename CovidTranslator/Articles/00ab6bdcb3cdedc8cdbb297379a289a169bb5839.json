The isolation procedure involved affinity chromatography on Affi-gel blue gel, ion exchange chromatography on Q-Sepharose and Mono S, and gel filtration on Superdex 75 and Superdex Peptide. The peptide was adsorbed on the first three chromatographic media. It exerted an inhibitory action on mycelial growth including Fusarium oxysporum and Mycosphaerella arachidicola, with an IC 50 of 5.1 \u03bcM and 4.4 \u03bcM, respectively. The peptide was characterized by remarkable thermostability and pH stability. It inhibited proliferation of HepG2 and MCF cancer cells with an IC 50 of 6.4 \u03bcM and 1.8 \u03bcM, and the activity of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase with an IC 50 of 3.2 \u03bcM. It demonstrated lysolecithin binding activity.",

However, antifungal proteins have been isolated from only several Brassica species (17, (27) (28) (29) . Recently, a lipid transfer protein with antifungal activity, referred to hereinafter as BCLTP, has been reported from Brassica campestris seeds (17) . Another antifungal peptide with N-terminal sequence similar to B. napus trypsin inhibitor but without trypsin inhibitory activity has been isolated from the seeds of B. parachinensis (27) . Alboglabrin is an antifungal peptide from B. alboglabra seeds with an N-terminal sequence different from those of B. campestris and B. parachinensis (28) . It is known that the same seed may produce more than one type of antifungal proteins (30) . The intent of the present investigation was to isolate and characterize an additional antifungal protein from B. campestris seeds and to ascertain if the antifungal protein is different from the previously isolated lipid transfer peptide (29) . It was found that the isolated peptide displayed various kinds of antipathogenic activities including antifungal, antitumor and anti-HIV reverse transcriptase which are of potential therapeutic value. The peptide, which could be synthesized, is of special interest because the aforementioned activities are thermostable and its antifungal activity is pH-stable.",

The digoxigenin-and biotin-labeled nucleotides in an optimized ratio are incorporated into one of the same DNA molecule, which is freshly synthesized by the reverse transcriptase (RT). The detection and quantification of synthesized DNA as a parameter for RT activity follows a sandwich ELISA protocol. Biotin-labeled DNA binds to the surface of streptavidin-precoated microtiter plate modules. In the next step, a precoated antibody to digoxigenin, conjugated to peroxidase, binds to the digoxigenin-labeled DNA. In the final step, the peroxidase substrate is added. The peroxidase enzyme catalyzes the cleavage of the substrate, forming a colored reaction product. The absorbance of the sample at 405 nm can be measured using a microtiter plate (ELISA) reader and is directly correlated to the level of RT activity. A fixed amount (4-6 ng) of recombinant HIV-1 reverse transcriptase was used. The inhibitory activity of the antifungal peptide was calculated as percent inhibition as compared to a control without the antifungal peptide (11) . To investigate the thermal [0-100\u00b0C] stability of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase inhibitory activity, the isolated antifungal peptide was pretreated for 30 min accordingly and the assay was then conducted as mentioned above.",

The present study constitutes another report on the isolation of an antifungal peptide from seeds of the same species. Nevertheless, the N-terminal sequence of the antifungal peptide isolated in the present study, designated as campesin, is similar to that of BCLTP except for the replacement of some amino acids in BCLTP by more basic residues but different from those of antifungal peptides from B. parachinensis and B. alloglabra although all of them demonstrate pronounced thermostability and pH stability, HIV-1 reverse transcriptase inhibitory activity and antiproliferative activity toward tumor cells. They exert antifungal activity toward a variety of fungal species including F. oxysporum, M. arachidicola and a Helminthosporium species. Brassica parachinensis napin shows N-terminal sequence similarity to B. napus trypsin inhibitor as well as trypsin inhibitory activity (21) . B. parachinensis antifungal peptide also exhibits N-terminal sequence to trypsin inhibitor but it is devoid of trypsin inhibitory activity (27) . The absence of trypsin inhibitory activity in B. parachinensis antifungal peptide in spite of N-terminal sequence similarity to trypsin inhibitors is reminiscent of the lack of antifungal activity of thaumatin despite the fact that thaumatin-like proteins have antifungal activity (18) . However, campesin does not resemble napin in N-terminal sequence and manifests no trypsin inhibitory activity. This is noteworthy in view of the fact that some of the trypsin inhibitors demonstrate antifungal activity (8) . The two B. campestris antifungal peptides, campesin and BCLTP were isolated by using similar protocols. Ion exchange chromatography on Q-Sepharose, affinity chromatography on Affi-gel blue gel, ion exchange chromatography on Mono S and gel filtration on Superdex Peptide were used for purification of B. campestris lipid transfer peptide (29) , the only difference in the present protocol being an additional gel filtration on Superdex 75.",

Both antifungal peptides are devoid of mitogenic activity toward mouse splenocytes. It has previously been shown that some (8, 20) but not other (29) antifungal proteins/peptides exhibit mitogenic activity. BCLTP and campesin have similar lipid transfer activity. They have no inhibitory effect on HIV-1 integrase, unlike some other antifungal proteins (32) . They are also inactive toward SARS proteinase.

            "text": "Lysolecithin is employed as a model phospholipid for lipid transfer activity assay in this study since it manifests in aqueous solution a simple and quick equilibrium between dispersed monomeric molecules and micellar aggregates. Lipid binding by nsLTPs, in aqueous solution by fluorescence spectroscopy with substrate lyso-C 12 , was first studied using maize nsLTP and wheat nsLTP (34) . The relative enhancement fluorescence intensity of campesin shows similarity to that of wheat nsLTP, while maize nsLTP evokes a considerably smaller relative increase (35) . The presence of a stable lysolecithin-protein complex in aqueous solution is analogous to a condition in which nsLTP serves as a carrier that can extract one lipid molecule from a membrane and transfer it to another (36) . The results disclose that the relative increase of fluorescence intensity continues as lipid/protein ratio rises until a plateau is attained, indicating that the purified peptide possesses good lipid transfer activity. To date, it has been impossible to isolate a stable complex involving lysolecithin and to establish the model of binding of such a molecule to the nsLTP. Recent monolayer experiments (34) provide addition information on the interaction between the wheat nsLTP and diacylphospholipids. A model is proposed involving a collisional complex-shuttle mechanism. In this model, only one acyl chain of the lipid is inserted into the protein hydrophobic tunnel and the transfer implies an intimate contact between the donor and acceptor membranes to prevent transfer of the second acyl chain in the aqueous solvent. Ongoing studies aim to establish more precisely the binding mode of multiacyl phospholipids by nsLTPs.",

The antiproliferative activity toward tumor cells and inhibitory activity toward HIV-1 reverse transcriptase observed in both BCLTP and campesin are in line with their role as defense proteins. It is shown only in the present study that campesin is devoid of antiproliferative activity on normal embryonic liver cells. Thus, it appears that its antiproliferative activity is confined to tumor cells. It is also demonstrated that all the biological activities of both BCLTP and campesin are thermostable, while in previous studies only the antifungal activity of the plant lipid transfer proteins has been shown to be thermostable. The peptide nature, and highly potent as well as thermostable antifungal, antitumor and anti-HIV reverse transcriptase activities of both BCLTP and campesin make them candidates for development into therapeutic agents.",

In contrast, some antifungal proteins like mungbean chitinase lack HIV-1 reverse transcriptase inhibitory activity and antiproliferative activity toward tumor cells (29) . The finding in the present study of two closely similar antifungal peptides is reminiscent of the report of two highly homologous ribosome inactivating proteins with antifungal activity from bitter melon seeds (4). Other previous investigations revealed the presence of two structurally disparate antifungal proteins in the same plant tissue (30) . Up to 100\u00b0C (shown for antifungal activity only)",
