Completed questionnaires were received from 66 hospitals (97%). The median number of acute inpatient beds per hospital was 156; this was 522 in regional/tertiary referral centres. Only 31 (47%) hospitals had on-site consultant microbiologist sessions, and there was an infection control nurse in 56 (85%) hospitals. Eighteen (29%) hospitals had an occupational health physician, and 48 (73%) hospitals had an infection control committee. There was a median of one isolation room for every 16 acute beds, and a median of five rooms with en-suite bathroom facilities per hospital in those hospitals that provided data. All hospitals had documented infection control policies, and these were available in electronic format in 25 (38%) hospitals. Fifty-five (83%) hospitals undertook surveillance of nosocomial infection, and alcohol-based hand hygiene facilities were available, either at a handwashing sink or at the entrance to a ward, in 57 (86%) hospitals. In the Republic of Ireland, there remains a significant shortage of microbiologists/infection control doctors, occupational health physicians and infection control nurses. Isolation facilities are also inadequate. Although",

Until the introduction of the EARSS programme, there was little if any prospective national surveillance carried out in Ireland. 6 In 1999, a large national survey of meticillinresistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was carried out in the Republic of Ireland in association with colleagues in Northern Ireland, which revealed a higher prevalence rate of MRSA in the Republic of Ireland. 7e10 In 2001, the Strategy for the Control of Antimicrobial Resistance in Ireland (SARI) was launched by the Department of Health and Children in Dublin (www.dohc.ie). The development of principles in relation to infection control in the hospital and in the community setting was amongst its main recommendations. 11 Arising from this, a working group decided to carry out a comprehensive survey to determine current resources for infection control, antibiotic stewardship and occupational health services in acute hospitals in Ireland. This article reports the results of that survey as they relate to infection control and occupational health.",

It reveals major gaps in the provision of resources and facilities, following the development of national guidelines for the control of antimicrobial resistance in 2001. 11 While the survey found that the number of consultant microbiologists and infection control nurses in post had increased since the 2001 report, there are still insufficient microbiologists/infection control doctors and occupational health physicians available, and many acute hospitals do not have infection control nurses on site. Furthermore, the number of isolation rooms, especially those with en-suite facilities, is worryingly low. The organization and delivery of hospital infection control services in a number of countries have been reviewed in this journal recently. 5,12e17 Most of these reports have described the background or history of infection control services and how these are organized at local and national level, but there is relatively little detail on resources and practices. However, a similar survey to that reported here was carried out amongst Italian hospitals in 2000; infection control physicians and infection control nurses were absent in 28.7% and 46.0% of Italian hospitals, respectively. 12 In many countries, such as Australia, a programme of healthcare infection prevention is part of national hospital standards and is a key component of hospital accreditation. 13 Although there is close collaboration and professional association between infection control nurses and microbiologists in the Republic of Ireland and in the UK, the infrastructure and the provision of resources seem to be inferior in the Republic of Ireland, and the mandatory reporting of various nosocomial infections is now the norm in the UK. 5 Although this questionnaire was drafted and distributed through a sub-committee of a national committee dealing with the prevention of antimicrobial resistance, there is no national infection control committee, unlike in France. 14 In France, such a committee is appointed by the Ministry of Health and there are five regional co-ordinating centres, in contrast to many other countries where the organization and delivery of nosocomial infection prevention is more decentralized. A number of the acute hospital networks in Ireland have a regional infection control committee, but these committees are purely advisory in nature and centralized co-ordination of infection control activities is lacking.",

Currently, there is no national programme of surveillance in Ireland, which is in breach of European regulations. From reviewing the organization of infection control in other countries and from descriptions of outbreaks in the literature, the extent of the resources available in many European hospitals in not clear. In particular, there is a need to define the minimum number of infection control nurses per acute hospital beds, in general and in tertiary referral centres, and whether or not the infection control doctor/microbiologist should always be based on site. In tandem with this, there is a need to agree a minimum number of isolation beds for an acute hospital and the minimum space between beds, as both factors are important components in preventing infection.",

Nonetheless, the absence of a European or global consensus on the minimum resources for nosocomial infection prevention is a handicap as there is no agreed standard to bring to national agencies. Agreement on the definitions and priorities for the surveillance of nosocomial infection are welcome, but this needs to be linked to the minimum resources required to achieve this. The Irish Health Services Executive is currently developing a set of national standards for infection control in Ireland. These standards, when finalised, will hopefully inform the provision of appropriate resources while also establishing corporate responsibility for infection control within the Irish health service.",
