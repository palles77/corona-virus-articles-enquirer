One such strategy is a broader-scale 29 contact rate reduction enforced by governments which was used during previous outbreaks, e.g., the 1918 influenza 30 pandemic and the 2009 influenza A/H1N1 pandemic in Mexico. Alternatively, governments and media may stimu-31 late self-imposed prevention measures (handwashing, mask-wearing, and social distancing) by generating awareness 32 about COVID-19, especially when economic and societal consequences are taken into account.

Our analyses also highlight the 41 importance of spreading awareness about COVID-19 in the population, as the impact of self-imposed measures is 42 strongly dependent on it. When awareness spreads fast, simple self-imposed measures such as handwashing are more 43 effective than short-term government intervention. Self-imposed measures do not only diminish and postpone the 44 peak number of diagnoses, but they can prevent a large epidemic altogether when their efficacy is sufficiently high 45 (above 50%).

The orange lines correspond to the model with a fast rate of awareness spread and no interventions. The blue lines correspond to the latter model where disease awareness induces the uptake of handwashing with an efficacy of 30%. show that disease awareness spread has a significant effect on the model predictions. We first considered 192 the epidemic dynamics in a disease-aware population where handwashing is promoted, as an example of self-imposed 193 measures (Figure 3). Then, we performed a systematic comparison of the impact of different prevention measures 194 on the model output for slow (Figure 4) and fast (Figure 5) rate of awareness spread. 195 Epidemic dynamics 196 All self-imposed measures and government-imposed social distancing have an effect on the COVID-19 epidemic 197 dynamics. The qualitative and quantitative impact, however, depends strongly on the prevention measure and 198 the rate of awareness spread. The baseline model predicts 46 diagnoses per 1000 individuals at the peak of the 199 epidemic, an attack rate of about 16% and the time to the peak of about 5.2 months (red line, Figure 3 A and B). 200 In the absence of prevention measures, a fast spread of disease awareness reduces the peak number of diagnoses 201 by 20% but has only a minor effect on the attack rate and peak timing (orange line, Figure 3 A and B). This is 202 expected, as disease-aware individuals with severe symptoms seek health care sooner and therefore get diagnosed 203 faster causing fewer new infections as compared to the baseline model. Awareness dynamics coupled with the use 204 of self-imposed prevention measures has an even larger impact on the epidemic. The blue line in Figure 3 A shows 205 the epidemic curve for the scenario when disease-aware individuals use handwashing as self-imposed prevention 206 measure.

This type of intervention halts the epidemic for the duration of intervention, but, because of a 230 large pool of susceptible individuals, epidemic resurgence is expected as soon as social distancing measures are 231 lifted. Finally, when government-imposed social distancing is combined with self-imposed prevention measures, 232 the model predicts that the relative reduction in the peak number of diagnoses and attack rate are determined by 233 the efficacy of the self-imposed measure, while the timing of the peak is determined by the efficacy of government 234intervention. This is demonstrated inFigure 4(light purple line), where we used a combination of handwashing with 235 30% efficacy and government-imposed social distancing with efficacy ranging from 0% to 100% (shown on the x-axis). 236237Since the government intervention reduces the contact rate of all individuals irrespective of their awareness status, it 238 has a comparable impact on transmission for scenarios with fast and slow rate of awareness spread (compareFigure 239",

However, the impact of self-imposed measures is drastically different when awareness spreads fast. 240All self-imposed measures are more effective than short-term government intervention. These measures not only 241 reduce the attack rate (Figure 5 B), diminish and postpone the peak number of diagnoses (Figure 5 A and C), but 242 they can also prevent a large epidemic altogether when their efficacy is sufficiently high (about 50%). Note that 243 when the rate of awareness is fast, as the number of diagnoses grows, the population becomes almost homogeneous, 244 with most individuals being disease-aware. It can be shown that in such populations prevention measures yield 245 comparable results if they have the same efficacy. Furthermore, the effect of combinations of self-imposed measures 246 is additive (see Appendix). This means that a large outbreak can be prevented by, for example, a combination of 247 handwashing and self-imposed social distancing each with an efficacy of around 25% (or other efficacies adding up 248 to 50%). As before, for combinations of self-imposed measures and government intervention, the reduction in the 249 peak number of diagnoses and attack rate are determined by the efficacy of the self-imposed measure (Figure 5 250 A and B) but the peak timing is now determined by the efficacies of both interventions (Figure 5 C). Note, that 251 for fast spread of awareness, a combination of highly efficacious government intervention and handwashing with an 252 efficacy of 30% could postpone the time to the peak number of diagnoses by nearly 10 months (light purple line in 253 Figure 5 C).",
