            "text": "Addresses are the most common georeferencing resource people use to communicate to others a location within a city. Urban GIS applications that receive data directly from citizens, or from legacy information systems, need to be able to quickly and efficiently obtain a spatial location from addresses. In this paper we understand addresses in a broader perspective, in which not only the conventional elements of postal addresses are considered, but other kinds of direct or indirect references to places, such as building names, postal codes, or telephone area codes, which are also valuable as locators to urban places. This broader view on addresses allows us to work with two perspectives. First, in the ontological definition, modeling, and implementation of an addressing database that is flexible enough to accommodate the variety of concepts and address formats used worldwide, along with direct and indirect references to places. Second, in the definition of an indicator that is able to quantify the degree of certainty that could be reached when a user-given, semi-structured address is geocoded into a spatial position, as a function of the type and completeness of the available addressing data and of the geocoding method that has been employed. This indicator, which we call Geocoding Certainty Indicator (GCI), can be used as a threshold, beyond which the geocoded event should be left out of any statistical analysis, or as a weight that allows spatial analysis methods to reduce the influence of events that have been less reliably located. In order to support geocoding activities and the determination of the GCI, we propose a conceptual schema for addressing databases. The schema is flexible enough to accommodate a variety of addressing systems, at various levels of detail, and in different countries. Our intention is to depart from the usual geocoding strategy employed in commercial GIS products, which is usually limited to the average American or British address format. The schema also extends the notion of postal address to something broader, including popular names for places, building names, reference places, and other concepts. This approach extends Simpson's and Yu's Comput. Environ. Urban Syst., 27: 283-307, 2003 work on postal codes to records of any kind, including place names and loosely formatted addresses.",

This observation indicates that, while using the same addressing system with the same kinds of address-based location procedures, the quality of the results may suffice for some applications, but may be inadequate for others. Locating precisely each provided address in a short time is essential for emergency dispatching, while an epidemiologist may be content if each West Nile virus case is located only well enough for it to be associated with a reasonably small spatial unit, such as a Census tract. Thus, in this paper, we introduce a measurement to evaluate the degree of certainty associated with geocoding, i.e., the location of events or phenomena using addresses. This measurement, which we call Geocoding Certainty Indicator (GCI), shows how certain can the user be as to the actual position of the geocoded event. The resulting GCI can be used as a threshold for a filter, to leave out less reliable data, or as a weight, allowing the user to take the uncertainty into consideration during the spatial analysis process. 1 In order to support geocoding activities and the determination of the GCI, we propose a conceptual schema for addressing databases.

These applications receive, as input, an address or a set of addresses, obtained from alphanumeric attributes corresponding to some fact which has been recorded in a database. These attributes are descriptors of locations, and are usually in the form of postal addresses. The geocoding application tries to find a match for each of these descriptors in a reference database, which supposedly contains the locations for every relevant address, and, if successful, returns coordinates corresponding to its location [29] . In the case of roads and highways, in which addressing works as a linear referencing system [24] , dynamic segmentation strategies have been proposed [11] , associating a set of events to a linear feature through a distance along the line.",

We argue that, by taking this hierarchy into consideration, it is possible to obtain increasingly approximate positions for events associated with addresses, stopping at the point in which the needs of a given application are satisfied. With this approach, geocoding can return results with measurable accuracy and adequate to the needs of the application.",

Any place name that can be associated to a definite location, as recognized by the population in a local context, also constitutes a kind of urban address. In this sense, not only the formal components of addresses are acceptable as indications of a location. For someone who knows Washington, DC well enough, the string \"The Mall, Washington DC\" is fully sufficient to locate the corresponding place. Reference places, such as the names of monuments, stadiums, and parks, may also be recognizable and locatable by people, even though it is possible that no one resides or receives communications at those places. In a sense, we should be able to efficiently determine locations from any given urban addressin this broader view-if a minimum amount of context is available. Indirect references, such as telephone area codes, may also constitute valuable location indicators. In a way, postal codes are also indirect references, and in many cases the coding reflects a hierarchy of areas, something that may be useful if the intention is to quickly establish rough locations within a country [2] . This broader view of addresses is closer to the notion of a gazetteer, a sort of dictionary of place names [12] , but geared towards urban places [26] and with varying degrees of accuracy.",

There are variations in which the numbering is sequential but blockoriented (for instance, assigning and distributing 100 numbers to a block), though the numbering is not distance-oriented. The metric system has the advantage of allowing an easy approximation of the distance between two addresses in the same street, while allowing for simple adaptation to new developments along each street. Similarly, some cities have a street naming (or numbering) which allows for a quick estimation as to the distance between two addresses.",

Most streets actually have no name at all, and, therefore, business cards typically show small maps printed on the back to indicate the location of a place. In Korea, numbers are assigned inside neighborhoods (called dong) within urban sectors (called gu), a hierarchy of areas that are named, not numbered [4] . In Kyoto, Japan, the Digital City project has been conceived with this kind of limitation in mind: a map-based user interface facilitates the location of points of interest for tourists and locals alike, since the addressing system seems to be too complicated to navigate without detailed mapping information [13] .",

Thus, the database can be useful even while it is partially populated. Of course, more detailed and complete data will result in more reliably geocoded locations (as indicated by the GCI), but the user should be able to refine the database contents incrementally. Souza et al. [26] shows a study in which, from analyzing a set of Web documents, a listing of the most frequently mentioned locations is obtained. Eventually, these locations should be added to the addressing database. Figure 1 presents the conceptual schema for the addressing database, developed using OMT-G [3] , an extension of the Universal Modeling Language (UML) dedicated to geographic applications. In the OMT-G notation of each georeferenced class there is a pictogram which indicates the spatial representation type that is to be employed. Simple In the schema, we included a class for individual addresses, represented as points. With this approach, we are able to avoid situations in which irregular numbering (e.g., numbers that are not always increasing along the thoroughfare, or that disregard the usual odd-even side rule) or unusual addressing systems (such as the Japanese and the Korean ones) prevent the use of numbering ranges in each block. In the schema, such addresses are defined in the Individual address location class, which contain a thoroughfare code and a building number. We also use points to represent landmarks, i.e., places that are identified by name, and that are precisely locatable, such as monuments or buildings (Point Landmark). In case the space corresponding to the landmark is significantly large, such as in a park or a sports arena, a polygonal representation is used (Area Landmark).",

Each Centerline object is related to two Crossing objects, thus forming a street network. Using centerlines and crossings allows the location of places described as, for instance, \"at the corner of Oak and Main St.\" Postal codes are also included, considering both the association of several codes to the same street (defined in ranges) and the association of a single code to the entire municipality. Postal codes play the role of disambiguators in case several thoroughfares exist with the same name.

Using a database modeled as proposed in this paper, and considering the hierarchy in Fig. 3 , applications can be developed so that (1) geocoding can stop if the required degree of accuracy is met, or (2) a location can be provided even in the absence of some addressing components. As an example of the first case, consider a geomarketing application with nationwide coverage, for which it is sufficient to identify the city of residence of each registered customer, in order to determine the ideal location for a new store. In the second case, consider a public health system on epidemiology, which needs to locate as precisely as possible the residence of people that have been infected with a contagious disease. In consolidated areas of the city, the location is obtained through individual addresses; in recent developments, for which addressing information is not detailed enough, the location is approximated using neighborhood limits. In order to be able to recognize and locate addresses such as the ones presented in this section, databases containing the place names and their location are required. Addressing databases are usually available in such countries as part of a national information infrastructure strategy, presenting high quality and low cost. The foremost example of this kind of information are Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing (TIGER) files [27] . Private sector companies have access to this material, and invest in its improvement, thus demonstrating that address databases can be a valuable economic asset. In the UK, the Ordnance Survey produces and sells licenses on an address point database that contains over 25 million locations, along with a coordinate list for the 1.6 million distinct postal codes within the country [16] . Even if an addressing database is available, there are many cities in which the addressing system is considerably different from the American and British cases, and thus the geocoding methods provided by commercial GIS packages will not work as expected.",

The analysis of each token can use the addressing database, if it is necessary to establish hypotheses as to what is the correct interpretation of each term (token) in the address. In this process, the gazetteer defined in the addressing database schema can be helpful. Through the use of the gazetteer, and by scanning the template in order, it is possible to decide the adequate interpretation on situations in which the same name is related, for instance, to a municipality and to a state (for instance, \"S\u00e3o Paulo\" in Brazil is both a city and a state, and possibly the name of many streets all over the country).

Soundex-like procedures can also be used, but we decided against including them in our implementation, based on the results presented in [30] , and on our perception that phonetic methods would be best employed if source data were primarily in English, without many personal names or foreign words, which is clearly not the case of addressing data. Approximate string matching algorithms are able to find matches even when there are differences, such as missing characters, inverted characters, or extraneous characters, between the given string and the matching pattern. These algorithms are adapted to multilingual support, by granting the equivalence between accented characters and their canonical counterparts (for instance, \"\u00e1\" and \"\u00e4\" are considered equivalent to \"a\" for approximate matching purposes). If multiple matches result from this process, additional information must be used, when available. For instance, if there are two streets with the same name in given city (a common situation in developing countries), the neighborhood name or the postal code can be used to select a single result.

For instance, in many places the presence of a postal code can compensate the absence of a city, a state, or even a thoroughfare; in other situations, the postal code provided can be unreliable, and therefore the absence of other components can be considered a great risk, thus requiring a low PCI value. In the example, we obtain the structure presented in Table 5 .

The indicator, which has a minimum value of 0 (completely uncertain) and a maximum value of 1 (absolutely certain), is calculated from partial indicators that are determined during the parsing, matching and locating phases. The indicator values, as well as the values of its components, can be used in various situations. We emphasized here the possibility of filtering the data by establishing a GCI threshold, but it is also possible to include the GCI value in the analysis process, as a sort of weighting factor. GCI can also be used as a ranking criterion in geographic information retrieval procedures that use addresses as spatial references.",

Dr. Fonseca was an Assistant Professor in Computer Science at the Catholic University of Minas Gerais, and held professional appointments as senior systems analyst, GIS analyst and programmer. He completed his Ph.D. with Dr. Egenhofer at the University of Maine in 2001. His thesis covered the area of GIS interoperability. His research provides a theoretical basis for semantic interoperability, which is a necessary foundation for a working, interoperating environment. With his focus on system design, Dr. Fonseca demonstrates how complicated processes can be integrated to the benefit of users. His newly developed concept of ontology-based GIS is highly interdisciplinary as it brings together various research methods from artificial intelligence",
