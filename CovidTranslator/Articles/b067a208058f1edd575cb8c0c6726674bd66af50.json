In the current study, a reverse genetic approach was used to define the role of the 28-kDa amino-terminal product (nsp1) of the gene 1 polyprotein during replication of the coronavirus murine hepatitis virus (MHV) in cell culture. To determine whether nsp1 is required for MHV replication and to identify residues critical for protein function, mutant viruses that contained deletions or point mutations within the nsp1-coding region were generated and assayed for defects in viral replication, viral protein expression, protein localization, and RNA synthesis. The results demonstrated that the carboxy-terminal half of nsp1 (residues K 124 through L 241 ) was dispensable for virus replication in culture but was required for efficient proteolytic cleavage of nsp1 from the gene 1 polyprotein and for optimal viral replication. Furthermore, whereas deletion of nsp1 residues amino-terminal to K 124 failed to produce infectious virus, point mutagenesis of the nsp1 amino-terminus allowed recovery of several mutants with altered replication and RNA synthesis. This study identifies nsp1 residues important for protein processing, viral RNA synthesis, and viral replication. D",

            "text": "Coronaviruses belong to a family of enveloped positivestrand RNA viruses that are responsible for devastating illnesses in livestock and domestic animals. The identification of a novel human coronavirus as the etiological agent of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003 highlighted the potential of this virus family to also cause severe human disease (Kuiken et al., 2003) . Even with continuing research addressing how coronaviruses replicate and cause disease, the functions of many viral proteins remain to be elucidated. For example, 14 -16 nonstructural proteins (nsps) are expressed from coronavirus gene 1 polyproteins, but at least seven of these nsps have no known roles in viral replication. In the past, gene 1 has been referred to as the ''replicase gene'' and gene 1 nsps as ''replicase proteins'' named by their molecular weight in kilodaltons. More recently, nsps have been named based on their order in gene 1 and are numbered consecutively beginning at the amino-terminus of the polyprotein (i.e., nsp1 through nsp16) (Harcourt et al., 2004; Prentice et al., 2004b; Snijder et al., 2003) . The gene 1 nsps of the coronavirus murine hepatitis virus (MHV) are similar in number, size, and organization to those of SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) (Marra et al., 2003; Snijder et al., 2003) . This resemblance suggests that MHV is an excellent model for studies of coronavirus nsp function and may 0042-6822/$ -see front matter D 2005 Elsevier Inc.

            "text": "Following entry of MHV into a host cell, the first event in the virus life cycle is translation of two polyproteins from gene 1 of the input RNA genome. Gene 1 is comprised of two overlapping open reading frames (ORF1a and ORF1b) that are connected by a \u00c01 ribosomal frameshift (Fig. 1A ) (Bonilla et al., 1994; Bredenbeek et al., 1990; Brierley et al., 1989; Lee et al., 1991; Pachuk et al., 1989) . Translation of either ORF1a or the ORF1ab fusion results in possible 495-kDa or 803-kDa polyproteins, respectively. These co-aminoterminal polyproteins are proteolytically processed by three virus-encoded proteinases, including two papain-like proteinases (PLP1 and PLP2 within nsp3) and a picoronavirus 3C-like proteinase (nsp5), to yield at least 16 mature gene 1 nsps as well as intermediate precursors. To date, all MHV gene 1 nsps tested co-localize with sites of active viral RNA synthesis at cytoplasmic viral replication complexes on intracellular double-membrane vesicles (Bost et al., 2000 (Bost et al., , 2001 Brockway et al., 2003 Brockway et al., , 2004 Gosert et al., 2002; Prentice et al., 2004a; Shi et al., 1999; van der Meer et al., 1999) . Nsps are thought to mediate replication of the MHV RNA genome and subgenomic RNA synthesis at these membrane-bound complexes. However, the viral proteinases are the only MHV nsps with experimentally confirmed functions (Baker et al., 1989; Bonilla et al., 1995; Lu et al., 1996; Lu et al., 1995) . Based on homology to proteins with known functions, roles in viral RNA synthesis have been predicted for several other MHV gene 1 nsps. These proteins include two trans-membrane scaffolding proteins (nsp4 and nsp6) (Gosert et al., 2002) , an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (nsp12) (Cheng et al., 2005; Gorbalenya et al., 1989; Lee et al., 1991) , an RNA helicase (nsp13) (Seybert and Ziebuhr, 2001; Seybert et al., 2000) , and several RNA processing enzymes (nsp14, nsp15, and nsp16) (Bhardwaj et al., 2004; Ivanov et al., 2004; Thiel et al., 2003; Ziebuhr, 2005) . Currently, there are no known or envisaged functions in replication for at least seven MHV gene 1 proteins (nsp1, nsp2, and nsp7 -11) .",

The kinetics of nsp1 expression suggest that it might have an early regulatory role during the viral life cycle. Nsp1 is the first mature protein processed from the gene 1 polyprotein and is likely cleaved quickly following trans- ORF1a -ORF1b fusion polyprotein is illustrated with mature nonstructural protein (nsps) represented as numbered boxes. The gray box represents the aminoterminal cleavage product (nsp1). Nsps with confirmed or predicted functions include: two papain-like proteinases (PLP1 and PLP2 within nsp3), the 3C-like proteinase (3CL pro ; nsp5), two trans-membrane proteins (MP1 and MP2; nsp4 and nsp6, respectively), the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (Pol; nsp12), the RNA helicase (Hel; nsp13), the 3V-to-5V exonuclease (Exo; nsp14), the endoribonuclease (Endo; nsp15), and the RNA methyltransferase (MT; nsp16). (B) Nsp1 mutant proteins. The schematics illustrate the engineered deletions and point mutations within nsp1. Nsp1 amino acid numbers are listed below each protein, and the predicted protein size (in kilodaltons) is listed to the right of each. The amino-terminal charge-to-alanine mutations for each VUSB mutants are listed below the bottom nsp1 protein. The asterisks (*) indicate mutants that did not establish productive infections as determined by lack of recovered virus from electroporated cells. lation of PLP1 within nsp3 (Baker et al., 1989 (Baker et al., , 1993 Denison and Perlman, 1987; Denison and Perlman, 1986; Denison et al., 1992 Denison et al., , 1995 . MHV mutants that are incapable of liberating nsp1 from the nascent polyprotein exhibit delayed replication, diminished peak titers, small plaques, and reduced RNA synthesis compared to wild-type controls . These results emphasize the importance of nsp1 cleavage for optimal viral RNA synthesis and suggest that nsp1 might play an important role at MHV replication complexes. In support of this notion, nsp1 localizes to replication complexes in the infected cell cytoplasm during times of peak viral RNA synthesis, and biochemical experiments demonstrate interactions between nsp1 and two other replication complexassociated proteins (nsp7 and nsp10) . However, later in infection, nsp1 is distinct from replication complexes and instead co-localizes with MHV structural proteins at virion assembly sites . It has also been reported that exogenous MHV nsp1 expression induces cell-cycle arrest (Chen et al., 2004) . Together, these results led to the hypothesis that nsp1 may participate in multiple stages of the MHV life cycle. Still, the function of this protein remains a mystery as analysis of nsp1 primary amino acid sequence does not reveal common motifs or protein homologs, and the nsp1 crystal structure has not been solved.",

The results demonstrate that the carboxy-terminal half of nsp1 is dispensable for replication in culture but is important for efficient proteolytic cleavage of the protein and optimal viral replication. In contrast, deletion of the entire nsp1 protein or a middle region of the protein resulted in the lack of virus recovered from electroporated cells.

            "text": "Antisera against nsp1 (a-nsp1) immunoprecipitated a 28-kDa protein (nsp1) from cells infected with icwt or the nsp1 point mutants (VUSB1, VUSB2, VUSB3, VUSB4, or VUSB7) (Fig. 3A) . Migration of VUSB7-nsp1 differed from icwt and all other point mutants, suggesting differences in protein folding or charge. No 28-kDa proteins were immunoprecipitated from mock-infected cell lysates or from lysates generated from cells infected with the nsp1DC virus ( Fig. 3A) . Rather, from nsp1DC-infected cell lysate, a-nsp1 immunoprecipitated a unique 14-kDa protein, the predicted size of nsp1DC, as well as a previously undescribed 80-kDa protein (Fig. 3A) . In both VUSB4-and nsp1DC-infected cells, several additional proteins (30 to 60 kDa) of unknown identity were also precipitated using a-nsp1 (Fig. 3A ). Antisera against nsp2 (a-nsp2) immunoprecipitated a 65-kDa protein (nsp2) from all infected cell lysates, but not from mock-infected lysates (Fig. 3B ). Similar to the result using a-nsp1, an 80-kDa protein was also detected by a-nsp2 in nsp1DC-infected cells (Fig. 3B ). Antisera against nsp8 (a-nsp8) immunoprecipitated a 22-kDa protein (nsp8) from all infected cell lysates, but not from mock-infected cell lysates (Fig. 3C ). The viral structural protein S, N, and M were detected in all infected cell lysates using antisera against virions (a-MHV) (Fig. 3D ). The nsp1 mutants showed band intensities slightly increased compared with icwt. The reason for this difference in band intensity is unknown but might be a reflection of more protein synthesis or processing with the mutants at the time of label. Still, although the amount of protein detected differed slightly, the results show that amino-terminal nsp1 point mutants do not have defects in their capacities to express or process viral proteins. Nonetheless, the detection of an 80-kDa protein from nsp1DC-infected cells using either a-nsp1 or a-nsp2 suggests that cleavage of nsp1DC from nsp2 may be inefficient. Fig. 3 . Nsp1 mutant viral protein expression and processing. Cytoplasmic lysates were generated from radiolabeled DBT-9 cells that were either mock-infected (m) or infected with icwt or nsp1 mutant viruses. Labeled proteins were immunoprecipitated from cytoplasmic lysates with the indicated polyclonal antisera. Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE in 5 -18% polyacrylamide gradient gels and visualized following fluorography. Images were obtained following 4-day film exposure. Bands corresponding to unique or predicted proteins are indicated on the right of the fluorograms, and molecular weight standards (in kilodaltons) are shown on the left.

Total viral and cellular RNA was extracted from cell lysates, and radioactivity in each sample was quantitated using liquid scintillation. Equal amounts of radiolabeled viral RNA (equal CPM) were separated by electrophoresis in formaldehyde/agarose gels and then visualized following fluorography. All seven species of MHV viral RNA were detected with the nsp1 mutant viruses and icwt. Interestingly, with the nsp1DC virus, an additional band that migrated above RNA4 was consistently detected. The identity of this band is not known, but it might represent a more stable replicative intermediate or a new subgenomic RNA species. Still, the approximate ratio of RNA1 (genome) to RNA7 for each nsp1 mutant was similar to that of icwt, suggesting that nsp1 mutants do not have specific defects in either genome replication or subgenomic RNA synthesis as detected by this assay.",

In the current study, a reverse genetic approach was used to investigate the role of nsp1 during MHV replication in cell culture and to identify residues critical for its function. It was shown that viruses containing deletions within nsp1 amino-terminal to K 124 are not capable of establishing productive infections, suggesting that residues essential for MHV viability reside within the amino-terminal half of the protein. Several such residues were identified using point mutagenesis, and the importance of the nsp1 for viral replication and RNA synthesis was characterized. Moreover, the results show that the carboxyterminal half of nsp1 is not required for MHV to complete its life cycle but is necessary for efficient cleavage of nsp1 from the gene 1 polyprotein and for optimal viral replication. Together, these data are consistent with the hypothesis that MHV nsp1 contains at least two domains important for virus replication: (1) an essential aminoterminal domain involved in viral RNA synthesis and (2) a non-essential carboxy-terminal domain that influences CS1 cleavage efficiency.",

Deletion of different portions of the nsp1 amino-terminal half, as was done with nsp1DFL and nsp1DMid, was not tolerated for virus viability. This result is consistent with the idea that critical replication determinants reside within the region spanning residues M 1 through P 123 . Charge-to-alanine mutagenesis identified four candidate residues (R 64 and E 69 with VUSB5; R 78 and D 79 with VUSB6), all or any of which may be vital for some stage of the MHV life cycle. In cells transfected with RNA genomes for these nonproductive mutants (nsp1DFL, nsp1DMid, VUSB5, or VUSB6), foci containing 5 -10 cell nuclei were seen. How these foci form in electroporated cell monolayers is unknown, but the presence of this CPE suggests that transient viral gene expression may have occurred. However, no viral protein was detected in transfected cell monolayers by immunoprecipitation or immunofluorescence assays, and RT-PCR did not amplify subgenomic RNA, indicating that, if gene expression occurred, it was below the limits of detection using these assays. Consequently, the exact stage of the MHV life cycle at which these mutant viruses are blocked could not be determined. Still, the result that nsp1DFL, nsp1DMid, VUSB5, or VUSB6 did not establish productive infections underscores the importance of the nsp1 amino-terminus and suggests that this protein has a critical function during viral replication.",

VUSB1 and VUSB4 were the most defective and resulted in viral titers approximately 0.2-to 1.3-log reduced compared with icwt. These two viruses also exhibited small plaque phenotypes, suggesting defects in cell-to-cell spread. The reduced replication and small plaques seen with VUSB1 and VUSB4 are most likely a reflection of reduced viral gene expression as both of these nsp1 point mutants showed significantly lower levels of viral RNA. Interestingly, compared with icwt, VUSB3 had increased levels of viral RNA associated with a slight reduction in viral replication, suggesting that any deviation from wild-type viral RNA levels may negatively impact viral replication. There were no detectable differences in the ratios of genome RNA versus subgenomic RNAs for any of the viable nsp1 mutants. These results suggest that nsp1 might play a role in the regulation of total viral RNA amounts rather than in species-specific viral RNA synthesis. It has been previously shown that MHV mutants unable to liberate nsp1 from the gene 1 polyprotein (DCS1 mutants) exhibit phenotypes very similar to the nsp1 mutant viruses described in this study . Because the DCS1 mutations resulted in a noncleaved nsp1-nsp2 fusion protein, it could not be concluded that the viral phenotypes were solely related to defects in nsp1 function. This study corroborates and extends these previous findings and directly correlates mutations in the MHV nsp1-coding region with changes in viral replication and RNA synthesis.",

Why is the nsp1 amino-terminus required for MHV replication? What function does this domain have during MHV RNA synthesis? Do the deletion and point mutations change the nature of nsp1 -protein interactions? Yeast two-hybrid and co-immunoprecipitation assays previously demonstrated that wild-type nsp1 directly binds to nsp7 and nsp10, two other gene 1 proteins . The interactions between nsp1, nsp7, and nsp10 do not require the nsp1 carboxy-terminus (F 167 through G 247 ) but do require residues amino-terminal to F 167 (i.e., residues E 84 through R 166 ). Because the nsp1DMid virus was engineered to lack this putative interaction domain, it is interesting to speculate whether the lack of viability for this mutant correlates with a loss of nsp1 binding to either nsp7 and/or nsp10. Furthermore, it is thought that charge-to-alanine mutagenesis alters a protein's capacity to participate in interand intra-molecular interactions (Cunningham and Wells, 1989) . This mutagenesis approach is supposed to minimize disruption of protein secondary structure; however, it is possible that some of the charge-to-alanine mutations caused nsp1 to misfold. In support of this possibility, VUSB1-nsp1 was detected by a-nsp1 antisera during immunoprecipitation assays but not during immunofluorescence assays, suggesting that this mutant protein may have a different structural conformation. Regardless, the introduced mutations may have altered the capacity of nsp1 to bind to nsp7, nsp10, or other proteins resulting in viral RNA synthesis and viral replication defects.",

Immediately following translation of PLP1 within nsp3, CS1 is rapidly cleaved, releasing nsp1 as polyprotein synthesis continues (Denison et al., 1992 Harcourt et al., 2004; Schiller et al., 1998) . Next, cleavage site 3 (CS3) is cleaved (likely by PLP2) liberating an nsp2 -nsp3 precursor, which is finally processed at cleavage site 2 (CS2) to release mature nsp2 and nsp3 products (Denison et al., 1992 Harcourt et al., 2004; Schiller et al., 1998) . In nsp1DC virus-infected cells, nsp1DC (14-kDa) and nsp2 are present, demonstrating that the carboxy-terminal half of nsp1 is not absolutely essential for cleavage at either CS1 or CS2. However, the identification of an 80-kDa nsp1DC -nsp2 polypeptide in nsp1DC virus-infected cells reveals that this region of the protein (residues K 124 through L 241 ) is important for efficient CS1 processing. Fig. 7 . Model of icwt and nsp1DC virus protein processing. Shown are schematics of wild-type and nsp1DC virus amino-terminal gene 1 nsps (boxes). PLP1 and PLP2 are shown as gray boxes within nsp3. The individual cleavage sites are labeled, and the order of processing is indicated above the closed arrowheads. Lines below the protein schematics illustrate the size of mature proteins following cleavage at individual sites. (A) Processing of wild-type nsp1, nsp2, and nsp3. During infection, nsp1 (28 kDa) is cleaved rapidly at cleavage site 1 (CS1) as the polyprotein is translated (indicated by forward slashes). Next, cleavage site 3 (CS3) is processed to yield a 275-kDa nsp2 -nsp3 precursor. Finally, cleavage site 2 (CS2) is cleaved to liberate nsp2 (65 kDa) and nsp3 (210 kDa). (B) Wildtype pattern of processing for nsp1DC mutant. The order of cleavage for nsp1DC mutant polyprotein is identical to that of icwt. Nsp1DC protein (DC; 14 kDa) is liberated by CS1 cleavage. Next, CS3 is processed to yield a 275-kDa nsp2 -nsp3 precursor. Finally, CS2 is cleaved to liberate nsp2 (65 kDa) and nsp3 (210 kDa). (C) Alternative pattern of processing for nsp1DC mutant. If CS1 is not initially cleaved, a 290-kDa nsp1DC -nsp2 -nsp3 precursor is made following CS3 processing. This precursor is then cleaved at CS2 to yield an 80-kDa protein (nsp1DC -nsp2) and nsp3.",

If the mutant polyprotein is folded in such a manner that CS1 is accessible by the proteinase, then this site is cleaved normally and the mutant polyprotein follows a wild-type pattern of processing (Fig. 7B) . Alternatively, if the mutant polyprotein is folded in a way that masks CS1, this site is not processed and nsp1DC remains fused to nsp2 (Fig. 7C ). In this model, an nsp1DC-nsp2 -nsp3 precursor is the first processed protein following CS3 cleavage. This polypeptide is then processed at CS2 to yield the 80-kDa protein (nsp1DC -nsp2) and nsp3. Although the high molecular weight precursors were not detected in these studies, the kinetics of appearance for nsp1DC, nsp2, and the 80-kDa protein are compatible with the proposed model. During pulse-chase experiments, nsp1DC and nsp2 are first detected in nsp1DC virus-infected cells with the same timing as the corresponding nsp1 and nsp2 proteins in icwt-infected cells. However, the expression kinetics for the 80-kDa protein are unlike either nsp1 or nsp2, suggesting that the timing and order of polyprotein processing are different under circumstances where CS1 is not immediately cleaved. Whether the 80-kDa protein is capable of being subsequently processed into nsp1DC and nsp2 could not be determined from these studies. At extended times p.c. (360 min), the 80-kDa protein is still detectable, albeit at slightly reduced levels, and there is no new accumulation of nsp1DC at this same time. These data are most consistent with the idea that the 80-kDa protein is not further processed once it is generated.",

The identity of this RNA band remains to be determined, but it might represent a stable replicative intermediate and implies that this mutant virus may have minor defects in discontinuous transcription. Another interesting possibility is that this band might represent a new species of subgenomic RNA. Because some molecules of nsp1DC are fused to nsp2, defects in nsp2 function may contribute to the mutant viral phenotype. Alternatively, the reduced replication of the nsp1DC virus might suggest that nsp1 plays an important role downstream of viral RNA synthesis, such as in virion assembly. At late times of infection, wild-type nsp1 co-localizes with the MHV structural protein M at virion assembly sites . Because the a-nsp1 antisera used in this study also detects the 80-kDa nsp1DC -nsp2 protein, we were unable to precisely determine whether the 14-kDa nsp1DC protein is capable of localizing to virion assembly sites late in infection.

However, it is important to note the limitations of the reverse genetic approach used in this study and to explore alternative explanations of the available data. For example, it has been reported that exogenous MHV nsp1 expression induces cell-cycle arrest (Chen et al., 2004) . Therefore, it is also possible that the nsp1 mutations have an indirect effect on MHV replication as a result of cell biological changes during infection. Moreover, while it is clear that some of the nsp1 mutants have differences in nsp1 confirmation and interactions, it is possible that uncharacterized RNA structural elements have also been disrupted as a result of nsp1 mutagenesis resulting in changes in viral RNA synthesis and replication. Furthermore, in the absence of sequencing the entire 32-kb genomes of the nsp1 mutant viruses, the possibility that other mutations contribute to the described phenotypes cannot be excluded. To rule out the contributions of other mutations or RNA elements, wild-type nsp1 expressed in cells must complement the defects of these viruses. While ideal, trans-complementation using protein expression has not been successful for coronaviruses. In fact, efficient complementation for other positive-strand RNA viruses has required the development of replicon systems to facilitate viral replication complex formation (Appel et al., 2005; Grassmann et al., 2001; Khromykh et al., 1998; Lindenbach and Rice, 1997; Liu et al., 2002) . Despite these limitations, this is the first report of detailed mutagenesis of an MHV gene 1 nsp-coding region within the context of a virus. These results will enhance our knowledge of MHV replication determinants, and future analysis of nsp1 mutant viruses will provide greater insight into the function of RNA and protein elements within the 5V end of gene 1. Even more, studies with these engineered mutant viruses are expected to contribute to understanding the replication strategies of other coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV.",

All assembled viruses, including the wildtype control (icwt), were generated using the icMHV fragment F plasmid corresponding to the virulent VUSS3 strain (Sperry et al., 2005) . Plasmids containing the cDNA cassettes of the MHV genome were digested using MluI and BsmBI for fragment A, BglI and BsmBI for fragments B and C, NciI and BsmBI for fragments D and E, BsmBI for F, and SfiI and BsmBI for fragment G. Gel purified restriction fragments were ligated together using T4 DNA ligase (New England Biolabs) in a total reaction volume of 150 Al at 16 -C overnight. Following chloroform extraction and isopropanol precipitation of ligated cDNA, full-length transcripts of icMHV RNA were generated in vitro using the mMessage mMachine T7 Transcription Kit (Ambion) according to the manufacturer's protocol with the following modifications. Fifty microliter reactions were supplemented with 7.5 Al of 30 mM GTP, and transcription was performed at 40.5 -C for 25 min, 37.5 -C for 50 min, and 40.5 -C for 25 min. In parallel, RNA transcripts encoding the MHV nucleocapsid protein (N) were generated from N cDNA. N transcripts and icMHV genomic RNA were then mixed and electroporated into BHK-MHVR cells. Briefly, BHK-MHVR cells were grown to sub-confluence, trypsinized, then washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and resuspended in PBS at 10 7 cells/ml. Six hundred microliters cells were then added to RNA transcripts in a 4-mm gap electroporation cuvette, and three electrical pulses of 850 V at 25 AF were delivered with a Gene Pulser II electroporator (Bio-Rad). Transfected cells were then seeded on a monolayer of 10 6 uninfected DBT-9 cells in a 150 cm 2 flask and incubated at either 37 -C or 32 -C for 24 to 96 h. Virus viability was determined by syncytia formation in the electroporated cell culture and by the capacity of the clarified transfected cell supernatant to induce syncytia in a monolayer of fresh DBT-9 cells.",
