EToV and was successfully propagated in cell culture -in lines of equine dermis or embryonic mule skin cells, where it causes a cytopathic effect that results in cell lysis. While Berne virus was not neutralized by antisera against known equine viruses, serologic cross-reactions were observed in neutralization tests and ELISA using sera from calves that had been experimentally infected with morphologically similar particles, then baptized 'Breda' viruses. The first 'Breda' bovine torovirus (BToV) was discovered in 1979 during an investigation in a dairy herd in Breda (Iowa), in which severe neonatal calf diarrhea had been a problem for three consecutive years. After this initial report, other strains of BToV were identified in beef calves from Ohio, and in a colostrum-deprived (CD) calf from Iowa. Most of the studies on the pathogenesis and pathology of torovirus infections have been done in BToV-infected gnotobiotic (Gn) and CD calves, as well as in limited field studies; in contrast, most of the biochemistry and morphogenesis data on toroviruses are based on EToV studies.",

Subsequently, another Japanese group isolated four more cytopathogenic BToV strains in HRT-18 cells used for the first BToV strain, but could not in HRT-18 cells used for bovine coronavirus. This indicates that cytopathogenic BToVs were preferentially propagated under the particular conditions, including the source of the HRT-18 cells used.

The term torus (Latin) refers to the circular convex molding in the form of a doughnut that some columns or pilaster have at their bases; indeed it was the unique biconcave disk and C-shape of the virion in the extracellular environment that suggested this naming. Since 1992, the genus Torovirus has been included in the family Coronaviridae, based on their similar genomic organization and replication strategies. Toro-and coronaviruses are also ancestrally related: their polymerase and envelope genes diverged from those of a common predecessor. Because of their inclusion in the family Coronaviridae, the nomenclature for coronavirus genes, mRNAs, and structural proteins have been also applied to toroviruses. However, the lack of sequence homology in the structural genes and the absence of antigenic relatedness with coronaviruses justify their taxonomic position as a separate genus. The International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) presently recognizes four species in the genus Torovirus: EToV, BToV, PToV, and HToV.",

The complete genome sequence of toroviruses is reported in BToV and PToV, comprising 28 475 and 28 301 nucleotides which contain six ORFs (see Figure 1 ). ORF1a and ORF1b are the most proximal 5' reading frames and constitute the replicase (RNA dependent RNA polymerase) gene, which is expressed as a large precursor protein directly from the genomic RNA by a ribosomal frameshift mechanism, similar to other nidoviruses. The large product of these ORFs is apparently involved in the synthesis of a negative-strand RNA and the onset of subgenomic RNA synthesis. The other four ORFs correspond to structural protein genes and are expressed by the production of a 3'-coterminal nested set of four mRNAs. The ORF2, ORF3, ORF4, and ORF5 of BToV and PToV encode the spike (S), membrane (M), hemagglutinin-esterase (HE), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins, respectively. The bioinformatics analysis reveals CUG-initiated coding sequence, overlapping 5' end of BToV and EToV ORF1a and encoding a novel 30 kDa product. Further studies should identify a novel 30 kDa product by means of immunoassays with its specific antibodies and its function. ",

Similar polypeptides of 20, 37, 85, and 105 kDa have been identified in purified BToV by means of surface radioiodination. The N protein (167 aa) is the most abundant polypeptide found in the virion (80-84%) with a predicted molecular weight of 18.3-19.2 kDa. Blotting experiments performed with EToV have identified this internal protein as the only RNA-binding polypeptide in the virion. The M glycoprotein (233 aa, 26.5 kDa) is the second most abundant protein ($13%) and is probably associated with the envelope. Computer analysis has revealed characteristics of a class III membrane protein lacking a cleaved signal sequence, but containing three successive transmembrane a-helices in the N-terminal half.

The torovirus HE is a class I membrane N-glycosylated protein (416-417 aa) of 65 kDa that is also located in the torovirus envelope. It has an N-terminal signal sequence, a C-terminal transmembrane domain, several N-glycosylation sites and a putative 'FGDS' motif which displays acetylesterase activity specific for N-acetyl-9-O-acetylneuraminic acid. The HE proteins of BToV and PToV could use N-acetyl-9-Oacetylneuraminic acid as a second receptor.

EToV is remarkably stable in the environment, and relatively resistant to phospholipase C, trypsin, chymotrypsin, and even deoxycholate; however, Triton X-100 and organic solvents destroy its infectivity. EToV is stable within a wide range of pH, being inactivated only below pH 2.5 or above pH 10.3. BToV1 appears to be less stable than both EToV and BToV2 as changes in its sedimentation behavior and density have been observed after prolonged storage at \u00c070 C. The infectivity of a fecal preparation containing BToV1 has been reported to be lost completely after 3 weeks at 4 C, whereas EToV in cell-free supernatant remained stable for 92 days. Storage of toroviruses at \u00c020 to \u00c070 C helps to preserve infectivity. However, even at these temperatures the viruses will deteriorate, though at a slower rate.

EToV RNAs 1, 2, and 3 are transcribed independently, as has been shown by UV transcription mapping.

It is unknown whether the accumulation of nucleocapsids in the nucleus reflects a nuclear phase in the replication of EToV or some sort of defective assembly. Viruses predominantly bud into the lumen of Golgi cisternae. The preformed nucleocapsid tubules approach the Golgi membrane with one of the rounded ends oriented towards the membrane and attach to it laterally. During budding, the nucleocapsid is apparently stabilized, leading to a higher electron density and a constant diameter (23 nm). Release into the intestinal lumen is probably through reverse pinocytosis. Virus maturation apparently occurs intracellularly during the egress process, where the virus nucleocapsid appearance changes from a straight rod (intracellular) into a torus shape (extracellular).

BToV have also been detected by ELISA and/or RT-PCR in cases of gastroenteritis in cattle. Up to 44% of the BToV-positive samples from these cases did not contain other major enteric pathogens. Calves up to 4 months of age are highly susceptible to diarrhea induced by BToV, especially those below 3 weeks of age. The virus has also been recognized in 5-6-month-old beef calves arriving from sales barns. Intermittent BToV shedding can occur in young calves during the first 10 months of life. Older calves and adult animals can also shed BToV at different ages, perhaps by intermittent subclinical infections or by contracting new BToV infections. Levels of maternal BToV-specific antibodies circulating in the calf influence the clinical outcome of the infection; a seronegative neonatal calf is about 7 times more likely to develop diarrhea than a seropositive calf.",

Oral inoculation of calves with BToV has been shown to induce diarrhea with virus shed in feces under experimental conditions. The nasal route is another possible pathway for entry as BToV antigen and viral RNA have been detected in the nasal secretions of feedlot calves. Additionally, diarrhea has been induced after intranasal inoculation in Gn and CD calves. For bovine coronavirus (BCoV), respiratory tract infections have been reported to occur prior to enteric infections, indicating the possible importance of this route of transmission in the spread and pathogenesis of this distantly related group of enteric nidoviruses. It is possible that BToV, like BCoV, could initially replicate in nasal epithelial cells, and thereby amplify before being swallowed and infecting the intestinal tract. This hypothesis of BToV dual tropisms and its role on the virus pathogenesis should be further studied.",

Twentyfour to 72 h post-exposure, the first clinical signs are observed (mild fever, depression, weakness, and anorexia), followed by a greenish-yellow to bright yellow watery diarrhea that lasts for 3-5 days. Calves may develop severe dehydration and die. Fecal virus shedding begins 24-72 h post-infection, coinciding with the onset of diarrhea, and lasts for 2-6 days. Shedding peaks around 3-4 days post-infection. Mixed infections with other enteric viruses, such as rotaviruses or astroviruses, result in a more severe watery diarrhea than is induced by either virus alone. In CD calves with a normal intestinal flora, diarrhea is generally more severe than in Gn calves. Sporadic and recurrent shedding of BToV can last for up to 4 months. BToV has also been detected in nasal samples. Further studies are needed to analyze BToV replication and shedding in the respiratory tract as well as its role in respiratory pathologies.",

As shown by immunofluorescence, both crypt and villus epithelial cells contain antigen.
