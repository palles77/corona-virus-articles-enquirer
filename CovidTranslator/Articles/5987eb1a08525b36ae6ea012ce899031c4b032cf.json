            "text": "The frameshift signal of the avian coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) contains two cis-acting signals essential for ef\u00aecient frameshifting, a heptameric slippery sequence (UUUAAAC) and an RNA pseudoknot structure located downstream. The frameshift takes place at the slippery sequence with the two ribosome-bound tRNAs slipping back simultaneously by one nucleotide from the zero phase (U UUA AAC) to the \u00c01 phase (UUU AAA). Asparaginyl-tRNA, which decodes the A-site codon AAC, has the modi\u00aeed base Q at the wobble position of the anticodon (5 H QUU 3 H ) and it has been speculated that Q may be required for frameshifting. To test this, we measured frameshifting in cos cells that had been passaged in growth medium containing calf serum or horse serum. Growth in horse serum, which contains no free queuine, eliminates Q from the cellular tRNA population upon repeated passage. Over ten cell passages, however, we found no signi\u00aecant difference in frameshift ef\u00aeciency between the cell types, arguing against a role for Q in frameshifting. We con\u00aermed that the cells cultured in horse serum were devoid of Q by purifying tRNAs and assessing their Q-content by tRNA transglycosylase assays and coupled HPLC-mass spectroscopy. Supplementation of the growth medium of cells grown either on horse serum or calf serum with free queuine had no effect on frameshifting either. These \u00aendings were recapitulated in an in vitro system using rabbit reticulocyte lysates that had been largely depleted of endogenous tRNAs and resupplemented with Q-free or Q-containing tRNA populations. Thus Q-base is not required for frameshifting at the IBV signal and some other explanation is required to account for the slipperiness of eukaryotic asparaginyl-tRNA.",

The mRNA signals that specify frameshifting are comprised of two essential elements; a heptanucleotid\u00e8`s lippery'' sequence, where the ribosome changes reading frame, and a stimulatory region of RNA secondary structure, often in the form of an RNA pseudoknot, located a few nucleotides downstream (Jacks et al., 1988; Brierley et al., 1989; Ten Dam et al., 1990) . The heptanucleotide stretch that forms the slippery sequence contains two homopolymeric triplets and conforms in the vast majority of cases to the motif XXXYYYN. Frameshifting at this sequence is thought to occur by simultaneous slippage of two ribosome-bound tRNAs, presumably peptidyl and aminoacyl tRNAs, which are translocated from the zero (X XXY YYN) to the \u00c01 phase (XXX YYY) (Jacks et al., 1988) .",

These codons are decoded by tRNAs with a highly modi\u00aeed base in the anticodon loop (see Hat\u00aeeld et al., 1992 and references therein). In tRNA Asn (AAC, AAU), the wobble base is Q, in tRNA Phe (UUC, UUU), wyebutoxine (Y) is present just 3 H of the anticodon, in tRNA Lys (AAA, AAG), the wobble base is 5-methylaminomethyl-2-thiouridine (mnm 5 s 2 U) (prokaryotes) and in tRNA Leu (UUA), 2-methyl-5-formylcytidine is present at the wobble position (Debarros et al., 1996) . Hat\u00aeeld and colleagues (Hat\u00aeeld et al., 1992) have suggested that hypomodi\u00aeed variants of these tRNAs may exist that function as speci\u00aec``shifty'' tRNAs, since such variants will have a considerably less bulky anticodon and be more free to move around at the decoding site. Experimentally, however, no consensus has emerged regarding a role for hypomodi\u00aeed tRNAs in frameshifting. Indirect support for the hypothesis has come from an examination of the modi\u00aecation status of the anticodons of the aminoacyl-tRNAs that are required for translation at and around the frameshift sites of human immunode\u00aeciency virus type 1 (HIV-1), human T-cell leukaemia virus type I (HTLV-1) and bovine leukaemia virus (BLV) (Hat\u00aeeld et al., 1989) . It was found that in HIV-1-infected cells, most of the tRNA Phe lacked Y-base and in HTLV-1 and BLV-infected cells, most of the tRNA Asn lacked Q-base. In contrast, it has been shown that the frameshift ef\u00aeciency of the HIV-1 signal in T-lymphoid cell lines remains unchanged in cells uninfected or chronically infected with HIV-1 (Cassan et al., 1994) and also during a time-course of HIV-1 infection of CD4-expressing 293 cells (Reil et al., 1994) . A comparison of the two sets of experiments is dif\u00aecult, however, since in each case, only one parameter, either frameshift ef\u00aeciency or modi\u00aecation status of the cellular tRNA population, was assessed.",

It was thus necessary to con\u00aerm that the key requirements for frameshifting, namely the slippery sequence and RNA pseudoknot (Brierley et al., 1991 (Brierley et al., , 1992 , were retained in vivo. The starting point for this analysis was the frameshift reporter construct pAC74Z (Stahl et al., 1995) . This plasmid contains, under the control of the SV40 early promoter, b-galactosidase (b-gal) and luciferase (luc) reporter genes separated by a short linker into which candidate frameshift signals can be inserted. The minimal IBV frameshift signal (Brierley et al., 1992) was inserted into this intergenic region as a set of complementary oligonucleotides (see Materials and Methods) in such a way that the expression of luc, as a carboxy-terminal extension of the upstream b-gal, required a \u00c01 frameshift at the IBV slippery sequence (pACFS1). In order to quantify the frameshift ef\u00aeciency, a\u01f9`i n-frame'' version of pACFS1 was prepared in which the two reporter genes were in the same frame and luc expression was independent of a frameshift event (pACFS2). Indeed, every frameshift site variant tested was matched with an individual in-frame construct (see Table 1 ). Although this increased the number of constructs generated, it ensured that any amino acid changes introduced into the linker region, potentially changing the stability of the b-gal-luc fusion protein, were also present in the corresponding control construct, allowing a valid comparison to be made. The inframe controls contained two changes; the spacing distance was increased from six to seven nucleotides to align b-gal and luc in the same frame (by insertion of an appropriate nucleotide immediately downstream of the slippery sequence) and the slippery sequence was changed to UUUAAAG, a change known to greatly reduce frameshifting in RRL (Brierley et al., 1992) . Inactivation of the slippery sequence was important, since if this was not done, any ribosomes that frameshifted on the mRNA would terminate shortly after, decreasing b-gal-luc levels and introducing errors.",

In contrast to the very high levels of frameshifting seen with the minimal IBV pseudoknot in RRL (45 %; Napthine et al., 1999) , only about 9 % of ribosomes changed frame in vivo, a \u00aevefold reduction. However, the response to frameshift signal variants was broadly similar to that seen in earlier in vitro studies. Firstly, frameshifting was sensitive to changes in the last nucleotide of the slippery sequence. The hierarchy of frameshifting for UUUAAAN variants closely paralleled that seen in RRL (Brierley et al., 1992) with C the most ef\u00aecient (9 %/45 % [cos/RRL]) then A (8 %/ 25 %), U (5.8 %/22 %) and \u00aenally G (0.5 %/1 %). Secondly, frameshifting was RNA pseudoknot speci\u00aec. Complete removal of the pseudoknotdramatically reduced frameshifting (pACFS41; 0.05 %) and high levels of frameshifting were not supported by a large stem-loop structure of the same predicted size and nucleotide composition as the stacked stems of the pseudoknot (pACFS5, 1.6 %). The pattern of frameshifting observed for mutations within the pseudoknot closely paralleled that seen in the RRL, in that destabilisation of either stem of the pseudoknot reduced frameshifting ef\u00aeciency dramatically (pACFS9, 13 in stem 1; pACFS 21 and 25 in stem 2) and compensatory mutations predicted to restore the structure increased frameshifting (pACFS17 in stem 1, 4 %; pACFS29 in stem 2, 6.5 %). A failure to restore fully the ef\u00aeciency of frameshifting with compensatory changes in stem 1 has been documented in a number of studies of eukaryotic frameshifting (e.g. see Ten Dam et al., 1995) and may re\u00afect a functional requirement for a particular pseudoknot The minimal IBV frameshift site in pACFS1 contains a slippery sequence (UUUAAAC) that is separated by a 6 nt spacer (UGAUAC) from the IBV minimal pseudoknot (PK) structure. Derivatives of the frameshift site (pACFS2-42) carried changes in the seventh nucleotide of the slippery sequence (bold), single nucleotide insertions into the spacer region (bold), or the pseudoknot was disrupted, deleted (no structure) or replaced by a stem-loop (SL) structure of the same predicted length and base-pair composition as the pseudoknot.",

Frameshifting was measured at each cell passage in three transient transfection experiments and the average values and range are shown. (b) cos cells were cultured over ten passages in medium containing either 10 % FCS or 10 % HS. After this time, a further ten passages were performed in the same medium, or in medium containing exogenous q-base (at 300 nM).

Controls included commercial yeast and tyrosinyl tRNAs, and tRNAs extracted from baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells. tRNAs within 72 hours (Langgut & Reisser, 1995) . To this end, cells that had been passaged ten times in medium containing either HS or FCS were supplemented with free q-base at 300 nM and passaged a further ten times. To control for the effects of the q-supplementation, cos cell passage was also continued in unsupplemented FCS or HS-containing medium. Each time the cells were split, transfections with the frameshift reporter plasmids pACFS1 and pACFS2 were carried out as above and frameshift ef\u00aeciency measured. As can be seen in Figure 2 (b) the frameshifting ef\u00aeciencies in the four cos cell populations (FCS, FCS q, HS and HS q) were found to be very similar to each other and to those measured in the previous analysis (Figure 2 (a)), between 8 % and 12 %, with no noticeable effect of q-supplementation. Nevertheless, it was important to determine the Q-content of the various tRNA populations. To this end, cellular tRNAs were puri\u00aeed and assayed for Q-content enzymically, using the E. coli tRNA guanine transglycosylase (TGT) assay and biophysically, by HPLC-combined mass spectrometry. The TGT assay exploits the inability of bacterial TGT to recognise q or Q as a substrate; the enzyme can use only a q precursor or guanine in an exchange reaction in the anticodon. When offered hypomodi\u00aeed tRNAs of the Q-family (tRNA Asn , tRNA Asp , tRNA His , tRNA Tyr ) and a radioactive guanine isotope, the bacterial TGT introduces the radioactive isotope into the anticodon loop in a base exchange reaction (Okada et al., 1978) . Thus the incorporation of the radioactive isotope is a direct measure of the Q-content of tRNA.",

Those tRNAs that were expected to be hypomodi\u00aeed (yeast, HS) were good substrates for TGT.

            "text": "From this experiment, we concluded that growth in HS did eliminate Q from the cos cell tRNAs and that supplementation with free q restored the level of Q. Furthermore, the addition of q to cells grown in FCS did not alter the guanine exchange activity of the tRNAs, suggesting that the tRNAs already contained high levels of Q. Consistent with this is the observation that the level of guanine exchange seen with the tRNAs was similar to that seen with the hypermodi\u00aeed tRNA Tyr . To con\u00aerm these data biophysically, the puri\u00aeed tRNAs were subjected to combined HPLC-mass spectrometry. As judged by HPLC analysis, the HS-derived tRNA was free of Q, and the FCSderived tRNA was Q-containing (Figure 3(a) and (b)). As expected, addition of q to HS medium restored the Q-modi\u00aecation in tRNA (Figure 3(c) ), whereas addition of q to FCS medium did not signi\u00aecantly increase the Q-content of the tRNA (Figure 3(d) ), indicating that tRNA from cells grown in FCS medium is fully modi\u00aeed. The separation of manQ and galQ (glycosylated derivatives (mannose and galactose) of Q present in mammalian cells) from other compounds was not optimal using the gradient adapted for mass spectrometry. To detect the presence of manQ and galQ in tRNA, mass spectrometric analysis in the form of selected-ion recordings was carried out. The ions used for detection of Q was m/z 410 and for manQ/galQ m/z 572. The analyses revealed that tRNA from cells grown in FCS medium with or without added q and in HS medium with added q, contained Q, manQ and galQ (Figure 3 (e) and data not shown). No ion corresponding to Q or manQ/galQ could be detected in tRNA from cells grown in HS medium (data not shown). In conclusion, tRNA from cells grown in HS medium lack Q-derived nucleosides, while tRNA from cells grown in FCS medium is fully modi\u00aeed with respect to these nucleosides.",

            "text": "We went on to test the in\u00afuence of Q on in vitro frameshifting, using a tRNA-dependent in vitro translation system (unpublished results). RRL was depleted of tRNAs by gel \u00aeltration through an ethanolamine DEAE-Sepharose column and fractions judged to be greater than 90 % depleted of tRNA, yet retaining all other nucleic acid species, were used in translation assays. The nucleic acid content of such a depleted fraction is shown in Figure 4 (Brierley et al., 1992) , which contains the same minimal IBV frameshift signal as used in pACFS1 cloned into the in\u00afuenza A/PR/8/34 PB2 gene (Brierley et al., 1992) at a unique BglII site. Transcription of BamHI-digested pFScass 6 in vitro using SP6 RNA polymerase generates a 2.4 kb mRNA that when translated in RRL yields a 19 kDa non-frameshifted species and a 28 kDa \u00c01 frameshift product. Transfer RNAdepleted RRL was programmed with capped pFScass 6/BamHI mRNA and supplemented with either Q-containing (FCS-grown cos cells, BHK cells, q-supplemented cos-FCS and q-supplemented cos-HS cells) or Q-free tRNAs (HSgrown cos cells, yeast tRNAs). The translation products, along with the calculated frameshift ef\u00aeciencies, are shown in Figure 4 (b). As controls, translations were also carried out with undepleted RRL, undepleted RRL that had been diluted 30 % to account for the dilution that occurs during chromatographic depletion of tRNAs, and depleted RRL that was supplemented with calf-liver tRNA (the tRNA used to supplement standard RRL translations (Jackson & Hunt 1983) ). The translation of the pFScass 6 mRNA in the undepleted lysates (Figure 4, lanes 2 and 4) yielded the expected 19 kDa non-frameshifted and 28 kDa \u00c01 frameshifted products and the frameshift ef\u00aeciency was about 40 %, the expected value for this particular signal (Brierley et al., 1992; Napthine et al., 1999) . Indeed, both products were observed in the translation reactions that contained mRNA, except for the translation reaction without tRNA supplement (lane 5). Thus all puri\u00aeed tRNAs were able to restore translation and frameshift activity. The relative abundance of non-frameshifted and frameshifted products on the gels was estimated by scanning densitometry and adjusted to take into account the differential methionine content of the 19 kDa and 28 kDa products (11 and 12, respectively). Although the overall frameshift ef\u00aeciency seen in translations with depleted RRL was slightly reduced (to 30-35 %), the type of tRNA employed as a supplement, whether Q-modi\u00aeed or Q-de\u00aecient, did not appear to in\u00afuence the degree of frameshifting. Hence the in vitro translations paralleled the in vivo studies and reinforce the conclusion that the Q-modi\u00aecation of tRNA Asn is not required for \u00c01 ribosomal frameshifting at the IBV signal.",

            "text": "The potential in\u00afuence of tRNA anticodon nucleoside modi\u00aecations on the process of \u00c01 ribosomal frameshifting was \u00aerst considered by Hat\u00aeeld and colleagues (Hat\u00aeeld et al., 1989) . These authors reasoned that as most slippery sequence-decoding tRNAs have a hypermodi\u00aeed nucleoside in the anticodon, hypomodi\u00aecation would result in a tRNA with a less bulky anticodon and be more free to move around during decoding thus increasing frameshifting. An alternative hypothesis proposed a different role for the hypermodi\u00aeed base (Tsuchihashi, 1991; Tsuchihashi & Brown, 1992) . In this scenario, the modi\u00aecation in\u00afuences frameshifting by modulating the strength of the codon-anticodon interaction. From studies of ribosomal frameshifting in E. coli, the latter hypothesis seems the likelier. Firstly, it has been shown that hypomodi\u00aecation per se, does not necessarily lead to a stimulation of frameshifting. In E. coli, the IBV signal, or a variant with slippery sequence UUUAAAU, functions inef\u00aeciently (1-2 %), whether tRNA Asn possesses the anticodon QUU or GUU (Brierley et al., 1997) . Secondly, there is evidence to support a role for the strength of the codon-anticodon interaction in frameshifting. Tsuchihashi & Brown (1992) were able to diminish frameshifting at the dnaX signal (slippery sequence AAAAAAG) by co-expressing a variant tRNA Lys in which the anticodon had been changed from UUmnm 5 s 2 U to UUC. Expression of this tRNA, an isoacceptor not present naturally in E. coli cells, was considered to have reduced frameshift-ing by recognising more strongly the AAG codon. It was subsequently shown that the natural anticodon of E. coli tRNA Lys has an unusual conformation; it can probably form only a weak wobble pair with the anticodon, perhaps accounting for the high frameshift ef\u00aeciency in E. coli at slippery sequences ending in AAG (Watanabe et al., 1993; Agris, 1996; Agris et al., 1997) .",

(a) Transfer-RNA-depleted RRL (depleted; 30 ml), which had been left unsupplemented (\u00c0) or had been supplemented with HS tRNA to 50 mg/ml () was analysed for nucleic acid content following extraction with phenol/chloroform and precipitation in ethanol. Aliquots (5 ml) of the \u00aenal nucleic acid preparation (which was dissolved in 10 ml of water) were analysed on a 3 % agarose gel and visualised by staining with ethidium bromide. Also analysed were 5 ml of the nucleic acid preparation from undepleted, RRL (0), 0.75 mg of puri\u00aeed HS tRNA (HS) and 0.75 mg of commercial calf liver tRNA (liver). Molecular mass DNA markers (M; Life Technologies) were included. (b) In vitro translation of pFScass 6/BamHI mRNA (Brierley et al., 1992) in normal RRL (complete), normal RRL diluted to 70 % with water (diluted) or RRL depleted of endogenous tRNAs (depleted). The depleted RRL was either unsupplemented (\u00c0) or supplemented with tRNAs (at 50 mg/ ml) derived from either BHK cells (BHK), FCS-grown cos cells (FCS), FCS-grown cos cells supplemented with endogenous q (FCS q), HSgrown cos cells (HS), HS-grown cos cells supplemented with endogenous q (HS q), yeast cells (yeast) or calf liver cells (liver). Tracks labelled H 2 O represent water-programmed translations. The pFScass 6/BamHI template directs the synthesis of a 19 kDa non-frameshift (non-FS) and 28 kDa frameshift product (FS) (Brierley et al., 1992) . Products were labelled with [ 35 S]methionine, separated on an SDS/15 % polyacrylamide gel and detected by autoradiography. The frameshift ef\u00aeciencies quoted above the relevant lanes are the average of two independent measurements and the range is shown in parentheses. that this tRNA has a very unusual anticodon structure, it may be the case that frameshifting in prokaryotic systems is distinct from that in eukaryotes and that tRNA Lys is a special case. In this study, we have performed a detailed examination of the in\u00afuence of the hypermodi\u00aeed base Q on ribosomal frameshifting in eukaryotes, using both in vivo and in vitro systems. During all experiments, the predicted modi\u00aecation status of puri\u00aeed cellular tRNAs with respect to queuosine was con\u00aermed with an enzymatic guanine exchange assay and combined HPLC-mass spectrometry. Frameshifting was measured in cos cells that had been passaged in growth medium containing either FCS or HS, and in cos cells grown in FCS or HS supplemented with free queuine base. Addition of free queuine converts hypomodi\u00aeed tRNA (in HS) back to the hypermodi\u00aeed state (in FCS). The puri\u00aeed cellular tRNAs of de\u00aened modi\u00aecation status were also used in a tRNA-dependent in vitro translation system to study the effect of tRNA Asn hypomodi\u00aecation on in vitro frameshifting at the IBV signal. The ef\u00aeciency of the IBV frameshift signal was not in\u00afuenced by the nature of the tRNA population present in either system. The simplest interpretation of these observations is that both hypo-and hypermodi\u00aeed tRNA Asn can support ef\u00aecient ribosomal frameshifting. However, as we cannot rule out the possibility that the tRNAs puri\u00aeed from FCS-grown cos cells (or FCS-grown cos cells supplemented with q) still retain low levels of hypo-modi\u00aeed tRNAs, it is not possible to conclude categorically that frameshifting can be mediated by hypermodi\u00aeed tRNAs alone. However, it is clear that hypomodi\u00aeed tRNAs are fully functional.",

The three-dimensional structure of queuosine 5 H -monophosphate, determined by X-ray crystallography, and incorporated into tRNA Tyr on the basis of the coordinates of yeast tRNA Phe , suggests that Q in the anticodon loop does not interfere with codon-anticodon interactions (Yokoyama et al., 1979) . The bulky 7-substituent cyclopentenediol group of Q is fully extended outwards away from the anticodon, and the bond length and bond angles of the pyrimidine moiety of the 7-deazaguanine ring are almost equal to those of the unmodi\u00aeed guanosine base. Thus the conformational characteristics imply very similar decoding properties of Q and G-containing tRNA Asn , consistent with our observation that frameshifting ef\u00aeciencies are similar with Q or Gcontaining tRNA Asn . However, measurements of the relative stability of anticodon-anticodon complexes suggest a slight reduction in stability when a G-C pair is replaced by Q-C pair at the wobble position in the same anticodon sequence; the G-Ccontaining complex was stable for 840 ms compared with 620 ms for Q-C (Grosjean et al., 1978) . So we might have expected a decrease in frame-shift ef\u00aeciency in Q-free cells if the stability hypothesis is correct.",

            "text": "Our observation that supplementation of the tRNA-dependent RRL with Q-free tRNAs (HSderived tRNAs or yeast tRNAs) did not stimulate frameshifting at the IBV site is inconsistent with recent work by Carlson et al. (1999) , who studied frameshifting using in vitro translation reactions supplemented with hypomodi\u00aeed variants of tRNA Asn or tRNA Phe . In these experiments, slippery sequence variants of the mouse mammary tumour virus gag/pol frameshift signal were translated in RRL in the presence or absence of the exogenous hypomodi\u00aeed tRNAs. It was found that frameshifting at AAAUUUU was stimulated by addition of Y \u00c0 tRNA Phe (puri-\u00aeed from rabbit reticulocytes) and at AAAAAAC or AAAAAAU by addition of Q \u00c0 tRNA Asn (puri-\u00aeed from yeast strain 3950-1B H 2). Currently, it is not known why these data contradict those of the present study. In the analysis by Carlson et al. (1999) , standard, non-depleted RRL was employed. Although it is possible that the tRNA-depleted lysate employed in our study is also depleted of an additional component(s) that is required to mediate the stimulation afforded by hypomodi\u00aeed, but not hypermodi\u00aeed tRNAs, this seems unlikely. Although the frameshift ef\u00aeciencies measured in the tRNA-depleted RRL are slightly reduced from those measured in standard RRL (38 to about 32 %), this is probably a consequence of a reduced processivity of translation in the re-supplemented reactions. This leads to an underestimation of the amount of frameshift product and, consequently, an apparent reduction in frameshifting. A more likely explanation is that the in\u00afuence of hypomodi\u00aeed tRNAs is seen only at certain slippery sequences; i.e. at certain P and A-site tRNA combinations. Alternatively, the IBV site may represent a\u01f9`u pper limit'' of frameshift ef\u00aeciency that cannot be stimulated further by hypomodi\u00aeed tRNAs. We are currently testing these possibilities. Whatever the case, Q is not required for frameshifting at the IBV site in vivo.",

Indeed, the pseudoknot was about six times more effective at promoting frameshifting than a related hairpinloop. However, the level of frameshifting observed was reduced some four to \u00aevefold in comparison to in vitro translation systems (RRL; wheat-germ extract, data not shown) and the reason for this is not known. In RRL, the translation process is physiologically detached from other post-transcriptional events such as splicing, polyadenylation and nuclear export of mRNA, all of which might in\u00afuence the kind of proteins associated with the mRNA, and hence potentially frameshifting. Alternatively, differences with respect to the ribosome load on mRNAs between the two systems cannot be ruled out. The molecular basis for this difference may be informative in terms of the mechanism of the frameshift process.",
