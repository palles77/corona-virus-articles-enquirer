A promising approach for vaccine development is to generate, through codon pair deoptimization, an attenuated virus. This approach carries the advantage that it only requires limited knowledge specific to the virus in question, other than its genome sequence. Therefore, it is well suited for emerging viruses for which we may not have extensive data. We performed comprehensive in silico analyses of several features of SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequence (e.g., codon usage, codon pair usage, dinucleotide/junction dinucleotide usage, RNA structure around the frameshift region) in comparison with other members of the coronaviridae family of viruses, the overall human genome, and the transcriptome of specific human tissues such as lung, which are primarily targeted by the virus. Our analysis identified the spike (S) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins as promising targets for deoptimization and suggests a roadmap for SARS-CoV-2 vaccine development, which can be generalizable to other viruses.",

To date, there have been 693,224 confirmed cases and 33,106 deaths from COVID-19 worldwide, with 136 countries implementing additional health measures [1] . Given the urgency to combat this emerging disease, multiple efforts to develop an effective vaccine are underway. A relatively recent approach for vaccine development, first proposed by Coleman et al. in 2008 for the attenuation of poliovirus [2] , has been used for the attenuation of dozens of viruses, and more recently for bacteria [3] . This approach accomplishes viral attenuation through codon pair deoptimization and appears to be promising for vaccine development, particularly against emerging viruses, as it does not require extensive virusspecific knowledge. It does, however, require knowledge of the viral genome sequence and extensive characterization of its codon and codon pair usage characteristics.",

            "text": "Codon usage is biased across all domains of life, i.e., synonymous codons occur at different frequencies in different organisms [4, 5] . It is thought that preferred codons correspond to more abundant tRNAs, and therefore, are translated more efficiently [6] . Similarly, there is bias in codon pair usage, with certain codon pairs occurring at a much different frequency than would be expected based on the codon usage [5] . Codon pair usage also appears to affect translation efficiency [6] , although the mechanism is not entirely clear, and it has been argued that dinucleotide usage may be the driving force in determining viral sequence fitness, while codon pair bias may be a secondary effect of altered dinucleotide frequency [7] . Considering that viruses are obligate intracellular parasites and rely on the host-cell machinery for proper expression of their genes, it is worth noting that their codon usage often does not closely resemble the codon usage of their hosts [8, 9] , a phenomenon that is not well understood. In this regard, a thorough characterization of codon, codon pair and dinucleotide usage of SARS-CoV-2 can provide useful information regarding expression potential of the viral genes and the fitness of the virus in its human or other hosts. Furthermore, it has been shown that viral attenuation can be achieved through extensive changes in codon pair usage of viral genes [2] . Since the mechanism of viral attenuation through codon pair deoptimization is not entirely clear, this in-depth analysis is necessary to guide the development of new vaccines.",

Translation of a positive-stranded RNA from the initial infectious virus particles generates (among other proteins) a virally encoded RNA dependent RNA polymerase (replicase). This replicase is necessary for viral replication and subsequent generation of . CC-BY 4.0 International license author/funder.

ORF1ab, which encodes the replicase polyprotein (among other proteins) occupies about two thirds of the 5' prime end of this genome [10, 11] . A -1 programmed ribosomal frameshift (PRF) occurs half-way through ORF1ab, allowing the translation of ORF1b [10] . The efficiency of the frameshift thus modulates the relative ratios of proteins encoded by ORF1b and the upstream ORF1a and is critical for coronavirus propagation. Frameshift efficiency (ranging from 15 to 60%) in -1 PRFs is commonly regulated by pseudoknotted mRNA structures following the frameshift, and the conservation of a threestem pseudoknot in coronaviruses has been previously characterized [12] . Following ORF1ab, are the spike (S), ORF3a, envelope (E), membrane (M), ORF6, ORF7a, ORF7b, ORF8, nucleocapsid (N) and ORF10 genes. S, E, M and N are the structural proteins of the virus [11] . S promotes attachment and fusion to the host cell, during infection [13] . In the case of SARS-CoV-2, S binds to the human angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 (ACE2) [11, 14, 15] . The E protein is an ion channel and regulates virion assembly [16] . The M protein also participates in virus assembly and in the biosynthesis of new virus particles [17] , while the N protein forms the ribonucleoprotein complex with the virus RNA [18] and has several functions, such as enhancing transcription of the viral genome and interacting with the viral membrane protein during virion assembly [19] . Many of the other ORFs have unknown functions or are not well characterized [20] , as their presence is not consistent across all coronaviruses.",

We have taken advantage of our recently published databases, which include genomic codon usage statistics for all species with available sequence data, and transcriptomic codon usage statistics from several human tissues [4, 5, 24] . We further analyzed each viral gene in terms of its codon characteristics and used an array of codon usage metrics that informed us of the potential of each gene sequence to contribute to the deoptimization of the virus. In the case of ORF1ab, we further examined the structure of the mRNA in the region following the frameshift, finding the SARS-CoV-2 mRNA to exhibit a similar pseudoknotted structure to known coronaviruses. We identified two viral genes that represent valuable targets for deoptimization to generate an attenuated virus. Our analysis can be used as a pipeline to guide codon pair deoptimization for viral attenuation and vaccine development or a posteriori to evaluate the effectiveness of an attenuated viral sequence.",

The average percent difference in codon usage was 0.029%, or ~3 codons / 10,000, clearly showing that variation in sequences is not significantly affecting overall codon usage.

Codon pair data inherently contain the codon usage data and therefore are better suited than codon usage data for this type of comparison. As expected, SARS-CoV-2 codon pair usage closely resembles the codon usage of the coronoviridae family, while it is quite distinct from the codon pair usage of the human genome (Table 1) . Bat (Chiroptera) and pangolin (Pholidota) from which the virus may have been transmitted to humans, as well as dog (Canis lupus familiaris) to which the virus is feared may be transmitted next, were included in the analysis. We find that these species have a similar codon usage when compared with human; therefore, viral tropism cannot be inferred based on codon usage data alone (Table 1) . Since SARS-CoV-2 infects bronchial epithelial cells and type II pneumocytes and our recent findings show that transcriptomic tissue-specific codon pair usage can vary greatly from genomic codon pair usage [24] , we also examined the transcriptomic codon pair usage of the lung and how it compares with the SARS-CoV-2 codon pair usage. Rather surprisingly, the codon usage in the lung was more distinct from SARS-CoV-2 codon usage than the Homo sapiens genomic codon usage. The transcriptome codon pair usage of kidney and small intestine, tissues that are also susceptible to the infection, are similarly distant from SARS-CoV-2 (Table 1) .",

In our analyses, RSCU and CPS are derived from human genomic codon and codon pair usage frequencies. For ease of comparison, we used ln(RSCU) to measure the codon usage bias. The average CPS across a gene is referred to as codon pair bias (CPB) of the gene [2] . The average ln(RSCU) and CPB of each viral gene was calculated and compared with host genes average ln(RSCU) and CPB ( Figure 5 ). The average RSCU, ln(RSCU) and CPB of each viral gene appear in Table 2 . ORF10 was strikingly the least similar gene to the human genome in terms of both its codon and codon pair usage, followed by the E gene. These genes provide little opportunity for deoptimization, since their sequence is already far from optimal. On the other hand, genes S and N are more similar to human in terms of their codon pair usage.

            "text": "Currently most published attempts of viral attenuation through codon pair deoptimization do not discuss the strategy for selecting which genes to deoptimize. Although codon pair deoptimization has been proven successful for viral attenuation [2, 32, 33] , the mechanism is not clear. In addition, it is reasonable to assume that for every successful published deoptimization attempt, there may be several unsuccessful and therefore unpublished ones. Similarly, there have been successful attempts to generate attenuated viruses through codon deoptimization [34] [35] [36] [37] . Understanding the mechanism that leads to viral attenuation requires a thorough characterization of the viral sequence and of the consequences of sequence changes. There are several factors that may contribute to the efficacy of deoptimization strategies. In changing the codon pair usage, the dinucleotide frequency and the GC content are altered; mRNA secondary structure and translational kinetics are also perturbed. Further, the CpG content is changing, leading potentially to altered immunogenicity. It is likely that codon pair (or codon) deoptimization leads to reduced expression, either due to changes in transcription, mRNA stability, or translation efficiency [38] . Alternatively, it is possible that deoptimization may lead to perturbed cotranslational folding [39] , resulting in altered protein conformation. In the case of the S protein, this may lead to decreased binding affinity for the ACE2 protein, thus affecting viral fitness.",
