            "text": "Although defined more broadly, exposure science has mainly focused on exposures to environmental chemicals and related stressors, such as airborne particulate matter. There is an opportunity for exposure science to contribute more substantially to improving public health by devoting more attention to microorganisms as key stressors and agents in exposure. The discovery that pathogenic microbes cause disease in humans precipitated a revolution in public health science and disease prevention. With a continued global urgency to address spread of pathogenic microbes, contributions of microorganisms to both infectious and noninfectious processes merit more attention from the exposure science community. Today, discoveries of the importance of the human microbiome as a determinant of health and disease are precipitating a second revolution. Emerging knowledge creates a major opportunity to expand the scope of exposure science to incorporate the human microbiome as a target and modulator of exposure. A study committee of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine has defined a research strategy to address health risks that pertain to the interaction of environmental chemicals with the human microbiome. Some aspects of this strategy pose important challenges and opportunities for the exposure science community.",

The consequent development and application of that understanding has contributed mightily to improvements in public health. Historical examples highlight the scale of importance. The black death (plague), caused by Yersinia pestis and peaking during the middle of the 14 th century, was responsible for the deaths roughly 100 million people in Eurasia. Stenseth et al. [1] conclude that for today and future conditions, \"plague should be taken much more seriously by the international community than appears to be the case.\" The 1918 flu pandemic, involving the H1N1 influenza virus, infected 500 million people worldwide and resulted in deaths of about 50 million [2] . In each of these cases, the mortality totals are similar in scale to those associated with the world wars of the 20 th century. In reviewing the history of tuberculosis, \"an ancient scourge,\" Daniel [3] suggests that \"Mycobacterium tuberculosis may have killed more persons than any other microbial pathogen.\"",

            "text": "In the struggle to understand and effectively respond to diseases caused by microorganisms, many important scientific and technological contributions can be noted. An example is John Snow's demonstration of a role for drinking water contamination in the 1854 cholera outbreak in London [4] . Investigations of microbial agents as causes of infectious disease, such as tuberculosis, were central in the formulation of the Henle-Koch postulates, the \"classical point of reference in relating causative agents to disease.\" [5] Robert Koch was awarded the Nobel Prize in Medicine or Physiology in 1905 \"for his investigations and discoveries in relation to tuberculosis\" (https://www. nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1905/). In efforts to battle cholera outbreaks, Max von Pettenkofer, the \"founder of modern hygienic science,\" made important contributions to public health, including \"promotion of sanitary reforms, adequate pressurized water supply, and a sufficient sewage network.\" [6] The scientific achievements of the 19 th century in understanding the roles of microbes as the causes of infectious diseases were followed by major technological developments throughout the 20 th century to prevent and treat infectious disease. A prime example is the use of chemical disinfection for municipal drinking water, building on seminal investigations of disinfection kinetics [7] and chemistry [8] . In 2007, readers of the British Medical Journal voted \"sanitation (clean water and sewage disposal)\" as the \"most important medical milestone since 1840.\" [9] Other major achievements improving public health in response to the challenge posed by infectious microorganisms include the widespread use of antibiotics [10] and the development of vaccines based on immunology [11] . More mundane, yet still important, are handwashing and other hygienic practices in health-care settings [12, 13] .",

Considering farm animals as well as humans, Fuller [32] provides a scientific review of probiotics and offers this definition: \"A live microbial feed supplement which beneficially affects the host animal by improving its intestinal microbial balance.\" Fuller concludes that, \"there is good evidence that the complex microbial flora present in the gastrointestinal tract of all warm-blooded animals is effective in providing resistance to disease.\" Precipitated in part by the advent of molecular approaches for measuring microbes, including quantitative PCR and next-generation sequencing, we are now seeing an explosion of scientific attention focusing on the microorganisms associated with the human body. The earliest article in Web of Science with \"human microbiome\" in the title was published in 2007. Ley et al. [33] wrote then that, with advances in metagenomics, \"we start to see ourselves as supra-organisms whose genome evolved with associated microbial genomes.\" In less than a half century, we are seeing a complete reversal from Luckey's \"microbes are dispensable\" [31] perspective to a view in which we study ourselves \"as an integral and dependent part of our microbedominated world.\" [33] Let's take a closer look at the human microbiome. First, how many human cells and how much bacterial matter are associated with humans? Sender et al. [34] have estimated that the number of bacterial cells (38 trillion) is comparable to the number of human cells (30 trillion). However, the number of nucleated human cells is estimated to be only 10% of the total, i.e. 3 trillion, indicating that-by countthe human is clearly outnumbered by associated bacteria. Furthermore, Ley et al. [33] observe that the humanassociated microbial genes exceed our human genes by a factor of 100.",

These features lead one to question whether some of the physiologic response to inhalation exposure for formaldehyde might be modulated by microbiota in the upper respiratory tract. \"What is particularly germane is whether exposures to formaldehyde at concentrations encountered (or potentially encountered) in the environment interact with the microbiota in the upper airways in a manner that materially influences associated health risks, considering both irritancy responses associated with acute exposures and cancer risk associated with cumulative exposures.\" [35] Phthalates are a class of compounds widely used in consumer products. Among the health concerns associated with phthalate exposures are insulin resistance [77] , metabolic syndrome [78] and reproductive and developmental toxicity [79] . Exposures can occur via multiple pathways, including ingestion, inhalation, and dermal absorption [80, 81] . A recent study demonstrated that transdermal uptake from air could make a meaningful contribution to exposure to diethyl phthalate and di(n-butyl) phthalate [82] . There are clues that microbes might influence exposure to phthalates. For example, it has been demonstrated that the skin is more permeable to the metabolite mono (2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (MEHP) than to the parent compound di (2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) [83] . Nakamiya et al. [84] have shown that microbes extracted from house materials can convert DEHP to MEHP. It is an open question whether skin microbiota carry out a similar conversion process.",

            "text": "Triclosan presents a challenging case for exposure science. Its widespread incorporation into household and personal care products such as soaps and toothpastes have contributed to a high level of exposure intimacy [85] . Concerns have been raised about triclosan as a possible endocrine disrupting compound [86] and as a contributor to antibacterial resistance in environmental media, such as indoor dust [87] . As a broad spectrum antibacterial agent, there is also a basis for health-risk concerns in which microbiota in the human microbiome are an exposure target. Scientific understanding of health risks associated with triclosan as an environmental chemical is still developing. In a recent review, Goodman et al. [88] concluded that \"the current body of epidemiologic literature does not allow a meaningful weight of evidence assessment due to the methodological limitations of individual studies and lack of inter-study consistency.\" Evidence for concern is accumulating, however. Ribado et al. [89] conducted a randomized intervention study of triclosan and triclocarban (TC) in personal care products in households with new babies. They found that \"antibiotic resistant species from the phylum Proteobacteria \u2026 were enriched in stool samples from mothers in TC households after the introduction of triclosan-containing toothpaste.\" They reported thatindependent of treatment -\"infants with higher triclosan levels also showed an enrichment of Proteobacteria species.\" Bever et al. [90] studied triclosan in breast milk in relation to personal care product use by mothers. They reported that \"bacterial diversity in the fecal microbiome of the infants exposed to breast milk with detectable triclosan levels differed compared to their peers exposed to milk containing non-detectable amounts.\" Using a mouse model, Yang et al. [91] found that brief exposure, \"at relatively low doses, causes low-grade colonic inflammation, increases colitis, and exacerbates colitis-associated colon cancer in mice.\" They attribute adverse effects of triclosan, in part, to \"modulation of the gut microbiota.\" \"Given widespread human exposure, research to investigate the effects of triclosan on the human microbiome and to answer such questions as whether early-life exposure to triclosan is predisposing infants to adverse health outcomes seems warranted.\" [35] Way forward for exposure science Exposure science is an important domain and a young discipline. Evidence of importance include the existence of this journal, an associated international society (the International Society of Exposure Science, ISES), and consensus reports of the National Academies focused on the discipline [22] . Evidence of youth include the relatively recent dates of founding of this journal (1991) and of ISES (1989). With young disciplines, efforts toward systematization are necessary, as illustrated by the effort to define an exposure science ontology [92] . Paradigm shifting discoveries and discernment should also be anticipated, as in the case of the exposome [93, 94] .",

Consequently, one might view the almost exclusive focus of exposure science on environmental chemicals as a rational approach. However, in the succeeding decades, accounting for progress made and recognizing the relative importance of the topics for public health, it seems worthwhile to adjust the balance, explicitly expanding the areas of concern in exposure science to include exposure aspects pertaining to infectious and noninfectious microbes as agents and as biologic stressors.",

In the early 1970s, Luckey's view may have prevailed: although microbes were common and prevalent on and in humans, they were nonessential. By the late 1980s, an understanding of our dependence on microbiota as factors influencing our health had begun to take root. In the past few decades, we have seen a strong shift: human-associated microbes are no longer thought of being apart from us, but rather are increasingly recognized as an integral part of us, the human microbiome. The ramifications of this radical shift in perspective have not yet been absorbed in the exposure sciences.",
