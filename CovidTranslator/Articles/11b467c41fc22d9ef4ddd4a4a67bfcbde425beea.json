Methods: The complete 2016 literature concerning public health and epidemiology informatics has been searched in PubMed and Web of Science, and the returned references were reviewed by the two section editors to select 14 candidate best papers. These papers were then peer-reviewed by external reviewers to allow the editorial team an enlightened selection of the best papers. Results: Among the 829 references retrieved from PubMed and Web of Science, three were finally selected as best papers. The first one compares Google, Twitter, and Wikipedia as tools for Influenza surveillance. The second paper presents a Geographic Knowledge-Based Model for mapping suitable areas for Rift Valley fever transmission in Eastern Africa. The last paper evaluates the factors associated with the visit of Facebook pages devoted to Public Health Communication. Conclusions: Surveillance is still a productive topic in public health informatics but other very important topics in public health are appearing.",

            "text": "Public Health Informatics is the systematic application of information and computer sciences to public health practice, research, and learning, as it has been quoted in the Medical Subject Heading information since 2013. A new section on this specific topic has been integrated in the IMIA Yearbook in 2015. An overview of the area covered by Public Health Informatics is presented in the Dixon et al. paper [1] . In 2016, the term Precision Public Health started to appear in several publications [2, 3] . In parallel to precision medicine, it is concerned with providing the right intervention to the right population at the right time [2] . The idea is to take advantage of the development of technologies including health information technology to improve the assessment of population health and prevention interventions and policies. Surveillance of epidemics and community health issues are obvious examples that are pinpointed in publications [2, 3] . New technologies and big data should help accelerate the detection of epidemics in a timely and accurate manner by accessing laboratory, satellite, and phone data, tracking population movements, and integrating all data for making more precise estimations. Modelling the risk of epidemics in well-defined areas could help in targeting interventions for preventing epidemics. Hence, although public health informatics covers a large spectrum of applications, the surveillance of epidemics using recently available web-based and other tools, that could be referred to as precision epidemiology or digital epidemiology, constitutes a recurrent topic in the literature. In addition, numerous papers have been published and present methods to optimize and analyze internet data for various infec-tious agents, as it is done with Google flu 1 . This \"classical epidemiology of infectious disease\" using new digital tools should eventually be useful for public agencies and for the surveillance of other diseases. But public health informatics is covering many other areas of research including communication. Using newly available tools and especially web-based ones should be of benefit to the public health informatics community.",

Several compared the sources of information among Google, Twitter, and Wikipedia [5-9] for various infectious diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in Korea, bubonic plague outbreak in Madagascar, chicken pox caused by varicella zoster virus (VZV), and Influenza in United States. Of note, one work presented an open-source system gathering tweets on symptoms associated with influenza-like illness (ILI) [8] , and another used Twitter for avian influenza risk surveillance [9] . The work performed by Sharpe et al., is very well done and particularly interesting because it adds an unconventional source of information: the accesses to Wikipedia pages on Influenza [5] . In addition to the objective of detecting outbreaks as early as possible, the same approaches could be applied to look at the impact of vaccination programs [10] . Besides web-based data, information extracted from cloud-based electronic health record (EHR) databases can also be used for real-time surveillance of influenza-like illnesses [11] . In the past, it was not possible to use medical records for tracking epidemics because of the time lag due to the availability of data. Today, the easy access to EHRs makes their use for real time surveillance possible.",

Jaulent , and Ethiopia (where the disease has never been reported but which shares borders with infected countries), and to assess the predictive accuracy of the model using livestock outbreak data from Kenya and Tanzania. Risk factors and their relative importance regarding RVF amplification and spread were identified from a literature review. The data were imported into a geographic information system (GIS) and processed to produce standardized spatial risk factor layers, namely a mosquito index (suitability for RVF mosquito vectors), sheep density, goat density, cattle density, proximity to markets, road density, railways density, proximity to water bodies, proximity to wildlife national parks. A numerical weight was calculated for each risk factor using an analytical hierarchy process. The corresponding geographic data were collected, standardized, and combined based on a weighted linear combination to produce maps of the suitability for RVF transmission. The accuracy of the resulting maps was assessed using RVF outbreak locations in livestock reported in Kenya and Tanzania between 1998 and 2012 and the ROC curve analysis. Results confirmed the capacity of the geographic information system-based multi-criteria evaluation method to synthesize available scientific knowledge and to accurately map (AUC = 0.786; 95% CI [0.730-0.842]) the spatial heterogeneity of RVF suitability in East Africa. Some areas may be at-risk without having experienced outbreaks in past years. The identification of these areas is essential for implementing risk-based surveillance and reducing the impact of RVF human and animal outbreaks in the coming years (until 2016, Uganda and Ethiopia remained free from outbreaks, but these two countries are highly vulnerable to the disease). This approach provides users with a straightforward update of the maps according to data availability and contributes to the further development of scientific knowledge.",

The RVF virus (RVFV) is transmitted from ruminant to ruminant by mosquitoes. Different climatic, environmental, and socio-economic factors may impact the transmission of the virus. The objective of the present study was to develop a geographic knowledge-based method to map the areas suitable for RVF amplification and RVF spread in four East African countries, namely, Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, (three countries which have been historically affected by RVF)",
