The study was supported by the team of physicians, researchers and nursing 27 staff at NCID and in particular we will like to acknowledge the support from research Of the 17 patients recruited, none presented with ocular symptoms. However, 1 patient 81 developed conjunctival injection and chemosis during the stay in the hospital (Table 1 82 available at www.aaojournal.org). 14 patients presented with upper respiratory tract 83 symptoms including cough, rhinorrhea and sore throat. 84 6 A total of 64 samples were taken over the study period, with 12, 28 and 24 samples taken 85 from first, second and third week of initial symptoms respectively. All were tested negative 86 for the SARS-CoV-2 on viral isolation and RT-PCR. Tear results were compared with NP 87 results as shown in Figure 1 . Ct values of NP swabs were featured. 88 To our knowledge, this is the first study comparing viral shedding in tears with NP results 89 during the course of COVID-19 infection. A previous study showed positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-90 PCR results from a patient's tears, but isolation of the virus was unsuccessful 5 . In this study, 91 there was no evidence of SARS-CoV-2 shedding in tears through the course of the disease. 92 Viral load detected in nasal and throat swabs are elevated for a period of approximately 2 93 weeks from the onset of COVID-19 symptoms 6 .

While it is known to be transmitted via droplets,41    alternative modes of transmission remain unknown. Transmission through infected ocular 42 tissue or fluid has been a controversy 1,2 . It is hypothesized that the nasolacrimal system can 43 act as a conduit for viruses to travel from the upper respiratory tract to the eye. Hence, 44 ocular tissue and fluid may represent a potential source of SARS-CoV-2. In this study, we45 attempted to determine the possibility of transmission through tears by assessing for the 46 presence of SARS-CoV-2 with viral isolation and quantitative reverse transcription 47 polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). As patients were being monitored clinically via routine 48 nasopharyngeal swabs (NP), they were compared with tears to further understand patterns 49 of viral shedding. 50 17 COVID-19 patients were recruited for this prospective study in Singapore after obtaining 51 informed consent. This study was carried out in accord with the Declaration of Helsinki and 52 ethics approved by the Domain Specific Review Board of the National Healthcare Group 53 (NHG) Singapore. NPs were collected routinely for clinical monitoring of patient's condition 54 while tear samples were collected purely for research purposes. On some days, both tears 55 and NPs were collected at the same time. These samples were delivered to different labs were tested positive by RT-PCR of NPs in a clinical diagnostic laboratory. 58 NPs were collected in universal viral transport media and RNA extraction done using 59 NucliSENS\u00ae easyMAG\u00ae system (bioM\u00e9rieux). 55\u00b5l of the elute was then used to perform RT-60 PCR as per manufacturer's instructions using the A*STAR FORTITUDE kit (sampled by a senior consultant ophthalmologist using Schirmer's test strip at 64 varying timepoints between Day 3 and 20 after the initial development of symptoms. 65 Caution was taken to prevent contamination of samples. The Schirmer's strip tear collection 66 method was previously validated in other studies 3 . Samples from both eyes were taken and 67 analysed separately. Collected strips were placed into individual falcon tubes of universal 68 viral transport media. Samples were delivered to a research laboratory for processing. 69 Samples were used to inoculate Vero-E6 cells (ATCC\u00aeCRL-1586TM). After 4 days of 70 incubation, cells were observed for the presence of cytopathic effect (CPE). Total RNA was 71 extracted from all samples using E.Z.N.A. Total RNA Kit I (Omega Bio-tek) according to the 72 manufacturer's instructions and samples were analysed by real-time quantitative reverse 73 transcription-PCR (RT-qPCR) for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 as previously described 4 . 74 Clinical data including age, sex, symptoms, nasopharyngeal swab results were collected 75 from electronic health records and correlated with RT-PCR results. Ocular symptoms which 76 were assessed include red eye, tearing, blurring of vision, discharge and colour desaturation. 77 These symptoms were chosen based on the ocular manifestations of other coronaviruses 78 known to infect humans and animals 2 . Other symptoms of COVID-19 assessed include fever, 79 cough, shortness of breath, rhinorrhea and sore throat.80",
