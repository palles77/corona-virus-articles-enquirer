Improved lifestyle and quality of children's health is likely to reduce the burden of adult diseases and enhance longevity because seeds of most adult diseases are sown in childhood. Identification and decoding of human genome is expected to revolutionize the practice of pediatrics. The day is not far off when a patient will walk into doctor's chamber with an electronic or digital health history on a CD or palmtop and a decoded genomic constitution. There will be reduced burden of genetic diseases because of selective abortions of Bdefective^fetuses and replacement of Bbad^genes with Bgood^ones by genetic engineering. Availability of totipotent stem cells and developments in transplant technology are likely to revolutionize the management of a variety of hematologic cancers and life-threatening genetic disorders. The possibility of producing flawless designer babies by advances in assisted reproductive technologies (ARTs) is likely to be mired by several ethical and legal issues.",

There is going to be a greater focus on the Bpatient^having the disease rather than Bdisease^per se by practicing holistic pediatrics by effective utilization of alternative or complementary strategies for health care. Due to advances in technology, pediatrics may get further dehumanized. A true healer cannot simply rely on technology; there must be a spiritual bond between the patient Introduction In order to improve human resource, children deserve high quality of healthcare at all social and ethnic levels without any discrimination [1] . The futuristic model of pediatrics is likely to be greatly modified by technology boom with further erosion of doctor-parent/patient relationship [2] . The day is not far off when a patient walks in the doctor's chamber with an electronic or digital health history on a CD or palmtop. He may be asked to walk through a screening device to decipher his genome and get baseline biochemical parameters. The child is likely to get a computer-based diagnosis with the help of apps-based algorithms and given a print out of the prescription.",

On the basis of genome, we can plan personalized strategies for prevention, diagnosis and treatment of diseases with patient-specific or tailor-made drugs.

The concept of functional foods is being increasingly exploited to prevent illness, promote health and improve quality of life.

            "text": "Our body is suffused with a cosmic life force energy field consisting of light, heat, sound, electric and magnetic waves emanating from various Bchakras^. The bio field, which is called aura, halo or corona, extends beyond the skin and forms a protective sheath. There are seven chakras, which are located along the spine adjacent to various endocrine glands. They are linked with the body Meridians, Nadis, Bhongan, and Duct system. It is believed that life energy or Prana flows into and out of our chakras. Starting from base of the spine to the top of the head, the chakras include Kundalini (coccyx), Hara (sacral), Solar plexus (navel), Heart (midback), Thyroid (base of throat), Brow (third eye), and Crown (sahasrara), which integrates all the chakras and is a source of astral energy (gold sun) or global consciousness or nonbeing. A healthy person, who has physical vitality, mental clarity, emotional, social and spiritual wellbeing, is likely to have bigger and brighter auras [39, 40] . Whenever, there is stress or dysfunction, whether physical, psychological, social or spiritual, the chakra energy field or halo is disturbed. Human chakras can be scanned by various Kirlian equipment like Polycontrast Interference Photography (PIP), Digital Aura Scanning System (DAS), Gas Discharge Visualization (GDV), Medical Thermal Imaging (MTI), Resonant Field Imaging (RFI), and Electro Interstitial Scanning (EIS). When a chakra is found to be diseased or dysfunctional, it can be energized or activated with electric current, magnetic waves, healing touch, Reiki and crystal healing.",

There will be a greater focus on public health interventions to improve social, community, and environmental factors to enhance survival and quality of life. Healthy lifestyle and improvements in the health status and quality of life in children is associated with reduced burden of adult diseases because seeds of most adult diseases are sown in childhood. Advances in clinical genetics are likely to revolutionize pediatrics. There will be no issue of survival of the fittest because everyone will survive. Individuals born with defective genes will be managed by insertion of healthy cloned genes by further refinements in genetic engineering technology. Molecular diagnostic tests are likely to be readily available with a possibility of having personalized or tailor-made medicines depending upon the genetic constitution of the patient. A number of newer vaccines for emerging infections are in the pipeline including realization of the revolutionary concept to produce vaccines for a large number of non-infective lifestyle diseases. The scientists are going to play Bgod^to produce designer babies but it is unlikely to become a reality because of tremendous ethical and legal issues.",

We shall be able to prolong life and ensure the quality of life worth living but we should not aim for immortality or resurrection of life. Nature is a huge recycling plant and no body should try to arrest the divine process of birth-life-death-rebirth\u2026 However, there is a fond hope that in the next millennium, people are likely to have an IQ of 150 and live to an average age of 120 y-but more importantly they are likely to have a good quality of life worth living.",
