Recombinant cyanovirin expressed in soybean seeds is shown to be biologically active in anti-HIV assays [4] . The cyanobacterial lectin microvirin, originally isolated from Microcystis aeruginosa PCC 7806, which shares 33% similarity with the cyanovirin, is unusual in that it potently inhibits HIV-1 with negligible toxicity compared to cyanovirin [3, 5] . A third cyanobacterial lectin with broad biotechnological potential given its biological activity is scytovirin, a lectin that was isolated from the cyanobacterium Scytonema varium [6] . Cyanobacterial lectin scytovirin has 95 amino acids with a molecular mass of approximately 9.7 kDa divided into two structural domains (SD), the first spanning amino acids 1-48 (SD1) and the second 49-95 (SD2). These are nearly Abstract Scytovirin is a lectin isolated from the cyanobacterium Scytonema varium that has shown activity against HIV, SARS coronavirus and Zaire Ebola virus. Its 95 amino acids are divided into two structural domains (SD), the first spanning amino acids 1-48 (SD1) and the second 49-95 (SD2). Interestingly, the domains are nearly identical but differ in their affinities for carbohydrates. With the aim of enhancing understanding of the binding properties of scytovirin, we performed molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of scytovirin complexed with Man4. We set up three systems: (i) Man4 bound to both domains (SD1 + SD2) using the full-length protein; (ii) Man4 bound to an incomplete protein, containing only SD1 and (iii) Man4 bound to an incomplete protein containing only SD2. Contrary to other reports, binding free energy results suggest that Man4 can bind simultaneously to SD1 and SD2 binding regions, but SD1 individually has the best values of energy and the best affinity for Man4. Decomposition of the binding free energy showed that the residues that interact with Man4 were different in the three systems, suggesting that the binding mechanism of Man4 varies between full-length protein, SD1 and SD2. The results presented here may help to formulate strategies to use scytovirin and identical, although they present different affinities and may bind independently to ligand carbohydrates [7] . Since scytovirin can bind to HIV glycoproteins gp160, gp120 and gp41 and to the Zaire Ebola virus mucin domain and shows antiviral activity against these viruses [8, 9] , it is currently being investigated as a potential antiviral microbicide candidate.",

However, it has been demonstrated that HIV can develop resistance to HIV by deglycosylation in site-specific residues, although multiple mutations are necessary to make this happen [12] .

AMBER 12 package was used to perform all steps of preparation and MD [16] . Carbohydrate parameters were obtained from the GLY-CAM06 [17] force field. For the protein and ions, FF99SB [18] and GAFF [19] force fields were used, respectively. Next, we set up three systems: (i) Man4 bound to both domains (SD1 + SD2) using the full-length protein; (ii) Man4 bound to an incomplete protein, containing only SD1, (iii) Man4 bound to an incomplete protein containing only SD2. The three systems were constructed, each one with a ligand (Man4), Cl \u2212 ions to neutralize the charges and the TIP3P water molecules in a cubic box with 12 \u00c5 in each direction of the protein. Sander software, which is included in AMBER 12, performed the energy minimization in five stages. The first four stages used 3000 cycles of steepest descent and 5000 cycles of conjugate gradients. In the remaining stage, 5000 cycles of steepest descent and 30,000 cycles of conjugate gradients were used. The heavy atoms had their movement restrained by a harmonic potential of 1000 Kcal/mol \u00c5 2 , while in the final step all atoms were free. For heating and equilibration, 14 steps were used. A harmonic potential of 25 Kcal/mol \u00c5 2 was employed to restrain the heavy atoms in the initial stages. In the step 13, the restraining force was set to 0. The temperature was gradually increased, until it reached 300 K. Langevin dynamics (thermostat) were employed with a collision frequency of 3.0 ps \u22121 . This method is significantly more efficient at equilibrating the system temperature than the Berendsen temperature coupling scheme that was recommended for older versions of AMBER [16] . The heating procedure lasted 650 ps until step 13 and was performed using an NVT ensemble. Afterwards, a 2 ns equilibration phase was employed in an NPT ensemble. The SHAKE algorithm was employed to restrict the vibration of the ligations of all hydrogen atoms. The Particle Mesh Ewald method was used for calculating electrostatic interactions using a cutoff value of 10.0 \u00c5. Thus, 210 ns MD was produced in an NVT ensemble, for each system. The cpptraj module was used to compute the root mean square deviation (RMSD) of both trajectories, considering the heavy atoms of the main chain. 5000 snapshots from the last 10 ns of the MD simulations were used to calculate the free energies using MM-GBSA, MM-PBSA and SIE methods [20] [21] [22] .",

Additionally, scytovirin presented several residues contributing along full-length protein (Fig. 3) , including the regions with aromatic residues like Trp8 and Phe47. We can observe that the most important residues of SD1 binding (Glu10, Ans18 and Arg30) are conserved in SD2 as Glu58, Ans66 and Arg78, but they do not contribute to interaction when SD2 is complexed individually with Man4 ( Fig. 3; Table 2 ).",

This occurs in such a way that in SD2, charged residues Asp57 and Lys 60, replace asparagine residues and create an electrostatic force capable of separating Man4 from the key residues Ans66 and Arg78, which are Ans18 and Arg30 in SD1, respectively (Fig. 3) . This event affects the formation of interactions in the same pattern as observed in SD1 and that affect the binding free energy of SD2. Finally, the use of lectins in the treatment and prevention of viral diseases is a very promising application [3, 5] , and it is thus important to know how theseproteins act to prevent microbial infection. In the case of scytovirin, the mechanism for binding to Man4 varies between full-length protein, SD1 and SD2. Overall, the results presented here may help to formulate strategies for using scytovirin as a potential antiviral drug as well for promoting mutagenesis studies that can improve the affinity of scytovirin for the ligand carbohydrates.
