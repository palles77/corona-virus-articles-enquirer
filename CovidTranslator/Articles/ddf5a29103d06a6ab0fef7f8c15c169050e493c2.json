Furthermore, hMPV is a major contributor to the burden of wintertime respiratory illness in older adults that is peak incidence at 65 years of age and immunocompromised individuals [2, 4, 5] . hMPV infections in children are usually mild and self-limiting, but in elderly and immunocompromised patients, the clinical course can progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [6] . Studies of patients with hMPV who develop severe illness have focused on children; few have involved adults [7, 8] . Nosocomial infection has been reported in several studies as a mode of transmission [5, [9] [10] [11] . Nosocomial hMPV infection of adults occurs predominantly in human immunodeficiency virus-infected persons [12] .",

However, frail elderly patients with an hMPV infection could progress to pneumonitis, ARDS, or death[8,12,18]. In this study, severe hMPV infection was associated with a risk of pneumonia, ARDS, and mortality in immunocompromised elderly patients. The findings of this study suggest that 20% of hospitalized adults with an hMPV infection will develop ARDS. The risk factor for hMPV-associated ARDS was congestive heart failure. It is known that viral infection is one of the risk factors for aggravation of congestive heart failure. When patients with congestive heart failure are infected by hMPV, they have risks both aggravation of congestive heart failure and ARDS[8].The patients with ARDS and congestive heart failure may also have had pulmonary edema; however, this could not be determined because of the limitations inherent to a retrospective study. The patients with ARDS among hMPVinfected adults showed lymphocytopenia, higher levels of BUN, creatinine, and CRP and lower levels of albumin compared to non-ARDS patients. In-hospital mortality of severe ARDS (OR, 9.48) was higher than ARDS (OR,5.24). The in-hospital mortality rate of the patients with hMPV infection was 10.9%. The in-hospital mortality rate of the ARDS group (36.4%) was significantly higher than that of the non-ARDS group (5.7%). The risk factors for hMPV-associated ARDS should be considered as congestive heart failure. These results suggest that hMPV is an important and previously underappreciated cause of ARDS in adult patients. Severe clinical manifestations such as ARDS should be considered when hMPV infection is diagnosed in adult patients with congestive heart failure.",

A total of 652 cases of hMPV infection were identified by mRT-PCR from nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal swabs among patients. We collected hospitalized adult patients over 18 years with positive hMPV mRT-PCR assay result among 652 patients. The 110 of hospitalized adult patients with hMPV infection were included in the primary analysis. Demographic, comorbidity, and hospitalization data of 110 adult patients were collected. The data included chronic respiratory disease, cardiac disease, immunocompromised state, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) requiring dialysis, cirrhosis, corticosteroid use, and immunosuppressive therapy. Viral co-infection was defined as identification by mRT-PCR from a nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal swab. Patients who had either a positive blood culture or a positive sputum culture from a satisfactory specimen were identified as having bacterial co-infection.",
