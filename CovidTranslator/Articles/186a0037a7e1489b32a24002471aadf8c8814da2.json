Herein, we show that SL1 is functionally and structurally bipartite. While the upper region of SL1 is required to be paired, we observe strong genetic selection against viruses that contain a deletion of A35, an extrahelical nucleotide that destabilizes SL1, in favor of genomes that contain a diverse panel of destabilizing second-site mutations, due to introduction of a noncanonical base pair near A35. Viruses containing destabilizing SL1-\u0394A35 mutations also contain one of two specific mutations in the 3\u2032 UTR. Thermal denaturation and imino proton solvent exchange experiments reveal that the lower half of SL1 is unstable and that second-site SL1-\u0394A35 substitutions are characterized by one or more features of the wild-type SL1. We propose a \"dynamic SL1\" model, in which the base of SL1 has an optimized lability required to mediate a physical interaction between the 5\u2032 UTR and the 3\u2032 UTR that stimulates subgenomic RNA synthesis. Although not conserved at the nucleotide sequence level, these general structural characteristics of SL1 appear to be conserved in other coronaviral genomes.",

            "text": "Like other CoVs, MHV has a large \u224832-kb positivesense viral RNA genome flanked by 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 untranslated regions (UTRs). The 5\u2032 two-thirds of the genome encodes the replicase complex (open reading frame 1), whose expression requires a \u2212 1 1a/1b translational frameshift, 5 with downstream open reading frames encoding a variety of structural and accessory proteins required for replication and assembly of infectious viruses. 1,6 MHV transcription generates a set of nested subgenomic mRNAs, which contain 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 regions that are identical with those of the genomic RNA (gRNA). [7] [8] [9] The most widely accepted model used to explain this unique discontinuous transcription mechanism posits that subgenomic negative-strand RNAs are synthesized from genome-sized template, and that the subgenomic mRNAs are synthesized from subgenomic minus strands. [10] [11] [12] Zuniga et al. have refined this model by providing strong support for the hypothesis that heptameric core intergenic sequences or \"body\" transcription regulatory sequences (TRS-Bs) signal template switching to the TRS 5\u2032 leader (TRS-L), as well as suggest the existence of RNA-RNA interactions between the 5\u2032 UTR and 3\u2032 UTRs and the proteins bound to these UTRs. 13 Many cis-acting sequences in the 5\u2032 UTR have been shown to play an important role in RNA transcription and replication; [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] however, insights into the secondary structure of the 5\u2032 UTR were, until recently, limited. We have developed a consensus secondary structure model based on the sequences of nine CoVs, in which the 5\u2032 leader RNA, consisting of the 5\u2032 most 72 nucleotides of the 5\u2032 UTR in MHV, is characterized by two conserved stem-loop structures, denoted SL1 and SL2. 19, 20 We have shown that SARS-CoVs SL1 and SL2 can replace their MHV counterparts in an otherwise MHV gRNA; these chimeric viruses are transcriptionally active and replication competent. 19 This experiment strongly supports the predicted secondary structural architecture of the 5\u2032 UTR in MHV. SL2 is a highly conserved pentaloop containing structural features consistent with a U-turn architecture that plays a critical role in subgenomic RNA (sgRNA) synthesis, as well as in translation. 20 In this report, we extensively characterize the functional and structural properties of SL1. We show that SL1 adopts a bipartite structure with the functional boundary of two consecutive pyrimidinepyrimidine (pyr-pyr) base pairs in the middle of the SL1 helix. 20 The upper region of the stem must be base paired to support viral replication to near-wildtype (WT) levels. In striking contrast, characterization of mutant viruses in which an unpaired nucleotide, A35, is deleted leads to the recovery of a diverse collection of mutant viruses that contain single-nucleotide second-site mutations in the lower half of SL1, all of which are kinetically and thermodynamically destabilizing. In addition, these viruses contain one of two single-nucleotide substitutions in the extreme 3\u2032 UTR of the genome. Nonviable mutants in this region of SL1, like SL2 mutants characterized previously, 20 fail to support sgRNA synthesis. These data, taken collectively, suggest that the base of SL1 must adopt an optimized stability or kinetic lability to mediate a long-range interaction between the 5\u2032 UTR and the 3\u2032 UTR that is an obligate step in the transcription of sgRNAs. The nature of this interaction is discussed.",

In addition, these NMR studies also suggested that either A35 or A36 is an unpaired extrahelical nucleotide and that the alternative pairing of U9 with A35 or A36 introduces a local destabilization in this region of SL1 stem. 20 Interestingly, the predicted SL1s in other coronaviral genomes also appear to conserve this general feature of a rather weakly paired region at the base or middle of SL1, containing either or both noncanonical base pairs and extrahelical nucleotides, suggesting that this might be important for the replication of MHV and perhaps other CoVs. This served as the motivation for the construction of a mutant MHV genome harboring a single-nucleotide deletion of A35 (SL1-\u0394A35) \u2021.",

            "text": "Since NMR data supported the existence of SL1 in 5\u2032-leader-containing RNA fragments, 20 we first investigated the functional importance of SL1 in viral replication. One set of mutations targeted the Fig. 1 . Predicted secondary structure model of MHV-A59 SL1 constructs discussed here. (a) WT; 20 (b) WT*, which corresponds to SL1-\u0394(C16/C19/C20) with a 5\u2032-GA overhang required for initiation of in vitro transcription by SP6 polymerase; and (c) second-site revertant SL1s derived from infection with the SL1-\u0394A35 virus (\u0394A35 RNA sequence shown; recovered single-nucleotide substitutions highlighted in red). The constructs labeled WT*, \u0394A35, \u0394A35/U33C, \u0394A35/C34U, and \u0394A35/A36U RNAs (b and c) were used for the NMR and thermal unfolding studies. The 5\u2032 g is a non-native nucleotide, shown in lower case. \u2021 Although A35 or A36 (or both, one at a time) could theoretically be extruded from the SL1 helix, extrusion of either one gives rise to the same structure of paired bases in the SL1 stem. In this work, we characterized SL1-\u0394A35 MHV mutants, but SL1-\u0394A36 viruses would give rise to exactly the same sequence in SL1 and thus would not be functionally distinguishable from the SL1-\u0394A35 virus. upper portion of SL1 above the pyr-pyr base pairs, while a second set targeted the lower region of SL1 (Table 1) . Plaque size phenotypes (Table 1 , Supplementary Fig. 1 ) and one-step growth curves (Fig. 2 , Supplementary Fig. 2) were measured for all viable viruses. Deletion of each of the three cytidines unique to MHV (C16, C19, and C20, with C16 predicted to be extrahelical), either singly or altogether, gave rise to viable viruses with WT-like growth characteristics ( Supplementary Fig. 2a) . Thus, the C residues are dispensable for viral replication, justifying our use of the WT model (denoted WT*) in physical studies presented below (see Figs. 1b, 5-7). Deletion of these cytidines results in three consecutive G-C base pairs in the upper segment of the stem-loop (Fig. 1b) . Table 1 for sequences). (b) Viruses recovered from infection with SL1-\u0394A35 viruses. Mutations that disrupt the three consecutive G-C base pairs in the WT genome either were nonviable (SL1-A) or resulted in a virus with a moderately smaller plaque size (SL1-B). Computer-assisted modeling with Mfold and ViennaRNA (see Kang et al. 19 ) indicates that the SL1-B mutant may adapt an alternative stable folding that largely maintains the SL1 structure, whereas the SL1-A mutant does not (data not shown). In contrast, the compensatory mutant SL1-AB-containing both the SL1-A and the SL1-B mutations and predicted to restore base pairing-possessed a similar plaque size and had almost identical growth kinetics as the WT virus ( Table 1 , Fig. 2a, Supplementary Fig. 1 ). These data reveal that the upper portion of SL1 must be base paired in order to support efficient virus replication.",

From two completely independent transfections, we recovered 12 plaque-purified viruses. Sequencing of the complete 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 UTRs of the 12 plaquepurified viruses revealed that only 2 of these viruses contained the SL1-\u0394A35 sequence; the remaining 10 viruses made up a diverse collection of singlenucleotide second-site substitutions in the immediate vicinity of the deleted nucleotide. Several of these plaque isolates contained identical sequences in their 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 UTRs. Viruses with identical sequences had similar plaque sizes. The plaque phenotypes of one example of each second-site mutation are presented in Table 1 . These mutations include C37U, A36U, C34U, and U33C (from the base of SL1 toward the hairpin loop; see Fig. 1c ) in the context of the parent SL1-\u0394A35 deletion. Additionally, viruses containing the SL1-\u0394A35 sequence were completely replaced by viruses containing a second-site mutation (G10A) in SL1 after only one passage in DBT cells, confirming that viruses containing only a deletion of A35 were genetically unstable and were subjected to strong negative selection. Remarkably, although diverse in sequence, all second-site mutants possess a common property: each is predicted to change a Watson-Crick base pair in the WT SL1 to a noncanonical base pair (vide infra).",

Cells infected with MHV SL1 mutant viruses synthesized both gRNA and the seven sgRNAs in approximately the same ratios as observed for a WT virus infection ( Supplementary Fig. 4 ). SL1-B, SL1-C, SL1-D, SL1-\u0394C16/19/20, and SL1-\u0394A35/C34U/3\u2032A78G viruses appeared to synthesize the lowest absolute quantities of gRNAs and sgRNAs (b 32% of WT), while the other SL1 mutant viruses directed the synthesis of virus-specific RNAs to levels greater than 55% of those observed with WT virus. One nonviable mutant, SL1-A, was also assayed for the ability to synthesize sgRNA 7 and gRNAs by a series of reverse transcription (RT) PCR assays of RNA extracted from electroporated cells. Previous characterization of nonviable SL2 mutants revealed that the primary defect in these genomes was that they failed to support the transcription of sgRNAs, whereas replication of gRNA was intact, 20 with the latter evidenced by a negative-sense gRNA replication intermediate. The same is true of the SL1-A mutant (Fig. 5) . A comparison of the in vitro translation efficiencies of fusions of WT and several SL1 mutant 5\u2032 UTRs that gave rise to nonviable genomes to luciferase reporters found no effect on translational efficiency (data not shown).",

In order to test this hypothesis and to gain additional insight into SL1 structure, we synthesized three representative second-site SL1 revertant mutant RNAs (see Fig. 1c ), measured their thermodynamic stabilities using quantitative optically monitored thermal denaturation methods (Fig. 6 ), and measured their structural (Fig. 7) and dynamic (Fig. 8) properties by NMR spectroscopy.",

In contrast to all of the other RNAs, the optical melting profile of the \u0394A35 SL1 RNA is well-modeled by a single twostate unfolding transition with a t m of 80.3\u00b0C and with a van't Hoff enthalpy of unfolding (\u0394H vH ) of 118 kcal mol \u2212 1 ( Table 2) . Thermodynamic parameters derived from melting curves acquired using differential scanning calorimetry are in excellent agreement with the optical melts, as well as the expected \u0394H estimated from the nearest-neighbor model. 23 In contrast, melting profiles obtained for the WT* RNA, as well as for the three \u0394A35 second- Table 2. site revertant mutant RNAs, are broader than that obtained for the \u0394A35 RNA; they also unfold at significantly lower t m . A broadened unfolding transition is consistent with a superposition of two sequential two-state unfolding transitions (e.g., the lower and the upper regions of the SL1 stem) or extreme non-two-state unfolding behavior of the SL1 stem in a single transition. In both cases, fitting of these melting profiles to a single two-state transition would result in insufficient van't Hoff enthalpy of unfolding (\u0394H vH ) to account for the unfolding of the entire 14-base-pair stem (Fig. 6) . This is exactly what we observe, with the apparent \u0394H vH of \u2248 70-75 kcal mol \u2212 1 in each case (fits not shown). Invoking a sequential two-state unfolding transition model reveals two unfolding steps with different amplitudes. If we assign the first unfolding step to the denaturation of the lower four base pairs in SL1 (predicted \u0394H vH = 38 kcal mol \u2212 1 ; t m = 61\u00b0C), 24 then we recover sufficient \u0394H vH in the second (major) transition (70-86 kcal mol \u2212 1 ) to account for unfolding of the entire molecule. From these fits, we calculate that the WT RNA is destabilized by 3.0 kcal mol \u2212 1 relative to the \u0394A35 mutant, while the three second-site revertants are destabilized by 2.1 kcal mol \u2212 1 (\u0394A35/U33C), 4.5 kcal mol \u2212 1 (\u0394A35/C34U), and 4.7 kcal mol \u2212 1 (\u0394A35/A36U) . These data reveal that each of the recovered revertant RNAs shares a common physical property with the WT RNA (i.e., all are thermodynamically destabilized relative to the \u0394A35 mutant).",

Although k ex is a complex function of the rate constants for the opening (k op ) and closing (k cl ) of the base pair (where the two-state equilibrium that is constant for basepair opening, K op , is defined by k op /k cl ), as well as of the intrinsic rate constant for proton exchange by base catalyst (k tr ), the magnitude of k ex often tracks with the magnitude of k op and K op , 28-30 since exchange will occur only very slowly from the basepaired state. 31, 32 These data reveal that the WT* RNA is dynamically asymmetric, with imino protons above the U13-U31 base pair characterized by slow k ex (\u22642 s \u2212 1 ), while those below this base pair are \u2248 2-to \u2248 50-fold faster. For the \u0394A35 RNA, imino proton solvent exchange rates are globally quenched, but most strongly near the site of the deletion. For example, the k ex values of U9, G10, and U31 are strongly attenuated in the \u0394A35 RNA by \u224810-, \u224832-, and \u22485-fold, respectively. Inspection of the base-pair dynamics for the three mutant SL1 RNAs reveals that each reintroduces or accentuates one or more specific features of the kinetic lability that characterizes the WT* RNA. For example, in all three RNAs, the imino proton solvent exchange rates of the U13\u2022U31 base pair are elevated relative to the \u0394A35 RNA by 4-to 10-fold, with some more so than in the WT* RNA. This perturbation is local in the \u0394A35/U33C RNA, but next nearest neighbor and long range in the \u0394A35/C34U and \u0394A35/A36U RNAs, respectively. The solvent exchange rate of G10 is also increased in all RNAs, most prominently in the \u0394A35/C34U RNA in the context of the new G10\u2022U34 base pairing, but also in the other two revertant RNAs (by 3to 4-fold). These data argue that the base of SL1 through the pyrimidine base-pairing region in both the WT* and the second-site mutant SL1s recovered from the genetically unstable SL1-\u0394A35 virus must be conformationally heterogeneous and dynamically unstable; this, in turn, allows this region to become transiently unfolded, so that a long-range interaction with the 3\u2032 UTR in MHV can occur.",

An early event in these processes, however, may well be genome circularization, which places the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 termini of the viral genome in close physical proximity to facilitate template switching during sgRNA minus-strand synthesis. Template switching is simply hybridization of the nascently synthesized minus strand corresponding to the intergenic or TRS-B sequences with the complementary leader TRS, a process expected to be strongly stimulated by the close physical proximity of the two complementary sequences. This process is almost certainly regulated by highly specific RNA structural motifs found in the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 UTRs and associated interactions with virally encoded and/or host proteins. The 5\u2032 leader RNA appended to all sgRNAs corresponds to the extreme 5\u2032 end of the 5\u2032 UTR and is composed of two stem-loop structures termed SL1 and SL2 just upstream of the TRS that defines the leader-body junction. 19 Characterization of nonviable viruses that harbor mutations in SL1 (this work) or SL2 20 reveals that these genomes are generally WT with respect to the synthesis of full-length gRNA and anti-gRNAs; however, all are absolutely impaired in sgRNA synthesis.",

Genomes containing A5G/U40C or A7G/U38C mutations that stabilize the extreme lower portion of the stem could not be recovered as viable viruses. While deletion of A35 is still viable, this virus is genetically unstable and gives rise to second-site mutations in both the 5\u2032 UTR and the 3\u2032 UTR. Interestingly, all the second-site mutations in the 5\u2032 UTR are located below the pyr-pyr base pairs and introduce noncanonical base pairs to maintain stem formation. Each of these mutants of SL1 stem structures are less thermodynamically stable compared with the genetically unstable SL1-\u0394A35 mutant, which forms a fully base-paired helical stem. These mutations also introduce conformational heterogeneity in this region as well. Interestingly, the MHV SL1-\u0394A35 revertant mutants bear some resemblance to the predicted secondary structure of a WT SL1 from a related group 2 CoV, HKU1. 19,35 HKU1 SL1 does not contain an extrahelical nucleotide, but instead is characterized by tandem-predicted A\u2022C and G\u2022A mismatches in precisely the same region where 5\u2032 UTR SL1 second-site mutations map in MHV.",

The k ex results show that the lower half of the SL1 is kinetically labile, and the three second-site revertant mutants recover one or more dynamic characteristics of the WT* RNA relative to the \u0394A35 mutant. Indeed, the closer that the site of mutation localizes to A35, the more similar the dynamic properties become relative to the WT* RNA. Therefore, a less stable and more flexible SL1 might facilitate a specific interaction between the singlestranded RNA in this region and a host-encoded or virally encoded protein(s) that is crucial for genome circularization and replication. A cartoon model that graphically illustrates this idea is shown in Fig. 9 , where the structure, conformational ensemble, or longer-lived partially opened form(s) of SL1, schematized by A1\u2032 relative to fully base-paired A structure, lowers the energy barrier for formation of a complex with hypothetical protein B, which in turn drives genome circularization and sgRNA synthesis.",

This result suggests that the nucleotide sequence of the 5\u2032 region of SL1 may also be important for viability.

Model of a dynamic SL1 that is consistent with the functional and structural data presented here. The fully based-paired SL1 (A; modeled by the \u0394A35 RNA) exists in equilibrium with one or more higher-energy conformers (A\u2032; WT* and \u0394A35 second-site revertants) that are partially unfolded or that experience dynamic destabilization as a result of noncanonical pairing. A hypothetical protein (B) binds to both A and A\u2032 to form the same partially unwound AB complex, but the affinity of B for A\u2032 will be higher, since the full energetic cost of unfolding the lower stem will not have to be paid; this interaction then mediates a long-distance RNA-RNA, RNA-protein, or proteinprotein interaction, which is crucial for the viral replication.",

This short sequence motif is conserved and predicted to be base paired in all group 2 CoV genomes, with the exception of SARS-CoV, which has an 5\u2032-AGGU sequence in what is predicted to be a region of SL1 weakly paired with the A extrahelical. 19 Strikingly, this SL1 5\u2032-6 GAG 8 sequence is identical with the 5\u2032-GAG sequence recovered from second-site mutations codeposited in 3\u2032 UTR in the same viruses; this suggests the possibility that an oligomer of the same protein(s) that is capable of recognizing and/or \"melting out\" this short purine-rich motif may well play an important role in mediating a physical interaction between the 5\u2032 UTR and the 3\u2032 UTR. An excellent candidate for this role is hnRNAP A1, since both 3\u2032 UTR mutations occur in exactly the same sequence context (5\u2032-GAAG, a near-consensus binding site for A1), and each replaces the second A with a G (a consensus hnRNAP A1 binding site), 36, 37 with the 5\u2032-AG as the key specificity determinant. hnRNAP A1 possesses RNA chaperone or helix destabilization activity and has been shown to bind the 3\u2032 UTR in MHV, while hnRNP A1 and PTB both bind to the complementary strands at the 5\u2032 end of MHV RNA. There is some evidence to suggest that these proteins together mediate the formation of an ribonucleoprotein complex involving the 5\u2032-and 3\u2032-end fragments of MHV RNA in vitro. 38 Our data are compatible with the three-step working model of CoV transcription recently refined by Zuniga et al., in which the first step is the formation of a 5\u2032-3\u2032 UTR complex through protein-RNA and protein-protein interactions, by which the TRS-L would be located in close proximity to sequences located at the 3\u2032 end of gRNA and, in turn, make template jumping from individual TRS-B sequences favored. 13 Overall, we hypothesize that SL1 must possess an optimum stability or kinetic lability required to mediate a key long-range physical interaction between the 5\u2032 UTR and 3\u2032 the UTR that is critical specifically for sgRNA synthesis, but not required for genomic minus-strand synthesis. This finding suggests that the structural requirements and/or the nature of the assembled replication complexes that are capable of synthesizing full-length gRNA is distinct from those that are capable of synthesizing sgRNAs. Such a functionally bipartite structure, where a subregion of a helical stem below tandem wobble pairs is tuned to an optimum stability, is reminiscent of stem I of the U2 snRNA; here, these features have been hypothesized to allow U2 to adopt a number of mutually exclusive folded conformations during spliceosome assembly and catalysis. 39",

The RNA concentrations were between 1 \u03bcM and 20 \u03bcM, and all melting profiles were shown to be independent of RNA concentration over this range. The first derivative data of absorbance at 260 nm and 280 nm with respect to temperature (dA/dT) were subjected to a simultaneous nonlinear least-squares fit of \u0394H i , t m,i , and A i , for each ith unfolding transition via sequential interacting two-state unfolding transition model using the t-melt program running on a Silicon Graphics O 2 workstation as previously described. 22 Melting profiles were subjected to single-or two-transition unfolding models, as described in the text. Parallel thermal melts (50-100 \u03bcM RNA strand) were carried out on a Microcal VP-DSC scanning calorimeter under the same solution conditions as previously described. 42 Analysis of these baseline-corrected data with single-transition two-state unfolding model gave fitted parameters in qualitative agreement with those obtained from analysis of the optically monitored thermal unfolding experiments (data not shown).",

The data were processed using NMRPipe 43 and analyzed using SPARKY (SPARKY 3; T.D. Goddard and D.G. Kneller, University of California, San Francisco) \u00a7. The imino proton resonances were assigned by the jump-return echo 1D and Watergate homonuclear 1 H-1 H nuclear Overhauser enhancement spectroscopy spectra (\u03c4 mix = 300 ms), with reference to an internal standard DSS at 10\u00b0C. The imino proton exchange rates were obtained by transfer of magnetization from water. 44 The exchange was initiated by selectively inverting the water proton resonance using a Gaussian 180\u00b0pulse (5.3 ms duration), with exchange delay times ranging from 2 ms to 850 ms, followed by a weak gradient (0.1 G cm \u2212 1 ) applied during the exchange delay to minimize effects due to radiation damping. At the end of the exchange delay, a second Gaussian pulse (2.8 ms) was applied to bring the water magnetization back to the z-axis. Imino proton resonances were detected using a gradient-enhanced spinecho sequence. The acquired spectral array was processed using NUTS (Acorn NMR, Inc.), and the intensities of the imino proton resonances of interest were fitted to obtain the imino proton solvent exchange rate k ex using Kaleidagraph (Synergy Software) as previously described. 28, 29 ",
