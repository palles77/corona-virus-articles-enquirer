            "text": "Background: Upper respiratory tract viral infections cause asthma exacerbations in children. However, the impact of natural colds on children with asthma in the community, particularly in the high-risk urban environment, is less well defined. Objective: We hypothesized that children with high-symptom upper respiratory viral infections have reduced airway function and greater respiratory tract inflammation than children with virus-positive low-symptom illnesses or virus-negative upper respiratory tract symptoms. Methods: We studied 53 children with asthma from Detroit, Michigan, during scheduled surveillance periods and self-reported respiratory illnesses for 1 year. Symptom score, spirometry, fraction of exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO), and nasal aspirate biomarkers, and viral nucleic acid and rhinovirus (RV) copy number were assessed. Results: Of 658 aspirates collected, 22.9% of surveillance samples and 33.7% of respiratory illnesses were viruspositive. Compared with the virus-negative asymptomatic condition, children with severe colds (symptom score \u22655) showed reduced forced expiratory flow at 25% to 75% of the pulmonary volume (FEF 25%-75% ), higher nasal messenger RNA expression of C-X-C motif chemokine ligand (CXCL)-10 and melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5, and higher protein abundance of CXCL8, CXCL10 and C-C motif chemokine ligands (CCL)-2, CCL4, CCL20, and CCL24. Children with mild (symptom score, 1-4) and asymptomatic infections showed normal airway function and fewer biomarker elevations. Virus-negative cold-like illnesses demonstrated increased FeNO, minimal biomarker elevation, and normal airflow. The RV copy number was associated with nasal chemokine levels but not symptom score. Conclusion: Urban children with asthma with high-symptom respiratory viral infections have reduced FEF 25%-75% and more elevations of nasal biomarkers than children with mild or symptomatic infections, or virusnegative illnesses.",

            "text": "Viral infections are the most common cause of asthma exacerbation in children. Cross-sectional studies of outpatient children who are sick with asthma exacerbations have shown 61% to 81% positivity for viral infection, compared with 21% to 42% of children who are well. [1] [2] [3] [4] Rhinovirus (RV) makes up more than 50% of viruses isolated. Viral detection is associated with asthma exacerbation treatment failure. 5 Nevertheless, apparently well children with asthma may also harbor respiratory viruses in their airways. 1, [6] [7] [8] [9] Twenty-one percent of hospitalized children 3 years or older without wheezing tested positive for virus. 3 Similarly, 23% of children 2 years of age or older with well-controlled asthma tested positive for virus. 4 Virus detection rates in healthy children are higher in young children [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] and developing communities. 16 Given the high rate of RV transmission within families 17 and the 1-to 3-week duration of RV shedding after infection, most asymptomatic infections likely represent children convalescing from a symptomatic viral infection. 18 The impact of respiratory viral detection in children with asthma in a community environment is less well studied. In children from Madison, Wisconsin, virus-positive weeks were associated with greater asthma symptoms, as well as more frequent loss of asthma control. 19, 20 In a community cohort of children with asthma from Randrick, Australia (a suburb of Sydney), RV was detected in 25.5% of nasal samples and associated with increased cough, phlegm, wheeze, and chest tightness. 21, 22 No change in peak expiratory flow (PEF) or forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV 1 ) was seen. However, effects of natural respiratory viral infections on lung function and symptoms in urban children with asthma remain largely undefined. Patterns of viral respiratory illnesses may differ between urban and suburban children. For example, sick inner-city infants have lower rates of viral detection than suburban infants. 23 In addition, asthma is undertreated in urban children, 24 which may amplify the effects of viral infection. Finally, whereas we 25 and others [26] [27] [28] [29] have examined nasal cytokine responses of children with asthma to natural colds, potential effects of asymptomatic or mild viral infections have not been studied.",

Parents also were asked whether their child had taken prescription medication for these conditions.

We hypothesized that children with high-symptom severe colds have greater airflow obstruction, respiratory tract inflammation, and viral copy number than those with milder colds and asymptomatic infections, as well as virus-negative conditions. In contrast to children from a suburban setting, 22 high-symptom viral infections were associated with reduced small airway function, as evidenced by changes in FEF 25%-75% . Compared with the virus-negative asymptomatic condition, children with severe colds showed elevations of nasal mRNA and protein biomarkers. Children with mild and asymptomatic infections showed fewer elevations. We found associations between viral load and nasal aspirate levels of chemokines, which together attract neutrophils and monocytes to the airways, but not those that promote eosinophil chemotaxis and allergic airways disease. This is the first study to correlate viral load and respiratory tract cytokine levels during natural colds.

            "text": "We found that subjects were only slightly more likely to have a virus during self-reported colds (33.7%) than during surveillance sample collection (22.9%). The high rate of viral detection during surveillance periods is consistent with previous studies in well children with asthma [1] [2] [3] [4] and is unlikely to be attributable to false positives, because RV detection was confirmed by amplification and sequencing of gel-purified PCR products in 92% of cases. Conversely, we believe the low viral detection rate during symptomatic episodes can be explained by the fact that samples were not collected in the fall and instead were only collected from January to August, when rhinovirus infections are less prevalent. The low symptom threshold for \"sick\" sample collection and financial reimbursement for each sick period assessment, which offset time and effort needed to participate, could also have contributed to a low viral detection rate. While our rate of viral detection is lower than reported previously, 1,2 it is consistent with the lower frequency of viral detection in urban children with respiratory illnesses compared with suburban children. 23 Finally, our data indicate that urban children with asthma experience frequent virus-negative upper respiratory tract illnesses. Cold-like illnesses were unlikely to represent false-negative viral infections, because they were unaccompanied by reduced pulmonary function or increases in nasal aspirate MDA5, a double-stranded RNA pattern recognition receptor that was increased in virus-positive samples and has been shown to be induced after RV infection. 35 Finally, when we retested a subset of our initial multiplex PCR viral detection results using standard RV qPCR, we found a false-negative rate of only 3%. As in previous studies, 23, 30 RV was the most common virus detected, and overall, inner-city infants had low rates of viral detection. However, we did not appreciate higher adenovirus rates as observed previously. 23 Although RV-C is associated with severe asthma exacerbations, 32,36-42 we did not recruit enough patients to discern a difference in symptom severity between species.",

One third of viral infections were associated with severe colds (symptom score \u22655), which by definition included children with wheezing, difficulty breathing, or breathing fast. In contrast to children with asthma from a suburb of Sydney, 22 children from Detroit with severe colds demonstrated significant reductions in FEF 25%-75% , consistent with small airways involvement. 43 This discrepancy could relate to the frequent undertreatment of urban children with asthma. 24 Because inhaled corticosteroid use reduces the rate of exacerbations, 44 urban children may be more susceptible to viral-induced reductions in airway function than suburban children. This hypothesis is consistent with previous studies in which the impact of pollution on asthma was seen predominantly in children not using steroids. 45, 46 In addition, we found that high-symptom severe viral infections, but not virus-negative illnesses, were associated with significant elevations in nasal aspirate mRNA expression of CXCL10, MDA5, and TLR3 and protein abundance of CXCL8, CXCL10, sICAM-1, CCL2, CCL4, CCL20, and CCL24. Previous studies of children with natural colds have shown increases in nasal chemokines. [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] Increases in MDA5, TLR3, and ICAM-1 are noteworthy, because each functions as a receptor for RV. Melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 and TLR3 are cytoplasmic and endosomal receptors for viral double-stranded RNA, respectively, 47 whereas ICAM-1 is a receptor for major group RV. 48 Samples from children with mild and asymptomatic viral infections also showed significant increases in nasal aspirate biomarkers, albeit fewer than samples from more severe colds.

We found that viral load was associated with protein abundance of CXCL8, CXCL10, CCL2, CCL4, and CCL20, chemokines that together attract neutrophils and monocytes to the airways, but not with IL-4, IL-13, CCL5, or CCL24, cytokines that promote eosinophil chemotaxis and allergic airways disease. In contrast, no association was seen between viral copy number and symptoms. Our data are consistent with a previous study in adults with asthma showing no correlation between severity of lower respiratory tract symptoms and viral load. 49 These data suggest that respiratory symptoms in children with asthma with natural colds may not depend on viral load alone. Other factors may determine asthma control after viral infection, including environmental and genetic factors. 50 The exact nature of the observed virus-negative respiratory tract illnesses is unclear. Unlike virus-positive illnesses, virus-negative symptomatic sicknesses were accompanied by increased eNO. Previous studies in subjects with asthma have shown that experimental exposure to allergen and particulate matter increases eNO in contrast to experimental RV infection, which does not, 51, 52 suggesting that virus-negative illnesses could have been precipitated by environmental exposures. We did not find an association between viral-negative illnesses and self-reported atopy or proximity to high-traffic roadways. However, because the 6 groups we studied do not represent different subjects but different disease states according to viral detection and symptoms, possibly these illnesses represent acute exposures to allergen, traffic, or other pollutants.",
