TGEY was first isolated by Doyle and Hutchings (1946) . It was long known as a prototype enteropathogenic virus. It replicates in the cytoplasm of the absorptive epithelial cellson the villi of the small intestine. Virus replication in these cells induces cellular degeneration and villous shortening leading to diarrhoea in swine of all ages. Mortality approaches 90 to 100 per cent in pigs infected during the first week of life (Hooper and Haelterman 1966 , 1969 , Pensaert et al 1970 . TGEY isolates have been reported to have a tropism not only for the intestinal tract but also for the respiratory tract, without causing respiratory disorders (Kemeny et al 1975) . Furuuchi et al (1979) showed that TGEY strains lose their enterotropism but can gain tropism for respiratory tract tissue by serial passaging in cell cultures.",

Both viruses show a complete cross neutralisation activity and possess common antigenic determinants on each of their structural proteins. Nevertheless, distinct antigenic differences have been demonstrated between both~ruses with the use of monoclonal antibodies. Non-neutralising monoclonal antibodies directed against E2 protein epitopes of TGEY do not recognise PRCY. This indicates that these epitopes of the E2 protein of TGEY are modified or absent in PRCY. Since PRCV and TGEY are antigenically closely related, PRCY can be regarded as a TGEY variant.",

This mode of transmission has resulted in a rapid spread of PRCV among the pig population in many countries in Europe. Virus was consistently isolated in high titres from nasal mucosa.

After oral inoculation, these viruses pass through the stomach and infect the absorptive enterocytes in the cranial and, or, mid small intestine and subsequently cause a contiguous infection of villous enterocytes. Within a few days, most small intestinal villi become infected and diarrhoea occurs. In contrast, TLM83 infected only very few cells at villus or crypt sites in the small intestinal mucosa and spread from the ileum to the duodenum. These results show a striking modification in tropism of PRCV for the intestine itself. It is unlikely that virus is spreading from the ileum to the duodenum through the gut lumen in the opposite direction to peristalsis. Other routes, such as via lymph or blood probably playa role.",
