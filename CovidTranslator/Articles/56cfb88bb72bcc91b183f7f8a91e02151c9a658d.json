[1] [2] [3] In order to increase national capacity, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) called for the creation of a tiered network of US hospitals, including frontline hospitals, assessment hospitals, and Ebola Treatment Centers (ETCs). 4 The Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR) also funded the creation of 10 Regional Ebola and Special Pathogen Treatment Centers (RESPTCs). 5 There are no definitive guidelines outlining the optimal environment of care for patients with highly infectious diseases. 5 Several of the RESPTCs and some of the ETCs built new stand-alone BCUs. 6 Other hospitals, such as Bellevue Health Center in New York City, transitioned existing intensive care unit (ICU) or other patient-care space into high-containment areas to be used on an as-needed basis. 7 Regardless of the chosen solution, there are several core principles that underlie the creation of containment areas that can provide care for patients with highly infectious diseases 3, 8 (Box 1). In this article, the authors review the key aspects of high-containment care and provide a framework for successful critical care in this environment.",

At a minimum, each patient room should have an anteroom for donning and doffing. Some facilities include an anteroom for donning and then a separate exit-room for doffing. 6 Although an exit-room is not necessary for an airborne pathogen, this design allows for unidirectional flow of patients, staff, and materials through the care space to limit the possibility of cross-contamination, particularly in the context of contact-transmitted pathogens, such as Ebola virus (EBOV) or other viral hemorrhagic fevers. This principle of unidirectional flow is a cornerstone of Ebola Treatment Centers in Africa. 9 Each unit should have an exit space where staff can shower after their care shift and change into clean clothing before exiting the unit. The unit should be equipped to provide critical care services and, depending on the local need, should anticipate caring for additional patient populations, including children and pregnant women. 6 In addition to the care space, there should also be a staff break area for personnel to gather before and after their shift. This space needs to be separate from the rest of the unit and ideally should be on a separate air-handling system to ensure safety.

Such a system also protects health care workers and other patients in situations whereby infectious particles might be aerosolized (eg, coughing, sneezing, procedures, such as endotracheal intubation, and so forth). 10 There are no existing regulations for air-handling systems in an entire containment unit. Guidelines for airborne infection isolation (AII) rooms from the CDC, American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-Conditioning Engineers, American National Standards Institute, and American Society for Healthcare Engineering can inform the design of the air-handling system for an entire unit. 6, 11 For example, the entire Johns Hopkins BCU is negative pressure relative to the rest of the hospital. Each contaminated area is designed to have a pressure differential of at least \u00c00.02-in water gauge to adjacent areas (twice the requirement for an AII). This design ensures that air does not travel from a contaminated to a clean space. All intake air is filtered using a minimum efficiency reporting value 16 filter that captures 99% of 1.0 mm particles; no air is recirculated. The anteroom air is changed at least 10 times per hour, whereas the patient room air is changed 12 to 15 times per hour, in accordance with AII guidelines. The air intake is on the ceiling, whereas the exhaust ports are on the wall close to the floor. This location creates laminar flow, away from a health care worker's face. The negative pressure for the unit is maintained by 2 rooftop fans, each equipped with high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters that capture 99.99% of particles with a size of 0.3 mm. Each fan can maintain the negative pressure for the entire unit in the case of a single fan failure or the need for maintenance. 6 Such redundancies improve the safety of the care space but may not be possible in all environments.",

Other point-of-care devices, such as digital stethoscopes, can overcome some of the limitations of PPE and enhance the diagnostic yield of the physical examination. 6 Portable digital x-ray devices also allow for chest and abdominal imaging, although the need to process the plate and decontaminate the equipment presents additional logistical problems. 14 Communication Communication is critical in a BCU environment, both for staff and for patients and their families.

[16] [17] [18] [19] Category A infectious substances, defined as substances that can cause life-threatening or permanent injury on exposure to humans, have strict federal regulations surrounding their packaging, transport, and disposal. 20 Only a handful of civilian facilities process category A substances, and the cost of transport and disposal is substantial. 21 The potential high volume of waste, both in the form of patient secretions and disposable products, such as PPE, present additional challenges. 18, 19, 21, 22 The CDC and ASPR recommend that facilities planning to care for patients with EVD consider installing steam sterilizers, or autoclaves, to sterilize waste before transport out of the containment facility. 17 It is critical that facilities using onsite autoclaves validate their protocols using simulated patient waste and biological indicators to ensure successful sterilization. 21 In a recent survey of 43 ETCs, 10 had onsite autoclave capabilities. The remaining centers had alternative plans that included packaging waste according to Department of Transportation's guidelines and transporting it to a certified processing facility. Onsite incineration is also a possibility but not currently planned by any ETC. 23 In addition to waste that is packaged for transport, facilities must have a plan to dispose of liquid waste from patient secretions (eg, urine, feces, vomit, and so forth) and procedures, such as dialysis. Specific protocols will vary depending on municipal regulations and water treatment facilities, but most call for the addition of a disinfectant for a designated period of time before allowing waste water to enter the sewage system. 17-19",

This planning must take into account the timing and availability of specific tests and protocols for handling, transporting, and evaluating specimens. 63 The CDC provides guidance for the management of clinical specimens when there is a concern for EVD. 64 Training Training is required to assure staff familiarity and proficiency in use of PPE, clinical protocols, and waste and environmental management. When caring for patients with EVD, the use of trained observers is recommended to assure proper donning and doffing of PPE. Although high-quality studies are limited, stepwise and orchestrated removal of PPE seems to significantly reduce the risk of self-contamination. 65 Training may be implemented via online learning, video presentations, in-person didactics, and experiential hands-on sessions.

            "text": "During the 2014 to 2016 EVD outbreak, 40% mortality was observed among more than 28,000 Ebola cases in West Africa. 68 Twenty-seven patients were treated in Europe and the United States. Most of these patients (82%) survived, largely because they received high-quality, supportive critical care. 7 Planning and delivering care to these patients was labor and resource intensive and took place in a few specialized centers. The cost to establish an Ebola treatment center in the United States has been estimated to be $1,200,000, whereas the cost to care for a single patient in this setting may be as high as $30,000 per day. 69, 70 Secondary transmission of EBOV to health care workers in a community hospital in Texas served as a stark reminder of the risks associated with caring for patients with EVD and the need for adequate resources, planning, and training to mitigate risk. 71 Although EVD is the most recent example of a highly infectious disease necessitating ICU care, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV serve as other important examples. The 2003 to 2004 SARS-CoV epidemic resulted in more than 8000 infections and 700 deaths worldwide. In Toronto, Canada, 375 probable and suspected cases of SARS-CoV occurred, with 72% related to a health care exposure. 72, 73 Similarly, MERS-CoV has resulted in large nosocomial outbreaks in Saudi Arabia and Korea. During an August-September 2015 nosocomial outbreak of MERS-CoV in Saudi Arabia, 63 patients, including 8 health care workers, were admitted to 3 MERS-CoV-designated ICUs. Hospital mortality among these patients was 63%. 35 Given existing and emerging serious infectious disease threats, including the everlooming threat of a severe influenza pandemic, it seems prudent to continue to build capacity to provide high-quality ICU level care for affected patients under safe conditions. An important step forward in this process was the establishment of the National Ebola Training and Education Center (NETEC) through the ASPR and CDC. 74 This collaboration provides funding to Emory University, University of Nebraska, and Bellevue Hospital Center, all centers with a successful track record of caring for patients with EVD, to train and prepare other US health care facilities for emerging threats. NETEC will work with the other federally funded RESPTCS as well as the NIH Special Clinical Studies Unit, to advance the clinical science behind high-containment care and to ensure the safety of patients, health care workers, and their surrounding communities.",
