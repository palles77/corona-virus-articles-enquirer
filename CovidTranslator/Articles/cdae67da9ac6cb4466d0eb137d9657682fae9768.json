TS-FIPV, unlike its parent strain, DF2 wild type FIPV (WT-FIPV), propagated at 31 \u00b0C (permissive temperature) but not at 39 \u00b0C (nonpermissive temperature). This temperature preference of TS-FIPV was also demonstrated in cats by the ability of the virus to replicate only at the lower temperature in the upper respiratory tract and not at systemic sites where higher temperatures (38-39 \u00b0C) prevail. Viral structural proteins and RNA were synthesized at 39 \u00b0C but some undefined maturational defect prevented the formation of infectious TS-FIPV at its nonpermissive temperature. TS-FIPV was more thennolabile than WT-FIPV which indicated alterations in the structural proteins of TS-FIPV, and a difference in the envelope protein of the two viruses was revealed by Western blot analysis. Plaque assay characterization showed that TS-FIPV produced small plaques in comparison to the large plaques of WT-FIPV. These unique characteristics possessed by TS-FIPV may account for its nonvirulent nature and ability to stimulate protective immune responses in cats.",

            "text": "Feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) is a complex and fatal disease of cats caused by infection with feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV). Previous attempts to consistently protect cats by immunization with other antigenically related coronaviruses such as porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) [26] , canine coronavirus (CeV) [2] , and human coronavirus [1] have been unsuccessful. Inconsistent protection was found when cats were given a sublethal dose of virulent FIPV and cats vaccinated with an avirulent FIPV were more easily infected than were nonvaccinated cats [14] . Recently, it has been demonstrated that an intranasally (IN) administered temperature sensitive FIP\u00a5 (TS-FIPV) vaccine is efficacious and safe upon FIPV challenge [5] . The pathogenesis of F I P is complicated and not fully understood. Evidence indicates that FIP is an immune-mediated disease [10] . The virus has been shown to replicate initially in the upper respiratory tract and small intestine [20] . Macrophages, the primary F I P V target cell, may then cross the mucosal barrier and spread virus throughout the cat [8, 24, 25] . Furthermore, a correlation between FIPV virulence in vivo and ability to infect macrophages in vitro has been observed [18] . It has been suggested that a strong cell-mediated immune response to F I P V may be more important than humoral immunity in protecting cats from this disease [15, 19] . However, the role of local i m m u n e responses in the upper respiratory tract and intestinal tract has not been carefully evaluated and may represent an important i m m u n e defense mechanism against FIP.",

The Western blots showed that WT-FIPV and TS-FIPV had structural protein profiles characteristic of that reported for other coronaviruses [17] . The peplomer protein band had a molecular weight of 200 kDa and the apparent molecular weight of nucleocapsid was 58 kDa for both viruses (Fig. 3) . Conspicuous differences appeared in the pattern of blotted envelope proteins for the wild type and temperature sensitive viruses. The WT-FIPV envelope (Fig. 3, E, a) , whereas the envelope protein of TS-FIPV produced several protein bands from 30 kDa to 46 kDa (Fig. 3, E, b) . The 28 kDa component of TS-FIPV was present but not at the same intensity as it was for WT-FIPV. The differences in molecular weight of the envelope protein of the two viruses were confirmed using immune cat sera. Immune sera from both TS-FIPV vaccinated cats and WT-FIPV challenged cats showed the same differences in the envelope protein of the two viruses as did the monoclonal antibody (data not shown). Thus, the differences in the molecular weights of the envelope polypeptides were not due to differences in reactivity to the monoclonal antibody. There was not a difference in the molecular weights of the envelope polypeptides from TS-FIPV grown at 31 \u00b0C or 39 \u00b0C (data not shown). The specificity of the monoclonal antibodies used for antigen detection is demonstrated by the lack of reactivity with NLFK cell extracts (Fig. 3, c) . The culture supernatant from TS-FIPV infected cells was monitored for the appearance of structural proteins at both the permissive and nonpermissive temperatures. TS-FIPV grown at 31 \u00b0C for 24, 48, 72, or 96h had all three structural proteins detected in the culture supernatant (Fig. 4A) . When TS-FIPV was grown at 39 \u00b0C for similar lengths of time, only nucleocapsid was found (Fig. 4B) . Nucleocapsid may be the only protein released at 39 \u00b0C or the less abundant peplomer and envelope proteins were not detected. Figure 4 also shows that the nucleocapsid protein released at 39 \u00b0C may be associated with infectious RNA or a few viral particles were released at 39 \u00b0C because these culture supernatants were infective at 31 \u00b0C. However, at 24 h the infectivity of Intracellular synthesis of TS-FIPV and WT-FIPV proteins was compared at 31 \u00b0C and 39 \u00b0C. Synthesis was monitored by IFA using coronavirus-specific monoclonal antibodies on acetone-fixed, infected cells. All three structural proteins of TS-FIPV were detected in the cells by IFA at both the permissive and nonpermissive temperatures ( Table 2 ). The TS-FIPV proteins appeared at both temperatures within 6 h post-infection. Similar results were observed with WT-FIPV infected cells at 39\u00b0C. When incubated at 31 \u00b0C, WT-FIPV proteins appeared somewhat later. Nucleocapsid was visible by 8 h while peplomer and envelope proteins were apparent by 9 h.",

            "text": "The differences in the characteristics of TS-FIPV and WT-FIPV may account for the protective immunity afforded by TS-FIPV [5] and the onset of disease by WT-FIPV. TS-FIPV and WT-FIPV differ in temperature specificity and stability, plaque size, and structural protein expression. In addition, TS-FIPV and WT-FIPV disseminate differently in the cat. Although the lesions responsible for the temperature sensitive defect have not been located, the characteristics of TS-FIPV in relation to its parent strain suggest a maturation defect. TS-FIPV growth is impaired at the optimal temperature (39 \u00b0C) for WT-FIPV but TS-FIPV replicates normally at its permissive temperature (31 \u00b0C). This temperature preference allows TS-FIPV to grow in the upper respiratory tract of cats but retards systemic growth in cats where the temperature is 39 \u00b0C. Replication of TS-FIPV in the upper respiratory tract may stimulate mucosal responses that may be required to protect cats against FIPV challenge. Mucosal immunity provided by TS-FIPV may be important in stopping the primary infection of FIPV since Stoddart et al. [20] has shown that FIPV administered orally replicated initially in the tonsil and small intestine. Also, the temperature preference of TS-FIPV may prevent a vaccine-induced sensitization of the cat. This contrasts with a previous study by Pedersen and Black [14] in which vaccination with a modified-live FIPV not only failed to protect cats against disease, but appeared to sensitize cats so they were more susceptible to FIPV challenge than were nonvaccinated cats.",

This same kind of difference was observed with two virulent strains of FIPV; UCD 1 did not have the low molecular weight component that was present in the Dahlberg strain of FIPV I-6]. These observed differences in the envelope protein may be due to differences in glycosylation. Further investigation by two-dimensional gels is needed to clearly differentiate the envelope proteins of TS-FIPV and WT-FIPV. Different characteristics are apparent between TS-FIPV and its parent strain WT-FIPV. The importance of these TS-FIPV characteristics in relation to the protective response of the virus in cats is under investigation.",
