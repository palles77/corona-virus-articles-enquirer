Yet, variation in the magnitude of response to corticosteroids has been observed. There is increasing evidence that preschool-aged children with viral-induced asthma may display a certain degree of corticosteroid resistance, requiring higher doses of corticosteroids to overcome it. The identification of determinants of responsiveness is complicated by design issues, including heterogeneous populations of children with asthma and bronchiolitis or of children with viral-induced and multi-trigger asthma phenotypes in published trials. Potential key determinants of responsiveness may include age, trigger, phenotype, tobacco smoke exposure and genotype. The mechanistic pathway for corticoresistance may originate from a gene-environment interaction, leading to non-eosinophilic airway inflammation. The clinician should carefully confirm the diagnosis of asthma and ascertain the phenotype to select appropriate phenotype-specific therapy.",

The PEAK trial involved 285 children aged 2 to 3 years with a high risk of asthma, that is, with four episodes or more in the prior year, and either one major risk factor (parental history of asthma or personal history of atopic dermatitis) or two of three minor risk factors (allergic rhinitis, eosinophilia, and wheezing without colds). More than 57% of enrolled children had positive aeroallergen skin tests, suggesting allergic or multi-trigger asthma in the majority of children. 18 Low dose daily fluticasone for two years was associated with a significant reduction in episode-free days, rescue bronchodilator use, and exacerbations requiring rescue oral corticosteroids and significantly improved lung function over placebo. The efficacy of daily maintenance inhaled corticosteroids to improve symptoms and prevent exacerbations in patients of all ages with multi-trigger asthma is clearly established.",

The delay of action of oral corticosteroids of 3 to 4 hours, spearheaded the concept of the ''golden first hour of treatment,'' supporting early and aggressive asthma management. 31 This explains the apparent ineffectiveness of clinical care pathways in which the early timing of corticosteroids was not stressed or applied. Although recommendations are relatively similar across age groups, the evidence for preschool-aged children is weaker due to their underrepresentation in relevant trials. (Figure 3) . Importantly, the accumulating evidence suggests heterogeneity in the magnitude of response to oral corticosteroids. Indeed, while most children and adults with moderate or severe acute asthma respond sufficiently well to be discharged within 5-6 hours of intake, a substantial proportion (36%) are admitted, 31 presumably because of a delayed or poorer response to oral corticosteroids. Moreover, in a large placebo-controlled randomized controlled trial of 700 children aged 10-60 months with mild-to-moderate viral-induced wheezing, oral corticosteroid was not superior to placebo for reducing the length of stay in hospital or improving the Pediatric Respiratory Assessment Measure clinical score, despite adequate power. 2 Critics have suggested that the absence of responsiveness to oral corticosteroids may due to: (1) a large proportion of children with bronchiolitis (with asthma documented in only 16% of children); (2) mild disease severity not requring corticosteroids; (3) insufficient corticosteroids dosage (1 mg/kg of prednisolone) and (4) the prolonged stay in hospital perhaps not supported by severity. 13 Yet, this study elicited a major discomfort regarding acute asthma management in young children, raising the possibility that preschool-age and/or viral triggers may be responsible for the poor apparent responsiveness.",

In fact, in a subgroup analysis, preschoolers treated with prednisolone paradoxically experienced a higher rate of unscheduled medical visits compared to those receiving placebo. Although preschool age and perhaps viral trigger may again be cited as causal, the following hypotheses were also raised to explain the lack of efficacy of parent-initiated treatment in view of the efficacy of physician-initiated oral corticosteroids: (1) the lower severity of exacerbations managed at home compared to those leading to a physician visit and (2) the difficulty for parents of making an accurate assessment of severity and need for oral corticosteroid treatment in their child.",

In a study of children aged 3-36 months, those infected with rhinovirus showed fewer relapses when treated with oral prednisone compared to placebo, suggesting that rhinovirus did not impair responsiveness to corticosteroids. 36 In a placebo-controlled trial of 283 young children with wheezing, prednisolone did not significantly decrease the overall time to discharge; however, it reduced by half the length of stay in children infected with picornavirus and by fourfold that of children with enterovirus, suggesting that response may be organism-dependant. 37 Clearly, oral corticosteroids may not be as effective in patients with viral infections as in those without, perhaps due to neutrophilic airway inflammation, a condition associated with poor response to corticosteroids.

In paediatrics, exposure to tobacco smoke has been associated with a higher incidence of URTIs and prevalence of asthma, and a greater severity of exacerbations. 40 However, the impact on the therapeutic response has not been documented in children, as asthma trials have not examined or failed to report subgroup analyses on environmental tobacco smoke exposure or active smoking. Yet, heavier environmental tobacco smoke exposure in preschoolers who spend more time at home than school-aged children 41 may explain a poorer response in young children.

            "text": "There is increasing evidence that inherited genes are not a deterministic genotype, but rather a genotype that encodes a potential range of phenotypes that will develop in response to a variety of environmental triggers. Consequently, variations in genes that modulate response to corticosteroids may predispose some people to environmentally-induced problems, such as smoke-or viral-induced asthma. Two major groups of genes are of interest: (1) those affecting susceptibility to asthma and specific phenotypes and (2) those directly interfering with response to corticosteroids by coding for major components of the pathway involved in corticosteroid action (Table 1 ). In the first group, 8 key polymorphisms in 7 genes have been identified; they can be divided into those coding for xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes and those coding for mediators of inflammation and immunity, specifically the ones demonstrated to affect lung function, disease severity and interaction with exposure to environmental tobacco smoke. 43 The selected polymorphisms affect gene function with top-ranking single nucleotide polymorphisms in a number of association studies. TGFB1 polymorphisms were found to correlate with disease severity; 44 CC16 polymorphisms play a role in the development and persistence of the asthma phenotype in childhood; 45 CD14 polymorphisms have been linked to pathogenesis of asthma and lung function in smokers. 46 The ORMDL3 gene confers susceptibility to early-onset asthma, particularly through interaction with early life exposure to environmental tobacco smoke; 43,47 GSTM1 null and GSTP1 genotypes have been associated with an increased risk of asthma 48 and rapid decline of lung function among smokers. 49 The ADRB2 receptor gene was found to contribute to the occurrence of wheeze among children who were exposed to tobacco smoke in utero and early childhood. 50 In the second group of genes, that is, those affecting the corticosteroid pathway, three genes (CHRH1, TBX21 and FCER2) were shown to correlate with response to corticosteroids, with associations replicated in several cohorts. [51] [52] [53] Identified polymorphisms are summarized in Table 1 . Genotyping should be strongly considered in clinical therapeutic studies to advance our understanding of the heterogeneity of response to corticosteroids and importantly, to better characterize the phenotypes of responders and poor responders for the clinician.",

An ongoing cohort study is testing this hypothesis in acute paediatric asthma and, importantly, exploring clinical characteristics and promising markers of poor response. ",

There is increasing evidence that, in contrast to those with allergic or multitrigger asthma, preschool-aged children with viral-induced asthma may display a certain degree of corticosteroid resistance, requiring higher doses of corticosteroids to overcome it. Other than design and confounding issues including mixed diagnoses, heterogeneous phenotypes and mild severity, other determinants of responsiveness may include age, trigger, tobacco smoke exposure, and genetic make-up. The mechanistic pathway for ''corticoresistance'' may originate from an interaction between genetic and environment, leading to non-eosinophilic or mixed eosinophilic/neutrophilic inflammation. Maintenance low-dose inhaled corticosteroids remain the cornerstone of the management of multi-trigger asthma of any age, while they show no evidence of effectiveness in children with viral-induced asthma. If a trial of daily montelukast is insufficient to control episodes, episodic high-dose inhaled corticosteroids with careful monitoring of medication use and growth may be considered for viral-induced asthma. Phenotype-specific treatment of children with asthma should be the focus of future research endeavours.",
