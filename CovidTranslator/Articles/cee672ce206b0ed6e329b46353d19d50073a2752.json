There have, however, been subsequent reports of virus transmission outside the Arabian Peninsula in the 3 years since (Iran, Tunisia, UK, France, Italy, and USA). 1 Globally, since September 2012, the World Health Organization (WHO) has been notified of 1368 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection, including at least 490 related deaths. 2 On May 20, 2015, South Korea reported its first confirmed case of MERS-CoV infection in a 68-year-old man who had a history of travel in the Middle East, 3 which was followed by chains of secondary infection. As of July 14, 2015, a total of 186 MERS-CoV cases, including 36 deaths, have been reported to the WHO. 2 MERS-CoV infection is of particular concern worldwide, not just because of its similarity to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) that hit Hong Kong and other countries in 2003, but also the importance of translating former lessons to improve infectious disease control. As tertiary, quaternary, and quinary spread of MERS-CoV have been described in outbreaks in the Middle East, 4 an understanding of the transmission dynamics of MERS-CoV in the current outbreak would contribute to the epidemiological knowledgebase for future reference.",

Firstly, infection within households was distinctly uncommon, accounting for only one first-generation case (wife of the index patient). Hospital infection was found to be the most important cause of the outbreak, but affected largely nonhealthcare workers (154/184 from the collected data); there has been no reported community spread. Secondly, the transmissions appear to have been multifocal as a result of infected patients attending more than one institution during the course of their illness. Two cases, including the index case, were reported to have visited four healthcare institutions, while three had visited three. This can be explained by the phenomenon of healthcare switching, a practice that is common in South Korea, where many adult patients may use hospital performance information to choose the service providers. 5, 6 This practice, coupled with the courtesy of visiting relatives in hospitals, appears to have fuelled the rapid dissemination of the virus. Thirdly, while MERS-CoV is known to spread by droplet transmission upon prolonged exposure to and within a short distance of source patients, direct contact could only be inferred in about 10% of the cases. It was found that the majority occurred instead in people who had shared the same healthcare environment. Fomite transmission is a possibility, as MERS-CoV has been shown to remain viable on inanimate surfaces, even after an extended interval of 48 h. 7 Similarly SARS-CoV RNA has been collected from hospital surfaces days after their deposition by infected patients, although the viability of this virus could not be confirmed. 8 Fomite transmission was the probable explanation for the transmission of SARS-CoV to passengers not in physical proximity to the source patient on an aircraft, 9 an observation that ",

The analysis could be conducted readily without relying on the lengthy process of consulting official surveillance reports. A similar approach has also enabled another research group to report their preliminary assessment of the outbreak, an effort that would not have been possible before the internet era. 10 There is, inevitably, the limitation of the validity of the epidemiological characteristics of each reported case, although much effort was made to verify the data in the course of the study. In fact the demographic profile of cases in the present study is similar to that subsequently released by the South Korean Ministry of Health (in Korean, machine translated, edited: http://www.mw.go.kr/front_new/al/sal0301ls.jsp?PAR_ MENU_ID=04&MENU_ID=0403). Overall, the present results suggest that effective control of MERS-CoV hinges on the upholding of infection control standards to minimize the emergence of new generations of the virus and on advising the avoidance of healthcare switching when there is a suspected infection.",

            "text": "Background: In May 2015, South Korea reported its first case of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection in a 68-year-old man with a history of travel in the Middle East. In the presence of secondary infections, an understanding of the transmission dynamics of the virus is crucial. The aim of this study was to characterize the transmission chains of MERS-CoV infection in the current South Korean outbreak. Methods: Individual-level data from multiple sources were collected and used for epidemiological analyses. Results: As of July 14, 2015, 185 confirmed cases of MERS have been reported in the Korean outbreak. Three generations of secondary infection, with over half belonging to the second generation, could be delineated. Hospital infection was found to be the most important cause of virus transmission, affecting largely non-healthcare workers (154/184). Healthcare switching has probably accounted for the emergence of multiple generations of secondary infection. Fomite transmission may explain a significant proportion of the infections occurring in the absence of direct contact with infected cases. Conclusions: Publicly available data from multiple sources, including the media, are useful to describe the epidemic history of an outbreak. The effective control of MERS-CoV hinges on the upholding of infection control standards and an understanding of health-seeking behaviours in the community. \u00df 2015 The Authors.
