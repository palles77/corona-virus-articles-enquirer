            "text": "Biogenesis and replication of the porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) include the crucial step of replicative polyprotein processing by self-encoded proteases. Whole genome bioinformatics analysis suggests that nonstructural protein 4 (nsp4) is a 3C-like serine protease (3CLSP), responsible for most of the nonstructural protein processing. The gene encoding this protease was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli in order to confirm this prediction. The purified protein was crystallized, and the structure was solved at 1.9 \u00c5 resolution. In addition, the crystal structure of the Ser118Ala mutant was determined at 2.0 \u00c5 resolution. The monomeric enzyme folds into three domains, similar to that of the homologous protease of equine arteritis virus, which, like PRRSV, is a member of the family Arteriviridae in the order of Nidovirales. The active site of the PRRSV 3CLSP is located between domains I and II and harbors a canonical catalytic triad comprising Ser118, His39, and Asp64. The structure also shows an atypical oxyanion hole and a partially collapsed S1 specificity pocket. The proteolytic activity of the purified protein was assessed in vitro. Three sites joining nonstructural protein domains in the PRRSV replicative polyprotein are confirmed to be processed by the enzyme. Two of them, the nsp3/nsp4 and nsp11/nsp12 junctions, are shown to be cleaved in trans, while cis cleavage is demonstrated for the nsp4/nsp5 linker. Thus, we provide structural evidence as well as enzymatic proof of the nsp4 protein being a functional 3CLSP. We also show that the enzyme has a strong preference for glutamic acid at the P1 position of the substrate.",

Adult and growing pigs were also affected, which was different from classical PRRS. 5 In 2007, an almost identical atypical PRRSV was found to be epidemic in Vietnam and China. 6 Presently, only inactivated or attenuated vaccines are available to combat PRRS, but their efficacy is less than satisfactory due to adaptive evolution of PRRSV, 7, 8 especially in the cases of the atypical PRRS outbreaks in China and Vietnam. 5, 6 This urgent issue prompted us to exploit the possibility of drug discovery for treatment of the highly pathogenic PRRSV infection.",

[13] [14] [15] Accordingly, whole genome bioinformatics analysis predicts that the PRRSV nsp4 domain should be the main protease responsible for processing most of polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab. 15 Previously, we reported on the successful expression of a gene construct encoding this putative serine protease in Escherichia coli as well as the crystallization of the protein. 16 As shown in Fig. 1a , after removal of the glutathione S-transferase (GST) tag, nine additional amino acid residues were still left at the N-terminus of the protein. The in vitro peptide cleavage assay in this study was performed using this recombinant enzyme with the nine extra residues present, while for the cis cleavage assay, even more additional Nterminal residues were present (Fig. 1b) . In both cases, the recombinant protein displayed proteolytic activity in vitro, thereby confirming the identity of nsp4 as the main protease in PRRSV replication (see results below).",

The Nterminal \u03b2-barrel (domain I) consists of six \u03b2-strands (aI to fI) and a short \u03b1-helix (helix A) that closes the barrel like a lid, whereas the middle \u03b2-barrel (domain II) comprises seven \u03b2-strands (aII to gII) and is connected to domain I via a very long loop (amino acids 69-89) (Fig. 2a) . The catalytic site is located at the opening of the cleft between domains I and II and consists of residues Ser118, His39, and Asp64 (Fig. 2a) , which are totally conserved among members of the Arteriviridae (Fig. 2c) . The extra Cterminal domain (domain III) comprises residues 157-199 and consists of two pairs of short antiparallel \u03b2-sheets (strands aIII-cIII and bIII-dIII) and two \u03b1-helices. The crossing angle is \u223c 90\u00b0between helix B and helix C (Fig. 2a) . A long N-terminal loop extends over domain II to the vicinity of domain III. The orientation of this loop is stabilized by the three hydrogen bonds Arg4 N\u2026Glu100 OE1, Thr5 N\u2026 Val99 O, and Thr5 OG1\u2026Val99 N (Fig. 2a) . The phenyl ring of Phe3 is directed into the hydrophobic interface between domains II and III and, therefore, also helps to stabilize the orientation of the Nterminal loop (Fig. 5a, left image) . (a) Overview of the proteolytic processing of PRRSV replicase. The rapid autocatalytic release of nsp1\u03b1, nsp1\u03b2, and nsp2 after translation of the ORF1a or ORF1ab is indicated. The rest of the junction sites are processed by nsp4. All the predicted cleavage sites are listed above the schematic boxes representing nsp1 to nsp12. Three of the putative cleavage sites were confirmed by our work. The rest of them were not evidenced to be processed in our study and therefore are labeled with a question mark on the top. The numerals indicated in each cleavage site are based on the genomic information of PRRSV strain JXA1 (GenBank accession no. EF112445). The recombinant protein for crystallization trials and in vitro peptide cleavage assay was produced using the GST fusion expression system (GE Healthcare). Nine extra N-terminal amino acid residues remained after removal of the GST tag. (b) The translational fusion proteins used in the cis cleavage assay.

However, the steric arrangement of the domains in the two proteases is quite different. An \u223c8 \u00c5 shift of domain III relative to domains I and II was observed in our structure, when compared to EAV nsp4.

As shown in Fig. 4a , the S1 specificity pocket of both the SGPE and EAV nsp4 is composed of three residues, with a conserved His (His134 in EAV nsp4 and His213 in SGPE) lying at the bottom of the pocket and one Ser (EAV nsp4: Ser137; SGPE: Ser216) lining one side and another Thr/Ser (EAV nsp4: Thr115; SGPE: Ser192) located on the opposite side. However, only the histidine (His133) could be found in our structure. The first serine involved in the S1 subsite is conserved in PRRSV 3CLSP (Ser136) (Fig. 2c ), but we cannot define its position due to the absence of electron density for the loop 136-140 as mentioned before. Nevertheless, there is no residue in PRRSV nsp4 to match the Thr/Ser (Thr115 in EAV nsp4, Ser192 in SGPE) on the other side of the pocket. Thr113 of PRRSV nsp4, which is also highly conserved among members of Arteriviridae (Fig. 2c) , is too far away to contact the substrate P1 residue (Fig. 4a ).",

As shown in Fig. 4b , the backbone amides of Ser195 and Gly193 in SGPE can form hydrogen bonds with and therefore stabilize the carbonyl oxyanion in the tetrahedral intermediate during catalysis. Although, in EAV nsp4, only copy B has the normal active oxyanion hole geometry while the other three copies only form collapsed ones, this difference is mainly caused by flipping of the peptide bond between Ser117 and Gly118 rather than a big change of the orientation of the signature turn. 12 However, in PRRSV nsp4, this oxyanion-specific turn is missing. Instead, a much more stretched loop leaves only the amide group of the catalytic nucleophile (Ser118) in contact with the oxyanion. We term this rare property an atypical oxyanion hole.",

Peptide SP8-1, derived from the junction sequence between nsp11 and 12, is most susceptible to this enzyme. After incubation with the recombinant enzyme, two new peaks with retention times of 16.9 and 17.4 min, respectively, were observed after analyzing a reaction volume of 40 \u03bcl on a C18 column (Fig. 6b) . The uncleaved peptide gave a peak at 18.5 min, consistent with that for the peptide-alone control (Fig.  6a) . The two product peaks were collected and analyzed by mass spectrometry (MS). The results showed that the calculated molecular masses corresponding to the peaks were 1241.6293 and 802.3875, respectively, matching their theoretical monoisotopic molecular weight (MW) perfectly (the theoretical MW for fragment KDKTAYFQLE is 1241.6291, and for GRHFTW, it is 802.3874).

The glutamic acid at the P1 position of the peptide substrate is crucial for effective cleavage and cannot be replaced by glutamine 3C-like proteases of RNA viruses are specific for either Gln or Glu at the P1 position of the substrate. Among the nidoviruses, coronavirus 3CL pro cleavage sites always have a Gln at the P1 position. 9, 23, 24 However, in the same order Nidovirales, the 3CLSPs of Arteriviridae, which are represented by the prototype EAV nsp4, show a clear preference for glutamic acid over glutamine at the P1 position of the substrate. 9 In EAV, of the eight cleavage sites of the replicative polyprotein processed by the main protease, only one junction contains a glutamine at the P1 position (Q2837/S joining nsp10/11), while all other cleavage sites have glutamic acid in this position. 11, 25, 26 Based on the similarity in genome organization between PRRSV and EAV, the putative cleavage sites processed by 3CLSP were predicted in PRRSV, all of which harbor a Glu at the P1 position. 15 Therefore, it is a reasonable assumption that the 3CLSP of PRRSV also shows preference for Glu over Gln at the P1 position of the substrate. The peptide SP8-M was synthesized and tested for cleavage by 3CLSP to confirm this prediction. SP8-M is identical in sequence to SP8-1 except that the Glu in P1 was replaced by Gln. As shown in Fig. 6d , the retention time for this peptide is 18.3 min. As expected, after incubation of the peptide with 3CLSP for 15 h at 37\u00b0C, only tiny amounts of cleavage products can be detected (Fig. 6e) , indicating that the glutamic acid at the P1 position in the substrate is crucial for effective cleavage by 3CLSP and cannot be replaced by glutamine.",

As shown in Fig.  1b , two constructs bearing the nsp4/nsp5 junction fused to a Myc epitope at the C-terminus of wildtype 3CLSP or its S118A mutant were made. Extra N-terminal and C-terminal hexa-histidine tags were introduced into the fusion proteins by the pET-28b vector to facilitate detection, resulting in the wildtype protein his-nsp4-[nsp4/nsp5]-Myc-his and the mutant product his-nsp4(S118A)-[nsp4/nsp5]-Mychis. After expression of the two gene constructs in E. coli, an apparent molecular mass difference between the two protein products was observed in SDS-PAGE, where the mass of the wild-type protein is smaller than that of the mutant by about 3 kDa, indicating the occurrence of cis cleavage at the Cterminal junction site of his-nsp4-[nsp4/nsp5]-Mychis (Fig. 7a) . Both the wild-type and the mutant proteins were purified and subjected to Western blot analysis for detection of the Myc epitope as well as the hexa-histidine tag to confirm this conclusion. Two different amounts (2 and 1 \u03bcg) of both proteins were loaded. At both amounts, the wild-type protein showed no signal for the Myc epitope, in contrast to a strong Myc signal given by the mutant protein (Fig. 7c) . Both proteins displayed an unambiguous His-tag signal, which was much stronger in the case of the mutant product, consistent with the fact that it contains a hexa-His tag at both termini while the wild-type protein only has the N-terminal tag left (Fig. 7b) . These results clearly showed that his-nsp4-[nsp4/nsp5]-Myc-his removed its C-terminal tail via cis cleavage after expression.",

            "text": "The S1 specificity pocket that accommodates the side chain of the substrate's P1 residue plays a vital role in substrate recognition and catalysis. In all the reported 3CL pro s with known structures, a conserved histidine is found sitting at the bottom of the pocket. 12, 22, [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] Mutational analysis found that any replacement of this residue both in human and feline coronavirus M pro completely abolished their proteolytic activities. 34, 35 As a member of the 3C-like protease family, it is not surprising that in PRRSV nsp4, His133 is localized appropriately to fulfill this function. However, besides this conserved His, the S1 subsite of both SGPE and EAV nsp4 includes two additional Ser/Thr residues as shown in Fig. 4a , 12, 20 for which no counterparts can be found in our structure. We suspect that Ser136 must also be involved in P1 side-chain recognition based on two facts. First, this Ser is absolutely conserved in arterivirus nsp4 sequences. In EAV nsp4, the same Ser has been proposed to contact the side chain of the P1 glutamic acid (Fig. 4a) . Furthermore, although we cannot define the position of Ser136 due to total lack of electron density, the two residues directly preceding it are clearly defined. Therefore, Ser136 is confined to a limited steric space close to the modeled P1 residue. A hydrogen bond between this disordered residue and the P1 amino acid could help stabilize both residues upon substrate binding. We also note that loop 136-140 lines one wall of the S1 subsite and is highly flexible. It may function like a lid that can partially cover the pocket after the entry of the P1 side chain and therefore help clinch the substrate to allow the occurrence of nucleophilic attack onto the scissile bond. This may also, to some extent, compensate the lack of a third partner in the S1 specificity pocket of PRRSV nsp4 (see Results). Snijder et al. reported that mutation of this third residue, Thr115 in EAV nsp4, to other amino acids can have various effects on catalysis, indicating its important role as part of the S1 subsite. 11 It is noteworthy that our enzyme also shows weak proteolytic activity against SP8-M with a Gln at the P1 position ( Fig. 6e; Table 2 ). This might reflect the flexibility of the substrate binding of the enzyme that can also accommodate Gln in addition to Glu. The catalytic triad is shown as sticks. His133 is also shown because of its crucial role in substrate recognition. The missing loop and the oxyanion hole region are also highlighted. The consistent conformations of these parts between the native and the mutant proteins make the mutant structure an appropriate model for enzyme-substrate interaction studies.",

In serine proteinases, the catalytic cleavage of the substrate peptide bond is assumed to undergo a transformation from the ground planar state to a transition state that is characterized by the formation of a tetrahedral intermediate. 37 The backbone NH groups (in the case of subtilisin also including the side chain of Asn155) can hydrogen-bond with the resultant carbonyl oxyanion of the substrate P1 residue during cleavage at the scissile bond and are therefore very important in catalysis. [37] [38] [39] [40] Both in EAV nsp4 and SARS-CoV M pro , two forms of the oxyanion hole were observed, an active form and a collapsed one. 12, 28 Nevertheless, in both forms, the signature turn remains almost the same. In EAV nsp4, the different forms of the oxyanion hole are believed to arise mainly from the flipping of the peptide bond between Ser117 and Gly118, which is common in pairs of homologous protein structures. 12, 41 However, as shown in Fig. 4b , the stretched form observed in our structure (lacking the helix-like turn) can only support the formation of one hydrogen bond with the oxyanion to stabilize the negative charge. We suspect that the hydrophobic strength of Phe112 might be the main cause for this atypical oxyanion hole. This is supported by our recent mutational work of Phe112Ala. The mutant enzyme shows some higher enzymatic activity, implying the role that Phe112 played in the formation of the atypical oxyanion hole, which might be attributed to the observed low enzymatic activity (data not shown). This needs to be verified by a clear crystal structure and further mutational work in the future. The unusual properties of both the S1 subsite and the oxyanion hole observed in our structure, as we discussed above, might well explain the low in vitro catalytic activity of PRRSV nsp4 compared to that of other 3C-like proteases in similar experiments. 21, 22 Another interesting point is that in the neighborhood of the substrate-binding site, Cys111 is located in close proximity to Cys115 but has its side chain directed away from that of the latter, so that a disulfide bond cannot be formed. Disulfide bonds are rare in proteins that function in the cytosol, but for instance in coronavirus nonstructural proteins, several cases have been observed. [42] [43] [44] We presume that the side chain of Cys111 can adopt a different conformation and form a disulfide bond with Cys115, perhaps after substrate binding to facilitate the proteolysis. This should be addressed in the future with a substrate-enzyme complex structure. With great efforts, we failed to obtain the complex crystals so far.",

            "text": "As the main proteinase in Arteriviridae, nsp4 must first release itself from the replicative polyprotein to fulfill its proteolytic function of processing the downstream domains into functional replicative subunits. Unlike EAV, whose nsp4/nsp5 cleavage site is reported to be cleaved in the major processing pathway with the presence of nsp2 as the cofactor, 26 we have shown in our cis cleavage assay that a quick and thorough cleavage at the C-terminus of PRRSV nsp4 occurs automatically in vitro. Therefore, based on the results obtained in this study, we propose a possible nsp4 release model for PRRSV: Translation of ORF1a is followed by a rapid autocatalytic release of nsp1\u03b1, nsp1\u03b2, and nsp2; 45, 46 subsequently, the nsp4/nsp5 junction site is quickly processed via cis cleavage by the 3CLSP to yield nsp3-nsp4 and nsp5-nsp8. Then, a trans cleavage of the nsp3/nsp4 joining sequence occurs to generate nsp3 and free nsp4, which can then fulfill its role as the main proteinase. Nevertheless, taking into account that the trans processing of the nsp3/nsp4 junction is very slow as shown by the peptide cleavage assay (see Results), we believe that cis cleavage at this site might also happen, especially in the early stage of translation of ORF1a. In support of this, a very long N-terminal loop was observed in our structure (Fig.  2a) . This terminus can be brought into an appropriate position for cis cleavage by a conformational rearrangement upon breaking of the three hydrogen bonds mentioned above. Refinement of this cleavage model will require further studies in the future.",

            "text": "For coronaviral 3CL pro s such as in SARS-CoV, there is plenty of evidence showing that the Nterminus of the protease is crucial for its proteolytic activity. Either addition of extra residues to the Nterminus or deletion of the N-terminal residues is deleterious to enzyme activity. [47] [48] [49] There are also many reports showing that the homodimeric form of the SARS-CoV 3CL pro is the catalytically active form and the unique C-terminal extra domain plays a key role in controlling the dimer-monomer equilibrium. [50] [51] [52] [53] In our previous report, we showed that the recombinant PRRSV nsp4 with nine extra amino acid residues at the N-terminus is monomeric in solution. 16 These extra residues might also affect the enzymatic activity of PRRSV nsp4 and might be attributed to the high K m observed for the enzyme. Nevertheless, we confirm here that the recombinant enzyme displays obvious catalytic activity in vitro. Furthermore, the enzyme is actually active in vitro even with 21 extra N-terminal residues added as in the cis cleavage assay. Thus, the 3C-like proteases of Nidovirales likely evolved different proteolytic mechanisms for Coronaviridae such as SARS-CoV and Arteriviridae such as PRRSV. These aspects merit further study in the future.",

The nsp4 activity assay was performed in a reaction volume of 200 \u03bcl, using 5 \u03bcl nsp4 (or S118A mutant nsp4) (25 mg/ml) and 1 \u03bcl peptide (50 mM) in the reaction buffer (20 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, 1 mM DTT, and 10% glycerol) to yield a final concentration of 25 \u03bcM enzyme and 250 \u03bcM peptide in the assay. Cleavage reactions were routinely incubated at 37\u00b0C for 15 h. The reactions were terminated by the addition of an equal volume of 2% trifluoroacetic acid, and samples were frozen in liquid nitrogen immediately before being stored at \u2212 70\u00b0C. The samples were centrifuged for 10 min at 12,000 rpm before analysis by reverse-phase HPLC on a C18 column (4.6 mm \u00d7 250 mm). Cleavage products were resolved by using a 30-min, 0-40% linear gradient of acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The absorbance was determined at 215 nm, and peak areas were calculated by integration. The identities of the product peptides were verified by quadrupole Fourier transform-MS analysis and/or comparison with HPLC traces of peptide standards.",

This peptide contains the nsp11/nsp12 cleavage site (indicated by the arrow). The enhanced fluorescence due to the cleavage of this substrate as catalyzed by the enzyme was monitored at 490 nm with excitation at 340 nm, using a Cary Eclipse fluorescence spectrophotometer. The experiments were performed in a buffer consisting of 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.3), 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, and 5 mM DTT. Kinetic parameters K m and k cat were determined by initial-rate measurements at 25\u00b0C. The reaction was initiated by adding proteinase (final concentration, 0.5 \u03bcM) to a solution containing different final concentrations of the fluorogenic peptide (10-40 \u03bcM). The initial rates were converted to enzyme activities (micromole substrate cleaved per second).
