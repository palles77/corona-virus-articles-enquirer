The location of these viruses in the Togaviridae was based on their resemblance, with respect to morphology, virion dimensions and nature and size of the genome, to other members of that family. However, analysis of the replication of arteriviruses, supported by sequence data, has clearly shown that the Togaviridae is a most inappropriate home for them. Instead, investigations have revealed that the arteriviruses have more in common with members of the Coronaviridae. However, there are major differences between the arteriviruses and the Coronaviridae which\" has resulted in a reluctance of the Coronaviridae. It was proposed, and accepted by the Executive Committee of the International Committee for the Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV), that arteriviruses should be withdrawn from the Togaviridae [6] .",

            "text": "Subsequently it was demonstrated that these viruses had a single, high molecular weight, single-stranded RNA genome which had a 3' poly(A) tail and was infectious. It was associated with a single protein, the nucleocapsid protein (N). Virions had a density in sucrose generally in the range 1.15-1.18 g/ml [27, 38] . Although coronavirus virions contain few polypeptides, the characterization of these took some time because of the presence of contaminating host cell proteins, variation between species with regard to processing (cleavage, glycosylation) and differences in gene complements. It was eventually established that all coronaviruses had, in addition to N, a large, heavily glycosylated surface projection or spike glycopolypeptide (S) of about 200 kDa, which was cleaved into two glycopolypeptides in some species, and a small integral protein (M), about 25 kDa, associated with only a few glycans (Fig. 1) . A subset of the genus (Table 1) has an additional glycoprotein, the haemagglutinin-esterase (HE) protein, which is not essential for replication, at least not in some cell types (Table 1) . A virion-associated, small membrane (sM) protein has also been described; todate it has only been looked for and demonstrated in IBV and TGEV [13, 20] (Fig. 1) . Replication is within the cytoplasm and five or more subgenomic mRNAs are generated, these forming a 3' coterminal nested set (Fig. 2) . Table 1 ). The sM protein has not been identified in all coronaviruses and its exact association with the virion envelope is unclear A leader sequence of 60-70 or so nucleotides, corresponding to sequence at the 5' terminus of the genome, is present at the 5' end of all mRNas. Only the unique genes in the 5' unique of each mRNA are translated. The genes for the structural proteins are located in the 3' portion of the genome, in the order 5'-S-M-N-3' [29, 30, 36] (Fig. 2) . The era of cloning and sequencing revealed that coronavirus genomes comprised about 30.000 nucleotides, the 5'-most gene, number 1, comprising approximately 20.000 nucleotides and encoding the putative RNA-dependent RNA polymerase [2, 3, 14, 19] .",

As with other positivestranded RNA viruses there are conserved domains for putative RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and NTP-dependet helicase activities. These are within the second, lb ORF, of the putative replicase gene. The corresponding coronavirus domains resemble those of torovirus more than that of the other positive-stranded viruses [31] , with the exception of the arteriviruses, of which more below. Most of the torovirus ORF la has yet to be sequenced. An important aspect of the evolution of coronaviruses is recombination. Homologous recombination has been demonstrated experimentally with routine hepatitis coronavirus (MHV) [181] . Perhaps the most surprising aspect of recombination has been the discovery that some coronaviruses (Table 1) possess an additional gene, encoding an haemagglutininesterase protein (HE) which has some 30% amino acid identity with the amino-terminal subunit of the haemagglutinin-esterase-fusion (HEF) glycoprotein of influenza C virus (a negative-strand RNA virus), implying that non-homologous recombination has occurred during the evolution of coronaviruses [21] . Berne torovirus also has an ORF, number 4, situated between the N and M genes, which encodes a polypeptide that has about 30% identity with both the coronavirus ItE protein and the influenza C virus HEF protein [33] . Notwithstanding the fact that the torovirus ORF 4 only encodes 142 amino acids in contrast to the > 400 amino acids of the HE and HEF protein, this further demonstrates the evolutionary links between toroviruses and coronaviruses. It should not be inferred that the HE gene-containing coronaviruses are more closely related to toroviruses than are those that lack HE, or that there is a closer relationship with influenza C virus. However, in the context of virus taxonomy, the possession by both coronaviruses and toroviruses of a gene, HE, with the coding potential for a protein sharing significant amino acid identity is an additional reason for including these viruses within one family.",

While generation of several 3' co-terminal subgenomic mRNAs is a feature of both genera, as is the presence of conserved sequences upstream of each gene, the presence of leader sequences (60-70 nucleotides long) on the 5' termini of the mRNAs has been found for coronaviruses but not toroviruses. A number of ORFs which are present in coronavirus genomes are absent from toroviruses. One such ORF, 3c and 4 in the case of infectious bronchitits virus and transmissible gastroenteritis virus, respectively, has been shown for these two species to encode a small membrane protein (sM) which is associated with the virion envelope although detail of its disposition is not known [13, 20] (Fig. 1) .

It might seem unlikely that the genus Arterivirus, for many years assigned to the family Togaviridae, on account of its morphology (Fig. 1) and genome size (13-15 kb), would be removed from this family and be considered more closely related to the Coronaviridae. This, however, is the case, the ICTV Executive Committee accepting the recommendation that the arteriviruses should be removed from the Togaviridae in April 1992 [6] . The basis for this move was that key features of the arterivirus genome organization, transcription and translation were atypical of the togaviruses but bore a strong resemblance to those of the Coronaviridae (Fig. 2 and Table 2 ). The Y-most gene, number 1, comprises two large ORFs, la and lb, translation of lb involving ribosomal frame-shifting [10] . Within ORF la are two domains, one belonging to the protease superfamity which comprises the chymotrypsin-like and picornavirus 3C-like proteolytic enzymes, the other domain belonging to the papain-like superfamily, wich are also present in the coronavirus ORF 1 a (this region of the torovirus genome has not been sequenced) [19, 34] . Moreover, the polymerase and helicase domains identified in ORF lb of coronaviruses and toroviruses are not only present in ORF lb of arteriviruses, but also the arterivirus domains have greater amino acid similarity to those of the Coronaviridae than to other positive-strand RNA viruses [6, 12] . The genes encoding the surface glycoproteins, the M and N proteins occur in the genome in that order, as with the corona-and toroviruses. Six subgenomic RNAs are produced in a 3' co-terminal, nested-set arrangment and each message has a leader RNA derived from the 5' terminus of the genome [8, 16] (Fig. 2) . Although smaller than its counterpart in the coronaviruses and toroviruses, the arterivirus M protein is assumed to have a triple membrane-spanning domain ( Table 2) .",

Arterivirus virions are only half the diameter of the other two genera and have an isometric nucleocapsid (Fig. lc) . Unlike the surface projections of the corona-and toroviruses, the arterivirus surface glycoproteins, of which there are at least two (GL and Gs), are not prominent and do not have a coiled-coil structure ( Table 2 ).

The family is divided into three subfamilies, the divisions being largely based on biological criteria e.g. host cell range, length of replication cycle [28] . The results of comparison of gene complements, genome organization and amino acid similarity of proteins supports the division of this family into three subfamilies, with one exception, namely Marek's disease virus. This is currently within the Gammaherpesvirinae, based on its tropism for tymphocytes, but it more closely resembles members of the Alphaherpesvirinae on molecular criteria.

Implicit in this proposal is that the common characteristics should be weighted more than the differences and that the similarities can be accommodated taxonomically without the introduction of a taxon higher than family. One consequence of this scheme is that the taxon order would remain available for future use in a context that might include other virus families. The name Coronaviridae should not, of itself, be an impediment to this proposal. It can be argued that the name Coronaviridae has been in use for 25 years, long enough for it to evoke in the minds of virologists those many characteristics, described above, which define its two existing genera -and of which the existence of a 'corona' (and other morphological features?) is perhaps now the least important. However, the possibility of a new name for a family embracing all three genera, within two subfamilies, could be given further consideration.",

Clearly, if morphology and fundamental aspects of architecture such as nucleocapsid structure are to continue to be of pre-eminent importance in the defining of virus families, then Arterivirus cannot be in the Coronaviridae but should be assigned to a new family. However, it remains highly desirable to reflect replicase homologies and the similarities in genome organization and replication strategy by a recognized taxon. The next higher taxon is that of order. Recently the ICTV Executive Committee set a precedent by recognizing the first virus order, Mononegavirales. This comprises the families Filoviridae, Parau~vxoviridae and Rhabdoviridae [25] . Members of these three families are all enveloped but have readily distinguishable virion morphology and substantial differences in genome size, the genomes being approximately 11 to 16 kb. Common features include a non-segmented, negativesense genomic RNA, a helical nucleocapsid, the initiation of primary transcription by a virion-associated RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, similar gene order and a single 3'",

The common feature which has led to their inclusion in an order is the possession by these bacteriophage of a tail and the use of this structure for attachment to host cells, and as a conduit through which the viral DNA passes into host cells. Members of the three families differ with respect to the nature of the tail (contractile, non-contractile/ long or non-contractile/short) and in other respects e.g. 4-to 5-fold range in genome size, number of proteins. Thus the order Caudovirales has been defined on criteria ( a particular morphological, structural and associated functional feature) quite different from those applied to the Mononegavirates (where nature of the genome, genome organization and overall replicate strategy are major uniting factors). It would appear, therefore, that there are no hard-and-fast rules governing the inclusion of families into an order. In this context, creation of an order for the arteriviruses, coronaviruses and toroviruses would seem to be a logical way of highlighting the similarities and differences between these viruses.",

Gene 1 comprises two large ORFs, la and lb. Some of the smaller genes, e.g. gene 5 of MttV, comprise more than one ORF. Not all members of one genus have an identical gene complement. For example, the genes containing ORFs 2 and 2a (which encodes the HE protein) of MHV are absent in some coronaviruses. The HE gene is present as a pseudogene in some strains of MHV. The black box at the 5' terminus of the genome of coronavirnses and ~eriviruses is a leader sequence which is also present at the 5' end of the mRNAs. The nested-set of mRNAs shown corresponds to EAV although a similar arrangement is a characteristic of all three genera",
