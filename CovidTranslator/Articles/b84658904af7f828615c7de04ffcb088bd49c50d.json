In agreement with previous work, incubation of COV with valinomycin resulted in a perturbation of the absorbance spectrum of oxidized heme uu3 in the Soret region (430 nm); gramicidin had no effect on the heme aa3 absorbance spectrum. Different concentrations of the two ionophores were required for maximum respiratory control ratios in COV; 40-to 70-fold higher concentrations of valinomycin were required to completely uncouple electron transfer activity when compared to gramidicin. The proton transloeating activity of COV incubated with each ionophore gave a similar apparent proton translocated to electron transferred stoichiometry (H+/e-ratio) of 0.66 + 0.10. However, COV treated with low concentrations of gramicidin (0.14 mg/g phospholipid) exhibited 1.5-to 2.5-fold higher rates of alkalinization of the extravesicular media after the initial proton translocation reaction than did COV treated with valinomycin, suggesting that gramicidin allows more rapid equilibration of protons across the phospholipid bilayer during the proton translocation assay. Moreover, at higher concentrations of gramicidin (1.4 mg/g phospholipid), the observed H+/e-ratio decreased to 0.280 + 0.020, while the rate of alkalinization increased an additional 2-fold, suggesting that at higher concentrations, gramicidin acts as a proton ionophore.",

Addition of valinomycin collapses the membrane potential by coordinating potassium ions and carrying these ions across the phospholipid bilayer by a mobile carrier mechanism (11).

Similar modifications of COX properties were also observed with another mobile potassium ionophore, nonactin (13) . The conclusions drawn from these data were that valinomycin binds directly to COX and that the modified form of the enzyme translocates protons with the observed H+/e-stoichiometry of 1.

We chose gramicidin as an ionophore because of its ability to mimic valinomycin in energy-dependent cation uptake and swelling in mitochondria and as a general membrane potential dissipating agent in other energy-transducing membranes (11). In the presence of low concentrations of gramicidin, we observe H+/e-ratios similar to those of COV treated with valinomycin.",

The effects of gramicidin on COX electron transfer and proton translocating activities were tested for two reasons: (i) gramicidin is a channel-forming ionophore, whereas valinomycin is a cyclic ionophore that performs its function as a mobile potassium carrier. The utilization of a membrane-spanning protein channel such as gramicidin could minimize the interaction of the ionophore with COX; (ii) gramicidin mimics valinomycin in its ability to stimulate energy-linked cation uptake and swelling in isolated mitochondria (11). Gramicidin also dissipates the membrane potential in both chloroplasts (as indicated by the abolition of the light-induced 515-nm absorbance change that is thought to reflect the buildup of a membrane potential in chloroplasts) and also mitochondria, suggesting similar cation permeabilities induced by the two ionophores in isolated membranes [see Ref. (11) and Discussion].",

The difference spectrum of heme aa in COV (+TX) was determined in the presence of valinomycin (A) or gramicidin (B) as described under Materials and Methods using stoichiometries of 1.8 mg valinomycin/g PL or 3.1 mg gramicidin/g PL, respectively. ratio in the presence of valinomycin ( Fig. 2A) or the respiratory control ratio in the presence of gramicidin (Fig.  2B) , and completely uncoupled electron transfer activity of COV (+TX) are presented. All RCR parameters are defined under Materials and Methods. Our previous work has shown that the RCR,,, value of a preparation correlates with the proton-pumping activityof COX in phospholipid vesicles as a linear relationship (16) , whereas the RCR value does not show this linearity. Figure 2A shows that the maximum uncoupled electron transfer activity was observed at 18 mg valinomycin/g phospholipid (PL) (5.3 PM valinomycin in the assay); however, at higher concentrations of valinomycin, significant inhibition of electron transfer activity was observed (40%). The maximum RCR value and the uncoupled electron transfer rate occur at a similar concentration of valinomycin, whereas the minimum RCR,, value occurs at higher concentrations of valinomycin (150 mg valinomycin/g PL). Figure 2B shows that the maximum electron transfer activity and RCR occur at the same concentration of gramicidin (0.71 mg gramicidin/g PL, 0.08 PM gramicidin in the assay), although the minimum RCR,,,, value did not occur until much higher concentrations (5 mg gramicidin/g PL). Gramicidin caused a 20% inhibition of uncoupled electron transfer activity at the highest concentrations tested (12 PM gramicidin). Overall, the concentration dependencies for the effects of gramicidin and valinomycin on the electron transfer activity and RCR parameters were completely different. In fact, 40-to 70-fold less gramicidin was required to completely uncouple COX electron transfer activity, suggesting that the two ionophores may have different mechanisms of membrane potential dissipation. In mitochondria, gramicidin is 30-fold more efficient in dissipating the membrane potential than valinomycin (11).",

Measurements of the membrane potential formed in COV suggest that a gradient of 66 mV is formed upon the initiation of electron transfer (10, 30) . Dissipation of the membrane potential is required for measurement of proton translocating activity in COV because the small size of COV (diameter of 250 A, Ref. (31)) causes a buildup of the membrane potential that inhibits COX electron transfer activity (30). Valinomycin has been used to dissipate the membrane potential in COV due to valinomycin's selectivity for potassium over other monovalent ions and also its ability to carry ions across a phospholipid bilayer by the mobile carrier mechanism. . COV (+TX) were assayed for proton translocating activity at various concentrations of gramicidin. The apparent H+/e-ratios (0) and the corresponding alkalinization rates (a) were determined at two enzyme turnovers. These data represent three individual preparations of COV (+TX) and the number of determinations was from 4 to 12 for all gramicidin concentrations tested.",

Gramicidin does not share the same mechanism of interaction with COX as valinomycin as evidenced by the lack of a change in the enzyme's visible absorbance spectrum upon the addition of gramicidin. Although the apparent H+/e-ratio is the same for both ionophores, the rate of alkalinization in the proton-pumping assay (Fig. 3) is faster for gramicidin than for valinomycin, suggesting that the mechanism of dissipation of the membrane potential by the two ionophores is different. Additional evidence for different mechanisms of action is that the concentration dependencies for the maximum stimulation of electron transfer activity and the respiratory control activities by the two ionophores are different (Fig. 2) . Interestingly, the addition of high concentrations of gramicidin (5 pM) leads to complete abolition of proton translocating activity with an accompanying increase in the rate of alkalinization, suggesting that at high concentrations, gramicidin acts as proton ionophore (see below).",

The ion selectivity of gramicidin channels is H+ > NH: > Cs+ > Rb' > K+ > Naf > Li' as determined at 0.1 M concentrations using black lipid membranes (32, 33). Using the ion permeabilities derived from these experiments, protons are from 20-to 50-fold more permeable than potassium ions in the gramicidin channel. In liposomes, Deamer (34) estimated that the gramicidin channel is loo-fold more permeable to protons than to potassium ions and when unit permeability coefficients were calculated, protons were found to be 50,000 more permeable than potassium ions. It is unlikely that protons are dissipating the membrane potential in our experiments because we observe similar values of the apparent H+/e-ratio in COV treated with either gramicidin or valinomycin. In addition, the proton translocating activity of COV is not observed in the presence of proton-specific ionophores, such as CCCP (35). However, it is more likely that potassium ions not protons are dissipating the membrane potential due to the 1 X lo6 molar excess of potassium (0.1 M) over protons (10m7 M) under the conditions of our proton translocation assay. Therefore, it is highly unlikely that gramicidin (at low concentrations)",

Under these conditions, there are from 0.5-2.5 gramicidin monomers per phospholipid vesicle (250 A diameter, based on intravesicular volume measurements). Thus, the number of gramicidin molecules per COV approximates the required dimeric species for the ion-conducting channel form of gramicidin (18). In our experiments, gramicidin is added only from the extravesicular medium, suggesting that the antiparallel dimers of gramicidin which exist in aqueous solution partition into the phospholipid bilayer and reorient into the active, ,&helical, dimeric form of gramicidin (17). Also, recent evidence shows that the conformation and oligomeric state of gramicidin are dependent on the carrier solvent of the ionophore (36). In our experiments, the solvent is methanol and gramicidin is a monomer, which can easily undergo a conformational change into the active, ion translocating P-helical conformer (36). Other recent data suggest that addition of gramicidin from one side of a bilayer results in some of the gramicidin monomers forming ion-conducting channels (37, 38) . In any event, the previous work with mitochondria suggests that effects of gramicidin occur by addition of the ionophore from only the external media (ll), supporting our results in COV.",

While our experiments cannot completely exclude this explanation, we think it is unlikely for the following reasons: (i) 40-to 70-fold less gramicidin is required to stimulate electron transfer and proton translocation than valinomycin. Proton transloeating activity is observed at 0.5-2.5 gramicidin monomers/COV, suggesting that the dimeric ion translocating unit of gramicidin is required for membrane potential dissipation in our experiments. If gramicidin does indeed bind to COX, the binding site (for a gramicidin dimer) or sites (two binding sites, one for each monomer) would have a much higher affinity than the putative valino-mycin-binding site on COX due to their vastly different concentration dependencies on electron transfer and proton translocating activities of the enzyme. We have been unable to observe any significant effects of gramicidin on the heme aa3 absorbance spectrum or the maximum rate of electron transfer even at the highest gramicidin/PL ratios (20% or less inhibition of electron transfer), suggesting that the previously described dimeric gramicidin channel is most likely the functioning species in our experiments (18); (ii) Nonactin and valinomycin require the presence of K+ ions to cause the spectral perturbation in heme aa in the enzyme, whereas ionophores such as nigericin and 18-crown-6 ether with K+ have no effect on the absorbance spectrum of the enzyme, suggesting that not all ionophores have the ability to bind to COX (12).
