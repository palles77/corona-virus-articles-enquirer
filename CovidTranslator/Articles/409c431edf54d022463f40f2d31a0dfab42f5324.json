Search Query performs well in forecasting the epidemics. It is still a question whether search engine data can forecast the drift and the inflexion in 2019-nCov pneumonia. Based on the Baidu Search Index, we propose three prediction models: composite Index, composite Index with filtering and suspected NCP(Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia). The result demonstrates that the predictive model of composite index with filtering performs the best while the model of suspected NCP has the highest forecast error. We further predict the out-of-the-set NCP confirmed cases and monitor that the next peak of new diagnoses will occur on February 16 th and 17 th .",

China's provinces have successively activated first-level public health emergency response since January 24. On the one hand, researchers are actively exploring effective treatment against 2019-nCov; on the other hand, they are discussing how to predict the development trend of the novel pneumonia in the future and the turning point. Existing predictions of epidemic transmitted diseases can be roughly divided into: Prediction by search engine [2] [3] , SNS (social networking services) [4] [5] and the data of disease prevention and control center [6] and sentinel hospitals. Because of its abundant data and its characteristics of strong periodicity and seasonal outbreaks, most of the existing studies are aimed at the predication of influenza outbreaks, which are divided into two categories: (1) nowcasting. GFT is the most representative and widely used predictive model. This model uses a range of flu keywords in Google's search engine, and the system will automatically track and analyze the flu as long as the users enter those keywords [7] . (2) forecasting. This kind of study focuses on exploring effective epidemic predictive model [8] for the purpose of early warning of epidemic. Yang et al. [9] put forward ARGO (Auto Regression with Google search data) which uses the autoregressive and self-adjusting of GFT series to improve the prediction accuracy, and found that the prediction error is nearly three times lower than that of GFT. When the model was used to predict flu in eight Latin American countries, the accuracy of flu prediction in six of them was higher than that in time series autoregressive model and was significantly higher than that in GFT [10] . Liu, K., Srinivasan, R., & Meyers, L. A. [11] built an early flu monitoring model based network data. This model predicts seasonal flu 16.4 weeks earlier than CDC and 5 weeks earlier than Pervaiz et al [12] using Google data. In out of sample test, it was not effective in predicting 2009HINI, mainly because 2009HINI is earlier and more transmissible than seasonal flu.",

It is a newfound airborne new virus, with no prior data, no obvious periodicity characteristics and limited data accumulation. How can we predict this disease in this case? SARS-Cov and MERS-Cov also have these predictive characteristics. In 2004, after the outbreak of SARS-Cov in China, some scholars used Gene Expression Programming (GEP) to establish the automatic Mathematical Modeling of the spread and trend of SARS in China. By simulating the epidemic in Beijing and Shanxi, it was found that the success rate of this method was 97% [13] . During the outbreak of H5N1flu in Egypt, the prediction effect and accuracy of Random Forest Model have obvious advantages over ARIMA model [14] . When the MERS-Cov propagation prediction model was established, Bayesian Belief Network was used to establish the risk assessment based on the region. The simulation of 200,000 users shows that the model gives high prediction accuracy of the region and category risk [15] . When monitoring the outbreak of H7N9 AIV in China from 2013-2017 by using weekly data of Baidu Index and Microblog Index, it was found that Baidu Index and Microblog Index always exist in a positive correlation for a certain lead time with confirmed cases during the outbreak of flu [16] , which confirms the possibility of network can predict similar temporary epidemic transmitted diseases. Recently, many researches focus on the estimation of 2019-nCov by the transmission model [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] . By estimating the basic reproductive number 0 R to release the spread of the coronavirus during the epidemic progresses. All the models have to estimate with much assumptions and the forecasting accuracy are limited. Search data can successfully predict periodicity flu outbreaks. Can novel coronavirus pneumonia in China be predicted? Can the next diffusion turning point and outbreak peak be found? These both are problems to be solved urgently.",

By considering that this disease has a long incubation period and the symptoms of this disease are relatively defined in the clinical cases so far, it indicated that the fever accounted for 87.9% and cough accounted for 67.7% of the confirmed cases [25] . Starting with the most common \"fever\" and \"cough\", this paper uses the demand map in Baidu search to select the relevant search terms that users demand the most in the change of search behavior before and after search terms. In addition, with the increasing understanding of the disease, the common search terms for the disease \"the novel coronavirus pneumonia\" and \"Wuhan pneumonia\" were added, and the search volume of the rest of common search terms almost coincides with the outbreak of the epidemic, which could be initially judged as the event-based search noise and could not be used as the search term for the outbreak prediction. After screening the search terms, and removing the unrecorded terms, this paper retains 16 search terms in total. Using Pearson Correlation Coefficient Method, the most commonly used in network data prediction, confirms the correlation and the lead time between search terms and new confirmed sequence. By calculating the correlation coefficient of each word from lead 16 periods to 0 period and new confirmed cases, it is founded that all search terms have a high linear dependence with the new confirmed sequence, which shows that the selected search terms have good prediction ability. Most of the search terms are 10 days earlier than the new confirmed sequence while new suspected sequence is 4 earlier than new confirmed sequence (correlation coefficient is 0.8914). Table 1 shows the maximum correlation coefficient between search terms and new confirmed sequence. x is the search volume for each sequence. Recalculating the correlation coefficient after combination, it is found that the highest correlation coefficient is lead new confirmed 10 times, 0.9248.

The suspected cases include people who are actually infected with the virus but cannot be detected temporarily because of current medicine, and have a strong correlation and explanation with the number of the future confirmed cases. First, the sequence was tested for ADF and the results show that all the original sequences were not steady, but there is no unit root in the first difference sequence at 5% significance level. First difference sequence is a stationary sequence, so Granger Non-Causal Test and ARMAX model can be supported. From the above model fitting results, it can be seen that the prediction model based on filtering noise reduction has the best fitting effect among the three prediction model, followed by the prediction model based on search composite index.

It can be seen from prediction value that the prediction value of search composite index at every turning point is overestimated or underestimated but the prediction accuracy of the short-term fluctuation is high.

It embodies the apriority of the index. The index has been declining thereafter but met another search peak on February 6 and 7 respectively. It means the new confirmed cases of 2019-nCov in the coming period would also meet a small peak after continuous decline.

To be specific, the former two prediction models can be used to predict the new confirmed persons in the coming ten days while the third model can be used to predict the new confirmed persons in the coming 4 days. It can be concluded from the model prediction effect that search composite index based on filtering and noise reduction has the highest prediction accuracy for new confirmed persons but it is not sensitive to short-term fluctuation; the prediction accuracy based on search composite index is sensitive to prediction of peak and valley although its prediction error is larger than Model (2) . Prediction accuracy based on new suspected cases is the worst. Therefore, Model (2) can be used to predict the epidemic change trend in the future and can also be used to monitor short-term epidemic fluctuation by working together with Model (1). By further predicting the new confirmed cases in the coming ten days beyond the prediction period at last, this paper predicts that the new confirmed cases of 2019-nCov will meet a small peak on February 16 and 17 respectively, after which, it will decline in an oscillated manner.",
