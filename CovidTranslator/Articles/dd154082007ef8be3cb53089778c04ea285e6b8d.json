The frequency of respiratory tract and bloodstream infections was highest in children without malaria parasites and decreased with increasing parasite counts. In contrast, higher parasite counts were detected in children without nonmalarial comorbidity. This mutual exclusion of high parasitemia and other fever causes might be due to a selection bias (Berkson bias) where, within clinical settings, children with a severe nonmalarial disease (eg, bloodstream infection, pneumonia) have a reduced likelihood of another severe concomitant febrile infection being the reason for their fever symptoms and hence the hospital admission [23] . As outlined above, 11% of patients without parasitemia had a bacterial bloodstream infection, while this was only diagnosed in 1% of patients with a parasite count >10 000/\u00b5L. Therefore, the determination of the patients' parasite densities is essential for the recognition of a nonmalarial disease in healthcare facilities within malaria-holoendemic areas. This information, however, is not provided by the immunochromatographic rapid test available today but rather by gold-standard malaria microscopy if performed by well-trained staff. For now, in-depth investigations for other pathogens should be initiated in case of discrepancies between disease severity and parasite count. Nevertheless, it has to be emphasized that all critically ill children with parasitemia must receive immediate antimalarial treatment, regardless of parasite counts.",

In the present study, 15% of healthy but parasitemic children had a parasite count >10 000/\u00b5L, demonstrating that a parasite density cutoff has a weak specificity and should be adapted to the purpose (eg, patient management or clinical trial case definition). Furthermore, local malaria endemicity and age distribution has to be taken into account when deciding on a diagnostic parasite density cutoff. The crucial factor is the likelihood of asymptomatic parasitemia that is dependent on the grade of semi-immunity in a specific population [8] . Consequently, local endemicity is an essential information for the malaria diagnosis and should be thoroughly assessed. Acute lower respiratory tract infections were one of the most common reasons for hospitalization in the study area, which has also been reported for children <5 years worldwide [19] . The bacterium Streptococcus pneumoniae was diagnosed in half of the children with LRTI despite the introduction of a pneumococcal vaccine in 2012 in Ghana. Although the pathogen may colonize the respiratory tract as a commensal, its presence as a risk factor for severe disease in viral coinfections has been demonstrated before [25] .",
