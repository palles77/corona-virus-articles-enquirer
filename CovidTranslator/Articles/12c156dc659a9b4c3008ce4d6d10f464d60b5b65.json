An approach requiring fewer assumptions has been proposed by Wallinga and Teunis (2) , in which the distribution of the generation interval of the disease and the epidemic curve are directly analyzed and suffice to provide estimates. For an ongoing epidemic, this method could be used to estimate the number of secondary cases infected by a primary case-patient, but only for periods from which all secondary cases would have been detected. For severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), the required lag would be on the order of 15 days (95th percentile of the distribution of the generation interval described by Lipsitch et al.) (3) .",

The list of communicable diseases that could be monitored is therefore relatively large, although it does not include diseases such as influenza, for which the proportion of asymptomatic or unreported cases may be large. In practice, the delay until estimates of the reproduction number become reliable will depend critically on the generation interval distribution. For SARS, when the reproduction number was constant over time, our realtime estimates were almost unbiased after only 1 day. With the original estimator of Wallinga and Teunis (2), which is not intended for real-time estimation, downward bias would be a concern for at least 2 weeks after observation. However, real-time estimates obtained for recent days displayed wide 95% credible intervals and zero-width intervals when no cases had been observed or reported for a few days. Here, owing to the relatively short generation interval of SARS (mean 8.4 days) (3), reliable estimates were obtained after only 5 days, albeit with wide credible intervals, and they were consolidated after 10 days.

We assumed that the distribution of the generation interval was known and remained unchanged during the course of the outbreak. In practice, however, this distribution is derived from a subset of traced cases. If the subset is small, e.g., the case at the beginning of an emerging disease outbreak, uncertainty will be large. Furthermore, the generation interval may decrease during the course of the outbreak because of quicker interventions, leading to possible bias in the estimates of R (2). Further developments of the method could take these issues into consideration. For example, one could use information on traced cases as it accrues to sequentially estimate the generation interval.
