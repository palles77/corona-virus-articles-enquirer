The aim was to explore different levels of exposure predicted by the new model and the well-mixed model. Aerosols are initially uniformly distributed in one zone and subsequently transported and dispersed to an adjacent zone through an opening. Owing to the significant difference in the rates of transport and dispersion between aerosols and gases, inferred from the results, the wellmixed model tends to overpredict the concentration in the source zone, and under-predict the concentration in the exposed zone. The results are very useful to illustrate that the well-mixed assumption must be applied cautiously for exposure assessments as such an ideal condition may not be applied for coarse particles. r",

Unlike gases, particles usually cannot be assumed as passive contaminants, i.e. assumed to follow the airflow movement identically under the influence of advection and diffusion, due to some inherent properties of particles (Chang et al., 2006) . Particle mass and deposition are among the most important characteristics that distinguish particles from gases and both of the two parameters become increasingly dominant as particle size increases. There are various factors influencing the distribution and deposition of indoor particles. The ventilation system determines airflow patterns in buildings, but it is not the sole factor affecting aerosol transport. A recent study also shows that 3 mm particle concentration in a chamber exhibits inhomogeneity that can be attributed to turbulent diffusion (Richmond-Bryant et al., 2006) . The present authors also show that compared to the submicron droplets, 10 mm expiratory droplets exhibit different dispersion and transport characteristics under a displacement ventilation scheme (Lai and Cheng, 2007) . Hence, to gain more knowledge on the distribution of particles, and exposure or intake dose, it is crucial to consider the influence of aerosol size.",

In this work it was measured by a nonintrusive optical technique, phase Doppler Anemometry. It is based on light-scattering interferometry and therefore requires no calibration. Since no sampling tube is inserted into the chamber, the particle movement will not be affected and more accurate concentration data can be obtained.",

It is understood that the Reynolds number, based on the inlet conditions, is quite low (Re \u00bc 600), it is the Reynolds number used as a scaling criterion (Posner et al., 2003) . Since the key objective of this paper is to validate and apply the drift-flux model, the airflow parameters we selected are not critical. A small chamber with the same dimensions was fabricated. The thickness of the partition wall was ignored in the simulation. The room air was clean at the beginning and particles were supplied at a constant rate with the incoming air. The steady-state airflow characteristics and particle concentration were measured by a phase Doppler Anemometer (Dantec, Denmark). Olive oil droplets generated by an ultrasonic nebulizer (EU-12, Omron, Japan) were used for velocity measurement. For concentration measurement, solid particles were injected with a solid particle disperser (RBG-1000, Palas, Germany), which is able to maintain a stable particle feed rate over a long time period. The concentration of silver-coated hollow glass sphere particles (Dantec) with a nominal diameter of 10 mm was measured by the PDA. A particle passing through the sample volume scatters light that exhibits an angular and temporal intensity distribution characteristic of the particle size and velocity. Particle size and velocity can be determined by analyzing the scattering light with a signal processor. The sample volume has a nominal diameter o100 mm and, therefore, the PDA system is able to achieve point and non-intrusive measurement. The particle number concentration is a derived, not a directly measured, quantity in a PDA measurement. Particle concentration was evaluated with the transit-time-based algorithm as discussed by Hardalupas and Taylor (1989) . In order to measure steady-state particle concentration, the fan and particle disperser were switched on for at least 15 min before data acquisition. Each test was conducted three times to give the averaged result. Fig. 2 shows the velocity field along the center plane. The incoming airflow is blocked by the partition wall and the velocity is very low in the upper part of second zone. Comparisons between the measured and predicted x-direction velocity and particle concentration are shown in Figs. 3 and 4. Simulation predictions show the same general trends as experimental data and the agreement is quite good, except at points near the floor, where measured velocities are virtually zero. The overall trends of the measured particle concentrations agree with those predicted by the numerical model. Few particles were detected in the second zone of the two-zone chamber. It means that the concentration is nearly zero at these points.",

Here we examine a more realistic two-zone scenario where particles are initially released in one zone and subsequently transported to the other zone. Particles are transported to the exposed zone (zone 2) by advection and diffusion processes. Concentrations in zones 1 and 2 are simulated. Both 0.225 and 0.45 m s \u00c01 inlet velocities have been simulated and similar results are observed, so all the results below are based on an inlet velocity of 0.225 m s \u00c01 . The particles were assumed to be initially uniformly distributed in zone 1 and the particle concentration is normalized by the initial concentration. Therefore, at t \u00bc 0, concentrations in zones 1 and 2 are C 1 + \u00bc 1 and C 2 + \u00bc 0. the figures, at t \u00bc 60 s, the concentration in the upper part of zone 2 is almost zero for all of the three particle sizes. However, as concentration in zone 1 deceases to a certain level, the particle concentration in the lower part of zone 2 is diluted by the incoming flow from zone 1. The concentration in the lower part is less than in the upper part. For 0.1 mm particles, it can be observed that at 300 s the concentrations, from the floor up to the height of the opening, are fairly uniform. Another important observation is that the concentration of large particles is lower than that of small particles due to gravitational settling. For example, the 10 mm particle concentration level decreases rapidly with time, and at 180 s, the particle concentrations are close to zero.",

The concentration level in zone 1 decreases exponentially. At this sampling point (breathing height), the well-mixed model predicts a slower decrease compared to the drift-flux model. Besides the advection process, the overall particle decay rate is augmented by the low vertical mixing rate. It is shown in Fig. 5(a) -(c) that the upward dispersion rate is low and hence at the breathing height, the concentration is low. For the well-mixed model, the concentration in the entire zone is always uniform. For zone 2, the concentration profile at the breathing height increases to reach a peak and then starts to decay. particle sizes shown here, there is a very low concentration during the first 60 s at the breathing height. This differs significantly from the well-mixed model prediction. The lag time to reach the peak concentration also varies notably between the two models, 180-240 s for the drift-flux model and 60-180 s for the well-mixed analytical model. The peak concentration levels predicted by the drift-flux simulation are always less than those predicted by the well-mixed model. In summary, due to the underlying homogeneous assumption, the wellmixed model underestimates the breathing height concentration in zone 1 and, more significantly, it severely overestimates the concentration in zone 2 for 0-120 s. The decay rates predicted by the both models also differ. Particles may be trapped in stagnant regions and cannot be removed instantly, so a smaller decay rate is thus predicted. The well-mixed model cannot account for this stagnation phenomenon. One crucial parameter for IAQ assessment is the exposure (or dose). We present the normalized accumulated exposure \u00f0 R T 0 C \u00fe dt\u00de versus time for the first 6 min. The accumulated exposures (Figs. 6(b) and 7(b)) are calculated based on numerical integration of the corresponding concentration profiles as shown in Figs. 6(a) and 7(a).",

As expected, the well-mixed model always predicts a lower exposure as compared to the current simulation. Exposure in zone 2 shows very different trend. The initial simulation exposure is low, but the trend is increasing with time. For all particle sizes presented, the predictions by the wellmixed model are always higher than those predicted by the drift-flux simulation. This can be explained by the trend observed in Figs. 6(b) and 7(b) in which the exposure predicted by simulation is always higher. By conservation of mass, the accumulated exposure in zone 2 must show the opposite trend as observed in Figs. 6(a) and 7(a).

The validity of using a single-point concentration as a surrogate for the entire zone has been discussed by Klepeis (1999) .

Good agreement between the numerical model and the experiment demonstrates that the drift-flux model can be used to predict aerosol deposition and transport in ventilated multi-zone rooms. With the same ventilation rate, the distributions of particles in the two zones are significantly different. Gravity plays a dominant role in the transport of supermicron particles and large supermicron particles which deposit significantly faster than smaller particles. The current drift-flux model predicts that particles are not uniformly distributed in either zone. A well-mixed model based on the mass balance equation was also used to evaluate the profiles of concentration and exposure for the twozone environment. The well-mixed assumption does not always hold, particularly for supermicron particles.
