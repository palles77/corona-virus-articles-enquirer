Non-vaccinated mice were infected with 10 6 PFU of RSV A2 only (No Vac). After RSV challenge, lungs were obtained daily for 4 days. To investigate CD4 and CD8 T cells subsets, cells obtained from lungs were stained with fluorescence antibodies as presented in the Methods and analyzed by flow cytometry.
