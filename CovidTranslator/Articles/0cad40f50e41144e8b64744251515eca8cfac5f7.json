We use the observed data reported in CCDC's paper to estimate distribution of the generation interval of the infection and apply the simulation results from the time delay dynamic system as well as released data from CCDC to fit the growth rate. The conclusion is: Based our Fudan-CCDC model, the growth rate r of COVID-19 is almost in [0.30, 0.32] which is larger than the growth rate 0.1 estimated by CCDC [9], and the reproductive number R 0 of COVID-19 is estimated by 3.25 \u2264 R 0 \u2264 3.4 if we simply use R = 1 + r * T c with T c = 7.5, which is bigger than that of SARS.

In math, we can easily generalize the model by random terms such as Brownian motion in the system, meanwhile the parameters have to be obtained from the real data. The another important version is to consider the interactions of two or more regions, Jin's group have developed some models based on TTD-NCP model [3, 7] . These models will also be developed in need of disease control and prevention. The simulation is implemented via Matlab with some additional constraints imposed. Here the results are summarized in Table 1 with the real data employed up to Feb 16, 2020. In the Table 1 , we use two kind of quarantine strategies introduced below. We are surprised that our code can get uniform estimators on the growth rate r and the reproductive number R 0 .
