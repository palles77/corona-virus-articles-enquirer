            "text": "24 The protozoan parasite Leishmania donovani (L. donovani) causes visceral leishmaniasis, a 25 chronic infection which is fatal when untreated. While previous studies showed that L. donovani 26 reprograms transcription to subvert host cell functions, it remains unclear whether the parasite 27 also alters host mRNA translation to establish a successful infection. To assess this, we 28 compared transcriptome-wide translation in primary mouse macrophages infected with L. 29 donovani promastigotes or amastigotes using polysome-profiling. This identified ample selective 30 changes in translation (3,127 transcripts) which were predicted to target central cellular functions 31 by inducing synthesis of proteins related to chromatin remodeling and RNA metabolism while 32 inhibiting those related to intracellular trafficking and antigen presentation. Parallel 33 quantification of protein and mRNA levels for a set of transcripts whose translation was 34 activated upon L. donovani infection (Papbpc1, Eif2ak2, and Tgfb) confirmed, as indicated by 35 polysome-profiling, increased protein levels despite largely unaltered mRNA levels. Mechanistic 36 in silico analyses suggested activated translation depending on the kinase mTOR (e.g. Pabpc1) 37 and the RNA helicase eIF4A (e.g. Tgfb) during infection. Accordingly, treatment with mTOR 38 inhibitors torin-1 or rapamycin reversed L. donovani-induced PABPC1 without affecting 39 corresponding transcript levels. Similarly, the production of TGF-\u03b2 decreased in presence of the 40 eIF4A inhibitor silvestrol despite unaltered Tgfb mRNA levels. Consistent with parasite 41 modulation of host eIF4A-sensitive translation to promote infection, silvestrol suppressed L. 42 donovani replication within macrophages. In contrast, parasite survival was favored under 43 mTOR inhibition. In summary, infection-associated changes in translation of mTOR-and eIF4A-44 sensitive mRNAs contribute to modulate mRNA metabolism and immune responses in L. 45 donovani-infected macrophages. Although the net outcome of such translation programs favours . CC-BY 4.0 : bioRxiv preprint 4 48 Author Summary 49 Fine-tuning the efficiency of mRNA translation into proteins allows cells to tailor their responses 50 to stress without the need for synthesizing new mRNA molecules. It is well established that the 51 protozoan parasite Leishmania donovani alters transcription of specific genes to subvert host cell 52 functions. However, discrepancies between transcriptomic and proteomic data suggest that post-53 transcriptional regulatory mechanisms also contribute to modulate host gene expression 54 programs during L. donovani infection. Herein, we report that one third of protein-coding 55 mRNAs expressed in macrophages are differentially translated upon infection with L. donovani. 56 Our computational analyses reveal that subsets of mRNAs encoding functionally related proteins 57 share the same directionality of translational regulation, which is likely to impact metabolic and 58 microbicidal activity of infected cells. We also show that upregulated translation of transcripts 59 that encode central regulators of mRNA metabolism and inflammation is sensitive to the 60 activation of mTOR or eIF4A during infection. Finally, we observe that inhibition of eIF4A 61 activity reduces parasite survival within macrophages while selective blockade of mTOR has the 62 opposite effect. Thus, our study points to a dual role for translational control of host gene 63 expression during L. donovani infection and suggests that novel regulatory nodes could be 64 targeted for therapeutic intervention. : bioRxiv preprint 5 65 66 Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is a vector-borne infection caused by protozoan parasites of the 67 Leishmania donovani (L. donovani) complex. VL is endemic in more than 60 countries and is 68 frequently lethal if untreated (1). The lack of efficient vaccines and the failure to control 69 emerging parasite resistance reflect the urgent need to design safe and efficient therapeutics 70 targeting host-encoded factors (2). In mammalian hosts, Leishmania promastigotes preferentially 71 colonize macrophages, where they transform into replicative amastigotes that proliferate within 72 modified phagolysosomes (1). To establish a successful infection, the parasite dampens 73 antimicrobial responses, alters vesicle trafficking, and subverts immunomodulatory functions 74 and metabolic processes of the host cell (3). 75 76 At the molecular level, L. donovani modulates the activity of multiple host cell signaling 77 pathways and transcription factors (3). Consistently, profiling of mRNA levels in L. donovani-78 infected macrophages revealed vast perturbation in host gene expression programs associated 79 with parasite persistence (4-8). The pioneering data supporting widespread changes in host cell 80 mRNA levels following L. donovani infection were obtained in bone marrow-derived 81 macrophages (BMDMs) using cDNA-microarrays (4). This study showed that L. donovani 82 axenic amastigotes downregulate expression of genes involved in apoptosis and NF-\u03baB signaling 83 while stimulating those encoding monocyte chemoattractants. Subsequently, DNA-microarray 84 based studies of human and mouse monocyte-derived macrophages infected with L. donovani 85 promastigotes identified increased levels of transcripts related to cell migration and repression of 86 genes encoding MHC class II molecules (5, 6). More recently, RNA sequencing (RNAseq) of 87 mouse peritoneal macrophages infected with L. donovani showed a strong suppression of genes . CC-BY 4.0",

Interestingly, 143 a large subset of transcripts whose abundance changed upon infection with L. donovani 144 amastigotes or promastigotes was buffered at the level of translation (21% out of 1,051 and 29% 145 out of 1,604 mRNAs, respectively) (Fig 1D and S1 Table) . In contrast, only a small number of 146 transcripts (71 mRNAs) whose levels differed between L. donovani promastigote-and 147 amastigote-infected BMDMs (S1B-C Figs) were translationally buffered. These data indicate (Fig 2A and S2 Table) . Enriched categories, among 157 proteins encoded by translationally activated transcripts in BMDMs infected by either parasite 158 life stage, included chromatin remodeling, regulation of mRNA metabolism (i.e. splicing, export 159 from the nucleus, stability and translation), regulation of type I IFN production and protein 160 deubiquitination (Fig 2A, 228 Translation of eIF4A-sensitive mRNAs is activated upon L. donovani infection 229 As mentioned above, the RNA helicase eIF4A facilitates translation of transcripts harboring long 230 and highly structured 5' UTR sequences. Some such encoded proteins are involved in tumor 231 immune evasion (36) and progression of viral (37) and protozoan parasitic infections (12), 232 suggesting that eIF4A-dependent translation may contribute to herein observed changes in 233 translational efficiencies (Fig 1) .

Consistent with eIF4B-235 dependent modulation of eIF4A activity, levels of phosphorylated and total eIF4B protein were 236 increased in BMDMs infected with L. donovani amastigotes or promastigotes (Fig 5A) . To test 237 whether this may contribute to selective regulation of mRNA translation following parasite 238 infection, we assessed translational efficiencies of a compilation of previously described eIF4A-239 sensitive transcripts (36, 38-40). Indeed, following infection independently of parasite stage, the 240 translational efficiencies of such mRNAs were elevated as compared to background transcripts 241 (p <0.001) (Fig 5B) . From a total of 1198 previously described eIF4A-sensitive mRNAs, 149 242 were translationally activated whereas 80 were translationally suppressed upon infection with 243 promastigotes or amastigotes of L. donovani (S3B Table) . The presence of a 5' UTR G-244 quadruplex-forming guanine quartet (CGG) 4 motif is an indirect approach to assess whether 245 transcripts are expected to be more dependent of eIF4A for their translation (41). Indeed, 246 analysis of Motif Enrichment (AME) revealed a significant enrichment of the (CGG) 4 motif in 5' 247 UTRs of transcripts with highly activated translation (\u22654-fold increase in translational efficiency 248 upon infection) as compared to 5' UTRs from transcripts with unaltered translational efficiency 249 (p = 0.0036) (Fig 5C) . TGF-\u03b2 is a key cytokine implicated in the distinctive immune suppression 250 that follows L. donovani infection in vivo (42, 43) . Upon infection with L. donovani amastigotes 251 or promastigotes, anota2seq analysis identified augmented translational efficiency of the tumor 252 growth factor-\u03b2 1 (Tgfb1) mRNA (Fig. 2B , top-right panel and S1 Table) , which is highly 253 dependent of eIF4A for its translation (39). Accordingly, production of TGF-\u03b2 increased in 254 BMDMs upon infection (Fig 5D) without changes in Tgfb1 mRNA abundance (Fig 5E) .",

Thus, these data indicate that, in addition to mTOR-dependent translation, L. donovani 259 infection also bolsters eIF4A-sensitive translation of selected host cell transcripts, including the 260 one encoding the immunomodulatory cytokine TGF-\u03b2. 261 262 L. donovani survival within macrophages is differentially modulated through mTOR and 263 eIF4A activity. 264 During the course of infectious diseases, translational control acts as a host defense mechanism 265 but can also be exploited by the invading pathogen as a survival strategy (44). In regard to 266 infections caused by protozoan parasites, augmented mTOR-sensitive translation was associated 267 with parasite persistence during Toxoplasma gondii infection in macrophages (45) whereas 268 eIF4A inhibition suppressed progression of cerebral malaria (12). These findings in combination 269 with activation of mTOR-and eIF4A-sensitive translation in BMDMs upon parasite infection 270(Fig 3 and Fig 5, respectively), prompted us to investigate the role of these translational 271 regulators for L. donovani survival within the host cell. To address this, BMDMs were pre-272 treated with either rapamycin or silvestrol and infected with L. donovani promastigotes.",

            "text": "-wide analyses of mRNA translation in infected cells and tissues have revealed 279 profound yet selective perturbation of the host translatome during infections caused by 280 intracellular pathogens, including viruses and the protozoan parasite Toxoplasma gondii (45-47). 281 L. donovani infection causes widespread changes in host gene expression (4-8). Yet, differences 282 between the transcriptome and the proteome of infected cells suggested that post-transcriptional 283 mechanisms may also contribute to establishing the post-infection proteome (9). Herein, using 284 polysome-profiling, we demonstrate early translational reprogramming in macrophages 285 following infection by L. donovani amastigotes and promastigotes. The majority of the changes 286 in the translatome of the host cell were induced in a similar fashion by the two life stages of the 287 parasite, including activation of both mTOR-and eIF4A-sensitive translation programs encoding 288 central regulators of inflammation and mRNA metabolism. Unexpectedly, inhibition of mTOR 289 promoted parasite survival within the host cell whereas inhibition of eIF4A activity had the 290 opposite effect, suggesting that selective modulation of host mRNA translation plays a dual role 291 during L. donovani infection in macrophages. 292 293 Previous high-throughput studies identified numerous biological processes affected in 294 macrophages during L. donovani infection (5, 6, 8, 9). Translational profiling of infected 295 macrophages indicates that in addition to altered mRNA levels, L. donovani selectively adjusts 296 the proteome of the host cell to its own benefit by modulating the translational efficiencies of 297 subsets of mRNAs. In line with dysregulated antigen presentation during L. donovani infection 298 (48), transcripts encoding several MHC class I components were translationally suppressed in L. 299 donovani-infected macrophages. In contrast, translation of mRNAs related to chromatin (i.e. histones and DNA-and histone-modifying enzymes) was augmented in cells 301 infected with L. donovani. This suggests translational control of parasite-directed epigenetic 302 changes known to inhibit innate immune responses of the host cell (49). Supporting this notion, a 303 proteomics study identified several histones and chromatin remodelling proteins induced in 304 macrophages during L. donovani infection which correlated with greater biological processes targeted during VL are related to host mRNA metabolism (i.e. 308 stability, splicing and translation) (9, 50). Consistently, we identified numerous macrophage 309 transcripts encoding translation initiation factors, splicing factors and RBPs with altered 310 translational efficiencies during L. donovani infection. The mouse genome encodes more than a 311 thousand of RBPs (51), including a subset we identified as translationally activated upon L. 312 donovani infection. Regulation of RBPs is of particular interest during VL as they play a central 313 role during immune responses (28). Further investigation is required to assess the impact of 314 translational control of host RBP and mRNA metabolism for the outcome of L. donovani 315 infections. 316 317 Our data showing that mTOR inhibition favors parasite survival within macrophages suggest that 318 mTOR activation is part of a host defense mechanism against L. donovani. Further supporting 319 this notion, phosphorylation of mTOR downstream targets S6K1 and 4E-BP1 occurred early 320 during infection and rapidly decreased thereafter, an event that could be at least in part mediated 321 by host phosphatases known to be activated upon Leishmania spp. infection (3). Upregulation of signaling in L. donovani-infected macrophages was paralleled by a significant increase in 323 translational efficiencies of a large number of mTOR-sensitive transcripts characterized by the 324 presence of a 5' TOP motif. In particular, we showed that PABPC1, an RBP whose encoding 325 mRNA harbors a TOP-motif (15), is induced during infection in an mTOR-dependent fashion. 326 PABPC1 regulates stability and translation of mRNAs (52). Notably, PABPC1 is part of an 327 inhibitory translational complex along with the zing finger protein 36 (Zfp36) that prevents 328 overexpression of pro-inflammatory mediators in activated macrophages (29). Therefore, it is 329 plausible that PABPC1 binds to specific host mRNAs to dampen macrophage inflammatory 330 responses during L. donovani infection. 331 332 In addition to PABPC1, our data indicate that EIF2AK2 is upregulated in L. donovani-infected 333 macrophages through mTOR-dependent mechanisms. Given that L. donovani triggers TLR 334 signaling in macrophages (35) and that both mTOR signaling and EIF2AK2 expression are 335 augmented in response to TLR stimulation (34, 53), TLR-dependent mTOR activation might 336 account for increased EIF2AK2 synthesis in L. donovani-infected macrophages. Accumulating 337 evidence suggests that the role of EIF2AK2 during Leishmania spp infection varies between 338 parasite species. For example, EIF2AK2 activity is induced during L. amazonensis infection and 339 promotes parasite survival within macrophages through induction of an Nrf2-dependent 340 antioxidant response (30, 54). Conversely, L. major prevents the activation of EIF2AK2 to avoid 341 parasite clearance via EIF2AK2-inducible TNF production (30, 31). We observed that eIF2\u03b1 342 phosphorylation decreases upon infection despite upregulation in EIF2AK2 expression and 343 phosphorylation. This may be explained by the concomitant increase in mTOR activity which 344 can recruit NCK1 to eIF2\uf062 and thereby reduce eIF2\uf061 phosphorylation to bolster ternary complex phosphorylation-status and thereby downstream effects on gene expression and biology. 347 Herein, regardless of the precise mechanism, the increased level of EIF2AK2 does not appear 348 activate the integrated stress response (56). 349 350 Early phosphorylation of eIF4B and enrichment of reported eIF4A-sensitive mRNAs among 351 translationally activated transcripts support that eIF4A also affects the translatome of L. 352 donovani-infected macrophages. Consistently, silvestrol-mediated inhibition of eIF4A dampened 353 L. donovani survival within macrophages while no effect was observed in extracellular parasite 354 viability. The activity of eIF4A facilitates translation of transcripts encoding immune modulators 355 (e.g. CXCL10, IRF1, IRF7, iNOS, STAT3, TGF-\u03b2, etc.) in various cell types (18, 20, 39, 40, 57) 356 including macrophages (12, 22). Similarly, we observed that translation of eIF4A-sensitive 357 transcript Tgfb and subsequent TGF-\u03b2 production were upregulated in L. donovani-infected in 358 macrophages. Of note, TGF-\u03b2 is a cytokine associated with immune suppression and resistance 359 to treatment during human and experimental VL (42, 43). In view of these previous studies and 360 our present findings, it is conceivable that eIF4A-sensitive translation contributes to the immuno-361 pathogenesis of VL. Further characterization of eIF4A translational outputs in L. donovani 362 infected cells and tissues will shed light on this matter. 363 364 The outcome of VL is defined by a complex network of converging molecular events at the 365 interface between the parasite and the host (1). Herein, we have uncovered vast reprogrammed 366 translation of protein-coding mRNAs expressed in macrophages upon infection by L. donovani regulators of mRNA metabolism and inflammation, were found to be under 369 translational control. Notably, our data indicate that some of these changes contribute to parasite 370 clearance whereas others favor parasite persistence within the host cell, hinting at the therapeutic 371 potential of perturbing specific host translation programs to control the infection. media and supplements were purchased from Wisent, Gibco, and Sigma-Aldrich; 375 rapamycin was obtained from LC Laboratories; torin-1 was provided by Cayman; 10-376 phenanthroline monohydrate was acquired from Sigma-Aldrich; silvestrol was 380 L. donovani (LV9 strain) amastigotes were isolated from the spleen of infected female Golden 381 Syrian hamsters (Harlan Laboratories) as previously described (58).

The filtered reads were then aligned to the mouse genome mm10.476 Significant changes in translation, abundance and buffering were identified by anota2seq (23) 477 using default parameters with the following modifications: minSlopeTranslation=-0.5; 478 maxSlopeTranslation=1.5; FDR \u22640.15; apvEff >log 2 (2.0); deltaPT>log 2 (1.25); and 479 deltaP>log 2 (1.5). In anota2seq model one, infections were compared to control (i.e. Ld PRO 480 versus control and Ld AMA versus control); in model two, cells infected by different parasite 481 stages were compared together with a contrast to complete the anota2seq model (i.e. Ld PRO vs 482 Ld AMA and Ld PRO versus control). Identifiers for genes which cannot be distinguished based 483 on their high sequence similarity (also reported by RPKMforgenes.py), were excluded from 484 downstream analyses. For further analysis, we used a published list of TOP-containing mRNAs . CC-BY 4.0 International license author/funder.

The 486 difference in log 2 fold-change of translational efficiency (i.e. apvEff) between the signatures and 487 the background was assessed using Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney tests. 488 489 Gene ontology analyses 490 Gene ontology analyses were performed using the panther tool (25) of the Gene Ontology 491 Consortium (http://geneontology.org/) on the union of transcripts activated or inhibited in 492 BMDMs infected by L. donovani amastigotes or promastigotes. Heatmaps of translational 493 efficiencies of transcripts activated or inhibited in BMDMs infected by L. donovani amastigotes 494 or promastigotes were generated using Morpheus.495 (https://software.broadinstitute.org/morpheus/index.html, Broad Institute) 496 497 RNA sequence motif analyses 498 Non-redundant RefSeq 5' UTRs were retrieved from genome build mm10 using the UCSC Table 499 Browser (https://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgTables). Analysis of Motif Enrichment (AME) was 500 performed on the RefSeq-annotated 5' UTR sequences from transcripts with \u22654-fold increases in 501 TE in L. donovani-infected BMDM (402 5' UTRs) compared to a control list of 228 randomly 502 selected 5' UTRs from the set of non-translationally regulated transcripts. The presence of the 503 previously described guanine quartet (CGG) 4 motif (39) in both lists was scored and a one-tailed 504 Fisher's exact test was performed to determine significance of enrichment.
