            "text": "Tourism can transcend governmental boundaries by bringing people closer together through the understanding of different cultures, heritages, and beliefs. Therefore, it is potentially one of the most important vehicles for promoting peace among the peoples of the world. Although previous South Korean governments have historically proposed a variety of actions to contribute to peace on the Korean Peninsula, there has been little success. However, the Mt. Gumgang tourism development, the hallmark of the Sunshine Policy of former president of South Korea, Dae Jung Kim, is different from previous tourism initiatives as it has had more tangible and practical outcomes that have contributed to the promotion of peace on the divided Peninsula. To this end, the South Korean government has applied the insights of neofunctionalism to the Mt. Gumgang tourism development. This is an approach to integration theory from the perspective of liberalism that has been heralded in international politics. According to this approach, it is expected that the Mt. Gumgang tourism development can be used as a tool to maintain peaceful circumstances, which results in spill-over effects, enlargement of activity scopes, and a heightened level of commitment on the Korean Peninsula. The purpose of this study is to empirically test the hypothesis that the Mt. Gumgang tourism development contributes to the peace of the Korean Peninsula by employing the theory of neofunctionalism. To test this hypothesis, this study proposes a Peace Index and investigates the spill-over effects by utilizing the Mt. Gumgang tourism development as a test case. The results of this study indicate that the view that tourism contributes to peace is valid but tenuous since the impact of the Mt. Gumgang tourism development in the promotion of peace was less significant than expected. Consequently, the results of this study also indicate that neofunctionalism, which has been developed for western political systems, needs to be re-examined when applied to the unique, dynamic, and complex political circumstances on the Korean Peninsula. r",

It is hard to imagine, but this is true in Korea. It is estimated that there are 10 million separated families due to the divisions caused by the Korean War in 1950. Koreans, who have had over 5000 years of a unique national history and a common heritage, have lived under different political systems (South Korean Democracy vs. North Korean Communism) since 1945. However, since it is the supreme goal of the South Korean people, South Korean presidents have historically considered peaceful reunification a central national goal.",

Two distinct views in international politics, realism and liberalism, have influenced conceptual approaches to integration theory that can be defined as the creation of interdependence. Since the 1970s, functionalism, one of the approaches of integration theory proposed by Mitrany (1943) and redefined by Haas (1964) , has been an influential theory in South Korea strategy toward North Korea to attain peace (Hong, 2005a) . This theory has created the expectation of spillover effects such as enlargement of activity scopes and heightened levels of commitment. Lindberg defined the effects as follows: ''in its most general formulation, 'spill-over' refers to a situation in which a given action, related to a specific goal, creates a situation in which the original goal can be assured only by taking further actions, which in turn create a further condition and a need for more action, and so forth'' (Lindberg, 1963, p. 10) .",

Indeed, one of the major accomplishments of the Sunshine Policy has been considered to be the Mt. Gumgang tourism development (Choi, 1999; Hong, 2005a; Sims, 2000) , which has been compared to the ostpolitik of West Germany (Kindermann, 2000) . The idea for the policy comes from an old fable in which the wind (power) and sun (cooperation) compete to make a man take off his jacket. The cold blowing wind only makes the man bundle up tighter while the warm sunshine compels him to take off his jacket of his own volition (Toffler, 1998) . Since South Korea's new President, Moo Hyun Roh, is continuing to pursue the Sunshine Policy, it is thought that the Mt. Gumgang tourism development will continue to play an important role in promoting peaceful circumstances on the Korean Peninsula.",

First, there has been a lack of theoretical underpinning from other fields such as political science to support the role of tourism in the contribution to peace (Richter, 1983) . Second, the role of tourism in the contribution to peace needs to be empirically analyzed more rigorously (Litvin, 1998) . Therefore, the purpose of this study is to empirically test the hypothesis that the Mt. Gumgang tourism development contributes to the peace of the Korean Peninsula by employing the theory of neofunctionalism. Despite the importance of the issue of tourism and peace, no previous studies have attempted to empirically test the hypothesis while also being grounded in appropriate theory. To accomplish this goal, the Mountain Gumgang Peace Index was created and the spill-over effects investigated. It is also hoped that this study will contribute to the literature of tourism by re-examining whether neofunctionalism, which has been developed to describe western integration, is theoretically appropriate to describe the conditions on the Korean Peninsula.",

Realism is more pessimistic and stresses insecurity, force, and survival as the natural relations between states while liberalism is more optimistic and stresses economic interdependence through the development of ties and contracts (Nye, 1993) . Therefore, the potential for peace among states is a liberal ideal. The tourism industry has been seen as playing an integral role in the world's quest for peace. Accordingly, tourism scholars have made efforts to maximize the role of tourism in world peace. The ''International Tourism Passport to Peace'' and ''Peace through Tourism '' were organized, in 1987 and 1990 , respectively. The first global conference, ''Tourism: A Vital Force for Peace'' was organized in 1988 (Khamouna & Zeiger, 1995) . Furthermore, tourism has repeatedly been recognized as a social force that can promote international understanding, cooperation, and global fraternity in promoting world peace (Caneday, 1991; Holland, 1991; Knopf, 1991) .",

The relationship of the USA and the People's Republic of China is a good example of the contribution of tourism to world peace. D'Amore (1988) suggested that the key to a changed political relationship between the USA and the People's Republic of China was opening travel in various forms such as conferences, sports, twinning of cites, and trade. Zhuang (1993) indicated that travel to visit families on the mainland marked the beginning of peopleto-people contact between the two sides (China and Taiwan) after 38 years of separation and hostility. Furthermore, Butler and Mao (1996) , who outlined the six evolutionary processes of travel patterns, suggested that as the frequency of travel increases between countries in dispute such as Korea, conditions are likely to be more conducive to peace. Finally, Anson (1999) explored the role of tourism using the example of the contested heritage of Northern Ireland and its potential contribution to community peace building as the province emerges from 30 years of conflict.",

However, these previous studies empirically analyzed the views, perceptions, or recognition of respondents rather than employing appropriate theories to claim that tourism was a mediator of peace.

Since the Korean Peninsula was divided, South Korea has gradually attempted to reunify the Korean Peninsula by implementing various policies, as shown in Kim (1993-97) continued a similar policy. However, the history of political negotiations seeking the peaceful reunification of the two Koreas has demonstrated that the political efforts of previous governments have not lead to substantive progress toward reunification. Kim and Crompton (1989) suggested that South Korean governments should have understood that tourism can offer a less confrontational way of initiating closer relationships and facilitating formal political negations. There have been tourism initiatives as a supplement to the traditional political mechanisms for facilitating peace and reunification, however, as shown in Table 2 . For example, a comprehensive set of tourism-oriented proposals was made in 1982. Joint management of homeland visits by overseas Koreans permitting them free travel to Korea and an exchange of goodwill visits are examples that were included in the proposals. However, the proposals were rejected by North Korea except for permission for a select number of people to travel to the other side, which was provided by the two Koreas in 1985. However, most of the tourism initiatives of the early 1990s were proposals or plans that were never implemented. In sum, the earlier contacts between the two regimes were arrangements of political expediency and there were no serious commitments to move toward permanent reconciliation. Consequently, the tourism initiatives did not result in great contributions to peace and were far from the desired role of providing leverage for reunification on the Korean Peninsula. ",

Lieber (1972) suggests that there are two different levels at which integration can be considered. One is national and concerns the conditions or process of integration within a single country. The other, with which we are mainly concerned here, is regional and applies to the development of integration between two or more separate countries. Functionalism is one of the approaches of integration theory developed from the political perspective of liberalism (Hong, 2005a) . Functionalists insist that the economic interdependence that liberalism stresses can play an important role in maintaining peaceful circumstances in global society. Furthermore, they insist that economic interdependence should be separated from political relations. Therefore, functionalist theory has viewed depoliticization and a technical treatment of issues as the most promising route to ultimate political integration. The chief exponent of functionalism, Mitrany (1943) , suggests that peaceful change comes not through a shift of national boundaries (politics) but by means of technical cooperation organized around basic functional needs such as transportation, health, cultural activities, and trade taken across them.",

Also central to the work of Haas is the concept of spill-over, or what Mitrany called the ''doctrine of ramification''. Haas suggests that decisions made in organizations at the international level may be integrative, ''Earlier decisions spill-over into a new functional context, involve more and more people, call for more and more interbureaucratic contact and consultations, meeting the new problems which grow out of earlier compromises'' (Haas, 1961, p. 372) .

There are two distinct characteristics concerning the Mt. Gumgang tourism development in terms of market considerations, however. First, the Mt. Gumgang tourism development has required financial assistance from the public sector since the profitability is low from the viewpoint of the private sector due to the nature of business. It is interesting to note that Hyundai Asan Corporation was in poor financial condition in 2002. In exchange for opening parts of the mountain regions to tours from 1998, it had to pay 12 million dollars US per month regardless of the number of tourists. In fact, the deal was not economically feasible and was favorable to North Korea. Although Hyundai Asan Corporation negotiated to reduce the fee down to 100 US dollars per visitor in 2001, it was still not economically feasible. Therefore, the South Korean government decided to subsidize the visitor fee for Hyundai Asan Corporation in 2002.",

Initial research (Kim & Prideaux, 2003) focused on the role of the Mt. Gumgang tourism development as a vehicle for promoting peace. They maintained that the Mt. Gumgang tourism development has had two different sides: a method of reducing political tension or inadvertently becoming a vehicle for inhibiting peace if funds paid to North Korea through the Mt. Gumgang tourism development are used to purchase arms to threaten South Korea. Recently, Kim and Prideaux (2006) investigated South Korean's perceptions of the Mt. Gumgang tourism development and indicated that the respondents perceived that ''there is a role for tourism in developing peaceful relations between hostile nations'' (Kim & Prideaux, 2006, p. 135 ). However, this perception has not been grounded in appropriate theory.",

However, Haas (1964) cautions that we should hesitate to apply the functionalist or neofunctionalist model to areas such as Latin America, the Middle East, and Southeast Asia. Therefore, the neofunctionalist model may not be entirely appropriate on the Korean Peninsula since it was designed to describe more democratic, pluralistic, and industrial settings. In addition, Haas (1964) did not specifically mention the Korean Peninsula for the question of the applicability of neofunctionalism. However, it is important to state that the South Korean government has explicitly applied a neofunctionalist perspective and this will continue to be applied on the Korean Peninsula in pursuing the Mt. Gumgang tourism development (Choi, 1999; Hong, 2005a; Inter-Korean relations, 2003; Sims, 2000) . Furthermore, there is a lack of an alternative theory available to describe the possible outcome of the Mt. Gumgang tourism development. Therefore, neofunctionalism was selected as the appropriate theory for this study.",

Examples of events are the actual launch of the land route to and opening of the North and South national events at Mt. Gumgang. The advantage of using event data is that by isolating specific instances of events, one can examine phenomenon more closely (Fatehi & Gupta, 1992) . Consequently, information on certain patterns of evolution can be gathered through these event data. To achieve this analysis, event data in the context of the Mt. Gumgang tourism development were gathered from Yonhap News, a daily newspaper in South Korea. Yonhap News is the primary source of interaction between North and South Korea since Chosun Central Communications in North Korea agreed to release information on North Korea to Yonhap News Service. For a three-month period under study Lee (2003) found that most daily domestic and major international newspapers referred to information from Yonhap News regarding interaction between North and South Korea. He concluded that Yonhap News was the major information source for interaction between North and South Korea. Table 5 shows the number of events in relation to the Mt. Gumgang tourism development. The number of events has gradually increased from 1998 to 2003 (the data collection period) as indicated in Table 5 .",

Consequently, conflictive events between North and South Korea followed the detention. For example, North Korea refused to discuss the security issue of tourists visiting Mt. Gumgang and did not allow a South Korean baseball team to visit Pyongyang, the capital of North Korea. This is similar to the case of the People's Republic of China and Taiwan.

The highlighted events motivated the following events related to the Mt. Gumgang tourism development. In fact, the events showing the most initiative were economic relations (type 2) and cultural and scientific relations (type 4). These events were then expanded into the physical environment and natural resource relations (type 5) and human environmental, demographic, and ethnic affairs (type 6). However, these events did not expand into symbolic political relations (type 1), military and strategic relations (type 3), and political order, political relations, and law/ organization (type 7). It is interesting to note that the leastfrequent events (types 1, 3, and 7) are those that require high politics. These results found from Tables 9 and 10 suggest that under the progress of the Mt. Gumgang tourism development, integration has not spilled-over from In pursuing a dynamic analysis, the fundamental trends of spill-over can also be identified by level of commitment. Levels of commitment can vary depending on activity authority. Based on Wessels's (1997) activity authority classification, Table 11 shows the frequency of events by activity authority. The collaborative activities were classified into agreement, meetings, and celebrations in descending order in terms of binding force. Examples of these classifications are shown in Table 12 . Celebration includes events that were temporary and friendly. Meetings include events that both North and South Korean official representatives met to discuss a particular agenda item but did not result in binding decisions. Finally, agreement includes events where binding decisions are made and tangible outcomes have resulted from the decisions.",

Therefore, it can be concluded that the hypothesis that the Mt. Gumgang tourism development contributes to the peace of the Korean Peninsula is valid although the contribution is not significant. Hyundai Asan Corporation, a private company, is in charge of the Mt. Gumgang tourism development. However, the government of South Korea has started to be officially involved in the Mt. Gumgang tourism development since the government considers it part of a peace business that needs help from the official body to maintain peace in the Korean Peninsula (Cho, 2004) . This fact indicates that it is possible to use tourism as a vehicle to lay the groundwork for a shift from inter-Korean confrontation for reconciliation and peaceful coexistence. However, to attain this goal, it is suggested that both North and South Korea, on the basis of mutual interests, adapt integrative lessons learned in one context to new situations through the Mt. Gumgang tourism development. In this way, cooperation steadily increases and spill-over effects can be realized, resulting in the promotion of peace on the Korean Peninsula. However, the paradigm of neofunctionalism has not been fully applicable in the case of the Mt.

            "text": "There are countries that have partitioned for a variety of reasons, including religious (India and Pakistan), ethnic (Greek and Turkish Cyprus) or political differences (North and South Vietnam or Taiwan and China). Based on the findings of this study, it may be argued that tourism can be considered as a potential activity for influencing political interactions ultimately resulting in a peaceful atmosphere in these countries. Therefore, it is worthwhile to investigate whether tourism has the ability to reduce tension and in turn influence political relations in these countries in the context of the neofunctionalist model.",

            "text": "For future research, it is recommended that the observation period should be long enough to more fully analyze the data. The relatively short history of the Mt. Gumgang tourism development, started in 1998 may bias the conclusions of this study. In addition, a more sophisticated device needs to be developed to collect data. Although Yonhap News is the best data source available, a single source has certain limitations. For example, confidential reports from internal sources such as Hyundai Asan Corporation that may have useful information were not considered in this study. Furthermore, it should be noted that the relationship diagnosis of event consequences needs to be used with caution. It is difficult to clearly determine if there is a cause and effect relationship between the specific events of the Mt. Gumgang tourism develop-ment and if they influenced consequent unrelated events. For example, it is not certain that the revival of the Seoul-Pyongyang soccer game and the co-hosting of the Asian Games in 2014 were attributable to certain actions of the Mt. Gumgang tourism development. The relationship uncertainty of event consequences may also bias the conclusions of this study since this study considered only objective events that were definitely caused by the specific events of the Mt. Gumgang tourism development.",
