Due to this, high expectations for this integration have emerged, but hospital and medical centers interested in adoption of RFID technology require prior knowledge on how to squeeze RFID capabilities, real expectations and current challenges. In this paper, we show our lab tested solutions in two specific healthcare scenarios. On the one hand, we analyze the case of a medical equipment tracking system for healthcare facilities enabling both real-time location and theft prevention. Worth-noting aspects such as possible EMI interferences, technology selection and management of RFID data from hospital information system are analyzed. Lab testing of system reliability based on passive UHF RFID is provided for this case. On the other hand, we analyze and provide a solution for care and control of patients in a hospital based on passive HF RFID with the result of a fully functional demonstrator. Our prototype squeezes RFID features in order to provide a backup data source from patient's wristband. It also provides an offline working mode aiming to increase application reliability under network fail down and therefore, improving patient's safety. Considerations regarding lessons learned and challenges faced are exposed.",

Medical centers have to face continuous losses of high-value assets each year (Bacheldor, 2007) . Furthermore, equipment whereabouts are frequently unknown. Medical staff needs to sacrifice patient-care to find assets locations. Moreover, unneeded equipment is acquired or rented while the existing one remains underutilized. In this paper, our first case study focuses on this particular scenario. Our solution for real-time tracking of medical devices in a healthcare center is presented which consider anti-theft capabilities and partial automatic inventory. Beyond the presentation of our approach, several worth-noting and commonly overlooked aspects in the development of the solution are discussed such as electromagnetic interferences of RFID in medical equipment, RFID branch technology selection and management of the data generated by the RFID infrastructure from the healthcare information system. The real-time tracking solution is based on passive UHF RFID technology, a field where few previous results are available in literature. We measured the performance and reliability of the system in a laboratory experimental environment and the conclusions of our tests are provided.",

But current inpatient care pilots do not make the most out of RFID capabilities.

However, the limited storage resources in staff and patient RFID tags can be exploited as a complementary data source to enhance patient safety and overall system reliability in determined circumstances.

They concluded that HF RFID performs adequately and safely for blood products, RFID has an impact in productivity and quality gains due to less process errors, better inventory management and avoidance of product discards. Moreover, regarding return on investment, authors calculated a pay-back period of four years for a mid-size blood center collecting 225.000 units/year. Further practical implementation in the area includes a pilot in four Italian hospitals where EPC Gen 2 RFID technology has been implemented to track all steps of the transfusion process from taking blood samples to the final blood transfusion. As an output of this practical implementation, human mistakes which could turn into lethal results were dramatically reduced in the processes of drawing donated blood, transporting it and administering it to a patient, reporting an error reduction by 100 percent, as well as work-reduction times.",

Case study 1: tracking of medical devices in a healthcare center One of the main issues which medical centers have to confront is the management of the medical devices, equipment and supplies. Equipment usage patterns are largely unknown. As a consequence, high-value assets remain inadvertently underutilized while unneeded equipment is acquired or rented. Moreover, medical staff cannot readily find available equipment. As a result, personnel need to sacrifice patient-care or lose productive hours searching for the required equipment. Furthermore, hospitals experience alarming losses of assets each year (Tzeng et al., 2008) , approximately 10 percent of the assets are stolen or their whereabouts are unknown (Bacheldor, 2007) . By the introduction of real-time location systems (RTLs) hospitals can enhance these processes. Some hospitals have already reported a remarkable cost reduction in rental fees (Sullivan, 2009 ) and adoption of RTL systems have been reported to produce return of investment in less than a year.",

Also, interferences with pacemakers and ICDs (Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillators) are not feasible according to the emission power used. This includes pacemakers compliant to standard CENELEC EN 45502-2-1 (2003). Anyway, the World Health Organization (OMS, 2004) points that further research on this topic is required. Van der Togt et al. (2008) assessed electromagnetic interference from active 125 kHz and passive 868 MHz RFID inducing incidents in critical care medical equipment. In 123 EMI tests, RFID induced 34 EMI incidents (22 hazardous incidents, two significant incidents and 10 classified as light). These results indicate that implementation of RFID in the critical care environment require on-site EMI tests. Further research is necessary about electromagnetic interferences on medical equipment and devices, as well as the effects of RF energy on the human body. Depending on the specific healthcare application where RFID is implemented, additional research may be required. As an example, RFID tags could be attached to blood products for tracking purposes. However, RF energy could potentially alter blood samples provoking a distortion in test results. In this regard, Davis et al. (2009) have investigate the temperature and in vitro effects of 13,56 MHz radiation on WBDP and RBC products under FDA-approved protocol. Authors concluded that no significant rise in temperature or increase in cellular/protein degradation was caused.",

Due to this, it has already been piloted in healthcare prototypes (Swedberg, 2009c; Sullivan, 2009 ). However, several disadvantages turn this technology branch less appealing. Cost per tag (20$ and up Roberti, 2009 ) and volume are high. The smallest active RFID tag from one of the leading suppliers Savi (2009) has a size of 6.2 cm \u00c2 1.7 cm \u00c2 1.2 cm. These characteristics turn them inappropriate for tagging utensils and small sized devices as desirable in our solution. Tags present a reduced time life due to the use of battery as power source requiring periodic maintenance. Furthermore, active RFID technology is not as mature as passive technology alternatives. Most solutions are based on proprietary protocols with noninteroperable products. The recent ISO 18000-7 standard for 433 MHz active RFID technology has emerged as consequence of the strong investment of U.S. Department of Defense in active technology and heavily relies on intellectual property owned and developed by Savi, the main DoD active technology hardware vendor (RFID Update, 2006) . DASH7 Alliance (2009) has been formed, but the standard does not equate to interoperability yet, as products from different vendors which comply with the standard do not talk each other (Burnell, 2009 ).

Due to the highly restricted hardware resources in these tags, providing an adequate security level is a complex goal and an area where the security research community is focusing efforts (Avoine, 2010) . The medical information system (and the patient itself) may benefit from making the most of the possibilities provided by the RFID technology and, in particular, from being able to store some relevant data on the patient itself for ubiquitous access instead of being limited by the backend servers. However, in designing final system, it has to be carefully and thoroughly considered which data will be included on the RFID, if any, and meticulously analyze if the same benefits could be achieved accessing these data from the backend server instead of making use of the in-situ storage resources. The RFID technology has to provide an adequate level of security, as it should not be a trade-off between patient's health and data privacy. In particular, we do not recommend the use of ISO 15693 tags (i.e. the wristbands models available when our work started) due to the reasons previously exposed. Although wristbands based on the security concerned ISO 14443 standard are available, security can not be taken as granted and well-known standardized algorithms must be used.

An analysis on the suitability of each RFID technology branch for the proposed scenario has been offered. A priori, passive UHF RFID technology presented worthnoting advantages over active RFID. As opposed to scarce previous literature on the topic, our evaluation of technology performance in an experimental setup has exposed a low reading reliability of this RFID technology branch in the proposed environment.
