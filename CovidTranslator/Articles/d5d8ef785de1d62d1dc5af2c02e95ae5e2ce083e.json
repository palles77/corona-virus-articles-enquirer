MERS is associated with mild encephalopathy, an infectious agent, and a distinct reversible lesion in the splenium of the corpus callosum. Our case highlights the key clinical and radiological features of MERS in an adult patient with influenza A infection. Influenza is a common infection that peaks in the winter months in the USA that typically presents with fever, headache, myalgia or cough. MERS is an uncommon but important neurological complication of influenza infection and clinicians caring for adults should be aware of MERS as a distinct clinical entity when pursuing workup of encephalopathy.",

The patient was also taking hydrocortisone for adrenal insufficiency as a result of panhypopituitarism. On presentation, he reported of dilute urine and described his thinking as slowed. Prior to this hospitalisation, he was independently doing activities of daily living, actively employed and also cognitively high functioning. He had not previously received the seasonal influenza vaccination. Review of systems revealed myalgias, hoarse voice, fatigue and a mild non-productive cough of several days duration. On initial physical examination, he was awake and oriented towards time and place, but he experienced periods of somnolence during questioning. Verbal responses were slowly articulated and sluggish, though not dysarthric. He followed commands appropriately when asked. Cranial nerve examination was normal. Motor strength was full in proximal and distal muscles of the extremities. Sensation to light touch on the face, trunk and extremities was not diminished. Patellar and ankle reflexes were symmetric.

Hypernatraemia was initially thought to be the cause of encephalopathy. Manifestations of hypernatraemia include lethargy, weakness, alterations in mental status, seizures or comas. 2 His desmopressin dose was increased and his sodium level normalised. However, his mental status did not improve. The possibility of cerebral oedema as a result of overly rapid correction of the hypernatraemia was considered. Cerebral oedema due to treatment of hypernatraemia may present with nausea, malaise, headache, lethargy and obtundation. 2 However, the patient's sodium correction rate did not exceed the recommended rate of 0.5 mEQ/L per hour during treatment, and he did not develop the above described symptoms and signs.",

Seizures are an infrequent part of the presentation. Neurological examination is significant for mild confusion, word-finding difficulties, slowed responses and ataxic gait. MRI brain allows the identification of diffusion restricted, noncontrast enhancing lesions located in the splenium of the corpus callosum. 14 The pathogenesis of MERS is not entirely established. Splenial lesions of the corpus callosum appear to be a nonspecific end point of diverse processes. The restricted diffusion may occur due to a transient inflammatory infiltrate similar to multiple sclerosis or cytokine release in the cerebrospinal fluid which induces an excitotoxic response during an infection. 11 MRI of MERS splenial lesions may be suggestive of intramyelinic and interstitial oedema. 14 The reported natural history of MERS suggests that symptoms last between 4 and 6 days before resolving spontaneously. 13 Repeat brain imaging usually reveals resolution of splenial lesions of the corpus callosum within 10 days of symptom improvement. No specific treatment is recommended or necessary for MERS besides indicated treatment for the underlying infectious disorder.",
