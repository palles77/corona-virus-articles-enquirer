            "text": "Respiratory infectious agents can be divided into primary and secondary pathogens. Primary pathogens include bacteria such as Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, Bordetella bronchiseptica, and Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae, and viruses including porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), swine influenza virus (SIV), pseudorabies virus, and porcine circovirus type 2 (Opriessnig et al., 2011) . Other primary pathogens are described but they are rarely encountered or have less impact on porcine health. Among the secondary pathogens, common bacteria such as Actinobacillus suis, Haemophilus parasuis, Pasteurella multocida, Salmonella choleraesuis, and Streptococcus suis are frequently reported (Choi et al., 2003; Fablet et al., 2012a Fablet et al., ,b, 2011 Opriessnig et al., 2011) . Together, primary and secondary pathogens are involved in the well-described porcine respiratory disease complex (PRDC) (Hallbur, 1998) . PRRSV and SIV, together and individually, are frequently encountered in the fields (Choi et al., 2003; Fablet et al., 2012a Fablet et al., , 2011 . In a study by Choi and collaborators, 109 samples (17%) of 636 SIV-positive cases were also positive for co-infections with PRRSV, behind P. multocida (148 samples, 23.2%) and M. hyopneumoniae (122 samples, 19.2%) (Choi et al., 2003) . Previous studies dealing with PRRSV/SIV dual infections (Pol et al., 1997; Van Reeth et al., 1996 showed various outcomes with respect to dual infection. In a study where feeder pigs were infected first with PRRSV, then with porcine respiratory coronavirus or SIV, more severe disease and growth retardation were observed with dual infection than with PRRSV infection alone (Van Reeth et al., 1996) . In another study where 3-week-old specific-pathogen-free piglets were intra-nasally infected with PRRSV, followed one week later with a H3N2 SIV strain, observations indicated that the previous PRRSV infection did not influence clinical signs during influenza infection (Pol et al., 1997) . Then, in a study with PRRSV and a European H1N1 SIV strain, authors observed variable clinical outcomes of dual PRRSV-SIV infection, depending on both the time interval between infections and the health status of pigs used in the study (Van Reeth et al., 2001) . Aside from these various following co-infections, our understanding of the impact of one virus on the other at the molecular level is still extremely limited. Most of the studies on PRRSV/SIV co-infections were performed more than ten years ago at a time where the porcine toolbox was much less developed. Thus, the aim of the current study was to determine at the molecular level how dual infections, compared to single infections, influence the response of porcine alveolar macrophages (PAMs) and precision cut lung slices (PCLS) to PRRSV and SIV. PAMs and PCLS were used because of their relevance in the context of infections with PRRSV and SIV. PAMs, pulmonary intravascular macrophages (PIMs), and interstitial macrophages (ISMs) are the main targets of PRRSV (Meulenberg, 2000; Sang et al., 2011) . PAMs can also be infected by SIV (Crisci et al., 2013; Taubenberger and Morens, 2008) . PCLS have previously been used for infection studies in birds (Abd El Rahman et al., 2010) , cattle (Goris et al., 2009) , and pigs (Punyadarsaniya et al., 2011) . The PCLS culture system has several advantages over other systems: (1) slices can be obtained in large numbers; (2) the general architecture of the tissue is preserved so differentiated epithelial cells, which are the main target cells of SIV, and various other cellular types are maintained in situ; and (3) the slice viability extends past 7 days (Punyadarsaniya et al., 2011) . Moreover, PAMs and PCLS systems together allow us to study host/ pathogen interactions in a single cell type population versus a multi-cellular tissue, granting more accurate analysis of the contribution of PAMs to the global disease response.",

The medium was changed every hour during the first 4 h and once after 24 h, prior to infection.

Validation of reference genes and transcript expression analysis using quantitative real-time polymerizing chain reaction All the selected transcript sequences were available in genome databases (http://www.ensembl.org/index.html and http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nucleotide). Real-time PCR Primers were designed and optimized using Clone Manager 9 (Scientific & Educational Software, Cary, NC, USA) and were purchased from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA, USA) (Table 1) . Slices and cells were suspended in Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) with ceramic beads (BioSpec Products, OK, USA) and total RNA was isolated using RNeasy Plus Mini Kit (Qiagen, Mississauga, ON, Canada). The absence of genomic DNA contamination was verified using prepared RNA as a template for reverse transcription-quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR). RNA concentration was determined by measuring optical density at 260 nm (OD260) and the RNA quality was assessed by calculating OD260/OD280 ratio and by capillary electrophoresis (Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer, Agilent Technologies Inc., Santa-Clara, USA). cDNA was generated from 100 to 200 ng of RNA per reaction and RT-PCR was performed using the SuperScript TM III Platinum 1 Two-Step RT-qPCR Kit as per the manufacturer's recommendations (Invitrogen). The generated cDNA was stored at \u00c080 8C. Diluted cDNA (3\u00c2) was combined with primer/ probe sets and IQ SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The qPCR conditions were: 95 8C for 3 min, 45 cycles each of 15 s at 95 8C (denaturation), 30 s at the appropriate annealing temperature (Table 1) and 30 s at 72 8C (elongation). Real-time assays were run on a Bio-Rad Cycler iQ (Bio-Rad). The specificity of the qPCR reactions was assessed by analysing the melting curves of the products and size verification of the amplicons. Samples were normalized internally using an average Cycle quantification (Cq) of the three most suitable reference genes out of seven in each sample to avoid any variation or artifacts in the target gene. These suitable reference genes were selected amongst beta-actin (ActB), beta-2-microglobulin (B2MI), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), hydroxymethylbilane synthase 2 (HMBS), hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase-1 (HPRT-1), ribosomal protein L-19 (RPL-19), and TATA box binding protein 1 (TPB-1). The stability of these reference genes was determined using the geNorm application software (Vandesompele et al., 2002) . The correlation coefficients of the standard curves were >0.995 and the concentration of the test samples were calculated from the standard curves, according to the formula y = \u00c0M \u00c2 Cq + B, where M is the slope of the curve, Cq the first positive second derivative maximum of amplification curve calculated using PCR Miner (http://www.ewindup.info/miner/version2/data_submit.htm) (Zhao and Fernald, 2005) , and B the y-axis intercept. All qPCRs assays, displaying efficiency between 90% and 110%, were performed following MIQE guidelines (Bustin et al., 2009; Taylor et al., 2010) . qPCR data were expressed as relative values after Genex macro analysis (Bio-Rad) (Vandesompele et al., 2002) using the Cq from the samples for the different transcripts.",

In all the infected slices, we observed that SIV was restricted to the bronchial epithelial cells ( Fig. 2A and C) , and no viral nucleoproteins were detected in other parts of the slices -for instance, alveolar epithelial cells and macrophages-. Even if the possible infection of the cells cannot be excluded, it appears to be an infrequent event in the conditions examined here. On the contrary, PRRSV nucleocapsid was only detected in deeper layers of the tissue, below the epithelium and in alveoli (Figs. 2B and C and 3). In the alveolus, the PRRSV staining was associated with cells stretched across a large surface of the alveolus, likely type 1 pneumocytes (Fig. 3) . Additionally, the staining was also associated with cells presenting a macrophage-like appearance (Fig. 3) . No detection was observed in cells co-infected by PRRSV and SIV in slices (see for instance Figs. 2C and 3), while many single-infected cells were observed throughout the tissue. Regarding PRRSV VR-2385 nucleoprotein transcript expression in the PCLS, no expression was observed in the control slices or the slices only infected with SIV H1N1 (Fig. 4) . In most of the conditions where the PRRSV viruses were used, PRRSV transcript expression was detected at similar levels (detection around Cq 22) with no statistically significant differences between conditions (Fig. 4) . PRRSV transcript expression was only significantly lower (P < 0.05) than in the ''PRRSV'' condition when slices were superinfected with PRRSV 3 h after SIV infection (SIV-3h-PRRSV) (Fig. 4) .

These transcripts were generally expressed at a similar level to when PRRSV was superinfecting the PCLS 3 h after SIV (SIV-3h-PRRSV) (Fig. 5A) . However, when PRRSV was administered to the slices 3 h prior to SIV (PRRSV-3h-SIV), a lower expression than in the coinfection condition ''PRRSV + SIV'' was observed for most of the transcripts, with the exception of TLR8 and TLR9. This lower induction was statistically significant for MDA5, RIG-I, and TLR3 transcripts in some conditions (see Fig. 5A ). Except for TLR3 and RIG-I, the induction of transcript expression was not statistically higher in the situation of co-infection compared to single infections (Fig. 5A ). In PAMs, PRRSV did not significantly induce the expression of viral recognition transcripts, similarly to PCLS (Fig. 5B ). However, for DAI, LGP2, MDA5, RIG-I, and TLR7 there was a marked increase in the expression of the transcripts in response to PRRSV when compared to controls (Fig. 5B) . Similarly to what was observed in PCLS, the expression of transcripts for DAI, LGP2, MDA5, and RIG-I was significantly higher in the SIV infected cells (P < 0.05) than in the controls (Fig. 5B ). Regarding TLR3, TLR8, and TLR9 transcripts, no significant difference was observed between control and SIV conditions (Fig. 5B) , although expression of TLR3 transcripts seemed higher with SIV than PRRSV. However, this observation was not confirmed by statistical analysis. Furthermore, no statistically significant differences were identified between the various conditions for TLR transcripts, with the exception of TLR7 transcripts (Fig. 5B) . Moreover, ''SIV'' condition was not significantly different amongst the co-infection and superinfection conditions for all the transcripts (Fig. 5B) .",

In the current report, the impact of PRRSV/SIV co-infection versus single infections on the immune response of PAMs and PCLS with respect to alterations in viral replication and associated host gene transcripts was assessed.",

            "text": "In a study by Van Reeth and collaborators, results suggested that the SIV replication was only slightly affected by the prior infection with the Lelystad virus strain of PRRSV (Van Reeth et al., 1996) . In that experiment, the pigs were inoculated first by aerosol with PRRSV and three days later with SIV (Van Reeth et al., 1996) . Viral excretion in the PRRSV-SIV group was delayed by two days, not only with regard to the presence of virus, but also with respect to the peak amount (Van Reeth et al., 1996) . In our PCLS experiment, SIV transcript expression was not altered in the condition where SIV was administered to slices 3 h after PRRSV. The timing, the experimental settings (in vivo versus ex vivo), and the different genotypes of the viral strains used could account for this small difference in the results obtained. Similarly, superinfection with PRRSV after SIV infection did not impact the SIV replication. On the contrary, PRRSV superinfection 3 h after SIV infection significantly reduced the replication of the PRRSV. Because no other studies have looked at the impact of PRRSV superinfection on SIV replication, it is difficult to make comparisons. The reduction in the PRRSV replication, however, has to be interpreted carefully since a lower number of PRSSV transcripts detected could also be a consequence of the shorter replication time allowed for the superinfecting virus (15 h versus 18 h). Interestingly, when the two viruses were co-administered, there was a noticeable decrease in PRRSV replication. However, it was not statistically significant. The results obtained in PAMs were noticeably different than in the PCLS. SIV replication was reduced when the PRRSV was co-administered with SIV (P < 0.05), or prior to SIV (however, P > 0.05). These results corroborate those reported by Van Reeth et al. (1996) . Regarding PRRSV replication, again the pre-infection of the PAMs with SIV was accompanied by a significant decrease in PRRSV replication (P < 0.05). Similarly, the replication of PRRSV seemed also decreased when PAMs were co-infected with PRRSV and SIV (P > 0.05). Taken together, our data suggest a slightly negative impact of the first virus on the replication of the second virus regardless the order of viral infection especially in PAMs. As both viruses are RNA viruses using the same cellular machinery, especially in the PAMs where infections were performed at high MOI, an interference of one virus cycle on the cycle of the second is not surprising. Penetration kinetics of both viruses could also account for the observed differences as previously described in another family of respiratory viruses (Meurens et al., 2004a) .",

            "text": "Regarding the PRR transcripts (DAI, LGP2, MDA5, RIG-I, and TLR7) in PAMs, PRRSV showed a positive trend toward an increase in their expression; however it was not statistically significant, possibly due to the small number of samples examined. One hypothesis to explain the complete absence of transcript over-expression in response to the PRRSV in the PCLS is the relatively small percentage of macrophages in the slices and their cellular heterogeneity in comparison to a pure population such as PAMs. In the literature, PRRSV was associated with an increase of most, if not all, viral-sensing TLRs in the lungs, including TLR2, TLR3, TLR4, TLR7, TLR8, and TLR9 (Liu et al., 2009; Xiao et al., 2010a,b) . In our study, after 18 h of infection, an increase in expression was demonstrated for TLR7. Notably, the relative expression of TLR3 transcripts was particularly high in ''PRRSV/SIV'' condition in PCLS. For TLR8 and TLR9, there were no statistically significant alterations in transcriptional expression in all infection conditions. In agreement with previous reports (Xiao et al., 2010a,b) , our data suggest a significant stimulation of RIG-I and MDA5 after infection of lungs with another type 2 PRRSV. Additionally, after PRRSV infection, we observed an increase in the mRNA expression of two known detectors of virally derived RNA and DNA, DAI and LGP2 transcripts (Pichlmair and Reis e Sousa, 2007; Sang et al., 2011) . Contrary to PRRSV, SIV significantly induced the upregulation of the expression of all the selected transcripts (i.e. DAI, LGP2, MDA5, and RIG-I) and TLR3 transcripts in the PCLS (P < 0.05). In the PAMs, increases in the expression of viral recognition transcripts were statistically significant (DAI, LGP2, MDA5, and RIG-I) or showed a slight but not significant increase (TLR3 and TLR7). These results are in agreement with previous studies in pigs (Husser et al., 2011; Li et al., 2011) and other species . Conversely, NLRP3, a detector of SIV replication (Wu et al., 2011), was not induced but rather slightly repressed in our conditions. This is possibly due to the chosen time point after viral infection. In co-infection and superinfection conditions, relative expression of the viral recognition transcripts was not generally statistically different from relative expression of the same transcripts in response to SIV infection alone. However, in the case of TLR3 and RIG-I transcripts in the PCLS, they were clearly additive and even displayed synergistic effects of the two viruses with possible contribution of TLR7 transcripts to the additive effects (Fig. 5A) . When a 3 h delay was introduced between the administration of the two viruses, observations were similar, with the exception of ''PRRSV-3h-SIV'' in PCLS, where expression of the transcripts was generally lower. Again, the 15 h incubation time versus 18 h could account for the observed difference even if we cannot exclude a PRRSV-specific effect.",

            "text": "IFNa transcript expression was very similar in all PCLS, while some significant expression differences were observed in the PAMs especially in superinfection conditions. The higher expression of IFNa transcripts in ''PRRSV-3h-SIV and SIV-3h-PRRSV'' conditions could be a consequence of both additive effects and viral kinetics. Indeed, based on other findings in our laboratory (unpublished data) and another study in pig PAMs (Genini et al., 2008) , it was shown that IFNa mRNA is usually detected earlier than IFNb mRNA after SIV infection. In the PCLS, IFNb transcripts were mostly produced in response to SIV virus with a synergy in their expression when SIV was coadministered with PRRSV. The same trend was observed in response to PRRSV infection in PAMs. This observation is a bit surprising because it has been shown that PRRSV actively suppresses IFNb in macrophages, at least in MARC-145 cells and some human cells (Miller et al., 2004; Sang et al., 2011) . However, in a study using porcine PAMs (Genini et al., 2008) , the authors observed a strong upregulation of IFNb transcripts 12 h post-infection, in support of our data. Regarding IFNg, transcript expression was only observed in the PCLS with a significant increase in co-infection and superinfection conditions, suggesting again synergistic effects of the two infections. At the protein level, no interferons (a and b) was detected at 18 h post-infection, suggesting either very low expression under the limits of detection of the kit or some posttranscriptional regulatory mechanisms preventing protein expression as previously described (Lee et al., 2004; Wang and Christopher-Hennings, 2012) . However it seems, to some level, sufficient amounts of interferons were produced; at least in response to SIV, as interferon response genes (IRGs) were induced in PCLS and PAMs. Generally, interferons need to be produced in order to trigger the induction of IRGs, although a direct induction of IRGs such as OAS1 and protein kinase R by viral nucleic acids has been reported (Player and Torrence, 1998; Williams, 2001) .",

SOCS1, a regulator of immune response (Delgado-Ortega et al., 2013) , was clearly up-regulated in response to SIV in both PCLS and PAMs while there was only a slight increase in response to PRRSV, contrary to what was observed in other studies (Wysocki et al., 2012; Zhou et al., 2011) . This discrepancy could be explained by some differences in experimental conditions (infection time, heterogeneous mixed versus single cell population). Moreover, while the role of SOCS1 in the host response to influenza virus has been clearly demonstrated in other species (Pothlichet et al., 2008) , its role in PRRSV pathogenesis is still unclear.",

Upon coinfection of PCLS, we did not detect any co-infected cells, confirming the importance of bronchial epithelial cells and alveolar macrophages as the main target of SIV and PRRSV in lung, respectively (Crisci et al., 2013; Meulenberg, 2000; Sang et al., 2011; Taubenberger and Morens, 2008) . However, our study also confirms that some alveolar epithelial cells such as pneumocyte type 1 can be infected by PRRSV virus as previously reported (Sur et al., 1996) . Many different cell types are present in the PCLS, e.g. macrophages, epithelial cells, pneumocytes type 1 and 2, endothelial cells, fibroblast, and dendritic cells. This cellular diversity could account for some of the differences observed in our study between PAMs and PCLS. Moreover, many PAMs are probably removed from the PCLS because of the multiples washes performed during their preparation while PIMs and especially ISMs are more intimately associated to the tissue.",

            "text": "Altogether, the results of our study (Table 2) show that co-infection with PRRSV VR-2385 and SIV (A/Sw/Saskatchewan/18789/02) demonstrate additive effects on the expression of several types of virally induced transcripts. Moreover, a synergy was observed for some specific targets such as TLR3, RIG-I, and IFNb transcripts in the PCLS when the two viruses were administered concomitantly. The impact of such a synergy on the clinical outcome is difficult to establish as it can either increase symptoms and be detrimental for the host or, on the contrary, assist in the rapid clearance of the infections. The lower host response to superinfecting virus after an initial infection with PRRSV, if confirmed, could contribute to the development of more severe forms of SIV infection and needs further study to accurately determine how PRRSV modulates the immune response to superinfecting SIV. On the virus side, the absence of synergy between the two viruses for their replication is already beneficial for the host. The delay introduced between the two infections had most generally limited impact and we only observed a decrease in the tissue response when the PRRSV was administered first. However, the cause of that decrease is not clear and remains to be further investigated. The limited impact of superinfection delay may be due to the differences in cellular targeting between the two viruses. In conclusion, the current study opened the door to further research in the exciting and intriguing field of viral co-infection and superinfection research.",
