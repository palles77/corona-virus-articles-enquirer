On 10 March 2003, 18 healthcare workers in a medical ward at the Prince of Wales Hospital reported that they were ill, and on March 11th, 23 were admitted to an isolation ward with 'atypical pneumonia' 1, 2 . Between March 11th and March 26th, 138 patients were admitted, 69 of whom were healthcare workers. Since then, new infections have occurred on a daily basis, although, at the time or writing, the number of new cases is declining. Although SARS cases in our hospital were managed in a separate block and neither our obstetric and gynaecological staff nor patients have been infected, the consequences for us were far reaching.",

At that time, little was known about SARS. The aetiologic agent, mode of infection, incubation period or infectivity were not known. Decisions had to be made quickly, and in the absence of directives from the Hospital Authority, departments decided for themselves. On March 14th, we decided to suspend all term deliveries at the Prince of Wales Hospital and transfer services to the nearby Alice Ho Mui Ling Nethersole Hospital, which had a midwife based low risk delivery unit. Because there was no possibility of transferring the neonatal intensive care unit, preterm deliveries remained at the Prince of Wales Hospital.",

There was concern that we may have been over-reacting, but the uncertainty about whether the infection would spread to other parts of the Prince of Wales Hospital made this action prudent. We not only contacted patients, but also moved essential equipment from the delivery suite to the Alice Ho Mui Ling Nethersole Hospital, re-rostered medical, nursing and clerical staff and liaised with hospital administration at both hospitals. The press was informed and notices about the changes to the service and also what was required in terms of infection control measures were prominently displayed in all areas of the hospital.

Infected women would have been cared for in a separate area of the delivery suite, and as in the medical wards, there would have been designated 'clean' and 'dirty' teams of medical and nursing staff. On the general medical wards, it often took some days to determine whether individuals admitted with a fever actually had SARS, during which time, it was inevitable that SARS and non-SARS patients would mix.

Instead of routine gynaecology clinics, staff were rostered to review the case notes for each clinic and to set up a priority list for calling patients back when clinics resumed. A mechanism was set in place for renewal of prescriptions. Initially, this attracted some unfavourable press coverage, but those patients whose treatment was delayed voiced remarkably little discontent. As the magnitude of the crisis became apparent, both patients and the public avoided the Prince of Wales Hospital altogether, and the hospital became relatively deserted within a week. Limited outpatient services such as colposcopy and postmenopausal bleeding clinics resumed after eight weeks.",

This included some women who had already commenced ovarian stimulation for in vitro fertilisation. It was felt inappropriate to assist couples to achieve a pregnancy when the mother was at risk of contracting SARS and needing possibly teratogenic antiviral agents. Secondly, although it had been years since an in vitro fertilisation patient needed admission to the intensive care unit for treatment of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome, we could not risk this occurrence as our patient would then have been in close proximity to SARS patients and also healthcare workers.",
