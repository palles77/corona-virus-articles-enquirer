To some extent, this chapter represents all other possible linkages between transportation and public health. In this chapter, we examine two major categories of public health concerns relating to transportationdthose that relate to what is carried by transportation systems (people, goods, and pathogens) and those that relate to direct and indirect consequences when transportation systems are disrupted. In the first category, we will examine three major topics, transportation's role in (1) transmitting infectious diseases (e.g., enabling pandemics), (2) the transfer of invasive species in the natural environment, and (3) transporting hazardous materials. The two topics examined in the second category are climate change and disaster response. In each of these cases, the transportation system is either a contributor to public health consequences (a carrier of infected persons or animals) and/or a contributor to mitigating the negative public health outcomes (e.g., evacuation or disaster recovery routes).",

National security officials did not know how many other airplanes might have been hijacked by terrorists and targeted at major cities. A protocol had been in place for many years that allowed the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to order the closure of US airspace in the event of a national emergency. On the ground, the Washington D.C. metro system was shut down after the attack on the Pentagon because security officials did not know if there were other terrorists in the city trying to reach targets or trying to escape. Similarly, after the Boston Marathon bombing, the City of Boston and regional transportation authorities closed the freeway system, regional transit, airport, and intercity rail services to not allow the bombers to escape.",

            "text": "These examples show the important role of transportation systems in conveying people and goods (or possibly harmful materials), and how they can in themselves become part of a strategy to harm people or disrupt communities/economies. The exact nature of the public health threat will vary by how transportation systems are used and what they carry. The airplanes in the 9/11 attacks were clearly part of the weapon delivery system; a hazardous materials spill is more an issue of what a train, truck, barge, or ship is carrying. One must be cautious in basing future forecasts on these estimates because these historical events did not have available many of the medical treatments we have today (e.g., antiviral therapy, ventilators and intensive care units). In addition, the social, economic, and environmental conditions today are very different than those of the past. Modern medicines, population monitoring for early onslaught of illness, and a medical establishment prepared to handle emergencies might suggest that the epidemic/pandemic outcomes of the past (where tens of millions died) would not likely occur today. However, at the same time, the more extensive and interconnected global air system (permitting more rapid and dispersed transmittal of communicable diseases) and the ability of small groups of individuals (terrorists) to manufacture and deliver biological weapons are much greater today. These considerations would suggest that such epidemic/pandemic outcomes might be even more serious than those of the past.",

            "text": "Due to their very nature, transportation systems allow the physical movement of, and enable contact among, many different people. In the course of many types of trips, there are many surfaces that have been touched by other people. Medical science has known for some time that sneezing, coughing, talking, and even breathing can carry pathogens that expose others nearby. Pathogens are also easily transferred from one person to another by the touching of infected surfaces that are used by many different people over the course of a day (e.g., ticket machines, turnstiles, door handles, poles or straps in subway cars that provide support against vehicle acceleration, and toilet facilities). To the extent that pathogens or toxins are transmitted to others on a journey (either through physical contact or airborne), it is the transportation system that permits this to happen. Some research indicates, for example, that very small droplets from a sneeze can in fact travel around 200 feet (Kopman, 2014) . On airplanes, a study conducted by the US National Academies found that for people seated within a seat or two to the side of someone who is infected, or within one row forward or backward, the chances of catching a contagious virus were about 80%; outside of that immediate radius; however, the risk was much lowerdonly about 3%.",

            "text": "The bubonic plague (Black Death) which swept across Africa, Asia, and Europe in the 14th century spread along the major shipping and communications lanes of the time, primarily sea lanes. The conventional rationale for the Black Death was that rats carrying infected fleas traveled in ships bringing with them the plague, starting in harbor cities or in major centers of commerce and then spreading as the rats moved inland. Such an explanation is now questioned given the examination of plague-caused death patterns and the rapidity with which it spread (which does not conform with how fast rats could propagate throughout Europe). Sea transportation is still viewed as a major vehicle in the plague's initial spread, but a leading hypothesis is that it was the human, land-based contact that spread the disease so quickly after being introduced in port cities (Tatem et al., 2006) . Historians estimate that worldwide about 50 million people died in the initial plague; in Europe, plaguecaused deaths represented between 25% and 60% of the population. An estimated 200 million people died over the three major plague outbreaks from the 14th to 17th centuries. Rodriquez et al. (2017) report that there have been 10 major influenza pandemics over the past 300 years, with the 1918 Spanish Flu causing an estimated 30% of the world's population to get sick and resulting in the estimated deaths of between 50 and 100 million people (an estimated 40 million in one year alone). It resulted in an almost 10-year drop in the calculated average life expectancy of the global population (Palese, 2004) . In the United States, over one-third of the population was affected and 500,000 people died. The virus spread around the world due to many reasons, such as the widespread dislocation of large populations due to World War I. However, many explanations focus on the predominant use of crowded intercity and international modes of travel (that is, rail and ocean liners). It is not surprising to note that some of the most severe outbreaks of influenza centered on shipyards and train stations. In Sweden, major outbreaks or cases were reported in large workplaces such as factories, telegraph and telephone stations, and the tram and railway stations (Holmberg, 2017) .",

It seems clear in the literature and in governmental contingency plans that the burden in handling epidemics/pandemics will rest with local public health/ medical providers.

They also were most likely included with imported European plants. The earthworms are causing major damage to hardwood forests in Minnesota (Minnesota Department of Natural Resources, 2019). 3. Asian long-horned beetle: Often encased in wooden packaging materials and trees, the larvae of Asian longhorn beetles eat soft sappy bark, which makes it hard for nutrients to reach other parts of a tree. As they grow, the larvae burrow into the middle of the tree leaving large tunnels as they move, making the tree physically weaker. Many trees do not survive once they are infested with Asian longhorn beetles (Earthrangers, 2014) . 4. Asian tiger mosquito: The Asian tiger mosquito entered the United States in shipments of used tires from northern Asia in the mid-1980s. It is a potential vector of encephalitis, dengue (all four serotypes), yellow fever, and dog heartworm. West Nile virus has been detected in this species in the eastern United States (Center for Invasive Species Research, 2016). 5. Northern Pacific seastars: Also brought in ballast water, Northern Pacific seastars have a voracious appetite, eating almost anything they can find. They are believed to be the major reason for the decline of several species of fish (Earthrangers, 2014) .",

Two methods can be used to implement such a plan: (1) using a Ballast Water Exchange Standard, which requires ships to exchange a minimum of 95% ballast water volume at least 50 nautical miles from the nearest shore and in waters of 200 m depth or more (helping prevent invasive species spreading in coastal and shallow waters that are one of the most vulnerable to invasive species) and (2) using a Ballast Water Performance Standard, which establishes thresholds for the presence of aquatic organisms in the ballast water.

From a public health perspective, the invasive species concern is perhaps not as significant as that represented by infectious diseases being carried by passengers.

Surprisingly, an example from Washington D.C. suggests that at least for some types of hazards and in at least one region, welldefined roles were not clear (Schulman, 2015) . The DHHS in collaboration with the National Association of County and City Health Officials (NACCHO) sought to determine how local health departments (LHDs) could best contribute to a large-scale chemical event response. A focus group of 33 local, state, federal, and nonprofit agency representatives in the National Capital Region met to discuss possible roles. The result of the focus group was that the participants had very different perspectives on the role of LHDs in a chemical response. Though LHDs have responsibility for protecting human health in all hazards, the role of LHDs was perceived to be limited to disease prevention and control and not really in responding to a hazardous material incident. As noted by Schulman (2015) , \"the perception of chemical incidents as hazardous material (hazmat) events, and not public health events, may result in LHDs being left out of the loop, even after the incident transitions to a mass casualty or mass fatality event.\" She also identified the following roles for LHDs. l \"Public health surveillance activities are crucial to determining that an event has happened, as well as the nature of the event. Routine passive surveillance results can be monitored for unusual symptoms associated with chemical exposures. l LHDs' preexisting community relationships position them to be a trusted source of risk communications. While other responders handle the hazardous materials, LHDs have the ability to calm and inform the populace. l LHDs provide subject matter expertise to healthcare partners on matters such as the toxicity of chemical agents and sampling and screening approaches. If the agent is unknown, LHDs could use epidemiologic investigation methods to help identify it. l Other potential roles based on LHD expertise include: (a) coordinating the provision of mental and behavioral health services to affected communities; and (b) providing guidance to ensure the safety and health of on-theground responders.",

Many businesses have developed plans for what to do in response to an incident that define the responsibilities for each unit in the firm depending on the type of disruption. Many large shippers and carriers also have specially-trained emergency response teams that can assist in the response to a hazardous materials incident. The business plans generally fall under the concept of business continuity plans. The importance of such plans was highlighted by the Great East Japan Earthquake of 2011 where global supply chains were disrupted for months due to the disruption of the critical supply of motor vehicle products centered in the affected area in Japan. One of the outcomes from this experience was that most Japanese firms now have business continuity plans outlining the steps that will be taken for responding to immediate threats associated with such a magnitude of disruption. However, the major focus of business continuity plans is on the business itself and steps that need to be taken to recover service, maintain customer relations, and avoid negative impacts on the market value of the firm. Very few plans devote much attention to the broader picture of how interaction with public agencies, especially for planning ahead of such incidents, should occur.",

In part because of the potentially calamitous impacts of a hazardous release (especially in a dense urban area), a wide and diverse range of public agencies, nongovernmental organizations, private companies, public health providers, and emergency responders have been engaged for many years in preparing for such incidents. Over the past several decades, many incidents have provided lessons on what should be done in preparing for and responding to different scenarios. The key message from all of these experiences is that preparing and practicing for any exigency is the best possible way of minimizing the human and environmental impacts of hazardous material spills. The role of public health and medical providers is critical to this response, as is the role of all the other agencies involved with responding to and recovering from the challenges of hazardous material spills.",

Fig. 8.1 shows modeled future average global temperatures (in Centigrade) assuming four different scenarios for global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (denoted in the figure as Representative Concentration Pathways [RCPs] identified by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change [IPCC]). RCP 8.5 is the worst-case scenario where GHG emissions continue to go up, which many scientists believe to be the most likely scenario; and RCP 2.6 is the best-case scenario where GHG emissions stabilize. The most important observation of this figure is that sometime in the 2030s, the curves diverge. Only one of the four scenarios could be considered as an extension of past trends, and even here the curve shows a faster growth rate than previous years.

            "text": "1. Weather-related conditions (e.g., high winds, dust storms, sudden floods, blinding rain, or snow) are factors contributing to fatalities and injuries that were discussed in Chapter 7 as being of concern to both transportation and public health officials. In many cases, the weather-related event itself can result in fatalities. For example, the National Weather Service (NWS) reported 116 people killed in floods, 106 from extreme heat, 43 from hurricanes, and 20 from high winds in 2018 (note: this report did not include updated estimated deaths from Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico). Fifty percent of the 418 flood deaths from 2015 to 2017 occurred in vehicles (NWS, 2018). 2. Transportation provides accessibility to all sorts of land uses, including medical and health care facilities. Widespread disruptions due to extreme weather can cut access to such facilities seriously affecting the ability of health caregivers to provide medical help. This also impacts the supply chain of medical supplies and personnel trying to access the affected areas. During the recovery period, transportation facilities and service provide the channel for water and food to reach disaster zones, as well as supporting the social determinants of health that are stressed during times of disruption. 3. Roads, and in some cases transit services, helicopters, and airplanes, can provide a means of evacuating either areas that are likely to face a disaster (e.g., hurricane) or those that have experienced one (e.g., earthquake). Having a means of evacuation is especially important when there is only one way to leave. A wildfire in California in 2018, for example, surrounded the only road serving isolated campgrounds and other recreational sites that were later burned as well, resulting in fatalities for those not heeding the advice to evacuate before the fire reached those sites. Hurricane Katrina is partially remembered for large groups of the population stranded in New Orleans with no means to evacuate (the city has since identified bus stops designated for pickups of those without vehicles prior to a hurricane hitting the region). Another (nonclimate change) example is the effort of the Oregon DOT to establish routes into the state that would survive a major earthquake given that the major interstate serving the state (I-5) is expected to be destroyed in many locations (ODOT, 2014) . Alternate routes are being hardened; redundant command and control centers have been established; and prepositioning of emergency supplies has occurred to provide access to water, food, and medical supplies assuming that the road network is disrupted. 4. In some cases, transportation facilities and services can provide refuge for those seeking shelter. In the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, many people sought higher elevations, that is, bridges, to avoid rising flood waters. In many cities during heat waves, those without air conditioning ride airconditioned buses to avoid the heat (some transit agencies offer free trips for this purpose); during extreme cold, many likewise ride the transit system seeking heat. 5. Transportation agencies are often one of the few agencies with monitoring and public information capabilities in forewarning the population about an impending disaster and to communicate after a disaster occurs. These include communications about emergency routing, roadway closures, wide-area alerts, early warnings, evacuation, re-entry into disaster zones, and disaster travel information. Variable message signs that are common on major highways throughout the world can be used to convey messages concerning the locations of shelters and the most efficient paths through a road network. 6. In the aftermath of a major disaster, transportation agencies provide the physical barriers to isolate areas that are targeted for recovery to keep out those who do not belong. In addition, one of the key challenges facing many communities after a disaster is removing levels of debris that far exceed the capacity of a community to remove. State DOTs have the capability to transfer resources from one location to another and thus have become an important source of debris removal (if authorized to do so by the legislature). As an example of one state's efforts in debris removal, the Georgia DOT has formed \"strike teams\" for every segment of the state's freeway system that will respond quickly to system disruptions; staff from the state's forestry service are part of these strike teams in order to bring power saws to remove downed trees, often a major obstacle in reopening a road.",

(2008) suggest public health professionals can \"explain the health rationale for climate change mitigation in terms of reduced morbidity and mortality .. can provide evidence on the health impacts of various approaches to climate change mitigation (including co-benefits and disbenefits) . and should play a major role in developing plans that address health threats related to climate change.\" In many of these actions, transportation service and infrastructure can play a critical role in minimizing the public health consequences of a changing climate.",

In some cases, one type of disaster follows another, often with the first one exacerbating the second. For example, drought often leads to wildfires, which if followed by heavy precipitation can lead to more serious flooding (due to the destruction of land cover) and massive erosion (e.g., landslides).

Beginning in the 1990s, the US government under the leadership of FEMA implemented the all-hazards approach for developing risk-based, all-hazard emergency operations plans. FEMA's \"Guide for All-Hazard Emergency Operations Planning\" lays out the steps that \"served as a basis for effective response to any hazard that threatens any jurisdiction; facilitated the integration of mitigation into response and recovery activities; and facilitated the coordination with the federal government during catastrophic disaster situations\" (FEMA, 1996) . This guide recommended specific actions in such areas as emergency public information, communications, command and control, mass care, health and medical response, and resource management. The guide also defined a \"concept of operations\" that would ensure that the necessary planning and coordination be accomplished prior to the occurrence of a disaster to facilitate the management of health and medical services during disasters. The concept of operations was to include such things as establishing a medical command post at a disaster site that: l Coordinated health and medical response team efforts. Identified hazardous chemicals or infectious diseases, controlling their spread, and reporting their presence to appropriate state and federal health or environmental authorities. l Issued health and medical advisories to the public on such matters as emergency water supplies, waste disposal, mass feeding services, disease vectors, immunizations, disinfection, and others (FEMA, 1996) .",

The following selected lessons learned in this review provide an excellent overview of the characteristics of an all-hazards approach to incident/disaster response that should be considered by those developing such a strategy. l Legislation and regulations, while necessary, are not sufficient to ensure the prevention of accidents or adequate preparedness. It is therefore important for stakeholders to undertake additional initiatives and learn from the experience of others in different fields of work. l A common issue shared by both the nuclear and nonnuclear industries is that of identifying a wide range of accident scenarios, from design-based to beyond-designebased accidents. Consideration of such a broad range of accident scenarios ensures that planning efforts are robust and provide for adequate protection of public health and safety. l Promoting forward-looking risk governance that takes into account complex risks is important. In evaluating risk exposure, countries may want to not only rely on past disruptive shocks and linear risk modeling, but also consider evolving risk patterns, including demographic, economic, technological and environmental drivers, as well as their interdependencies and potential cascading impacts. l Training and emergency drills have also been identified as essential for successful emergency response both on-site and off-site. l It is very important to select appropriate personnel protection measures such as equipment for emergency responders, as well as the means of improving their awareness of the hazards surrounding the event.",

Emergency response plans are necessary tools for conventional crisis management. l Using social media effectively in crisis communication requires that appropriate resources be devoted to the management of social network messaging during the event. It is important to ensure that the information circulating in various social media platforms is accurate because accurate information leads to public trust in officials (see OECD, 2015 for a good discussion of the use of social media). l Engaging the private sector in crisis-management efforts is crucial, particularly when the scale and complexity of a crisis requires a \"whole-ofsociety\" approach. l Leaders must be identified prior to the crisis, and they along with their teams, organizations, and key partners must be sufficiently prepared to cope with the challenges presented by the crisis. l On-site emergency plans for accidents involving hazardous materials should take natural hazard risks into account. Off-site emergency response plans for hazardous industries in natural hazard-prone areas should consider the impact of hazardous material releases on populations and on rescue operations. The vulnerability of emergency response resources to natural events and hazardous material releases should be assessed. Medical services should be involved in the preparation of the external emergency plan. l Health effects from disasters are far more than the sum of their physical or psychological health effects, including posttraumatic stress disorder. Medically unexplained symptoms or syndromes may be the most prominent negative health outcome.",

What types of mitigation strategies would be considered for each incident? 4. Climate change will likely have significant public health consequences and disruptive effects on transportation systems.
