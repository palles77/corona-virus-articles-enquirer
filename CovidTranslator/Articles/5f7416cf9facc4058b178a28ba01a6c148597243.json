Today, the global cure rate of drug resistant TB is no better than sunshine, fresh air and grandmother's chicken soup. Airborne transmission of multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) and extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB) go unchecked from the shameful fraction of cases that are passively detected. Yet, we forget or ignore that acquired drug resistance can be prevented if those with latent TB infection (LTBI) never get the disease.",

The WHO also recommends comprehensive contact screening and prevention in low and intermediate burden countries, 2 yet high burden settings like India rely on limited testing and prevention to those living with HIV or pediatric contacts under 5. This sliver of prevention is too small to make any impact on case rate decline. Further, this pick and choose approach confuses healthcare workers performing this duty as well as the very people exposed to active TB. It provides a perception that those not screened for LTBI are not valued, or are invulnerable from acquiring TB. Even worse, it implies that TB is somehow a weak pathogen that can be easily controlled with limited measures.",

Additionally, for more than a decade, more accurate Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved blood tests have been available. Like the tuberculin skin test, interferon gamma release assays (IGRAs) are aids to diagnose TB's carrier state. Unlike the skin test, IGRAs are not impacted by prior Bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) vaccination or most non-tuberculous mycobacterial bacilli, and they require only one patient visit instead of two to get a result. 6 In large prospective LTBI prevalence trials in China and Vietnam comparing an IGRA to tuberculin skin tests (TST) head to head, a profound reduction in LTBI rates and a statistically significant higher progression rate were found with the IGRA. 7-9",

''Even if TB transmission is interrupted completely in 2015, reactivation and relapse of old infections would still generate more than 100 cases per million population in 2050.'' 1 It is also illogical to not prevent disease in individuals and families who are living on the margins of society, who cannot afford to be sick while barely having enough for the minimum necessities of food and shelter. From a non-public health viewpoint, passive case finding undermines our Hippocratic oath of doing no harm as it encourages advanced disease and decreases the chance of cure while increasing morbidity and mortality. From a public health perspective, it is illogical to not actively pursue disease diagnosis and prevention among those patients with known risks that are causing syndemics, or surges in rates of disease.",

Drug resistant strains and incurable drug resistance continue to grow and spread, becoming part of the seedbed of tomorrow's disease. Yet, most Indian providers wait for TB to come. They do not understand the importance of the LTBI reservoir or how to diagnose it. They believe that if LTBI is treated, patients will get infected again so there is ''no use''. It is also misunderstood that treatment of LTBI could cause drug resistance. India's annual infection rate is estimated at 1.5%, hardly a high chance for general reinfection, and the bacilli burden in LTBI is much too small to harbor wild drug resistant mutants required for drug resistance to emerge. A WHO systematic review showed no evidence of acquired resistance from LTBI treatment. 2 Finally, there is a perception that LTBI treatment toxicity is similar to active TB treatment which is utterly false.",

According to a WHO modeling study, the critical mass for accelerating the decline to end TB by 2050 is effectively treating 14% of those with LTBI along with effectively treating all TB cases. 1 This amounts to approximately 73 million persons of the estimated 40 percent of the Indian population with LTBI.

The complacency of our TB community is mind boggling since TB kills someone every 18 seconds, more people globally every year than any other infectious agent. Our obstacles to a true call to action mimic the stealth slow nature of the TB pathogen itself. Its timescale from infection to disease is variable, unpredictable and long. It could be decades before disease emerges. Instead of thinking of it as a time bomb or land mine, we behave on a slow time scale by acting incrementally, repeating studies and collecting evidence as if time itself will solve the problem. Our obsession on the affordability and costeffectiveness of interventions make us forget the unrelenting toll and cost caused by TB's kill rate, pervasiveness, individual financial impact, lifelong morbidity and acquired drug resistance. How can we not afford to prevent TB? We must accept the fact that if we truly want to achieve the goal of eliminating TB it will be expensive. It will cost billions, but how is that different to other investments in that price range such as the Indian space program that is considered a bargain with an annual budget in 2014 of 1.2 billion USD.",

Surveillance systems and bidirectional data sharing between national and local programs need to be enhanced to target and determine interventions and track their progress. 13 A shift from dullness and complacency to action will require looking in the mirror of truth. ''Waiting for TB to come'' is neither a convenient or affordable option. It is a rationed approach and not a logical disease control choice.
