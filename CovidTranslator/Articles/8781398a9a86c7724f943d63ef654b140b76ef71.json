            "text": "Domestic or European ferrets are carnivorous mammals related to weasels, minks, otters and skunks. They have long bodies, short legs and thick fur with various color patterns. The natural pattern, called sable or fitch, features a yellowish coat with dark patches over the limbs and tail, a facial mask and dark brown eyes. Ferrets have anal scent glands and sebaceous glands but lack sweat glands and hence are particularly susceptible to heat 1 . Adult males weigh ~2 kg, whereas females are smaller at ~1 kg. Ferrets live for roughly 6-8 years.",

Their tracheal and lung anatomies, which, like their narrow, elongated bodies and short legs, are adapted for burrowing, afford decreased airway resistance and a relatively large lung capacity that facilitate respiratory research. Because lung morphology is similar between ferrets and humans, ferrets are used in the study of cystic fibrosis 3 .",
