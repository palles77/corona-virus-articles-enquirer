In particular, a precise estimation of the potential total number of infected cases and/or 183 confirmed cases is critical for optimal preparedness and implementation of infection control 184 practices made by governments nationally and locally. An earlier study published on 17 January 185 2020 [18] suggested that a total of 1,723 cases of SARS-CoV-2 in Wuhan City (95% CI: 427-186 4,471) had onset of symptoms by 12th January 2020, which was calculated based on the 187 internationally reported cases. Later, Wu et al [19] applied a susceptible-exposed-infectious-188 recovered (SEIR) metapopulation model to simulate the epidemics of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak 189 across all major cities in China on the basis of the number of cases exported from Wuhan to cities 190 outside mainland China, and they estimated that 75 815 individuals (95% CI 37 304-130 330) 191 had been infected in Wuhan as of Jan 25, 2020. A recent study based on the Susceptible-Infected-192 Recovered-Dead (SIRD) model revealed that the cumulative number of infected cases will 193 surpass 68,000 (as a lower bound) and could reach 140,000 (with an upper bound of 290,000) by 194 February 29 [17].
