It is already established in the treatment of heart failure after cardiac surgery and has become increasingly accepted in the treatment of adults with lung injury who cannot be oxygenated by conventional means. 1 Technological advances, facilitating the implementation of ECMO in critical care, have improved outcomes for patients with ARDS. 1 Improved technology combined with an increasing confi dence in the use of ECMO from shared experiences reported at international meetings and through registries such as the Extracorporeal Life Support Organization (ELSO), has led to a substantial increase in its use (fi gure). Our analysis of the US Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) database shows that during the past decade, ECMO support after heart surgery (post-cardiotomy) and for respiratory failure has increased by more than six times. 2 Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and H1N1 fl u epidemics showed the need for lifesaving technologies and the ability of ECMO to potentially address this need in the treatment of ARDS; 1 after its successful application in these outbreaks in 2007, rates of ECMO use for respiratory failure rapidly increased. 3, 4 Portable ECMO devices are now available to allow ECMO initiation outside of a hospital setting. Some French, German, and Taiwanese centres have reported the feasibility of use of ECMO for cardiopulmonary arrest by trained interdisciplinary teams. 5, 6, 7 The French fi eld ECMO programme was established to specifi cally deal with the anticipated need for mobile ECMO in an H1N1 epidemic. 5 This programme enhanced the possibility of incorporating ECMO into comprehensive emergency preparedness programmes as a medical Michael Donne/Science Photo Library countermeasure against epidemics or terrorist actions that could lead to ARDS. However, evidence on its use in this type of setting is limited. Although clinical information from case series, trials, and the ELSO registry provide some data, similar to other devices for disaster preparedness regimens, these devices cannot be fully tested until disaster situations arise. Bleeding, embolic, and infectious complications inherent in the use of ECMO might be increased when used in mass casualty settings in inexperienced hands. Indications for the use of ECMO could be inadvertently or erroneously expanded to include healthier patients in view of present enthusiasm for the technology because of its success in treating patients with H1N1 or SARS. Furthermore, ECMO might not be discontinued in futile cases whereby its further use leads to needless prolongation of patient discomfort and an inappropriate use of scare resources. All these factors make regulatory approval and consideration of ECMO as a medical countermeasure challenging; however, approval is needed to allow production and dissemination of suffi cient devices for use in a publichealth emergency.",

It invites an even more radical change than the innovation pathway used by the US Food and Drug Administration. 8 The type and number of patients aff ected by acts of bioterrorism or public-health emergencies that ECMO could treat is unknown; the device cannot be fully tested until those situations occur. For present approved devices, including ECMO, the approach to their use will be based on present clinical evidence, modelling, and expert opinion. For novel devices that are potential medical countermeasures, diff erent types and thresholds of evidence are needed to accelerate approval. Appropriate systems of assessment need to be developed that can incorporate new concepts for using accumulated data as surrogate evidence of eff ectiveness (and safety) in medical countermeasure settings to allow ECMOs to be included into strategies of preparedness without delays. The amount and type of evidence will vary depending on whether the device used poses high clinical risks (eg, ECMO) or low clinical risks (eg, a novel type of wound dressing).",

The protagonist struggles to make sense of a complex machinery of forces that are beyond his control and hinder his daily life. Although these fi ctional trials and tribulations represent an extreme, today's respiratory and other medical researchers similarly fi nd themselves unable to move forward with translational research because, in many instances, of rules beyond their control. This sentiment was prominent at the European Respiratory Society Presidential Summit, 2 \"Breaking down barriers to lung health: a better environment for better medicines\", held in Rome from July 2-3, 2014. The meeting took place under the auspices of the Italian Presidency of the Council of the European Union, which has identifi ed respiratory diseases as a priority. 3 By today's exigent rules, even aspirin or corticosteroids would not adhere with standards of the regulatory system. There is enormous attrition with only one approved drug from 10 000 starting molecules and the process takes around 15 years from drug discovery to regulatory approval. 4 Unsurprisingly, in respiratory medicine, there have been only nine new classes of therapy in the past 40 years. 5 Respiratory medicine has the lowest success rate of any therapeutic area in bringing new drugs to market, with 3% of drugs entering clinical trials gaining approval. 6 An overly complex regulatory environment and exaggerated concerns about safety have been powerful disincentives for people who might have otherwise become involved in drug research.",
