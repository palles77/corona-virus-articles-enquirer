Here, we have evaluated the in vitro and in vivo antiviral activities of GRFT against Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) infection. In vitro experiments showed that treatment of JEV with GRFT before inoculation of BHK-21 cells inhibited infection in a dose-dependent manner, with 99 % inhibition at 100 lg/ml and a 50 % inhibitory concentration (IC 50 ) of 265 ng/ml (20 nM). Binding assays suggested that binding of GRFT to JEV virions inhibited JEV infection. In vivo experiment showed that GRFT (5 mg/kg) administered intraperitoneally before virus infection could completely prevent mortality in mice challenged intraperitoneally with a lethal dose of JEV. Our study also suggested that GRFT prevents JEV infection at the entry phase by targeting the virus. Collectively, our data demonstrate that GRFT is an antiviral agent with potential application in the development of therapeutics against JEV or other flavivirus infections.",

JEV infection causes a broad spectrum of clinical symptoms, ranging from asymptomatic infections to fever, encephalitis, and even death. Encephalitis caused by the infection is estimated to occur in 1 of 20 to 1000 cases [5, 12] , with approximately 25 % of encephalitic patients dying and 50 % of the survivors developing permanent neurologic and/or psychiatric sequelae. The JEV genome is a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA encoding a polyprotein of approximately 3,400 amino acids that is cleaved into three structural proteins (capsid [C], premembrane [prM] and envelope glycoprotein [E] ) and seven nonstructural proteins [23] . The JEV envelope glycoprotein (53-55 kDa) contains two potential glycosylation sites [9] that are important for virus attachment, fusion, penetration, cell tropism, virulence and attenuation [14] . The JEV prM protein also contains one glycosylation site that is important for virus release and pathogenesis [13] .",

Due to its lectin activity, GRFT has been shown to have broad-spectrum antiviral activity against several enveloped viruses, including human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) [16] , SARS-CoV [27] , and hepatitis C virus (HCV) [15] . Recombinant GRFT produced in E. coli or in the Nicotiana benthamiana expression system does not alter its potent anti-HIV activity and its safety profile compared to native GRFT [16, 17] . GRFT is a dimeric lectin with six principal binding sites that can bind to the SARS-CoV spike glycoprotein (S) and prevent virus entry into target cells [27] . Because of the presence of glycans on the JEV virion, we investigated whether GRFT displays antiviral activity against JEV infection. Here, we demonstrate that GRFT inhibits JEV entry into host cells at nanomolar concentrations. Furthermore, we show that the inhibition was due to the binding ability of GRFT to the glycans on JEV virions.",

We found that the viral genomic RNA level was significantly reduced in a dose-dependent manner up to 99 % reduction at 100 lg/ml of GRFT (P \\ 0.001) (Fig. 2E) when BHK-21 cells were incubated in the presence of premixed JEV/GRFT, suggesting that GRFT could interact directly with virus particles and thereby reduce their infectivity. We further investigated whether GRFT inhibits JEV infection by interacting with the cells. BHK-21 cells were incubated with GRFT for 1.5 h before virus infection. The result showed that preincubation of BHK-21 cells with GRFT had no significant inhibitory effect on JEV infection (Fig. 2E) , demonstrating that GRFT did not interact with the receptors required for the virus entry. To determine if GRFT is effective after infection has already been established, we first inoculated the cells with the virus for 1.5 h. The cells were then washed three times with PBS and incubated in the presence of GRFT for 1.5 hrs. We did not observe any changes in the level of JEV genomic RNA at 48 hpi (Fig. 2E) , suggesting that GRFT acts at early steps in the life cycle of the virus. Finally, we added GRFT simultaneously with JEV in BHK-21 cells to investigate whether GRFT initiates antiviral activity immediately upon contact with JEV. As shown in Fig. 2E , GRFT inhibited JEV infection in BHK-21 cells, which is consistent with the immediate effect of GRFT on HIV-1 infection [10] .",

Western blot analysis also confirmed this (Fig. 4B) .

Therefore, in this study we evaluated the antiviral activity of recombinant GRFT against JEV infection in vitro and in vivo. Our in vitro results showed that the interaction between GRFT and JEV virions resulted in a significant inhibition of virus infection in BHK-21 cells at nanomolar concentrations. A monomer of GRFT contains three carbohydratebinding sites that bind to N-linked glycans on virus glycoproteins [27] . GRFT exists as a domain-swapped homodimer; it has six separate binding sites that are important for its antiviral potency [27] . Binding of GRFT to virus glycoproteins may inhibit the conformational change required for virus-target cell attachment and subsequent fusion. It has been reported that there is a difference in the antiviral activity of GRFT against SARS-CoV and HIV-1, which is likely due to the differences in the binding affinity between GRFT and viral envelope glycoproteins [18] . Therefore, despite GRFT exerting its antiviral activity using similar mechanisms, the mode by which GRFT interacts with different viral glycoproteins is the main factor that influences the antiviral activity of GRFT against different viruses.",

This finding is consistent with what has been observed in a study on SARS-CoV [18] . The absence of JEV proteins in mice at day 21 postchallenge indicated that the virus is cleared over time [21] , suggesting a prophylactic value of GRFT against JEV infection. An in vivo study on the antiviral activity of GRFT against HCV (a flavivirus) infection demonstrates that GRFT can delay the kinetics of infection when injected subcutaneously [15] . In our mice experiment, we observed that the intraperitoneal administration of GRFT provided a survival advantage to mice infected with a lethal dose of JEV. It has been shown that the presence of N-glycans in HIV-1 and HCV restricts the antibody neutralizing response and protects the virus from being recognized by animal immune systems [3] . One study has demonstrated that GRFT can also interact with glycans on HIV-1 gp120, exposing the CD4 binding site (CD4bs) and increasing the sensitivity to CD4bs antibodies [2] . The conformational alteration caused by the interaction of GRFT with JEV glycoproteins [6] may expose hidden epitopes of the JEV glycoprotein, allowing the immune system to become actively involved in inhibiting JEV infection [3] . This is an additional property of GRFT that makes it a novel antiviral agent against JEV infection.",

This indiscriminate activity of GRFT represents a challenge for developing GRFT as an antiviral agent.
