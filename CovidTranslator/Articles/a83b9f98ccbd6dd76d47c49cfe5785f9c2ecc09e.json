LF has a high case fatality rate ranging from 1% in the community to over 60% in hospital settings [1, 4, 5] . The common reservoir of LASV is Mastomys natalensis, one of the most widespread rodent species in sub-Saharan Africa [1, 3] , which exhibit sensitive population dynamics to water level [6, 7] .

The 2017-18 epidemic in Nigeria was an unprecedented LF outbreak in the country's history [11] , which resulted in 400 confirmed cases, including 97 deaths, between January and March 2018 [12] . The 2018-19 epidemic in Nigeria has already caused 420 confirmed cases from January to March 02 of 2019, which included 93 deaths [12] . The five states of Edo, Ondo, Ebonyi, Bauchi, and Plateau are the only states that have been among the top 10 hit hardest states in terms of number of LF cases in both the 2018 (85.5% of total national cases) and 2019 (85.7% of total national cases) outbreaks. While there have been discussions about the connection of rainfall to LF [13, 14] , this connection has not yet been demonstrated and quantified. This work aims to study the epidemiological features of outbreaks in different Nigerian regions between January 2016 and March 2019. We estimate LF infectivity in terms of the reproduction number (R) and quantify the association between R and local rainfall by using modeling analysis. We explore the spatial heterogeneity of the LF outbreaks and summarize the overall findings with model-average estimates.",

The models are selected by comparing the AIC to that of the baseline model. Only the models with an AIC lower than the AIC of the baseline model are considered for further analysis. Since the epidemic curves of an infectious disease commonly exhibit autocorrelations [19], we use autoregression (AR) models with a degree of 2, i.e., AR(2), as the baseline models for growth model selection. We also adopt the coefficient of determination (R-squared) and the coefficient of partial determination (partial R-squared) to evaluate goodness-of-fit and fitting improvement, respectively.

The term t denotes the cumulative lag in the model, and \u2329rainfall j,t \u232a represents the average monthly rainfall of the previous t months from the turning point, \u03c4, of the j-th region. The reproduction numbers, R j , are estimated for different epidemics from the selected growth models. The regression coefficient, \u03b2, is to be estimated. Hence, the term (e \u03b2 -1)*100% is the percentage change rate (of R), which can be interpreted as the percentage change in transmissibility due to a one unit (mm) increase in monthly rainfall. The framework of the regression is based on the exponential form of the predictor to model the expectation of transmissibility (e.g., R); this framework is inspired by previous work [28] [29] [30] [31] . To quantify the impacts of local rainfall, we calculate the percentage change rate with different cumulative lags (t) from 0-11 months and estimate their significant levels.

We report the most significant (i.e., with the lowest p-value) regression estimates that appear with a cumulative lag of 7 months. The habitats of the LASV reservoir, i.e., rodents, include irrigated and flooded agricultural lands that are commonly found in and around African villages [6] . The range of lag from 4-9 months has previously been explained by the time interval between the peak of the rainfall and the rodent population [7] . The association between rodent population dynamics and rainfall levels has been demonstrated in a number of previous studies [6-10]. This relation could also be verified by examining the rodent population data in the Nigerian regions included in this work. The present finding of the impact of lagged rainfall on LF outbreaks suggests that knowledge of such weather-driven epidemics could be gained by referring to past rainfall levels. For instance, if a relatively high amount of rainfall occurs, local measures, such as rodent population control, could be effective to reduce the LF risk. The findings in this work are of public health interest and are helpful for policy-makers trying to achieve LF prevention and control.",
