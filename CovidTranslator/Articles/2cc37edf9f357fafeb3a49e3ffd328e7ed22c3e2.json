            "text": "CDC, the Infectious Disease Society of America, and the American Society of Blood and Marrow Transplantation have cosponsored these guidelines for preventing opportunistic infections (OIs) among hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients. The guidelines were drafted with the assistance of a working group of experts in infectious diseases, transplantation, and public health. For the purposes of this report, HSCT is defined as any transplantation of blood-or marrow-derived hematopoietic stem cells, regardless of transplant type (i.e., allogeneic or autologous) or cell source (i.e., bone marrow, peripheral blood, or placental or umbilical cord blood). Such OIs as bacterial, viral, fungal, protozoal, and helminth infections occur with increased frequency or severity among HSCT recipients. These evidence-based guidelines contain information regarding preventing OIs, hospital infection control, strategies for safe living after transplantation, vaccinations, and hematopoietic stem cell safety. The disease-specific sections address preventing exposure and disease for pediatric and adult and autologous and allogeneic HSCT recipients. The goal of these guidelines is twofold: to summarize current data and provide evidence-based recommendations regarding preventing OIs among HSCT patients. The guidelines were developed for use by HSCT recipients, their household and close contacts, transplant and infectious diseases physicians, HSCT center personnel, and public health professionals. For all recommendations, prevention strategies are rated by the strength of the recommendation and the quality of the evidence supporting the recommendation. Adhering to these guidelines should reduce the number and severity of OIs among HSCT recipients.",

In response, CDC published a plan (2 ) that outlined national disease prevention priorities, including the development of guidelines for preventing opportunistic infections (OIs) among immunosuppressed persons. During 1995, CDC published guidelines for preventing OIs among persons infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and revised those guidelines during 1997 and 1999 (3) (4) (5) . Because of the success of those guidelines, CDC sought to determine the need for expanding OI prevention activities to other immunosuppressed populations. An informal survey of hematology, oncology, and infectious disease specialists at transplant centers and a working group formed by CDC determined that guidelines were needed to help prevent OIs among hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT)* recipients.",

            "text": "HSCT is the infusion of hematopoietic stem cells from a donor into a patient who has received chemotherapy, which is usually marrow-ablative. Increasingly, HSCT has been used to treat neoplastic diseases, hematologic disorders, immunodeficiency syndromes, congenital enzyme deficiencies, and autoimmune disorders (e.g., systemic lupus erythematosus or multiple sclerosis) (7) (8) (9) (10) . Moreover, HSCT has become standard treatment for selected conditions (7, 11, 12 ) . Data HSCTs are classified as either allogeneic or autologous on the basis of the source of the transplanted hematopoietic progenitor cells. Cells used in allogeneic HSCTs are harvested from a donor other than the transplant recipient. Such transplants are the most effective treatment for persons with severe aplastic anemia (13 ) and offer the only curative therapy for persons with chronic myelogenous leukemia (12 ) . Allogeneic donors might be a blood relative or an unrelated donor. Allogeneic transplants are usually most successful when the donor is a human lymphocyte antigen (HLA)-identical twin or matched sibling. However, for allogeneic candidates who lack such a donor, registry organizations (e.g., the National Marrow Donor Program) maintain computerized databases that store information regarding HLA type from millions of volunteer donors (14) (15) (16) . Another source of stem cells for allogeneic candidates without an HLA-matched sibling is a mismatched family member (17, 18 ) . However, persons who receive allogeneic grafts from donors who are not HLA-matched siblings are at a substantially greater risk for graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) (19 ) . These persons are also at increased risk for suboptimal graft function and delayed immune system recovery (19 ) . To reduce GVHD among allogeneic HSCTs, techniques have been developed to remove T-lymphocytes, the principal effectors of GVHD, from the donor graft. Although the recipients of T-lymphocyte-depleted marrow grafts generally have lower rates of GVHD, they also have greater rates of graft rejection, cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection, invasive fungal infection, and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-associated posttransplant lymphoproliferative disease (20 ) .",

For example, use of cyclosporine GVHD prophylaxis has become commonplace since its introduction during the early 1980s. Most frequently, cyclosporine or tacrolimus (FK506) is administered in combination with other immunosuppressive agents (e.g., methotrexate or corticosteroids) (27 ) .

Unfortunately, this conditioning regimen also destroys normal hematopoiesis for neutrophils, monocytes, and macrophages and damages mucosal progenitor cells, causing a temporary loss of mucosal barrier integrity. The gastrointestinal tract, which normally contains bacteria, commensal fungi, and other bacteriacarrying sources (e.g., skin or mucosa) becomes a reservoir of potential pathogens. Virtually all HSCT recipients rapidly lose all T-and B-lymphocytes after conditioning, losing immune memory accumulated through a lifetime of exposure to infectious agents, environmental antigens, and vaccines. Because transfer of donor immunity to HSCT recipients is variable and influenced by the timing of antigen exposure among donor and recipient, passively acquired donor immunity cannot be relied upon to provide long-term immunity against infectious diseases among HSCT recipients.",

Among unrelated allogeneic recipients, engraftment occurs at a median of 22 days after HSCT (range: 6-84 days) (15 ) . In the absence of corticosteroid use, engraftment is associated with the restoration of effective phagocytic function, which results in a decreased risk for bacterial and fungal infections. However, all HSCT recipients and particularly allogeneic recipients, experience an immune system dysfunction for months after engraftment. For example, although allogeneic recipients might have normal total lymphocyte counts within \u22482 months after HSCT, they have abnormal CD4/CD8 T-cell ratios, reflecting their decreased CD4 and increased CD8 T-cell counts (27 ) . They might also have immunoglobulin G (IgG) 2 , IgG 4 , and immunoglobulin A (IgA) deficiencies for months after HSCT and have difficulty switching from immunoglobulin M (IgM) to IgG production after antigen exposure (32 ) .

Risk factors for chronic GVHD include increasing age, allogeneic HSCT (particularly those among whom the donor is unrelated or a non-HLA identical family member) (40 ) , and a history of acute GVHD (24, 45 ) . Chronic GVHD was first described as occurring >100 days after HSCT but can occur 40 days after HSCT (19 ) . Although allogeneic recipients with chronic GVHD have normal or high total serum immunoglobulin levels (41 ) , they experience long-lasting IgA, IgG, and IgG subclass deficiencies (41, 46, 47 ) and poor opsonization and impaired reticuloendothelial function. Consequently, they are at even greater risk for infections (32, 39 ) , particularly life-threatening bacterial infections from encapsulated organisms (e.g., Stre. pneumoniae , Ha. influenzae , or Ne. meningitidis ).

Additionally, herpes simplex virus (HSV) reactivation can occur during this phase. During preengraftment, the risks for infection are the same for autologous or allogeneic patients, and OIs can appear as febrile neutropenia. Although a recipient's first fever during preengraftment is probably caused by a bacterial pathogen, rarely is an organism or site of infection identified. Instead, such infections are usually treated preemptively or empirically (48 ) until the neutropenia resolves (49 ) .

During phase III, autologous recipients usually have more rapid recovery of immune system function and, therefore, a lower risk for OIs than do allogeneic recipients. Because of cell-mediated and humoral immunity defects and impaired reticuloendothelial system function, allogeneic patients with chronic GVHD and recipients of alternate donor allogeneic transplants are at risk for certain infections during this phase. Alternate donors include matched unrelated, UCB, or mismatched family-related donors. These patients are at risk for infections that include CMV, varicella-zoster virus (VZV), EBV-related posttransplant lymphoproliferative disease, communityacquired respiratory viruses (CRV), and infections with encapsulated bacteria (e.g., Ha. influenzae and Stre. pneumoniae). Risk for these infections is approximately proportional to the severity of the patient's GVHD during phases II and III. Patients receiving mismatched allogeneic transplants have a higher attack rate and severity of GVHD and, therefore, a higher risk for OIs during phases II and III than do patients receiving matched allogeneic HSCTs. In contrast, patients undergoing autologous transplantation are primarily at risk for infection during phase I. Preventing infections among HSCT recipients is preferable to treating infections. However, despite recent technologic advances, more research is needed to optimize health outcomes for HSCT recipients. Efforts to improve immune system reconstitution, particularly among allogeneic transplant recipients, and to prevent or resolve the immune dysregulation resulting from donor-recipient histoincompatibility and GVHD remain substantial challenges for preventing recurrent, persistent, or progressive infections among HSCT patients. susceptibility profiles, particularly when using a single antibiotic for antibacterial prophylaxis (BIII).

For example, recipients who are hypogammaglobulinemic might receive prophylactic IVIG to prevent bacterial sinopulmonary infections (e.g., from Stre. pneumoniae ) (8 ) (CIII). For hypogammaglobulinemic allogeneic recipients, physicians can use a higher and more frequent dose of IVIG than is standard for non-HSCT recipients because the IVIG half-life among HSCT recipients (generally 1-10 days) is much shorter than the half-life among healthy adults (generally 18-23 days) (56) (57) (58) . Additionally, infections might accelerate IgG catabolism; therefore, the IVIG dose for a hypogammaglobulinemic recipient should be individualized to maintain trough serum IgG concentrations >400-500 mg/dl (58 ) (BII).

Influenza vaccinations administered to HSCT recipients <6 months after HSCT are unlikely to be beneficial and are not recommended (142 ) (DII). HSCT recipients <6 months after HSCT should receive chemoprophylaxis with amantadine or rimantadine during community or nosocomial influenza A outbreaks (BIII). These drugs are not effective against influenza B. Additionally, antiviral-resistant strains of influenza can emerge during treatment with amantadine or rimantadine and transmission of resistant strains can occur (148, 149 ) . During such outbreaks, HSCT recipients 6-24 months after HSCT, or >24 months after HSCT and still substantially immunocompromised (i.e., receiving immunosuppressive therapy, have had a relapse of their underlying disease, or have GVHD) and who have not yet received a current influenza vaccination, should be vaccinated against influenza immediately (BIII). Additionally, to allow sufficient time for the patient to experience an immunologic response to influenza vaccine, chemoprophylaxis with amantadine or rimantadine can be used for these HSCT recipients for 2 weeks after vaccination during a nosocomial or community influenza A outbreak (CIII). Influenza A chemoprophylaxis with amantadine or rimantadine has been recommended for all influenza A-exposed HSCT recipients <24 months after HSCT or \u224824 months after HSCT and substantially immunocompromised regardless of vaccination history, because of their likely suboptimal immunologic response to influenza vaccine (142, 143 ) . However, no recommendation regarding such chemoprophylaxis can be made because of lack of data.",

Additionally, itraconazole capsules are not recommended for fungal prophylaxis among HSCT recipients (191 ) (DII) for three reasons. First, itraconazole capsules are poorly absorbed gastrointestinally, particularly among patients who are fasting (192 ) or receiving cytotoxic agents (193 ) . Second, persons taking itraconazole capsules do not achieve steady-state serum levels for 2 weeks (188, 194 ) , and when achieved, these levels are lower than the average Aspergillus species minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) among HSCT recipients (195 ) . Third, itraconazole has adverse interactions with other drugs (e.g., antiepileptics, rifampin, oral hypoglycemics, protease inhibitors, vinca alkaloids, cyclosporine, methylprednisolone, and warfarin-like anticoagulants) (196 ) . Trials assessing the efficacy of the recently licensed cyclodextrin oral solution and intravenous formulations of itraconazole in preventing invasive fungal disease among HSCT recipients are in progress; however, no recommendations regarding its use for Aspergillus species infection prophylaxis can be made. For HSCT recipients whose respiratory specimens are culture positive for Aspergillus species, acute invasive aspergillosis should be diagnosed presumptively (197 ) and treated preemptively and aggressively (e.g., with intravenous amphotericin) (AIII).",

Use of aerosolized pentamidine (209 ) is associated with the lowest PCP prevention rates and should only be used if other agents cannot be tolerated. Atovaquone is a possible alternative drug for PCP prophylaxis among dapsone intolerant persons with HIV infection (210 ) ; however, no recommendation regarding use of atovaquone among HSCT recipients can be made because of lack of data. Although data are limited, concomitant use of leucovorin (folinic acid) and TMP-SMZ is not recommended (211,212 ) (DIII). A patient's history of PCP should not be regarded as a contraindication to HSCT (213 ) (DIII).",

Therefore, potential donors who were born, received a blood transfusion, or ever lived for \u22486 months in a Chagas' disease endemic area (e.g., parts of South and Central America and Mexico) should be screened serologically for anti-Tr. cruzi serum IgG antibody (228 ) (BIII).

With correct personnel fit-testing and training, N95 respirators reliably reduce aerosol exposure by 90%. Without fittesting and training, aerosol exposure would be reduced but not necessarily by 90% (243 ) . For patients who cannot use or tolerate an N95 respirator, researchers have proposed using the powered air purifying respirator (244, 245 ) , which can be used by patients in wheelchairs. Limitations of the powered air purifying respirator include its cost and that it is not appropriate for young children and infants. General limitations of using respirators are that no commercially available respirator, including N95, has been tested specifically for its efficacy in reducing exposure to Aspergillus species in hospital construction or renovation areas, and no studies have been done that assess the usefulness and acceptability of using respirators among HSCT recipients. Standard surgical masks provide negligible protection against mold spores and are not recommended for this indication (DIII).",

Careful observation of isolation precautions is critical in preventing transmission of infectious agents among HSCT recipients, HCWs, visitors, and other HSCT recipients.

All persons, but particularly HCWs, should wash their hands before entering and after leaving the rooms of HSCT recipients and candidates undergoing conditioning therapy (62, 249 ) or before and after any direct contact with patients regardless of whether they were soiled from the patient, environment, or objects (AI). HSCT recipients should be encouraged to practice safe hand hygiene (e.g., washing hands before eating, after using the toilet, and before and after touching a wound) (BIII). Hand washing should be done with an antimicrobial soap and water (AIII); alternatively, use of hygienic hand rubs is another acceptable means of maintaining hand hygiene (250, 251 ) . If gloves are worn, HCWs should put them on in the patient's room after hand washing and then discard them in the same patient's room before washing hands again after exiting the room. When worn, gloves should always be changed between patients or when soiled before touching a clean area (e.g., change gloves after touching the perineum and before going to a \"clean\" area) (AIII). Appropriate gloves should be used by all persons when handling potentially contaminated biological materials (AII). Items worn on the hands and fingers (e.g., rings or artificial nails [248, 252 ] ) and adhesive bandage strips, can create a nidus for pathogenic organisms that is difficult to clean. Thus, HCWs should avoid wearing such items whenever possible (BII).",

The source of Legionella infection should be identified and decontaminated or removed (AIII). Extensive hospital investigations of an isolated case of possible nosocomial LD might not be indicated if the patient has had limited contact with the inpatient center during most of the incubation period (CIII). Because HSCT recipients are at much higher risk for disease and death from legionellosis compared with other hospitalized persons (274 ) , periodic routine culturing for Legionellae in water samples from the center's potable water supply could be regarded as part of an overall strategy for preventing LD in HSCT centers (CIII). However, the optimal methodology (i.e., frequency or number of sites) for environmental surveillance cultures in HSCT centers has not been determined, and the cost-effectiveness of this strategy has not been evaluated. Because HSCT recipients are at high risk for LD and no data were found to determine a safe concentration of Legionellae organisms in potable water, the goal, if environmental surveillance for Legionellae is undertaken, should be to maintain water systems with no detectable organisms (AIII). Physicians should suspect legionellosis among HSCT recipients with nosocomial pneumonia even when environmental surveillance cultures do not yield Legionellae (AIII).

All protective clothing (e.g., gown, gloves, surgical mask, and eye protection) should be put on when entering a patient's room and discarded in the same room before exiting; protective clothing should always be changed between patient rooms (140 ) (AIII). When caring for an HSCT recipient or candidate undergoing conditioning therapy with URI or LRI, HCWs and visitors should change gloves and wash hands a) after contact with a patient; b) after handling respiratory secretions or objects contaminated with secretions from one patient and before contact with another patient, object, or environmental surface; and c) between contacts with a contaminated body site and the respiratory tract of or respiratory device used on the same patient (140 ) (AII). This practice is critical because most respiratory infections are usually transmitted by contact, particularly by hand to nose and eye. Therefore just wearing a mask, without appropriate hand washing, glove-wearing, or use of eye protection is insufficient to prevent transmission of CRV infections.",

Even when no nosocomial or community outbreak of CRV infections exists, all persons who enter the HSCT center should be screened daily for URI symptoms, including visitors and HCWs (BIII). Researchers also describe systems where HCWs provide daily verification (e.g., using sign-in sheets) that they are free of URI symptoms before being allowed to provide HSCT patient care. HCWs and visitors with URI symptoms should be restricted from contact with HSCT recipients and candidates undergoing conditioning therapy to minimize the risk for CRV transmission (131 ) (AIII). All HCWs with URI symptoms should be restricted from patient contact and reassigned to nonpatient care duties until the HCW's symptoms resolve (BIII). Visitors with URI symptoms should be asked to defer their visit to the HSCT center (131 ) until their URI symptoms resolve (BIII).",

Appropriate samples include nasopharyngeal washes, swabs, aspirates, throat swabs, and BAL fluid. This practice is critical because preemptive treatment of certain CRVs (e.g., influenza and RSV) (133 ) might prevent severe disease and death among HSCT recipients. Viral shedding among HSCT recipients with CRV infection has been reported to last \u00a34 months for influenza (143 ) , \u00a32 years for adenovirus (305, 306 ) , and \u00a322 days for RSV (136 ) ; however, RSV viral shedding has been reported to last 112 days in a child with severe combined immunodeficiency (307 ) . Therefore, to prevent nosocomial transmission of CRV (136 ) , HSCT center HCWs should recognize that prolonged CRV shedding can occur when determining the duration of appropriate precautions for CRV-infected HSCT recipients or candidates undergoing conditioning therapy (CIII). HSCT centers should use serial testing by using cultures from nasopharyngeal swabs, throat swabs or aspirates, or rapid antigen tests to help determine whether patients have stopped shedding influenza virus (BIII). Researchers have proposed that HSCT physicians conduct routine CRV surveillance among HSCT recipients to detect outbreaks and implement infection control measures as early as possible (CIII). During RSV season, HSCT recipients and candidates with signs or symptoms should be tested for RSV infection (i.e., the presence of RSV antigen in respiratory secretions tested by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and viral culture) starting with admission to the HSCT center. All patients who are RSV-antigen positive should be treated as a cohort during nosocomial RSV outbreaks because this practice reduces nosocomial RSV transmission (130,131 ) (BII). Symptomatic HCWs should be excluded from patient contact until symptoms resolve. HCWs and visitors with infectious conjunctivitis should be restricted from direct patient contact until the drainage resolves (i.e., usually, 5-7 days for adenovirus) and the ophthalmology consultant concurs that the infection and inflammation have resolved (268 ) (AII) to avoid possible transmission of adenovirus to HSCT recipients.",

Also, physicians can administer a tuberculin skin test (TST) using the Mantoux method with five tuberculin units of purified protein derivative (CIII); but because of a patient's immunocompromise, this test might not be reliable. If a TST is administered, either the Tubersol \u00ae or Aplisol \u00ae formulation of purified protein derivative can be used (244, 308 ) . Persons with a recently positive TST or a history of a positive TST and no prior preventive therapy should be administered a chest radiograph and evaluated for active TB (309 ) (AI). For immunocompromised persons, a positive TST is defined as \u22485 mm of induration (309, 310 ) because of their decreased ability to mount a delayed hypersensitivity response (CIII). Because immunosuppressive therapy decreases the sensitivity of the TST, HSCT physicians should not rely solely on the TST to determine whether latent TB infection is present and whether preventive therapy should be administered to HSCT recipients or candidates (DIII). Instead, a full 9-month course of isonicotinic acid hydrazide preventive therapy should be administered to immunocompromised HSCT recipients or candidates who have been substantially exposed to someone with active, infectious (i.e., sputum-smear positive) pulmonary or laryngeal TB, regardless of the HSCT recipient's or candidate's TST status (309 ) (BIII). A full 9-month course of isonicotinic acid hydrazide preventive therapy should also be administered to HSCT recipients or candidates with a positive TST who were not previously treated and have no evidence of active TB disease (309 ) (AIII) (Appendix). Routine anergy screening might not be reliable among HSCT recipients and candidates undergoing conditioning therapy and, therefore, is not recommended (DIII).

In the absence of epidemiologic clusters of infections, HSCT center personnel should not perform routine periodic bacterial surveillance cultures of the HSCT center environment or of equipment or devices used for respiratory therapy, pulmonary-function testing, or delivery of inhalation anesthesia (140 ) (DIII). Researchers recommend that hospitals perform routine sampling of air, ceiling tiles, ventilation ducts, and filters to test for molds, particularly when construction or renovation occurs near or around the rooms of immunocompromised patients (167, 174 ) or when clinical surveillance demonstrates a possible increase in mold (i.e., aspergillosis) cases (CIII). Strategies that might decrease fungal spores in the ventilation system include eliminating access of birds (i.e., primarily pigeons) to air-intake systems, removing bird droppings from the air-intake ducts, and eliminating moss from the hospital roof (174 ) . Furthermore, in the absence of a nosocomial fungal outbreak, HSCT centers need not perform routine fungal cultures of devices and dust in the rooms of HSCT recipients and candidates undergoing conditioning therapy (DIII). HSCT center personnel should routinely perform surveillance for the number of aspergillosis cases occurring among HSCT recipients, particularly during hospital construction or renovation (BIII).

However, drinking well water from municipal wells serving highly populated areas is regarded as safe from bacterial contamination because the water is tested \u22482 times/day for bacterial contamination. If HSCT recipients consume tap water, they should routinely monitor mass media (e.g., radio, television, or newspapers) in their area to immediately implement any boil-water advisories that might be issued for immunocompromised persons by state or local governments (BIII). A boil-water advisory means that all tap water should be boiled for \u22481 minutes before it is consumed. Tap water might not be completely free of Cryptosporidium. To eliminate the risk for Cryptosporidium exposure from tap water, HSCT recipients can boil tap water for \u22481 minutes before consuming it (e.g., drinking or brushing teeth) (5 ) (CIII). Alternately, they can use certain types of water filters (316 ) or a home distiller (317 ) to reduce their risk for Cryptosporidium (5 ) and other waterborne pathogens (CIII). If a home water filter* is used, it should be capable of removing particles \u22481 \u00b5m in diameter, or filter by reverse osmosis. However, the majority of these filters are not capable of removing smaller microbes (e.g., bacteria or viruses), and therefore, should only be used on properly treated municipal water. Further, the majority of these devices would not be appropriate for use on an unchlorinated private well to control viral or bacterial pathogens. Bottled water can be consumed if it has been processed to remove Cryptosporidium by one of three processes -reverse osmosis, distillation, or 1-\u00b5m particulate absolute filtration. To confirm that a specific bottled water has undergone one of these processes, HSCT recipients should contact the bottler directly. \u2020 Patients can take other precautions in the absence of boilwater advisories to further reduce their risk for cryptosporidiosis. These extra precautions include avoiding fountain beverages and ice made from tap water at restaurants, bars, and theaters (5 ), fruit drinks made from frozen concentrate mixed with tap water, and iced tea or coffee made with tap water (317 ). Drinks that are likely to be Cryptosporidium safe for HSCT recipients include nationally distributed brands of bottled or canned carbonated soft drinks and beers (5 ); commercially packaged noncarbonated drinks that contain fruit juice; fruit juices that do not require refrigeration until after opening (e.g., those that are stored unrefrigerated on grocery shelves) (5 ); canned or bottled soda, seltzer or fruit drinks; steaming hot (\u2248175 F) tea or coffee (317 ); juices labeled as pasteurized; and nationally distributed brands of frozen fruit juice concentrate that are reconstituted with water from a safe source (5 ) . HSCT recipients should not drink unpasteurized milk or fruit or vegetable juices (e.g., apple cider or orange juice) to avoid infection with Brucella species, Es. coli O157:H7, Salmonella species, Cryptosporidium, and others (319,347-351 ) (DII).",

One study determined that HSCT center personnel used 3-11 different vaccination schedules per vaccine (374 ) ; consequently, the study authors requested national guidelines for doses and timing of vaccines after HSCT to eliminate confusion among HSCT center personnel regarding how to vaccinate their patients. To address this need, an interim vaccination schedule for HSCT recipients was drafted in collaboration with partner organizations, including CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. The purpose of the vaccination schedule in these guidelines is to provide guidance for HSCT centers (Table 4 ). Although limited data were found regarding safety and immunogenicity (e.g., serologic studies of antibody titers after vaccination) among HSCT recipients, no data were found regarding vaccine efficacy among HSCT recipients (e.g., which determine whether vaccinated HSCT recipients have decreased attack rates of disease compared with unvaccinated HSCT recipients). Because certain HSCT recipients have faster immune system recovery after HSCT than others, researchers have proposed that different vaccination schedules be recommended for recipients of different types of HSCT. However, to date, data are too limited to do so. Therefore, the same vaccination schedule is recommended for all HSCT recipients (e.g., allogeneic, autologous, and bone marrow, peripheral, or UCB grafts) until additional data are published. In the tables, vaccines have only been recommended for use among HSCT recipients if evidence exists of safety and immunogenicity for those recipients. Vaccination of family *Broviac dolls are used to demonstrate medical procedures (e.g., insertion of catheters) to children to lessen their fears.",

This section provides strategies for the HSCT physician to minimize transmission of infectious diseases, whenever possible, from donors to recipients.* \u2020 Whether to select a donor who is at risk for or who has an infectious disease transmissible by HSCT, should be determined on a case-by-case basis (AIII) and is the final responsibility of the HSCT physician (AIII). If the only possible donor is at risk for or known to be infected with a bloodborne pathogen and the patient is likely to succumb rapidly from his or her disease if an HSCT is not received, the physician must carefully weigh the risks and benefits of using potentially infected donor cells. No person should be denied a potentially life-saving HSCT procedure solely on the basis of the risk for an infectious disease. However, HSCT physicians should avoid transplanting any infected or infectious donor hematopoietic stem cell product unless no other stem cell product can be obtained and the risk for death from not undergoing transplantation is deemed to be greater than the risk for morbidity or death from the infection that could potentially be transmitted (DII). If such a product is selected for use, it should be done on a case-by-case basis (375 ) and the following should be noted in the recipient's chart:",

Quality improvement programs and procedure manuals of collection centers, cell-processing laboratories, and transplant programs should include strategies for preventing transplant-associated infections. For example, collection centers should use aseptic techniques when collecting marrow, peripheral blood, and UCB hematopoietic stem cells (376,378 ) (AIII). Whenever possible, closed systems should be used for pooling hematopoietic stem cells during a collection procedure (BIII) because higher rates of microbial contamination seen in marrow harvests versus blood stem cell collections can be caused by use of open collecting systems (375, 403, 404 ) . The highest risk for extraneous microbial contamination of hematopoietic stem cells occurs during extensive manipulation and processing in the laboratory (404, 405 ) . Po-tential sources include unprotected hands and laboratory equipment and freezers (406 ) , particularly the liquid phases of liquid nitrogen freezers (407 ) . Therefore, stem cell processing should be performed according to current standards (378 ) using approved manufacturing practices (AIII). Hematopoietic stem cell units thawed in a water bath should be enclosed in a second bag (i.e., double-bagged technique) to prevent contamination of the ports or caps from unsterile bath water (407 ) (BIII). Additionally, water baths should be cleaned routinely (BIII) and certain researchers have proposed that the bath contain sterile water (407 ) (CIII).

If oral polio vaccine is inadvertently administered to a household contact of an HSCT recipient, ACIP's and the American Academy of Pediatrics' recommendations should be followed to minimize close contact with the immunocompromised person for 4-6 weeks after vaccination (Sources: American Academy of Pediatrics.

Although vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis has not been reported among HSCT recipients after exposure to household contacts inadvertently vaccinated with oral polio vaccine, inactivated polio vaccine should be used among family members, close contacts, and HCWs to avoid person-to-person transmission of vaccine-strain polio virus (Source: CDC. Poliomyelitis prevention in the United States: introduction of a sequential vaccination schedule of inactivated poliovirus vaccine followed by oral poliovirus vaccine; recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices [ACIP]. MMWR 1997;46[No. RR-3]:1-25). \u2020 \u2020 No evidence exists that live-attenuated vaccine-strain viruses in measles-mumps-rubella vaccine have ever been transmitted from person-to-person, except rubella vaccine virus from a nursing mother to her infant (Source: CDC.

Ideally, varicella-zoster-susceptible HCWs, family members, household contacts, and potential visitors of immunocompromised HSCT recipients should be vaccinated as soon as the decision to perform an HSCT is made. The vaccination dose or doses should be completed \u22954 weeks before the conditioning regimen begins or \u22956 weeks (42 days) before contact with the HSCT recipient is planned (BIII).
