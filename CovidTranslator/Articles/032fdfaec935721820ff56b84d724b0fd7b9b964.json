The aim of this study was to identify protein biomarkers of food allergy in mice exposed to ovomucoid (OVM), a major food allergen found in chicken egg white. BALB/c mice were repeatedly sensitized by gavage with OVM and cholera toxin (CT) and control mice were exposed to a mixture of amino acids with CT. At the endpoint, all mice were challenged intraperitoneally with OVM and alum. Type-1 hypersensitivity was confirmed in OVM-sensitized mice by observation of clinical signs of anaphylaxis and elevated levels of plasma histamine, OVM-specific IgE and OVM-specific IgG by ELISA. Differential protein expression was assessed in albumin-depleted plasma as well as in mesenteric lymph node, liver, spleen, and ileum by two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE). Differentially expressed proteins were identified by liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry. Plasma proteins overexpressed in OVM-sensitized mice included haptoglobin (41-fold), serum amyloid A (19-fold) and peroxiredoxin-2 (1.9-fold). Further validation of these plasma proteins in other animal models of food allergy with different food allergens is required to assess their potential as candidate biomarkers for use in evaluating the allergenicity of novel foods.",

Adults are most often affected from eating fish or shellfish (2.3%) while infants frequently develop allergies to eggs 1.6% and milk 1.1% (Eggesbo et al., 2001a,b; Sicherer et al., 2004) . Although most food allergies in humans cause mild reactions, on rare occasions they can be fatal and are now the leading cause of anaphylaxis in many countries (Sampson, 2003) . Current knowledge of allergens, tolerance, effector mechanisms and predisposing conditions does not allow for accurate prediction of allergenicity in humans without food trials or prior accidental exposure. Consequently, there has been recent heightened interest to develop a validated animal model to objectively assess the allergenicity of foods for safety testing and immunotherapy development. While various models of human food allergy have been investigated none have yet been validated (Knippels and Penninks, 2005) .",

Antigen-specific IgE titers have excellent positive predictive value for clinical allergic reactivity in individuals with markedly increased titers but poor negative predictive value in those with low titers, necessitating food trials for these individuals (Sampson, 2005) . Moreover, analysis of IgE titers and passive cutaneous skin assays require repetitive prior exposure for development of sensitization. Thus, there is a need for a rapid and accurate screening assay with a high negative predictive value of allergenicity for the valuation of allergenicity of novel foods or the effects of novel food processing methods on common foods. These biomarkers should be derived from reliable, validated, and relevant animal models and should be quantifiable and proportional to the degree of allergenicity of the food and should be detectable during both sensitization and post-challenge anaphylaxis. Newly identified biomarkers may eventually be used in an allergy screening panels with known mediators of allergy including histamine, antigen-specific IgE, and IL-4. Panels of biomarkers would then require validation with different food allergens in various animal models before applying them to the safety testing of novel foods.",

Absolute quantification of OVM-specific IgE and IgG was not performed as OVM-specific monoclonal antibodies are not available commercially for use in standard curves or as positive controls. Microtiter plates were coated with 100 ll (5 lg/ml) of purified OVM in 50 mM sodium bicarbonate buffer, pH 9.6, overnight at 4\u00b0C.

Using 2D-DIGE, we have identified three proteins, namely Hp, SAA2, and PrxII, that are overexpressed in plasma of OVM-sensitized mice during OVM-induced anaphylaxis. There was no significant alteration in protein expression in liver, spleen, ileum and mesenteric lymph nodes associated with OVM treatment. These results indicate that increased expression of these specific acute phase and antioxidant proteins may represent important biomarkers for assessing the allergic potential of food in mice.",

Hp is commonly known for its role as a scavenger of hemoglobin, which is a proinflammatory product of hemolysis. In addition, Hp is angiogenic (Cid et al., 1993) , and strongly anti-inflammatory (Arredouani et al., 2005) , through modulation of macrophage function (Baseler and Burrell, 1983) and inhibition of granulocyte chemotaxis and phagocytosis (Rossbacher et al., 1999) . Hp receptors have been discovered on monocytes, macrophages, granulocytes, natural killer cells, B and T lymphocytes, and mast cells, which reflects the multifaceted immunosuppressive effect of this APP (Arredouani et al., 2005) . While the role of Hp in allergic reactions is unclear, Hp preferentially and strongly inhibits the release of Th2 cytokines in mice thereby promoting a Th1-dominant cellular response (Arredouani et al., 2003) . Similarily, Hp\u00c0/\u00c0 mice are more prone to asthma (Arredouani et al., 2005) . Therefore, it is possible that BALB/c mice, with their genetic predisposition for Th2-biased responses, may release Hp to attenuate anaphylaxis. Because serum Hp is more easily assessed than highly labile cytokines, it may represent a useful indicator of anaphylaxis associated with exposure to food allergens.",

Peroxiredoxins previously named thioredoxin peroxidases, are intracellular antioxidants which function as scavengers of hydrogen peroxide and alkyl hydroperoxides by utilizing thioredoxin. Six distinct isozymes have been detected in a variety of mammalian cells including erythrocytes, skin, endothelium, and lymphocytes (Rhee et al., 2001) . The isozyme PrxII is highly expressed in erythrocytes and is believed to play a major role in protecting erythrocytes from oxidative stress (Lee et al., 2003b) . In this study, a possible confounding source of PrxII may be from complement-mediated hemolysis associated with anaphylaxis. However, complement activation was not confirmed in this study and its relationship to anaphylaxis in OVM-sensitized mice is not clear. Other reported functions of PrxII include enhancement of natural killer cell activity (Shau et al., 1994) , and inhibition of apoptosis (Zhang et al., 1997) . PrxII has been reported to be a novel marker of neoplasia, expressed in endothelial cells of benign and malignant human vascular tumors of the skin (Lee et al., 2003a) . PrxII has also been detected in the plasma of patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (Chen et al., 2004) . The role of PrxII in allergy is unclear but the results of the current study suggest that this protein may represent a potential biomarker of anaphylaxis.",

The presence of hemoglobin in the MS analysis of SAA2 (spot 1928) may represent contamination during spot picking considering SAA2 and hemoglobin differ by approximately 2 kDa. Of the three plasma proteins detected, Hp, with multiple receptor expression on various cell types and known immune-modulating functions, is likely the best candidate for use as a biomarker of allergic reactions. If serum Hp increases during the sensitization process, then this protein would have tremendous utility as a readily accessible biomarker to qualify and potentially quantify early subclinical allergic reactions. These protein changes, although detected during anaphylaxis, could have been elevated prior to OVM challenge, in response to successive gavages during sensitization. However, we did not assess changes in protein expression during sensitization when proteins were assumed to be highly labile and of low abundance. We felt that analysis at a point immediately post-challenge, when OVM hypersensitivity is highly amplified, would provide the greatest likelihood of detecting significant changes. We are currently investigating the expression of these biomarker proteins in time-course studies in other animal models of food allergy using different allergens and methodologies that are less labor-intensive than 2D-DIGE.",
