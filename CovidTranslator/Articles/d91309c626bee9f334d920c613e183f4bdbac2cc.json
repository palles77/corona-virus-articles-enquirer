IgG antibodies to T. gondii were detected in 10 serum samples from group 1 and in 10 serum samples from group 2, and in 2 aqueous humor samples from group 1 and in 1 aqueous humor samples from group 2. The distribution of ocular lesions according to the serological status of the animals indicated that lens luxation and buphthalmia were more frequent in T. gondii seropositive cats than in seronegative ones. The study reports a similar prevalence of anti-T. gondii antibodies in cats with uveitis and in cats without uveitis in France.

            "text": "The clinical manifestations in cats infected by Toxoplasma gondii are diverse with both fatal and sublethal chronic syndromes being reported. Intestinal toxoplasmosis, which results from the sexual replica-tion of the parasite in feline enterocytes, may lead to self-limiting diarrhoea. The diagnosis of intestinal toxoplasmosis is based on the detection of T. gondii oocysts in the faeces of the cats. When extra-intestinal toxoplasmosis is acquired transplacentally or by suckling in kittens, the condition is often clinically severe. Clinical signs include fever, dyspnoea, icterus and anorexia (Dubey and Lappin, 1998) . In these fatal cases, definitive diagnosis is made by histological www.elsevier.com/locate/vetpar Veterinary Parasitology 138 (2006) [362] [363] [364] [365] examination. Extra-intestinal toxoplasmosis may also be suspected in other cats with a more chronic course. The most frequent clinical finding in this form of disease is uveitis. Multifocal to diffuse retinochoroiditis, optic neuritis are signs of posterior uveitis whereas iritis, keratic precipitates, lens luxation and secondary glaucoma are present in anterior uveitis. Ocular toxoplasmosis may be unilateral or bilateral. It usually occurs alone in cats without any systemic signs of the disease (fever, dyspnoea or anorexia) (Davidson, 2000) .",

The interpretation of serological tests is not straightforward. Cats with uveitis are usually seropositive for T. gondii and other ocular pathogens such as feline leukaemia virus (FeLV), feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) and feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIP) (Lappin, 2000) .

Formalin-treated T. gondii tachyzoites agglutinate in the presence of diluted sera containing IgG and IgM antibodies. However, the use of the direct agglutination test for the detection of IgM antibodies is controversial because of the lack of specificity.

However, we did not detect anti-T. gondii antibodies in aqueous humor samples from cats with uveitis. This result is in accordance with previous studies (Lappin et al., 1996a) . The Goldmann-Witmer coefficient (Cvalue) can be helpful in evaluating the T. gondiispecific antibody in aqueous humor (Hill et al., 1995) . A C-value > 1 is suggestive of local production of T. gondii-specific antibody in aqueous humor and potentially ocular toxoplasmosis. In our study, the C-value was not calculated because we did not have the opportunity to obtain the dosage of total antibody titres for all the animals we examined. PCR on aqueous humor seems to be more predictable of the disease but not enough to conclude on an ocular toxoplasmosis (Lappin et al., 1996b) .",
