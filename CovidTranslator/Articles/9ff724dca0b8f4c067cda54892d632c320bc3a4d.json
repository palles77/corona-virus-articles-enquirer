For example it can contain approximately 10-kb foreign gene without affecting viral duplication and assembling [19] . So, several genes necessary for viral assembly could be simultaneously inserted into vector to produce the VLPs. The VLPs produced in baculovirus expression system was found to be safe and immunogenic. Therefore the system is a good candidate for producing VLPs [5, [20] [21] [22] . Compared with AcNPV-Sf cell expression system, silkworm-baculovirus expression system has its own advantages. The silkworm larvae, which can be used for in vivo expression, and the expression yield in silkworm haemolymph could be at least 50 folds higher than that in the same volume infected cells. In addition, silkworm does not contain any pathogen that can crossly infect with vertebrate, and silkworm rearing is cost-effective (0.8 $ per 100 larva) in China. The production-cost is one of the important limited factors restricting new type subunit FMD vaccine in the market. In this study even a gene about 6.9 kb could yield high level of antigen in haemolymph, and the expression products were post-translationally processed and assembled well. This leads to the conclusion that it is feasible to employ silkworm-baculovirus expression system for large scale production of FMD vaccine.",

In this vaccine trial, we followed the bovine potency test protocol described by the OIE and used by vaccine manufacturers to test the traditional inactivated FMD vaccines with some modifications to test this subunit vaccine potency. Four cattle were vaccinated with the vaccine prepared from Bm-ORF's and two controls were vaccinated with vaccine prepared from Bm-BacPAK6's. Three weeks after vaccination, the antibody level of the four vaccinated cattle has some ascension, while the control group remained low. After been challenged with virulent homologous virus, two of the Bm-ORF's subunit vaccine immunized cattle were considered to be protected, and the other two delayed the disease and eased the clinical symptom. But the controls developed lesions on all the feet and inside the mouth on the third day post infection. Since the cattle are the most susceptible cloven-hoof animal to FMDV and the challenge dose could be 10000 BID 50 , the vaccine in cattle can hardly get ideal efficacy. Only adenovirus vectored vaccine known for its best protective effects can keep vaccinated cattle at 5/5 [10] . But this vaccine is unacceptable in developing countries because of safety and preservation problems. The antibody titers are obviously different between animals in this experiment, which might be due to the following reasons. (1) The specific antigen produced in silkworm haemolymph per milliliter was still lower than that contained in traditional inactivated vaccine, thus failing to offer enough protection to animals. (2) The uneven distribution of antigen in the preparation process by manual preparation is likely to lead to the difference in immunity dosage to each animal. (3) Although the humoral immunity plays a main role in the course of FMDV anti-infection immunity, the factors of cellular immunity may also play a part in anti-virus immunity. To overcome these shortcomings and enhance the immune response, some work is yet to be done to improve the quantity of the expression products, such as concentrate antigen (or enhance efficiency of expression system), delete the unnecessary regions of ORF that were irrespective of synthesis, process and assemble viral structural proteins into empty viral capsids, and introduce cellular immunity factor for successful preparation of new type FMD.",
