The term 'Baiping' is composed of two Chinese characters -'bai' (to place, to put, to arrange, etc.) and 'ping' (flat, uniform, fair, etc.) . The original meaning of Baiping is 'to put flat; or to arrange uniform'. The term had been so informal before the twenty-first century that even the 1999 edition of Cihai -the largest and most influential Chinese dictionary published by Shanghai Cishu Publishing House -didn't mention it. Notice that the frequently used Baiping has extended from its original meaning to 'to treat fairly', 'to compromise', 'to tradeoff', 'to punish' and so on. After the death of Deng Xiaoping in 1997, Jiang Zemin must deftly play its various wings against each other. In this scenario, Li Peng, Chairman of the eighth National People's Congress (NPC), was selected to hold the No. 2 post of the CCPCC, higher than that of Zhu Rongji, Premier of the State Council, during the 1998-2003 tenure.

Disputes were settled through relationship-based methods such as mediation. The court system was undeveloped and rarely used. After 1949, a Marxist-Leninist overlay was constructed, which was also to some extent mixed with traditional adherence to Confucian-based conflict mediation. It was not until the economic reforms of the late 1970s that a true institutional legal system was introduced, mostly to deal with the demands of the growing economy. As the CCP scrambled after 1978 to train lawyers and codify laws, business law took precedence over laws pertaining to civil liberties and individual freedoms. Despite an enormous growth in the legal industry, the system is today still grossly lacking in its neutrality, capacity, and mandate, especially in poor and remote areas in China. Most importantly, China's legal system lacks neutrality. The CCP approves all court appointments, and judges are technically responsible to the Party, not to the people (see Box 5.1). From the Basic, Intermediate, Higher Level People's Court, and Supreme People's Court, the CCP hand is evident. The CCP's Political and Legal Committee has the power to intervene in deliberations, and even to overturn verdicts issued. In addition, the infrastructure lacks capacity. For example, there is one lawyer per 10,000 people in China (the ratio is one lawyer per 550 people in the United States). 5 And finally, in many Western democracies, the ultimate arbiter of a law's constitutionality is the court system. In China, this function becomes muddled and the CCP apparatus often rules on the interpretation of its own laws.",

The imperfectly implemented village elections law and the elections that have been held under the law allow much bounded participation, monitor potentially explosive peasant discontent, and strengthen the capacity of the regime. These 'elections serve these functions by sometimes weeding out the most ineffective and despised agents of the regime and by recruiting new cadres who can command popular support as well as their superiors' confidence' (deLisle, 2008, p. 198). 6 Most tangible reform in China's legal system has taken place in the area of civil litigation. These primarily concern business disputes associated with China's rapid economic modernization in which people seek protection and redress from a wide array of abuses committed in the pursuit of economic competitive advantage: patent infringement, business transactions that are not honored, individuals who have been displaced by private and state-directed construction, and labor disputes, to name a few. Since 1978, prompted by the need to provide a safe environment for foreign capital, the CCP has increasingly codified business laws and sought to train its lawyers and judges to deal effectively and efficiently with the growing civil and commercial caseload.

It is sometimes used in a narrower sense to refer to economic reforms that were prescribed just for developing nations, which included advice to reduce government deficits, to liberalize and deregulate international trade and cross border investment, and to pursue export led growth (Williamson, 1989). 7 In 2004, Joshua Cooper Ramo, the former foreign editor of Time magazine, in his book entitled The Beijing Consensus, argues that there is a new 'Beijing Consensus' emerging with distinct attitudes to politics, development, and the global balance of power. Ramo argues that China offers hope to developing countries after the collapse of the Washington Consensus. China has provided, more or less, a more equitable paradigm of economic take-off for poor countries. According to Ramo, '[the Beijing Consensus] replaces the widely-discredited Washington Consensus, an economic theory made famous in the 1990s for its prescriptive, Washington-knows-best approach to telling other nations how to run themselves' (Ramo, 2004, p. 4) .",

This new approach to foreign aid, combined with admiration for China's economic success, is boosting its world influence, as well as access to energy and other natural resources. Meanwhile, China's autocratic leadership, which shows no sign of liberalizing, has set the foundation for future economic successes; by contrast, US economic progress seems hindered by its democratic processes (Halper, 2010 (Song, 2010) .

Chinese mismanagement of the outbreak has plainly exposed just how far political reform has lagged behind economic development. Beijing's long concealment of the truth is exposing political faultiness by simultaneously weakening the economy and damaging the government's credibility. The crisis has undermined traditional supporters, aggravating old demographic strains, and emboldening detractors to make more assertive protests against government policy. While the growing pressure from a more demanding public and an increasingly interdependent world has forced China to re-evaluate its political and socioeconomic policies, the extent of any resulting political reform depends upon whether or not the enhanced incentives for accountability and transparency among public officials override the traditional incentives for party and factional loyalty. 8. From November 2002 to 2003 , SARS infected over 8,000 people in 30 countries and killed more than 500. In addition to the human toll, it was inflicting significant economic damage across Asia.

This is the so-called socialism with Chinese characteristics and the one that distinguishes China from Western democracies in which the court system is a critical component of the checks and balances placed on the other branches of government. In fact, China's lack of an independent judicial system exacerbates all the other fault lines running through the authoritarian state; there simply is no effective recourse available to individuals whose interests are harmed by the excesses of CCP officials, laws, and institutions. This situation is particularly serious in China's rural, marginal areas. The time when the average individual seeks a forum in which to officially air grievances and pursue some form of justice in China has yet to come (see Box 5.2).",

But when the sickness penetrates into the bone marrow, it becomes fatal and nothing can be done about it. Now, as the Duke has come to that last stage, I have nothing to recommend.' Five days after that, the Duke felt pains and ordered his men to look for Bianque, but to find that he had fled to the state of Qin. Soon afterwards, the Duke died.",
