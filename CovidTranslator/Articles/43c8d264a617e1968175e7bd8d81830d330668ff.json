The diversity of current delivery materials remains limited, in part because of their slow, multi-step syntheses. Here we describe a new class of lipid-like delivery molecules, termed lipidoids, as delivery agents for RNAi therapeutics. Chemical methods were developed to allow the rapid synthesis of a large library of over 1,200 structurally diverse lipidoids. From this library, we identified lipidoids that facilitate high levels of specific silencing of endogenous gene transcripts when formulated with either double-stranded small interfering RNA (siRNA) or single-stranded antisense 2\u2032-O-methyl (2\u2032-O Me) oligoribonucleotides targeting microRNA (miRNA). The safety and efficacy of lipidoids were evaluated in three animal models: mice, rats and nonhuman primates. The studies reported here suggest that these materials may have broad utility for both local and systemic delivery of RNA therapeutics.",

Conventional lipid synthesis typically requires individually optimized, multiplestep synthesis, including time-intensive procedures such as chemical protection and deprotection, use and removal of catalysts, solvent exchanges and purification 26 . The customization of each synthetic reaction and the multiple steps required limit throughput and, correspondingly, limit the ability to generate substantial library size and diversity. To address these problems, we developed chemical methods capable of rapid, parallel generation of lipid-like molecules ( Fig. 1 and Supplementary Methods online).",

Based on this data set, we synthesized a second-generation library of 500 lipidoids, expanding the structures tested based on these trends. In particular, we hypothesized that a number of these design features could enrich the library with effective materials. Specifically, we expanded the library to include lipidoids with even shorter amide tails (e.g., N 11 , N 9 ), and more head units (e.g., monomers 109-117). Because many of these head units have the potential to form more than two tails, lipidoids were resynthesized with varied reaction stoichiometry to generate lipidoids with a diverse number of tails.",

Notably, the top performing lipidoids in this second library contained several structural similarities: (i) amide linkages, (ii) more than two alkyl tails, (iii) tail length in the range of 8-12 carbons and (iv) one tail short of total substitution of the amine reactants, therefore containing one secondary amine. These relatively short tails are surprising in comparison to typical gene delivery lipids such as DOTAP and DOTMA, which contain 18 aliphatic carbon atoms 26 .

In vitro analysis shows that, in general, both lipidoids and commercial lipids are relatively noncytotoxic at the concentration ranges in which they are efficacious ( Supplementary Fig. 1a-d online) . Notably, these lipidoids performed differently in the different cell types. Whereas all materials were able to facilitate good silencing at the highest siRNA levels, the commercial reagents Lipofectamine RNAiMAX and Lipofectamine 2000 were able to facilitate greater silencing at the lowest siRNA levels in HeLa and HepG2 cells. In contrast, with primary bone marrow-derived macrophages, lipidoids were more effective delivery vehicles at low siRNA concentrations. Dose-dependent silencing of green fluorescent protein (GFP) expression was observed for 6 of the 7 lipidoids tested with 50% silencing observed even at a 1-nM siRNA concentration (Fig. 2e) . In contrast Lipofectamine 2000 and Lipofectamine RNAiMAX were not effective at silencing GFP expression even at higher siRNA concentrations (Fig. 2e) . Whereas the overall silencing at low complex concentrations in HeLa and HepG2 cells lines is less than with commercial reagents, these lipidoids provide for more effective silencing in primary bone marrow-derived macrophages. This library approach provides a substantial number of new materials that may be useful for transfecting cells that have thus far proven refractory to transfection by currently available reagents.",

The liver represents an attractive organ for therapeutic intervention, because of the number of potential hepatic targets and the highly perfused nature of the organ, which may render it more amenable to delivery of exogenous siRNAs. Using a liver-directed in vivo screen of the lipidoid libraries, we identified a series of compounds that facilitate high levels of siRNA-mediated gene silencing in hepatocytes, the cells comprising the liver parenchyma. Factor VII, a blood clotting factor, is an ideal target gene for assaying functional siRNA delivery to liver. Because this factor is produced specifically in hepatocytes, gene silencing indicates successful delivery to parenchyma, as opposed to delivery to the cells of the reticulo-endothelial system (e.g., Kupffer cells). Furthermore, Factor VII is a secreted protein that can be readily measured in serum, obviating the need to euthanize animals. Finally, because of the protein's short half-life (2-5 h), silencing at the mRNA level is manifest as silencing at the protein level with minimal lag.",

At least seven lipidoid formulations were identified that mediated significant reduction of serum Factor VII protein levels, with the largest reduction observed for 98N 12 (>90%) (Fig. 3a) . Five variants of 98N 12 containing different tail numbers were purified and tested individually ( Supplementary Fig. 2 online). 98N 12 -5 (5-tail) was found to be optimal for in vivo delivery. To verify the specificity of gene silencing, liver mRNA levels were measured for both Factor VII and another hepatocyte-expressed gene, apolipoprotein B (Apob) (Fig. 3b) . In animals treated with formulations containing siFVII, only silencing of the Factor VII mRNA was observed. Conversely, in animals treated with formulations containing Apob-specific siRNA (siApoB), only silencing of the Apob mRNA was observed. Further, administration of a lipidoid-formulated 1:1 (wt/wt) mixture of the two siRNAs resulted in silencing of both Factor VII and Apob genes with no detectable loss in potency or competition between siRNAs. No silencing of Factor VII was observed when a mismatch Factor VII siRNA was used (data not shown).

Whereas 'naked' siRNA provided roughly one log reduction in viral plaques, 98N 12 -5-formulated siRNA at the same dose provided greater than two log reduction in viral plaques. These data demonstrate that lipidoids can be used in nonsystemic applications of RNAi technology and are capable of delivering siRNA to nonhepatic cell types.",

Prior studies have demonstrated successful silencing in lung models using delivery reagents; however, in contrast to our results, these cases did not demonstrate substantial improvement in silencing over that achieved with naked siRNA 5,6 . We note that gene silencing in lung continues to be difficult to achieve, even with the best available lung delivery formulations 27 . In addition, to our knowledge, there are currently no other reagents available that have demonstrated specific, endogenous gene silencing in peritoneal macrophages.

At 4 h after siRNA instillation, the mice were anesthetized and infected i.n. with 10 6 plaque-forming units (PFU) of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)/A2 or RSV/B1. Before removal of lungs at day 4 after infection, anesthetized mice were exsanguinated by severing the right caudal artery. Lung tissue was collected on ice in PBS (Invitrogen) to determine virus titers. RSV titers from lungs were measured by immunostaining plaque assay. Lungs were homogenized with a hand-held Tissumiser homogenizer (Fisher Scientific). The lung homogenates were placed on ice for 5-10 min to allow debris to settle. Clarified lung lysates were diluted tenfold in serum-free DMEM, added to 95% confluent Vero E6 cells cultured in DMEM in 24-well plates, and incubated for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C, followed by 2% methylcellulose overlay. At 5 d post-infection, the medium was removed and the cells were fixed with acetone/methanol (60:40) and immunostained. Plaques were counted and log (10) PFU/g lung versus PBS or siRNA mismatch control was determined.",

Lipidoids were optimized for delivery using four lipidoid/siRNA ratios: 5:1, 10:1, 15:1 and 20:1. Materials were tested in quadruplicate. Data are presented for the optimal siRNA/lipidoid wt/wt ratio for each lipidoid, including s.d. This data set includes only lipidoids with no significant cytoxicity, as assessed by no significant change in Renilla luciferase expression relative to untreated cells.

Liver RNA samples of three representative animals per treatment group are shown. The U6 signal serves as RNA input control. Animals treated with antagomir122 show a marked decrease of miR-122 signal (lanes 7-9). Even further reduction of miR-122 signal is observed for lipidoid-formulated anti-miR122treated animals (lanes 10-12). The mismatched control antagomir and anti-miR had little effect on miR-122 signals (lanes 4-6 and 13-15). (d) Derepression of miR-122 target genes after miR-122 inhibition in mice.
