Experimental vaccines, successfully tested in animals, have been prepared using immunogenes from influenza virus, hepatitis B virus and herpes simplex viru\u00a3 Apathogenic enteric bacteria have some potential as vectors, most probably against enteric pathogens, although the potential of viral vectors is likely to be realized firsL Parasitic worms and protozoa devastate millions of people. When the immunogens of these organisms have been identified there will be added impetus to investigate the potential of vector vaccines against these pathogen& Keywords: Vectors: bacterial vectors; viral vectors; vaccinia virus; immunogens: immunogenes For many years the term vector, the Latin word for a carrier or bearer, has meant for the biologist an agent transferring a parasite to a host. Invertebrate vectors come most readily to mind, for example, mosquitoes and tsetse flies transmitting the protozoans which cause malaria and sleeping-sickness, respectively. More recently the term has been applied to plasmids which have been manipulated by biologists to transfer selected genes for expression of bacteria and yeast cells. The papovavirus simian virus 40 (SV40) and bovine papilloma virus have been used as vectors in conjunction with eukaryotic cells. These vectors were used to transfer genes from other biological entities (foreign genes) to cells in vitro, either for fundamental research purposes or for the production of proteins which would subsequently be purified for prototype vaccines e.g, hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBsAg) from yeast 1-3, and foot and mouth disease virus VPI protein from Escherichia coli 4\"5.",

            "text": "The focus of attention at the moment is the vector potential of vaccinia virus, the vaccine virus which has eradicated smallpox. By viral standards the vaccinia virus DNA genome is enormous, comprising 180 000 base pairs. Some of the vaccinia virus genes are not essential for its replication. This fact raised the possibility that also demonstrated marker rescue using another deletion mutant of vaccinia virus. Panicali and PaolettP then showed that the TK gene from the unrelated herpes simplex virus (HSV) could be inserted into the genome of infectious vaccinia virus and that a functional TK enzyme was produced. Very soon afterwards Mackett et al. 9 presented similar findings, again exploiting the TK genes of vaccinia virus and HSV. Thus it had been shown that vaccinia virus was a very useful selectable cloning and expression vector. The potential of this vector for vaccine purposes was not lost on either group.",

Another advantage of vaccinia virus is that it has been used highly effectively in its own right as a vaccine to eradicate smallpox. Its large genome permits the inclusion of large amounts of DNA. The construction of stable and infectious recombinants containing more than 20 000 bases of foreign DNA have been claimed by both American groups.

The poultry industry would seem to be a suitable one in which to use vectors. Chickens are kept at very high stocking densities and this is conducive to the spread of infectious diseases. Vaccines and drugs are essential for intensive poultry keeping. However, the UK poultry industry spends only about 0.1% of its turnover on vaccines. Profit margins are very slim. Indeed, for much of 1983 the UK broiler growers sold at a loss. Thus vaccines must be cheap to buy. They should also be cheap to apply. Handling birds for individual vaccination is costly but for some vaccines this is currently unavoidable. Some live vaccines can be applied inexpensively in drinking water or by spray. They generally induce good immunity but can cause problems. Thus vaccine strains of avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV, a coronavirus) can cause damage to the oviduct and kidneys of chickens. IBV can also predispose young chickens to secondary infection by some strains ofE. coli, causing colisepticaemia. On multiage sites the vaccine virus may spread to very young chickens with deleterious effects. Inactivated virus vaccines are not associated with these problems i.e. they are safer, but they are costly to buy and apply. In the case of IBV the inactivated virus alone does not induce good protection.",

In many parts of the world fowl pox is a problem and a live pox virus vaccine is used for its control.

However, proteins of several viruses have been produced in t:~ coli. In the case of FMDV, when the resultant protein was inoculated into cattle and swine, they were protected against challenge with FMDV 5. Murray et al. s have reported that preparations of hepatitis B core antigen produced in t:~ coli were protective or reduced the severity of infection of chimpanzees with hepatitis B virus. Bacteria as vectors have potential advantages which warrant continued consideration. Innocuous I~L coli strains occur naturally in many animals. Technology for the large-scale production of bacteria is well developed. The bacteria would be expected to be more stable than many live virus vaccines, stability being an important attribute for any vaccine.

Other new approaches to vaccine production are currently being investigated: synthesis of proteins or peptides in bacteria, yeast or eukaryotic cells: chemical synthesis of peptides: rational manipulation of virus genomes: and development of more suitable adjuvants. Although it is most unlikely that the vector approach will be suitable for all diseases it does have several major potential advantages, some of which stem from experimental observations: immunogenes have been transferred to vaccinia virus: the genes were expressed: the immunogen had properties very similar to the immunogen derived from the 'parent virus'; inoculated animals did respond with protective immune responses.",

            "text": "was presented at the 'New Routes to Vaccine Prophylaxis' Symposium organized by the Biotechnology Group of the Society of Chemical Industry on 26 June 1984 immunogenes, from other viruses, might be inserted into the vaccinia DNA at one of the non-essential regions. If done appropriately transcription and translation of the immunogene might occur following infection of cells susceptible to vaccinia virus. Moreover, it would be expected that the resultant protein would induce immune responses following infection of an animal which was susceptible to vaccinia virus. The recent staggering advances in molecular biological techniques combined with the results of much fundamental research with poxviruses and other viruses have turned this possibility into reality. Among the requirements for the insertion and translation of an immunogene in vaccinia virus are: (1) the incorporation of the gene into a cloning vehicle e.g. a plasmid, so that sufficient quantities of DNA are available for transfection of vaccinia virus infected cells; (2) the presence in the plasmid, at both ends of the immunogene, of DNA sequences which are homologous to sequences in vaccinia virus, thus permitting recombination; (3) recombination should take place in a non-essential region of the vaccinia virus genome; (4) the immunogene must be adjacent to regulatory sequences recognized by vaccinia virus transcription machinery, for expression to occur. Volumes 79, 80 and 81 of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the USA contain papers which are milestones on the road to the production of vaccines based on eukaryotic viruses as vectors of immunogenes. The scene was set in 1982 with publication of four papers, two from the group of Bernard Moss of the National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, and two from Enzo Paoletti and colleagues at the New York State Department of Health, Albany. Weir et aL 6 showed that vaccinia virus which lacked the thymidine kinase (TK) gene (TK-virus) could be given a TK gene as a consequence of recombination with a plasmid containing the TK gene. The absence from the virus of the TK gene is a readily detectable mutation i.e. a genetic 'marker'; the recovery of the TK marker by the previously TK-virus is termed \"marker rescue'.
