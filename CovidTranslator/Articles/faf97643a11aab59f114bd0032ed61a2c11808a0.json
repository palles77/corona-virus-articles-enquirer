Those pseudotype vectors contained no additional attenuating mutations in the rVSV genome. Here we describe rVSV vectors containing a full complement of VSV genes and expressing the Ebola virus (EBOV) GP from an additional transcription unit. These rVSV vectors contain the same combination of attenuating mutations used previously in the clinical development pathway of an rVSV/human immunodeficiency virus type 1 vaccine. One of these rVSV vectors (N4CT1-EBOVGP1), which expresses membrane-anchored EBOV GP from the first position in the genome (GP1), elicited a balanced cellular and humoral GP-specific immune response in mice. Guinea pigs immunized with a single dose of this vector were protected from any signs of disease following lethal EBOV challenge, while control animals died in 7-9 days. Subsequently, N4CT1-EBOVGP1 demonstrated complete, single-dose protection of 2 macaques following lethal EBOV challenge. A single sham-vaccinated macaque died from disease due to EBOV infection. These results demonstrate that highly attenuated rVSV vectors expressing EBOV GP may provide safer alternatives to current EBOV vaccines.",

In nature, all but Reston virus have been isolated only in sub-Saharan Africa, where the likely virus reservoir is thought to be in bats [3, 4] . All but the Tai Forest and Reston viruses have caused sporadic, deadly outbreaks of disease in humans since the discovery of Ebolavirus 38 years ago, with case-fatality rates of 30%-90% [5, 6] . The ongoing 2014 Ebola virus (EBOV) outbreak in West Africa is the largest recorded, with case-fatality rates of around 50%. Hospitalization of patients seemingly improves clinical outcome and public health initiatives may slow the spread of disease, but mass vaccination programs in EBOV-endemic regions will likely be required to extinguish the current outbreak and prevent such occurrences in the future.",

In nature, VSV cycles between biting insects, which are the likely reservoir, and livestock [13] [14] [15] . The virus replicates to high titer in virus-induced vesicles at insect bite sites on the nose, lips, teats, and coronary bands of hooves. Disease in livestock is self-limiting and typically resolves in 10-11 days without significant consequences. VSV can also infect humans who have close contact with infected animals or purified virus [16, 17] . Infection results in mild influenza-like symptoms, which typically resolve in 3-5 days without complications [16, 17] . The very low seroprevalence of VSV in humans favored development of VSV as a vaccine vector and became feasible when Rose et al developed a system for recovery of rVSV from genomic complementary DNA (cDNA) [18] . Since then, rVSV vectors expressing antigens from human pathogens have demonstrated high levels of efficacy in the respective animal disease models [19] [20] [21] [22] .",

A highly attenuated rVSV vector expressing human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV) gag from the first position in the genome was developed and has been demonstrated to be safe in stringent mouse and nonhuman primate (NHP) neurovirulence and biodistribution studies [27] [28] [29] . This rVSV vector was attenuated by combining N gene translocation from position 1-4 (N4) in the genome and truncation of the G protein cytoplasmic tail (CT) from 29 amino acids (aa) in native form to 1 aa (CT1) [28, 30] . This N4CT1-HIVgag1 vector was subsequently shown to be safe and immunogenic in phase 1 clinical trials (HVTN 090 and HVTN 087; available at: http://clinicaltrials. gov/), and after vaccination viremia was undetectable by an VSV infectivity assay or a VSV-specific polymerase chain reaction assay in blood, urine, or saliva specimens obtained from trial participants (unpublished data).",

The N4CT1-HIVgag1 genomic cDNA was modified by exchanging the gag gene located in position 1 of the genome with the EBOVGP gene (1976, Mayinga isolate), generating N4CT1-EBOVGP1 cDNA (GP1; Figure 1A) . A vector expressing a third-position EBOVGP (GP3; Figure 1A ) was generated by inserting an expression cassette between the M and N genes. To insert the EBOVGP gene in genome position 6 (GP6; Figure 1A ), the N and G genes were swapped and an expression cassette was positioned between VSV L and the trailer sequence. For adventitious agent testing of clinical trial material, large quantities of EBOVGP-specific neutralizing antibody are required to neutralize vaccine virus infectivity. To avoid this requirement, a gene expressing secreted EBOVGP was generated by deleting the sequence encoding the transmembrane region and cytoplasmic tail (aa 651-676). This modified EBOVGP gene was inserted into position 1 of N4CT1 (GP1\u0394TM; Figure 1A ). The mucin-like domain of EBOVGP spans aa 305-485, and part of this domain (aa 374-465) was deleted (GP1\u0394muc; Figure 1A ). This modified EBOVGP gene was generated following observations that part of the mucin region was deleted upon multiple serial passage of N4CT1-EBOVGP1 on Vero cell monolayers and was included here to assess the effect of partial removal of the glycan \"coat\" on EBOVGP immunogenicity. EBOVGP expression was analyzed by Western blotting for all vectors ( Figure 1B ).",

The cell-mediated immune response was similar for secreted and anchored forms of EBOVGP, indicating that both forms of EBOVGP underwent a similar degree of processing and presentation of T-cell epitopes in antigen-presenting cells. Interestingly, there was a significant reduction in the cell-mediated immune response to EBOVGP when part of the mucin-rich region was deleted, possibly as a result of altered proteosomal processing of EBOVGP or direct deletion of T-cell epitopes. After decay of the primary cell-mediated immune response, a second vaccine dose boosted ELISpot responses to levels seen after primary vaccination; however, there was still no detectable cell-mediated immune response elicited by vectors expressing EBOVGP from position 3 and 6, indicating the requirement for higher EBOVGP levels in infected cells to generate detectable EBOVGP-specific cell-mediated immune responses.",

            "text": "As expected, the EBOVGP-specific IgG response in mice was greatest for N4CT1-EBOVGP1 and N4CT1-EBOVGP1\u0394muc vectors expressing the highest levels of EBOVGP from genome position 1. Interestingly, N4CT1-EBOVGP1\u0394TM elicited much lower levels of EBOVGP-specific IgG than N4CT1-EBOVGP1. We speculate this may reflect differences in the tertiary and quaternary structure of secreted EBOVGP, compared with the trimeric conformation achieved by anchored EBOVGP. Notably, the secreted EBOVGP described here is different from the naturally occurring secreted form of EBOVGP that is translated from unedited EBOVGP mRNA [40] . The corollary is that anchored trimeric EBOVGP spikes on the surface of infected cells and virus particles present a dense array of structural epitopes that may interact more efficiently with B cells than soluble secreted EBOVGP, as is the case for other particulate antigen compositions [41, 42] . EBOVGP-specific IgG responses were highest for N4CT1-EBOVGP1\u0394muc [43] , possibly reflecting better exposure of EBOVGP epitopes by removal of part of the carbohydrate cloak [44] . The N4CT1-EBOVGP3 vector also elicited a robust EBOVGP-specific IgG response, which contrasts with the undetectable EBOVGP-specific cell-mediated immune response induced by this vector. The explanation for this anomaly is unclear but could be due to relative differences in EBOVGP-specific cellular and humoral antigenicity. We believe the approximate 30% attenuation of expression across each gene junction could drop the EBOVGP level below a threshold required to elicit cell-mediated immune responses (N4CT1-EBOVGP3), while the EBOVGP level is still adequate to induce a relatively robust humoral response. However, for N4CT1-EBOVGP6, the EBOVGP-specific humoral response does decline markedly, presumably as a result of the calculated 85% reduction in EBOVGP expression when in the sixth position in the genome.",

However, Western blot data demonstrated that EBOVGP was present on the surface of virus particles when expressed by an rVSV vector that retained the VSV G gene (unpublished data). Therefore, a mouse NV study was performed to assess any changes in virulence arising from the possible alteration of vector tropism mediated by EBOVGP. Results confirmed the highly attenuated nature of N4CT1-EBOVGP1 in the mouse central nervous system, indicating that the presence of EBOVGP on the virion surface, in addition to VSV G protein, did not enhance virus spread in the brain, presumably because cells in the central nervous system lack the EBOVGPspecific receptor [45] [46] [47] and because virus using VSV G receptors remained attenuated as previously described [30] .",

One dose of this vector protected guinea pigs from signs of disease following challenge with a lethal dose of GPA-EBOV. Interestingly, there was a slight delay in onset of the first signs of disease after challenge of wtVSV-vaccinated guinea pigs. One possible explanation is that induction of IFNs and other innate immune responses by rVSV [48, 49] leaves the guinea pig innate immune system on high alert, even 21 days after vaccination, resulting in a generalized antiviral state that may initially slow the GPA-EBOV infection [49, 50] .",

An EBOVGPspecific IgG titer was detected in both immunized macaques prior to challenge and was expanded following EBOV challenge, indicating that a preexisting EBOVGP-specific antibody response is important for protection. Unfortunately cell-mediated immune responses in NHPs were not measured and may also contribute significantly to protection. The N4CT1-EBOVGP1 vector used in these challenge studies is similar to the highly attenuated N4CT1-gag1 vector that demonstrated safety and immunogenicity in 2 phase 1 clinical studies. The studies described here are the first to demonstrate protection of guinea pigs and macaques with a single dose of highly attenuated rVSV expressing EBOVGP, and we believe that the N4CT1-EBOVGP1 vector has the essential safety and efficacy characteristics for use in a vaccine to prevent EBOV infection in humans and the great apes. This highly attenuated vector platform will likely also have the potential to serve in a vaccine against other EBOV strains that cause disease in humans and apes. Ultimately, a multivalent EBOV vaccine may be possible by combining \u22652 vaccine vectors in a single vaccine formulation.",

Anchored full-length EBOV glycoprotein (EBOVGP) was inserted either in the first, third, or sixth position and designated as GP1, GP3, or GP6, respectively. An EBOVGP inserted in position 1 with the hydrophobic membrane anchor deleted at amino acid positions 651-676 was generated to make a secreted protein (GP1\u0394TM). An EBOVGP with part of the mucin-like domain deleted at positions 374-465 (GP1\u0394muc) was inserted in position 1. Virus leader (Le), trailer (Tr), and intergenic regions are shown in black, and shaded areas in EBOVGP represent deleted amino acid regions. Numbers above the N4CT1 constructs indicate gene position within the genome. GP1, N4CT1-EBOVGP1; GP1\u0394muc, N4CT1-EBOVGP1\u0394muc; GP1\u0394TM, N4CT1-EBOVGP1\u0394TM; GP3, N4CT1-EBOVGP3; GP6, N4CT1-EBOVGP6. B, Western blot analysis of EBOVGP expression. Protein lysates from infected Vero cells were evaluated using 4%-12% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and probed with a monoclonal mouse anti-EBOVGP antibody (IBT BioServices; catalog number 0201-020). Bands were detected by an anti-mouse-AP conjugate immunoglobulin G (H + L; Promega) and developed with a chromogenic substrate (Western Blue, Promega). Bands were seen at approximately 160, 140, and 110 kDa with varied expression levels depending on the position of EBOVGP within the genome. GP1\u0394muc showed a lower-molecular-weight EBOVGP band as a result of lost glycosylation sites due to deletion of amino acid positions 374-465.
