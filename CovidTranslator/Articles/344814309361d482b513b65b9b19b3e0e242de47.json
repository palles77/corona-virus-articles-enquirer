Though acute HSV-1 infection is readily treatable with nontoxic nucleoside analogues such as acyclovir (ACV), no drug successfully eliminates the latent infection. In addition, growing ACV drug resistance has further fueled the search for novel antivirals. 2 Plants of the Amaryllidaceae family produce numerous structurally diverse, biologically active alkaloids. 3, 4 In particular, alkaloids of the lycorane subclass including lycorine 1, pseudolycorine 2, pancratistatin 3, its 7-deoxy analogue 4, and the unsaturated derivatives narciclasine 5 and deoxy analogue 6 have demonstrated a variety of antiviral activities (Figure 1 ). 5\u221213 The restricted availability of other natural lycorane-type alkaloids and the absence of a rapid synthetic route toward structural analogues has impeded further development of the antiviral pharmacophore.",

To our delight, this reaction was found to proceed in a highly regioselective fashion with the initial Michael-addition being fully directed by the azido group, allowing a direct entry to cyclohexanol 14b. The complex cyclohexane product 14b was obtained directly as a precipitate that formed during the reaction in 73% isolated yield and did not require chromatographic purification. The reaction also proved to be highly diastereoselective (dr = 96%) with the major diastereomer being essentially homochiral (>99% ee). The relative and absolute stereochemistry of this major cycloadduct was determined as \u03b1-benzyloxy at C3 as shown in 14b.

We employed a genetically engineered HSV-1 construct, incorporating enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) and red fluorescent protein (RFP) as reporter genes, whose expression is driven by the viral promoters ICP0 and glycoprotein C (gC), respectively. 14 ICP0 is an HSV-1 immediate early (IE) gene, while gC is expressed only after onset of viral DNA replication. Vero cells initially infected with HSV-1 at multiplicity of infection (MOI) 1 were cultured at 2 h postinfection (hpi) in media containing compounds 3, 5, 7, 8, 9, or 10 (10 \u03bcM) or ACV (50 \u03bcM). Flow cytometry analysis (FC) showed that the percentage of EGFP positive (EGFP + ) cells in infected cultures exposed to 3, 5, and 7 was reduced 8.3-, 10.6-, and 19.6-fold, respectively, compared with untreated, HSV-1 infected cultures 24 hpi (Figure 2a) , while ACV caused 4.3-fold reduction of EGFP + cells. Productive infection, estimated in the culture supernatant by virus yield reduction assay using Vero cells 48 hpi was also suppressed in cell cultures treated with 3, 5, and 7 (10 \u03bcM), similar to ACV (50 \u03bcM) (Figure 2b) . Conversely, compounds 8, 9, and 10 (10 \u03bcM) did not inhibit HSV-1 infection ( Figure 2a) ; furthermore, these compounds did not suppress productive infection (Figure 2b) . These results reveal a critical role played by the C3-\u03b2-hydroxyl group, found only in natural products 3, 5, and 7, as a requirement for antiviral activity.",

Thus, compounds 3, 5, and 7 appear to exert an inhibitory effect on HSV-1 DNA replication like ACV. Since compound 7 is the simplest analogue from a functional and stereochemical perspective to exhibit these novel antiviral effects and is readily available through our total synthetic strategy, we selected it for further analyses. 13 iPSC-neurons were infected with HSV-1 as described above, and DNA was extracted 24 hpi. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) analysis indicated dramatic reduction in viral DNA copy number in cells treated with 7 (over 1800-fold reduction at 10 \u03bcM) and ACV (2300-fold reduction at 50 \u03bcM), compared with infected, untreated cells (Supplemental Figure 1b) . The HSV-1 immediate early gene ICP4 is essential for viral replication; 17 therefore, we utilized RT-qPCR to test the expression of ICP4 and viral DNA polymerase 24 hpi in infected iPSC-neurons treated with 7 or ACV.",

Unexpectedly, the EGFP mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) in cells treated with 7 or 7 + IFN-\u03b1 was approximately 1.6-and 2.5-fold lower than the 5BVdU + IFN-\u03b1 treated cells, 5 days after the drugs were withdrawn (Figure 3b ). Cells treated with 7 or 7 + IFN-\u03b1 also differed from the 5BVdU + IFN-\u03b1 treated cells following incubation with NaB; whereas the latter showed robust reactivation with respect to percentage of EGFP + cells or EGFP MFI, cells treated with 7 or 7 + IFN-\u03b1 did not show significant reactivation (Figure 3a,b) . Similarly, the proportion of EGFP-RFP+ cells and EGFP-RFP MFI were significantly reduced in cells treated with 7 or 7 + IFN-\u03b1 after treatment with NaB when compared to the cells treated with 5BVdU + IFN-\u03b1 (Figure 3a,b) . Taken together, these experiments suggest that the repression induced by 7 or 7 + IFN-\u03b1 is distinct from BVdU + IFN-\u03b1 or ACV, as it is not reactivated to the same extent by NaB.",

The present work significantly expands knowledge on the antiviral activity of these alkaloids by identifying derivatives that exhibit novel, distinctive, and diverse inhibitory effects against HSV-1 and VZV infection that are superior to ACV. The facile method reported here for the rapid asymmetric synthesis of natural and non-natural lycorine-type alkaloids permitted discovery of a clear structure\u2212activity pattern, demonstrating that a crucial role is played by the (3R)-hydroxy substituent in these alkaloids as a requirement for this antiviral activity. Only compounds 3, 5, and 7 containing the (3R)-stereochemistry demonstrate potent antiviral activity, the C3-epimeric compound 8 and C3-deoxy derivative 9 are significantly less active. This allowed identification of alkaloid 7 as a functionally minimum antiviral pharmacophore. Further applications on harnessing the iPSC-neuron based platform with additional pathogens with the current and additional analogues prepared through refinements on the synthetic protocol are under active investigation. Most importantly, as latent HSV-1 infection is lifelong and drug-refractory, the multiple effects of compound 7 on HSV-1 infection, including its ability to significantly reduce HSV-1 reactivation from quiescence, motivate additional studies of viral entry and viral heterochromatinization. Additional studies are needed to evaluate whether compound 7 alone or in combination with currently known antiherpetic drugs can repress HSV-1 irreversibly to confer protection of immunocompromised individuals who may be at risk for ACVresistance 20 or patients with renal failure.",
