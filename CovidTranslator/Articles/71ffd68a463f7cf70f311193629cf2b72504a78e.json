            "text": "The last several years have seen a large number of mass poisonings in mainland China, particularly those caused by illicit rodenticides. One rat poison, tetramine (tetramethylene disulfotetramine) is responsible for a great percentage of death and injury in the People's Republic of China (PRC). Tetramine is an acutely toxic substance with human oral toxicity estimated as low as 0.1 mg/kg, and is widely available in open markets in mainland China-this despite being prohibited for manufacture or sale in the PRC. Being a GABA antagonist, and having an extremely potent effect on the brain stem, many victims can quickly fall into convulsions and die within hours following ingestion. With no known effective antidote at this time, clinical data from the PRC show that acute cases of tetramine poisoning are extremely difficult to treat. The widespread use of tetramine-including its reported sale at a Malaysian outdoor market in September 2002-could exacerbate its hazard to public health, particularly in those areas having large overseas Chinese populations.",

During the last decade, public health authorities in the People's Republic of China (PRC) estimated that there have been 100,000 human cases of pesticide poisonings in China per year (Wu and Liu 2000) . This large figure is no doubt due in part simply to China's very large rural population, and because a significant percentage of its people are engaged in the agricultural sector. It is nonetheless alarming that rodenticides may alone be responsible for up to 70,000 annual poisonings in China. What is more, according to one Beijing-based medical journal, a substantial portion of recent rodenticide poisonings in China have been deliberate (Qiu et al. 2002) , in many cases involving the use of a relatively novel rodenticide, tetramethylene disulfotetramine, (tetramine, C 4 H 8 N 4 O 4 S 2 ; CAS no. 80-12-6). The 2002 case described below is among the more recent and striking examples.",

            "text": "Tetramine falls into a category of cyclic compounds noted for their high toxicity in mammals (Esser et al. 1991) . Tetramine acts directly upon the brain itself, blocking the chloride channel of the inhibitory neurotransmitter receptor of c-amino butyric acid (GABA). Very small amounts of tetramine, estimated as low as 0.1 mg/kg weight (oral LD 50 ) in mammals can lead to convulsions and death, with 7.0-10.0 mg/kg dosages considered lethal in humans (Guan et al. 1993) ; the minimum lethal dose for humans has been estimated at about 5.0 mg/kg. The effects of tetramine can manifest themselves quickly, from about 30 minutes to a few hours following ingestion (Tang et al. 2000) . Symptoms of tetramine poisoning include fainting, epileptic seizures, incontinence, and foaming at the mouth. Data compiled from laboratory animal studies are also instructive. One Chinese medical journal described tetramine poisoning in mice the following way: ''After ingesting the bait, mice are poisoned acutely. They are excited. Their tails straightened. They jump around, and occasionally screamed. It is followed by periodic or continuous spastic convulsion. Their limbs become stiff. In some cases, this cycle repeats a few times. Then, they die.'' (Zhou et al. 1998) . Clinical and anecdotal reports from the PRC also noted hemoptysis among some victims of tetramine poisoning, but this symptom and its relationship to the toxicity of tetramine have not yet been satisfactorily explained.",

In the authors' discussion of their experience in treating tetramine poisoning, the physicians noted the importance of gastric lavage for cases of acute poisoning. Secondly, their empirical data suggest that plasma exchange treatment was the next best course of action. ''...[f]or 13 patients who exhibited convulsive symptoms, their condition rapidly improved following plasma exchange. Although symptoms returned in some cases 12-24 hours afterwards, convulsions resolved following a second round of plasma exchange.'' Finally, the authors emphasized that in acute cases of tetramine poisoning their results showed the need for aggressive therapy using anticonvulsants, therefore requiring an artificial airway: ''In securing an airway by intubation, combined with mechanical ventilation, one did not have to be reticent about administering large doses of tranquilizers for anticonvulsant therapy. Furthermore, by doing so one could ascertain whether or not treatment of those critical cases will ultimately be successful.'' (Li and Zeng 2001) .",

It was later revealed that a fellow student-who had compiled a long record of truancy-was responsible. The student, angry that the school had informed his father of his unsavory behavior, tried to take revenge on his teacher by scattering tetramine on vegetables in the commissary during after-school hours. Reportedly, the student purchased a pouch of tetramine rodenticide for the equivalent of US$ 0.16. (1 yuan). Although the miscreant intended to poison only the teacher, the tainted ingredients were unwittingly used by the kitchen staff and served throughout the school population (Wang 2002 One should caution, however, that statistics of poisoning incidents in the PRC are incomplete due to various factors, including a tendency on the part of the Chinese government to not fully divulge news on domestic affairs. Whether it is the prevalence of HIV/ AIDS among the Chinese population, foot-and-mouth disease in domestic Chinese livestock (referred to officially as ''disease no. 5''), or the recent outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus, there is a past history of reticence on the part of Chinese authorities to be transparent concerning outbreaks of infectious disease and other public health problems (Croddy 2002) .

Acute poisons such as hydrogen cyanide, strychnine, and zinc phosphide compounds have traditionally been used to control rodents for many years past. In recent times, however, safer compounds such as the warfarin anticoagulant agents have been adopted for control of mice and rats. The marketability of anticoagulant rodenticides-poisons that kill by causing internal bleeding in mammals-is notably enhanced by the availability of an antidote (vitamin K) in case of accidental exposure of non-target animals (e.g., people, livestock and household pets).",

(These include not only tetramine, but also silatrane, a cyclic, silicon-based compound that was investigated by South African chemical weapons specialists for use in assassinations during the 1980s). These banned rodenticides, mainly tetramine and fluoroacetate, comprise up to 80% of the illicit market for acute rodenticides in China's rural areas, and 60% overall across the country, according to a Henanbased manager of a chemical firm in the PRC (Huashengbao 2000) .",

Although many pesticides have been regulated in the PRC since the 1950s, illicit manufacturers in China continue to produce not only domestically banned organochlorine compounds such as DDT, but also a number of highly toxic rodenticides (Zhong et al. 2003) . Sales of these compounds are often conducted in large open markets with informal marketing and retail distribution networks. This fact, coupled with the very low cost of the final product (starting at US$ 0.10 per unit) makes it easy for the average Chinese citizen to gain access to very toxic substances, including acutely toxic rodenticides such as fluoroacetate, fluoroacetamide, tetramine, and possibly others.",

            "text": "Chinese authorities singled out for prohibition the unregulated use of acutely toxic rat poison fluoroacetamide in 1984, and later fluoracetate as well. Such laws, unfortunately, did not dissuade two individuals in Gaoyao City, Guangdong Province, from using fluoroacetate and fluoroacetamide to perpetrate mass murder in 1995. During the spring and summer of that year, acting upon what was later described as ''superstitious influence,'' Du Runqiong (42) and her son Tang Youhua (20) , used these rodenticides to poison and kill 18 people. These individuals used both rodenticides to contaminate rice, vegetable plots, and sausages sold in the local market. Their crimes also extended to their neighbors' livestock, causing the death of 243 pigs, some 3,100 chickens, and 10 oxen. During the investigation of this rather sordid affair, researchers from the China Medical Research Institute of Preventative Medicine were dispatched to Gaoyao City, and toxicologists from the Peoples' Liberation Army (PLA) finally identified the poisons from locally obtained samples. Until Du Runqiong was apprehended in November 1995, many of the Gaoyao City's inhabitants, fearing for their lives, panicked and fled the township. On 22 December 1995 both perpetrators were sentenced to death. Among Chinese analysts and those responsible for food security in the PRC, there is a general consensus as to what is driving the force behind the chaotic misuse of prohibited rodenticides, particularly tetramine: -Marketability. ''Many customers who buy rodenticides like to see fast results; soon after laying down these highly toxic rodenticides, rats quickly die, thus satisfying this need for the consumer.'' -Ease of manufacture. Obtaining chemical precursors (ingredients for production) and the synthesis of these compounds are relatively easy. -High profitability. Unscrupulous vendors can double their money by selling a rodenticide like tetramine, where 1 g of pure substance costs about 1 yuan to manufacture, and 1 g of rodenticide fetches about 2 yuan on the open market. -Clandestine manufacture and sales. According to one Chinese account, ''Motivated by profits, some rodenticide producers are secretly but clearly producing these rodenticides with tacit approval of the state, some individual entities are doing so without permission. Some are illicit shops, taking very toxic rodenticides and masking them as slow [anticoagulant] poisons or renaming them with monikers such as Sanbudao, ''Miraculous Rodenticide'', and other trade names for sale on the market. -Regional protectionism. Corrupt local government officials allow the continued production of banned rodenticides, knowing that they can benefit from increased tax revenues as well as bribes. -Weak regulatory enforcement. While the PRC's Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Crop Protection have investigative authority, they have no means to levy punishments on violators. Conversely, ''the Chinese Department of Market Management has the authority to take punitive measures, but lacks the technical means to test for the highly toxic rodenticides.'' (Fan 2002) .",

Although aggressive surveillance is underway in the PRC to find and remove tetramine rat poison from informal markets, it is unknown how effective regulatory enforcement in China has been in removing this hazard. Reports from China have thus far indicated uneven progress in enforcing the prohibition of tetramine and other illicit chemical compounds for sale in open markets (Beijing Daily News 2002).

After coming into contact with the powder, a 15-month-old child was permanently injured from tetramine intoxication. The name of this brand, Yisaoguang (roughly translated as ''one fell swoop''), is a fairly common name for this rodenticide in the PRC. It is also illegal.
