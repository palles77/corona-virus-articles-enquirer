The separation was performed with a 50.0 cm (42.0 cm to the detector window) \u00d7 75 m i.d. fused-silica capillary, and the CE fingerprint condition was optimized using the combination of central composite design and multivariate analysis. The optimized buffer system containing 15 mM borate, 40 mM phosphate, 15 mM SDS, 15% (v/v) acetonitrile and 7.5% (v/v) 2-propanol was employed for the method development, and the baseline separation was achieved within 15 min. The determination of the major active components (Baicalin, Baicalein and Wogonin) was carried out using the optimized CE condition. Good linear relationships were provided over the investigated concentration ranges (the values of R 2 : 0.9997 for Baicalin, 0.9992 for Baicalein, and 0.9983 for Wogonin, respectively). The average recoveries of these target components ranged between 96.1-105.6%, 98.6-105.2%, and 96.3-105.0%, respectively. CE fingerprints combined with the quantitative analysis can be used for the quality evaluation of S. baicalensis.",

However, for the herbal medicines the safety and efficacy are not just attributed to one or several particular compounds, because it is well known that a herbal medicine is one complex mixture containing dozens, even hundreds of chemical components which are usually responsible for the therapeutic effects. Furthermore, the interactions among these components make their relationship to the safety and efficacy much more complicated than that occurs in the western medicines. Therefore, quality evaluation of the herbal medicines, unlike that of the western medicines, is beyond the ability of routine analysis, which focuses on the single or a few marker components. Taking into account the direct quantification of as many as possible components is in common thought to evaluate the quality of the herbal medicines. However, it would be impossible because most reference components are not commercially available; moreover, most of the herbal medicines are so complex that the procedure of separation, identification and determination of numbers of components is rather tedious for the pharmaceutical quality evaluation.",

Capillary electrophoresis (CE) is becoming increasingly recognized as an important separation technique, due to its high resolution, small sample volumes, extraordinary small solvents consumption and rapid separation with high efficiency.

Some concentrated composite herbal preparations containing this herb as a major ingredient are widely used in China [19] . The main active components are many kinds of flavones compounds such as Baicalin, Baicalein and Wogonin (their chemical structures have been presented in Fig. 1 ). Baicalin is the most abundant component, and it has anti-inflammatory [20] , anti-HIV [21] , anti-tumor [22] and anti-SARS coronavirus effects [23] .

The phenolics of the crude extract of S. baicalensis were ever examined by micellar electrokinetic chromatography (MEKC) with UV-DAD [26] , and two trihydroxyflavones compounds were separated. In the present study, quantitative analysis and chromatographic fingerprint with CE technique was developed for the quality evaluation of S. baicalensis. The roots of S. baicalensis (34 samples in all), collected from different geographical origins of China, were analyzed. The combination of central composite design and multivariate analysis was employed to find an optimal CE condition. Three active components (Baicalin, Baicalein and Wogonin) were determined with the optimized CE condition. As a result, the combination of quantitative analysis and chromatographic fingerprinting offers more valuable information for the quality evaluation of the herbal medicines.",

Therefore, micellar electrokinetic capillary chromatography (MEKC) mode was employed for the further investigation. The mixture of 20 mM borate and 30 mM phosphate was chosen as the aqueous buffer because it provided a relative better separation. SDS was chosen as the surfactant. Organic modifiers were commonly used for method development of MEKC. It was shown that the simultaneous addition of acetonitrile and 2-propanol into the buffer offered a better separation.
