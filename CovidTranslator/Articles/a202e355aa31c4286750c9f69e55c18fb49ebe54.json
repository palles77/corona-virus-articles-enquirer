Both primers were modified with 2'-O-methyl bases in their penultimate base to prevent formation of primer dimers. The ZEN double-quenched probe (IDT) was used in order to lower background fluorescence. The master mix (Mmx) cassette (for 96 tests) is prepared by combining 84 \u00b5L forward primer (400 nM, 5\u00b4-ACAGGTACGTTAATAGTTAATAGCmGT-3\u00b4), 84 \u00b5L reverse primer (400 nM, 5\u00b4-ATATTGCAGCAGTACGCACAmCA-3\u00b4) and 10.5 \u00b5L probe (50 nM, 5\u00b4-Fam-ACACTAGCC/ZEN/ ATCCTTACTGCGCTTCG-Iowa Black FQ-3')* together with 182 \u00b5L water and 5,640 \u00b5l Mmx2 mixture. After mixing, the 6 mL are transferred to the reagent cassette. The Mmx cassette is delivered with a full-process control: it is preloaded with an internal control (IC) RNA together with primers and probe of the IC detection assay by default [6] . Instrument settings in the cobas mni Utility Channel software (Roche, Los Gatos, US) and the temperature profile used for the RT-PCR reaction are summarised in Table 1 .",

The LoD was 689.3 copies/mL with 275.72 copies per reaction at 95% detection probability ( Figure 1 , Figure  2 ). For estimation of inter/intra-run variability, we analysed each of two concentrations (ca 5 \u00d7 and 10 \u00d7 LoD spiked IVT SARS-CoV-2 RNA) in five replicates and a negative sample with five replicates in two runs each. Minimal deviation was observed with \u00b1 0.5 cycle threshold (Ct) at 10 \u00d7 LoD and 0.75 Ct at 5 \u00d7 LoD. No false positive results occurred.",

However, identification of the agent, sequencing and publication of specific PCR assays for general use, a process that took several weeks 15 years ago, can now be accomplished in a few days [8] . With this rapid pace in identification and sharing of information comes the responsibility of local laboratories to be able to implement available assays and provide tests for the outbreak strain in an equally short timeframe. Furthermore, demand can be unpredictable and may suddenly spike, even outside the primary endemic areas, putting testing capacity under strain and potentially causing delays.

[4] . They report an LoD for SARS-CoV-2 RNA of 5.2 copies per reaction at 95% detection probability, which corresponds to 208 copies/mL based on a 25 \u00b5L reaction volume. It has to be noted that manual determination of LoD usually involves adding purified target RNA directly into the reagent mix for amplification, whereas in our study, control material (purified RNA) was spiked into samples and underwent the full workflow of the cobas 6800 device, including extraction and purification. Therefore, differences in nominal analytical performance are to be expected. One important limitation of the study is that we had to rely on spiked-in material and could not validate the performance of the assay using clinical SARS-CoV-2-positive samples.",

It demonstrates how commercial PCR platforms can enhance outbreak readiness for emerging pathogens, allowing for large numbers of patients to be screened in a reasonable timeframe, if necessary. It has to be noted that by its nature as a screening test targeting only a single viral gene, positive results should always be confirmed with an independent PCR as recommended [4] . Finally, we want to stress the importance of closely coordinating with local reference centres and public health authorities for determining clinical indications for testing, as well as the handling of confirmed cases and contact precautions.",
