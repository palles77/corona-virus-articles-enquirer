We identified human proteins that interact with the glycoproteins (GPs) of a prototypic arenavirus and hantavirus and show that the lectin endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-Golgi intermediate compartment 53 kDa protein (ERGIC-53), a cargo receptor required for glycoprotein trafficking within the early exocytic pathway, associates with arenavirus, hantavirus, coronavirus, orthomyxovirus, and filovirus GPs. ERGIC-53 binds to arenavirus GPs through a lectin-independent mechanism, traffics to arenavirus budding sites, and is incorporated into virions. ERGIC-53 is required for arenavirus, coronavirus, and filovirus propagation; in its absence, GP-containing virus particles form but are noninfectious, due in part to their inability to attach to host cells. Thus, we have identified a class of pathogen-derived ERGIC-53 ligands, a lectin-independent basis for their association with ERGIC-53, and a role for ERGIC-53 in the propagation of several highly pathogenic RNA virus families.",

Most pathogenic arenaviruses are associated with severe hemorrhagic fever syndromes in humans. Examples include the New World arenaviruses Junin virus (JUNV), Machupo virus (MACV), and Guanarito virus (GTOV), which are the etiologic agents of Argentine, Bolivian, and Venezuelan hemorrhagic fevers, respectively, as well as Lassa virus (LASV), an Old World arenavirus that causes Lassa fever along the coast of West Africa (Buchmeier et al., 2007) . Additionally, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) can cause aseptic meningitis in immunocompetent individuals and is a potent teratogen (Buchmeier et al., 2007) . LCMV and Dandenong virus (DANV), an LCMV-like virus, are also responsible for a nearly uniform lethality in immunosuppressed recipients of virusinfected tissues (Fischer et al., 2006; Palacios et al., 2008) . Hantaviruses cause two human illnesses: hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome in the Old World and hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome (HCPS) in the New World (Schmaljohn and Nichol, 2007) . Sin Nombre virus (SNV) and Andes virus (ANDV) are the primary etiologic agents of HCPS in North and South America, respectively, and are associated with a fatality rate of 35%-39% (da Rosa Elkhoury et al., 2012; MacNeil et al., 2011) . US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved vaccines or effective antivirals do not currently exist for the prevention and/or therapeutic treatment of arenavirus or hantavirus disease.",

Herein, we utilized a proteomics approach to comprehensively identify human proteins that interact with GPs encoded by a prototypic arenavirus or hantavirus. We show that the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-Golgi intermediate compartment 53 kDa protein (ERGIC-53), an intracellular cargo receptor that facilitates the anterograde transport of a limited number of glycoprotein ligands in the early exocytic pathway (Appenzeller et al., 1999) , has a conserved interaction with GPs encoded by multiple families of RNA viruses and is essential for the formation of infectious arenavirus, coronavirus, and filovirus particles in a GP-specific manner. Our results suggest that loss of ERGIC-53 or its functionality leads to the formation of GP-containing virions that are defective in their ability to attach to permissive host cells.",

            "text": "To identify human proteins that associate with arenavirus and hantavirus GPs, we used an approach that featured affinity purification (AP) of biotinylated viral proteins (LCMV GP to represent arenaviruses or ANDV GP for hantaviruses) in complex with host proteins, followed by mass spectrometry to identify host protein partners as described in Figure S1A and the Supplemental Experimental Procedures (available online). We identified a number of host proteins that associated with LCMV GP (n = 309), ANDV GP (n = 134), or both GPs (n = 51) ( Figures 1A-1C , S1B, and S1C; Tables S1A-S1C). As shown in Figure S1D and Table S1D , host proteins that associated with both GPs were enriched for processes involving the ER, protein folding, and vesicular transport. The LCMV GPonly partners were enriched for processes that included the ER, the proteasome, and nuclear import, while the ANDV GPonly partners were enriched for protein translation and ribosome biogenesis. We were particularly interested in the subset of proteins that interacted with both GPs, as they could serve as broad-spectrum antiviral targets. Of these, we chose ERGIC-53 for further study based upon several criteria. First, the ERGIC-53-viral GP interaction is physiologically plausible (e.g., each protein traffics within the exocytic pathway); ERGIC-53 is a mannose-specific lectin (Itin et al., 1996) and the viral GPs are mannosylated (Schmaljohn et al., 1986; Wright et al., 1990) . Second, based on its identification as a cargo receptor within the exocytic pathway (Appenzeller et al., 1999) , we hypothesized that ERGIC-53 could be required for GP maturation and therefore might be critical for viral propagation. Finally, ERGIC-53 is an attractive target because loss of this protein or its normal function is well tolerated both in vitro (Mitrovic et al., 2008; Nyfeler et al., 2006; Vollenweider et al., 1998) and in vivo (Khoriaty et al., 2012) .",

Each viral GP tested, when serving as bait, was able to coprecipitate ERGIC-53 ( Figures 1D, 1F -1H, S1E, and data not shown). Likewise, ERGIC-53 was able to coprecipitate each GP screened ( Figures  1E, 1I -1K, S1F-S1I, and data not shown). For the arenavirus GPs, only the full-length GPC was coprecipitated as prey. A full-length hantavirus GPC cannot be recovered, as this protein is cotranslationally cleaved into G1 and G2 subunits prior to synthesis of a full-length GPC species (L\u00f6 ber et al., 2001) . As shown in Figure 1L , we further verified the specificity of the ERGIC-53-JUNV C#1 GP interaction by showing that both proteins strongly colocalize within a structure that we putatively identify as the ERGIC; both proteins also preferentially concentrate in this structure.",

Expression of an ER-restricted, dominant-negative (DN) mutant of ERGIC-53 (Vollenweider et al., 1998) resulted in a pronounced reduction in the release of infectious JUNV C#1 (48 hr pi, 90.5% decrease, p = 1.4 310 \u00c08 ; 72 hr pi, 99.8% decrease, p = 3.2 3 10 \u00c04 ) (Figures 2C and S2C) , DANV (95% reduction, p = 0.003) (Figures 2D and S2D) , and LCMV strain Armstrong 53b (data not shown).

We therefore conducted challenge studies featuring B cells derived from LMAN1 +/+ (2829-D) and LMAN1 \u00c0/\u00c0 (CRC-78 and CRC-79) individuals. The two LMAN1 \u00c0/\u00c0 individuals, despite being from separate families (A2 and A12 in Neerman-Arbez et al., 1999) , encode an identical null mutation (c.822-1G > A splice site mutation) that abrogates expression of ERGIC-53. Significantly less infectious virus was released from each of the LMAN1 \u00c0/\u00c0 cell lines when compared to the LMAN1 +/+ control cells (96% and 97% decrease for 3D , S3C, and S3D).

Cells expressing WT or DN ERGIC-53 were infected with JUNV C#1 and screened for surface expression of JUNV C#1 GP. Interestingly, GP surface staining was equivalent in both the WT and DN ERGIC-53 transfected cells in terms of the frequency of cells with GP expression (46% WT versus 47% DN) as well as the intensity of GP staining (median fluorescence intensity [MFI] of 348 for WT versus 363 for DN) ( Figure 4B ). Confocal microscopy analysis revealed a similar result (Figure 4A) . The DN ERGIC-53 had no impact on the ability of hTfR1, the surface receptor required for GP-mediated JUNV entry into host cells (Radoshitzky et al., 2007) , to traffic to the cell surface ( Figure S4 ). In summary, cells expressing DN ERGIC-53 have normal surface expression of hTfR1, manifest no defect in viral entry of WT JUNV C#1 particles, and display no defect for GP synthesis or its trafficking to the plasma membrane.",

We first addressed whether ERGIC-53 trafficking was altered during infection by surface labeling cells with antibodies specific for JUNV C#1 GP and ERGIC-53. We observed discrete JUNV C#1 GP puncta of $200-400 nm at the plasma membrane that we suggest are putative sites of viral assembly and budding ( Figure 5B ). Strikingly, ERGIC-53 formed puncta of the same size, shape, and position as GP ( Figure 5B ). In contrast, ERGIC-53 was not detectable at the plasma membrane of uninfected cells ( Figure 5B ). This altered trafficking is specific, as calreticulin (CRT), another Ca 2+ -binding lectin of the exocytic pathway, did not similarly redistribute to the plasma membrane following infection ( Figure 5C ). The intracellular distribution of ERGIC-53 did not change between mock-or JUNV C#1-infected cells ( Figure 5A ). We next captured JUNV particles using an anti-GPC/GP1 antibody and found that ERGIC-53 was detectable in JUNV particles via western blot ( Figure 5D ). ERGIC-53 also colocalized with JUNV NP in viral particles adhered onto coverslips ( Figure S5 ). Thus, during arenavirus infection, ERGIC-53 traffics to sites of viral assembly and budding and is incorporated into virions. Figure S3 for blots), respectively.

            "text": "Arenaviruses and hantaviruses are significant human pathogens for which FDA-approved vaccines or effective antivirals do not exist. Their proteomes consist of only four proteins. While functional roles have been defined for each viral protein, their interactions with host proteins, and the importance of these interactions for viral replication and disease pathogenesis, remain largely unknown. In the current study, we addressed this deficiency by providing a comprehensive viral GP-human protein interactome map using GPs encoded by a representative arenavirus and hantavirus. We identified ERGIC-53 as a potential antiviral target based upon its ability to associate with GPs encoded by several families of pathogenic RNA viruses and its clear role in the propagation of arenaviruses, coronaviruses, and filoviruses. We demonstrate that ERGIC-53 is required not for the formation of GP-containing arenavirus particles, but rather for their infectiousness. We also show that ERGIC-53 traffics to sites of arenavirus budding and is incorporated into virions. Finally, we provide insight into the molecular basis for the GP-ERGIC-53 interaction by showing that the C-terminal region of ERGIC-53's CRD is required for the interaction independent of ERGIC's ability to oligomerize, traffic, or bind mannose, MCFD2, or Ca 2+ . ERGIC-53 is a nonglycosylated, hexameric type I integral membrane protein that functions as a cargo receptor for soluble glycoproteins within the early exocytic pathway. Its lumenal domain contains a CRD with homology to leguminous lectins and mammalian galectins; it selectively binds to high-mannose glycans in a pH-and Ca 2+ -dependent manner (Appenzeller-Herzog et al., 2004; Appenzeller et al., 1999; Itin et al., 1996) . Only five glycoproteins-FV and FVIII (Moussalli et al., 1999; Nichols et al., 1998) , the cathepsins C and Z (Appenzeller et al., 1999; Vollenweider et al., 1998) , and alpha-1 antitrypsin (Nyfeler et al., 2008) -have been shown to require ERGIC-53 for their efficient anterograde trafficking. Typically, ERGIC-53 captures its cargo proteins in the ER via its lectin activity and releases them in the ERGIC, presumably due to the lower pH of this compartment (Appenzeller-Herzog et al., 2004; Appenzeller et al., 1999) . In the case of FV and FVIII, MCFD2 is also required for the trafficking of these proteins independent of ERGIC-53 (Zhang et al., 2003) . Because ERGIC-53 and MCFD2 directly interact, it has been suggested that they form a mature cargo receptor required for efficient FV/FVIII trafficking (Nyfeler et al., 2006; Zhang et al., 2005) . Importantly, while loss of ERGIC-53 expression or function impairs movement of its specific ligands, the overall architecture of the exocytic pathway is maintained, and major glycoproteins still traffic normally (Mitrovic et al., 2008; Nyfeler et al., 2006; Vollenweider et al., 1998) . Indeed, humans with homozygous null mutations in ERGIC-53 or (D) ERGIC-53 is a component of arenavirus particles. An anti-GP1 antibody was used to immunoprecipitate viral particles from supernatants of JUNVinfected or mock-infected Vero E6 cells. An irrelevant, species-matched antibody was also used for immunoprecipitation from the JUNV-infected supernatants. Cell lysates and immunoprecipitated protein fractions were screened for viral proteins (GP1, NP, and Z) and ERGIC-53 via western blot under nonreducing conditions. Data are representative of two independent experiments. ERGIC-53 was also detectable in JUNV C#1 particles via confocal microscopy ( Figure S5 ). MCFD2, despite having F5F8D-a condition that features mild to moderate bleeding symptoms due to reduced levels of circulating FV/FVIII ($5%-30% of normal) -are generally healthy and lead normal lives, provided they receive FV/FVIII supplementation following trauma (Khoriaty et al., 2012) . These observations clearly suggest that ERGIC-53 is dispensable in humans and therefore represents a viable antiviral target.",

We show that, with the exception of the hantavirus GPs, ERGIC-53 preferentially interacts with the uncleaved, precursor GP, but not the proteolytically processed GP subunits ( Figures  1I-1K , 3H, 3J, S1F-S1H, and data not shown). In the case of the arenaviruses, this finding strongly suggests that the interaction takes place in the ER and/or ERGIC, prior to proteolytic cleavage of GPC into GP1/GP2 by the SKI-1/SP1 protease, which is thought to occur in the Golgi (Lenz et al., 2001; Wright et al., 1990) . Indeed, imaging of JUNV C#1-infected cells revealed that GP and ERGIC-53 both concentrate in the ERGIC (Figures 1L and 5A) .

Our results demonstrate that while ERGIC-53's CRD is indeed critical for the interaction, its lectin-and Ca 2+ -binding functions are completely dispensable (Figures 6 and S6) . Consistent with this claim, we also found the interaction to be unaffected by competition with free mannose, manipulation of Ca 2+ , changes in pH (as low as 5.0), or deglycosylation of the JUNV or ANDV GP (data not shown). In summary, our studies reveal that the molecular basis for ERGIC-53's interaction with JUNV GP is different from any of its previously characterized partners; only the C-terminal region of ERGIC-53's CRD (residues 84-269) is critical for the interaction, whereas ERGIC-53's ability to oligomerize, traffic, or bind mannose, Ca 2+ , or MCFD2 are not.",

Under normal conditions, ERGIC-53 does not appear to traffic beyond the cis-Golgi. However, following its overexpression via plasmid, ERGIC-53 can traffic to the plasma membrane, presumably due to saturation of COPI (Kappeler et al., 1994) . JUNV C#1 infection induces a striking redistribution of a portion of the intracellular pool of ERGIC-53 to the plasma membrane, where it strongly colocalizes with GP at putative sites of viral assembly and budding ( Figure 5B ). Furthermore, ERGIC-53 is packaged into arenavirus particles ( Figures 5D  and S5 ), which may indicate that it is required for virion structure and function.",

In support of this idea, infection with the related arenavirus LCMV triggers the activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6) arm of the unfolded protein response (UPR) (Pasqual et al., 2011) , which is known to increase ERGIC-53 expression (Nyfeler et al., 2003) . Indeed, LCMV infection of nonhuman primates results in increased transcription of ERGIC-53 (Djavani et al., 2009) . Alternatively, it is also possible that JUNV GP functions as a cargo receptor to facilitate the movement of ERGIC-53 Figure S6 for a detailed description of each mutant. (B) HEK293T cells were cotransfected with the BirA plasmid, a plasmid encoding JUNV C#1 GP with a C-terminal HA tag and BAP, and a plasmid encoding the indicated ERGIC-53 mutants with an N-terminal FLAG tag. JUNV C#1 GP species (GPC and GP2) were affinity purified as bait from cell lysates.

We initially hypothesized that ERGIC-53 was acting as a bona fide cargo receptor required for the anterograde movement of GP out of the ER and ultimately to the plasma membrane. This idea proved incorrect, as expression of the ER-restricted, DN ERGIC-53 mutant had no impact on the ability of GP to reach the plasma membrane ( Figures 4A and 4B) . Likewise, there was no disruption of either the proteolytic processing of GPC into GP1/GP2 or the ability of these GP species to be incorporated into VLPs ( Figure 4C ). Additionally, the DN ERGIC-53 mutant had no impact on the ability of WT JUNV C#1 particles to enter cells ( Figures 4A and 4B ) or on the level of expression of hTfR1 at the plasma membrane ( Figure S4 ). To formally test whether ERGIC-53 is required for the release of viral particles, we challenged normal or ERGIC-53 null cell lines with JUNV C#1 and found similar quantities of viral particles in the supernatants from each cell line ( Figure 4D ). However, despite equivalent particle release, the null cell-derived particles were $10-fold less infectious ( Figure 4E ), demonstrating that ERGIC-53 is essential for the infectivity of JUNV C#1 particles. Therefore, in the absence of ERGIC-53, arenavirus particles are produced in normal quantities but are defective in the early phase of replication. Our results suggest that this defect minimally exists at the level of virus attachment to the host cell ( Figure 4G ). It is possible that this defect may also impair other steps of viral entry, such as endocytic uptake of particles into host cells and/or fusion and release of genome into the cytoplasm (see Figure 7 for our proposed model). Under WT conditions (top half of left cell), the arenavirus GP undergoes a series of maturation steps within the early exocytic pathway (1), including proteolytic cleavage and trafficking to the plasma membrane, where it is incorporated into newly forming viral particles (2) that bud out of the cell (3). The GP on newly formed particles then attaches to its cellular receptor (4), which permits endocytic uptake of particles into endosomes (5), where low pH leads to GP2-mediated fusion of the viral and endosomal membranes and, ultimately, release of viral genome into the cytoplasm (6). In the absence of or in the presence of the ER-restricted, DN ERGIC-53 (DN) (bottom half of left cell), GP is still proteolytically processed, trafficked to the plasma membrane, and incorporated, along with other viral structural proteins and viral genome, into budding particles (1-3). These particles, however, lack ERGIC-53 and are defective in their ability to attach to host cells (4). They may have deficiencies in other early replication events (5 and 6) as well.",

ERGIC-53 itself may be a critical structural component of the virion, perhaps by acting as a coreceptor required for virion attachment to host cells. Direct support for this idea includes our finding that ERGIC-53 is a component of virions ( Figures 5D and S5 ) and that virions lacking ERGIC-53 are defective (Figures 4D-4G) . Additionally, less infectious virus was produced in our challenge studies featuring the ERrestricted, 2D, 3B, S2C, S2D, and S3B) or ERGIC-53 siRNA (Figures 2A and S2A) . Conversely, overexpression of WT ERGIC-53 leads to increased trafficking of ERGIC-53 to the plasma membrane (Kappeler et al., 1994) , which could lead to more ERGIC-53 being incorporated into particles and explain the increased release of infectious virus seen under these conditions ( Figures 2B and S2B) . Alternatively, ERGIC-53 could be required to traffic and/or recruit cellular proteins that are critically required for virion structure and function or for the proper maturation of the arenavirus GP (e.g., glycan maturation or other posttranslational modifications).",

As the GPs themselves are likely to be highly multifunctional due to the small size of their respective proteomes, the identified partners may also help elucidate additional functions for each GP. Each partner represents a candidate target for future antiviral screening. Indeed, four additional proteins identified in our study-stromal cell derived factor 4 (SDF4), archain 1 (ARCN1), coatomer protein complex subunit alpha (COPA), and renin receptor (ATP6AP2)-were recently shown to be required for LCMV and VSV replication (Panda et al., 2011) .

            "text": "In conclusion, ERGIC-53 represents a potential antiviral target because of its clearly demonstrated importance for the replication of pathogenic arenaviruses, coronaviruses, and filoviruses and the fact that loss of this protein or its function is well tolerated in humans (Khoriaty et al., 2012) . Furthermore, in the case of the arenaviruses, targeting ERGIC-53 function with an antiviral could be expected to set up an ongoing immunizing therapy, as defective, but presumably immunogenic, viral particles would be released during the course of treatment. While ERGIC-53 represents a potential broad-spectrum antiviral target for arenaviruses, coronaviruses, and filoviruses, it may also be required for additional human pathogens, such as the New World hantaviruses, orthomyxoviruses, or retroviruses, based upon its conserved interaction with their GPs (Figures 1D, 1E , 3I, 3J, and S1I) (J\u00e4 ger et al., 2012), or for DNA viruses, based on the finding that a murine gamma herpes virus was negatively impacted by silencing of ERGIC-53 (Mages et al., 2008) . Based on our finding that JUNV propagation is impaired in cells from ERGIC-53 null individuals, future studies should also address whether exposure to rodent-borne viruses, such as the arenaviruses, has exerted a selective pressure to maintain ERGIC-53 mutations within the human population as a means to confer resistance to infection. Additionally, while bleeding is not a major cause of morbidity or mortality during arenavirus or hantavirus infection, it is interesting to consider that viral GPs, by interacting with ERGIC-53, may disrupt ERGIC-53's normal cargo receptor function for FV and FVIII, contributing to some of the hemorrhagic manifestations seen following infection with these viruses, which can include deficiencies in the levels and/or activity of circulating FV or FVIII (Lee, 1987; Lee et al., 1989; Schwarz et al., 1972) . The interaction of ERGIC-53 with the filovirus GPs is particularly intriguing, considering the prominent coagulation abnormalities observed during human infection (Feldmann and Geisbert, 2011) . Finally, our studies and others (Gonzalez-Begne et al., 2009 ) have shown that ERGIC-53 is actively secreted from cells in viral particles and/or cellular exosomes and strongly suggest that it has important roles outside of its normal distribution within the exocytic pathway, perhaps outside of the cell where, in the case of arenaviruses, coronaviruses, and filoviruses, it may influence the endocytic pathway-driven process of viral entry.",
