In most affected individuals, the natural history of untreated MS follows a reasonably predictable course. About 85% of patients (60-70% of them women) show initial evidence of disease between ages 20 and 40 (with a sharp peak about age 30) presenting as intermittent episodes of neurological dysfunction, termed 'attacks' or 'relapses' . Common early symptoms include blurred vision, sensory disturbance (either tingling or loss of sensation) and motor impairment. These symptoms typically regress, often to an extent that neurological function returns to normal. Such attacks occur on average once every 2 years. MRI brain scans show abnormal signal in periventricular, posterior fossa and spinal cord white matter, often accompanied by evidence of transient blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption. Affected individuals are almost always in previous good health, although initial episodes can follow common mild infections such as upper respiratory viral illness. This phase of disease, termed relapsing-remitting MS, lasts between 5 and 30 years and is most commonly followed by secondary progressive MS, during which neurological function slowly worsens, with many fewer attacks. This phase of MS is more predictable and usually culminates at least with loss of ability to walk independent of cane, walker or wheelchair. It is not foreseeable whether other functions, including use of the arms and cognitive abilities, will be similarly affected.

CNS axons are demyelinated, likely by an active process that may involve action of macrophages, which may be derived from either microglia or monocytes. Targeting of the attack to myelin occurs by uncertain processes, possibly including myelin-specific antibodies 5 . Inflammatory cytokines are produced by T cells, macrophages and activated parenchymal elements such as astrocytes and microglia. The cytokine environment includes innate factors such as interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2 and IL-6, as well as more specialized adaptive-immune cytokines such as interferon (IFN)-\u03b3, IL-23 and IL-17 among others. Injurious reactive oxygen and nitrogen species are present, along with prostaglandins and vasoactive factors 6 . Chemokines including CCL2, CCL3, CCL4, CCL5, CXCL10, CXCL12 and CXCL13 are also found 7 . In severe lesions, axonal transection occurs, possibly as a bystander effect reflecting loss of protective myelin in a toxic environment 8, 9 . Some acute lesions show relatively large-scale oligodendrocyte loss, along with indicators of hypoxic tissue damage and an altered pattern of inflammation 10 . These lesions were termed pattern III by the investigators who characterized them and may represent a distinct form of disease pathogenesis 11 . The cerebral cortex is also involved at the early stages of MS, showing inflammatory demyelination similar to that observed in white matter 12 . As lesions resolve, myelin repair often occurs. Remyelination is neuroprotective, as demyelinated axons show decreased long-term viability 13 . Furthermore, remyelination as characterized at autopsy appears much more robust in some cases than in others, possibly providing insight into the highly variable outcomes of MS in individual cases 14 .",

Aside from Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) infection of mice 15 (see below), no spontaneous disease of other species resembles MS sufficiently to provide translatable insights into the disorder. Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a family of disease models, is the most widely applied means of studying MS at the research bench. EAE was discovered about 85 years ago, during efforts to clarify the origin of 'neuroparalytic accident' , a feared and common complication of vaccination against rabies virus. The vaccinating inoculum was prepared in tissue containing neural elements, and the tissue pathology of fatal cases did not resemble rabies infection. Therefore, one simple question was whether rabies virus was required for the syndrome. This issue was addressed by injecting nonhuman primates with tissue homogenates similar to those used for rabies vaccination, and the clear finding was that acute encephalitis could be produced by such immunizations 16 .",

Myelin basic protein (MBP) was the first identified antigenic component, followed by many others, including myelin proteolipid protein (PLP) and myelin oligodendroglial glycoprotein (MOG). Cells rather than serum were found to transfer disease to naive hosts 18 , leading to the finding that T cell clones could mediate paralytic inflammation 19 and that these clones reacted to short peptides of myelin proteins 16, 20 . Relapsing forms of EAE could be readily produced in some mouse strains, most prominently SJL/J (ref. 21) .",

Using mice for EAE experiments entailed sacrificing neurobehavioral and neuropathological complexity, as well as restricting imaging studies (as can be gauged by comparison with the research done using marmosets 22, 23 , for example). Most studies are presently done using C57BL/6 mice, where disease is induced by immunization with MOG peptide, representing residues 35-55, emulsified in Freund's adjuvant that is supplemented with Mycobacterium tuberculosis extract. Mice are also injected with pertussis toxin on the day of immunization and 2 days thereafter. This protocol is used because it works reproducibly and because it allows one to take advantage of the wealth of genetic resources on the C57BL/6 background but introduces an offsetting array of limitations. As examples of the information lost, this C57BL/6 model of EAE is monophasic, without relapses; the T cell component is predominantly CD4 + ; and spinal cord is affected out of proportion to brain, unlike in MS but in common with most other forms of EAE, although there are a few exceptions 24 .",

            "text": "EAE contributed enormously to our understanding of autoimmunity, neuroinflammation, cytokine biology and immunogenetics, and it surely changed the course of MS research 25 . One major MS treatment came directly, in a mechanism-based fashion, from EAE research 26 . Other treatments, such as glatiramer acetate (a mixture of oligomeric peptides), were first studied in EAE, but their application in disease treatment has wandered fairly far from the initial rationale for their development 20 . For the most part, EAE has proven poorly predictive of treatment success in MS, particularly as concerns p e r s p e c t i v e npg p e r s p e c t i v e manipulations of inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-12, IL-23, IFN-\u03b3 and TNF 27 . The reasons underlying these misadventures remain under investigation, and it is by no means clear why cytokines with such central functions in immunity and inflammation perform so differently in MS than in EAE. It is plausible that humanized mouse EAE models will help to clarify some of these issues 28 . EAE nevertheless has unequivocal value as a model of the inflammatory aspects of MS and can be regarded as an essential tool in the armamentarium of the MS researcher. As with every reductive system used in science, it is critical to be mindful of what the implement can do and what it cannot. It is widely recognized that the utility of EAE is restricted by virtue of its being induced through the administration of powerful immune adjuvants. This perception has led to development of spontaneous EAE models. For varied reasons, including their being highly engineered, such models have not been widely applied, despite yielding fascinating insights 29, 30 .",

The viability of persistently demyelinated axons in EAE tissues are reduced, but little or no progress has been made in understanding why. More limiting still, mice with EAE do not exhibit the ongoing functional deterioration of patients with MS, so that tissue changes cannot be correlated to behavioral deficits. Using C57BL/6 mice sacrifices the opportunity to study relapses. Remyelination cannot be well studied in EAE: lesions occur stochastically with regard to timing and localization. Further, wellperformed mechanistic studies of myelin damage in EAE tissues have been vanishingly rare. Investigations using EAE to examine potential benefits of treatment with neuronal or oligodendroglial growth and survival factors has been disappointing. The prototypic finding has been that many factors regarded as 'neurobiological' exert remarkably strong effects on immune and inflammatory cells, making any results of treatment uninterpretable 31 . EAE is mainly a disease of subpial spinal cord white matter, whereas MS is mainly a brain disease with prominent demyelination of the cerebral and cerebellar cortex. Involvement of the cortex in EAE has been difficult to discern and therefore not well studied. Most forms of EAE are generated by immunization regimens that elicit CD4 + T cell responses. The roles of CD8 + T cells, which predominate in MS lesions and show clonal expansion 32 , have been difficult to capture using conventional EAE models 33 . EAE studies have not been very productive concerning roles of B cells in MS 34 , despite recent clinical-trial data demonstrating their importance 35 .",

Both agents have been incisively dissected at the levels of viral and host genetics to identify mechanisms of viral clearance and control as well as demyelination. TMEV has been productive in clarifying determinants of delayed, inducible autoimmunity in the wake of the immune response to neurotropic virus 36 . TMEV research has also provided insight into the origin of some behavioral signs following demyelination of the murine CNS 37 . The pathogenesis of TMEV-induced demyelination probably differs from that in MS, where persistent viral infection of the CNS has not been demonstrated. MHV provides a model in which viral infection of the CNS is cleared and controlled by remarkably well-defined mechanisms. Notably, MHV encephalitis carries a sequela of inflammatory demyelination in the absence of detectable pathogen gene expression 38 .

To balance this concern, it is important to note that each of the pathogenic processes listed above (inflammation, immunity, demyelination and remyelination) is pertinent both for relapsing (inflammatory) MS and for progressive (neurodegenerative) MS. Furthermore, aspects of CNS aging also are relevant for progression in MS, which is strikingly age dependent. Given these considerations, it makes sense for investigators to be explicit about which clinical aspects and mechanistic hypotheses are being modeled when their experimental data are presented. This approach would enable better understanding by readers of the intent of each research study.
