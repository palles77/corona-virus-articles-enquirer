            "text": "| Zoonotic spillover, which is the transmission of a pathogen from a vertebrate animal to a human, presents a global public health burden but is a poorly understood phenomenon. Zoonotic spillover requires several factors to align, including the ecological, epidemiological and behavioural determinants of pathogen exposure, and the within-human factors that affect susceptibility to infection. In this Opinion article, we propose a synthetic framework for animal-to-human transmission that integrates the relevant mechanisms. This framework reveals that all zoonotic pathogens must overcome a hierarchical series of barriers to cause spillover infections in humans. Understanding how these barriers are functionally and quantitatively linked, and how they interact in space and time, will substantially improve our ability to predict or prevent spillover events. This work provides a foundation for transdisciplinary investigation of spillover and synthetic theory on zoonotic transmission. 502 | AUGUST 2017 | VOLUME 15 www.nature.com/nrmicro PERSPECTIVES \u00a9 2 0 1 7 M a c m i l l a n P u b l i s h e r s L i m i t e d , p a r t o f S p r i n g e r N a t u r e .

            "text": "The phenomenon of cross-species spillover is the defining characteristic of pathogens that transmit from vertebrate animals to humans (zoonoses). The public health burden that is presented by zoonoses includes outbreaks of pathogens such as Ebola virus, influenza A virus (H1N1) pdm09 and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), as well as the ongoing transmission of endemic pathogens, such as Salmonella spp., Leptospira spp., Trypanosoma spp., Mycobacterium spp. and West Nile virus [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] . Spillover transmission is promoted by successive processes that enable an animal pathogen to establish infection in a human. The probability of zoonotic spillover is determined by interactions among several factors, including disease dynamics in the reservoir host, pathogen exposure and the within-human factors that affect susceptibility to infections. These factors can be partitioned into three functional phases that describe all major routes of transmission (FIG. 1) . In the first phase, the amount of pathogen available to the human host at a given point in space and time, known as the pathogen pressure, is determined by interactions among reservoir Although many recent articles have examined the fields of zoonoses or emerging pathogens 2,3,10-15 , a synthetic mechanistic understanding of animal-to-human transmission is lacking 14, 16 . Much attention has been dedicated to the characterization of emerging infections 3, 11, 12, 15 ; for example, the high frequency of zoonoses among emerging infections 3, 12 , their socio-economic, environmental and ecological drivers 2, 13, 17, 18 , and their phylogenetic and geographical distribution 3 . Similarly, the phases of zoonotic emergence in the human population 11, 14, 18 , adaptation and compatibility of zoonoses in humans 10, 11, 19 , and approaches to modelling the transmission of zoonoses 14, 16 , have also been addressed in the literature. However, a comprehensive understanding of the processes that enable a pathogen from a vertebrate animal to establish infection in a human, and how these processes are hierarchically, functionally and quantitatively linked, remains a fundamental deficit in research on zoonoses 14, 16 . In this Opinion article, we present a mechanistic structure that integrates the determinants of spillover and the interactions among them (FIG. 1) . However, we do not address broader determinants of pathogen emergence or factors that affect disease severity or onward transmission in humans.",

For example, reservoir hosts or vectors are often targeted for control before the concatenation and relative influence of processes that lead to spillover are understood, which sometimes leads to inefficient or even counterproductive interventions 20 . In other cases, multiple mechanisms are aggregated in analyses that obscure the interactions or heterogeneities that drive risk. Although the aggregation of mechanisms may be appropriate at times, identifying discrete mechanisms and how they interact to drive spillover is essential to recognize the assumptions that are implicit in simpler models, and to clarify which processes must be modelled explicitly and host distribution, pathogen prevalence and pathogen release from the reservoir host, followed by pathogen survival, development and dissemination outside of the reservoir hosts. Second, human and vector behaviour determine pathogen exposure; specifically, the likelihood, route and dose of exposure. Third, genetic, physiological and immunological attributes of the recipient human host, together with the dose and route of exposure, affect the probability and severity of infection.",

This is a key question for pathogens such as Leptospira interrogans, Giardia spp., and Escherichia coli O157, and the answer may depend on modes of contact and dose-response relationships in humans (see below).

These processes can be represented as the probability that the pathogen (shed, harvested or colonized in a vector) survives and is infectious at a given point in time, and is dispersed or transported to a particular location ( a | Determinants of spillover are being studied by researchers in many disciplines. b | A pathogen must overcome a series of barriers to transmit from one species to another. If any of these barriers is impenetrable, spill over cannot occur. Spillover of some pathogens requires that gaps (depicted as holes) in all of the barriers align within a narrow window in space and time (indicated by the blue arrow, see Supplementary information S2 (movie)). For other patho gens, protracted survival in the environment (for example, Bacillus anthracis spores 109 ), or wide dissemination (for example, the spread of aerosolized Coxiella burnetii by wind 35 ), may stagger the alignment of barriers to spillover. c | Top panel: hypothetical dose available over time for a given pathogen. In scenario 1 (dashed light blue line), the pathogen is excreted consistently from infected reservoir hosts. In scenario 2 (solid light blue line), the pathogen is excreted in regular but short high-intensity pulses over time. In both scenarios, the mean dose over the time interval is the same. Bottom panel: the likelihood that this dose will translate into infection depends on the functional form of the dose-response relationship. If the dose-response relationship is linear (green line), these two excretion scenarios generate the same total probability of spillover over the time interval shown. However, for nonlinear dose-response relationships, the total probability of spillover differs between scenarios. If the relationship is sigmoidal (red line), there is some probability of spillover whenever the dose exceeds zero (indicated by the intensity of the red shading in the top panel), but the total spillover probability in scen ario 2 is markedly higher. In the extreme case in which the recipient host can be infected only by a dose that exceeds a sharp threshold, as suspected for Bacillus anthracis 67, 68, 79 , the pathogen in scenario 2 will spill over when the dose peaks above the threshold (blue solid line near peak), but the pathogen in scenario 1 will never spill over.",

For example, the primary driver of pathogen pressure for rabies virus is the prevalence of infection in key hosts (such as domestic dogs 36 ). Nonlinearities in rabies transmission generate a threshold effect in susceptible host density below which the pathogen cannot persist. These thresholds can be used to set vaccination targets for disease elimination 37 . By contrast, pathogen pressure of L. interrogans is also affected by fluctuations in reservoir host density (such as rodents 29 ), and prevalence and shedding from infected animals 29 . However, if human exposure occurs through mechanisms that aggregate and disperse pathogens shed by many individuals (through accumulation in the environment, sustained survival after exiting the host 38 , and dispersal through rain, rivers and flood waters 39 ), the detailed dynamics in reservoir hosts do not matter because they get integrated out by the environmental reservoir. In this scenario, spillover risk is determined by the aggregate pathogen pressure, human behaviours that determine exposure and the integrity of within-human barriers to infection. For example, when flooding mobilizes Leptospira spp. during the wet season in Brazil, human exposures can become widespread and epidemics of spillover infection can occur 40 . During these extreme environmental events, control efforts must focus on preventing exposure to contaminated sources (for example, by wearing protective clothing and boots 41 ) and reducing the infectious inoculum rather than reducing the source of pathogen shedding, as the release of Leptospira spp. into the environment by animal reservoirs occurs before the extreme precipitation. Similarly, pathogen pressure of E. coli O157 is affected by the density of its cattle host population 42 , by variation in shedding among individuals and by prevalence in herds 43 . Each of these factors can be highly skewed and seasonal 44, 45 . If spillover events are driven by contact between humans and cattle, then variation in pathogen load among animals would interact with nonlinear doseresponse functions to determine spillover risk (see below). However, this individual variation matters less if human exposure to exposure through different routes of transmission 52 . Human behaviours, such as occupational interactions with reservoir host animals, the consumption of certain animal products or the use of particular environments, may increase the risk of infection 53 .",

However, nonlinear interactions between pathogen pressure, human risk behaviour and environmental factors can lead to unexpected complexity, especially for vector-borne diseases. For example, in rats, both a high prevalence of Y. pestis and high mortality may be necessary to drive outbreaks of bubonic plague in humans. Widespread exposure of humans through flea bites occurs only after a decrease in the abundance of rats, which are the primary hosts of Y. pestis in peridomestic settings 54 . Indeed, historically, high rat mortality ('rat-fall') was an indication of an imminent human plague epidemic 32 . Thus, killing rodents in response to cases of bubonic plague in humans could inadvertently increase the severity of the epidemic 54 . Conversely, and controversially, zooprophylaxis, which involves diverting vector bites from humans by increasing the local population density of another animal host, may decrease the risk of human exposure 55 . For example, the presence of chickens and dogs in rural areas of Argentina occurs after human-mediated dispersal of the pathogen through irrigation, meat processing and food transportation [46] [47] [48] . In this instance, outbreaks of E. coli O157 are determined by the pathogen pressure on vegetables or in hamburger meat, potentially derived from many sources. As the dose that is required for E. coli O157 spillover is thought to be very low 49, 50 , public health policies aim to completely eliminate pathogen pressure in food that is processed for human consumption 50 . To achieve this goal, interventions are focused on creating successive bottlenecks in several barriers to spillover, including decreasing cattle density, preventing faecal contamination during meat processing and increasing cooking temperatures to reduce exposure dose in ground beef 43, 47, 51 . Cumulatively, these efforts are usually successful, but high levels of shedding from cattle during summer can sometimes overwhelm interventions 47 .",

Within-host barriers to infection vary widely and depend on the specific combinations of pathogen, host species and Figure 3 | Bottlenecks to spillover. Different barriers permit or constrain the flow of pathogens from one species to another. The figure is illustrative, owing to the lack of sufficient data for more than one or two barriers for any given system. The width of the gaps in barriers represents the ease with which a pathogen can flow through the barriers and will vary depending on context. The question marks represent points at which the barriers are especi ally poorly understood and highlight gaps in our knowledge of some patho gens that are of global concern (for example, the lack of information on disease dynamics in reservoir hosts of Ebola virus). Many rabies virus reservoirs, such as domestic dogs, are widely distributed. The prevalence of rabies virus is generally low and the incidence of spillover closely tracks the prevalence of infection in the reservoir host. Rabies virus is almost always fatal to spillover hosts 25 . Interventions are usually aimed at reducing the preva lence in reservoir hosts through vaccination 37 . Leptospira interrogans survives in water and soil after being shed in the urine of a wide range of rodents and other reservoir hosts 29 . Key bottlenecks to the zoonotic spillover of this patho gen are exposure and within-host barriers. For example, during floods in Brazil, many humans that are exposed do not become infected, probably because the initial within-host barrier, the skin, is not penetrated 41 . However, once L. interrogans penetrates the skin (for example, through skin wounds), 1-10 leptospires may be sufficient to cause systemic infection 110 . Therefore, wearing protective clothing and boots is an effective control measure 41 . Important bottlenecks to Escherichia coli O157 spillover include heterogeneous shedding from cattle 43, 44 (although it is still unknown whether super-shedding is a characteristic of particular individuals or is a transient phase that occurs in most cattle 42 ). In some contexts, exposure is an important bottleneck; for example, when the pathogen is eliminated from food through cooking. Widespread dispersal leads to uncertainties about the source of many outbreaks 46, 47 , and weak within-human barriers enable low doses of E. coli to cause infection 49, 50 . Humans are frequently exposed to Toxoplasma gondii carried by domestic cats and intermediate hosts, but the parasite rarely causes disease because most humans have strong within-host immunological barriers. Cats are widely and densely distributed, but the prevalence of T. gondii is low and cats shed oocysts only once in their lifetime 111 . However, sporulated oocysts survive in the environment for long periods of time 112 . Limiting exposure to oocysts may prevent spillover; however, this is challenging when it is unclear whether cats or the environment are the major sources of infection in humans 111, 113 . Ebola virus has not been isolated from bats and the definitive reservoir bat species is unknown 114 ; therefore, characteristics of infection in bats are unknown 114, 115 . The pathogen is released through excretion or slaughter, then survives for up to a week, depending on the environmental conditions 116 . The most tractable bottlenecks for intervention may be the zoonotic exposure of humans through interaction with bats, bushmeat or the carcasses of other species 97, 117, 118 , because once exposed, the within-host barriers to Ebola virus may be extremely low 119 . pathogen 60, 61 . Even when pathogens can replicate within cells, several barriers can prevent their transmission to other cells 62, 63 and thus the establishment of an infection. For example, avian influenza virus must pass through a series of within-host barriers to infect a human, including mucins in respiratory tract excretions, specific receptor molecules that constrain virus entry into cells and have different distributions in the respiratory tracts of different host species, suboptimal viral polymerase that restricts the ability of the virus to replicate in cells of the human respiratory tract, viral neuraminidase that is inefficient in its role in the release of influenza viruses from infected cells, and innate immune responses that are initiated early and that block infection in both infected and neighbouring cells 63, 64 .",

            "text": "From an epidemiological perspective, these within-host interactions between zoonotic pathogens and hosts can be encapsulated by the functional relationship between pathogen dose and the probability of an infection. Although there is much to learn about dose-response relationships, they are expected to be nonlinear as, at minimum, they must saturate at high doses because the probability of infection cannot exceed one 65 . This nonlinearity imposes a filter on the dynamics of pathogen pressure and exposure (FIG. 2c) . If the dose-response relationship is highly nonlinear, such that small changes in dose lead to large changes in the probability of an infection, then variation in any of the upstream factors that culminate in an exposure dose (including released dose, pathogen survival and human behaviour) may have disproportionate effects on the probability of spillover. Such effects could generate opportunities for targeted control measures. Moreover, nonlinear dose-response relationships may imply that infrequent high-intensity exposures are more likely to cause spillover infections than continuous low-intensity excretion. This phenomenon has been reported for occupational exposure to Bacillus anthracis aerosols; tannery workers who were exposed to infrequent high doses of B. anthracis spores in imported goat hair were more likely to die of anthrax than those who were exposed to frequent low doses of B. anthracis spores [66] [67] [68] . Conversely, if doses are far below the inflection point on the dose-response curve (FIG. 2c) , then the system may be insensitive to changes in dose. If the doseresponse function is close to linear, the total exposure dose over time is equal and host responses do not change as a consequence of early exposures, then longer-term exposure Once a pathogen has penetrated the within-host barriers to replicate and disseminate in the new host, the outcome of the infection may range from subclinical elimination of the microorganism to the death of the new host, and from dead-end spillover infection to sustained human-to-human transmission. For many important zoonotic pathogens, such as HIV or Zika virus, the transmission that drives the current public health crisis is human-to-human 81, 82 and the events that led to spillover are long past. Although understanding disease severity and onward transmission is essential for understanding the consequences of emerging infectious diseases, these processes are beyond the scope of this article. Our current knowledge of the biological features of pathogens and characteristics of host-pathogen interactions that determine these outcomes are described elsewhere (for example, see REFS 83, 84) .",

Research methods that group multiple barriers or integrate data over space and time may not capture these dynamics. For example, ecological niche models are often used to study zoonotic risk by assessing the distribution of reservoir hosts or vectors 85 , but this approach overlooks variation in downstream barriers that might drive risk. Alternatively, niche models that are based on the documented occurrence of spillover may capture the accumulated distribution of all conditions that enabled barriers to be breached over time (FIG. 1) , but they cannot isolate the precise barriers that affect spillover risk (for example, see REF. 86 ). Therefore, niche models tend to overestimate the spatial range of spillover risk and do not readily enable extrapolation to novel conditions 87 . Examples of this include Hendra virus and Marburg virus, which can be excreted in discrete temporal and spatial pulses from their bat reservoir hosts 20, 88, 89 . However, for spillover, shedding must align with environmental and bat population conditions that generate levels of pathogen pressure that are sufficient to produce an infectious dose (FIG. 2) , and with exposure behaviours and susceptibility of the recipient hosts. As some of these conditions vary among seasons and years, the pattern of outbreaks in livestock or humans has high spatial and temporal variability 20, 89 .

Therefore, very little is known about the interactions between dose, timing of exposure and probability of infection. The current dose-response paradigm is based on discrete transient exposures, but the effects of protracted or cumulative exposure to environmental pathogens (for example, to low concentrations of Leptospira spp. in floodwater) are unclear 75 . Repeated low-dose exposure can increase host immunity to infection (for example, as postulated for poultry handlers who are exposed to avian influenza 76 , dairy farmers who are exposed to E. coli O157 (REF. 77) and mice that are exposed to continuous infections of parasites 78 ). However, increases in immunity are not always observed; for example, such effects on immunity were not observed in tannery workers who were exposed to B. anthracis 67, 68, 79 . Moreover, it may be difficult to differentiate between a cumulative dose effect and the increasing opportunity to initiate an infection with each additional low-dose exposure (if each infectious unit has a probability of causing an infection that is above zero) 20,80 . as niche models often summarize risk across large areas and long durations, they overlook important heterogeneities and they lack the specificity that is required for public health intervention. Although niche models can help to identify regional-to-continental concentrations of risk 90, 91 , risk assessments that are more quantitative and more precise with regard to space, time and which barriers they address are needed to guide concrete action.",

            "text": "Epidemiological investigations of spillover also need to account for conditions that are highly dynamic in space and time. If the alignment of gaps in all barriers is fleeting, delayed diagnoses or inconsistent case detection may delay outbreak investigations until the conditions that enabled spillover have changed. Similarly, investigations are sometimes triggered once the case count becomes high. These challenges differ among pathogens with different values of R 0 (the basic reproductive number or expected number of secondary infections caused by a typical infected individual in a susceptible population). For supercritical pathogens with R 0 >1, which can cause major epidemics through sustained transmission in human populations (for example, Ebola virus, Zika virus and the pandemic strain of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) 4,81,92 ), spillover becomes challenging to study because a given human case is likely to be far removed in time or space from the spillover event that triggered an outbreak. Subcritical pathogens with 0 <R 0 <1, which cause self-limiting outbreaks or 'stuttering chains' in human populations (for example, monkeypox or avian influenza viruses 93, 94 ), raise distinct challenges because any given individual could have been infected by either an animal or a human source 16 . It is easiest to study the spillover of pathogens with R 0 = 0 that are not transmitted between humans (for example, rabies virus or West Nile virus 25, 95 ) , in which every case is an instance of spillover. The 2014-2015 Ebola virus epidemic in West Africa is a prime example whereby delayed response and investigation prevented researchers from reconstructing the conditions that initiated the human epidemic of a supercritical pathogen 96, 97 . Ebola virus infection is an extreme example of spillover infection that only occurs during the rare alignment of gaps in barriers, and, accordingly, the precise determinants of risk are poorly understood (FIG. 3) . By contrast, for other zoonoses, such as trypanosomiasis in some parts of Africa, incidence is high because the pathogen flows through consistently wide gaps in barriers to infection",

To our knowledge, all of the processes that are necessary to achieve spillover have not been connected, compared and quantified for any single zoonotic pathogen. We address this gap, in part, by introducing a conceptual and quantitative model that can be used to integrate existing data, identify high-priority data gaps, investigate conditions that widen or align gaps in barriers to spillover, and identify the best gaps on which to focus intervention efforts. We suggest that future research focuses on developing case studies that contribute to fully quantifying the determinants of spillover and their linkages, with the goal of making operational contributions to risk assessment. We provide a mathematical framework that formalizes the ideas presented here to guide the formulation of mechanistic spillover models for particular zoonotic pathogens (BOX 1; Supplementary information S1 (box)). We anticipate that this synthetic framework will provide a foundation for cross-scale data integration, transdisciplinary investigation, and a new body of theory on spillover that is necessary for risk assessment and public health planning.",

The inconsistency between ecological data that suggested high pathogen pressure and epidemiological data that indicated a lack of spillover, focused attention on human behaviours that affect the probability of exposure.

Although each of these microorganisms and parasites can be viewed as a potential pathogen, the vast majority may not cause disease in their natural hosts, and the extent to which they infect or cause pathology in other species, including humans, is unknown 7, 9, 10 . Therefore, discovery alone cannot address the potential risk of spillover. The translation of new discoveries of microorganisms into guidance for public health practitioners requires the identification of the barriers to microbial infection of humans, the conditions that facilitate the breaching of these barriers, and, therefore, the microbiological and environmental contexts that pose the greatest risk to human populations. For the foreseeable future, the greatest practical contribution of pathogen discovery and sequence characterization to the epidemiology of emerging pathogens is likely to be in the rapid post hoc identification of novel pathogens after spillover.",
