The primary goal of this program was to ensure the safety of staff, patients, and the general public by training staff in the correct use of personal protective equipment (PPE) before, during, and after care of patients with EVD. Methods: We delivered a 4-hour experiential training program to frontline health care professionals who would be expected to care for a patient with EVD. The program occurred in a simulation center with multiple flexible spaces and consisted of demonstration, multiple skills practice sessions, and a patient simulation case. We analyzed completed pre-and posttraining questionnaires. The questionnaire assessed their subjective level of confidence in three key areas: donning and doffing PPE, performing clinical skills while wearing PPE, and management of a contamination breach. Results: This program was effectively deployed in the STRATUS Center for Medical Simulation over a 4-month period, with 220 health care professionals participating in the training and 195 participants completing the pre-/posttraining questionnaires. Our intervention significantly increased the confidence of participants on each primary objective (p = .001 for all three stations). Discussion: This interprofessional simulation-based program has been shown to be a well-received method of training clinicians to manage patients collaboratively during an EVD outbreak. Our intent is that the skills taught in this training program would also be transferable to management of other infectious diseases in the clinical setting.",

Clarification regarding the purpose of the program is reinforced: Except for safe donning and doffing and waste-management skills, no new clinical skills will be taught today; this is an opportunity to practice a variety of already-known skills while wearing PPE. The environment in which the PPE is worn will necessitate enhanced teamwork. As there is little chance of getting extra help expeditiously, a willingness to participate in patient care skills outside the normal realm of practice will be required. However, at no time will caregivers be asked to perform any skill outside their scope of practice. The schedule is explained.

Faculty may choose to add additional tasks to the scenario such as insertion of an IV line or managing a fluid spill on the ground. Faculty may refer to the protocols for such tasks included in this publication or reference their own protocols or checklists for specific tasks from their institution. However, the principle learning objective is that participants are able to perform already-known tasks within the confines of the PPE and that all procedures for infection control are strictly adhered to. Donning and doffing the PPE may also be included as part of the scenario or as a separate station depending on the time available.",

Patterns and difficulties with communication should also be debriefed, with an emphasis on how the team performed given the constraints of the environment and the PPE. We did not use video playback in our debriefing session as time was limited and not all of the interprofessional faculty were familiar with our video playback software.

Two-hundred and twenty health care professionals participated in the training. All were asked to complete the same three-question survey before and after participation in the training program. The survey assessed their subjective level of confidence in three key areas: management of a contamination breach, performing clinical skills while wearing PPE, and donning and doffing PPE. These questions were answered using a 5-point Likert scale with the anchors not at all confident and extremely confident. Replies were converted to their numerical value on the Likert scale, and a one-way analysis of variance was performed to calculate the p value.",

As it was a newly designed program for our center, there were many lessons learned along the way. We concede that the design of the program is faculty intensive. However, it was important to have a high faculty-to-participant ratio in order to replicate the high level of supervision that occurs when monitors supervise donning and doffing techniques in the clinical setting. Potentially, faculty requirements could be reduced by using core teaching faculty in the monitor role in the one-to-one donning and doffing sessions. Participants could also perform this role, provided they were instructed in the monitoring process in advance. We utilized a high-fidelity simulation environment for our simulated patient experience station, but most of the course objectives could be achieved in a lower-resource setting by omitting this station if the facilities are not available. The 4-hour program length was necessary to allow for repeated practice of a very complex donning and doffing process with many specific steps to complete.",

Protocols were revised as newer equipment was received, limited by a challenged supply chain as demand outweighed supply from numerous vendors from October 2014 until February 2015. For example, based on drills and exercises, we converted from one respirator brand to another that provided clearer communication and improved cooling. These protocols may vary between institutions and may be revised and altered within single institutions over time. It is important that centers implementing this course establish what the local protocols for PPE use are and adhere to them in order for the training to be applicable to the health care professionals in that institution. At the same time, we also encourage institutions to follow nationally and internationally accepted protocols as closely as possible.",

When originally designing our program, we hoped to include full training on management of a breach. However, it was felt that this was a higherlevel training objective, more suited to the monitors (trained clinical observers), and therefore, this content was removed from the course. Our participants were instructed that if a suspected breach occurred, they would be directed by their trained observer. We decided to leave this question in our feedback survey 16 and found that confidence was increased in this area. We feel this represented a level of confidence in the system of donning and doffing in pairs with an observer guiding. Also, we have not evaluated durability of the training by assessing long-term retention of the skills we trained for. Ideally, implementation of this program should include shorter sessions of follow-up training at regular intervals. No clear guidance for frequency and modality of training for health care workers in this intensive scheme exists, and our models are based on information garnered from national centers of excellence (Emory University, the University of Nebraska). Nongovernmental organizations' national and international efforts should be directed toward outlining standards to define competency, training modalities (functional and tabletop exercises, simulation, web-based training, didactics, etc.), and frequency of those modalities. Medicine can look to other industries, including aviation, as the gold standard for competency measurement and evaluation.",
