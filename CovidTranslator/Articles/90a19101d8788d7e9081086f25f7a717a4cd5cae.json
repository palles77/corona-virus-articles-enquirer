There are many contributing factors to this increased demand, including the ever-increasing prevalence of chronic viral infections such as HIV and hepatitis B and C, and the emergence of new viruses such as the SARS coronavirus. The potential danger of haemorrhagic fever viruses and eradicated viruses such as variola virus being used as bioterrorist weapons has also increased the profile of antiviral drug discovery. Here, the virus infections for which antiviral therapy is needed and the compounds that are available, or are being developed, for the treatment of these infections are described.",

The purpose of this article is to examine how different virus infections should be approached from a therapeutic viewpointnot only those virus infections that we are familiar with, but also new or old virus infections that could emerge or re-emerge, respectively. The basic strategies that are used to design antiviral drugs have been described previously 1 . Here, I will evaluate their usefulness, or potential usefulness, in the control of virus infections. The antiviral drugs that have been formally licensed for medical use are listed in BOX 1. The chemical structures of some of the compounds discussed in this article are shown in FIG. 1 ; the remaining compounds that are discussed are shown in online supplementary information S1 (figure). The viral and/or cellular targets for antiviral agents and potential antiviral agents are presented in TABLE 1. ",

In this situation, infections should be treated with foscarnet, a pyrophosphate analogue, or the acyclic nucleoside phosphonate cidofovir, neither of which depend on the HSV or VZV TK for their antiviral action (FIG. 3) . Also dependent on the activity of a viral TK, but specifically the VZV-encoded TK, are the bicyclic furo(2,3-d)pyrimidine nucleoside analogues (BCNAs) Cf 1368, Cf 1369, Cf 1743 and Cf 1742. These compounds inhibit VZV replication at subnanomolar concentrations and, even at 100,000-fold greater concentrations, are not toxic to host cells 12, 13 . Unlike the 'classical' anti-VZV compounds, the BCNAs are selective for VZV and are therefore inactive against HSV-1 and HSV-2.

Intervention at this stage is expected to block viral DNA cleavage and packaging, leading to an accumulation of empty procapsids and unprocessed concatameric DNA, as has been demonstrated with the (naphthylsulphonylamino)phenylpropanamide BAY 38-4766 (REF. 22 ).

In New anti-HSV agents that target the viral helicase-primase complex 15 -the thiazolylphenyl derivatives BILS 179BS and BAY 57-1293 -were recently reported to have in vivo efficacy in animal models of HSV-1 and HSV-2 infection 16, 17 . These compounds seem to function by enhancing the affinity of the helicase-primase complex for the HSV DNA. This complex comprises three viral proteins -the HSV UL5, UL8 and UL52 gene products (FIG. 3) -which together unwind the double-stranded viral DNA and generate primers for DNA synthesis by the viral DNA polymerase. The antiviral potency of BAY 57-1293 is reported to be superior to all compounds that are currently used to treat HSV infections 18 . These data validate the further pursuit of helicase-primase inhibitors for the treatment of HSV infections.",

The last natural case of smallpox, which is caused by variola virus, occurred in Somalia in 1977, and in 1980 the World Health Organization (WHO) declared smallpox to be officially eradicated. Since then, the only known stocks of variola virus have been held in Atlanta, USA, at the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), and in Koltsovo, Russia, in the State Research Centre of Virology and Biotechnology (VECTOR). If illegally contrast to BDCRB and TCRB, however, maribavir seems to target the UL97 protein kinase 24 . The UL97 gene product has recently been shown to be responsible for the release of HCMV nucleocapsids from the nucleus 25 , which means that maribavir targets a stage in the viral life cycle that follows viral DNA maturation and packaging. Preclinical pharmacokinetic and toxicological studies with maribavir have shown that it has a favourable safety profile and excellent oral bioavailability 26 , and Phase I/II dose-escalation trials in HIV-infected men with asymptomatic HCMV shedding have indicated In humans, anecdotal reports suggest that both topically and intravenously administered cidofovir can successfully treat recalcitrant molluscum contagiosum and orf infections in immunocompromised patients 38 . Cidofovir is licensed for clinical use (in the treatment of CMV retinitis in AIDS patients) by intravenous injection. However, it could also be formulated for topical administration (for example, as a gel or cream) or for oral administration in prodrug form.

In this model (athymic nude mice inoculated intracutaneously with vaccinia virus), systemic treatment with cidofovir when disseminated vaccinia developed caused the lesions to heal and regress.

Mycophenolic acid (MPA), the active component of mycophenolate mofetil, is a potent inhibitor of IMP dehydrogenase and its antiviral and immunosuppressive effects can be attributed to this interaction, which reduces the supply of GTP (FIG. 5) , and therefore, RNA synthesis. The beneficial effect of MPA cannot be ascribed to inhibition of viral replication, as the titre of infectious virus and viral RNA in heart tissue was increased in the mycophenolate-mofetil-treated animals compared with untreated animals 60 .",

Recent work has focused on the development of compounds that interfere with the non-structural (NS) protein-associated NTPase/helicase, serine protease and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RNA replicase) activities of HCV. Halogenated benzimidazoles and benzotriazoles have been proposed to be inhibitors of the HCV NTPase/ helicase 83 but whether they also inhibit HCV replication remains to be determined. Recently, a NS3 protease inhibitor (BILN 2061) was reported to reduce the plasma concentrations of HCV RNA when administered orally for 2 days to patients who were infected with HCV genotype 1, thereby providing proof-ofefficacy for the use of HCV NS3 protease inhibitors in humans 84 .",

As mentioned above, specific treatment for influenza consists of the NA inhibitors (zanamivir and oseltamivir), whereas for RSV infections the only approved therapy is aerosol administration of ribavirin. In practice, however, ribavirin is rarely used owing to the technical burden of delivery by aerosol inhalation. Attempts have been made to develop RSV inhibitors that target the viral fusion (F) protein and therefore block viruscell fusion and syncytium formation. An example is 4,4\u2032-bis-[4,6-bis-(3-(bis-carbamoylmethylsulphamoyl)-phenylamino)-(1,3,5)triazin-2ylamino]-biphenyl-2\u2032,2\u2032-disulphonic acid (RFI-641), which has proved to be efficacious when administered prophylactically (or up to 24 hours post-infection) by the intranasal route in mice, cotton rats and African green monkeys intranasally infected with RSV 98 .",

Of the many nucleoside analogues that are expected to target the SARS-CoV RNA polymerase and for which efficacy has been determined, only N 4 -hydroxycytidine -incidentally, the same compound that has been accredited with anti-HCV activity 73 -showed Several noteworthy compounds have proceeded through clinical trials 124 including the following compounds. The bicyclam AMD3100 (REF. 125 ), which specifically targets CXCR4, the co-receptor that is used by T-lymphotropic (or X4) HIV strains to enter cells, and SCH-C (SCH 351125), which specifically targets CCR5, the co-receptor used by macrophage (M)-tropic (or R5) HIV strains to enter cells. New NRTIs such as \u03b2-D-2\u2032,3\u2032-didehydro-2\u2032,3\u2032-dideoxy-5-fluorocytidine (which is marketed as Reverset TM ) and amdoxovir (which is also known as DAPD; (-)-\u03b2-D-2,6-diaminopurine dioxolane), which are active against HIV isolates with resistance to other NRTIs such as zidovudine and lamivudine. New NNRTIs such as capravirine and etravirine, which are effective against HIV-1 strains carrying the K103N and Y181C mutations that make them resistant to the 'classical' NNRTIs (nevirapine and efavirenz). S-1360, a diketo-acid derivative targeted at the integrase-mediated strand-transfer reaction and the first integrase inhibitor to reach clinical studies. Finally, tipranavir (PNU-140690), which is the first nonpeptidomimetic inhibitor of the HIV protease to be brought to the clinic and which is expected to retain activity against HIV-1 isolates that have developed resistance to the 'classical' peptidomimetic PIs.",

The use of compounds that specifically bind to the viral envelope glycoprotein gp120, such as BMS-378806 [4-benzoyl-1-(4-methoxy-1H-pyrrolo-(2,3-b)pyridin-3-yl)oxoacetyl-2-(R)-methylpiperazine], and which thereby block interaction of gp120 with CD4. Using plant lectins derived from snowdrop agglutinin (GNA), amaryllis lectin (HHA) and aglycons of the glycopeptide antibiotics vancomycin, teicoplanin and eremomycin, which specifically interact with gp120. Developing pyranodipyrimidine inhibitors of HIV integrase, such as V-165, that inhibit integration in a manner that is different from the diketo-acid derivatives (such as S-1360) in that they do not show cross-resistance with the diketo-acid derivatives; and finally, two new classes of compounds (N-aminoimidazole derivatives (NAIMS) and pyridine oxide derivatives), which seem to inhibit a postintegration, transcription transactivation event, the exact nature of which remains to be elucidated.",

Reproduced with permission from REF.1 \u00a9 Nature Rev. Drug Discov. (2002) Nature Publishing Group. b | The mechanism of inhibition of DNA synthesis by HSV helicase-primase complex inhibitors. The helicase-primase complex comprises the viral gene products UL5, -8 and -52. This complex unwinds HSV DNA at the replication fork and primes DNA synthesis at both the lagging and the leading strands. The singlestranded-DNA-binding protein ICP8 binds to single-stranded template DNA. HSV DNA polymerase and its accessory protein UL42, promote leading-and lagging-strand DNA synthesis. The TZP (amino-thiazolylphenyl)-containing compounds (red band) enhance binding of the UL5 and UL52 subunits of the helicase-primase complex to both the leading-and the lagging-strand DNA, resulting in inhibition of helicase activity, primase activity and viral DNA synthesis.
