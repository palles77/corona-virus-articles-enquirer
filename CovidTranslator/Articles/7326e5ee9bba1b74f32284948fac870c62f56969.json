The results showed that blood group A was associated with a higher risk for acquiring COVID-19 compared with non-A blood groups, whereas blood group O was associated with a lower risk for the infection compared with non-O blood groups. This is the first observation of an association between the ABO blood type and COVID-19. It should be emphasized, however, that this is an early study with limitations. It would be premature to use this study to guide clinical practice at this time, but it should encourage further investigation of the relationship between the ABO blood group and the COVID-19 susceptibility.",

Recent clinical observation suggests that patient age, male sex and certain chronic medical conditions (e.g., cardiovascular disease, diabetes, COPD) seem to represent a risk for the infection of SARS-Cov-2 and higher disease severity 1 . There is currently no biological marker known to predict the susceptibility to COVID-19. Landsteiner's ABO blood types are carbohydrate epitopes that are present on the surface of human cells. The antigenic determinants of A and B blood groups are trisaccharide moieties GalNAc\u03b11-3-(Fuc\u03b11,2)-Gal\u03b2-and Gal\u03b11-3-(Fuc\u03b11,2)-Gal\u03b2-, while O blood group antigen is Fuc\u03b11,2-Gal\u03b2-. While blood types are genetically inherited, the environment factors can potentially influence which blood types in a population will be passed on more frequently to the next generation. Susceptibility of viral infection has been previously found to be related to ABO blood group. For example, Norwalk virus and Hepatitis B have clear blood group susceptibility 2,3 . It was also reported that blood group O individuals were less likely to become infected by SARS coronavirus 4 . Here, we investigated the relationship between the ABO blood type and the susceptibility to COVID-19 in patients from three hospitals in Wuhan and Shenzhen, China to test if the former may be a biomarker for the latter.",
