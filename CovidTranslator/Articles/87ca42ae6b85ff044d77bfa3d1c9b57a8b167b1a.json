Motivated by the 2001 FMD epidemic in the UK, we determine, using stochastic simulations and deterministic 'moment closure' models of disease transmission on networks of premises (nodes), network and disease properties that are important for contact tracing efficiency. For random networks with a high average number of connections per node, little clustering of connections and short latency periods, contact tracing is typically ineffective. In this case, isolation of infected nodes is the dominant factor in determining disease epidemic size and duration. If the latency period is longer and the average number of connections per node small, or if the network is spatially clustered, then the contact tracing performs better and an overall reduction in the proportion of nodes that are removed during an epidemic is observed.",

            "text": "Contact tracing, or the identification of individuals that have been in contact with an infectious individual, is commonly used to identify newly infected cases, preferably before they become infectious. Contact tracing was used successfully in the control of the recent epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS; Lipsitch et al. 2003; Riley et al. 2003) and is also important in the control of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs; Clarke 1998; FitzGerald et al. 1998; Macke & Maher 1999) . While in these examples contact tracing occurs at the individual level, in the case of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD), identification is at the group level; tracing of farming premises that have been in 'dangerous contact' (DC) with infected premises (IPs) is a central pillar of traditional disease control (Haydon et al. 2004) . Contact tracing has had varied success in controlling disease. For SARS, contact tracing was considered to have been successful, although only a small proportion of quarantined persons actually had the disease. By contrast, contact tracing was considered to be ineffective in the recent 2001 FMD epidemic in the UK (Ferguson et al. 2001a,b; Keeling et al. 2001; Kao 2003) , because resources were insufficient to identify and remove sufficient DCs quickly enough. When and why contact tracing is useful has been the subject of recent interest (Huerta & Tsimring 2002; Eames & Keeling 2003) .",

However, for many diseases there is a latent or exposed (E ) stage; i.e. a significant delay before nodes become infectious, and this is the case for FMD IPs. As a latent stage should make contact tracing more effective (Fraser et al. 2004) , we consider contact tracing on a network where the disease course includes latency.",

Exposed premises (E ) contain some animals incubating disease and possibly some that are infectious, but the numbers of infected animals are insufficient for it to be a likely source of infection. Infectious premises (I ) hold sufficient infected animals that transmission is likely to occur; this may occur either by direct contact (movement of infected animals into susceptible premises) or indirect contact (transfer of virus without movement of infectious animals onto susceptible premises via equipment movement, aerosols or fomite transfer). While direct and indirect transmissions have distinguishing characteristics (in particular, time to infectiousness), it is assumed for the purposes of this study that these are the same. Positively diagnosed (e.g. by presence of clinical signs or diagnostic test) infectious premises (T ) trigger DC tracing, are immediately isolated and no longer infectious. They are responsible for triggering primary tracing.

Stochastic simulations are implemented on random networks with average degree KZ5, 7, 10, 15, 20 and NZ2000 nodes. For each random graph, we ran multiple simulations starting each time with 10 different infectious nodes. The rates for the above-described transitions are: r 1 Z \u00f0R MF 0 =K \u00de=Inf _P, r 2 Z \u00f0r 0 2 =K \u00de=Tr_P, r 3 Z 1=Lat_P, r 4 Z \u00f0r 0 4 =K \u00de=Tr_P, r 5 Z 1=Inf _P, r 6 Z \u00f0r 0 6 =K \u00de=Tr_P and r 7 Z 1=Tr_P, where r 0 i (iZ1,.,7) are the different transition rates in the equivalent mean-field compartmental model. The basic reproduction ratio (R 0 ) is well known to be the average number of new infections resulting from the introduction of a single infected individual into a wholly susceptible population at equilibrium. Here, R 0 MF is the basic reproduction ratio in the mean-field model (R 0 MF !K ). For individual-based network models, it has been shown (Keeling & Grenfell 2000) that R 0 is lower than for the mean-field equivalent; this is a result of the distributions of k and of the infectious period. The rates describing transitions are renormalized by a factor K to keep the transmission rate constant across different networks; however, we note that R 0 will be different across different networks with the same disease parameters. The parameters Inf_P and Lat_P are the average durations spent by nodes in the infectious and exposed states, respectively. Tr_P is the average duration spent by nodes in the (T ) class. During this time, period neighbours of class (T ) nodes are checked for possible infection. All the processes are considered to occur at the above-specified rates.

To stabilize the results, the epidemic is seeded with 10 randomly placed infected nodes; this results in the transient dip at the initial stages.

These computations are shown in figure 3 for random networks with different K values. As expected, increasing the duration of the exposed state (large Lat_P ) reduces the final epidemic size due to the extra time available for tracing to identify and remove or isolate infected nodes quickly: preferably before they become infectious. This effect is much stronger for small K; if the average number of connections per node is reduced, removal of a connection reduces a greater proportion of the contact network, and so tracing efficiency increases. The higher the value of K, the less the impact of removal of a single connection.",

First, removal of susceptible nodes with rate r 2 0 isolates infected nodes and limits disease spread. Second, removal of exposed and infectious nodes, with rate r 4 0 and r 6 0 , respectively, shortens the transmission period of infected nodes. Here, we investigate the relative importance of these two mechanisms under more general network assumptions. Depending on the average number of connections per node (K ) and the extent of the latency period Lat_P, we investigate the final size of the epidemic, the proportion of the susceptible nodes that were removed, the proportion of exposed and infectious nodes that were removed and the proportion of all the nodes eventually removed by the end of the epidemic (R(N)), for a wide combination of the tracing rates. Since the average number of connections per node and the latency period has similar effects on disease contact tracing, only the two most contrasting cases are presented in the paper. First, in figures 4a and 5a the case of small K and large latency period is presented. Second, in figures 4b and 5b the case of large K and short latency period is discussed. While the first case represents optimal conditions for contact tracing, the second case makes contact tracing difficult. The case of small K and short latency period and the case of large K and long latency period are presented in the supplementary material section (see Electronic Appendix). Figure 4a ,b show the final epidemic size (continuous lines) as a function of the removal rate of susceptible nodes r 2 0 and the removal rate of exposed and infectious nodes r 4 0 Zr 6 0 . For relatively few connections (small K ) and long Disease contact tracing I. Z. Kiss and others 1411 latency periods (large Lat_P ; figure 4a), the final epidemic size is relatively small and is more sensitive to the removal of exposed and infected nodes than it is to the removal of susceptible nodes. In this case, a small increase in tracing (r 4 0 and r 6 0 ) has the same effect as a larger increase in the removal rate of susceptible nodes r 2 0 . With more connections and a shorter latency period (figure 4b), it is more difficult to control the epidemic and the final epidemic size is higher than in the previous case (figure 4a) and the removal of susceptible nodes becomes more important.",

This suggests that if the average number of connections per node is sufficiently low and the latency period is sufficiently long, then contact tracing can efficiently control the final outcome of an epidemic by reducing the infectious period of infected nodes (preferably to zero). However, if K is too large or the latency period is too short, figure 4b shows that although the final size of the epidemic is similar to that in figure 4a, R(N) is much higher: many nodes that were not infected were removed. Hence tracing, even if aimed primarily at removing exposed and infectious nodes, targets and removes susceptible nodes at a higher rate. Figure 5a ,b shows contour plots of the proportions of both susceptible nodes and exposed plus infectious nodes that were removed through tracing. A higher proportion of susceptible nodes were removed on average through tracing, even in the case where the tracing of exposed and infectious nodes occurs at a much higher rate.",

            "text": "Contact tracing will inevitably involve the identification and removal of some nodes that are not infected. It is therefore important to know what proportion of the total population is removed via tracing, and how it relates to the proportion of exposed and infectious nodes that were removed, to the final epidemic size and to R(N) for different contact structures and disease-specific parameters. Figure 5 shows that the proportion of all the susceptible nodes removed through tracing represents a considerable part of the total removed population for all the parameter combinations considered, with the highest values obtained in the case of large K and short latency period. Thus, while not typically the intent of contact tracing, the dominant effect may be the removal of susceptible nodes even if nodes are connected at random over a large group (in this case, 2000 nodes). Removal of tracing's primary targets, exposed and infectious nodes, has only a secondary effect. Evaluation of disease control based on tracing must therefore consider the trade-off between the effort spent identifying infectious contacts, and the problems associated with removing a large number of uninfected nodes. For example, in the SARS epidemic (Lipsitch et al. 2003; Riley et al. 2003) , many individuals were quarantined due to suspected contact with SARS. This was viewed as acceptable, both because of fears over the potential effects of a large epidemic, and because the impact on the quarantined individuals was relatively small. By contrast, in the FMD epidemic in the UK (Ferguson et al. 2001a,b; Keeling et al. 2001; Kao 2003) , millions of animals were culled on farms suspected of harbouring FMD infection, and this was generally viewed as unacceptable.",

While including secondary tracing (i.e. tracing from infected nodes identified via tracing) might affect our results, for FMD, secondary contact tracing did not occur unless existence of disease could be proven-in practice this almost never occurred. In any case, including secondary tracing in our model would only accentuate the differences between the two contact structure extremes (highly clustered connections with few contacts versus randomly connected with many contacts). Given the low impact of contact tracing in dense networks, the impact of secondary tracing is likely to be small.",

            "text": "While these results are generally valid for randomly connected networks or those in which clustering of contacts is important, FMD in the UK is the motivation for this work, and is discussed here in further detail. Soon after discovery of FMD in the UK in 2001, a national movement ban prevented almost all long-range livestock movements and most of the short-range ones, greatly reducing the range and rate of transmission (Ferguson et al. 2001a ). However, new cases after the movement ban remained high, and therefore, revised policies to control disease were implemented. These policies proved controversial, with much of the criticism aimed at the 'contiguous premises' (CP) cull policy, to remove all premises contiguous to IPs within 48 h of disease identification. A major criticism was that many of these premises were uninfected and culled unnecessarily. It is also argued that the CP cull took resources away from the contact tracing that was already in place (discussed in Haydon et al. 2004 ). There has since been considerable scrutiny of the justification for the CP cull, in particular, aimed at the mathematical models that were used in 'real time' to advise policy. These models used both a moment closure approach (Ferguson et al. 2001a,b) and stochastic simulations (Keeling et al. 2001) . While similar to the approach used here, in these FMD models, any IP is able to infect any susceptible premises and the probability of transmission decreases with distance. Other approaches (Morris et al. 2001 ) were more complicated, but relied on the same underlying transmission assumption. In the approach used here, the probability of transmission is equal for all connections, but the number of connections changes and for clustered networks there is a decreased probability of connection with distance. All the FMD models showed that the CP cull would be effective in reducing the final epidemic size. A related approach showed that the CP culling policy may have been more effective than a very good DC culling policy, but acknowledged that the result is likely to be model dependent (Kao 2003) . Another study showed that the number of premises removed was insensitive to overculling, but favoured the CP cull because it reduced the number of IPs and the epidemic duration (Matthews et al. 2003) .",

            "text": "Disease contact tracing I. Z. Kiss and others 1413 A comparison between the FMD models and the model presented here can be made by observing that in Kao (2003) , approximately 30% of transmission was assumed to occur to the six nearest neighbours, which is approximately equivalent to the number of available CPs, and is similar to the assumptions in other FMD models. If all susceptible premises were equally susceptible, removing a single susceptible CP would be equivalent to removing 5% of the susceptible neighbourhood, and in this sense it is roughly equivalent to tracing and removing a single connected susceptible node in a network with KZ20. Removal of a correctly identified DC is equivalent to removing a single, connect and infected node. The FMD models are therefore similar to moderately clustered networks with high K values. Despite the differences in approach, our analysis illustrates why the CP cull was supported by the FMD models. Even with a significant latent period, in a densely connected network (see figures 1b and 2b in the Electronic Appendix), depletion of susceptible premises is more important than the early removal of infected premises. Whether or not CPs were truly at risk of infection is difficult to determine, and lies outside of this discussion, but we note that an examination of prior outbreaks of FMD in the UK suggests that transmission of virus between premises is not always as common as was supposed in 2001 (Haydon et al. 2004 ). If the true value of K was somewhat lower than suggested in the FMD models, this analysis suggests that contact tracing becomes more valuable than previously indicated (Kao 2003) . Our results also confirm (figure 4) the findings of Matthews et al. (2003) regarding insensitivity to overculling, but also shows that this relationship breaks down provided the number of connections per node are sufficiently few, and the duration of the latency period sufficiently long (figure 5a). If this is the case, the extra effort of 'good' contact tracing can make a difference to the effectiveness of control.",
