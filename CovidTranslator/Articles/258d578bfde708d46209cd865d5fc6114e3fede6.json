            "text": "Influenza viruses are members of the Orthomyxoviridae family, and are so named from the Greek orthos, meaning \"straight\" and myxa, meaning \"mucus.\" The Orthomyoviridae family is composed of five genera: Influenzavirus A, Influenzavirus B, Influenzavirus C, Thogotovirus, and Isavirus (Fields et al., 2007) . The genome of these viruses consists of 7-8 segments of negative-sense single-stranded RNA contained within enveloped virus particles (virions) that are either spherical or filamentous in morphology (Levinson, 2006) . The influenza viruses within this genera are categorized as A, B, or C, and differ in host range and severity of disease. Influenza types B and C primarily infect humans; however the severity of illness is relatively mild compared to influenza A viruses. Because influenza B and C remain predominantly within the human population, and neither exchanges genetic material between other influenza types, nor recombines genome segments naturally with viruses from other host species, influenza types B and C do not cause pandemics. In contrast, influenza A viruses infect a wide variety of mammals (including humans, horses, pigs, ferrets, cats, and dogs) as well as avian species. The ability of influenza A viruses to infect such a wide variety of host species that frequently come into close contact with one another permits the occurrence of co-infections with multiple influenza A viruses in permissive hosts that can serve as \"mixing vessels.\" These scenarios can result in the creation of genetic reassortant viruses that express novel antigenic properties, which can cause periodic epidemics in immunologically na\u00efve populations. In some cases these epidemics can spread rapidly and widely enough to be classified as a pandemic. The recent 2009 H1N1 pandemic illustrates the emergence of a highly infectious reassortant strain which resulted when a previous triple reassortment of bird, pig, and human flu viruses further combined with a Eurasian pig flu virus (Trifonov et al., 2009 ) and rapidly spread across multiple continents.",

There are 16 influenza virus HA types and nine NA subtypes (Fouchier et al., 2005) . The HA molecule is involved in the attachment of the virus by binding neuraminic acids (also known as sialic acids) on the surface of host cells. The tropism of influenza A viruses that replicate in different species is at least partially explained by the preferential binding of certain HA molecules with sialic acids with specific linkages found in the penultimate galactose sugar of the sialic acid found on the cell surface. HA from human viruses selectively binds sialic acid residues with an a2,6 linkage, while HA molecules from avian viruses selectively bind sialic acid residues with an a2,3 linkage (Connor et al., 1994) . Human tracheal epithelial cells contain a much higher ratio of a2,6-linked sialic acid residues, while the epithelium lining the gut of ducks contains mostly a2,3-linked sialic acid residues (Couceiro et al., 1993; Ito et al., 1998) .",

            "text": "The HA glycoprotein exists as a precursor molecule (HA0) that relies on cleavage by cellular proteases in order to become biologically active (HA1 and HA2). Upon binding, influenza virus is internalized via receptor-mediated endocytosis, and the resultant acidification of the endosome induces a conformational change in the HA molecule that triggers fusion of the viral and endosomal membranes, releasing the contents of the virion into the cytoplasm (Klenk et al., 1975; Lazarowitz and Choppin, 1975) . This proteolytic activation of HA is essential for viral infectivity and dissemination, and is critical for virus pathogenicity (Webster and Rott, 1987) . In many influenza viruses and low pathogenic avian influenza viruses (LPAIV), the cleavage site in the HA0 molecule contains a single basic reside that is cleaved by trypsin-like enzymes found in the respiratory tract and limited organs, resulting in mild or asymptomatic infection. One of the virulence factors distinguishing highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses (HPAIV) from LPAIV is the presence of multiple basic amino acids present at the cleavage site, which allows for cleavage of the HA0 molecule by ubiquitous intracellular proteases. The increased cleavability of the HA molecules of HPAIV in multiple tissue types results in systemic infection in avian species (Stieneke-Grober et al., 1992; Horimoto et al., 1994) . These studies suggest that the ability to cleave HA is a determinant of the tissue tropism for avian influenza viruses and the differences in tissue tropism can determine the severity of disease outcome. It has been suggested that the HA molecule may play a role in neurovirulence in mammals (Mori et al., 2002) , supported by studies in which a multibasic cleavage site has been cloned into low pathogenic viruses, and increasing virulence (Munster et al., 2010) . The acquisition of natural forms of more cleavable HA may occur through polymerase slippage, mutations, reassortant events with coinfections, or nonhomologous recombination events.",

            "text": "Influenza virus is transmitted primarily by inhalation and by direct contact inoculating the nasal mucosa, infecting epithelial cells throughout the respiratory tract. Tropism for the upper respiratory tract of human seasonal influenza viruses (subtypes H1, H2, and H3) is determined by their preference for the 2,6-galactose-linked sialic acid receptor on ciliated cells. Tropism for the lower respiratory tract among avian strains (H5 and H7 subtypes) stems from preference for binding to the 2,3-gal receptor, particularly on mucin-secreting cells, and explains in part the more common primary viral pneumonia among avian influenza infections (Mastrosovich et al., 2006) . Both types of receptor are distributed throughout the respiratory airways, however, and the swine-origin H1N1 pandemic strains are also complicated by primary viral pneumonia more often than seasonal H1N1 viruses. Seasonal, avian, and pandemic strains exhibit different replication efficiencies in airway epithelial cells, explaining in part the different virulence and transmission phenotypes (Mitchell et al., 2011) . In uncomplicated influenza infection of nasal and upper-airway epithelial cells results in secretion of virus, cytokine and chemokine secretion, influx of neutrophils, and desquamation of apoptotic cells into the airways (Taubenberger and Morens, 2008) . Symptoms are due to both the cytolytic viral infection and the cytokine response, suggested by the coincidence on day 2 of peak viral secretion, peak symptoms, and peak interleukin-6 (IL-6) and interferon-alpha (IFN-a) secretion in volunteers (Hayden et al., 1998) . Death is usually due to severe pulmonary infection as acute respiratory distress syndrome or primary viral pneumonia. In primary influenza pneumonia the virus replicates preferentially in ciliated airway epithelial cells, alveolar macrophages, and type I pneumocytes, although replication can occur in type II pneumocytes and non-ciliated epithelial cells (Kuiken and Taubenberger, 2008) .",

Although timely diagnosis is usually made by virologic assays, retrospective diagnosis is reliable by serum hemagglutination inhibition antibody specific to the infecting strain appearing 5-10 days after infection. Recovery from a repeated infection with the same or cross-reacting subtype of influenza virus is vested primarily in the CD8 \u00fe T-cell memory response. Influenza-specific T cells accumulate in infected lung foci in animal models. The presence of viral antigen directly stimulates the expansion of the influenza-specific T-and B-cell populations, and clearance of the antigen is associated with the disappearance of activated T and B cells in tissue and blood.",

            "text": "Since viruses have coevolved with their hosts, influenza virus stimulates a complex array of innate immune responses in the infected cell and the virus counteracts these responses with multiple virulence factors, primarily the viral NS1 protein, targeting specific pathways in the innate response (Hale et al., 2010) . Pathogenicity, defined as tissue injury and illness, originates from two interrelated features of the infection, the viral replication itself inducing epithelial cell death through the apoptosis program (Ludwig, 2006) and the subsequent host response with cytokine-driven mucosal and systemic inflammation. For example, the recently described viral protein PB1-F2 is proapoptotic, and the NS1 protein has been shown to have both proapoptotic and antiapoptotic activities. NS1 proteins from different strains antagonize type 1 IFN-a/b with different levels of efficiency, yet type 1 IFNs are also primary inducers of apoptosis. Thus the final consequence of these complex, often opposing, activities in regulating viral replication remains controversial. Animal models provide some insights into the pathogenesis of influenza (Belser et al., 2009) . Epizootic strains infect swine, horses, dogs, cats, domestic poultry, and water birds, but only the avians often exhibit neurovirulent behavior. However, the mouse, ferret, guinea pig, and non-human primate have provided the most insight into pathogenesis. Animal models demonstrate that pulmonary inflammation is a direct consequence of infection of bronchial and bronchiolar epithelial cells, alveolar pneumocytes, and alveolar macrophages. Breakdown of the alveolar barrier function of the pneumocytes leads to alveolar flooding, influx of neutrophils and histiocytes, and plugging of small airways with desquamated cells. Nitric oxide and oxygen radicals play a significant role in pulmonary injury in a murine model of H2N2 infection (Akaike et al., 1996) .",

However, a porcine H1N1 virus adapted to a lethal strain for mice did not replicate in any neural or other extrapulmonary tissues (Garigliany et al., 2010) . In the murine model of the neurovirulent WSN strain (evolved from the pandemic 1918 strain), it was not clear whether the encephalitis was a result of direct virusinduced apoptosis or was mediated by immunologic or inflammatory responses (Mori et al., 2003) . In this model selected brainstem neurons are targeted after injection of virus into the olfactory bulb, and local defense is mediated by activated glial cells and apoptosis of infected neurons (Mori and Kimura, 2001) . In the ferret model, the brain is invaded from the olfactory sensory cells in the nasal turbinates through the cribiform plate to the olfactory bulbs and thence to the basal ganglia (Shinya et al., 2011) .",

The cytokines IFN-b and TNF-a have both antiviral and proinflammatory activity. Dysregulation of inflammation induced by the virus is associated with a lethal outcome but depends on the animal model. For example, in mice a lethal HPAI H5N1 strain was more pathogenic, including brain invasion, than the pandemic 1918 strain, and multiorgan dissemination correlated with early and sustained induction of inflammatory genes with active inhibition of the lipoxin-mediated anti-inflammatory response. In contrast, in the nonhuman primate, the 1918 strain was more pathogenic with early upregulation of cell death genes, inflammasome genes and IL-1b, whereas the H5N1 strain downregulated these genes. It must be kept in mind that viral replication rate with direct cytolytic injury also determine the clinical outcome and immunopathology in murine H5N1 infection (Hatta et al., 2010) . Thus, the role of multiple determinants of pathogenesis remains complex, but the relationship between proinflammatory, cerebral metabolism, and regional brain function may offer future insights into encephalopathy (Semmler et al., 2008) .",

The previous major pandemic occurred in 1889-1890 and introduced the first important epidemiologic studies through the work of Otto Leichtenstern (1905) . Viruses were unknown. The beginnings of virology started in the 1890 s with the study of tobacco mosaic virus. Lessons learned from the 1889 pandemic were that it was communicable and never rose spontaneously. The disease was respiratory and had an explosive onset, with pneumonia as the most serious complication. Most cases occurred in winter and spring months. Deaths in 1889 were uncommon and mainly in the elderly. The influenza pandemic could spread around the world but did not travel faster than humans could travel. Twenty-eight years later an outbreak of influenza arose in the spring in Spain. However, there is now evidence that the original viral strain likely occurred in another country and spread early to Spain (Taubenberger, 2006) . The first wave was relatively benign but a second wave occurring in the fall and winter was much more virulent and rapidly spread around the world, causing many deaths. The third wave occurred in early 1919 and was variable in severity. It is estimated that about one-third of the world's population of 500 million was clinically infected during the pandemic (Burnet and Clark, 1942) . The worldwide total number of deaths was estimated to be 40 million (Patterson and Pyle, 1991) . In the United States, there were approximately 675 000 deaths (United States Department of Commerce, 1976) ( Fig. 30 .1). The estimated mortality rate was at least 2.5%, compared with less than 0.1% reported in subsequent influenza epidemics (Marks and Beatty, 1976) .",

It was not until 1930 when the first human and swine influenza viruses were isolated (Shope and Lewis, 1931) and Smith et al. reported the isolation of human influenza in viruses in ferrets in 1933. However, using modern polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques, Taubenberger and others have now sequenced the entire virus using frozen and formalinfixed lung tissue of patients who died during the pandemic (Taubenberger et al., 2005; Taubenberger, 2006) . The virus sequencing and analyses of antibody titers of 1918 influenza survivors (Philip and Lackman, 1962; Dowdle, 1999 ) demonstrated that the virus was a novel H1N1 virus. Reassortment involving genes encoding surface proteins (HA and NA) appeared critical for the production of a pandemic virus allowing the new virus strain to spread and replicate efficiently in humans (Taubenberger, 2006) . Current evidence suggests that the prior circulating influenza virus had an H3 subtype (Dowdle, 1999) and that likely both the NA and HA viral proteins were new. However, neither the 1918 HA nor the 1918 NA genes have obvious genetic features that can be directly related to virulence (Taubenberger, 2006) . Recent interest has focused on the novel non-structural protein NS1. The NS1 protein is effective in blocking type 1 IFN and may have allowed the 1918 influenza to replicate rapidly and spread quickly throughout the upper and lower respiratory tract (Talon et al., 2000; Wang et al., 2000) .",

Patients developed progressive somnolence until they became stuporous or comatose (von Economo, 1917) . The face was characteristically impassive and mask-like. The somnolence lasted 1-2 weeks and gradually diminished or progressed to coma . Patients when somnolent were noted to have ocular abnormalities that ranged from ophthalmoplegia to ptosis, diplopia, and pupillary irregularities.

In rare cases the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was highly suggestive of bacterial meningitis. Calhoun (1920) in Iowa reported a 37-year-old man who in January 1919 developed influenza with secondary pneumonia and recovered. In March he developed the somnolent form of EL and died 2 weeks later. His brain showed brainstem encephalitis and vascular congestion. Anderson and others (2009) reviewed 112 brain autopsies of EL. They found the median age to be 29 years, with the majority occurring between 10 and 40 years. The median duration of the illness was 10 days but the majority were less than 5 days. The neuropathology usually demonstrated inflammation in the brainstem ranging from the midbrain to the medulla. There was lymphocytic perivascular cuffing, foci of parenchymal lymphocytes, foci of glial nodules, and vascular congestion. The thirdnerve nucleus showed focal pathology in half the patients along with midbrain pathology but the substantia nigra had lesions in only 12%. In the cerebral cortex, vascular congestion, cerebral edema, glial cell proliferation, foci of inflammation, and focal hemorrhages were often seen. Thirty-six percent of patients exhibited pathology in the basal ganglia characterized by infiltration of mononuclear cells and congestion. The meninges had vascular congestion but seldom white-cell infiltration. Thus, most patients who died demonstrated evidence of inflammation in the brainstem and occasionally in the cortex plus vascular congestion with evidence of increased intracranial pressure.",

In addition, many physicians during this period were untrained in neurologic diseases and how to perform a careful neurologic exam. As such, many of the clinical descriptions of EL are vague.

Reports from New York City noted the cases paralleled the 1918 influenza pandemic. The most careful study came from a review of cases reported in Seattle, Washington, and in Samoa (Ravenholt and Foege, 1982) . The authors identified 142 EL deaths as well as deaths related to influenza/pneumonia during 1918 through 1926. There was an association with the 1918 influenza but the EL cases clustered about 12 months after each of three waves. The hospital death records of the EL cases did not mention whether the individuals had experienced infection from the 1918 influenza months earlier. The authors also reviewed death records from both Western Samoa and American Samoa. In Western Samoa, the 1918 influenza hit the island in November 1918 and cases of EL appeared over the next few years and disappeared. However, American Samoa had a quarantine and developed no cases of influenza or EL. Finally, the authors presented reported cases of EL from Sweden and Switzerland that clearly demonstrated high peaks of EL that correspond to late 1919 or 1920 and followed shortly after their peaks of influenza.",

Experimental with strains of human influenza virus, pathology identical to EL has not been seen in experimental animals. However, some of the highly pathogenic avian influenza strains demonstrate somewhat similar brain pathology in animals (see end of chapter). The unusually long delay of 6 months or more for the appearance of EL after the 1918 influenza hit a city is difficult to explain. Many reports of acute EL patients did not report that the patients previously experienced influenza. However, the lack of a clear association of EL with a prior influenza infection may be due to the fact that patients rarely sought medical attention for influenza and may not have suffered a severe case of influenza. Nevertheless, there is considerable evidence that EL never developed in patients during their acute influenza infection. Finally, McCall and others (2001) failed to detect influenza RNA in archival brain tissues from acute EL.",

It was recognized that these postencephalitic patients had many features of typical Parkinson's disease but differed in several aspects. First, they were much younger at the age of onset. In a series by Duvoisin and Yahr (1965) from New York City, the mean age of onset of 31 patients who had a reliable history of EL was 29 years, compared to 57 years for cases of classical Parkinson's disease. Similarly, Dimsdale (1946) reviewed 320 cases of parkinsonism diagnosed in the United Kingdom from 1900 to 1942. Of the 100 cases from 1920 to 1930, two-thirds appeared to follow EL. The modal age of onset was in the third decade. The PEP cases could immediately follow EL or develop up to 19 years later but most sought medical attention within 2 years of EL. In both series, atypical features for Parkinson's disease were common and included oculogyric crises, ocular nerve abnormalities (abnormal external ocular movement, pupillary irregularities, poor accommodation), excessive salivation, and marked somnolence. Some patients also had hemiparesis, dystonia, chorea, tics, bulbar palsies, and behavioral disturbances. Various series have estimated that, of survivors of EL, one-third developed PEP by 3 years and one-half after 5 years (Duvoisin and Yahr, 1965) . One epidemiologic study even argued that all Parkinson's disease could be attributed to a cohort that developed the illness around 1920 (Poskanzer and Schwab, 1963) . However, Parkinson's disease had been recognized long before 1920. Charcot noted that Parkinson's disease was the fifth most common disease treated at the Salpetri\u00e8re and the disease was well recognized in New York City when studied from 1888 to 1904 (Hart, 1904) .",

His brain showed persistence or residuals of a brainstem encephalitis with some perivascular cuffing of lymphocytes in the midbrain and elsewhere. There was marked loss of substantia nigra neurons and early gliosis.

Although the Spanish 1918 influenza H1N1 strain has now been sequenced, it has not been assembled into an infectious virion. As such, the full biology of the virus remains incomplete.

Intracranial pressure monitors were often placed with a goal of maintaining the pressure below 20 mmHg (Ropper, 1984) . Hyperventilation was a common method and often continued for days. It was often successful in controlling the intracranial pressure. However, the long-term consequences of brain ischemia produced neurologic sequelae. The risk of long periods of cerebral vasoconstriction were not recognized then. Use of mannitol intravenously was beneficial for 1-2 days but the serum osmolality level needed to be kept below 320 mOsmol/L. Even removal of parts of the calvarium and hypothermia were attempted as heroic methods. Treatment of the hyperammonemia was difficult. Use of peritoneal dialysis, hemodialysis, or plasma exchange did not appear to improve survival (Corey et al., 1977a) . Vitamin K was usually administered.

There was no evidence that these children were given excessive amounts of aspirin as the trigger. However, the aspirin and influenza correlation with RS was not close to one to one. Many children were reported who developed RS associated with influenza but had no exposure to aspirin. Two retrospective studies found that aspirin was given to the majority of children with flu symptoms that did not develop RS (71% and 74%) (Halpin et al., 1982; Waldman et al., 1982) . Nevertheless, when warnings against children taking aspirin when developing a flu-like symptoms were widely circulated in the mid-1980s, the incidence of RS dramatically fell (Remington et al., 1986) .

Second, acetylsalicylic acid was widely administered to children with fevers and flu symptoms since the early 1900s and was widely used even during the 1918, 1958, and 1964 influenza pandemics. Third, acetaminophen was marketed in 1956 and ibuprofen marketed in 1969 (just before the RS epidemic) and given to children with influenza, but neither has been associated with RS. Fourth, clear doseresponse curves for aspirin have not been established for RS. The current argument is that any aspirin consumption can trigger RS in susceptible individuals. Fifth, cases of RS fell simultaneously around the world, although warnings about aspirin were publicized mainly in developed countries.",

In general, animal models have focused on chemicals, infectious agents, or combinations of the two (reviewed by DeVivo, 1984; Deshmukh, 1985) . Mouse models similar to RS have been developed in which juvenile mice given intravenous influenza B virus develop many of the clinical, laboratory, and pathologic features of RS 1-3 days later (Henle and Henle, 1946; Davis et al., 1983 Davis et al., , 1993 Davis and Kornfeld, 1986) . The mice developed elevated arterial serum ammonia, transaminase elevated levels, and hypoglycemia. The animals became lethargic, often developed seizures, and died. Microvesicular fatty degeneration was present throughout the liver with mitochondrial abnormalities seen on electron microscopy that was similar to that seen in human RS livers. The brain demonstrated cerebral edema by light and electron microscopy as well as biochemical studies. No inflammation was seen in the liver or brain but was present in the trachea. No virus was isolated in the liver or brain but virus could be isolated from the respiratory tract. However, viral antigens by immunoperoxidase staining were detected in liver hepatocytes and cerebral endothelial cells. Influenza RNA was also detected in the brain and liver. Thus the liver and brain were nonpermissive influenza viral infections while the trachea infection was permissive and produced virions. The addition of aspirin to the mouse model did not increase mortality (Davis et al., 1985) .",

Clinically, RS does not occur at the peak of the influenza but rather as the patient is beginning to recover. Although influenza virus can be isolated often from other tissues such as the nasopharynx or lungs, it is rare for the virus to be isolated from blood, liver, or brain by conventional techniques (Noble et al., 1975; LaMontagne, 1980) . Liver and brain biopsies examined by electron microscopy have not identified any budding influenza virus-like particles. Unfortunately, PCR techniques and other nucleic acid technology were not available then that would have been more sensitive. There have been no subsequent reports studying stored RS tissues using these technologies. Limited clinical laboratory studies indicated that no particular strain of influenza virus caused RS. The pathologic findings in the liver and brain do not suggest viral encephalitis or hepatitis. Thus, how influenza virus may have caused RS remains a mystery. In a later section, current theories of the pathogenesis of many of the neurologic complications of influenza will be discussed.",

Currently there is no specific diagnostic test but patients usually have flaccid limb weakness that may progress to paralysis, weakness of respiratory muscles requiring mechanical ventilation, and cranial motor nerve palsies. Initially the patient is afebrile and the CSF is acellular and otherwise normal. Delayed motor nerve conduction velocities in peripheral nerves are usually seen by electromyography beginning after 1 week. The peripheral nerve pathology shows inflammation in the nerve with lymphocytes and macrophages surrounding endoneural blood vessels and causing adjacent segmental demyelination (Ropper, 1992) . Acute treatment has either been plasma exchanges or intravenous pooled immunoglobulin. Both have been shown to shorten the time on a respirator and time to walk again (Ropper, 1992) . The syndrome has three different clinical patterns but all are likely to have an autoimmune basis. The strongest associations with GBS have been with preceding infections of Campylobacter jejuni and cytomegalovirus. However, both influenza viral infections and vaccinations with both live and killed influenza viruses have been associated with GBS. Currently there is no evidence that patients with acute influenza are at risk of developing GBS during their respiratory infection. However, there are epidemiologic associations with a preceding influenza-like infection. These associations date at least to 1946 when five cases of GBS developed after an influenza-like illness (Leigh, 1946) . In 1959 two fatal cases of GBS were reported in patients who had serologic evidence of a recent influenza B viral infection (Wells et al., 1959) . Fifty-two cases of GBS in the United Kingdom were serologically examined for evidence of a preceding viral infection (Melnick and Flewett, 1964) . They reported a high incidence of upper respiratory tract infections occurring within 1 month of onset of the GBS but serologic evidence of true influenza was uncommon.",

Before then, no causal relationship between GBS and influenza vaccination had been epidemiologically documented and few cases after vaccination had been reported (Hurwitz et al., 1981) . In response to a perceived threat that the Hsw1N1 strain was similar to the 1918 pandemic strain, 40 million adults were vaccinated with a rapidly produced killed swine influenza vaccine. As the vaccination program proceeded, it became recognized that cases of GBS started appearing. Beginning about the second week after vaccination, a sharp rise in GBS cases occurred that peaked in the third week, followed by a fairly rapid decline that extended a total of 6 weeks (Langmuir, 1979 , Schonberger et al., 1979 Marks and Halpin, 1980) . Since children under the age of 18 were not recommended for vaccination, few GBS cases developed in that age group. Compared to unvaccinated individuals who developed GBS, the increased relative risk rose to 12.7 per 1000 vaccinees for ages 25-44 years, 7.1 for ages 45-64, and 5.6 for ages over age 65 years (Langmuir, 1979) . In all, there were 500 cases of GBS occurring among vaccinated persons, with 25 deaths. For all age groups, the rate for vaccinated cases was 7.3 and for unvaccinated cases 0.77, giving a ratio or relative risk of 9.5 to 1 or an increase of one case of GBS for every 100 000 adult vaccinations (Haber et al., 2009) .",

VAERS and a similar UK reporting system have reported either no increased risk or a minimal increased risk of about one GBS case per million persons vaccinated associated with previous influenza vaccines (CDC, 2010a). Regarding the 2009 H1N1 vaccine, as of April 2010, VAERS reported nearly 127 million doses of the 2009 vaccine being shipped to vaccination providers and having received only 136 GBS reports, which can be compared to a predicted 80-160 cases of GBS per week regardless of vaccination (CDC, 2010a).",

Since then benign acute myositis has been reported in many epidemics of influenza A and B (Middleton et al., 1970; Gamboa et al., 1979; Farrell et al., 1980; Ruff and Secrist, 1982; Hu et al., 2004) . In a series of 316 cases reviewed from the literature, the myositis usually developed in school-aged children (mean age of 8 years) with a 2:1 male predominance (Agyeman et al., 2004) . About three-quarters of the infections were attributed to influenza B virus. The mean interval of myositis from onset of influenza symptoms was 3 days. The calf muscles were usually involved, with 69% being the only muscle group involved and 31% having calf and other muscles involved. The gastrocnemius is commonly tender to palpation (75%) and could have a mild swelling but the overlying skin was seldom warm to the touch or red. Walking is difficult and usually done with a limp. If both calves are involved, the child often refuses to walk. Serum creatine kinase is always elevated but rhabdomyolysis and renal failure occur in only 3%. The outcome is excellent, with symptoms of focal pain resolving in a median of 3 days. No studies have demonstrated that administration of anti-influenza drugs is effective in shortening the duration of the myopathy.",

Currently elevated serum cytokines are postulated to be the cause. The severity of the myalgia correlates with the severity of the influenza respiratory symptoms and with the titer of influenza virus shed from the nasopharynx (Hall et al., 1979) . Children and occasional adults can develop a focal degeneration of mainly leg muscles that often demonstrates segmental involvement in muscle fibers. It is postulated that the respiratory infection results in a transient viremia (Naficy, 1963; Stanley and Jackson, 1966) that somehow localizes to calf muscles, producing mainly a non-permissive localized myopathy with limited inflammation. However, the occurrence of myositis did not correlate with the quantities of virus shed in the nasopharynx (Hall et al., 1979) .",

In one series of 73 children hospitalized for febrile seizures, a viral cause was thought to be responsible in 86% (Lewis et al., 1979) . Published series have determined that several common viruses are associated with febrile seizures and include influenza, adenovirus, parainfluenza, respiratory syncytial virus, and rotavirus (Chung and Wong, 2007) . In series of hospital visits for febrile seizures, about 20% are associated with influenza (Chiu et al., 2001; Chung and Wong, 2007) . The majority had a single uncomplicated partial or generalized seizure but 20-33% had more complex seizures that could be prolonged for more than 15 minutes, multiple seizures occurring within 24 hours, or postictal impairment of consciousness lasting for more than 30 minutes (Chung and Wong, 2007) . Patients with febrile seizure should not have abnormalities on their EEG or neuroimaging and at discharge should be normal. In a series of 842 patients hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed influenza, 72 (0.9%) developed neurologic complications (Newland et al., 2007) .

For epidemiologic purposes, the CDC defines influenza-related encephalopathy as patients who had altered mental status or personality changes lasting >24 hours and occurring within 5 days of an acute febrile respiratory illness that was proven subsequently to be laboratory-confirmed influenza (Newland et al., 2007) . The term encephalitis implies inflammation of the brain. Clinically the two conditions may be difficult to distinguish without a CSF examination, brain biopsy/ autopsy, or good neuroimaging (Davis, 2000) .",

Lyon et al., 2010.) The precise incidence of neurologic complications during any year has been difficult to determine (Newland et al., 2007) . However, since a large majority of individuals with influenza never seek medical attention or are hospitalized, the risk must be less than 1% of those infected. Most individuals with the encephalopathy do not have pre-existing neurologic illness or have a chronic immunosuppression, but clearly some do. In the past two decades, children less than 6 years appear to be at a greater risk than adults for developing ANE from the influenza A H3 and H1 strains. Uncomplicated encephalopathy occurred more often in children during the influenza A (H1N1) pandemic but that may have reflected that mainly children developed the H1N1 infection.",

            "text": "There is increasing interest that the encephalopathy associated with the respiratory influenza infection may be due to several cytokines. However, production of proinflammatory cytokines is a normal defense mechanism in an influenza infection. A comprehensive study of 20 normal volunteers who were nasally infected with influenza A Texas/36/91 (H1N1) virus were serially followed with nasal and serum cytokine levels which correlated with symptoms and nasal viral titers (Hayden et al., 1998) . Influenza virus infection and replication in the respiratory tract directly injure the nasal and tracheobronchial epithelium. The resulting loss of respiratory epithelial cells is a major reason for several symptoms accompanying the infection, such as cough, depressed tracheobronchial clearance, and altered pulmonary function. Influenza virus induces a cascade of host immune responses leading to mucosal inflammation and the influx of polymorphonuclear cells, lymphocytes, and macrophages into the respiratory tract. It is this immune response that is responsible for resolution of the infection and possibly the clinical systemic symptoms. In the volunteer study, virus was recovered from nasal washes beginning on day 1, peaking on day 2 and persisting up to day 7. Peak influenza virus titers on day 2 were about 10 3.7 50% tissue culture infectious doses per mL. The patient temperature also peaked on day 2. Respiratory and systemic symptoms, such as fever, headache, and myalgias, also peaked on day 2 and persisted to about day 6. Two cytokines, IL-6 and IFN-a, peaked in the nasal washes and serum on day 2 but serum TNF-a peaked on day 4. Serum IL-6 levels were about fourfold above normal. Plasma and serum IL-6 levels nicely correlated with total systemic symptoms on days 2-4. Considerable evidence finds that the cytokines studied were produced locally in the respiratory tract by both infected respiratory epithelial cells and immune invading cells. Another study reported similar findings (Kaiser et al., 2001) . Thus, several cytokines appear responsible for both clearance of the respiratory infection and production of common influenza systemic symptoms.",

Furthermore, when patients were divided into categories ranging from simple respiratory illness, to febrile seizures, and encephalopathy, those with the encephalopathy generally had the highest serum levels (Ichiyama et al., 1998 (Ichiyama et al., , 2004 Kawada et al., 2003; Ito et al., 1999; Fukumoto et al., 2007) . Individuals with ANE often, but not always, had extremely elevated serum and CSF levels of IL-6 (Yoshikawa et al., 2001; Ichiyama et al., 2003a; Okumura et al., 2009 ). Thus, there was a correlation between very elevated serum cytokine levels and poor outcome from death or neurologic sequelae. The viral pneumonia complicating the pandemic 2009 H1N1 infection is a primary source of elevated cytokine production .",

Detection of influenza RNA by RT-PCR assays has been reported to be positive in both brain tissue and CSF (Fujimoto et al., 1998; Morishima et al., 2002; Steininger et al., 2003; Togashi et al., 2004; Ekstrand et al., 2010) .

Support for the non-permissive theory exists in experimental animals. Following intranasal inoculation, intravenous inoculation, or direct muscle injection, human influenza virus in mice or hamsters produces a nonpermissive viral infection in cerebral endothelial cells causing cerebral edema, in muscle myofibrils causing myositis, in myocardium causing myocarditis, and in hepatocytes causing a fatty steatosis similar to that seen in RS (Davis, 1987; Davis et al., 2000) .

Second, avian influenza strains of subtype H5 were never recognized in humans until 1997 during a small outbreak in Hong Kong. Evolution of these strains through mutation resulted in greater viral replication efficiency in mammalian cells (Twu et al., 2007) . Subsequently explosive spread of avian influenza began in 2004 and within 2 years had spread throughout Asia with extension to Europe and Africa. Multiple clades of H5N1 viruses have evolved over the last dozen years (Chen et al., 2006) , complicating the prediction of suitable vaccines. Although the immediate source of infection is usually not identified, contact with domestic poultry has been a constant association with human infection and epizootics of avian flu in domestic fowl have led to the destruction of millions of birds. Low pathogenic influenza viruses are enzootic in feral water fowl but introduction into domestic poultry appears to accelerate adaptation, virulence, and high levels of aerosol transmission among crowded flocks (Lebarbenchon et al., 2010) . H7 and H9 subtypes have also infected humans but the disease is in general mild and not thought to represent a pandemic threat.",

Intranasal inoculation of highly pathogenic H5N1 virus appeared to enter via the mesenteric and myenteric plexi of the enteric nervous system prior to appearing in the brainstem nuclei (Jang et al., 2009) . Inoculation with a dose lethal to half the mice resulted in large weight loss, ataxia, tremor, and bradykinesia in all the animals.

CNS lesions were focal non-suppurative collections of karyorrhectic cells and influenza antigen concentrated in cellular nuclei and surrounding debris, with scattered regions of purulent meningitis.

Most deaths have occurred in China, Vietnam, and Indonesia and are usually due to acute respiratory death syndrome (Kawachi et al., 2009 ) and well-described cases do not include neurologic symptoms and signs (Hien et al., 2004) . In a study of a 6-year-old boy who died of acute respiratory distress syndrome on the 17th day of illness, viral RNA and antigen were not detected in the brain or trachea but were detected in spleen, large and small intestine, and lung tissue, where it was restricted to the type II alveolar pneumocyte (Uiprasertkul et al., 2005) . Positive-strand viral RNA was restricted to the lung and intestine, indicating that viral replication was occurring in only these two organs. Viral dissemination was found in another patient by immunohistochemical demonstration of viral antigen in bone marrow, glial cells, and neurons in the brain and in lymphocytes, but viral replication by culture was found only in the lung and upper respiratory tract (Zhang et al., 2009) . In a careful study of two adults and a fetus, viral antigen and viral RNA by in situ hybridization with sense and antisense probes was detected in type II alveolar epithelial cells, ciliated and non-ciliated tracheal cells, T cells of the lymph node, neurons in the brain, and cytotrophoblasts of the placenta (Gu et al., 2007) . This widespread dissemination of replicating virus was confirmed by strand-specific RT-PCR, real-time RT-PCR, and nucleic acid sequence-based amplification H5 detection assays, yet despite the evidence for viral replication in the brain, there was no histopathologic evidence for inflammation in the brain.",

Influenza virus has the ability to mutate frequently to a new strain as well as reassort some of its eight RNA segments when two strains are co-infected in the same cell. The result is that every year slightly different strains appear in the population, allowing for it to have a widespread circulation. Every decade or so a major change occurs in the HA or NA outer protein coat that enables the virus to become virulent to most of the world's population, setting forth a pandemic. The recent pandemic 2009 H1N1 means the prediction of future pandemics remains uncertain (Taubenberger et al., 2007) .",

If so, we could face an influenza pandemic that carries a mortality rate as high as or higher than the 1918 influenza pandemic.",

However, the incubation period of influenza is only a few days and in the world of airplane travel could spread around the world in weeks before any vaccine could be developed. On the positive side, there are several new approaches in development toward producing influenza vaccines rapidly (Lambert and Fauci, 2010) .",
