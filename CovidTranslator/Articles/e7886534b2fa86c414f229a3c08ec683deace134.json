Predominant enterobacteria from infants with necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) were examined for an unusual ability to ferment lactose . One such isolate, a Klebsiella pneumoniae strain, was partially induced for lactose operon expression in tryptone containing media, and was also pathogenic in a rabbit ileal loop model for NEC . A spontaneous segregant of this strain was no longer partially induced for lactose operon expression, and was no longer pathogenic in the rabbit model . The gene responsible for this phenotype was cloned . The resulting plasmid was shown to cause both partially induced lactose operon expression and pathogenicity when introduced into a laboratory K. pneumoniae strain . A K . pneumoniae mutant deficient in lactose repressor synthesis was also pathogenic in the rabbit model .

Previously it was shown 25 that rabbit loops inoculated with organic acid and protein (mimicking the intestinal content of neonates with NEC) develop all the gross and histological symptoms associated with the disease25 (see Materials and methods) . In this work we show that inoculating rabbit loops with infant formula and appropriate bacterial strains can do the same . This further strengthens our belief that the rabbit model is a valid model for NEC, and lends support to the idea that rapid bacterial fermentation of undigested carbohydrate leads to the appearance of organic acids in the intestine . The proposed model for infectious pathogenicity may not explain every case of NEC, since direct evidence for increased lactose fermentation was obtained only in one out of six isolates of predominant Enterobacteriaceae studied here . On the other hand, nothing in the model requires that increased lactose fermentation be limited to the Enterobacteriaceae . It is still possible that a number of other cases are due to increased lactose fermentation by more fastiduous bacterial species such as Clostridia or other lactose fermenting anaerobes .",

Recently we have begun experiments to try to determine the physiological basis for this color difference . So far we have shown (1) that DC4R is inducible by lower concentrations of lactose (0 .001%) than DC4W ; (2) that induction by 1 lactose (the concentration present in MacConkey lactose agar) is not as efficient as induction by IPTG : DC4R was induced to 27% of maximal /3-galactosidase specific activity and DC4W only to 12%; and (3) that there are differences in the kinetics of induction of strains DC4R and DC4W by lactose (data not shown) . These recent results suggest that the tryptone-mediated induction of the lactose operon is only one manifestation of the genetic difference between DC4R and DC4W . Yet, all the phenotypic differences between DC4R and DC4W are consistent with the idea that DC4R has an increased ability for lactose fermentation in the gut .",

Purified normal flora Enterobacteriaceae controls (DC7-DC12) were obtained from stools of healthy infants at the Westchester County Medical Center nursery, Valhalla, New York . All isolates were identified according to standard procedure using the Microscan system . DC4R is the original DC4 isolate .

MR1, a wild-type K. pneumoniae laboratory strain and plasmid pCR100, 34 a pBR322 derivative containing the entire K. pneumoniae lactose operon, were obtained from Dr Monica Riley . Strain DC17 was isolated following ethyl methanesulfonate mutagenesis 35 of the wild type strain MR1, as follows . Mutagenized cells were grown overnight in phenyl-fl-galactoside to enrich for mutants constitutive in /3-galactosidase synthesis, 36 and individual clones with this phenotype were identified by plating on tryptone plates containing XGal (5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-fl-D-galactoside) . 36 One clone with high /3-galactosidase activity in the presence and absence of inducer, in both tryptone and minimal medium, was designated DC1 7 . Introduction of a wild type lactose operon in trans (by transformation of DC17 with plasmid pCR100) restores the normal inducible phenotype, suggesting that DC17 is most likely deficient in repressor synthesis .

The intestine was then flushed with sterile saline and ligated into approximately 5 cm intestinal loops, with care being taken to preserve blood supply .
