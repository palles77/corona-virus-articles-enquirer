Even though DA rats were kept as inbred lines at different institutes and suppliers, it became obvious that the various breeding stocks differed genetically. To be able to compare the results from different linkage studies it is very import to verify the genetic background of the substrains used in those studies. We performed a genetic and phenotypic analysis of two DA substrains, DA/ZtmRhd and DA/OlaHsd, and found several genetic differences. One of the allelic differences between the DA/ZtmRhd and the DA/OlaHsd strain was located at rat chromosome 3, a 17-Mb large fragment, including the peak marker of a previously identified quantitative trait locus (QTL) for collageninduced arthritis, Cia11. In addition, the substrains exhibited a significant difference in the susceptibility to pristaneinduced arthritis (PIA) and disease severity of collageninduced arthritis and PIA. However, by generating and testing a congenic line, we could demonstrate that phenotypic differences were not due to the contaminating fragment on chromosome 3. Nevertheless, we conclude that DA substrains show distinct genetic differences and caution should be taken when comparing arthritis data from different DA substrains.",

RA is a multifactorial disease of unknown etiology but with a strong genetic component (Dieude and Cornelis 2005) , and recent studies based on various gene-finding strategies have identified the first genes implicated in the susceptibility to RA (Plenge et al. 2007; The Wellcome Trust Consortium 2007; Worthington 2005 ). However, many susceptibility genes still remain unknown. Among the difficulties involved in gene identification in complex traits are factors such as variable penetrance, variable relative risk associated to the disease allele, epistasis, genetic heterogeneity of the human population, and complex interactions between environmental and genetic factors (Lander and Schork 1994) .",

In this study we aimed at characterizing the genetic and phenotypic differences between the two most commonly used DA substrains (DA/ Ztm and DA/OlaHsd) in arthritis linkage studies. This approach provided additional information and a better understanding of previously identified quantitative trait loci (QTL) in those strains.

DA/OlaHsd rats originating from Harlan Europe (Netherlands) were kept and bred as brother-sister matings for more than five generations in the animal facility in Lund in a climate-controlled environment with 12-h light/dark cycles. In the same facility breeding was performed to produce DA.DA/ZtmRhd-Cia11 (CN3) congenic rats. Shortly, one DA/ZtmRhd male and two DA/OlaHsd rats were used to produce the F 1 generation. Six F 1 females were further backcrossed with DA/OlaHsd male rats. After three to four backcross generations, Cia11 heterozygous rats were then intercrossed and only strictly littermate-controlled experiments were performed to ensure that all phenotypic differences originated exclusively from the genetic differences in the Cia11 region. Rats were housed in polystyrene cages containing wood shavings and fed standard rodent chow and water ad libitum.

We therefore performed a whole-genome scan of DA/OlaHsd and DA/ZtmRhd rats using 248 well-established SSLP markers covering all 20 autosomal chromosomes and the X chromosome and compared the allele sizes in the two substrains. The marker selection was based on previous results from crosses between E3/ ZtmRhd and DA/ZtmRhd rats and the E3 strain also was included in the typing as an internal control. As expected, all 248 initially typed markers were found in homozygous form in all three strains and were polymorphic between E3 and DA/ZtmRhd rats. However, we also found markers that differed in allele size between DA/ZtmRhd and DA/ OlaHsd rats. As shown in Table 1 , 35 of 248 markers were found to be polymorphic between the two DA substrains. This means that calculated on those markers, the two substrains differed in 14.1% of their genome. When analyzing markers from each rat chromosome (RNO) alone, the variability ranges from 0% (RNO7, 9, 15, 16) to 20% (RNO2, 3, 10, 14, 18) and up to 44% (RNO13).

We added additional markers in close proximity to those polymorphic regions. For RNO2, RNO5, RNO10, and RNO13 all additional markers were nonpolymorphic, ruling out the possibility of a large contaminating fragment. However, on RNO3 additional markers were found to be polymorphic, suggesting the presence of a large contaminating fragment in this region. It is well known that SSLP regions exhibit a higher mutation rate than the average genome and, thus, the surprisingly high genetic variability could be the result of mutations in the SSLP regions analyzed. However, it is far more likely that it is the result of contamination of one of the DA substrains with another rat strain. To support this theory, we took advantage of the recently performed whole-genome typing of 20,238 SNPs in 167 inbred rat strains, including DA/OlaHsd (Saar et al. 2008) . Although the DA/ZtmRhd substrain was not among those strains, a relatively closely related substrain, DA/HanKini, was included. By comparing this strain with DA/OlaHsd we found seven distinct clusters of polymorphic SNPs on five rat chromosomes (Table 1 ). While six of those regions with sizes between 1 and 4 Mb were considerably small, we found one cluster of SNPs on RNO3 that was more that 10 Mb. We conclude that DA/OlaHsd and DA/ZtmRhd rats differed at a high number of SSLP and at a large contaminating DNA fragment on RNO3.",

We found 13 markers differing between DA/OlaHsd and DA/ ZtmRhd, including the original peak marker D3Wox9 of the Cia11 QTL. Most of them were clustered between position 35.9 and 49.0 Mb. To verify that this difference is indeed the result of contamination and not due to randomly occurring mutations in the SSLP regions, we typed four SNP markers. Because at that point of investigation only a limited amount of strains had available SNP information and the DA strain was not included, we chose the SNPs randomly. Two of the tested SNPs were found to be polymorphic between the substrains. To compare the contaminating fragment to other strains, we included DA substrains (DA/Ztm, DA/ZtmKiru, DA/AlbNSI, DA/Hsd) from different breeders as well as other rat inbred strains such as BN, ACI, F344, and LEW.1F. First, DA/Ztm, DA/ ZtmRhd, and DA/ZtmKiru rats share the same haplotype on RNO3, confirming the close relationship of these substrains (Supplementary Table 2 ). At the same time, DA/ OlaHsd rats from Harlan Europe share the same haplotype with DA/Hsd rats from Harlan USA and DA/AlbNSI rats from the USA. Second, BN and F344 are highly similar to the DA/ZtmRhd haplotype, whereas ACI is nearly identical to the DA/OlaHsd strain. Analyses of all published SNPs in that locus revealed a 100% identical haplotype of DA/ OlaHsd and all substrains of ACI, whereas the DA/HanKini haplotype appeared to be unique. Even so, no conclusion of the origin of the contamination can be drawn at that point and extensive SNP typing will be required to do so. In summary, combination of SSLP analyses and available SNP data conclusively identified a contaminating fragment on RNO3 stretching from 35.6 to 52.3 Mb. After we clearly established the genetic difference between the substrains, we wanted to address whether they also display a phenotypic difference. Because the DA strain is the most commonly used rat strain in genetic studies of arthritis, we investigated the susceptibility to and severity of PIA, a well characterized model for RA. In two independent experiments we immunized the DA substrains DA/ OlaHsd and DA/ZtmRhd with a single intradermal injection of 50 ll pristane, which previously had been found to be the optimal dose to induce arthritis in nearly all DA/ OlaHsd rats. Data from the two experiments showed similar results (Table 2) and thus were pooled, revealing a significant difference in arthritis incidence between the two strains ( Fig. 2a) . Fifty-two of 55 (95%) DA/OlaHsd rats developed arthritis while only 48% (26/54) of DA/ZtmRhd rats developed arthritis (p \\ 0.0001). In addition, the arthritis severity was significantly reduced in DA/ZtmRhd rats. When all animals were included in the analysis, p \\ 0.0001 for all scoring days from day 12 to day 21, when the experiment was terminated (Fig. 2b) . Because there was such a drastic difference in incidence, we performed the analysis including only affected rats. DA/ OlaHsd rats (n = 52) also had a significantly enhanced arthritis severity compared to DA/ZtmRhd rats (n = 26) (Fig. 2c) . The p value was less than 0.01 from day 14 to the end of the experiment. However, the day of disease onset was not different between the rat substrains. The low incidence of DA/ZtmRhd was surprising to us because earlier we found that this substrain displayed a 90-100% susceptibility to PIA. However, previous experiments with the DA/ZtmRhd strain induced PIA with a higher dose of pristane (150 ll). To confirm that the lower incidence seen in DA/ZtmRhd strain in this study was due to the lower amount of pristane injected, we immunized ten DA/ ZtmRhd rats with 150 ll pristane. The result confirmed the data from previous experiments using the DA/ZtmRhd strain; nine of ten rats developed arthritis at day 16 after immunization and the day of onset ranged from day 10 to day 16 (Table 2 ). In conclusion, we demonstrated that DA/ OlaHsd rats were significantly more sensitive to the induction of PIA, which is reflected in the enhanced incidence and severity of arthritis after a single ''low-dose'' injection of pristane.",

We generated a partly congenic rat line by backcrossing DA/ZtmRhd rats to DA/OlaHsd rats for at least three generations to introduce the DA/ZtmRhd fragment on RNO3 into the DA/OlaHsd background. Despite the genetic and phenotypic differences that we observed between the two DA substrains, both strains displayed a high susceptibility to collagen-induced arthritis, which suggested that only a small number of arthritis QTLs differed in these substrains. Thus, we estimated that three backcross generations, a considerably high number of tested animals, and the strict use of littermate controls will be sufficient to investigate the effect of a single locus like the contaminating fragment on RNO3. No difference in arthritis and antibody response between DA.DA/ZtmRhd-Cia11 congenic rats and DA/OlaHsd littermate controls was observed in PIA or CIA (Fig. 4) .",

In the first study by Griffiths et al. (2000) , a F 2 hybrid of (DA 9 BN) was used, and it was found that the DA allele from DA/Bkl rats at Cia11 recessively promotes CIA severity. In a different study by Olofsson et al.

The Cia11 QTL was found to have a recessive-promoting allele in both DA substrains, but because of their genetic differences on RNO3 between 35.6 and 52.3 Mb we can exclude this region for being responsible for the Cia11 effect.

SNP data revealed identical haplotypes between ACI and DA/OlaHsd and no match of the DA/HanKini haplotype to any of the included strains, suggesting the contamination originated from ACI. However, previously performed SSLP typing of the recombinant inbred strain DXEC (unpublished data) showed a number of alleles not matching either of the parental strains DA/Ztm and E3/Ztm. Some of these alleles were found to be identical in DA/OlaHsd rats. Additional SNP typing will be required to conclusively determine the origin of the contamination. In conclusion, we found considerable genetic differences and also major differences in arthritis incidence, severity, and onset of PIA and CIA between the DA/ OlaHsd and DA/ZtmRhd substrains. Thus, there must be at least one yet unidentified CIA and PIA locus between those substrains. In our whole-genome scan we found a second region with polymorphic markers colocalizing with a previously described arthritis-regulating region. The polymorphic SSLP markers D10Rat26 and D10Rat93 on RNO10 are considerably close to the confirmed Cia5 and Oia3 QTLs (Brenner et al. 2005; Holm et al. 2001) and to the Pia10 QTL (Olofsson et al. 2003a ). Although our additional marker screen or the SNP data did not reveal a large contaminating fragment, there is still the possibility of a minor fragment that differs between the DA/OlaHsd and DA/ZtmRhd substrains, inducing the differences in arthritis severity in those rats. Another possibility is that there is a novel arthritis QTL in one of the other contaminated regions or that the difference in arthritis susceptibility is due to a spontaneous mutation in one of the substrains.",
