            "text": "China has a highly mobile population of 140 million rural-to-urban migrants (10% of the total population), a number that is expected to increase in the coming decade. Migrants tend to follow a temporary and circular pattern, moving between cities and provinces in search of improved opportunities. Overall, the migrant population tends to be younger, and is more likely to be male and single, than the general population, although more women and families have also started to migrate in recent years and more people are settling in cities. Indicators of socioeconomic status place the migrants below that of the urban population but above their rural counterparts.",

National policy has long been established on locality-based schemes that depend on household registration (hukou), which is not easily transferable from rural to urban areas. Migrants, therefore, do not qualify for public medical insurance and assistance programmes, and have to pay out-of-pocket expenses for medical services in cities. 1 City governments are faced with the dilemma of not wanting to overburden public fi nances by extending medical cover to migrants versus the need to provide some services to prevent potential public-health crises. Local policies are being piloted in various cities to meet this challenge.",

            "text": "The health-care community in China has focused on three main concerns about migrant health. The fi rst is infectious diseases: this highly mobile group can be both victims and vectors of such diseases, which was particularly highlighted during the epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome. The range of diseases in migrants tends to be diff erent from that in the non-migrant urban population. Migrants have more communicable diseases, such as acute respiratory infections, diarrhoeal, parasitic, and sexually transmitted diseases, and tuberculosis. [2] [3] [4] Hence health authorities are concerned about these diseases, especially sexually transmitted diseases and tuberculosis. [5] [6] [7] The second issue is maternal health. On every indicator of maternal and infant health, the migrant population fares worse than the urban population. 8, 9 Maternal health of migrants is a challenge for urban health-care systems, and many cities have started pilot programmes to address needs. For example, Shanghai has exper imented by off ering subsidies to migrant women to be able to deliver in public hospitals (instead of illegal private clinics), and has achieved good outcomes. 10 But this success has created an ambivalent attitude about making the policy public for fear of attracting too many people into Shanghai.",

On the other hand, studies that include migrants into the urban health system (in the form of reimbursement of some medical expenses incurred in their cities of work, rather than their original rural residences) are still at an early stage. 16 Two additional issues deserve more attention. One is mental and behavioural health, a domain that is understudied in China. International experience suggests that, as with physical health, immigrants also have better mental health than the general population. 17 Whether this is true of China's internal migrants is unknown. Clearly, migrants face a diff erent set of stressors from non-migrants that include high mobility, high risk, low social status, and separation from family and familiar social surroundings.

Although acquiring an infection during the delivery of health care is considered the most frequent adverse event that threatens the safety of patients around the world, 2 health-care-associated infection (HAI) is not included in the global burden estimates. This omission is not the result of a fl aw in the report's methodology, but rather due to the fact that HAI complicates many underlying diseases, and its diagnosis is complex and relies on multiple criteria. Additionally, national surveillance systems exist only in some, mainly high-income, countries, and obstacles to intranational and international benchmarking are many. Never theless, reports of 1\u00b77 million HAIs in the USA in 2002, 3 3 million in Europe in 2006, 4 and a 2-20-fold higher risk of acquiring HAI in developing countries 5 confi rm that this is an appalling problem that aff ects millions of patients and spares no health-care setting worldwide. 6 More public-health action is needed to standardise surveillance methods, identify diagnosis criteria more applicable in low-income and middle-income countries, and generate reliable estimates of the global burden of HAI.",
