One-day-old broiler chicks were vaccinated with live H120 alone (group I) or in combination with CR88 (group II). The two groups were again vaccinated with CR88 at 14 days of age (doa). One group was kept as the control (group III). A significant increase in lachrymal IgA levels was observed at 4 doa and then peaked at 14 doa in the vaccinated groups. The IgA levels in group II were significantly higher than those in group I from 14 doa. Using immunohistochemistry to examine changes in the number of CD4 \u0609 and CD8 \u0609 cells in the trachea, it was found that overall patterns of CD8 \u0609 cells were dominant compared to those of CD4 \u0609 cells in the two vaccinated groups. CD8 \u0609 cells were significantly higher in group II than those in group I at 21 and 28 doa. All groups were challenged oculonasally with a virulent Q1 strain at 28 doa, and their protection was assessed. The two vaccinated groups gave excellent ciliary protection against Q1, although group II's histopathology lesion scores and viral RNA loads in the trachea and kidney showed greater levels of protection than those in group I. These results suggest that greater protection is achieved from the combined vaccination of H120 and CR88 of 1-day-old chicks, followed by CR88 at 14 doa.",

This is probably due to the emergence of new variants of infectious bronchitis virus (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) .

            "text": "An effective and long-lasting protection against IBV infection requires the activation of effector, memory cell-mediated, and humoral immune responses (HIRs) against the virus (12) . A number of studies have reported the systemic and local humoral immune response to IBV vaccination (12) (13) (14) . In chickens experimentally challenged with IBV, the development of a cell-mediated immune response (CMI) has been correlated with effective virus clearance, reduction of clinical signs, and resolution of lesions (15, 16) . The presence of CD8 \u03e9 cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) represents a good correlation for decreasing infection and corresponds with a reduction in clinical signs, as CTL activity is major histocompat-ibility complex restricted, and these T cells mediate cytolysis (17) . It has additionally been shown that the transfer of CTLs obtained from the spleens of IBV-infected chickens was protective to naive chicks against a subsequent IBV challenge (15, 18) . During the course of experimental viral infection, Kotani et al. showed that the clearance of the IBV from the tracheal mucosa occurred at an early phase of the infection and that CTLs at the tracheal mucosa were proposed to be involved in this clearance (19) . To date, there is no information available on the tracheal mucosal leukocytes after vaccination with live IBV vaccines. Nevertheless, Okino et al. quantified the relative expression of the CTL genes in tracheal samples from vaccinated and further challenged birds (20) . The upregulation of these genes in the tracheal mucosa of the fulldose-vaccinated birds was significantly increased at 24 h postinfection (hpi), demonstrating the development of a memory CMI (20) . However, these researchers did not directly measure the activity of CMI, such as the cytotoxic mechanism of CTLs.",

Immediately after preparation, the vaccines and SW were kept in a cold box (at 0\u00b0C). Each chick received a total of 100 l of the appropriate vaccine ocularly (50 l) and nasally (50 l) or SW. To quantify the virus, titration of live IBV vaccine for H120 and CR88 was performed by using 9-to 11-day-old specific pathogen free (SPF) embryonated chicken eggs (ECE) inoculated via the allantoic cavity. The ECE were examined for IBV specific lesions (curling and dwarfing) of the embryos up to 5 days postinoculation. Viral titers were calculated according to Reed and Muench (22) and expressed as the 50% egg infective dose (EID 50 /ml). The titers of the vaccine viruses used were 3.5 log 10 EID 50 / chick and 4.25 log 10 EID 50 /chick for the H120 strain and CR88 strain, respectively.",

The IgA antibody levels in tears and tracheal wash from control chickens (group III) remained below the detectable level. Asterisks indicate that values between the two vaccine groups were significantly different (P \u03fd 0.05) at those time points. Error bars indicate standard error of the mean. the trachea were studied by IHC (Fig. 4) . The number of CD4 \u03e9 lymphocytes in the trachea increased significantly (P \u03fd 0.05) from 4 doa in the vaccinated groups compared to that in the control (Fig. 5a) . The number of CD4 \u03e9 cells reached its peak at 4 doa in group I and at 7 doa in group II before gradually decreasing until 14 doa. After the second immunization, CD4 \u03e9 cells strongly increased in number by 21 doa compared to those of the nonvaccinated controls before declining again.

Viral RNA loads, in all tracheal samples collected, were significantly higher (P \u03fd 0.05) (4.416 log REU RNA) in the unvaccinated challenged group (III) than those in the vaccinated groups (I and II) as measured by real-time RT-qPCR at 5 dpc. Vaccinated groups I and II showed mean log REUs of viral RNA of 1.016 and 0.555, respectively, with no significant difference between these groups (Fig. 6) . Overall viral RNA in the kidney samples of all the groups was low compared to that in tracheal samples.

These researchers emphasized that the vaccination program used in their experiments may not protect the respiratory tract against challenge with every new IBV serotype to emerge. It is also evident that despite the use of Mass-type vaccine at day 0, followed by 793Btype vaccine at 14 doa (the same as in group 1 in this study), a significant number of new IBVs are still emerging under field conditions, e.g., QX, IS/885/00, IS/1494/06, and most recently Q1. Therefore, in order to optimize the use of currently available vaccines, to achieve better immunity, and to assess protection against the newly emerged Q1 strain, the vaccination regime for group II was also included in this work.",

In the groups that received the vaccine at 1 day of age, these low antibody levels may result from the partial neutralization of the vaccine virus in the target tissues by the maternal antibodies present in the broilers at that age, with a consequently low replication of the vaccine virus and poor stimulation of the humoral response (16, 33, 34) . Later, after the second vaccination at 14 doa, an increase in the antibody titers was observed until 28 doa (day of challenge) in groups I and II, with no significant difference in antibody levels between these vaccinated groups (P \u03fd 0.05). HI antibody levels declined by 14 doa against the homologous and heterologous virus antigens, showing similar patterns to declining ELISA titers. Interestingly, by 28 doa, there was no significant difference between vaccinated groups I and II in terms of the levels of antibodies to M41, whereas the HI titers to 793B and Q1 were significantly higher in group II than those in group I (P \u03fd 0.05). The role of antibodies in the control of IBV infection remains controversial, as workers have shown that circulating antibody titers did not correlate with protection from IBV infection (16, 35, 36) . However, other studies demonstrated the importance of humoral immunity in disease recovery and virus clearance (37, 38) . In our study, as expected, the higher HI titers were obtained using antigen homologous to vaccine strains. However, the chicks also appeared to be protected against heterologous challenge. This may be due to the presence of local immunity of the upper respiratory tract induced by vaccination, which reduces the replication of challenge virus.",

In this study, gradual increases in IgA levels were observed in tears for the two vaccinated groups during the first 2 weeks after vaccination. These results are in agreement with previous research reporting similar kinetics of lachrymal fluid IgA production to H120 vaccination (20, 40) . In addition, after the second vaccination, lachrymal IgA levels decreased in the two vaccinated groups, though the levels in group II remained significantly higher (P \u03fd 0.05) than those in group I. This observation may indicate a decrease of lachrymal IgA levels after the second vaccination and is most likely due to partial neutralization of the anti-IBV IgA. A sharp decrease of IgA-IBV in vaccinated chicks was also observed after challenge (41) . In addition, no significant rise in specific lachrymal IgA of vaccinated chickens was detected after subsequent challenge with the Ark-IBV isolate, explaining the probable role of neutralizing antibodies in the lachrymal fluid at the time of challenge (42) .",

            "text": "Consistent with the notion that CMI is protective against IBV (18, 47) , we next sought to study the level of systemic and local cellular immune responses. CD4 \u03e9 cells may directly produce antiviral cytokines, which increase B cell activity and promote the proliferation, maturation, and functional activity of CD8 \u03e9 CTLs, thus playing a critical role in controlling IBV infection (48, 49) . The ratio of CD4 \u03e9 /CD8 \u03e9 cells has been widely shown to be indicative of the general immune system status (50, 51) . In this study, the CD4 \u03e9 /CD8 \u03e9 ratio showed no significant (P \u03fd 0.05) variation among the groups until 14 doa. Nevertheless, the ratio at 28 doa was found to be significantly higher (P \u03fd 0.05) in group II than those in groups I and III, indicating that the second vaccination at 14 doa in group II probably enhanced the cellular immunity by promoting the differentiation and proliferation of CD4 \u03e9 cells in peripheral blood. There are no specific data regarding the effects of different IBV vaccinations on the CD4 \u03e9 /CD8 \u03e9 ratio in peripheral blood with which to compare the present findings; however, Yohannes et al. reported a significantly (P \u03fd 0.05) higher CD4 \u03e9 / CD8 \u03e9 ratio in IBV-infected chicks than in the controls (52) . In addition, the high CD4 \u03e9 /CD8 \u03e9 ratio has been associated with increased humoral incompetence in chickens, and a low CD4 \u03e9 / CD8 \u03e9 ratio and a reduced response against sheep red blood cells were reported earlier (53) . In this study, significantly (P \u03fd 0.05) higher HI titers at 28 doa to 793B and Q1 in group II than those in group I may be attributed to the high CD4 \u03e9 /CD8 \u03e9 ratio in group II at that time point. However, the significance of this in relation to protection remains to be determined.",

At 28 doa, no significant difference was reported between the vaccinated groups. The CD8 \u03e9 cell subpopulation in the two vaccinated groups started to increase significantly (P \u03fd 0.05) at 4 doa, reaching peak at 7 doa, and then declining in number until 14 doa, suggesting that infiltration and recruitment of these cells occur in the first 2 weeks of initial IBV vaccination. Similar to the findings of the present study, in the trachea, CD8 \u03e9 cell recruitment in response to infection was at a maximum by 7 days postinfection (dpi), and CD4 \u03e9 cells were not recruited until 5 dpi. This was reported by Raj and Jones (54) . This work also showed an overall higher infiltration of CD8 \u03e9 cells than of CD4 \u03e9 cells in the two vaccinated groups. This observation is consistent with a previous study (54) , where CD8 \u03e9 cells were also found to predominate compared to CD4 \u03e9 cells in the trachea after IBV infection. Moreover, the current study also documents the significantly higher numbers of CD8 \u03e9 cells in vaccinated chicks of group II than of group I at 21 and 28 doa. The IgA-bearing B cells in the vaccinated groups reached their peak at 14 doa; however, the number of these cells was significantly higher in group II than in group I at 21 and 28 doa (P \u03fd 0.05). This pattern of recruitment of B cells later than either class of T cells is in accordance with earlier studies (55, 56) that contended that local immunity against IBV is mediated mainly by T cells.",

            "text": "From our results, it appears that such overall higher protection may be due to significantly higher levels of CD8 \u03e9 cells in the tracheal tissues in group II than those in group I at the day of challenge. Previous studies have shown that CD8 \u03e9 cells are important contributors to viral clearance in respiratory virus infections, utilizing contact-dependent effector functions, gamma interferon (IFN-\u2425), and tumor necrosis factor alpha (57) . Therefore, we may speculate that group II's higher CD8 \u03e9 cell reaction than that of group I may have contributed to the faster viral clearance after challenge with Q1, explaining the differences in tracheal protection between the vaccinated groups. This possible explanation agrees with other studies that emphasized the involvement of local CD8 \u03e9 cells in the infection of chickens with respiratory pathogens, such as Newcastle disease virus (58) and Mycoplasma gallisepticum (59) . Additionally, group II's higher levels of IgA in lachrymal fluid than those of group I reduced the tracheal histopathological damage, which also corroborates the hypothesis that the traditional role of IgA is to prevent pathogen entry at mucosal surfaces and neutralize virus in infected epithelial cells (60) . IBVspecific IgA antibodies in lachrymal fluid were correlated with resistance to IBV reinfection (37, 39, 41) . Our results are in agreement with a recent study by Okino et al. in which the authors concluded that IBV IgA antibodies in lachrymal secretions and the expression of granzyme-A and CD8 genes in tracheal tissues after H120 vaccination provide a reliable approach to monitor immune protection status in the trachea, as shown by examination for ciliostasis, histopathology, and viral replication (20) . For our study, we aimed to stain for a variety of cell-surface markers and thereby identify the T cell populations infiltrating the trachea. This provides further information about the role of cell-mediated immunity in protection given by different live IBV vaccination regimes against a novel IBV Q1 challenge.",
