We performed a genome-wide comparison between the adaptive evolution of R5 and X4 variants from HIV-1 subtypes B and C. The results showed that R5 and X4 variants experienced differential evolutionary patterns and different HIV-1 genes encountered various positive selection pressures, suggesting that complex selection pressures are driving HIV-1 evolution. Compared with other hypervariable regions of Gp120, significantly more positively selected sites were detected in the V3 region of subtype B X4 variants, V2 region of subtype B R5 variants, and V1 and V4 regions of subtype C X4 variants, indicating an association of positive selection with co-receptor recognition/binding. Intriguingly, a significantly higher proportion (33.3% and 55.6%, P<0.05) of positively selected sites were identified in the C3 region than other conserved regions of Gp120 in all the analyzed HIV-1 variants, indicating that the C3 region might be more important to HIV-1 adaptation than previously thought. Approximately half of the positively selected sites identified in the env gene were identical between R5 and X4 variants. There were three common positively selected sites (96, 113 and 281) identified in Gp41 of all X4 and R5 variants from subtypes B and C. These sites might not only suggest a functional importance in viral survival and adaptation, but also imply a potential cross-immunogenicity between HIV-1 R5 and X4 variants, which has important implications for AIDS vaccine development.",

HIV-1 co-receptor tropism is central for understanding the transmission and pathogenesis of HIV-1 infection [2, 3] . The two major HIV-1 co-receptor tropisms are R5 and X4, using CCR5 and CXCR4 as co-receptors, respectively [4] . R5 and X4 have different viral characteristics, with R5 variants dominating the viral quasispecies early in and even throughout infection [1] , whereas X4 variants classically emerge late in infection. X4 exhibits rapid replication and higher virulence in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) than R5 [5] . The emergence of X4 strains is usually accompanied by an accelerated decrease in CD4 + T cell counts, which leads to an accelerated disease progression [6] . HIV-1 co-receptor switch from R5 to X4 occurs in approximately 50% of HIV-1 subtype B infected individuals during progression to AIDS. This co-receptor switch occurs to a lower extent in HIV-1 subtype C infected individuals [2] . Therefore, an evolutionary comparison between subtypes B and C will help to understand the mechanism of HIV-1 co-receptor switch.",

            "text": "HIV-1 has high mutation rates and is often subject to strong selective pressures from human immune responses [7] . Positive (diversifying) selection has been widely detected in whole genomes, but especially in the env gene of HIV-1 group M, HIV-1 group O, HIV-2 and SIV [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] . Furthermore, an association between positive selection and AIDS disease progression was observed in pediatric and adult HIV-1 infections [15, 16] . Although only the C2V3C3 region of the env gene of R5 variants was used in these studies, increasing evidence showed that positive selection was more prevalent in individuals with slow HIV-1 disease progression than those with rapid disease progression [7, 17] . The reason for this was likely due, in part, to a stronger immune response in slow progressors and a destroyed immune system in rapid progressors. However, the reverse was observed in one study based on HIV-1 subtype B V3 sequences, in which syncytium-inducing (SI) variants appeared to evolve faster than the non-syncytium-inducing (NSI) variants [18] , implying that SI variants were subject to stronger positive selection than NSI variants. The disagreement was likely due to the usage of only part of the env gene in these studies. To reveal the intricate nature of selection pressures driving the evolution of HIV-1 R5 and X4 variants, adaptive evolutionary analyses based on whole env genes, or even whole genomic sequences are required. Therefore, a genome-wide comparison between the adaptive evolution of R5 and X4 variants from HIV-1 subtypes B and C was performed in the present study. We found that R5 and X4 variants underwent obviously different evolutionary patterns and different HIV-1 genes were subject to various selection pressures. We found that a significantly higher proportion of positively selected sites were identified in the C3 region than in other conserved regions of Gp120 in all analyzed HIV-1 variants, indicating that the C3 region might be more important to HIV-1 adaptation than previously believed. In addition, approximately half of the positively selected sites identified in env genes were identical between R5 and X4 variants.

Because the full-length HIV-1 sequences with known co-receptor tropism are very limited, we primarily downloaded all 624 subtype B and 466 subtype C full-length sequences from this database. To determine the co-receptor tropism of each full-length sequence, three robust online prediction tools WebPSSM (http://indra.mullins. microbiol.washington.edu/webpssm) [19] , Geno2pheno (http:// coreceptor.bioinf.mpi-inf.mpg.de/index.php) [20] , and HIV-1PhenoPred (http://yjxy.ujs.edu.cn/R5-X4%20pred.rar) [21] were used based on hypervariable region 3 (V3) of Gp120. Only sequences that yielded consistent prediction results by the three tools were selected and divided into CCR5 and CXCR4 datasets. Because a very short evolutionary distance is able to reduce the discriminatory power [22] , sequences with closer evolutionary distances were deleted. As a consequence, 37 R5 and 33 X4 sequences from subtype B, and 28 R5 and 13 X4 sequences from subtype C were kept. These sequences were divided into four HIV-1 sub-populations for adaptive evolutionary analyses and their GenBank accession numbers are provided in Appendix Table 1.",

The d N /d S ratio (\u03c9) is traditionally used as an index to assess positive selection. The \u03c9 greater than 1 is taken as evidence of positive selection, \u03c9 equal to 1 indicates neutral selection, and \u03c9 less than 1 reflects strong negative (purifying) selection. The analyses of adaptive molecular evolution on all datasets were performed using six codon substitution models: M0 (one-ratio), M1a (nearly neutral), M2a (positive selection), M3 (discrete), M7 (beta), and M8 (beta and \u03c9), as implemented in PAML 4.0 [25] . The details of these models were described in a previous study [26] . The likelihood ratio test (LRT) comparing three pairs of nested codon evolutionary models (M0 vs. M3, M1a vs. M2a, and M7 vs. M8) was used to test against the null hypothesis of no positive selection [27] . The null hypotheses of three pairs of nested models were rejected and positive selection was inferred when the LRT statistic was significant for a \u03c7 2 distribution with the degrees of freedom equivalent to the difference in the number of parameters between nested models. Then the datasets were subjected to the identification of positively selected sites using three within the class with \u03c9 greater than 1 by selection models were admitted as positively selected [26] .",

Comparing the location of positively selected sites in both conserved and hypervariable regions showed that significantly more positively selected sites occurred in hypervariable regions in the X4 sub-populations of subtypes B (41.9%, P=0.041) and C (62.5%, P=0.0002) than in conserved regions relative to the proportion (28.8%) of hypervariable regions in whole Gp120 (Table 5 ). This result implied that Gp120 hypervariable regions of X4 variants were subject to stronger positive selection pressures. We further analyzed the distribution of positively selected sites in five hypervariable regions. In X4 sub-population of subtype B, significantly more sites (61.5%, P=0.0011) appeared in the V3 region that was a critical determinant of co-receptor tropism and the main epitope for eliciting neutralizing antibody [30, 31] compared with other hypervariable regions relative to the proportion (24.5%) of V3 in whole hypervariable regions. This implied a stronger positive selection pressure on V3, consistent with previous observations [7, 18] .

We observed that approximately half of the positively selected sites identified in the env genes were the same between R5 and X4 sub-populations regardless of whether they were subtypes B or C. As an example, in subtype B, 30 of 56 positively selected sites identified in the R5 subpopulation were also detected in X4. In subtype C, 16 positively selected sites were common between the R5 and X4 sub-populations (Table 5 and Figure 1 ). Of additional note were three positively selected sites (96, 113 and 281) in gp41 genes that were common among all four sub-populations ( Figure 1 ).",

These results suggested that certain HIV-1 genes were subject to different selection pressures [8] . Comparison of positively selected sites identified in env of R5 and X4 sub-populations showed that both variants experienced obviously different evolutionary patterns. For the gp120 genes, more positively selected sites were identified in the X4 than in the R5 sub-population (Table 5) , similar to previous observations of highly positive selection in the V3 region of SI compared with NSI variants [18] . However, this pattern was reversed for Gp41, which underwent stronger positive selection in R5 compared with X4 variants (Table 5 ). These results suggested R5 and X4 had different evolutionary patterns.",

The host immune responses including humoral and cellular immune responses were generally assumed to be the most important evolutionary pressures for adaptive evolution observed in the HIV-1 genome [7] . The gag gene encodes viral structural proteins that are less involved in viral replication and co-receptor recognition/ binding. A total of 19 positively selected sites were identified in gag genes of three analyzed HIV-1 sub-populations (R5 and X4 sub-populations from subtype B and R5 subpopulation from subtype C) (Appendix Tables 2 and 3 ). All these sites were found to be associated with at least one of three kinds of epitopes (Ab, CTL and T-helper). In particular, 83.3% and 66.7% of these sites were associated with CTL and T-helper epitopes, respectively. These results indicated that the positive selection pressures on gag genes were primarily imposed by the host immune response. Among these positively selected sites, two sites at 91 and 138 were detected in all three sub-populations, possibly implying an additional importance for HIV-1 adaptation. A previous study demonstrated that a residue change in site 30 of Gag was able to confer a species specific replication advantage in HIV or SIV to adapt to their hosts [32] . The potential roles of sites 91 and 138 in HIV-1 adaptation need to be assessed by site-directed mutagenesis analyses.",

Comparing the location of positively selected sites in Gp120 showed that in X4 sub-populations significantly more sites were located in the hypervariable regions (P<0.05).

Further analyses showed that significantly more positively selected sites were in the V3 region (61.5%, P=0.0011) of subtype B X4 variants, the V2 region (83.3%, P=0.0013) of subtype B R5 variants, and V1 and V4 regions (66.7%, P=0.0316) of subtype C X4 variants compared with other hypervariable regions of Gp120 (Table 5 ).
