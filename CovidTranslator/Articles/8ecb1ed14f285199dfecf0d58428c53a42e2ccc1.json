            "text": "Small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) have become the most powerful and widely used gene silencing reagents for reverse functional genomics and molecular therapeutics. The key challenge for achieving effective gene silencing in particular for the purpose of the therapeutics is primarily dependent on the effectiveness and specificity of the RNAi targeting sequence. However, only a limited number of siRNAs is capable of inducing highly effective and sequence-specific gene silencing by RNA interference (RNAi) mechanism. In addition, the efficacy of siRNA-induced gene silencing can only be experimentally measured based on inhibition of the target gene expression. Therefore, it is important to establish a fully robust and comparative validating system for determining the efficacy of designed siRNAs. In this study, we have developed a reliable and quantitative reporter-based siRNA validation system that consists of a short synthetic DNA fragment containing an RNAi targeting sequence of interest and two expression vectors for targeting reporter and triggering siR-NA expression. The efficacy of the siRNAs is measured by their abilities to inhibit expression of the targeting reporter gene with easily quantified readouts including enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP) and firefly luciferase. Using fully analyzed siRNAs against human hepatitis B virus (HBV) surface antigen (HBsAg) and tumor suppressor protein p53, we have demonstrated that this system could effectively and faithfully report the efficacy of the corresponding siRNAs. In addition, we have further applied this system for screening and identification of the highly effective siRNAs that could specifically inhibit expression of mouse matrix metalloproteinase-7 (MMP-7), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1), and human serine/threonine kinase AKT1. Since only a readily available short synthetic DNA fragment is needed for constructing this novel reporter-based siRNA validation system, this system not only provides a powerful strategy for screening highly effective siRNAs but also implicates in the use of RNAi for studying novel gene function in mammals.",

Primarily, it is involved in the response to exogenous pathogenic and endogenous parasitic nucleic acids [3, 4] , as well as in the basic cellular functions, such as gene regulation and heterochromatin formation [5] [6] [7] . Currently, RNAi has been widely used not only as an extremely powerful approach for reverse functional genomics [8] [9] [10] [11] , but also as an effectively potent strategy for gene silencing-based therapeutics [12, 13] . As compared with other gene silencing reagents, such as antisense oligonucleotides (ODNs), ribozymes, and DNAzymes, siRNAs have apparently become the most powerful and widely used gene silencing reagents for manipulating gene activity in mammalian systems [14] . There are mainly two approaches in generating active siR-NAs in mammalian cells by exogenous delivery of synthetic siRNAs [15, 16] or short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) [17] , and endogenous vector-expressed dsRNAs including shRNAs [18] [19] [20] [21] or siRNAs formed by annealing two complementary sense and antisense RNAs [22] [23] [24] .",

Only a limited number of siRNAs is capable of inducing highly effective target gene silencing in a sequence-specific manner [25] . Moreover, the efficacy of siRNAs is dependent on the specificity of the target sequences within a gene and can only be determined experimentally based on the inhibition of the target gene expression. In order to obtain effective siRNAs, it is necessary to design, synthesize, and screen many distinct siRNAs, which are expensive due to the cost of chemical synthesis of RNA oligonucleotides. Although several recent studies have suggested that the secondary structures of mRNA and mRNA binding proteins might interfere with the target site accessibility for RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), completely dependent on utilizing the rational design strategy for selecting effective siRNAs is not fully programmable [26] [27] [28] [29] . In addition, extensively systematic analyses of the siRNA-specific features revealed that siRNA might have sequence specific characteristics associated with its functionality, such as low to medium G/C content (30-50%), high internal stability at the sense strand 5 0 -terminus, low internal stability at the sense strand 3 0 -terminus, absence of internal repeats or palindromes, and sense strand base preferences (at positions 1, 3, 10, 13, and 19) [25, [30] [31] [32] [33] . Thus, these studies indicate that the efficacy of siRNA is not totally secondary structure-dependent, and strongly suggest that the sequence properties of siRNA may play the major and most important role in determining inhibition efficacy.",

Previously, the effective RNAi probes are identified on the basis of their abilities to inhibit the expression of cognate sequences in an ectopically expressed target gene-reporter fusion chimeric mRNA [34] . The described target gene-reporter-based siRNA validation system totally depends on the availability of cDNA clones, and this may limit the high-throughput application of the method. In addition, sometimes the chimeric mRNA of target gene-reporter fusion construct encodes an impaired fusion protein that exhibits a low reporter activity, which may interfere with the screening and identification of effective RNAi probes. Recently, a reporter-based siRNA validation system has been reported in which the validating system is constructed by fusing a short synthetic DNA fragment containing an RNAi targeting sequence, instead of cDNA, with a reporter gene [35, 36] . In this method, however, in order to generate the corresponding triggering siRNA, it is necessary to have either a synthetic siRNA (or shRNA) or another synthetic DNA fragment for constructing siRNA (or shRNA) expression vector. Thus, this system is inefficient and cost-intensive especially for largescale functional genomic studies.",

Therefore, it is important to establish a fully robust validating system for determining the efficacy of designed siRNAs. In this study, we have developed a reliable and quantitative reporter-based siRNA validation system for functional screening and identification of effective RNAi probes in mammalian cells. In this system, only a short synthetic DNA fragment is required and used for constructing both the targeting reporter and triggering siR-NA expression vectors. By using fully analyzed siRNAs directly against HBsAg or p53 gene expression, we have demonstrated that this reporter-based siRNA validation system could effectively and faithfully report the efficacy of the corresponding siRNAs in a sequence-specific manner. In addition, we have further screened and identified the highly effective siRNAs that could inhibit MMP-7, EBV-LMP1, and AKT1 gene expression by using this system. Since only a readily available short synthetic DNA fragment is needed for constructing both the targeting reporter and triggering siRNA expression vectors, this novel system should not only greatly facilitate large-scale lossof-function genetic screens in mammalian cells but also provide the basis for an improved approach to screen and identify the most potent siRNA for the purpose of the therapeutics.",

This system is composed of a short synthetic DNA fragment and two expression vectors for targeting reporter and triggering siRNA expression (Fig. 1 ). The short synthetic DNA fragment is formed by annealing two complementary senseand antisense-oligonucleotides, which contain a unique RNAi targeting sequence with 19-nt in length flanked by five consecutive adenosine and thymidine residues (As and Ts) at the 5 0 and 3 0 ends as an effective termination signal for transcription of the antisense-and sense-RNA, respectively (Fig. 1B) . The unique RNAi targeting sequence is selected and designed from protein coding region of the target gene according to the sequence-specific characteristics of the effective siRNAs as described in Introduction. To construct the targeting reporter vector, a short synthetic DNA fragment containing a unique RNAi targeting sequence of interest is fused with a reporter gene at the 5 0 -, 3 0 -UTR or is inserted within the reporter gene without interfering in its activity (Fig. 1A) . To make the greatest value and utility of this short synthetic DNA fragment, simultaneously, it is also cloned into a specific triggering siRNA expression vector that contains two functional convergent RNA Pol III promoters (Fig. 1C) . Efficacy of the siRNAs is measured by their abilities to inhibit expression of the targeting reporter gene, which contains the corresponding short synthetic DNA fragment, with easily quantified readouts including EGFP or firefly luciferase. In addition, to make this system complete, it is convenient to include an excellent in vitro cell model, which not only provides an easy cell culture system but also has high transfection efficiency. Because this system is used for screening the highly effective RNAi probes directly against genes with wide range of biological functions, it is better to perform the screening in a non-human and non-mouse cell line. To fit these criteria, the baby hamster kidney fibroblast BHK is chosen as an in vitro experimental model. Moreover, to standardize the experimental procedures, including cell culture conditions and transfection protocols, have been optimized.",

            "text": "To explore further the potential of this method, we have additionally designed and screened two siRNAs targeting the coding sequence of EBV-LMP1. BHK cells were cotransfected with targeting reporter expression vector (pEGFP-3UTR-siLMP1-2 or siLMP1-4; pLuc+-3UTR-siLMP1-2 or siLMP1-4) and triggering siRNA expression vector (pHsH1-shLMP1-2 or shLMP1-4; pDual-siLMP1-2 or siLMP1-4). At 48 h posttransfection, the expression levels of EGFP, GST, firefly, and Renilla luciferases were determined. As the results shown in Fig. 5A , the siLMP1-2 exhibited no inhibition effects on pEGFP-3UTR-siLMP1-2-induced EGFP and pLuc+-3UTR-siLMP1-2-induced firefly luciferase expression as compared with the two standard positive controls, siEGFP and siLuc, indicating that the selected RNAi targeting sequence siLMP1-2 was inactive and non-functional. In contrast with inactive siLMP1-2, the siLMP1-4 exhibited strong inhibition effects on expression of the EGFP and firefly luciferase expressed from pEGFP-3UTR-siLMP1-4 and pLuc+-3UTR-siLMP1-4 targeting reporter expression vectors, respectively (Fig. 5B ). As compared with the efficacy of two standard positive controls, siEGFP and siLuc, the evaluated efficacy of siLMP1-4 was more than 90%. To directly assess the efficacy of siLMP1-2 and siLMP1-4 in Fig. 6 . Effects of selected RNAi targeting sequences of AKT1, including siAKT1-1, siAKT1-2, siAKT1-3, siAKT1-4, and siAKT1-5, mediated inhibition of the targeting reporter and AKT1 expression. Inhibition effects of (A) 3 0 -UTR-siAKT1-1-, (B) siAKT1-2-, (C) siAKT1-3-, (D) siAKT1-4-, and (E) siAKT1-5-mediated targeting reporter gene expression in BHK cells. The cells were cotransfected with 0.5 lg of targeting reporter expression vector (pEGFP-3UTR-siAKT1-1, siAKT1-2, siAKT1-3, siAKT1-4 or siAKT1-5; pLuc+-3UTR-siAKT1-1, siAKT1-2, siAKT1-3, siAKT1-4 or siAKT1-5) and 1.5 lg of triggering siRNA expression vector (pDual-siAKT1-1, siAKT1-2, siAKT1-3, siAKT1-4 or siAKT1-5, siEGFP or siLuc) as indicated by Lipofectamine 2000. At 48 h posttransfection, the cells expressed EGFP were examined by inverted fluorescent microscopy (a); the expression levels of EGFP and GST in the total protein extracts were further determined by Western blot analysis (b); and the expression levels of firefly and Renilla luciferases in the total protein extracts were measured by Dual-luciferase Reporter Assay System (c). The firefly luciferase/Renilla luciferase (Pp-luc/Rr-luc) ratio was normalized and calculated against the control vector (pDual). The plotted data were averaged from three independent experiments and the bars indicate standard deviation. The levels of GST serve as reference protein for loading control. inhibition of EBV-LMP1 expression, BHK cells were repeatedly cotransfected with LMP1 expression vector pCMV-LMP1/EGFP and triggering siRNA expression vector (pHsH1-shLMP1-2 or shLMP1-4; pDual-siLMP1-2 or siLMP1-4). As the predicted, the shLMP1-4 and siL-MP1-4 induced strong inhibition effects on pCMV-LMP1/EGFP-induced LMP1 production, while both the shLMP1-2 and siLMP1-2 were totally ineffective (Fig. 5C ). The phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT signaling pathway plays a critical role in cell proliferation and survival. Perturbations of this signaling pathway have been found in a variety of human cancer cells. Previous studies have shown that constitutively activated PI3K/AKT signaling pathway is sufficient to induce oncogenic transformation of cells and tumor formation in transgenic mice [44] . In addition, inhibition of this signaling pathway results in growth inhibition and apoptosis of cancer cells with in particular elevated this signaling activity. Thus, blocking the hyperactive PI3K/AKT signaling pathway provides a new strategy for targeted cancer therapy, especially for cancer cells whose survival and growth are dominated by constitutively active PI3K/AKT signaling [45] .",

The expression levels of EGFP, GST, firefly, and Renilla luciferases were determined at 48 h posttransfection. As the results shown in Figs. 6A, C, and E, the siAKT1-1, siAKT1-3, and siAKT1-5 only induced low to medium levels of inhibition on expression of the targeting reporter EGFP or firefly luciferase expressed from pEGFP-3UTR-siAKT1-1, siAKT1-3 or siAKT1-5; pLuc+-3UTR-siAKT1-1, siAKT1-3 or siAKT1-5.

According to the results indicated, the RNAi targeting sequences siAKT1-2 and siAKT1-4 exhibited inhibition effect with efficacy more than 90%. To further confirm these results, HeLa and HEK293 cells were transfected with triggering siRNA expression vector, pDual-siA-KT1-1, siAKT1-2, siAKT1-3, siAKT1-4 or siAKT1-5. Consistent with the results obtained from the reporterbased siRNA validation system, the selectively active siAKT1-2 and siAKT1-4 expressed from pDual indeed exhibited high inhibition effects on endogenous AKT1 expression; in contrast, the partially active siAKT1-1, siAKT1-3, and siAKT1-5 had inhibition effects with efficacy of about 60-70% (Fig. 6F) .

This short synthetic DNA fragment can be used for constructing both the targeting reporter and triggering siRNA expression vectors simultaneously. It has been shown that fusion of the targeting reporter gene with the different length of RNAi targeting sequence either 19-or 38-nt exhibits no significant difference on inhibition effects induced by the corresponding siRNAs [35] . These results clearly indicate that the 19-nt sequence in an active siRNA is enough to serve as a functional RNAi targeting sequence for achieving the reporterbased siRNA validation assay. As an ideal and workable system, the RNAi targeting sequence is conveniently and efficiently fused at the 3 0 -UTR of the targeting reporter gene with no regard to its open reading frame and no effect on its translation. On the basis of this principle, the targeting reporter expression vectors, pEGFP-3UTR and pLuc+-3UTR, provide a complete system for constructing any RNAi targeting sequences of interest.",

Inhibition of virus-specific genes by siRNAs has proven to be a potential therapeutic strategy against virus induced diseases. For instance, inhibition of virus replication and gene expression by directly introducing siRNAs into the cells has been reported for numerous viruses [47, 48] , including several important human pathogens such as poliovirus [49] , HIV-1 [22, 50] , hepatitis C virus [51] , influenza virus [52] , dengue virus [53] , and hepatitis B virus [37, 54, 55] . A number of extremely virulent viruses including Ebola, Lassa, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), avian influenza (H5N1), West Nile, and smallpox viruses are highly infectious and cause extraordinarily deadly diseases [56, 57] . Furthermore, there are currently no vaccines or effective therapies available, and in particular these viruses require special containment for safe research. To develop an extremely potent RNAibased therapeutics for these virulent viruses with safety, this reporter-based siRNA validation system could provide a simple and powerful approach for screening and identification of highly effective siRNAs directly against viral gene expression without the need of direct virus culture. Currently, we have successfully screened and identified several highly effective RNAi probes potentially against these virulent viruses by simply using the rational design strategy and this reporter-based siRNA validation system (C.-F.

Although previous studies have described the usefulness of the reporter-based siRNA validation method in screening effective siRNAs, our studies advanced its capacities not only for using in highthroughput application but also for reverse genetic studies of novel gene function. Because of its simplicity and effectiveness, this approach is useful for large-scale analysis of mammalian gene function.",

            "text": "Strategy and experimental design for screening effective RNAi probes using reporter-based siRNA validation system. This reporter-based siRNA validation system is composed of a short synthetic DNA fragment (B) and two expression vectors for targeting reporter (A) and triggering siRNA (C) expression. The short synthetic DNA fragment contains a unique RNAi targeting sequence with 19-nt in length and two specific restriction enzyme HindIII and BglII compatible ends for inserting into the HindIII/BglII-digested targeting reporter and triggering siRNA expression vectors simultaneously. The restriction enzyme compatible ends of HindIII (5 0 -AGCT) and BglII (5 0 -GATC) are underlined. The targeting reporter vector not only contains the reporter gene expression cassette driven by RNA Pol II promoter but also includes two unique restriction enzyme sites, HindIII (H) and BglII (B), for construction of the RNAi targeting sequence at the 5 0 -or 3 0 -UTR or insertion within the reporter gene without interfering its activity. The positions for inserting the RNAi targeting sequence are marked with black triangles. The triggering siRNA expression vector contains two convergent RNA Pol III promoters to drive expression of both the sense and antisense strands of the siRNA, respectively. The short synthetic DNA fragment is also cloned into the HindIII(H) and BglII (B) sites in triggering siRNA expression vector. Targeting reporter and triggering siRNA expression vectors. (A) Constructs of targeting reporter expression vectors. The vectors contain two independent expression cassettes for expression of the targeting reporter and reference protein as well as two unique restriction enzyme sites, HindIII and BglII, located either at the 5 0 -UTR (a and b) or 3 0 -UTR (c and d) of the reporter gene or within a chimeric fusion reporter gene (e) for constructing the RNAi targeting sequence. The unique restriction enzyme sites, HindIII and BglII, for constructing the RNAi targeting sequence are in red. pEGFP-5UTR (a) and pEGFP-3UTR (c) contain the EGFP as targeting reporter and GST as reference protein. pLuc+-5UTR (b) and pLuc+-3UTR (d) contain the firefly luciferase (Fluc+) as targeting reporter and Renilla luciferase (Rluc+) as reference protein. pPre-1, 2, and 3 (e) three vectors contain the chimeric EGFP-firefly luciferase fusion protein (EGFP-Fluc+) as targeting reporter and Renilla luciferase as reference protein, as well as they possess three different reading frame sequences between EGFP and Fluc+ fused sites for inserting RNAi targeting sequences with different reading frames. (B) Constructs of triggering siRNA expression vectors. The siRNA expression plasmid pDual (a) contains two convergent RNA Pol III promoters, mouse U6 (MmU6) and human H1 (HsH1), to drive expression of both the sense and antisense strands of the siRNA, respectively. The shRNA expression plasmid pHsH1 (b)contains only the human H1 (HsH1) promoter to drive transcription of the consecutive sequence of the sense, a loop, and the antisense regions. Effects of active RNAi targeting sequence sisAg3 mediated inhibition of the targeting reporter expression. Inhibition effects of (A) 5 0 -UTR-sisAg3or (B) 3 0 -UTR-sisAg3-mediated targeting reporter gene expression in BHK cells.

At 48 h posttransfection, the cells expressed EGFP were examined by inverted fluorescent microscopy (a); the expression levels of EGFP and GST in the total protein extracts were further determined by Western blot analysis (b); and the expression levels of firefly and Renilla luciferases in the total protein extracts were measured by Dual-luciferase Reporter Assay System (c). (C) Inhibition effects of sisAg3-mediated targeting chimeric fusion reporter gene expression in BHK cells. The cells were cotransfected with 0.5 lg of targeting reporter expression vector pPre-1-sisAg3 and 1.5 lg of triggering siRNA expression vector (pHsH1-shsAg3, shEGFP or shLuc; pDual-sisAg3, siEGFP or siLuc) as indicated by Lipofectamine 2000. At 48 h posttransfection, the expression levels of chimeric EGFP-firefly luciferase fusion protein (EGFP-Fluc+) and Renilla luciferase in the total protein extracts were measured by Dual-luciferase Reporter Assay System. The firefly luciferase/ Renilla luciferase (Pp-luc/Rr-luc) ratio was normalized and calculated against the control vector (pHsH1 or pDual). The plotted data were averaged from three independent experiments and the bars indicate standard deviation. The levels of GST serve as reference protein for loading control.",
