Development of broad-spectrum therapeutics targeting polymerases has been hampered by the extreme sequence variability of these sequences. RdRps range in length from 400-800 residues, yet contain only $20 residues that are conserved in most species. In this study, we made structure-based comparisons that are independent of sequence composition using a recently developed algorithm. We identified residue-to-residue correspondences of multiple protein structures and created (two-dimensional) structure-based alignment maps of 37 polymerase structures that provide both sequence and structure details. Using these maps, we determined that $75% of each polymerase species consists of seven protein segments, each of which has high structural similarity to segments in other species, though they are widely divergent in sequence composition and order. We define each of these segments as a 'homomorph', and each includes (though most are much larger than) the well-known conserved polymerase motifs. All homomorphs contact the template tunnel or nucleoside triphosphate (NTP) entry tunnel and the exterior of the protein, suggesting they constitute a structural and functional skeleton common among the polymerases.",

This interest has been motivated by their unique function-to replicate all forms of life, and confounded by their sequence diversity. As more tertiary structures of polymerase were solved, it became apparent that widely diverse sequences form highly similar structures. There has not, until recently, been a time-effective computational method to make detailed comparisons of these observations. The objective of this study was to clarify the relationship between structure and sequence in a group of RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRps) that replicate many of the viruses that represent significant threats to life throughout the world. We selected well-studied species in order to maximize the amount of experimental data that could be used to evaluate the association of functional residues and structure (Table 1) . We used the StralSV algorithm (1) to perform structure comparisons between all of the selected species. We created maps of residue-to-residue (R2R) correspondence from which we determined the boundaries of structurally similar segments-which we named 'homomorphs'. In contrast to the relatively short lengths of previously described motifs, we found that most homomorphs are long, and each provides a structural connection between the template tunnel or NTP entry tunnel and the exterior of the protein.",

It resembles that of a right-handed palm, with finger-like folds curved inward to form a tunnel that encircles the template that is being processed (3) . Most single-unit polymerases are 400-800 residues in length. Early polymerase studies found that $22 residues are highly conserved in all polymerases, and in most species they are in the same sequential order (4) . Some are clustered, with two to four highly conserved residues within a segment $10 residues in length. The sequence segment that includes each of the highly conserved residues or clusters has been described as a motif. The motifs are arranged in most species in the order: G-F1-F2-F3-A-B-C-D-E.

The references for each of the motifs and species that have been studied are listed in Table 2 ; these references were selected because they included either alignments of one or more motifs with several species, or alignments for a particular motif not found elsewhere. Apart from these conserved motifs, the RdRp sequences are highly variable. An extensive study of picornaviruses by Koonin et al.(6) illustrates this variability. The basis of Koonin et al.'s study was an alignment of 64 species using the algorithm multiple sequence comparison by log expectation (MUSCLE) (7) and a manual adjustment. The alignment included four species that are also in our sample group, and these had a total of 32 conserved residues within sequences $550 residues in length.",

We used the StralSV algorithm (http://proteinmodel.org/), described in detail previously (1) , to perform the analyses. StralSV compares the R2R (structural) correspondence of each sequence in a set of reference sequences to a specified query sequence, beginning at the start of the sequence and continuing to the end, by evaluating successive overlapping segments of a user-selected length. Each of the selected structures was used as a query to all structures available in the Protein Data Bank (PDB release 2011_01_25; number of chains 176 365) (8) . The results were filtered for structural segments of at least 55% LGA_S structure similarity (1) to at least one query segment of 90 amino acids in length (size cutoff for the structural context) from which R2R correspondences were extracted from local tightly superimposed spans: continuous segments of the minimum length of five amino acids. These parameters together contributed to the identification of common regions of structure similarity, which were used to distinguish regions of conservation (structure matches) from regions in which structure deviates (non-matches). The StralSV comparison of each initial query to all structures in PDB resulted in the identification of a final set of 37 PDB structures that were used as a reference polymerase structure set in this study. One representative of each species within the set of 37 PDB structures was used to create an all-against-all structure comparison using StralSV. The species and PDB identities of this reference set are summarized in Table 1 .",

A structure map was created for each set of R2R correspondences derived from each query/template-set StralSV comparison by combining the data for each binary alignment in an Excel spreadsheet. In this article, we report the structure map using poliovirus RdRp as the primary query (Figures 2-8) , although in most cases we include structure maps with other species as query (Figures 2 and 4 -8) . Alternative query species were used when structure similarity of some of the templates was not identified with poliovirus as query (e.g. Motif G in WNV and DENV were identified based on DENV as the query). The query that contributes to non-poliovirus matches is indicated on each alignment ('q' following the species abbreviation). ",

In all structure maps, the conserved segments that we identified based on StralSV R2R correspondences are colored light blue. We defined the homomorph of each motif as the segment consisting of the conserved motif plus the adjacent structurally conserved segments. The length of each homomorph varied somewhat depending on the query. For each query species, the start and end of the homomorphic segment of each motif were recorded, and a 20 \u00c2 20 matrix for each motif was generated to compile the data from each query (data not shown). This matrix was used to identify the minimum start and maximum end of each homomorph, and these values are summarized in Supplementary Table S1 . These values are plotted in Figure 1 , which illustrates the maximal expanse of the homomorphic segments that include each of the polymerase motifs.

We named each of these regions a 'homomorph', defined as a sequence segment that shares a highly similar tertiary structure with other species, independent of the sequence composition. We found that most of the homomorphs were at least twice as long as the corresponding sequence motif. The extent of this expansion is illustrated in Figure 1 . The length of each homomorph was determined separately for each species, using a single structure for each species as the query in a StralSV analysis. The identity of the start and end of each homomorph depends on the structural similarity to a given query. Therefore, there is some minor query-specific variability of the location of the ends of homomorphs that can be observed in Figure 1 . Within the homomorphs, non-matching residues can be used to identify minor differences between species. In most single-stranded RdRp (ss-RdRp) species (PV, COXS, HRV, FMDV, NV, RHDV, SAPV, HCV, BVDV, WN and DENV), the homomorphs of Motif G are the largest (median of 53 residues), followed by A (49), B (46), E (37), F3 (28), D (23), C (17), F1 (10) and F2 (8) . In double-stranded RdRps (ds-RdRps) (PHI6, REOV, ROTAV, IBDV and IPNV), the homomorphs of Motif G are relatively short (median of 12 residues). Several other homomorphs are also shorter in ds-RdRps: B (48), A (41), E (31), F3 (28), D (16), C (12), F1 (11) and F2 (2) . The lengths and occurrences of homomorphs of polymerases that are associated with DNA (HIV, TERT, TAQ, T7 DNAP, T7 RNAP and N4) are variable and will be discussed in the sections describing each motif.",

The spacing between homomorphs is more variable in the ds-RdRps (PHI6, REOV, ROTAV, IBDV and IPNV), and in general larger than in the ss-RdRps. The homomorph of Motif C (hmC) is identified in the birnaviruses despite a sequence inversion that places it before Motif A (5) . Relatively large segments between homomorphs occur in PHI6 between F1 and F3, and in KUNJ, DENV and PHI6 between B and C. The spacing between motifs is notably reduced in HIV and TERT (RdDps). In birnaviruses (IBDV, IPNV), the homomorphs of C and A are only three residues apart, and the distance between the homomorphs of Motif F3 and C is greater than the typical F3-B distance.

In contrast, WN and DENV have the same number of residues for the gaps from A388-R392 and G385-R389, respectively, but these segments were not structurally aligned by StralSV within the parameters used in this study. The segment PV-Y102 to A109 is a b-hairpin unique to picornavirus RdRps (11) .

RHDV, SAPV and BVDV are not well aligned within Motif C using the IPNV query, and therefore are missing from the middle section of Figure 7A (IPNV positions 382-393). The numbering of IPNV and IBDV is sequential, indicating that Motif C precedes Motif A in these species. The numberings of NV and HCV indicate there are R2R matches with IPNV at Motif C, but that over this segment the match is not in sequential order. Using a PV query, however, all of these species have R2R matches over this segment (shown in Figure 6A ). The IPNV query indicates that the structure of Motif C of the birnaviruses more closely matches NV and HCV than the others in the sample set. The difference in linear order that results from the sequence inversion is Figure 6 . (A) The high number of species that align to PV indicates that the structure of Motif C is highly conserved.

For example, using an HCV query, there are R2R matches to TERT, TAQ and T7 DNAP.

Using T7 DNAP as a query (lowest segment of the figure) , only a small portion of the C-terminal edge of Motif D and a few species have similar structures.

HmF is an extensive structure with surface exposure at both ends and near its mid-section at Motif F2 ( Figure 3A-D) . Motif F2 ( Figure 3E ) is analogous to the loop in hmG that varies in composition and length; it is upstream of a highly conserved motif and is speciesspecific. The large size of this homomorph and its positioning that transects the protein while maintaining contact with the template tunnel is consistent with its established role in transcription, which requires both fine-scale stability and large-scale mobility. Motif F3 consists of mostly basic amino acid residues and forms the roof of the NTP entry tunnel (41) ; the characteristic conserved arg residue is essential to nucleotide binding (38) . The required orientation of the F motifs would be stabilized by the loop formed by hmF and the doublestranded segment formed by the extension of the homomorph beyond the motifs. Both the N-terminal and C-terminal residues of the homomorph are exposed at the exterior surface of the protein. In PV, mutations of residues adjacent to the N-terminal are lethal: G149-i-I150 (42) and H149A/K150A (37) .",

Therefore, Motif C as defined in the literature comprises the homomorph.

HmC is highly conserved in the RdRps and highly similar to the DNA-dependent polymerases. Although there is a sequence inversion in the birnaviruses (Motif C precedes Motif A), Figure 7B and C illustrates that despite the difference in sequence order, the homomorphs occupy a similar tertiary position.

The highly conserved residues, GDD, occur near the center of the motif. The primary function of these residues is to coordinate the metal ions associated with the incoming rNTP (45, 43) . In PV, mutation of D to E in either or both positions (D328 or D329) is lethal (50) . In HCV, mutation of G317A is also lethal (51) . However, in birnaviruses the highly conserved residues are ADN, rather than GDD, and mutation to GDD increases RNA synthesis activity (5) . Certain mutations immediately upstream from the GDD motif are lethal in PV: Y326[CHIMS] (50) . This is similar to the effect of the L241-i-S242 at the downstream edge of Motif A in PV. Near the N-terminal end of Motif C in HCV (HCV T312), the mutation D311A characterizes chronic hepatitis (52) . Mutation at the edge of a highly conserved structure seems to have a substantial effect on the viral life cycle. The R2R comparisons summarized in these structure maps identify the types of sequence variability that can occur while maintaining the same spatial structure ( Figure 6A ) and demonstrates and identifies the variations in composition that can be tolerated even within a key functional motif. The R2R correspondence of other RdRps with birnaviruses in Motif C ( Figure 7A ), despite the sequence inversion in birnaviruses (CAB) supports the premise that conservation of structure is a significant, if not dominant, factor in evolution.",

The most highly conserved residue within the homomorph is a gly (PV G351) at the N-terminal edge of the motif and central to the homomorph; gly in this position would facilitate the folding of the homomorph, and is consistent with Cameron et al.'s (40) hypothesis that Motif D may be the most dynamic structural element of RdRps and RTs. Another conserved residue is a lys near the C-terminal edge (PV-K359). Residues equivalent to PV-K359 supply a proton to the nucleotidyl transfer reaction that increases the rate constant for nucleotide addition by 50-to 1000-fold (40) . In PV, within the motif, the insertion T353-t-M354 results in small plaques, likely due to delayed RNA synthesis (54) .

Motif E may also function in the proper positioning of the thumb relative to the palm (5) . The turn of the loop projects into the active site cavity where it has been implicated in helping to position the C-terminal end of the primer strand for attachment to the a-phosphate of the NTP during phosphoryl transfer (56) . Motif E in HCV plays a role in binding the priming nucleotide (not the incoming nucleotides) (38) ; HCV has a longer loop ( Figure 9A ), possibly related to this function. In PV, the C-terminal of hmE (R402) emerges from the protein into the segment 28-SAFHYVFEG-36.

We have demonstrated that the RNA polymerases have structural skeletons (frames) that are highly conserved, with flexible segments between them, and that extensive segments of structure similarity can be identified by the methods we have described.

It would be interesting to explore the possibility that interactions at the surface of the protein (e.g. protein-protein contact at surface homomorph residues) may subtly affect function buried deep beneath, within the tunnel. Furthermore, each homomorph is either divided by or is separated from another homomorph by a flexible secondary structure. Identification of the span of each homomorph and the terminal residue enables us to identify specific residues on the surface that would not, in many cases, be otherwise noticed. By comparing experimental data with the surface location of the ends of the homomorphs, we have found that these are often the sites of key functional interactions of the protein.

Mutations outside of the motif (but within the homomorph) are more often rate related and located in a segment that bulges from the homomorph by an amount that varies by species (Figures 2A, 3A and 4A ). These differences support the hypothesis that residues actively involved in template processing are essential to viability, and most of them are components of a consistent, stable structure that places and/or maintains them in their appropriate functional position. However, the practice of mutating residues to ala has resulted in a somewhat 'all or nothing' perspective of mutations. StralSV analysis can facilitate informed selection of alternative residues of various compositions, which could possibly affect replication rates to different extents. Experiments involving this type of testing would enhance predictive models and may provide new insights for the design and development of medical countermeasures.",

The homomorphs as defined in this work add structural clarity and context to sequencebased functional motifs previously observed by numerous authors performing comparative studies among polymerases. The structure maps created from the R2R correspondences identified by the StralSV algorithm provided a unique and informative perspective of structure and function in RdRps. They readily identify unique regions of each species and those shared by proteins within a family. These are features that would be useful for studies of any protein family. Based on the results of this study, it may be possible to define characteristic homomorphs for many other protein families, despite considerable sequence variation.

The identified structural associations may also facilitate the transfer of structure-related functional information among proteins.",

Under this premise, sequence-based evolutionary studies and phylogeny would inherently incorporate structure. In this study of RdRps, we demonstrated that structure accommodates substantial sequence variability, and that highly diverse sequences can generate highly similar tertiary structures. Structure-based phylogeny may provide new perspectives of protein evolution.",
