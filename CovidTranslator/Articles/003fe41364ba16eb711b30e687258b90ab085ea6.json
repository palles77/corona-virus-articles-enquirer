A subset of dendritic cells, plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs), is the body's major producer of type 1 IFNs. IFNs are important in host defense against viruses and there is overproduction of IFNs in SLE [8] . TLRs activate pDCs leading to the release of IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2. This in turn leads to the release of proinflammatory cytokines resulting in autoimmunity. IFN-\u03b1 results in the maturation of antigen presenting cells and augmented T-cell activation including excessive helper activity.

HIV infection causes a shift from a T helper (Th)1 to Th2-type cytokine profile, which is similar to those found in patients with SLE [44] [45] [46] . The nef and tat genes of HIV-1 are thought to mediate a Th1 to Th2 shift in cytokine production. CD4 + T-cell decline is mediated by an increased rate of apoptosis or programmed cell death. Th1 cytokines protect against apoptosis, whereas Th2 cells increase the rate of apoptosis. The shift of Th1 to Th2 cells causes the accelerated apoptosis in SLE patients. Anemia, leucopenia, thrombocytopenia, polymyositis and vasculitis can occur in both SLE and HIV patients. These observations suggest that there is a common mechanism mediating the increased apoptosis and autoantibody production in SLE and AIDS [44] [45] [46] . This may indicate that SLE is probably caused by a virus that has not yet been identified. In turn, SLE, which is thought to be mediated by CD4 + T cells, remits in some patients after infection with HIV-1 [1, 47] . The tat protein of HIV induces oxidative stress and increases surface expression of the Fas ligand, resulting in accelerated signaling through the Fas pathway ( Figure 3 ). In addition, cleavage of bcl-2 by HIV protease may expose the cell to a variety of apoptotic signals ( Figure 4 ) [1, 48] .",

HRES-1/Rab4 promoter activities and protein levels are increased in cells infected by HIV-1 or transfected by HIV-tat.

TNF-induced activation of macrophages and neutrophils controls parasite replication in the early stages of malaria, but when there is uncontrolled overproduction of this cytokine it leads to severe disease. As a consequence to reduced ability to generate TNF in low endemic areas for malaria there is a greater risk of developing autoimmune disease, such as SLE.
