The 180 or so delegates came from countries that covered nearly the entire globe. The papers, and the discussions following them, clearly reemphasized that, in spite of much progress in the past few decades, nosocomial infections remain a serious threat to human health worldwide. Indeed, many on-going changes in our societies, wide-spread drug resistance and immunosuppression, greater international trade in livestock and comestibles, faster and more frequent air travel as well as general reductions in health care funding have considerably enhanced the risk from nosocomial infections in our times. The information presented covered the highly relevant and topical issues of environmental surface disinfection, 1 hand hygiene, 2 -5 reprocessing of medical devices, 6-10 surveillance of nosocomial infections 11 and the role of viruses as nosocomial pathogens. 12 -14 French gave a balanced perspective on the dangers of newly discovered pathogens and our ability to successfully deal with them, as evidenced in the recent past; also, while complete elimination of hospital-acquired infections may never be attainable, we must continually apply our improving knowledge in medicine, biology and epidemiology to making hospitals safer.",

While this study makes a case for the use of sporicidal chemicals in the disinfection of hospital floors, we need further studies to determine the benefit: hazard ratio of the wide-spread use of sporicides, many of which can be unsafe. The contact time for sporicidal activity under ambient conditions would also require a substantial reduction to make routine application of sporicides on hospital floors practicable.",

Boyce and Pittet, the two coauthors of the CDC guideline, gave the scientific basis and global implications of its recommendations. This document has already had a substantial impact on the practices of hand hygiene in the U.S., particularly by catalyzing the acceptance of alcohol-based hand rubs in healthcare settings.",

Payan's 12 was a rare study where a cell culture system (HepG2) was used to assay the infectivity of human hepatitis B virus before and after its exposure to several types of disinfectants. Sattar 14 presented an overview on viruses and their mounting significance as nosocomial pathogens, with the SARS virus (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) and noroviruses as examples; it was also noted that there are major gaps in our knowledge on the exact mechanisms of spread of many types of viruses in hospital settings and prevention and control strategies to be applied. Rossell\u00f3-Urgell 11 described how recently introduced surveillance programs are generating useful information on the incidence of nosocomial infections in Spain. The design and application of these programs has been possible due to unprecedented collaboration between government agencies, scientific societies and the pharmaceutical industry. The Spanish expertise and experience are now ready to be applied in other European countries.",
