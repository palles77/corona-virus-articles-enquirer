            "text": "Feline calicivirus (FCV) is a common cause of upper respiratory tract disease in cats and is associated with interstitial pneumonia, oral ulceration and polyarthritis. Recently, outbreaks have involved a highly virulent FCV that leads to multisystemic signs. Virus isolation and conventional RT-PCR are the most common methods used for FCV diagnosis. However, real-time RT-PCR offers a rapid, sensitive, specific and easy tool for nucleic acid detection. The objective of this study was to design a TaqMan probe-based, real-time RT-PCR assay for detection of FCV. It was determined in our previous study that the first 120 nucleotides of the 5 0 region of the genome are highly conserved among FCV isolates. Primers and a probe specific for this region were designed for a real-time RT-PCR assay to detect FCV. Initial validation was done using 15 genetically diverse isolates. Also, 122 samples were tested by the new assay and virus isolation. The real-time RT-PCR assay was as sensitive and specific as virus isolation and was far more rapid. This real-time RT-PCR assay targeting the conserved 5 0 region of the genome is a fast, economical and accurate method for detection of FCV.",

However, existence of an asymptomatic carrier state is not uncommon, with up to 20-25% of apparently healthy cats shedding the virus [32, 33] . In addition to its isolation in domestic cats, FCV has been isolated from exotic felids, including captive cheetahs [25] . Antibodies specific for FCV have also been detected in free-ranging species including Namibian cheetahs [17] , free-ranging African lions and mountain lions [14, 20] , and Florida panthers [24] .",

            "text": "A member of the genus Vesivirus, family Caliciviridae, FCV is a non-enveloped virus with a 7.7-kb single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome [5] . Nucleotides 1-19 of the genome are untranslated, followed by three open reading frames (ORF): ORF1 (nucleotides 20-5,305) encodes a large polyprotein that includes the viral polymerase; ORF2 (nucleotides 5,314 to 7,317-7,326) encodes the major structural capsid protein VP1; and ORF3 (nucleotides 7,617-7,626 to 7,634-7,643) encodes the minor structural protein VP2, with an unknown function [3, 4, 10, 13, 19, 28] . The FCV genome has relatively high genetic variability; however, genetic analysis of a variety of isolates from a previous investigation has shown that the first 52 nucleotides in all known sequences are 100% conserved. Nucleotides 101-120 of the genome were also found to be highly conserved among FCV isolates [1, 10] . Virus isolation and conventional reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) are the most common methods used for FCV diagnosis [9, 29] . Real-time RT-PCR has been developed for FCV; however, previous attempts to develop real-time RT-PCR for FCV have used SYBR green instead of a specific hybridization probe [12, 26, 34] . One study employed a sequence-specific probe targeting a 67-bp product from ORF1 (nucleotides 2,466-2,532 from accession number M86379), but the sequence of the targeted probe was variable among the FCV isolates [11] .",

Tenfold serial dilutions of the FCV standard RNA produced a linear assay over six dilutions between 10 -4 to 10 -9 with a correlation coefficient of 0.996 (Fig. 2) . The linearity and co-efficiency indicate that the assay is reproducible and sensitive.

Differential diagnosis of these agents is necessary for appropriate treatment and control. Direct detection of the viral antigen by the immunofluorescence antibody technique (IFA), virus isolation, or molecular detection by conventional and nested PCR is used to detect FCV in diagnostic samples. However, antigen detection, while rapid and inexpensive, has relatively low sensitivity. Virus isolation is the gold standard but may require several days to 2 weeks for completion. Likewise, conventional and nested RT-PCR assays have demonstrated high sensitivity and specificity [16, 29] , but these procedures are considered more timeconsuming than the TaqMan real-time RT-PCR. Real-Time PCR has higher sensitivity than conventional PCR due to the use of a fluorescent-labeled probe for detection of amplification products and requires no postamplification evaluation of PCR products. Elimination of post-amplification evaluation of samples reduces the likelihood of laboratory and sample contamination. This technique also allows quantitation of the amount of virus in the sample, aiding interpretation. Most previous reports of real-time PCR for detection of FCV were limited to the use of SYBR green dye; however, using a specific molecular probe increases the specificity of the assay and provides opportunities for developing multiplex PCR for other feline respiratory tract pathogens [12, 26, 34] . Another assay utilized the hybridization probe, but the sequence of the targeted probe was variable among the FCV isolates [11] . IDEXX Laboratories, Westbrook, Maine, USA, offers a real-time probe-based assay, but no published data are available. The determination of the sensitivity and specificity of the previous assays was done primarily using viruses isolated in cell culture and a limited number of clinical samples.",

Identification of a conserved genetic region has been challenging due to limited sequence data of the complete genome of different FCV isolates as well as the high variability of the genetic regions that have been characterized. Previous investigations, including our analysis of six different isolates, have identified a conserved area in the 5 0 region of the FCV genome [1, 10] .
