Carbon nanoparticles in the form of nanostrings are acting as reporters. As carbon nanotags accumulate in the test zone due to formation of an antibody-antigen-carbon nanotag antibody complex, and this allows for the direct visualization of the analytical signal. Under optimal conditions, influenza A virus can be determined in allantoic fluid inoculated with the virus with a limit of detection of 350 TCID 50 .mL \u22121 (i.e., the 50% tissue culture infectious dose). No interference is found for several other tested proteins, and for closely related viruses. Cell lysates containing different seasonal strains of influenza A viruses (including the H1N1 and H3N2 strains) collected from clinical samples were analyzed. It is demonstrated that the method can detect both influenza A viruses without interference by biological matrices. In our perception, this method has a wide potential in that it may be extended to a generally applicable platform for rapid diagnosis influenza A viruses.",

Although influenza A virus can cause recurrent epidemics, there have also been occasional severe pandemics. These, for example, include the global outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H5N1) virus, the outbreak of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus in 2009 and the spread of influenza A(H7N9) virus in 2013 [1] [2] [3] . Serious outcomes of influenza infection and complications can be observed in certain group of patients, especially elderly and young children [4] . Therefore, rapid and accurate diagnosis is important to help planning of treatment regimen i.e. optimization of antiviral therapy, reduction of antibiotic use, and prevention of transmission [5] .",

To help aid clinical judgment and diagnosis of influenza, a number of different techniques has been developed. These techniques include viral culture, molecular assays, and rapid antigen diagnostic tests [6, 7] . Although viral culture and molecular assays allow the information regarding the identification of the outbreak strain and subtypes to be made, they are timeconsuming techniques and often require sophisticated and expensive equipment [8] . Unlike other approaches, result interpretation of rapid antigen diagnostic tests can be made within 15-20 min of specimen collection and does not require laboratory expertise.",

The majority of these tests are based upon the detection of target analyte on a given platform. These platforms; for example, include paper-based device, membrane-based assay, and lab-on-achip device [9, 10] . Such platforms provide advantages of simplicity, portability, inexpensiveness, and rapid analysis for analytical applications. Of these systems offering rapid testing analysis, the capillary-driven platform called Blateral flow immunochromatographic assay^ [11] . Within the system, the target analyte is captured between two specific recognition molecules such as antibodies, forming a sandwich complex [12] . In most cases, the test employs two specific antibodies, one of which is conjugated to the reporter molecule, whilst the other is immobilized on the solid support [13] . As the complex flows along the test device, it is separated from sample matrix via capillary force on the porous membrane [14] . Once captured, the target detection can be accomplished via an optical signal readout from the labeled sandwich complex, providing a direct colorimetric visualization.",

As the sample migrated through a porous membrane by capillary action, the antigen-carbon nanotag antibody complex was separated gradually from sample matrices by the mean of chromatography and continued to move along the test strip. Once the complex reached the nitrocellulose membrane, it was bound with the capture antibody immobilized on the membrane, forming a sandwich antibody-antigen-carbon nanotag antibody complex (Fig. 2a) .

Under optimized experimental conditions, the performance of the system was evaluated with different concentrations of the virus ranged from 0 to 2.8 \u00d7 10 3 TCID 50 .mL \u22121 (50% tissue culture infectious dose). As depicted in Fig. 3a , as the concentration of the target virus antigen was increased, the detection signal strength was shown to be higher. This suggests that the detection signal was increased gradually proportional to the number of the target influenza A virus present in the sample. The higher signal strength can be attributed to the increased number in the clusters of carbon nanotag labeled sandwich immunocomplex on the test spot area. With a direct signal visualization, a black spot detection signal can be observed visually at the concentration at 3.5 \u00d7 10 2 TCID 50 .mL \u22121 .

Firstly, it is worth mentioning the diagnosis using traditional viral culture method. As described previously, traditional culture method is not only time-consuming technique, but it also represents only a fraction of bacteria and virus in the community relying on the culture condition selected [29] . Therefore, point-of-care test is of importance for rapid screening and diagnosis of influenza virus infection. With the advancement in the field of nanotechnology, this has led to the development of several nanomaterial-based methods for the identification of influenza virus. Table 1 summarizes an overview on recently reported techniques including the system reported in this study.

Different approaches using nanoparticles to either concentrate the sample, enable the signal detection, or amplify the signal were also reported with various detectable level of target influenza protein and virus particle. These platforms; for example, include electrochemical sensor, integrated microfluidic system, and field-effect transistor system [31] [32] [33] . Other systems using similar immunoassay principle were also investigated. Whilst Zhang et al. reported europium nanoparticle-based immunoasssay for a detection of influenza virus with the limit of detection of 10 1 to 10 3 egg infective dose (EID) 50 .mL \u22121 , a paper-based immunoassay using gold nanoparticle to enable a detection of influenza virus with a range of 2.7 \u00d7 10 3 to 2.7 \u00d7 10 4 plaque-forming unit per assay was described [34, 35] . It should also be noted that the antibody specific to influenza virus used in this system is different to those of other systems. In this system, the antibody chosen as a targeting ligand is specific to the nucleoprotein, rather than other proteins such as hemagglutinin and neuraminidase, which are more susceptible to antigenic change. Nucleoprotein is recognized as one of the most abundant proteins in the virion and is less sensitive to antigenic drift.

Therefore, with respect to these approaches, lateral flow immunoassay platform, designed as rapid point-of-care diagnostic test, can provide significant advantages by allowing a direct, simple, but sensitive determination of influenza virus. With regards to the previous lateral flow immunoassay systems reported for the detection of influenza virus, dual-layered and double-targeted gold nanoparticles and fluorescent dye-doped silica nanoparticles were used as reporters [16, 19] . However, it should be noted that the strategies of using either different size of gold nanoparticles in combination with combined antigen detection method or fluorescence based method are more complicated strategies, compared to the single-label direct visualization system.

Carbon nanoparticle have been recognized as a versatile label for a rapid diagnostic assay. The use of carbon nanoparticles as reporters in lateral flow assay system can provide a better sensitivity, compared to the use of either gold nanoparticles or latex beads. Among different nanomaterials used as reporters in lateral flow assay system, it was reported that carbon nanoparticles are the cheapest one and their suspensions are very stable and easy to prepare. [26] . With these unique properties of carbon nanomaterials such as good stability, high contrast, and inexpensive, we have demonstrated that the carbon nanotag based lateral flow assay can be successfully fabricated for a rapid and direct visual determination of influenza virus with a limit of detection comparable to other existed techniques and systems. A final point that merits a further discussion is how the system can potentially applied to the relevant clinical application. In order to evaluate the potential of the system, it is important to assess the performance of the system for the detection of influenza A virus in related biological sample matrix i.e. in the cell lysate format. To this regard, MDCK cell cultures infected with either seasonal influenza A(H1N1) 14/ 2004 strain or seasonal influenza A(H3N2) 04/2004 strain were used as a sample, with uninfected cells were used a negative control. It was shown that when influenza A infected cell cultures were used as a sample, a distinct black color test spot was observed with a high averaged normalized signal intensity value (29,338 \u00b1 353 and 32,671 \u00b1 304 a.u., respectively) (Fig. 4) . Oppositely, when uninfected cells were applied to the system, no test spot signal was detected, with a relatively low averaged normalized signal intensity value. These results demonstrate that the system have the potential to detect the virus in biological matrices, with no cross reactivity to other tested proteins.",

With the combination of carbon nanoparticles, in the form of nanostrings, as reporters, visual detection of influenza A virus was demonstrated. Rapid detection of the target virus was achieved through a direct color visualization of the signal at the test area. Under optimal conditions, the system is capable of detecting influenza A virus in the influenza A-inoculated allantoic fluid, with no cross reactivity to other tested proteins. In addition, successful detection of the clinical strains of the influenza A virus in the cell lysate format without interference from biological matrices was also demonstrated. Compared to the traditional culture method, molecular approaches, and other nanomaterial-based methods, carbon nanotag based lateral flow assay provides a rapid and direct approach for the detection of influenza A virus. In conclusion, this work has demonstrated the potential application of such detection platform to detect influenza A virus in complex biological matrices, including allantoic fluid and the cell-associated format, which can be extended for the future development of rapid tests in clinical application.",
