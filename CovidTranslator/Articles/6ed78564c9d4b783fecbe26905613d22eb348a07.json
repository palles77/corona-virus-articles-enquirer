We developed a novel electrofusion protocol for efficiently fusing Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-transformed human B cells with myeloma partners. We tested seven myeloma cell lines and achieved highest efficiency when the HMMA 2.5 line was used. We optimized the electrofusion process by improving cell treatments before and after electrofusion as well as varying cell ratios, fusion medium and other experimental parameters. Our fusion efficiency increased remarkably to 0.43%, a significant improvement over the efficiency of previous PEG-based or other electrofusion methods. Using the optimized protocol, we obtained human hybridomas that secrete fully human monoclonal antibodies against two major human respiratory pathogens: respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and an influenza H3N2 vaccine virus strain. In conclusion, we have developed an efficient and routine approach for the generation of human hybridomas secreting functional human virus-specific monoclonal antibodies.",

The creation of human hybridoma cell lines that produced immunoglobulins by fusing human B cells with mouse myeloma cells was first reported in 1973 (Schwaber and Cohen, 1973) . A year later, human-human hybridomas were described (Bloom and Nakamura, 1974) . The first success in generating human mAbs with predefined specificity was reported in 1980 (Olsson and Kaplan, 1980) . Olsson and Kaplan successfully fused human spleen cells from patients with Hodgkin's disease with human myeloma cells. Despite a significant number of human mAbs that have been described, current methods for isolation of fully human mAbs are inefficient, yielding unpredictable results. The development of a reliable and routine method for generating human mAbs faces a number of obstacles, such as the low immunoglobulin (Ig) production capability of most fusions and the rapid loss of Ig production and chromosomal instability of most human hybridomas.",

            "text": "Collection of antigen-specific B cells is the first important step of human hybridoma generation. Antigen-specific cells are generally rare in the peripheral blood. The fusion efficiency of current methods for hybridoma generation is not sufficient to immortalize rare cells from the numbers of cells that can be obtained by routine phlebotomy. Stevens reported that the frequency of B cells producing anti-tetanus IgG antibody in the circulation was only 1 \u00d7 10 -4 at a time point two to four weeks after the booster injection (Stevens et al., 1979) . Such a low frequency, combined with the fact that B cells usually represent less than 10% of the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), and the low fusion efficiency of current fusion methods (on the order of 10 -5 to 10 -6 ) suggest that the chance of obtaining an antigen-specific human hybridoma is only on the order of 10 -9 to 10 -10 . Consequently, the generation of human hybridoma cells secreting desirable human mAbs has proven difficult. Although human B cells can be immortalized by EBV transformation (Casali et al., 1986; Kozbor and Roder, 1981) , conventional EBV-transformed immortalization is restricted to the CD21 + subset of B cells, and the resultant mAbs are predominantly of the IgM isotype. Moreover, EBV-transformed B cells generally grow poorly, they usually secrete low amounts of antibodies, and they are also difficult to clone because they exhibit chromosomal instability (Casali et al., 1986; Crawford and Ando, 1986; Roder et al., 1986; Steinitz et al., 1978) . Recent studies suggest the addition of CpG during transformation can facilitate more efficient transformation (Bernasconi et al., 2002; Hartmann and Krieg, 2000; Traggiai et al., 2004) .",

            "text": "The limited number of suitable fusion partners has hindered development of human mAbs by hybridoma technology. The mouse myelomas originally used for hybridoma work were not suitable for deriving human mAbs from human B cells because heterospecific hybrids often quickly reject the relevant human chromosomes. Investigators recently have isolated or generated new myeloma lines that are of interest for human hybridoma work. One new murine fusion partner cell line was transformed to co-express genes that encode murine interleukin-6 (mIL-6) and human telomerase catalytic subunit (hTERT) (Dessain et al., 2004) . Murine IL-6 directly stimulates immunoglobulin production and the proliferation of the hybridoma. Human TERT can lengthen telomeres through the synthesis of the telomeric hexamer repeat sequence, thereby providing cells with unlimited replication capability and promoting karyotypic stability. Human myeloma cell lines also have been used for fusion, such as U266 (Olsson and Kaplan, 1980, 1983) , U266-derived SKO-007 (Brodin et al., 1983; Cote et al., 1983; Olsson, 1983 ) and a recently isolated fully human myeloma designated Karpas 707H (Karpas et al., 2001) . Finally, another class of fusion partner, heterohybridoma, has been constructed by the fusion of murine myeloma cells with human cells, for example the K6H6/B5 , KR12 , HMMA 2.5 (Posner et al., 1987) , and MFP-2 Kirman et al., 2002) cell lines. Although each of these lines can yield viable fusions, a highly efficient fusion protocol has not been described for any.",

We tested the sensitivity of EBV-transformed human B cells to differing concentrations of ouabain and found the minimum concentration for killing EBV-transformed human B cells to be 0.5 \u03bcM. More than 99% of EBV-transformed B cells were killed during seven days of culture in medium containing 0.5 \u03bcM ouabain (Fig. 1) .

Approximately 50% of MFP-2 cells and Karpas 707H cells survived after seven days of selection (Fig. 2) .

MFP-2 cells exhibited higher fusion efficiency for PBMCs in both PEG-mediated fusion and electrofusion (Table 4 ).

Culture conditions and gamma irradiation procedures for the EL4B5 and CD154-expressing cells were described previously. Electrofusion was performed using HMMA 2.5 partner cells and EBV-transformed human B cells, and fusions were plated into three types of 96-well culture plates: 1) without feeder cells, 2) with 50,000 cells per well irradiated EL4B5 cells, or 3) with 10,000 cells per well irradiated CD154expressing fibroblasts. We determined the effect of feeder cells on the growth of human hybridoma cells by determining the number of colonies formed from fusions when equal portions of the fusion reaction were cultured under the three conditions. The results showed that feeder cells did not increase the number of hybridomas generated by treatment with single or multiple electrofusion pulses (Fig. 5) .",

Conventional treatment used PBS washes. In the optimized treatment, transformed B cells and partner cells were washed separately with fresh medium, followed by three washes with fusion medium to completely remove proteins and other medium additives that can alter the conductive properties of the fusion medium. After fusion, we added a recovery incubation period of 30 minutes for cells in the fusion chamber at 37 \u00b0C in 5% CO 2 before collecting and plating in multi-well plates. With the modified pre-and post-fusion cell treatment, the overall fusion efficiency increased about three-fold from 0.15 to 0.43%. We again compared the fusion efficiency of this electrofusion protocol to that of PEG-mediated fusion using the same batch of EBV-transformed human B cells and HMMA 2.5 cells. Hybridoma production using the optimized electrofusion protocol coupled with optimized cell treatment was more than threefold increased over conventional PEG fusion (Fig. 6) .

Electroporation is more efficient for large myeloma cells than for smaller B cells at the same electrical parameters.

We then performed a series of additional experiments with differing cell ratios between myeloma cells and transformed human B cells.

Electrofusion has a number of theoretical advantages over PEG-mediated fusion. The efficiency of electrofusion is considerably higher than that of PEG fusion. PEG fusion has an average fusion efficiency of 5 \u00d7 10 -6 , whereas previous methods of electrofusion achieved efficiencies up to 4 \u00d7 10 -4 (Foung and Perkins, 1989; Glassy, 1988; Ohnishi et al., 1987; Schmitt et al., 1989; Steenbakkers et al., 1993; Vienken and Zimmermann, 1985; Zimmermann and Vienken, 1982) . Theoretically, electrofusion can be applied to induce hybrid formation between any two cells. However, the success of electrofusion depends on the nature of the fusion partner and the type and state of activation of B cells. Each electrofusion parameter needs to be optimized with the particular cells being used. There is a high degree of heterogeneity between different fusion partner cells, or even between subpopulations within a particular cell population. The growth conditions such as the concentration of CO 2 , growth medium composition, and the state of B cell activation can affect hybridoma formation efficiency (Zimmermann et al., 1990) . Historically, electrofusion-mediated efficiencies of myelomas with human B cells have been quite low, for example, the fusion efficiency of the HMMA 2.5 precursor HMMA2.11TG/0 of 1/17,000 was previously described (Posner et al., 1987) . In this study, we optimized the conditions for hybridoma production in an iterative fashion, increasing the fusion efficiency to 0.43%. This efficiency is quite high, and proved effective in generating human mAbs to human respiratory tract pathogens, even from subjects not recently infected or immunized. The optimized protocol offers an effective approach for generation of desirable full-length human mAbs.",

HMMA 2.5 cells were fused with EBV-transformed human B cells using previously determined optimal electrofusion parameters to test the effect of optimized cell treatment conditions before and after electrofusion, as detailed description in the results section. Electrofusion also was compared with PEG fusion. The cell ratio in the PEG fusion was 1:3 (partner cells : transformed B cells) and 2:1 in electrofusion.

Fusions were dispersed into 96-well plates. The fusion efficiency on a percentage basis was calculated as the total number of hybridoma colonies in each well, divided by the number of input B cells, and multiplied by 100. A total of 192 wells was assessed for each condition.b Wells were scored positive if one or more hybridoma clones grew in the well. Each well was inoculated with an aliquot of the fusion suspension that contained approximately 6000 EBV-transformed B cells and 12,000 myeloma cells prior to fusion.",
