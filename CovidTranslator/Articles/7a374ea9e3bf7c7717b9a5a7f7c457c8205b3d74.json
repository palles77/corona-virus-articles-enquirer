For other viral pathogens, classic approaches to vaccine development have, thus far, been unsuccessful. Viruslike particles (VLPs) are increasingly being considered as vaccine candidates because they offer significant advantages over many currently used vaccines or developing vaccine technologies. VLPs formed with structural proteins of Newcastle disease virus, an avian paramyxovirus, are a potential vaccine candidate for Newcastle disease in poultry. More importantly, these VLPs are a novel, uniquely versatile VLP platform for the rapid construction of effective vaccine candidates for many human pathogens, including genetically complex viruses and viruses for which no vaccines currently exist.",

Replicon vaccines are defective genomes into which a foreign gene is introduced (e.g., [14, 15] ). While capable of only a single cycle of infection, defective genomes may replicate or persist for extended periods in the infected cell, increasing the risk of recombination between the replicon and an endemic virus to generate a virulent virus [16] .",

VLPs are formed by the assembly of viral structural proteins and lipids into particles, but without the incorporation of the viral genome. Thus, VLPs are incapable of a spreading infection typical of an infectious virus, eliminating danger of disease in immunocompromised individuals. There is no chance of reversion to virulence or recombination with endemic viruses, since no genome is present. The production of VLPs is not hazardous, since no live virus is involved in their preparation. Importantly, VLPs are potent immunogens, since they are particles similar in size to viruses and contain repeating protein arrays on their surfaces and in their cores that mimic those of infectious viruses [17] . Such structures account, in part, to the potent immunogenicity of viruses [17] . Furthermore, since the assembly of particles, such as the assembly of viruses, requires correct folding of proteins, VLPs likely contain many authentic antigenic sites. Since no inactivation of VLPs is required, important epitopes are retained and new ones are probably not generated. Importantly, in contrast to many virus vaccines, VLPs may be formed without viral proteins that downregulate host immune responses [19] .",

More recent examples of these studies include characterization of Ebola virus VLPs [20] , seasonal and pandemic influenza VLPs [21] [22] [23] [24] , Chikungunya virus VLPs [25] , HIV VLPs [18, 26] and HCV VLPs [27] . As summarized in many excellent reviews (e.g., [8, 17, 18, 26, 28, 29] ), most well-characterized VLPs are potent stimulators of immune responses. Surface proteins usually stimulate neutralizing antibody. Owing to their particulate nature, VLPs are taken up and processed for presentation by both MHC class I and class II pathways, resulting in a broad range of T-cell responses. Of key importance, VLPs are described as 'selfadjuvanting' [28, 29] . No adjuvant is required for immune responses in most systems. All these responses usually translate into vaccine candidates that provide impressive and safe protection of experimental animals from challenge by live, virulent viruses.",

To extend the use of established, wellcharacterized VLPs as vaccines for other viruses, several approaches have been reported. The passive incorporation of glycoproteins into VLPs formed with retrovirus gag proteins has been reported (reviewed in [26] and illustrated in [30, 31] ). Immunodominant molecules can be chemically crosslinked to the surfaces of VLPs [17] . Finally, key neutralizing antibody or T-cell epitopes of a target virus have been genetically fused to a structural protein of a well-characterized VLP. There are many variations on this last approach (more recent examples include [17, 26, 28, [32] [33] [34] ), but most of these chimera VLPs have been reported for retrovirus gag, the HBcAg or the HBsAg VLPs. The efficacy of these chimera VLPs in protection from the targeted pathogen has been less extensively characterized.",

Indeed, as depicted in Figure 1B , cells expressing the Newcastle disease virus HN, F, NP and M proteins release particles that structurally and functionally resemble virus particles [44, 45] . What distinguishes Newcastle disease VLPs from other paramyxovirus VLPs and, indeed, from many other types of VLPs, is their striking efficiency of release [45] . The reported efficiency of release of other paramyxovirus VLPs, as measured by the efficiency of M protein released, ranged from 10 to 50% [32, [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] , while Newcastle disease VLP release is 84% [44, 45] . As a result, quantitative amounts of Newcastle disease VLPs are relatively easy to prepare even from transiently transfected cells [46] . They can be purified using protocols utilized for virus purification and the purified VLPs have minimal cell protein contamination ( Figure 2 ) [44, 46] . Furthermore, the ratios of viral proteins were similar to those in virus particles ( Figure 2 ) [44] .",

The Newcastle disease virus glycoproteins are assembled into VLPs owing to specific interactions of the glycoprotein cytoplasmic (CT) and transmembrane (TM) domains with Newcastle disease virus core proteins, while the ectodomain has little influence on assembly [Morrison TG et al., Unpublished Data] [46] . Thus, specific incorporation of a foreign glycoprotein ectodomain into Newcastle disease VLPs can be achieved by constructing a chimera protein gene composed of sequences encoding the foreign protein ectodomain fused to those encoding the TM and CT domains of the appropriate Newcastle disease virus glycoprotein ( Figure 3A ). Both type 1 and type 2 glycoproteins can be assembled into these particles in this way, owing to the properties of the Newcastle disease virus glycoproteins. The F protein is a type 1 glycoprotein and the HN protein is a type 2 glycoprotein. Thus, foreign type 1 glycoprotein ectodomains can be fused to the TM and CT domains of the F protein while type 2 glycoprotein ectodomains can be fused to the CT and TM domains of the HN protein ( Figure 3A ). Specific assembly of the entire ectodomain of a protein rather than short peptides or domains more likely results in a properly folded protein with authentic post-translational modifications, conformational epitopes and T-cell epitopes, including those not yet identified.",

The next step in the translation of these positive preclinical results into vaccine trials and into licensure as human and agricultural vaccines requires that VLPs be produced in a cost-effective manner, on a large scale, and under good manufacturing processes. This step is the next major challenge for continued development of VLPs as vaccines, particularly enveloped VLPs (reviewed in [51] ), such as Newcastle disease VLPs. However, VLPs formed with influenza proteins and with Ebola virus proteins can be produced from insect cells using baculovirus vectors (e.g., [20, 22, 24] ), a system that should be easily adaptable to large-scale production for many VLPs. Issues surrounding VLP production from baculovirus vector-infected insect cells involve the altered carbohydrate modification of glycoproteins synthesized in insect cells (discussed in [52] ) and contaminating baculoviruses in the VLP preparations (discussed in [28, 53] ). However, influenza VLPs formed in this way are in clinical trials (NCT01072799, NCT01014806, NCT00903552 and NCT00519389) [102, 103] . Alternatively, systems utilizing tissue culture cells approved for use in vaccine production could also be adapted for production of VLPs. Cell lines derived from these approved cells expressing VLP proteins may be produced. Alternatively, large-scale transient transfections are being explored. Purification of VLPs from mammalian cells would eliminate any issues with immunogenicity associated with the altered post-translational modifications of proteins produced in insect cells and would eliminate concerns about the presence of baculoviruses in the vaccine preparations.",

However, many of the VLP vaccine candidates that have been tested in human trials do stimulate robust immune responses, indicating that this approach to vaccine development has great potential. Furthermore, characterization of immune responses to VLPs, including chimera Newcastle disease VLPs, in newly developed humanized mouse models may facilitate the path of VLP vaccine candidates to clinical trials. These systems have the potential to assess more directly human immune responses [55] [56] [57] during preclinical development of VLP vaccine candidates.",

[45] and McGinnes et al. [44] . Proteins in the purified VLPs, separated by electrophoresis on polyacrylamide gels and detected by silver stain, are compared with proteins in equivalent amounts of purified, avirulent vaccine virus grown in embryonated chicken eggs. Proteins shown in lanes 1 and 2 were separated on polyacrylamide gels in the absence of reducing agent (\u2212\u03b2ME) in order to resolve the disulfide linked F VLPs containing the H/G chimera protein and the Newcastle disease virus nucleocapsid protein and membrane protein were used as an immunogen in BALB/c mice as previously described [46] . VLPs (30 \u00b5g total VLP protein/animal) were delivered by intraperitoneal inoculation. Similar results were obtained using intramuscular immunization [46] . In parallel, groups of mice received no immunization, or were infected with live RSV (3 \u00d7 10 6 PFU/animal) delivered by intranasal immunization. Mice were challenged with infectious RSV (3 \u00d7 10 6 PFU/animal) and virus titers in lungs were measured at 4 days postchallenge. Results show virus titers/g of lung tissue for each mouse in each group. RSV: Respiratory syncytial virus; VLP: Virus-like particle.

The viral membrane (lipid) contains two glycoproteins, an attachment protein and a F protein, and a nonglycosylated M protein. The attachment protein of Newcastle disease virus, an avian paramyxovirus, is the HN protein. The core of the virus contains the genomic RNA and associated nucleocapsid protein in a helical RNP complex, which also contains the L viral polymerase and a P protein. (B) Generation of ND VLPs, which are very efficiently released from cells expressing the viral NP, M, HN and F proteins after a transient transfection of cells with pCAGGS vectors [58,59] containing cDNAs encoding each of these viral proteins. These cDNAs were derived from the Australia-Victoria strain of Newcastle disease virus. The cleavage site of the F protein was mutated to mimic the site in the F protein from the vaccine strain of Newcastle disease virus, resulting in an uncleaved F protein. Cells may be mammalian (COS7 or 293T) or avian cells (ELL-0), although avian cells release Newcastle disease VLPs more efficiently. In avian cells, 84% of total expressed M protein is released as particles [45].

For type 1 glycoproteins, the ectodomain of the NDV F protein is substituted with the ectodomain of a foreign glycoprotein X. For type 2 glycoproteins, the ectodomain of the NDV HN protein is substituted with that of a foreign glycoprotein Y. (B) Demonstrates the assembly into Newcastle disease VLPs of a type 2 chimera glycoprotein, a chimera protein containing the ectodomain of the RSV G protein and the CT and TM domains of the HN protein (H/G). Cells were transfected with cDNAs encoding the NDV NP and M protein, as well as cDNA encoding the chimera protein H/G. While M protein is both necessary and sufficient for Newcastle disease VLP release, inclusion of NP significantly enhances incorporation of glycoproteins into particles, particularly when only a single glycoprotein is expressed, as described in Pantua et al.[45].Proteins in purified VLPs, separated by electrophoresis on polyacrylamide gels and detected by silver stain (lane 2), were compared with proteins in purified virions (equivalent amounts of protein were loaded onto lanes 1 and 2; NDV, lane 1). Lane 3 shows material released from equivalent numbers of cells transfected with an empty vector. Lanes 4 and 5 show a WB of VLP-H/G (lane 5) and virus (lane 4) proteins using anti-RSV antibody to detect the RSV G protein sequences in the VLPs. The H/G protein, as well as the RSV G protein (not shown), migrates with heterogeneous sizes most likely due to inefficient glycosylation [46]. (C) Illustrates the incorporation of a type 1 chimera glycoprotein into Newcastle disease VLPs. A chimera protein containing the ectodomain of the cytomegalovirus gB protein and the TM and CT domains of the NDV F protein (gB/F) was coexpressed with the NDV NP and M proteins (lane 3) or coexpressed with NDV NP, M, and H/G chimera protein (lane 4). VLPs containing the NDV HN, F, NP and M proteins are shown in lane 2, while particles released from empty vector DNAs are shown in lane 1. Panels show WBs of the proteins in purified VLPs. All lanes contained an amount of VLPs released, in the same experiment, from equivalent numbers of transfected cells. Efficiency of release of the different VLPs was similar to that demonstrated by similar levels of NDV NP in each preparation. Anti-CMV antibodies detect the gB sequences. Anti-NDV F CT is an antibody raised against the CT domain of the NDV F protein and demonstrates the presence of the NDV F protein CT domain sequences in the VLPs. Anti-NDV detects the NP protein in the VLPs and anti-RSV detects the RSV G protein sequences in the VLPs.
