In 2012, researchers in Hong Kong conducted a regional surveillance study on a variety of domestic and wild animal species for coronaviruses from 2007 through 2011 and identified coronaviruses in birds and mammals that formed a new genus subsequently named Deltacoronavirus (Woo et al., 2012; King et al., 2012) . According to that study, porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) has been present in pigs in Hong Kong since 2009. PDCoV is a single stranded, positive sense, enveloped RNA virus with a genome size varying between 25.4 and 26.6 Kb (Woo et al., 2012; Li et al., 2014) .",

In early February 2014, PDCoV was detected and announced in the US by the Ohio Department of Agriculture. Soon thereafter, genome sequencing and analysis of the PDCoV strains present in the US revealed approximately 99% nucleotide similarity of these newly emerged strains to the porcine deltacoronavirus HKU15-44 and HKU15-155 from China (Wang et al., 2014; Li et al., 2014; Marthaler et al., 2014) . It was unknown when PDCoV might have been introduced into the US considering an additional coronavirus (PEDV) had recently been detected in US swine in less than one year of detecting PDCoV (Stevenson et al., 2013) . However, from the present study and with available samples submitted to the ISU VDL at the present time, it can be inferred that PDCoV has been present in US swine at least since August 2013, suggesting that the PDCoV introduction may have been independent of PEDV introduction into the US. Although the origin of PDCoV remains unknown at this time, detection of the deltacoronavirus after PEDV may suggest the potential of additional trans-boundary or foreign animal diseases to enter the US in the future.",

The viral RNA was eluted into 90 ml of elution buffer. Viral RNA was extracted from the FFPE intestinal samples using the MagMAX TM FFPE Total nucleic acid isolation kit (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) and a Kingfisher 96 instrument (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA) using manufacturer's recommendations. Viral RNA was eluted into 70 ml of elution buffer.
