Approximately 85% of the patients with KD are under 5 years of age. 2, 3 The occurrence of KD is rare in adolescents and adults. 4 The specific cause of KD is still unclear, but some reports suggest that it is triggered by bacterial or viral infections.

On the day of admission, he was treated with 2,700 mg/day of oral aspirin (30 mg/kg/day). On day 4, the dose of aspirin was reduced to 450 mg/day (5 mg/kg/day) because of defervescence; however, on day 5, the patient developed liver dysfunction as an adverse effect of aspirin. After day 6 in our hospital, the myalgia, congested conjunctivae, erythema, and desquamations were found to be gradually resolving. By day 13, the erythema and desquamation were completely resolved. However, the treatment was switched from aspirin to 200 mg/day of cilostazol because the alanine aminotransferase levels increased to 150 U/L ( Figure 2 ). Subsequently, the liver function normalized, and the patient was discharged on the 13th hospital day. During hospitalization, transthoracic echocardiography disclosed no coronary aneurysms. At follow-up, coronary computed tomography performed 2 months after the onset of the disease revealed no coronary aneurysms ( Figure 3 ).",

Patients with fewer than four of these clinical signs can be diagnosed as having atypical KD if coronary artery abnormalities are present. 8 Additionally, it is necessary to exclude the possibility of other diseases that cause fever and rash (eg, toxic shock syndrome, streptococcal scarlet fever, measles, other viral infections, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, or a drug reaction). Desquamation is typically found during the convalescent phase. However, in patients who develop KD in adulthood, the time of onset of desquamation is varied. Some of these patients have been reported to develop desquamation during the acute phase of KD with fever. 9, 10 This may be associated with the fact that multiple factors cause KD and that the mechanism of KD differs between adults and children. In our patient, desquamation appeared relatively early and then improved. Although the side effects of cefcapene-pivoxil and loxoprofen should be considered in the differential diagnosis, both drugs were used without adverse effects in this patient before this episode.

            "text": "The etiology of KD remains unclear, although the clinical features suggest that a viral or bacterial infection may be a trigger. 11 KD has features similar to those of other childhood infectious diseases. For example, similar to measles and adenovirus infection, KD has the clinical features of fever and rash. The epidemiological features including age distribution, seasonal prevalence, and occurrence of community outbreaks with geographical spread also suggest a transmissible childhood disease. 12 However, an infectious agent has not yet been identified. Adenovirus, herpesvirus, Epstein-Barr virus, human coronavirus New Haven, measles virus, rotavirus, dengue virus, and retrovirus are putative etiological agents of KD. These are commonly found pathogens. 13 However, the reason why only some patients infected with these viruses develop KD is unknown. A report demonstrated coinfection with Coxsackievirus B3 in a patient with KD. 13 ",

            "text": "It is important not only to manage symptoms in the acute phase of KD but also to prevent the cardiovascular after-effects. There are three essential treatments for KD: 1) intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) to obtain an anti-inflammatory effect, 2) aspirin for anti-inflammatory and antiplatelet effects, and 3) management of any complications (eg, meningitis or disseminated intravascular coagulation). IVIG can mitigate inflammation and the coronary artery complications. A dose of 2 g/kg of IVIG in a single infusion has been found to be effective. This therapy should be initiated within the first 10 days of illness. 14,15 IVIG has not been demonstrated to be effective if administered after the first 10 days of illness. Furthermore, one report has noted a risk of unfavorable effects with IVIG regarding cardiac sequelae if IVIG is started on day 9 or later. 16 In our patient, IVIG was not administered because he was admitted to our hospital on the 13th day of illness. Aspirin is often administered with IVIG in patients with KD. In the acute phase, the American Heart Association recommends high-dose aspirin (80-100 mg/kg/day) to achieve an anti-inflammatory effect. 14 However, it is not clear if a higher dose would be more effective than the lower dose (30-50 mg/ kg/day). 17 When the patient remains afebrile for 48-72 hours, the aspirin dose is lowered (3-5 mg/kg/day) and maintained to achieve an antiplatelet effect until the patient shows no evidence of coronary changes for 6-8 weeks after onset. 14 In addition, regular echocardiographic evaluation should be performed to assess for the possibility of coronary artery aneurysm.",
