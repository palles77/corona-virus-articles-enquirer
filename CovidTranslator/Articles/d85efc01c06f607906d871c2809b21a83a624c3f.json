The nitrogen-containing units of these molecules play important roles for their bioactivities. For the synthesis of these nitrogencontaining building blocks, the use of imines is the most promising and convenient route. 1 In recent times, multicomponent reactions (MCRs) have been considered as a superior synthetic strategy. 2 MCRs are usually highly efficient and atom economic. Compared with the conventional organic reactions, MCRs are advantageous in being highly convergent and in requiring minimum time and effort to achieve structural complexity. Thus, MCRs are accepted as green chemical processes. Over the years, hundreds of MCRs are known in the literature. These reactions can be classified in different ways, e.g., according to the reaction mechanisms, the components involved or their intrinsic variability. 2 Isocyanide-based multicomponent reactions, introduced in 1921 by Passerini, 3 followed by Ugi and others, are the most explored and well studied. 4 Currently, various non-isocyanidebased multicomponent reactions 5 are being developed for the synthesis of arrays of compounds of potential applications in drug discovery, and material science. These include imine-based MCRs (involving imines as a substrate or an intermediate), which have gained considerable attention in recent years. This sudden rise in the popularity of imine-based MCRs may be considered to be due to two factors: (i) substrate-dependent reactivity of imines, and (ii) commercial availability of several hundred amines and aldehydes to access a large number of imines, which can lead to diverse molecular scaffolds. Therefore, imines are considered as versatile building block in MCRs for diversity-oriented synthesis.",

This is generally achieved either by using a DeaneStark apparatus or by adding drying agents such as anhydrous Na 2 SO 4.

Although imines are involved in IMCRs, we will not incorporate the literature or chemistry of IMCRs in this report, since several review articles are available in the literature on this topic. Relatively few review articles on non-IMCRs are known in the literature and, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first on multicomponent reactions in which the chemistry of imines is exclusively described. The objective of this review is to highlight the potential of imines as important synthetic intermediates in MCRs and to discuss the various reactivity patterns, rather than giving a comprehensive data base of imine-based MCRs.",

            "text": "The C]N and C]O double bonds are apparently very similar and therefore the chemical behaviour of imines is comparable to that of the carbonyl compounds, i.e., imines are the nitrogen equivalents of carbonyls. When a nucleophile attacks a carbonyl system, very little energy is required to distort the polarised pbond, since the oxygen atom is more electronegative. Similarly, if a nucleophilic attack takes place at the carbon centre of an imine, an intermediate would be generated possessing a negative charge on the nitrogen, which is not favourable. Therefore, imines are less electrophilic than aldehydes and ketones. They can, however, be activated by treatment with a catalytic amount of an acid. The iminium cation, generated by protonation of the imine nitrogen, is a highly reactive electrophile, since attack upon this positively charged intermediate generates a neutral species 9 (Scheme 3). Imines act as electrophiles in a majority of the MCRs. Among these reactions, the Mannich reaction is one of the most widely used three-component reactions of a non-enolisable aldehyde, a primary or secondary amine, and an enolisable carbonyl compound to afford the corresponding b-amino carbonyl compounds, which are important synthetic intermediates for various pharmaceuticals and natural products 14 and have found wide application in organic synthesis. The classical Mannich reaction has some limitations, however, such as harsh reaction conditions and long reaction times. In addition, indirect-type 15 Mannich reactions using preformed electrophiles, such as imines and stable nucleophiles, such as enolates or enol ethers suffer from the drawback of the necessity for the isolation and purification of the preformed intermediates. Therefore, a modified and improved methodology, known as the direct-type Mannich reaction, in the presence of various catalysts and using carbonyl compounds directly as nucleophiles was introduced. In the literature, several methodologies have been reported for the direct-type Mannich reactions. 16 Protic acids as well as Lewis acids are found to be suitable for the catalytic activation of these reactions. As an example, Khan et al. 17 have reported a bromodimethylsulfonium bromide (BDMS)-catalysed efficient protocol for the synthesis of b-amino carbonyl compounds 10 (Scheme 4). It is believed that the HBr generated in situ from the BDMS and water activates the electrophilicity of the imine and also helps in the formation of the enol of aromatic ketones. The Mannich-type reaction is not only suitable for accessing bamino carbonyls, but is also an efficient tool for the synthesis of various heterocycles. As an example, Liang et al. 18 have reported that, when the aldehyde is formaldehyde and the ketone is cyclohexanone, these components react with aniline in the presence of (S)-proline as an organocatalyst to provide 1,3-diaryl-5spirohexahydropyrimidines 12 (Scheme 5). Conventionally, the reaction of cyclohexanone with the in situ imine gives the corresponding b-amino ketones. This proline-catalysed protocol is very interesting, as, in this one pot, multicomponent reaction, six molecules of reactants are involved and six new covalent bonds are generated. Mechanistically, the cyclohexanone undergoes two a-aminomethylation reactions consecutively on the same a-carbon of the carbonyl in the presence of a catalytic amount of proline. The condensation of the resulting substituted propane-1,3-diamine 11 with formaldehyde furnishes the desired spirohexahydropyrimidine 12.",

The NR 1 R 2 -substituted propargylic pyridine intermediate 26 is first formed by a gold-catalysed three-component coupling of pyridine-2-carboxaldehyde, amine, and alkyne via a Man-nicheGrignard reaction. Coordination of the triple bond in the alkyne 26 to the gold catalyst enhances the electrophilicity of the alkyne, and the subsequent nucleophilic attack of the nitrogen lone-pair followed by deprotonation and demetallation affords the indolizines 27. Another interesting imine-based multicomponent reaction was reported by Clarke et al. using TiCl 4 as a Lewis acid for the synthesis of 2,6-disubstituted piperidin-4-ones 30 (Scheme 10) from the reaction of diketene, N-tosylimines and aldehydes. 28 The product 30 was obtained as a mixture of diastereomers, which could be converted into a single diastereomer by treatment with K 2 CO 3 . This protocol is successful for both aryl and alkyl imines and aldehydes, and the tosylimine could be replaced with a (2-thiophene)sulfonyl imine without any unexpected results. Mechanistically, the first step is a Mannich-type reaction, where the imine acts as an electrophile and the diketene as a nucleophile to provide the Mannich product 28. Imines derived from tosyl amides were chosen, due to their stability towards Lewis acids and, subsequently, the tosyl group would increase the electrophilicity of the imine and stabilise the Mannich product 28 with respect to a retro-Mannich reaction. Next, the formation of an iminium intermediate 29, followed by 'Mannich-like' attack of the enol form of the b-keto ester, leads to the formation of the piperidin-4-one.",

Using a similar strategy, the same group has demonstrated that a wide variety of imidazole derivatives (51) can be accessed from the multicomponent reaction of two different imines and acid chlorides in the presence of Pd/CO (Scheme 20). 39 In this case, the N-tosyl-substituted imines undergo an in situ 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition with m\u20ac unchnones 48, and provide the corresponding imidazoles. Interestingly, while this reaction involves the simultaneous coupling of different imines, no products incorporating two of the same imines were observed. In particular, the N-tosylimine is not sufficiently nucleophilic to react with the acid chloride, and thus the simple imine is incorporated into an iminium salt and ultimately forms a m\u20ac unchnone, which reacts exclusively with the more electron-poor N-tosylimine via cycloaddition to give the imidazole 51.

It was found, however, that this cross coupling can be induced by the simple addition of acid chlorides, 41 but this Pdcatalysed process was limited to the use of vinyltin reagents as the coupling partner. In order to overcome this limitation, the same group designed an efficient copper(I)-catalysed multicomponent synthesis of a-substituted amides 53 by the cross coupling of organotin reagents with imines and acid chlorides (Scheme 22). 42 This methodology proceeds efficiently with a range of vinyl-, alkyl-, aryl-and heteroaryl-substituted organostannanes as well as a diverse set of imines of non-enolisable aldehydes. Mechanistically, Stille couplings, i.e., transmetallation of organotin reagents, are similar to Sonogashira couplings, i.e., transmetallation of in situ-formed copper acetylide, and Arndtsen et al. have used this strategy to provide an efficient and general threecomponent coupling of imines with alkynes and acid chlorides to prepare propargylamides 54 using CuI as catalyst (Scheme 23). 43 In this method, not only electron-rich and electron-poor C-arylsubstituted imines, but also imines derived from heteroarylaldehydes, a,b-unsaturated imines and even the less electrophilic C-alkyl imines all react to form propargylamides in high yields. The use of enolisable imines was not encouraging, however, due to their rapid conversion into enamides under the basic reaction conditions. Reaction of a,b-unsaturated imines 55 and acid chlorides in the presence of triphenylphosphine leads to pyrroles 56 via elimination of phosphine oxide followed by cyclisation (Scheme 24). 44 This reaction proceeds via an intramolecular Wittig reaction pathway and provides one-step access to a diverse range of pyrrole products. Shaw et al. 45 reported a one-pot methodology for the diastereoselective synthesis of g-lactams 59 from the reaction of amines, maleic anhydrides, aldehydes, and thiols (Scheme 25). The iminium ion 57, formed from nucleophilic attack of the imine on the anhydride, can tautomerise at the thio-substituted carboxylate to form the enolate 58, which proceeds on to the product.

The aza-DielseAlder reaction, i.e., [4\u00fe2] cycloaddition reaction of imines (obtained from the corresponding aromatic aldehyde and aniline derivatives) with alkenes, is one of the most widely used strategies for the generation of Nheterocycles 66 in a single step. Conventionally, this reaction is known as a Povarov reaction 48 and the products of this reaction are quinoline derivatives (Scheme 28). In this reaction, the alkene must be electron-rich, which means that functional groups attached to the alkene should be able to donate electrons. The Povarov reaction requires a Lewis acid, such as boron trifluoride to activate the imine.",

The mechanism of this reaction can be rationalised by two competing mechanistic models, involving either a concerted asynchronous [4\u00fe2]-like mechanism or a stepwise mechanism. Both aromatic aldimines and N-alkyl aldimines can be utilised as azadiene components. The formation of aldimines is, however, often complicated for aliphatic aldehydes, because they are easily hydrolysed and have a tendency to undergo aldol condensation and polymerisation under acidic conditions. Thus, employing N-alkyl aldimines in the Povarov reaction is challenging. Narasaka et al. 49 reported an interesting Povarov-type reaction using Schiff bases derived from various butanals and vinyl sulfide in the presence of a stoichiometric amount (1 mol equiv) of BF 3 $OEt 2 as Lewis acid. This reaction provides a mixture of the adducts 67a and 67b in 70e83% yield (Scheme 29).",

The limitation of requiring activated, electron-rich dienophiles for this reaction can, however, be overcome through the introduction of ring strain in the dienophile. Recently, Smith et al. 50 have demonstrated that moderately strained bicyclo[2.2.1]heptenes (norbornenes) react with in situ-formed N-arylimines under Lewis acidcatalysed conditions (BF 3 $OEt 2 ) to provide the corresponding cycloaddition adducts 68. The reaction worked well with a diverse set of commercially available anilines and benzaldehydes, as well as with a variety of substituted norbornenes. In most cases, a preference for the formation of exoeexo diastereomeric adducts was observed, whereas for the reactions of ortho-or meta-substituted anilines, the formation of exoeendo adducts was also observed. Lavilla et al. 51 explored the catalytic activity of the Lewis acids, InCl 3 and Sc(OTf) 3 , for the [4\u00fe2] cycloaddition reaction between in situ imines (obtained from the aldehydes and aniline derivatives) and dihydropyridines. This reaction provides highly substituted tetrahydroquinolines 69a and 69b in good yields (Scheme 29). The reaction works well with different substituents attached to the dihydropyridine nitrogen (Me and Bn) and with several electronwithdrawing groups at position 3 (CN, CO 2 Me, CONH 2 ). In continuation of their studies on the role of substrates in the Povarov reaction these workers have revealed in another communication 52 that unsaturated lactams (70 and 71) with endo-or exo-cyclic CeC double bonds undergo a multicomponent reaction with aldehydes and aniline derivatives, leading to various structurally diverse products (Scheme 30). A simple Povarov product 72 was obtained in the case of R 4 \u00bcH. When R 4 \u00bcMe, however, the reaction with p-toluidine or 4-methoxyaniline and ethyl glyoxalate, under the usual conditions, provided the Mannich-type product 73, in moderate yields, instead of the desired Povarov product. Probably due to steric reasons, the final electrophilic substitution did not take place in this case. Interestingly, when glyoxylic acid (R 1 \u00bcCOOH) was used as the carbonyl component, the carboxylate moiety acts as a nucleophile and captures the final iminium ion intermediate to provide the adduct 74 in moderate yields (37%). In the case of pyrrolidone derivative having an exo double bond (71) , under similar reaction conditions the spiro-Povarov adduct 75 (Scheme 30) was obtained in low yield (20%). The yield can be substantially increased using microwave irradiation (MW).",

Treatment of this enol ester with p-toluidine and ethyl glyoxalate under Sc(OTf) 3 catalysis in MeCN at room temperature provided the Naryl lactam 77 (25%) as the major product, instead of the Povarov adduct 76 (Scheme 31). The formation of the N-aryl lactam 77 may be explained considering the sequential mechanism accepted for the Povarov reaction, in which the first Mannich-type step yields an intermediate A that undergoes faster lactamisation, instead of the FriedeleCrafts termination for the Povarov process to yield 77. The multicomponent reaction of alkenyl halides, silylimines and a secondary amine in the presence of a Pd(0) catalyst produces the trisubstituted pyridines 80 (Scheme 32). 54 The product is formed by the Lewis acid-catalysed aza-DielseAlder cycloaddition reaction of 2-azadiene 79, formed by cross coupling of a silylimine with an alkenyl halide, and enamine 78, formed by cross coupling of an alkenyl halide with an amine, followed by aromatisation. The three-component reaction of aromatic aldehydes, alkynes and urea or thiourea in the presence of TFA and acetic acid gives the condensation products 81, as shown in Scheme 33. 55 Mechanistically, it is believed that the intermediate I obtained from the reaction of aldehyde and urea or thiourea undergoes cycloaddition reactions. This approach allows for considerable flexibility in the nature of both the alkyne R 1 group and the aldehyde R 2 group, facilitating the preparation of a diverse array of 2-amino-4H-1,3oxazines and 2-amino-4H-1,3-thiazines. Apart from N-arylimines (2-azadienes), another type of imine, 1azadiene, is used in various multicomponent cycloaddition reactions for the construction of diverse N-heterocycles. There are several methods in the literature for the synthesis of 1-azadienes. 56 The substitution on the nitrogen atom of the azadiene dictates the type of hetero-DielseAlder reaction that occurs. Electron-rich 1azadienes generally react in normal electron-demand hetero-DielseAlder reactions, while electron-deficient 1-azadienes react in inverse electron-demand hetero-DielseAlder reactions. A few examples of 1-azadienes involved in multicomponent reactions for the cycloaddition products will now be discussed.",

The reaction of imino dienophiles with dienes is a powerful tool for the rapid construction of highly functionalised six-membered nitrogen heterocycles, such as piperidines and tetrahydroquinolines. 60 Usually, this reaction can only be performed with activated dienes like Danishefsky's diene or by using imines substituted with an electron-withdrawing group. In general, the reactivity of imines as dienophiles is very low, although it can be counteracted by the use of various Lewis Acids. Thus, the Lewis acid-catalysed aza-DielseAlder reaction of imines and various dienes is considered to be a versatile strategy for diversityoriented synthesis. Akiyama DielseAlder reaction can be carried out smoothly to afford the cycloaddition product 84 in good-to-high yields (Scheme 36). 61 In this protocol, aldimines derived from aliphatic aldehydes worked well. Alaimo et al. 62 reported a one-pot, three-component reaction of nitroarenes, aldehydes and Danishefsky's diene using In(0) as a reducing agent as well as a precatalyst for the in situ generation of In 3\u00fe for the access of dihydropyridin-4-ones 85 (Scheme 37). In this process, the byproduct In 3\u00fe generated in situ undergoes internal recycling to catalyse a cycloaddition reaction in a one-pot tandem sequence. Mechanistically, In(0) in the presence of NH 4 Cl generates InCl 3 as the reaction byproduct. The Lewis acidic InCl 3 promotes the aza-DielseAlder reaction between the imine and the added diene. Furman and Dziedzic 63 demonstrated a convenient method for the synthesis of 2,3-dihydro-4-pyridone 88 using aldimine 87 (obtained from amine 86 and benzaldehyde) as dienenophile with Danishefsky's diene in the presence of a catalytic amount of Yb(OTf) 3 (Scheme 38).

As per the proposed mechanism (Scheme 42), in the case of bketoesters, where R is a methyl group, enamine X is formed by reaction with the amine. This enamine X may then react with the aromatic aldehyde to produce a Knoevenagel-type product Y, which has a spontaneous tendency under acidic conditions for tautomerisation to give the intramolecular hydrogen-bonded enamine Z. Presumably, this hydrogen bonding along with the high conjugation is the driving force for this tautomerism. The X-ray structure of the products showed that the carboxyl and amino groups were on the same face and exhibit intramolecular hydrogen bonding.

The reaction goes via the formation of a transient imine followed by DielseAlder cycloaddition, oxazolidine ring closure and, finally, lactamisation. This methodology could also be extended to the formation of thiazolidine analogues by using amino thiols instead of amino alcohols.",

Imines represent a challenging array of functionalities that can be employed to explore chemical space efficiently and identify small molecular probes for biology. We believe that we have painted an accurate picture of the advances made by imines in the field of MCR chemistry, and this review may be a convincing case for the need to develop new MCR processes involving the versatile reactivity of imines towards many other substrates to enlarge the scope of this field, allowing the facile and selective construction of highly functionalised small organic molecules of high synthetic and biological value.
