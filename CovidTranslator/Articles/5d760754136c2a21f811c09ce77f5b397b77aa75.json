COVID-19 infection is furiously spreading at an alarming rate, with a cumulative number of 116,736 confirmed cases and 5,701 deaths outside China to date. As the earliest epidemic area, China has achieved a major victory in the cooperation of the people through the efforts of the government. At present, a total of 70,547 cases have been cured and discharged in China. In this outbreak, the elderly population is generally susceptible with high incidence of severe disease and mortality [2] . Communityacquired pneumonia in the elderly population has been found to result in decreased activities of daily living (ADL) and QoL, accompanied by decreased physical and mental function [3] . Respiratory disorders and lack of exercise in the elderly can lead to diseases such as apraxia syndrome and pulmonary infections [4] . Therefore, for elderly patients who suffered from COVID-19 and discharged with satisfying results, improved respiratory function is an important factor in maintaining ADL and QoL of the elderly.",

Participants were aware of all rehabilitation procedures, including respiratory rehabilitation (2 sessions per week for 6 weeks), once a day for 10 minutes. The demographic characteristics of each subject were assessed prior to randomizing the subject. Odd numbers of patients were in the intervention group while even numbers of patients in the control group using a computer-generated allocation order. Interventions included: (1) respiratory muscle training; (2) cough exercise; (3) diaphragmatic training; (4) stretching exercise; and (5) home exercise. For respiratory muscle training, participants used a commercial hand-held resistance device (Threshold PEP; Philips Co.) for three sets with 10 breaths in each set; parameters were set at 60% of the individual's maximal expiratory mouth pressure, with a rest period of 1 minute between the two sets. Three sets of 10 active coughs were adopted for cough exercises. For diaphragmatic training, each participant performed 30 maximal voluntary diaphragmatic contractions in the supine position, placing a medium weight (1-3 kg) on the anterior abdominal wall to resist diaphragmatic descent. In stretching exercises, the respiratory muscles are stretched under the guidance of a rehabilitation therapist. The patient was placed in the supine or lateral decubitus position with the knees bent to correct the lumbar curve. Patients were ordered to move their arms in flexion, horizontal extension, abduction, and external rotation. In terms of home exercises, subjects were instructed in pursed-lip breathing and coughing training, and asked to undergo 30 sets per day.",

The reason may be that the rehabilitation training related to respiratory muscles in respiratory rehabilitation training, and respiratory muscles include intercostal muscles, enthusiastic muscles, abdominal wall muscles, etc., which play an important role in maintaining respiratory function. The decline of its function leads to dyspnea, abdominal breathing with labial constriction, increases the expansion range of the breast muscle during breathing, encourages patients to exercise the abdominal wall during breathing to reduce chest wall movement, slows down the respiratory rate to reduce power consumption, and increases pulmonary ventilation and blood oxygen content [8] .",

However, exercise training is the core of respiratory rehabilitation, its effect is affected by the way, intensity, time and place of exercise training, and reasonable exercise training has a positive impact on the physical and mental health and QoL of COVID-19 patients [10] . Maki [11] et al. evaluated a study of 2504 patients with chronic obstructive non-disease who received exercise intervention and found that the patients' muscle strength increased by 78%, muscle endurance increased by 92% and muscle mass increased by 88%. The mechanism of action of exercise training on COPD rehabilitation is mostly related to the improvement of ventilation and gas exchange function, cardiovascular function and limb muscle function in patients [12] . Combined with our data, it is suggested that exercise training has a significant improvement on exercise capacity in COVID-19 patients.",

In addition, the independence of living ability of our patients was weak, so the improvement of living ability was not significant after short-term respiratory rehabilitation. In our study, QoL was assessed using the SF-36, and there was an improvement in QoL after 6 weeks of respiratory rehabilitation, which was statistically significant with the control group. Studies have found that: respiratory rehabilitation can improve the QoL of patients with COPD [6], asthma [13], lung cancer after surgery [14] . Additionally, we found that 6 weeks of respiratory rehabilitation significantly improved anxiety in elderly patients with COVID-19, which is consistent with the effect of respiratory rehabilitation in COPD with Rebelo [15] . While in our previous study, it has been found that patients with COVID-19 experience increased depression and anxiety after isolation treatment [16] . On the other hand, positive changes in depression scores did not seem to be influenced after the respiratory rehabilitation program. This is in line with the findings of McNamara [17] et al. who reported that 6 to 9 weeks of respiratory rehabilitation did not improve depression in elderly patients with COPD. The above results need to be further confirmed by samples and longer respiratory rehabilitation studies.",
