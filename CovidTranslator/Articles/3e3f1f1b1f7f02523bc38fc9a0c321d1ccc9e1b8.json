Laboratory variables revealed slight anemia in 8 calves, hypoalbuminemia in 6 calves, but reduced serum zinc concentrations in only 3 calves.

These animals showed a striking clinical similarity to calves affected by bovine hereditary zinc deficiency (BHZD), a keratinization disorder caused by a mutation in the SLC39A4 gene. 1, 2 However, a molecular genetic study we conducted on 7 of the affected Fleckvieh calves excluded SLC39A4 as causative gene for the syndrome. 3 Genome-wide resequencing of 1 affected calf identified a nonsense mutation (p.W215X) in a phospholipase D encoding gene (PLD4), located on bovine chromosome 21, as most likely polymorphism. The disease has an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance. A study on the progeny descending from carriers of the mutation showed a significant reduction of the survival rates (P 5 2.97 3 10 28 ). 3 Because of the phenotypic similarity to BHZD the condition was named zinc deficiency-like (ZDL) syndrome.",

The owners observed first skin lesions at median age of 45 days (mean: 49 days; range: 21-95 days). Calves were presented with a history of recurrent diarrhea, fever, dyspnea, and runting. Calf 5 had a female twin, which deceased with 79 days (necropsy was not conducted). The twin's first skin lesions were detected on the head, best obvious around the muzzle and periorbital regions and on the ventrum.

A moderate to severe exudative and crusting generalized dermatitis was present in all calves (Fig 1a,b ). Skin regions with mild lesions displayed loose flakes. In moderate to severely affected regions there were large plates with rhagades, consisting of crusts, keratin, and hair (Fig 1c) . Removal of single plates was not possible without injuring the epidermis. Moderate to severe lesions were predominantly localized on the head (around the muzzle, eyes, and on the forehead, Fig 1b) , ventrum (Regio sternalis, R. umbilicalis), joints (R. cubiti, R. carpi, R. genus/ plicae lateralis, R. tarsi), and inguinal and axillary region. The peripheral lymph nodes were enlarged in all calves (Fig 1d) . Calves 1, 4, and 5 displayed interdigital small erosions. Several calves displayed mucosal lesions and excessive salivation, 5 calves displayed yellow plaques on their incisors. Calf 9 was infested by numerous Damalinia. Seven calves displayed signs of weakness: weight shifting from 1 hind leg to the other and sudden bending of knees (5 calves), constant muscle tremor (Calf 3), and inability to rise (Calf 1). Calves 3 and 5 were extremely exhausted, did not move after being placed in lateral recumbency and fell into deep sleep immediately.

            "text": "The predominantly mild microcytic, normochromic anemia, and mild hypoalbuminemia of the calves is very likely because of the chronic inflammatory state. 15-17 Leukocytosis reflects the severe inflammatory infiltration in skin, respiratory, or digestive tract. Decreased serum zinc concentrations can be associated with chronic inflammation as well. Additionally, the chronic enteritis and the catabolic state of the calves could be the cause of hypoalbuminemia. The concentrations of the trace elements copper and iron were below reference ranges in 3/7 and 4/5 calves, respectively. The low iron concentrations can be caused by the chronic inflammatory state or reduced alimentary uptake because of disease-associated anorexia. However, the causes and connections of the metabolic disturbances in these calves are not known. As copper, iron, and zinc concentrations also have synergistic and antagonistic properties in physiological states, the reason for the observed concentration changes in this disease deserves further study. The similarity of the ZDL phenotype to BHZD is striking, even though the genetic cause and affected breeds are clearly distinct. 2, 3 Bovine hereditary zinc deficiency, first described in Holstein Friesian calves, 1 affects a variety of cattle breeds including Fleckvieh, Holstein Friesian, Shorthorn, and Angus. 8, 18, 19 Bovine hereditary zinc deficiency-affected calves show keratinization disorders, thymus hypoplasia, respiratory and digestive tract inflammations, oral mucosal ulcerations, impaired function of the immune system, and growth retardation as consequence of a malfunction of an intestinal zinc transporter. [20] [21] [22] In zinc deficiency in Holstein Friesian cattle, a splice-site variant in the SLC39A4 gene is the underlying mutation. 2 This gene encodes a zinc transporter which is crucial for intestinal zinc uptake. 23 In humans, several additional mutations in this gene are also responsible for an inherited zinc deficiency syndrome known as acrodermatitis enteropathica. [24] [25] [26] Because of the malfunction of the intestinal zinc transporter, BHZD calves do respond to oral zinc supplementation. 20, 27 In one study, clinical signs developed when plasma zinc concentration dropped below 0.5 ppm and a plasma zinc concentration of 1.0 ppm was maintained through oral supplementation to keep the animal without clinical signs. 27 In the present study, the zinc doses were within (Calf 2) and above (Calf 4) the range of published values used to alleviate or resolve clinical disease of zinc deficient calves. 8, 20, 27 In both calves, serum zinc concentrations responded to the treatment and were above the maintenance zinc concentrations of Machen et al. 27 Unfortunately, the exact dose given to Calf 6 is not known, however, serum zinc concentration was at the upper limit of the reference range and was also above the maintenance zinc concentration of Machen et al. Calf 9 was treated with 10-16 mg elementary zinc per day. This dose appears really low when compared to the other calves and its effects were probably minor (low serum zinc concentrations). Although serum zinc concentrations are not always useful to determine tissue zinc concentrations, 28 elevation after treatment indicates that intestinal uptake took place. In zinc-treated BHZD calves, clinical signs improve after 1-3 weeks and completely resolve after 2-6 weeks. 2, 20 However, the clinical signs observed in Calves 2, 4, and 6 did neither improve nor resolve, clearly separating this syndrome from BHZD clinically. Nonetheless, zinc supplementation might help the animal to survive longer, possibly because of positive effects of zinc on skin and immune system. 29 Marked hypoplasia of the thymus with an average thymus weight of 18 g has been reported in 15 affected BHZD calves. 30 Thymus weights in this study revealed thymic atrophy, yet the thymus was readily identifiable and weighed nearly 3 times more than described in BHZD. Although thymus weight/body weight ratio was lower than published ratios, 31 gross and histologic examination could not support a finding of \"marked hypoplasia.\"",

[34] [35] [36] However, little is known about role and function of PLD4. Localized in the spleen and early microglia, a role in immunological pathways has been suggested. 4 Its enzymatic activity is still enigmatic and possible nonenzymatic functions are discussed. 33 There is considerable interspecies phenotypic variation between the few diseases and syndromes linked to PLD4 so far. Recent studies associated variants in PLD4 with systemic sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis in the Japanese population. 6, 7, 37 Mice carrying a nonsense mutation in PLD4 manifest a phenotype with thin hair and small size that seems quite distinct from ZDL syndrome in calves. 38, 39 These substantial differences between the species highlight the importance of different models, which allow investigation of PLD4 functions and its position within metabolic pathways.",
