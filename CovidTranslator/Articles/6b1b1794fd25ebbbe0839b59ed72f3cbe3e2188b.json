            "text": "Infectious bronchitis (IB) and Newcastle disease (ND) are common viral diseases of chickens, which are caused by infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) and Newcastle disease virus (NDV), respectively. Vaccination with live attenuated strains of IBV-H120 and NDV-LaSota are important for the control of IB and ND. However, conventional live attenuated vaccines are expensive and result in the inability to differentiate between infected and vaccinated chickens. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop new efficacious vaccines. In this study, using a previously established reverse genetics system, we generated a recombinant IBV virus based on the IBV H120 vaccine strain expressing the haemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) protein of NDV. The recombinant virus, R-H120-HN/5a, exhibited growth dynamics, pathogenicity and viral titers that were similar to those of the parental IBV H120, but it had acquired hemagglutination activity from NDV. Vaccination of SPF chickens with the R-H120-HN/5a virus induced a humoral response at a level comparable to that of the LaSota/H120 commercial bivalent vaccine and provided significant protection against challenge with virulent IBV and NDV. In summary, the results of this study indicate that the IBV H120 strain could serve as an effective tool for designing vaccines against IB and other infectious diseases, and the generation of IBV R-H120-HN/5a provides a solid foundation for the development of an effective bivalent vaccine against IBV and NDV.",

Several strains have been developed as vaccines strains, including IBV vaccine strains H120, M41, and Beaudette [4, 5] and NDV vaccine strains LaSota, Clone30, and B1 [6, 7] . The IBV H120 strain, an attenuated live vaccine strain of the Massachusetts (Mass) type, is widely available and reliable vaccine strain that is used as a primary vaccine in broilers, breeders and future layers [4, 8] , and the NDV LaSota strain, a naturally occurring low-virulence NDV strain, has been used routinely as a live vaccine throughout the world [9] . The current live attenuated vaccines, although effective, are expensive and result in the inability to differentiate infected from vaccinated chickens. Therefore, we are now at a stage where it is crucial to develop innovative live bivalent vaccines.",

            "text": "IBV, a coronavirus of chickens, is an enveloped virus that contains a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome of approximately 27.6 kb in size, with a 5' cap and a 3' polyA tail [10, 11] . As in other coronaviruses, the 5' approximately two thirds of the IBV genome encode two polyproteins, 1a and 1b, which are further processed to form the proteins necessary for RNA replication [12] . The remaining 3' approximately one-third of the genome X. Yang and Y. Zhou encodes four major structural proteins: the spike (S) glycoprotein, the small envelope (E) protein, the membrane (M) glycoprotein, and the nucleocapsid (N) protein [13] . In addition, there are also two accessory genes interspersed among the structural protein genes: gene 3, which encodes the accessory proteins 3a and 3b, and gene 5, which encodes the accessory proteins 5a and 5b [2, 14] . The large size of the IBV genome and its potential for expressing heterologous genes has made this virus attractive for use in the development of viral-vector vaccines [15] . Previous research by us and others using reverse genetics systems has allowed the production of full-length cDNAs from various IBV vaccine strains, including H120 and Beaudette [5, 16] . Furthermore, it has been shown that heterologous genes can be incorporated into and expressed from a range of IBV (Beaudette strain) genome locations [15] . All of these advances in the field now mean we can explore the uses of IBV strains in vaccine vector development.",

Because the F12 fragment from our previously established reverse genetics system of IBV H120 contained the 5a gene, the F12 fragment was used to carry the HN gene for replacing the 5a gene. The upstream region of F12, named F12-1, was amplified by PCR using the F12 amplicon as a template together with primers F12 F and F12-1 R, while the downstream region of F12, named F12-2, was amplified from the F12 amplicon using primers F12-2 F and F12 R (Table 1 ). Next, the three amplicons (HN, F12-1, and F12-2) were cloned into the vector pMD-19 (TAKARA, Japan) to generate pT-HN, pT-F12-1, and pT-F12-2, respectively. Two to four independent clones of each amplicon were sequenced by the Sangon Biological Engineering Technology & Services Co., Ltd. Each amplicon that contained the consensus sequence was released from the cloning vector by restriction enzyme digestion (HN with BsmBI, F12-1 and F12-2 with BsaI) and then purified using a QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (QIAGEN Inc., Valencia, CA). Using T4 DNA ligase, the cDNA amplicons were then ligated in the correct order (F12-1?HN?F12-2) in an equimolar ratio to the DF12 fragment to replace the 5a gene of IBV-H120 with the HN gene of NDV-LaSota.",

However, the Mass type has been continually isolated from The growth pattern of R-H120-HN/5a in chicken embryos was similar to that of R-H120 and H120 Fig. 3 Specific anti-IBV IgG antibody titers of different vaccination groups measured by ELISA. Serum samples were collected weekly from all chickens. Antibody titer data were analyzed using the Statistics Package for Social Science (SPSS). The mean antibody titers of each immunized group on days 0, 7, 14, 21, 28 after vaccination are shown chicken flocks with respiratory clinical signs up to the present day [23] [24] [25] . In this study, R-H120-HN/5a induced complete protection against challenges with IBV M41 in SPF chickens, as did H20 and LaSota/H120 in this study and in a previous report [1] , indicating that the recombinant vaccine is protective against the Mass type of IBV and has practical application value in chicken flocks. Although H120 attenuated vaccine has been shown to be able to protect against a wide range of virulent IBV strains [25] , it is not yet known whether the recombinant vaccine is protective against other IBV strains. Cross-protection experiments are therefore still needed. NDVs are separated into two classes. Class I includes two genotypes, and class II includes 18 genotypes [26] . The LaSota strain, belonging to genotype II of class II, has been commonly used as a live-virus NDV vaccine strain since the 1950s [27] , but several studies have reported that using LaSota vaccine to immunize chickens could provide cross-protection against other genotypes of NDV, such as VIb, VIg, VIId, XVII and IX [28] [29] [30] . In the present study, the recombinant vaccine expressing LaSota HN protein displayed 80 % protective efficacy against challenge with NDV F48E9 (IX genotype), in contrast to 90 % protective efficacy in this study and 100 % protective efficacy reported by Liu et al. induced by LaSota live vaccine [28] . Recently, Kumar et al. reported that a recombinant avian paramyxovirus type 3 vector expressing both the HN and F proteins could be used to protect against virulent NDV strain, but birds immunized with the vector expressing HN alone were only partially protected [31] . Furthermore, it has been reported that not only the HN protein but also the fusion glycoprotein (F), which mediates the fusion of the viral envelope with the cell membrane, are the neutralizing and protective antigens of NDV [18, 32] . Therefore, the development of an R-H120 recombinant vaccine that expresses both the HN and F genes needs to be further investigated in order to investigate its protective efficacy against virulent NDV.",

            "text": "Immunization of SPF chickens is commonly used to evaluate the protective efficacy and immune response to IB and ND vaccines [29, 30, 33, 34] . It seems probable that the ideal protective effect will be achieved when using SPF chickens. However, poor protection rates will be possibly be obtained when vaccines are applied to commercial chickens in chicken flocks due to interference from maternal antibodies, asymptomatic infections with these viruses, or immune tolerance of the chickens [35, 36] . Thus, the protective efficacy of the recombinant vaccine reported here needs to be evaluated in commercial chickens. Although the efficacy of the recombinant vaccine in this study should be further improved and evaluated, it has two obvious advantages when compared with conventional IBV and NDV live vaccines. First, as the recombinant virus can express both the IBV and NDV antigens, it will reduce the number of embryonated chicken eggs by a half for virus cultures during vaccine production and thus cut down on production costs. Second, in veterinary clinical practice, it is difficult to differentiate IBV-infected from IBV-vaccinated chickens by RT-PCR due to the usage of conventional live vaccines. However, the 5a IBV gene, which is absent in the recombinant vaccine in this study, can be used as a target gene for RT-PCR detection if this recombinant vaccine is widely used. Viral vectors are promising tools for making vaccines, and genetically altered vaccine vectors have been developed to improve efficacy and safety, reduce administration dose, and enable large-scale manufacturing [37] . IBV H120 strain has several features that make it attractive as an avian vaccine vector. First, IBV possesses the largest known avian viral RNA genome, at 27.6 kb [12] , which makes it possible to incorporate larger heterologous gene sequences. Second, the deletion of nonessential genes such as 5a, 3a and 3b is not a disadvantage for viral replication [38, 39] , and this provides suitable targets for the insertion of heterologous genes. Third, it has been shown that nonessential genes of IBV can be replaced with heterologous genes and that recombinant viruses show the characteristics of stable replication and the expression of heterologous genes. Fourth, IBV H120, an attenuated live vaccine strain used worldwide in chicken flocks, is considered to be a safe and widely available vaccine strain for protecting against IB [4, 8] . Therefore, we chose IBV H120 to carry the NDV HN gene, replacing the 5a gene, which was generally found to have little effect on viral growth and protein expression in this study. These results also indicate that IBV H120 can be engineered to stably express a foreign protein and can be manipulated in the future for use as a vaccine vector. In summary, for the first time, to our knowledge, we have generated and evaluated the potential of the IBV H120 strain as a vaccine vector for the expression of the NDV HN protein.",
