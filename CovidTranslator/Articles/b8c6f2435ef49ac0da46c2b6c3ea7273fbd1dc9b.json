However, the association between mortality rates and age has been limited in SARS patients 5 . Therefore, the aims of this study were to: (1) examine the associations among age, education, past history of disease (e.g., cancer, pulmonary disease), severity of the illness (e.g., chest X-ray findings and laboratory data), and mortality rate in patients with SARS; and (2) determine the significant predictors of death in patients with SARS.",

Among them, 28 cases (35.9%) were medical care staff, with nurses making up 57.1%, which might explain why most patients of probable SARS cases are females. The medical care staff ratio (35.9%) in our study was similar to the literature [6] [7] [8] [9] 12 ; therefore, a latent occupational risk of medical care staff could be seen. In this study, the earliest symptom to emerge was fever, accounting for 98.7% of cases, which is consistent with the literature 8 . Although the rate decreased gradually after admission, there were still 34 patients (43.6%) who required fever medicine a week after admission. Thus, a decreased fever rate does not mean improvement of the disease. In the early stage of disease (in hospitalization and before hospitalization), 48.7% of cases had cough symptoms. Dry cough and wet cough each accounted for half of the cases, differing from the mostly dry cough symptoms found in the literature 6, 8 . In this study, 16.7% of patients had contracted pulmonary disease in the past, which may have played a role. After disregarding cases with pulmonary disease history, the cough type of the remaining probable SARS cases was primarily dry cough (58.6%). In laboratory examination, blood test values for the first visit to emergency department on admission, including lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, creatine kinase, aspartate transaminase, alanine transaminase and CRP, increased abnormally, somewhat similar to the literature 5, 6, 8, 9 . The leukopenia rate in this study was 23.4% and the other values reported in the literature were between 10.3% and 19.7% 5, 6, 9 .

Older patients and patients with a history of cancer or pulmonary disease might be more vulnerable to SARS infections. There were several factors affecting elderly mortality, which reportedly consisted of age [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] , preexisting comorbidity and a decreased host resistance by reduced physical reserves and less ability to compensate, thus leading to death in older victims 24 . The significant relationship between marriage and death might be because most married people live with families, making them vulnerable to cross infection, which is one of the SARS epidemiologic features. Most SARS infection cases were caused by nosocomial infection. In this study, over 35% were confirmed by medical records to be medical care staff, which may explain why most medical care staff who had to care for infected cases closely were of a higher education. Therefore, it makes sense that education and medical care staff significantly correlated with death. Previous studies reported that correlations of age 5, 7 , chest X-rays 5 and past disease history (cancer and pulmonary disease) 5 with casualty were regarded to be associated with death from SARS. Logistic regression statistic results indicated that intubation was a significant predictor for death. However, Liu et al. 8 suggested that acute respiratory failure was also a crucial recovery factor from SARS as well.",
