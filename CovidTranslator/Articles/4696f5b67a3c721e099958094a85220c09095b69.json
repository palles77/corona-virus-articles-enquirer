            "text": "Background: A number of publications focusing on health care workers (HCWs) during a severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak have suggested that HCWs experienced psychological distress, particularly increased levels of posttraumatic stress symptomatology (PTSS). Factors contributing to increased distress in HCWs working in high-risk areas treating patients with SARS have not been fully elucidated. The goal of this study was to quantify the psychological effects of working in a high-risk unit during the SARS outbreak. Methods: HCWs in a Toronto hospital who worked in high-risk areas completed a questionnaire regarding their attitude toward the SARS crisis along with the Impact of Event Scale-Revised, which screens for PTSS. The comparison group consisted of clinical units that had no contact with patients infected with SARS. Results: Factors that were identified to cause distress in the 248 respondent HCWs were the following: (a) perception of risk to themselves, (b) impact of the SARS crisis on their work life, (c) depressive affect, and (d) working in a high-risk unit. In addition, HCWs who cared for only one SARS patient in comparison to those caring for multiple SARS patients experienced more PTSS. Conclusions: As expected, HCWs who were working in highrisk units experienced greater distress. Contrary to expectations, HCWs who experienced greater contact with SARS patients while working in the high-risk units were less distressed. This suggests that HCW experience in treating patients infected with SARS may be a mediating factor that could be amenable to intervention in future outbreaks.",

Several variables [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] that could increase the likelihood that an HCW would experience distress while working during an outbreak were identified. These variables included (a) being a nurse [15] , (b) working part-time [15] , (c) experiencing health fear and social isolation [16] , (d) being placed in quarantine [17] , (e) lower self-efficacy [18] , (f) lifestyle affected by the SARS outbreak [15] , (g) one's ability to do one's job being affected by precautionary measures [15] , and (h) personal vulnerability [19, 20] . It is essential to try to identify factors in the health care environment that may be precipitants or modifiers of HCW distress so that HCWs can be provided with the most favorable working conditions possible in times of extreme stress. In order to address these stressors, several studies [15, 16, [20] [21] [22] postulated similar methods to decrease the concerns of HCWs: clear directives regarding IC measures, use of active coping and positive framing, obtaining support from colleagues and family, and the ability to provide feedback to and obtain support from management.",

Eight selected units that were not involved in either the assessment or management of patients with SARS agreed to participate as a comparison group. The eight comparison units included two oncology units, three general medicine units, one cardiology unit, one general surgery unit, and one multiorgan transplant surgery unit within the same hospital system. An e-mail was sent to each unit manager, informing them about the study and asking for their permission to distribute the questionnaires to employees on their units. All contacted nursing units agreed to participate.

The IES-R has been found to be more sensitive to a more general construct of traumatic stress in those with lower symptom levels [25] , such as those who might be experiencing posttraumatic stress symptomatology (PTSS) [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] . The response format of IES-R consists of a 5-point Likert scale from 0 to 4 and provides three subscores for PTSD criteria: avoidance, intrusion, and hyperarousal. In this study, for the purpose of detecting the presence of PTSS rather than diagnostic PTSD, we used a total score of 20 or greater as a cutoff of significant stress in the HCW population based on other published studies [31, 32] .

We also identified that the level of contact (number of patients with SARS treated) has an important mediating effect on the degree of PTSS experienced. Data showed that caring for only one patient with SARS is significantly more stressful than caring for none or caring for two or more patients with SARS. In order to cope successfully when exposed to a stressful situation, an individual is required to assess his or her self-efficacy, which entails self-appraisal of his or her individual ability to cope with the stressful event [33] [34] [35] . The experience of HCWs who cared for several patients with SARS and were exposed on repeated occasions without being infected may have bolstered their confidence in their own ability to successfully use IC measures to manage their own risk and the risk to others. Effective coping, in this case, caring for patients with SARS, would not only have reduced the level of personal distress but may also have promoted a sense of personal efficacy to meet the ongoing requirements of a challenging task on a daily basis [36] . Other factors identified to moderate the level of PTSS in the HCW population in this study were (a) impact on work life, (b) perception of personal risk, and (c) depressive affect, which are similar to those identified by other studies of HCWs dealing with the SARS outbreak [14] [15] [16] 18] .",

Personal risk to the HCW was an identified stressor in our study population, but the stress may have been moderated by the confidence expressed by HCWs in the IC measures and the IC information they received. This confidence may have helped to mitigate the powerlessness and vulnerability originally experienced by HCWs in the early days of the SARS outbreak. Confidence in IC measures and information appeared to be a common finding among HCWs in other studies [14, 38] and may have been a determining factor in assisting HCWs from various countries in dealing with the perceived personal risk while continuing to work in health care institutions.",

ICU HCWs are used to finding themselves caring for the dying patient. However, during the SARS outbreak, they found themselves to be the only ones at the bedside of patients who were dying of SARS. The patient's families were often quarantined or ill themselves and were unable or were not allowed to visit. These types of events would have placed a psychological burden on the HCW who would not have the opportunity, as in non-SARS times, to grieve with the patient's family and coworkers. The effect of a depressive affect on the level of distress experienced by HCWs is not surprising as it is known from previous epidemiological studies [39] that depressive disorders and PTSD are among the major psychiatric problems associated with disaster and traumatic events and will often co-occur. It has been postulated [40] that the combined effect of loss and threat may explain the frequent co-occurrence of PTSD and depression. In this case, the illness of coworkers with SARS was a loss to their colleagues, and the threat that they may also contract the SARS virus placed a heavy psychological burden on the individual HCW. Other studies [14] [15] [16] 23] of HCWs during the SARS outbreak also found that large percentages experienced difficulties with depression, poor family relations, sleep problems, and somatic symptoms associated with depression.",

This may have resulted in higher calculations of nonrespondent rates since the number of staff who would have come in contact with the survey would have been variable over the 3-week period that the study was carried out. Response rates of this study are comparable to other Canadian studies of SARS and HCW-47% in the study of Nickell et al. [15] and 23.3% in the study of Maunder et al. [16] .",

It is likely that HCWs who chose to participate differed in some respects from those who did not. HCWs in the high-risk units would be expected to be more acutely aware of the SARS experience and, thus, were likely to be more motivated to participate. Another determining factor may also have been the availability of staff time. Comparison units, which were low-risk units, had a smaller patient-to-staff ratio than the high-risk units, which usually had patient-to-staff ratios of 1:1 in the ICU and SARS unit. The number of HCWs available to be surveyed in the various high-risk units was variable, but it was scientifically necessary to include all designated high-risk units so that we would have a representative sample of this category of HCW. The ratio of possible respondents in the ICU versus the ED and SARS unit was approximately 5:1. The results need to be interpreted conservatively given the limitations of the number of respondents in the various categories.",

Also, two studies [15, 16] that were carried out in Toronto would suggest that our study sample is representative of other HCWs in Toronto since their findings are similar to those of our study, for example, having found increased distress to be associated with health fear and work stress. In contrast, our study also explored the exposure to SARS patients not only by self-report but also based on the information of each unit in which the HCW was working. The fact that HCWs in high-risk areas experienced more distress than those working in low-risk areas was not unexpected, but the finding that the greater number of patients cared for was associated with reduced PTSS needs to be further explored.",

Acknowledgment of this differential would be instrumental in implementing supportive workforce resources during an infectious disease outbreak. Efforts to address the level of distress in these areas may need to be centered on providing HCWs with ways to enhance their self-efficacy in dealing with high-risk situations such as SARS. A greater experience with SARS patients appeared to mitigate distress level. Using a buddy system (pairing an experienced HCW with a less experienced HCW) may help to transfer skills and address the social isolation brought about by changes in the work environment. This may be further enhanced by providing opportunities for HCWs to exchange and address concerns, share strategies that have been helpful, normalize feelings related to stressful situations, and discuss maladaptive responses. Involvement of occupational health experts [37] would help minimize the negative effects on work life and address the sense of helplessness that leads to a depressive affect [41] . Implementing systems for communication between HCWs and administration, health care facilities, and government [37] , as well as preparation and planning for an outbreak, may help HCWs to reframe disease outbreaks so that they have a better sense of self-efficacy and control of the situation.",
