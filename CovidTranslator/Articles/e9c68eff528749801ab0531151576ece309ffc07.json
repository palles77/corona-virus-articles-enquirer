The single accessory gene of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), ORF3, is dispensable for virus replication in vitro, while viral mutants carrying ORF3 truncations exhibit an attenuated phenotype of which the underlying mechanism is unknown. Here, we studied the effect of ORF3 deletion on the proliferation of PEDV in Vero cells. To this end, four recombinant porcine epidemic diarrhea viruses (PEDVs) were rescued using targeted RNA recombination, three carrying the full-length ORF3 gene from different PEDV strains, and one from which the ORF3 gene had been deleted entirely. Our results showed that PEDVs with intact or naturally truncated ORF3 replicated to significantly higher titers than PEDV without an ORF3. Further characterization revealed that the extent of apoptosis induced by PEDV infection was significantly lower with the viruses carrying an intact or C-terminally truncated ORF3 than with the virus lacking ORF3, indicating that the ORF3 protein as well as its truncated form interfered with the apoptosis process. Collectively, we conclude that PEDV ORF3 protein promotes virus proliferation by inhibiting cell apoptosis caused by virus infection. Our findings provide important insight into the role of ORF3 protein in the pathogenicity of PEDV.",

Its genome, about 28 kb in length, encodes two nonstructural polyproteins (pp1a and pp1ab), four structural proteins-the approximately 200 kDa glycosylated spike (S) protein, 8 kDa envelope (E) protein, 24 kDa membrane (M) protein, and 58 kDa nucleocapsid (N) protein-and one known accessory protein, the ORF3 protein [7, 8] . Pp1a and pp1ab are the precursors of several enzymes and cofactors that together carry out PEDV genome replication and transcription. The S glycoprotein, trimers of which protrude from the viral membrane providing the coronaviruses their typical appearance, functions during cell entry by binding to cellular receptors and causing fusion of the viral and host cell membranes. The E protein has ion channel activity [9] and plays an important role in virion morphogenesis. The M protein is the main component of the viral envelope and interacts with all structural components during viral particle assembly. The N protein packages the genomic RNA to form the helical nucleocapsid (RNP).",

PEDV ORF3 encodes a protein of 224 residues, which is about 25 kDa, but the gene is prone to undergo a 49-51 nucleotide (nt) deletion mutation when the virus is adapted to growth in cell culture, e.g., by serial passaging [11, 12] . The 49-nt deletion leads to a premature translation stop at nt 274 giving rise to a naturally truncated ORF3 protein of 92 residues designated ORF3 trun , as is the case with ORF3 of the attenuated DR13 strain (DR13 att ), which was used as the backbone of the recombinant viruses generated in the present study. Another type of ORF3 variant, as occurring in PEDV strains 85-7 and AVCT12, has a 30 nt deletion at the 5 -end giving rise to a truncated ORF3 protein missing 70 residues at its N-terminus [13, 14] . Field isolates with longer-length deletions of ORF3 have also been documented [15] .",

The protein has been reported to function as an ion channel in both Xenopus laevis oocytes and yeast cells. Suppression of ORF3 expression by siRNA was found to inhibit the production of wild-type PEDV but not that of attenuated-type PEDV [16] . Using a Vero cell line stably expressing ORF3, it was demonstrated that PEDV ORF3 protein prolonged the S phase of the cell cycle besides augmenting vesicle formation in the cells. Interestingly, constitutive expression of the ORF3 protein exerted a positive regulatory effect on the proliferation of attenuated PEDV but not on that of virulent PEDV [17] . In a more recent study, both the wild type and a mutant ORF3 protein lacking residues 82-98 were found to co-localize with the S protein intracellularly and at the cell surface, both in infected cells and during co-expression in transfected cells [18] . Additionally, a direct interaction of the S protein with each of these ORF3 proteins was demonstrated in such transfected cells by co-immunoprecipitation, leading the authors to suggest that the ORF3 protein might be involved in virus assembly.",

They were constructed by substituting in vector pPEDV-DR13 att the ORF3 sequence by the ORF3 sequences of PEDV strains DR13 wt , CV777 and NY or by entirely deleting the ORF3 sequence from the construct ( Figure 1A) . The different ORF3 sequences were validated by sequencing and the vector constructs were validated by PCR analysis of the inserts ( Figure 1B ) and by double restriction digestion analysis with PmlI and AgeI ( Figure 1C ). To generate the different rPEDVs, in vitro RNA transcripts from pDR13 att -ORF3 wt , pDR13 att -ORF3 CV777 , pDR13 att -ORF3 NY , or pDR13 att -\u2206ORF3 were electro-transfected into LR7 cells that had been infected with mPEDV, after which the electroporated cells were co-cultured with Vero cells. CPE appeared in the Vero cells around 40 h post electroporation (Figure 2A) . The recombinant viruses rDR13 att -ORF3 wt , rDR13 att -ORF3 CV777 , rDR13 att -ORF3 NY , and rDR13 att -\u2206ORF3 were purified on Vero cells by terminal dilution and stocks were prepared. For the verification of the recombinant viruses, RT-PCR was performed to amplify specific segments of the RNA genome for sequencing. Using primers mapping in the 3 -end of the S gene and the 5 -end of the E gene, DNA fragments of expected sizes were amplified, i.e., a 725 bp fragment amplified from rDR13 att -ORF3 wt , rDR13 att -ORF3 CV777 , and rDR13 att -ORF3 NY , respectively, and a 309 bp fragment amplified from rDR13 att -\u2206ORF3 ( Figure 2B ). Sequencing of the fragments further confirmed the results. Immunohistochemical analysis (IHA) with mouse anti-PEDV N monoclonal antibody showed all the rescued recombinant porcine epidemic diarrhea viruses (PEDVs) to be able to infect the Vero cells ( Figure 2C ). The IHA analysis also showed ORF3 protein staining with the P71-3 antibody in Vero cells infected with recombinant viruses rDR13 att -ORF3 wt , rDR13 att -ORF3 CV777 , and rDR13 att -ORF3 NY , but not in rDR13 att -\u2206ORF3 infected and mock-infected cells ( Figure 2D ).

The three rPEDVs carrying a wild type ORF3-rDR13 att -ORF3 wt , rDR13 att -ORF3 CV777 , and rDR13 att -ORF3 NY reached a maximal titer of approximately 10 5.7 TCID 50 /mL at~24-32 h.p.i.

The DR13 att vaccine strain reached a titer of 10 5.8 TCID 50 /mL at 40 h.p.i., the highest titer among the five PEDVs examined. Statistical analysis indicated the difference between the peak titers of rPEDVs with an intact ORF3 and that of the rPEDV without ORF3 to be significant (p < 0.05). Because all these PEDVs had the same genetic backbone except for their ORF3, the results indicated that the presence of an intact ORF3 protein-enhanced PEDV proliferation.

No significant difference was observed between DR13 att infected cells and cells infected with the full-length ORF3 expressing viruses. This result indicated that full-length ORF3 protein and its C-terminally truncated form may have the same anti-apoptotic effects. To directly observe the different apoptotic states of the cells infected with the PEDVs, a TUNEL assay was carried out following an earlier used method [21] . While no apparent TUNEL-labelling was detected in the PEDV S protein-positive cells at 8 h.p.i., the TUNEL signal was obvious in these infected cells at 16 h.p.i. and even more so at 24 h.p.i.

In the case of PEDV, studies about ORF3 protein have been incoherent; many involved gene sequence analyses but few were about its biological functions. In a recent study, PEDV ORF3 protein was reported to have no effect on cell apoptosis [24] . In the present study, using a unique system of reverse genetics, the ORF3 protein was demonstrated to enhance virus proliferation by a mechanism involving inhibition of cell apoptosis.",

All the viruses had the same DR13 att genetic backbone, their only difference being their ORF3. Rather than also making a recombinant virus expressing a truncated ORF3 protein (ORF3 trun ), we used the DR13 att strain to examine the behavior of ORF3 trun protein. We used these viruses to investigate whether the ORF3 protein plays a role in viral proliferation. By comparing the growth kinetics of the different viruses, we found that rPEDVs carrying ORF3, including also the one expressing the truncated form, proliferated faster and to higher titers than the virus without the gene, suggesting the ORF3 protein promotes the proliferation of PEDV in the cell culture system.",

            "text": "Apoptosis is considered to be a host innate defense mechanism that disrupts viral replication by eliminating virus-infected cells. Viruses have consequently developed strategies to reduce apoptosis, which, in turn, prevents premature cell death, thereby maximizing progeny virus production [26] . In this study, we observed the use of such a strategy by PEDV. The viruses carrying an ORF3 not only grew to higher titers than the virus lacking the ORF, but their infection also caused less apoptosis, as judged by apoptotic indicators such as TUNEL labeling, translocation of phosphatidylserine from the inner to the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane and activation of caspase-3. The observations indicate inhibition of procaspase-3 activation to be the possible mechanism of ORF3 protein-mediated host cell apoptosis. On the other hand, many viruses have the ability to actively induce apoptosis to facilitate the release and dissemination of viral progeny to neighboring cells. This pro-apoptotic property is one of the cytolytic effects of viral infections causing CPE in vitro, and it supposedly plays a pathogenic role by contributing to cell damage, tissue injury, and disease severity in vivo. This process has been observed particularly in RNA viruses, including Coronaviridae [27, 28] . In addition, for PEDV, the induction of apoptotic cell death has recently been demonstrated in vitro and in vivo. The process was found to be caspase-independent but to be mediated by activation of the mitochondrial apoptosis-inducing factor [21] . While apoptosis facilitates the release of virions from infected cells, proper timing of its induction seems desirable for the virus, as a too early breakdown of the cells would reduce the time and space for its propagation. Hence, we propose that, while PEDV apparently takes advantage of the effects of cellular apoptosis, its ORF3 protein may function to delay these processes in order to extend time and space for the virus to multiply. This may be a built-in mechanism of PEDV to maximize the production of its offspring.",

Since the same or similar truncations have been found repeatedly in several independently obtained PEDV strains after serial passaging, there is an apparent selection for viruses still expressing the N-terminal part of the protein. It is tempting to speculate that this selection aims to maintain the favorable growth phenotype of the virus. Loss of the downstream C-terminal part of the protein is associated with attenuation of virulence in the natural host, suggesting that, as earlier proposed by Wang et al. [16] , the ORF3 protein's ion channel activity is associated with the virulence of PEDV. Other functions of this C-terminal part, however, such as interference with innate host immunity [29] , cannot be excluded and this warrants further research.",

Wang et al. used a siRNA approach targeting the viral sub-genomic mRNA3, which encodes the ORF3 protein to study its role in viral replication. While they did observe a strong reduction in infectious virus production for the wild type CV777 strain, no effect was detected for its attenuated derivative, which carried an ORF3 trun [16] . Though the actual effect of the siRNA treatment on mRNA3 or ORF3 protein levels was not assessed, their results were consistent with a positive role in virus production for the wild type but not for the truncated ORF3 protein. In a study by Ye et al. a Vero cell line stably expressing the wild type ORF3 protein was established [17] . Virus yields in these cells were found to be similar to those in the parental cells when infected with field strain CH/YNKM-8/2013. A clear increase in infectious virus production was, however, observed with attenuated PEDV strains CV777 and AH-M. Quite a mysterious ORF3 protein was described by Jongkaewwattana's laboratory [13, 30] . This intact ORF3 protein, named ORF3 NP12 and derived from the Chinese strain JS-2004-2, was found to block the rescue of the infectious virus when its gene was incorporated into strain PEDV AVCT12 . The rescue was, however, successful when the full-size gene was replaced by its truncated form. The inhibitory effect of ORF3 NP12 on replication, which was even observed in the context of infection by a totally different virus (porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus), was attributed to two residues (F81 and M167) which, when mutated (F81L or M167S), restored the normal phenotype. It remains puzzling, however, how the strain JS-2004-2 carrying ORF3 NP12 was able to cope with the inhibitory of effects of this ORF3 protein.",
