            "text": "Background: The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in Hong Kong posed many challenges for health promotion activities among a group of older adults with low socio-economic status (SES). With concerns that this vulnerable group could be at higher risk of contracting the disease or spreading it to others, the implementation of health promotion activities appropriate to this group was considered to be essential during the epidemic. Objectives: To assess the effectiveness of delivering a telephone health education programme dealing with anxiety levels, and knowledge and practice of measures to prevent transmission of SARS among a group of older adults with low SES. Design: Pretest/posttest design. Settings: Subjects were recruited from registered members of a government subsidized social service center in Hong Kong and living in low-cost housing estates. Participants: The eligibility criteria were: (1) aged 55 or above; (2) able to speak Cantonese; (3) no hearing impairment, and (4) reachable by telephone. Of the 295 eligible subjects, 122 older adults completed the whole study. Methods: The interviewers approached all eligible subjects by telephone during the period of 15-25 May 2003. After obtaining the participants' verbal consent, the interviewer collected baseline data by use of a questionnaire and implemented a health education programme. A follow-up telephone call was made a week later using the same questionnaire. Results: The level of anxiety was lowered (t \u00bc 3.28, po0.001), and knowledge regarding the transmission routes of droplets (po0.001) and urine and feaces (po0.01) were improved after the intervention. Although statistical significant difference was found in the practice of identified preventive measures before and after intervention, influence on behavioral changes needed further exploration. Conclusion: The telephone health education seemed to be effective in relieving anxiety and improving knowledge of the main transmission routes of SARS in this group, but not the practice of preventing SARS. Telephone contact appears to be a practical way of providing health education to vulnerable groups when face-to-face measure is not feasible and may be useful in raising health awareness during future outbreaks of emerging infections. r",

            "text": "The aging population is growing in Hong Kong, as it is elsewhere. In Hong Kong, an adult aged 55 or above is considered as an older adult because of the lowering age of retirement (Neugarten, 1996) , with approximately 21.2% (n \u00bc 1,475,000) of the total population aged 55 years or above (Hong Kong Census and Statistic Department (HKCSD), 31 December 2005) . Unlike other demographic groups in Hong Kong, literacy rates are low in this group with more than 31.2% not having undertaken any formal education. Among those who have undertaken some formal education, 39.5% completed primary schooling only (HKCSD, 26 October 2001) . In other words, only a small proportion of older adults in Hong Kong are educated above primary level. This situation presents many challenges for health promotion and disease prevention activities, as many of the usual methods of disseminating health information are not appropriate for this population. Such challenges were particularly noticeable during the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) (February-June 2003) in Hong Kong. Over the course of the outbreak, 1755 cases were reported with 300 deaths. Adults 55 years of age or older were 26.2% of the SARS cases (HKSARSEC, 2003) ; however, the age-specific mortality rate for this age demographic was about 54.5% (Leung et al., 2004) . The Hong Kong Government launched a campaign to keep the city healthy and clean. Measures to prevent the transmission of SARS related to personal hygiene and environmental sanitation were publicized daily in the media as a way to minimize infection. However, the presence of functional impairments resulting from chronic illness or knowledge deficits due to low literacy levels among the older adults may affect their understanding and perceived relevance to habitual hygiene practice. Their compliance to recommended infection control measures may be low. Thus, more concern about older adults especially those living alone was expressed by health care providers and in the media (Kong, 2003) . The non-compliance to health measures among this susceptible group could pose higher risks for contracting SARS and transmitting the virus to others once becoming a carrier. In view of this challenge, an alternative means to provide health education and support for them was considered essential to ensure the effectiveness of communicating the necessary health messages to this vulnerable group, especially during the outbreak of SARS.",

It can help provide health information and services to the public who have difficulty in accessing healthcare institutions due to physical illness, insufficient resources, environmental constraints or other reasons. E-health relies on a variety of technologies ranging from simple systems (e.g., telephone, facsimile machines) to complex systems (e.g., satellite links, and integrated services digital network). Among various types of technologies, the telephone can offer an inexpensive, convenient and simple method of delivery for health information, education and psychosocial support for older adults at home (Blixen et al., 2004; Hiltunen et al., 2005) . Ninetythree percent of the population have a telephone at home (Hong Kong Office of Telecommunications Authority, 2006, January 10) and it is also considered to be a safe measure of communication during the SARS epidemic.",

However, the mean difference between the preventive measures before and after the intervention was less than one, and therefore, the results could not reflect the actual behavioral outcomes. In fact, several factors may have affected the less frequent practice of the precau-tionary measures in the older adults. At the time of follow up, the situation of the SARS epidemic had much improved, and the practice of preventive measures such as wearing masks may not be considered necessary by the older adults. However, personal hygiene practices such as washing hands after sneezing/coughing and contact with possible contaminated materials, had shown a slight increase in frequency of practice and it may imply that these practices could have been internalized as a routine practice and sustained after the intervention. Other preventive measures as advised by the Department of Health, such as using serving spoons/chopsticks at mealtime and avoid using serving towels may not be relevant in this group because they lived alone. Changing health behavior is a complex issue and individual as well as social contextual factors need to be taken into consideration. A single telephone call may not be sufficient to influence practice, but nevertheless it served as a means of support for the elderly during such epidemic. Additional research is needed to clarify the lack of compliance to these measures, and how to influence the change of such behavior.",

It is, therefore, important that healthcare professionals understand how to deliver key health-related information to the public effectively, particularly to vulnerable groups such as older adults with low socio-economic status (SES). In contrast to the general population, older adults in Hong Kong are comparatively socially isolated and have low literacy rates. Alternative methods of disseminating essential information to older adults are important to enable them to acquire updated information and take appropriate preventive measures to maintain health. E-health is an effective method for health education and promotion and many older adults are more likely to have access to information technologies such as telephone and television. Results of the study supported that telephone health education was effective in relieving anxiety and improving knowledge of the main transmission routes of SARS in older adults, but not fostering practice of preventing SARS. Therefore, the strategy that this study used could be helpful for the future development of health education and promotion for older adults.
