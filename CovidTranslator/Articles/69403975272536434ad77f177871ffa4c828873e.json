            "text": "The availability of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) specific for the SARS-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is important for the development of both diagnostic tools and treatment of infection. A molecular characterization of nine monoclonal antibodies raised in immune mice, using highly purified, inactivated SARS-CoV as the inoculating antigen, is presented in this report. These antibodies are specific for numerous viral protein targets, and six of them are able to effectively neutralize SARS-CoV in vitro, including one with a neutralizing titre of 0.075 nM. A phylogenetic analysis of the heavy and light chain sequences reveals that the mAbs share considerable homology. The majority of the heavy chains belong to a single Ig germline V-gene family, while considerably more sequence variation is evident in the light chain sequences. These analyses demonstrate that neutralization ability can be correlated with specific murine V H -gene alleles. For instance, one evident trend is high sequence conservation in the V H chains of the neutralizing mAbs, particularly in CDR-1 and CDR-2. The results suggest that optimization of murine mAbs for neutralization of SARS-CoV infection will likely be possible, and will aid in the development of diagnostic tools and passive treatments for SARS-CoV infection.",

The whole genomes of SARS-CoV isolates, implicated in the 2003 outbreak in Toronto, have been sequenced and characterized (Marra et al., 2003; Rota et al., 2003) . Characterization of this virus continues at a phenomenal rate, and our understanding of the function of numerous viral proteins, the phylogeny of SARS-CoV, and the viral life cycle continues to grow (reviewed in Stadler et al., 2004; Eickmann et al., 2003; Thiel et al., 2003) . Currently, no effective vaccines or treatments for SARS-CoV infection are available. Until an effective vaccine is developed, the best hope for the treatment of infection and the prevention and control of future outbreaks remains the development of passive immunotherapy with SARS-CoV-specific antibodies (Holmes, 2003) . It has been suggested that protection might be afforded by passive immunotherapy with concentrated SARS-CoV-specific IgG antibodies (Li et al., 2003a) , and reports have established that infected individuals can benefit from treatment with serum from recovered patients (Pearson et al., 2003) . Recently, it was also reported that viral replication was inhibited in the lower respiratory tract of na\u00efve mice if they underwent passive immunization with neutralizing antibodies present in immune serum derived from infected mice (Subbarao et al., 2004) . A monoclonal antibody developed from a human non-immune single chain variable region (scFv) library has also been shown to neutralize SARS-CoV in vitro, strengthening the argument that passive immunotherapy with highly specific mAbs might be very effective in controlling SARS-CoV infection (Sui et al., 2004) .",

The profiles of antibody responses to SARS-CoV have been well established (Li et al., 2003a) . Analyses have also identified viral proteins that might serve as the best markers for immunological detection of infection by SARS-CoV (Tan et al., 2004; Lu et al., 2004) . Similarly, the characterization of immunogenic peptides derived from SARS-CoV structural proteins has also allowed for the identification of epitopes that are recognized by antibodies present in patient serum .

Examples include polyclonal antibodies raised against peptides and a recombinant SARS-CoV nucleoprotein (Chang et al., 2004; Lin et al., 2003) , and monoclonal antibodies raised against a SARS-CoV-derived recombinant protein fragment (Zhou et al., 2004) . Similarly, a neutralizing mAb specific for the spike protein, derived from na\u00efve human phage display libraries, has been developed and characterized (Sui et al., 2004) . Little has been published on mAbs developed to the native viral particle. The relevant immunogenetic characteristics of a panel of nine murine mAbs raised to whole SARS-CoV, six of which can effectively neutralize the virus in vitro, are presented. This development provides a distinct advantage in the search for an effective passive immune therapy, because these mAbs were raised against the intact virus, rather than any individual viral protein or immunogenic peptide.",

(H37-Ra) from Difco (BD, Oakville, ON). Thirty days later, the mice received 50 g of SARS-CoV S.C. in Freund's incomplete adjuvant (F.I.A.) in a total volume of 100 l. The mice received 5 g of the same antigen in a total volume of 100 l S.C. with F.I.A. on days 48 and 63. The mice received a final booster inoculation intraperitoneal (I.P.) with 5 g of highly purified SARS-CoV in 200 l PBS 3 days before euthanization by anesthesia overdose, spleen removal, and subsequent hybridoma fusion. After hybridoma fusion and establishment of stable clones, the hybridoma supernatants were screened via ELISA using purified SARS-CoV as the target antigen, and isotyped with a commercial murine isotyping dipstick test (Roche), facilitating the selection of appropriate primers for subsequent RT-PCR. Monoclonal antibodies were produced in medium scale in 450 and 800 cm 2 sterile disposable roller bottle flasks (Corning). Roller bottles containing 200 ml of complete hybridoma media [BD-Quantum yield (VWR, Canada), 10% fetal bovine serum (Wisent, Montreal), 10% Biogro-Hybridoma serum-free supplement (Biogro Technology, Winnipeg)] were inoculated with 50 ml of hybridoma cells such that a final concentration of more than 1 million viable cells/ml was achieved. The cultures were allowed to grow to extinction and were harvested at 7-10 days post-inoculation. Supernatants were clarified by removing cell mass by centrifugation, and concentrated on Amicon 8400 stirred cell Ultrafiltration-nitrogen concentrators (VWR, Canada) with a YM-30 (Millipore, USA) membrane. Individual membranes were used for the concentration of each mAb. The concentrated supernatants were mixed 1:1 with protein A-binding buffer (Pierce) and purified on a equilibrated 1 or 5 ml protein G-sepharose column (Amersham Biotech) as per the manufacturers instructions. Eluted antibody was dialyzed to remove salt using Centriprep YM-30 Centrifugal Filter Units (Millipore) with a 30 kDa cutoff. The mAb solutions were filter sterilized through lowprotein-binding 0.22 m syringe filters (VWR). Protein concentration was determined using the micro-bca assay (Pierce) and the IgG concentration was standardized to 1 mg/ml in sterile PBS (Gibco).",

Total RNA was isolated using RNeasy \u00ae Mini Spin kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (QIAGEN \u00ae ). cDNA was produced via reverse transcription using 10 pg to 10 g of RNA template, a 15 base oligo-dT primer and SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). Reactions were incubated at 42 \u2022 C for 1 h, followed by inactivation of the reverse transcriptase at 70 \u2022 C for 15 min. RNA was removed from the reactions by incubating them with RNaseH (Invitrogen) at 37 \u2022 C for 20 min. The resulting cDNA was used as a template for PCR amplification using Taq polymerase (Invitrogen) and various 5 and 3 primers specific for V H and V L genes and. The primers used are as follows (in 5 -3 orientation), and are described in detail elsewhere (Berry, 1999; Barbas et al., 2001; Dattamajumdar et al., 1996) . Degenerate nucleotides are indicated as follows: B = T, C, or G; D = A, T, or G; I = deoxyinosine; K = T or G; M = A or C; R = A or G; S = C or G; W = A or T; Y = C or T. PCR reactions were incubated at 94 \u2022 C for 2 min, followed by 30 cycles of 96 \u2022 C for 15 s, 56 \u2022 C for 30 s, and 72 \u2022 C for 2 min. A final extension at 72 \u2022 C for 10 min completed the reactions. Approximately 1-5 g of the PCR products were resolved on 2% agarose gels and stained with ethidium bromide. PCR products of the appropriate size (350-500 basepairs) were inserted into the Invitrogen pCR2.1-TOPO-TA TM vector and transformed into TOP-10 cells, according to the manufacturer's instructions. Colonies containing the plasmid with insert were selected by overnight growth, at 37 \u2022 C, on Luria-Bertani agar plates containing ampicillin (200 g/ml) and X-gal (80 g/ml). White (positive) colonies were incubated in 5 ml of Luria-Bertani broth containing ampicillin (200 g/ml) for 12-16 h with vigorous shaking at 37 \u2022 C, and plasmids were isolated using QIAprep \u00ae Spin Miniprep DNA isolation kits, according to the manufacturer's instructions (QIAGEN \u00ae ). EcoRI digestion of 1-5 g of the resulting plasmids and resolution of the products via agarose gel electrophoresis, as described above, confirmed the presence of the appropriately sized inserts. One to 10 putative positive clones were sequenced with T7 (5 -TAA TAC GAC TCA CTA TAG GG-3 ) and M13Rev (5 -CAG GAA ACA GCT ATG AC-3 ) primers, using ABI Prism \u00ae BigDye TM terminator cycle sequencing kits and an ABI Prism \u00ae 3100 Genetic Analyzer.

The sequences, aligned via ClustalW as described above, were analyzed via neighbor joining analysis, bootstrapped using 1000 replicates. The na\u00efve human mAb 80R (Sui et al., 2004 ; V H GenBank accession no. AAS19425; V L GenBank accession no. AAS19432) was initially used as an outlier sequence. This mAb was chosen because it is specific for the SARS-CoV spike protein and neutralizes SARS infection in vitro, but it was developed from a non-immune human sin- gle chain variable fragment (scFv) library. A second outlier, also human in origin, was found as follows. The V L and V H amino acid sequences of F26G18 were compared against the human Ig sequences in the NCBI databases using IgBlast, as described above. F26G18 was chosen because it was the most potent SARS neutralizing murine mAb isolated, and it is specific for spike. Human antibodies were chosen to ensure that similarity would be minimal, considering that mouse, and indeed human, antibodies inherently share considerable homology regardless of their specificity. The sequences that showed the lowest homology to the V H and V L sequences of F26G18 were chosen as follows: V L : GenBank accession no. BAC01727, level of identity: 83/115 amino acids; V H : GenBank accession no. CAD19025, level of identity: 83/132 amino acids. In all of the phylogenetic analyses, the human sequences clearly served as effective outliers, and only BAC01727 and CAD19025 are included in the relevant figures. Table 1 summarizes the relevant characteristics of the murine mAbs generated against highly purified, inactivated SARS-CoV. Examining the V H chains, only two Ig V-gene families are represented. Eight out of the nine mAbs share high sequence identity with the J558 V-gene family, with the remaining mAb, F26G1, sharing high sequence identity with the VOx-1 gene. Of the J558 V-gene family members, five of the eight mAbs are most closely related to the J558.50 V-gene, and this set of five mAbs neutralizes SARS-CoV in vitro. mAbs F26G6, F26G8 and F26G3 are most closely related to the J558.33 and J558.5 V-genes, respectively, which are themselves closely related to J558.50. A closer analysis of the V H chains of mAbs sharing significant homology with the J558.50 V-gene is presented in Fig. 1 and Table 2 . An alignment of the nucleotide sequences of these V H sequences reveals a very high level of identity (Fig. 1A) . Similarly, at the amino acid level, these sequences share considerable identity both amongst themselves and with the J558.50 V-gene (Fig. 1B) , with some mutation away from the germline sequence, which is typical of immunoglobulin V-gene cDNAs Level of identity (pairwise) is expressed as number of identical residues/total number of residues and percent identical residues.",

There appears to be a slight bias towards J H 4 (four mAbs) with J H 1 (three mAbs) and J H 2 (two mAbs) also represented ( Table 1) . Analysis of the CDR-3 sequences reveals that D H -regions are present in seven out of nine of the mAbs, with homology to numerous D H -gene sequences available in the databases. A detailed analysis of the D H -regions is presented in the following section. Examination of the V L chains demonstrates that a wider variety of V-genes is represented. Six distinct V-genes are present, which suggests that a larger pool of V-genes can be selected, compared to the V H chains, to produce mAbs that are specific for SARS-CoV.

Across the full length of V H , it is evident that the average level of identity is highest amongst the neutralizing mAbs, albeit by a small margin (Fig. 3A ). An examination of the V H CDRs reveals that CDR-1 and CDR-2 exhibit the highest level of sequence identity, whether subdivided into groups containing all mAbs, neutralizing mAbs, or non-neutralizing mAbs. However, this finding is most apparent when examining the neutralizing mAbs, whose CDR-1 and CDR-2 regions share 73% and 82% average sequence identity, respectively. On the other hand, CDR-3 exhibits the highest sequence variability, whether grouped into all mAbs, neutralizing mAbs, or non-neutralizing mAbs, with an average level of identity ranging from 24% to 47%. An extended CDR-3 domain is characteristic of the V H chains of the SARS-CoV neutralizing mAbs. This domain of the neutralizing mAbs contains, on an average, 12 amino acid residues, while the average amongst all of the mAbs is 10 residues (not including D-element negative clones F26G6 and G8). The CDR-3 regions of the non-neutralizing mAbs contain only five residues. The V L regions exhibit a lower average level of sequence identity, as outlined in Fig. 3B . As with the V H sequences, the highest average level of identity across the full length of the V L sequences is exhibited by the neutralizing mAbs. However, the average level of sequence identity is lower overall in the V L sequences than in the corresponding V H sequences ( Fig. 2A and compare Fig. 3A and B) . Unlike the V H sequences, there is no clear bias towards a higher level of identity in the CDRs, with all three CDRs sharing relatively low average sequence identity, regardless of the grouping of the mAbs into all, neutralizing, or non-neutralizing categories. This finding again suggests that the V L CDRs likely influence the neutralization ability of the mAbs to a lesser extent than the V H CDRs.",

Another neutralizing mAb, F26G3, clusters closer to mAbs F26G6 and F26G8, which are non-neutralizing, spikespecific mAbs. Unfortunately, the protein target of mAb F26G3 is currently unknown.

It is also clear that mAb F26G1 is least related to any of the other mAbs in this panel, occupying its own branch well separated from the rest of the mAbs. Examining the V H chains sharing the highest identity with the J558.50 V-gene, all of which are neutralizing, it is evident that a similar pattern emerges. Monoclonal antibodies F26G9/F26G10 and F26G7/F26G19 are encoded by V-genes that cluster closely together, with F26G18 occupying a divergent branch on the tree (Fig. 4B ). Essentially the same pattern emerges when examining the V L chains (Fig. 4C) , with neutralizing and spike-specific mAbs clustering in related branches, and F26G1 occupying a separate branch on the tree, illustrating that this mAb is the least related to any of the other mAbs in the panel.

Neutralization titres amongst the mAbs vary from the lowest, at 0.075 nM for F26G18, to a high of 26 nM, for F26G3. Interestingly, two of the mAbs that exhibit the highest neutralizing efficiency, F26G18 and F26G19, are specific for the spike protein (Berry et al., 2004) . As has been established conclusively, spike is required for binding of SARS-CoV to its receptor, ACE2, and mAbs that block this interaction can neutralize SARS-CoV (Li et al., 2003b; Sui et al., 2004) . These results suggest that F26G18 and F26G19 likely neutralize SARS-CoV infection by directly targeting spike, although whether the interaction between spike and its receptor is targeted specifically remains to be determined, and ongoing work to answer this question is in progress. Although five of the mAbs are confirmed to be spike-specific, three of these (F26G1, F26G6, and F26G8) are unable to neutralize SARS-CoV infection in vitro. These results suggest that this panel of mAbs recognizes a diverse set of epitopes within the spike protein, some of which are in regions of spike that are not involved in viral adhesion or other steps in the infection process. Of the panel of six neutralizing mAbs, the targets of four have not yet been identified, and work is currently underway to determine them.",

Conversely, all three CDRs of the V L chains exhibit similar levels of sequence identity, which are, on average, lower than the levels of identity in the corresponding V H regions. The variability in CDR-3 of the V H chains is therefore likely a significant contributing factor to the target specificity of these mAbs, and the V L CDRs likely influence the neutralization abil-ity of the mAbs to a lesser extent than the V H CDRs. The average length of CDR-3 also appears to influence neutralizing ability. The V H CDR-3 of the neutralizing mAbs contains more amino acids than the average number in the whole panel of mAbs, while the CDR-3 regions of the non-neutralizing mAbs contain fewer residues. Conversely, the average length of V L CDR-3 is constant. These results suggest that both the length and sequence of the V H CDR-3 influence the neutralization ability of the mAbs, most likely by determining the specificity of contact residues for key neutralizing epitopes on SARS-CoV proteins.",

            "text": "Within the group of neutralizing mAbs, a trend is evident that relates homology in the V H chains of the most potent neutralizing mAb, F26G18, with those that neutralize SARS-CoV less efficiently. The clustering of the sequences of the neutralizing mAbs based on their relatedness to F26G18 tends to correlate well with their ability to neutralize SARS-CoV in vitro. For both V H and V L , the mAb with the lowest neutralizing efficiency, F26G3, has the lowest overall sequence identity when compared to mAb F26G18, and when compared to the average sequence identity across the whole panel of neutralizing mAbs. This trend is more apparent for the V H sequences, since the percentage of identity of the V L chains relative to F26G18 is lower overall. This observation is consistent with the dominant role of V H compared to V L in previously identified neutralizing mAbs against a viral pathogen (Barbas et al., 1993) . CDR-1 and CDR-2 of the V H chains of the neutralizing mAbs are most closely related to the same regions in F26G18, while CDR-3 is less conserved. From this analysis, one can infer that high homology in V H CDR-1 and CDR-2 (relative to F26G18) of the neutralizing mAbs appears to correlate with neutralizing ability. Interestingly, F26G7 exhibits a six-fold higher neutralizing titre than F26G19, even though their sequences are closely related both to each other and to F26G18, revealing that the trend for relatedness to F26G18 correlating with neutralizing ability does not follow for all of the mAbs in this panel. This observation also suggests that small changes in the amino acid composition of these mAbs can significantly alter neutralization efficiency. Overall, this analysis clearly demonstrates that the V H regions of the neutralizing mAbs are more highly related than the V L chains, and suggests that the sequence of the V L chains plays a smaller role in neutralizing ability than the V H chains.",

The pairs F26G6/F26G8, F26G7/F26G19, and F26G9/G10 exhibit few differences at the amino acid level, within each pair. This observation could be explained in several ways. First, each pair might have originated from the same B cell progenitor and they are clonally related (Fish et al., 1989) , with the few observed sequence variations resulting from somatic mutation. Second, identical CDR-3 rearrangements might have occurred in the B cell progenitors, and antigen selection may have produced several independently rearranged but closely related B cell clones. Third and alternatively, sequence changes might have occurred during reverse transcription or PCR amplification, and the mAbs originated from the same, independently picked hybridoma clone. While these analyses do not allow a differentiation between these potential causes of this high sequence similarity, we would speculate that the first explanation is most likely true.",

This result suggests that a small pool of B cells, expressing related Ig V-genes, was selected for in response to exposure to SARS-CoV. This is not entirely surprising, considering that the J558 V-gene family is estimated to contain several hundred members in the genome of the BALB/c mouse (Livant et al., 1986 ) and this family is highly selected in murine B cells (Haines et al., 2001) . It is clear that a restricted pool of V H genes was selected to encode SARS-CoV neutralizing mAbs. A bias towards the selection of genes in the J558 V-gene family to generate autoantibodies in the tightskin mouse has also been reported (Kasturi et al., 1994) . J H gene usage is distributed relatively evenly in the mAbs generated during this work, which agrees well with the observation that J H gene usage in several murine innate antibodies belonging to the J558 V-gene family, is approximately evenly distributed (Seidl et al., 1999) . These results suggest that a typical variety of joining (J) genes is selected during the generation of V H chains in these clones. Conversely, a bias was evident in the selection of J genes in the generation of the V L chains in these clones, which agrees with published reports of preferential selection of J k 1 and J k 2 genes in adult mouse splenic cells (Wood and Coleclough, 1984; Nishi et al., 1985) . This observation suggests that the V L chains of these mAbs appear to be derived from a more diverse pool of V genes, and may be less critical for contributing contact residues, relative to V H , for binding to SARS-CoV proteins. A complete absence of D H -regions, and as a result a small CDR-3 in the V-domain, in two of the non-neutralizing, spikespecific mAbs, F26G6 and F26G8, suggests that this region contributes significantly to neutralization. The diversity of the length, sequences, and apparent order of assembly of the D H -regions present in these mAbs suggests that significant somatic alteration of sequences flanking the D H -regions occurred during junctional assembly, or that somatic mutations occurred during affinity maturation in a germinal center. The presence of identical D H elements in the CDR-3 regions of F26G7/F26G19 and F26G9/F26G10 supports the notion that these pairs are clonally related, and derived from the same parental V-gene rearrangement.",

High levels of sequence identity in CDR-1 and CDR-2 of the V H chains, compared to low levels of sequence identity in all of the V L chains, sug-gests that neutralization ability is imparted to these mAbs by contact residues within the V H chains.

The development of the mAbs reported here is an important first step in isolating mAbs generated against the intact SARS virus that could be used for passive immunotherapy. Humanization of murine mAbs is a viable method for the development of potential passive immunotherapeutics (Roguska et al., 1994; Rader et al., 1998) , and these methods can be applied to the mAbs developed in this work. One caveat to this analysis is that it is not an exhaustive statistical analysis of the relationships between the mAbs described here. Due to the small numbers of mAbs examined, only trends and general relationships regarding the levels of sequence identity between any of the mAbs and their immunological properties can be inferred. Regardless, this analysis provides a useful summary of murine mAbs that possess the potential for development into viable immune therapies and diagnostic tools for SARS-CoV infection. The recurrent usage of particular murine V-gene elements to encode virus-neutralizing antibodies is becoming more evident and detailed molecular analyses become available (Kalinke et al., 1996) . Studies with animal models are currently underway to determine the in vivo neutralization properties of the neutralizing mAbs summarized here.",
