            "text": "RNA pseudoknots have important functions, and thermodynamic stability is a key to predicting pseudoknots in RNA sequences and to understanding their functions. Traditional methods, such as UV melting and differential scanning calorimetry, for measuring RNA thermodynamics are restricted to temperature ranges around the melting temperature for a pseudoknot. Here, we report RNA pseudoknot free energy changes at 37\u00b0C measured by fluorescence competition assays. Sequence-dependent studies for the loop 1-stem 2 region reveal (1) the individual nearest-neighbor hydrogen bonding (INN-HB) model provides a reasonable estimate for the free energy change when a Watson-Crick base pair in stem 2 is changed, (2) the loop entropy can be estimated by a statistical polymer model, although some penalty for certain loop sequences is necessary, and (3) tertiary interactions can significantly stabilize pseudoknots and extending the length of stem 2 may alter tertiary interactions such that the INN-HB model does not predict the net effect of adding a base pair. The results can inform writing of algorithms for predicting and/or designing RNA secondary structures.",

A typical H-type RNA pseudoknot ( Figure 1B) is formed by two stems and two or three loops (2) . Loop 1 spans the deep major groove of stem 2, and loop 3 spans the shallow minor groove of stem 1. Loop 2, which is usually zero or one nucleotide, separates stems 1 and 2. For the formation of a pseudoknot, the lengths of the other loops have to meet some requirements (24) . Examination of the natural pseudoknots collected in Pseudo-Base (25) revealed different length distributions for each pseudoknot loop and stem (26) .",

Most such computational approaches use a nearest-neighbor model (39, 40) for predicting the stabilities of stems 1 and 2. This is coupled with various models for the free energy contribution from the loops (26, 41, 42) . In these models, the contributions from tertiary interactions between loops and stems are neglected.

For the unimolecular transitions of a pseudoknot, however, both rely on data acquired near the melting temperatures and on deconvoluting overlapping transitions. Here, we use two versions of fluorescence competition assays (FCA) (51) (52) (53) to measure the free energies at 37\u00b0C for a series of pseudoknots derived from the beet western yellow virus (BWYV) H-type pseudoknot (Figure 1 ), which is important for frameshifting (54) . One method uses fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) which has been previously used to determine the free energy of nucleic acid duplexes, in which a fluorescence donor and acceptor are linked to the oligonucleotides (53) . The second method uses quenching directly by the RNA rather than by an added acceptor. The results are compared to previous thermodynamic measurements (44, 45) , to predictions using various computational models, and to expectations from the crystal structure [Protein Data Bank (PDB) entry 437D (55) ]. To test computational pseudoknot free energy models, which neglect tertiary interactions, mutations address the loop 1-stem 2 region which has no tertiary interactions beyond the joint of stems 1 and 2 ( Figure 1B ).",

FRET-based titration assays have been used to directly detect free energy differences between a \"reference\" structure and a related \"test\" structure of DNA, which allows calculation of the free energy for the test structure (53) . Figure 2A illustrates the application of this method for measuring the free energy of an RNA pseudoknot. The pseudoknot (P) is labeled with fluorescein at the 3 0 end and acts as the FRET donor strand. The fluorescence intensity for the pseudoknot at 10 nM in 250 \u03bcL of standard melting buffer is measured and used as the starting point of the titration. In comparison to the BWYV pseudoknot reported elsewhere (44, 45) , which is named 437D PSK ( Figure 1B ), there is a GC dangling 3 0 end here (Figure 2A ), so the fluorescein is not directly adjacent to the pseudoknot. This construct is called PSK 1. The free energy contribution for this dangling 3 0 end was measured by melting the model duplexes 5 0 CUGGC/3 0 FCGGACCG and 5 0 CUGGC/3 0 GACCG, where F is fluorescein. To measure the free energy change for the formation of PSK 1, a strand was designed to be Watson-Crick complementary to the sequence at the 3 0 end of the pseudoknot so that its binding could compete with formation of stem 2 and thus unfold the pseudoknot. This strand was labeled with a quencher (Iowa Black FQ) to serve as an acceptor and named competitor 1. Titrations were performed in 1.0 M NaCl, 20 mM sodium cacodylate, and 0.5 mM Na 2 EDTA, at pH 6.0, 7.0, or 8.0. Aliquots of a mixture of the concentrated acceptor strand and 10 nM donor strand were added to a 10 nM donor strand solution, so the donor concentration remains constant. Aliquots were added until the fluorescence intensity remained constant within experimental error. There were typically 10 points (at least seven points) in the titration curves, from point zero to saturation. In this process, the competitor strand will break the pseudoknot and form a reference structure, whose free energy can be predicted with the INN-HB model (39) combined with hairpin loop (60) and dangling end (61, 62) free energy parameters (see the Supporting Information).",

Thus, a fluorescence competition assay does not require a non-nucleotide quencher. This permits a fluorescence competition assay in which only the short competition strand is labeled, which is more economical than synthesizing fluorescently labeled pseudoknots ( Figure 2B ). In this case, the equilibrium is forced to shift to the reference structure with an increase in the pseudoknot concentration. The free energy of this reference structure can be calculated by combination of optical melting results with duplex 5 0 GAACAAACGG/3 0 AACUUGUUUGF (Table 1) Because the 5 0 end dangling GG used for crystallography is not related to the competition and it is expected to stabilize stem 1 of the pseudoknot by only 0.4 kcal/mol (61, 62, 64) , it was eliminated to give the construct called PSK 2 ( Figure 2B ). Note, however, that the 5 0 nucleotide is labeled C3 to match with the 437D PSK numbering in Figure 1B .",

Figure 5 summarizes the mutations. Except for PSK-CG, 5 0 FGUUU-GUUC3 0 was the competition strand, i.e., the same as for PSK 2. For PSK-CG, the competition strand was 5 0 FCGUUUGUUC3 0 , to allow saturated binding at convenient concentrations of the pseudoknot. Table 2 lists the measured \u0394G 37 0 values for the transition from pseudoknot to hairpin (PSK-HP) and from unfolded RNA to pseudoknot (PSK), along with predictions by the statistical polymer model (SPM) of Cao and Chen (42) and the NUPACK model (33) . The value of \u0394G 37,PSK-HP 0 shows the relative stability of the pseudoknot to the stem 1 hairpin, which is important for the function of many pseudoknots (18, 27, 30, 31) . Some mutations make the free energy of the pseudoknot more favorable, but it may not make the pseudoknot more stable relative to the corresponding hairpin and vice versa. Table 2 also lists the changes (\u0394\u0394G 37 0 ) of \u0394G 37 0 for the transitions due to mutations to PSK 2. This provides insight into the effects of different factors on pseudoknot stability.",

For both, the concentration of the pseudoknot required for the titration can be manipulated by altering the sequence and length of the competition strand. They both can work at nanomolar oligonucleotide concentrations, which allows studies of sequence dependence with only small quantities of RNA and avoids potential problems from intermolecular interactions of the pseudoknot sequences. The FCA/DA method provides a large change in fluorescence intensity, and the concentration of pseudoknot RNA remains the same during the titration. That can avoid some complications due to possible intermolecular interactions. The FCA/DA method, however, requires the synthesis of pseudoknot RNA with a fluorescent tag, which makes the experiment more expensive. In FCA, the concentration of pseudoknot RNA can be as high as hundreds of nanomolar, but it does not require fluorescent modification of the pseudoknot. Thus, the pseudoknot can be made by either chemical synthesis or T7 transcription (66) .",

The 437D PSK thermodynamics have been measured by Nixon and Giedroc using UV melting and DSC (44) and by Soto et al. using UV melting (45). Nixon and Giedroc conducted the measurement in 0.5 M K \u00fe buffer (pH 6.0, 7.0, and 8.0) with a pseudoknot concentration of 34.8 \u03bcM. Soto et al. used 0.5 M Na \u00fe buffer (pH 7.0) with \u223c1.8 \u03bcM pseudoknot and reported their results for \u0394H 0 and T m , which allows \u0394G 37 0 to be calculated from the relation \u0394G 37 0 = \u0394H 0 -310.15\u0394H 0 /T m . Both groups obtained their thermodynamics from deconvoluting UV melting or DSC curves with overlapping transitions. They assign the melting curves in the same way, i.e., as three two-state transitions in the thermal denaturation: F f PK f S1 f U, where F is a completely folded pseudoknot, including tertiary interactions, PK is the secondary structure of the pseudoknot, S1 is the stem 1 hairpin corresponding to the pseudoknot, and U is the completely unfolded pseudoknot. The sum of the first two transitions (F f PK f S1) corresponds to the 437D PSK-HP transition measured here. The sum of \u0394G 37 0 for the F f PK and PK f S1 transitions is listed under \u0394G 37 0 for the 437D PSK-HP transition in Table 3 . As Soto et al. stated, there are \u223c10\u00b0C differences in the melting temperatures for both the F f PK and PK f S1 transitions between the two reports, which could be due to the different cations (67-69). This produces a difference of 1.6 kcal/mol in \u0394G 37,PSK-HP 0 between the measurements of the two groups. The sequence and secondary structure of the oligonucleotides are shown in Figure 5 . All the measurements were conducted by FCA, in 1.0 M NaCl, 20 mM sodium cacodylate, and 0.5 mM Na 2 EDTA (pH 7.0). b See the Supporting Information for predictions of hairpin stability. c The error from the FCA experiment is within (0.01 kcal/mol. d In SPM and NUPACK predictions, it is assumed that U13 forms a Watson-Crick base pair with A25 and coaxially stacks with the G7-C14 base pair (see the Supporting Information for calculations).",

While the error limits on \u0394H T 0 do not allow a reliable value for \u0394C p 0 to be determined, linear least-squares fittings of listed \u0394H T 0 values versus T m at 40, 74, 120, 204, and 504 mM Na \u00fe for F f PK (T m range of 48-67\u00b0C), PK f S1 (T m range of 63-84\u00b0C), and S1 f U (T m range of 81-92\u00b0C) transitions provide \u0394C p 0 estimates of -700, -300, and -20 cal K -1 mol -1 for unfolding, respectively (Supporting Information). If these \u0394C p 0 values are included, then the average \u0394G 37 0 calculated by eq 26 for the PSK-HP transition from UV melting and DSC experiments in 0.5 M Na \u00fe or K \u00fe buffer will be less favorable by 1.4 kcal/mol relative to the average \u0394G 37 0 without considering \u0394C p 0 values. However, for the S1 f U transition, the \u0394G 37 0 difference with \u0394C p 0 considered is within 0.1 kcal/mol of that without considering \u0394C p 0 . There are a number of other possible reasons for differences in absolute values for \u0394G 37 0 determined by fluorescence competition and thermal melting. Nevertheless, the increments determined by any particular method for changes in sequence or conditions should be reliable at the temperature at which the experiment was conducted.",

Using the \u0394H 0 and T m obtained by fitting of the three thermal denaturation curves for this transition from UV melting and DSC experiments (44, 45) produced values of -8.3, -7.8, and -8.4 kcal/mol giving an average of -8.2 kcal/mol at 37\u00b0C, consistent with the estimate from the INN-HB model (Table 3) . Both calculations ignore any \u0394C p 0 contributions, but both rely on measurements of hairpins with T m values of >60\u00b0C (44, 45, 72, 73) . Moreover, when the \u0394H 0 values obtained at different salt concentrations and therefore T m values (45) are plotted versus T m , the apparent \u0394C p 0 is -20.4 cal K -1 mol -1 , which is negligible. The NUPACK program used the INN-HB model and also predicted a \u0394G 37 0 of -8.2 kcal/mol for the stem 1 hairpin by using the latest version of free energy parameters (39, (60) (61) (62) . The heuristic program, Kinefold (37), estimates the free energy of the stem 1 hairpin as -7.3 kcal/mol, which is 0.9 kcal/mol less favorable than the values from the current INN-HB model and experiments.",

For calculating the free energy of a pseudoknot (see the Supporting Information), both the SPM (42) and NU-PACK (33) models consider that stem free energies are one of the main contributions, and they are estimated by the INN-HB model (39) . Both models consider that the loops make unfavorable contributions to the free energy of the pseudoknot. The NUPACK model, however, counts a penalty for initiating the pseudoknot, then assigns penalty values to each base in the loop without considering loop sequence or position, and assigns penalty values to each base pair that borders the interior of the pseudoknot, without considering the base pair type, loop-stem correlation, or tertiary interactions. Similar to Aalberts' model (26) , but with volume exclusion considered, SPM calculates the entropies for the loops with a statistical mechanical polymer model that treats loops 1 and 3 differently and takes the entropies (\u0394S loops 0 ) as a penalty. Conformational states allowed by different lengths of stems and loops were considered. Also, the entropy for assembling the stem-loop motifs (\u0394S assemble 0 ) is counted as a penalty. As with the NUPACK model, loop sequence and tertiary interactions are not included. The two models predict a similar free energy for 437D PSK ( Table 3 ). The predictions are very close to the results from FCA/DA and FCA experiments. The models predict 437D PSK is not as stable at 37\u00b0C as measured by UV melting and DSC, however. Kinefold predicts the pseudoknot is even less stable than these models and the FCA/DA and FCA results. (47) . This could be tested by mutations that change only the nearest neighbors without changing tertiary interactions.",

The FCA experiment, however, shows free energy changes of -0.6 and 0.4 kcal/mol, respectively, from this additional base pair. In the two cases, the additional base pair is less stabilizing by 2.7 and 2.8 kcal/mol, respectively, than expected. One uncertainty in this comparison is the prediction of \u0394G 37 0 for the hairpin in the RS2 complex (see the Supporting Information). This prediction is not likely wrong by more than 1 kcal/mol, however. Similar to the hypothesis from Theimer et al. (47) , a likely explanation for the difference between prediction and experiment is induced conformational changes. In an A-type RNA helix, a base pair twists the end of the duplex by 33.1\u00b0 (74) . As calculated by the polymer model of Aalberts and Hodas (26) , the distance between G7 and C9e/U9e ( Figure 5 ) through the major groove of stem 2 in PSK-CG and PSK-UA is the same as the distance between G7 and C10 in BWYV PSK 2. Therefore, nucleotides in loop 1 have to twist to connect G7 and C9e or U9e in PSK-CG or PSK-UA, respectively. That could affect the tertiary interactions among C8, G12, A25, and C26 ( Figure 1B,C) , which stabilize the BWYV pseudoknot as much as -3.1 kcal/mol at 37\u00b0C (75) , and therefore destabilize the pseudoknot. From FCA measurements, the penalty for breaking this tertiary interaction is \u223c2.8 kcal/mol at 37\u00b0C. Evidently, loop size and tertiary interactions play an important role in pseudoknot stability.",

The crystal structure shows U13 flipping out without forming a base pair with A25, while there is a complicated tertiary interaction among C8, G12, C26, A25, and C14 ( Figure 1B,C) . Therefore, the nearest neighbors will be affected because some hydrogen bonds and base stacking are lost in the structure. In predictions, U13 and A25 are paired and their nearest-neighbor free energy parameters for stacking with the G12-C26 base pair and for coaxial stacking with the G7-C14 base pair contribute to the predicted free energy. If these stacks are not included, then the pseudoknot will be predicted not to form, and only the stem 1 hairpin will be predicted to form. The predictions agree with the FCA/DA and FCA measurements, however. Apparently, the tertiary interactions compensate for the free energy loss from not forming a U13-A25 base pair. Alternatively, crystallization may trap one of two or more structures present in solution.",

While SPM (42) and NUPACK (33) use different models to estimate the penalty for pseudoknot loops, they both gave reasonable approximations for 437D PSK (Tables 2 and 3 ). To test the models further, the length of loop 1 was changed. Loop 1 was lengthened with different nucleotides to produce PSK-4A, PSK-4C, and PSK-4C-C9 ( Figure 5 and Table 2 ). As Table 2 shows, increasing the size of loop 1 destabilized the pseudoknot, as predicted by SPM and NU-PACK. The measured \u0394\u0394G 37,PSK-4A 0 and \u0394\u0394G 37,PSK-4C 0 are 1.1 and 1.4 kcal/mol, respectively, close to the predictions of 1.0 kcal/mol for either of them by SPM. The mutations are slightly more destabilizing than the NUPACK predictions of 0.4 kcal/mol for either of them. Again, the comparisons depend on the predicted \u0394G 37 0 for the hairpin in the RS2 complex (see the Supporting Information).",

The difference may reflect an unfavorable free energy for formation of loop 1 with all C's. Hairpin loops with oligo-C sequences are unusually unstable (60, 76) . Hairpin loops of C 3 and C 6 are \u223c1.5 and \u223c3.4 kcal/mol, respectively, less stable at 37\u00b0C than other hairpin loops with the same number of nucleotides. Some of this destabilization may reflect the extra free energy required to unstack C's, e.g., \u223c0.3 kcal/mol more at 37\u00b0C for poly-C than for poly-A (77) . The FCA results suggest that there may also be an oligo-C effect for the free energy for pseudoknot loops. In PSK-4C-C9, loop 1 is formed by six C's and its free energy is \u223c1 kcal/mol less favorable than the free energy of PSK-4A or PSK-4C. This penalty is different from the penalty for a C 6 hairpin loop but similar to the penalty for a C 3 hairpin. Obviously, the C 6 hairpin loop and C 6 pseudoknot loop 1 have different conformations. A penalty of 1.0 kcal/mol is assigned to C 6 pseudoknot loop 1. If this penalty is counted in SPM, then the SPM prediction will be closer to the FCA result. The results suggest that the SPM statistical model, which includes size exclusion effects, gives good agreement between predictions and experiments for loop 1.",

The nearest-neighbor model in the stems predicts \u0394G 37,PSK-4A-U11A27 0 -\u0394G 37,PSK-4A 0 to be 1.4 kcal/mol, and the SPM predicts \u0394G 37,PSK-4A-U11A27 0 -\u0394G 37,PSK-U11A27 0 to be \u223c1.0 kcal/mol. The FCA experiments for mutation from PSK-4A and PSK-U11A27 to PSK-4A-U11A27 give \u0394\u0394G 37 0 values of -1.1 and -1.2 kcal/mol, respectively. This is surprising because the mutations make the pseudoknot more stable rather than less stable as expected. The deviation could come from additional tertiary interactions between one or more A's in loop 1 and the UA pair in stem 2. For example, an A 3 A-U base triple with the non-Watson-Crick A in the major groove is possible (78, 79) . Another new interaction perhaps facilitated by the increased flexibility of an A-U compared to a G-C pair is also possible. That suggests again that stem-loop tertiary interactions can be a large factor for the free energy of a pseudoknot.",

            "text": "Model for Pseudoknot Free Energy Estimation. The sequence dependence of stabilities for modified BWYV pseudoknots provides insight into several factors important for predictions. (1) The INN-HB model can be used to estimate the free energy contribution from stem 2 if tertiary interactions are not involved. Because the crystal structure of the BWYV pseudoknot indicates that stem 2 has a propeller twist that deviates more from A-form than stem 1, this suggests that the INN-HB model will also work the same way for stem 1. (2) As reported previously (44, 75) , tertiary interactions between the stem and loop are a major contributor to pseudoknot free energy. For example, a possible newly formed A 3 A-U base triple in the stem 2-loop 1 region in PSK-4A-U11A27 could stabilize the pseudoknot by -2.2 kcal/mol. In the BWYV pseudoknot, the structure in the joint part of the stem 1-loop 3 region and stem 2-loop 1 region is \"distorted\" and an expected base pair with coaxial stacking in the secondary structure is therefore absent. The free energy loss for this distortion, however, can be compensated by the tertiary interactions ( Figure 1C ). Thus, in the absence of structural information and thermodynamic parameters for tertiary interactions, it is reasonable to include possible base pairs and coaxial stacking at the joint in predicting the free energy of a pseudoknot. These interactions are possible, so their absence implies that the tertiary interactions must be even more favorable. ( 3) The statistical polymer model (SPM) provides excellent approximations for the length dependence of loop 1. There will also be sequence dependence, however, which is not dependent on tertiary interactions. For example, oligo-C loops are unusually unstable.",
