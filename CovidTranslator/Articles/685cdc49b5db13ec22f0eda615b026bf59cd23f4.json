As 14 mutation rates are tightly and negatively correlated with genome size, selection is a clear 15 driver of viral evolution. However, the role of intragenomic interactions as drivers of 16 viral evolution is still unclear. To understand how these two processes affect the long-17 term evolution of viruses infecting humans, we comprehensively analyzed ssRNA, ssDNA, 18 dsRNA, and dsDNA viruses, to find which virus types and which functions show evidence 19 for episodic diversifying selection and correlated evolution. We show that selection mostly 20 affects single stranded viruses, that correlated evolution is more prevalent in DNA viruses, 21 and that both processes, taken independently, mostly affect viral replication. However, 22 the genes that are jointly affected by both processes are involved in key aspects of their life 23 cycle, favoring viral stability over proliferation. We further show that both evolutionary 24 processes are intimately linked at the amino acid level, which suggests that it is the 25 joint action of selection and correlated evolution, and not just selection, that shapes the 26 evolutionary trajectories of viruses -and possibly of their epidemiological potential.",

However, while 34 the evolutionary dynamics of RNA viruses are well documented Holmes (2009), those of 35 other viruses are not so well known, in particular in a unifying context including major 36 viral types such as double-stranded (ds) and single-stranded (ss) DNA and RNA viruses.",

As already argued, both ssDNA and ssRNA viruses share small genome 43 sizes, high mutation rates, but also large effective population sizes, little to no gene dupli-44 cation or recombination, and overlapping reading frames Holmes (2009). This last point 45 suggests that a less frequently explored evolutionary process in viral studies, correlated 46 evolution, could be as critical as positive selection. Correlated evolution happens when 47 mutations at two locations in a genome occur one after the other, in a quick succession 48 Kryazhimskiy et al. (2011), repeatedly Maddison and FitzJohn (2015). Typical examples 49 include drug resistance mutations that have a fitness cost, and that require a second mu-50 tation to compensate for the first one Gong et al.

As such, correlated 56 evolution can help us understand the relationship between genotype and fitness, which 57 is a key determinant of evolutionary trajectories Li et al. (2016). To date however, cor-58 related evolution has only sporadically been investigated in viral evolution, and these 59 rare instances only focused on ssRNA viruses. Indeed, recent work uncovered pervasive 60 evidence for correlated evolution in influenza viruses Nshogozabahizi et al. (2017); Lyons 61 and Lauring (2018), and both the Zika Aris-Brosou et al. (2017) and the Ebola viruses 62 Ibeh et al. (2016). Intriguingly, in this latter case (Ebola), evidence was found that sites 63 evolving in a correlated manner could also be under positive selection -bearing the ques-64 tion as to how frequently these two processes, correlated evolution and positive selection, 65 occur, possibly jointly, and if this co-occurrence is limited to ssRNA viruses, or can be 66 generalized to all viruses. 67 To better understand the role of correlated evolution and positive selection in the 68 evolutionary dynamics of viruses infecting humans, we constructed a nearly exhaustive 69 viral data set spanning all dsDNA, dsRNA, ssRNA, and ssDNA viruses deposited in 70 GenBank (as of August 2017), and conducted an extensive survey of correlated evolution 71 and diversifying selection in these viruses, asking more specifically about the prevalence of 72 these two processes in each viral type, independently or jointly, with the specific hypothesis 73 that the genes affected by both processes encode functions that are most critical to each 74 viral life cycle.",

While dsDNA viruses had the largest and the most variable 161 genome lengths, ssDNA were the smallest genomes by at least an order of magnitude, 162 with both dsRNA and ssRNA exhibiting intermediate sizes (Figure 1a). Because of the 163 compact structure of these genomes, these differences were also reflected in the number of 164 genes, protein-coding genes, and RNAs encoded by the genomes of these viruses (Figure 165 S2). In turn, these characteristics suggest that with their large genomes, dsDNA viruses 166 potentially have a higher degree of functional redundancy than ssDNA or even ssRNA 167 viruses, possibly due to duplication events Gao et al.

Again, diversity is not driving these differences, as both dsDNA / ssDNA193 and dsRNA / ssRNA have significantly different levels of diversity (Figure S3). As a 194 result, the prevalence of correlated evolution seems to be mostly driven by the nature of 195 viral genetic material. At least two processes can underpin correlated evolution: linkage 196 and epistasis Dench et al. (2019). As recombination is pervasive in some dsDNA viruses 197 Robinson et al. (2011), linkage alone may not explain the high prevalence of correlated 198 evolution in DNA viruses (close to 40%: Figure 1c). Rather, this pattern suggests that 199 intragenic constraints are higher in DNA viruses for unknown structural reasons, maybe protein structure Woo et al. (2014), or in the same way that recombination in RNA 201 viruses may be driven by mechanistic constraints associated with genome structures and 202 viral life cycles Simon-Loriere and Holmes (2011) . 203 While previous work showed that both diversifying selection and correlated evolution 204 can affect the same gene and even the same site in a viral genome such as Ebola's Ibeh 205 et al. (2016), a ssRNA virus, the generality of this association is still unknown. At the gene 206 level, we found strong heterogeneity among all four viral types for gene numbers showing 207 evidence for selection, correlated evolution or both (X 2 = 206.54, df = 6, P < 2.2\u00d710 \u221216 ). 208 Surprisingly, ssRNA viruses are those that show the least overlap between selection and 209 correlated evolution, with only 11% of the genes evolving under both mechanisms (Figure 210 1d). Patterns are however much more difficult to extract here, mostly because the number 211 of genes involved becomes quite small, in particular for the virus type with most overlap, 212 the dsRNA viruses (Figure 1d: 29.4%, i.e. five genes). 213 To assess the extent to which some of these differences at the gene level are function-214 ally driven, we extracted the Gene Ontology (GO) annotations, or GO terms, associated 215 with the genes analyzed, as well as those under selection, correlated evolution, or both -216 focusing exclusively on the virus types for which we had the largest samples sizes, dsDNA 217 and ssRNA viruses (Figure 1e). Each of the three parts of the ontology (Molecular Func-218 tion [MF], Biological Process [BP], and Cellular Component [CC]) were first limited to 219 the second level of GO in order to derive a high-level interpretation (low-level descriptions 220 are shown in Tables S1-S3).

(2013) and the Ebola Ibeh et al. (2016) viruses (both 242 cases involved a glycoprotein required for cell entry). Because these two evolutionary 243 processes are required by epistasis, it is possible that the genes involved in viral stability 244 are the most likely to show evidence for non-additive fitness effects -and hence, shape 245 viral fitness landscapes. This tension between replication and stability is evocative of the 246 existence of tradeoffs between capsid stability and proliferation within a host De Paepe 247 and Taddei (2006), or fecundity and lifespan Garc\u00eda-Villada and Drake (2013) in dsDNA 248 viruses, which supports the idea that it is the joint action of selection and of correlated 249 evolution that shapes viral life histories. Strength of evidence for sites under both selection (MEME) and correlated evolution (SM). (a) SM sites that are also under episodic diversifying selection. (b) MEME sites that are also evolving in a correlated manner. In both cases, the posterior probability of a site evolving in a correlated manner is plotted as a function of the P -value of a site being under selection (on a \u2212 log 10 scale). Regular least-square regressions are shown in blue; robust regressions are shown in red; 95% confidence envelopes are shaded in grey. See text for statistical details. Density scale: from low (cool colors) to high (warm colors). The previous analyses were at the gene level. One outstanding question is whether 251 this relationship between selection and correlated evolution also holds at the amino acid 252 level, that is, if the amino acids under selection are also involved in correlated evolution. 253 This question was addressed in two different ways, all virus types confounded (in order 254 to have larger sample sizes), by focusing on one process at a time, and finding at what 255 point evidence supporting the second process becomes significant. First, we searched the 256 list of pairs of sites evolving in a correlated manner (the SM sites) to see if at least one 257 pair member was potentially evolving under episodic diversifying selection (the MEME 258 sites), irrespective of its probability of being a MEME site. For this, we identified pairs 259 of SM sites, that is those with a posterior probability \u2265 0.95, and plotted their posterior 260 probability as a function of the \u2212 log 10 probability of each pair member to be under 261 selection (Figure 2a). Both the least-square (\u03c1 slope = 0.005, t = 3.90, P = 0.0001) and 262 the robust regressions (\u03c1 slope = 0.005, t = 2.62, P = 0.0089) have positive and significant diversifying selection at the amino acid level -even if most of the SM sites 265 show weak evidence of selection (at P \u2264 0.01, gray broken line in Figure 2a). So, to 266 validate the existence of this relationship, we then took the list of MEME sites, and 267 searched the list of SM sites to see if at least one pair member was potentially a MEME 268 site, irrespective of its posterior probability of being in an SM site pair. For this, we 269 identified the MEME sites, that is those with a P -value \u2264 0.01 (\u2265 2 on a \u2212 log 10 scale), 270 and plotted this (on the x-scale) vs. their posterior probability of being in an SM pair (on 271 the y-scale; Figure 2b). Both the least-square (\u03c1 slope = 0.026, t = 3.64, P = 0.0003) and 272 the robust regressions (\u03c1 slope = 0.031, t = 3.37, P = 0.0008) have positive and significant 273 slopes, further confirming the existence of a relationship between correlated evolution and 274 episodic diversifying selection at the amino acid site level. Note however that this latter 275 analysis is more informative than the former, as the density also shows that most of the 276 sites under selection are involved in weak interactions. This is intriguingly reminiscent 277 of the involvement of weakly interacting pairs of sites in severe outbreaks or pandemics 278 Aris-Brosou et al.",

Although some of these viruses could be segmented or not, with circular or linear genome, with positive or negative strands, and with or without overlapping reading frames, accounting for these structural features would have led to smaller and smaller data sets, precluding any statistical analysis, so that the data were not split beyond viral type. Each list contained the virus names, the length of 84 their genome, their number of protein-coding genes (CDS's), and was associated with a reference coding sequence (see query sequences.zip at https://github.com/sarisbro).In order to obtain corresponding sequence alignments of orthologous genes, BLASTn searches were performed on a custom database limited to viral genes present in NCBI nucleotide database with blast-2.6.0+. For this, all gbvrl*.seq.gz files were downloaded from ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/genbank while querying viruSITE, and were concatenated into 90 a single GenBank file, then converted into a FASTA file with readseq to specifically extract CDS'sGilbert (2003). This was done to avoid retrieving 5' and 3' untranslated regions that would cause problems to the downstream codon analyses. BLASTn searches were performed for each viruSITE viral sequence with a stringent E-value threshold of 10 \u2212100 , keeping a maximum of 100 sequences with at least 80% coverage with each query; this ensured that subtype / genotype / clade boundaries were not crossed. As the viruses retrieved from the viruSITE also included viruses that require a vector (e.g., arboviruses such as the Dengue and Yellow fever viruses), or viruses that circulate in non-human hosts but that can lead to zoonoses (e.g., the Camel alphacoronavirus leading to MERS",
