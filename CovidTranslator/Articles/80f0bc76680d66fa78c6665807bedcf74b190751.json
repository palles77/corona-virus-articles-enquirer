This disease manifests as a decreased blood cell count and multi-organ failure, with a case-fatality rate of more than 12% in China. Because vaccines or antiviral drugs for the treatment of this disease are not available, monitoring the SFTS circulation in animals and controlling the tick-mammal cycle are important for preventing SFTS. Monoclonal antibodies against the recombinant nucleoprotein of SFTSV were generated to develop a competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (cELISA) for the detection of antibodies against SFTSV infection in cattle. The specificity and sensitivity of cELISA was assessed by comparing the results of this assay to those of an immunofluorescence assay (IFA). The results of the cELISA using 416 field bovine serum samples and laboratory-immunized positive sera showed 98.1% consistency with those of the IFA. The cELISA used in this study did not show cross-reactivity with antisera against other viral cattle diseases. The cELISA presented in this study can be applied to detect antibodies against SFTSV in cattle.",

The pathogen responsible for SFTS is the SFTS virus (SFTSV), a novel Phlebovirus in the family Bunyaviridae [21] . This virus contains three RNA genome segments coated with nucleoprotein (NP) that are encapsulated in an 80-to 120 nm diameter glycoprotein viral envelope [21, 24] . Since the first report of human SFTS in central China, additional cases have been reported continuously in other parts of China, Korea, and Japan [17, 25, 26] . In 2013, 36 patients were diagnosed with SFTS, and the fatality rate of this disease was 47.2% in Korea [6, 12] .",

In addition, seropositive shrews and rodents were recently implicated as potential animal hosts susceptible to SFTSV [9] . A study in Korea showed that SFTSV-positive ticks are widespread throughout most provinces, particularly during summer [13] .

The cELISA cutoff value was subsequently calculated using the mean inhibition rate of the IFA-negative population \u00b1 3S.D. (cutoff PI = 49.5%). Using this cut-off, 99.8% of the IFA-negative bovine serum samples were also considered to be negative in the cELISA. Although the newly developed cELISA is highly specific, more field animals infected with SFTSV would need to be measured to improve the sensitivity.",

Serological diagnostic methods are necessary to test large numbers of animals. While the cELISA developed in the present study requires additional tests to validate its performance, the results observed to date are promising. Further studies to adapt this diagnostic technique to a broad spectrum of animal species are currently in progress.",
