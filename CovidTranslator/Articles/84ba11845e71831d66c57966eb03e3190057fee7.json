Selectivity and cytotoxicity studies established a more than 100-fold preference for the coronaviral enzyme over homologous human deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs), and no significant cytotoxicity in Vero E6 and HEK293 cell lines is observed. X-ray structural analyses of inhibitor-bound crystal structures revealed subtle differences between binding modes of the initial benzodioxolane lead (15g) and the most potent analogues 3k and 3j, featuring a monofluoro substitution at para and meta positions of the benzyl ring, respectively. Finally, the less lipophilic bis(amide) 3e and methoxypyridine 5c exhibit significantly improved metabolic stability and are viable candidates for advancing to in vivo studies.",

            "text": "More than 10 years after the pandemic caused by the SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) coronavirus (CoV), no anticoronaviral regimens have been developed for the treatment of SARS-CoV or any other human coronaviruses (HCoV) infection. SARS-CoV was established as the causative agent of the fatal global outbreak of respiratory disease in humans during 2002\u22122003 that resulted in a case-fatality rate (CFR) of 11%. 1 In October 2012, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) added SARS-CoV to the select agents list of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). Among many aspects that make SARS-CoV a potential threat to the human population, the lack of effective vaccines or anticoronaviral drugs had a significant impact in its classification as a select agent. However, even with the most extensive preventive measures, the reemergence of SARS-CoV or other virulent human coronaviruses poses a continuing threat. A powerful reminder of this, as well as of the fatal repercussions of the interspecies transmission potential of CoVs, was brought to the forefront in September 2012 by the emergence of a new SARSlike respiratory virus (previously termed HCoV-EMC, now designated Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, MERS-CoV). 2, 3 As in the case of SARS-CoV, the MERS-CoV is likely of zoonotic origin 4 and closely related to bat coronaviruses from the Betacoronavirus genus (group 2). 5 Reminiscent of the initial stages of SARS-CoV pandemic, global travel has contributed to the spread of MERS coronavirus, with a total of 178 laboratory-confirmed cases and a CFR of 43%. 6 The infected individuals display SARS-like symptoms, including a severe respiratory infection (SRI), and sometimes exhibit an acute renal failure which is a unique signature of MERS infection. 2b,7 Today, a total of 6 human coronaviruses are known, of which SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are recognized as highly pathogenic with the potential for human-to-human transmission. 8 Without an efficacious antiviral agent or vaccine, the prevention of current and emerging coronaviruses continues to rely strongly on public health measures to contain outbreaks. Therefore, research toward the development of anticoronaviral drugs continues to be of paramount importance.",

            "text": "The development of anticoronaviral drugs is challenging. Although a number of coronaviral proteins have been identified as potential drug targets, 9 further development of drug candidates has been compromised by the general lack of antiviral data and biological evaluations, which can be done only in BSL-3 facilities with select agent certification for laboratories in the U.S. Two of the most promising drug targets are the SARS-CoV-encoded cysteine proteases, 3CLpro (chymotrypsin-like protease) and PLpro (papain-like protease). PLpro, in addition to playing an essential role during virus replication, is proposed to be a key enzyme in the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV. The well-established roles of PLpro enzymatic activities include processing of the viral polyprotein, 10 deubiquitination 11 (the removal of ubiquitin), and deISGylation 12 (the removal of ISG15) from host-cell proteins. These last two enzymatic activities result in the antagonism of the host antiviral innate immune response. 13 The SARS-CoV PLpro inhibitors (compounds 24 14 and 15g,h 15 ), previously identified in our lab via high-throughput screening (HTS), have low micromolar inhibitory potency with minimal associated cytotoxicity in SARS-CoV-infected Vero E6 cells and are therefore viable leads for the development of drug candidates ( Figure 1 ). Detailed reports of the synthesis and biological evaluation of inhibitors 24 14 and 15g 15 and their X-ray structures in complex with SARS-CoV PLpro have been previously described.",

            "text": "Compounds 24, 15h, and 15g share a number of chemical and structural features (Figure 1 ), including the presence of a naphthyl group adjacent to a stereogenic center containing a methyl group and a nitrogen-centered hydrogen bond (Hbond) donor (at a physiological pH). In addition, these leads share carboxamide linkers of opposite orientation to differentially substituted benzenoid groups. Structure\u2212activity relationships (SARs) have shown that in both inhibitor subtypes the naphthyl ring is optimally substituted at C-1 and the presence of the methyl group at the aforementioned stereogenic center is important for potency. 14, 15 Interestingly, SARS-CoV PLpro exhibited significant stereopreference for the (R)-enantiomer of 24 (IC 50 = 0.6 \u03bcM, EC 50 = 15 \u03bcM), 14 while minimal stereochemical selectivity was observed between enantiomers (R)-15g and (S)-15h (IC 50 values of 0.67 and 0.56 \u03bcM, respectively; EC 50 of 9.1 \u03bcM for both). 15 The structural bases for the high binding affinity of inhibitors 24 and 15g,h are also quite similar. The X-ray crystal structures of PLpro\u221224 and PLpro\u221215g complexes revealed several hydrophobic interactions resultant of the highly hydrophobic naphthyl ring and few hydrogen bonds. 13a,14 In addition, significant conformational changes within the active site are prominent between the apo 16 and inhibitor-bound structures. 14, 15 Specifically, there is a highly mobile \u03b2-turn/loop (Gly 267 -Gly 272 ) adjacent to the active site that closes upon inhibitor binding, thereby changing the orientation of the enzyme's backbone to allow for H-bonding with the inhibitor's core. However, relative to the conformation adopted with the smaller inhibitor 24, compound 15g requires a different and slightly more opened conformation to accommodate the longer piperidine-4-carboxamide scaffold and the bulkier 1,3-benzodioxole ring.",

Toward this goal, we utilized our previous SAR analysis and the X-ray structure of compound 15g in complex with SARS-CoV PLpro to develop a second generation of PLpro inhibitors. Here, we disclose SAR of a new series of potent SARS-CoV PLpro inhibitors, their selectivity, antiviral efficacy, biological evaluation, and a detailed report of the molecular interactions between SARS-CoV PLpro and inhibitors 3k and 3j aided by X-ray crystallographic studies. Compound 3k was established to be the most potent SARS-CoV PLpro inhibitor identified thus far in vitro. Furthermore, this compound displayed effective perturbation of SARS-CoV replication in Vero E6 cells while displaying low cytotoxicity and high selectivity for SARS-CoV PLpro over human homologue enzymes. The improved resolution of the SARS-CoV PLpro\u22123k and PLpro\u22123j X-ray structures revealed novel factors accounting for the observed high binding affinities of the piperidine-containing compounds and the previously elusive molecular contributions of the benzyl substituent of the carboxamide. Therefore, our data highlight 3k, as well as two slightly less potent but more metabolically stable analogues 3e and 5c, as good candidates for advancing to preclinical evaluations. In addition, we demonstrate the effective inhibition of PLP2 from HCoV-NL63, a potentially fatal pathogen in children and elderly, by compound 3k and related analogues. Importantly, these compounds may also present an opportunity for the development of broaderspectrum antiviral drugs against infections caused by both SARS-CoV and HCoV-NL63.

The chiral center for the nearly equipotent isomers derived from hit 2 is indicated with an asterisk. The appropriate nitriles 8a,c were treated with 1-naphthyl Grignard reagent, and the intermediary imines were hydrolyzed to the ketones 9a,c under acidic conditions (Scheme 1). 17 The ketones were then reduced by the action of LAH to the alcohols 10a,c, which were mesylated and displaced by treatment with ethyl isonipecotate to provide the amino esters 11a,c. Saponification to the carboxylic acids was followed by coupling with piperonylamine to give final racemic analogues 1a,c.",

            "text": "Structure\u2212Activity Relationship Analysis. Compound 15g is a competitive inhibitor of SARS-CoV PLpro that displays potent enzymatic inhibition (IC 50 = 0.67 \u03bcM) and low micromolar antiviral activity against SARS-CoV. It evolved from a small SAR study on the HTS hit 2 ( Figure 1 ) and is therefore an attractive lead for the development of anti-SARS drug candidates. 15 Compound 15g is composed of the central piperidine-4-carboxamide core decorated with 1-naphthalenylethyl and 1,3-benzodioxolylmethyl substituents at the piperidinyl and carboxamide nitrogens, respectively. Previous SAR has established the preference for the 1-naphthyl over the 2naphthyl substitution pattern and the requirement of a single methyl substituent at the methylene linker for effective inhibition (when compared to both unsubstituted and gemdimethyl derivatives), with minimal stereochemical preference. X-ray crystallographic studies of the SARS-CoV PLpro\u221215g complex show that the methyl group of the (R)-enantiomer extends into a small pocket that has both hydrophobic and polar features and is filled with water molecules. To explore the dimensions and availability of this pocket to substituents as well as H-bond opportunities, the first set of analogues explores the incorporation of larger or polar substituents (1a, -Me; 1b, -OH; 1c, -OMe; 1d, -Ph) at the methyl group (position R 1 in Table  1 ). Addition of substituents to R 1 resulted in higher IC 50 values for all substitutions, and loss of inhibitory potency was proportional to substituent size. These trends indicate that the corresponding pocket might be less accessible than predicted by the crystal structure, with no clear opportunities for extra H-bonding or lipophilic interactions. It also appears that the potential entropic gain by displacing the water molecules with larger R 1 groups is not achieved likely because of a larger enthalpic penalty of breaking the H-bonds formed between these water molecules and Asp 165 , Arg 167 , Tyr 274 , Thr 302 , and Asp 303 . As a result, unlike the previously reported predictions by fragment mapping program (FTMap) in which all water molecules were removed before computational analyses, 20 here we demonstrate experimentally that this pocket is unlikely to provide any extra ligand-binding sites or room for larger substituents. We next examined the effect of incorporating substituents at the benzylic position R 2 to form a second stereogenic carbon, using unsubstituted compound 2a (IC 50 = 2.2 \u00b1 0.1 \u03bcM) as the comparator. Diastereoisomeric epimers 2b and 2c, with a methyl group at R 2 , decreased the inhibitory activity by a comparable extent (IC 50 of 13.5 \u00b1 1.2 and 12.7 \u00b1 0.3 \u03bcM, respectively), indicative of a steric clash with SARS-CoV PLpro. Interestingly, a 10-fold stereopreference was observed for (S)methoxymethyl 2e (IC 50 = 1.9 \u00b1 0.1 \u03bcM), compared to epimeric 2d (IC 50 = 18.0 \u00b1 1.9 \u03bcM), which could be indicative of a H-bond in that region or simply the ability of the more active enantiomer 2e to retain the methoxy in a solventexposed environment, thereby avoiding a desolvation penalty. However, because the most active analogue in this series, 2e, did not surpass the effectiveness of the initial unsubstituted compound, 2a, we surmise that substitutions at position R 2 do not engage the active site of the enzyme in favorable interaction and are therefore unlikely to lead to activity improvement.",

However, because of the poor electron density for the Gln 270 side chain, the oxygen's contribution to inhibitory potency was uncertain. 15 Therefore, we mutated Gln 270 to an alanine, glutamate, or aspartate residue and purified the mutant enzymes and determined the IC 50 values with 15g. We found that the IC 50 values for the mutant enzymes are the same as for wild type SARS-CoV PLpro, indicating that Gln 270 does not contribute to the binding of 15g via interaction with the dioxolane ring (data not shown). As observed with compound 2a, removal of the dioxolane ring from 15g results in a \u223c3-fold decrease in potency, suggesting that the dioxolane group provides a significant contribution to inhibitory potency but not through interaction with Gln 270 .

As discussed above, previous structural and computational analyses of the 15g-bound structure showed that the 1,3-benzodioxole moiety can move within 3 \u00c5 of the amide nitrogen of Gln 270 side chain. However, mutation of Gln 270 to Ala, Glu, or Asp showed no significant change in inhibitory potency when tested against 15g, 3k, and 3j, indicative of no H-bond interactions with the side chain of Gln 270 . Interestingly, while the superimposition between PLpro\u221215g, PLpro\u22123k, and PLpro\u22123j complexes shows a near perfect overlap of the 1-naphthyl rings, there is a 1 \u00c5 difference in the position of the carboxamide nitrogen of 15g when compared to 3k and 3j. This causes a slight tilt on the orientations of the benzene rings to allow for the accommodation of the different benzene substituents. As a result, we conclude that the slightly enhanced inhibitory activity of compound 3k compared to 3j and 15g is due to its ability to form collectively stronger van der Waals' interactions between the m-fluorobenzene and the side chain of Tyr 269 , and slightly stronger interactions with the backbone oxygen atoms of Tyr 269 and Gln 270 (Figure 3f) .",

The development of an enzyme inhibitor with broad-spectrum specificity is an attractive approach for the treatment of infections caused by current and future-emerging human coronaviruses. However, to avoid drug-induced toxicity and potential side effects, it is crucial to maintain high inhibitory potency without cross-reactivity of critical homologues, the cellular deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs). First, to assess compound selectivity, a set of the most potent analogues were tested against a panel of human DUBs, including representative ubiquitin specific proteases (USPs) with structural similarity to PLpro, along with the human cysteine proteases caspase 3 and cathepsin K (Table 4 ). Compounds were tested at 31 \u03bcM. If the inhibitory activity was less than 10%, no inhibition is reported. If the inhibitory activity was between 10% and 15% or between 15% and 20%, then IC 50 values of >100 or 31 \u03bcM are reported. Importantly, we can detect no significant inhibition of the human DUBs or cysteine protease enzymes tested above 20% at 31 \u03bcM, indicating that these PLpro inhibitors are selective and are unlikely to have significant off-target activity.",

All of the analogues in Tables 1 and 2 were counterscreened against the viral orthologue PLP2 enzyme from the human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63), a member of the \u03b1coronaviruses. HCoV-NL63 is one of the causative agents of croup in children, and infection can result in hospitalization. 21 Currently there are no specific treatments for individuals infected with HCoV-NL63. For those analogues that showed >30% inhibition at a single dose concentration of 100 \u03bcM, full dose response curves of HCoV-NL63 PLP2 inhibition versus increasing compound concentration up to 100 \u03bcM were determined. Six compounds, including compound 3k, produced typical dose response curves, and the inhibition data were fit to determine the IC 50 and maximum percent inhibition values ( Table 5 ). The results show that inhibition of HCoV-NL63 PLP2 is achieved by this series of compounds, albeit significantly weaker inhibition than for SARS-CoV PLpro (micromolar versus nanomolar range), and suggest that SARS-CoV PLpro and HCoV-NL63 PLP2 may display sufficient structural similarities at the active site for the potential development of a dual-target inhibitor. SARS-CoV Antiviral Activity and Cytotoxicity Evaluation of the Most Potent Compounds. Compound 3k exhibits lower topological polar surface area (tPSA = 32.2 \u00c5 2 ) relative to the initial inhibitor 15g (tPSA = 50.8 \u00c5 2 ) and therefore is proposed to enhance cell permeability and thus antiviral activity relative to 15g. On the basis of these possible improvements, compound 3k along with seven of the most potent analogues and two quinolone derivatives were subjected to antiviral assays using our well-established method and BSL-3 protocols. 14 In this assay, compounds are titrated in both mockand SARS-CoV-infected Vero E6 cells, and the resulting dose\u2212 response curves are fitted to the four-parameter logistic equation. Curves were then compared to the mock-infected cells to assess drug-induced cytotoxicity in Vero E6 and HEK293 cell lines. The resultant EC 50 values and cytotoxic concentrations (CC 50 ) are shown in Table 6 . Because of their greater potency, all tested compounds displayed low cytotoxicity levels (CC 50 > 68 \u03bcM) with improved therapeutic index (TI) values in Vero E6 cell when compared to 15g. Compounds with IC 50 values of >2 \u03bcM (2a, 4a, and 4c) had . Compounds 3e, 5c, 3j, and 2e displayed similar to slightly improved antiviral activity when compared to the initial compound 15g. However, in the case of our best compound, 3k, which has a 4-fold improved IC 50 value, an additional 2-fold improvement in antiviral activity was observed (EC 50 = 5.4 \u00b1 0.6 \u03bcM) when compared to 15g. Metabolic Stability and Plasma Binding Studies. With the ultimate goal of achieving protection from coronaviral infection in vivo, we evaluated the stability of our best new analogues to phase I metabolism by mouse liver microsomes ( Table 7) . The lead compound 15g proved to be exceedingly unstable, being completely consumed within 15 min. This was not entirely unexpected because of the presence of the 3,4methylenedioxy moiety, which renders the benzyl aromatic ring electron-rich and is itself a known target of cytochrome P450s. 22,23 Somewhat surprisingly, the much more electronpoor 3-fluorobenzylamide 3k was still metabolized rapidly, suggesting that most of the metabolism is occurring distal to the benzylamide. Consistent with this hypothesis, the less lipophilic bis(amide) 3e and methoxypyridine 5c were significantly more stable, with 20% and 30% parent drug remaining after 15 min, respectively, and half-lives 4-to 5-fold longer than that of 15g.",

Four compounds (3k, 3e, 3j, and 5c) were found to have more potent SARS-CoV PLpro inhibition and SARS-CoV antiviral activity than the most potent first generation inhibitor, 15g. None of these five compounds exhibit cytotoxicity or off-target inhibitory activity of a series of human DUB and cysteine protease enzymes, nor do any of these five inhibitors bind to human serum albumin (HSA). The second-generation compounds 3k, 3e, and 5c exhibit significantly improved metabolic stability compared to 15g. Although compound 3k is the most potent SARS-CoV PLpro inhibitor (IC 50 = 0.15 \u03bcM) and the most effective antiviral compound in cell culture (EC 50 = 5.4 \u03bcM), it is significantly less metabolically stable compared to compounds 3e and 5c, which are similarly effective in inhibiting SARS-CoV PLpro (IC 50 = 0.39 \u03bcM and IC 50 = 0.35 \u03bcM) and inhibiting SARS-CoV infected Vero cells (EC 50 = 8.3 \u03bcM and EC 50 = 9.5 \u03bcM). Thus, compounds 3e and 5c are likely to be the better candidates to advance to animal efficacy models. Finally, the high resolution of the inhibitor-bound crystal structures of PLpro with 3k and 3j revealed novel aspects for the inhibitor binding mode, providing guidance for the further optimization of PLpro inhibitors. 1 H NMR and 13 C NMR spectra were recorded in parts per million (ppm) on the \u03b4 scale from an internal standard of residual tetramethylsilane (0 ppm). Rotamers are described as a ratio of rotamer A to rotamer B if possible. Otherwise, if the rotamers cannot be distinguished, the NMR peaks are described as multiplets. Mass spectrometry data were obtained on a Waters Corporation LCT.

The resulting residue was purified via flash chromatography (10 g silica, 20% EtOAc/Hex) to give the desired monoester (38 mg, 43%). 1 H NMR (500 MHz, chloroform-d) \u03b4 8.49 (s, 1H), 7.83 (dt, J = 6.9, 3.5 Journal of Medicinal Chemistry Article dx.doi.org/10.1021/jm401712t | J.
