There are several predisposing factors for colonization or infection with ACB complex species [1, 3] , and widespread environmental contamination has been frequently reported [4, 5] . ACB complex infections have increased worldwide, and MDRACB complex has been isolated in Taiwan since 1999 [6] . In Taiwan, ACB complex is a predominant pathogen causing bloodstream infection and is associated with a high risk of antibiotic resistance [7] . Furthermore, patients with MDRACB complex bacteremia have a higher mortality rate than patients with non-MDRACB complex bacteremia [8] ; the overall 30-day mortality of MDRACB complex bloodstream infections ranges from 45.3 to 49% [6, 9] .",

CCH also received on-site surveys for hospital accreditation by the Joint Commission International (JCIA), which includes the prevention and control of infections as core standards. Accordingly, CCH organized a campaign for hand hygiene champions and an antibiotic control program.

[26] . The incidence density of HAI decreased because of the increased chlorhexidine consumption density following education and hand hygiene promotion during period 2, whereas that of CRA complex did not. We were unable to determine the proportion of reduced CRA complex incidence density attributable to decreased patient-to-patient transmission, but cohorting likely improved compliance with infection control measures including hand hygiene, as corroborated by previous authors demonstrating the effectiveness of isolation precautions for patients with CRA complex infection or colonization [11, 25, 27] .",

We had previously studied changes in the clinical features of AB in Changhua County, Taiwan between 1998 and 2000 [9] (Appendix 3). The incidence of AB in adults in CCH increased from 127.4 per 100,000 patient-years in 2002 to 132.2 per 100,000 patient-years in 2013. The incidence of AB increased steadily from 1998 to 2009 and then decreased from 2010 to 2012 (Appendix 4). There was a significant increasing linear trend of CRA complex bacteremia during the study [31] . Although the incidence of AB was lower in Taiwan than in Saudi Arabia, it was difficult to compare the incidence we observed in this study to that of other countries because of differences in the methods used. Our study results showed that the incidence of CRA complex bacteremia had increased significantly in CCH since 2008. CRA complex bacteremia increased from 34.5% to 64.8% during the study period mainly because of increasing CRA complex isolates and increasing healthcare-associated AB, but not of community-acquired CRA complex bacteremia.",

            "text": "Our results correlated to those of Kuo et al. [6] . Antibiotic use at the onset of infection changed during the study period, because of the increase in CRA complex infections. Antibiotic use changed significantly during the study period; this was explained by the increased incidence of CRA complex as well as the increased complexity and severity of underlying diseases. The crude 30-day mortality rate was 25.2% (224/890). There was no significant increase in mortality during the study period. The number of patients presenting with CRA complex bacteremia increased but the crude 30-day mortality rate remained between 20.2% and 32.4% during the study period, explained in part by the relatively low virulence of CRA complex and improved supportive care. Jang et al. did not observe any significant difference in the cumulative survival curves of patients presenting with AB and control patients [32] . Likewise, Jamulitrat et al. did not observe any significant difference in mortality rates among 35 patients (52.2%) in imipenem-resistant and imipenem-susceptible ACB complex groups [33] . These results are consistent with ours. We also analyzed the variables contributing to the decreased incidence density of HAI, rates of CRA complex, and incidence of AB over a 12-year study period (Appendix 4). The in-service education for infection control programs, promotion of hand hygiene, and enhancement of antibiotic control programs during the preparation for hospital accreditation appear to have been effective in controlling CRA complex infection and AB episodes at CCH. However, the isolation precautions for CRA complex did not allow controlling CRA complex infection during period 1, because of poor compliance, because compliance with infection control interventions is the critical requisite for an affective control of CRA complex infections. We did not perform active screening cultures, which would have allowed an early detection of patients with CRA complex at hospital admission or during hospitalization, consequently prompting contact precautions to reduce person-to-person transmission [34] . There is no optimal surveillance sampling method for MDRACB complex contrary to other multidrug-resistant pathogens [34] . The authors of a previous study reported low MDRACB complex surveillance culture sensitivity for MDRACB complex detection [35] . Sampling is expensive and increases the workload of healthcare workers; consequently we did not implement active microbiological screening, which could be inappropriate for detecting CRA complex carriers. Furthermore, some authors even reported there was no benefit in performing active surveillance cultures for CRA complex [36, 37] . Furthermore, compliance with the infection control interventions in our study might have been suboptimal during period 1. Internal and external audits revealed a significant decrease in the incidence density of HAI during period 2. We assumed that the hand hygiene campaign launched before the hospital accreditation program during period 2 greatly enhanced compliance, which led to an increase in chlorhexidine consumption density.",

The calculated incidence of AB at CCH was most likely underestimated because 6.9% cases of AB infection were excluded. Furthermore, some cases of AB infection for which blood was not cultured or those treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics before blood cultures might have been overlooked. However, these cases were not likely to account for a large rate of AB cases. Data on antibiotic history was inaccurate for many patients who had received antibiotics in the month before their AB infection episode, including patients with community-and healthcare-onset infections, because part of this study was performed retrospectively. The defined daily doses for the various antibiotics administered during the study period could not be calculated, because some of the antibiotics had been altered and because of a lack of available manpower. Furthermore, we did not perform pulsed-field gel electrophoresis typing of CRA complex isolates, because there was no evidence of an outbreak during the study period; thus, the role of patient-to-patient transmission in the acquisition of CRA complex could not be documented.",

Moreover, 680 infections (76.4%) were classified as healthcare-onset, and 210 (23.6%) as community-onset. The comorbidities for AB included diabetes mellitus (25.6%), gastrointestinal disease (25.3%), cerebrovascular disease (17.5%), cardiovascular disease (15.3%), immunodepression (5.6%), and HIV infection (2.7%). The incidence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease increased gradually throughout the study period(P < 0.001). McCabe's classification of chronic underlying diseases allowed identifying 392 (44.0%) cases with ultimately fatal and rapidly fatal illness. The source or complications of AB included 273 (60.7%) cases with respiratory infection, 136 (15.3%) with skin and soft tissue infection, 135 (15.2%) with catheter-associated infection, 82 (9.2%) with urinary tract infection, 21 (2.4%) with intra-abdominal infection, and 243 (27.3%) were not documented. Eight hundred and twenty-seven (92.9%) patients received antibiotics before the AB episode. The choice of antibiotics during the AB episodes included cephalosporin, penicillin, carbapenem, aminoglycoside, and fluoroquinolone antibiotics in 782 (87.9%), 353 (40.0%), 225 (25.3%), 205 (23.0%), and 95 (10.7%) cases,",
