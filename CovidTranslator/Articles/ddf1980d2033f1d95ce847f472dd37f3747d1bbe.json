All are considered threatened in the wild and many are on the endangered species list (Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora: Appendix 1). Because of their small size and anthropomorphic appeal, people are interested in owning callitrichids as pets. Hand-raised bottle-fed babies are quite charming until sexual maturity, at which time they often become aggressive and unpredictable to humans, including their owners. Consequently, people should be discouraged from keeping callitrichids as pets. If a veterinarian is consulted about callitrichids by a potential owner before purchase, it may be possible to offer encouragement toward a more suitable pet (e.g., ferret and sugar glider).",

A veterinarian is required to be the doctor of record for any NHP owner who has a USDA permit for his or her animal. This entails writing a veterinary plan, enrichment criteria and activities, means of euthanasia, periodic visitation and examination of animals at the facility, plans for periodic testing, and applicable vaccinations. Being a veterinarian for a USDA facility that houses NHP requires a degree of commitment beyond what is expected for many of the more traditional pets. 1 It has been this author's experience that, as a rule, tamarins have a more stable, less volatile personality than marmosets have. As adults, tamarins have a tendency to be less aggressive and more predictable than marmosets. Unfortunately, marmosets have very winsome features that many humans find appealing and are capable of a variety of facial expressions. Tamarins have much less facial hair (with some notable exceptions); however, they too can produce many facial expressions.",

This cycle is approximately 15 days in most species. Callitrichids become sexually mature at approximately 16 to 25 months of age; however, copulation and masturbation may occur much earlier. The gestation period is approximately 150 days. Postpartum estrus typically occurs 9 to 10 days after parturition, along with distinct mating and birthing seasons. 2 Most often, callitrichids have twins, although singletons, triplets, and quadruplet births may occur.",

Differences in marmosets and tamarins can be classified using 2 methods. Taxonomists distinguish the differences between marmosets of the genus Callithrix and tamarins of the genus Saguinus based on their teeth. The incisors of marmosets are enlarged, so that they are the same length as the canines, enabling them to gouge holes effectively in trees, so as to consume the nutritive gums and saps (called exudates). The canine teeth of the genus Saguinus are longer than the incisors, which enables these animals to inflict a deeper bite. 2 Because of the longer length of a tamarin's teeth, some governmental agencies have classified these animals as more dangerous than marmosets.",

These NHP may actively and aggressively defend their territory and their owner against strangers and family members.

They may bite multiple sites in the same area, whereas other callitrichids may attack the hands, toes, or knees as the preferred sites. Occasionally, an enraged callitrichid may bite the owner in a case of misplaced rage when it sees a person perceived to be a threat. Tamarins may also attack and bite family members and strangers.

The average life spans for marmosets and tamarins in captivity are 12 and 17 years, respectively; however, cotton-top tamarins have been known to live up to 25 years of age. The smallest marmoset is the pygmy, with an adult weighing approximately 130 g. A NHP gives birth to its first offspring when it is as young as 20 to 24 months, but sexual maturity is typically reached at 12 months for females and at 16.7 months for males. 1 Callitrichids can see in color and possess a duplex retina, consisting of rods and cones. These animals rotate the head from side to side to better estimate distance. The uterus is simplex with the placenta being labyrinthine and the attachment of the umbilical cord discoidal, or bidiscoidal in the case of twins. When pregnant with twins, usually 1 embryo is attached to each of 2 placental disks. 1 The male penis has a baculum that helps maintain stiffness during penetration. Chimerism is a normal phenomenon in callitrichids in which polyzygosity, usually dizygosity, occurs. Chimerism can be readily detected in heterosexual twins by the presence of both male and female sex cells in the tissues, especially hematopoietic and gonadal tissues. 1 One can easily determine the sex of callitrichids through visual examination of the external genitalia, even in newborns. In female primates, the urethra and vagina usually open into a common urogenital sinus. There is a shallow vulva with the urethra opening at the tip of the clitoris, with the vagina at the base. 1 Females also have a single pair of pectoral mammae.",

The glands of the interramal, gular, sternal, abdominal, and inguinal areas are used to mark runway branches. They use circumgenital glands to mark selected objects and their mates by swaying their posterior in a side-toside motion. The ulnar-carpal glands leave scent on anything brushed against the arm. All glands imprint the offspring with the odor of the parents, family group, and species. Callitrichids scent-mark their areas by rubbing the perineum over many objects in their environment: toys, food dishes, bedding, stuffed animals, furniture, rugs, caging, owners, clothing, and even food items. Scentmarking is used for identification of a breeding pair and their offspring and for assertion of social status, sexual readiness, and territorial claims. It is used to invite and to repel, as well as to countersign the markings of others. Some tamarins mark by urinating into the hand and others may rub their cheeks in the urine of their sexual partners. 1 Marking in cotton-top tamarins (S. oedipus) occurs with much greater frequency in females than in males. Marking may vary significantly between different species. Callitrichids may be trained to defecate in a given area, and their urine does not have a very strong odor and they tend to urinate frequently in many locations.",

Vaccination against tetanus is recommended for all callitrichids. 8 Human cold sores, caused by the herpes simplex virus (HSV), are extremely dangerous to callitrichids and may result in fatal encephalitis. It is important to realize that a human need not have an active herpetic lesion to transmit the virus to a callitrichid. In this author's experience, herpes encephalitis appears to be age related. Young marmosets and tamarins (o12 months of age) usually die within 5 days of developing signs of illness (typically 3 days after exposure). Older callitrichids do not appear as susceptible to this infection, or perhaps they develop an inapparent infection after which immunity is acquired.

As female marmosets or tamarins often go into labor shortly after sunset, a dystocia might not be realized until 8 to 12 hours later if the animal is not monitored throughout the night. Most successful deliveries occur within 1 hour of onset of labor. By morning, the pregnant female may be exhausted and she may have stopped having contractions (uterine inertia). It is important to know whether the female has begun to experience labor or the amniotic sac has ruptured. If the amniotic sac has ruptured and the cervix is open, infection and loss of the infant(s) may occur within 24 hours. It is possible to ascertain if the amniotic sac has ruptured by taking a sterile swab, moistened with sterile saline, and gently swabbing the vaginal canal. Roll the collected liquid onto a glass slide and examine it under a light microscope. Dried amniotic fluid appears as rainbow-hued ferning on the slide. 18 If the amniotic sac has ruptured, it is likely that the female will require emergency surgery. Medical therapy may be employed if the neonates are not too large, as determined by radiographic or ultrasound images. Oxytocin (Pitocin; PAR pharmaceutical, Woodcliff Lake, NJ USA), parental calcium, fluid therapy, vitamin D 3 , and antibiotics may be used to assist with the passage of the neonates through the pelvis.

A dark box should be offered as sleeping quarters. Hospitalized patients should be handled as little as possible, and favorite foods should be offered.
