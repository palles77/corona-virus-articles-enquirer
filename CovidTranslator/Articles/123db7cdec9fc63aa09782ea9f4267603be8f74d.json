Precise cell modulation demands multi-modal display of functional proteins with controlled densities on biomaterials. Here, we develop an artificial immune cell engager (AICE) platform -biodegradable particles onto which multiple proteins are densely loaded with ratiometric control via short nucleic acid tethers. We demonstrate the impact of AICE with varying ratios of anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies on ex vivo expansion of human primary T cells. We also show that AICE can be used to control the activity of engineered T cells in vivo. AICE injected intratumorally can provide a local priming signal for systemically administered AND-gate chimeric antigen receptor T cells, driving local tumor clearance while sparing uninjected tumors that model potentially cross-reactive healthy tissues. This modularly functionalized biomaterial thus provides a flexible platform to achieve sophisticated control over cell-based immunotherapies.",

A series of optimization studies were carried out to achieve maximum loading density, ratiometric control of moiety loading, adaptability to different particle size/composition, and feasibility for in vivo use. Micron-sized artificial immune cell engagers (AICE) were made from biocompatible poly(lactic-coglycolic acid) (PLGA) polymer 38 (Fig. 1a) . We demonstrated that: i) we can load a range of immune modulators (e.g. anti-CD3, anti-CD28, and IL-2) on AICE at controlled ratios and densities; ii) the ratiometric control of costimulatory ligands is essential for optimal ex vivo T cell activation and expansion with higher yield and less exhaustion; iii) we can locally administer antigen-presenting AICE to control ANDgate CAR-T cell activation and tumor clearance in vivo (Fig. 1a) . This modular materials-based strategy can provide versatile and precise synthetic control of natural or engineered immune cells for cancer immunotherapy 1, 12, 29 .",

In the case of a fluorescently labeled human IgG, the surface conjugation strategy resulted in saturated protein loading even with increased densities of available DNA linkers on surface (Fig 2b, Fig 1d and Fig. Supplementary 2a) . In contrast, the hybridization-guided assembly strategy showed a dramatically higher level of IgG loading for particles with denser DNA linkers, and the increase in IgG loading corresponded to the scaffold density (Fig. 2b) . The highest level of IgG loading achieved (at ~0.6 million per particle) was again comparable to the theoretical footprint limit of a spherical particle at 2 \u03bcm in diameter (~0.64 million per particle, based on ~5 nm diameter of IgG) (Fig. 2b) .

After surface hybridization with a mixture of their respective dye-labeled complementary strands (Fig. 2d) , we found that the ratios of hybridized DNA scaffolds of different sequences on PLGA microparticles were consistent with the polymer-DNA conjugate input, evidenced by both confocal fluorescence imaging (Fig. 2e) and a fluorescencebased quantification assay (Fig. 2f) . The ratiometric control of dye-labeled DNA strand loading was equally efficient for PLA microparticles (Fig. Supplementary   2g ,h). Based on this, we co-loaded three different proteins (GFP and two antibodies), each individually attached with one of the three complementary DNA strands, onto PLGA microparticles with varying ratios of the DNA surface scaffold sequences above.

The increased loading density of surface biomolecules was found to be necessary to make particles capable of presenting antigens to robustly activate synNotch receptors in primary human T cells, and may also significantly enhance immune cell signaling where ligand clustering is required 10, 46 .

Local injection of our particles serves to safely control receptor activation and downstream behavior of therapeutic cells in vivo.

AICE were retained locally within the tumor for over a week(Fig. 5a and Fig. Supplementary 5b), and the fluorescence quantification showed an approximate half-life of 4-5 days for the surface coating of both types of particles (Fig. 5b and Fig. Supplementary 5c-e).

NSG mice (Jackson Laboratory #005557, female, ~8-12-weeks old) were implanted with xenograft tumors -5 x 10 6 K562 tumor cells subcutaneously on the left and right flank. 10 days after tumor implantation, 50 \u03bcL particles at 100 OD550 were injected intratumorally, and imaged under IVIS 100 preclinical imaging system (Xenogen #124262) every 3-4 hours for the first 48 hours and every 8 hours for the rest of the week. Images are analyzed using Living Image Software (PerkinElmer).",

Remaining tumors from contralateral flank and early euthanized mice were collected and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (Electron Microscopy Sciences #15710) overnight, followed by the dehydration in 30% sucrose (Sigma #S9378) for 1-2 days until sunk. Tumors were then snap-frozen in OCT (Tissue-Tek) to produce cryosections. Sections were stained with anti-CD3 antibody (Biolegend #344811) in 1% BSA/PBS for 1 hour and washed three time, followed by the imaging with the spinning disk confocal fluorescence microscope (Nikon Yokogawa CSU-22). Statistical analysis Statistical analysis were preformed using GraphPad Prism software. All values and error bars are mean \u00b1 s.d., except where indicated differently. Two-tailed paired t test, one-way ANOVA test, one site-specific binding model fit, and fourth order polynomial model fit were performed where appropriate. Life Sciences Reporting summary.
