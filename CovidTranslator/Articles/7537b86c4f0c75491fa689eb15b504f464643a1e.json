The key question remains: how do viruses, which encode relatively few genes, constantly outmaneuver hosts like us, which encode >20,000 genes? We believe that integrated system-wide approaches ( Fig. 1) , including transcriptomics, metabolomics, proteomics and high-throughput techniques, combined with mathematical modeling and computational biology, hold great potential for understanding the biological complexity of virus-host interactions and translating it into preventive and personalized medicine to combat viral infections.",

Furthermore, many medically important viruses, such as HIV-1, influenza viruses and hepatitis C virus (HCV), have the inherent capacity to rapidly mutate and become resistant to even the most potent of drugs because of their low-fidelity replication mode. For this reason, single antiretroviral drugs targeting HIV-1 are no longer recommended for clinical use, necessitating the use of combination therapy.",

Host cells offer a wealth of proven, druggable targets, such as cell surface receptors, protein kinases, nuclear receptors and proteasomes. Moreover, antiviral drugs targeting cellular pathways may be less susceptible to the emergence of drug resistance because the human genes encoding targeted cellular proteins are less likely to mutate in response to therapy. Indeed, experimental evidence supporting this notion is provided by the utility of pharmacological inhibitors of cyclindependent kinases (CDKs; Fig. 2 ) in blocking the replication of herpes simplex virus (HSV)-1 and HIV-1 and by the fact that attempts to isolate resistant strains of these viruses have been unsuccessful in cell culture systems 2,3 . Importantly, several CDK inhibitors are being developed as potential anticancer drugs, and thus far no major toxicity has been observed in human clinical trials. Thus, by combining drugs targeting common cellular pathways that are required for the life cycle of different viruses with antivirals and/or immunomodulators, we may be able to develop regimens capable of treating multiple viral diseases.",

Furthermore, the recent initiation by Romark Laboratories (Tampa, FL) of a phase 2 clinical trial of nitazoxanide for treating chronic hepatitis C in the United States represents the first of a new class of small-molecule drugs called the thiazolides that target cell signaling pathways used in viral replication. It is also noteworthy that the current standard treatment for HCV is a combination of a PEGylated interferon (IFN)-\u03b1 and ribavirin, both of which are, ironically, nonspecific antiviral drugs targeting cellular factors 6 . IFNs activate multiple intracellular pathways to establish intracellular antiviral immunity, and ribavirin acts, at least in part, by depleting intracellular pools of guanine nucleotides through inhibition of the cellular inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase. The Toll-like receptor (TLR)-7 agonist imiquimod, an immune modifier that rapidly induces IFNs and other antiviral effector molecules, is approved for the treatment of genital warts caused by HSV. Indeed, there is considerable development of host response modulation in antiviral treatment. For example, systemic administration of ANA-245 (7-thia-8 oxoguanosine), a selective TLR7 agonist, in patients resulted in dose-dependent induction of immunological biomarkers and a statistically significant antiviral effect with relatively few and mild side effects 7 . In addition, TLR7 ligand SM360320 (9-benzyl-8-hydroxy-2-(2-methoxyethoxy)adenine) reduces HCV RNA levels in Huh-7 cells carrying the HCV replicon, at least in part by induction of type I IFN through TLR7 stimulation 8 .

For those pathways that are vital to fundamental cellular processes, it will be necessary to modulate rather than ablate the enzymes involved so as to minimize the potential for severe side effects. If we have been successful in identifying small molecules to treat various chronic human disorders with manageable adverse effects, why can't we do the same for viral infections?

Deciphering the mechanisms of any disease requires a deep knowledge of how multiple and concurrent signal-transduction pathways operate and are deregulated. Inescapably, the intricacies of signaling pathways, which are often highly interconnected and temporally and spatially regulated, can be dissected only by systemlevel approaches. Coupled with compendium analysis, systems biology has the potential to discover novel pro-host therapeutic targets. By providing a more robust overview of the host cellular machinery and its response and interaction with a virus, these kinds of analyses offer inroads toward the development of innovative therapeutics that can act in concert with the host defense mechanism. Several notable case studies support the use of full systems-scale analyses in rational antiviral drug development. These can be categorized into three general areas: viral pathogenesis, functional identification of novel viral and host genes as drug targets, and prediction of antiviral drug response and patient stratification.",

We contend that dissection of the critical, and often subtly different, cellular pathways will eventually unveil opportunities for manipulating the host immune response to fight off viral infection, control pathogenesis or both. A primary objective of the research in the laboratory of M.G.K. is to determine the viral and cellular factors responsible for the increased virulence of pandemic viral strains, particularly the 1918 influenza virus. We found that mice infected with a virus containing all eight genes from that pandemic virus showed dramatic activation of proinflammatory and cell-death pathways by 24 hours after infection-a phenomenon that continued unabated until the animals' death on day 5 (ref. 12) . This contrasted with the situation with influenza viruses containing only subsets of the 1918 genes, which induced less marked host immune responses (as measured at the gene expression level using microarrays), produced less severe disease pathology and killed infected mice more slowly. This study 12 represents the first comprehensive analysis of the global host response induced by the 1918 influenza virus in an animal model. As a specific illustration of where genomics approaches can lead us, in Figure 3 a biological network of selected genes induced twofold or more (P < 0.01) in the lungs of mice infected with the recombinant 1918 influenza virus (r1918), as compared with uninfected controls, is used to depict the activation of cell-death responses during r1918 infection.",

This effort has resulted in the sequencing of the rhesus macaque genome 13 and the development of an oligonucleotide microarray containing over 17,000 unique macaque sequences 14 16 . Our studies suggest that the lethality associated with the 1918 virus is a culmination of a cooperative interactions between the 1918 viral genes that results in a one-two blow to the host: an attenuation of the expression of specific innate immune response genes, including certain genes associated with the type I IFN response, followed by severe and persistent inflammatory and cell-death responses that may contribute to severe immunopathology. Indeed, these data suggest that the best treatment for such a virulent virus would be to combine an antiviral compound with existing anti-inflammatory drugs. Work in the laboratory of M.G.K. has also addressed a wide range of other viral pathogens, including HCV 17 , Ebola virus 18 , West Nile virus 19 , SARS-associated coronavirus 20 , HSV 21 and HIV 22 . The long-term goal is to assemble massive databases describing the host responses to multiple viral agents in multiple model systems. We believe that a careful dissection of these databases will reveal the secrets necessary to devise effective antiviral strategies against host cell processes. As microarray analysis measures gene expression only at the transcriptional level, we have also begun to incorporate other complementary approaches, such as proteomics and bioinformatics, to apply systems biology to the study of viral infections and virus-associated diseases 23, 24 . By collecting 'clinical' data on humans and animals, we hope to integrate genomic, proteomic and clinical datasets to enhance our ability to understand the underlying mechanisms of host defense and response to viral infection.

Emergence is a trait in which the whole is greater than the sum of the parts; robustness is characteristic of resilience to fluctuations in the immediate environment resulting from redundancy and control mechanisms; modularity is a phenomenon that explains the 'clustering' of parts into a functional or structural entity. That said, certain features of virus-host interactions make them particularly interesting for global investigations. A case in point for emergent properties is the discovery of aberrant innate immune responses in macaques lethally infected by the 1918 influenza virus 16 . Robustness of HIV through latency and rapid low-fidelity turnover is widely recognized as a factor for continued infection and resistance. Modularity in predicted varicella zoster virus-human and KSHV-human networks was seen in Uetz's work 26 Figure 3 Functional relationships of activated of cell death responses during r1918 influenza virus infection.

The analysis revealed that 687 proteins changed in abundance at the peak of virus production at 36 hours after infection. Pathway analysis revealed that the differential expression of proteins was concentrated in select biological pathways, such as ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes, carrier proteins in nucleocytoplasmic transport, CDKs in cell cycle progression and pyruvate dehydrogenase of the citrate cycle pathways. Moreover, changes were observed in the abundance of proteins that are known to interact with HIV-1 viral proteins. This proteomic analysis captured changes in the host protein milieu at the time of robust virus production, depicting changes in cellular processes that may contribute to virus replication.

They often accomplish this by hijacking host enzymes to carry out post-translational modifications, such as protein phosphorylation, producing versions of the same viral proteins with different biological functions. Understanding the process and timing of viral gene expression and protein post-translational modifications and their role in the viral life cycle not only will reveal mechanisms of virus replication and/or pathogenesis, as discussed above, but may also identify host cellular targets, such as protein kinases, that are suitable for therapeutic intervention 3 . For example, microarray studies 38 have revealed that elevated levels of prostaglandin E2 are required for efficient replication of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) in fibroblasts, leading to the experimental demonstration that cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors can block the accumulation of immediate-early viral mRNA and protein in cell culture. This suggests that drugs targeting this cellular pathway could be used to treat HCMV infection. Similarly, functional genomics studies have revealed that c-Kit is one of the most consistently KSHV-induced genes 39 . Inhibition of c-Kit activity with the pharmacological inhibitor of c-Kit signaling STI571 reverses the KSHV-induced morphological transformation in cell culture. Lck and heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs) are upregulated in latently HIV-infected CD4 + T cells 40 . Interestingly, Lck signaling events can be linked to RNA processing and translation via the Lck kinase-mediated phosphorylation of hnRNP K, which may regulate HIV transcription, translation and/or RNA processing, suggesting that Lck could be a promising drug target for HIV latency.",

To illustrate this point, NCBI's GenBank contains an overwhelming ~2,000 completely sequenced unique viral genomes, and ~2,500 complete viral genomes of influenza A virus have been sequenced to date 58 . This, along with the '$1,000 genome' goals of the Personalized Human Genome project, necessitate advances in bioinformatics and computational biology to carry out whole-genome comparisons for intrahost and interhost strains as well as for host-host variation. A stimulating commentary by Holmes 58 asks thought-provoking questions about the use of genomics data to understand evolutionary interactions between concurrently circulating pathogens in a host and their influence on disease etiology (for example, the rise of opportunistic pathogen-related infections with the HIV pandemic) and how host immunity shapes pathogen diversity and response to infection (for example, interactions among the four dengue serotypes). Furthermore, intrahost and interhost genetic variability is important in understanding cross-species transmission and emergence, with the avian H5N1 flu virus being a prime example. The fields of viral metagenomics and viral diagnostics are therefore poised for rapid expansion. Beyond the burgeoning expression profiling datasets in databases, such as NCBI's GEO, M.G.K.'s laboratory has generated over 5,000 array datasets over the past seven years using commercial and internally developed microarray platforms. Such datasets will provide clues to host determinants of infections and usher in an era of 'personalized viromics'. Along the same lines, Braga-Neto and colleagues 59 provide an illuminating discussion on the overwhelming scale and potential of immunomics, which aims to uncover host immunological responses to antigens. These developments set the stage for systems-level analyses to develop better and safer personalized treatment and preventive modalities. 42 have demonstrated the power of using kinome-wide RNA interference (RNAi) screens to identify host factors that facilitate the infectious entry of vesicular stomatitis virus and simian virus 40. Interestingly, they found limited overlap between the kinases regulating the entry of the two viruses, suggesting that the viruses harness different host endocytic machinery to gain entry. This may offer a selective approach to target various classes of viruses. Taken together, these studies suggest that systems biology has the potential to uncover a common viral theme based on shared molecular signatures or networks that may be vulnerable to disruption and that it could lead to the development of broadly applicable control strategies for viruses.",

An illustrative example is the recent report of the first whole-genome association study to identify host determinants of HIV-1 infection 43 . Researchers found three polymorphisms that explain nearly 15% of the variation in HIV-1 viral load among individuals, which could lead to improved therapies and new targets for vaccine development. Pharmacogenomics initiatives will be enhanced by higher-density platforms, such as the '6.0 SNP array' that detects ~900,000 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in a single experiment. Detailing the association between genotype and individual response to infection or treatment will allow physicians to limit the use of drugs that may be dangerous for subsets of the population to the groups of individuals that can benefit from these treatments.

            "text": "We have entered into an unprecedented time of information production via high-throughput technologies and computational advances. But this is just the tip of the iceberg. The prospects for systems biology in studies of virus-host interactions are more exciting than ever with recent advances in noninvasive technologies to image fundamental processes (for example, transcriptional regulation, signal-transduction cascades, protein-protein interactions and cell trafficking) in living cells [51] [52] [53] and animal models 54 . For example, a neglected area of investigation is the replication sites for positive-strand RNA viruses (such as HCV and the SARS coronavirus), which replicate their genomes on intracellular membrane compartments while simultaneously avoiding, minimizing or delaying double-stranded RNA-induced host antiviral responses, such as activation of protein kinase, RNA-activated (PKR) and RNase L or RNA interference 55 . Many of these intracellular compartments also harbor host defense sensors, such as TLR3, TLR7 and TLR9 on endosomal vesicles, and antiviral effectors, such as RIG-I (retinoic-acid-inducible gene I) and PERK (protein kinase (PKR)-like ER kinase) on mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum, respectively. Despite being a major battleground in the host-virus conflict, the exact sites of viral RNA synthesis, the components of host and viral factors, and the organization and functioning of the intracellular membrane compartments are poorly understood. By integrating ultrastructural and live-animal imaging technologies with functional genomics and computational analysis, it should now be possible to characterize the features of membrane-associated RNA replication complexes in other viruses and generate a 'systems-based model' that will facilitate our understanding of the general principles and mechanisms of positive-strand RNA virus replication as well as of the viruses' evasion of the immune system.",

In vaccine development, another promising approach is the development of newly emerging peptide microarrays that use antigen peptides as fixed probes and serum antibodies as targets to identify antibody reactivity patterns (and potentially valuable clinical biomarkers) involved in virus infections. This concept is highlighted by studies examining antibody responses to simian immunodeficiency virus and HIV using an array displaying peptides derived from viral amino acid sequences; these studies found that a reduction in the repertoire of the antibody response is associated with the development of AIDS 56 . By correlating the efficacy of vaccine candidates with host immune responses, we may gain a better molecular understanding of, and thus become better able to predict efficacy of, vaccine candidates 55 .",

            "text": "So why hasn't the promise of large-scale biology provided us yet with a raft of new antiviral therapeutics? Currently, systems biology approaches suffer from several experimental and computational drawbacks. Highthroughput approaches are sensitive to the way in which samples are collected and handled, and a variety of factors, such as RNA and protein degradation and the presence of contaminating tissue, can influence gene expression and proteome analysis. Although a lot of time and effort has gone into ameliorating these kinds of problems to generate more reproducible results in genomics experiments, variability across platforms and between laboratories remains an issue for those attempting to integrate datasets from different sources. The challenge now is the need to integrate not only multiple levels of biological data from an individual experiment but also data from different groups for the same assay, and to translate high-throughput data into digested results that can be easily interpreted by a broader audience, including clinicians, governmental regulators and other scientists. This will require close collaborations among virologists, pathologists, clinicians, biologists, statisticians and bioinformaticians, and collaborative consortia and large-scale networked science with partnerships between industry and academia to ensure high quality of the samples, data generation, processing and analysis, as well as ease of data accessibility and interpretation.",

The illustration depicts the viral functions that are directly repressed by CDK inhibitors or by two typical antiviral drugs, acyclovir and foscarnet. Because CDKs are required for transcription of HSV immediateearly (IE), early (E) and perhaps late (L) genes, and for viral DNA replication, CDK inhibitors can target several stages of the viral replication cycle as opposed to blocking a specific viral target(s), such as the viral thymidine kinase (TK) or DNA polymerase (DNA pol). Thus, a single drug targeting a single cellular protein that is required for several viral functions is akin to combination antiviral therapy, in which each drug targets a different viral enzymes.
