When the outbreak ended in mid-April, a total of 321 residents from 15 blocks had been affected. 3 The epidemic had all the features of a common source outbreak, and has been classified by Riley and colleagues as a single \"super-spread event\". 4 They also postulated that initial exposure happened on March 19. 4 Since the mean incubation period of SARS is estimated to be 6\u00b74 days, 5 and the mean serial interval 8\u00b74 days, 6 most of the 267 people who fell ill in the first 12 days (March 21 to April 1) must have been primary cases from the same exposure.",

Although we do not know the exact amount of virus needed for clinical disease, to infect more than 200 people with a sole contamination (after dilution of the virus upon leaving the host), the index patient would have needed to excrete a tremendous amount of virus into the environment. A single viral discharge from the index patient has a finite window of infectiousness. Although some research has shown that the SARS virus can live for up to 4 days in diarrhoeal fluid, 8 on dry surfaces the survival time is estimated to be 24-48 h. 8 The Amoy Gardens epidemic, therefore, would have required delivery of the virus to more than 200 people within 1-2 days.",

The source of the outbreak was later traced to an individual with SARS who spent two nights at Amoy Gardens. Official explanations failed to account for the large number of residents infected over a wide area within a short time. A powerful environmental mechanism that efficiently amplified and distributed the causal agent must have been at work to cause this outbreak. One such mechanism could be an animal vector, most probably roof rats, that was infected by the index patient and subsequently spread the disease to more than 150 households.",

Viral genomes from different series of patients should be compared. 9 Secretions from infected rats, such as urine, droppings, or saliva, contain large amounts of virus and are highly contagious. 9 Roof rats prefer to forage for food above ground in elevated areas. 10 They are also territorial and habitual, and tend to follow the same pathways between their nest and food sources and make return visits time after time. 11 Their range of activity when looking for food is about 30-45 m. 11 The lightwell between units 7 and 8 of block E is very narrow (1\u00b75 m) with two separate sewage pipes running vertically along the walls close to the bathroom windows. Clothes-lines are installed outside the bathrooms of each unit, and these almost touch one another, providing convenient bridges for rats to travel up and down the building.
