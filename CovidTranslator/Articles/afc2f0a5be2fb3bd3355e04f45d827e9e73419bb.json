Our study describes the use of an aerosol sampling system to monitor the prevalence of airborne viruses in a hospital setting. Using SKC AirCheck Touch pumps, with National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) bioaerosol samplers and SKC filter cassette blanks, 28 aerosol samples were collected in a hospital ward in Singapore. Following DNA/RNA extraction, real-time RT-PCR/PCR was used for the detection of influenza A, B and D viruses, coronaviruses, enteroviruses, and adenoviruses. Airborne virus was detected in nine (32%) of 28 samples. Among the nine positive samples, eight were PCR-positive for adenovirus and one for influenza A virus. Our data suggest that bioaerosol sampling could be valuable in monitoring for airborne respiratory viruses in clinical environments to better understand the risk of infection during a hospital visit.",

Two of the largest hospitals in Singapore report that on average, one in seven hospitalized patients acquire a nosocomial infection, 1 with immunocompromised children at greatest risk. Little is known regarding the transmission of respiratory viruses in clinical environments. Theoretically, influenza and other respiratory viruses are transmitted through contact with contagious persons and contaminated fomites. However, there is an increasing body of evidence supporting the concept of transmis-sion through the inhalation of virus-laden particles. Specifically, airborne virus-laden particles \u22644\u03bcm are thought to play a significant role in respiratory virus transmission as they can remain in the air for prolonged periods of time and are inhaled deep into the lungs. 2",

Aerosol samples were collected once per week for seven weeks in May and June 2017. The NIOSH samplers were stationed on tripods and placed along the corridor outside the open patient bedding area, and one SKC filter cassette was attached to a mobile computer on wheels (COW) used by doctors and nurses during ward rounds. Each sampler was connected to an AirChek\u00ae TOUCH Sample Pump (SKC, Eighty-Four, USA) with Tygon tubing (61 cm length, 0.635 cm diameter) for air collection at a rate of 3.5 L/min. A total of 840 L of air was collected during each four-hour sampling period. Each NIOSH sampler separates collected particles into three aerodynamic diameters: >4\u03bcm, 1-4\u03bcm, and <1\u03bcm. 3 Filter cassettes and sample tubes from the NIOSH samplers were stored at -80\u02daC before processing. Prior to nucleic acid extraction, sample material collected in the 1-4 \u03bcm and <1\u03bcm size fractions were combined (described below).",

Our results illustrate the potential of airborne respiratory viruses to circulate among hospitalized children, nursing staff and visitors. Additionally, we detected respirable virus-laden particles (\u22644\u03bcm in diameter) which are thought to play a significant role in respiratory virus transmission. Aerosol samples testing positive for influenza A virus and adenovirus demonstrates the potential of these viruses to be transmitted via the airborne route. However, we were unable to document the viability of the virus particles and subsequent risk of infection. Additionally, the source of these viruses in the ward is unknown as we did not recruit human subjects nor have access to patient records. Despite previous successful attempts at using the NIOSH twostage sampler and PCR analyses to collect and detect aerosolized influenza A virus, 9, 10 all samples collected using the NIOSH sampler in this study tested negative for influenza A virus. We did capture and detect aerosolized adenovirus using the NIOSH samplers, however, none of the samples from the SKC filter cassettes tested positive for adenovirus. This result is inconsistent with our previous study which successfully recovered adenovirus DNA from aerosol samples collected using the SKC filter cassettes in patient waiting rooms. 11 Sampling sessions in our current study collected 840 L of air using one SKC filter cassette compared to the collection of 900 L of air per each of two SKC filter cassettes in our previous study. Additionally, SKC filter cassettes were mobilized in our current study and stationary in our previous study. The higher sample volumes collected in our previous study as well as the difference in mobility and location of the samplers might explain the difference in positive sample collections among studies.",

Additionally, future studies might involve more comprehensive demographic and clinical risk factor analyses to help us better understand phenomenon such as super-spreading.
