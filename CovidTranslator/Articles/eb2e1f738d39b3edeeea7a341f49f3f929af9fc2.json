Herein we present the synthesis for a series of N1-alkylated uracil derivatives bearing x-(2-benzyland 2-benzoylphenoxy)alkyl substituents as novel NNRTIs. These compounds displayed anti-HIV activity similar to that of nevirapine and several of them exhibited activity against the K103N/Y181C RT mutant HIV-1 strain. Further evaluation revealed that the inhibitors were active against most nevirapine-resistant mono-and di-substituted RTs with the exception of the V106A RT. Thus, the candidate compounds can be regarded as potential lead compounds against the wild-type virus and drug-resistant forms.",

In the USA alone, almost 1.6 million patients require antiretroviral therapy, while in many developing countries this number is an order of magnitude greater. 1 To date 25 antiretroviral drugs have been approved for the treatment of HIV infection using 'highly active antiretroviral therapy' or HAART. 2 These compounds inhibit HIV replication, however their use is often hampered by toxic side-effects over long periods of therapy, as well as a loss of activity when faced with emerging drug-resistant virus strains. As a result, the search for new therapeutics with minimal side-effects and the ability to retain activity against drug-resistant virus strains is regarded as a critical goal for medicinal chemists.",

Since 1996, five NNRTIs (shown in Fig. 1 ) have been approved by the FDA for clinical use: nevirapine (Viramune \u00d2 , Boehringer Ingelheim), delavirdine (Rescriptor \u00d2 , Pharmacia & UpJohn), and efavirenz (Sustiva \u00d2 , DuPont) are classified as first generation NNRTIs, whereas etravirine (Intelence \u00d2 , Tibotec) and rilpivirine (TMC278, Tibotec) are considered as second-generation NNRTIs, since they retain activity against a variety of drug-resistant virus strains. 3 NNRTIs have been reported to bind to a non-nucleoside inhibitor binding pocket in HIV-1 RT (NNIBP), which is located in the 'palm' domain of the p66 subunit at a distance of approximately 10 \u00c5 from the enzyme catalytic site. 4, 5 The pocket is primarily hydrophobic and key amino acid residues involved in inhibitor binding include aromatic (Y181, Y188, F227, W229 and Y232), hydrophobic (P59, L100, V106, V179, F227, L234 and P236) and hydrophilic (K101, K103, S105, D132 and E224) residues in the p66 RT subunit, as well as three additional amino acids (I135, E138 and T139) in the p51 subunit. 3, 6 One major limitation of many NNRTIs however, is the rapid emergence of HIV-1 variants resistant to these drugs due to one or more point mutations in the RT binding site.",

Uracil analogues with various substituents in the C-6 position such as exemplified in scaffold 1 (Fig. 2 ) have proven to be fruitful leads for further development.

Noteworthy that these enzyme preparations had similar activity: when activated DNA was used as template-primer in assay conditions as described in Section 4, p66/p66 and p66/p51 catalyzed incorporation of 0.29, and 0.30 pmol dATP per second per 1 lg of the enzyme, respectively. Nevirapine and efavirenz were used as reference standards ( Table 2) . A preliminary investigation of their mechanism of action was performed with compound 8 in p66/p66/activated DNA assay. It was shown that this compound acted in a non-competitive manner with regards to the dNTP substrate (Fig. S1 ). In addition, the uracil derivative 8 retained its efficacy when the enzymatic reactions were carried out in the presence of heparin, which was added simultaneously with the inhibitor and dNTPs after a short preincubation period of the RT with activated DNA (Fig. S2 ). Since heparin prevents reinitiation of the polymerization reaction, this indicates that the inhibitor only impacts the elongation process of the RT reaction and has no effect on binding of the enzyme to nucleic acids. 34 The inhibition constants (K I ) reflecting the affinity of each compound for RT were assessed using a Dixon plot. 35 Comparison of the results revealed that the compounds displayed similar inhibitory activity in activated DNA (p66/p66) and poly(rC)-oligo(dG) (p66/p51) assays. The correlation (r) between the K I values of the test compounds against HIV-1 RT in these assays was 0.979 (Fig. S3) .

While these data do not directly support the results of the antiviral activity studies, which revealed different resistance susceptibility profiles for the structurally-related benzophenones 17 and 20, it is possible that this difference is due to differences in solubility for some of the compounds in aqueous media, rather than to a different mode of interaction with mutant HIV-RTs.",

Several of the uracil derivatives exhibited potent antiviral activity in infected cell culture and effectively inhibited recombinant HIV-RT. Notably, the compounds did not exhibit toxicity in cell culture, and thus have high selectivity indices. Two of the uracil derivatives effectively inhibited several mutant HIV-1 RTs and also partially retained antiviral activity against several drug-resistant HIV strains. Despite these encouraging results, the poor solubility of some of the compounds hindered true assessment of their potential biological activity. Although the activity levels of the compounds towards wild-type virus and HIV-1 RT were similar to that of nevirapine, they more closely resemble the activity profile of efavirenz by retaining their inhibitory activity towards mutant RT forms resistant to nevirapine. Given the promising and potent antiviral activity exhibited by these compounds, it is clear that the benzophenone-linked uracil scaffold is an excellent lead for the development of additional compounds. As a result, current efforts are underway to improve the solubility of some of the more insoluble compounds in order to design more effective anti-HIV drugs. Those results will be reported elsewhere as they become available.",
