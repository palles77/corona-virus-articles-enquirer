In the UK, an estimated 1.9 million animals are affected by bovine respiratory disease each year costing the UK beef industry approximately \u00a360 million (NADIS, 2007) . Enteric diseases are responsible for more than a half of deaths among pre-weaned dairy calves in the USA and other countries (Gomez and Weese, 2017; Cho and Yoon, 2014; Hur et al., 2013; Azizzadeh et al., 2012) .

Several viruses and bacteria, including mycoplasma are associated with BRDC. The most common viral pathogens associated with BRDC are bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV), bovine parainfluenza virus-3 (BPI-3), bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV), and bovine herpesvirus 1 (BoHV-1). The role of some viruses such as bovine coronavirus (BCoV) and bovine rhinitis A virus, in BRDC pathogenesis, is being increasingly recognized (Murray et al., 2016) . Some of these viral infections alone may not result in any clinical disease, but lead to secondary bacterial infections resulting in severe respiratory disease. Bacterial species that are commonly associated with BRDC are Mannheimia haemolytica, Mycoplasma bovis, Histophilus somni, and Pasteurella multocida (reviewed in Griffin et al., 2010) .",

Establishment of pathogenic infection in the alimentary epithelium leads to secretion, malabsorption or maldigestion leading to enteritis and scours. Among viral agents, group A bovine rotaviruses (BRoV) and enteropathogenic BCoV are the leading causes of diarrhea in young calves (Dhama et al., 2009; Boileau and Kapil, 2010) . Additionally, BVDV and BRoV group B and C are also considered as causative agents of scours. Besides viruses, several bacteria including pathogenic strains of Escherichia coli, Clostridium perfringens, and Salmonella are associated with BED. Eimeria species and Cryptosporidium parvum are the major parasitic protozoans that cause diarrhea in young calves.",

While many of such assays target single pathogens, few assays have been developed for simultaneous detection of multiple pathogens in a single reaction (Vilcek et al., 1994; Decaro et al., 2012; Angen et al., 1998) . These multiplex assays depend on pathogen differentiation based on the size of PCR amplicons, and therefore requires gel-electrophoresis following PCR amplification.",

Conventional microarray requires a substantial amount of manual processing, multiple pieces of equipment for array preparation, and longer time for passive target-probe hybridization. Meanwhile, the new automated electronic microarray platform is rapid, user-friendly, and automates all steps from microarray capture probe printing to all post-PCR processing steps including electronically driven hybridization, washing and reporting (Lung et al., 2012) . Each electronic microarray cartridge consists of 400 individually activated probe binding sites that allow the probe layout to be customizable during each run based on the needs of the end user, in contrast to conventional glass slide microarray, where changes to the array layout is not possible once the arrays are printed. This allows the user to make changes to the detection probe panel if necessary and eliminates anticipation of the future needs before finalizing the array layout, which is the case with conventional microarray slide production. Furthermore, depending on the number of samples to be tested, not all probe binding sites on an electronic microarray cartridge need to be used on the initial run, and unused sites can be used in subsequent sessions (up to 10 times per cartridge). Electronic microarray based assays for detection of several avian, bovine, and swine viruses and bacteria have been described previously (Lung et al., 2012; Lung et al., 2015; Lung et al., 2016) .",

In addition to the pathogen-specific probes, each panel also consisted of a probe specific for the DENV internal control. The selected probes were validated on the NanoChip\u00ae 400 (NC400) electronic microarray platform (Nanogen, San Diego, CA), which is an \"amplicon-to-answer\" system that automates the post-PCR analytical steps i.e. array printing, electrophoretically-driven amplicon hybridization, washing, and reporting (Takahashi et al., 2008; Papatheodorou et al., 2010; Keen-Kim et al., 2006) . The NC400 microarray protocol was carried out as previously described by (Lung et al., 2012) with modifications as described by (Lung et al., 2015) . Briefly, biotinylated capture probes (250 nM) prepared in 50 mM histidine buffer containing 0.05% Proclin, were electronically addressed (\"printed\") to selected electrodes (test sites) in duplicate on the NC 400 cartridge through the application of a positive 350 nA current for 30 s. After five washes of the cartridge with histidine buffer, unpurified PCR amplicons, diluted 1:8 in Cap-Down A Buffer (Nexogen Inc., San Diego, CA), were electronically addressed to selected test sites (800 nA for 120 s). After five more washes with histidine buffer, the cartridge was subsequently filled with low-salt buffer (LSB) (Nexogen Inc.). Hybridized amplicons were detected using 5\u2032-Alexa Fluor 647 modified locked nucleic acid (LNA) variant (5\u2032-/5Alex647 N/TGT + CA + AGCG + AT + AT + ACT + GC-3\u2032) (IDT). The reporting protocol included washing of the microarray cartridge with LSB at 2\u00b0C temperature increments between 24\u00b0C and 60\u00b0C. An image was taken at each temperature increment, and the raw fluorescent intensity (FI) data from all utilized electrodes at each temperature increment were obtained and analyzed using Microsoft Excel. For each probe, positive-to-no-template control (P:N) ratios were calculated by dividing the FI value from each analyte by the FI value produced by the no template control (NTC). For each assay, samples that produced P:N ratios of 2.0 or greater were considered positive. Average P:N data derived from the microarrays were visualized with a heat map generated using Microsoft Excel. Based on preliminary data, P:N ratios calculated using FI values at 50\u00b0C were considered as optimum and used throughout this study.",

The BED primer panel consisted of two sets of BRoV-specific primers, one set targeting 467bp segment of VP6 gene of BRoV type A and C and another set targeting a 584bp segment of the same gene of BRoV type B.

In addition to the pathogen-specific probes, each panel consisted of two control probes, a negative probe and a probe specific for the dengue virus internal control.

Two laboratory isolates of BCoV and BRSV produced an additional PCR product corresponding to the size of BVDV amplicon by RT-PCR and reacted with BVDV detection probes ( Fig. 2a and c) suggesting a possible contamination of the original isolates with BVDV, which was confirmed by subsequent sequencing of PCR amplicons (data not shown). In order to exclude potential contamination of the samples during the assay, the presence of BVDV genomes in the original BCoV and BRSV isolates was confirmed by PCR and sequencing. The source of BVDV contamination in these samples was not investigated but could be non-irradiated fetal bovine serum used in cell culture during virus isolation.",

In contrast, detection of pathogen-specific nucleic acid by PCR-based assays is a rapid, highly sensitive and cost effective alternative method for detection of infectious agents in clinical samples.

However, despite the demonstration of the presence of multiple pathogens, we were unable to reproduce the historically reported detections in a few cases, potentially due to possible sample degradation. While limited access to clinical samples is a hurdle, this highlights the need for use of an adequate number of freshly collected samples for assay validation. BRDC-associated viruses such as BoHV-1, BVDV, and BPI-3 alone can be primary pathogens, and often lead to BRDC of multiple etiologies through immunosuppression and damage to the respiratory epithelium (Srikumaran et al., 2007) . Determination of the non-viral etiological organism(s) of BRDC is often challenging as many of the bacterial agents such as H. somni, P. multocida, M. bovis, M. haemolytica causing BRDC are part of the commensal flora of the upper respiratory tract of cattle (Angen et al., 2009) . These opportunistic microbes increase in numbers and/or migrate to the lower respiratory tract (trachea and lungs) when the host is stressed or immunocompromised due to concurrent viral infections. Although detection of these pathogens in nasal or oral swabs may have less diagnostic value, the presence of these bacteria in tracheal swabs or lung tissues is indicative of their role in BRDC.",

A multiplex PCR assay for detection of five BED-associated viruses, namely BCoV, BRoV (strains A, B, and C) and BToV has been described previously (Fukuda et al., 2012) . In addition to those pathogens, the NC400 BED viral assay could detect and differentiate BVDV 1, 2, and HoBi virus and differentiate Breda virus, which is prevalent in the North America from other toroviruses. E. coli is commensal bacteria in the gut. Therefore, virulence factors associated with pathogenic strains of E. coli have been used to differentiate commensal strains from those that cause disease in calves (West et al., 2007; Sharma and Dean-Nystrom, 2003; Sharma, 2006) . By including a combination of virulence genes that are associated with pathogenic E. coli strains, the NC400 BED viral assay could differentiate pathotypes such as enterohemorrhagic (stx-1+, eaeA+), Enterotoxigenic (Lt+), and enteropathogenic (K99+) E. coli strains from Table 5 Limits of detection of each target used in this study are expressed as the minimum number of target gene copies in 25 \u03bcl PCR volume needed to produce a band visible by gel electrophoresis (detection limit of multiplex PCR) or to produce a reactivity of > 2 PN ratio by electronic microarray (detection limit in electronic microarray). those which are commensal inhabitants of the normal gut microflora. The current assays showed an overall high level of sensitivity for the detection of target pathogens however, when field-derived clinical samples are used, potential PCR inhibitors in the samples may reduce the sensitivity of these assays. When the multiplex assays were combined with microarray detection a slight reduction (1/10 drop) in sensitivity was observed for several targets. However, given the potential high number of target pathogen particles present in clinical samples, the reduced sensitivity observed may not have a significant impact on the performance of these assays. Nevertheless, these assays should be further investigated through a comprehensive clinical validation, before applying to routine diagnostics.",
