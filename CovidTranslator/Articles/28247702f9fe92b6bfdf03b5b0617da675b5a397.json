At about the same time, the global pandemic of ''Spanish '' influenza (1918-1919) provided a devastating example of an event associated with the cyclically re-emerging influenza A virus (Oxford 2000) while, in the years that followed, poliomyelitis configured itself as one of the great emergent epidemic diseases of the twentieth century (Paul 1971) .",

But relatively little is known of the spatial patterns and processes by which such diseases spread to epidemic maturity in human populations (Haggett 1992 (Haggett , 1994 Smallman-Raynor, Cliff, and Haggett 1992) . As a study in the historical geography of disease emergence and reemergence, the present article examines the spatial dynamics of one historically emergent viral disease (poliomyelitis) in the United States during the twentieth century. To capture the changing geographical dimensions of the disease, our examination extends from the first state-level reports of poliomyelitis in the U.S. Public Health Service's Public Health Reports (July 1910) , through the towering epidemics of the 1940s and the 1950s, to vaccine-induced retreat and the consequent cessation of poliomyelitis reporting in the regular statistical tables of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (January 1972) .",

A disease originally considered mildly contagious is now regarded as very contagious-almost as much as measles . . . From an endemic disease it has tended to become epidemic and is now a common and periodic scourge and incidentally an item of great public interest. 1 Poliomyelitis is one of the important emergent viral diseases of the twentieth century. From an apparently rare clinical condition-occurring only sporadically or in small outbreaks prior to the late nineteenth century-poliomyelitis had, by the 1940s and 1950s, emerged as an epidemic disease of global proportions (Christie 1987, 817) . Some impression of the scope and seriousness of the disease can be gained for one country (United States of America) in Figure 1 . At its height, from 1950 At its height, from -1954 , poliomyelitis resulted in the paralysis of some 22,000 U.S. citizens each year, equivalent to an average annual rate of 14.6 per 100,000. Many thousands were left permanently disabled by the disease, while many others suffocated as a consequence of respiratory paralysis (Langmuir 1963) . However, from the mid-1950s, the development and mass administration of first inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) and then, from the early 1960s, oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) effectively curbed disease activity (Paul 1971 ). As Figure 1 shows, by the 1970s, the circulation of wild poliovirus had all but ceased in the United States.",

In the second part of the article, we outline the nature of the poliomyelitis data included in the Public Health Reports and Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, and we describe how the original counts of poliomyelitis were abstracted to form geocoded databases of disease activity in the conterminous United States. In subsequent sections, we use the databases to decipher the patterns and processes by which poliomyelitis spread within the United States at the state level during the periods of epidemic emergence and vaccine-induced retreat.",

There was growing geographical variability in the center of poliomyelitis activity, while a few populous states became the endemic disease reservoirs that fueled periodic nationwide poliomyelitis outbreaks.",

Clinically, poliomyelitis occurs in three main types: abortive, nonparalytic, and paralytic. Abortive poliomyelitis takes the form of a minor illness from three to six days after infection and is characterized by a range of nonspecific symptoms including headache, sore throat, fever, and vomiting. Nonparalytic poliomyelitis occurs as a major illness from nine to seventeen days after infection. Symptoms of the major illness include those of the minor illness (though, typically, in a more severe form), along with stiffness of the neck, back, and legs. Hyperesthesia (heightened sensitivity of the body to sensory stimuli) and paresthesia (abnormal skin sensations, usually arising from peripheral nerve damage) may also be observed. Finally, in paralytic poliomyelitis, paralysis (commonly of the lower limbs but potentially of all major muscle groups) occurs from the first to the tenth day of the major illness. As regards the prognosis for paralytic cases, muscle power may return over a period of about eighteen months following termination of the disease, after which time residual paralysis is usually permanent. Mortality from poliomyelitis is primarily due to suffocation arising from paralysis of the respiratory muscles, although other complications may also result in a fatal outcome. The case fatality rate is of the order of 5-10 percent (Krugman, Ward, and Katz 1977; Christie 1987; Mandell, Bennett, and Dolin, 2000) .",

While several lines of evidence point to the occurrence of poliomyelitis in antiquity (Paul 1971, 10-16) , medical references to the disease prior to the nineteenth century are scanty and are consistent with the circulation of an endemic infection associated with sporadic cases of clinical disease. By the nineteenth century, medical descriptions of apparently small and highly localized outbreaks of infantile paralysis in the South Atlantic island of St. Helena (c.1831-1835) (Bell 1844) 5 and the English town of Worksop (1835) (Badham 1836) provide the earliest documentary evidence for the transition of poliomyelitis to a nascent epidemic state. Reports of similarly localized outbreaks-mostly associated with fewer than thirty clinical cases-began to gain momentum in Europe from the 1880s, with the world's first major epidemics of poliomyelitis erupting in Norway (>900 cases) and Sweden (>1,000 cases) in 1905 (Holt and Bartlett 1908; Batten 1911; Low 1917) . Soon thereafter, further major epidemics (each associated with > 500 recorded cases) were documented elsewhere in Europe-in Vienna and Lower Austria (1908 -1909 ), Germany (1909 , and England and Wales (1911) (Lavinder, Freeman, and Frost 1918, 27-9) .",

As regards the particular experience of the United States, a brief medical note on a cluster of eight to ten cases of infantile paralysis in the parish of West Feliciana, Louisiana, during the fall of 1841 provides the earliest evidence of epidemic transmission in the country (Colmer 1843) . The subsequent record of outbreak activity is summarized for the period to 1910 in Table 1 . As the table shows, a series of generally small and geographically localized outbreaks-centered largely on New York and the neighboring states of New England-were a precursor to the first major epidemic event in the country: the New York City epidemic of 1907 (New York Neurological Society 1910) . All told, the New York epidemic of 1907 was associated with an estimated 2,500 cases (125 deaths) and heralded the recognition of poliomyelitis as a major public health problem in the United States.",

            "text": "Poliomyelitis Emergence Factors-Theories of the mechanisms that may have promoted the epidemic emergence of poliomyelitis in Europe and North America during the early twentieth century are numerous and embrace a range of social, environmental, biological, and demographic considerations (Paul 1955 (Paul , 1971 . While changes in the infectivity and/or virulence of poliovirus, along with increased levels of population mixing, nutritional changes, and nervous system stress have all been posited as having contributed to the emergence complex (Nettleton 2002) , the role of hygiene as a factor in shifting patterns of population exposure and immunity has received particular attention in the literature (Sabin 1949; Paul 1955; Nathanson and Martin 1979) . According to the hygiene model, successive improvements in levels of sanitation during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries would account for a reduced level of faecal exposure to poliovirus in early infancy, thereby reducing the level of latent immunization in the population. Contingent on these developments, Nathanson and Martin (1979, 678) postulate that the appearance of epidemic poliomyelitis resulted from several concomitant changes: 1) a reduction in levels of maternal antibody as booster infections became less common; and 2) a reduction in the frequency of antibody levels sufficient to produce cross-protection between virus types. . . . Both of these developments would reduce the average duration of passive protection of infants. 3) An increase in the average age of primary infections. Together, these changes would drastically increase the proportion of children at risk of a paralytic infection. Further perspectives are provided by Nathanson and Martin (1979) , but, underpinned by progressive developments in sanitation, the hygiene model would account for the gradual development of more sizeable epidemics of poliomyelitis, associated with increasingly older patient cohorts, as the twentieth century progressed (Figure 1 ).",

(1984) provide a useful overview of the scale and timing of the program required to effect mass vaccination. 6 As Figure 1 indicates, the licensing of Salk-type killed or inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) in the United States in 1955 was accompanied by a dramatic reduction in disease incidence. But it was the introduction and mass administration of Sabin-type live (attenuated) oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) in the early 1960s that was to break the chain of wild poliovirus transmission. Following a largescale trial of OPV in Cincinnati in 1960, with further testing and licensing of the vaccine in 1961, the first mass vaccination programs with monovalent OPV were implemented in the counties of Maricopa and Pima, Arizona, in January 1962 (Johns et al. 1963) . As Sabin (1985) notes, such was the appeal of the Arizona plan to county medical societies across the United States that, between 1962 and 1964, some 100 million U.S. citizens were vaccinated with OPV. Thereafter, from 1965, the newly developed trivalent OPV was administered as part of the routine U.S. childhood immunization schedule.",

Here we note that national-level surveillance for poliomyelitis in the United States was initiated by the U.S. Public Health and Marine Hospital Service in the summer of 1910, 9 with the first consolidated table of monthly poliomyelitis cases appearing in the Public Health Reports later that year. 10 6 According to Schonberger et al. (1984, S424) , 7 Between 1980 and the certification of eradication of poliomyelitis in the Americas (1994), a total of 133 confirmed cases of paralytic poliomyelitis were recorded in the U.S. Of these, 125 were associated with the administration of oral poliovirus vaccine, six were classified as imported, and two were of indeterminate origin (CDC 1997b). 8 Our decision to limit the present analysis to the level of state was conditioned by the availability of a near-complete and unbroken series of poliomyelitis counts for the entire period of systematic reporting in the Public Health Reports and Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report. Although both publications do include data on finer spatial scales (large cities/metropolitan areas), analysis of the latter data was precluded by both (i) the fragmentary nature of the available disease record and (ii) statistical instabilities associated with small disease counts in many areas. Finally, although poliomyelitis counts for the nearly 3,100 counties of the U.S. formed the basis of a series of annual maps by Dauer in the 1930s-1950s (see Note 3), a systematic examination of the library and archives of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has failed to yield any evidence of the routine and centralized publication of poliomyelitis data at this spatial scale. Thereafter, the publication of monthly (1910-1926) and, subsequently, weekly (1927-1951) notifications of poliomyelitis continued in unbroken form in the Reports until 1952, when the surveillance function of the journal was transferred to the newly established Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (Anonymous 1952; . The weekly reporting of poliomyelitis cases continued in the latter publication until January 1972, by which time the incidence of the disease-now reduced by routine mass immunization to just a handful of cases each year-was deemed too low to justify the regular publication of poliomyelitis notifications ( Figure 1 ).",

The following month, with state-level counts of poliomyelitis morbidity and mortality for July 1910 now secured, a second communication (dated 20 September 1910) requested the executive officers of the state and territorial boards of health and health departments to forward to the Surgeon-General's Office ''a monthly memorandum of the course of the disease . . . beginning with the month of August [1910] . . . This will be supplemental to and a continuation of the information requested in bureau letter of August 9'' (U.S. Public Health and Marine Hospital Service 1911, 1350). 10. U.S. Public Health and Marine Hospital Service (1911, . 11 The nonconterminous states of Alaska and Hawaii were excluded from the present analysis on account of the fractured nature of the early records of poliomyelitis notifications. 12 In order to reconcile the monthly (1910) (1911) (1912) (1913) (1914) (1915) (1916) (1917) (1918) (1919) (1920) (1921) (1922) (1923) (1924) (1925) (1926) and weekly reporting intervals, cases reported on a weekly basis were assigned to the month in which the last day of the reporting week fell. This technique has been used before in historical studies of infectious diseases (Cliff, Haggett, and Smallman-Raynor 1998a, 117) and has the advantage of providing a simple and unambiguous method for assigning data to a coarser temporal scale. 1946), Nelson and Aycock (1944) , Sabin (1949) , and Serfling and Sherman (1953) ; see also Langmuir (1963) . As Dauer (1946, 919) observes, inter-area comparisons of poliomyelitis statistics are limited by geographical variations in both (1) the completeness of the reporting of severe (paralytic) disease and (2) the extent to which cases of less severe (nonparalytic) disease are included alongside paralytic disease in the official case totals. While midcentury studies placed the reporting completeness of paralytic poliomyelitis at 60-80 percent for some larger U.S. cities (Collins 1946 ) and states (Nelson and Aycock 1944) , the notification of nonparalytic cases has been observed to vary widely by time period and geographical location (Dauer 1943) . 13 Although Dauer (1938 Dauer ( , 1011 expresses the view that such limitations are not sufficiently great to ''seriously interfere'' with the geographical analysis of U.S. poliomyelitis statistics, and Gerende (1949a, 1576) observe that poliomyelitis is ''probably better recorded . . . than many other communicable diseases'' in the United States, all results we present are subject to the caveat of data quality.",

In Period II ; epidemics IV-XXI), a modest amplification in the general level of epidemic activity-albeit far below the experience of 1916-was accompanied by the establishment of a more or less stable (approximately annual) cycle of epidemic events from the early 1930s. Thereafter, Period III (1941) (1942) (1943) (1944) (1945) (1946) (1947) (1948) (1949) (1950) (1951) (1952) (1953) (1954) (1955) ; epidemics XXII-XXXIV) was associated with the development of annual epidemics of almost unprecedented proportions, peaking at 55,825 notifications in the epidemic of -1953 . Finally, with the introduction of mass vaccination, Period IV (1955-1971; epidemics XXXV-XXXIX) was characterized by rapid reduction, leading to extinction, of epidemic activity. As described under Background to Poliomyelitis in the United States, and reiterated here, the growth pattern in Periods I-III reflected the operation of a real epidemiological process (conventionally attributed to improving levels of sanitation) rather than some underpinning shift in the demographic structure of the U.S.",

The maps reveal that the temporal evolution of epidemic poliomyelitis graphed in Figure 1 was associated with a shifting spatial pattern of disease incidence. From an initial focus of high incidence in New York and adjacent states of the northeast in the period prior to U.S. entry into World War I (Figure 2A ), the interwar period was marked by a modest geographical expansion of raised incidence-albeit far below the levels of 1910-1917-to include the Pacific states of California and Oregon ( Figure 2B ). Thereafter, World War II and its aftermath was accompanied by a sharp intensification of disease incidence across the entire United States, with central and western states now forming the epicenter of poliomyelitis activity ( Figure  2C ). Finally, from mid-1955, the introduction of mass poliovirus vaccination was accompanied by a stark, nationwide contraction in levels of poliomyelitis incidence ( Figure  2D ).",

To assist interpretation, the longitudes and latitudes of representative states are indicated on the corresponding graphs, as is the average longitude and latitude of the forty-nine states.

The one notable exception to this general finding relates to the longitude of the poliomyelitis centroid in the two-year period immediately following the introduction of IPV in the mid-1950s. During this brief interval, a discrepancy arises in which the metropolitan-based disease centroid is pulled substantially to the east of the equivalent geographically based disease centroid. One plausible interpretation of this finding is that, in the early years of vaccine administration, IPV-induced reductions in poliomyelitis rates favored the large metropolitan centers of the west over (i) the large metropolitan centers of the east and (ii) the smaller metropolitan and nonmetropolitan areas.",

To examine this question, Pearson's correlation coefficient, r, was used to assess the association between (i) estimates of the (census-defined) urban population of states in each of seven sample years (1910, 1920, . . ., 1970) and (ii) corresponding estimates of the total state population. All population estimates were drawn from the annual editions of the Statistical Abstract of the United States. The analysis yielded a series of uniformly high and positive correlation coefficients, 20 with an average correlation, , of 0.96. As such, the results imply an extremely close association between the U.S. state and urban hierarchies over the 738month observation period. Figure 6 plots, as histograms, the monthly values of the spatial autocorrelation coefficient I for the diffusion graphs corresponding to contagious (6A), hierarchical (6B), and mixed contagious-hierarchical (6C) transmission.

During World War II and its aftermath (December 1941 -May 1955 , the spatial transmission of poliomyelitis was dominated by contagious and mixed contagioushierarchical elements (Table 5) , but with increasing evidence of the operation of purely hierarchical diffusion from the late 1940s ( Figure 6 ). Thereafter, a sharp reduction in the relative importance of contagious and mixed contagious-hierarchical transmission (Table 5) was countered by an increased emphasis on hierarchical transmission in the vaccination era ( Figure 6 ).

Commenting on the national maps of annual poliomyelitis incidence in the years 1933-1937, for example, Dauer (1938 Dauer ( , 1020 observed how the spatial distribution was extremely irregular in several aspects. The regions involved in outbreaks of the disease showed wide variations in extent. In some outbreaks only a few counties were involved, and in other outbreaks there were a larger number. The severity of the disease as evidenced by case rates showed considerable variation from year to year and place to place. For Serfling and Sherman (1953, 461) , spatial patterns of poliomyelitis activity in the twenty-year interval to 1951 were no less enigmatic: Configurations of States swept by epidemics change from year to year as the areas of greatest incidence move from one region to another. Regions swept by an epidemic at one time dissolve into components which re-form in new configurations as a succeeding epidemic wave develops. Only rarely, however, could observers ascribe any logic to the manner in which the spatial configuration and reconfiguration of the epidemic waves came about. 21",

Within the framework of an emerging virus, disease activity in the forty-five years of epidemic intensification ( Figure 1 ) and spatial consolidation ( Figure 2) to 1955 was increasingly driven by a mixed process of (i) spatial transmission between states and (ii) spread from larger to smaller states. The introduction of mass vaccination, however, severed the operation of localized interstate propagation (i) and placed increasing emphasis on hierarchical transmission (ii). This latter development parallels the observed impact of vaccination on the spatial transmission of another virus disease (measles) in the United States (Cliff, Haggett, and Smallman-Raynor 1998b) and is consistent with a simple epidemiological model in which mass vaccination resulted in the geographical retreat of poliovirus to major population reservoirs. In turn, these reservoirs served to reinforce the transmission of poliovirus through the population-size hierarchy (Nettleton 2002) .",

This total is called the critical community size(CCS) or the endemicity threshold (see, e.g., Cliff, Haggett, and Smallman-Raynor 2000, 85-117) . In the absence of vaccination, Eichner and colleagues (1994) have estimated the CCS for poliomyelitis to be of the order of 250,000 (range 50,000-500,000). Studies of the impact of vaccination on the CCS indicate that levels of vaccination coverage required to achieve extinction are positively related to the magnitude of the reservoir population (Griffiths 1973) . As a consequence, the tendency for the more populous states (California, Florida, New York, and Texas) to fall in the lowest category of disease rates in Figure 2D (<0.5 cases per 100,000) may reflect a relatively high vaccination coverage, but of insufficient order to force the CCS above the state-level population. In contrast, the higher levels of clinical disease activity in the less populous states of the Great Plains may be attributed to relatively lower levels of vaccination coverage, but of sufficient order to result in the periodic extinction of wild poliovirus.",

Finally, in the vaccination era (Period IV; June 1955 -December 1971 , the relatively flat line traces in Figure 7D mark the general collapse of epidemic transmission from the early 1960s. Figure 7 is the establishment, between 1910 and mid-1955, when mass vaccination began, of a clearly defined pattern of disease transmission. As the century progressed, elements of contagious and mixed contagious-hierarchical diffusion became firmly established as the dominant mechanisms of spatial propagation at epidemic peaks. Such a development has been documented for other virus diseases (measles and influenza) in temperate settings prior to widespread vaccination (see, e.g., Haggett 1976; Cliff, Haggett, and Ord 1986 ) and may be interpreted as signaling the maturation of poliomyelitis as an epidemic disease in the United States.",

Existing studies of other viral infections have demonstrated that mass vaccination is accompanied by both a decline in disease incidence and a collapse in the spatial structure of epidemic transmission Bolker and Grenfell 1996; Earn, Rohani, and Grenfell 1998) . This has important implications for the control and persistence of disease in vaccinated populations (Grenfell, Bj\u00f8rnstad, and Kappey 2001; Strebel and Cochi 2001) . We have shown that the mass administration of poliovirus vaccines in the United States severed the localized interstate propagation of the disease and caused increased emphasis on hierarchical transmission. This finding parallels the observed impact of mass vaccination upon the spatial transmission of another viral disease (measles) in the United States (Cliff, Haggett, and Smallman-Raynor 1998b) , and it is consistent with the notion of vaccine-induced spatial retreat of poliovirus to the major population reservoirs of the Union.",

Much further work is still required to characterize the origin and progress of each epidemic in Table 3 and to determine levels of similarity in their geographical development. More sophisticated modeling approach-es-of the type described in the present article, but which seek to examine the lag structure of epidemic sequences in space and time (Cliff and Haggett 1988, 203-5) -would also add much to an understanding of the propagation of individual epidemics. Additionally, analyses at finer geographical scales, and of such important early events as the 1907 and 1916 epidemics in New York and the northeastern United States, may provide further clues as to the nature of the mechanisms that underpinned the epidemic emergence of poliomyelitis. 25 Finally, a more general challenge also emerges: to advance the spatial analysis of infectious diseases such that we can better model, predict, and, ultimately, control the processes of epidemic emergence and reemergence in human populations.

The majority of doses of IPV were distributed between 1955 and 1962, with a subsequent switch to MOPV (1962-1964) and TOPV (1965 ff.) as the vaccine of choice. More recently, because of the risk of reversion of attenuated virus to neurovirulence, coupled with a desire to remove all poliovirus from circulation, the U.S. reintroduced IPV (in enhanced potency form) as part of a mixed IPV-OPV routine schedule in 1995. From January 2000, an all-IPV schedule was implemented as the strategy of choice for routine childhood vaccination in the U.S. (see Anonymous 1999; Sutter, Prevots, and Cochi 2000; Swennen and Levy 2001).",
