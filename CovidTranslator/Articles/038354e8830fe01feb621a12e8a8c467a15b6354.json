This symposium provides an annual forum for virologists, vaccinologists, clinicians, pharmacologists, and public health specialists to discuss recent advances in respiratory virus research in an interdisciplinary fashion and summaries of four previous meetings have been published in Antiviral Research (Ison et al., 2002; Kaiser et al., 1999; Munoz et al., 2000; Schmidt et al., 2001) . The spectrum of discussion ranged from basic virology and pathogenesis to epidemiology, immunology, and management strategies, with particular attention to vaccines, antivirals, and economic issues. rors because of a lack of proof reading mechanisms that, in turn, results in the production of quasi-species in most infected individuals. As a consequence of these errors, there is incredible genetic variability that results in continuous antigenic drifts and intermittent antigenic shifts. These shifts have resulted in the introduction of new strains of virus that often resulted in a pandemic (see Table 1 ). Inter-pandemic influenza is responsible for over 20,000 deaths per year in addition to significant morbidity and loss of work (Thompson et al., 2003) .",

            "text": "The most important pandemic of the past century was the Spanish Influenza pandemic of 1918. The virus infected 28% of all Americans and resulted in 675,000 deaths in the US alone. The death rate among young adults, aged 15-34 years, was 20 times higher than in previous years and depressed the life expectancy of Americans by more than 10 years. The pace and severity of the pandemic is best documented in its history in New Zealand. On 12 October 1918, several members on board the SS Niagara became ill with influenza. Since the boat was carrying Prime Minister Massey, the Minister of Health failed to enforce a quarantine on the boat. As a result, influenza infected much of the city of Auckland, such that by the first week in November it was dubbed the \"City of the Dead\" and had resulting breakdown of civil services. By November 12, there were two full death trains per day to carry the dead out of the city. Like the US, the mortality rate was highest among people aged 20-44 years. Interestingly, the Maori had a higher death rate (43.3/1000) than Europeans (7.6/1000), a finding that suggests prior exposure to influenza may have minimized mortality. Jeffrey Taubenberger has sequenced the HA, NA, NS, M, and NP genes of the 1918 Spanish influenza virus and found that it is closely related to swine H1N1. Unfortunately, the molecular basis of the high pathogenicity of this virus is still unknown. Likewise, it is unclear if the virus, the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase genes of which derived 1977-present No from an avian influenza virus, directly infected man and then infected pigs or if pigs served as an intermediate host.",

In these wild aquatic birds, influenza virus replicates predominately in the intestinal tract and transmission via the fecal-oral route, often through water. There are a limited number of host-specific lineages of influenza viruses in birds and there is a geographical separation into Eurasian and American lineages. Influenza viruses in their natural avian reservoir are in evolutionary stasis, but rapid evolution occurs after transmission to new hosts.",

Acquisition of avian influenza genes by swine influenza viruses has been documented in H1N1 isolates in Europe, H4N6 in Canada, and H9N2 in China, although these latter two instances were transitory. In the United States, H3N2 viruses became a problem in pigs in 1998 when the infection was associated with respiratory signs, high fever (104-107 \u2022 F), high morbidity (100%), and high risk of abortion. The responsible viruses were highly transmissible and resulted in variable mortality. Interestingly, analysis of three of the porcine H3N2 viruses revealed that the virus has undergone triple reassortment and had acquired human PB1, HA, and NA genes, porcine NP, M, and NS genes, and avian PA and PB2 genes. There is growing evidence, too, that H1N1 swine influenza A viruses are acquiring avian polymerase genes as well.",

            "text": "Although pigs appear to be an important reservoir and mixing pot for potential human influenza viruses, the chicken H5N1 and H9N2 viruses that have recently emerged in Asia suggest chickens may also be an important intermediary. In 1997, a reassortant H5N1 virus containing H5 Goose/Guangdong/1/96-like HA and other genes from H9N2 Quail/HK/G1/97-like and H6N1 duck/HK/W312/97like viruses began circulating in chickens. The virus was transmitted to 18 humans and resulted in six deaths. Patients who became infected had high fevers, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and pneumonia in addition to alterations in hepatic and renal function. Fortunately there was no human-to-human transmission and the outbreak was halted by the massive slaughter of all poultry in the region. Additional studies of the local chicken market demonstrated that when H5N1 virus infected a chicken it resulted in its death, while chickens co-infected with H9N2 viruses were protected from illness but efficiently shed H5N1. The H5N1 virus still appears to be a problem with re-emergence of a different H5N1 virus in 2001; fortunately an outbreak of human infections was prevented by the massive slaughter of chickens again. Unfortunately, multiple different lineages of H5N1 viruses, all with the Goose/Guangdong HA are still present in local chickens. [Editorial note: In February 2003 infections with an avian influenza A/H5N1 virus resulted in two deaths in a Hong Kong family that visited southern China. During the current influenza season, avian influenza A/H5N1 has again caused disease and death throughout Asia.] Upon further investigation of these H5N1 outbreaks in chickens and humans, it became clear that quail might play a significant role in interspecies transmission of influenza viruses. It appears that quail acquire infection from fecal sources and then replicate virus in their respiratory tract with evidence of tracheal shedding of virus. The outbreaks in chickens were associated with the reintroduction of H6N1 and H9N2-infected quail into the markets. To address the concerns that quail are intermediates in the transmission of influenza, quail have been banned from all poultry markets in Hong Kong. In addition, ducks and geese, which have been recognized in the past as reservoirs for influenza viruses, are imported separately from all other poultry and are killed and sold chilled instead of the previous practice of selling them live. Finally, all markets are emptied and cleaned monthly with the hopes of reducing transmission of influenza among the poultry.",

Clinical experience has documented that H5N1 virus kills all chickens it infects, unless there is coinfection with H9N2 viruses. Likewise, the virus is neurovirulent in mice and ferrets. In humans, mortality is high and post-mortem examination in two individuals found very high cytokine levels. Several studies subsequently documented that the NS1 protein of the H5N1 was an antagonist of the antiviral activity of several cytokines (Seo et al., 2002) . Genetic comparison of the NS1 gene of H5N1 viruses from 1997 and 2001 and other human, avian, swine, and equine viruses identified a single Asp92Glu mutation in the virulent H5N1 viruses. Using reverse genetics, it was found that infection due to the viruses with the mutation resulted in greater viral shedding and symptoms in pigs and lacked inhibition of replication typically induced by cytokines in vitro. Furthermore, in-vitro infection of human primary macrophages with H5N1/97 virus up-regulated expression of mRNA encoding TNF-\u2423, IFN-\u2424, IL-1\u2424, MCP-1, MIP-1\u2423/\u2424, RANTES, IFN-\u2423, and IL-12 and caused increased elaboration of pro-inflammatory cytokines.",

One of the major advances is the multi-plasmid reverse genetics system for influenza. This system allows scientists to make influenza viruses to order, to rapidly prepare high growth reassortants for vaccines, to rapidly prepare subtype-specific vaccines for pandemic preparedness, and to better understand the molecular basis of virulence and host range of the virus. Unfortunately, powerful technique brings several challenges. Since it is so easy to make reassortant viruses, it could be possible to create viruses with several pathogenic genes or viruses that are highly resistant to antivirals resulting in highly transmissible and lethal agents that could be used as agents of bioterrorism. In this regard, dangerous constructs need to be contained within BSL3+ level facilities, limiting the number of centers that can study them.",

Hydrophilicity plots of the F revealed two hydrophobic regions with similarity to APV and RSV. The G protein has five glycosylation sites. There appear to be two genetic and serotypic clusters of hMPV with two subclusters of each cluster (A1, A2, B1, B2). (Guy Boivin, Laval University, Qu\u00e9bec, Canada) A new paramyxovirus, the human metapneumovirus (hMPV), has been recently isolated from Dutch children with respiratory symptoms (van den Hoogen et al., 2001) . However, the prevalence, clinical presentation, and severity of hMPV infections in children have not been well studied. A multiplex real-time PCR assay was used to detect viral pathogens (influenza A, influenza B, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and hMPV) in nasopharyngeal aspirates of hospitalized children (0-3 years) with acute respiratory tract infections (ARTI) during then 2001-2002 winter and spring seasons. Children hospitalized for surgery without respiratory symptoms were used as controls. hMPV was detected in 5.8% of the 208 children hospitalized for ARTI, compared to 51% for RSV and 21.6% for influenza A; no virus was detected in 29.8% of symptomatic patients and 6.8% had more than one pathogen including one case of coinfection with hMPV and influenza A. None of the viruses were detected in 51 controls. Most RSV and influenza infections occurred in January-February, whereas peak hMPV activity was seen in March-April 2002. Overall, the clinical presentation and complications associated with hMPV infection were very similar to those caused by RSV (fever 67% versus 57%, cough 100% versus 99%, rhinorrhea 92% versus 91%, and wheeze 92% versus 95% for hMPV and RSV, respectively). hMPV was associated with bronchiolitis in 66.7%, otitis media in 50%, and pneumonia in 16.7% of infected children; no hMPV children were sick enough to require admission to an intensive care unit. Mean hospital stays were 5.5, 5.8, and 5.0 days for children infected with hMPV, RSV, and influenza A. Although severe hMPV infections are less frequent than those caused by hRSV, the clinical presentation of the two viral pathogens is virtually identical. Dr. Boivin also discussed an outbreak investigation in which there appears to be a nosocomial outbreak of hMPV in a nursing home, giving further information about the impact of this new virus. In summary, hMPV is a true respiratory pathogen associated with significant morbidity in children.",

(Robert Couch, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX) Multiple respiratory viruses can be detected sometimes in patients with respiratory tract illness. In various studies, the frequency of dual infection has ranged from 0 to 40% of virus-infected patients, with most studies documenting dual infections in 0-10% of patients. The frequency of dual infection appears to be higher in children than adults. The types of diagnostic techniques utilized greatly impacts the detection of viruses. In a study of 4336 adult patients, many with underlying lung disease, who developed 1341 respiratory infections, dual infection was documented in 1.9% of patients when cell culture alone was used, 8.1% when serology was added to culture, and 11.6% when RT-PCR was added to the previous two techniques (Drews et al., 1997) . The most frequently isolated viruses from patients with dual infections included picornaviruses (n = 33), influenza A (28), coronaviruses (22), RSV (21), adenoviruses (12), parainfluenza viruses (12), and influenza B (7). The three most common combinations were picornaviruses with influenza A (n = 10), cornoavirus (10), and adenovirus (7) (Drews et al., 1997) . During the question and answer period, Sebastian Johnston reported that in his study of respiratory viral illnesses in children with a history of wheezing: 15% of patients had dual infections and 5% with triple infections during exacerbations.",

In volunteers who were co-inoculated with HRV 15 and another picornavirus (simultaneous infection) or infected with a picornavirus approximately 2 weeks after initial HRV 15 infection (sequential infection), those infected with two viruses simultaneously had no difference in virus shedding or disease severity, whereas those who had sequential infection had reduced virus shedding and disease severity, in comparison to volunteers only infected with HRV15 (Fleet et al., 1965) . The exact mechanism for this reduction of viral shedding and symptom severity is not known but transient immunity from the previous infection may contribute to the effect. In children presenting with lower respiratory illness with RSV alone or in combination with another respiratory virus, some studies did not find differences in the severity or duration of the illness, but two studies documented increased severity of symptoms and one documented increased duration of illness (Andreoletti et al., 2000; Cate et al., 1964; Meissner et al., 1984; Papadopoulos et al., 2002a; Portnoy et al., 1966; Ray et al., 1993; Smith et al., 1980; Subbarao et al., 1989; Tristram et al., 1988; Tsai et al., 2001) . Preliminary data from Dr. Johnston's study also documented a clear increase in severity of the asthma exacerbation with increasing number of infecting viruses. Although not well controlled for in these studies, the timing of infection and the type of viruses likely impact the duration and severity of illness. Available information is insufficient for firm conclusions on the illness consequences of dual respiratory viral infections, and future studies should be address the relationships between illness severity and etiology, time course, and quantitative virology of dual infections.",

Several recent studies have expanded on our understanding of the epidemiology of RVIs and their relationship to asthma exacerbations. In unpublished studies, the presenter's group performed viral culture and PCR for RSV and human rhinoviruses (hRV) on nasal aspirates from 80 children aged 0-16 years who were hospitalized with upper respiratory tract illness (URTI) and wheezing. Ninety-six percent of children under 2 years of age were positive for one of the two viruses (80% RSV, 40% rhinovirus, 20% dual infection), while 80% of children 2 years and older had detectable virus (66% rhinovirus).

Peter Sly, Patrick Holt, and Merci Kusel, enrolled 263 newly born infants who had at least one parent with physician-diagnosed atopic disease. All acute respiratory illnesses were recorded during the first year of life and home visits by a study nurse were arranged within 24 h of onset of illness for assessment of symptoms and collection of nasal aspirates. Two control visits were done when the child was asymptomatic. During the first 6 months of life and subsequent 6 months, 59 and 86% of the children, respectively, developed an upper respiratory tract illness (URI). Non-wheezy lower respiratory tract illness (LRI) developed in 28 and 52% of children during the first and subsequent 6 months, respectively, and wheezy LRIs developed in 10 and 26%, respectively. Among the first 656 samples from July 1996 to February 1998 (369 ARI, 260 controls), 19% of the controls were positive (11% picornavirus, 8% RSV) compared to 65% of the ARI samples (55% picornavirus, 10% RSV, and 3% with dual infection). Among those with URI, 84% had picornaviruses, 11% had RSV, and 5% had dual infections; non-wheezing LRI was associated with picornavirus detection in 74%, RSV in 23%, and dual infection in 3%; wheezing LRI was associated with picornavirus in 70% of cases, RSV in 22%, and dual infection in 8%. The ratio of URI to LRI was 1.9:1 for picornavirus and 1:1 for RSV. Although RSV is perhaps more likely to be associated with severe lower respiratory tract illness, these data indicate that rhinoviruses are major respiratory pathogens during the first year of life and cause about three times as many LRIs in the first year of life as RSV in non-hospitalized infants. The specific picornavirus that cause these illnesses remain to be identified. Further PCR tests for coronaviruses, influenza A and B, parainfluenza viruses 1-3, adenoviruses, hMPV, Mycoplasma pneumonia, and Chlamydia pneumoniae are in progress.",

Adenoviruses are responsible for 5-10% of the cases of pediatric acute respiratory infections (ARI) that require hospitalization. Nosocomial outbreaks of adenovirus respiratory infection are frequently reported. The adenovirus virion consists of a non-enveloped icosohedral capsid enclosing a double-stranded DNA genome of approximately 36,000 bp. The human adenovirus family currently comprises 51 serotypes that are classified into six species (formerly subgenera), A-F, based on their genomic characteristics, tropism, associated disease and other biological properties. Respiratory disease is mainly caused by adenovirus serotypes classified within subspecies B1 (Ad3, Ad7, Ad16, Ad21, Ad50), species C (Ad1, Ad2, Ad5, Ad6), and species E (Ad4). Among the most prevalent serotypes associated with human respiratory disease, adenovirus type 7 (Ad7) is a frequent cause of severe clinical presentations in children and young adults, in whom it causes epidemics of acute febrile respiratory illness among military recruits (Ryan et al., 2002) . Extrapulmonary manifestations, rare fatalities, and residual lung damage are observed in association with Ad7 infection (Becroft, 1967; Steen-Johnsen et al., 1969) . Affected patients surviving severe disease may have chronic sequelae in the form of bronchiectasis, bronchiolitis obliterans and hyperlucent lung (Murtagh and Kajon, 1997) .",

Over the last two decades reports of molecular epidemiological studies of Ad7 infection have shown that certain genome types predominate in an area for long periods of time and then are replaced by a new genome type. The molecular bases of these substitutions of one genome type for another, called genome type \"shifts\", and the selective forces driving adenovirus evolution in nature are unknown. Moreover, the impact of genetic variability on adenovirus virulence is poorly understood. A shift from Ad7c to Ad7b occurred in Europe in 1969 and in Australia in 1975 (Wadell et al., 1985 . A shift from Ad7b to Ad7d occurred in China between 1965 and 1980 (Li et al., 1996 , and a shift from Ad7c to Ad7h took place in the South America (Argentina, Chile and Uruguay) in 1986 (Kajon and Wadell, 1994) . Ad7b is still the most prevalent genome type isolated in Europe and North America and Ad7h is still recovered from the nasopharyngeal secretions of children hospitalized for ARI in the South America, observations suggesting an adaptive advantage of their array of genes over the preceding prevalent genome type in the region. Interestingly, Ad7h has been recently detected in the United States and Japan in association with respiratory illness and in Brazil in association with acute conjunctivitis, findings that suggest a recent introduction and dissemination of this virus from previously geographically restricted areas of circulation. Ad7d 2 , originally reported to circulate in China and later on in Japan and Israel, has been identified in recent outbreaks of ARI in the United States affecting children and military trainees Gerber et al., 2001) .",

Recently, certain genes of the virus have been sequenced to help determine those responsible for its virulence. Reverse genetics has been used to create viruses with an influenza A/WSN background, that contain genes from the 1918 strain or more contemporary strains. In a recent experiment, conducted in a BSL4 laboratory, three viruses were created: a wild-type WSN virus, a WSN virus with 1918 HA and NA genes, and a WSN virus with 2001 HA and NA genes. In mice the LD 50 for the 2001 HA/NA virus was >10 5 , compared to 10 3.1 for both the wild type and 1918 HA/NA viruses. Lung titers of infected mice were higher in the wild-type (10 6.4 ) and the 1918 HA/NA viruses (10 6.1 ) than in the 2001 HA/NA virus (10 4.1 ). The degree of lung inflammation was most severe, with evidence of significant hemorrhage, in mice infected with the 1918 HA/NA virus and least with the 2001 HA/NA virus. Viral antigen was distributed differently in the lungs for the three viruses at day 6. The WSN wild-type virus was predominant in the bronchioles; the 1918 HA/NA virus had evidence of diffuse involvement of the pulmonary parenchyma; the 2001 HA/NA virus had minimal staining of the lower airways. Lastly, another recombinant virus was constructed with the A/Memphis/8/88 (H3N2) background. The wild-type virus was non-lethal in mice, but the virus with 1918 HA and NA genes was uniformly lethal. Such findings indicate that HA and NA of the 1918 virus are linked in part to its virulence in mammalian hosts.",

Antibodies have been tested in residual blood samples of patients before and after 1918. High levels of antibodies directed against the 1918 HA are present in blood in patients born before 1918 but generally not after. The concept of original antigenic sin, in which humans exposed or vaccinated to influenza will produce higher antibodies against the first virus they were exposed to than against subsequent viruses, may explain this finding. In turn, this could partly explain why older patients may have been relatively protected relative to younger individuals during the 1918 pandemic.",

            "text": "Another question that has recently been answered, although the significance of it is still under investigation, is how the virus is packaged. Analysis of the genes of influenza documented that all 8 segments of influenza A have conserved, non-coding regions at both ends. Several studies were then conducted to determine if segment incorporation was random or selective. First, viruses with 6, 7, and 8 segments were created to assess the efficiency of virion production. In cell culture, virus replication was greatest when all 8 segments were present and least when only 6 were present. Next, reverse genetics was used to create two viruses, one had the NA gene replaced with the gene for green florescent protein (GFP) with the conserved non-coding flanking base pairs (NCFBP) before and after (NCFBP-GFP-NCFBP) and another in which the GFP was flanked by NCFBP and the NA gene (NCFBP-NA-GFP-NA-NCFBP). In the GFP only segment, only 0.1% of infected cells made GFP as compared to 91% of the NA-GFP segment. This suggests that, although the NCFBP is required, the coding region, in this case NA, is required for incorporation into new virions. Additional studies documented that this virion incorporation signal (VIS), which frequently contained UAU coding regions, was unique for each segment. The genes for the HA, NP, and M require VIS at both ends while the NA and NS genes only require a VIS at the 3 end. Lastly, the packaging of segments within the virion was assessed through electron microscopy, which demonstrated that there is likely an interaction between base pairs on each of the segments that results in the segments aligning with one another in a fixed way (Fujii et al., 2003) . These interactions require greater study as this is a potential target for drugs or vaccines of the future.",

            "text": "The ability to recover infectious respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and parainfluenza viruses (PIV) serotypes 1, 2 and 3 from cloned cDNAs, a technique called \"reverse genetics\", offers a new approach to developing live attenuated vaccines. The main challenge in creating a potential live vaccine is to develop a virus that is both highly and stability attenuated while maintaining a satisfactory level of immunogenicity. Reverse genetics have be used to achieve this goal by creating an array of potential mutations, fine tuning the level of attenuation, increasing the immunogenicity of the virus, and decreasing its reactogenicity. RSV and the PIVs have modular genome organizations (3 -N-P-M-F-HN-L-5 for the PIVs and 3 -NS1-NS2-N-P-M-SH-G-F-M2-L-5 for RSV) and short cis-acting RNA signals that make for viruses that are highly amenable to genetic manipulation. Vaccine candidates for RSV (strain A2 of subgroup A) had previously been developed by conventional biological means, involving passage at suboptimal temperature (\"cold passage\" [cp]) followed by chemical mutagenesis and the identification of temperature sensitive (ts) derivatives. Several of these strains were evaluated clinically and one, called cpts248/404, was shown to be infectious, immunogenic, and protective against a second vaccine dose in 1-2-month-old infants, the target age for RSV vaccination. However, it retained the ability to cause mild nasal congestion and thus would require further attenuation. This proved unfeasible by conventional methods. These viruses were sequenced and their mutations were identified and the phenotype conferred by each was confirmed by incorporation into wild type recombinant virus, providing a list of known attenuating mutations. This list was expanded by finding that a number of RSV genes, including NS1, NS2, SH and M2-2, could be deleted to yield derivatives that proved to be attenuated in vivo. This new knowledge was applied to reverse genetics to create two new viruses, 248/404/ SH and 248/404/1030/ SH, the second of which shows promise in early clinical trials and appears to be free of residual virulence. Other viruses are being developed that contain some of the more highly-attenuating gene deletions, or which contain various combinations of gene deletions and point mutations. Reverse genetics also can be used to increase gene stability to prevent reversion by incorporating multiple point mutations, by designing amino acid substitutions to involve at least two nucleotide changes compared to assignments yielding wild type or wild type-like phenotypes, and by employing gene deletions. Further investigation suggests that moving the G and F genes to a more proximal location in the genome results in increased efficiency of G and F expression and enhanced immunogenicity. Likewise, deletion of the M2-2 ORF, a putative regulatory factor, resulted in a shift in RNA synthesis from RNA replication to transcription, with concomitant increased antigen expression. It might also be possible to reduce the reactogenicity of an RSV vaccine using strategies developed from immunobiological studies: one example would be to ablate the secreted form of G, which has been implicated in preferential sensitization of Th2 T lymphocytes. Reverse genetics also was used to create RSV subgroup B vaccine candidates by replacing the G and F protective antigen genes of RSV subgroup A vaccine candidates with their subgroup B G and F counterparts.",

A promising hPIV3 vaccine candidate, cp45, had previously been developed by the conventional approach of cold passage. Nucleotide sequencing identified 15 potential attenuating mutations, which were characterized by reverse genetics: the major attenuating mutations were found to involve three ts mutations in L and three non-ts mutations in C and F. Reverse genetics was used to develop additional means of attenuation, which included silencing the C, V and D open reading frames as well as the novel strategy of \"importing\" mutations into hPIV3 from corresponding genes in heterologous viruses using amino acid sequence alignments to identify corresponding residues. Bovine (b)PIV3 represents a completely different vaccine strategy, one that is based on the finding that bPIV3 is antigenically related to hPIV3 but is naturally attenuated in primates. This is a \"Jennerian\" strategy, analogous to the use of cowpox virus as a vaccine against small pox. This strategy was improved by using reverse genetics to construct a version of bPIV3 in which the F and HN major antigenic determinants were replaced by their hPIV3 counterparts, thus providing for fully homologous immunity against hPIV3. This chimeric virus retained the attenuation phenotype and represents a promising vaccine candidate. The basis for the host range restriction of bPIV3 was investigated by the replacement of individual genes in hPIV3 with their bPIV3 couterpart. This showed that most of the bPIV3 genes made individual contributions to the attenuation phenotype. This suggests that a vaccine based on the attenuated bPIV3 backbone should be very stable. It also indicated that the introduction of individual bPIV3 genes into hPIV3 is an additional strategy for attenuation, one that is now being pursued with a version of hPIV3 containing the bPIV3 N gene. Reverse genetics also is being applied to hPIV1 and hPIV2, for which no live vaccine candidates are presently available and for which there are no attenuated animal virus counterparts as potential Jennerian vaccines. Here, the strategy of \"importing\" mutations, in particular from RSV and hPIV3, has been particularly useful and has resulted in the development of a number of attenuating mutations that will serve as the basis for live hPIV1 and hPIV2 vaccines.",

One multivalent candidate used the above-mentioned bPIV3/hPIV3 chimeric virus as a vector for the RSV F and G genes. This virus thus combines two vaccines into one. Importantly, the PIV3 backbone replicates in cell culture more efficiently and expresses higher levels of protein than RSV, and avoids the physical instability that is characteristic of RSV. This chimeric vaccine exhibited satisfactory levels of attenuation and immunogenicity against hPIV3 and RSV when evaluated in Rhesus monkeys, and will be developed for clinical evaluation. The availability of PIV vectors expressing RSV antigens offers a novel approach for the immunization or, alternatively, provides an efficient method of \"boosting\" an initial vaccination made by a live RSV virus. It is anticipated that these methods will result in the development of live vaccines against RSV and hPIV3, which preferably would be given in the first weeks of life, and against hPIV1 and hPIV2, which cause disease somewhat later during the first year of life such that vaccination could begin at 6 months of age. (Kevin L. Russell, Navel Health Research Center, San Diego, CA) Infections caused by influenza and adenovirus are not only common among military personnel but also make them less prepared for battle. The current threat of bio-warfare, in addition to availability of anti-influenza drugs for prevention and treatment, makes the rapid identification of these pathogens essential to medical personnel and the military.

All of the plans have been based on the WHO phases as outlined on the Global Agenda on Influenza (http://www.who.int/influenza) which outlines four major areas with 17 associated priority activities. Guidelines for vaccines have been developed, but there is widespread concern that vaccine production will lag behind needs. The WHO hopes to increase the awareness of the importance of pandemic planning and the development of national pandemic plans. Likewise, the WHO is hoping to increase utilization of vaccines and antivirals and to develop strate-gies to acquire and utilize new vaccines and antivirals. Lastly, the WHO is advocating for additional research on pandemic viruses. These efforts are being heard, as a recent G7+ Round meeting to discuss bioterrorism set aside time for discussion of influenza pandemic planning.

The goals of this Working Group were to develop a plan to limit the burden of disease, minimize social disruption, and reduce economic loss during an influenza pandemic. These goals are to be met through three objectives: improving surveillance, response, and infrastructure. Several actions have been proposed to strengthen national and global capabilities for virologic and disease surveillance with a view to increasing the likelihood of early detection of viruses with pandemic potential. First, the WHO Global Influenza Surveillance network, with 112 sites in 80 countries and 4 collaborating centers in Atlanta, London, Melbourne, and Tokyo will have to be expanded and improved. Increased collaboration between the WHO and CDC in the form of laboratory and epidemiology training has taken place during the past decade. Animal influenza surveillance is also being enhanced through collaborations between NIH, WHO and other partners. CDC has worked with states to expand the Sentinel Physicians Network such that it currently includes over 1400 physicians in 47 states and the District of Columbia. Work is ongoing to establish a system to monitor hospitalized cases of influenza and to further facilitate the transfer of technology via training and reagent distribution. The US Department of Defense surveillance sites also contribute to global influenza surveillance.",

Research on influenza biology and epidemiology, animal surveillance, and vaccine and antiviral development has been and will continue to be supported by NIH through grants to academic researchers and through grants that support public-private partnerships. Development of cell culture-based vaccines and the testing in humans of candidate pandemic vaccines made using reverse genetics or classical reassortment techniques should be encouraged. There is also a need to test adjuvanted vaccines and to develop new antiviral agents. It is noteworthy that there are currently only two influenza vaccine manufacturers licensed to distribute vaccine in the US for the 2003-2004 influenza season. It is also noteworthy that 80-90% of produced vaccine is purchased privately, and it takes nearly a full year from the time of selection of strains to the production of usable vaccine. As a result, it will be essential to encourage new vaccine manufacturers and new approaches, including reverse genetics to prepare seed strains, in addition to developing and implementing a vaccine policy that ensures adequate and fair procurement and distribution of the vaccine during an influenza pandemic. Such policies will need to take into account liability protection and equitable global access. Finally, identifying appropriate antiviral drugs to stockpile and developing plans to prioritize use of these antivirals are necessary for pandemic preparedness.",

If it is an influenza A (H2N2)-like virus, people over the age of 35 years (approximately 40% of the world's population) are likely to have been immunologically primed by past infection and will require only one 'booster' dose of vaccine. If the virus is entirely new, no one will have been primed and everyone will probably require two doses. Moreover, because the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of vaccinating not only older adults but also younger adults and children is widely appreciated, health officials in many countries may choose to vaccinate most, if not all of their populations.

            "text": "(1) When a pandemic threat appears, there will be delay in preparing seed strains for vaccine production. This might be overcome by using reverse genetics to prepare these seed strains. In principle, reverse genetics could be used to prepare high-growth variants for efficient production. This may be essential if the pandemic virus is of avian origin because many of these viruses grow poorly (or not at all) in embryonated eggs, the culture system used for all current influenza vaccine production. As long as issues regarding the worker safety and the intellectual property rights attached to reverse genetics can be sorted out beforehand, this promising technique could be the key factor for ensuring adequate production of pandemic vaccine. (2) Whether the pandemic threat is due to a re-emergent (A/H2-like) or novel (e.g. A/H5-like) virus will determine not only the kind of vaccine that should be produced but also whether one or two doses will be required. Every effort must be made to determine the minimal antigenic content of a dose that is acceptably immunogenic. Studies conducted many years ago indicated that whole cell vaccines were more immunogenic than split virus or subunit preparations of similar antigenic content. Moreover, recent studies have shown that an adjuvanted vaccine will probably be needed for at least the first if not both doses. These studies need to be extended in a larger series of clinical trials of candidate 'pandemic-like' vaccines. The trials must be publicly funded and designed to determine the optimal characteristics of a pandemic vaccine and vaccination schedule. (3) Current regulatory requirements will delay the registration of pandemic vaccines. In Western Europe, immunogenicity studies must be undertaken by vaccine companies each year in order to register their products. Such trials are costly and time consuming, and they are not required in North America or Australia. Moreover, there is widespread international trade in influenza vac-cines in inter-pandemic years. For the next pandemic, such trade is likely to be much more extensive. If pandemic vaccines are to be delivered quickly to the countries where they are needed most, a global protocol will be required that will allow the pandemic vaccine produced by any company to be registered for use in any country of the world. The need for a protocol for the global registration of pandemic vaccines should be considered before the next pandemic threat appears. (4) Countries will be better prepared for the next pandemic if they can increase their use of influenza vaccine in inter-pandemic years. This was started by the Canadian province of Ontario in 2000, when it extended its recommendation for influenza vaccine to all people over 6 months in age. One reason for instituting this program was to be better prepared for a pandemic. Health officials can help prepare for the next pandemic by expanding their influenza vaccination recommendations and extending their programs for public reimbursement for vaccination in inter-pandemic years. (5) The traditional market approach for providing interpandemic vaccine will not be able to meet the global demand for pandemic vaccine. Although many vaccine companies are expanding their production facilities, it is still difficult for them to estimate future demand for inter-pandemic and pandemic vaccines. This is unlike the situation for pediatric vaccines for which precise estimates of the size of future target populations are well known. One way to overcome uncertainty about future demand for influenza vaccines would be to: (a) obtain country-specific data on the number of doses of influenza vaccine distributed each year by each vaccine company and rapidly report the total number of doses distributed per 1000 population in all countries; and (b) obtain 5-year rolling forecasts of the demand for inter-pandemic and pandemic vaccine from health officials in each country. The availability of such past and future information would challenge health officials to make more comprehensive plans for vaccination programs and help companies make more realistic plans for vaccine production. (6) Political leaders in most vaccine-producing countries will probably prohibit the export of domestically produced pandemic vaccine to other countries until they are certain their national needs have been met. As a result, countries that do not have vaccine companies, including many that currently use large amounts of vaccine in inter-pandemic years, may find it difficult or impossible to obtain supplies of pandemic vaccine. To prevent this from happening, international political agreements must be negotiated beforehand that ensure adequate production and equitable distribution of pandemic vaccines to both vaccine-producing and non-producing countries. The European Commission has begun doing this for Europe. Something similar needs to be done for the entire world.",

(Peter Wright, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN and Ruth Karron, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD) Rapid diagnostic tests for respiratory viral illness has become an increasingly important tool because of the advent of effective antiviral agents that are maximally effective if started early in the course of the illness, the need to isolate patients who could pass their infection to other ill patients, and the need to differentiate between these viral illnesses and other respiratory tract pathogens, including bioterrorism agents. However, currently available rapid testing has many limitations. Areas of improvement that need to be addressed include the ability to test for all or most know agents, improved collection methods, improved integration of diagnosis with use of medications and clinical care, use of diagnostics for epidemiology and vaccine development, increased sensitivity in adults and immunocompromised patients, and improved ease and accuracy of testing.",

There are significant limitations of these tests including sensitivities and specificities that are dependent on the quality of the sample collected, the timing of the illness, the intensity of the epidemic, and the population tested. These assays have been developed to allow for sentinel surveillance, although their positive predictive values are limited at the beginning and end of epidemics (see below). In addition, rapid testing helps to identify patients who may benefit from antiviral agents and to decrease the use of antibiotics and shorten the duration of hospitalizations. The available rapid tests for RSV and their respective characteristics have been reviewed elsewhere recently (Caliendo, 2002) . Rapid testing for influenza uses three major methods: fluorescent antibodies (FA) and other antigen detection techniques, neuraminidase detection, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). FA testing is rapid with a turn-around-time (TAT) of 20 min to 2 h. Unfortunately, it requires intact cells in the collected fluid, an expert reader, and a fluorescent microscope. It is able to distinguish between influenza A and B and has a sensitivity of 92-99% and a specificity of 96% (Hornsleth and Jankowski, 1990; Storch, 2003) . It costs about US$ 2.50-7 to screen and US$ 8-18 to identify influenza. PCR takes slightly longer with a TAT of 6-12 h and requires an expert technician and specialized, expensive equipment. Unfortunately, PCR is not available at most centers as a clinical assay.",

The features of the different assays have been summarized recently (Nicholson et al., 2003) . Unfortunately, reported sensitivities and specificities of these various tests cannot be directly compared, since different 'gold standards', source populations, sample types (fresh versus frozen; nasal versus throat), and operators (i.e. research laboratory versus clinical laboratory versus physician office) were used to evaluate each test. Use of a particular rapid diagnostic test for influenza should be determined according to the level of identification needed (influenza A or B versus influenza A and B), price, CLIA status, specimen type, staff familiarity with methods, turn-around-time, and relative sensitivity and specificity of the test. Additionally, the predictive value depends on the prevalence of disease. For example, if the sensitivity and specificity of the test was 80%, and the prevalence of influenza was 5%, the positive predictive value (PPV) of the test would be 17%; if the prevalence was 20%, the PPV would be 50%.

Several signaling pathways are used to modulate the immune response following infection. Viral infection of epithelium, interaction with pattern recognition receptors, such as toll-like receptors, and creation of Virus-collectin complexes results in upregulation of mediator genes, predominately cytokines and chemokines. Virus-collectin complexes also enhance phagocytosis. Viral proteins binding to B cell receptors results in increase antibody and mediator production, while viral protein binding to T cell receptors results in activation of T cells and increased mediator production. The chemokines and cytokines that are elaborated in response to the infection then interact with receptors that result in chemotaxis and regulation of gene expression that ultimately results in the immune response.",

Various clinical and experimental observations indicate that certain patterns of host response are associated with severe disease, but it has been extremely difficult to prove that these are causal determinants, rather than just correlates, of clinical outcome. To better understand the association between clinical response to infection (phenotype) and specific genes, genetic association studies need to be done. Genetic association studies can be done using a genome approach or using candidate genes. It has been estimated that genomic approaches would require study of at least 200,000 markers in several thousand subjects, a project which would cost many millions of dollars.

Mechanical damage to the tissue, which exposes underlying layers of cells, did not increase the range of infection, indicating that this reflected an authentic tropism rather than simple physical exclusion. Next, the virus was applied to cell cultures at different stages of development. Infection was very inefficient early in the development of the tissue (2 days after establishment of an air-liquid interface), but the efficiency increased with increasing differentiation, reaching a plateau after day 14. This corresponded with the appearance of ciliated cells. The virus was also shown to be shed from the apical surface at reasonably steady levels after infection (\u223c10 7 plaque forming units per ml of wash fluid). Timed microscopy demonstrated well-defined spread of the RSV across the apical face consistent with cilia motion. Ribavirin and palivizumab inhibited infection of the cells. Thirty-six days after rgRSV infection, intact infected cells were readily detected but, interestingly, cytopathologic effect was minimal, although cells were noted to become rounder in the vertical dimension.

Cloud Babies were capable of causing outbreaks both in the hospital and at home. The concept was expanded to include adults when an outbreak of S. aureus infections occurred in two newborn nurseries associated with a single nurse.

The greatest amount of S. aureus was cultured after the volunteers were infected with rhinovirus. There was an approximately two-fold mean increase in airborne dispersal of S. aureus following experimental rhinovirus infection with peak airborne dispersal as high as 100-fold greater than baseline. Masks did not blunt this effect but wearing barrier garb (gown, gloves, booties, cap) did, suggesting that in most volunteers the airborne dispersal is not coming in real time directly from the nose. Independent predictors of detecting S. aureus in the area around the volunteers included wearing street clothes, sneezing, and rhinovirus infection. Cough and the severity of the cold were not related to S. aureus colony counts, and the greatest colony counts were obtained after the catarrhal phase of the illness.",

Imperial College, London, UK) RSV bronchiolitis in infancy is strongly associated with the later development of asthma (Stein et al., 1999) and RSV is also implicated in virus induced asthma exacerbations. Protective immunity to re-infection with RSV is incomplete and of short duration; previously infected infants and adults remain susceptible to re-infection with antigenically closely related viruses or the identical virus strain. Recent evidence suggests that virus-induced asthma exacerbations may be associated with deficient type 1 immunity (Papadopoulos et al., 2002d) . A deficit in IFN-\u2425/IL-4 mRNA ratio and IL-18 mRNA expression by peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) has been observed in infants that developed RSV bronchiolitis compared to infants from the same birth cohort with a normal response to RSV infection (Legg et al., 2003) .",

RSV: childhood wheezing, 'asthma', and atopy (Peter Openshaw, Imperial College, London, UK) Asthma, by definition, is reversible airflow obstruction (change in FEV 1 /PERF >14%), with bronchial hyperresponsiveness to irritants such as exercise, chemicals, allergens, or cold air. Most patients have wheezing, cough, or shortness of breath, and all have evidence of increased inflammation in the lungs. Wheezing can be classified into four types, predominating at distinct ages: transient infant wheeze (likely related to exposure to smoke or small lungs); early wheeze (typically after a viral illness); classical atopic asthma (which tends to be familial) and chronic obstructive airway disease (typically resulting from chronic irritant exposure, such as smoke, throughout a person's lifetime). Of 826 children fol-lowed from birth until age 6, 51.5% never wheezed, 19.9% had transient wheezing, 15% had onset of wheezing after 3 years of age, and 13.7% had persistent wheezing (Martinez et al., 1995) . Five to six million American children have asthma, making it the most common chronic disease in children. It is estimated that there are 470,000 hospitalizations per year, 5000 deaths per year, and an estimated excess expenditure of over US$ 6 billion per year worldwide as the result of asthma exacerbations.",

These PBMCs were thawed, stimulated with a number of antigens, and then had IL-4 and IFN-\u2425 ELISPOT and proliferation assays performed. Bronchiolitic patients had increased IL-4 response to RSV and Fel d antigens, but not to other tested antigens (Der p, Bet v, tetanus toxoid, PHA, and media) (Pala et al., 2002) . A second study took mice and exposed them to intranasal ovalbumin followed by intravenous ovalbumin 18 days after initial exposure. Mice who were exposed to intranasal ovalbumin after being exposed to RSV or influenza A had an anaphylactic reaction to intravenous ovalbumin, while mice exposed without infections had minimal symptoms (O'Donnell and Openshaw, 1998) .

            "text": "The age of acquisition of RSV infection may impact on future asthmatic sequelae. Most cases of RSV bronchiolitis occur prior to 4 months of age. At the time of birth, neonates have a strong Th2 immune response, whereas Th1 response matures with exposure to environmental antigens. Viral and gastrointestinal infections promote Th1 responses, which are responsible for protection against atopy. Such immune maturation hypotheses have been documented by stimulating tonsil extracts from children with RSV and PHA in vitro; these stimulations result in increasing levels of IFN-\u2425 with increasing age. When mice are infected with RSV at 1 day, 1, 4, and 8 weeks of age and then reinfected at 12 weeks of age, infection of older mice resulted in increased viral load, likely secondary to larger lungs with more cells to infect, but similar rates of clearance of virus. Secondary infection caused substantial weight loss in mice primarily infected at 1 day and 1 week, but not in mice initially infected at 4 or 8 weeks. Mice primarily infected at 1 day and 1 week had increased number of total cells, CD8 T cells, eosinophils, and neutrophils extracted from the lungs. Mice infected at 2 and 4 weeks had increased production of IFN-\u2425 and decreased production of IL-4 compared to mice infected at 1 day and 1 week (Culley et al., 2002) . This data suggests that the nature of the secondary response is determined by the age at primary infection. RSV infection early in life sensitizes for severe response to viral challenge later in life and T-cell priming in the neonatal period may explain this association. Delaying RSV infection beyond infancy could have long-term benefits in terms of less severe disease, decreased atopy, and lower frequencies of asthma. Potential mechanisms for this delayed effect include chronic, persistent, or latent viral infection, remodeling of the lung after infection, permanent epithelial damage, immunologic priming or tolerance, or bystander antigenic sensitization. Further studies will need to be done to investigate these alternatives.",

Children were initially followed until 3 years of age and had samples collected for virologic studies when the child experienced any signs or symptoms of lower respiratory tract illness. Children then had follow up visits at 6, 8, 11, and 13 years of age to evaluate for wheeze. There was increased risk of later wheezing when lower respiratory tract illness had developed as the result of RSV infection. However, lower respiratory tract illnesses resulting from other virus types were also significantly associated with increased risk of wheezing later in life (Stein et al., 1999) . Another study found substantial contributions of rhinoviruses to the severity of bronchiolitis (Papadopoulos et al., 2002c) . Potential explanations for the relationship of early virus-related lower respiratory illness including RSV bronchiolitis is that patients with lower respiratory illness/bronchiolitis may have smaller airways, deficient type 1 or increased type 2 immunity, or develop increased allergen sensitization during acute infection.",

            "text": "In conclusion, it appears that the risk of allergic disease later in life can be reduced by high overall load of infectious disease (including respiratory viral infections) early in life, but exposure to respiratory infections early in life causes increased morbidity at that time. Likewise, individual infections in subjects at risk, such as those with deficient type 1 immunity or small airways, result in infections that are more severe, more likely to involve the lower respiratory tract, and are strongly associated with wheezing later in life. (Michael Boeckh, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA) Increasingly, respiratory viruses are being recognized as significant pathogens in transplant recipients. Serious illness due to respiratory viruses appears most common in hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients and lung transplant recipients. The most frequently isolated respiratory viruses are respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza, influenza viruses, and rhinoviruses. A targeted surveillance system has found an attack rate among the approximately 4800 patients who received HSCT at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center (FHCRC) over the past 12 years to be 7% for PIV, 4% for RSV, and 1% for influenza. Most respiratory virus infections (RVIs) in the Seattle area, like most temperate areas, occur during the winter months (November to May in Seattle). Our retrospective review found that respiratory viral pneumonia was associated with an increased risk of death (HR 2.2 for RSV, 3.4 for PIV, and 2.4 for influenza). Likewise, patients with respiratory viral infections were at increased risk for invasive aspergillosis (HR 2.1) (Marr et al., 2002) . This finding suggests that the clinical effects of RVIs are likely both from direct lytic effects and indirect immunomodulatory effects.",

Risk factors for acquisition of RSV, PIV, and influenza were analyzed. Season, male sex, and transplant type were associated with increased risk of developing RSV infection; unrelated donor status was associated with PIV infection; and season, female sex, and underlying malignancy were associated with increased risk of influenza infection. Data from other studies suggest that CD4 lymphopenia also enhances the risk of acquisition of a respiratory viral illness in a dose-dependent fashion. Lymphopenia is also associated with increased risk of progression to lower respiratory tract disease. Steroids were noted to be protective against progression in influenza infection but to be a risk factor, in a dose-dependent manner, for progression in PIV infections (Chakrabarti et al., 2001; Ljungman et al., 2001; Nichols et al., 2001) .",

Several, mostly small, retrospective studies have documented poor response to intravenous ribavirin alone (20-100% survival) or in combination with aerosolized ribavirin with (50% survival) or without (40% survival) IVIG (Lewinsohn et al., 1996; Ljungman et al., 2001) . Better results have been documented with aerosolized ribavirin alone (22-66% survival) (Harrington et al., 1992; Ljungman et al., 2001) , or in combination with IVIG (50-68% survival) (Ghosh et al., 2001; Ljungman et al., 2001; Whimbey et al., 1995) , RSV-Ig (86-91% survival) (DeVincenzo et al., 2000; Small et al., 2002) or palivizumab (83%) . These data suggest that optimal therapy for RSV pneumonia involves the combination of aerosolized ribavirin plus an antibody preparation. Starting antiviral therapy early impacts survival. If combination therapy is started before respiratory failure begins, 78-80% of patients survive, compared to none who have therapy begun after respiratory failure. Potential risk factors for increased mortality in patients with RSV pneumonia includes the co-pathogens, concomitant immunosuppression (steroids, anti-lymphocyte antibodies), lymphopenia, preexisting lung disease, and the therapy used, including the time of onset. Prevention strategies should be explored to limit the frequency of RSV disease. Infection control is an important component to prevent infections, but is of limited value when the patient leaves the hospital or clinic. Use of RSV-Ig or palivizumab for prophylaxis might be beneficial, although the two preparations have never been studied in this population in a randomized fashion and would be very expensive to use. Preemptive therapy, with aerosolized ribavirin, could be used in patients with asymptomatic shedding or RSV URIs, although early detection methods limit the ability to implement preemptive management of these infections. Additionally, these preemptive strategies have not been tested for RSV in randomized trials.",

One patient developed tracheobronchitis and required oxygen transiently. The strategy currently used is to delay transplant if upper respiratory symptoms are present and not do the transplant until cessation of symptoms and the nasal wash is negative for virus (CDC, 2000) . At FHCRC we found that 37 patients who developed RSV URI prior to transplant. Thirty-one had the URI before conditioning and two developed pneumonia after transplantation with response to treatment. Six were discovered after starting conditioning. Of the three that had the transplant aborted, none developed RSV pneumonia, whereas two of those that continued with transplantation developed pneumonia and one died. This same study documented pre-transplant shedding in patients for up to 42 days with most patients having shedding of virus for at least 1 month. Delay in transplantation did not result in progression of the underlying disease. Thus, delay of transplant for at least 1 month should be advised for all myeloablative transplants (CDC, 2000) .",

Adult in-and out-patients with hematologic malignancy, including HSCT recipients, were included in the study if they had signs and symptoms of an upper or lower respiratory tract infection. A total of 251 nasopharyngeal aspirates and 19 bronchoalveolar lavages were collected during 256 episodes of respiratory infection in 198 patients from October 1999 to June 2002. One or multiple respiratory viruses, were identified in 122 episodes (48%). Influenza A virus was found in 67 cases, followed by respiratory syncytial virus in 24, enteroviruses in 12, adenoviruses in 12, influenza B virus in 8, parainfluenza viruses in 10 (5 PIV 1 and 5 PIV 3) and two rhinoviruses.

            "text": "Among the 24 episodes of RSV infection, RSV was detected alone in 18, while eight patients also had infections with influenza A and in one with CMV. Most (88%) of the patients cleared the infection during the first 2 weeks, while one patient each had detectable virus until day 18 and week 5. Thirty-eight percent of the patients acquired their RSV infection in the hospital after a median of 15 days (range: 5-26 days). Upper respiratory tract infection was diagnosed in 17 patients, LRI in 7, and only one patient with upper respiratory tract infection at presentation progressed to LRI. Six patients received inhaled ribavirin and only one of the treated patients died. This study prospectively confirmed that RSV occurs typically in the winter months, can be nosocomially transmitted, and can frequently progress to involve the lower airways. Most patients clear the infection during the first 2 weeks after infection. RSV infection was associated with a low mortality in this heterogeneous population, despite 33% having lower respiratory tract symptoms. (Tuomas Jartti, University of Turku, Turku, Finland) Up to 20-25% of all children have at least one episode of wheezing, and most cases of asthma exacerbations are the result of viral respiratory infections (Glezen et al., 2000; Habbick et al., 1999; Hesselmar et al., 2000; Johnston et al., 1995; Martinez et al., 1995; McIntosh, 1976; Mertsola et al., 1991; Rakes et al., 1999) . A prospective study was conducted to determine which respiratory viruses are isolated from children in Finland who are hospitalized for acute expiratory wheezing. A total of 293 hospitalized children (median age: 1.6 years, range: 3 months to 15 years) were recruited from September 2000 until May 2002 in Turku, Finland. Patients with chronic lung disease, heart disease, and chronic steroid use were excluded from the study. In addition to serologies, nasal aspirates were tested by PCR for rhino-, entero-, corona-and metapneumo-virus (hMPV), antigen detection and culture for influenza A and B, parainfluenza type 1, 2 and 3, adenovirus and RSV, and culture for rhino-and enterovirus. A potential causative viral agent was found in 88.7% of cases: RSV 27%, entero-25%, rhino-22%, nontypable picorna-16.4%, adenovirus 5%, hMPV 4%, parainfluenza type 1/3 5%, influenza A and B both 1% and coronavirus 1%. Eighteen percent of patients had multiple viruses detected. Patients with rhino-and entroviruses were slightly older (median: 2.2 years) than patients with RSV and hMPV infection (median: 0.9 years). Patients with RSV and hMPV typically had longer durations of hospitalization than patients with other viral pathogens detected. RVIs were associated with almost all episodes of wheezing leading to hospitalization in this study. This study was also one of the first to demonstrate the contribution of hMPV, particularly during winter epidemics, and its correlation with wheezing (Jartti et al., 2002b; van den Hoogen et al., 2001) . The prevalence of enterovirus was higher in this study than previously reported, and the results confirm the large contribution of picornaviruses, particularly rhinoviruses, to wheezing episodes in children. Subbarao, NIAID, NIH, Bethesda, MD) One of the many key components to pandemic preparedness is the development of pandemic vaccines before the pandemic arrives. Live-attenuated influenza vaccines (LAIV) are particularly appealing as they are typically easier to deliver than injectable vaccines. Unfortunately, there are several issues that currently limit the development of these vaccines including the need to generate candidate vaccines in a BSL3+ facility, the wide range of avian viruses, the choice of vaccine development strategy (reverse genetics or reassortment), choice of donor virus (PR8 or LAIV), and the need to do extensive safety and immunogenicity testing of candidate in animals and humans. An additional issue is selection of the optimal serologic assay (HAI, Nt, SRH) for determining immunogenicity and defining an appropriately protective titer.",

View, CA) [Editorial note: FluMist is an intranasal live-attenuated, cold-adapted, trivalent influenza vaccine that was approved by the FDA for use in healthy children and adults ages 5-49 years in June 2003.] Approval of the CAIV-T vaccine was slow because of concerns about safety and efficacy in certain age groups. The vaccine has been shown to be genetically stable; viruses that have lost their temperature sensitivity or cold-adaptation RNA Virus Virosome have not been recovered from vaccinated patients. Likewise, transmission of the vaccine virus is very infrequent; only one case has been documented in which a child in a day care setting acquired the vaccine strain from another vaccinated child. The child who inadvertently acquired the virus did not have symptoms distinct from other placebo recipients. The two major concerns on the part of the FDA after their initial advisory panel review in 2001 related to the questions of increased risk of pneumonia and asthma in vaccinated individuals. Subsequent analyses of the original clinical trials data failed to demonstrate an increased risk of pneumonia in vaccinated individuals. Data from a large study in the Northern California Kaiser system did demonstrate an increased number of medical encounters for asthma in vaccinated children compared to placebo vaccinated patients, but most of the visits were outpatient clinic visits for asthma management and did not temporally cluster within the 42-day post-vaccination observation period. Many of these subjects had a history of asthma at the time of enrollment and none required hospitalization. No asthma signal was detected in children above the age of 5 years. The FDA advisory committee felt that there was adequate data on the efficacy and safety of the vaccine in children >59 months of age and adults younger than 50 to recommend approval for this age group. As a result, further studies are needed in the age groups that have not been as completely studied, including young children and otherwise healthy adults aged 50-64 years.",

Theoretically, once taken up by an antigen presenting cell (APC), the virosome would fuse from within the acidic endosomal cell compartment, resulting in delivery of virosome-encapsulated antigen to the cell cytosol, while surface-associated antigen-including part of the HA-would remain behind in the endosome. In the cytosol, the antigen would be processed by proteasomes. Peptides produced would bind in the ER to MHC class I molecules to be ultimately presented on the APC surface, priming CD8 + T cells to mature into cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs).

Fusion activity of the virosomes is essential for MHC class I presentation. Virosomes induce maturation of dendritic cells as evidenced by upregulation of maturation markers including MHC class I and II molecules. Although virosomes induce a mixed Th1/Th2 response, the response is skewed toward Th1 supporting priming of CTL activity. As a result of their broad activation of the immune system and their ability to carry antigens, virosomes hold significant promise for vaccine development. Virosomes could also be used as a platform for inclusion of immunomodulators or adjuvants to be used as potential intranasal and/or pandemic influenza vaccines. Newer influenza virosome vaccines could be supplemented with other influenza antigens, such as the NP, M1, or M2, for further induction of humoral and CTL responses. Potential other applications include vaccine development for bioterrorism agents and therapeutic cancer vaccines.",

Studies in adults have demonstrated that the Inflexal V is equal to conventional inactivated influenza vaccine (Fluarix) in terms of immunogenicity and appears to be better tolerated. A new virosomal vaccine, adjuvanted with MF59 is currently under development. The adjuvanted vaccine has been tested in HIV+ and HIV\u2212 children. Immune responses are more frequent in HIV\u2212 children. Among the HIV+ children, sero-protective serum antibody responses were documented in 82, 57, and 61% for A H3, A H1, and B, respectively, while seroconversion was noted in 74, 57, and 52%, respectively. Finally, a non-virosomal intranasal influenza vaccine that used Escherichia coli heat-labile toxin as an adjuvant, previously manufactured by Berna, was removed from the market because of a possible association with Bell's Palsy. An epidemiologic investigation compared the frequency of Bell's palsy in 10,000 commercial IM vaccinated patients and 10,000 Berna IN vaccinated patients. Two of the IM and five of the IN patients had Bell's Palsy. Although the incidence was low, the company decided to remove the product from the market.",

However, safety monitoring would be an essential component for the phase III efficacy studies. (Peter Wright, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN) RSV affects 75% of children during their first year of life and is responsible for over 100,000 hospitalizations and 500 deaths per year in children. The additional costs attributable to RSV infection has been calculated to be over US$ 300 million per year. Although 53% of children have no risk factors, many children that have infections severe enough to require hospitalization were born premature, had congenital heart disease, or bronchopulmonary dysplasia. RSV causes illness from December to March and accounts for 4% of URIs among community-dwelling children and 17% of LRIs. To help combat this disease, a cold-passage, live-attenuated vaccine was created using reverse genetics. The resultant 248/404/ SH temperature-sensitive, attenuated virus has been used to vaccinate unscreened adults, RSV seropositive children 15-59 months old, RSV seronegative children 6-24 months, and 1-2-month-old infants. After a 10 5 initial dose, only 1/15 adults and 1/10 seropositive children had recoverable virus. Of those with recoverable virus, the titer was quite low (1.6 log 10 ). Seronegative children shed virus in nasal secretions with a peak viral titer of 2-4 log 10 ; most of the seronegative children ceased shedding within 12 days.",

Additional testing with these attenuated strains showed that increasing the initial vaccine inoculum titer does not substantially increase viral shedding or immunogenicity. Finally, studies in children less than 3 months old showed a comparable level of viral shedding in the presence or absence of maternal antibodies. The young infants had minimal antibody responses, although there were detectable serum levels of IgG and IgA to the G protein. Mucosal antibodies were produced but at far lower levels than are seen in children older than 3 months of age. A second dose of vaccine, the response to which can be used as a surrogate for reinfection, resulted in rare shedding of the virus and no evidence of enhanced RSV illness once infected. These findings suggest that the vaccine may be protective without detectable increases in antibody level. Finally, a NS-2 protein deleted 248/404 virus, a change that may make the virus more susceptible to interferon, has been found to have markedly reduced viral shedding, particularly in seronegative children, when compared to the other attenuated vaccine strains.

Serial passage at low temperatures in AGMK has resulted in a virus that is cold-adapted, temperature-sensitive, and attenuated in human and non-human primates. As a result, the virus does not grow well at temperatures below 37 \u2022 C, a characteristic that theoretically limits its replication to the upper airway. In phase 1 studies in adults and seropositive children 1-59 months, intranasal inoculation of 6 log 10 pfu resulted in infection in only 10% of adults and 12% of the seropositive children. This suggests that prior natural HPIV3 infection limits the infectiousness of the vaccine virus. In a phase 2 study of seronegative 6-24-month children given either 4 or 5 log 10 pfu, 82-100% were successfully infected. Of those infected, the mean peak titer of shed virus was 2.2-3.3 log 10 pfu/ml.

In patients who received their second dose 3 months after the first, virus shedding was detected with greater frequency than after the 1-month challenge. Vaccination resulted in a significant rise in serum IgA anti-HN in 84% of children but did not result in significant HAI titer changes. Five children had temperature-sensitive intermediate viruses recovered during follow-up. All five formed plaques at 39 \u2022 C, represented a small fraction (1%) of the total viral population, presented at the peak of viral shedding and were cleared at the same rate as fully temperature-sensitive viruses, and were not associated with changes in clinical status. From these studies, it is clear that the cp45 HPIV3 vaccine is well-tolerated and immunogenic in infants and children but uncommonly may partially revert.

To investigate the response to this vaccine in children age 3-6 years old, an open-label study enrolled 369 children over two influenza seasons to receive the intranasal trivalent LIV. Patients were interviewed after 6 months to assess for acute respiratory infections. The vaccine was well tolerated with children uncommonly developing fever (0.9%), headache (0.3%), and sore throat (0.9%). There was a four-fold rise in serum influenza-specific antibodies in 58-59, 58-61, and 30-39% of children to H1N1, H3N2, and B antigens, respectively and four-fold rise in IgA titers in 44-60, 42-53, and 22-44% of children, respectively. There was a 8.8-fold reduction in influenza infections and a 2.2-fold reduction in all acute respiratory infections among vaccinated children compared to historical controls.

In 1999, two children developed influenza caused by a H9N2 strain in Hong Kong. The H9N2 virus exhibits receptor-binding properties consistent with other human influenza viruses suggesting that this virus could potentially cause a pandemic. An inactivated subunit H9N2 vaccine was protective in mice. Since whole virus vaccines may be more immunogenic in na\u00efve patients, whole virion (WV) and subunit (SV) vaccines were prepared using influenza A/Hong Kong/0173/99 (H9N2). This vaccine was used in an observer-blind, dose-ranging study in 60 healthy adults aged 18-60 years old. Volunteers received either vaccine containing 7.5, 15, or 30 g H9 HA at the time of enrollment and 21 days later. Antibody response at days 0, 14, 21, and 42 was detected by hemagglutination inhibition (HI), microneutralization (MN), and single radial hemolysis (SRH). Both vaccines were well tolerated, although the WV was associated with more frequent pain (42% versus 10%), nausea (15% versus 0%), and arthalgias (15% versus 3%) than the SV. There were no differences in seroconversion between WV and SV at day 42, although seroconversion was more likely in patients who had received 30 g, particularly with the WV. Patients younger than 32 years were less likely to convert after the first dose than following the second dose. This suggests that a booster dose will be required for all na\u00efve patients younger than 32 years.",

Despite its frequent use and the echinacoside, in addition to polysaccharides and alkamides present in the plant. Immunostimulatory activity has been ascribed to the polysaccharides, while anti-inflammatory activity has been ascribed to the caffeic acid derivatives and the alkamides. The biologically active constituents differ among the three species (Table 6) . Unfortunately, the content of each biologically active component in the plant is dependent on the harvest time and part of the plant used. Available preparations use different species, different parts of the plant, and plants from different regions and harvest times. As a result, there is significant variability in the content of cichoric acid and alkamides in different brands and different lots of the same brand. Studies of these agents are difficult because it is unclear what are the optimal dose and formulation of Echinacea to use and what are the relative absorption and distribution of each preparation.",

One step amenable to modification may be the oxidative stress induced by the virus. In A549 cell lines exposed to RSV, exposure to the antioxidant DMSO resulted in reduced IL-8 production in a concentration-dependent manner. To investigate the role of oxidative stress in rhinovirus infections, carbonyl and DCFDA stains were used to document oxidant stress in cell lines exposed to rhinovirus. Next, N-acetylcysteine (NAC), another potent anti-oxidant, was used in BEAS-2B cell lines exposed to hRV.

Since DPI is a specific inhibitor of NADPH-oxidase, additional studies were conducted to determine the components of the oxidase most responsible for the reduction of titers. First, CGD skin fibroblasts, which are deficient in the gp91-phox component of the NAPDH-oxidase, were infected with hRV. There was no difference in viral titer or IL-8 production as compared to normal skin fibroblasts, while fibroblasts that were p47-phox deficient had reduced IL-8 production. Lastly, p47-phox antisense molecules were used to assess the role of p47-phox in IL-8 production. In the presences of antisense constructs, IL-8 levels were markedly reduced. Amplification of MRC-5 and BEAS-2b cell lines to look for specific NADPH-like oxidases found NOX-4 to be present in all tested cell lines.

Ruprintrivir (AG7088) (Amy Patick, Pfizer Global Research and Development, La Jolla, CA) In the search for drugs active against picornaviruses, the 3C protease was identified as a important target because it lacks similarity to human proteases, is essential for replication, and has a highly conserved active site (Matthews et al., 1994) . Ruprintrivir (AG7088) is currently being investigated as a highly potent (mean EC90 for 48 tested serotypes = 82 nM), peptidomimetic, irreversible 3C protease inhibitor (Dragovich et al., 1998a (Dragovich et al., ,b, 1999a Patick et al., 1999) . Phase I trials demonstrated that ruprintrivir had minimal treatment-related adverse nasal effects and that there were high nasal mucus concentrations of ruprintrivir 12 h after intranasal inoculation. In phase II studies, in which volunteers were inoculated with either HRV39 or Hanks, subjects were randomized to receive intranasal ruprintrivir (8 mg) or placebo sprays as prophylaxis (2 or 5 times daily (2 times per day or 5 times per day) for 5 days) starting 6 h before infection or as treatment (5 times per day for 4 days) starting 24 h after infection. Patients who received active drug as treatment had lower symptom scores beginning 1 day after infection. The treated patients also had lower viral titers by culture and RT-PCR at days 2 and 3. Prophylaxis also reduced viral shedding and mean AUC of virus titer but did not significantly reduce the frequency of colds. These studies established that intranasal ruprintrivir suspension has significant antiviral activity in experimentally induced rhinovirus infection. A phase II treatment trial of patients with natural colds with symptoms of less than 36 h was conducted in which patients received ruprintrivir BID or TID or placebo for 10 days. Unfortunately, only 29% of volunteers had a picornavirus documented by a first generation RT-PCR test and the study found no difference in outcomes between treated and untreated patients, except for those picornavirus-infected patients who entered the study within the first 24 h of symptomology. As a result of these results the drug was reformulated to its current 2% nasal solution. Phase I trials showed the drug to be safe and well tolerated; phase II studies are currently underway.",

It has broad activity against most picornaviruses. Two pivotal phase three clinical trials were conducted from August to November 2000 at 197 centers in the United States and Canada. Patients that had an afebrile cold with symptoms of less than 24 h with moderate to severe rhinorrhea were enrolled. Patients received pleconaril 400 mg BID for 5 days after enrollment. A total of 2096 patients were enrolled in both trials with 65% having a rhinovirus cold by RT-PCR. Pleconaril treatment was associated with a reduction in illness duration of 0.6 and 1.5 days in each study, respectively . Illness severity was reduced by 19% and differences began on day 2. Nights of sleep disturbance was reduced by 33%, cold medications were reduced by 19%, and viral shedding was reduced by 2 days. Resistant virus was isolated post-treatment in some subjects; 2.7% showed no susceptibility to pleconaril and 10.7% had a 10-fold reduction in susceptibility. Amino acid changes from resistant variants mapped to the drug-binding pocket. There was no difference in illness course in patients shedding virus with reduced susceptibility to pleconaril. Mild to moderate nausea was more common among patients who received pleconaril (6% versus 4%). There were no clinically significant effects on laboratory safety parameters. Three-and-a-half percent of women on oral contraceptives developed menstrual disorders after using pleconaril, although there was no increased incidence of pregnancy in these women. In conclusion, pleconaril was found to be the first antiviral drug effective in reducing the duration and severity of rhinoviral colds and was well tolerated.",

The increase in events began during the second week of prophylaxis. In response to these findings, additional testing was done in healthy volunteers that documented increases in CYP3A activity after 5 days of oral pleconaril. This increased CYP3A activity was associated with a 35% decrease in the AUC of ethinyl estradiol and a 28% decrease in the AUC of midazolam. The CYP3A activity returned to normal levels 7-14 days after cessation of pleconaril administration.

In vitro time of drug addition studies suggest that the drug has to be present early after infection to affect a single round of virus replication. In cotton rats, prophylactic BID dosing of VP14637 by SPA for 3 days resulted in significant reduction in lung virus titer. Forty-six independent escape variants were selected to VP14637 in vitro. All 46 variants had amino acid changes that mapped to the F glycoprotein. Modeling of these changes on the crystal structure of the Newcastle Disease Virus metastable form of the F glycoprotein indicated that the amino acid changes mapped to the head domain of the protein (Chen et al., 2001) . Preclinical toxicology studies in adult rats, adult dogs, and neonatal dogs in which the animals were given VP14637 for 2 weeks by SPA inhalation resulted in no histological changes. Genotoxicity studies have been negative to date. An IND for the new drug was filed and approved during the third quarter of 2001. A phase 1 study has recently been completed, although data analysis is ongoing, and other studies are in the planning stages currently. (Mikhail Matrosovich, Philipps University, Marburg, Germany) Influenza virus can develop resistance to neuraminidase inhibitors via changes in the neuraminidase (NA), which results in decreased drug binding, or in the hemagglutinin (HA), which results in lowered HA affinity for its cellular receptor. To detect both types of resistance, and perhaps novel ones, a virus inhibition assay in cell culture is required. Unfortunately, current cell culture assays are not predictive of influenza virus sensitivity to neuraminidase inhibitors (NAI) in enzyme inhibition assays or in vivo (McKimm-Breschkin, 2000; Tisdale, 2000) NAI sensitive strains may appear to be resistant, while NAI resistant mutants may show susceptibility with current methods. One reason for this limitation is that laboratory cell lines do not model influenza virus receptors in the human airway epithelium. Human airway epithelium has mostly two to six linked sialic acids with high receptor density, and influenza virus infection is highly NA dependent. Laboratory cells including commonly used Madin Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells, on the other hand, have mostly two to three linked sialic acids with low receptor density, so that influenza infection is less NA dependent.",

Originally the D151 was thought to be the proton donor for the catalytic reaction mediated by the NA. Since none of these isolates showed decreased enzyme activity, the D151 likely does not provide this role. In addition to changes in non-conserved residues associated with natural antigen drift, there was also a change in the conserved residue T225I in 1 B virus, and co-evolution of I203L and E375G in 5/42 B isolates. Molecular modeling shows these latter two residues lie on opposite sides of the NA head and hence are more likely to be random rather than compensatory mutations. Importantly, despite sequence variations, there was no naturally occurring resistance to either zanamivir or oseltamivir. 9.9. Effect of mutations in the hemagglutinin gene of influenza A viruses on the resistance phenotype of neuraminidase inhibitors (Guy Boivin, Laval University, Qu\u00e9bec, Canada) Previous studies have shown that resistance to neuraminidase inhibitors (NAI) generated after in vitro passages may result in mutations in the neuraminidase (NA) and/or hemagglutinin (HA) genes. However, the effect of HA mutations alone on the resistance phenotype remains to be confirmed in clinical isolates. In influenza A/H1N9 the HA mutation S186F results in 10-fold reduced susceptibility to zanamivir, while S186F + K222T results in 1000-fold resistance to all known NAIs (Blick et al., 1998) . The S186F, K222T, and both mutations were incorporated in the HA transcription plasmid using the Quick change site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Recombinant influenza A/WSN33 (H1N1) viruses were then generated by reverse genetics (Fodor et al., 1999) . In the NA inhibition assay, the wild type and HA mutants had similar low IC 50 values for zanamivir (0.67-1.06 nM) and peramivir (0.18-0.26 nM). The K222T virus had a three-to four-fold reduction in susceptibility by plaque reduction assay, while the other two mutants were no different than the wild type virus. This data suggests that in vitro generated resistance to NAIs may not be solely attributable to HA mutations as previously reported. In addition, the combined effects of HA and NA mutations needs to be investigated as potential mechanisms for NAI resistance (Nedyalkova et al., 2002) . This study also documents the utility of reverse genetics to study various HA substitutions in the same genetic background and the impact of these variant HAs on antiviral susceptibility.",

The recent events associated with the SARS epidemic and outbreak of influenza A/H7N7 in Europe further emphasize the importance of planning ahead for pandemics and potential biologic catastrophes. This meeting focused on the importance of pandemic planning for influenza and outlined areas in which vaccine development and implementation needs continued study. The development of live-attenuated and recombinant vaccines holds great promise for preventing viral respiratory diseases in the future. Clearly significant challenges lie ahead in the development of antivirals with activity against the respiratory viruses. In addition to common respiratory viral pathogens like rhinoviruses and RSV, the threats of SARS and novel influenza viruses highlight the medical needs for antivirals for both prevention and treatment.",
