They include transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), and the human coronaviruses severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), many of which seriously endanger human health and well-being. Only alphacoronaviruses and betacoronaviruses harbor nonstructural protein 1 (nsp1), which performs multiple functions in inhibiting antiviral host responses. The role of the C terminus of betacoronavirus nsp1 in virulence has been characterized, but the location of the alphacoronavirus nsp1 region that is important for virulence remains unclear. Here, using TGEV nsp1 as a model to explore the function of this protein in alphacoronaviruses, we demonstrate that alphacoronavirus nsp1 inhibits host gene expression. Solving the crystal structure of full-length TGEV at 1.85-\u00c5 resolution and conducting several biochemical analyses, we observed that a specific motif (amino acids 91-95) of alphacoronavirus nsp1 is a conserved region that inhibits host protein synthesis. Using a reverse-genetics system based on CRISPR/ Cas9 technology to construct a recombinant TGEV in which this specific nsp1 motif was altered, we found that this mutation does not affect virus replication in cell culture but significantly reduces TGEV pathogenicity in pigs. Taken together, our findings suggest that alphacoronavirus nsp1 is an essential virulence determinant, providing a potential paradigm for the development of a new attenuated vaccine based on modified nsp1.",

Furthermore, MERS-CoV nsp1 selectively targets mRNA synthesized in the host cell nucleus for degradation and thus inhibits translation in host cells (14) . TGEV and PEDV nsp1 proteins cannot bind the 40S ribosomal subunit to inhibit the translation of host mRNA; however, HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 nsp1 proteins might bind the 40S ribosomal subunit to affect host mRNA stability (9, 15, 16) .",

However, the function of CoV nsp1 in viral immune system evasion has been well-characterized in cell culture. For example, SARS-CoV nsp1 suppresses interferon (IFN) expression and host antiviral signaling pathways in infected cells (10, 17) . Furthermore, MHV nsp1 efficiently interferes with the type I IFN system (11) , whereas PEDV nsp1 mediates cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB)-binding protein (CBP) and NF-B degradation to inhibit type II IFN responses (12, 18) . Thus, nsp1 is considered a possible major virulence factor for CoVs. Moreover, the contribution of nsp1 to CoV pathogenesis has been directly demonstrated for MHV and SARS-CoV (11, 17) . However, little direct evidence has indicated that \u2423-CoV nsp1 is a virulence factor. Here, we present the crystal structure of full-length TGEV nsp1. Further structural and biochemical analyses indicated that a motif (amino acids 91-95) is important for the inhibition of host gene expression by \u2423-CoV nsp1. In addition, we demonstrate that the loss of nsp1-induced inhibition of host protein synthesis does not affect the replication of TGEV but can significantly reduce its virulence in piglets. This research improves our understanding of why \u2423-CoV nsp1 is necessary for virulence and may aid in the development of a new attenuated vaccine.",

Fortunately, we were able to determine the crystal structure of full-length TGEV nsp1 using the molecular replacement method and refined it to 1.85-\u00c5 resolution in space group P2 1 . The details of the phasing and refinement steps are given in Table 1 . Although the crystal resolution was very high, the specific conformation of the C terminus remained unclear. This was probably because the C-terminal loop was flexible, for which it is difficult to obtain accurate information. Structural characterization demonstrated that the structure of full-length TGEV nsp1 displayed eight \u2424-sheets and two \u2423-helices ( Fig. 2A) , and the full-length protein shared a common skeleton with the truncated protein.",

Based on the crystal structure of TGEV nsp1, we designed the following series of plasmids in which random coils were replaced with flexible Ser-Gly-Ser-Gly (sg) linkers: nsp1(1-3sg), nsp1(11-15sg), nsp1(19 -22sg), nsp1(37-40sg), nsp1(46 -48sg), nsp1(52-60sg), nsp1(66 -69sg), nsp1(76 -84sg), nsp1(91-95sg), and nsp1(105-109sg) (Fig. 2, B and C) . The Rluc assay showed that the loops comprising amino acids 37-40 and 91-95 were the most important regions for the ability of TGEV nsp1 to inhibit reporter gene expression (Fig. 2C ). Subsequently, Western blot analysis indicated that nsp1(91-95sg) expression was significantly higher than nsp1 expression (Fig. 2C ), again demonstrating that nsp1 could inhibit its own expression (9, 15) . We examined Rluc mRNA expression in HEK-293T cells by real-time quantitative PCR and found that TGEV nsp1(91-95sg) and TGEV nsp1(37-40sg) did not inhibit Rluc mRNA synthesis at different time points (Fig. 3A) . We conducted the ribopuromycylation assay, and the results showed that TGEV nsp1(37-40sg) significantly reduced the inhibition of host gene expression (Fig. 3B ). Because the TGEV nsp1(37-40sg) protein was found to be insoluble in the Escherichia coli supernatant, the motif (amino acids 37-40) was not analyzed further. Based on the above experiments, we focused on TGEV nsp1(91-95sg). Finally, the ribopuromycylation assay demonstrated that the mutant protein no longer inhibited host protein synthesis in a dose-or time-dependent manner (Fig. 3, C and D) . These data indicate that the motif comprising amino acids 91-95 is critical for TGEV nsp1-induced suppression of host gene expression.",

To explore the corresponding motif in \u2423-CoV nsp1, we selected the previously mentioned representative sequences and aligned them using ClustalW2 software. The \u2423-CoV nsp1 amino acid sequence alignment showed that the motif comprising amino acids 91-95 was a relatively conserved domain (Fig. 5A ). Then, we constructed mutant nsp1 proteins from FIPV, HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, and PEDV to explore whether the \u2423-CoV nsp1 motif comprising amino acids 91-95 was an important region for the suppression of host gene expression. Luciferase assays indicated that the important function of this motif (amino acids 91-95) in inhibiting host gene expression not only was exhibited by TGEV nsp1 but also could be extended to nsp1 proteins from other \u2423-CoVs (Fig. 5B) . Furthermore, Western blot analysis revealed that the expression of the mutant proteins was higher than that of the WT proteins, especially for TGEV nsp1 and HCoV-NL63 nsp1 (Fig. 5C) , consistent with the results of the luciferase assays. In addition, we compared the Rluc values between the mutant and the WT nsp1 proteins (Fig. 5D) . These data showed that the relevant motif (amino acids 91-95) might be responsible for inhibiting host gene expression, albeit to different degrees, among the \u2423-CoV nsp1 proteins. Consistent with our previous results (9), when we mutated the motif (amino acids 91-95) in PEDV nsp1, we again observed partial recovery of the ability to suppress Rluc expression. Taken together, these results indicated that the motif comprising amino acids 91-95 was an important conserved region for the regulation of host translation by \u2423-CoV nsp1.",

To evaluate the role of TGEV nsp1 in inhibiting host gene expression during viral replication, we used our reverse-genetics system to construct a recombinant TGEV encoding a mutant nsp1 protein in which ORF3 was replaced by green fluorescent protein (GFP) (19) . Based on the previously described results, we replaced the important motif (amino acids 91-95) in the nsp1-coding sequence. In the resulting mutant virus, the replicase gene start codon, translational reading frame, and residues required for proteolytic release of nsp1 from the replicase polyprotein were maintained (Fig. 6A ). The mutant virus was successfully amplified by transfecting corresponding bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) plasmids into HEK-293T cells. Then, we collected the amplified virus 24 h after transfection to infect TGEV-susceptible cells. Characteristic green fluorescence consistent with the parental virus phenotype was observed 36 h after infection (Fig.  6B ). The recombinant virus, which was subsequently named TGEV(91-95sg), was verified by sequencing the corresponding replaced regions. To assess the stability of TGEV(91-95sg), we analyzed the nsp1-coding region by RT-PCR sequencing after seven passages in PK15 cells, and no nucleotide changes were detected. Furthermore, Western blot analysis confirmed that the virus successfully infected PK15 and swine testicle (ST) cells (Fig. 6C ).",

To further assess the attenuation of TGEV(91-95sg), we performed post-mortem examinations and hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining. In the TGEV group, the stomach was obviously inflated and had undigested flocculate. Moreover, the gastric fundus mucosa was congested, flushed, and bleeding. The stomach wall and small intestinal wall became thin, which was especially true for the jejunum, and animals presented with intestinal dilation with an abundance of yellow liquid. In the TGEV(91-95sg) group, the stomach was slightly inflated, and the gastric fundus mucosa was not bleeding. The small intestinal wall was slightly thinner than that in the mock group. Overall, the damage to the small intestine and stomach in the TGEV group was significantly worse than that in the TGEV(91-95sg) group (Fig. 7D) . Moreover, H&E staining revealed extensive fine damage to different segments of the intestine, characterized by the fragmentation and shedding of intestinal villi. The results showed that the TGEV(91-95sg) group had only mild lesions in both the intestine and stomach compared with the TGEV group (Fig. 7E ). Next, we investigated how nsp1 contributed to the virulence of TGEV by analyzing the viral infection efficiency as reflected by virus shedding (Fig. 8A ) and viral tissue distribution (Fig.  8B ). Fecal samples were obtained with fecal swabs, and virus shedding was tested by regular PCR. The shedding of these groups was measured on days 1-7 and was terminated because of the quick deaths of the infected piglets. At 7 days postinoculation, all surviving piglets were euthanized to reduce the stress of the other piglets. The results showed that the challenged piglets had viruses in their feces. In contrast, no detectable virus shedding was found in the mock-infected pigs. Furthermore, we performed sequencing of the corresponding replaced regions to confirm the stability of the infective virus. Immunohistochemistry showed that the virus was present in susceptible intestinal tissues, consistent with the clinical results. Collectively, these data demonstrate that TGEV(91-95sg) is strongly attenuated in vivo, and we conclude that the nsp1 gene is necessary for virulence.",

The virion host shutoff (vhs) protein is the key regulator of the induced early host shutoff response, and herpes simplex viruses with vhs deleted have been proposed as live attenuated vaccines (25, 26) . Human metapneumovirus protein M2-1 phosphorylation plays important regulatory roles in RNA synthesis, replication, and pathogenesis, and inhibition of M2-1 phosphorylation may serve as a novel approach for development of live attenuated vaccines (27) .",

Although many viral proteins can induce host translational shutoff, nsp1 was the first CoV gene 1 protein recognized to play an important role in inhibiting host gene expression to regulate viral replication. In \u2424-CoVs, deletion of the functional region of nsp1 will be critical for developing attenuated vaccines (11, 17, 35) . However, the role of nsp1 in \u2423-CoV pathogenesis is unknown. In our study, we replaced the important motif in the TGEV nsp1-coding sequence using our reverse genetics technology. Then, we successfully recovered the mutant virus. Subsequently, the viral growth and peak titers of the mutant virus in susceptible cells were found to be indistinguishable from those of the WT virus, indicating that the nsp1 gene was not a critical factor driving viral growth in cell culture (Fig. 6, D and E) . To confirm this conclusion, we also tested the nsp1 expression level during viral infection and found that it was indistinguishable between the mutant and WT viruses (Fig.  6C) . Furthermore, the animal experiments revealed that the determinant region within TGEV nsp1 was critical for viral virulence based on gain-of-function studies. Taken together, the results of this study demonstrate, for the first time, that loss of \u2423-CoV nsp1-induced inhibition of host gene expression does not affect viral replication but significantly reduces virulence.

Previous studies have indicated that the mechanisms by which nsp1 suppresses host gene expression may differ among CoV species (13) (14) (15) 36) . The mechanisms of nsp1-induced host gene suppression have been well-characterized for \u2424-CoVs. Nsp1 proteins of bat CoVs have been shown to bind viral RNA and to suppress host translation (37) . SARS-CoV nsp1 uses a two-pronged strategy to inhibit host gene expression by first interacting with the 40S ribosomal subunit and then inactivating translation (13) . MERS-CoV nsp1 selectively targets transcribed mRNA to inhibit host gene expression (14) . MHV nsp1 interferes efficiently with the type I IFN system to enhance virulence (11) . Nonetheless, structural analysis indicates that CoV nsp1s have a common origin (7) (8) (9) and that the nsp1 proteins of \u2423-CoVs and \u2424-CoVs share a biological function to inhibit host gene expression. Furthermore, previous studies have revealed that the C terminus of MHV and SARS-CoV nsp1 is an important functional region for inhibiting host protein synthesis (10, 11) . However, the conserved important domain underlying the \u2423-CoV nsp1-induced inhibition of host gene expression is unclear. Although we have reported that the loops at amino acid positions 67-71, 78 -85, and 103-110 generate a stable functional region (9) , this functional domain is not present in the TGEV nsp1 protein (12) . To identify the common functional domain in \u2423-CoV nsp1, we selected TGEV nsp1 as a model. Although the structure of a truncated TGEV nsp1 (PDB code 3ZBD) has been reported (8), we wondered whether the C terminus could affect the overall structure. Subsequently, we determined the structure of full-length TGEV nsp1. Structural characterization revealed that full-length TGEV nsp1 shared a common skeleton with truncated nsp1. These similar conformations suggested that the C terminus had no influence on the overall structure of TGEV nsp1.
