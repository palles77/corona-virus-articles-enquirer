            "text": "The main target of COVID-19 is the lungs where it may cause pneumonia in severely ill patients. Chest X-ray is an important diagnostic test to assess the lung for the damaging effects of COVID-19. Many other microbial pathogens can also cause damage to lungs leading to pneumonia but there are certain radiological features which can favor the diagnosis of pneumonia caused by COVID-19. With the rising number of cases of COVID-19, it would be imperative to develop computer programs which may assist the health professionals in the prevailing scenario. Materials & Methods : A total of two hundred and seventy eight (278) images of chest X-rays have been assessed by applying ResNet-50 convolutional neural network architectures in the present study. The digital images were acquired from the public repositories provided by University of Montreal and National Institutes of Health. These digital images of Chest X-rays were divided into three groups labeled as normal, pneumonia and COVID-19. The third group contains digital images of chest X-rays of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 infection while the second group contains images of lung with pneumonia caused by other pathogens. Results : The radiological images included in the data set are 89 images of lungs with COVID-19 infection, 93 images of lungs without any radiological abnormality and 96 images of patient with pneumonia caused by other pathogens. In this data set, 80% of the images were employed for training, and 20% for testing. A pre-trained (on ImageNet data set) ResNet-50 architecture was used to diagnose the cases of COVID-19 infections on lung Xray images. The analysis of the data revealed that computer vision based program achieved diagnostic accuracy of 98.18 %, and F1-score of 98.19. Conclusion : The performance of convolutional neural network regarding the differentiation of pulmonary changes caused by COVID-19 from the other type of pneumonias on digital images of the chest X-rays is excellent and it may be an extremely useful adjunct tool for the health professionals.",

Corona virus is an enveloped RNA virus. There are four most common types of human corona viruses (229E, NL63, OC43, and HKU1) which causes upper respiratory tract infections such as common cold [1] . Some new strains of corona viruses like SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and a recently identified COVID-2019 virus evolved from corona viruses which are zoonotic in origin and these types can cause cataclysmic ailment in human being. The Middle East respiratory syndrome corona virus (MERS-CoV) is transferred to human beings from the camels. The civet cats are the source of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and from these infected cats; it is transmitted to human beings. An outbreak of SARS-CoV has been reported from china in 2002-2003 and MERS-CoV has been identified in the patients with pneumonia in Middle East [2] [3] [4] .And now the recently identified novel coronavirus (COVID -2019) has been detected in the patients in the Wuhan city of China [5] . The mode of transmission is person to person via respiratory droplets and median incubation period is four days [6] . The disease in mild in majority of patients but in some cases severe to critical illness may occur which is characterized by breathing difficulty to respiratory failure. The severity of disease is more associated with old age. Pneumonia is the most common problem in case of severe disease. The patients with pneumonia present with the clinical features of fever, fatigue, dry cough, anorexia, myalgia, dyspnea and sputum production [7] . Radiological imaging is an important tool for the evaluation of lung diseases. In COVID-19 infection, CT scan revealed ground glass opacification which are usually bilateral and involve peripheral area of lower lobe of lungs and the radiological findings may also be present even in subclinical cases [8] .",

Extensive efforts are being done to prevent the infection and to control the damage caused by this pathogen but with the passage of time more and more cases are being diagnosed with COVID-19 infection. The most important organ attacked by COVID-19 is lung, which leads to inflammatory changes in lungs and it may cause respiratory insufficiency. The reduced oxygen supply (hypoxia) to the human cells will have deleterious effects on the human living cells and ultimately multi-organ failure may also develop in some cases which has high mortality rate. The radiological assessment of lung is important part of patient care in the severely ill patient infected with COVID-19. The evaluation of radiological imaging is a specialized job and requires the opinion of the consultant radiologist. In the prevailing current scenario, it would be imperative to develop adjunct tool which could assist the health professionals who are heavily burdened in the current situation. In this regard, one of the important areas is the interpretation of radiological images with the help of artificial intelligence. The application of deep learning machine approached may yield promising results in the detection of morphological changes in the lung of patients infected with COVID-19 on digital images of chest X-rays. The computer vision based programs may identify the subtle changes on the digital images which may not be detectable or visible to human eye. The convolutional neural network has been applied for the diagnosis of tuberculosis on the Chest X-rays and it has revealed very good results [15] . Similarly another study revealed that deep learning algorithms can help in the identification of lung opacities, enlargement of heart and pleural effusion on chest X-rays [16] . Due to the better automated feature extraction capability, the convolutional neural networks which have been trained on natural images turned out to be very successful in the classification of images [17] . The performance of convolutional neural network related to the imaging modalities with less human intervention has been found to be better than other conventional methods of machine learning [18] .",
