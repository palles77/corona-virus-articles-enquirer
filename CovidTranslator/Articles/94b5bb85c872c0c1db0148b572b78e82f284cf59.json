While viral genetic material could be detected by RT-PCR in stools for up to 50 days, no virus could be cultured after 3 weeks of illness from corresponding specimens (12) . Although long-term viral excretion has important public health implications through its potential spread of the virus to the environment, no study has yet explored factors associated with prolonged viral excretion and risk for transmission to household contacts. Our study was designed to investigate prospectively the viral shedding from a cohort of Beijing SARS patients for up to 6 months. Clinical and epidemiologic data were used to identify the potential risk factors for prolonged virus shedding. Household contacts of SARS patients were clinically monitored for secondary transmission.",

All subsequent samples from the same patients were then tested until three consecutive samples were negative; the first negative sample defined the time of negativation. RNA from clinical samples was extracted by using the QIAamp virus RNA mini kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), as instructed by the manufacturer. Total RNA was then reverse transcribed with random hexamers, and cDNA was amplified with two primer pairs. The first pair, COR-1/COR-2, is one of the primer pairs recommended by the World Health Organization (http://www.who.int/csr/SARS/primers/en/). The second pair, R1/R2, was designed to amplify a 220-bp fragment of the replicase gene (R1: 5\u2032 AGG TTA GCT AAC GAG TGT GCG 3\u2032, R2: 5\u2032AGC CTG TGT TGT AGA TTG CGG 3\u2032). These two primer pairs, COR-1/COR-2 and R1/R2, had been selected among others (including Cor-p-F2/Cor-p-R1, Cor-p-F3/Cor-p-R1, SAR1s/SAR1as) for their higher sensitivity (87% and 95%, respectively), using serologic testing as the standard. Congruence between the results of the two tests was 86% (F. Tang, pers. comm.). Only specimens with positive results for both primer pairs were considered positive, so that false-positive results were eliminated. During this procedure, positive and negative controls were systematically included and treated in the same way as the virus sample.",

            "text": "This study is the first to document duration of SARS-CoV excretion in sputum and stool in a cohort of SARS patients. The median duration of viral excretion was 3 weeks in sputa and 4 weeks in stool samples. This estimate might be high, since some patients with no or short viral excretion might have been missed because of the study design. In most patients (45 of 56), the duration of viral excretion in both specimens was identical, while it was longer in stool samples compared to sputa for 11 patients. The long duration of excretion (>100 days after onset of symptoms) observed in stools of four patients suggests that independent replication of virus may take place in the intestinal tract. Three of these four patients had coexisting conditions, a known risk factor for prolonged SARS illness (13, 14) . Prolonged viral excretion may have important public health implications if responsible for spread of the virus to other persons or to the environment. Two findings of this study are reassuring in this regard: one is the failure of all attempts to isolate the virus from positive RT-PCR specimens collected in convalescent patients, which suggests that excreted virus was no longer infectious; the other is the absence of SARS in close contacts of convalescent patients during the study period.",
