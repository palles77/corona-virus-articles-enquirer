            "text": "SARS coronavirus continues to cause sporadic cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in China. No active or passive immunoprophylaxis for disease induced by SARS coronavirus is available. We investigated prophylaxis of SARS coronavirus infection with a neutralising human monoclonal antibody in ferrets, which can be readily infected with the virus. Prophylactic administration of the monoclonal antibody at 10 mg/kg reduced replication of SARS coronavirus in the lungs of infected ferrets by 3\u00b73 logs (95% CI 2\u00b76-4\u00b70 logs; p<0\u00b7001), completely prevented the development of SARS coronavirus-induced macroscopic lung pathology (p=0\u00b7013), and abolished shedding of virus in pharyngeal secretions. The data generated in this animal model show that administration of a human monoclonal antibody might offer a feasible and effective prophylaxis for the control of human SARS coronavirus infection. 0 \u00b7 0 3 0 \u00b7 0 5 0 \u00b7 1 0 \u00b7 2 0 \u00b7 4 0 \u00b7 8 1 \u00b7 6 3 \u00b7 2 6 \u00b7 3 1 2 \u00b7 5 incubated for 1 h at 37\u00b0C with different concentrations of CR3014 or control antibody. The presence or absence of a cytopathic effect was scored in each well on day 5 after infection, and the percentage of protected wells was noted ( figure 1D ). We tested the in-vivo potency of this antibody in ferrets, because these animals can be readily infected with SARS coronavirus by the intratracheal route, replicate the virus to high titres in the lung, and develop macroscopic and microscopic lung lesions. 3 Experimental infection of ferrets with human respiratory viruses, including influenza viruses, is common practice, therefore procedures to work with these animals under the biocontainment conditions required for SARS coronavirus are well established. Approval for animal experiments was obtained from the institutional animal welfare committee.",

Pharyngeal swabs were taken from the animals before challenge and on days 2, 4, and 7 after challenge, and frozen at -70\u00b0C before being subjected to quantitative RT-PCR. Two animals from each of the four groups were killed on days 4 and 7 and necropsies were done according to a standard protocol. For assessment of lung inflammation associated with SARS coronavirus infection, haematoxylineosin-stained sections from the cranial and caudal parts of the lung were examined for inflammatory foci by light microscopy with a 10\u03eb objective. For measurement of the SARS coronavirus titre, homogenates were prepared from 0\u00b71-0\u00b73 g of lung tissue pooled from cranial, medial, and caudal parts of the lung.",

            "text": "We generated a human IgG1 monoclonal antibody, CR3014, reactive with whole inactivated SARS coronavirus, by antibody phage display technology screening a large naive antibody library. Binding of this antibody to the viral peplomers was visualised by electron microscopy with indirect two-step immunogold labelling. SARS coronavirus from the supernatant of infected Vero cells was adsorbed to copper grids coated with carbon and Pioloform, which were incubated with the monoclonal antibodies by floating on droplets for 30 min at room temperature. Bound monoclonal antibodies were detected by incubation on droplets of anti-human-IgG-gold-5 nm conjugates (British Biocell, Cardiff, UK). The grids were negative contrasted with 1% uranyl acetate and assessed with a ZEISS EM 10 A transmission electron microscope ( figure 1A, 1B) . CR3014 was shown to react with the cell-surface expressed spike glycoprotein of SARS coronavirus: HEK293T cells were transfected with the plasmid-expressed, codon-optimised full-length glycoprotein spike, and stained with CR3014 and an R-phycoerythrin-labelled second antibody after 48 h using standard procedures for FACS-analysis ( figure  1C) . CR3014 was also shown to neutralise SARS coronavirus in vitro: triplicate wells of Vero cells were infected with 100 TCID 50 (50% tissue culture infective dose) of SARS coronavirus strain HK-39849, and pre- figure  2C ) and a reduction of microscopic lesions compared with controls, which all showed multifocal lesions on gross necropsy ( figure 2D ). Shedding of SARS coronavirus in the throat was completely abolished in three of the four animals treated with CR3014 ( figure 2B) . However, in one animal the level of SARS coronavirus excretion was similar to that noted in the control group. The concentration of CR3014 in the serum of this ferret before challenge was less than 5 g/mL, compared with 65-84 g/mL in the other three animals, suggesting inappropriate antibody administration. Neutralising serum titres in this animal were less than half of those in the other animals on day 0 (titre of 5 against 100 TCID 50 ), and were not detectable on day 2 after infection, compared with a titre of 5-10 against 100 TCID 50 in the other animals on day 2. SARS coronavirus has been detected in nasopharyngeal aspirates of up to 72% of SARS patients, being associated with increased mortality, and in the lungs of all autopsied patients by viral isolation or RT-PCR. 4 On the basis of our data and the successful prophylaxis of respiratory syncytial virus disease with a humanised monoclonal antibody (Palivizumab), we reason that immunoprophylaxis of SARS coronavirus infection with a human monoclonal antibody might be an option for the control of SARS. 5 The prophylactic dose we used for CR3014 (10 mg/kg) is less than the 15 mg/kg dose at which Palivizumab is given intramuscularly to at-risk infants once a month. If CR3014 reduced the replication of SARS coronavirus in people to the same extent as in ferrets, and in view of the serum halflife of up to 20 days for IgG1 in human beings, one intramuscular administration of CR3014 at the dose used in this study should protect an adult for the length of at least one to two SARS coronavirus incubation periods (median 4-6 days). Passive immunisation with CR3014 might, therefore, be a feasible approach to prevent lung manifestations in people exposed to SARS coronavirus, and prevent person-to-person spread of the virus by abolishment of viral shedding in pharyngeal secretions.",
