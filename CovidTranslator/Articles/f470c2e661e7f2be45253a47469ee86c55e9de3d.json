Of those, 2 predominated and 2 were detected only once each; one of these may have been a reassortment of the two predominant electropherotypes. Analysis of the clinical features of patients excreting rotavirus subgroup 1 or 2, determined by PAGE, demonstrated that rotavirus subgroup 1 was associated with more hypotonic dehydration and need for intravenous therapy: lethargy was signi6cantly more common among those excreting rotavirus subgroup 2.",

However, the detection of rotaviruses in 3 of 10 children not suffering from diarrhoea implied that this association was not unequivocal. High levels of asymptomatic rotavirus infection among children have been reported previously (CHAMPSAUR et al., 1984) and asymptomatic infection is known to occur among the newborn, and in older children experiencing reinfection. That the major age group affected was 6 to 24 months of age is in agreement with other studies (e.g., KAPIKIAN et al., 1976; MIDDLETON et al., 1977) . The initial assays for rotavirus used the Dakopatts ELISA kit and were performed in Sarawak on freshly collected samples. This test, the reagents of which were carried in hand luggage from London, provided the local clinicians with a cheap, simple test, the accuracy of which was confirmed by subsequent analysis by EM and PAGE. Although the local clinicians welcomed the provision of a rotavirus diagnostic service the results did not affect patient management, in that patients with rotavirus-induced diarrhoea as well as other forms responded equally favourably to oral rehydration if treatment was given early. Thus the service was not continued after completion of the study.",

Such may be the case in the copulation stu-died here, as ody two electropheroiyies predominated. The same electropherotypes (1A and 2A) predominated in locations about 115 km apart, whereas in a similar 15 month study in Kenya only one of 34 electropherotypes detected in locations 480 km apart was found in both areas (CHIBA et al., 1984) . Population movement between Sibu and Kapit is quite extensive, and the similarity of electropherotypes probably resulted from the spread of virus to a population too small to maintain endemic rotavirus infection. Although CHIBA et al. (1984) reported frequent exchange of people between Nairobi and Mombasa, both areas are densely populated and rotavirus infection is endemic all year round.",

The one similar studv had shown no differences in severity of fever, vomifing or diarrhoea between the two subgroups, although the syndrome was thought to be of longer duration with subgroup 2 rotaviruses, which the authors suggested might indicate that subgroup 2 rotaviruses were more virulent (WHITE et al., 1984) . In most studies of diarrhoea subgroup 2 roiavirusks predominate, again suggesting thit &ese viruses are more virulent (YOLKEN et al., 1978; WHITE et ul., 1984) , although rotavirus subgroup i outbreaks have also been reported (ALBERT et al., 1983) . In this study we observed that diarrhoeal illness associated with the short electropherotype lA, the predominant variant, and presumed subgroup 1, involved more hypotonic dehydration and necessity for intravenous therapy than that associated with the long electropherotype 2A, presumed subgroup 2. Lethargy was significantly more common with the long electropherotype 2A. Analysis of all relevant investigations suggests, therefore, that subgroup specificity and severity of disease are unlikely to be linked. A recent report linking rotavirus virulence in newborn mice with gene segment 4 (OFFIT et al., 1986) seems to con&m this-contusion.",
