Age and SARI were significantly associated with influenza. FluB circulation was higher is 2013. Conclusions: In the post-epidemic period, influenza remains an important cause of hospitalization in SARI patients.",

Even though influenza infections comprised only 10% of the total cases of RV detected in this study, these viruses represented 44% of all cases with myalgia. Furthermore, influenza infections tended to cause more severe disease, with more cases of SARI; however, this finding should be confirmed by prospective studies with higher numbers of patients. Of the 775 total cases in this study, 70% (535/775) were diagnosed with SARI and 57% (444/775) were virus-positive, 8% of which were positive for influenza ( Table 2 ). Adjusted analysis showed that patients who were older, with SARI, and with myalgia had increased chances of positive results for influenza.

However, unlike previous findings, no association was observed between influenza circulation and rainfall during the study period 12 . Studies on influenza seasonality in Brazil have shown distinct patterns of viral circulation; in the Northeast region, influenza circulates in the first 4 months of the year, overlapping with a period of higher humidity in that area 13, 14 . These different circulation profiles due to the climatic conditions of each region impact the vaccine effectiveness, which in tropical regions has been carried out in a period subsequent to viral circulation. The 10.4% influenza positivity among samples found is similar to that in previous reports 7, 12, 14 ; however, the present study tested a larger number of influenza A virus samples for subtypes. In Brazil, there was a non-homogeneous distribution of influenza A subtypes. Laboratory surveillance data in the Southern region showed a higher frequency of influenza A/H1N1pdm than A/H3N2, at 61% and 38%, respectively. In the Northeastern region, which has different climatic conditions, there was circulation of influenza A/H3N2 in the first 16 epidemiological weeks (EW) and then an increased detection of H1N1pdm between the 20 th. and 30 th EW, but with a lower intensity than occurred in the Southeastern and Southern regions 4 . These findings highlight the need to subtype influenza samples from distinct regions to improve the surveillance system. (13) 3/46 (7) 17/46 (37) ",
