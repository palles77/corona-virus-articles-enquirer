Several prognostic indexes based on presenting clinical and laboratory parameters (eg, PaO 2 to FIO 2 ratio, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation [APACHE] II, and metabolomics) have been proposed, and might assist risk stratification. 4 The magnitude of improvement in outcomes over neuraminidase inhibitor treatment alone, and its risk-to-benefit ratio will need to be further addressed because of several potential safety concerns ",
