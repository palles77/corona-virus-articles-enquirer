Evidently the virus becomes stored in a sensory ganglion, the attack being caused by a migration of the virus along the nerve root. When the nerve affected is the ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve, the area served by it exhibits signs, i.e. the eye, the orbit and surrounding areas. This is known as Herpes zoster ophthalmicus, in which the cornea becomes inflamed and oedematous, and sensitivity may be impaired permanently.

These compounds have been demonstrated to have cytotoxic effects which are time and concentration dependent (Takahashi, 1982) , but which are less than those of benzalkonium chloride (Gasset, 1974) , and their use in many contact lens solutions has led to the increasing incidence of allergic reactions (Gold, 1983) .",

Basically, anything that can be boiled without adversely affecting its performance should be, e.g. bowls, soft contact lenses. Items of equipment that will touch the eye should be swabbed with 70% alcohol, e.g. tonometer heads, chin rests, trial frames. Working surfaces should be treated with 1% sodium hypochlorite solution, which is effective against bacteria and viruses. At levels as low as 500 ppm (0.05%) it destroys Herpes simplex, Adenovirus 8 and Enterovirus 70 within 10 minutes (Naginton, Satehall and Whipps, 1983) .
