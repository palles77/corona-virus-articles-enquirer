The statistical significance of results obtained for different challenge microbial agents and for different mask configurations (masks with operational or nonoperational ventilation fans and masks with sealed Smart Valves) was assessed. Results: The results demonstrate >99.7% efficiency of each test mask configuration for exclusion of influenza A virus, rhinovirus 14, and S. aureus and >99.3% efficiency for paraffin oil and sodium chloride (surrogates for PM 2.5 ). Statistically significant differences in effectiveness of the different mask configurations were not identified. The efficiencies of the masks for excluding smaller-size (i.e., rhinovirus and bacteriophage \u03a6\u03a7174) vs. larger-size microbial agents (influenza virus, S. aureus) were not significantly different. Conclusions: The masks, with or without features intended for enhancing comfort, provide protection against both small-and large-size pathogens. Importantly, the mask appears to be highly efficient for filtration of pathogens, including influenza and rhinoviruses, as well as the fine particulates (PM 2.5 ) present in aerosols that represent a greater challenge for many types of dental and surgical masks. This renders this individual-use N95 respiratory mask an improvement over the former types of masks for protection against a variety of environmental contaminants including PM 2.5 and pathogens such as influenza and rhinoviruses.",

The purpose of the one-way Smart Valve is to limit the air flow into the mask through the valve such that all of the air must pass through the filter material. On the other hand, exhaled air may pass out of the mask through the valve. The purpose of the fan is to aid in the removal of exhaled air from the interior of the mask.

A downstream vacuum was turned on to create an air flow (28.3 L/min) through the mask that was intended to mimic human breathing (17) . After the delivery of the aerosol, the upstream air pressure was turned off and the downstream vacuum pump was left on for another minute to pull residual aerosol from the chambers into the one-stage Andersen sampler. Virus aerosol that passed through the mask was captured on a Petri dish containing semi-solid medium (5% gelatin/minimal essential medium). The collected sample was liquefied at 36\u00b12 \u2103 for approximately 10 min. The resulting samples were divided into separate portions for ribonucleic acid (RNA) extraction and for infectivity assays (18) . Viral infectivity was measured on the basis of cytopathic effect (CPE) generated in MDCK cells (for influenza virus) and H1-HeLa cells (for rhinovirus). For the infectivity assay, a ten-fold dilution series of the samples collected as described above was prepared in a dilution medium. The sample dilutions were then inoculated onto the host cells. After 4-9 days of incubation, the CPE was scored under a phase-contrast light microscope. Viral titers were calculated in units of log 10 50% tissue culture infectious doses (TCID 50 ) per mL according to Spearman-K\u00e4rber (19) .",

The use of face masks for this purpose is more common in certain geographical regions, such as China and India, where population densities are higher, and the residents are more likely to be chronically exposed to PM 2.5 levels exceeding annual World Health Organization Air Quality Guidelines (<10 \u03bcg/m 3 ) (9). The compliance of use of respiratory face masks should be facilitated by features such as the Smart Valve and operational Micro Ventilator (Figure 1) , which are designed to aid in the evacuation of exhaled gases from the interior of the mask (11) . The enhancement of user comfort may be measured quantitatively through assessment of gas content in the dead space of the mask and systemic and facial thermoregulation (11) . Goh et al. (submitted for publication)] found, in a clinical study in children aged 7-14 years, that wearing this test mask without Micro Ventilator increased the end-tidal CO 2 (ETCO 2 ) and fractional concentration of inspired CO 2 (FICO 2 ), compared to children without masks at rest and during brisk walking. In contrast, wearing the mask with operational Micro Ventilator brought FICO 2 levels for both activities closer to baseline levels obtained in children not wearing the mask. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulation experiments conducted in adult subjects have demonstrated that the introduction of a ventilation fan to the N95 mask is a feasible option for reducing CO 2 accumulation in the dead space of the mask and also for controlling the temperature of the air within the dead space (21, 22) . The clinical study [Goh YTD, Mun MW, Lee WLJ, et al. A randomised clinical trial to evaluate the safety, fit, comfort of a novel N95 mask in children. (submitted for publication)] confirmed the earlier CFD studies indicating reduction of CO 2 in the dead space of the mask with operational ventilator fan. Furthermore, CFD studies performed in adult subjects have demonstrated reduction in heat, CO 2 , and moisture build-up within N95 masks configured with operational ventilator fans (21, 22) . Moisture build-up in N95 masks used in high humidity atmospheres has been shown to reduce filtration efficiency of the masks for Ebola-Makona virus (23) .",

These requirements were met by the test mask with operational Smart Valve and Micro Ventilator fan. Additional evidence that the Smart Valve and Micro Ventilator fan results in a mask that provides acceptable breathing resistance characteristics (inhalation and exhalation) is the fact that the test mask was awarded an N95 rating by NIOSH. Testing for satisfaction of this rating includes evaluation of inhalation and exhalation resistance (16) . The use of respiratory face masks with operational ventilation fans is therefore useful both from a comfort-enhancement perspective as well as for providing optimal filtration efficiency. Ideally, any features added to a respiratory protective device solely for the purpose of enhancing wearer comfort should not adversely impact the primary function of the device, which is to filter airborne particulates and infectious agents from the contaminated air. In the present study, we have assessed the efficiency of the test mask for filtration of surrogate pathogens (bacteria and respiratory viruses) and pollutants. Various configurations of the mask ( Table 1) were challenged, including the mask with operating Micro Ventilator, the mask with operating Smart Valve but without Micro Ventilator, and the mask with the Smart Valve covered/sealed. The latter configuration would be considered \"best case\" for excluding experimentally aerosolized contaminants [surrogate pathogens/particulates such as PM 2.5 (16, 24) ], while the fully operational Micro Ventilator would be considered \"worst case\" for this purpose. For instance, a poorly functioning Smart Valve may allow environmental contaminants into the interior of the mask, defeating the purpose of the mask as a filtration device.",

For example, Lindsley et al.

On theoretical grounds, a face mask with a Smart Valve should allow unfiltered exhaled air to exit the mask.

The filtration efficiency of the test mask in the present study was >99.9% for sodium chloride and >99.3% for paraffin oil. The latter result indicates that the filter material used in the test mask displays oil resistance. As such, the test mask would be expected to provide filtration efficiency for combustion products (40) in addition to the efficiency demonstrated for sodium chloride (a surrogate for allergens and pollutants such as PM 2.5 ).

A controlled clinical study failed, however, to reveal a significant difference in protection of healthcare workers using fit-tested vs. nonfit-tested N95 masks (42) . As with other clinical trials of this type mentioned above, the study may not have been powered sufficiently to detect any differences. In addition, compliance was not complete in the study (masks were worn 68-79% of the time) and the degree of leakage in the not-fit-test arm was not assessed. Judging from the low rate of fit-test failures observed in the fit-test arm (1.1%), the actual amount of leakage that occurred in the non-fit-tested arm may have been very low (i.e., the lack of fit testing likely did not correspond to leaky masks in that treatment arm) (42) .

The mask provides protection against both small-and large-size pathogens and the surrogate particulate results suggest that the mask should also be effective at excluding pollutants such as PM 2.5 and allergens. Importantly, the mask appears to be highly efficient for filtration of pathogens including influenza and rhinoviruses and fine particulates present in aerosols which represent a greater challenge for many types of dental and surgical masks. This renders these individual-use masks an improvement over the former types of masks for protection against a variety of environmental contaminants including pathogens such as influenza and rhinoviruses.",
