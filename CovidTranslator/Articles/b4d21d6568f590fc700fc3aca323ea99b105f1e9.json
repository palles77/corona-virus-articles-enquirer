Intestinal x-rays have shown punctate ulcerations in the stomach and small intestine, especially the ileum. Calicivirus has been identified by electronmicroscopy in several outbreaks of gastroenteritis among children. Certain structural features bear resemblance to the Norwalk agent, although this point remains disputed. There have been reports of astrovirus and coronavirus causing infections in humans, but because these viruses cannot be propagated in tissue culture or in experimental animals, a feature common to many of the viral pathogens of diarrheal disease, there is a paucity of information on their overall significance.",

Indeed, it is estimated that two-thirds of epidemics of gastroenteritis that are clinically and epidemiologically viral in origin cannot be diagnosed by the available techniques. In endemic diarrheal disease, ~30%-50% of cases are not assigned to a specific pathogen, and the majority of these infections are probably caused by as yet undiscovered viral pathogens. Thus, because 10% of exacerbations of IBD were recognized with the available techniques, and because only one-third of putative viral infections can be diagnosed by these methods, one could estimate that up to 30% of such exacerbations could be caused by viruses, were it possible to identify all such agents.",

In New England, we have seen a great increase in locally acquired Giardia infections, even in such pristine beauty spots as the White Mountains. Patients with IBD receive antimicrobial drugs for a variety of reasons, just like many other members of our society. These drugs can trigger an attack of antibiotic-associated diarrhea caused by Clostridium difticile. Even sulfonamides, such as contained in salazopyrine, can cause this condition.",

Diarrhea is one of the major complaints that brings patients to a doctor's office or causes them to lose time from school or work. It is the estimate of most experts that these diarrhea attacks are caused, in the main, by viral agents as yet unrecognized. When a patient with established IBD has an exacerbation of diarrhea, we tend to blame the underlying disease without looking for an intercurrent cause. Some of these attacks could be treated by a specific drug, if the pathogen was known, i.e., the bacterial pathogens and C. difticile. Viral agents cannot be treated at the present time; however, we might be willing to temporize with relatively mild symptomatic therapies before going on to steroids and antimetabolites, if we knew the process was intrinsically self-limited.",

It is clear that even the injured intestine has a stereotyped range of responses. A viral infection apparently can even trigger a prolonged exacerbation of symptoms. Herein may lie one of the secrets of IBD itself, for it is possible that all exacerbations of IBD are exogenous insults, caused by a virus or perhaps another pathogen, which are inflicted on an abnormal bowel, unable to cope with the environmental stresses to which we are all subjected. If we could understand how the healthy bowel repairs itself after a viral or bacterial infection, we might understand why the patient with IBD goes on with grinding diarrhea and associated symptoms after a seemingly trivial event.",

            "text": "an hour before finding the elusive Entameba histolytiea trophozoite permanently weakened my confidence in the average hospital laboratory to be similarly successful; the problems encountered in stool searches are apparently limitless (1, 2) . There are certain geographic nuances involved in the diagnosis of systemic and enteric forms of amebiasis that are well known to epidemiologists of this disease. In countries like the United States, where amebiasis has, until recently, been relatively uncommon, the use of antiamebic serologic testing has been of value because a positive serum antibody as revealed by the indirect hemagglutination (IHA) or precipitin test has been a signal that alerts the clinician to redouble efforts to find the organism in a given patient. But, as already mentioned, examination of stool specimens is of variable quality. In those countries where amebiasis is common and microscopic skills perhaps kept more sharply honed, a positive serology is of lesser value because circulating antibody may simply reflect past infection. It is clear that a sensitive and specific test for the presence of amebic proteins or other constituents in blood or stool continues to be an urgent requirement for the diagnosis and control of this disease. The recent advances in hepatitis are sufficient testimony to the profound value of being able to directly recognize the presence of an infectious agent. Because of modern advances in subcellular fractionation and isolation of bacterial, protozoan, and metazoan parasites and the new developments in the area of monoclonal antibodies and molecular biology and genetics, one can almost become optimistic that patients with amebiasis will soon benefit from this scientific ferment.",

            "text": "Because biological variability exists, it is not common to encounter the figure 100% in biomedical research-but for all practical purposes, an example appears in Figure 2 of the paper by S. Pillai and A. Mohimen in this issue of GASTROENTEROLOGY (1982;83:1210-6). These investigators report that a solid-phase radioimmunoassay of human serum for the antigens of E. histolytica specifically and reliably identifies patients having either enteric or hepatic forms of amebic infection, and in a subgroup representing 6 of the 21 patients, the measured antigens fell to control levels by 6 weeks after successful therapy. Although this is a provocative study delivering good news that obviously calls for the most vigorous and dispassionate confirmation by other laboratories, a careful reading of the report indicates that this line of investigation has not been easy. The axenic (bacteria-free) cultivation of E. histolytica requires the presence of mammalian serum in the culture medium, and proteins of such serum often adhere to the cultured organisms. If such binding occurs and the ameba are used as antigens, the GASTROENTEROLOGY Vol. 83, No.6 resulting antisera typically contain unwanted antiprotein antibodies that foreclose the possibility for their use in serologic testing. Cognizant of this problem, Pillai and Mohimen undertook the removal of such antibodies by the technique of immunoabsorption of this antiserum on columns containing immobilized bovine serum; this strategy apparently yielded antiamebic antibody of sufficient specificity for their assay. It is noteworthy that the report does not concern itself with the identification of the antigen detected in patient sera. Based on numerous studies from other laboratories (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) , there are likely to be an extensive collection of specific antigens available from E. histolytica to allow further pursuit of this line of investigation, and subsequent efforts will undoubtedly use the newer hybridoma technology for the isolation of highly specific monoclonal antiamebic antibody.",

            "text": "Pillai and Mohimen address most of the problems that one might raise about their work. For example, their inability to detect amebic antigens in serum that has not undergone a preliminary precipitation by polyethylene glycol (PEG) is somewhat troublesome. Because PEG is here used to precipitate immune complexes, the authors attribute their results to the presence of circulating uncomplexed antigen that, unless they are left behind in solution, can theoretically block the radioimmunoassay. This explanation can be tested experimentally and will doubtless be part of their subsequent work. Another explanation for this finding is that human antibody used in the assay may have specificity not only for the antigen, but also for the antibody in the complex, thus representing a \"rheumatoid factor\" that fortuitously binds to the Fc region of immunoglobulin engaged in complex formation, as in other infectious diseases. Moreover, one would like to be certain that the complex precipitated by PEG is indeed immunologic-Eo histolytiea produces numerous proteolytic enzymes (hence its name) that can bind to one of the several available plasma proteinase inhibitors, and such a complex could be precipitable and recognized antigenic ally (8) . Great care is needed in the critical adjustment of PEG concentration for precipitation of true immune complexes. These points are not meant to detract from their apparent success in recognizing amebic antigens in serum, but to urge caution in using PEG precipitation as a totally reliable index of immune complex formation. Other immunochemical details of their assay clearly require further definition as evidenced by Figures 2  and 3 in their report, revealing that both human ( Figure 2 ) and rabbit ( Figure 3) antibodies precipitate the antigen used, but only human antibodies work properly in the radioimmunoassay. It is likely that the fate in plasma of foreign macromolecules arising from a protozoan of this type may be much more complex than presently realized (9) , but in a sense, the more that happens in host-parasite interactions, the more footholds one can find as investigative tools.",
