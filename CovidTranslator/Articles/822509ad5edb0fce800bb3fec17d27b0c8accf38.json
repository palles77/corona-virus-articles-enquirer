            "text": "Financial volatility refers to the intensity of the fluctuations in the expected return on an investment or the pricing of a financial asset due to market uncertainties. Hence, volatility modeling and forecasting is imperative to financial market investors, as such projections allow the investors to adjust their trading strategies in anticipation of the impending financial market movements. Following this, financial volatility trading is the capitalization of the uncertainties of the financial markets to realize investment profits in times of rising, falling and side-way market conditions. In this paper, an intelligent straddle trading system (framework) that consists of a volatility projection module (VPM) and a trade decision module (TDM) is proposed for financial volatility trading via the buying and selling of option straddles to help a human trader capitalizes on the underlying uncertainties of the Hong Kong stock market. Three different measures, namely: (1) the historical volatility (HV), (2) implied volatility (IV) and (3) model-based volatility (MV) of the Hang Seng Index (HSI) are employed to quantify the implicit volatility of the Hong Kong stock market. The TDM of the proposed straddle trading system combines the respective volatility measures with the well-established moving-averages convergence/divergence (MACD) principle to recommend trading actions to a human trader dealing in HSI straddles. However, the inherent limitation of the MACD trading rule is that it generates time-delayed trading signals due to the use of moving averages, which are essentially lagging trend indicators. This drawback is intuitively addressed in the proposed straddle trading system by applying the VPM to compute future projections of the volatility measures of the HSI prior to the activation of the TDM. The VPM is realized by a self-organising neural-fuzzy semantic network named the evolving fuzzy semantic memory (eFSM) model. As compared to existing statistical and computational intelligence based modeling techniques currently employed for financial volatility modeling and forecasting, eFSM possesses several desirable attributes such as: (1) an evolvable knowledge base to continuously address the non-stationary characteristics of the Hong Kong stock market; (2) highly formalized human-like information computations; and (3) a transparent structure that can be interpreted via a set of linguistic IF-THEN semantic fuzzy rules. These qualities provide added credence to the computed HSI volatility projections. The volatility modeling and forecasting performances of the eFSM, when benchmarked to several established modeling techniques, as well as the observed trading returns of the proposed straddle trading system, are encouraging.",

            "text": "Investment risk refers to an extensive set of factors or events that erodes the financial value of an investment (Poon, 2005) . This includes credit risk (i.e. loss due to a debtor's non-payment) and liquidity risk due to the market's small capitalization. Hence, financial volatility is one indication of investment risk and is often viewed as a risk metric (Holton, 2003) . Financial volatility forecasting is important as volatility is often used as a proxy to measure financial or market risk caused by the underlying uncertainties of the financial market movements (which can have significant positive or negative effects on the values of investment portfolios) due to a myriad of factors. These factors may include recessions, wars, structural changes in the economy, tax law changes, interest rate hikes, inflation pressures, investor anxiety and even changes in consumer preferences. Furthermore, when viewed as a measure of market uncertainty, financial volatility is a key input in many investment decisions and portfolio creations (Aizenman & Marion, 1999; Chan, Karceski, & Lakonishok, 1999) . The extensive body of research on volatility modeling and forecasting (Anderson, Bollerslev, & Lange, 1999; Blair, Poon, & Taylor, 2001; Engle, 2002; Hamid, 2004; Noh, Engle, & Kane, 1994; Poon & Granger, 2003) has reflected the importance of financial volatility to investment decision-making (Busse, 1999; Galeotti & Schiantarelli, 1994; Okuyama & Francis, 2006) , security valuation (De Santis, Gerard, & Hillion, 1997; Hsu, 2000) , risk management (Christoffersen & Diebold, 2000; Granger, 2002) as well as monetary policy making (Nasar, 1992) . Volatility is also a key component in the pricing of derivative securities such as equity options (Duan & Simonato, 2001; Figlewski, 1997; Hull & White, 1987; Noh et al., 1994) , where there has been an exponential growth in the trading volume in recent years due to the extensive use of derivatives instruments as hedging and risk management tools. In addition, national policy makers, financial regulators and central banks often relied on estimates of financial volatility to assess the effectiveness of regulatory measures on the financial markets (Poon & Granger, 2003) . Given its widespread importance, it is therefore not surprising that financial volatility has emerged as a key asset class in today's financial markets. That is, sophisticated investors can trade in financial instruments defined on market volatility. For example, the VIX index 1 (Chicago Board Options Exchange) introduced in 2003 by the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) is based on the short term volatilities of options issued on the S&P 500 index, which tracks the stock performances of 500 large-cap corporations trading on the US stock markets (i.e. NYSE and Nasdaq). The creation of the VIX volatility index allows a savvy investor to leverage on his estimates of the fluctuations of the financial market movements through the use of futures contracts to achieve investment profits during rising, falling and side-ways markets.",

Excellent reviews and research of the subject are reported in Knight and Stephen (2002) , Poon and Granger (2003) , Hans Franses and McAleer (2002) and Poon (2005) . In brief, there are three general notions (measures) of financial volatility in the literature, namely historical volatility, implied volatility and model-based volatility. Historical volatility (HV) is backward-looking and is generally computed from a time-series of the continuously compounded returns of the underlying security or asset. In this measure, the compounded investment return r c (t) of the underlying security is computed daily and it is defined as r c (t) = log (c(t)/c(t \u00c0 1)), where c(t) denotes the current closing valuation of the financial security and c(t \u00c0 1) refers to the price level of the previous trading day. This corresponds to the day-on-day change in the financial valuation of the underlying security. Subsequently, the volatility HV(t) for a trading day t is defined as the statistical deviation or weighted deviation of the returns time-series {r c (t \u00c0 n + 1) jn = 1,. . . ,N}, where N denotes the length of the historical price path considered in the computation of the volatility measure.",

That is, as implied volatility is based on the current market prices of the options, it contains all the forward expectations of the investors about the likely future price path of the underlying security. The implied volatility of an option contract is defined as the financial volatility that produces the traded (market) price of the option based on a selected option pricing model. In practice, the black-scholes model (Black & Scholes, 1973) and its variants (Gencay & Gibson, 2007; Grace, 2000) are often used to price the options traded in the derivatives markets. Empirically, it has been observed that the computed IVs of the options issued on the same underlier and with the same time to maturity often exhibit a nonlinear relationship known as the volatility smile (Derman & Kani, 1994; Dupire, 1994) with respect to the different strike prices of the options. This is generally regarded as evidence that an underlier's implied financial volatility is not constant, but instead, depends on factors such as the price level of the underlying security and the exercise prices of the options. For these reasons, at-the-money (ATM) or nearly ATM options are often used as the reference entities to compute the implied volatilities in financial volatility modeling and prediction studies (Poon & Granger, 2003) .",

Such information is then used to detect future trading opportunities, constituting the human approach to financial trend modeling and judgemental forecasting (Lawrence & O'Connor, 1992) . However, current technical volatility modeling and forecasting methods (a comprehensive review can be found in Section 3 of Poon & Granger (2003) ) are often based on statistical or continuous time finance theories that are generally mathematically convoluted, which erodes their intuitiveness to a human investor. The proposed use of eFSM as a semantic neural-fuzzy based approach to the modeling and projection of financial volatility trends, on the other hand, bridges the knowledge chasm as it enables a human investor to examine the inherent trend information extracted from the historical observations via highly interpretable IF-THEN fuzzy rules. Moreover, since high frequency financial data is inherently noisy, eFSM can mitigate the effects of the noise artifacts on the computed volatility predictions as it employs Gaussian-shaped fuzzy sets to model (generalize) the characteristics of the past volatility fluctuations. This helps to preserve the salient patterns and predictable trends of the financial volatility time-series. Furthermore, the self-organising eFSM can spot financial trends in huge amounts of data that may not be immediately apparent to a human trader.",

This enables eFSM to construct a more robust and adaptive forecasting model in contrast to many existing neuralfuzzy modeling techniques. Furthermore, eFSM employs the compositional-rule-of-inference (CRI) schema (Zadeh, 1994) , a logical fuzzy reasoning scheme that mimics the human reasoning process, to define its computations. From a human trader's perspective, this provides added credence to the computed volatility projections. Lastly, as the MACD trading rule employs historical time-indexed data to obtain the trending signals, the resultant trading decisions computed from these signals are inevitably time-delayed. Therefore, the use of eFSM as a model to forecast the future HSI volatility levels and the subsequent use of such forward projections in the computation of the MACD trading decisions help to address the lagging nature of the MACD trading rule. This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 briefly presents the eFSM neural-fuzzy semantic memory model and its learning mechanisms. Section 3 then introduces the technical concepts behind the trading of option straddles and the use of the MACD principle for financial volatility trading. Following that, Section 4 describes the HSI data set used by eFSM to model and forecast the volatility levels of the Hong Kong stock market. Subsequently, the trading results based on the use of these forecasts for the capitalization of the Hong Kong financial market uncertainties with a MACD-driven straddle trading system are presented and analyzed.

In eFSM, K, J i and L m varied according to the changes in the underlying data generating process to be modeled. In this paper, the underlying process refers to the Hong Kong financial market uncertainties that give rise to the volatilities of the Hang Seng Index. The computing structure of the eFSM model evolves dynamically with the arrival of each training data presented. The learning mechanisms of eFSM are designed to functionally emulate the information processing capabilities of the human hippocampus (see Section 2.1). Prior to the start of the learning process, there are no computing nodes in layers 2, 3 and 4 of eFSM (i.e. no fuzzy rules). New fuzzy rules are dynamically added and old rules that no longer describe the current data characteristics observed are removed during the learning phase. Together, the set of resultant fuzzy rules describes the salient associative mappings between the inputs and outputs of the underlying process being modeled. The form of knowledge representation described in Eq. (3) is also known as linguistic fuzzy modeling (LFM) (Casillas, Cordn, Herrera, & Magdalena, 2003) , and best approximates the semantic knowledge (e.g., long-established knowledge about objects, facts, and word meanings etc.) representation embodied in the human mind (Toth, 1997) . With respect to the task of financial volatility modeling and forecasting, this knowledge representation scheme enhances the interpretability of the eFSM computing structure (by defining the neural connectionisms of eFSM as human comprehensible IF-THEN fuzzy rules) and helps a human trader to develop a better understanding of the underlying characteristics of the observed volatility of the Hang Seng Index movements. This directly enables the human investor to analyze and study the volatility trends in the Hong Kong stock market and to make better and informed trading decisions to maximize his investment profits.",

            "text": "Over the last decade, neural-fuzzy systems have been successfully deployed to solve many modeling problems (Chong, Quek, & Loh, 2009; Juang & Lin, 2001; Quek, Tan, & Sagar, 2001; Quek, Wandy, & Ng, 2010; Talei, Chua, & Quek, 2010; Tan, Quek, Ng, & Ravzi, 2008; Tong, Wang, & Tang, 2000; Tung, Quek, & Cheng, 2004; Wai & Lin, 1998) . However, the complex and dynamic nature of real-world applications demanded that neural-fuzzy systems be able to adapt their structures, parameters and ultimately evolve their intelligence to continuously address the non-stationary characteristics of the underlying data generating processes. The usefulness of existing neural-fuzzy systems such as ANFIS , POPFNN (Ang & Quek, 2005; Quek & Zhou, 1996) , HyFIS (Kim & Kasabov, 1999) , EFuNN (Kasabov, 2001) , SOFNNGA (Leng, McGinnity, & Prasad, 2006) , RPOP-TVR (Wong, Cho, & Quek, 2009) , FASCOM (Goh, Lim, & Quek, 2009 ) and FITSK (Quah & Quek, 2006) are, however, generally constrained to static environments as their training/rule generation procedures unrealistically assumed that the characteristics of the underlying data generating processes being modeled do not change with time. Hence, these systems often employed batched 4 or pseudo-incremental 5 learning approaches to construct (i.e. identify and tune) their respective fuzzy rule (knowledge) bases and are ill-equipped for the modeling of more complex time-varying processes. These neural-fuzzy systems lacked the capability to acquire any new information that emerges after the training of the embedded fuzzy model has been completed. Attempts to adapt to the changing underlying process generally require re-training to rebuild the entire neural-fuzzy system since incremental learning of the new patterns (information) will modify the trained fuzzy model in such a way that the originally learned but possibly still valid knowledge is forgotten or replaced. That is, the newly emerging information ''catastrophically\" erased the fuzzy model's memory of the previously learned knowledge (French, 2003) , and the resultant phenomenon of degraded computing performances is known as the stability-plasticity dilemma (Grossberg, 1982) .",

This phenomenon is referred to as sequential learning in machine learning research (McCloskey & Cohen, 1989) . Hence, the learning mechanisms of eFSM are modeled after certain information processing capabilities of the human brain (specifically the hippocampus) to enable it to robustly organize the knowledge extracted from the data observations presented. Particularly, the human hippocampal formation is capable of a neurogenesis process (Kempermann, Wiskott, & Gage, 2004 ) that has been regarded as the primary mechanism used to 4 In batch learning, it is assumed that all the training data has been collected and is available to the training process. Training generally involves cycling through the collected data a number of epochs to separately identify and tune a fuzzy model that provides a fitting description to the characteristics of the observed training data. 5 Pseudo-incremental learning refers to the arrival of the training data one at a time. The training process generally responds by applying the rule generation procedure to the current training data prior to the arrival of the next data sample. However, a copy of the observed data is usually kept for the parameter adaptation phase to optimize the parameters of the fuzzy model or to perform rule pruning to identify a compact rule-base.",

These information processing capabilities are generally ascribed to two complementary functions of the human hippocampus; namely, as a recall comparator (Vinogradova, 2001) and as a novelty/familiarity detector (Clark & Gronlund, 1996) . Therefore, to computationally mimic facets of how the human hippocampus performs the sequential learning of information, the rule-generating procedure of the eFSM model is designed based on its recall comparator as well as the novelty/familiarity detection principles.

LTP is the strengthening of the synaptic connection between two repeatedly intensely excited neurons and is responsible for the learning/reinforcement of memory traces in the hippocampal formation. LTD, on the other hand, is the weakening of the synaptic connection between two neurons due to persistent weak excitations. Thus, it is regarded as the main mechanism of 'forgetting'. Hence, the human hippocampus possesses highly evolved and elegant mechanisms to maintain up-to-date memory traces. Computationally, the eFSM model mimics these neural mechanisms via the use of fuzzy rule potentials with the LTP and LTD concepts (see Section 2.3) to construct a set of evolving IF-THEN Mamdani fuzzy rules to model non-stationary data generating processes.",

The inferred consequent outputs in eFSM are essentially computed based on a fusion of the Mamdani as well as the Takagi-Sugeno (TS) (Takagi & Sugeno, 1985) fuzzy models (Tung & Quek, 2009 ). This ensures that when compared with existing Mamdanibased neural-fuzzy systems, the eFSM model is able to deliver a better performance in time-series modeling and prediction tasks. Subsequently, the computed output y m (X) of OV m is the weighted sum of the set of inferred consequent outputs from all the output fuzzy sets of OV m . Following that, the output of eFSM to the input X is defined as Y = [y 1 (X), . . . , y m (X), . . ., y M (X)] T . Although the eFSM model employs a set of learning mechanisms that is inspired by the human hippocampus, its computing structure remains similar to that of the well-established generic self-organising fuzzy neural network (GenSoFNN) (Tung & Quek, 2002) . Hence, the procedure of mapping the CRI schema onto eFSM to define its computational process described in Eqs. (4)-(8) shall not be repeated here. The interested reader may refer to Tung et al. (2004) on how such mapping is performed. Similar to GenS-oFNN, eFSM may also take on other forms of fuzzy reasoning schema such as truth-value restriction (Mantaras, 1990) , approximate analogical reasoning (Turksen & Zhong, 1990) and yager reasoning (Yager, Keller, & Tahani, 1992) .

However, obsolete fuzzy rules that no longer describe the observed data characteristics due to changes in the underlying data generating process have to be pruned from eFSM in order to maintain a compact and current rule (knowledge) base. This is achieved via the use of fuzzy rule potentials and the LTP and LTD concepts introduced in Section 2.1. The potential P k of a fuzzy rule R k in eFSM defines its importance/influence in the entire rule (knowledge) base of the system. Hence, a fuzzy rule with a high potential is significant in describing or generalizing the characteristics of a large chunk of recently encountered training patterns. Each rule in eFSM has a fuzzy rule potential that is continuously computed based on the LTP and LTD principles.

Options provide a means to manage financial risks and are playing an increasingly important role in modern financial markets (Chance, 2004) . From a financial perspective, having the right to buy or sell an asset without the obligation to complete the transaction has economic value. Therefore, options are traded as an asset in the financial markets. Options belong to a class of financial products generally referred to as derivative securities whose returns are derived from those of other financial instruments, in this case, the underlying physical or financial assets for which the options are issued (Boyle & Boyle, 2001) . Options are traded openly on derivative markets such as the Chicago Board Options Exchange and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange or overthe-counter privately between two parties. In the option markets, the price of a traded option depends on several factors. These include the price of the underlier (which determines the intrinsic value of the option), time to maturity of the option contract (which influences its time value), market volatility of the underlying asset, the current risk-free interest rate, the strike (exercise) price of the option and the type of option contract (i.e. American or European contract).

In addition, the intrinsic value and the profit/loss (P/L) functions are shown together with the respective option prices to indicate the lower-bound valuations and the returns of investment of the two options with respect to the changing underlying asset price S 0 . For an at-the-money (ATM) Call option, a denotes the market (purchase) price of the option. Hence, a trader stands to lose at most a capital equivalent to a should the option expires at-the-money or out-of-the-money (OTM); i.e. S T 6 X, where S T is the price of the underlier at the time the option expires. However, if the price of the underlier increases above the exercise (strike) price of the Call option, the option will become in-the-money (ITM). If the Call option expires as in-the-money, its value is derived from the difference of the underlier price and the strike price; i.e. C T = S T \u00c0 X, where C T is the value of the Call option at expiration. Hence, the overall profit/loss (P/L) to a trader for investing in the Call option is computed as P/L = max (0, S T \u00c0 X) \u00c0 a. This is reflected as the P/L function in Fig. 2(a) . The price dynamics, intrinsic value and profit/loss functions for a Put option are analyzed in a similar way. From Fig. 2(b) , the label b denotes the capital invested in buying a Put option that is at-the-money. For a Put option, as the price of the underlier decreases, the value of the option increases and vice versa. When the price of the underlying asset is zero, the maximum theoretical price of a Put option is X (i.e. no investor will pay more to receive a lesser payout). The profit/loss to an investor for investing in a Put option is determined by P/L = max (0, X \u00c0 S T ) \u00c0 b. Hence, a trader loses at most the capital of b if the ATM Put option that he has bought expires with no value (i.e. max (0,X \u00c0 S T ) = 0jX 6 S T ). On the other hand, he will breakeven on his investment if the Put option expires with a value of b (i.e. {b = X \u00c0 S T jS T < X}).

Fig. 3 depicts the expected profit/loss to a trader who invests in an ATM straddle with respect to the changing underlying asset price. 7 The cost of the Call, Put and resultant straddle are denoted as a, b and c, respectively. Straddles are a good strategy to pursue if an investor believes that an underlier's price will move significantly (i.e. high price volatility), but is unsure as to in which direction the price will move. As shown in Fig. 3 , the underlying asset price must move significantly if the investor is to make a profit from buying (longing) the ATM straddle. If there is only a small movement in the underlier's price occurring in either direction (i.e. low price volatility), the investor will experience a loss as the value of the straddle is less than the capital outlay of c to purchase it. The investment on the straddle is said to break-even when the value of the straddle equals to its acquisition price c = a + b. On the other hand, the reverse is true for selling (shorting) the ATM straddle. That is, a trader will suffer a loss if he sells a straddle and the underlier's price subsequently experienced high volatility or encountered a large price movement in either direction. A profit is possible only if the price of the underlying asset does not deviate too far from the strike price of the straddle sold (i.e. low price volatility). Hence, an intelligent straddle trading system is proposed in this paper to capitalize on the financial volatility of the Hong Kong stock market. Such a trading system will long (short) a straddle defined on the 7 It is assumed here that a Put option costs more than a Call option. This could be due to a bearish market where the price of the underlying asset is expected to fall. The reverse may be true for a bullish market where the underlier's price is expected to rise. Nevertheless, the technicalities of straddle trading outlined here apply for both scenarios.",

The primary mechanism of MACD is to use moving averages (which are lagging indicators) to track the movements in a financial data time-series such as a stock market index or the price of a financial asset. The use of moving averages attenuates or smoothes the spurious oscillations (rapid reversals of trends) and helps to identify the general movements of a time-series. Commonly, MACD is defined as the difference (see Eq. (15)) between the 12-days exponential moving average (i.e. EMA 12 ) and the 26-days exponential moving average (EMA 26 ) of a time-series, although other time periods may also be used. That is,",

As one can observe from the figure, both the fast and slow EMA are lagging indicators as the EMA signals captured the trend reversals much later after the direction of the stock price of Merrill Lynch Co. has changed. From Eq. (15), MACD tracks the difference between the fast and slow EMA. MACD is positive when EMA 12 is above EMA 26 and vice versa. The MACD for the stock price of Merrill Lynch Co. is represented as a thick solid line in the lower half of Fig. 4 . A crossover between the two EMA signals occurs when one rises over (falls under) the other. This is reflected by the three instances when the MACD signal cuts the zero reference line. MACD is often referred to as a momentum oscillator as the MACD signal oscillates above and below the zero reference line, and an increasing difference between the two EMA signals reflects a faster rate-of-change of one signal over the other. Hence, if the fast signal (EMA 12 ) is rising quicker than the slow signal (EMA 26 ), a positive (bullish) momentum is captured by computing the MACD. Conversely, if the fast signal is falling more swiftly than the slow signal, a negative (bearish) momentum is observed.",

This generates false or insignificant trading signals and incurs unnecessary trading costs. Hence, the 9-days EMA of the MACD signal is often used as the trigger line for the MACD trading rule as it attenuates the oscillations and smoothes the MACD signal. The EMA 9 of the MACD signal (i.e. MACD_EMA 9 ) is shown as the thin solid line in the bottom half of Fig. 4 . The MACD histogram is depicted as the bar plot and illustrates the differences between the MACD signal and its EMA 9 trigger line. This formulation of the MACD trading rule is often referred to as MACD (12, 26, 9) , where the respective historical time frames for the fast and slow EMA signals as well as the trigger for the MACD signal are clearly specified. With MACD (12, 26, 9) , a buy (sell) signal is generated whenever the MACD signal crosses above (falls below) its EMA 9 trigger line. As observed from Fig. 4 , the trading signals generated by MACD (12, 26, 9) are much closer to the lows and highs of the stock price plot. Empirical studies have further validated and confirmed the shorter delays of the trading signals generated by such a process (Elder, 1993; Murphy, 1996) .",

The prediction objective is therefore to minimize the error (difference) between\u0177\u00f0t \u00fe 1\u00de and the subsequently observed actual time-series value y(t + 1). In financial time-series prediction or financial forecasting, the autoregressive problem f as shown in Eq. (17) has been optimized via various techniques (e.g. statistical regression, stochastic regression, neural networks, fuzzy systems, support vector machines and evolutionary computations) for stock price modeling and prediction (Ang & Quek, 2006; Saad, Prokhorov, & Wunsch, 1998) , forecasting of financial variables (Noh et al., 1994; Refenes, Burgess, & Bentz, 1997) , equity returns (Apte & Hong, 1994; Kuan & Liu, 1995) and stock market indices (Chen, Leung, & Daouk, 2003; Yang & Yang, 2003) , as well as the optimization of portfolio composition and trading strategy (Moody & Saffell, 2001) . In this paper, the eFSM model that employs a set of human hippocampal-inspired learning mechanisms is used as a forecasting system to predict the future volatility measure of the Hang Seng Index. The volatility forecasts, when used in the computations of the fast and slow moving averages of the corresponding HSI volatility time-series, will enable the MACD trading rule to generate forward-looking trading signals. That is, the MACD trading rule will make a recommendation to buy (short-sell) an ATM straddle in order to profit from its increased (decreased) valuation whenever high (low) volatility in the Hong Kong stock market is expected. This approach directly addresses the problem of delayed trading signals inherent in the original formulation of the MACD trading rule. The predicted future volatility level\u0177\u00f0t \u00fe 1\u00de of the HSI is subsequently forwarded to the trade decision module (TDM) of the proposed straddle trading system (Fig. 5) to compute the trading decision TD(t) that is defined as Eq. (18) Hence, on any trading day t, the proposed trading system can issue a sell, buy or no trading recommendation to a human trader. For simplicity, in this paper, the trading system is allowed to have at most one open trading position. That is, the trading system may have short-sold an ATM straddle when the HSI volatility is expected to be low or bought an ATM straddle if the HSI volatility is expected to increase. Otherwise, the trading system would be in a neutral position with no exposure to the fluctuations of the Hong Kong stock market. The status (focus) of the proposed trading system on trading day t is denoted by F(t) such that On the last trading day (i.e. end of the simulation/trading period), the trading system will close any existing open position where F(t \u00c0 1) 2 {\u00c01, 1} to return to a neutral position (i.e. F(t) = 0) and computes the profit/loss (return r s (t)) on the last straddle trade as well as the overall profit/loss R for the entire trading (simulation) period. To account for the profit/loss r s (t) of trading an option straddle s, the trading system needs to monitor the initial and final economic values of the straddle that was traded. Let V s,0 denotes the initial value of the ATM straddle s when the trading system first bought or sold it, and V s,1 denotes the final value of the straddle s when the trading system closes its position on it (i.e. reversing its open position). The profit/loss r s (t) of trading a straddle s is computed only when the trading system returns to a neutral trading position from a short-sold or longed position as shown in Fig. 7 . Computationally, the profit/loss or return r s (t) for a straddle trade s performed by the proposed trading system is defined by ",

Hence, the objective of the proposed straddle trading system is to capitalize on the volatility of the HSI to maximize the total trading return R. In this paper, d is defined as 1% of the total economic value of the options transacted and Eq. (20) accounts for two different ways of computing the transaction cost of performing a straddle trade, i.e. (1) when the trading system closes its open position on the straddle, and (2) when the straddle expires and the trading system subsequently returns to a neutral trading position. The transaction cost for the former scenario is d(V s,0 + V s,1 ) since the ATM straddle s is transacted twice at value V s,0 and V s,1 , respectively, while the transaction cost for the latter scenario is d(V s,0 ) since settlement is automatically performed when the straddle expired. With respect to Fig. 6 , the trade decision module (TDM) of the proposed straddle trading system has to derive one of three different sets of trade decisions, namely TD Short (t), TD Neutral (t) and TD Long (t), depending on the trading scenario encountered. That is, TDM is to recommend the appropriate trading action TD Short (t) when the trading system (i.e. trader) is in a short-sold position, the trading action TD Neutral (t) when the trading system is in a neutral position, and the trading action TD Long (t) when the trading system is in a longed position, respectively. Each of these three sets of trade decisions contains two or three types of trading actions, i.e. sell ATM straddle, no trading and buy ATM straddle as described in Eq. (18).

The condition to trigger the exit strategy can be: (C1) the value of the longed (shorted) straddle s has been below (above) the initial traded straddle value V s,0 for 5 consecutive trading days, or (C2) the current value V s (t) of the traded straddle (as compared to V s,0 ) has declined sharply, or (C3) the value V s (t) of the traded straddle has increased significantly.

The information in the dataset includes the expiry dates, strike prices, daily settlements and the daily black-scholes implied volatilities of all the live European-styled options issued on the HSI, as well as the recorded closing levels of the Hong Kong bourse (i.e. the HSI) during the observation period. All the information is obtained via the Hong Kong Exchange Corporation (Hong Kong Exchange). From the daily closing levels of the HSI and the information recorded in the options dataset, the three volatility measures of the Hong Kong stock market, namely the historical volatility (HV), implied volatility (IV) and model-based volatility (MV) as described in Section 1, are computed. These respective volatility measures subsequently formed three different time-ordered data series. The HV timeseries is obtained via Eq.

Lastly, the model-based volatility (MV) of the HSI is estimated from the log-return series {r c (t)} of the Hang Seng Index (HSI) using the composite conditional mean and conditional variance financial time-series model based on the autoregressive (AR) and the GARCH (Bollerslev, 1986) processes (see Eqs. (1) and (2)). The HV, IV and MV based timeseries of the HSI fluctuations are depicted in Fig. 8 . As one can observe from the plots of the three volatility measures, the Hong Kong stock market has experienced greater fluctuations and higher volatilities in the first half (i.e. Jan 2002 to mid 2004) as compared to the later half of the 5-year observation period. This could be due to the post September-11 effects (where there were a lot of uncertainties and fears about the strength of the US economy after the terrorist attacks and the related fallout on the health of the global economy), as well as the SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) outbreak in Asia in early 2003 that greatly eroded investors' confidence in the Asian stock markets. Nevertheless, it is important to note that the volatility time-series derived from the three different measures generally displayed similar macro volatility trends across the 5-year period, although there are significant differences in the amplitude of the fluctuations as well as conflicting pockets of volatility trends.",

The MV time-series, which is derived using the conditional mean and conditional variance financial time-series model based on the AR and GARCH processes, will be directly used to study the trading performances of the proposed straddle trading system. The computed trading profit/loss based on the use of the MV time-series subsequently serves as a benchmark to the trading results obtained with counterpart straddle trading systems employing the eFSM-based HV and IV projection modules. No forecasting system is constructed for the MV time-series. This is because empirically, it is not necessary to model the composite AR and GARCH processes which in turn trace the dynamics of the HSI returns time-series to derive the model-based volatility (MV) estimates.",

The training set consists of documented volatility data observed for the initial two years (i.e. Jan 2002 to Dec 2003) while the test set contains data recorded for the remaining three years (i.e. Jan 2004 to Dec 2006) of the observation period. The eFSM volatility modeling and prediction system is trained using information in the training set and its forecasting accuracies duly assessed using the withheld test set. Four measures are adopted to track the modeling and forecasting capabilities of the eFSM-based VPM. They are, namely: (1) the pearson correlation index (denoted as PC) (Rodgers & Nicewander, 1988) ; (2) the mean squared error (MSE) (Lehmann & Casella, 1998) ; (3) the average relative variance (ARV); and (4) the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) measures. The pearson correlation index PC, with a range of [\u00c01, +1], is a measure of the linearity of the predicted and actual volatility trends. That is, a correlation of +1 indicates a perfect positive correlation, which means that both the predicted and actual HSI volatilities move in the same direction together. The MSE, ARV and MAPE measures, on the other hand, tracks the forecast accuracies of the predicted to the actual observed HSI volatility levels. The MSE, ARV and MAPE measures are mathematically defined in Eqs. (33)-(35), respectively.",

For both the recall and generalization assessments, the eFSM model has been trained using the training set defined earlier. In recall, the trained eFSM model is assessed using inputs from the training set (i.e. to determine how well it has learnt the volatility trend information in the training data) while for generalization, the eFSM model is evaluated with the unseen inputs from the test set. The tracking measures and the performance indices for the recall and generalization tasks are presented with the result plots. From Fig. 10 , one can observe that the eFSM model is able to capture the historical volatility trends in the training set relatively well (refer to Recall results for the period [2002] [2003] . This is reflected by a high pearson correlation (PC) value of 0.964 as well as a low mean squared error MSE of 0.699. This small modeling error is also tracked by MAPE, which indicated that on average, the error expected of the predicted historical volatility level for each trading day in the training set is approximately 3.4% of its true (subsequently observed) value. The ARV measure also showed that eFSM performed superbly when compared to the baseline mean output predictor. The forecasting capability of the eFSM model is subsequently evaluated using the withheld test set. As observed, the accuracy of the predicted volatility levels for trading days of 2004-2006 that constitutes the test set degrades when compared to the recall performance of eFSM on the training set. This is indi-cated by the larger MSE, ARV and MAPE values. Specifically, the mean expected forecast error for the historical volatility level of each trading day in the test period has increased to approximately 5%. On examination, the lower forecast performance of eFSM on the test set is due to significant prediction errors at two prominent durations in the test period. These durations are denoted as subperiod 'a' and 'b' respectively in Fig. 10 . Subperiod 'a' is characterized by a series of intense fluctuations in the HV data-series, and this could have contributed to the large prediction errors by the eFSM-based volatility projection module. On the other hand, the poor performance by eFSM at subperiod 'b' could be due to the lack of similar trends in the training set. It is observed that at subperiod 'b', there is a significant increase in the volatility of the Hong Kong financial market as shown by the sharp rapid rise from trough to peak of the volatility curve. However, similar volatility trends in the training set have a smaller magnitude of increase and this is followed by a rapid fall. Hence, this could have caused eFSM to forecast a plunge in the volatility level, leading to significant prediction errors in the result plot.",

            "text": "The task of modeling and forecasting the historical volatility measures of the HSI is subsequently repeated using other modeling techniques. They are, namely: (1) a 3-layered back-propagation trained feed-forward neural network with 20 hidden nodes (FFNN-BP); (2) a radial basis function (RBF) network (Moody & Darken, 1989 ) with 40 hidden nodes; (3) the cerebellar model articulation controller (CMAC) (Albus, 1975) neural network; (4) HyFIS (Kim & Kasabov, 1999) ; and (5) the ANFIS network. These computational methods replaced the eFSM model as the function approximator in the VPM illustrated in Fig. 9 . The benchmarking techniques are selected based on their established performances in time-series modeling and prediction. determined to obtain credible results for comparison with those achieved with the eFSM model. For FFNN-BP, linear activation functions are used for the single output as well as the 20 hidden nodes, while the HyFIS network employs a configuration of 4 fuzzy partitions per input dimension that subsequently results in 154 trained fuzzy rules. The ANFIS network, on the other hand, is implemented as part of the MatLAB fuzzy logic toolbox (MatLAB Fuzzy Logic Toolbox) and employs subtractive clustering for its structure identification process that generates a total of 11 Takagi-Sugeno (TS) functional fuzzy rules. Lastly, the RBF network employs 40 hidden nodes with Gaussian basis functions as local models to learn the volatility trends in the training set and the CMAC structure is defined with 5 memory cells per input dimension. For CMAC, a total of 93036 memory cells are populated after the training process. In addition, the volatility modeling and prediction tasks are repeated ten times with the FFNN-BP model and the average result reported in Table 1 in order to address the issue of differing results due to the random initialization of the network's weight matrix. Table 1 clearly showed that with the exception of the FFNN-BP model, the rest of the benchmarking systems are able to achieve a good modeling (recall) performance on the training set of the HV time-series. Specifically, the ANFIS and CMAC networks are able to produce more superior results than the eFSM model. This is likely due to the use of linear functions to model the desired output volatility levels as in the case of ANFIS and the use of local models and precise scalar outputs to learn the complex volatility trends in CMAC. The FFNN-BP model, on the other hand, performed poorly in the recall task due to significant modeling errors as indicated by the various accuracy measures. The conflicting and complex volatility trends were not adequately captured by FFNN-BP, which uses a set of globally tuned weights to model the characteristics of the training set. Meanwhile, the HyFIS and RBF networks obtained just marginally poorer recall performances on the training set of the HV time-series as compared to the eFSM model. However, with respect to the generalization task, Table 1 revealed that there are significant degradations in the prediction accuracies of the benchmarking techniques. Noticeably, ANFIS and CMAC produced the poorest results amongst all the evaluated modeling techniques. For ANFIS, this is due to the functional (linear) computation of the predicted volatility levels based on the presented inputs using the Takagi-Sugeno (TS) fuzzy model, which tends to 'over-extrapolate' its forecasts around subperiod 'a' (see Fig. 10 ) that is characterized by a series of small but intense volatility fluctuations in the Hong Kong stock market. The CMAC network, on the other hand, had poor generalization performance for the unseen volatility trends in the test set as it employed discrete (and uniformly spaced) partitions to define its memory surface. This caused many untrained (or under-trained) memory cells to be accessed and resulted in poor volatility forecasts. Meanwhile, the FFNN-BP model, as expected, returned another set of disappointing results for the generalization task as it had earlier failed to properly model the volatility trends of the training set. The remaining two benchmarking systems, namely HyFIS and RBF, performed better than the three techniques discussed above. A plausible reason is the use of Gaussian-shaped fuzzy sets in Hy-FIS to model both the input and output clusters of the volatility data space, and the use of Gaussian radial basis functions in the RBF network to define the local models employed to model the volatility fluctuations. This equips the two modeling techniques with better generalization capabilities for the unseen volatility trends in the test set. However, the results in Table 1 have clearly shown that the forecasting (generalization) performance of the eFSM model compared favorably to all the benchmarking techniques. Specifically, eFSM achieved the highest performance index (PI) of 0.438 amongst all the evaluated modeling techniques and also had the smallest prediction errors as indicated by the various accuracy measures. This superior performance is possibly due to the use of Gaussian-shaped fuzzy sets to model the volatility trends in the training set as well as the learning and computational processes of the eFSM model.",

Such fuzzy rules enable a human trader to understand the volatility fluctuations of the Hang Seng Index and help him to make informed trading decisions. Fig. 11 depicts the set of input-output fuzzy sets extracted from the trained structure of the eFSM model. Appropriate linguistic labels with the associated semantic meanings have been attached to these fuzzy sets to describe the resultant set of 94 trained fuzzy rules. This compares favorably against the FFNN-BP, RBF and CMAC techniques, which do not allow any meaningful interpretation of the acquired knowledge via their trained structures. On the other hand, although the HyFIS and ANFIS networks are neural-fuzzy systems like the eFSM model, there are deficiencies inherent to these two techniques that hinder the efforts of a human trader to decipher their acquired knowledge. Specifically, the training process of Hy-FIS causes excessive and unconstrained overlapping of its computed fuzzy sets, which makes assigning proper semantic meanings to these fuzzy sets difficult. The ANFIS network, on the other hand, employs the TS fuzzy model that computes with functional consequents. This subsequently reduces the transparency and interpretability of its fuzzy rule-base.",

From  Fig. 12 , one can observe that the eFSM model has achieved considerably consistent results across the recall and generalization tasks. That is, there is only a slight degradation in performance as indicated by the respective performance indices PI. Specifically, the expected error for each volatility projection increased from approximately 2.6% for the recall assessment using the training set to about 3.8% for the generalization evaluation using the test set. This increase in forecasting error on the test set is plausibly due to noticeable wayward projections occurring at subperiods 'c' and 'd' denoted in Fig. 12 . In addition, when compared to the HV modeling and forecasting results depicted in Fig. 10 , one can easily conclude that the eFSM model has achieved a better overall performance in volatility projections using the IV time-series data.

In fact, they are the top three performers amongst all the evaluated techniques. This could be due to the fact that HyFIS and ANFIS (for the input space only) employed Gaussian fuzzy sets to model the characteristics of the IV fluctuations, while the RBF network uses Gaussian radial basis functions to define the local models employed to learn the volatility trends in the IV training set. recall assessment as they may have failed to adequately capture the inherent characteristics of the training set. However, when called upon to generate volatility forecasts using data from the test set, the results in Table 2 showed that there are marked degradations in the performances of the benchmarking techniques. Particularly, there are major declines in the performance indices (see PI readings in Table 2 ) reported by the HyFIS, RBF and CMAC networks, and also a significant increase in the forecast errors for the volatility projections computed by these techniques as indicated by the MSE, ARV and MAPE measures. Such degraded performances can be explained by the significantly different volatility levels encountered in the test period as compared to the volatility levels in the training set of the IV time-series. Specifically, the implied volatility of the HSI fluctuated between 16% to 36% between 2002 to 2003, while the years 2004 to 2006 see the same volatility measure within the range of 11% to 26%. Hence, to the HyFIS, RBF and CMAC networks, there are significantly lower volatility levels in the test set that they have not encountered during the training phase. This causes large forecasting errors in the volatility projections computed by the three networks. On the other hand, FFNN-BP, ANFIS and eFSM performed considerably better than the previous three benchmarking techniques on the IV test set. This is due to the use of a linear activation function for the output node in FFNN-BP, the linear consequent function in the TS fuzzy model of the ANFIS network, and the computation of the output of the eFSM model via a fusion of the Mamdani and TS fuzzy models. More importantly, Table 2 has shown that eFSM has a better forecasting capability than the FFNN-BP and ANFIS networks, as it is able to sufficiently capture the volatility fluctuations in the training set using the brain-inspired LTP and LTD learning mechanisms and to sensibly extend the acquired knowledge to derive projections for the unseen test set.",

From Table 3 , one can observe that regardless of the volatility measure used, the trading gains achieved by the proposed straddle trading system employing the PP-based VPM are significantly positive after accounting for the 1% transaction cost. This is reflected by the large positive gains for the expected profit/lossr s \u00f0t\u00de for each straddle trade and the overall return e R under the PP-VPM column. The results clearly demonstrated that the capability to predict (project) the daily HSI volatility levels from past historic observations can help a human trader to enhance his investment profits when trading the HSI straddles. In addition, the positive gains recorded by the various trading systems employing either the eFSM or PP-based volatility projection module (VPM) indicated that the trading strategy adopted by the trade decision module (TDM) of the proposed straddle trading framework is technically viable in capitalizing the uncertainties of the Hong Kong stock market for financial volatility trading. That is, the proposed straddle trading system can help a human trader to generate investment profit gains via straddle trading during rising, falling or side-way market conditions. Hence, considerable profits can be realized by the implemented trading framework. Individually, each of the three volatility measures produced different degree of trading return. Table 3 showed that the highest profit gains are consistently achieved by trading systems employing the implied volatility (IV) measure. Trading systems adopting the HV measure as a proxy to the implicit HSI volatility, meanwhile, have the lowest trading returns amongst all the evaluated systems. A plausible reason is that implied volatility (IV) is a forward projection of the price path of the underlying asset, which in this case, is the fluctuation of the Hang Seng Index. The statistically based HV measure, on the other hand, is backward-looking and could be less sensitive to information contributing to the existing market sentiments. Hence, the IV measure, which is derived from current option price data, may be a more accurate indicator of the anticipated movements of the HSI than the HV measure and subsequently results in much higher trading returns. Lastly, the profit gains of trading systems employing the model-based volatility (MV) measure obtained via the composite AR and GARCH processes fall between those achieved by counterpart systems employing the HV and IV measures.",

According to information obtained from the HKMA, the average annual return for such Hong Kong dollar time deposit from January 2004 to December 2006 is 1.67%. This works out to an uncompounded daily return of approximately 0.0046% on a Hong Kong dollar.

Three different measures are employed to quantify the implicit volatility of the Hong Kong financial market.

However, the MACD trading rule inherently generates time-delayed trading signals due to the use of moving averages, which are lagging trend indicators. This drawback is intuitively addressed by employing a volatility projection module (VPM) that forecasts the future volatility levels of the HSI prior to the activation of TDM. The VPM is realized by a selforganising neural-fuzzy semantic network named the evolving fuzzy semantic memory (eFSM) model. eFSM approximates a nonlinear regression function that forecasts the future HSI volatility levels based on historically observed fluctuations. The computing structure of the eFSM model evolves dynamically with the arrival of each training data presented. The learning mechanisms of eFSM are designed to functionally emulate the information processing capabilities of the human hippocampus where prior to the start of the learning process, there are no fuzzy rules in the eFSM structure. New fuzzy rules are dynamically added and old rules that no longer describe the current data characteristics observed are removed based on the long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) mechanisms observed in the human brain during the learning phase. This allows the eFSM model to continuously address the non-stationary characteristics of the Hong Kong stock market. In addition, the computations of eFSM mimics the human way of reasoning and the trained structure of the eFSM model can be interpreted by a human trader as a set of linguistic fuzzy semantic rules. These desirable attributes provided added credence to the computed volatility projections. The volatility modeling and forecasting performances of eFSM are encouraging when subsequently benchmarked to several well-known computational intelligence based modeling techniques such as the ANFIS, HyFIS and CMAC neural networks.",
