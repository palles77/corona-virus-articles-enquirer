Superoxide production was determined using the coelenterazine assay and mtDNA damage was assessed using QPCR. Chronic ethanol feeding caused a significant decrease in State 3 respiration and RCRs. SAM supplementation prevented these ethanol-mediated defects as State 3 respiration was preserved in ethanol-fed animals coadministered SAM.

In contrast, levels of superoxide were largely unchanged in liver mitochondria from ethanol-fed animals co-administered SAM as compared to controls.

We believe that superoxide radicals are produced in excess in hyperglycemic cerebral ischemia. We have investigated the hypothesis that dehydroascorbic acid (DHA), a superoxide scavenger, reduces neurological damage. Using a three vessel occlusion model of cerebral ischemia in the rat under normo-and acute hyperglycemic conditions, we have evaluated manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) and copper/zinc (CuZnSOD) gene and protein expression 3 hours post-ischemia. Tissue samples for analysis by RT-PCR and Western blot were taken from the ischemic cortex, as well as corresponding sites from sham operated animals treated with DHA. Our results show that SODs protein expression is exacerbated in hyperglycemic cerebral ischemia compared to normoglycemic conditions and this increase is normalized by DHA. The latter also decreases edema formation (associated with hyperglycemia and superoxide production) and the zone at risk for infarction as determined by TTC staining. In conclusion, hyperglycemia during stroke is associated with an early induction of SODs and pretreatment with DHA delays infarction and normalizes SODs expression. 1 research centre on aging. IUGSherbrooke. Canada HDL plays an important role in reverse cholesterol transport (RCT). During ageing, several changes in the HDL may occur and then affect their function. Therefore, in this study, we investigate: 1-Whether ageing can affect the ability of HDL, (HDL2 & HDL3) to take up cellular free cholesterol (FC) execs and their susceptibility to oxidation. 2-the role of PON-1 in the RCT. HDL cholesterol efflux was carried out using human THP-1 macrophage incubated for 24h in the presence of: A-Native HDL, HDL-2 or HDL-3; B-Oxidised HDL; C-Oxidised HDL in the presence of PON-1. HDL oxidation was evaluated by measuring CD and MDA formation as well as vitamin E disappearance. SDS-PAGE was used in order to evaluate apoA1 desegregation following oxidation. Our results show that whole HDL and HDL-3 induced mobilisation of cellular FC which was significantly higher in younger than for older subjects (P= 0.0264 (HDL); P= 0.0123 (HDL-3); respectively). In the younger patients, FC effluxing capacity was more important for HDL3 than HDL2 (P=0.0186). Oxidation of HDL induces an increase in the CD, MDA production and the rate of vit-E disappearance. These HDL oxidation markers were higher in elderly than in young subjects. Significant negative correlation was observed between oxidised HDL and cholesterol efflux (CE) from THP-1 (P<0.001). However, at the same level of oxidation, mean (CE) was significantly higher with oxidised-HDL from young than from elderly subjects (P<0.05). The decrease of CE from macrophage with oxidised-HDL was abolished in the presence of increased concentrations of PON-1. Our data indicate that ageing affect negatively the ability of HDL to mobilise free cholesterol from cells and that PON-1 protecting HDL towards oxidation may restore or enhance RCT.",

In addition, the oxidized form of vitamin C, Dehydroascorbic acid (DHA) is transported into cells by the facilitative glucose transporters, GLUT1, GLUT3, and GLUT4. Once inside the cell, DHA is rapidly reduced to Ascorbic acid by both enzymatic and non-enzymatic means. Despite a wealth of data concerning vitamin C's transport mechanisms, it is still unclear whether its intracellular accumulation is mediated by SVCTs or GLUTs, or, depending on S F R B M 2 0 0 4 S33 available substrate, a mixture of the two. To solve this issue we have synthesized an analog to ascorbic acid, namely 6, Bromo ascorbic acid, which we hypothesize will be a substrate for SVCTs, but not GLUTs. To test this hypothesis we first compared the redox properties of the analog with ascorbic acid: analog was oxidizable and reducible, similar to ascorbic acid. Thereafter, the transport specificities of the oxidized and reduced forms of the analog were determined using Xenopus oocytes expressing SVCTs or GLUTs. 6,Bromo ascorbic acid was completely specific for SVCT1 and SVCT2, whereas 6,Bromo dehydroascorbic acid was not transported by the SVCT or GLUT transporter family. These data represent the first full characterization of an alternative substrate for the SVCTs, and indicate halo ascorbic acid analogs are ideal compounds to determine ascorbates transport pathways and function in vivo.

Twelve healthy and trained horses were randomly divided, group 1 received during 4 weeks an oral antioxidant cocktail and group 2 was placebo-treated. At the end of the treatment, horses performed a standardized exercise test (SET) under field conditions. Blood was sampled before starting the treatment (T0), immediately before (R) as well as 15 min (E15') and 24 hours (E24h) after the SET. Beside assessment of the EMF determined by electron spin resonance using the relaxation-contraction time (Tc), which is negatively proportional to EMF, the following markers were determined:glutathione peroxidase (GPx), superoxide dismutase (SOD), uric acid (UA), antioxidant capacity of water-soluble (ACW) and liposoluble (ACL) plasma components, lipid peroxides (Pool), oxidized proteins (oxProt), copper (Cu), zinc (Zn). The SET induced a significant (p<0.05) increase of Tc (3.72\u00b10.12 vs 5.05\u00b10.45 ns) (R vs E24h) and a significant increase of UA (2\u00b10.85 vs 6.9\u00b11.2 mg.L-1), ACW (52.5\u00b113 vs 98.2\u00b123 nmoleqAA.mL-1) (R vs E15') and oxProt (3.79\u00b10.4 vs 5.33\u00b10.5 10-2nmol.mgprot-1) (R versus E24h) in both groups.

Previously published findings show that antioxidants (melatonin was not tested) increase survival of anthrax infected rodents. We hypothesized that melatonin (N-acetyl-5-methoxytryptamine), an exceptionally safe, potent antioxidant, may increase survival by reducing exotoxin induced oxidant stress in macrophages. This hypothesis was tested in vitro using a murine macrophage cell line, RAW 264.7, which is known to respond to anthrax lethal toxin (LeTx). RAW 264.7 cells were treated with different concentrations (0.50 mM -0.02 nM) of melatonin combined with different doses of LeTx for different time points. Cell viability was measured by MTT assay. High LeTx levels caused a significant (60%) decrease in cell viability compared to non-treated controls after 4 hrs. Low LeTX (1mg LF and 0.1mg PA) resulted in a 40% decrease in cell viability. Melatonin, when added concurrently at all concentrations with high LeTx, did not protect macrophage cells. However, lower concentrations of melatonin (2nM -0.02nM), was effective in protecting cells against the effects of low LeTX. Our findings suggest that melatonin might be effective in preventing the toxicity from anthrax lethal toxin. We are currently investigating the mechanism of protective effects of melatonin against anthrax LeTX. Since melatonin is safe, cost effective, and orally bioavailable, it may prove to be a useful adjunctive treatment for a mass casualty event caused by anthrax.",

NADPH oxidases are one of the main sources of ROS in the vessel wall. To assess the role of ROS in Ang II-mediated hypertension and hypertrophy in vivo we used smooth muscle-specific nox1-overexpressing mice (Tg SMnox1 ). We tested the hypothesis that overexpression of VSMC nox1 exacerbates Ang II-induced superoxide production, vascular hypertrophy and hypertension, and that it can be reversed by antioxidant treatment with Tempol. Male Tg SMnox1 mice and their negative littermate controls were infused with Ang II (0.7 mg/kg per day) for 14 days. Superoxide formation in mouse aortas was quantified by HPLC analysis of the DHE-superoxide product, oxyethidium, and ESR using spin probe CMH. Overexpression of nox1 led to 2-fold increase in superoxide in the aorta after Ang II infusion. Blood pressure was significantly higher in Tg SMnox1 mice treated with Ang II than in their wild type littermate controls. In addition, Ang II-induced aortic hypertrophy was greater in Tg SMnox1 mice. To confirm that this potentiation of vascular hypertrophy and hypertension was due to increased ROS formation, additional groups of mice were coinfused with Tempol. Antioxidant treatment decreased the level of Ang II-induced superoxide production in mouse aortas and partially prevented the development of aortic hypertrophy and hypertension. These data indicate that upregulation of Nox1 does indeed affect both the pressor and hypertrophic responses to Ang II in a ROSdependent manner, supporting the concept that nox1 may be involved in the development of cardiovascular pathologies.",

The mechanism of its protective effects is still not fully understood. In this study, we found that DAS can induce the expression of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), which plays a critical role in cell defense system against oxidative stress. Addition of DAS (up to 1 mM) causes a dose-and timedependent increase of HO-1 protein and mRNA level (about 6fold) without toxicity in HepG2 cells. DAS-induced HO-1 protein expression is dependent on newly synthesized mRNA as actinomycin D can block this induction. Cyclohexmide can block DAS-induced HO-1 mRNA expression suggesting that newly synthesized protein is needed for activation of the ho-1 gene. Further studies show that DAS increases Nrf2 protein expression, nuclear translocation, and DNA-binding activity. The MAP kinase ERK is activated by DAS. Both ERK and p38 pathways play an important role in DAS-induced Nrf2 nuclear translocation and ho-1 gene activation. DAS stimulates a transient increase of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in HepG2 cells. The ROS scavenger, Nacetyl-cysteine blocked this increase of ROS production as well as DAS-induced ERK activation, Nrf2 protein expression and nuclear translocation, and ho-1 gene activation. The increase in HO-1 produced by DAS protected the HepG2 cells against toxicity by hydrogen peroxide or arachidonic acid.Taken together, these results suggest that DAS induces ho-1 through production of ROS, and Nrf2 and MAPK ERK and p38 mediate this induction. Induction of ho-1 may play a role in the protective effects of DAS.",

The effect of selenium on in vivo indicators of oxidative stress and inflammation, two important features of atherosclerosis, is unknown. Aim: To investigate the relationship between serum selenium and 8-iso-PGF2\u03b1 (F2-isoprostane, gold standard indicator of oxidative stress), PGF2\u03b1 (indicator of cyclooxygenase [COX]-mediated inflammation), tocopherols, Creactive protein (CRP) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) in a follow-up study. Methods: Serum selenium was measured in 617 50-year old Swedish men (ULSAM-cohort). Oxidative stress and inflammation were evaluated in a reinvestigation 27 years later by quantification of urinary 8-iso-PGF2\u03b1 and PGF2\u03b1 (15-keto-dihydro-PGF2\u03b1), serum tocopherols, and high sensitive CRP and IL-6.

These associations were independent of diabetes, cardiovascular disease, BMI, hypertension, hyperlipidemia and smoking. Selenium was not associated to CRP or IL-6. Conclusion: High levels of serum selenium predict reduced levels of oxidative stress and subclinical COX-mediated inflammation but not cytokine-mediated inflammation. These associations between selenium, oxidative stress and inflammation might be related to the cardiovascular protective ability of selenium. ",

Other, structurally related tocopherols are present in the human diet but have been largely ignored in the scientific literature. An emerging body of data suggests that gamma tocopherol (\u03b3T), which is actually the most prevalent tocopherol in most diets, may possess anti-inflammatory and other activities in excess of \u03b1-tocopherol. We have identified several bioactivities in which \u03b3T significantly surpasses \u03b1T, and which may be relevant to the pathophysiology of age-related human disease: (1) \u03b3T surpasses \u03b1T as an inhibitor of platelet adhesion in an ex vivo model of thrombogenesis; (2) \u03b3T is superior to \u03b1T as an inducer of heme oxygenase in C3H10T1/2 fibroblast culture (a phenomenon that may explain the superior chemopreventive action of \u03b3T that has been reported in studies of these cells); and (3)in preliminary experiments we find that \u03b3T, but not \u03b1T, suppresses amyloid precursor protein and \u03b2-secretase expression in LN229 astrocytoma cells, a phenomenon that may be significant in designing nutritional strategies to reduce the risk of Alzheimer's disease.

Our recent studies identified a novel mechanism through which physiological concentrations of the isoflavone, genistein inhibited monocyte adhesion to cytokine-activated endothelial cells during flow. Leukocyte-endothelial cell interaction requires adhesion molecule expression and activity. However, the anti-adhesive effects of genistein occurred without altering expression of adhesion molecules that are typically responsible for the rolling and firm adhesion suggesting effects on the avidity of monocyteendothelial cell interactions. To investigate this we assessed genistein(1\u00b5M) -mediated flow (and hence shear stress 0.5-1.5 dyn/cm2) -dependent inhibition of monocyte firm adhesion to TNF\u03b1-activated endothelial cells during flow. Interestingly, the number of rolling cells (quantity) was also inhibited by genistein, the efficiency was increased with increasing flow rates, suggesting a direct relationship between number of rolling and firmly bound cells. In addition, at high flow rates genistein exposure resulted in a re-distribution of rolling velocities such that those monocytes that were rolling did so with higher velocities (i.e. lower quality). In contrast, at low flow-rates, genistein had little effect on the monocyte rolling velocities, but still decreased the total number of rolling cells. These data highlight the critical role of flow in mediating the anti-inflammatory effects of isoflavones. Potential mechanisms include genistein-dependent modulation of the endothelial glycocalyx, an important determinant of how leukocytes adhere to the endothelium during inflammation.",

Ascorbic acid levels were lower at the earliest time point with the ozone exposure; the concentration of GSH, GSSG and the ratio of GSH to GSSG remained unchanged by the ozone exposure; uric acid was significantly increased by the low dose of ozone at the early time point and the high dose of ozone at the 7h time point. We attribute this effect to enhanced purine nucleotide catabolism as a result of massive cell necrosis in the lung tissue. Total antioxidant capacity showed no significant change with ozone exposure. In general, antioxidants in the ozone exposure model of oxidative stress were not changed or showed only high-dose and/or single time point effects.

Enough experimental evidence has now accumulated that has triggered a re-evaluation of TGM as a valid model of accelerated aging. It is established that TGM have significantly elevated superoxide radical production and lipid peroxidation compared to age-matched normal mice, but the dramatic age-related cognitive decline and massive brain cell losses, along with increased incidence of early onset arthritis, cataracts, muscle wasting and dramatically reduced longevity provide strong evidence to support the re-evaluation of this model. Importantly, although old TGM do not show elevated lymphocyte apoptosis or increased chromosome aberrations as would be expected with chronic oxidative stress (possibly through the upregulation of cellular protection and repair processes), it is apparent that TGM do have much higher levels of accumulated oxidative damage. There is a significant increase in apoptosis and structural chromosome aberrations after exposure to ionizing radiation in old TGM compared to age-matched normal mice. This strongly suggests that TGM cells are already at the limit of their ability to cope with the damage produced by the elevated endogenous free radical production and processes associated with oxidative stress (i.e. inflammation and mitochondrial dysfunction). The additional oxidative stress by the radiation dose pushes TGM cells over some upper threshold and their cells literally fall apart. A complex dietary supplement designed to offset oxidative stress and several synergistic processes significantly extends longevity, and completely abolishes radiation-induced increases apoptosis and chromosome aberrations. More importantly it provides total protection to the brain by preventing the massive brain cell losses and cognitive decline in aging TGM. ",

During the following 3 months, the vitamin C status of the young animals remained unchanged.

While the mechanism of CcP activity has been well studied, its biological function remains somewhat unclear. It is generally assumed that CcP plays a role in antioxidant defense, given its ability to neutralize hydrogen peroxide and the fact that expression clones can be selected based on H2O2 resistance, but no systematic study of its in vivo role has been reported. Our goal is to more closely investigate the potential role of CcP in ameliorating the effects of oxidative stress. Because copper-zinc superoxide dismutase (CuZnSOD), like CcP, is present in the IMS, it is of particular interest to examine possible interaction between these two enzymes. We will report the results of our studies on the effects of several oxidative stressors on growth and other characteristics of yeast lacking CcP (ccp1\u2206), which confirm that this mutation causes increased sensitivity to hydrogen peroxide. The redox-cycling drug paraquat (PQ) is often used to generate superoxide in vivo, and wild type yeast treated with PQ exhibit all of the characteristics of yeast lacking CuZnSOD (sod1\u2206), including a reduced growth rate, reduced 4Fe-4S cluster enzyme activity, and various aerobic amino acid auxotrophies. PQ-treated ccp1\u2206 yeast exhibits an increased doubling time and a longer lag phase relative to untreated cells or to the wild type strain in the presence or absence of PQ, and they grow only to about two thirds the density of untreated cells. These results suggest that CcP and CuZnSOD work together to protect the IMS.",

Its principal role is to act as cellular antioxidant. Previous works showed that efflux of GSH was stimulated by vasopresine and epinephrine in perfused rat liver indicating a hormone-dependent liberation. In the present study we decided to analyze the effect of adrenergic agonists on mobilization of the total glutathion (GSHT) in isolated hepatocytes incubated in the presence of adrenergic agonists. Epinephrine, phenylephrine and isoproterenol produced a statistically significant increase (P< 0.01) in the efflux of the cellular GSHT to the incubation media, exclusively in hepatocytes isolated from 48 h fasted rats and incubated during 1 h with Gln, Gly, Ser, Met. This increased efflux was not observed if hepatocytes were isolated from fed rats, or if glucose subtitued the indicated aminoacids (aa) in the incubation mixture. After 1 h incubation with the indicated aa 30 % of GSHT distributed within the cells and 70 % in the incubation mixture. Adrenergic agonists did not modified the increase in GSHT obtained with aa alone, but 15 % was redistributed within the cells and 85 % in the incubation mixture. From these results we conclude that the liberation of cellular GSHT can be influenced by adrenergic agonists, which would partly explain lost of hepatocyte glutathion in conditions of stress or shock (partially supported by grant from 34823M CONACYT).

The relative antioxidant capacity of these flavonoids in cell culture media was: M>Q>K>G, which correlated respectively with the presence of 3, 2, 1, and 0 -OH groups on the B-ring, where formation and decay of flavonoid aroxyl radicals occur. The higher the numbers of -OH groups on the B-ring, the less toxic the flavonoid was to endothelial cells (EC). LD50 was: M (100 uM) > Q (50 uM) > K (20 uM) > G (10 uM). The percent of suppression of \u00bd LD50 of flavonoids on tubular structure formation in vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-stimulated EC on Matrigel was: M (47.3%)> Q (36.9%)> K (15%) > G (14.2%). Adhesion of U937 monocytic cells to interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2 stimulated EC was significantly inhibited with non-toxic doses of flavonoids at the magnitude associated with a relatively high number of -OH groups on the B-ring. The expression of vascular cell adhesion molecular-1, intracellular adhesion molecule-1 and E-selectin by EC, was also inhibited with non-toxic doses of these flavonoids at a magnitude associated with structural-activity related to the -OH groups on the B-ring.

NO generated in the gastric lumen exert beneficial effects but has been also implicated as possible cause of the high incidence of epithelial neoplasia at the gastroesophageal junction.

Polyphenols were the active fraction with chlorogenic acid (CGA) being the most active and concentrated species. Fructose, the most concentrated sugar of apple (6g per 100g) was inactive. Interestingly, ascorbic acid, which is secreted in the stomach, induced a potent burst of NO followed by a decline to the steadystate level of acidified saliva. The simultaneous addition of ascorbate and water apple extract or CGA caused a burst of NO followed by an increased NO steady-state level. EPR Znstabilization and MS studies of CGA treated with acidified nitrite suggested the involvement of semiquinone radicals and nitrated CGA. These studies indicate that the effects of polyphenols is not only the reduction of nitrite-dependent nitrosation/nitration reactions in the lumen but also the promotion of NO bioavailabilty at gastric level, a previously unappreciated function.

All groups were mechanically ventilated and similarly fluid resuscitated. Results: Pulmonary dysfunction in injured, untreated controls was associated with a significant depletion of both \u03b1 and \u03b3tocopherol. Lung tissue Vit.E levels of both @treatment groups were significantly higher as compared to injured controls (p<0.05). In addition, treatment with Vit.E significantly decreased lung tissue 3-nitrotyrosine levels (untreated, 163\u00b142; Vit. E nebulized, 7\u00b12; Oral Vit. E 36 \u00b1 0.4 nM) and improved PaO2/FiO2 ratio at 48h post injury (untreated, 93\u00b115.9; Oral Vit. E, 232\u00b131.8; Nebulized, 305\u00b130.9). Conclusions: Administration of Vit.E (especially nebulized) may be a useful therapeutic option in patients with combined burn and smoke inhalation injury. Oxidative stress, i.e. imbalance between reactive oxygen species (ROS) and antioxidant defenses, contributes to the progression of chronic heart failure (CHF). Acute inhibition of xanthine oxidase, which generates as a by-product ROS, improves mechanical efficiency of the failing heart, but the longterm effects of xanthine oxidase inhibition in CHF are unknown. Methods and results. We assessed, in rats with CHF, the longterm effects of the xanthine oxidase inhibitor allopurinol on hemodynamics, left ventricular (LV) function and structure Allopurinol administrated in rats with well established CHF (50 mg.kg -1 .day -1 for 10 weeks starting 8 weeks after coronary ligation) does not modify LV end-systolic pressure, but reduces LV end-diastolic pressure (from 26.8\u00b14.8 to 12.5\u00b12.5 mm Hg) and LV relaxation constant Tau 5 (from 20\u00b13 to 13\u00b11 ms) and increases and cardiac output (from 110\u00b15 to 131\u00b14 ml.min -1 ). Moreover, allopurinol decreases LV diastolic diameter (from 10.4\u00b10.2 to 9.4\u00b10.3 mm), weight (from 0.92\u00b10.03 to 0.86\u00b10.03 g) and collagen density (from 4.3\u00b10.1 to 3.3\u00b10.1 %). After 10 weeks, allopurinol reduces uric acid plasma levels from 1.5\u00b10.3 to 0.6\u00b10.1 ml.dl -1 , but not myocardial TBARS levels (from 0.63\u00b10.17 to 0.64\u00b10.13 AU.\u00b5protein -1 ). Conclusions. In experimental CHF, long-term allopurinol treatment improves LV hemodynamics and function, and prevents LV remodelling. Whether the effects of allopurinol are due to a transitory myocardial ROS reduction shortly after initiation of the chronic treatment or independent of a myocardial oxidative stress reduction remains to be determined, since markers of oxidative stress are not modified at the end of the treatment.

            "text": "Radical-scavenging mechanism of phenolic antioxidants has attracted considerable interest with regard to the development of chemopreventive agents against oxidative stress and associated diseases. There are two mechanisms for the radical-scavenging reactions, i.e., a one-step hydrogen atom transfer from the phenolic OH group or an electron transfer oxidation of the antioxidants followed by proton transfer. Metal ions are a powerful tool to distinguish between these two mechanisms, since electron-transfer reactions are known to be significantly accelerated by the presence of metal ions. Recently, we have reported that no effect of magnesium ion (Mg 2+ ) on the scavenging rates of 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radical (DPPH \u00b7 ) or galvinoxyl radical (GO \u00b7 ) by a vitamin E model, 2,2,5,7,8pentamethylchroman-6-ol (1H) in deaerated acetonitrile (MeCN) has been observed, indicating that the radical-scavenging reactions by 1H in MeCN proceed via a one-step hydrogen atom transfer rather than via electron transfer. On the other hand, the scavenging reactions of DPPH \u00b7 or GO \u00b7 by 1H in deaerated methanol (MeOH) were significantly accelerated by the presence of Mg 2+ . This indicates that the radical-scavenging reactions of 1H in MeOH may include an electron-transfer process. The detailed mechanism will be discussed based on kinetic, spectroscopic, and electrochemical data obtained in this study. ",

The spectroscopic and kinetic studies have demonstrated that the rate of hydrogen transfer from C1 to galvinoxyl radical (GO \u00b7 ) is about 5-fold faster than that of hydrogen transfer from the native C0 to GO \u00b7 . We have also demonstrated that the O2 \u00b7--generating ability of the dianion form of C1 generated in the reaction of C1 with 2 equiv of Bu4NOMe in deaerated acetonitrile (MeCN) is much lower than that of C1, suggesting that C1 may be a promising novel antioxidant with reduced pro-oxidant activity. In this study, we have synthesized 8 planar catechin derivatives with different length of carbon side chains by using [CH3 (CH2) n] 2CO (n = 1-8) instead of acetone. It was found that the larger the number of the carbon in the side chains is, the faster the GO \u00b7 -scavenging rates become.

Epidemiological data have indicated that a diet rich in whole grain foods is associated with reduced risk of developing atherosclerosis and hypertension. Earlier we have shown that avenanthramides, polyphenols found exclusively in oat grain, inhibited proinflammatory cytokines and adhesive interaction of immune and endothelial cells. Here we report the specific effect of avenanthramide C (Av-C) prepared synthetically on human aortic SMC (HASMC) proliferation and NO production. We found that Av-C dose-dependently inhibited serum-induced HASMC proliferation as measured by [ 3 H] thymidine incorporation and by counting cell numbers. The IC 50 of Av-C was around 50 \u00b5M. Incubation of cells with 120 \u00b5M Av-C for 4 days inhibited cell growth by more than 50%. This inhibitory effect of Av-C was associated with an increase in the expression of p21CIP1. In addition, Av-C treatment significantly increased NO production and eNOS mRNA expression as measured by real time PCR. At 80 \u00b5M Av-C, NO production and eNOS mRNA expression levels increased by 2.1 and 3.5 fold, respectively. The HASMC expression of vascular cell adhesion molecular-1 (VCAM-1) was not affected by Av-C treatment. These data suggest that avenanthramides in oats may have great potential to prevent vascular dysfunction and development of atherosclerotic lesion by inhibiting vascular SMC proliferation and increasing NO production.

Thus, it is of great importance to detect and characterize the phenoxyl radicals of such antioxidants. The phenoxyl radical 1 \u00b7 generated by the reaction of a vitamin E model, 2,2,5,7,8pentamethylchroman-6-ol (1H), with 2,2-bis(4-tert-octylphenyl)-1picrylhydrazyl (DOPPH \u00b7 ), was significantly stabilized by a complex formation with magnesium ion (Mg 2+ ) in deaerated acetonitrile at 298 K. The ESR spectrum of the Mg 2+ complex of 1 \u00b7 (Mg 2+ -1 \u00b7 ) was observed at g = 2.0040, which is appreciably smaller than the g value of 1 \u00b7 (2.0047), indicating that the spin density on the oxygen nuclei of 1 \u00b7 in the presence of Mg 2+ is decreased by complexation with Mg 2+ . The assignment of hyperfine coupling constants (hfc) obtained by the computer simulation of the observed ESR spectrum of the Mg 2+ complex of 1 \u00b7 (Mg 2+ -1 \u00b7 ) was carried out using three deuterated isotopomers of 1 \u00b7 , i.e., 5-CD3-1 \u00b7 , 7-CD3-1 \u00b7 , and 8-CD3-1 \u00b7 , where a methyl group at C5, C7, or C8 position is replaced by a CD3 group, respectively. The decreased spin density of the benzene ring in the Mg 2+ -1 \u00b7 complex indicates that the delocalization of the unpaired electron in 1 \u00b7 into Mg 2+ by complexation between Mg 2+ and 1 \u00b7 results in the enhanced stability of 1 \u00b7 in the presence of Mg 2+ .",

These in vitro findings have implied that the parent neuroprotective 17Bu-E2 was formed from its quinol in the cells. Then, we have also shown that the phenolic A-ring 17Bu-E2 can be efficiently revived, by an enzyme-catalyzed process involving NAD(P)H as a co-factor, from the corresponding quinol without producing ROS (unlike redox cycling involving chatechol metabolites).

Administration of CCl4 induces a very severe oxidant injury to the liver. ATS, but not AT-acetate, administered intraperitoneally (IP) was previously shown histologically to markedly reduce CCl4-induced liver injury. However, no measures of oxidative injury were performed. We therefore examined the effect of ATS to inhibit CCl4-induced lipid peroxidation. Rats were treated with varying doses of ATS (100, 50, 25, and 10 mg/kg IP 24 hrs before administering CCl4, (3.0 g/kg by oral gavage). Unesterified F2-isoprostanes (IsoPs) in plasma and esterified IsoPs in liver were measured 3 hrs after administration of CCl4. IsoPs in liver in control animals (45.6 ( 10.2 ng/g) increased to 217.9 ( ng/g in CCl4 treated rats. Treatment with ATS resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in liver IsoP levels reaching a maximum mean reduction of 72.3% in CCl4 treated animals treated with 100 mg/kg ATS (p<0.01). Plasma IsoPs in control animals (253.5 pg/ml) increased to 3310 pg/ml in CCl4 treated rats. Plasma IsoP levels were reduced by a mean of 74.2% in CCl4 treated rats treated with 100 mg/kg ATS (p<0.01). These data demonstrate that pareteral administration of ATS rapidly and effectively reduces lipid peroxidation induced by CCl4. This also suggests that parenteral administration of VES may represent a valuable approach to acutely and effectively suppress oxidant injury in other situations of oxidative stress.",

Obesity is associated with greatly increased risk for morbidity and mortality, which could be attributed in part to oxidative stress resulting from increased energy expenditure required to maintain body weight. To further define these relationships, we explored the effect of modest reduction in caloric intake in 29 overweight females (BMI 31 \u00b1 4.7, . Subjects were placed on a nutrient balanced diet 25% below their daily energy requirement for 28 days. Plasma IsoP levels 6 and 0 days prior to starting the diet were elevated (57.8 \u00b1 6.0 and 57.8 \u00b1 5.5 pg/ml) compared to the normal range (36.3 \u00b1 2.1 pg/ml) (p<0.01). After only 24 hrs on the diet IsoP levels had fallen precipitously to 36.3 \u00b1 3.0 pg/ml (p<0.01), which was within the normal range. IsoP levels on days 3, 7, 14, 21, and 29 on the diet remained within the normal range (32.8 to 36.3 pg/ml). IsoP levels were measured 12, 30 and 150 days after an ad lib diet was resumed. At 12 days post diet, IsoP levels (41.3 \u00b1 3.5 pg/ml) were slightly but not significantly higher than levels during the diet. At 30 and 150 days post-diet, IsoP levels (63.3 \u00b1 5.7 and 62.5 \u00b1 5.3 pg/ml) were not significantly different from elevated pre-diet levels. These data indicate that modest caloric reduction rapidly reduces and sustains enhanced oxidantive stress in overweight humans, which provides novel insights into the relationships between energy expenditure, oxidative stress, and obesity. In particular it suggests that caloric intake rather than BMI per se is responsible for oxidative stress in obesity.",

Caloric restriction (CR) extends life span and retards age-related diseases, yet the underlying mechanisms are unknown. Oxidative stress may be decreased through caloric restriction. Oxidative stress results from an increase in reactive oxygen species production, a decrease in antioxidant protection, or a combination of the two. Forty-eight healthy, nonsmoking, male (25-50y) and female (25-45y), overweight participants (25 \u00a3 BMI < 30) were randomized into one of four groups; group 1 = 25% CR, group 2 = 12.5% CR + 12.5% increased energy expenditure through physical activity, group 3 = low calorie diet (LCD) until 15% weight reduction followed by weight maintenance, group 4 = Healthy diet for weight maintenance (control). Subjects were fed by the metabolic kitchen from Weeks 1-12 and were taught a calorie counting system to allow them to prepare their own meals for the next 10 weeks (Weeks 12-22). Subjects returned to the Center for feeding from Weeks 22-24. Antioxidant power was measured using the ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) assay at baseline, month 3, and month 6.

Mean values of FRAP (umol/L) at 0 and 6 months were as follows: control (949,979), CR (927,891), and LCD (873,860). However, FRAP decreased by 10% (899 to 823) in the caloric restriction + physical activity group (p<0.001) at 6 months. This study supports previous data that exercise induces oxidative stress. This study also suggests that 6 months of caloric restriction in non-obese humans does not change antioxidant protection.

Culture in the presence of 50-200 \u00b5M lipoic acid increased the ability of the cells to reduce dehydroascorbic acid to ascorbate, and to maintain intracellular concentrations of the vitamin. Whereas loading cells with low millimolar intracellular concentrations of ascorbic acid partially prevented loss of GSH induced by 50 \u00b5M menadione, lipoic acid accentuated this loss, and caused a small decrease in GSH even in the absence of menadione. On the other hand, in the face of oxidant stress due to menadione, cells treated with 50-200 \u00b5M lipoic acid both facilitated reduction of dehydroascorbic acid to ascorbate and preserved ascorbate in cells that already contained the vitamin.",

To learn about the mechanism of antioxidant action of plasmalogens, we studied the interaction of singlet oxygen and oxidizing radicals with a semi-synthetic plasmenylcholine and, for comparison, with polyunsaturated fatty acid methyl esters and cholesterol. Progress of peroxidation of lipids, induced by photosensitized oxidation reaction or free radicals was monitored by EPR-oximetry, iodometric detection of lipid hydroperoxides and HPLC-EC(Hg) detection of characteristic cholesterol hydroperoxides. Time-resolved phosphorescence at 1270 nm was used to measure the interaction of singlet oxygen with plasmenylcholine and other lipids. Pulse radiolysis was employed to determine rate constants of the interaction of plasmenylcholine with oxidizing radicals. In organic solvents, palsmenylcholine quenched singlet oxygen with the corresponding rate constant (1-6)x10 6 M -1 s -1 , almost two orders of magnitude faster than cholesterol and other unsaturated lipids did. Although bromide and trichloromethylperoxyl radicals reacted with plasmenylcholine up to 100 time faster than with cholesterol and polyunsaturated fatty acid methyl esters, the interaction of plasmenylcholine with oxidizing radicals did not lead to the formation of its stable hydroperoxides. Antioxidant properties of plasmalogens are probably a consequence of both high reactivity of the vinyl ether bond with reactive oxygen species and inefficiency of plasmalogen oxidation products to promote further peroxidation.

Influenza viral infection of a host deficient in selenium (Se), an essential component of the antioxidant enzymes glutathione peroxidase and thioredoxin reductase, leads to increased lung pathology compared to infected Se-adequate hosts. Influenza viruses isolated from Se-deficient hosts develop specific mutations in the viral genome, resulting in a more pathogenic strain of virus. In order to understand the mechanism(s) by which host nutritional status promotes viral mutation, we examined the host cellular responses, viral responses and the host innate immune response. The innate immune response, characterized by the early production of anti-viral cytokines including interferon (IFN)-a/b, IFN-g, and IL-12, plays an important role in controlling the replication of many viruses and in directing the magnitude of the subsequent adaptive immune response.",

Quantitative real-time PCR was performed for the cytokines and normalized to G3PDH. Se deficiency resulted in 2-4 fold decrease in production of IFN-a, IFN-b and IFN-g, at 24h p.i., a 4-fold decrease in IL-6 and 2-fold decrease in MCP-1 at 72 h p.i. IL-12 gene expression and natural killer cell cytotoxicity were not altered. These data demonstrate that Se deficiency impairs the early, antiviral cytokine response and at least one aspect of the proinflammatory and chemokine responses. These changes in gene expression may correlate with the emergence of the viral mutations.",

The increase of absorption at 234nm for methyl linoleate hydroperoxide and/or hydroxide was observed after an exposure to air (72-120h) in a glass vessel. The increase value under air containing the VR gas (0.1-1.0mg/m3-air) was less than that without VR gas. The same effect was observed under air containing 1,8-cineole, the main component of VR. Moreover, the antioxidative effects of VR gas were evaluated by the formation of intracellular ROS with a fluorescent probe, DCFH-DA, in human fibroblast NB1RGB cells induced by an ultraviolet radiation. The increase of the fluorescence emission of cells under air containing VR gas was less than that without VR gas. These results suggest that the volatile constituents of a rosemary extract had antioxidative properties and the gaseous release of antioxidant can be a promising method to promoting the indoor air quality.",

In India, the use of MSG is increasing tremendously due to the craze for Chinese, Japanese and ready made foods like 2-minute noodles, soups, souses etc. all containing MSG. The interest in the toxicity of MSG as a flavor enhancer has increased greatly because of the association this compound with Chinese restaurant syndrome in human beings. In our previous work, we have reported that MSG produced hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia and hence oxidative stress in tissues like erythrocytes, liver and arteries, which are one of the factors responsible for the onset of coronary heart disease (CHD). CHD is one of the major causes of death in the developed and developing countries like India. At the threshold of this millennium CHD is looming large, as a new epidemic, afflicting Indians at a relatively younger age therefore an immediate attention is needed to prevent this disease. So, in the present work, we wanted to study the effect of MSG on lipid peroxidation (LPO) along with its effect on glutathione and its metabolizing enzymes like glutathione reductase (GR) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) in cardiac tissue upon MSG administration. In the present study, MSG at dose level of 4mg and 8mg/g body weight was administered subcutaneously for 6 consecutive days to normal adult male mice and its effect was observed on 31st day after the last injection in cardiac tissue. A significant increase was observed in LPO level by 10% -19% in heart. The level of total sulfhydryl (T-SH) and protein bound sulfhydryl (PB-SH) group was found to be significantly increased by 27.6% to 39% and 25% to 43% respectively, whereas the level of non-protein bound sulfhydryl (NPB-SH) group, representing glutathione was significantly decreased by 19% to 29% and the activity of GR and GPx was significantly decreased by 4% to15 % and 24% to 40% respectively in cardiac tissue of MSG treated animals. So, the present work suggested that administration of MSG at dose level of 4mg and 8mg/g body weight induced oxidative stress in the cardiac tissue and thereby being responsible for the initiation of coronary heart disease/ atherosclerosis.",

UVA (315-400 nm) penetrates deeper into the skin than UVB (280-315 nm). Whereas UVB causes direct damage to the epidermal cells, UVA may be responsible for oxidative damage to melanocytes situated on the basal layer of the epidermis and fibroblasts in the dermis. Especially, the skin fibroblasts play an important role in the maintenance of the extracellular matrix in the dermis. We studied the effects of various antioxidant treatments on endogenous production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in melanocytes and fibroblasts and on UV induced lipid peroxidation. ROS was measured fluorimetrically after incubation of the cells with the probe 2,3-dihydrorhodamine (DHR123). ROS levels in melanocytes and fibroblasts was reduced by 24 hour pretreatment of the cells with \u03b1-tocopherol and ascorbic acid (vitE/C). Lipid peroxidation after UV irradiation was measured by HPLC detection of malondialdehyde in cellular supernatants or by fluorescent detection of the cells using C11-BODIPY581/591 as an indicator of lipid peroxidation. VitE/C preincubation strongly prevented the lipid peroxidation. Extracts from tomato, white tea and grape seed could improve these positive effects obtained by vitE/C treatment. Longer pre-treatment of the cells with the antioxidant mixtures further reduced both the ROS levels of the cells and the UV induced lipid peroxidation. In vivo reduction of oxidative damage in skin cells may have important consequences for the (photo)aging processes occurring in the skin. ",

Plasma a-Toc level is regulated by hepatic a-toc transfer protein (TTP). Alpha-Toc is mainly transported in HDL . Scavenger receptor B1(SRB1) has been shown to mediate alpha-toc transfer from HDL to cells while ATP binding cassette A1 (ABCA1) mediates cellular a-Toc secretion into lipoprotein metabolic pathway. The present study was targeted to investigate whether aging and environmental pollution can modulate tocopherol transfer mechanisms. We determined the effects of pollutants i.e. UV (0.3 MED), O3 (0.25 ppm 6 hr per day) and tobacco smoke (TS; 60 mg/m3, 6 hr per day) alone or in combination for 4 days on lung tissues from young (8 weeks old) and old (18 months) hairless mice. Tissue RNA was isolated and a-toc levels were assessed. Real time PCR was used to quantify gene expression. A significant decrease in TTP and SRB1 mRNA in the old compared to the young was detected. O3 as well as ETS induced a further decrease in both genes while ABCA1 remained unchanged. Plasma lipoprotein and lung vitamin E contents were also assessed and showed significant atoc depletion in old mice. These data suggests that aging attenuates vitamin E transport and uptake in the lungs and this is further attenuated by environmental pollutants, and that age dependent repression of specific lipid transport genes may prevent anticipated benefits from dietary vitamin E supplementations. *These authors contributed equally to the study. as a powerful model for understanding biological processes ranging from growth and development to aging and disease. Since redox-based pathways play important roles in normal biology and disease, it is important to understand the micronutrient (and non-nutrient) antioxidant requirements of Drosophila. Herein, we report a quantitative assessment of the water-and lipid-soluble antioxidant profile of Canton S (wild-type) and ry531 (urate-deficient) Drosophila strains, and demonstrate that dietary provision or restriction of these antioxidants is a powerful means by which to modulate antioxidant status and oxidative stress responses in the fly. Along with significantly lower urate levels (<5%), ascorbate concentrations in urate-deficient flies were ~50% that of wild-type flies. Both Drosophila strains contained detectable levels of \u03b1and \u03b3tocopherol and provision of \u03b1and \u03b3-tocopherol in the diet dramatically increased fly tissue levels. Studies using 14 C-labeled ascorbate, coupled with accelerator mass spectrometry measurements, demonstrated that the pharmacokinetics of ascorbate in the fly parallel those observed in humans. In contrast, flies cultured on a diet devoid of micronutrient antioxidants led to depletion of ascorbate, \u03b1and \u03b3tocopherol. Dietary provision or restriction of micronutrient antioxidants led to hypersensitivity of flies to paraquat-induced mortality, suggesting that flies naturally maintain an optimal level of endogenous antioxidants derived from the standard diet. Collectively, the data demonstrate that the antioxidant status of Drosophila can be modulated by dietary provision or restriction, and that this alters oxidative stress responses. ",

Derivatives of 4-OH TEMPO carrying acyl chain from C-2 (acetyl) up to C-16 (palmitoyl) were synthesized. The experiments were carried out on SMPs -submitochondrial particles, obtained from human fullterm placentas from healthy women. The oxidative stress was induced by cumene hydroperoxide due to cytochrome P450 activity present in SMPs. A level of oxidative stress was evaluated on the basis of lipid peroxidation, measured as malondialdehyde and 4-hydroxy-2(E)-nonenal produced. The inhibition of lipid peroxidation was observed for all tested aminoxyls and achieved the maximal inhibition rate of 70% as compared to the hydroperoxide-stimulated control. The lipophilicity of tested substances varied by 14,000-fold. Interestingly the aminoxyl C-8 carying octanoyl acyl chain performing the maximal protection of SMPs exhibited the lipophilicity of 1,000-fold higher than the one of the lowest lipophilicity within the group. This observation correlats with the results obtained by EPR analysis of the effective rotational correlation time parameters of investigated piperidine aminoxyls. The rotational time of aminoxyl performing the maximal protection showed the intermediate value of rotational correlation time. These results suggest that efficacy of aminoxyl antioxidant protection strongly depends on the structure of the molecule determining its lipophilicity and thus the lateral mobility and freedom of rotation within the membrane.

Accumulating evidences suggest that cellular redox status plays an important role in regulating viral replication and infectivity. The effect of oxidative stress on coronavirus 229E has not been defined. Since enhanced oxidative stress in glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD)deficient human fibroblasts were previously shown by us, these cells were used as host cells to further delineate the effects of oxidative stress on viral infection. After 48h post-infection, cell viability of G6PD-deficient fibroblasts were 21% lower than normal fibroblasts at 0.625 multiplicity of infection (M.O.I.) as determined by MTT cell proliferation assay. In addition, G6PD-deficient fibroblasts with increasing passages exhibited increased susceptibility to coronavirus 229E infection than their counterpart with lower passages. The titer of viral particles from G6PDdeficient human fibroblasts were higher than normal fibroblasts. In order to eliminate the different genomic background of these cells, we used stable transfection to over-express G6PD in G6PDdificient fibroblasts. After viral infection, the survival of G6PDdeficient fibroblasts were 15% lower than G6PD-overexpressed fibroblasts at 0.625 M.O.I.. Taken together, these data support our hypothesis that enhanced oxidative stress in host cells render G6PD-deficient cells more susceptible to coronavirus 229E infection than control cells.",

Our aim in this study was to find out the mechanisms of redifferentiation and reversion of malignant human gastric cancer cells induced by sodium selenite. In this research, 6 mM ascorbic acid was used as a positive control and we found many of the malignant characteristics alleviated in human gastric cancer cells when treated with 75 \u00a6\u00ccm hydrogen peroxide. After 2, 4, 6 or 8 mM AA treatment, the content of H2O2 and the activity of SOD resulted in a time-and dose-dependent increase. These treatments also resulted in a time-and concentration-dependent decrease of CAT. The amount of MDA was reduced in low concentrations of AA (2 and 4 mM), but was raised in high concentrations (6 and 8 mM). The effects of AA on inducing cell redifferentiation were concentration dependent, so these effects were unlikely to be related to MDA alteration. Our interest focused on the increase of H2O2 production and SOD activity and the decrease of CAT activity. When using 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole (AT) (1.5 mM) as an inhibitor of CAT activity, no ideal redifferentiation was observed compared with the control. When SOD (200 U\u00a1\u00a4ml-1) was added to the medium, the effects on inducing redifferentiation were insignificant. But, after treatment with H2O2 (75 \u00a6\u00ccM), the redifferentiation of human gastric cancer cells was induced successfully. Conclusions Altogether, our studies showed that ascorbic acid induced growth inhibition and redifferentiation of human gastric cancer cells through the production of hydrogen peroxide. These results suggest that ascorbic acid may be a potent anticancer agent for human gastric cancer cells. ",

This study investigated the role of free radicals in graft energetic status in small-for-size liver grafts. After harvest, liver grafts were reduced in size to ~50% ex vivo, and implanted into recipients of similar or greater body weight, resulting in a relative graft weight of 50% (half-size) or 25% (quarter-size). Serum transaminase was 3-fold higher after transplantation of quarter-size than of full-size grafts. Cell proliferation, detected by BrdU, increased from <1% to 17% after transplantation of half-size grafts. By contrast, BrdU labeling was only 1% in quarter-size grafts. Survival decreased from 100% for full-size grafts to 30% for quarter-size grafts. ATP concentration in the livers decreased to 30% of normal in quartersize liver grafts. Mitochondrial DNA contains genes which encode proteins critical for mitochondrial function. The ratio of mitochondrial DNA/nuclear DNA decreased by 30% after transplantation in quarter-size relative to full-size grafts (p<0.05). Polyphenols (20 \u00b5g/mL), potent scavengers of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS and RNS), largely prevented transaminase release, restored cell proliferation, completely prevented decreases of mitochondrial DNA, restored ATP levels to 75% and improved survival to 70%. Polyphenols also prevented increases of ROS and RNS in quarter-size liver grafts measured by ESR and nitrotyrosine staining. Taken together, small-for-size liver transplantation decreases mitochondrial DNA and inhibits energy production, probably due to increased ROS and RNS production. These effects can be effectively prevented by free radical scavengers.",

            "text": "Dietary flavonoids have been suggested to exert numerous health effects by antioxidant mechanisms. We investigated the ability of a number of flavonoids belonging to the flavone, flavonol, flavanone and flavan-3-ol subclasses to protect cellular DNA from H2O2-induced damage, and explored underlying molecular mechanisms. Jurkat cells were exposed to continuously generated H2O2 in the presence or absence of the flavonoid compounds, and formation of single strand breaks in nuclear DNA was assessed by the comet assay (single cell gel electrophoresis). The results indicated the following structural requirements of flavonoids for effective DNA protection: a) the ortho-dihydroxy structure either in ring A or B; b) the hydroxyl moiety at position 3 in combination with the oxo-group at position 4; and c) the presence of a C2,C3 double bond in ring C. Moreover, in order to be effective, flavonoids have to be able to penetrate the plasma membrane, as indicated by the decreased protection offered by the glucosylated conjugates. In contrast to free luteolin, the ability of its complex with Fe 2+ to protect nuclear DNA was decreased as the ratio of iron to luteolin increased; the complex was completely inactive when the ratio was 1:1. In addition, luteolin was able to remove iron from calcein loaded into cells, while chrysin, which did not offer protection against DNA damage, was unable to remove iron. In conclusion, the results presented in this work strongly support the notion that intracellular iron chelation is the most likely mechanism by which flavonoids protect cells against H2O2-induced DNA damage.",
