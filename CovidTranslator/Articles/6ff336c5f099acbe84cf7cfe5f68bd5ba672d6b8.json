The study herds were selected from farrow-to-finish herds (n=99) that entered in the PigINFO (PED epidemic), any herds with clinical signs of PED and feces positive for porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) on polymerase chain reaction analysis and/or immunohistochemical staining were defined as PED-positive (n=38). They were further classified into those with long PED periods (L-PED-positive; n=28) and those with short PED periods (S-PED-positive; n=10). Herds with no clinical signs of PED were classified as PED-negative (n=61). Herdlevel production data, including preweaning mortality (%; PRWM), postweaning mortality (%; POWM), pigs weaned per litter (PWL), pigs born alive per litter, litters per mated female per year and pigs marketed per sow (MP), were calculated every 3 months during study period. During the PED epidemic, L-PED-positive herds had significantly higher PRWM and POWM than PED-negative herds, and L-PEDpositive and S-PED-positive herds had significantly lower PWL. During October-December 2014, L-PED-positive herds had significantly fewer MP than PED-negative herds. The PED outbreak increased mortality and consequently reduced the numbers of marketed pigs. The rapid control of an outbreak is important for reducing the financial losses arising from PED infections.",

PED outbreaks were subsequently reported in other Asian countries, including Korea [6] , Taiwan [7] and Thailand [11] , and were then reported in European countries, including Germany in 2014 [4] and Belgium in 2015 [15] . PED was identified in the United States for the first time in May 2013 [12] and spread rapidly to approximately 50% of the US swine breeding herds from July 2013 to July 2014 [3] . The PED isolates collected in the United States were genetically similar to those obtained in Asian [2, 6, 7, 10] and European countries [4, 15] , indicating potential trans-continental transmission.",

Data associated with the porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) infections in each herd were investigated by 15 veterinarians belonging to the Japan Association of Swine Veterinarians (JASV). From 1 April to 30 June 2014 (PED epidemic), any herds with clinical signs of PED and feces that tested positive for PEDV with polymerase chain reaction and/or immunohistochemical staining at local livestock hygiene centers were defined as PED-positive. Herds that showed no clinical signs of PED or were negative for PEDV on the abovementioned laboratory tests were classified as negative. Herds for which there was no information on PED status, with missing data, or in which PED was confirmed before 31 March 2014 were excluded from the study. The final sample sizes in the PED-positive and PED-negative groups were 38 and 61 herds, respectively. For all PED-positive herds, the participating veterinarians recorded the types of barns in which the pigs showed clinical symptoms. In the PED-positive herds, the dates of the initial PED diagnosis and the disappearance of clinical signs from the herd were also recorded by the veterinarians. The PED period for each PED-positive herd was defined as the number of days between the initial PED diagnosis and the disappearance of clinical signs. The PED-positive herds were then further classified into those with a long PED period (\u226530 days; L-PED-positive; n=28) and those with a short PED period (<30 days; S-PED-positive; n=10). This cutoff value (30 days) for the PED period was determined by visually inspecting the distribution of PED periods. Thus, the targeted herds were classified into three groups (PEDnegative, L-PED-positive and S-PED-positive), and their productivity, characterized with the production parameters described below, was compared during the study period.",

The herdlevel productivity data, such as preweaning mortality (%; PRWM), postweaning mortality (%; POWM), pigs weaned per litter (PWL), pigs born alive per litter (PBA), litters per mated female (LMFY) and numbers of marketed pigs (/sow/ year; MP), were calculated based on the definitions as described previously [17] .

Analysis of variance, with repeated measures, was used to determine the differences in the productivity parameters among the three groups, the study periods and their interactions. If the interactions were significant for any of the parameters, analysis of covariance, with log-transformed AFI as the covariate, was performed among the three groups at different time points. Multiple comparisons were made to detect differences between the means of the groups at different time points using Bonferroni's test. Statistical differences were defined as P<0.05.

            "text": "Reduced productivity, characterized by PRWM, POWM and PWL, was only observed during April-June 2014, which indicates that in many of the PED-positive herds, the outbreaks were controlled within a short period. This finding agrees with those reported in the United States, in which many PED-infected herds reached their baseline production levels within 12.6 weeks [3] . This may be because the herds rapidly developed immunity and therefore recovered from the severe POWM after the PED outbreak [3] . Alternatively, the owners of the herds targeted in the present study may have taken urgent preventive action, because they used consulting veterinary services. In many of the PED-positive herds, the clinical signs of PED were observed in the nursery and finishing barns, which is consistent with the evidence of higher POWM in the PED-positive herds. This finding is also consistent with that of a previous report [8] , but contradicts to that of another study [7] , in which no mortality was observed in stages other than the suckling stage. These different results may be attributable to differences in the swine management systems used. For example, most of the herds targeted in the present study were farrow-to-finish systems, which are at higher risk of introducing pathogens into the postweaning stages than other production systems. The increased POWM in the PED-positive herds in the present study was similar to that reported in a retrospective cohort study in which pigs that survived PED infection showed a 10% increase in postweaning mortality [1] . The L-PED-positive herds had significantly higher AFI than the PED-negative herds. This may be because herds with larger size required more time and efforts to control PED. The L-PED-positive herds had higher PBA and LMFY than in the PED-negative herds, although these differences were not significant. This indicates that the L-PED-positive herds are more common among larger herds, which usually involve more intensive production systems and more rigorous biosecurity measures. Many participating veterinarians commented that the first PED cases in their regions appeared in herds with excellent biosecurity controls (personal communication), which is inconsistent with the standard theories regarding many other infectious swine diseases, and constitutes a mysterious aspect of the PED outbreaks in Japan.",

This was a direct consequence of the reduced number of weaned pigs, caused by piglet death and slaughtering during the PED epidemic.
