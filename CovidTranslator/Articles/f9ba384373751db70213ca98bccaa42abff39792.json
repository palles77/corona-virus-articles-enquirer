            "text": "The entry of enveloped viruses into cells is known to occur via two primary pathways: some viruses deliver their genomes to the cytosol after their envelopes fuse with the plasma membrane at the cell surface, whereas others take advantage of the cell's endocytic machinery. In the latter mechanism, the endocytosed virions are subjected to an activation step in the endosome, which is typically mediated by the acidic endosomal pH, resulting in fusion of the viral and endosomal membranes and release of the viral genome into the cytosol. Therefore, the endocytic mechanism is thought to be a pH-sensitive process, while direct membrane fusion is pH-independent. The endocytic pathways exploited by animal viruses to gain entry into host cells include macropinocytosis, clathrin-dependent endocytosis, and caveolae-dependent endocytosis, as well as poorly characterized routes such as clathrin-and caveolae-independent endocytosis [3, 4] . Although most viruses www.cell-research.com | Cell Research Hongliang Wang et al. 291 npg use only one of these pathways to enter cells, recent studies have shown that some viruses use multiple mechanisms to gain entry into host cells [5] [6] [7] [8] .",

Some later studies have shown that entry of SARS-CoV may be pH-dependent [12] , and that the endosomal protease cathepsin L [13, 14] might be involved, suggesting that this virus may employ endocytosis. Because conflicting results have been obtained by various research groups using similar experimental methods, such as fluorospectrometric monitoring of GFP-labeled pseudovirus entry into host cells, we decided to use a different approach. We labeled the SARS-CoV functional receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) with GFP by stable transfection of human embryonic kidney 293E (HEK293E) cells. Receptor recycling was then tracked after the cells were treated with pseudoviruses or the spike protein, a membrane component of SARS-CoV that mediates membrane fusion and is required for viral entry [11, 12] . This new approach greatly improves experimental stability and reliability. The results showed that SARS-CoV entered cells via receptor-dependent, pH-sensitive endocytosis. We also showed that the specific endocytic pathway used by SARS-CoV to enter cells is clathrin-and caveolae-independent. Moreover, lipid rafts were found to play an important role in this process.",

The 293E-ACE2-GFP cell line allowed for direct tracking of the movement of the receptor under a fluorescence microscope. In agreement with a previous report, which showed that ACE2 expression in some nonpermissive cells renders them permissive to infection [15] , both of these stable cell lines can be infected by spike-bearing pseudoviruses (Supplementary information Figure S1 ).",

Purified recombinant spike protein fused to the human IgG Fc fragment (S1190-Fc) was added to 293E-ACE2-GFP cells. After incubation at 37 \u00b0C for 3 h, a number of GFP-containing vesicles were observed in the perinuclear area ( Figure 1B) , whereas vesicles were not observed in the control cells treated with Fc protein alone ( Figure 1C ), suggesting that spike protein specifically induced translocation of ACE2-GFP from the cell surface to the interior of the cells. Statistical analysis of the percentage of cells in which vesicles accumulated showed that there was a significant difference between the effects of these treatments on virus entry (Supplementary information Figure S2 ). A dual staining assay for spike protein and ACE2-GFP showed colocalization of these two proteins ( Figure 1D ), which suggests that spike protein was bound to ACE2 in the vesicles and that spike protein was taken up by the cell, most likely by endocytosis. The fact that spike protein induced translocation of ACE2 from the cell surface to intracellular compartments is in agreement with our previous finding that surface expression of ACE2 in Vero E6 cells decreased after incubation with spike protein at 37 \u00b0C for 3 h [16] .",

We found that after treatment with ammonium chloride, bafilomycin A1, or chloroquine, the viral receptor was trapped within perinuclear vacuoles, even after a 14-h incubation, a period that would allow the receptor to be recycled to the cell surface under normal conditions ( Figure 1F and unpublished data).

Pseudoviruses are often used to mimic the entry of real viruses, such as hepatitis C virus [18, 19] , Ebola virus, and Marburg virus [20] , into host cells. This strategy is a powerful tool for studying early events in the life cycle of a virus. Therefore, we used retroviral pseudoviruses bearing the SARS-CoV spike protein to infect ACE2-GFP-expressing HEK293E cells. After a 3-h incubation at 37 \u00b0C, GFP-containing vesicles were detected within the cells (Figure 2A ), while there were few intracellular vesicles when the same cell lines were treated with a control pseudovirus bearing VSV-G protein on the surface ( Figure 2B ). Dual labeling of spike protein and ACE2 also showed colocalization ( Figure 2C ), which indicates that the pseudovirus may be contained in the vesicles. After an additional 10 h incubation, few vesicles were observed ( Figure 2D ) for both treatments. This result was similar to that observed following treatment with spike protein alone. Moreover, after treatment with ammonium chloride, bafilomycin A1, or chloroquine, GFP-containing vesicles were detected, even after a 12-h incubation ( Figure  2E and unpublished data), suggesting that these reagents inhibited receptor recycling. These results were nearly identical to those obtained following spike protein treatment, which indicated that SARS-CoV may enter cells via endocytosis. Although the pseudovirus can express GFP, the green vesicles observed in these cells at this time point resulted from cellular ACE2-GFP rather than from virally expressed GFP, as expression from the viral GFP gene was not observed at 12 h after infection. This notion was verified with ACE2-Myc-expressing HEK293E cells, in which no GFP expression was observed at 12 h postinfection with the pseudovirus (Supplementary information Figure S3 ).",

In mock-treated cells, transferrin appeared to cluster in the perinuclear region, while in the CPZ-treated cells, transferrin uptake was blocked, leaving transferrin at the cell surface ( Figure 3A and 3B). This result confirms the effectiveness of CPZ. We then tested the effect of CPZ on spike-pseudovirus entry using two different methods: confocal microscopy and spectrofluorometer measurement.

In order to quantify the effect of CPZ on viral entry, Vero E6 cells were treated with the indicated amounts of CPZ and were then infected with spike-bearing pseudoviruses.

Seventy-two hours post-transfection, the effects of the siRNA were assayed using western blotting and the cells were infected with pseudoviruses.

Although the expression of clathrin HC was knocked-down in the cells transfected with the specific siRNA compared to cells transfected with control siRNA, the infectivity of the virus was not significantly affected ( Figure 3F) . We further employed a dominant-negative variant of Eps15 to explore the role of clathrin-mediated endocytosis in SARS-CoV entry. Eps15 plays an important role in clathrin-mediated endocytosis, and expression of the dominantnegative Eps15 construct GFP-E\u039495/295 has been reported to inhibit clathrin-mediated endocytosis, while the construct GFP-D3\u03942 can be used as a control [25, 26] . To confirm disruption of the clathrin-dependent endocytic pathway, the transfected cells were incubated with Alexa-594 transferrin. As expected, the E\u039495/295 construct, but not the D3\u03942 construct, successfully inhibited transferrin uptake ( Figure  4A -F). However, we found that SARS-CoV was able to enter cells expressing GFP-E\u039495/295 as efficiently as it entered cells expressing GFP-D3\u03942 ( Figure 4G-L) , demonstrating that expression of the dominant-negative variant Eps15 did not block SARS-CoV entry.

Caveolae are small, flask-shaped invaginations in the plasma membrane composed of high levels of cholesterol and glycosphingolipids as well as the integral membrane protein caveolin [27] . Because cholesterol is a prominent component of lipid rafts, which are involved in caveolae formation, sequestration of cholesterol with the sterol-binding drugs filipin and nystatin impairs caveolae-mediated endocytosis [4] . To determine whether SARS-CoV enters cells through a caveolae-mediated pathway, we treated cells with filipin and nystatin. As a control, the effects of these drugs on caveolae-mediated endocytosis were examined by measuring the uptake of cholera toxin subunit B (CTB), since it is targeted to caveolae and its uptake can be blocked by these kinds of drugs [28, 29] . Data presented in Figure 5A -C indicate that these drugs block CTB uptake, since Alexa-594 CTB clustered at the cell surface following drug treatment, compared to its concentration near the nucleus in mock-treated cells (Supplementary information Figure S4 ). When treated cells were infected with pseudovirus, virus entry was not inhibited by treatment with filipin or nystatin ( Figure 5D and 5F), but was inhibited by another drug, methyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin (M\u03b2CD) (Figure 5E ), an oligosaccharide used to deplete cholesterol from cell membranes. The effects of these drugs on virus entry were measured quantitatively. Treatment of Vero E6 cells with M\u03b2CD was shown to inhibit pseudovirus entry in a dose-dependent manner ( Figure. 5H) , while filipin and nystatin had no inhibitory effect on virus entry ( Figure 5G and 5I) .",

In order to define the role of caveolae-mediated endocytosis in SARS-CoV entry, we used several drugs that affect this pathway, such as nystatin, filipin, and M\u03b2CD. In our experiments, neither nystatin nor filipin inhibited virus entry, while M\u03b2CD was able to block virus entry in a dose-dependent manner, which was in agreement with a previous report by Li et al.

These results, together with the fact that dual immunostaining showed that SARS-CoV and caveolin-1 did not colocalize, suggest that depletion of cholesterol by M\u03b2CD inhibits SARS-CoV entry, not through interfering with caveolae-mediated endocytosis per se but most likely by altering the integrity of membrane lipid microdomains. Therefore, these results suggest that caveolae-mediated endocytosis is not involved in the entry of SARS-CoV.

A wide variety of viruses have been reported to use macropinocytosis to gain entry into host cells, because macropinosomes can be acidified and intersect with endocytic vesicles [4] . The process of macropinocytosis requires actin; therefore, the most commonly used inhibitor of macropinocytosis is cytochalasin D. We found that treatment of Vero E6 cells with cytochalasin D slightly inhibited viral infection (Supplementary information Figure S5 ).

Importantly, there is no direct colocalization of ACE2 and lipid rafts [32] . This scenario is similar to that of the HIV-1 coreceptor CXCR4, which, despite preferential association with the nonraft membrane fraction of cells, requires cholesterol for normal function [38] . This observation can be explained by the complicated conformational changes that occur during virus entry. For example, in the case of HIV-1, after virus binding to CD4, the CD4-HIV-1 complex may either leave the raft compartment in order to associate with CXCR4 outside of rafts or stimulate entry of CXCR4 into rafts. A similar scenario may exist for SARS-CoV. Although ACE2 does not directly localize in rafts, some unknown factors involved in virus entry may localize to lipid rafts. Further detailed experiments are necessary to determine whether host factors other than ACE2 are involved in virus entry, and, if so, whether they localize to lipid rafts and how they interact with ACE2 to facilitate virus entry.",

            "text": "Lipid rafts are sphingolipid-and cholesterol-rich domains of plasma membrane that contain a variety of signaling and transport proteins. Lipid raft signaling has been reported to be important in the pathogenesis of many diseases [39] , so these microdomains of plasma membrane have been pharmacologically targeted to prevent and treat these diseases. SARS-CoV is known to cause acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), the leading cause of death due to SARS-CoV infection, as well as a hemophagocytic syndrome, lymphoid depletion, and skeletal muscle fiber necrosis, which all result from elevated levels of proinflammatory cytokines. Our previous studies showed that ARDS caused by SARS-CoV is mediated by the renin-angiotensin system and decreased levels of ACE2 protein [16] These findings are highly relevant for the development of future therapies directed at SARS-CoV. To date, there are no specific antiviral drugs that have been shown to effectively treat SARS. Characterization of the molecular pathogenesis of SARS-CoV and the evaluation of novel targets has led to the suggestion that entry inhibitors may prove to be valuable for the treatment of this disease [40, 41] . Our findings here provide additional information that can be used for drug design.",

Spike-bearing pseudovirus was detected using anti-spike antibody, followed by incubation with Alexa-568 anti-mouse antibodies.the early endosome to the late endosome, and then to the lysosome, where the internalized cargo is degraded by the acidic environment and various enzymes. Thus, it is possible that endocytic viral entry may lead to nonproductive infection because the viruses are degraded in the lysosome. In our experiments, however, we found that the viral genes were extensively expressed in all cell lines tested. The GFP protein encoded by the pseudovirus vector was first expressed at about 18 h postinfection (Supplementary informationFigure S3). At this time point, virally produced GFP was evenly distributed in the cytoplasm of Vero E6 cells, HEK293E-ACE2-Myc cells, and HEK293E-ACE2-GFP cells (as mentioned above, prior to infection, the majority of the GFP was localized on the cell surface of HEK239E-ACE2-GFP cells, Supplementary informationFigure S1). Therefore, endocytic entry of SARS-CoV results in a productive infection.Recent research has demonstrated that numerous viruses employ the endocytic machinery of the cell to infect cells. The endocytic pathways used include clathrin-mediated endocytosis, caveolae, macropinocytosis, and novel clathrin-and caveolae-independent pathways. Clathrin-medi-www.cell-research.com | Cell Research Hongliang Wang et al. 297 npg ated endocytosis is the most common pathway. Numerous viruses use this pathway to enter cells, including Semliki forest virus (SFV), vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), and Adenoviruses 2 and 5 [3]. Therefore, we first determined whether SARS-CoV enters cells through clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Combined approaches of CPZ-mediated inhibition, clathrin heavy chain knockdown and dominant-negative Eps15 showed that SARS-CoV can infect cells in the absence of clathrinmediated endocytosis.",
