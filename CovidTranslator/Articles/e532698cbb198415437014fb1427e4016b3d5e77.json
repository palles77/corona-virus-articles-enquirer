The aim of this study was to assess the immunogenicity of chimeric RHDV-VLPs as vaccine vectors in pigs. For this purpose, we have generated chimeric VLPs containing a well-known T epitope of 3A protein of foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV). Firstly, RHDV-VLPs were able to activate immature porcine bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (poBMDCs) in vitro. Secondly, pigs were inoculated twice in a two-week interval with chimeric RHDV-VLPs at different doses intranasally or intramuscularly. One intramuscularly treated group was also inoculated with adjuvant Montanide TM ISA 206 at the same time. Specific IgG and IgA antibodies against RHDV-VLPs were induced and such levels were higher in the adjuvanted group compared with other groups. Interestingly, anti-RHDV-VLP IgA responses were higher in groups inoculated intramuscularly than those that received the VLPs intranasally. Two weeks after the last immunisation, specific IFN-\u2425-secreting cells against 3A epitope and against RHDV-VLPs were detected in PBMCs by ELISPOT. The adjuvanted group exhibited the highest IFN-\u2425-secreting cell numbers and lymphoproliferative specific T cell responses against 3A epitope and RHDV-VLP. This is the first immunological report on the potential use of chimeric RHDV-VLPs as antigen carriers in pigs.",

Indeed, VLPs are robust protein cages in the nanometer range exhibiting well-defined geometry and remarkable uniformity [1] that mimic the overall structure of the native virions. VLPs are appealing as vaccine candidates for their inherent properties of stability and non-replicative form, and have advantages in terms of immunogenicity and safety over previous approaches [2] . In fact, lacking the genome of the virus avoids any of the risks associated with virus replication, reversion, recombination or re-assortment [3] . The strong immunogenicity of VLPs, the high productivity of expression systems, their ability In addition of being used to induce immune responses against the particle itself, animal VLPs have been successfully used as vaccine vectors for inducing immune responses against inserted foreign immunogenic epitopes (chimeric VLPs) [18] [19] [20] or for drug delivery [1] .",

These VLPs are formed from 180 copies of the single coat protein (VP60), assembled into an icosahedral capsid [24] . Recently, we have shown that chimeric RHDV-VLPs harbouring a model cytotoxic T-cell epitope at the N-terminal end of the VP60 monomers were able to stimulate a powerful specific cytotoxic response in vivo and to protect mice from viral challenge [18] . Moreover, a tumour antigen chemically coupled to RHDV-VLPs has been shown to delay or prevent the development of tumours [19] . The well-documented immunogenicity of VLPs is probably due to their interaction with dendritic cells (DCs) [25] . RHDV-VLPs enter both human and murine DCs by clathrin-dependent pinocytosis and phagocytosis. Win et al. found no evidence for receptor-mediated acquisition by DCs from either species, which may be related to the fact that RHDV does not naturally infect mice or humans [26] .",

FMDV shows a high genetic and antigenic variability, reflected in the seven serotypes and the numerous variants described to date [28] . Several T-cell epitopes frequently recognised by natural host lymphocytes have been identified in FMDV proteins. One of these T-cell epitopes, located in residues 21-35 of FMDV NS protein 3A, is efficiently recognised by lymphocytes from infected pigs. This epitope was capable to provide adequate T-helper co-operation when synthesised juxtaposed to the B-cell antigenic site VP1, inducing significant levels of serotype-specific anti-FMDV activity in vitro [29] . Its amino acid sequence is conserved among FMDV types A, O, and C, showing limited variation among isolates from the seven FMDV serotypes [30] . Cubillos et al. have shown the successful use of a dendrimeric peptide, using such 3A and VP1 epitopes, to protect pigs against a challenge with FMDV [31] .",

As a first approach we generated chimeric RHDV-VLPs incorporating a well defined T-helper epitope [29] from FMDV 3A protein (RHDV-3A-VLPs), and analysed their ability to induce specific immune responses in pigs. The foreign epitope was inserted at the N-terminus of VP60 protein, which is predicted to be buried in the internal face of the VLPs. Firstly, the immunogenic potential of RHDV-VLPs in immature porcine bone marrow derived dendritic cells (poBMDCs) in vitro was studied. RHDV-VLPs were able to stimulate poBMDCs in vitro. Then, fifty conventional pigs were immunised with two doses at two week interval with chimeric RHDV-3A-VLPs using different routes. Acute phase proteins were also analysed in chimeric RHDV-3A-VLP immunised pigs since their responses comprise innate reactions [32] . Moreover, specific humoral and cellular responses against the inserted epitope and the vector were specifically induced. This is the first immunological report on the potential use of RHDV-VLPs as vectors for antigen presentation in pigs in which specific immunity against a foreign epitope was induced.",

Taking into account that 3A sequence is an immunodominant T cell epitope, it was conceivable to assume that a good vaccine vector carrying such epitope would induce specific 3A IFN-\u2425-secreting cells. Indeed, after the last inoculation of animals with RHDV-3A-VLPs, specific IFN-\u2425-secreting cells against 3A but also against the vector RHDV-VLP were detected in PBMCs of pigs by ELISPOT (Fig. 4A) . Animals in group C showed the highest production of IFN-\u2425-secreting cells against RHDV-VLP and 3A compared with the other groups. However, no statistical difference was found between the different adjuvanted doses of RHDV-3A-VLPs (p value > 0.1) (Fig. 4A) . Animals in group C showed a high statistical difference with animals from group B (p value = 0.01), whereas only a strong tendency was found between animals from group C1 or C2 and group D (0.09 < p value < 0.06). An interesting finding was that RHDV-3A-VLP immunisation was able to induce specific RHDV-VLP IFN-\u2425-secreting cells also after the first inoculation in all the groups, mainly in animals from group C1 (Suppl. Fig. 2) . Likewise, specific 3A IFN-\u2425-secreting cells were detected at day 14 in all the groups, mainly in animals from group C1 (Suppl. Fig. 2 ). Responses at day 14 were lower that at day 28 and no statistical differences were found between the subgroups receiving different doses of RHDV-3A-VLPs (p value > 0.1).

In the mice system as well as in the swine system, there was a direct relationship between activation of BMDC in vitro and induction of significant specific responses in vivo. Therefore, human monocyte derived DCs (huMoDCs) were tested in vitro as a surrogate model for possible human use. At day six of culture, the un-stimulated huMoDCs phenotype (data not shown) was consistent with previous observations [38] . After stimulation with RHDV-VLPs, huMoDCs exhibited a similar pattern of activation than poBMDCs with up-regulation of MHC-II and CD86 (Fig. 6) . The activation level was dose-dependent (data not shown). In this system, LPS stimulation of surface markers was higher or equal to RHDV-VLP stimulation (Fig. 6 ). No differences were found when assessing all the other surface markers indicated (data not shown). No increased expression of maturation markers could be detected in un-stimulated DCs (data not shown). However, RHDV-VLPs did not induce huMoDCs to secrete IL-10, IL-12, TNF-\u2423 and IFN-\u2423 or the production did not result in appreciable levels (data not shown).",

New subunit vaccines are getting a foothold in veterinary vaccinology and VLPs are one of the most appealing approaches, opening up new frontiers in animal vaccines. VLPs are protein shells that mimic the overall structure of the virions and are often antigenically indistinguishable from native virus, maintaining a non-replicative form. In addition to being effective vaccines against the corresponding virus from which they are derived, VLPs can also be used as carrier molecules to present foreign chosen epitopes, DNA, drugs and other small molecules to the immune system. VLPs derived from RHDV have shown to be a suitable vector for the presentation of foreign T-cell epitopes in mice [18, 19] , but this knowledge has not been translated into applications suitable for relevant animal health diseases affecting livestock animals.",

The kinetics of the induction of cell surface markers was similar for LPS and RHDV-VLPs, because it required 24 h for the activated phenotype to be displayed. Moreover, RHDV-VLPs induced the release of IL-6 and TNF-( by poBMDCs in culture supernatant. In our in vitro porcine system, the induction of surface markers and cytokine secretion in DC was dose-dependent. Our results confirmed previous studies performed in mice and humans with other VLPs. Lenz et al. have shown that human papillomavirus VLPs have the ability to stimulate immature murine BMDCs with comparable results [45] . Likewise, human DCs pulsed with rodent polyomavirus VLPs were maturated by up-regulation of CD86, MHC-I and MHC-II and were found to secrete IL-12 [46] . The fact that all these VLPs, including RHDV-VLPs, induce the production of TNF-\u2423 and IL-6, suggests that the interaction between RHDV-VLPs and DCs activates through the NF-B transcription factor pathway, which stimulates both cytokines [47] . To exclude any possible interference of contaminants (e.g. LPS) in our VLPs preparations, porcine DC cultures were maintained in conditioned medium with Polymixin B, an antibiotic which will attach to any traces of LPS in the medium. In fact, when Polymixin B was not removed from the culture, addition of 1 g/ml LPS in the medium as positive control did not activate DC in vitro (data not shown). This conditioned medium was maintained during the DC cultures, avoiding any interference with possible minor concentrations of LPS. Furthermore, several in vitro experiments were performed including a mock VLP preparation (prepared from insect cells infected with wild type baculovirus). The VLPs used for comparison were RHDV-VLP-2 and RHDV-VLP-306, used in Crisci et al. [18] . When murine bone marrow derived-DC were incubated with different stimuli overnight, mock VLP showed the lowest level of TNF-\u2423 production, comparable with TNF-\u2423 production of PBS-V (the dilution buffer of the VLP samples) and un-stimulated DC (data not shown).",

Acute phase proteins were first determined to evaluate an unspecific reaction to the immunisation. Our results show that VLP immunisation did not alter Hp serum concentration, whereas PTX3 induction was present only at early stage of immunisation. Hp is released rapidly by liver during the course of innate reaction [32] , whereas PTX3 is produced locally mainly in DCs [48] . These results indicated that in our experimental system the sanitary condition, stress status and housing of pigs did not influence Hp concentration, as shown in another study in pig [32] ; in the same way, the immunisation did not alter Hp concentration during the study. On the contrary, PTX3 concentration in serum increased at early stages of immunisation, mainly in the intramuscularly inoculated group, when compared with intranasal group. This effect could be due to the immunogenicity of RHDV-VLPs that induce PTX3 production in porcine BMDCs (Crisci et al., submitted for publication) and/or to the fact that in our system the intramuscular injection seems to be more effective in the stimulation of immune responses.",

            "text": "Taking into consideration humoral responses, higher increases in antibody levels against RHDV were induced in groups containing adjuvant after the second immunisation. Only adjuvantimmunised animals were able to elicit anti-FMDV antibodies two weeks after the second immunisation and the response to the carrier were higher than to the 3A epitope. These results were not unexpected since the 3A protein-derived epitope is mainly a T helper epitope and the insertion site on the VLPs, predicted to be buried, might not be the optimal location to enhance a humoral response. Even though, presence of adjuvant seemed to enhance the capacity to induce anti-FMDV antibodies. When different routes of delivery were tested, intranasal versus intramuscular immunisation, different responses were also obtained. The parenteral injection of chimeric VLPs was more effective than the mucosal administration for eliciting specific antibody responses; indeed, higher anti-RHDV-VLP IgA responses in saliva were observed in groups inoculated intramuscularly. Taking into consideration the kinetic analysis of antibody induction by different VLP doses, it is noteworthy that the time for reaching the highest antibody levels was more dependent on the presence of adjuvant rather than VLPs dosage. The lowest dose of VLPs was able to induce in saliva similar responses to the one exhibited by animals in the adjuvant-immunised group at day 28. However, considering the general picture, our results provide evidence that immune responses induced after homologous prime-boost immunisation with chimeric RHDV-VLPs are more dependent on presence or absence of adjuvant than on the VLP-dosage in pig. The addition of an adjuvant plays an important role by enhancing immune responses. This strategy has shown to be effective in high humoral responses induction. However, further studies are required to get insight into the protective capacity of these responses, for example including a FMDV neutralising B-cell epitope as the one successfully used in dendrimeric peptides [31] . Adjuvants stimulate immune system, but can lead to unintended stimulations and different adverse reactions, which can result in unwanted side effects such as fever and granulomatous inflammation. The acceptability of the side effects is determined by the species in which the adjuvant is applied. The decision to use water in oil in water double emulsion Montanide TM ISA 206 adjuvant was based on the immunogenicity results previously shown in pigs [49, 50] . Interestingly, no macroscopic lesions were observed after immunisations and animals maintained the healthy status during all the experimental period. The histopathological studies show a local recall of immune cells detected at the injection site, mainly with the higher dose of chimeric RHDV-VLPs. Thus, this local reaction may indicate that the adjuvant might promote immune response by recruiting professional APC to the immunisation site, by increasing the delivery of antigen to APCs or by improving the uptake of the antigen by DCs, enhancing the efficacy of immune responses. Thus, our chimeric VLPs could be considered another important candidate to add to the list of FMDV-VLP-based vaccines, since 3A epitope is shared by different serotypes.",

Driving the immune response towards Th1 responses may be an attractive feature of RHDV-VLPs as immunity associated with a Th1 response is thought to be essential for the control of several pathogens, particularly viral infections. IFN-\u2425 stimulates MHC expression in antigen-presenting cells and efficiently inhibits FMDV replication [51] . Chimeric RHDV-VLP immunised animals were able to elicit IFN-\u2425 producing cells against the vector and the FMDV epitope, mainly in the adjuvanted group, indicating that Montanide has an adjuvanting effect for the establishment of an effector T cell response in the anti-viral immunity. For the development of a potent immunisation, a prolonged immune response is required to provide protection against a subsequent infection. Hence, the potential of chimeric RHDV-VLPs immunisation to sustain a memory T cell response was investigated after two weeks. Results show that immunisation with chimeric RHDV-VLPs was sufficient to induce a specific cellular memory response. Although induction of neutralising antibodies is considered to be the most important immune correlate with FMDV protection, specific T cells are also induced in convalescent and conventionally vaccinated animals and are relevant for protection [52] . A previous study with dendrimeric epitope based on 3A peptide and a relevant B-epitope (FMDV site-A) has shown that high stimulation indexes (SI) were present in protected animals against FMDV challenge [31] . Thus, it is conceivable to speculate that chimeric VLP-immunised animals exhibiting similar SI to 3A peptide in Cubillos et al. might exert some degree of response against FMDV infection. An additional study has to be performed to get insight the efficacy of RHDV-3A-VLP immunisation, since the aim of this study was only to investigate the immunogenicity of the vector in pigs.",

If we consider dendrimeric peptide-based vaccination, previous studies have shown similar variability in the cellular response than the one shown in our study [31, 50] .

Taken together, our results open the way for generating chimeric RHDV-VLPs designed for co-delivering foreign T and B-cell epitopes (inserted at the N-terminal and at predicted exposed loop of VP60 protein, respectively), which might eventually be used to immunise pigs using the experimental conditions established in this study.",

Therefore, if RHDV-VLPs were able to stimulate human DCs it might be reasonable to speculate that they might be a good vaccine vector for human diseases as well. Indeed, RHDV-VLPs were able to stimulate immature human monocyte derived DCs in vitro, paving the way for further uses of RHDV-VLPs as vaccine vectors in humans.",
