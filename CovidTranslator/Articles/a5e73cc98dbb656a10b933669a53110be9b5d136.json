The inflammasome has evolved for this purpose and is an important surveillance system that, when triggered, fights infection and eliminates pathogens. However, there is growing evidence that the inflammasome also plays a role in the pathogenesis of acute and chronic respiratory disease. Inflammasomes contribute to both the clearance of the pathogen as well as its pathogenesis -depending on the amount of inflammation triggered. How respiratory viruses trigger inflammasome activation remains unclear. Emerging evidence shows that ion flux is responsible for triggering inflammasome activation in the lung, causing lung pathology and disease exacerbations. Viroporins, encoded by all common respiratory viruses, are responsible for the changes in intracellular ion homeostasis that modulate inflammasome activation. This is a novel mechanism by which respiratory viral infection activates inflammasomes, and identifies sensing of disturbances in intracellular ionic concentrations as a novel pathogenrecognition pathway in the lung.",

            "text": "The cells and organs of the human body require a constant stream of oxygen to stay alive. The respiratory system provides oxygen to the cells of the body while removing CO 2 , a waste product that can be lethal if allowed to accumulate. Similarly to other organs, such as the skin and gastrointestinal tract, the respiratory tract is constantly exposed to microbes and particles by inhalation [1, 2] . Viral infections of the respiratory tract are the most common triggers of bronchiolitis, wheezing and acute asthma exacerbations. These viruses have evolved to colonize and replicate successfully on or within the lung epithelial cells. Previous studies have shown that respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human rhinovirus (HRV), human influenza A virus (IAV), and human parainfluenza virus (HPIV) are detected in the acute exacerbation of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), leading to rapid decline in lung function and increased mortality [3] [4] [5] . However, the mechanisms by which these respiratory viruses induce exacerbations of chronic respiratory disease are incompletely understood but are likely related to inflammatory mediators including interleukins and cytokines produced by the host innate immune response.",

This is achieved through an array of PRRs that reside on the cell surface or in specific subcellular compartments, and PRRs can bind pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). PRRs also recognize self-molecules (non-microbial ligands) that are released after cell damage or death, known as danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) [17] . PRR activation rapidly targets invading pathogens and infected host cells for elimination through immune cell recruitment and by the induction of transcriptional and post-translational mechanisms that lead to the production of inflammatory cytokines. Although the activation of PRRs leads to host defense pathways in infectious diseases, it can also contribute to tissue injury by excessive release of cytokines [18] .",

By virtue of the potentially destructive proinflammatory effects of uncontrolled IL-1b release, its production is tightly regulated. Pro-IL-1b must be processed by caspase-1 into its bioactive form IL-1b before its release from cells [19] . Although the signaling pathways and inflammatory outcomes of IL-1b activation have long been known, the mechanisms by which immune cells produce this cytokine have come to light only in the past decade with the discovery of inflammasomes, a key component of the innate immune response of the host. Inflammasomes are cytoplasmic innate immune sensors that act as multicomplex molecular platforms and control the activation of the proteolytic enzyme caspase-1 [20, 21] . Caspase-1 in turn regulates maturation of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-1b and IL-18 as well as the rapid inflammatory form of cell death, termed 'pyroptosis', that is triggered by diverse ligands and by various stress signals associated with microbial infection or damaged self [22] . Inflammasomes contain a member of the Nod-like receptor (NLR) family and the adaptor ASC (apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD), which is common to most inflammasome complexes [23] . ASC operates as a molecular platform for protein-protein interactions during inflammasome activation by oligomerizing into large disc-like structures, although ASC-independent complexes also form in particular cases [24] .",

Inflammasomes can sense falls in cytosolic potassium levels [29] [30] [31] , and membrane perturbations causing potassium efflux by microbial toxins such as aerolysin and nigericin have been shown to activate the NLRP3 inflammasome [32] . Extracellular ATP serves as a danger signal that alerts the immune system by binding to the purinoceptor P2X7 and inducing NLRP3 recruitment [33] . The release of lysosomal contents caused by lysosome disruption [34, 35] or the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) [36] has also been shown to trigger NLRP3 activation. However, intracellular ion fluxes seem to be the most important danger signal and amplifier of inflammasome recruitment. Intracellular Ca 2+ signaling has been shown to be important in NLRP3 activation in response to a wide range of stimuli [15, 37] including UV irradiation [38] , sublytic membrane attack complex formation [39] (which generates pores that allow the influx of Ca 2+ ions and increases the cytosolic Ca 2+ concentration), as well as infections by viruses such as HRVs -which infect the cells and increase intracellular Ca 2+ by generating membraneintegral pores, thus reducing the Ca 2+ content of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi complex [40] .",

Thus a common hallmark used by viruses during infection is alterations in cellular ion homeostasis [41] . The vast majority of RNA animal viruses encode cytotoxic poreforming proteins known as viroporins, which modify membrane function at late stages of infection and facilitate budding of virions from infected cells. The existence of viroporins was initially suggested by observing that virus-infected cells became permeable to ions and small molecules. Viroporins are small, non-glycosylated, highly hydrophobic viral polypeptides which interact with cell membranes and increase their permeability to ions and other low molecular weight compounds [42, 43] . A current hypothesis suggests that viroporins insert into the host cell membrane and subsequently oligomerize to form an aqueous channel. Usually, the ion channels formed by viroporins conduct at least one of the physiological relevant ions such as Na + , K + , Ca 2+ , Cl \u00c0 , and H + [44] .",

Another important aspect of viroporin function is that several viroporins can trigger programmed host cell death. Viral ion channels can participate in apoptotic cell death because perturbation of ion homeostasis is a common hallmark of apoptosis, giving rise to depolarization of the plasma membrane associated with intracellular cation overload and cell volume decreases as a result of anion and H 2 O efflux [47] . Coronavirus viroporin E (envelope) protein has been described as an inducer of apoptosis [48] . In addition, the picornavirus 2B protein results in increase in the intracellular Ca 2+ concentration which can induce apoptosis [49] , thus playing a key role in host cell death.",

            "text": "Overall, it seems that viroporins have a central role in promoting viral pathogenesis. They inflict several cytopathic effects during the viral life cycle. Most importantly, they alter the plasma membrane potential. They dissipate the ionic gradient across the membrane by conducting the flux of different ions (e.g., Na + and K + ) across the membrane, leading to depolarization and helping the budding process of the virus. They alter Ca 2+ homeostasis, induce intracellular protein remodeling, and can also dissipate the proton gradient in the Golgi and trans-Golgi network. Although these cytopathic effects are advantageous for the viral life cycle, promoting entry, assembly, and release of virus particles, the host innate immune system seems to have also developed 'sensors' to detect such ion dysregulation and trigger activation signals to fight off the infection. Inflammasomes seem to have a role in recognizing the ion dysregulation that is caused intracellularly by viroporins. They are able to sense the ion flux and trigger inflammasome activation and subsequently IL-1b and IL-18 production as a mechanism of defense against the virus. Interestingly, it is becoming apparent that most respiratory viruses trigger inflammasome activation and overzealous IL-1b and IL-18 production via viroporins. It is emerging that viroporins are central in the cytopathic effect of most of the common respiratory viruses, causing airway inflammation and exacerbations of airway disease. In the following sections we focus on the most common respiratory viruses and how they trigger inflammasome activation via ion flux triggered by viroporins.",

NLRP3 has been shown to be a crucial component in the host response to IAV through sensing of viral RNA, and its deficiency in mice resulted in very high rates of lethality after AV infection [57] . However, in some patients with pre-existing airway inflammation, the influx of cytokines caused by the viral infection could lead to additive and synergic effects and exacerbations of airway disease. The activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome and production of IL-1b usually requires two signals [59] . In the case of IAV, viral RNA is a trigger [57] and TLR7 signaling is required for the transcription of pro-IL-1b, whereas the IAV M2 channel was shown to trigger signal 2 for the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome [60] . The M2 channel is a viroporin involved in viral genome replication and assembly, as well as virus particle entry into and release from infected cells. M2 also allows the entry of protons into virions, promoting virus uncoating in endosomes [61] . In addition to ion channel activity, it also regulates the pH balance between the acid lumen of the trans-Golgi complex (TGN) and the cytoplasm in influenza-infected cells. M2 reduces the acidification of intracellular vesicles and even cellular organelles [62] . NLRP3 monitors changes in the concentration or the subcellular localization of endogenous danger signals. Therefore, the proton specificity of the M2 channel creates imbalances in the concentration of H + , in addition to disturbances in the concentrations of Na + and K + cations, and acts as a trigger for inflammasome activation.",

HRV is responsible for up to 80% of acute asthma attacks and is also implicated in the majority of COPD exacerbations [63] [64] [65] . Furthermore, a pivotal study by Johnston et al. in children aged 9-11 years old with history of asthma found that 80-85% of asthma exacerbations were due to HRV [64] . The severity of the symptoms produced is not due to the direct virus-induced damage to the epithelium. Instead, rhinovirus infection induces inflammation and release of cytokines from airway epithelial cells, thereby attracting inflammatory cells to the airways. In patients with preexisting airway inflammation, the influx of cytokines and inflammatory cells caused by HRV infection would lead to additive or synergistic effects and exacerbations of airway disease. Repeated asthma exacerbations caused by HRV infection can lead to airway remodeling which cannot be reversed by current pharmacological treatment, and consequently leads to decline in lung function. Thus, it is crucial to understand rhinovirus-induced airway inflammation in asthma and infectious exacerbations.",

Both of these signals lead to caspase-1 activation and subsequent IL-1b secretion during infection [78] .

Patients show highly elevated levels of interferon-g (IFN-g), IL-6, monocyte chemotactic protein 1 (MCP1), and IFN-g-inducible protein 10 (IP-10), as well as significantly higher IL-18 and IL-1b levels not only in the blood but also in both lung and lymphoid tissues, indicating increased inflammasome activation in patients who died versus those who survived [84, 85] . Moreover, pediatric SARS patients show markedly elevated circulating IL-1b levels, which suggests selective activation of the caspase-1-dependent pathway. Other key proinflammatory cytokines, IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor a (TNF-a), showed only mildly elevated levels at the initial phase of the illness [86] . These findings link the excessive inflammation seen in patients with inflammasome activation. However, the mechanisms of inflammasome activation in SARS have not yet been revealed. The virus encodes an E protein, a small transmembrane protein of 76-109 amino acids in length. This protein is characterized as a viroporin because it selfassociates to generate an oligomeric structure that forms an ion-conductive pore in planar lipid bilayers. Where the bilayer membrane was permeabilized, the channel showed symmetric ion transport properties either for positive or negative applied voltages, and its conductance was not regulated by voltage. Interestingly, when E protein was reconstituted in negatively charged lipid bilayers, the ion channel became slightly more selective to cations than to anions [87] . SARS-CoV also encodes 3a, a 31 kDa protein which forms an ion channel and modulates virus release; however, this protein is not essential for virus viability [45] . It is possible that, as previously seen with other respiratory viruses, inflammasomes sense the cation imbalances caused by the viroporin E and 3a in SARsinfected cells and become activated.",

            "text": "Emerging evidence is pointing towards the fact that ion flux is responsible for triggering inflammasome activation, and the subsequent IL-1b production in the lung causes lung pathology and disease exacerbations. Viroporins, which are encoded by all the common respiratory viruses, are responsible for the changes in the intracellular ion homeostasis that modulate inflammasome activation and cell death in the lung. Generalized permeabilization both of intracellular compartments (such as the Golgi and trans-Golgi network) and of the plasma membrane by viroporins provokes this ionic imbalance, leading to disruption of the permeability barrier. Respiratory viruses encode several viroporins which are able to conduct the flux of different ions (such as Na + and K + ) across the membrane (Figure 1 ), reducing the transmembrane potential, and this essentially affects: (i) the concentration of ions inside and outside the cells, (ii) the permeability of the membrane to these ions, and (iii) the activity of electrogenic pumps (for example the Na + /K + /ATPase and Ca 2+ transport pumps). Some of the viroporins are also able to target intracellular compartments: one example is HRV 2B which is endowed with a potent capacity to cause profound and rapid alterations in Ca 2+ release from intracellular stores (such as the ER and Golgi) and subsequent Ca 2+ influx to the cytoplasm. Changes in the ion levels intracellularly (either an increase or decrease of ion concentration) in turn trigger inflammasome activation and IL-1b production. Inflammasome activation is one of the beneficial and non-specific defense mechanisms of the body against tissue damage and viral stimuli. However, repeated or persistent infections by these respiratory viruses trigger this vicious cycle which leads to damage in the lung. A question that arises is -why does the host retain such a destructive mechanism of activation and cytokine production? The answer is that the host does not have a choice. It senses the 'invasion' and tries to clear the infection. We have reached this situation because the coexistence of viruses and their hosts imposes an evolutionary pressure on both the virus and the host immune system. Viruses need to escape killing by the host immune system, and therefore employ viroporins to enhance attachment and entry into host cells and organs and promote efficient replication, but by contrast the host must retain a highly sensitive surveillance system to combat the infection.",
