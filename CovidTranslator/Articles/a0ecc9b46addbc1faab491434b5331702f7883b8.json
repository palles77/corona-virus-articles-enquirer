A study with 425 patients indicated that the median age was 59 72 years (range, 15 to 89) and reported different case distributions in four age groups: 0 -14, 15 -44, 45 73 -64, and \uf0b3 65 years [2] . However, there is not enough epidemiological evidence to classify the age 74 groups in transmission. In this study, we added another age classification scenario according to our 75 previous research on influenza that people were divided into five age groups: 0 -5, 6 -14, 15 -24, 25 76 -59, and \uf0b3 60 years [4] , to better understand the transmissibility of the disease for different ages.",
