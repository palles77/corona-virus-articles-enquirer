(A) TAMRA-labeled diUb-PA probes were incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 30 minutes with EL4 cell lysate at a concentration of 5 \u00b5M. At indicated time points, samples were taken and collected for SDS-PAGE gel analysis. Time points are indicated in seconds (s) or in minutes (m). Gels were scanned at Ex/Em of 550/590 nm. USP14 is indicated by an arrow. (B) EL4 lysates were incubated at 30 \u00b0C for 40 minutes with buffer (-), 3.4 \u00b5M TAMRA-monoUb (m) or indicated TAMRA-diUb probes. Depending on type of gel and running buffer, for some diUb probes bands appear to run at a different molecular size or a double band is observed (*). USP14 bound to monoUb-PA (m) or diUb-PA (d) is indicated. f-Ub (2) -PA indicates the unbound TAMRA-labeled (di)Ub probe. Figure 4A . Indicated are the positions of the unmodified OTUD2 enzyme and the TAMRA-labeled diUb-OTUD2 adducts (d-OTUD2), which are seen for some linkages as a band running slightly below bovine serum albumin (BSA), which was present in the assay mix. Especially for the K11linked diUb-PA probe (lanes 9-12), the disappearance of the OTUD2 band is observed, in accordance with it reacting with the diUb-PA probe. (B) Full SYPRO Orange stained gels of Figure 5D . 0.1 \u00b5M of full-length (FL) OTUD2 or isolated OTU domains of WT OTUD2 (aa 147-314), an S1 site mutant (aa 147-314, AI200-201DD), an S2 site mutant (aa 147-314, I292Q, V295Q), and the catalytically inactive C160A mutant constructs were incubated with TAMRAlabeled K11-linked diUb-PA probes for 60 min at 1 \u00b5M. At indicated time points, samples were taken for analysis. OTUD2 or OTUD2 OTU, coupled to TAMRA-labeled diUb-PA (d) is indicated. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and fluorescence scanning at Ex/Em of 480/590 nm. f-Ub 2 -PA indicates the unbound diUb probe fluorescently labeled with TAMRA. (C) Bands of full-length OTUD2 (FL) or OTUD2 OTU modified with TAMRA-labeled K11linked diUb-PA probe in Figure 5D were quantified using Studio Image Lite and the data was fitted using one phase association curve. Quantification is displayed as arbitrary fluorescence units (AFU). Figure 6D , but zoomed in to show the curves for monoUb-AMC and K27-linked diUb-AMC. Scheme S1, related to Figure 2 . Synthetic Scheme of TAMRA-diUb-PA probes 3. Solid Phase Peptide Synthesis (SPPS) of Ub 75 is followed by HFIP mediated release from the solid support, leaving all side-chain protecting groups (PG) in place. The C-terminal carboxylic acid is activated using PyBOP/DiPEA and propargylamine is coupled. Global deprotection is effected by trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) treatment resulting in TAMRA-Ub-PA 1. Similarly, HFIP-mediated release from the solid support, liberates azido-ornithine Ub74. C-terminal activation followed by coupling to methyl-3-(glycylthio)-propionate and concomitant TFA deprotection yields azido-ornithine thioesters 2. Subsequent Cu(I)AAC of alkyne 1 and azide 2 results in the intermediate diUb-thioester, that is treated with propargylamine to yield final diUb-PA probes 3. Figure 2 .

After SPPS synthesis an aliquot of resin was treated with TFA cleavage cocktail (90% TFA, 5% H 2 O, 2.5% triisopropylsilane, 2,5% phenol) and product was precipitated in cold diethylether:pentane (3:1). The identity was confirmed by LC-MS analysis. The N-terminal Fmoc-group was then removed from the resin bound polypeptide by treatment with 20% piperidine in N-Methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) (3 x 10 mL, 10 minutes). The protected peptide was then released from the resin by incubation for 30 minutes with hexafluoroisopropanol:DCM mixture (1:4, v/v) to afford a globally protected Ub 1-75 polypeptide. After evaporation of the solvent the solid was coevaporated with dichloroethane (DCE) three times to remove traces of hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP) which may lead to undesired HFIP ester formation in the following step. The peptide (25 \u00b5mol) was dissolved in DCM (1 mL/ 5 \u00b5mol), and 5 eq. PyBOP, 5 eq. triethylamine and 10 eq. propargylamine were reacted for 16 hours. The reaction mixture was concentrated and excess propargylamine was removed by co-evaporation with DCM and toluene followed by dissolution of the protected Ub-PA in DCM and extraction with 1M KHSO 4 (2 times) and sat. aq. NaCl before drying the organic layer using sodium sulfate and concentration. The resulting off-white solid was further dried overnight under high vacuum. Subsequently, 5 eq. of 5-Carboxy-Tetramethylrhodamine (TMR) was pre-activated in anhydrous DMF by the addition of 5 eq. PyBOP and 5 eq. triethylamine for 5 minutes prior to the addition of protected Ub-propargyl to the reaction mixture. After reaction for 16 hours, the reaction mixture was concentrated and the deep purple TMR-Ub 1-75 -PA was deprotected using TFA cleavage mixture for 2.5 hours. The crude polypeptide was collected after precipitation from cold diethyl ether/pentane (3:1), centrifugation (1000 g, 5 minutes) and washing 3 times with cold diethyl ether and further purified as described in the 'General Purification Procedure' above.",

After solid phase synthesis and release from the resin using HFIP/DCM (1:4, v/v) the solid (25 \u03bcmol) was dissolved in 6 mL of chloroform and cooled to -10 \u00b0C while stirring. Trifluoroethanol (2 mL) was added which resulted in a milky solution. These conditions were selected in order to prevent epimerization of Arg74 during the subsequent coupling protocol as reported by Sakakibara (Sakakibara, 1995) . To this suspension 3 eq. of methyl-3-(glycylthio)proanoate, 3 eq. EDC and 3 eq. HOBt were added.
