            "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (SARS-CoV) caused a severe outbreak in several regions of the world in 2003. The SARS-CoV genome is predicted to contain 14 functional open reading frames (ORFs). The first ORF (1a and 1b) encodes a large polyprotein that is cleaved into nonstructural proteins (nsp). The other ORFs encode for four structural proteins (spike, membrane, nucleocapsid and envelope) as well as eight SARS-CoV-specific accessory proteins (3a, 3b, 6, 7a, 7b, 8a, 8b and 9b). In this report we have cloned the predicted nsp8 gene and the ORF6 gene of the SARS-CoV and studied their abilities to interact with each other. We expressed the two proteins as fusion proteins in the yeast two-hybrid system to demonstrate protein-protein interactions and tested the same using a yeast genetic cross. Further the strength of the interaction was measured by challenging growth of the positive interaction clones on increasing gradients of 2-amino trizole. The interaction was then verified by expressing both proteins separately in-vitro in a coupled-transcription translation system and by coimmunoprecipitation in mammalian cells. Finally, colocalization experiments were performed in SARS-CoV infected Vero E6 mammalian cells to confirm the nsp8-ORF6 interaction. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of the interaction between a SARS-CoV accessory protein and nsp8 and our findings suggest that ORF6 protein may play a role in virus replication.",

            "text": "Like other known coronaviruses, SARS-CoV is an enveloped, plus-strand RNA virus that features the largest RNA genomes currently known. The SARS viral genome comprises approximately 30,000 nucleotides, which are organized into 14 functional open reading frames (ORFs) Thiel et al., 2003) . Analysis of the nucleotide sequence of this novel coronavirus revealed a similar pattern of gene organization typical of coronaviruses (Marra et al., 2003; Rota et al., 2003) . Two large, 5\u2032-terminal overlapping ORFs, 1a and 1b of the replicase gene encode two polyproteins, pp1a and pp1ab ( Fig. 1 ) Thiel et al., 2003) . Like other coronaviruses, the nascent SARS-CoV replicase polyproteins are processed by virus-encoded proteinases, and in this case, two proteinases have been identified: a 3C-like proteinase (3CLpro) and a papain-like proteinase (PLP) (Denison et al., 1992; Ziebuhr, 2004) . The processed end products of pp1a are designated nonstructural proteins (nsp) 1 to nsp11 and those of pp1ab are designated nsp1 to nsp16. Cleavage by the viral main protease, 3CL pro results in generating the nsp8 protein which is currently of undesignated function. The nsp8 protein has been shown to associate with several other nsps and to colocalize with these nsps in cytoplasmic complexes that are important for viral RNA synthesis (Prentice et al., 2004a (Prentice et al., , 2004b Sutton et al., 2004; Zhai et al., 2005) . The +RNA coronavirus usually encode a non-structural protein (nsp12 for SARS-CoV) that includes an RdRp domain, conserved in all RNA viruses. The SARS-CoV uniquely encodes a second RdRp residing in nsp8, responsible for initiation of the synthesis of complementary oligonucleotides smaller than 6 residues long, at relatively low fidelity. These nsp8 RdRp produced primers are postulated to be utilized by the primer-dependent nsp12 RdRp for replication (Imbert et al., 2006) .",

The ORF3a protein has been studied to some details and has been shown to be expressed in infected cells (Tan et al., 2004c; Yu et al., 2004; Zeng et al., 2004) . ORF3a protein has been shown to bind the spike protein (Zeng et al., 2004; Tan et al., 2004c) and recent work demonstrated that it is a novel structural protein (Ito et al., 2005) . The ORF7a protein was also detected in infected cells and has been found to localize in the ER-Golgi intermediate compartments where coronaviruses are known to assemble (Fielding et al., 2004; Nelson et al., 2005) . In addition, ORF3a, ORF3b and ORF7a proteins have been shown to induce apoptosis (Tan et al., 2004a; Law et al., 2005; Yuan et al., 2005) . Two recent papers on the ORF6 accessory protein also demonstrated its expression during infection and have showed that it may be important for viral pathogenesis (Geng et al., 2005; Pewe et al., 2005) . Most recently the ORF6 protein has been shown to accelerate replication of a related mouse virus, a property that may contribute towards its increased in vivo virulence (Tangudu et al., 2007) .",

Activation of the HIS3 reporter was determined for the host AH109 strain, single transformants (BD, AD, BD-ORF6 and AD-nsp8), and co-transformants (BD-ORF6/AD-nsp8 and BD-N/AD-N). Hundred-fold serial dilutions of all of the above-mentioned log-phase cultures were plated on YPD (left) followed by SD-His-plus 50 mM 3-AT in increasing concentrations (0 mM to 5 mM 3-AT). selective media). Also, the untransformed host cells were plated as a negative control. Single transformants containing the BD-by itself or as a fusion with the ORF6 protein, showed growth on the synthetic dextrose Trp \u2212 plate (SDTrp \u2212 ). Correspondingly, single transformants containing the AD-by itself or as a fusion with nsp8 showed growth on the synthetic dextrose Leu \u2212 plate (SDLeu \u2212 ).

Growth of these clones on the SD Trp \u2212 Leu \u2212 His \u2212 media showed that the transcription of the HIS3 gene was turned on by the reconstitution of the GAL4 transactivator due to a specific ORF6-nsp8 interaction.

Our results from this assay indicate a moderate strength protein-protein interaction between the AD-nsp8 and BD-ORF6 proteins. This observation was further confirmed by the use of a 3-AT gradient on which the His + phenotype was tested (Fig. 2C ). 3-AT is known to be a competitive inhibitor of HIS3 protein, thus enhancing the stringency of selection, it reduces the background signal by inhibiting the product of the HIS3 reporter. This result clearly showed that the interaction of nsp8 with ORF6 was not as strong as the N-N dimerization positive control interaction. On plates with increasing concentrations of 3-AT, the growth ability of the His + colonies diminished and was almost undetectable at 5 mM 3-AT concentrations.",

Infection of Vero E6 cells with an isolate of SARS-CoV (strain HKU 39849) was carried out in a physical containment level 4 (PC4) laboratory as previously described (Kaye et al., 2006) . The cells were harvested at 0 or 24 h post-infection (h.p.i.) and the lysates were subjected to Western blot analysis to determine the expression of nsp8 and ORF6 proteins (Fig. 5) . Two specific proteins in the cells at 24 h. p.i. were detected with purified supernatant from hybridomas producing monoclonal antibodies against the nsp8 protein (see Materials and methods) and these were not found in the cells harvested at 0 h.p.i.

(B) Equal amounts of total cellular protein from Vero E6 cells either uninfected (lane 1) or infected with wildtype Dryvax (lane 2), a recombinant vaccinia virus expressing the SARS-CoV S protein (lane 3), or the recombinant vaccinia virus expressing the ORF6 protein used in this study (lane 4) were subjected to Western blot and probed with anti-ORF6 rabbit polyclonal antibody. This demonstrates that the \u223c 37 kDa band seen in lanes 1 and 2 of panel A is a cross-reacting protein that is probably a vaccinia virus protein or an up-regulated cellular protein which is detected by the rabbit anti-ORF6 antibody used in this study. lanes 1 and 2) .

Cell lysates obtained at 24 h.p.i. were then subjected to immunoprecipitation with either an irrelevant antibody (rabbit anti-Flag polyclonal antibody, lane 3) or rabbit anti-ORF6 polyclonal antibody (lane 4) and protein-A agarose beads. Western blot analyses showed that nsp8 protein (\u223c24 kDa) was co-immunoprecipitated when anti-ORF6 antibody was used but not when an irrelevant antibody was used, indicating that the nsp8 interacts specifically with ORF6 in SARS-CoV infected cells (upper panel, lanes 3 and 4) .",

            "text": "Indirect immunofluorescence analysis of ORF6 expression in SARS-CoV-infected cells (Fig. 6, middle panel) showed that, consistent with previous publications (Geng et al., 2005; Pewe et al., 2005) , ORF6 was found in the cytoplasm. Most of the ORF6 protein seen in infected cells were observed in a punctate staining pattern consistent with a vesicle-associated intracellular distribution. Using the rabbit polyclonal antibody against ORF6 (Abgent) and purified supernatant from hybridomas producing monoclonal antibodies against the nsp8 protein (see Materials and methods), cells infected with an isolate of SARS-CoV (strain HKU39849) were examined by indirect immunofluorescence to determine if the two proteins colocalized, as their interaction would suggest. The extent of colocalization seen between the two proteins was significant, both localizing to the same set of punctate structures (Fig. 6,  middle panel, D) . The punctate distribution of nsp8 has been previously described (Prentice et al., 2004a) and the colocalization of ORF6 protein with nsp8 suggests that ORF6 could be associated with the SARS-CoV replicase complex, localized to a subset of the vesicular trafficking complex in mammalian cells. These ORF6-containing vesicular structures did not colocalize with AP-1 and LAMP-2 (data not shown), which are present in early and late endosomes respectively. However, the ORF6 protein does colocalize with LAMP-1 (Fig. 7) , which is a lysosomal marker. LAMP-1 has been used as a marker for characteristic double-membrane vesicles seen in infections by other viruses (Jackson et al., 2005) and it has been shown that at least one other coronavirus induces these double-membrane vesicles, presumably as a site for the assembly of virus replication complexes (Prentice et al., 2004b) . Given this, the ORF6 protein might localize to these vesicles which have been suggested to be derived from the cellular autophagosomal machinery, but further study will be required. A recent structural study of the nsp8 protein has suggested a role for the nsp8-nsp7 hexadecamer in binding dsRNA intermediates in the viral replication cycle (Zhai et al., 2005) , further lending impetus to such a study. This is the first report describing the interaction between the ORF6 accessory protein and the nsp8 protein. We demonstrated the strength and specificity of this interaction by three independent methods, i.e. by yeast-2-hybrid, coimmunoprecipitation using in-vitro translated proteins in a cell-free system and co-immunoprecipitation using lysates from Vero E6 cells. Interestingly, two previous publications on ORF6 have shed some light on its possible function in viral pathogenesis. Geng and co-workers detected ORF6 protein in lung and intestine of SARS patients and showed that it could stimulate cellular DNA synthesis when overexpressed (Geng et al., 2005) . Pewe et al. (2005) showed that when SARS-CoV ORF gene was introduced into an attenuated murine coronavirus, the recombinant virus grew faster in cell culture and also exhibited enhanced lethality of infection in mice. In contrast, Yount and co-workers reported that the SARS-CoV virus with ORF6 deleted has the same viral replication kinetics as the wild-type virus in cell-culture and mice (Yount et al., 2005) . Hence, ORF6 is non-essential for viral replication in these models although it cannot rule out that ORF6 (and/or the other accessory proteins of SARS-CoV) contributes to the virulence and pathogenesis of SARS coronavirus infection in its natural host. Further experiments in more robust animal models, like non-human primates that demonstrate clinical disease upon SARS-CoV infection, will be needed to determine the actual function of ORF6 during SARS infection in vivo. Since our data shows that ORF6 interacts with nsp8 which is part of the replicase complex (Prentice et al., 2004a (Prentice et al., , 2004b , it will be important in future studies to determine if the interaction between ORF6 and nsp8 can modulate the viral synthesis process and to determine how ORF6 modulates viral pathogenesis in these animal models.",

The host strain containing the Nucleocapsid protein (N) of SARS virus fusion constructs pACT2-N and pAS2-N, shown previously to form a homodimer (Surjit et al., 2004) was used as a positive control. The AH109 host contains integrated copies of both HIS3 and lacZ reporter genes under the control of GAL4 binding sites. The AH109 yeast strain was transformed with the appropriate plasmids, using the lithium acetate procedure and grown on SD plates in the absence of Trptophane (Trp) and Leucine (Leu); (SDTrp \u2212 and SDLeu \u2212 ). Protein interaction was tested on SD plates without Leu, Trp and Histidine (SDLeu \u2212 Trp \u2212 His \u2212 ). After 3 days at 30\u00b0C, individual colonies were streaked out and tested for liquid and filter-lift \u03b2-galactosidase activity, 5 mM 3-amino-1,2,3-trizole assay (3AT) and the liquid \u03b2-galactosidase assay (Ober et al., 2002; Peiris et al., 2003; Pewe et al., 2005) . The filter \u03b2galactosidase assay, a parameter directly reflecting the strength of protein-protein interactions, was performed by streaking doubly transformed yeast colonies onto filter paper and allowing them to grow for 2 days on selection medium. Yeast was permeabilized by freezing yeast-impregnated filters in liquid nitrogen, and thawing at room temperature. This filter was placed over a second filter that was pre-soaked in Z buffer (pH 7.0) containing 10 mg/ml 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-\u03b2-D-galactopyranoside (X-gal) and 0.27% \u03b2-mercaptoethanol. Filters were left for 18 h to develop a blue color, which indicated a positive protein-protein interaction.

Relative enzymatic activity was determined in five independent transformants. Data for quantitative assays were collected for yeast cell number and are the mean \u00b1 S.E.M. of triplicate assays. Appropriate positive/negative controls and buffer blanks were used. The yeast Y187 host strain containing BD-1111 and AD-1112 were used as positive controls for these assays.",

The amplicon was digested with HindIII and NotI and cloned into the compatible sites of the pDD4-mh5 vector to create plasmid pDD4-mh5/ORF6. The pDD4-mh5 vector can be used to generate growth-competent recombinants expressing foreign genes in the D4 locus via a rescue method as previously described (Holzer and Falkner, 1997) . Essentially, the parental virus lacking the D4 gene is replication negative in the usual permissive host lines and only the reintegration of D4 into the virus genome allows for growth in these lines. This is in contrast to classical drug-based screening approaches which have previously been well established in the generation of vaccinia recombinants.",

The supernatant was removed, replaced with 2 ml DMEM containing no FBS or antibiotics and cells were transfected with 5 \u03bcg pDD4-mh5/ORF6 using lipofectamine reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), according to the manufacturer's protocol. After 3 days, advanced cytopathic effect was evident and the cells were harvested and subjected to Western blot analysis (see below) for determining ORF6 expression. Alternatively, the cells and culture supernatant were harvested together and then subjected to three rounds of freeze-thawing and clarified by centrifugation at 1500 rpm for 5 min. The supernatant, which constitute the P1 viral stock, was used to infect fresh CV-1 cells after which the P2 viral stock was harvested in the same manner and stored at \u2212 80\u00b0C before use. The P2 viral stock was titered in CV-1 cells. This approach of dominant host range selection provides a stringent and timesaving method for obtaining vaccinia recombinants carrying foreign genes and has been described previously (Holzer et al., 1998) . The recombinant vaccinia virus expressing the SARS-CoV S protein was previously generated using the same methods (Lip et al., 2006) .",
