The majority of current studies on infectious diseases have been conducted for the elucidation of viral virulence using experimental animals or viral gene function in vitro, but in a few case, researchers focused on wild animal itself.

However, it is recently reported that bats are also natural reservoirs or natural hosts of the emerging and re-emerging infectious disease, for examples Nipah virus, Hendra virus and lyssavirus infections including rabies, which lead to serious disorders in humans as well as in some animals [6] [7] [8] . Moreover, bat-SARS-CoV and Ebola virus were also isolated from bats, and the infectious disease derived from bats has been increasing in number [9] [10] [11] . Among these viruses, few investigators reported the result of experimental infection to bats and especially for Ebola virus, it was reported that bats supported the replication and circulation of high titers of this virus without any illness [12] . Many investigators focused on bats from the above-mentioned standpoints, however, most of basic information about their vital functions, such as the specific immune system and others associated with anti-viral activity, has been unclear until now. Therefore, basic researches for immunology in bats are important to advance investigation of the bat-derived infectious diseases.",

Moreover, this result created a new possibility that the genus Rousette may be the prototype of the suborder of Megachiroptera which was divided from Microchiroptera (one of missing rings of the small bats to mega bats). Thus, it is considered that the genus Rousette is the most suitable group for comparative studies on bat species.",

To assess the specificity of the anti-bat IgG antibody, we performed western blot analysis. Only one band with a molecular weight of about 160 kDa was detected in both bat serum and purified bat IgG fraction. These results suggested that the prepared anti-bat IgG antibody had high specificity. To compare the specificity, sera were obtained from four orders, i.e. Primate (one squirrel monkey, two lemurian monkeys and one human), Carnivora (four dogs), Insectivora (five large Japanese moles and four house shrews) and Chiroptera including two Rousettes, one Microchiroptera and three other Megachriopteras. The crossreactivity of IgG epitopes in each serum sample using anti-bat IgG antibody was determined by the competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Fetal calf serum (FCS) was used as negative control. As a result, all serum samples obtained from Chiroptera showed high cross-reactivity, over 95% of inhibition, and the cross-reactivity of other animal samples was very low, mostly less than 20% of inhibition. The mean and standard deviation of percent inhibition of sera from Primates, Carnivores, Insectivores and Chiroptera were 15 This result indicated that the anti-Rousette IgG polyclonal antibody had a high specificity to Chiroptera IgG, and will be useful for the screening and detection of pathogens. It supported also that two suborders of Chiroptera were closely related to each other or are monophyletic. The relationship between Chiroptera and other species, which have been considered as close relatives of bats such as Primate, Insectivora and Carnivora, were obviously distinct. However, the present result indicated that Primate and Carnivora might be more closely related to Chiroptera than Insectivora (po0.05).",

When the homology of the nucleotide and the deduced amino acid sequences were compared between the bat CD4 and those of other animals, such as human, mouse, cat, dog and chicken, bat CD4 had a higher homology to both cat and dog CD4 than those of other animals. The phylogenic tree using neighbor-joining method with the amino acid sequence of CD4 showed that bat CD4 was closely related to cat and dog CD4 and was distant from duck and chicken, which agreed with the homology of the nucleotide and the amino acid sequence. This result supported that Chiroptera was included in the same clade including cat, dog, pig and whale [45, 46] . Moreover, the amino acid sequence of the CD4 Ig-like C-type 1 domain was compared between bat and other animals. In bat CD4, there was an insertion of 18 extra amino acids in the beginning of this domain, where dog and cat CD4 have 9 and 16 amino acids insertions, respectively, provided CD4 of human and mouse being as a standard. The insertion might influence the relationship between V-type domain and C-type 1 domain. In the N-terminus side, cystein pair might be lost because one cystein was replaced by tryptophan in the bat CD4, whereas in the case of human, monkey and mouse CD4 it was still cystein. The latter animals might have a disulfide bond formed by the two cysteins in this region. However, bat CD4 lacked the disulfide bond, as in cat, dog and whale. As a result the conformation of bat CD4 Ig-like C-type 1 region might be different from that of the human and mouse (Fig. 3) . The conformational change of the bat CD4 might influence the antigen presentation process between APC and helper T cells by means of CD4-MHC classII connection [47, 48] .",

When some microbes infect to cells or are detected by antimicrobe intercellular or extracellular sensors, type-I IFNs are secreted from most of the cells, especially from dendritic cells. Secreted type-I IFNs bind to the interferon receptor (IFNAR) and activate the expression of numerous interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), such as the protein kinase R (PKR), the 2 0 -5 0 oligoadenylate synthetases (OAS), the myxovirus resistance gene (Mx), which have anti-viral activities [50] .

Therefore, we checked homology of the bat IFN-b to those of human, pig, cat, horse and mouse.

This result indicated that the immunological cells, especially for B cells, in Rousette bats kept in our laboratory under the conventional condition were naturally activated, or they might be coexisted with some microbes, which were apparently no pathogenic to Rousette bat.

However, Tb-1 Lu did express neither IFN-a nor b mRNA at any time. It indicated that the reaction of IFN-b was sooner for a reaction to virus or microbes as soon as possible and that of IFN-a was longer for the expression of antiviral activity proteins, including the PKR, OAS and Mx protein, for long time. Meanwhile, when Tb-1 Lu were treated with poly(I:C) and the conditioned medium, these cells did not express type-I IFNs mRNA at any time. From these results, we suggested that the mechanism from the recognition of poly(I:C) through TLR3 or bat IFNs through IFNAR to the expression of type-I IFNs was not working right in Tb-1 Lu cell line, whereas BPKC did work.

During the past decade, bats have been associated with a number of emerging zoonotic agents, including Hendra, Nipah, Lyssa, Ebola and SARS coronavirus-like viruses. Therefore, bats are thought to be an important reservoir of many mammalian viruses. Serological surveys of viruses that infected bats have been already reported. Most of the surveys were conducted by using neutralization test (NT) or fluorescent antibody tests [9, 11, [61] [62] [63] [64] . However, it is not easy to obtain the sufficient amount of blood samples to perform these tests, because of the size of bats, particularly in Microchiroptera (microbats). Moreover, these assays are not so suitable for testing a large number of samples at the same time. For these points of view, ELISA is a powerful tool for the serological survey viruses that infect bats. However, there are no conventional ELISA systems, except the systems using protein G or competitive techniques with monoclonal antibodies [65] [66] [67] [68] .",

YOKV belongs to Entebbe bat virus group, the genus Flavivirus, family Flaviviridae, and was isolated from a bat in Oita Prefecture in Japan in 1971 [70] . Before the virus was isolated, attempts were done to isolate JEV from bats by Oya et al., to investigate the possibility that bats served as a reservoir for JEV in winter period. During this investigation, YOKV was isolated from bats, Miniopterus fuliginosus, which seemed to be different from JEV by serological analysis.",

In this survey, 2.7% of the samples collected from the Philippines and 19% from Malaysia showed detectable levels of antibodies. Serum samples were also tested by NT, and the correlation rate between ELISA and NT was 0.79. These data suggest that YOKV is distributed not only in Japan but also in other Asian countries. However, the antibody titer against YOKV was not so high in this survey. And, it is known that antibodies against flaviviruses show cross-reactivity with other flaviviral antigens [68] . Therefore, to examine the specificity of ELISA, ELISA substituting the antigen to JEV, which was widely distributed in South-East Asian countries, was conducted. Although ELISA with JEV antigen reacted with the positive serum against YOKV, the ELISA titer was much lower than homologous titer with YOKV antigen. These results suggest that this conventional ELISA system is useful to detect the specific YOKV antibody in bat sera. The method is so simple, and easy to establish without obtaining specific antibodies against target virus. This system has a possibility to be applied to other viruses by substituting only the coating virus antigen.",

These bats were kindly obtained from the zoo. The fruit bats were kept in separate cages in the farm away from any other animal species. ELISA test was used to exclude the bats which have antibody against YOKV. The results showed that 14% of these bats had ELISA antibodies. The seronegative bats were experimentally infected with YOKV, and no clinical signs were observed. Moreover, no significant amplification of virus genome was detected by RT-PCR from the sera and organs. These results reveal that YOKV replicates poorly in bats, suggesting that bats do not seem to serve as an amplifying host for YOKV. Our results coincide with the previous reports on West Nile virus [73] , conveying that insectivorous bats have antibodies against the virus, but the level of virus growth is low.",

[70] have determined the complete nucleotide sequence of YOKV and compared the nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences with those of other flaviviruses. They concluded that YOKV is genetically closer to yellow fever virus than JEV, and is more closely related to the partially reported amino acid sequences of Entebbe bat virus, Sokuluk virus and Sepik virus. Previous phylogenenic analysis of the genus Flavivirus revealed that flaviviruses could be divided into three groups: mosquito-borne, tick-borne, and unknown vector groups [74, 75] . Tajima et al. indicated that YOKV would belong to mosquito-borne group, although YOKV is classified in the Entebbe bat virus group of vector unknown group. Previous report indicated that Entebbe bat and Sokluk viruses could replicate in mosquito cells in vitro [76] . These findings may suggest that YOKV as well as Entebbe bat virus and Sokluk virus is related to mosquito-borne flaviviruses. These facts might suggest that the fruits bats, which showed ELISA antibodies, were infected by mosquitoes. YOKV might have other amplifying host except bats, and mosquitoes might be candidate for an amplifying host for YOKV. Further studies on virus isolation from mosquitoes are needed to confirm the epidemiology of YOKV.",
