SARS CoV total immunoglobulin (Ig) (IgG, IgA, and IgM [IgGAM]) was the first antibody to be detectable. There was no difference in time to seroconversion between the patients who survived (n \u202b\u060d\u202c 14) and those who died (n \u202b\u060d\u202c 6). Although SARS CoV IgM was still detectable by IF tests with 8 of 11 patients at 7 months postinfection, the geometric mean titers dropped from 282 at 1 month postinfection to 19 at 7 months (P \u202b\u060d\u202c 0.001). In contrast, neutralizing antibody and SARS CoV IgGAM and IgG antibody titers remained stable over this period. The SARS CoV antibody response was sometimes associated with an increase in preexisting IF IgG antibody titers for human coronaviruses OC43, 229E, and NL63. There was no change in IF IgG titer for virus capsid antigen from the herpesvirus that was used as an unrelated control, Epstein-Barr virus. In contrast, patients who had OC43 infections, and probably also 229E infections, without prior exposure to SARS CoV had increases of antibodies specific for the infecting virus but not for SARS CoV. There is a need for awareness of cross-reactive antibody responses between coronaviruses when interpreting IF serology.",

It has therefore been assumed that a positive SARS CoV IF result can be taken as unequivocal evidence of SARS CoV infection. Conflicting opinions concerning serological cross-reactions between human coronaviruses have remained. When enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) are used, human antibody responses to 229E and OC43 can be clearly distinguished (5, 14) . However, some cross-reactive responses have been detected by IF (9), by complement fixation tests (8) , and by ELISA using recombinant viral proteins (18) . Since additional human coronaviruses have been now discovered, and in view of the global public health importance of diagnosing SARS, it remains important to revisit the question of potential cross-reactions in the human serological responses to coronaviruses.",

Each serum dilution (0.05 ml) was mixed with 0.05 ml of 200 50% tissue culture infectious doses of SARS CoV (HK39849) and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 1.5 h in a CO2 incubator. Then 0.1 ml of the virus-serum mixture was inoculated in duplicate wells of 96-well microtiter plates with preformed monolayers of FRhK4 cells (SARS CoV) and further incubated at 37\u00b0C. A virus back-titration was performed to assess the actual virus titer used in each experiment. A cytopathic effect was observed using an inverted microscope on days 3 and 4 postinoculation. Neutralization titer was determined as the highest dilution of serum which completely suppresses the cytopathic effect in at least half of the infected wells. The experiment was read when the virus back-titration showed the virus dose to be 100 50% tissue culture infectious doses, as expected.",

Sera from four SARS patients with a rise in IF antibody response to both OC43 and 229E and from five patients who had no cross-reactive response to these viruses were tested for IF antibody responses on NL63-infected cells. Five of these patients had a fourfold or greater increase in antibody titers to NL63; three of them also showed a rise in antibody titers to OC43 and 229E. To determine whether these cross-reactive responses were due to polyclonal activation, two patients with a significant rise of antibody to SARS CoV, 229E, OC43, and NL63 were tested for Epstein-Barr virus virus capsid antigen (VCA) IgG, which served as an antigenically unrelated control. Neither of these two patients had a significant change in Epstein-Barr virus VCA IgG titers.",

            "text": "Since serology remains the gold standard for diagnosis of SARS, it is important to explore serological cross-reactions between SARS CoV and the other human coronaviruses 229E and OC43. We show that 12 (60%) of the 20 SARS patients had fourfold rising titers to OC43, 229E, or both (Table 1) . Another recent study has shown evidence of rising antibodies to OC43 and 229E in animals immunized with SARS CoV and in human patients with SARS (3). Furthermore, in the subset of patients tested, some also had rising IF antibody titers to the recently discovered NL63 coronavirus. Since most SARS patients had preexisting antibody to 229E, OC43, and NL63, SARS CoV infection appears to stimulate cross-reactive antibody responses to one or more of these viruses. This could be due to cross-reactive antigenic epitopes or to the infection resulting in polyclonal activation of antibody. However, patients who demonstrate a cross-reactive coronavirus response do not have a significant change in IF antibody to a virus of an unrelated family, e.g., Epstein-Barr virus. Thus, the presence of cross-reactive antigenic epitopes rather than polyclonal activation of antibody appears to be the explanation for these findings. Similarly, and perhaps for similar reasons, 27% of OC43-infected patients and one of three patients infected with 229E induced rising antibody titer to the other virus (Table 3) . Such cross-reaction between human coronaviruses has been noted before in IF (9) and complement fixation tests (8) .",

This is in agreement with the fact that there is no IF or neutralization antibody to SARS CoV detectable in uninfected individuals (2) . This lack of crossreactive response to SARS CoV is possibly because these patients had no prior immunological memory for SARS CoV. Thus, there is less opportunity for a cross-reactive response. Given the evidence of antigenic cross-reactions between coronaviruses, it remains possible, however, that there may indeed be an increase in antibody SARS CoV titer in a patient who has previously had SARS CoV infection when the patient subsequently gets infected by OC43 or 229E. This remains to be formally demonstrated. However, awareness of this possibility is important from a diagnostic point of view. Such crossreactions probably explain the positive results in ELISA tests based on recombinant nucleoprotein antigens (18) . Furthermore, hyperimmune animal antisera to some group 1 human (7). In summary, one may remain confident that seroconversion by IF or neutralization tests to SARS CoV is indeed conclusive evidence of SARS CoV infection. However, if the first available serum from a patient already has detectable antibody to SARS CoV, a rise in IF antibody titer to SARS CoV may not necessarily confirm SARS CoV infection. It remains important to obtain a better understanding of cross-reactivity of human serological responses to coronaviruses for purposes of laboratory diagnosis as well as for understanding pathogenesis and immunity.",

Serial serum samples from a cohort of 20 patients were tested by indirect immunofluorescence on cells infected with SARS CoV and human coronaviruses 229E and OC43. In addition, neutralizing antibody titers to SARS CoV were determined. The mean time (in days) to seroconversion to SARS CoV determined by IF tests when using a conjugate reacting to all human IgA, IgGAM, and neutralization test assays for patients who recovered from SARS were 17.9, 16.9, 19.1, 14.8, and 17.3, respectively, while those with fatal outcome were 17.8, 16.7, 19.2, 14.7, and 16.9.",
