[1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] Currently, little information exists about the impact of kidney injury and resource utilization in the form of dialytic support in critically ill patients with pandemic H1N1 infections. 8, 9 Patients admit-ted to the ICU with acute kidney injury (AKI) are at increased risk of mortality, lengthened ICU and hospital stays, and the development of chronic kidney disease. [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] It is unknown whether this observation can be extended to AKI in the setting of severe viral respiratory infections requiring ICU admission. During the severe adult respiratory syndrome coronavirus outbreak, kidney injury and the need for dialysis were uncommon; however, whether this holds true for pandemic H1N1 infection is unknown. 17, 18 The objective of this study is to describe rates of kidney injury, kidney failure, and need for dialysis therapies in critically ill patients infected with pandemic H1N1.",

            "text": "Several limitations of the present study merit emphasis. Although our study included a large cohort (N \u03ed 50) of critically ill patients with pandemic H1N1, the sample size was too small to permit multivariate modeling or precise effect estimates. Multivariate analysis might have more accurately identified risk factors for kidney injury and failure in pandemic H1N1 and more accurately estimated the independent impact (ie, adjusted for confounding) of kidney failure on outcome in these patients. Although acute kidney failure was associated with mortality, the CI of the effect was wide (1.29-98.8), limiting its precision. Little information was available before ICU admission, and data for initial clinical presentation and type and timing of interventions might have shed further light on why kidney injury develops in some patients, but not others. Criteria for the initiation of dialysis therapy were not standardized; therefore, the incidence of dialysis may reflect local practice patterns to some degree, limiting generalizability. The study population is from a single region (Manitoba, Canada) and had a large proportion of First Nations (aboriginal) patients, factors that may limit generalizability to other centers and regions.",

Because of the strong association between kidney outcomes and both mortality and length of ICU stay, careful monitoring and characterization of kidney injury should be performed early in admission. These findings are of importance for clinicians in prognosticating their patients with suspected pandemic H1N1 infection, in addition to administrators planning for equipment and personnel training with this novel emerging infectious disease pandemic.",
