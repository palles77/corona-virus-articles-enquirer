In the second week about 80% of the patients will develop progressive pneumonic changes with increasing oxygen requirement ('immune response phase'). About 25% will develop acute respiratory distress syndrome, requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission. The clinical course in young children is markedly different; they appear to develop a milder form of the disease than adolescents or adults. Two distinct patterns of clinical presentation are noted; 4 teenagers present with symptoms of malaise, myalgia, chills and rigor similar to those of adults, whereas younger children present with cough and runny nose and none had chills, rigor or myalgia. In the recent epidemic, no children of less than 12 years of age required ICU admission and most never developed an oxygen requirement. In contrast, some adolescents may have a more progressive course, though less aggressive than that seen in adult patients. It is also important to note that no fatalities among the paediatric age group were reported.",

            "text": "We carried out psychological assessment on four SARS affected patients, two boys and two girls, aged between 7 and 13 years of age, 5 months after hospital discharge. Both patients and their main caregivers (mother in three cases and grandmother in one) underwent a semi-structured interview that was developed and based on the Resilience Model of Family Stress, Adjustment and Adaptation postulated by McCubbin and McCubbin. 5 Psychological distress was not found in this small group of SARS affected children. Psychological adjustment and adaptation in children were associated with psychological adaptation of the family instead of the disease-related variables. The main psychological impacts can be differentiated into three domains: illness itself, period of hospitalisation and family responses. Summary Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) runs a more benign course in children during the acute phase. Unlike adult patients, no fatalities were reported among the paediatric SARS patients. Published data on long-term sequelae of SARS are very limited. In our follow-up study, although patients have clinically recovered from their initial illness, exercise impairment and residual radiological abnormalities were demonstrated at 6 months after diagnosis. It is important to assess these patients on a regular basis to detect and provide appropriate management for persistent or emerging long-term sequelae in the physical, psychological and social domains. \u00df 2004 Elsevier Ltd.
