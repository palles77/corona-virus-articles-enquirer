MERS is caused by a virus named MERS-CoV, which belongs to a large family of viruses called coronaviruses [2] . It was initially termed human (or novel) corona virus but was later changed to MERS-CoV [3] . Corona viruses are single-strand, positive-sense RNA viruses that measure 120-160 nanometers in diameter and are pleomorphic in shape [4] . In September 2012, the first case of MERS (the so called index case) was reported in Saudi Arabia and presented as symptoms of pneumonia and acute kidney injury [5] . Soon after, another patient from Qatar who had visited Saudi Arabia began experiencing acute respiratory symptoms and renal failure. The symptoms and type of viruses reported in these two patients were the same [6, 7] . The age of patients with MERS ranged from 9 months to 94 years, and the median age was 48 years [8] . Male patients constituted 64% of the total number of cases in non-health care worker patients [8] . Conversely, according to Balkhy et al., the median age of health care workers who got MERS during the outbreak from June to August 2015 was 37 years, and female workers constituted 77% of the total cases [9] . In addition, the mortality rate in the infected general population was higher and incomparable to the that of health care workers because they were younger, healthier, and with fewer comorbidities [9] .",

Our study revealed that medical students had a good level of awareness of the clinical aspects of MERS, such as the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention. Approximately 92% of the students knew that there was no vaccination available, and 97% of them students were knowledgeable about the mode of transmission. This awareness could be due to their clinical studies during the outbreak and the awareness campaigns in the hospital and on social media, which were the most common sources of information. Furthermore, the internet was the most common channel for obtaining health awareness regarding MERS for the general Saudi population [18] . However, their awareness regarding the number of new cases in August 2015 was not as expected. Half of the students could not estimate the correct number of new cases, which could be due to a lack of interest or a lack of resources for the students to keep themselves updated and current with new events.",

Also, 80% of the students were not aware of the basic structure of single-stranded RNA viruses. This showed that respondents' knowledge of the basic sciences and technical details related to the virus was relatively lower in comparison to their knowledge in the clinical sciences, which could be due to a variety of different factors. First, a lack of basic science courses in their curriculum could explain their lack of awareness. Second, a lack of emphasis on this information in their clinical practice could also be another possible explanation. Moreover, in awareness campaigns directed to medical students, there was not enough coverage of these elements, which resulted in decreased awareness. Therefore, decreased awareness of the technical details of the virus is expected in medical students due to the abovementioned reasons. Because medical students are supposed to play a role as health advocates, they should thoroughly understand new medical events and obtain more indepth knowledge regarding all aspects of the event, such as virus classification and the basic structure of the virus, than the general population to be able to raise awareness in their communities. The results of this study revealed that there was a significant difference in three items when comparing male and female students. Female students were more knowledgeable about the incubation period and the possibility for the disease to present asymptomatically. One could argue that female students are more interested in emerging infectious diseases, and therefore, keep more up-to-date than their male counterparts.",

This could be explained by the fact that fifth year students had just studied the basic medical sciences, including virology, in their fourth year, so they had more recently acquired the knowledge than sixth year students. Also, fifth year students had clinical rotations in infectious diseases when they studied Pediatrics and Medicine, whereas sixth year students did not have a similar clinical rotation. One could question why we chose to evaluate only fifth and sixth year medical students. We specifically evaluated fifth and sixth year medical students because these students were in the clinical phase of their education and direct contact with patients was part of their clinical studies both before and after the outbreak.",

First, our medical students were raising awareness in their communities regarding MERS because it was a very common and relevant topic in the media and the community. Therefore, researchers wanted to assess whether medical students were well informed about MERS and prepared to play their role as health advocates in their communities. Second, the researchers wanted to identify areas that need to be addressed in order to improve the student's knowledge, which will lead to better education of the general population.
