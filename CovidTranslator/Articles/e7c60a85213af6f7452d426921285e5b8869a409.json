We developed and refined our methods during a study involving eight participants living in severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-affected areas (Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Toronto). The framework is an adaptation of narrative analysis, a qualitative method that is used to investigate a phenomenon through interpretation of the stories people tell about their experiences. From our work, several hypotheses emerged that will contribute to future research. For example, our findings showed that many decisions in an epidemic are carefully considered and involve use of significant information gathering. Having a good model of lay actions based on information received and beliefs held will contribute to the development of more effective information support systems in the event of a future epidemic.",

            "text": "There is a great deal of current interest in preparing for outbreaks of infectious disease. Both national and international efforts are aimed at developing strategies for rapid containment in the event of an outbreak [1] . Government officials seek to contain an infectious disease through the cooperative efforts of the public by providing information either directly (pamphlets, Web sites, posters, etc.) or through mass media news. The public also finds information concerning an outbreak from television programs and newspaper articles as well as from various ''non-official'' sources (e.g., socially through word-of-mouth). Recent initiatives [2] show support for research that concerns tailoring public health messages during an outbreak disaster to the lay public ''with care so that information reported is easy to understand, is appropriate and is relevant. '' In this paper, we propose a qualitative methodological framework that characterizes human behavior during epidemics. This methodological framework, based on narrative analysis, is a tool for learning about how laypersons use information to build representations of an epidemic situation and how the results of this process influence their decisions to act. Two factors, social influences and emotional triggers, are considered as mediators of actions and are therefore also of concern to this work. The methods we use allow insights into actions taken that are interpreted within the partici-pant\u00d5s situation (i.e., from the participant\u00d5s own viewpoint). This type of work is essential for tailoring health messages that are useable by people during an epidemic and effective at changing risky behaviors.",

Our methodology was refined through application of the framework to the analysis of these data. In Section 4, we summarize the lessons learned and provide direction for future research.

We briefly review literature related to information seeking, perceiving information needs [6, 7] , and emotional effects that play into lay perceptions of information [8] .

General models of active information seeking [6, 7] describe the process of how a person seeks information, from an emerging awareness of a ''gap'' in current knowledge to communication of this information need as a query that will locate the missing information. Within the domain of health information seeking, the models that relate to a gap in knowledge alone were found to be insufficient because they focus exclusively on rational processes. They cannot explain information-seeking behavior when patients do not seek medical information even though they are aware of gaps in their knowledge [4] . For health-related information seeking, theories of stress and coping have been integrated with two cognitive states that have been proposed as central to understanding an individual\u00d5s response to an adverse health-related situation: orientation towards a threat (referred to as monitoring) and turning attention away from the threat (referred to as blunting) [14] [15] [16] .",

They found a direct association between problem-focused coping and monitoring. This study also showed that monitoring is related to unpredictability.

They found that middle and high school students often relied on practical knowledge of disease, rather than on known facts about HIV. For example, one student acknowledged known facts about HIV, such as the fact that it is incurable. However, other explanations of the disease process later came into play while reasoning through a scenario about HIV. The scenario asked the student to discuss whether it was possible to expel HIV from the body. The same student who acknowledged the fact that HIV was incurable also believed that by drinking and exercising heavily it would be possible to expel HIV from the body. This student stated, ''Cause people can stop it like that. By exercising, like they said. Like that lady, like I told you, she exercised her way out of cancer, so I think this is true, you can exercise your way out of HIV probably.'' Informally learned remedies and cultural beliefs sometimes play a major role in determining lay interpretations of epidemic events. For instance, Raza et al. [24] examined lay understanding of the plague with persons belonging to the economically weaker sections of society in Delhi and Gurgaon India. In identifying the factors that influence the public understanding of science, they found significant amount of lay understanding based on ''extra-scientific belief systems'' (e.g., sins committed by people contributed to the outbreak), which were prevalent in the context of the plague epidemic.",

Another method of understanding lay reaction is through questionnaires/ surveys following a real-life episode [24] or a simulation of an outbreak [25, 26] . These questionnaires use pre-defined categories leading to large amounts of data on select variables of interest (e.g., whether or not people believe they would follow quarantine restrictions).

These personal accounts, or narratives, of first-hand experience are a valuable source of data that can offer insight into a situation as it unfolded over time. By studying a sequence of events told as a retrospective narrative, an investigator can see how individuals temporally and causally link events (episodes) together. This approach falls under the qualitative paradigm and is referred to as narrative analysis [27] ; these methods have to do with the ''systematic interpretation of interpretation [28] .'' Narrative analysis is commonly used as a methodological tool in health psychology [29, 30] and anthropology [31] . Stories people tell are based on their mental representations of illness or ''learned internalized patterns of thought-feeling that mediate both the interpretation of ongoing experience and the reconstruction of memories'' [32] . Narratives tell us something about how individuals understand events and construct meaning out of a situation. Illnesses are often explained by reconstructing events in a cohesive story-like manner. For example, Garro [33] discusses how people talk about illness; they link their experiences from the past with present concerns and future possibilities.",

To illustrate, ''time 001'' is assigned to link together the segments 01-10 shown below and the same code ''time 001'' is assigned to segments of text lines 101-104 found later in the interview. 01 And I spoke to my girlfriend and she said that she was going to leave Hong Kong 02 and I was really shocked because she was the one that was like myself, 03 just kind of sticking around and saying oh it\u00d5s not a big deal 04 and we\u00d5ll manage and uh she um felt that she just got into a panic herself. 05 And what happened around that time at the end of March that there was a rumor 06 that a teenager actually started on the Internet, 07 he put it on he like, he said that the airport had been closed 08 and that people couldn\u00d5t get in or out of Hong Kong 09 and they later deemed of course it was a hoax. 10 But at the time my girlfriend heard this, she didn\u00d5t know, she panicked and she was leaving. . . . later in the interview . . . 100 I did a bit more internet grocery shopping because I did not want to go to the grocery stores. 101 Usually, it was really strange because right around, right. . . a week or so before I left I would go to the market. 102 It was actually; it was right around the time that that rumor came out that the Hong Kong airport had shut down. 103 The store was so packed it was unbelievable. 104 I thought it was a holiday, and I even asked a friend. I said, what is going on with the market?",

The second stage consisted of reorganizing the events in the narrative into the correct chronological order. This was necessary because participant\u00d5s stories and anecdotes were not always told in the same order that they occurred during the epidemic. The last stage used the time-ordered data from phase two in order to evaluate influences on actions taken.

One important influence on actions was the vocabulary used by an information source (in particular, mass media), which served as a catalyst for major changes in lay reaction. As an example, use of the word ''epidemic'' caused emotional and behavioral changes. A Toronto resident stated that seeing the word ''epidemic'' was key ''uh, I wanted to know how fast it was spreading because if I thought it was an epidemic I would make the decision to stay home and not go to work.'' The Hong Kong resident provides another example of this. After seeing the headline ''SARS an epidemic in Hong Kong,'' this lead her to conduct Web searches, which in turn lead to further learning about transmission. She therefore updated her understanding of the virus through the Web searches, learning that the ''virus lives on surfaces up to 3 hours.'' These were considered a specific type of ''trigger'' based on source. These media triggers are ''emotionally loaded'' words that caused participants to experience major shifts in thinking about the epidemic. They were identified while reorganizing the narratives to consolidate all events (according to the participants\u00d5 perceptions) that happened in the same time period. Participants stated certain media events (i.e., ''triggers'') over and over again in separate stories, linking different aspects of their experience.",

The participant\u00d5s understanding of disease transmission and epidemic status (containment) influenced decisions either directly, or indirectly (through increasing negative emotions). Evidence that many decisions in an epidemic are carefully considered and involve use of significant information gathering prior to the actual decision is consistent with some of the literature in public health [39] -but not in the literature related to decisions in emergency situations [12] . We found that as concern increased, participants became more aware of information until they felt the need to move beyond scanning to searching databases for information (passive viewing switched to active as fear increased).
