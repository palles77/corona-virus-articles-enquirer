In semisusceptible mice, infection led first to a transient meningitis, ependymitis, and leukoencephalitis, followed by a permanent communicating hydrocephalus and, later on, to a chronic thrombotic vasculitis affecting meningeal and parenchymal vessels at the brain stem level. Small foci of ischemic necrosis related to vascular occlusions were seen in the dorsal brain stem. Cyclophosphamide treatment of semisusceptible mice significantly reduced the meningeal infiltrates but did not prevent the development of hydrocephalus and other neuropathologic changes. Identical lesions occurred in fully susceptible mice infected with a low dose of virus, but no neurologic disorder could be induced in genetically resistant mice even following immunosuppression or intracranial inoculation. The leukoencephalitis differed from the demyelinating lesions observed with MHV 4. Vascular lesions were of particular interest. More attention should be given to the possibility of virus induced chronic cerebral vasculitis in man.",

            "text": "Differences in susceptibility to virus infection depend on characteristics of injected virus (Weiner et al. 1977 Wolinsky and Stroop 1978) , the route of infection (Johnson 1964) , and on host genetic factors and immune function (Allison 1965; Hirsch et al. 1970; Levy-Leblond et al. 1979 ). Mouse hepatitis virus 3 (MHV 3), a member of the corona virus group, is either avirulent, hepatotropic, or neurotropic, depending on the strain of mice infected. Adult A/J mice are fully resistant to the virus. Susceptible strains (e.g., DBA/2 or BALB/c) develop an acute hepatic necrosis leading to death within a few days. Some mouse strains (e.g., C3H/He) as well as F 1 hybrids between resistant and susceptible strains exhibit a \"semisusceptibility\" resulting either in early death or, in surviving animals, in the development of a chronic disease with neurologic manifestations and virus persistence (Dupuy et al. 1975; Le Prevost et al. 1975a, b) . Ependymitis and vasculitis have been reported . Susceptibility or resistance to MHV 3 infection has been shown to be under the influence of at least two major gene complexes, one for the acute disease and the other, H-2 linked, for the chronic disease (Levy-Leblond et al. 1979 ). In addition to genetic factors, one of us has observed that host defense against MHV 3 infection requires at least three types of immunocompetent cells: T-lymphocytes, splenic macrophages, and NK-like lymphoid cells (Tardieu et al. 1980) .",

In our animals aqueductal stenosis was not observed (at least until the 130th day p.i.), and there was no meningeal fibrosis (arachnoid villi were not examined). Immunosuppression of semisusceptible animals with cyclophosphamide did not prevent the appearance of hydrocephalus; its most remarkable effect was the nearly complete suppression of the meningeal infiltrate. Fibrosis of the meninges can, therefore, probably be discounted as the cause of intraventricutar hypertension and the mechanism of hydrocephalus remains unsettled.

Such a sequence of events is known, however, in congenital rubella, where degeneration of vessel walls leads to multifocal ischemic necrosis of the brain (Rorke and Spiro 1967; Singer et al. 1967; Rorke 1973 ) and similar lesions have been shown in experimental animals (Rorke et al. 1968) . A rare condition, granulomatous angiitis has been related to varicella-zoster infection (Kolodny et al. 1968; Rosenblum and Hodfield 1972; Linnemann and Alvira 1980) and to other viral infections (Reyes et al. 1976 ) in man. Also, it is known that inflammatory perivascular infiltrates perist for many months in human poliomyelitis (Esiri 1980) . At the time vascular lesions develop, a low titer of virus can still be detected in the brain, as late as 6 months p.i. (Le Prevost et al. 1975b), and Dupuy et al. (1973) have demonstrated at that stage a severe non specific immunodepression (Dupuy et al. 1973) . To investigate possible immune mediation in the generation of vascular lesions, we studied the effects of two immunomodulating regimen in semisusceptible mice: cyclophosphamide, which depresses T-and B-cell activities (Stockman et al. 1973) and S9Sr, which abolishes selectively NK cell activity (Kumar et al. 1976; Tardieu et al. 1980 ). Cyclophosphamide did not prevent necrosis of vessel walls and thrombosis. 89 Sr treatment changed the pattern from semisusceptible to susceptible mice, dying of acute hepatic necrosis. To study further the effect of 898r, preliminary experiments were performed in which mice were injected with MHV 3 1 day after the second injection of 89Sr, to avoid acute hepatic necrosis. The intensity of vasculitis in these mice and in controls was identical. These experiments suggest that T, B, and NK-cells do not play a prominent role in the induction of vascular lesions. However, there is as yet no clear evidence in favor of a direct action of the virus on the vessels, and further research is needed into the pathogenesis of the thrombotic vasculitis following MHV 3 infection.",

These findings suggest that host cells in the brain from fully susceptible and semisusceptible strains are equally able to support viral replication and are equally susceptible to give rise to destructive lesions. The absence of disease in resistant mice may be related to an inability of host cells to either bind or replicate MHV 3. It is also possible that other means of immunosuppression may alter this genetic resistance.",
