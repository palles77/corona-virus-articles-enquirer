Links between the index cases and the city's South China Seafood Market were noted. With the possibility of a new zoonosis or severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in mind, investigations were undertaken that have since identified a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 (formerly 2019-nCoV), as the agent now at the heart of an international outbreak centred around Hubei. Despite dramatic headlines in the international press, the outbreak has been characterised by an extraordinarily rapid and effective scientific response, with identification of the pathogen, publication of its genome, and development of highly specific diagnostics within weeks of the initial case detection.",

            "text": "The clinical disease termed COVID-19 is caused by a novel betacoronavirus, now named SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 shares 79% sequence identity with SARS-CoV, the virus which caused a major outbreak in 2002-2003. [2] [3] [4] In common with SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 utilises the ACE-2 receptor for cell entry. Electron microscopy reveals pleomorphic spherical particles, studded with distinctive spike proteins. 5 Coronaviruses, a family which also includes Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) CoV and four of the main agents of the common cold, are zoonotic pathogens. In keeping with this, the first cluster of cases were identified in association with the South China Seafood Market, a 'wet' market at which a large range of live or freshly slaughtered animals were sold including poultry, bats, and snakes. A very early report suggesting a snake host for SARS-CoV-2, such as the Chinese cobra, garnered lurid news headlines but a cold scientific reception. 6 This report used a technique which exploits the concept that amino acids can be coded for by more than one threenucleotide sequence, and that different species have preferences for particular codon sequences. 7 These data have since been superseded by more conventional phylogenetic analyses, and SARS-CoV-2 is currently thought to originate from a bat host, based on 88-96% sequence similarity to bat coronaviruses, in keeping with other pathogenic coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. 3, 4 However, definitive identification of the animal host depends on detection of virus in situ in an infected animal. Additionally, another intermediate animal host more commonly in close contact with humans may also have played a role in Wuhan; SARS-CoV for example is thought to have passed from bats to humans via Himalayan palm civets, Chinese ferret badgers and raccoon dogs sold at the wet markets of Guangdong. 8",

The most common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (98%), cough (76%), dyspnoea (55%) and myalgia or fatigue (44%).

Samples from seven patients (six of whom were seafood peddlers or deliverers at the wholesale market) with severe pneumonia in ITU early in the current outbreak were found to be positive for SARS-CoV-2 in six bronchoalveolar lavage fluid samples and five oral swabs by quantitative PCR and conventional PCR, supportive of a respiratory transmission route. 3 Virus has also been detected in patient stool samples. 19 Fomite spread via contaminated surfaces is also probable, based on SARS-CoV. [25] [26] [27] Nosocomial spread is also a significant concern. 28 The mean incubation period is brief, reported as 5.2 days, with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days (95% confidence interval 9.2-18). 12 One case documented an incubation period of just 3 days. 22 However, it is not completely clear yet when a patient becomes infectious within this time frame. Asymptomatic carriage of virus has been documented; in a 10-year-old boy who also showed lung infiltrates on CT. 28 Asymptomatic transmission of the virus was reported in a cluster of co-workers in Bavaria; however subsequent information refuted this, with the index patient confirming that they already had mild symptoms (myalgia, fatigue and use of an antipyretic analgesic) at the time of transmission. 29, 30 The relative contribution of asymptomatic carriage or transmission (if such can be confirmed) to the overall disease burden remains unclear.",

Additionally, major journals and publishers including The Lancet and Elsevier have responded to calls from the Wellcome Trust to make publications relevant to the outbreak immediately available free of charge, promoting wide dissemination of crucial early biological, epidemiological and clinical data. 32 Although the known severity of COVID-19 disease ranges from mild symptoms of upper respiratory tract infection (with or without fever) to severe pneumonia, most reported cases are at the mild end of the spectrum. At the time of writing, if COVID-19 infection is seen in the UK, it is most likely to occur in travellers that have recently returned from specified countries and areas; or had contact with a known case. Therefore, an accurate history including travel is a key component of risk identification. \u25a0",
