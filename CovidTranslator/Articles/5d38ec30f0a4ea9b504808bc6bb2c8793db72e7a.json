Ideally these control points should include all steps or procedures involved in food handling from farm to fork, including food production, storage, transportation, delivery, and consumption.

They can be classified as five genotypes from GI to GV based on the nucleotide sequences of the capsid protein and polymerase. A total of eight genotypes out of 29 known genotypes of norovirus cause infection in humans. According to the U. S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), noroviruses are responsible for 70% and 50% of waterborne and foodborne enteritis, respectively [11] . The symptoms of foodborne norovirus include vomiting, gastralgia, fever, diarrhea, and death due to dehydration in children and elderly. Norovirus is very stable in the environment and highly contagious, requiring only a low infectious dose, as doses smaller than 10 2 copies/mL may cause infection in humans [12] . The virus strongly resists heat up to 60\u00b0C, as well as acid and chlorine in tap water up to 6.25 mg/L, which make its prevention and clearance difficult. Norovirus is transmitted through daily activities, water, and food. Contaminated food by food handlers is an important transmission route. The virus causes 19-21 million illness in the United States annually [13] . It is reported that 50% of the infection occurs in food related locations, such as cruise ships, school cafeterias, and restaurants [11] . Hence the detection of foodborne norovirus is critically important for human health.",

Since technologies of bacterial detection cannot be applied directly to virus detection, (refer to Section 8.5 Current Challenges and Future Trends for more detail) this review focuses on the current limited foodborne virus detection, and the possibilities of adopting technologies and devices indirectly from bacterial studies, basic virus studies, and human clinical virus studies. This needs intensive exploration of these indirectly related technologies to make them fit the specific requirements of foodborne virus detection and measurement. [31] . The paper test strip is immersed in the urine sample for a few seconds and after a few minutes; the colour resulting from the reaction can be visually compared against the chromatic scale provided.

Microfluidics has been ongoing in its evolution with microfabrication technology since its invention in the early 1990s. Fluid for testing is transported either passively through capillary forces or actively through pumping to achieve laminar fluid flow. Automated control of all steps can reduce human errors and increase accuracy, reproducibility, and reliability of test results. The opportunities for testing different samples simultaneously make microfluidics a perfect candidate in multiplexing. Two types of microfluidic systems are currently available in foodborne virus detection: micro total analysis system and the paper based analytical system. Micro total analysis system is mostly designed as devices with lab-on-a-chip features [39, 40] . Its advantages are using fluid as a working medium and integrating different functionalities on a scale, which allow complicated molecular techniques to be completed at once, such as immunoassays and polymerase chain reaction (PCR).

Nanomaterials play a major role in biosensor design for foodborne virus assay, and enable faster, sensitive, specific, and cost-effective detection outside of laboratory. This review describes their advantages, principles, and limitations with regard to their multiplexing capability, sensitivity, and simplicity (Table 2 ). [70] In nanomaterials, gold nanoparticles and quantum dots are the most commonly used materials. However, new forms of nanomaterials are being developed to represent more molecular entities and to be more amenable to nanoscale fabrication [48] . Another promising material is magnetic nanoparticles, with advantages of easy manipulation and cost-effectiveness. They can be combined with a capturing agent, such as a DNA probe, a glycan molecule, or an antibody, to target DNA or protein molecules of interest. For foodborne viruses, the earlier detection is to determine viral nucleic acid; and viral protein measurement is a later detection.

A visible color from red to blue can be produced variously with colorimetric detectability (Figure 4 ). An advanced example of plasmonic nanomaterials is direct aggregation, without specific ligands between a single-stranded primer DNA, and its adsorption on citrate-coated Au gold nanoparticles. On the other hand, indirect aggregation can be used to detect viruses through modifying virus targeting molecules on virus surfaces. The challenging key to this technology is controlling particle aggregation in a reproducible manner. This can be improved using a protein-glycan pairing relying on the multivalence properties of glycan to improve weak protein detection of viral surface proteins. Another advanced improvement is signal amplification using catalytic or DNA enzymatic assays, such as alkaline phosphatase catalyst, and DNA enzymes to provide rapid detection of virus sequences.",

Different chemical tags can be added to aptamers to increase flexibility without affecting affinity. Their lower molecular weight enhances the stability to sustain repetitious denaturation and renaturation. Aptasensor, due to its advantages, is increasingly explored, particularly in intact virus detection using SPR and other platforms [127] . Aptasensors are biosensors utilising aptamers as bioreceptors to combine different conductors for selective molecular application and recognition [128] . The combination of multi-purpose aptamers and multi-function conductors, such as electrochemical, optical and mass conductors, facilitates the use of aptasensors in both pathogen and chemical detection (Figure 8 ).

The opportunity to apply bacterial detection techniques to virus is low because bacteria are easier to be cultured and amplified, but virus culture and amplification are difficult and cannot be enriched in most cases [35] . Moreover viruses cannot replicate in host free environments and is almost always found in low numbers in the complex food matrices. The size of viruses ranges from 20 to 400 nm, while the size of bacteria ranges from 1 micron to 5 microns. Due to the extremely smaller size of viruses, the sensing platforms developed for bacteria need to be extensively modified for the detection of virus particles. In addition, the composition of cell surface (peptidoglycan) proteins of bacteria is not comparable with the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase compositions of viruses, and the biorecognition elements has to be tailor made to create the binding with the proteins. Along with smaller sizes, absence of cell wall and ribosomes in the viruses in comparison to the bacteria also allows for changes in the localized microenvironment towards the development of biosensing platforms. Considering the factors of bacterial detection techniques that cannot be used for viral detection, and that viruses often present with lower copy numbers than bacteria in food samples, this situation demands superior sensitivity of the virus detection devices to be at least attomolar or picomolar level.",
