Establishing a rational immunization protocol for clients can be a challenging endeavor for most practitioners. Vaccination protocols should be based on potential exposure, prevalence of disease in your local area and susceptibility of camelids to these diseases. Unlike some other species (e.g., feline, equine) in the United States, currently, no established guidelines exist for vaccination of camelids.",

At present, many camelid farms follow what successful breeders use in other parts of the country without regard for regional concerns. Although many vaccines are currently used in the United States, not all camelids need all of the vaccines discussed below. As with other animal species, vaccine programs should be tailored for individual producers and their current needs.",

Although recommendations vary with regard to time of first vaccine, these vaccines are typically given twice at 3-to 6-week intervals in the first year and then boostered annually after the primary series. It is known that camelids are susceptible to these pathogens, and several studies have shown antibody response after two injections. 1 In some high-risk areas, the primary vaccines are started at age 2 to 5 days. Another protocol would be to start the vaccination series at age 3 to 4 months in crias that obtained good passive transfer and whose dams were previously vaccinated. Booster vaccines are generally recommended for animals undergoing surgical procedures or for animals that have suffered open wounds from trauma if the last vaccine was given more than 6 months ago. Many practitioners recommend boosting CDT vaccines 4 to 6 weeks prior to birthing in pregnant dams. Be cautious of rough handling or excessive excitement during the vaccine administration procedure, as camelids are considered prone to stress-induced abortions.",
