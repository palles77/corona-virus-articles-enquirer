In this study, a prediction model is proposed to evaluate the infection risk of non-human-origin coronavirus for early warning. Methods: The spike protein sequences of 2666 coronaviruses were collected from 2019 Novel Coronavirus Resource (2019nCoVR) Database of China National Genomics Data Center on Jan 29, 2020. A total of 507 humanorigin viruses were regarded as positive samples, whereas 2159 non-human-origin viruses were regarded as negative. To capture the key information of the spike protein, three feature encoding algorithms (amino acid composition, AAC; parallel correlation-based pseudo-amino-acid composition, PC-PseAAC and G-gap dipeptide composition, GGAP) were used to train 41 random forest models. The optimal feature with the best performance was identified by the multidimensional scaling method, which was used to explore the pattern of human coronavirus. Results: The 10-fold cross-validation results showed that well performance was achieved with the use of the GGAP (g = 3) feature. The predictive model achieved the maximum ACC of 98.18% coupled with the Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) of 0.9638. Seven clusters for human coronaviruses (229E, NL63, OC43, HKU1, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2) were found. The cluster for SARS-CoV-2 was very close to that for SARS-CoV, which suggests that both of viruses have the same human receptor (angiotensin converting enzyme II). The big gap in the distance curve suggests that the origin of SARS-CoV-2 is not clear and further surveillance in the field should be made continuously. The smooth distance curve for SARS-CoV suggests that its close relatives still exist in nature and public health is challenged as usual. Conclusions: The optimal feature (GGAP, g = 3) performed well in terms of predicting infection risk and could be used to explore the evolutionary dynamic in a simple, fast and large-scale manner. The study may be beneficial for the surveillance of the genome mutation of coronavirus in the field.",

The infection risk of coronavirus in animals should be analyzed and a prediction model should be constructed for early warning. For this purpose, machine-learning methods appear to be ideal tools [9, 10] . The spike protein on the surface of the viral particle plays key roles in the binding of the cell receptor and membrane fusion [3, 11] , by which the host range is firmly determined [8] . In this study, we screened the features of the spike protein using three encoding algorithms and predicted the cross-species infection of coronaviruses with the random forest method.

As shown in Fig. 4a , the distance curve between SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses had two gaps. The Fig. 4b , the distance curve between SARS-CoV and other coronaviruses also had a gap of value 0.03, which is similar to that of SARS-CoV-2. The two gaps at 0.03 suggest that coronaviruses close to SARS-CoV-2 s or SARS-CoVs form a separate group. We further checked the coronaviruses close to SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV (< 0.03) and found that these close relatives were the same. The results were similar to those from the MDS method and confirmed that SARS-CoV-2 s and SARS-CoVs have the same origin. Moreover, the big gap at 0.02 suggests that the origin of SARS-CoV-2 s is not clear and further surveillance in the field should be made continuously. The smooth curve for SARS-CoVs shows that its close relatives still exist in nature and public health is challenged as usual.",

As considerable coronaviruses have been isolated from bats and other animals, it is believed that there is a viral gene reservoir in wild animals [7] . Coronavirus can directly cross the species barrier and infect humans with a severe syndrome [8] . As an antigen that is novel for a human host, public health is being challenged seriously. With the use of the viral spike protein, in this study, the infection risk of non-human-origin coronavirus was analyzed and a prediction model was constructed for early warning to prevent disease. The spike protein on the surface of the viral particle plays key roles in the binding of the cell receptor and membrane fusion [3, 11] , by which the host range is firmly determined [8] . In the study, we choose the spike protein as a candidate target to predict the cross-species infection of coronaviruses using the RF method. For the spike protein of coronavirus, the sequence lengths were different and sequence identities were very low between remote relatives, which caused the problem of alignment and challenged the algorithms used to model biology data. For analysis and modeling in a simple, fast and massive manner, we used three different feature encoding algorithms from multiple perspectives, such as compositional information and, position-related information, in addition to physicochemical properties. The computation of protein features did not require multiple sequence alignment and reduced the computational complexity.",

            "text": "Although many proteins contribute to the procedure of virus production and host invasion, the spike protein is the most important factor to determine host range [8, 19, 20] . A long sequence of the viral genome should be considered in further study to increase the performance of the prediction model. However, applying the algorithm for about 30 000 dimensions of data and small number of samples will be a challenge. In the study, the infection risk of non-human-origin coronavirus was evaluated for early warning and good performance was achieved. The main limitation was that only viral spike proteins were used to build the prediction model and social factors, such as traffic conditions, population size, and citizens habits in daily life, were not involved. Although high risk could be predicted in the view of the pathogen, comprehensive judgment should be used to prevent disease in the future.",

The major contribution of this predictor is that a set of informative features of viral proteins from 41 feature descriptors, such as compositional, position-specific and physicochemical information, were learned using a machine learning algorithm. The 10-fold cross-validation results showed that good performance was achieved with the use of the GGAP (g = 3) feature. The optimal feature performed well in terms of predicting infection risk and was used to explore the dynamic of evolution in a simple, fast, and massive manner. This study may be beneficial for coronavirus surveillance and future study on the cross-species transmission of coronavirus.",
