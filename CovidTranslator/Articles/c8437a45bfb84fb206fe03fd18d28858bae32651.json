Hematological parameters including blood 117 routine, blood biochemistry, coagulation profile, and infection-related biomarkers 118 were recorded. Plasma cytokine interleukin 6 (IL-6) levels were detected by ELISA. 119 And the CD4 + and CD8 + T cell subsets were counted using flow cytometry. 120 Statistical analysis 121 We presented continuous measurements as median (IQR) and categorical variables 122 as number (%). Continuous variables were analyzed using the Mann-Whitney test. 123 For laboratory results, we also assessed whether the measurements were outside the 124 normal range.

As most patients remain hospitalized, we focus on the clinical and 179 laboratory profiles upon their admission. Epidemiological research shows that most 180 patients have been to Wuhan recently. Common symptoms were fever, cough, and 181 chest tightness. However, a significant proportion of patients presented with atypical 182 symptoms such as fatigue, muscle soreness and diarrhea. We also pay attention to 183 patients without fever in which cough may be the only or primary symptom. 184 Therefore, to avoid further transmission, screening and closely monitoring of each 185 suspect remain important. Further studies on the epidemiological characteristics of 186 these atypical cases are recommended. 187 The most common laboratory abnormalities observed in this study were decreased 188 total lymphocytes, prolonged APTT, elevated LDH, CRP and ESR. Similarities 189 abnormalities between COVID-19 and previously observed betacoronavirus, 190 MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV infection, have been noted [3, 6, 7].

Similar to 205 SARS-CoV, angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2) is also the cellular entry 206 receptor of COVID-19 [9, 10]. ACE2 is highly expressed in human lung tissue, 207 gastrointestinal tract, vascular endothelial cells and arterial smooth muscle cells [11]. 208 Therefore, all of the organs above may be targets for virus attack. ACE2 effectively 209 hydrolyzes the potent vasoconstrictor angiotensin II to angiotens and is related to 210 hypertension, cardiac function and diabetes [12]. Liu et al. discovered that the 211 Angiotensin II level in the plasma samples increased markedly, suggesting that 212 COVID-19 could induce imbalanced renin-angiotensin system. Drugs of ACE 213 inhibitor (ACEI) and angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) may be used as potential 214 treatment of COVID-19 infection [13]. As we can see, in patients with underlying 215 diseases, most of them have hypertension.

It is crucial to determine host tropism and transmission capacity in 229 terms of prevention of the virus infection [16]. Spike (S) protein mediates membrane 230 fusion through binding with ACE2.
