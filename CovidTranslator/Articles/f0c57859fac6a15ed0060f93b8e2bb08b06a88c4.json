The knowledge derived from ancient and traditional systems of medicine has now transcended to the modern pharmaceutical industry. The focus of any phytochemical research is often to discover new drugs or drug leads from medicinal plants. One of the important issues in medicinal plant research is the appropriate selection of target plant species that may provide lead to new drugs.",

For example, the discovery of dicoumarol from fatal cattle poisoning from Melilotus officinalis was simply a serendipitous discovery (Kubinyi, 1999) , which then led to the development of the well-known anticoagulant warfarin ( Fig. 2.1 ). Conducting research without any working hypotheses may produce such unexpected discoveries, but the chances of success are much slimmer than any targeted approach. Research on medicinal plants, thus, requires a thorough knowledge of their various properties that may reflect the hitherto unknown medicinal properties from the plants. Challenges lie in devising appropriate methods to uncover the existing or potential medicinal properties as well as selecting the right plants that may fulfil these criteria.",

Efficacies of the herbal medicine or phytotherapy in their treatment of several diseases may sometimes be linked to placebo effects, but often involve active natural products mostly of low molecular weight that possess 'drug-like' properties. Earliest known investigation of bioactive plants dates back to 3000 BCE with Egyptians scrolls detailing these plants along with their medicinal properties. Modern study of bioactive compounds isolated from living organisms for therapeutic purposes began around 200 years ago with the isolation of morphine by F.W. Serturner (Schmitz, 1985) .

However, sometimes the progress in medicinal plant research has somehow been negatively impacted by the introduction of various modern technology-based developments in synthetic medicinal chemistry, e.g., combinatorial chemistry, and by the sheer completion in library-based highthroughput-screening (HTS) process in modern drug discovery scene. However, the inherent chemical diversity and structural novelty that natural products offer are the best, and for this very reason, natural products or drug discovery from plant remains as one of the main sources of new drugs. One of the bottlenecks in phytochemical drug discovery is probably the arduous protocols, and in addition, the overall cost in conventional plant drug discovery methodologies sometimes can be prohibitive for any drug discovery initiative when it comes to cost-effectiveness. To mitigate some of these issues, various stages of plantbased drug discovery programmes require much smarter approach and incorporation of new computational approaches coupled with mathematical models. Thousands of structurally diverse bioactive compounds have evolved during plant development and evolutionary processes, sometimes to offer plant the necessary protection against herbivores and pathogens, while some others to serve as signal compounds to facilitate reproduction, as antioxidants and UV protectants. Isolation and analysis of potential bioactive phytochemicals may include generation of a hypothesis of the target receptor for a particular disorder and the subsequent screening of the in vitro and/or in vivo biological activities of the candidate drug. The major challenge in phytochemistry is to describe and understand the diversity of these molecules, their modes of action, and determination of their natural combinations found in plants (Sarker and Nahar, 2012; Wink, 2015) . However, right at the beginning of any plant-based drug discovery programme, probably the most important task is to appropriately select the medicinal plants from a vast array of plants available on the earth that may possess expected or desired bioactivity.",

Apart from these, various techniques and approaches have been attempted to predict potential medicinal activity of plants. One of such attempts is application of phylogenetic methods and chemotaxonomic understanding to determine the pattern of evolution of various groups of specialized metabolites and deriving a correlation between phylogeny and biosynthetic pathways (R\u00f8nsted et al., 2012) .

A Markov process, named after the Russian mathematician Andrey Markov, is a stochastic process that satisfies the Markov property. Simply, a process satisfies the Markov property only if one can predict the future of the process based solely on its present state just as well as one could know the process's full history.

It is a computerized mathematical technique or algorithm that allows people to account for risk in quantitative analysis and decision-making. Monte Carlo simulation offers the decision-maker with a range of possible outcomes and the probabilities they will occur for any choice of action. This simulation technique came as a useful application in the time of Markov Chain processes. In principle, Monte Carlo methods can be used to solve any problem having a probabilistic interpretation. By the law of large numbers, integrals described by the expected value of some random variables can be approximated by taking the empirical mean of independent samples of the variables. When the probability distribution of the variable is parameterized, mathematicians often use a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampler (Del Moral et al., 2006; Kroese et al., 2014) . MCMC estimated value preserves the actual variance. Monte Carlo simulation has several advantages over deterministic or 'single-point estimate' analysis. Some of those advantages are: An enhancement to Monte Carlo simulation is the use of Latin Hypercube sampling (LHS), which samples more accurately from the entire range of distribution functions. LHS, first introduced by McKay in 1979, is a statistical method for generating a near-random sample of parameter values from a multidimensional distribution (McKay et al., 1979; Tang, 1993) . The sampling method is often used to construct computerized experiments or for Monte-Carlo integration.",

Molecules sharing favourable interactions will possess similar biological effects. Therefore, novel compounds can be determined through analysis of a protein's binding site. Prerequisite for this approach is structural information that can be accessed for target databases.

Evaluation of appropriate binding pocket is usually performed through the analysis of known target-ligand co-crystal structures. Alternative method is to use in silico methods for identifying novel binding sites. When the experimental structures are not available or absent, computational models are utilized for predicting the 3D structure of the target proteins. Target structure may be predicted based on a template with a similar sequence by the process called comparative modelling. It is based on the belief that protein structure is better conserved than sequence that is proteins with similar sequences have similar structures.

Homology modelling is a popular computation method for predicting the 3D coordinates of structures. Homology modelling, also known as comparative modelling of protein, actually refers to constructing an atomic-resolution model of the target protein from its amino acid sequence and an experimental 3D structure of a related homologous protein, which is commonly referred to as the template. The basis of this approach is the fact that evolution-related proteins often share similar structures. The protein structure generally remains more conserved than the sequence during evolution. As such, understanding structures having amino acid sequences similar to the target sequence of interest may assist in predicting the target structure, function, and possible binding and functional sites (Leelananda and Lindert, 2016) . Application of homology modelling has emerged as the main alternative to get a 3D representation of the target in the absence of crystal structures (Aparoy et al., 2012) . Combination of homology modelling and docking studies has contributed to identification of oxidosqualene cyclases associated with primary and secondary metabolism of Centella asiatica (Kumar et al., 2013) and understanding the structure and function of chalcone synthase protein from Coleus forskohlii.",

To improve the predictions of drug likeness, the rules have seen many extensions, such as polar surface area no greater than 140 \u00c5 2 , molecular weight ranging from 180 to 500, molar refractivity from 40 to 130, partition coefficient in \u22120.4 to +5.6 range, etc. Before initial virtual HTS, molecules are filtered based on predicted ADMET properties.

In any drug discovery process, lipophilicity and molecular weight are often increased to improve the affinity and selectivity of the drug candidate. As a result, it is often difficult to maintain strict drug likeness as per RO5 during hit and lead optimization. It has been proposed that members of libraries should be biased toward lower molecular weight and lipophilicity. The rule of five has been extended to the rule of three for defining lead-like compounds as per following criteria (Congreve et al., 2003) :",

Thus, QSAR method cannot be directly applicable for prediction of bioactivity of polyherbal medicine. Despite that, variation of biological activity of herbal medicine is also associated with the variation of their chemical composition. Considering this relationship, another relationship called quantitative composition activity relationship (QCAR) has been proposed to establish relationship between chemical composition and biological activity .

By addressing the true complexity of disease and by seeking to harness the ability of drugs to influence many different proteins, network pharmacology differs from conventional drug discovery approaches, which have usually been based on highly specific targeting of a single protein. Network pharmacology has the potential to provide new treatments for complex diseases, where conventional approaches have failed to deliver satisfactory therapies. With the advancement of bioinformatics, systems biology, and polypharmacology, network-based drug discovery has provided promises toward cost-effective drug discovery and development in traditional herbal medicine.

Conventionally, targeted approach (Mann et al., 2000) is favourable, where certain medicinal plants are prioritized, and even though expensive, depends on generation of working hypothesis and performing experimental studies on the bases of the hypothesis. In this approach, careful selection and choosing the right criteria for the targeted botanical species usually determine the outcome. Considering the diversity of the higher plant, selection of candidate species for the bioprospecting programme is not an easy task. Out of total number of higher plants (estimated 400,000 angiosperms and 1000 gymnosperms), only about 6% have been screened for biological activity and about 15% for phytochemical properties (Rates, 2001) . Various research institutes and pharmaceutical industries have taken up different approaches that can be categorized into four broad groups-ethnobotany-directed, random selection, chemotaxonomic, and integrated approach, respectively.

In the drug discovery procedure, plants possessing potential medicinal properties are recognized through ethnobotanical field studies or literature. Such plants are further investigated for bioactive properties in the laboratories for pure compound isolation. Preparation procedure of traditional recipe may provide an indication of best extraction protocol. Formulation method may provide primary information about pharmacological activity, optimal doses, and suitable mode of application of the future drug (Rates, 2001) . Ethno-directed approach was initiated by scientists like Luis Lewin, Carl Hartwich, Alexander Tschirch, and Richard Evans Schultes by applying molecular interpretation of the pharmacologically active plants in 19th and early part of 20th century (Gertsch, 2009) . During the early phase of ethno-directed approach, anthropologists worked in tandem with chemists and pharmacologists resulting in isolation of various drug molecules such as caffeine and quinine (Fig. 2.5) . However, in spite of the richness of the ethnopharmacological surveys worldwide and diversity of traditional knowledge, many of the collected data could not be translated successfully into bioprospecting programmes (Albuquerque et al., 2014) .",

Regression analysis of medicinal plant families is a unique method for predicting plant families with large number of medicinal plants. The method was first introduced by Moerman in his classical work (Moerman, 1991) . The work concerned prediction of the families having the large number of potential medicinal plants based on linear regression analysis. After that work, there have been many applications of the approach as well as many derivations including Bayesian approach, which challenges the earlier regression methods (Bennett and Husby, 2008; Moerman, 2012) . However, application of regression analysis still remains a popular method and helps in identification of plant orders and families favoured by traditional healers among ethnomedicinal plants of South Africa, proving that the use of these plants by traditional healers is not random (Douwes et al., 2008) . There was an attempt to apply mathematical and logical method of replacing rare herbs and simplifying traditional Chinese medicine formula and its applicability in the perspective of pathway enrichment analysis (Fang et al., 2013) .",

Chemical plant taxonomy, or simply chemotaxonomy of plants, focuses on the classification of plants based on their chemical composition, i.e. secondary metabolites. The selection highlights the chemical taxonomy of acetylenic compounds, the distribution of fatty acids in plant lipids, distribution of aliphatic polyols, cyclitols, plant glycosides, and alkaloids. Chemotaxonomy is a method of biological classification based on similarities in the structure of certain compounds produced by the organisms in question, e.g., plants. As proteins are more closely controlled by the genes and less subjected to natural selection than are anatomical features, they are more reliable indicators of genetic relationships or phylogeny. This approach may become significant, when a particular compound class is desirable with known biological activity. A good example of this approach is targeting Datura stramonium for tropane alkaloids, with the knowledge that Atropa belladonna contains the alkaloid hyoscyamine, subsequently leading to the discovery of similar alkaloid hyoscine (Fig. 2.6) (Heinrich et al., 2012) .",

This approach is based on the ecological plant defence theory (Coley et al., 2003) . For instance, absence of predation might suggest presence of toxic chemicals. Many phytochemicals that are toxic to insects also exhibit biological activity in humans and might be exploited for therapeutic applications. Observation of the plan\u0165s environment that reflects the toxicological properties of the plant led to the isolation of many antibacterial drugs. The ecological approach to select plant material relies on the observation of interactions between organisms and their environment that might lead to the production of bioactive natural compounds. The hypothesis underpinning this approach is that secondary metabolites, e.g., in plant species, possess ecological functions that may have also therapeutic potential for humans. For example, metabolites involved in plant defence against microbial pathogens may be useful as antimicrobials in humans, or secondary products defending a plant against herbivores through neurotoxic activity could have beneficial effects in humans due to a putative central nervous system activity (Barbosa et al., 2012) .",

            "text": "Major potential limitation of this approach lies in the classification of medicinal plant use (Ernst et al., 2016) . Before analysing the medicinal plants in a phylogenetic context, medicinal plant documented or collected need to be classified according to the diseases used to treat in ethnomedicinal system. Some common widely used classifications are International Classification of Diseases (ICD) of the WHO and the classification of Cook developed as Economic Botany Data Collection Standards (Cook, 1995) . These classification systems could not fully capture the complexity and idiosyncrasy of local healthcare systems. At the same time, these systems are based on categories reflecting systems of the human body or symptoms. These systems provide little information in disease etiology and potential underlying biological activity of the medicinal plants. In recent years, more extensive studies in cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying diseases have been carried out providing more information on disease etiology. Alternative approaches in phylogenetic systems emerge by using classification based on modulating the disease response (Ernst et al., 2016) . For the taxonomic classification, the current default classification is usually the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group IV (APG IV, 2016). It is because categorization and assemblage of plant species within a particular category or sub-categories needs to be based on phylogenetic relationship and APG being the most common among the practicing taxonomists. Theoretically, of the various chemical compounds used, most reliable are the semantides (DNA, RNA, and proteins) that provide more reliable taxonomic information. However, in the practical application, the approach is far from perfection and many researchers are still trying on other compound types. One such instance is that the application of graph-clustering algorithm on the metabolite content of the plant led to the successful classification of 217 plants in Japan (Liu et al., 2017) . The approach provides successful result even in incomplete metabolite data by obtaining consistent relationship between plant clusters and known evolutional relationship of plants. This finding led to the application of predictive power of metabolite content in exploring medicinal properties in plants. As such, apart from establishing correlation between the plant group and chemical properties, development of reliable cluster analysis with visual representation of dendrogram remains the fundamental step. All these processes need selection of appropriate clustering algorithms with application of computational tools.",

This approach has made effective contributions to the development of drugs for many diseases (Albuquerque et al., 2014) . There are two approaches in the random screening. In the first approach, plants are screened for selected class of compounds like alkaloids, flavonoids, coumarins, or lignans. This approach usually does not provide any idea of the biological efficacies. Second approach screens randomly selected plants for selected bioassays, through focused screening as well as general screening. The Central Drug Research Institute, India, started this approach three decades back. Though the institute has screened about 2000 plants for biological efficacy, the screening could not provide any new drug (Katiyar et al., 2012) . In the United States, the National Cancer Institute of National Institute of Health screened about 35,000 plants for anticancer activity spanning two decades from 1960 to 1982, resulting in discovery of chemotypes including those of taxanes and camptothecin ( Fig. 2.8 ) (Cragg and Newman, 2005) .

Computational and mathematical tools are extensively applied in this approach. Related information for a particular species are integrated into a database for prioritizing the screening process. Hypothesis generation and subsequent analysis requires careful assembly, overlay, and comparison of data from divergent sources. Importance of database-driven information sharing in drug discovery can be demonstrated by large-scale production of taxol ( Fig. 2.8) . In 1962, a team of researchers in National Cancer Institute in US discovered that extracts of Pacific yew (Taxus brevifolia) contained cytotoxic activity. In 1977, the team confirmed the bioactive component of the extract as paclitaxel, also known by its trade name taxol. After starting clinical phase I in 1984 against number of cancer types, taxol was approved by the FDA for the treatment of ovarian cancer and breast cancer. However, supply of paclitaxel was a major challenge as this compound is found in the thin bark of Taxus in extremely low concentration. The bark from a single tree could provide only a single dose for clinical trial leading to the destruction of whole plant. Large-scale production of taxol was made by developing several pathways to derive 10-deactyl-baccatin III, a non-cytotoxic precursor of taxol. This precursor was initially isolated in France (Institute de Chimie des Substances Naturelles, Gif-sur-Yvette) from the needles of European yew Taxus baccata by the French scientists (Ravi\u00f1a, 2011) . One kilogram of fresh needles can provide 1 g of precursor, making it possible for large-scale supply of taxol. In this way, modern drug discovery approaches relied on various information resources.",

Dozens of databases and Internet resources are available on the internet providing various types of information for the last decades. Development of an inclusive database with information about classification, activity, and ready to dock library of medicinal plant compounds is essential for drug designing using resources of medicinal plants (Mumtaz et al., 2017) . If one particular database could not provide a complete picture of a medicinal plant, data mining and sharing from different resources may be utilized. Such items need unique identification number for a particular plant or a particular entity. These databases are required to provide phytochemical and pharmacological information on medicinal plants. Number of medicinal plant databases increases year by year with specialized or comprehensive information giving opportunity for the study of plants and the utilization of traditional knowledge. For instance, development of Global Natural Products Social Molecular Networking curated information and enabled sharing of raw, processed, or identified tandem mass spectrometry data (Wang et al., 2016) . Another example of curating specialized data are plant protein interaction data, such as IntAct, The Arabidopsis Information Resource and BioGRID, etc. (Lee et al., 2010) . Data curated on medicinal plant databases need to be comprehensive as far as possible to serve as important resources for drug discovery studies. Aggregation of these data allows researchers to visualization, data mining, and further analysis to produce new insights. Aggregations would be unachievable if the data are dispersed within largely inaccessible formats (Rodriguez et al., 2009) . Challenges encountered during aggregating data arising from different formats can be mitigated by ontological linking as well as introduction of noSQL data model (Ningthoujam et al., 2014) . With the rapidly expanding information derived from various analytical and exploratory activities, the role of medicinal plant databases is also progressively increasing to house all these available information. Availability of comprehensive information about a particular plant species or plant groups would accelerate the analysis and prediction of their medicinal properties.",

Data mining methods use various kinds of information obtained from sources such as bibliographic literature, experimental data, clinical data, and curated data. Vast amount of data stored in these databases are screened to identify potential natural products. In the data mining approaches, random selection approach does not consider taxonomic affinities, ethnomedicinal contexts, or other intrinsic qualities. However, random screening is associated with extremely low probability of discovery of useful compounds (Yea et al., 2016) . Considering the limitations of random selection, some advanced methods have been proposed. For instance, a simple scoring system for searching the local alternatives to Phytolacca dodecandra was developed in ways that are more complex. Despite the applications of simple scoring, regression analysis, or a logical formula method in data mining from random selection, successful mining of vast body of information and knowledge pertaining to biology, medicine, and botany is far from complete. Still today, mining of biomedical data to unearth knowledge or generate hypothesis is an active research field. One major innovation is inclusion of semantic information of the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) thesaurus to cluster documents of MEDLINE database (Yea et al., 2016) . In the approach, three categories containing terms related to herbal compounds, efficacy, toxicity, and the metabolic processes, were selected and subjected to similarity measurement method. Application of this novel approach in data mining could predict herbs by 500% more accurately with similar efficacy as compared to random selection. Association rule mining is one of the powerful tools to derive the relationship between different factors with the properties of Chinese traditional medicines. As the data mining aims at extracting structured information or discovering new knowledge from large data, one of the prerequisites is data availability (Lee, 2015) . So, data mining techniques are intricately related with the advancement in technology and curation of medicinal plant databases.",

There may be interactions between drugs, foods, and other herbal products if taken concomitantly. Considering these aspects, there is increased concern on the safety assessment of herbs with various protocols and guidance documents have been issued. Documents issued by the International Life Sciences Institute, the Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry, the European Medicines Agency, and the European Food Safety Authority discuss the assessment of safety of herbs for using in foods and medicines. Assessment of safety of herbal products, either as pre-market assessment or post-market surveillance, is subject to challenges. Data deficiencies with regard to quantity and the quality of information are the major factors. For efficient assessment, proper information of adverse reactions, ideal product quality, composition of herbal formulae, and toxicity of the constituents are required. Integration of all these parameters can reduce the uncertainty in decision-making and can be fulfilled if all the available information are in a knowledge base. Development of these knowledge base requires integration of various data sources and mapping different information (e.g., toxicity, bioassay, herbal formulae, and contraindications) arising from diverse domains.",

Predictive toxicology contributes to the aim in transforming toxicology testing from primarily observational science to a truly predictive science for the benefit of drug development, chemical risk assessment, and food safety, using mathematical and computational tools. Predictive toxicology deals with the development of new non-animal tests that do not simply duplicate existing animal tests, but offer a new scientific basis for safety testing. It reflects a significant shift away from adverse effects observed in experimental animals, sometimes at high doses, to analysing the effects of chronic exposures to low concentrations on cells and organ systems. This approach offers the potential for reliable, reproducible, faster, and more cost-effective safety assessment in both new product development, e.g., new drug development, and eventually in regulatory testing and is advantageous when the numbers of individual chemicals to be screened far exceed the capacity for assessment.",

Graphical results: Monte Carlo simulation-generated data can be easily presented in graphs of different outcomes and their chances of occurrence. This is particularly important for informing findings to other stakeholders. 3. Sensitivity analysis: Deterministic analysis sometimes makes it difficult to see which variables influence the outcome the most. However, in Monte Carlo simulation, it is easy to observe which inputs have the biggest effect on bottom-line results. 4. Scenario analysis: It is extremely difficult to model different combinations of values for different inputs to see the effects of truly different scenarios in deterministic models, but Monte Carlo simulation clearly demonstrates correlations between inputs and several values when certain outcomes are achieved. 5. Correlation of inputs: In Monte Carlo simulation, it is possible to model interdependent relationships between input variables.",
