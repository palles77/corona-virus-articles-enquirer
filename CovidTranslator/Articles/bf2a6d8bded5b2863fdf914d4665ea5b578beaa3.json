            "text": "Viruses constitute the simplest and most abundant life form. Replication of viruses is largely dependent on delivery of their genomes to host cells and then usurping functions of target cells to produce proteins that are required to form viral progeny. The mechanisms by which viruses appropriate cellular functions predictably involve some disruption, which is responsible for induction of disease in virus-infected individuals. In addition to viral proteins, host factors are also required to facilitate replication of viruses. Typically, antiviral gene therapy aims to deploy DNA or RNA to achieve a therapeutic effect by inhibiting the expression of viral or host factor genes. A timeline of some of the significant developments and ongoing research efforts in gene therapy for viral infections is illustrated in Figure 12 .1. Capacity of viruses to bypass dependence on host factors is highly constrained; therefore, inhibiting the function of host factors is useful to suppress emergence of escape by the pathogens. This has been useful in developing gene therapy for infections with HIV-1 [1] and hepatitis C virus (HCV) [2] . When using this approach, appropriate target selection is important. If targeted host factors have important cellular functions, then their silencing may cause toxicity. Another method of providing a high barrier to viral infection is through simultaneous inhibition of multiple viral targets using combinatorial approaches.",

For example, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 has a tropism for CD4 + T cells of the immune system, and manifestation of the acquired immune deficiency syndrome results from insidious virus-induced depletion of the infected host T cells. By contrast, infection with Ebola virus follows a rapid and usually fulminant course. Although the prognosis of cases of Ebola virus infection is grave, the pathogen does not persist, and successful treatment is curative. This is different from the situation with HIV-1 infection, in which the stable proviral replication intermediate remains embedded in the genome of infected host cells and makes elimination of the virus very difficult.",

Several improvements in antiviral therapy have been made, and many diseases are now effectively managed. Antivirals comprising small molecules have demonstrated particularly good efficacy against a range of pathogens. Prophylactic immunization and other preventative measures, such as behavioral modification to minimize risks of transmission of viruses, have also contributed to limiting the spread of viral infections. Despite these advances, current therapeutics have inadequate curative efficacy against certain viral infections, and it is likely that disease caused by the pathogens will remain problematic for many years. Mutations may change properties of existing viruses, and new pathogens are likely to emerge. Hence, flexible technology that allows for rapid development of antivirals based on rational design is particularly important to counter the serious health problems that may result. Gene therapy has the potential to be effective against a range of existing and emergent viruses. The technology may also complement and augment efficacy of current antiviral drugs. However, gene therapy is still faced with significant hurdles before it is widely implemented for treatment of viral infections. Particularly important are the specificity of the antiviral nucleic acids for their targets and concerns about efficiency and safety of delivery, costs, and manufacturing capabilities.

Using the procedures to effect immunostimulation is generally easy to implement and has already been tested in clinical trials performed in resource-poor settings.

Two momentous advances in the field have been development of technologies based on gene editing (Chapter 3) and harnessing the naturally occurring RNA interference (RNAi) pathway (Chapter 2). Gene editing is a process by which specific target DNA sequences are altered to inhibit viral replication. Therapy based on this technology is applicable to direct inactivation of viral DNA replication intermediates, such as are produced during proliferation of hepatitis B virus (HBV), or through inhibition of host factors required for replication of a particular virus [6] . RNAi is an endogenous gene regulatory mechanism that typically causes post-transcriptional gene silencing. Artificial RNAi activators, which comprise mimics of intermediates of the pathway and contain homology to intended targets, have been used successfully to inhibit viral gene expression. Exploiting RNAi and gene editing have both generated considerable enthusiasm, and the technology has advanced to use in clinical trials for treatment of viral infections, which include those caused by HBV and HIV-1. Other effective methods of inhibiting viral gene expression included use of antisense oligonucleotides, aptamers and RNase P substrates.",

            "text": "Both expressed and synthetic RNAi activators have been utilized successfully against various viral infections. Considerable effort has gone into ensuring good specificity and potency of the silencers against their viral cognates. Use of Pol III promoters to transcribe RNA that forms short hairpin RNA (shRNA) structures, which mimic precursor microRNAs (pre-miRs), has been particularly popular. However, demonstration that overexpression of HBV-targeting shR-NAs could result in fatal toxicity in mice was an important caveat to researchers in the field [7] . Since this observation, various configurations of expressed RNAi activators have been engineered to improve control of production of the antivirals. Using antiviral mimics of primary microRNAs (pri-miRs) has shown promise against HBV [8, 9] , HCV [10] , and HIV-1 [11, 12] . These RNAi activators may be transcribed from inducible and tissue-specific Pol II promoters. The artificial pri-miRs have been multimerized to result in combinatorial silencing that improves efficacy and provides a greater barrier to viral escape. As mimics of early intermediates of the RNAi pathway, functional coupling of processing of the pri-miR mimics to downstream steps of the pathway is thought to improve potency. Better silencing by antivirals allows for use of lower doses of the candidate therapeutics and diminished off-target effects. Developments with use of synthetic RNAi activators have also been impressive. Typically, synthetic RNAi activators comprise short complementary strands of RNA that constitute short interfering RNAs (siRNAs). Various chemical modifications have been used to augment silencing, diminish immunostimulation, and stabilize the gene silencers. Synthetic procedures are also adaptable for other purposes. One interesting application is the coupling of targeting aptamers to synthetic siRNAs, which enables specific delivery to virus-infected cells [13] [14] [15] [16] . Availability of new methods for bioinformatic analysis has also been important to advance RNAi-based antiviral therapy. Because only the seed region of the guide strand of a potentially therapeutic siRNA is required to effect translational silencing [17] , the likelihood of nonspecific inhibition of cellular targets may be high. However, availability of vast sequence databases and analytical algorithms have allowed for the design of antiviral RNAi activators that have minimal interaction with off-target sites.",

Moreover, in the case of ZFNs and TALENs, two cassettes are required to produce the two monomers that make up the dimeric nucleases. Likewise, typical engineered CRISPR/ Cas systems comprise two cassettes: one encodes the nuclease enzyme and the other the guide RNA. Recombinant adeno-associated viral vectors, popular gene therapy vectors, have a limited capacity for accommodating transgenes. Therefore, complete dimeric nucleases may only be constituted by transduction of cells with two vectors, each expressing one of the monomers. An alternative to this complicated delivery approach is use of nonviral vectors (NVVs) to deliver mRNA encoding the gene editors' subunits. Formulation methods are not limited by the size of the mRNA that may be incorporated into the vectors, and the technique is now becoming more commonly used.",

Once a target has been altered by introduction of mutations, a gene editing nuclease is no longer required. In fact, persistence of the effector is undesirable because the risk for off-target effects is increased. This feature is well suited to using NVVs to deliver nuclease-encoding mRNAs. Durability of gene editing that involves use of targeted transcriptional repressors, such as KRAB, to introduce epigenetic inhibitory effects is not yet well characterized. Transient expression of such repressors may be sufficient to cause the intended durable therapeutic inhibition. Avoiding unwanted effects on the host genome may be particularly useful for treatment of chronic HBV infection with transcriptional repressors. In individuals who are carriers of the virus, HBV DNA is often integrated into the hepatocyte genomes, and nuclease-mediated digestion may induce chromosomal translocations to cause unintended side effects.",

Location of the virus-infected cells is pertinent to devising the appropriate method of delivering the therapeutics. For example, 12.2 Prospects for Antiviral Gene Therapy systemic administration of antivirals may be necessary to disable HBV genes in the liver. However, for treatment of respiratory infections, administration of the therapeutic formulations to the airways is usually more effective. The two main types of delivery vehicles, viral vectors and NVVs, have been discussed in detail in Chapters 4 and 5. Each has particular features that are suited to specific applications to antiviral gene therapy. Viral vectors are efficient carriers of sequences encoding expression cassettes, whereas delivery in vivo of expression cassettes with NVV formulations is usually modest. Because viruses essentially exist as nucleic acids parasites, they have evolved efficient mechanisms of cellular delivery of the nucleic acids, and this property has been exploited to generate viral vectors. Although recombinant viruses are highly capable vectors, they have drawbacks of high costs of production, difficulties with regulating the dose of therapeutics, induction of mutations in transduced cells, and eliciting neutralizing and potentially toxic immunostimulation. Durable expression, particularly by recombinant lentiviral vectors, is useful to achieve sustained antiviral effects, but utility of these vectors for antiviral application is narrow. RNA-based antivirals are growing in popularity, and NVVs are the preferred vectors for delivery of these nucleic acids. Because NVVs do not readily cross the nuclear membrane, the cytoplasmic site of action of antiviral RNAs, which include synthetic siRNAs and mRNAs, is a convenient feature. Various NVVs are under development, and these include lipoplex formulations and polymer conjugates. Because they are based on use of synthetic compounds, NVVs may be prepared on the large scale that is required for clinical application. Moreover, RNA-containing nonviral formulations are appealing because of their limited immunostimulation and avoidance of the mutagenic effects of DNA.",

            "text": "Predicting the long-term role of gene therapy for viral infections is difficult. Apart from the many technical challenges, there are additional factors that will influence the future general use of antiviral gene therapy. When alternative treatment or prevention of a viral infection is effective and easily administered, the importance of antiviral gene therapy may be diminished. An example of such a case could play out with developments in the treatment of HCV infection. Recent progress in HCV therapy using small molecules has been very impressive. The newly licensed combination drug, Harvoni\u2122, produced by Gilead, is rapidly effective against HCV genotype 1 (http://www.gilead.com/news/press-releases/2014). Harvoni contains inhibitors of NS5A and NS5B proteins of HCV, and its administration to patients avoids the need for including interferon-\u03b1 in the regimen. With successful implementation of the new HCV treatments, and if the management becomes widely affordable, the importance of gene therapy for HCV infection may diminish. Miravirsen, a modified oligonucleotide that is antisense to miR-122, has shown good efficacy in clinical trials [2] . Licensing and general use of this candidate host factor-disabling nucleic acid is likely to depend on its economical production and achieving antiviral efficacy that is at least as good as the recently licensed anti-HCV agents. Nevertheless, gene therapy will continue to be important for treating serious infections when cure using other approaches is not possible. Eliminating HBV and HIV-1 are examples where gene therapy is likely to play a role in curing the infections. In the case of chronic HBV infection, persistence of the stable covalently closed circular DNA is unaffected by existing therapies, and the gene editing approach potentially provides the means to disable this intractable viral transcription template. Likewise, use of gene editing to inactivate proviral sequences of HIV-1 or to render CD4 + T cells resistant to infection with the virus should be useful to cure HIV-1 infection.",

Infection with viruses that are causes of serious health problems, such as HIV-1, HBV, and Ebola virus, often occurs in financially impoverished communities. Gene therapy formulations are complicated and expensive to prepare, and it is unlikely that the necessary financial resources are currently available in many of the countries where the infections have the most serious effects. Likewise, gene therapy-based methods may be difficult to execute and require a high level of expertise to implement. An example is the procedures involved with modification of autologous progenitors of CD4 + T cells ex vivo, their selection, and then re-infusion into patients to confer resistance to HIV-1 (Chapter 8). The technology is highly specialized, and a lack of expertise would limit access in some of the communities where treatment of HIV-1 infection is most needed. With improvements in methodologies and advancement of new technologies, it is expected that costs will diminish and procedures for performing gene therapy may become simpler. Ideally, this should result in future broader access of the technology to disadvantaged patients.",
