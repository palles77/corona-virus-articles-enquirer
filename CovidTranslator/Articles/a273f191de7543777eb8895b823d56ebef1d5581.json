CT evaluations included the lobar location and pattern of the lesion. In addition, the outer 1/3 of the lung field was defined as a peripheral distribution, whereas the remainder was defined as a central distribution. In terms of pattern, ground-glass opacity (GGO) was defined as a modest increase in lung attenuation on lung window CT images, not obscuring the pulmonary vessels. Consolidation was defined as high-density patchy opacities, inside which air bronchogram(s) could be observed. Lymphadenopathy was defined as a lymph node >1.0 cm in short-axis diameter.",

This may be related to sample collection as pharyngeal oral and nasal sampling are easier collection methods, whereas lower respiratory tract sampling is relatively difficult to perform, with medical staff susceptible to get infected [16] . The sensitivity of the rRT-PCR kit can also contribute to false negatives. Chung reported that 3 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia showed normal CT findings [2] . In this study, only one patient was observed with positive rRT-PCR but negative CT. Considering that the results of rRT-PCR may be false-negative, and the relatively long assay time, we recommend that the patients with typical imaging findings should be isolated and rRT-PCR repeated to avoid misdiagnosis.",

It remains unclear how many patients in this group will finally be diagnosed with diabetes, but those with high blood fasting glucose level might be more sensitive to COVID-19 pneumonia, which requires further confirmation.
