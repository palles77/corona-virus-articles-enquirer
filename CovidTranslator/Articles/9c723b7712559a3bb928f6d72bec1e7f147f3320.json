We present a reproducible experimental infection model for BRSV in 2-5-month-old, conventionally reared Jersey calves. Thirty-four colostrum-fed calves were inoculated once by aerosol and intratracheal injection with BRSV. Respiratory disease was recorded in 91% of the BRSV-inoculated calves, 72% had an accompanying rise in rectal temperature and 83% exhibited >5% consolidation of the lung tissue. The disease closely resembled natural outbreaks of BRSV-related pneumonia, and detection of BRSV in nasal secretions and lung tissues confirmed the primary role of BRSV. Nine mock-inoculated control calves failed to develop respiratory disease. This model is a valuable tool for the study of the pathogenesis of BRSV and for vaccine efficacy studies.",

            "text": "Early attempts to experimentally reproduce pneumonia with BRSV had limited success, and the role of BRSV in calf pneumonia could therefore not be verified (Belknap et al., 1995) . Thus, Smith et al. (1975) and Castleman et al. (1985) obtained mild clinical disease but very little postmortem evidence of pneumonia following single inoculations of conventionally reared calves, while others only obtained postmortem evidence of BRSV-pneumonia with little or no clinical disease in gnotobiotic calves (Gaddum et al., 1996; Thomas et al., 1984) . When inoculating intratracheally and intranasally for four consecutive days, some authors (Ciszewski et al., 1991; Bryson et al., 1983) reproduced moderate to severe signs of respiratory disease as well as consolidated lung tissue, while others only achieved mild signs of BRSV-infection (Kimman et al., 1987; Otto et al., 1996) . Thus, even when using this rather heavy inoculation regimen, reproducibility of the disease has been inconsistent. However, disease has recently been reproduced in 2-6-month-old calves by single aerosol inoculations with North-American field isolates of BRSV (West et al., 1999; Woolums et al., 1999) . Research in Veterinary Science 74 (2003) 55-65 www.elsevier.com/locate/rvsc In this study we describe a reliable experimental infection model for BRSV in 2-5-month-old conventionally reared Jersey calves using a European field isolate of BRSV. The results presented in the present paper have been accumulated over several years and support the papers published by West et al. (1999) and Woolums et al. (1999) .",

This situation illustrates the effect of the variation in time of onset (1-2 days) and in severity of clinical disease between individual calves on the average values. As a consequence we have also considered the individual peak respiratory rate, peak rectal A Clinical signs and excretion of BRSV from day 0 to day 8 PI and results from necropsy. a According to Fig. 1 temperature and peak titre of BRSV in nasal swabs in the 35 BRSV-infected calves which were killed on day 4 PI and later (Table 2) . Median values were 72 min \u00c01 for peak respiratory rate, 39.9\u00b0C for peak rectal temperature, and 64 (2 6 ) for peak titre of BRSV in nasal swabs. Peak rectal temperature correlated with peak respiratory rate, peak titre in nasal swabs and lung score, and peak respiratory rate correlated with peak titre in nasal swabs and lung score, while peak titre in nasal swabs did not correlate significantly with lung score (Table 3) . Substantial pneumonic lesions, manifested as lobular, dark red, consolidated areas with mucopurulent exudate in the bronchi, were typically detected in the cranioventral parts of the lungs from day 4 PI in BRSV-inoculated calves (Table 1) .

Large amounts of BRSV antigen were found in bronchiolar and alveolar epithelial cells on day 6-8 PI (Fig. 3) . The pathological lesions were clearly associated with the presence of BRSV as a shift in the main lesions from bronchitis to bronchiolitis and alveolitis was observed corresponding to the sites where BRSV was detected.

The pathological lesions seen after the combined aerosol and intratracheal exposure in the present study closely resembled the pathological lesions in acute BRSV-related pneumonia in the field (Bryson, 1993; Kimman et al., 1989; Pirie et al., 1981; Viuff et al., 1996) ; moreover, the infection progressed from the upper to the lower respiratory tract during 4-6 days (Viuff et al., accepted) .

(1990b) were unable to associate isolation rates of mycoplasmas with respiratory disease in calves. Besides, the character of the induced pneumonias in the present study differ from those recorded in experimental infection studies with H. somnus (Jackson et al., 1987) , P. multocida (Gourlay et al., 1989) , and mycoplasmas (Friis, 1980; Friis, 1981; Howard et al., 1976; Tanskanen, 1984) . Hence, though it cannot be ruled out that bacteria or mycoplasmas may have played a contributing role in the clinical course of the disease, the combination of cell culture based inoculum and thorough examination of inocula as well as experimental calves for other bovine pathogens made it possible to exclude that they played a primary etiological role in the present study. Thus, we have by consistent experimental reproduction of moderate to severe disease clearly demonstrated the capability of BRSV as a primary etiologic agent of acute pneumonia in calves.",

This model was capable of inducing clinical signs resembling natural cases of BRSVrelated pneumonia in 80% of the infected conventionally reared calves, and hence mimics the field conditions closely. Consequently, it may be a valuable tool for studying the pathogenesis of BRSV-infection and for vaccine efficacy studies. Studies on these issues have been published elsewhere (Heegaard et al., 2000; Larsen et al., 1998; Larsen et al., 1999; R\u00f8ntved et al., 2000; Uttenthal et al., 2000; Viuff et al., accepted) .",
