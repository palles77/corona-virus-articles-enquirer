Abdominal ultrasonography revealed a focal, circumferential thickening of the wall of the duodenum extending from the pylorus aborally for 3 cm, and an enlarged gastric lymph node. Cytology of fine-needle aspirates of the intestinal mass and lymph node revealed an eosinophilic inflammatory infiltrate and numerous extracellular septate acute angle branching fungal-type hyphae. Occasional hyphae had globose terminal ends, as well as round to oval blastospores and germ tubes. Candida albicans was cultured from a surgical biopsy of the duodenal mass. No underlying host immunodeficiencies were identified. Passage of an abrasive intestinal foreign body was suspected to have caused intestinal mucosal damage resulting in focal intestinal candidiasis. The cat was treated with a short course of oral itraconazole and all clinical signs resolved.",

Lymphoid cells comprised small lymphocytes (54-80%), intermediate lymphocytes (12-34%), large lymphocytes (4-11%) and plasma cells (1-4%). The smears of the duodenal mass were poorly cellular and mainly comprised eosinophils.

Fine needle aspirates of the duodenal mass and gastric lymph node, full-thickness incisional biopsies of the mass, stomach, jejunum and ileum and excisional biopsies of the jejunal and gastric lymph nodes were performed. Repeat cytology of the duodenal mass revealed an eosinophil-rich inflammatory response and intralesional fungal elements (Fig. 3) .

The presence of a single pyogranulomatous intestinal lesion is unusual [7] . No underlying reason could be identified to explain an abnormal or disrupted gastrointestinal intestinal mucosal barrier leading to opportunistic candidiasis. Previously described underlying causes leading to the classical pathway of Candida invasion were not present [8] ; there was no history of antibiotic, anti-acid, glucocorticoid or anti-inflammatory treatment [7] . Furthermore, in humans, the stomach and the duodenum have a physiologically more acidic environment and the lowest number of C. albicans compared to other regions of the gastrointestinal tract. This is likely to be similar in cats and dogs, but has not been confirmed. Hence the stomach and duodenum are unusual sites for candidiasis due to an abnormal or disrupted gastrointestinal microbiome [9] . An abrasive foreign body causing focal mucosal disruption was considered the most likely explanation in this case, even though no foreign material was detected on histopathological examination of multiple sections of the intestinal mass. However, a foreign-body could have caused traumatic intestinal injury during passage without being retained.",

Both pathogenic factors and an impaired intestinal mucosal barrier are required for invasive C. albicans infection. Virulence factors of C. albicans include the ability to adhere to epithelial cells and to form biofilms. The ability to form hyphae is also a virulence factor and is associated with active infection, since hyphal forms can invade epithelial cells and cause tissue damage [10] . In the case here, hyphae were visualised on cytological preparations of the intestinal lesion. This finding, in combination with culture and ITS-sequencing results is evidence of an active infection of C. albicans. No bacterial involvement was identified.",

Induction of the initial mucosal immune responses occurs in the gut associated lymphoid tissue (GALT), within Peyer's patches and mesenteric lymph nodes [11] . Many host cellular pattern recognition receptors (PPARgamma and Dectin-1) have also been identified to interact with C. albicans [12, 13] . Presence of bile acids and an abnormally increased gastric pH may promote C. albicans virulence [14] . Hence chronic gastroenteritis or long term treatment with anti-acids can lead to invasive candidiasis. C albicans itself can delay gastrointestinal ulcer healing by releasing cytokines (IL-1beta and TNF-alpha) which perpetuate ongoing inflammation and promote conditions for gastrointestinal wall invasion and adherence [15] . Altered host/C. albicans interactions could lead to local and systemic infection. In our cat, no underlying disease, gastro-intestinal bacterial overgrowth, chronic inflammation or systemic debilitating diseases were identified. An improvement 6 weeks after the introduction of a hypoallergenic diet (Hills\u2032 Z/d) raises suspicion of a possible inflammatory disorder, which could have been the source of an altered host/C. albicans interaction, although the focal nature of the disease makes this less likely.",
