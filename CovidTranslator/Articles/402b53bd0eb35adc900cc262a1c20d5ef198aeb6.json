Data were analyzed by matched-pair analysis and multivariate conditional logistic regression. Factors that were independently associated with H5N1 infection were preparing sick or dead poultry for consumption <7 days before illness onset (matched odds ratio [OR] 8.99, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.98-81.99, p = 0.05), having sick or dead poultry in the household <7 days before illness onset (matched OR 4.94, 95% CI 1.21-20.20, p = 0.03), and lack of an indoor water source (matched OR 6.46, 95% CI 1.20-34.81, p = 0.03). Factors not significantly associated with infection were raising healthy poultry, preparing healthy poultry for consumption, and exposure to persons with an acute respiratory illness.",

Since then, large-scale and global spread of the disease in poultry has been accompanied by sporadic cases in humans. Despite many millions of avian infections and >200 human cases, knowledge of influenza H5N1 remains inadequate. Neither how these viruses are transmitted to humans nor, consequently, the most effective way to reduce the risk for infection is fully understood.",

Several seroprevalence studies of healthcare workers and a case-control study from Thailand have been published from the current outbreak (6) (7) (8) (9) , but further work is needed to develop and test hypotheses on the mechanism of transmission of influenza H5N1 to humans.

Case-patients were identified from persons hospitalized with an acute respiratory infection considered by clinicians, on the basis of clinical and epidemiologic findings, to have a suspected case of H5N1 infection. Clinicians did not use a systematic case definition or screening protocol to identify patients eligible for testing for H5N1 infection. Throat swabs or tracheal aspirate samples were sent to the National Institute of Hygiene and Epidemiology in Hanoi or to the Pasteur Institute in Ho Chi Minh City for reverse transcription (RT) PCR and viral isolation. When possible, samples with positive results for influenza A H5 were sent to a World Health Organization (WHO) reference laboratory for confirmatory diagnosis. Infection  with Avian Influenza A H5N1,  Vietnam, 2004 For each case-patient, 4 control-respondents, individually matched by gender, age (age difference <24 months), and place of residence (same ward or village), were selected by use of a random number table from a list of persons fitting the selection criteria provided by the community health station near each case-patient's place of residence. Potential control-respondents were excluded if they reported having suffered an illness with respiratory symptoms and fever (temperature >38\u00b0C) during their matched case-patient's period of illness (onset to recovery or death). If the selected control-respondent refused to participate or did not meet the inclusion criteria, the geographically closest eligible person was then selected from the list. All eligible controlrespondents were asked to provide a throat swab and venous blood (5 mL) to confirm that they were not currently or had not previously been infected with influenza A H5. Participation of case-patients and control-respondents was voluntary and required written consent and, for those aged <18 years, signature of a parent or guardian.",

An association was considered statistically significant if 2-sided tests of significance had a p-value <0.05. To examine independence of effects, multivariate conditional logistic regression was performed by using the conditional logistical regression (CLogit) function in Stata/SE 8.0 for Windows (Stata Corp LP, College Station, TX, USA). Any variables with p\u22640.2 after matched analysis were included in the initial model. A backward stepwise variable-selection strategy was used to construct a final model with a significance level of >0.1 for removal and a significance level of <0.05 for re-entry into the model. Persons missing data for variables under study were excluded from any analysis involving the missing variable. Collinearity was assessed by generating a correlation coefficient matrix for all variables to be considered for inclusion in the regression model.

The absence of a statistical association between infection and contact with other animals such as pigs, cats, or dogs is reassuring. Replication and excretion of H5N1 by asymptomatic domestic waterfowl has been demonstrated and is a plausible source of infection for humans (11) ; however, although a 1997 case-control study found that visiting live poultry markets was a risk factor for human influenza A H5N1 infection (2), our study and the study from Thailand (9) did not identify contact with healthy poultry as a risk factor.

First, transmission may be by inhalation or conjunctival deposition of large infectious droplets, which may travel only short distances (13) ; second, the presence of infected poultry in the home and preparation of infected poultry for consumption may result in exposure to higher virus concentrations than other types of exposure. An alternative hypothesis is that the consumption, rather than the preparation, of infected poultry is the route of infection. Domestic cats and possibly tigers have been infected by the oral route (14, 15) , and the observed association between preparation and infection could be the result of a confounding association between preparing an infected bird (apparent risk factor) and consuming an infected bird (true risk factor).

However, we asked 2 questions specifically about handwashing behavior, and neither was significantly associated with infection (Table 1 ). An alternative, and more controversial, explanation is that people without access to an indoor water source may acquire infection by drinking or washing in outdoor water sources contaminated with feces from infected poultry. This hypothesis is plausible, given the extended survival of avian influenza viruses in water (18, 19) and the demonstration of oral infectivity in cats (14) .

In our study, clinicians were not using a systematic screening tool to identify possible H5N1 case-patients, but knowledge of poultry as the source of human H5N1 infection was ubiquitous. Possibly, H5N1 case-patients who did not have exposure to sick poultry may have been less likely to be identified than case-patients who did report this exposure. However, 5 of the 28 case-patients (18%) did not report exposure to sick poultry, indicating that exposure to sick poultry was not a prerequisite for identification as a casepatient.

This finding suggests that inherited biologic factors, such as sialic acid receptor phenotype or immune response, may be determinants of infection and disease. Studying intrinsic determinants of susceptibility will require pooling of data and samples from affected families across affected countries. If intrinsic susceptibility were a risk determinant across affected countries, it might dilute associations between certain behavior and infection unless the analyses were undertaken within subgroups that are homogeneous with respect to their intrinsic susceptibility.
