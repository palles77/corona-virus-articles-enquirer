Between April 22 and May 1, 2003, 120 patients meeting clinical criteria for SARS were admitted to a hospital for infectious diseases in Beijing, China. At 6 weeks after onset, 25% of patients (30/120) had experienced ARF. Of interest, 16 of these patients (53%) exhibited hypercapnia (PaCO 2 > 45 mm Hg), and 10 hypercapnic events occurred within 1 week of admission. The occurence of hypercapnia or CO 2 retention and was accompanied by myalgias. NPPV was instituted in 28 patients; one was intolerant of NPPV. In the remaining 27 patients, NPPV was initiated 1.2 AE 1.6 days after ARF onset. An hour of NPPV therapy led to significant increases in PaO 2 and PaO 2 /FiO 2 and a decrease in respiratory rate (p < 0.01). Endotracheal intubation was required in one third of the patients (9 of 27) who initially had a favorable response to NPPV. Remarkable pulmonary barotrauma was noticed in 7 of all 120 patients (5.8%) and in 6 of those (22%) on NPPV. The overall fatality rate at 13 weeks was 6.7% (8/120); it was higher (26.7%) in those needing NPPV. No caregiver contracted SARS. We conclude that NPPV is a feasible and appropriate treatment for ARF occurring as a result of a SARS infection.",

Acute lung injury (ALI), acute respiratory failure (ARF), and/or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) develops in more than 20% of cases and are risk factors for mortality.

Intubation and mechanical ventilation are reported for 13% or more of cases. [1] [2] [3] [4] A need for intubation is a poor prognostic sign, as more than half of mechanically ventilated patients will die. 2, 3 In China the survival rate in intubated SARS patients in Beijing DiTan Hospital was 10% (2/19) (Dr. L.M. Guo, personal communication). Given the strain on medical resources caused by the influx of critically ill patients during the SARS outbreak, as well as the morbidity associated with tracheal intubation, appropriately applied noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV) was considered as an alternative approach to the management of ALI in the SARS epidemic.",

[6] [7] [8] In a prospective randomized controlled trial of NPPV support in 52 immunosuppressed patients with pulmonary infiltrates, fever, and ARF, early initiation of NPPV was associated with significant reductions in the rate of endotracheal intubation and of serious complications and an improved likelihood of survival. 9 Data on the efficacy of NPPV in SARS are limited, and whether NPPV should be administered in these patients is controversial. 10 Some have advocated an avoidance of NPPV because it might increase droplet spread of the virus. 3, 11 However, NPPV with oxygen for ARF was deemed necessary because of the unexpected large influx of patients and a limited availability of positive-pressure ventilators in China. 12 The aim of this retrospective case series study was to describe the clinical course of ARF and the short-term outcomes of NPPV treatment in a group of SARS patients with ARF. This experience may also be relevant to other current or emerging highly infectious viral respiratory illnesses in which respiratory failure is a complication.",

However, careful review of the blood gases in this study did not reveal hypocapnia in most of the patients when ARF occurred. In contrast, a high proportion of these patients had hypercapnia during the disease course. Autopsy in some serologically confirmed cases also demonstrated that disease of less than 10 days' duration may not reflect pronounced diffuse alveolar damage, 15 so that other causes for respiratory failure, such as muscle weakness, are possible. The mechanisms of CO 2 retention in our case series can be reasoned as follows. These were previously healthy people, making it difficult to attribute hypercapnia to pre-existing respiratory or neuromuscular disease. While a high oxygen supplement could depress ventilation-perfusion matching or inhibit breathing, this is considered less likely than acute neuromuscular disease. In our series, maximum inspiration and expiration pressure tests were not conducted, but some patients reported difficulty in movement and breathing when severe myalgias occurred. Indeed, others have reported evidence for muscle involvement including myalgias and increases in lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) and creatine phosphokinase (CPK) patients with SARS. 16 Hence, muscle involvement may play a role in those patients with early appearances of hypercapnia. In those whose hypercapnia developed later, in addition to respiratory muscle damage and deterioration of lung function, the demands on the respiratory muscles became excessive, causing fatigue and eventually the retention of CO 2 .",

A self-limiting clinical course might also exist in some cases, as occurred in two patients here and as reported in the literature. 2 Because CPAP can also improve oxygenation and reduce the work of breathing effectively, there is the possibility that this simpler and less expensive method could be used as a first-line therapeutic choice. 10, 12 As bilevel NPPV is considered to be advantageous over CPAP in improving CO 2 retention and may be more comfortable and acceptable, we prefer the routine use of bilevel pressure when available.",

            "text": "Use of NPPV is theoretically proposed to increase the risk of droplet transmission of virus. 11 With foreknowledge of risk and implementation of rigorous protective measures, nosocomial SARS infection in health-care workers appears unlikely. A similar finding was reported if care is taken during intubation and invasive mechanical ventilation. 2 As early aggressive intervention may cause better outcomes in patients with ARDS, 9, 17 we suggest, as others have, early implementation of ventilatory support to prevent respiratory failure from progressing in patients with SARS and ARF. 18 Pulmonary barotrauma occurred with the use of NPPV. The mechanisms of this phenomenon remain to be determined. A high rate of pneumomediastinum and pulmonary barotrauma during invasive mechanical ventilation is reported. 1, 3, 10 Correlation between the radiographic changes and the occurrence of barotrauma supports the idea that air leaks occur in patients with more severe lung lesions. Dynamic hyperinflation and auto-PEEP was not noticed in SARS-related ARDS, 2 suggesting that intrinsic high pressures are not the sole cause of air leaks. No computed tomography 19 or autopsy 15 evidence of blebs on the lungs surface are reported although it is proposed that adhesions and cyst formation might occur at the interface between the mediastinal pleura and the pulmonary pleura. 1 Pulmonary barotrauma is rarely reported in viral pneumonia, 20,21 but spontaneous pneumothorax is common in AIDS patients with Pneumocystis carinii. 22, 23 Whether SARS coronavius infection itself plays a role similar to that of P. carinii in a predisposition to development of air leaks is not known. Our experience with several hundreds of patients with sleep apnea and/or COPD does not include a case of pulmonary barotrauma related to NPPV use. There are four cases reported in the literature of pneumothorax complicating NPPV therapy in a patient with COPD, 24 with AIDS, 25 with neuromuscular disease, 26 and following coronary artery bypass graft surgery. 27 Greater PEEP (EPAP) increases the risk of barotrauma during conventional mechanical ventilation. However, pressures in this study were not high and did not differ between the patients with and without barotrauma. Another factor may be the timing of positive pressure swings, especially during a cough. All the patients on NPPV had severe cough when barotrauma occurred. Antitussives are reported to decrease the incidence of barotrauma in SARS patients on CPAP to a lower level (6.7% of the patients treated with CPAP) 10 than reported in the our study. The length of time on NPPV may be important as pulmonary interstitial emphysema is reported to occur following positive pressure ventilation in neonate and older patients with respiratory distress syndrome. 28, 29 We suspect that NPPV, like invasive ventilation, produces barotrauma due to the interactions of lung injury and pressure swings; however, the use of NPPV is not accompanied by a negligible risk of barotrauma injury.",
