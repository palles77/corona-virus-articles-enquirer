Although the disease was detected in about 27 countries, >80% of cases were detected in Saudi Arabia. 2 MERS-CoV is classified as lineage C of the genus Betacoronavirus. 3 Insecteating bats are currently the known potential reservoir host for MERS-CoV 4,5 while dromedary camels are the known potential animal host. 6, 7 Consumption of raw camel products and direct contact with camels may constitute a possible role of disease transmission. 8 MERS-CoV affects all ages. The clinical epidemiology of MERS-CoV cases showed similarity to the seasonal flu; however, severe cases have been reported in elderly individuals and immune compromised patients with underlying conditions. 9 Health-care workers are among the risk groups 2 and asymptomatic health-care workers spread illness among hospitalized patients. 10 Annually, Saudi Arabia hosts at least three million Muslims from different nationalities at the same time in Mekkah during the pilgrimage season. Pilgrims also visit Medinah after finishing the pilgrimage rituals. Accordingly, there is a possibility of transmission of different diseases among pilgrims. Interestingly, no notification of laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV cases during pilgrimage seasons was reported; however, several imported MERS-CoV cases were recorded among returning individuals who visited Mekkah and Medinah in different countries including the Netherlands, UK, Algeria, Tunisia, and Malaysia. [11] [12] [13] Appropriate public health responses are dependent on highquality knowledge and awareness about important aspects International Journal of Health Sciences Vol. 11, Issue 5 (November -December 2017) of the disease. Whenever facing an outbreak, there is always a need for health education programs to raise the public awareness with regular evaluation of the level of knowledge to fill gaps of deficient or lack of information. MERS-CoV is a good case in point that constituted a real panic to populations. Preparing population adequately for this threat involves action on many fronts, including enhancing the public awareness toward the basic knowledge about the disease that is one key pillar of an enhanced outbreak investigation, response, and control system. We argue that our thinking should converge on the public awareness and we should address the gaps of all disciplines of the disease. The initial public health response to the MERS-CoV have been poorly calibrated owing to early estimates of the case fatality rate. 14 What was initially thought to be a potential threat and severe novel coronavirus turned out to be no more severe than an average respiratory infection. 15, 16 The current study aimed to evaluate the level of knowledge and awareness of the Saudi and non-Saudi-Arabian pilgrims regarding the MERS-CoV.",

The sample size was calculated using RASOFT online freely available program (http://www.raosoft.com/samplesize.html) with 99% confidence level. A total number of 2120 participants including 736 Saudi and non-Saudi Arabian pilgrims (1384; 909 males and 475 females) were included in the study. Statistical analysis was performed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) v. 16 .0 (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). The numbers and the percentages of the different variables were estimated using descriptive analysis. Pearson correlation coefficient and chi-square test were used to evaluate variables and determine the possible correlations.

Both groups of pilgrims (n: 2120) were first screened for the overall knowledge and awareness toward MERS-CoV. Results showed incorrect knowledge and awareness when asking the whole pilgrims about the following information: MERS-CoV appears in certain time in the year, MERS-CoV is a fatal disease to any person, the animal source of the disease, the probability of camel meat and milk to transmit the disease, whether people should be screened after coming in contact with laboratoryconfirmed cases and the presence of available vaccine and antiviral for the MERS-CoV ( Figure 1 ).",

Both groups showed a low level of knowledge regarding the seasonal nature of the disease, and camel milk and meat as possible sources of disease transmission ( Table 2) . No significant differences were detected among male and female participants in both groups ( Table 2 ). The Saudi pilgrims showed higher level of knowledge regarding the fact that being health-care workers is a risk factor (68.61 vs. 48.55, P < 0.001) and the necessity for screening for MERS-CoV when being in contact with the infected persons (61.01 vs. 46.46, P = 0.009). There was no significant differences between Saudi and non-Saudi Arabian pilgrims regarding the absence of an effective antiviral treatment (46.60 vs. 27.38) and the absence of an effective vaccine against MERS-CoV (38.99 vs. 22.54) ( Table 3) . No significant correlation was detected among different questions.",

Correct answers were expressed in considerable high percentages of the participants. Meanwhile, non-Saudi pilgrims showed a lower level of knowledge for the same questions. In contrast, both groups showed a low level of knowledge regarding the seasonal nature of the disease. High level of awareness among Saudi populations and medical students have previously detected and found consistent with our results. 10, 18 In comparison to the previous studies, our study demonstrates that the Saudi and Arabian non-Saudi pilgrims showed more awareness of the disease than French and Australian Pilgrims did. 19, 20 Although the Saudi pilgrims showed a better level of knowledge regarding the animal source of the disease in comparison to the non-Saudi Arabian pilgrims, a deficiency in the information in almost half of the population was noticed. This finding agrees with that recorded previously in Saudi Arabia. 17 Raw camel milk and cooked camel meat are commonly consumed in the Arab Gulf area. There is a raised concern about the risk of consumption of raw camel products as a potential source of MERS-CoV infection. 21 It was found that both Saudi Arabian and non-Saudi Arabian participants showed unsatisfactory awareness about this important matter. Pilgrims who were aware of MERS-CoV animal sources were also found oriented about risks from consuming non-heat treated camel products compared with those who were unaware. This finding agrees with the results reported previously in Tashani et al. 2014. 19 Health-care workers are prone to capture infection from their close contact with infected individuals, accordingly, they are considered among the risk groups. 2 In addition, asymptomatic health-care workers play an important role in spreading the illness among hospitalized patients. 10 The Saudi pilgrims showed a higher level of knowledge regarding the fact that being health-care workers is a risk factor.",
