The 6,625 nt gRNA of N\u03b2V, contains two ORFs that overlap for 1,517 nt: the first ORF at the 5\ue039 end contains 1,821 codons and encodes the putative multidomain RNA replicase (204 kDa), which almost entirely overlaps the second ORF of 612 codons at the 3\ue039 end that encodes the capsid protein precursor (66.4 kDa) (Figure 2 ). The replicase includes three highly conserved enzymatic domains, N7-methyltransferase (NMT), superfamily 1 RNA helicase (HEL1) and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase typical of the alpha-like supergroup (acRdRp) that are yet to be characterized experimentally.",

At the 5\ue039 end is the longer ORF (1,257 codons) encoding the putative replicase of approximately 140 kDa. The viral replicase carries an RdRp domain with a non-canonical, permuted, CAB motif arrangement (pRdRp). At the N-terminus this domain is flanked by a short conserved signal implicated in priming replication and covalent binding to the 5\ue039 end of RNAs (virus protein of genome, VPg). Two conserved domains flanking VPg-pRdRp have no resemblance to nmT or HEL1 domains. There is a much shorter overlap (536 and 529 nts for EeV and TaV, respectively) between the replicase and CP ORFs compared to that of N\u03b2V. The TaV and EeV CP ORFs are longer than that of N\u03b2V, yielding a putative precursor of 757 aa in length that undergoes NPGPmediated (2A-like) processing to produce an amino terminal portion of 17 kDa ( Figure 2 ) in addition to the capsid protein precursor of 65 kDa.",

It has been speculated that the tetravirus capsid might have evolved from a nodavirus-like ancestor through a process that included insertion of an immunoglobulin-like protein domain coding sequence (either acquired or evolved through sequence duplication) within the CP gene. This hypothesis is supported by structural studies that show that the PrV and N\u03c9V capsids are structurally conserved with respect to their jelly-roll folds and Ig-like domains, but not with respect to the structure and function of their N and C-termini. These domains, which form the molecular switch determining the T \ue035 4 architecture of PrV capsid, are closely related to those of nodaviruses that possess a T \ue035 3 capsid architecture.",

The replicases of N\u03b2V, DpTV and HaSV resemble those of the \"alphavirus-like\" supergroup, having the distinct nmT-HEL1-acRdRp domain organization and through phylogenetic clustering with viruses having these three domains. The replicases of TaV and EeV lack both nmT and HEL1 domains. Furthermore, their pRdRp domain has a unique C-A-B motif arrangement in the palm subdomain of the active site that differs from the canonical A-B-C arrangement found in the other tetraviruses, all \"alphavirus-like\" viruses and indeed almost all known template-dependent polynucleotide polymerases (viral and cellular) carrying the palm sub-domain. Interestingly, the same C-A-B permutation of the three motifs is also found in replicases of all dsRNA birnaviruses. This rearrangement is a result of migration of about 22 aa residues encompassing motif C between two internal positions, separated by about 110 aa, in a conserved region of about 400 aa. The permuted TaV, EeV and birnavirus enzymes form a minor, deeply separated Zeddam et al. (2010).

The pRdRp domains of these viruses are also flanked by the uniquely conserved VPg signal and another poorly characterized domain from the N-terminus. A similar arrangement is also found in DAV. Thus, replicases of TaV/EeV and birnaviruses (and possibly DAV) may represent their own virus supercluster.",

To acknowledge these gross differences, TaV/EeV and, probably PrV, are proposed to be placed in two new families separate from the prototypic tetraviruses.
