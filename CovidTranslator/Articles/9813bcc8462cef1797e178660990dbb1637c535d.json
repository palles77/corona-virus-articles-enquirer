There is a significant size disparity between the common finch pets (the smallest is the goldbreasted waxbill at 7 g, the largest is the Java rice sparrow at 20 g). Most common finches belonging to the family Fringillidae and Estrildidae. Some commonly kept Fringillidae (true finches, approximately 125 species) are canaries, greenfinches (Carduelis chloris), goldfinches (C. carduelis), bullfinches (Pyrrhula pyrrhula) and chaffinches (Fringilla coelebs). Estrildidae (approximately 125 species) originating from Africa, Asia and Australia include waxbills, e.g. zebra finch (Poephila guttata) and Lady Gouldian (Chloebia gouldiae), nuns, e.g. spice finch (Lonchura punctulata) and parrot finches, e.g. the parrot finch (Erythrura psittacea). The finches are kept for breeding, but also as ornamental birds. Bengalese or society finches (Lonchura striata domestica) and zebra finches are used as foster parents for breeding Australian finches. This gives special problems, because they can be carriers of diseases that can kill the foster-fledglings -e.g. cochlosomosis and Campylobacter spp. infections. By comparison, using foster parents may prevent some infectious diseases that are transmitted from infected parent to offspring. For example, colonies of Gouldian finches that are air sac mite-free have been established by using society finches, which are not susceptible to air sac mites, as foster parents (Macwhirter, 1994) . One of the major disadvantages of fostered birds is that they imprint on the foster parents, and may therefore be less likely to breed with their own species. For species-specific imprinting to occur, a finch should be exposed to its own species from the fifteenth to the fortieth days of life.",

The birds will acclimatize to their new surroundings, and often a fresh stool will be produced for examination. Transport in their own cage is recommended whenever possible.

Most digital gram scales can provide an accurate weight if the finch is contained in a paper box or bag, but the container must be weighed or tared. The usual physical examination is performed as for any other bird; the clinician should listen for respiratory sounds, and take care not interfere with the movements of the sternum, which could kill the patient.

All species that are unable to synthesize ascorbic acid are insectivorous or frugivorous, and receive a reliable dietary supply in that way. Some Passeriformes that are able to synthesize ascorbic acid do so at rates two to ten times slower than those in species such as chickens, ducks and Japanese quail, which do not have a dietary requirement. Even the high endogenous synthetic rate in other species may be inadequate during periods of severe stress, such as heat, physical trauma, infection, and the consumption of some types of purified diets.

Clinically, dyspnoea, weight loss, abdominal distension (hydrops ascites), and weakness are seen with hepatic haemochromatosis. Clinical pathology results usually show a hypoproteinaemia and an elevated activity of liver enzymes. At necropsy, iron storage disease is detected basically in the liver. In terminal cases, a liver fibrosis, concentric heart decompensation, lung oedema and hydrops ascites are noted. Sometimes iron will be found in other organs as well, especially in combination with an infectious disease. When iron is found in combination with an infectious disease, the iron is predominantly stored in macrophages, which can eventually form extensive focal granulomas. Toucans and mynahs suffer from a primary haemochromatosis, which is a species-specific inherited metabolic disorder that causes a relative excess of iron to be absorbed from 'iron-balanced' diets (Dorrestein et al., 1992) . In general, fructivorous, insectivorous and omnivorous birds accumulate more iron in their livers (Figures 7.7 and 7 .8) than carnivorous, piscivorous and granivorous birds, even within the same order (Dierenfield and Sheppard, 1989; Dorrestein, 1997a) . Figure 7 .8 shows the distribution in hepatocytes and Kupffer cells in the livers of commonly affected avian orders. In Passeriformes, iron storage in hepatocytes is only noted in mynahs. In canaries and finches, the only iron found in the liver is related to an inflammatory reaction in Kupffer cells. These species/nutritional correlations are indicative of a species-specific genetic predisposition consistent with primary haemochromatosis.",

At necropsy, the extremely haemorrhagic, oedematous lungs are characteristic. 4 Avocado, or at least certain varieties, may be toxic to some passeriformes. Post-mortem findings in intoxicated birds include hydropericardium and subcutaneous oedema in the pectoral area (Hargis, 1989) . 5 Green almonds have been considered as a cause of mortality in American goldfinches, presumably from cyanide released by hydrolysis of amygdalin, a cyanogenic glycoside. 6 Ethanol toxicity has been reported in freeranging passerines (especially cedar waxwings) following the ingestion of hawthorn pommes or other fruits that have frozen and then thawed, allowing yeast fermentation of sugars to produce ethanol. Birds are lethargic, ataxic, or may be in a stupor ('drunk'). Many intoxicated birds die from accidents that occur while they are 'flying under the influence'. The diagnosis is based on analysing crop contents and liver for ethanol concentrations (Fitzgerald et al., 1990) . 7 Heavy metal toxicosis caused by the direct consumption of the metal is uncommon in passerines, because they have limited capacity to damage metal objects. Lead or zinc toxicosis has occasionally occurred when galvanized wire has been used in the construction or repair of enclosures. Another source of zinc for passerine species is galvanized containers for supplying bath or drinking water. Removing the source of heavy metals and the administration of chelation therapy (Ca-EDTA 20-40 mg/kg i.v./i.m., followed by 40-80 mg/kg p.o. b.i.d. until the lead has disappeared) are recommended.",

The clinical symptoms are huddling and ruffling of the feathers, debilitation, diarrhoea, neurological signs (20 per cent) and death. Mortality can be as high as 80 per cent. An enlarged liver can be seen as a blue spot on the right side of the abdomen caudal to the sternum, referred to by fanciers as 'thick liver disease'. At necropsy, an enlarged and sometimes spotted liver (with necrosis in the acute phase) may be seen, along with a huge, dark-red coloured spleen and, often, an oedematous duodenum with vascularization. In the imprints of the liver, spleen and lungs, parasites are found in the cytoplasm of the monocytes. The nucleus of the host cell is crescent-shaped. Coccidia spp. are seldom found in the faeces or intestinal contents because, after the acute phase is passed, only a few coccidia spp. (100-200/24 hours) are excreted. The therapeutic agent of choice is sulfachlorpyrazin (150 mg/l drinking water) until after moulting for 5 days a week.

The symptoms include gasping for breath, and the small passerines often die from occlusion of the trachea by the worms and the mucus produced. The diagnosis is confirmed by demonstrating the worms in the trachea by using backlighting, or by finding the typical eggs in the droppings. The worms are easily identified in the trachea at necropsy. Ivermectin (injection 200 \u00b5g/kg) and levamisole or fenbendazole are effective in treating this parasite, but caution should be exercised when treating birds with heavy infections, because the worm dead can obstruct the trachea. In such a case with a heavy worm burden, treatment with a low dose of an anthelmintic (especially fenbendazole) over several days provides effective treatment.",

Insects (e.g. cockroaches, crickets) serve as intermediate hosts. Geopetitia aspiculata are pathogenic, leading to perforation of the wall of the proventriculus, often resulting in death. The parasite is not host-specific and is demonstrated in six avian orders, including Passeriformes (e.g. Emberizidae, Estrildidae, Fringillidae, Icteridae, Sturnidae -including a hill mynah) and insect-eating Piciformes (e.g. barbets and woodpeckers). The diagnosis is confirmed by finding the embryonated spiruroid eggs in the faeces (although this might not always be effective), followed by endoscopic demonstration of the proventricular lesions. At necropsy an enlarged abdomen is found, due to a mass of tightly coiled parasites attached to the serosa of the proventriculus, and worms are sometimes found in the liver. Infected birds can be successfully treated with ivermectin (300-400 \u00b5g/kg body weight s.c.) or fenbendazole (25 mg/kg body weight p.o. for 3 days). To interrupt the development cycle of the parasite, emphasis should be laid on eradication of the intermediate host.",

Coccidia, which are common in small passerines, are excreted mainly between 2 pm and darkness. Yeasts and protozoal cysts (eg. Giardia spp.) are found using direct wet preparations or flotation techniques. The diagnosis of cochlosomosis in society finches or Australian finches can only be made in direct wet mounts of fresh and warm stool without dilution. Because passerines are not considered to have a permanent gut flora, no bacteria or other micro-organisms should be found in large quantities in stained faecal smears. Routine microbiological aerobic cultures should be negative. Microaerophylic strains (e.g. Campylobacter jejuni) can be found in stained faecal smears in many Estrildidae. In softbills, bacteria are commonly demonstrated in the stools of healthy birds. These bacteria are considered as 'passage flora'. 2 Crop swabs.
