It merges scientific and engineering fields such as nanotechnology, stem cell as regenerative medicine, biomechanics, and biomedical devices for helping diagnostics and therapeutics [1] . As an example, nanoparticles or nanomaterials can be used in diagnostic applications such as gene therapy or bioimaging in the brain. Some of the applied systems within biomedical engineering research [2] are detecting infant facial cry to help to communicate pain [3] and lip feature extracting on the frontal face for speech training of the deaf [4] . Another work is recognizing facial emotion to understand dysfunction mechanisms through micro expression or transform captured human expression with motion device into three-dimensional objects [5] . Those works use image-based data in unobtrusive smart systems for healthcare related models. A recent trend is not only about images but also about textual data in healthcare related models such as fake news or hoax spreading within the power of internet technology.",

            "text": "Fake news or hoax has many definitions such as recurrent issues used as a political weapon, irrelevant truths (posttruths) or intentionally spreading falsehood information (alt-facts) [6] . Alternative facts (alt-facts) are information with no basis in reality while post-truths are defined as beyond the truths or irrelevant information. This discussion has a focus on fake news or hoax in Indonesia [7] in the form of alt-facts [8] especially about medical related issues [9] . Conducted surveys in Indonesia gave perceptions about hoaxes, how they are spread, their topic classifications and their effects on the communities. The medium of communication for hoaxes is varied like image or video such that manipulating non-textual content becomes another problem. Meanwhile, text-based hoaxes are usually spread through social media like Twitter or Facebook and the analysis to recognize them are not limited to the hoax text itself but also on how it is presented, by who, and in what format and context [10] . Hoax text presentation means that the analysis is about linguistic-based features because microblog text like Twitter and email text have different characteristics. The sources who are spreading hoax texts tend to have verifiability issues. Thus in the case of Twitter usage as a medium of communication for hoaxes, analysis of retweeting topology network becomes necessary. Aforementioned hoax analysis can be categorized into two major approaches: linguistic and network. Here, we discuss hoax within online news text that put more weights on the linguistic aspect [11] . Linguistic approaches concern with texts as a bag of equally significant words, syntax structure like noun and verb phrases within the texts, and semantic analysis to recognize any contradictions on other texts with the similar topics of allegedly hoax texts. As network approach, some web-based tools are used to predict and track disease outbreaks through query keyword evaluation [12] .",

Many unverified but widespread news can hinder the national policies. Hoax texts as bags of words were identified with some classifiers [13] in some conditions such as the experimented topics are general, the dataset comes from undeclared sources, and the training data needs manual label. Several selection features are implemented to filter the important words. Those limitations are understandable because of no Indonesian hoax text datasets available unlike English hoaxes or fake news datasets (http://www.fakenewschallenge.org/). However, those steps are not suitable for analyzing medically related hoax text since the article has convincing content but fabricated facts unless there is a refutation article to verify the false claim ( Fig. 1 , overall hoax content is showed in the left figure while the disagree texts are in the right figure) . Those articles give stance position whether supporting the claims or refuting the hoaxes to evaluate the attitude expressed in the texts. For that reason, in a medical hoax classification problem, stance articles turn out to be essential.",

However, the text source influences methods of feature selection and classifier. For example, in Wikipedia articles [16] there are appearance features like word counting, content ratio of texts & non-texts, and links within articles. Another kind of feature for Wikipedia articles is network-based coefficients like clustering coefficient to differentiate legitimate and hoax articles. Unique characteristic of Facebook posts create user categories [17] , which are user who like hoaxes, user who like non-hoaxes, and user who like both posts.

The purpose of our experiments is to show how stance classification implemented in hoax analysis especially with medial contents. The first step of our experiments is collecting data come from medical archives of snopes.com (http://www.snopes.com/category/facts/medical/). The articles are categorized as true, false, and unverified facts. For our Snopes small dataset, we have articles of 19 true claims, 42 false claims, and 17 unverified texts. Then we find 400 related headlines of news texts as stance articles from the search results which have states of for when the claim is true, against when the claim is false, and observing when it merely repeats the claim but uses hedging or vague language. Because of the possibilities for hedging texts, there are two kinds of features: headlines and claim-headlines. Headlines features are common bag-of-words representation from term frequency until distance between root word and refuting word in a sentence that needs a process of analyzing grammatical structure. Whereas, claim-headline features need aligning process between words in a claim with its parallel headline, i.e. Paraphrase Database (PPDB). After aligning words and know their positions, the similarity between vectors of the claim and the headline uses wordembedding results.",

The classifier with headlines features gives varied performances in all stances (Table 2) , although claim-headlines features have consistent results in the against class (Table 3) . It confirms that aligning phrase or words using Paraphrase Database (PPDB) between the claim and the headline is necessary for vague language. Hedging or vague texts are common in the headline instances of observing class. Some misclassified data sample are presented in Table 2 . The same misclassified texts for headlines are also found in Table 3 . In the other hand, accuracy value for the instances of against class is consistent between headline feature (Table 2 ) and claim-headline feature ( Table 3 ). This happens because in the instances of against class, the article contents show similar stance with the article headlines. Table 2 shows the instances of against class have better accuracy value compare to others, while the instances of observing class have better precision value, and the instances of for class have better recall value. This happens because the headline texts are usually short. Therefore, further works on a better understanding of semantic meaning in the article is needed to obtain a better stance. This ongoing research focuses on stance classification, as a preliminary research on hoax analysis. After the stance classification is done accurately, the next step will be on hoax classification.",

Filtering health information in social media such as hoaxes can be associated with biomedical research as well. Because of social media characteristic, linguistic and network features are common approaches in clarifying the truthiness of hoaxes. Understanding the contents of medical hoax or non-hoax texts often uses phrase and word positioning like word embedding. The allegedly hoax texts can be truth claims, false facts, or vague description. For that reason, hoax analysis can be solved as stance classification and data collecting process requires the hoax dataset and the stance dataset. However, text sources such as Twitter or Facebook give another perception for determining hoax analysis. For future works, researches of Indonesian hoaxes still offer many possibilities since analyzing grammatical structure become language barrier. ",
