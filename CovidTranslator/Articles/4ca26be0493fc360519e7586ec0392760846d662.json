In 2015, MERS-CoV spread from the Middle East to South Korea which sustained an outbreak. Thus, it is clear that the virus can spread among humans in areas in which camels are not husbanded.",

The United Arab Emirates has a bidirectional connection with Saudi Arabia indicating the virus has spread between the two countries. The United Arab Emirates also has high betweenness. The United Arab Emirates is between Saudi Arabia and Oman and Between Saudi Arabia and France. South Korea, and Qatar have mild betweeness. South Korea is between Saudi Arabia and China.

Drawing parallels between the transmissions events in the WHO data and the genetic data has shown to be challenging. Analyses of the genetic information can be used to imply a transmission pathway but it is hard to find epidemiological data in the public domain to corroborate the transmission pathway. There are rare cases in the WHO data that include travel history (e.g. \"The patient is from Riyadh and flew to the UK\"). We conclude that epidemiological data combined with genetic data and metadata have strong potential to understand the geographic progression of an infectious disease. However, reporting standards need to be improved where travel history does not impinge on privacy.",
