            "text": "Characterization of the feline intestinal mucosal associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) will facilitate investigation of intestinal disease in the cat and promote the cat as an animal model for a range of human diseases which involve the intestinal lymphoid tissue. This includes in\u00afammatory bowel disease, viral and non-viral associated intestinal lymphomas and immunode\u00aeciency associated syndromes. Morphologic and phenotypic characterization of the normal small intestinal diffuse MALT in 22 SPF cats was performed using\u00afow cytometry and cytology on isolated intestinal leukocytes from the intra-epithelial and lamina proprial compartments, as well as immunohistology on tissues from the feline duodenum, jejunum and ileum. The intra-epithelial compartment (IEC) was dominated by lymphocytes (>85%) which frequently contained intracytoplasmic granules. The most striking \u00aendings in the IEC were the elevated percentages of CD8a lymphocytes (40%), presumed to express CD8aa chains, and CD4\u00c0/CD8\u00c0 (double negative) lymphocytes (44%), and the consistent presence of a minor subpopulation of CD3/ CD11d IELs (6%). Small percentages of CD4 lymphocytes (10%) were observed such that the IEL CD4:CD8 ratio (0.25) was low. The LPC also contained a majority of T cells and few plasma cells. However, this compartment had reduced percentages of CD8a lymphocytes (28%) and increased percentages of CD4 lymphocytes (27%) relative to the IEC. However, the LPL CD4:CD8 ratio (1.0) remained low compared with the ratio in peripheral blood. In feline MALT, MHC class II expression was lower than in other peripheral lymphoid compartments. The results of this study provide important reference values for future investigations involving feline intestinal lymphocytes and demonstrates that the leukocyte distribution and phenotypic characteristics of the feline diffuse MALT appear largely similar to the murine, rat and human counterparts. #",

Leukocytes derived from each compartment have been differentiated by anatomical location as well as phenotype and function, thus de\u00aening a compartmentalization unique to the mucosal immune system (Lundqvist et al., 1995) .",

            "text": "The lymphocyte subpopulation of the IEC, the intra-epithelial lymphocytes (IELs), have been extensively characterized in mouse (Lefrancois, 1991; Maloy et al., 1991; Guy-Grand and Vassalli, 1993) , rat (Vaage et al., 1990; Fangmann et al., 1991; Takimoto et al., 1992; Santhi and Ramanadham, 1995; Kearsey and Stadnyk, 1996; Helgeland et al., 1997) , and man (Spencer et al., 1989; Jarry et al., 1990; Guy-Grand and Vassalli, 1993; Machado et al., 1994; Lundqvist et al., 1995) . Morphologically, a large percentage of IELs have intracytoplasmic azurophilic granules containing granzymes and perforin (Cerf-Bensussan and Guy-Grand, 1991; Mowat and Viney, 1997) . Phenotypically, the majority of IELs are T cells with CD3/CD8 phenotype (Cerf-Bensussan and Guy-Grand, 1991; Guy-Grand and Vassalli, 1993; Mowat and Viney, 1997) . A majority of IELs also co-express CD103, the aEb7 integrin required for homing and retention of lymphocytes in the mucosal epithelium (Cepek et al., 1994) . However, considerable phenotypic heterogeneity has been observed in IELs where CD4/CD8 (DP), CD4\u00c0/CD8\u00c0 (DN) T cells and unusual subpopulations such as CD3\u00c0/CD8 and CD4/CD8aa lymphocytes are described (Lefrancois, 1991; Maloy et al., 1991; Guy-Grand and Vassalli, 1993; Mowat and Viney, 1997) . Reasons for heterogeneity in this mucosal lymphoid pool are not well understood. However, this phenotypic diversity displayed by mucosal IELs is likely a re\u00afection of the range of functions performed by IELs as the \u00aerst line of defence against mucosal antigens, and is attributed to in\u00afuences from both the intestinal local environment and the intestinal epithelium.",

The intestinal mucosal barrier and presumably, the MALT, also have a role in the pathogenesis of feline corona virus infection and the resultant development of feline infectious peritonitis (Pedersen et al., 1981) . However, characterization of feline normal intestinal MALT has not been reported. In this study,\u00afow cytometry, immunohistology and cytology were used to characterize the diffuse MALT of the small intestine in normal cats. Additionally, we describe the distribution and expression of the novel leukointegrin CD11d (Danilenko et al., 1995) in the feline MALT. The most striking \u00aendings in this study were the elevated percentages of CD8a T cells, presumed to express CD8aa chains, and CD4\u00c0/CD8\u00c0 (double negative) lymphocytes in the IEC, and the consistent presence of a minor subpopulation of CD3/CD11d IELs. This contrasts with salient phenotypic characteristics of the feline LPL population which included increased percentages of CD4 T cells, reduced numbers of CD8 T cells, presumed to express both CD8a and b chains, and minimal expression of CD11d.",

The small intestine, extending from the duodenum to the ileo-cecocolic junction was excised. Fecal material and excess mucus were removed from the intestinal lumen with extensive\u00afushing with RPMI 1640 medium pH 7.4 containing 2 mM dithiothreitol, 100 ml/ml penicillin and 100 mg/ml streptomycin (all from Fisher Scienti\u00aec, Pittsburgh, PA). The intestine was opened longitudinally and cut into 2 cm fragments and the Peyer's patches were resected. The intestinal fragments were washed for 10 min with the solution described above prior to leukocyte extraction. Extraction of cells from the IEC consisted of incubation of washed intestinal fragments with stirring for an hour in Ca 2 Mg 2 free Hanks balanced salt solution (HBSS, Fisher Scienti\u00aec), containing 5 mM EDTA, 10% FetalClone I serum (Hyclone Inc., Oregon, UT) and 10 mM HEPES. Cell suspensions were collected after centrifugation of the supernatant at 200\u00c2g for 5 min. This procedure was repeated twice for maximum leukocyte IEC yield. The intestinal segments were further washed with stirring for 1 h prior to extraction of leukocytes from the LPC. LPC leukocytes from nine animals were obtained after 6\u00b18 h incubation of the IEL-extracted intestinal fragments on an orbital shaker (Bellco Glass Inc, Vineland, NJ) at 10\u00c2g in RPMI 1640 pH 7.4 containing 0.01% collagenase type III (Worthington Biochemical Corporation, Freehold, NJ), 10% FetalClone I serum, 10 mM HEPES. Collagenase type III was used for extraction of LPLs because of its low proteolytic activity and reduced likelihood of enzymatic degradation of cell surface antigens. The collagenase recognition sequence (PXGP) is rare in proteins other than collagen and is not present in the feline lymphocyte molecules for which sequences are known (CD4, CD8a and CD8b). The collagenase digested material was pressed through a stainless steel wire mesh (Fisher Scienti\u00aec) to free the LPC leukocytes. The IEC and LPC leukocyte suspensions were \u00aeltered four times through columns packed with glass wool (Fisher Scienti\u00aec). Following extraction and \u00aeltration, IEC and LPC leukocytes were washed with RPMI 1640 and resuspended in phosphate buffered saline pH 7.4 (PBS) with 10% v/v heat inactivated horse serum (Gibco BRL, Gaithersburg, MD) and 0.01% sodium azide (buffer A) for cytospin preparations and\u00afow cytometry.",

The majority of IELs, including both granular and non-granular lymphocytes, expressed CD3. Fewer IELs expressed CD5. Both CD8a and CD8b lymphocytes consistently predominated in number over CD4 T cells such that the ratio of CD4:CD8a lymphocytes was 0.25. Although increased numbers of CD8lymphocytes were present in the IEL pool, a discrepancy in expression of CD8a and CD8b was observed. As many as 40% of CD8a IELs did not express the CD8b chain and were interpreted as CD8aa IELs. Dual staining of IELs with CD3/CD8a and CD3/CD4 by\u00afow cytometry detected very few CD3\u00c0/ CD8a and extremely rare CD3\u00c0/CD4 lymphocytes. Dual staining of IELs with CD4/ CD8 by\u00afow cytometry demonstrated a substantial population of CD4\u00c0/CD8\u00c0 (DN) lymphocytes (44%) was present, while CD4/CD8 (DP) lymphocytes (2%) were rare.",

CD3e expression was investigated only by immunohistology and immunocytology since permeabilization caused major lysis of LPC leukocytes. However, expression of CD5, CD4, CD8a and CD8b antigens was investigated with both\u00afow cytometry and immunohistology. As in the IEL population, the majority of LPLs were CD3 T cells with fewer cells expressing CD5. However, CD4 and CD8a expression differed from the IEL population. LPLs were represented by a three-fold increase in CD4 T cells and a three-fold decrease in CD8 T cells, both of which were signi\u00aecant changes (p<0.05) compared with the IEL population. This variation in percentages of CD4 and CD8a lymphocytes resulted in a LPL CD4:CD8a ratio of 1.0, which was increased over that observed in the IEL pool. In contrast to the increased expression of CD8a over CD8b antigens as observed in the IEL pool, CD8 cells in the LPL pool were composed of similar percentages of CD8a and CD8b cells. This equivalent level of CD8a and CD8b expression was more consistent with the majority of CD8 lymphocytes in the LPL compartment expressing CD8ab heterodimers, and fewer CD8 lymphocytes expressing CD8aa homodimers.",

In this study, adaptation of existing methods originally developed for the study of diffuse MALT in humans and rodents, resulted in consistent cell yield and purity from feline intestine. Feline IELs were enriched for granular lymphocytes, this was especially so in juvenile cats. The majority of feline IEL were T cells, which consistently expressed CD3, but exhibited reduced frequency of expression of CD5. Feline IEL predominantly expressed CD8a and less frequently CD8b, but a large population of lymphocytes, which lacked expression of CD4 or CD8, was also prevalent. In contrast, feline IEL, which co-expressed CD4 and CD8 were rare. In these respects feline IEL differed markedly from IEL of rodents (Vaage et al., 1990; Fangmann et al., 1991; Lefrancois, 1991; Maloy et al., 1991; Takimoto et al., 1992; Guy-Grand and Vassalli, 1993; Santhi and Ramanadham, 1995; Kearsey and Stadnyk, 1996; Helgeland et al., 1997) and humans (Spencer et al., 1989; Jarry et al., 1990; Guy-Grand and Vassalli, 1993; Machado et al., 1994; Lundqvist et al., 1995) . Unexpectedly, feline IEL exhibited broad variation in MHC class II expression between individuals, in contrast to the consistent high frequency of MHC class II expression by peripheral blood lymphocytes of all lineages in cats. Also, the expression of CD11d by a minor subset of feline IEL appeared to be a unique feature. Feline LPLs were more dif\u00aecult to assess due to poor viability following prolonged incubation necessary for their release. Feline LPL populations were broadly similar to IEL populations with the exception of higher frequency of CD4 expression by T cells and lower frequency of CD8a expression. In contrast to IEL, granular lymphocytes were infrequently encountered, and CD11d expression was minimal in the LPL population.",

Immunostaining of tissue sections and cytocentrifuge preparations qualitatively validated the lymphocyte phenotypes on IELs and LPLs that were established by quantitative\u00afow cytometry. Although consistent leukocyte yields were obtained in both juvenile and adult cats, juvenile cats had signi\u00aecantly reduced IEC yields compared with adults. However, despite this reduced cell yield in juvenile cats, differential cell counts demonstrated that granular lymphocytes represented a signi\u00aecantly increased percentage of cells in the IEC. Although this has been observed in other species, the reasons or mechanisms by which this age-associated variation in yield and lymphocyte morphology occurs are not well understood. Aging has been associated with elevation in IEL numbers in man (Machado et al., 1994) and mouse (Maloy et al., 1991) and is hypothesized to be driven by continuous antigen stimulation. This increased cell yield which was consistently detected in adult cats suggests that a similar situation occurs in this species. The variation in lymphocyte morphology is also reported in other species. Granular IELs are reported in the rat where they represent a signi\u00aecant percentage of the CD3 IEL population (Vaage et al., 1990) .

Conversely, CD8a lymphocytes constituted a major subpopulation of feline IELs but were a reduced component of the feline LPL pool. This variation in CD4 and CD8 expression was assessed by examination of the CD4:CD8 ratio in each compartment. Increased percentages of CD8a lymphocytes (40%) and low percentages of CD4 lymphocytes (10%) resulted in an IEL CD4:CD8a ratio of 0.25. This contrasted with the LPL CD4:CD8a ratio of 1.0 associated with increased percentages of CD4 lymphocytes (27%) and reduced percentages of CD8a lymphocytes (28%). However, despite the increase in CD4 LPLs in the feline intestine, the CD4:CD8 ratio in this compartment remained low compared with peripheral T cells in which a CD4:CD8 ratio of 2.5 is routinely observed in speci\u00aec pathogen free juvenile cats (Woo et al., 1997) . Similar \u00aendings are reported in the mouse (Lefrancois, 1991; Camerini et al., 1993; and man (Lundqvist et al., 1995) where CD4 cells represent a markedly reduced subpopulation of IELs, and an increased subpopulation of LPLs in contrast with CD8 intestinal lymphocytes.",

The localization of CD8aa lymphocytes in intraepithelial sites has also suggested that both the intestinal environment and epithelium play a critical role in expression of this phenotype . As a means of de\u00aening possible functions of CD8aa IELs in immune surveillance, further investigations have focused on T cell receptor (TCR) expression and TCR-Vb repertoire of this subpopulation. However, signi\u00aecant differences between CD8aa and CD8ab IELs have not been described.

While this phenotype is unusual compared with lymphocytes described in peripheral blood and tissues, DN lymphocytes are consistently reported as a subpopulation of IELs. However, in contrast to our \u00aendings in the cat, DN lymphocytes represent minor IEL subpopulations accounting for less than 10% of IELs in both rat (Taguchi et al., 1991) and man (Spencer et al., 1989) . This percentage of DN cells in this feline study may be exaggerated by the inclusion of natural killer (NK) cells or TCRgd T cells which would not be expected to express either CD4 or CD8 antigens. More precise phenotypic analysis to determine TCR expression or the presence of NK cells within this DN population was not performed due to the lack of feline speci\u00aec reagents. Also, CD3 expression on this DN subpopulation which would be expected on TCRgd IELs was not directly determined. While murine studies demonstrate CD3 expression on intestinal TCRgd T lymphocytes (Camerini et al., 1993; Kuhnlein et al., 1994) , they are mostly negative for CD4 and CD8. By analogy, feline intestinal TCRgd T lymphocytes are also be expected to be negative for CD4 and CD8. Converse to the \u00aendings with DN IELs, only a minor fraction of feline IELs co-expressed CD4 and CD8. This dual positive (DP) fraction accounted for only 2% of IELs which is, therefore, similar to the percentage of DP lymphocytes observed in peripheral blood. Again, this contrasts with reports in other species where DP lymphocytes represent much larger subpopulations of the IEL pool. This may range from 20 to 35% of IELs in rat (Fangmann et al., 1991; Kearsey and Stadnyk, 1996) and 4\u00b130% of IELs in mouse (Lefrancois, 1991; Taguchi et al., 1991; .",

Investigation of expression of the alpha subunits was restricted to CD11b and CD11d as feline speci\u00aec reagents that recognize CD11a and CD11c are not available. A minor subpopulation of feline IELs expressed CD11d. The CD11d molecule is the most recently described alpha chain of the leukointegrin family, and its distribution has been examined most extensively in the dog (Danilenko et al., 1995) . Canine CD11d is expressed by a minor subset of both splenic and peripheral blood lymphocytes, and there is no evidence of CD11d expression by intestinal lymphocytes by immunohistology. However, in humans, CD11d expression appears more diffuse and has been observed on mononuclear cells of the mucosa as well as deeper layers of the intestine (Bernstein et al., 1996) . As CD11d expression in the cat is largely similar in its tissue distribution to that described for dogs (Danilenko et al., 1995) , the \u00aending of CD11d feline IELs was unexpected. Despite the presence of CD11d lymphocytes in this unexpected location in the cat, many phenotypic similarities were noted between the feline IEL and canine splenic and peripheral blood CD11d lymphocytes. This includes the expression of CD3 by the majority of cells, the presence of a large percentage of DN cells, and the predominance of CD8 expression over CD4 as a component of this subpopulation. Also of note, were the presence of intracytoplasmic granules in 35% of canine splenic CD11d lymphocytes. As a signi\u00aecant population of feline IELs also exhibited granular morphology, it is likely that a subpopulation of granular IELs also express CD11d.",

As in these species, feline IELs were mostly CD3 T cells with reduced expression of CD5 and a predominance of CD8a expression over CD4. However, while T cell antigen expression was principally analogous to other species, quantitative differences were noted in the cat. This included increased numbers of DN lymphocytes, reduced numbers of DP lymphocytes and the presence of a minor subpopulation of CD11d IELs. As described for other species, the feline LPL population differed phenotypically from IELs. These differences included the reduced expression of CD8a and increased expression of CD4 and CD8b. However, further phenotypic investigation is clearly needed to better characterize mucosal T cell populations. In particular, investigation of TCR expression by both IEL and LPL subpopulations, expression of aEb7 and a4b7 integrins associated with mucosal lymphocyte traf\u00aecking, and expression of markers of T cell activation are necessary to better understand the phenotypic basis of normal intestinal mucosal immune function in the cat. This would greatly enhance our ongoing investigations of perturbations, in the intestinal mucosal immune system, which are likely to accompany feline in\u00afammatory bowel disease, feline intestinal lymphoma, and feline immunode\u00aeciency virus infection.",
