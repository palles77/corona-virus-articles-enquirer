The impact of any intervention depends on its efficiency as well as efficacy, and efficient isolation of infected individuals before they become symptomatic is difficult to imagine. Nonetheless, in exploring the possible impact of quarantine, the product of efficiency and efficacy was varied over the entire unit interval. Another mistake was repeatedly fitting otherwise appropriate gamma distributions to times to event regardless of whether they were stationary or not, particularly onset-isolation intervals whose progressive reduction evidently contributed to SARS control. By virtue of their unknown biology, newly-emerging diseases are more challenging than familiar human scourges. Influenza, for example, recurs annually and has been modeled more thoroughly than any other infectious disease. Moreover, models were integrated into preparedness exercises, during which working relationships were established that bore fruit during the 2009 A/H1N1 pandemic. To provide the most accurate and timely advice possible, especially about the possible impact of measures designed to control diseases caused by novel human pathogens, we must appreciate the value and difficulty of policy-oriented modeling. Effective communication of insights gleaned from modeling SARS will help to ensure that policymakers involve modelers in future outbreaks of newly-emerging infectious diseases. Accordingly, we illustrate the increasingly timely care-seeking by which, together with increasingly accurate diagnoses and effective isolation, SARS was controlled via heuristic arguments and descriptive analyses of familiar observations.",

Because the impact of any intervention depends not only on its efficacy, but on the proportion of targets reached, knowledgeable public health practitioners might have cautioned against overestimating the ease of identifying asymptomatic people in whom pathogens were replicating. Where published observations permit assessment, only about 5% of infected contacts of SARS patients (i.e., susceptible people associating with infectious ones intimately enough for infection) were in fact isolated before symptom onset. In Singapore, for example, only 11 of the 238 people ultimately diagnosed as probable cases (Tan 2005) and in Taiwan only 24 of 480 (Hsieh et al. 2005 ) had been quarantined. Other contacts were identified in Singapore, but evidently their perceived risk did not warrant movement restriction.",

In Beijing, 30,178 close contacts of 2,521 probable cases were quarantined over the course of the epidemic (Pang et al. 2003 ). Analysis of a subset of those individuals with good records (covering 2,195 contacts of 582 patients from 5 districts) revealed a range in the probability of diagnosed illness among quarantined individuals from 0% to 15.4%, depending on their relationship to the patient. Transmission was relatively high among spouses, other relatives, friends, and other household members, and low among co-workers, schoolmates, and healthcare workers. Separately, Ou et al. (2003) studied geographically representative precincts throughout Haidian District, where 1,210 contacts of 171 patients were quarantined. The probability of infection among a subset of 383 quarantined people ranged from 0% to 31.1%, also depending on the nature of their contact with patients. Consistent with the findings of Pang et al. (2003) , caring for ill household members imposed the greatest risk, followed by visiting and residing in the same household. In sharp contrast to the situation in Hong Kong, where a faulty sewage system at the Amoy Gardens apartment complex may have facilitated fecal-oral transmission (Hong Kong DOH, 2003) , no risk was associated with sharing an apartment building or workplace. In Singapore, 73.5% of cases were infected in healthcare institutions (overall, 49.3% were healthcare workers, 37.4% friends or visitors, and 13% other patients), 17.2% at home, and 3.4% in the community or workplace (Goh et al. 2006) .",

Interventions to reduce the average number of secondary infections (typically denoted \u211c) most expeditiously are preferable, provided all else (including, e.g., compliance and cost) is equal. The impact of such interventions depends crucially on pathogen life cycles and host contact patterns. Thus, in some environments, with some infectious agents, certain interventions may reduce disease transmission, whereas in other environments, or with other agents, the same interventions may not, despite being applied with equal diligence. As will be apparent, the natural history of SARS readily explains why encouraging people with compatible prodromal symptoms to seek care (and ensuring that clinicians and hospital infection control personnel had the wherewithal to diagnose and isolate them effectively) was only marginally less effective than quarantine. Because infected people are more easily identified when symptomatic, the greater efficiency of this intervention more than compensated for any deficit in its efficacy.",

Because \u211c = \u211c 0 (1 \u2212 p), where \u211c 0 is the basic reproduction number and p is the product of any intervention's efficiency and efficacy, we solve for the \u211c 0 at which \u211c = 1, below which threshold outbreaks subside. With the aforementioned 5% efficiency observed in Singapore and Taiwan, and assuming 100% efficacy (i.e., quarantined people infected no one), evidently quarantine could not control any disease whose \u211c 0 N 1.05.

Similarly, in Taiwan, only 24 probable cases were identified by quarantining 55,632 contacts and none by quarantining 95,828 travelers from SARS-affected areas (Hsieh et al. 2005 ). We do not know how many probable cases were quarantined in Beijing, but the ratio of contacts to patients reported by Pang et al.

If we make the simplifying assumptions that probabilities of transmission on contact reflect infectiousness, which is proportional to viral load (successive logarithms of which can, in turn, be represented via a continuous statistical distribution), and that contact rates do not change substantially during illnesses, we can determine from the appropriate cumulative distribution function when isolation would have prevented \u211c 0 \u2212 1 infections.",

As the causal agent was transmitted primarily via respiratory secretions (except possibly among residents of the Amoy Gardens apartment complex), it seems prudent to base our estimate on results from the throat washes. Given the assumptions outlined above, together with a gamma distribution, these results suggest that for a disease with \u211c 0 = 3, isolation that was 100% effective in blocking transmission could prevent \u211c 0 \u2212 1 infections (and thus lead to epidemic control) if implemented up to 5.2 days after symptom onset, on average (Fig. 1) . The operational requirements can be calculated for any efficacy. For example, isolation that was only 80% effective should suffice to effect disease containment if implemented up to 4.4 days after symptom onset under the given assumptions, and so on. Analyses of the earlier studies of Peiris et al. (2003) and Cheng et al. (2004) yield similar results. That said, we must emphasize that these simple calculations are intended to be heuristic. If contact rates declined sharply after symptom onset, for example, the time available for isolation would be overestimated. Day et al. (2006) , Fraser et al. (2004) and Lloyd-Smith et al. (2003) have developed frameworks for evaluating such questions more rigorously in future outbreaks of newly-emerging infectious diseases.",

Even the best modeling is limited by inaccurate or incomplete information. And during health crises, humanitarian needs trump record-keeping. Nonetheless, to ensure that interventions are modeled realistically, epidemiologists must scrutinize all available information lest observations that seem invaluable in hindsight be underappreciated or even overlooked. For example, Lipsitch et al. (2003; Fig. 1d ) observed that the mean number of secondary infections per case in Singapore climbed dramatically when time from onset to isolation exceeded four days. To our knowledge, however, the implication of this observation vis-\u00e0-vis the potential impact of case versus contact management has not heretofore been articulated. Nonetheless, the inference that infected people were not particularly infectious until acutely ill was subsequently substantiated by the isolation of the SARS coronavirus and assessment of viral loads and shedding as functions of time from symptom onset. Shortening the period between such observations and deductions will ensure that timely public health decisions are based on credible science in future.",

By their own account, the epidemiologists who performed the latter study would not have known what patterns to seek in historical records without the guidance provided by modeling.

In fact, biological inaccuracies in early models (compared by Ferguson et al. 2003 ) caused some policymakers with firsthand knowledge of smallpox to eschew modeling. From a policy perspective, therefore, modeling can serve many functions. Besides making qualitative predictions, models can also serve as tools or instruments with which to explore the nature of problems iteratively. Feng et al. (2009) , for example, have embedded analytical results from a generic model of a respiratory disease transmitted by close contact, but about which little else is known, in software that permits end users to explore a variety of possible responses. With such a modeling environment, one can evaluate control efforts for SARS, deduce the more general results of Day et al. (2006) and Fraser et al. (2004) , and possibly even guide official responses during future emergences of new human diseases. Models should not serve as the sole basis for policy decisions, but they are at least capable of illustrating the consequences of alternatives, including inaction, in a manner readily appreciable by policy makers.",

A dominant theme in the modeling literature about vaccine-preventable diseases, for example, is that everyone need not be vaccinated to control transmission. Indeed, to protect those who cannot receive live vaccines or who respond poorly, if at all (e.g., elderly people), it is essential to vaccinate those who might otherwise infect them. Thus, while endeavoring to \"stockpile enough [smallpox] vaccine for every man, woman, and child\" (Thompson 2002 ) may have reassured an electorate whose homeland had recently been violated, it also may have generated an expectation that will haunt us in future (when, e.g., production problems lead to shortages of influenza vaccine).

Modelers can contribute to their decision making by exploring the impact of alternative scenarios. Lest results be misleading, however, models must be faithful to available information, including expert opinion. Knowledgeable public health practitioners might have cautioned against overestimating the potential impact of managing contacts of SARS patients, and interpreted observations suggesting that infected people were not particularly infectious until acutely ill as an indication for managing cases instead. In retrospect, we might encourage policymakers to interpret the progressive shortening of intervals between symptom onset and isolation characterizing most if not all SARS outbreaks as tangible evidence of the potential of effective health communications, which could be invaluable in future crises. Absent such observations, conveying complex and occasionally nonintuitive results supporting policy decisions to public health and medical professionals is challenging. Lay audiences are even more difficult. By virtue of age variation in vaccine efficacy, for example, modelers know that people at risk of influenza complications may be better protected by vaccinating those who might otherwise infect them than by being vaccinated themselves (Bansal et al. 2006) . But do health policymakers? Nonetheless, where infectious diseases are concerned, citizens likely will act in ways they perceive as congruent with their own survival or self-interest, and that of their loved ones. Effective risk communication, including balanced presentations of modeled outcomes, ensures that the self-interested actions of individuals align with socially desirable outcomes.",

Henderson convened in 2002 and 2003 under the aegis of the Council on Public Health Preparedness, during which we learned among other things to appreciate experienced public health practitioners, who make invaluable modeling teammates.
