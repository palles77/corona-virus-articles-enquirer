            "text": "Increased autophagic vacuoles (AVs) occur in injured or degenerating neurons, under both developmental and pathological situations. Although regulation of starvation-induced autophagy has been extensively studied, less is known about autophagic responses to pathological damage. The neurotoxin 1-methyl-4phenylpyridinium (MPP \u0609 ) produces mitochondriatargeted injury, which contributes to parkinsonism induced by 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine in mammals. Here, we demonstrate that MPP \u0609 elicited increased autophagy in SH-SY5Y cells, as assessed by electron microscopy, immunofluorescence for the autophagy protein LC3/Atg8, LC3 electrophoretic mobility shift, mitochondrial degradation, and monodansylcadaverine staining for late AVs/autolysosomes. During nutrient deprivation, class III phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K) stimulates autophagy in concert with the autophagy-regulatory protein beclin 1/Atg6. Although PI3K inhibitors and RNA interference knockdown of beclin 1 effectively inhibited autophagy elicited by amino acid deprivation, neither reduced MPP \u0609 -induced autophagic stress. In contrast, inhibition of mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase kinase reduced AV content, mitochondrial degradation, and cell death in MPP \u0609 -treated cells. RNA interference studies targeting core Atg proteins also reduced AV content and cell death. Likewise, in primary midbrain dopaminergic neurons, MPP \u0609 elicited increased AV content, which was reversed by inhibition of mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase kinase but not PI3K. These results implicate a role for extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK) signaling upstream of MPP \u0609 -elicited autophagic stress. Moreover, pathological stimulation of beclin 1-independent autophagy is associated with neuronal cell death. (Am J",

Compared with media-treated control cells, in which mitochondria represent the prominent cytoplasmic constituent when viewed at low magnification ( Figure 1A ), MPP \u03e9 -treated cells showed few mitochondria. Instead, the toxin-treated cells exhibited abundant AVs at different stages of evolution ( Figure 1 , B and C). Most AVs were in the same size distribution as starvation-induced mammalian autophagosomes (0.5 to 1.5 m in diameter) 33 ; however, larger double-and single-membrane AVs were also occasionally observed ( Figure 1C ). MDC is an autofluorescent dye shown empirically to localize to late AVs/lysosomes (L-AVs) but not endosomes. 46 The dye is trapped in acidic, membrane-rich organelles and also exhibits increased fluorescence quantum yield in response to the compacted lipid bilayers present in L-AVs. 47 MPP \u03e9 treatment increased both the average number of L-AVs per cell and the size distribution of L-AVs ( Figure 2 , A-C; Table 1 ). An increase in average L-AV size has also been reported in Purkinje cells subjected to trophic factor and potassium deprivation. 27 LC3 (Atg8) conjugation to the nascent AV membrane is required for initiation of autophagy. This is a ubiquitin-like reaction involving conjugation of LC3 to phos- phatidylethanolamine. 48 The shift from cytoplasmic (LC3-I) to the membrane-bound (LC3-II) form is accompanied by a shift to a faster migrating band detectable by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. 49, 50 MPP \u03e9 treatment elicited significantly increased levels of LC3-II in SH-SY5Y cells (Figure 2 , D and E). Increased AVs could also be detected using immunohistochemical staining for LC3. The results derived from MDC staining and LC3 immunohistochemistry were equivalent (for example, see Figure 4 versus Figure 5 ).",

            "text": "Although autophagy has been most intensively studied in response to limiting nutrient or trophic factor status, a growing body of literature implicates autophagy-related processes in neurological injury and disease mechanisms. Under these circumstances, the AV response may be triggered by damage to proteins or organelles. We found that a robust AV response is elicited in the MPP \u03e9 model of mitochondria-targeted neuronal injury. In both SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells and in primary mouse dopaminergic midbrain neurons, the MPP \u03e9 -induced AV response was resistant to inhibitors of a major starvationinduced autophagy signaling pathway involving beclin 1 and PI3K. In contrast, MEK inhibition reversed the AV increase and mitochondrial loss elicited by MPP \u03e9 (Figures 7, 8, and 10) , implicating ERK/MAPK signaling in regulating MPP \u03e9 -elicited autophagy. Moreover, Atg protein siRNA data indicate that pathological stimulation of beclin 1-independent autophagy is associated with neuronal cell death. One potential explanation for differences in the effects of PI3K inhibitors on starvation-versus injury-induced autophagy may relate to the relative balance of class I versus class III PI3K activities within a given cell type or in a given context. In intestinal carcinoma cells, class I and class III PI3K have opposing effects on autophagythe class III pathway promotes autophagy, whereas the class I pathway inhibits autophagy. 57 In situations where the class I PI3Ks are not activated, the inhibitory effects of PI3K inhibitors on autophagy predominate. However, under injury situations involving high class I PI3K activity, effects of inhibiting both pathways may cancel each other out in terms of autophagy induction. Although 3-MA was originally described as a specific inhibitor of autophagy, 56 it also inhibits the class I PI3K pathway (J.-H. Zhu and C.T. Chu, unpublished observation). In HT-29 carcinoma cells, 50 nmol/L WT is more effective at inhibiting autophagy than micromolar doses, perhaps reflecting the contribution of conflicting pathways (P. Codogno, IN-SERM, Ch\u00e2 tenay-Malabry, France, personal communication). In this context, it is interesting to note that the highest WT dose resulted in a slight increase in LC3-II levels ( Figure 4B ).",

However, despite effective knockdown of beclin 1 protein expression throughout the duration of MPP \u03e9 treatment, MPP \u03e9 -elicited AVs/L-AVs were unaffected by beclin 1 siRNA treatment, as assessed by MDC staining, LC3 immunofluorescence, and LC3-II gel shift.

In yeast, pexophagy, or selective degradation of peroxisomes is orchestrated by both a common set of autophagy genes and exquisitely specific regulatory mechanisms that prevent destruction of the last peroxisome. 63, 64 The yeast Atg 1 kinase has been implicated in selective and nonselective autophagy in yeast, but its substrates are still unknown, and kinases that serve similar roles have not yet been established in mammalian systems. 65 In pathological states, apparently selective destruction of the entire mitochondrial complement occurs after several apoptotic stimuli. 66 Although this was observed in the context of experimentally arrested apoptosis, mechanisms that target organelles for degradation may differ under physiological and pathological situations. In this regard, it is interesting to note that 3-MA/ WT-resistant autophagy has also been observed in another model of organelle-targeted injury (Mar\u00eda Isabel Colombo, Universidad Nacional de Cuyo, Mendoza, Argentina, personal communication).",

Moreover, time course, ultrastructural, and siRNA studies directed at the core Atg machinery all suggest that the protective effects of MEK/ ERK pathway inhibitors are mediated at least in part by changes in the mitochondrial autophagic response, rather than by preventing the initiating injury. The magnitude of protection conferred by siRNA studies was less than that conferred by UO126, however, suggesting that MEK inhibitors may also play additional roles. This is not surprising because multiple adaptive and death-promoting pathways are activated under pathological situations. On the other hand, it is possible that autophagy was only inhibited in a subset of cells and that stable short hairpin siRNA cell lines are needed to optimize knockdown further. Nevertheless, the data suggest that autophagy contributes to MEK/ERKdependent toxicity in MPP \u03e9 -treated cells.",

            "text": "It has been proposed that the degree of autophagy elicited may play a role in cell fate decisions, with low levels serving a homeostatic role and high levels promoting cell death, either directly or indirectly. Beclin 1 was originally identified as a Bcl-2-interacting protein, and competition for limiting amounts of beclin 1 has been shown to prevent harmful overactivation of autophagy. 36 It is interesting to note that autophagic responses induced in several pathological contexts including MPP \u03e9 toxicity (Figures 4, 5, and 10; Table 2 ) and viral replication 77 are resistant to inhibitors of this pathway. Thus, either the beclin 1/PI3K pathway is not involved in regulating autophagy in these pathological situations, or alternative mechanisms exist that can complement or bypass this pathway. Furthermore, beclin 1 independence implies the possibility of escape from regulatory feedback mechanisms, contributing to stress/injury when excessive autophagic demand cannot be balanced by cellular reserves. 75 To summarize, increased autophagic stress 75 is observed in aging and many disease states, most likely in response to protein or organelle damage. 78, 79 Although this may initially represent a compensatory response, recent studies also suggest that autophagy can play a pathogenic role, particularly when overstimulated. 14, 15, 66 Whichever the case, the current data indicate that regulation of autophagy elicited by MPP \u03e9 injury differs from that of starvation-induced autophagy. Differences in upstream regulation of autophagic responses in situations of organelle damage versus general deprivation stress, inefficient completion of degradative recycling, and/or loss of feedback mechanisms to prevent excessive activation of degradative systems may underlie divergent effects of autophagy in different contexts.",
