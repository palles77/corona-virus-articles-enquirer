While private sector organizations are impacted indirectly by these disease events, they are under-recognized yet effective stakeholders that can provide critical information, resources, and key partnerships to public and private health systems in response to and in preparation for potential infectious disease events and their socioeconomic consequences.",

While sectors outside of health are often considered in the context of negative externalities in driving disease events, the potential impacts they face from disease events warrants their engagement in finding multi-sectoral solutions to reduce and manage disease risks. On a broad scale, far-reaching impacts of pandemics parallel other disasters. The Ebola epidemic in West Africa demonstrated the serious, and unanticipated, economic toll of an emerging infectious disease. From 2013 to 2014, Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth in Liberia decreased from 8.7% to 0.7%, due to Ebola and lowering commodity prices, and GDP growth in Sierra Leone (excluding iron ore) decreased from 5.3% to 0.8% [2] . GDP growth in Guinea in 2015, predicted at 4%, fell to 0.1%. In all three countries, government revenues declined across the board, including direct taxes on companies, VAT receipts, and indirect taxes; Additionally, decline in private and foreign investors' confidence led to financing gaps of more than US $600 million over the two years [2] . These impacts cut across many sectors and undoubtedly have long-term consequences, including implications for insurers and reinsurers (e.g., health, life), as well as overall business continuity from lack of worker capacity during illness [3] , and markets are emerging to insure against pandemic risk (such as the World Bank's Pandemic Emergency Financing Facility, a parametric insurance vehicle designed to provide rapid disbursement of emergency finance [4] ). Yet engagement of the private sector, as well as public institutions beyond the health sector, remains limited in overall epidemic and pandemic planning and intervention.",

Disease burden may be captured in health metrics (e.g., number of deaths or Disability-Adjusted Life Years). While meaningful for the health community, it is increasingly becoming evident that this limited scope of analysis does not provide a comprehensive view of economic consequence of disease events, including contagion avoidance behaviors, to inform decision-making by a wider range of stakeholders and connect to broader economic development agendas. Direct and indirect economic impacts of disease events are affected by disease preparedness and prevention (practices that mitigate risk), the event itself (e.g., business continuity, supply chain disruption, trade and travel bans, public contagion avoidance behavior), and the event aftermath (e.g., long-term employment loss, permanently closed markets or farms, long-term stigmas associated with specific animal products, impacts of childhood lost education or being orphaned, etc.).",

Similarly, the World Health Organization (WHO) has proposed an economic impact guide as a framework within which broader economic impact of diseases can be calculated [7] , and a proposed framework to analyze economic consequences of biothreats has been developed that examines broader impacts, including human behavior, speed of resilience, and the \"fear factor\" dynamic that may cause irrational behaviors aimed at disease avoidance [8] . These are preceded by an extensive body of work from the animal health sector that thinks of disease as an issue beyond the veterinary sector, emphasizing the need for assessing economic impacts throughout a system to be inclusive of also the costs of expenditure and reaction to a disease outbreak or disease presence in addition to direct costs (in the case of livestock, for example, accounting for not just production but also productivity, and costs that are 'invisible' and thus often unaccounted for, such as effects on herd structure from diminished calving rates, effects on market access, animal and human welfare, etc.) [9] [10] [11] Impacts may be incurred upstream or downstream; understanding these different implications can therefore help to determine total costs of diseases and optimize the net benefits of decisions taken for prevention and control [12, 13] .",

However, for novel or reemerging pathogens with unexpected clinical outcomes, predictions can be difficult and cost estimates are frequently limited to short-term medical spending, health burden, or mortality. For example, while typical Zika infections without sequelae are unlikely to result in significant burden, disease manifestation in infants can have extensive impacts. Not only are direct medical expenses expected to build during pregnancy, but post-natal direct and indirect costs -particularly given the implied long-term extensive care required for these children as they grow -will be significant. Alfaro-Murillo et al. [16] conservatively estimated the lifetime direct medical cost associated with sequelae to microcephaly to be US $179,760, and the costs per case of Gillian-Barre Syndrome, a rare outcome of Zika cases (roughly 1%), to be US $56,863, in the US. Ulansky estimated that severe cases of GBS could cost up to US $500,000 per year and that lifetime health costs of microcephaly affected children could reach US $10 million each [17] . These estimates would vary by country, and do not include indirect costs such as specialized child-care support, parental productivity losses, psychological toll on families with children with microcephaly, or losses in productivity of the child once an adult and the support services required for that individual throughout life [16] . It was estimated the Zika epidemic thus far has cost Latin America and the Caribbean US $7-18 billion from 2015 to 2017 alone [18] .",

Fifty percent of reported livestock losses to the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE), the international standard-setting organization for livestock disease, are due to zoonoses, and zoonoses have a much higher percentage of animal slaughter (43% of livestock losses) as part of disposal for disease control compared to non-zoonotic events (6% of livestock losses) [14] . Yet the incentive for the agricultural sector (i.e., food animal production) to invest in infectious disease prevention often correlates with the economic relevance of the industry to its overall national GDP. For example, in the US where net meat exports near 12% of production [23] , investments in animal health infrastructure are prioritized. However, many developing countries that engage in agricultural trade have competing priorities resulting in lower investment in animal health infrastructure and protection, and thus may not employ adequate biosecurity measures. After Saudi Arabia and Yemen suffered an introduction of Rift Valley fever virus in 2000, Arabian countries banned imports of live animals from at least nine African countries, causing the Somalian livestock market to completely collapse. Ninety percent of Somalia's total income had been from livestock export, and the ban resulted in a loss of over 75% in exports and US $300 million [24] . This caused social and financial instability, loss of livelihoods and food security, and ultimately instability of the Somalian government, with a 25-36% reduction in GDP [24] .",

But beyond that, these impacts led to an additional US $229 million in indirect costs in lost tax revenue to government and losses in international trade, and a US $136 million cost for a control program for biosecurity and slaughter facilities [25] . Pork consumption and exports remained altered long-term (dropping by 80% during the outbreak and remaining 30% depressed post-outbreak; [26] ). Unmeasured economic impacts of this outbreak in Malaysia continue to this day. The pig farming industry in hard hit areas collapsed, forcing many pig farmers to attempt to transition to other jobs for which they had no training or education. Long-term unemployment or underemployment ensued for these families and they have been unable to reach their previous economic status, also affecting the many local businesses that thrived upon them [27] .",

For example, impacts may involve psychological, educational, or professional losses on the individual consumer and household. Not only did the unusually high death toll during the West Africa Ebola outbreak result in expanded social and household economic impacts, but also in stifled growth rates, lost productivity and wages due to inability to work or contagion fear, increased poverty and food insecurity, lost jobs, and lost education [1] . The extent and type of household economic impacts is often (although not exclusively) related to the population cohort most affected. For Ebola, the age group of 15-44 years, those engaged in the labor force and parents of young children, accounted for 57% of all infections, explaining why the impact on economic activity, poverty and food security was so substantial [1] . Sixty to 70% of households reported their incomes dropped significantly during the outbreak; consumption by households decreased and the prevalence of undernutrition rose [1] . Further, approximately 16,000 children lost parents to Ebola, leaving them orphans needing long-term care by relatives or other means [43] . The closure of schools, resulting in over 33 weeks of lost education, was further believed to have exposed children to several types of child abuse (including sexual exploitation and violence against young girls) with long-term impacts such as emotional trauma, permanent removal from education system, and unwanted pregnancies [44] . Military personnel were drawn from regular public safety duties to enforce quarantine facilities, a task for which they were not trained. These represent only partial examples of the ripple effects at the individual and household level that may impact public and private sectors in myriad short and long-term ways.",

These sectors have not traditionally been directly involved in disease impact assessments or preparedness planning (including prevention efforts), yet they have increasingly recognized the threat of health disasters wherein consumers are too fearful or unable to access their services because of supply chain or other business continuity impact, or their workforce is directly compromised. Inclusion of relevant non-health stakeholders in risk and impact assessments may provide more informed health impact assessments and enhanced awareness regarding preparedness opportunities, and may provide access to new collaborations and potential risk mitigation and resources. For example, the agricultural industry can promote strong biosecurity practices along their supply chains, the pharmaceutical industry can improve regulatory mechanisms or guidelines to discourage antibiotic resistance, utilities sectors can encourage water sourcing methods that minimizes health threats [45] and energy and extractives sectors can ensure a safe, reliable protein source for employees to reduce risky wildlife hunting practices that may be associated with natural resource development.",

Risk reduction guidelines for specific industries, whether taken up voluntarily or built into donor or private financing mechanisms, may also help with longer-term disease prevention or management; for example, audit and planning tools targeted at reducing risk of emerging infectious diseases have been developed for extractive industries [49] .The value of risk reduction aligns with the recent inclusion of 'Disease X' on the WHO's R&D Blueprint, acknowledging that the next epidemic could be caused by a pathogen currently unknown or unexpected. The wide impacts-both proven and potential-of known and unknown diseases warrants assurance that disease risks, responses and recognition of impacts are not relegated to only the health sector. ",

If these outbreaks had been prevented, the avoided losses would have averaged US $6.7 billion per year [14] . The wide-rangingand often substantial -economic impacts of epidemics are increasingly recognized far beyond the health sector. Yet few studies apply a One Health or multi-sectoral lens to consider costs and benefits of prevention versus response effort during planning exercises to ensure optimization of resources. With recent zoonotic disease prioritization exercises being conducted under the Global Health Security Agenda, countries have an opportunity to consider the focus and scope of their investments. Where possible, investments should seek to strengthen overall human, animal and environmental health systems for multi-hazard preparedness and broad societal benefits. Availability of quantitative impact data has been noted as limited for important livestock diseases, and differing methodologies result in estimates that are not comparable across and even within countries [12, 48, 50] ; the findings of our review are consistent with this and also suggest that impacts of human health emergencies from infectious disease are significant but reporting is ad hoc and likely incomplete. Public and private stakeholders at local, national and international levels must work together more systematically to ensure informed systems and risk and impact analysis, and encourage costsharing strategies for prevention and preparedness where possible and assess optimal intervention strategies when necessary. Infectious disease events in today's globalized world will require nothing less than such robust public-private partnerships and responsibility for optimal health and economic security.",
