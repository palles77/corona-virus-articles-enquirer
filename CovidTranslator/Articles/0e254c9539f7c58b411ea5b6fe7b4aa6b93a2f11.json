In the paper, according to the intensity properties of the chest radiograph, the chest radiographic image is divided into three subregions, and a piecewise linear transformation model is established. An approach of automatic enhancement is presented, based on the gray-level normalization. The average enhanced ratios of three subregions of the normal and severe acute respiratory syndrome image are increased by 10.70% and 25.55%, respectively. The technique is proved to be effective through the evaluation of the improved images.",

Because they are operated on the global area, they cannot meet the improved requirements simultaneously for the different parts of chest radiograph. In recent years, several local image enhancement algorithms have been presented. 1Y6 Some enhancement methods based on histogram equalization 7Y11 and modern signal processing techniques 12,13 to improve the effect of the chest radiograph are given also.",

The contrast can be reduced with increase of brightness by increasing C 1 . C 2 mainly adjusts the contrast of subregion I, and it almost does not affect other subregions. So we can alone change the output of C 2 to obtain the desired visualization of the lung region. C 3 adjusts the brightness of subregions II and III, but hardly affects subregion I. The output of C 3 should not be larger; otherwise, the tops of subregions II and III are much more brighter, which causes the structures to be undistinguishable. ",

Therefore, the ideal effect cannot be achieved automatically only with the linear gray-level transformation. It is necessary to normalize the gray-level distribution of the image. The histogram equalization processing gives an approach to force the image histogram to become uniform. To make the linear transformation of Equation (1) suitable to various chest radiographic images, we may first obtain the image of uniform histogram by means of the histogram equalization, which is a basis for performing the linear transformation in the next step.",
