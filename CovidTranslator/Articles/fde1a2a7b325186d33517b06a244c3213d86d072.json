            "text": "TGEV belongs to the family Coronaviridae, a large group of pleomorphic enveloped viruses with a positive-stranded RNA genome, and causes gastroenteritis in pigs resulting in a high mortality in neonates. Coronavirus proteins are expressed from a 'nested' set of subgenomic mRNAs with common 3' termini but different 5\" extensions which are translated to produce viral proteins whose genes are absent on the smaller mRNA species. Mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) and infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) mRNA species contain short non-coding sequences at their 5' ends which appear to be joined to the regions encoding the viral genes by discontinuous transcription. A consensus sequence identified upstream of each gene/ORF may act as a binding site for the RNA polymeraseleader complex [11, 12, 25, 36, 40] . It has been previously postulated that a heptameric sequence ACTAAAC [9, 10] or a hexameric sequence CTAAAC 166 P. Britton et al. [20, 33, 34] may be involved in the binding of the TGEV RNA polymeraseleader.",

TGEV infected cells, in addition to the genomic RNA, have six species of subgenomic viral mRNA [7, 18] . Expression and sequencing studies have shown that the 1.7 kb mRNA species encodes the nucleoprotein gene [7-9, 20, 34] and the 2.6 kb mRNA species encodes the integral membrane protein gene [ 10, 2 t, 26, 34] . Sequencing studies have shown that the 8.4 kb mRNA species encodes the peplomer gene [32] . The largest RNA species of about 25 kb must encode the RNA dependant-RNA polymerase as shown for IBV [5] . The 0.Tkb mRNA species [7, 9] contains a single ORF encoding a polypeptide (ORF-4) of Mr 9,000 [9, 20, 34] . Antisera raised against synthetic oligopeptides derived from ORF-4 reacted to a polypeptide of Mr 14,000 in TGEV infected cells (unpublished result). The other mRNA species of 3.0 kb and 3.9 kb [7, 18] have had no product assigned to them from either infected cells or virions. A polypeptide product of Mr 24,000 has been identified by in vitro translation of the 3.9 kb mRNA species (Purdue strain) in rabbit reticulocyte lysate [ 18] which was not detected in TGEV infected cells nor in purified virions and was not immuneprecipitated with anti-virion protein antibodies. Sequencing studies [34] , on the avirulent Purdue strain of TGEV (Purdue-115 [2] ), have shown that the 3.9 kb mRNA species has two possible ORFs, X2a and X2b, encoding putative polypeptides of Mr 7,700 and 18,800 and an ORF, X 1, encoding a polypeptide of Mr 9,200 on the 3.0kb species.",

Plasmids pTG 22 and pTG 11 were identified by their ability to hybridise to two TGEV cDNA fragments. One of the fragments, H 11 (1.5 kbp), originated from within the peplomer gene and the other, H 26 (0.6 kbp), originated from within the 5' coding region of the 3.9 kb mRNA species (unpublished result), pTG 22 only hybridised with H 26 whereas pTG 1 t hybridised with both H 26 and H 11 indicating that pTG 11 extended further into the peplomer gene than did pTG 22. The cDNA in plasmid pTG 11 is 2.98 kbp long and from its restriction map was shown to overlap pTG 22 ( Fig. 1 ) and extend 5.3 kb from the 3' end into the TGEV genome. From the size and position along the TGEV genome it was deduced that the cDNA from plasmids pTG 11 and pTG22 contained sequences from the 5' ends of the 3.0 kb and 3.9 kb mRNA species and part of the 3' end of the peplomer gene ( Fig. 1) .",

            "text": "The m R N A from a virulent British field isolate of TGEV was used to produce c D N A clones representing the 5' coding regions from the 3.0kb and 3.9 kb subgenomic m R N A species. Two independently isolated c D N A clones were sequenced allowing the identification of three ORFs, ORF-1 (186 bp), ORF-2 (732bp) and ORF-3 (243 bp) in the viral sense strand (Figs. 1 and 2) . The initiation codon of ORF-1 was preceded by the heptameric sequence, ACTAAAC, previously described as preceding the TGEV nucleoprotein, integral membrane protein and ORF-4 genes. ORF-2 is not preceded by the A C T A A A C sequence, though it has similar sequences present, and does not appear to be expressed on a separate m R N A species isolated from infected tissue culture cells. This may indicate that both ORFs may be expressed from the same message or that only one of them is translated; whether this occurs at the same or different times in the virus life-cycle is not known. The possibility that a new message be synthesized at a precise time in the virus life-cycle or that the message is only expressed in infected animals and not in tissue culture cells cannot be ruled out. ORF-3 is preceded by the hexameric sequence CTAAAC indicating that this hexameric sequence is all that is required for recognition by the TGEV RNA polymerase-leader complex. None of the three ORFs have any predicted N-terminal signal sequence using the weight-matrix method [41] , indicating that the polypeptides, if synthesised, may reside in the cell cytoplasm and not be associated with the viral envelope or infected cell membranes. The lack of an N-terminal signal sequence does not rule out the possibility of an internal signal sequence as found in the integral membrane proteins of IBV and MHV. The predicted ORF-1 product has an overall charge of-1 and contains about 46 % hydrophobic residues. The N-terminal end of the polypeptide appears to be acidic due to the presence of four aspartic and one glutamic acid residues between amino acids 12-19. The carboxyl terminus is slightly basic due to the presence of one arginine and two lysine residues between amino acids 50-56. There is one potential N-linked glycosylation site at residue 8 ( Fig. 2) possibly increasing the molecular weight of the gene product to Mr 9,000 assuming that the presence a single N-linked glycan site can add 2,000 to the molecular weight of a polypeptide [22] . ORF-2 product has an overall charge of + 4 and contains 46% hydrophobic residues. The N-terminus appears to be hydrophobic though the carboxyl terminus appears to be hydrophilic and acidic with four glutamic acid (three consecutive), three aspartic acid and two basic residues between amino acids 22%244. There are three potential N-linked glycosylation sites at residues 17, 22 and 132 (Fig.  2) possibly increasing the molecular weight of the gene product to Mr 33,600. ORF-3 product has an overall charge of + 4 and contains 57% hydrophobic residues. The polypeptide appears to be very hydrophobic with 14.8% of the amino acid residues being leucine and 16% isoleucine. This large percentage of leucine and isoleucine residues is similar to ORF-4 which has 34.6% of the amino acid residues as leucine and 5.1% isoleucine [9] . The product does not contain any potential N-linked glycosylation sites (Fig. 2) . mRNA with coding capacity for more than one ORF have been found in other coronaviruses. IBV mRNA D contains three potential ORFs, D 1 encoding a polypeptide Mr 6,700, D 2 encoding a polypeptide Mr 7,400, and D 3 encoding a polypeptide of M r 12,400. Chimaeric proteins have been produced [39] , consisting of the ORFs fused to the E. coli lacZ gene, and antisera raised against them were used to immunoprecipitate proteins from virus infected cells. A polypeptide corresponding to the size of D 3 was immuneprecipitated from IBV infected cells with antisera to the D 3 chimaera and there was some evidence that the D 2 product may also be synthesised. DNA containing either D 3 or D 2 with D 3 was cloned into pSP 64 and SP 6 polymerase was used to generate RNA, which was then translated in vitro. The D 2 and D 3 products were produced from the DNA containing both genes in the wheatgerm translation system but expression of D 2 in the rabbit reticulocyte lysate system was very poor. The DNA containing D 3 alone was expressed in both systems. The D 2 ORF, like ORF-1 in TGEV, has a pyrimidine at position -3 from the initiation codon whereas D 3 and TGEV ORF-2 have a purine at -3, making expression more favourable from the second ORF for TGEV and the third ORF for IBV. D 1 also has a pyrimidine at position -3 and there was no evidence that D 1 was produced in vivo.",

The two ORFs from the A 59 strain of MHV have been cloned into the pGEM vectors and the resulting RNA translated in the wheatgerm system [13] . Potypeptides of the correct size were synthesised but no products from in vitro translation of isolated viral poly(A)containing mRNA were detected. The second ORF, encoding the polypeptide Mr 9,600, was fused to the 5' end of the lacZ gene and the resulting chimaeric protein used to raise antibodies [27] . The antibodies raised against the chimaeric protein immune precipitated a polypeptide of Mr 9,600 in MHV infected cells. The first ORF, polypeptide Mrl3,000, on mRNA 5 has a pyrimidine at the -3 position from the initiation codon and the second ORF, polypeptide Mr 9,600, has a purine at the -3 position. Thus it appears that in IBV and MHV, where a mRNA species contains more than one ORF, expression appears to occur from the ORF with the more favourable initiation codon. IfTGEV is analogous, it appears that the ORF-2 gene is the more likely to be expressed, though the possibility that the other ORFs may be expressed but in much lower amounts, cannot be ruled out.",

Nucleotides 45-53 (Fig. 2) Fig. 2) from G in the Purdue strain to a T in the FS 772/70 strain leads to earlier termination of the ORF in the FS 772/70 strain. An insertion at position 342 and the base substitution at nucleotide 335 in the Purdue strain leads to an increase in the size of ORF-1 (X 2a Purdue strain) by 9 amino acids (Fig. 2) . The insertion at position 1312 of three bases leads to the insertion of an extra isoleucine residue at amino acid position 55 in ORF-3 (X 1 for the Purdue strain), see Fig. 2 . A change from a T residue in the Purdue strain to a G residue in FS 772/70 at nucleotide position 431 results in the formation of an ATG initiation codon for ORF-2. This results in a polypeptide of 244 amino acids for ORF-2 compared to X 2b of the Purdue strain which has 165 amino acids and initiates from nucleotide 666 on Fig. 2 . Both the independently isolated clones, pTG11 and pTG22, from the FS 772/70 strain showed the same sequence and neither had the 13 base deletion described in some of the Purdue cDNA clones [34] which led to the truncation of the X2b product. The homology between the amino acid sequences for the rest of the gene products between the two strains of TGEV is very high. There are only 3, 4, and 5 amino acid substitutions in ORFs 1-3, respectively, a similar result found for the nucleoprotein, integral membrane protein and ORF-4 gene products of these TGEV strains indicating that there has been very little change between the two viral genomes.",

However, IBV D 3, the ORF from MHV mRNA 4 and TGEV ORF-3 all have hydrophobic N-termini and hydrophilic C-termini and are of similar amino acid length indicating that they may have similar, but as yet unknown, function. ORF-B from MHV mRNA 5 and TGEV ORF-1 have very similar overall charges and have hydrophobic N-termini suggesting some similarity in function. Neither MHV or IBV have a protein of similar size to TGEV ORF-2 indicating that this gene product may be unique to TGEV. It will be interesting to compare the sequences of the other coronaviruses belonging to the TGEV sub-group when they become available for the presence of ORF-2. Comparison of TGEV ORFs 1-3 with the PIR protein database showed that there was no significant homology with any of the proteins in the databank using the FASTA program [31] or by using the SWEEP program against the Leeds University protein database. No homology was found by comparing the nucleotide sequences of ORFs 1-3 against the EMBL [17] or GENBANK [17 nucleic acid database using the FASTN program [28] . No homologies were found by screening the amino acid sequences of ORFs 1-3 against the derived amino acids from all the nucleic acid sequences in GENBANK using the TFASTA program [31] .",
