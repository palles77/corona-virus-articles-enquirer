The apparatus consists of a microwave radar (Tau Giken, LDR-1, Yokohama), an antenna box, a high-pass filter, an AD converter (MFU98-401B, Micro Science, Tokyo), and a personal computer (Fig. 1) . The microwave radar generates a very stable microwave signal at 1215 MHz with a maximum output power of 70 mW. The microwave radar system eliminates reflected microwaves from stationary objects around the antennas, and monitors only the small reflected waves from the subject's body because these waves are modulated by the subject's body motion [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] . A microwave antenna box (37 x 15 x 5 cm) with two microstripe antennas (radiating and receiving antennas, 70 mm in diameter) was connected to the microwave radar. The microwave radar output was transferred to the personal computer by the AD converter through a high-pass filter. The cutoff frequency of the high-pass filter was 1.3 Hz. The high-pass filter enhances the signal derived from the cardiac motion and attenuates the signal resulting from respiratory motion, which is a dominant component of the microwave radar output. The sampling interval of the microwave radar output was 1 ms. The RR intervals were derived from the peak intervals of the microwave radar output signal, which was modulated by the high-pass filter. The power spectrum was calculated using the MemCalc software package (GMS, Tokyo) for a 15 s period. MemCalc, which uses the maximum entropy method, needs a shorter data length (sampling duration) than fast Fourier transform (FFF). the apparatus was tested on a healthy volunteer (43 years old male). The microwave antenna box was located 40 cm away from the chest wall of the volunteer in a sitting position. As a reference, pectoral ECG was monitored along with the non-contact monitoring. The sampling interval of the pectoral ECG was 1 ms. The power spectrum of RR intervals derived by the non-contact apparatus for 15 s along with the power spectrum of RR intervals derived from ECG for the same period were calculated.",

Eleven doctors (73%) reported dim vision and eight doctors (53%) had severely miotic pupils (< 2 mm) [11] . Exposure to sarin, which is an acetylcholine receptor blocker may change sympathovagal balance. In addition, using detailed epidemiologic data on severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) from Singapore in 2003, it has been estimated that a single infectious case of SARS could infect about three secondary cases in a population that has not yet instituted control measures [12] . In order to prevent secondary exposure of medical personnel to toxic materials under biochemical hazard conditions, our apparatus can monitor HRV without touching the patient. Our apparatus appears promising for future pre-hospital monitoring of nerve gas victims, septic patients or in predicting MODS patients, inside an isolator or in the field for mass casualties under biochemical hazard circumstances.",
