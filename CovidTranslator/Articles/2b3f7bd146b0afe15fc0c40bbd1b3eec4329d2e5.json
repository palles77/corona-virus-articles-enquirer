            "text": "A defective-interfering (DI) RNA of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) was developed as a vector for expressing MHV hemagglutinin/esterase (HE) protein. The virus containing an expressed HE protein (A59-DE-HE) was generated by infecting cells with MHV-A59, which does not express HE, and transfecting the in vitro-transcribed DI RNA containing the HE gene. A similar virus (A59-DE-CAT) expressing the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) was used as a control. These viruses were inoculated intracerebrally into mice, and the role of the HE protein in viral pathogenesis was evaluated. Results showed that all mice infected with parental A59 or A59-DE-CAT succumbed to infection by 9 days postinfection (p.i.), demonstrating that inclusion of the DI did not by itself alter pathogenesis. In contrast, 60% of mice infected with A59-DE-HE survived infection. HE-or CAT-specific subgenomic mRNAs were detected in the brains at days 1 and 2 p.i. but not later, indicating that the genes in the DI vector were expressed only in the early stage of viral infection. No significant difference in virus titer or viral antigen expression in brains was observed between A59-DE-HEand A59-DE-CAT-infected mice, suggesting that virus replication in brain was not affected by the expression of HE. However, at day 3 p.i. there was a slight increase in the extent of inflammatory cell infiltration in the brains of the A59-DE-HE-infected mice. Surprisingly, virus titers in the livers of A59-DE-HE-infected mice were 3 log 10 lower than that of the A59-DE-CAT-infected mice at day 6 p.i. Also, substantially less necrosis and viral antigen were detected in the livers of the A59-DE-HE-infected mice. This may account for the reduced mortality of these mice. The possible contribution of the host immune system to this difference in pathogenesis was analyzed by comparing the expression of four cytokines. Results showed that both tumor necrosis factor-\u2423 and interleukin-6 mRNAs increased in the brains of the A59-DE-HE-infected mice at day 2 p.i., whereas interferon-\u2425 and interleukin-1\u2423 mRNAs were similar between A59-DE-HE-and A59-DE-CAT-infected mice. These data suggest that the transient expression of HE protein enhances an early innate immune response, possibly contributing to the eventual clearance of virus from the liver. This study indicates the feasibility of the DI expression system for studying roles of viral proteins during MHV infection.",

We have recently developed an alternative approach, namely, a defective\u00b1interfering (DI) RNA (Makino et al. 1985 (Makino et al. , 1991 , which functions like a minigenome, as an expression vector . Such a vector can express viral or foreign proteins, including cytokines (Liao et al. 1995; Zhang et al. 1997) , thus allowing more critical analysis of the functional role of these proteins in coronavirus pathogenesis.",

In addition to the genomic-length RNA, six or seven subgenomic mRNAs are synthesized in infected cells. These RNAs are conested at the 3\u0408 end and extend toward the 5\u0408 end to different lengths at intergenic (IG) regions (Lai et al. 1981) . Each mRNA contains a leader RNA of approximately 70 nt at the 5\u0408 end, which is identical to the leader of the genomic RNA (Lai et al. , 1984 . The IG sequence serves as an initiation site and is required for the synthesis of a subgenomic mRNA.

            "text": "MHV contains four or five structural proteins. The spike (S) protein is the major surface glycoprotein of the virion. It facilitates the attachment of virus to the cellular receptors, elicits the production of neutralizing antibodies, and induces cell fusion (Sturman and Holmes, 1983) . The membrane (M) glycoprotein is also associated with the viral envelope and, together with another viral envelope (E) protein, is required for virus assembly (Bos et al. 1996; Vennema et al. 1996) . The nucleocapsid (N) protein is a phosphorylated protein which together with the viral genomic RNA forms the nucleocapsid. The hemagglutinin/esterase (HE) protein is an optional envelope protein, present only in some MHV strains . It contains hemagglutination (receptor-binding) and acetylesterase (receptor-destroying) activities, similar to the HE protein of influenza C virus (Herrler et al. 1985 (Herrler et al. , 1888 Yokomori et al. 1989 ). The HE protein binds sialic acidcontaining cell surface molecules. The precise role of the HE protein in coronaviral infection is not clear. It has been shown that the HE protein of bovine coronavirus induced the production of neutralizing antibodies and that inhibition of the esterase activity resulted in a 100-to 400-fold reduction in viral infectivity, suggesting an important role of the HE protein in viral infectivity (Deregt and Babiuk, 1987; Vlasak et al. 1988) . In contrast, no neutralizing antibody specific for the HE protein of MHV has been identified , and expression of the HE protein alone, without the S protein, is not sufficient to initiate MHV infection (Gagneten et al. 1995 ). An MHV variant that expresses abundant HE appeared to be more neurovirulent than the one that expresses little HE (Yokomori et al. 1995) . Consistent with these data, passive immunization with HE monoclonal antibodies protected mice from lethal infection and altered the pathogenicity . These findings suggest that the HE protein contributes to viral neuropathogenicity by influencing either the rate of virus spread, viral tropism, or both (Yokomori et al. 1995) . Although five separate clonal populations expressing either high or low levels of HE protein yielded identical results, no precise role of the HE protein could be unequivocally determined because these virus variants may contain additional mutations in other viral genes.",

In this system, the expression of the HE-containing DI RNA requires the presence of a helper MHV, and the expressed HE protein was shown to be at least in part incorporated into the virions. However, due to the lack of a specific packaging signal, the DI RNA cannot be efficiently packaged into virus particles; it can only be copackaged nonspecifically with the helper virus particles for a limited number of cell culture passages. The DI RNA eventually loses its association with the helper virus and its ability to replicate during serial passages in cell culture. Therefore, the expression of the DI RNA is transient and does not involve a recombination between the helper virus genome and the DI RNA. In the present study, we used this DI RNA vector system to express the viral HE gene in the CNS of mice in the presence of an HE-deficient helper virus. We found that the transient expression of the HE protein by this vector altered viral pathogenesis. This study thus demonstrates unequivocally that HE protein plays a role in MHV pathogenesis and further demonstrates the feasibility of using this DI RNA vector for in vivo expression of a foreign protein.",

To assess the function of HE protein, we were interested in determining if the expression of a functional HE gene derived from JHM virus by the DI RNA vector could influence the pathogenesis of A59 virus (Fig. 1 ). Mice were infected ic with 1 \u03eb 10 5 PFU each of A59-DE-HE, A59-DE-CAT, or parental A59. Figure  2 shows that 100% of mice infected with A59-DE-CAT succumbed to infection by day 9 postinfection (p.i.), similar to mice infected with the parental A59 alone. These data demonstrate that inclusion of DI RNA that expresses a CAT gene did not by itself alter the outcome of A59 infection. In contrast, 60% of mice infected with A59-DE-HE virus survived infection. Mice infected with all three virus preparations showed similar signs of encephalitis (hunched back and ruffled fur) for the first 5 to 6 days p.i. Subsequently, clinical symptoms gradually improved in those A59-DE-HE-infected mice that had survived infection; by 12 to 14 days p.i., the clinical signs were completely resolved and no mice subsequently succumbed to infection. These data demonstrate that the expression of the JHM virus HE gene by the DI RNA vector substantially alters the pathogenesis of A59 virus infection.",

Thus, it was not clear whether the HE protein could be expressed from the DI vector within the CNS. To address this issue, RNA was extracted from brains of infected mice at various times p.i. and analyzed by RT\u00b1PCR using primers which specifically detect HE-containing RNA (see Materials and Methods). Since the HE-containing subgenomic mRNA is transcribed from the IG site within the vector RNA and contains a leader sequence at the 5\u0408 end, the PCR product corresponding to the subgenomic HE mRNA is distinguishable from that of the input DI RNA by their size (Fig. 1) . The result shows that the subgenomic HE mRNA was undetectable in RNA extracted from the brains of infected mice at 12 h p.i. (data not shown); however, it became detectable in RNA samples prepared from the brains of A59-DE-HE-infected mice at 24, 36, and 48 h p.i. (Table 1 shows data at 24 and 48 h p.i. only). No HE mRNA was detected in RNA samples obtained on day 4 or 6 p.i. Similarly, the mRNA encoding CAT could be detected in A59-DE-CAT-infected mice only at 24, 36, and 48 h p.i. (Table 1 ). These data suggest that the HE or the CAT gene indeed could be expressed from the DI RNA in the brains during in vivo infection but that their expression was limited to the first 2 days p.i., consistent with its limited ability to be serially passaged in vitro (Liao et al. 1995 ). Because of the low level of mRNA expression, the amounts of HE-or CAT-specific mRNA were not quantitatively compared.",

Based on the survival of most mice infected with A59-DE-HE, reduced viral replication in the CNS was anticipated.

We reasoned that, since HE protein expression was detectable only early in infection, a more significant reduction of virus titer in CNS might be detectable at an earlier time of infection; thus, virus titers in the CNS of mice infected with A59-DE-HE and A59-DE-CAT were compared at 1, 2, and 4 days p.i. Similar to the titers found at 6 days p.i., no significant difference was detected at any of the early time points (Table 1) .

Consistent with the similar amount of virus replication, no differences were detected in either the extent or the distribution of either mononuclear cell infiltration or viral antigen at 1 or 2 days p.i. in two separate experiments. However, at 3 days p.i., there was a slight but reproducible increase in the extent of inflammatory cell infiltration and reduced viral antigen in the mice infected with A59-DE-HE compared to mice infected with A59-DE-CAT (Fig. 3) . Quantitation of viral antigen-positive cells revealed approximately one-third fewer positive cells in the A59-DE-HE-infected mice than in those in A59-DE-CAT-infected mice. This difference was no longer noticeable by 6 days p.i. These data suggest that expression of the HE gene within the CNS resulted in a transient increase in CNS inflammation and reduction in viral antigen. This difference was transient and minor and did not appear sufficient to explain the increased survival of mice infected with A59-DE-HE.

Since differences in virus replication and pathogenesis of A59-DE-HE in the CNS did not appear to be sufficient to account for the differences in mortality, we explored the possibility that the decreased mortality in A59-DE-HE-infected mice was due to altered hepatotropism. Therefore, virus replication and pathological changes in the livers of mice infected with A59-DE-HE and A59-DE-CAT were compared. Table 2 shows that at day 1 p.i., there was approximately 1 log 10 less infectious virus recovered from the liver of mice infected with A59-DE-HE than from mice infected with A59-DE-CAT. However, no differences in virus replication were found at either day 2 or 4 p.i. Surprisingly, by day 6 p.i., when the A59-DE-CAT-infected mice were beginning to succumb to infection, there was a substantial reduction (3 log 10 ) in the amount of infectious virus in the liver of A59-DE-HE-infected mice (Table 2 ). This difference was reproducible in three independent experiments. Histological examination of the livers of mice infected with A59-DE-CAT showed increasing viral antigen and inflammatory changes with time throughout the infection. By day 6 p.i., the livers of these mice showed evidence of extensive necrosis with prominent viral antigen (Figs. 4A and 4B). Similar hepatic necrosis was found following ic infection with both parental A59 and A59-R (data not shown). A59-DE-HE-infected mice also showed similar inflammatory changes, hepatic necrosis, and viral antigen in the livers at day 1 or 2 p.i., compared to A59-DE-CAT-infected mice. However, by day 3 p.i., fewer viral antigen-positive cells and reduced necrosis were noted in mice infected with A59-DE-HE. By day 6 p.i., there was a significant reduction in the amount of viral antigen (Fig. 4D) , consistent with decreased titer of infectious virus (Table 2 ) and substantially less necrosis (Fig. 4C) , in contrast to the almost confluent necrosis found in the mice infected with either parental A59 or A59-DE-CAT (Figs. 4A and 4B) . Again, the A59 virus (A59-R) recovered from the CNS at day 6 p.i. did not differ from the original A59 virus. These data suggest that the transient expression of the HE gene in the CNS affected the virus replication and subsequent pathology in the liver.

Therefore, A59-DE-HE and A59-DE-CAT appeared to spread similarly from the CNS to spleen and liver.",

Histopathological studies of the HE-protected mice suggested that an early mononuclear infiltration into the CNS was associated with the protection by this monoclonal antibody. Subsequent comparisons of the pathogenicity of the JHM variants expressing different levels of HE demonstrated that the JHM variant which expresses high levels of HE replicated less efficiently in glial cells in vitro and preferentially infected neurons in vivo (Yokomori et al. 1995) . Together, these data suggested that HE protein is at least one of the factors influencing the neuropathogenesis of JHM in the CNS. However, the effect of HE protein on viral pathogenesis may depend on the genetic background of the virus. This question was difficult to assess in the previous studies since JHM variants used in those studies may differ not only in HE gene expression but also in other unscrutinized viral genes as well. In this report, we examined the influence of HE protein on neuropathogenesis of the A59 strain of MHV using a DI vector approach, so that the presence or the absence of HE can be studied on the same virus background. A59 was chosen because its pathogenesis in mice has been well described (Lavi et al. 1984 (Lavi et al. , 1986 and it does not produce any background level of the HE protein due to a mutation in the transcription start signal and a premature stop codon in the HE gene Shieh et al. 1989) . Our data showed that expression of the HE gene from the DI vector did indeed alter the pathogenesis of A59 infection by increasing the survival rate of the infected mice when compared to either parental A59 or A59 containing a CAT-expressing DI RNA (A59-DE-CAT). However, this higher survival rate was apparently due to the reduction in liver pathology. In the CNS, the expression of HE by DI RNA resulted in only a slight and transient increase of mononuclear cell infiltration and no alteration in cellular tropism. The apparent differences between this DI-expressed HE and the HE expressed directly from the virus was probably due to the transient nature of HE expression by the DI RNA, while the latter was expressed continuously throughout the infection. Nevertheless, this study shows that even transient expression of the HE protein can alter viral pathogenicity. These data removed two constraints upon the use of DI vector for expressing foreign proteins during viral infections. First, expression of an irrelevant gene from the DI RNA during infection did not alter pathogenesis of the virus. This suggests that the weak interference activity exhibited by DI RNA in vitro (Makino et al. 1985) plays very little role during virus infection in vivo. Second, the conservation of wild-type virus after the DI RNA had been lost suggested that the presence of DI RNA did not result in the selection of a variant virus, which potentially could have been derived by RNA recombination, either during in vitro preparation of the DI RNA-containing virus or during subsequent in vivo replication.",

At low infectious doses, the hepatitis usually resolves and survivors develop extensive chronic demyelination within the CNS (Lavi et al. 1984) . Our data using a relatively large infecting dose show that mice infected with the parental A59 or A59-DE-CAT or A59-DE-HE virus succumb to the infection most likely due to hepatic necrosis, since there was only relatively mild CNS pathology at the time of death of the infected mice. Because virus replication in the liver and spleen early in infection was similar between A59-DE-HE-and A59-DE-CAT-infected mice, it is unlikely that there was a fundamental difference in hepatotropism between these two viruses. Therefore, the striking resolution of hepatitis and the reduction in infectious virus in mice infected with A59-DE-HE at day 6 p.i. suggests that an early function of the innate immune response is most likely responsible for this phenomenon. It is worthy of note that no CD4 \u03e9 or CD8 \u03e9 T cell epitopes have been detected within the HE gene (Bergmann et al. 1996; Van der Veen, 1996) . In addition, there is no detectable anti-MHV antibody in the serum at the time when the hepatitis resolves (Parra et al. 1997) .",

Consistent with this notion, increased levels of TNF-\u2423 and IL-6 mRNA were detected in the CNS of mice infected with A59-DE-HE. Although TNF-\u2423 mRNA has previously been demonstrated to increase in the CNS following infection with the JHM strain of MHV (Pearce et al. 1994; Parra et al. 1997) , inhibition of TNF has no effect on either virus clearance or CNS mononuclear cell infiltration . Therefore, the potential role of increased TNF-\u2423 mRNA expression following expression of the HE protein is not clear. Increased IL-6 mRNA, another pleotropic cytokine (Van Snick, 1990) , was also detected in the CNS of A59-DE-HE-infected mice. IL-6 is secreted from both endothelial cells and astrocytes following MHV infection (Joseph et al. 1993) and IL-6 mRNA peaks rapidly in the CNS following MHV infection as a direct consequence of the immune response to infection (Parra et al. 1997) . Based on a kinetic analysis of IL-6 mRNA induction in the CNS following MHV infection (Parra et al. 1997) , IL-6 has been suggested to play a role in the inflammatory response via enhanced recruitment of mononuclear cells and activation of acute phase responses in addition to its role as a cofactor for CTL induction (Romano et al. 1997; Kopf et al. 1994) . Increased IL-6 mRNA present in the CNS of mice infected with A59-DE-HE virus is consistent with the increased mononuclear cell infiltration at a time during infection (day 3 p.i.) prior to detectable virus-specific immunity. These data support the suggestion that HE protein expression enhances the innate immune re-sponse, contributing to the eventual clearance of virus from the liver.",

Each DI stock consisted of a mixture of virus populations (helper virus alone, helper virus containing HE protein on the surface, and helper virus containing a copackaged DI genomic RNA); only the virus with a copackaged DI RNA could synthesize the HE protein. Prior to inoculation into animals, virus titers of the DI stocks were determined by plaque assay using DBT cells as previously described (Fleming et al. 1983 ). The titers were 7.5 \u03eb 10 7 for A59-DE-CAT and 8.0 \u03eb 10 7 for A59-DE-HE.
