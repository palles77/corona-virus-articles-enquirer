[3] [4] [5] In this study, we analyzed the clinical and laboratory data of most of the 2019-nCoV-infected patients in the China city Nanjing, aimed at revealing the unique pathological features of COVID-19 cases in comparison with non-2019-nCoV-caused pneumonia cases. Importantly, through correlation analysis of the changes in blood cell subgroups and key blood biochemical indexes of tissue injury, we have discovered unexpected clues of the pathogenic process following 2019-nCoV infection, which may provide valuable information for designing efficient approaches of treatment.",

Instead, the damage was likely to be caused by the virus itself. Therefore, we performed a correlation analysis between the number of lymphocyte subgroups and the biochemical indexes. We found that most of the indexes relating to organ injuries were negatively correlated with the number of lymphocytes in 2019-nCoV infected patients but not in non-2019-nCoV-infected pneumonia patients, further highlighting the virus infection -rather than the inflammatory reaction -as the possible cause of the multi-organ injury. Another supportive finding is that the difference in the number of monocytes, neutrophils, and NK cells is not significant in our analysis; while theoretically, these innate immune cells are the main player in a \"cytokine storm\".
