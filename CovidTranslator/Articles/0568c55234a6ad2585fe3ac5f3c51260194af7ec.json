These proteins were produced using baculovirus expression vector with Sf9 cells. Monoclonal antibodies J2G7 to NS1 and J5E1 to E protein were selected and conjugated with colloidal gold to produce the Zika IgG/IgM RDT kit (Zika RDT). Comparisons with ELISA, plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT), and PCR were done to investigate the analytical sensitivity of Zika RDT, which resulted in 100% identical results. Sensitivity and specificity of Zika RDT in a field test was determined using positive and negative samples from Brazil and Korea. The diagnostic accuracy of Zika RDT was fairly high; sensitivity and specificity for IgG was 99.0 and 99.3%, respectively, while for IgM it was 96.7 and 98.7%, respectively. Cross reaction with dengue virus was evaluated using anti-Dengue Mixed Titer Performance Panel (PVD201), in which the Zika RDT showed crossreactions with DENV in 16.7% and 5.6% in IgG and IgM, respectively. Cross reactions were not observed with West Nile, yellow fever, and hepatitis C virus infected sera. Zika RDT kit is very simple to use, rapid to assay, and very sensitive, and highly specific. Therefore, it would serve as a choice of method for point-of-care diagnosis and large scale surveys of ZIKV infection under clinical or field conditions worldwide in endemic areas.",

On the other hand, most of those who do have them have symptoms that are almost indistinguishable from those of other causes of undifferentiated systemic febrile illness, especially dengue (DENV) and chikungunya virus infections. To further confuse the issue, these infections are also transmitted by the Aedes mosquito and are found in the same regions as ZIKV infections [8] . Furthermore, co-infections with these viruses have also been reported [9, 10] . Additionally, these viral infections could share the transmission routes. ZIKV is primarily transmitted to people through the bite of an infected Aedes mosquito, mainly Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus, which are the same mosquitoes that transmit dengue, chikungunya, and yellow fever viruses. Sexual transmission and transmission through laboratory exposure are possible, and it is also theoretically possible through blood transfusion, organ and tissue transplant, fertility treatment, and breast feeding. Interestingly, ZIKV can also be transmitted through other non-vector-borne routes, including sexual intercourse, transplacental transmission, blood product transfusion, and possi-Development of a Rapid Diagnostic Test Kit to Detect IgG/ IgM Antibody against Zika Virus Using Monoclonal Antibodies to the Envelope and Non-structural Protein 1 of the Virus bly exposure to other bodily fluids with high viral loads [8, [11] [12] [13] [14] . Thus, the diagnosis of ZIKV infection cannot be reliably established by clinical features alone. As evidenced by a number of recently emerging viral epidemics, highly sensitive and specific laboratory diagnostics for these infections are essential for infection control measures [15] [16] [17] . Reverse transcriptase-PCR (RT-PCR) has been the most commonly used laboratory diagnostic assay for ZIKV infection worldwide. A number of specific real-time and conventional RT-PCR assays targeting the envelope (E), premembrane (prM), nonstructural proteins 1 (NS1), NS2B, NS3, and NS5 gene coding regions of the ZIKV genome have been described [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] . However, most of these assays were developed before the ZIKV epidemic occurred in the Americas, and there are up to 10 potential nucleotide mismatches between the sequences of the individual assays' primers and current epidemic virus strains [25] . The low sensitivity in these assays may also lead to false-negative results in up to 20-80% of patients, especially those with low viral loads in their blood or urine [25] .",

Additionally, an estimated 20-80% of ZIKV-infected patients may be undiagnosed because of the low viral loads in these patient's clinical specimens [25] . Thus, serologic test for ZIKV to detect ZIKV-specific IgM and neutralizing antibodies have been developed. Since IgM and neutralizing antibodies against ZIKV are detectable up to 12 weeks after onset of illness, serology tests should be followed when ZIKV RNA is negative on serum and urine from suspicious ZIKV infected patients.",

Serological diagnosis of ZIKV is far from easy because of extensive cross-reactivity between antibodies against other flaviviruses [35] . With the baculovirus expression system, we can obtain soluble expressed and highly purified recombinant E & NS1 proteins of ZIKV, and the resultant sensitivity and specificity of Zika RDT were excellent. Zika RDT showed 100% identical results with the standard panel using ELISA and PRNT. Zika RDT requires neither electricity nor any specific laboratory equipment. It is stable at 4-30\u02daC and has a long shelf life. It is simple to use so the assay is fast, and avoids blood being drawn from suspicious patients. These characteristics make it useful in a field setting. However, some cross-reaction with the DENV (16.7% and 5.6% for IgG and IgM, respectively) was observed. Fortunately, there was no cross-reaction with anti-West Nile virus, anti-yellow fever virus, anti-HCV serums. While the flavivirus NS1) is secreted by infected cells and is involved in immune evasion and pathogenesis [36] . Distinct features that may be related to the ZIKV neurotropism of the E protein [37, 38] and different electrostatic characteristics of the NS1 protein [39] would result in the high efficacy of our RDT and its differentiating of other flavivirus infections.",

Presumed causes of cross-reaction of Zika RDT to DENV may be caused by mixed infection of ZIKV and DENV both in vectors and in human, and overlapping clinical symptoms make differential diagnosis a problem. ZIKV and DENV show a higher than 50% homology in E and NS1 proteins [38] , and these common antigenic determinants may confuse the issue. Pre-existing immunity to prior DENV infection might also increase ZIKV replication through antibodydependent enhancement (ADE) of ZIKV infection [40] causing variable results. In this context, cross-reactivity between DENV and ZIKV seems inevitable. Indeed, it has been suggested that ZIKV must be considered another member of the DENV serocomplex [40] .",
