Furthermore, influenza A viruses are known to cause devastating pandemics in the human population as exemplified by the 1918 'Spanish' H1N1 pandemic with an estimated 50 million human deaths 3 . The ability of influenza A viruses to reassort their segmented genomes further facilitates the generation of pandemic viruses. Pigs in particular are known to represent a mixing vessel for genetic reassortment because of their high susceptibility for co-infections with different influenza A virus strains from various species [3] [4] [5] .",

Phylogenetic analysis of the haemagglutinin (HA) segment revealed that H17 is closely related to the HAs of influenza A viruses 6 , although structural and functional studies have indicated that this protein lacks a typical sialic acid-binding pocket and receptor-binding properties 7, 8 . Similarly surprising, N10 is only distantly related to neuraminidases (NA) of influenza A and B viruses, and lacks detectable sialidase activity 9, 10 . Despite these differences, phylogenetic analysis of the segments coding for the three polymerase subunits PB2, PB1 and PA, the nucleoprotein NP, the matrix protein M1 and M2, the non-structural protein NS1 and the nuclear export protein NEP suggests a closer relationship to influenza A viruses than to influenza B viruses 6 . Reconstitution of the polymerase complex demonstrated that the replication machinery of H17N10 is fully functional in human cells 6 . Moreover, the N-terminal domain of bat PA exhibits a tertiary structure and endonuclease activity similar to other conventional influenza A viruses 11 . Recently, a second bat influenza virus, designated H18N10, was identified from flat-faced fruit bats (Artibeus planirostris) from Peru, suggesting a broader distribution and diversity of bat influenza viruses at least in Central and South America 12 .",

We find that both the nucleoprotein NP and the polymerase subunit PB2 support the reconstitution of influenza A but not of influenza B virus polymerases in human cells. Functional compatibility is also observed in the formation of virus-like particles (VLPs) using HA and NA of the influenza A virus strain A/SC35M and all internal bat proteins. Based on these findings, we generate an infectious virus containing six out of the eight bat virus genes and two genes of the influenza A virus strain A/SC35M coding for H7 and N7. This virus replicates well in mammalian cells and mice, but not in avian cells or in embryonated chicken eggs without further adaptation. Despite the inability to reassort with other influenza A viruses, our data suggest that zoonotic transmission of bat influenza viruses into the human population cannot be excluded.",

Based on the phylogenetic relationship between the known bat influenza viruses and influenza A viruses 6,12 , we speculated that components of the replication machinery between these viruses might be compatible. We therefore reconstituted the viral ribonucleoprotein/polymerase complex of several influenza A viruses in human HEK293T cells and substituted single polymerase subunits or NP with the corresponding H17N10 components. Bat influenza virus NP, and to a certain degree PB2, supported the polymerase activity of the mouse-adapted A/ SC35M (H7N7) influenza A virus 14 , whereas replacement of PB1 and PA was not tolerated (Fig. 1a) . Vice versa, bat influenza virus polymerase activity did not change if NP was substituted by the corresponding protein from SC35M, highlighting the functional compatibility of NP between these two strains ( Supplementary  Fig. 1A Fig. 1a , Supplementary Fig. 1B) . In sharp contrast, no functional compatibility of the polymerases and NP of influenza B viruses B/Yamagata/73 and B/Lee/40 with any corresponding protein from the bat influenza virus was observed (Fig. 1b) , suggesting a closer relationship of the replication machinery of H17N10 with influenza A than with influenza B viruses. NP from the bat influenza virus also supported the formation of SC35M-specific VLPs containing viral ribonucleoproteins coding for green fluorescent protein (GFP; Fig. 1c Generation and characterization of chimeric bat influenza viruses. Encouraged by these results, we attempted to generate reassortant viruses by reverse genetics 15 using authentic SC35M HA and NA segments and all other genomic segments from A/ little yellow-shouldered bat/Guatemala/164/2009 (H17N10). However, no infectious viruses were obtained (Fig. 2a) . To overcome potential packaging problems that might interfere with efficient virus production 16 , the coding regions of SC35M HA and NA were flanked with either the corresponding noncoding regions (NCR) of bat influenza virus (50-HA/NA SC35M ) or with an additional 97-114 nucleotides of the 5 0 and 3 0 end of the H17and N10-coding regions (250-HA/NA SC35M ; Fig. 2a ). Successful rescue of infectious virus in human HEK293T cells and subsequent amplification in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells was only possible using the latter strategy (Fig. 2a) . This is consistent with the presence of specific packaging signals at the 5 0 and 3 0 ends of the viral segments that include portions of the coding region, as it has been shown to be the case for conventional influenza A virus 16 .",

Deep sequencing of the viral genomes revealed non-silent mutations in Bat C1 (NA V167I, PA S550R) and Bat C2 (PB1 E656G), respectively, whereas no mutation was found in the coding sequences of Bat C3 (Supplementary Table 2 ) compared with published sequences 6 . All three plaque-purified viruses replicated to similar titres in MDCK cells of up to 10 8 plaque-forming unit (PFU) per ml (Fig. 2c) . Efficient growth was also observed in the kidney-derived bat cell line EpoNi/22.1 (Fig. 2d ), but not in the bat cell line CarperAEC.B-3 (Supplementary Fig. 2A ). In newborn swine kidney (NSK) cells (Fig. 2e ) and cells derived from newborn pig trachea (NPTr; Supplementary Fig. 2B ), all three viruses grew to similar titres of up to 10 7 PFU per ml. Viral replication was also evident in both human lung carcinoma epithelial cells (A549; Supplementary Fig. 2C ) and primary human bronchial airway epithelial (HBAE) cell cultures, although not to the same extent compared with SC35M (Fig. 2f) . However, increased viral titres were observed in HBAE cells at later time points post infection (p.i.; Fig. 2f ). Sequence analysis at day 7 p.i. excluded the acquisition of new adaptive mutations. Replication of Bat C3 in the bat cell lines EpoNi/22.1 and CarperAEC.B-3 was reduced at lower temperature (33\u00b0C) and almost absent at 40\u00b0C ( Supplementary Fig. 2D ). This suggests that the optimal temperature for viral growth of the bat/SC35M chimera is around 37\u00b0C, consistent with the observation that the average temperature of Sturnira lilium is 36.4\u00b0C (ref. 17) , the bat species in which the H17N10 viral genomes were identified. Together, these data suggest that the bat influenza viral proteins in combination with HA and NA of SC35M fully support viral replication in various mammalian species, including primary HBAE cells, although, in general, the bat/SC35M chimeric viruses had showed slower replication kinetics and/or reached somewhat lower titres than the control SC35M virus in mammalian cells.",

Bat C2 replicated poorly and reached, independent of the infection dose, maximal lung titres of 3 \u00c2 10 3 PFU per lung, whereas infection with Bat C1 and C3 resulted in higher lung titres of up to 10 6 PFU per lung (Fig. 2g ). Viral titres of the latter two viruses remain elevated in lung and nasal turbinate 5-6 days p.i. (Supplementary Fig. 3A and B). However, infection of BALB/c mice with up to 10 6 PFU of Bat C3 caused no weight loss and mortality ( Supplementary  Fig. 3C ). Similar viral lung titres were observed 72 h p.i. in B6 mice infected with 10 4 PFU of Bat C1, C2 and C3 ( Supplementary  Fig. 3D ).

To study the growth properties of Bat C1, C2 and C3 in avian cells, chicken hepatocellular carcinoma epithelial (LMH) cells and chicken fibroblasts (DF-1) were infected at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.01. In LMH cells, growth of the chimeric viruses, especially of Bat C3, was severely compromised compared with SC35M (Fig. 3a) . In contrast, all three viruses replicated in DF-1 cells to viral titres of up to 10 7 PFU per ml, although with slower Table 4 ). Intriguingly, Bat C1, C2 and C3 that were passaged in DF-1 cells replicated to higher titres in embryonated chicken eggs than the corresponding viruses passaged in MDCK cells (Fig. 3c) . The mutations acquired after one passage in DF-1 cells (Supplementary Table 3 ) were also maintained in eggs (Supplementary Table 4 ). Non-silent mutations resulted in amino-acid changes in HA, PA, M1 and most frequently in M2 (N31S; Supplementary Table 4 ). Following passage in embryonated chicken eggs, these viruses gained the ability to replicate more efficiently in LMH cells (Fig. 3d ) than the original MDCK-derived viruses (Fig. 3a) . These findings suggest that the mutations acquired in DF-1 cells and in ovo enhanced viral replication in avian cells. For further proof, we rescued Bat/ SC35M chimeras (Bat-PA(S550R), Bat-M2(N31S,T70A), Bat-PA(S550R)M2(N31S,T70A) and",

As shown in Supplementary Fig. 4 , PA S550R as well as the PB1 E656G increased the polymerase activity in avian cells but not in human cells compared with wild-type bat polymerase. Together, these results indicate that the mutations observed following passage in DF-1 cells or chicken embryos led to increased replication in avian cells. Furthermore, this also suggests that bat influenza viruses are poorly adapted to avian hosts and adaptive mutations are required to overcome this species barrier.",

An important feature of influenza A viruses is the possibility to exchange genomic RNA segments with other influenza A viruses resulting in novel genotypes and phenotypes with zoonotic potential [3] [4] [5] 18 . Importantly, attempts to generate H17N10 and SC35M reassortant viruses by reverse genetic approaches using authentic viral segments even with only a single bat genomic segment were unsuccessful (Supplementary Table 5 ). Likewise, no reassortant viruses could be found after co-infection of MDCK cells with either Bat C3 and SC35M or Bat C3 and A/WSN/1933 (H1N1; Supplementary Table 6 ). This argues for incompatibilities of the H17N10 genomic RNA segments with segments of conventional influenza A viruses. In addition, the failure to generate a reassortant virus composed of authentic HA and NA segments of SC35M and the other six segments of H17N10 suggests RNA packaging incompatibilities (Fig. 2a) .",

Importantly, chimeric viruses could only be generated if the packaging elements of the two foreign RNA segments encoding HA and NA were replaced by the corresponding elements from the bat virus, suggesting that the packaging signals of the bat virus are not compatible with those of conventional influenza A viruses. Although the chimeric viruses replicated well in mammalian cells, viral replication was poor in avian cells and chicken embryos. This was rapidly overcome by the acquisition of mutations in various bat influenza virus gene segments, demonstrating the high plasticity of these gene products. In addition, this supports experimentally recent phylogenetic predictions of an independent evolution of bat influenza virus in bats without a history in avian species 23 .",

This suggests that the cellular receptors for the bat influenza virus are different from those of conventional influenza A viruses. It is possible that bat influenza viruses make use of cellular receptors that are specific for certain bat species and/or tissues, which could explain why we did not succeed in generation of recombinant authentic bat H17N10 under laboratory conditions. M2, another component of the influenza A virus envelope, has an important role in the uncoating process of conventional influenza A viruses by facilitating the pH-dependent dissociation of M1 from NP 24 . Interestingly, in a VLP assay, the bat M2 protein was not functional in the context of the SC35M NP and M1 proteins, and vice versa SC35M M2 protein was not functional in the context of the bat virus NP and M1 proteins (see Supplementary Table 1 ). This indicates that the bat virus M2 protein does not cooperate with the NP and M1 proteins of SC35M. Although the chimeric virus with the homotypic bat virus NP, M1 and M2 proteins turned out to be resistant to amantadine, a mutant virus emerged during passage in avian cells, which was highly sensitive to this drug. This finding argues for a proton channel activity of the bat M2 protein. Whether this activity exhibits also a similar role in the viral life cycle as the conventional M2 proteins has to be further investigated.",

Bat influenza viruses may bind to cellular receptors, which might be much more uncommon than sialic acids. In addition, the RNA packaging signals are different from those of conventional influenza A viruses thus impairing the emergence of reassortant viruses. Lack of reassortment with conventional influenza A viruses supports the inclusion of bat influenza viruses as a novel type (A-like) of influenza viruses. Moreover, M2 of the bat influenza virus did not functionally cooperate with NP and M1 proteins of conventional influenza A viruses. In addition, both PA and PB1 of H17N10 did not support polymerase activity of several influenza A virus polymerases. The probability that a non-human conventional influenza A virus infects people is already quite low, as even the most frequent human infections with non-human viruses are very low (39 human cases for H5N1 in 2013 and 375 human cases for H7N9 between May 2013 and February 2014 (WHO Global Influenza Program, http://www.who.int/influenza/en/)). However, both H5N1 and H7N9 viruses are able to infect human cells, albeit with a different receptor specificity than human influenza viruses, and are able to reassort with human influenza viruses. The inability of bat-derived influenza viruses to infect human cells and to reassort with conventional influenza A viruses significantly reduces the risk of these viruses to cause human infections as compared with non-human conventional influenza viruses, such as H5N1 and H7N9.",

To study reassortment events, MDCKII cells were co-infected with Bat C3 and SC35M, Bat C3 and WSN, or WSN and SC35M for 1 h at 37\u00b0C with a MOI as indicated in Supplementary Table 6 . After removal of the media, cells were incubated for 40 s with 0.1 M glycine-HCl (pH 2.2) and subsequently maintained at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO 2 in DMEM supplemented with 0.2% (v/w) BSA, 2 mM L-glutamine, 100 U penicillin per ml and 100 mg streptomycin per ml. After 48 h, virus-containing cell supernatants were collected and subjected to plaque assay on MDCKII cells. From each co-infection experiment, 100 plaques were picked and multiplied on MDCKII cells until cytophatic effect was visible, and cell culture (0.3 ml) supernatant was subjected to RNA purification. To establish the strain-specific reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) procedure, 30 individual plaques from each strain were picked and amplified. Viral RNA was obtained using QIAamp viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen) and eluted in 60 ml. Next, 5 ml of viral RNA were used as template to amplify influenza-specific cDNAs with a mixture of primers matching sequences in all eight segments from the three parental viruses (Supplementary Table 7 ). The one-step reverse transcription (RT)-PCR consisted in a 1-h RT at 42\u00b0C followed by 10 cycles of PCR, using Promega's AccessQuick RT-PCR system (Promega). 5% of the resulting cDNA solutions were used as template in segment-specific real-time PCR using LightCycler 480 SYBR Green I Master. Primer pairs were chosen empirically to amplify fragments from the parental viruses with different melting temperatures. Single peak melting temperatures were used to identify the parental origin of each segment. In the case of six samples that yielded inconclusive results, viral supernatant of clones that were positive for Bat and SC35M was used to infect MDCK cells for further plaque purification of at least four clones. The viral segments of these individual plaquepurified clones were analysed by RT-PCR using strand-specific primer and partial sequencing. This revealed in all cases either Bat C3 or SC35M, indicating that a mixture of these two viruses, was present in the original six samples.",
