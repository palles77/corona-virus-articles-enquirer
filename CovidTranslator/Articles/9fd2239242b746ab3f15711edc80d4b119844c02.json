Many of the neoplastic cells demonstrated typical nuclear grooving and there were very occasional classical Call-Exner bodies (granulosa cells surrounding eosinophilic secretions, illustrated by arrow in Fig. 2B ). By immunohistochemistry the neoplastic cells were negative for chromogranin (arguing very strongly against the possibility of phaeochromocytoma) but were positive for markers commonly seen in granulosa cell tumour including inhibin, calretinin and WT1. There was no vascular space invasion or perineural growth. Although the possibility of metastasis from an ovarian primary could not be excluded histologically, the favoured pathological diagnosis was a primary adrenal granulosa cell tumour of adult type. The patient subsequently underwent a dedicated pelvic ultrasound which failed to reveal any other ovarian or endometrial mass and further favoured the granulosa cell tumour as being of primary adrenal origin.",

This has only been published in the literature once before. 4 In that report electron microscopy was performed which suggested renin granules. Similar to our case, the patient had hypertension, high renin activity, hyperaldosteronism, hypokalaemia and a mass containing granulosa cells. Hypertension resolved after removal. Neither renin nor aldosterone levels were taken due to being on candesartan and perindopril. These antihypertensives confound the interpretation by blocking the renin-angiotensin axis. This increases the production of renin causing a falsely elevated result. It is recommended that antihypertensives be washed out for 2-3 weeks prior to testing. However, this was not feasible in our patient due to her refractory hypertension and risk of precipitating accelerated hypertension. Nonetheless, it is likely that our patient's pathology was renin mediated. This is implied by her features of hypertension and hypokalaemia.",

As expected, the burden of P. jirovecii was low with PCR cycle threshold (Ct) values ranging between 38 and 50. In contrast, when using this assay to diagnose Pneumocystis pneumonia and other disease, samples with a Ct value <37.3 cycles are typically classified as highly suggestive for P. jirovecii infection. 10 The mean age of colonised infants was 190.7 days (range 62-469 days). Four of these patients were co-infected with respiratory viruses including rhinovirus (n \u00bc 2), parainfluenza virus 3 (n \u00bc 2) and adenovirus (n \u00bc 1). In the other three patients, no respiratory viruses were detected. Attempts to perform MLST on the seven DNA extracts that yielded P. jirovecii DNA were unsuccessful for some of the loci despite multiple experiments. This was likely due to the low amounts of DNA template present in the extracts and was not further pursued. In contrast, the mtLSU gene target that is present in multiple copies in the P. jirovecii genome, was able to be amplified and sequenced in three of the DNA extracts.",

Although reports from elsewhere have demonstrated a higher prevalence, there were a number of methodological differences in our study. Here, we used a single copy target for real-time PCR whereas other studies using PCR have employed multi-copy PCR amplification targets such as the mtLSU or the major surface glycoprotein (MSG) genes. 3, 6, 9 In addition, previous studies reporting a significantly higher prevalence examined autopsy lung specimens. 1, 6 Because of the retrospective nature of the present pilot study, we were limited to using a small volume of specimen (500 mL) from the upper respiratory tract. Other studies using this specimen type have used between 200 and 3000 mL of sample for DNA extraction. 3, 12 The relative sensitivities of P. jirovecii PCR using different types of respiratory tract specimens is not well defined in children, but in adults lower respiratory tract specimens are preferred. 13 However, in practice, when assessing for colonisation in infants, sampling the upper respiratory tract by the least invasive means is of high importance.",
