Nucleic acid detection tests (NATs) have greatly improved the ability to detect respiratory viruses and bacterial pathogens that do not normally colonize the respiratory tract. In contrast, NATs do not yet have an established role for diagnosing pneumonia caused by bacteria that commonly colonize the nasopharynx due to difficulties discriminating between pathogens and coincidental carriage strains. New approaches are needed to distinguish infection from colonization, such as through use of quantitative methods and identification of discriminating cut-off levels. The recent realization that the lung microbiome exists has provided new insights into the pathogenesis of pneumonia involving the interaction between multiple microorganisms. New developments in molecular diagnostics must account for this new paradigm.",

The inability to obtain good quality specimens from the lower respiratory tract is one fundamental problem with pneumonia diagnostics. Whereas, it is relatively easy to get specimens from the site of infection with diseases such as meningitis, gastroenteritis, and endocarditis, obtaining representative and uncontaminated specimens from the lungs in pneumonia is a challenge. Sputum and bronchoscopic specimens may be contaminated by normal respiratory flora, and transthoracic lung aspirates are rarely performed despite a good safety profile [7] . Instead, we are currently reliant on testing more distant clinical specimens, particularly from the upper respiratory tract, blood, or urine. In general, testing these specimens has suboptimal sensitivity and/or specificity for determining the microbial etiology of pneumonia with confidence. A second important issue hindering our ability to determine pneumonia etiology is the fact that some major pneumonia pathogens, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Staphylococcus aureus, may also asymptomatically colonize the upper respiratory tract as part of normal oropharyngeal flora. Consequently, the detection of these microorganisms is insufficient by itself in order to attribute pneumonia causation.",

Current guidelines for the management of community-acquired pneumonia in adults typically recommend that microbiologic testing should be largely restricted to patients with more severe disease, and give guidance about the judicious use of blood cultures, sputum microscopy and culture, urinary antigen tests, and serology [8] [9] [10] . Guidelines for the management of community-acquired pneumonia in children are even more restrictive, again recommending that tests should mainly be used on patients with severe disease, with a focus on blood cultures and detection of respiratory viruses [11, 12] . Common to these guidelines is a cautious approach to the use of molecular diagnostics, although this may change with ongoing reviews. This caution is driven partly by the perceived and real lack of commercial and standardized assays and partly by lack of good data on diagnostic accuracy. There is also a lingering perception that molecular diagnostics are expensive tests and that use should be restricted on this basis. Cost is not the barrier it used to be, and the relative price of molecular diagnostics has actually fallen over recent years. Indeed, many molecular assays are now comparable in cost to conventional culture-based methods.",

While not exactly new (polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays for respiratory pathogens have been around for over 20 years), the widespread adoption of nucleic acid detection tests (NATs) by diagnostic laboratories has been relatively slow. This contrasts to NATs for other infectious diseases, which have been more quickly embraced by laboratories and clinicians [13] . A major reason for the slow uptake and acceptance of respiratory NATs has been the lack of commercial assays. This situation is changing rapidly, undoubtedly spurred on by recent outbreaks of global concern, such as pandemic influenza, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and Ebola [14] [15] [16] . Indeed, the increased availability of commercial assays is the major change in the area since I first started reviewing the role of molecular diagnostics in pneumonia over 10 years ago [17, 18] .",

They are also probably less affected by previous antimicrobial therapy than are culturebased diagnostic methods.

Indeed, the almost sole reliance on the urinary antigen test, which can only detect L. pneumophila serogroup 1, in some parts of the world has created a 'blind spot' for Legionnaires' disease caused by other species and serogroups [27] . NATs have long been used to detect Legionella infection [27] and are well-suited for this purpose. Legionella are not regarded as human colonizers [28] , and the detection of any amount of legionellae in a clinical specimen is regarded as diagnostic for infection, assuming contamination has not occurred during the testing process. Furthermore, all species and serogroups can be detected. Legionella DNA has been detected in both upper and lower respiratory samples, urine, and blood from patients with Legionnaires' disease [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] , although sputum and other lower respiratory samples are regarded as the specimens of choice [31] . Recently, the systematic use of PCR [31] and collection of induced sputum from patients unable to expectorate [35] have uncovered a hidden burden of Legionnaires' disease and have demonstrated the diagnostic utility of NATs for this disease. Arguably, NATs are now the test of choice for Legionnaires' disease.",

Interestingly, tuberculosis is unusual among infectious diseases in that NATs are less sensitive than culture, a possible consequence of difficulty with DNA extraction. Sensitivities are typically 92-100% for smear-positive specimens and 40-93% for smear-negative specimens [48] . Importantly, small, user-friendly platforms (such as the Xpert MTB/RIF assay) have been developed to an extent that they have been successfully deployed in many resource-poor locations where rapid diagnostics for tuberculosis are most needed [47, 49] .

First, is a particular microorganism present in the clinical specimen? Second, if the microorganism is present, is it causing this episode of pneumonia? To date, diagnostic efforts have focused almost exclusively on the first question and have ignored the second, which is usually much more difficult to answer unless the microorganism is never present as a colonizer (e.g. Legionella spp.). The efforts to use NATs as a diagnostic for pneumococcal pneumonia illustrate some of the key issues.",

S. pneumoniae is also a common nasopharyngeal colonizer, with carriage prevalence exceeding 50% among children in some regions of the world [58] . Earlier pneumococcal PCR assays, such as those targeting the pneumolysin gene, had problems of poor specificity due to detection of other, closely related streptococci [59] , although false-positive results are less likely with some of the currently more widely used targets (e.g. autolysin gene) [60] . S. pneumoniae is frequently detected by NATs in both upper and lower respiratory specimens from patients with pneumonia [59] , but the clinical implications of a positive result are uncertain given the relative high prevalence of pneumococcal carriage. Testing of blood for S. pneumoniae by PCR has been promoted as an alternative approach that can potentially avoid issues of contamination. Among Italian children, blood PCR showed promise as a diagnostic for invasive pneumococcal disease [61] [62] [63] [64] with high specificity [65] . However, in other populations, positive results have been reported in control participants who do not have suspected pneumococcal disease [66] , raising concerns about the broader utility of this approach. In particular, false-positive results are relatively common in children from developing countries where pneumococcal carriage is common [67] . Consequently, a positive pneumococcal NAT result alone is usually not enough to diagnose pneumococcal pneumonia. The possible exception is the use of NATs to detect S. pneumoniae in pleural fluid [68, 69] .",

The level and importance of regulation have been debated [73, 74] , and it is clear that a balance is needed between appropriate regulation of new diagnostics, while avoiding unnecessary barriers to the deployment of useful tests. The use of molecular tests for Legionnaires' disease is a good example of how assay regulation has had an impact on diagnostic strategies. Despite NATs being the diagnostic test of choice for Legionnaires' disease, the shortage of FDA-approved assays has severely limited the use of these tests in the USA, resulting in the continued use of suboptimal diagnostics and underdiagnosis of this disease [27] . Moreover, the absence of a prominent role in diagnostic algorithms has possibly led to an incorrect perception that the performance of NATs is inadequate. Hopefully, increased experience with these tests will reverse this perception.",

The use of modern culture-independent techniques has not supported this concept, consistently finding evidence of bacteria in the lower airways [75] . This important realization has challenged our traditional paradigm of pneumonia pathogenesis. The tradition view that pneumonia is caused by a single invasive pathogen in a normally sterile site is likely wrong. Increasing recognition that bacteria and viruses frequently interact in the causative pathway to pneumonia [76, 77] adds additional complexity, as does the frequent finding of polymicrobial infections [78] . Under the new paradigm, dominant species emerge from the lung ecosystem in pneumonia through uncertain mechanisms, and the bacterial versus viral pneumonia concept is too simplistic. Consequently, we probably need to use more sophisticated approaches to pneumonia diagnosis than assays that simply target single specific putative pathogens.",

Among HIV-infected adults in South Africa, quantitative PCR testing of nasopharyngeal samples distinguished between pneumococcal pneumonia and asymptomatic pneumococcal colonization with reasonable diagnostic accuracy [87, 88] . Data from other populations are needed in order to assess whether this method can be used in clinical practice. Microbial load in pneumonia can also be a prognostic marker. For example, pneumococcal density in the nasopharynx [89] and blood [90, 91] are associated with disease severity in adults.",

Statistical modeling techniques can be used to help overcome the limitations of diagnostic testing for pneumonia, particularly the lack of good comparator standards. Latent class analysis has been used to determine the prevalence of pneumonia caused by specific pathogens in epidemiologic studies [92, 93] and for the assessment of diagnostic tests in tuberculosis [94, 95] . Possibly the most sophisticated use of statistical modeling techniques in the context of pneumonia etiology is currently being undertaken as part of the Pneumonia Etiology Research for Child Health (PERCH) study [96] . PERCH is a large 7-country case-control study focused on the causes of severe pneumonia in young children from developing countries, the findings of which will be published in 2016. In this study, partially latent class models have been designed for estimating the population etiology distribution and the individual etiology probabilities for specific pneumonia pathogens, with a major focus on molecular diagnostic test results [97] . The findings of PERCH are awaited with great anticipation, as this approach has never before been so extensively applied to the etiology of an infectious disease.",

In contrast, NATs have yet to have an established role for several important bacterial pneumonia pathogens (e.g. S. pneumoniae) that also are asymptomatic colonizers of the upper respiratory tract. \u2022 Further developments in molecular tests need to focus on methods to help interpret the significance of positive results. The use of quantitative NATs and microbial load cutoffs has shown promise as one means to discriminate between colonizing and pathogenic microorganisms. \u2022 The recent revelation that the lung microbiome exists and new knowledge about the interaction between bacteria and viruses has changed the traditional view of pneumonia pathogenesis. New diagnostics need to account for this new paradigm and be less focused on just detecting specific known pathogens.",
