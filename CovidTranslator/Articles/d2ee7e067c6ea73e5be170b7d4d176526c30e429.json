It begins with reports of lectures by the recipients of ISAR's three major awards, held in memory of Gertrude (Trudy) Elion, Anton\u00edn (Tony) Hol\u00fd and William (Bill) Prusoff. These are followed by summaries of the three keynote addresses and the main presentations within the three mini-symposia on ''RNA Viruses\", ''Antiviral Chemistry\" and ''Emerging Viruses\". Because this review article simply provides short accounts of oral presentations, it is not generally accompanied by references to the scientific literature. Any descriptions of favorable treatment outcomes should not be taken as a recommendation for clinical use. Generally, I have added my personal comments on the meeting within the conclusion. In a few instances, I have added my own comment within the main text, indicated either by the wording or by the use of square brackets. One of my aims has been to illustrate how the great diversity of topics can stimulate thinking in other areas of antiviral research, one of the strengths of ICAR.",

This was one of the more active compounds in development at that time, better than the Roche and Idenix nucleosides but possibly a little less active than the Merck compound. An additional important factor, PSI-6130 lacked detectable cytotoxicity (CC 50 > 100 lM) in a panel of 5 cell lines (Clone A, Huh7, HepG2, CEM and PBM). Incidentally, the Merck compound showed no cytotoxicity in 3 cell lines but had a CC 50 of 5 lM in CEM cells and therefore was rejected. In contrast to many reported cytotoxicity values, these are derived Hodge / Antiviral Research 123 (2015) [172] [173] [174] [175] [176] [177] [178] [179] [180] [181] [182] [183] [184] [185] [186] [187] from assays in which the cells are replicating.

However, PSI-6130 was poorly absorbed orally and there was significant conversion to the inactive uridine analog. A prodrug approach, in collaboration with Roche, resulted in RG-7128 which increased the bioavailability of PSI-6130 by 5-fold but it was not an approach which could enhance the short half-life of PSI-6130-TP (T 1/2 = 5 h). It was considered highly desirable to have a triphosphate analog with a sufficiently long half-life to enable once-a-day dosing.",

This uridine-TP analog was a less active inhibitor of the HCV polymerase than the cytidine-TP analog (K i = 0.42 lM and 0.06 lM respectively) but had a much longer half-life (T 1/2 = 38 h and 5 h respectively). The long half-life of 38 h stimulated the interest of the research team. Because the uridine analog (PSI-6206) was inactive due to lack of metabolism to PSI-6206-MP, it was decided to use the phosphoramidate prodrug strategy to deliver the PSI-6206-MP into cells. [Phosphoramidate prodrugs were first introduced by Chris McGuigan, a former President of ISAR.] Although the approach is well known, there are side chains which can influence the properties of the prodrug. Over 140 phosphoramidate prodrugs of PSI-6206 were synthesized. These were evaluated in a cascade of tests which are of particular interest.",

The next steps were cytotoxicity evaluations in an extensive panel of cell lines, mitochondrial toxicity and bone marrow toxicity. [In my experience, it is rare to find a compound-screening strategy giving so much emphasis to the safety profile.] Only then, the compounds were tested for triphosphate levels, pharmacokinetic studies in rats and dogs and in vivo rat toxicity tests. Just 7 prodrugs were selected for cell culture triphosphate analysis. Of these, PSI-7851 gave the best levels of PSI-6206-TP in human cells. Three prodrugs were then tested in vivo, initially in a rat pharmacokinetic test. Of these, PSI-7851 gave the highest levels of PSI-6206-TP in liver, measured either by the maximum concentration (C max ) or by area-under-the-curve (AUC).

It showed no activity against a panel of other DNA and RNA viruses.

            "text": "Currently, there are many excellent drugs for HIV therapy but only two approved drugs target the attachment and entry of HIV into cells -maraviroc (Pfizer) and enfuvirtide (Roche). Of these, maraviroc acts as an antagonist to the cellular receptor, CCR5. However, HIV uses not only the CCR5 receptor (M-tropic virus) but also the CXCR4 receptor (T-tropic virus). The majority of patients, newly diagnosed with HIV infection, have only M-tropic HIV. In one study, just 5 of 59 (9%) had T-tropic virus, initially. In untreated patients, T-tropic virus will emerge in about half the patients, the average time being about 5 years. Could maraviroc therapy favor the selection of T-tropic HIV? This has important clinical implications because the T-tropic virus damages the immune system and thereby significantly (p < 0.001) increases the rate of progression to AIDS. There are no approved CXCR4 antagonists but clinical trials with AMD3100 and AMD11070 did validate the concept. Development was discontinued after Phase I and Phase II trials, respectively. For a long time now, no candidates have had a good enough safety profile for progression as a therapy for HIV but there is potential as cancer chemosensitizers. On the outside of cells, CXCL12 binds to CXCR4. The chemosensitizer releases the CXCL12 from CXCR4, thus enabling immune cells to destroy the cancer cells. AMD3100 is in Phase I/II trials to enhance the effects of chemotherapy in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). To obtain similar compounds, an efficient general synthetic scheme was developed using readily available amino acid building blocks. To evaluate these compounds, several cell-based assays were established, including a 2-day attachment assay (CXCR4 HIV-1 MAGI), a 6day infection assay (peripheral blood mononuclear cells [PBMC] and T-tropic HIV). To initiate the signaling pathway via CXCR4 receptor, CXCL12 (also known as SDF-1) binds to the receptor. To characterize the activity of any compound found to be active in the above assays, a radio-ligand displacement assay ( 125 I-labeled SDF-1 in CEM cells) was devised. TIQ-15 was active in both the MAGI and SDF-1 assays and it had good ''drug-like\" properties but needs optimization.",

The crystal structures have similar binding pockets. In the literature, AMD3451 had dual activity. Starting with the Aldrich database (5 million compounds) and using virtual screening for binding to both CCR5 and CXCR4, the top 300 compounds were identified. Of these, 38 compounds were purchased and tested (MAGI) to yield 13 compounds with activity at 100 lM, 3 of these active at 10 lM. One of these, ''compound 2\" had good activity in the MAGI (CCR5) and MAGI (CXCR4) assays (IC 50 = 3.8 and 0.8 lM respectively). It was a surprise to find that compound 2 was also active as a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) of HIV. The general synthetic route to similar compounds was shown. In three weeks, more than 50 compounds were synthesized. Having three parameters (binding to receptors CCR5, CXCR4 and NNRTI) would make structure-activity-relation ships (SAR) studies challenging. It was decided to focus on the binding to the two receptors. From these, ''compound 3\" (Fig. 5) was selected (IC 50 = 0.21 and 0.18 lM respectively). As an NNRTI, it was active at 10 lM. Interestingly, in the 125 I-SDF-1 displacement assay, there was no effect even at 1 mM. May it be an advantage to have a compound able to inhibit the binding of HIV to the receptor but be unable to displace SDF-1?",

Using mutants, it was found that the butterflyshaped dimer, but not the octameric ring, was essential for virus assembly. The dimers can further assemble and rearrange to form zigzag-shaped hexamers which lead to virus assembly. However, although octameric rings are not essential for virus assembly, mutants which prevent octameric ring formation are nonetheless lethal for virus replication. The ring controls transcription.

Unfortunately, in one incident that led to the deaths of health care workers, there was an attack on a Guinean health promotion team. This incident served as a warning to illustrate the seriousness of the threat posed. Conspiracy theories spread easily. Health care workers had difficulties at home, for example, their children being isolated by their class-mates at school. Just working in protective gear was stressful -heat exhaustion limited the safe working time to about 40 min. In an 8 h shift, an individual could be expected to work about 2 h in contact with Ebola patients. The elaborate protective procedures were successful in greatly limiting the risk of contracting Ebola but could not eliminate the risk totally. Three international staff became infected but were evacuated to their home countries and survived. Among the locally recruited staff, although there were exposures that were linked to workplace events, most of the investigations into staff illness found that their chief risk was outside of their work with MSF. The staff may have had family or friends infected with Ebola or performing healthcare activities outside of the MSF center. Naturally, these people, being healthcare workers and known to have experience with Ebola, were often under significant pressure in their home communities to provide discreet services.

Of 366 patients who had achieved a SVR after IFN therapy, only 3 relapsed over the next 5 years, a sustained response rate of 99.4%. Over a ten-year period, a SVR virtually eliminated the risk of dying due to liver-related disease. Survival was compared to an age-and sex-matched Dutch population. Patients without SVR had significantly greater risk of dying (p = <0.001) whereas those with SVR had a normal life span (p = 0.6). Furthermore, symptoms, due to HCV infection, are not just related to liver disease but there are various other manifestations that limit professional and social life. The classification of HCV strains is continually evolving -a recent special issue in Hepatology expanded the classification into 7 genotypes and 67 subtypes.",

Treatment should be prioritized for patients with significant liver disease, co-infection with HIV or HBV, debilitating fatigue or at risk of transmitting HCV. The choice of therapy depends on several factors but perhaps the more important are the genotype and the stage of liver disease, moderate (compensated) or severe (decompensated) cirrhosis. Preferred treatment options usually include SOF but the hardest-to-treat patients are those with genotype 3 with cirrhosis. In such patients, other options may be better, even including PegIFNa at least for the present.

However, the new NS5A inhibitor (velpatasvir, GS 5816) is active against all genotypes and against HCV strains and mutants resistant to ledipasvir. Also, it appears to have a high genetic barrier to resistance. Velpatasvir will be used with SOF as a fixed-dose combination pill. Approvals for both grazoprevir/elbasvir and SOF/velpatasvir are expected in early 2016. The second nucleoside analog to receive approval (about late 2016?) for HCV therapy may be MK-3682. It seems possible that all patients with HCV infection, so long as their liver disease is not too severe, will be treatable with virtually all patients achieving a cure.

These sites are highly conserved through all genotypes of HCV and bind to a host micro-RNA (miR-122) which is present in liver cells.

Miravirsen is a 15-base oligonucleotide containing 8 blocked bases (5 0 -m Cc m Att m G m Tca m Ca m Ct m C m C-3 0 ). It binds to miR-122 and so prevents its binding to viral RNA.

Within the near future, there is the prospect of being able to treat, and cure, virtually all the high-priority patients. Hopefully, the new therapies expected in 2016 will make it easier to treat all patients irrespective of genotype.

Rabies virus grown in cell cultures, then inactivated, is used in current vaccines which promote a good antibody response and have a better safety profile than the tissue-derived vaccines. Rabies is normally transmitted from an infected mammal via a bite, often into a muscle. The incubation period is very variable, from 2 weeks to 7 years but usually about 2 months. It is this long incubation period that enables PEP to protect the subject from clinical disease. Once the virus gets to the brain, mortality is essentially 100%.

Hamsters were inoculated with rabies virus in the leg muscle and treated with the plant-derived antibodies, 63-71-3 or E559, at 24 h post infection (pi) without co-administration of rabies vaccine.

A cell culture assay provided the first evidence for the activity of favipiravir against rabies virus. In a preliminary test in mice, with virus inoculated directly into the brain, there was essentially no protection provided by favipiravir treatment. However, this was certainly a severe test which does not represent the human clinical situation in which the incubation period is commonly 2 months. It is hoped that further evaluation of favipiravir will continue. One can build on the experience with favipiravir used to treat patients with Ebola infection in the current outbreak in West Africa -it can be used safely at higher doses than for influenza infections and there was an indication that favipiravir therapy was beneficial to those patients whose levels of Ebola virus at the time of presentation were low or moderate. Is it possible that the same may be true for patients with rabies virus infection when the exposure has been less severe? Aedes mosquito -the spread of DENV seems to be due to the spread of these mosquitoes. There are 4 serotypes of DENV. Prior infection with one serotype is protective against the same serotype but may enhance the severity of infection with another serotype via antibody-enhanced entry of the virus into cells.",

Although the current therapies give high cure rates in many cases, the cure rates are rather lower in those patients with genotype 3 and/or have very advanced liver disease. Hopefully, the new combination of SOF/ velpatasvir, (approval target date early 2016) will effectively treat patients with genotype 3. For patients with very advanced liver disease, liver transplantation will remain as an option but there is universal re-infection of the graft. After transplantation, HCV quasispecies evolve to generate HCV variants which have enhanced efficiency of viral entry into cells, have altered receptor use and are poorly neutralized by patient's antibodies.

CLDN1specific antibodies (CLDN1-mAb) prevent infection in cell culture models and show strong synergy with antiviral compounds. They are effective with all genotypes, although genotypes 2a and 6 require about a ten-fold higher dose than the other genotypes. Various functional assays have not revealed any toxicities. In uPA-SCID mice grafted with human hepatocytes, CLDN1 expression and localization is similar to that in human liver. This SCID mouse model was used for several proof-of-concept studies. To test for prevention of infection, CLDN1-mAb (500 lg) was administered by intraperitoneal (ip) injection at time of infection with HCV genotype 1b and twice more in the first week. There were good circulating levels of CLDN1-mAb to about the middle of the second week but reducing to almost baseline at week 2. In the control group, each of 5 mice had rapidly increasing HCV loads during the first two weeks, then reaching a plateau to 6 weeks. All 5 of the mice treated with CLDN1-mAb had undetectable HCV levels through to 6 weeks. To test for efficacy in SCID mice chronically infected with HCV genotype 2a, CLDN1-mAb was administered weekly for 4 doses (500 lg ip/dose). In the control mice (n = 4), HCV loads remained high. In the treated group (n = 5), the viral loads became undetectable during the four-week treatment period. In 4 mice, HCV remained undetectable to week 11. In a single mouse, the mAb levels were low and this may account for the relapse after the end of therapy. However, this virus showed no resistance to CLDN1-mAb. Using this model, monotherapy with CLDN1-mAb was shown to be active against all genotypes, there was no emergence of resistance and no signs of toxicity. Longer treatment times (7 weeks) results in the elimination of HCVinfected hepatocytes in this mouse model. This good efficacy with CLDN1-mAb appears to be due to its ability to inhibit cell-cell transmission. Over time, the HCVinfected cells are replaced by new uninfected cells. It is envisaged that CLDN1-mAb therapy offers an efficient and safe antiviral strategy, possibly in combination with antiviral compounds, for the prevention of liver graft infection. Thinking more broadly, this approach may be used to treat infections caused by other viruses, such as dengue, coxsackievirus and adenovirus.",

DDX3 is involved in several viral infections but not all by the same mechanism. For HIV, the newly synthesized viral RNA is exported through the nuclear membrane via binding to DDX3. For HCV, DDX3 interacts with the viral core protein which helps build the nucleocapsid. For Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), DDX3 binds to the viral RNA during replication. For poxvirus, DDX3 binds to the viral K7 protein which is essential to overcome the IFN-mediated cellular response.

Finally, an additional single-stranded (ss) RNA was introduced through a putative tunnel. As the ssRNA template enters the active site, it is encircled by three loops including A and B. The next step was to include a longer dsRNA into the model representative of the elongation phase. The priming loop was remodeled to accommodate it and the complex submitted to a MD simulation. Specific residues in the priming loop gained contact with the nascent RNA strand. These models indicate that the changing conformation of the loops, especially loop A and the priming loop, play an important role in enabling the polymerase to perform the different functions required for replication of viral RNA synthesis, initiation and elongation. These results are likely to be helpful in the design of DENV polymerase inhibitors. Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) was first isolated in 1952 from a patient in Tanzania.

The following January, the epidemic spread rapidly, peaking at the end of January (45,000 cases/week). By June 2006, there had been 266,000 cases, about 1/3 of the island population. With such an extensive outbreak in an area with good health facilities, some clinical aspects, previously only suspected (eg myocarditis), were confirmed and other aspects were newly observed (eg neurologic forms not just in children but also in adults, fulminant hepatitis, renal failure).

Treatment with favipiravir (T-705) may be a better option as it was highly potent in cell culture and in vivo. Anna briefly mentioned a report using a mouse model (Oestereich et al., 2014) . The placebo-treated mice died on days 3 and 4 post infection (p.i.) with CCHFV (100 PFU). With ribavirin, the survival time was prolonged, but the survival rate was not increased. Favipiravir was first tested at a high dose (150 mg/kg twice daily, orally) starting 1 h, 1 day or 2 days p.i. and ending on day 8. All these treatments protected mice fully with essentially no evidence of infection or disease. Only when treatment started 2 days p.i., minor changes in weight, temperature and aspartate amino transferase (AST) were detected at day 3 but not thereafter. Virus remained undetectable in blood and organs in all three groups throughout the observation period. To provide evidence for infection of the animals in the favipiravir treatment groups, the development of CCHFV-specific antibodies was investigated 21 days p.i. Only 1/10 (10%) of the animals treated 1 h p.i. developed antibodies, whereas 10/10 (100%) of the animals treated from day 1 or 2 p.i. developed antibodies. In a dose ranging study, favipiravir (15 and 3.75 mg/kg) was administered orally twice daily, starting 1 h p.i. and continuing to day 8. The higher dose gave good protection -no detectable virus in blood throughout the observation period, no virus in organs on day 3 and essentially no clinical signs of infection. However, the lower dose was only marginally active with prolonged survival time but no change in survival rate. The authors conclude that these data hold promise for clinical efficacy of favipiravir in human CCHF.",

Although a few other nucleotide analogs are in development, there seems to be a narrow SAR and sofosbuvir remains the only approved nucleotide analog. Michael Manns continued the story giving a detailed account of the clinical picture -how it has changed and is continuing to change rapidly -guide-lines have been written and rewritten. Early in 2016, new drugs are expected, including sofosbuvir combined with a new NS5A inhibitor (velpatasvir, GS 5816) which is active against all genotypes and against HCV strains and mutants resistant to ledipasvir (part of Harvoni).

Just 10 days after the initial alert, MSF opened their Ebola treatment unit (ETU) in Gu\u00e9ck\u00e9dou -an impressive achievement. The Ebola outbreak has exacted a huge human cost. However, I greatly admire all the healthcare workers who responded to the emergency, even though they were putting their own lives at risk. Armand briefly mentioned the clinical trials, including that with favipiravir. In the published results, those treated patients, who had moderate or low baseline levels of Ebola virus, generally had rapidly decreasing viral loads on days 2 and 4 after the start of therapy. With the Ebola outbreak continuing, do patients routinely have their viral loads measured? If it is unusual for viral loads to decrease at days 2 and 4 after entering an Ebola treatment center, then the viral load data gathered during the clinical trial gives the best indication that favipiravir is providing benefit to Ebola patients. Armand ended his presentation on a happier note -I follow suit in my report.",

The World Health Organization (WHO), reported (Ebola Situation Report -5 August 2015) ''There were 2 confirmed cases of Ebola virus disease (EVD) reported in the week to 2 August: 1 in Guinea and 1 in Sierra Leone. This is the lowest weekly total to have been reported since March 2014, and marks a third consecutive decline in weekly case incidence.\" The same report warns of the continuing difficulties facing the policy of containment. An individual was a known contact but was lost to follow-up. When Ebola infection was confirmed, intensive efforts traced over 1000 contacts. However, I am pleased to see that this WHO report mentions the trial of the Ebola \u00e7a suffit! ring vaccination trial in Guinea. Clusters of all",

Essentially, the trial's eligibility criteria allows vaccination of all healthy adults except pregnant women. The primary end-point was the number of laboratory-confirmed Ebola virus disease with onset of symptoms at least 10 days after randomization. There were 90 clusters, with a total population of 7651 people included in the planned interim analysis. There were 16 Ebola cases in the delayed vaccination group. No new cases of Ebola virus disease were diagnosed in vaccinees from the immediate or delayed groups from 6 days post-vaccination. Following this result, all clusters are being offered immediate vaccination.The elimination of Ebola infections seems hard to achieve but the WHO have reported (Ebola Situation Report -9 September 2015) continuing progress. Liberia has, again, been declared free of Ebola transmission. ''No new health worker infections were reported in the week to 6 September. There have been a total of 881 confirmed health worker infections reported from Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone since the start of the outbreak, with 513 reported deaths.\" ''The Ebola \u00e7a suffit! ring vaccination Phase 3 efficacy trial of the rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine has now been extended from Guinea to Sierra Leone. Contacts and contacts of contacts associated with new confirmed cases and who meet the trial's eligibility criteria will therefore be offered the vaccine.\"In the years to come, there will surely be new outbreaks of Ebola. The current outbreak has revealed the difficulties encountered with containment but also enabled the development of new options. Hopefully, all new outbreaks of Ebola will be quickly controlled by using the vaccine to ring-fence each index case and each patient may have a greater chance of survival if treated promptly with favipiravir. With vaccination, healthcare workers will not be putting their own lives at risk.There were three mini-symposia, ''RNA Viruses\", ''Antiviral Chemistry\" and ''Emerging Viruses\". These mini-symposia fulfilled an important aim of ICAR, to bring together knowledge and expertise from the whole spectrum of antiviral research. There was a good collection of RNA viruses (Norovirus, rabies. dengue, HEV, HCV, and RSV). For me, the highlight of the chemistry was the preparation of prodrugs for nucleotide triphosphates as this opens a door to new options. Such an approach is able to bypass all the activation steps normally needed for a nucleoside/tide and such an approach might be beneficial for antiviral, antibiotics, antitumor or simply for chemical biology questions using non-natural nucleoside triphosphates. The third mini-symposium emphasized how the research work in the antiviral area is continuing to expand and needs to do so with a sense of urgency.Finally, I have made a personal choice to include two further presentations. Steve Ludmerer described the work of their group with MK-8876 and ended his presentation with some important questions, to which I add another. When considering how to treat chronic HCV infection, viral resistance seems to be a more important parameter than initial potency. Of all the drugs licensed for the therapy of HCV or HIV, those showing the greatest genetic barrier to resistance are nucleoside/tide analogs. These bind to a catalytic site which is highly conserved and there are few options for mutations which remain viable. Of course, the converse is not necessarily true -some nucleoside/tide analogs may show a relatively low genetic barrier to resistance, for example, lamivudine. This presentation prompts one to consider how best to approach the therapy of other RNA viral diseases. What are the prospects for fusion inhibitors vs protease inhibitors vs nucleoside/tide polymerase inhibitors? For example, the nucleoside analog, ALS-8176, has shown excellent activity against RSV in a clinical experimental challenge trial in healthy volunteers. Also, ALS-8176 has been reported to demonstrate a high barrier to the development of viral resistance. Although infections with many RNA viruses are self-limiting in normally healthy people, such infections can be long-lasting in immunocompromised patients. It is important to have therapies which not only help those who would normally recover but also meet the requirements of those with high medical needs.Qin Yu described a hollow fiber culture system for growing human cells which were infected with human rhinovirus. In this system, it is possible to mimic accurately the human pharmacokinetics of the drug being evaluated. Qin showed how this system can be used to determine the most efficacious dosing regimen. From Qin's final comment, it seems that the fiber culture system is rarely used but I suggest that it is an important tool for evaluating compounds. At the 8th ICAR (1995 in Santa Fe), Hamzeh described the comparison between acyclovir (ACV) and penciclovir (PCV) in HSV-infected human cells in a hollow-fiber culture system (Hamzeh et al., 1995) . In a review (Vere Hodge and Field, 2013) , there is a brief summary of this work. With twice daily dosing with PCV, the trough levels of PCV-TP increased after each of the first four doses. In the Elion Lecture, Phil reported that the half-life of sofosbuvir-triphosphate was 38 h. I would expect that HCV therapy with sofosbuvir would be improved by starting with a loading dose. This fiber system could be used to prove what the optimum loading dose should be.I hope that my summary of this ICAR will reflect some of the enthusiasm that the speakers had for their subjects and that, even if the topics are not in one's own area of research, there is much of interest to be appreciated. Rarely, a major step forward in antiviral therapy happens within a short period of time. Within the last two years, the therapy of chronic HCV infections has been transformed. I am especially pleased that the 2015 ICAR program included outstanding talks describing this exciting progress. It takes much effort to organize so many excellent presentations and so I would like to add my thanks to the ISAR Officers and Conference Committee for another interesting and successful ICAR.",
