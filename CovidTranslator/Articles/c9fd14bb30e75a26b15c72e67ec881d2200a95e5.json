Design Cross sectional telephone survey using random digit dialling. Setting Interviews by telephone between 8 and 12 May. Participants 997 adults aged 18 or more who had heard of swine flu and spoke English. Main outcome measures Recommended change in behaviour (increases in handwashing and surface cleaning or plans made with a \"flu friend\") and avoidance behaviours (engaged in one or more of six behaviours such as avoiding large crowds or public transport). Results 37.8% of participants (n=377) reported performing any recommended behaviour change \"over the past four days . . . because of swine flu.\" 4.9% (n=49) had carried out any avoidance behaviour. Controlling for personal details and anxiety, recommended changes were associated with perceptions that swine flu is severe, that the risk of catching it is high risk, that the outbreak will continue for a long time, that the authorities can be trusted, that good information has been provided, that people can control their risk of catching swine flu, and that specific behaviours are effective in reducing the risk. Being uncertain about the outbreak and believing that the outbreak had been exaggerated were associated with a lower likelihood of change. The strongest predictor of behaviour change was ethnicity, with participants from ethnic minority groups being more likely to make recommended changes (odds ratio 3.2, 95% confidence interval 2.0 to 5.3) and carry out avoidance behaviours (4.1, 2.0 to 8.4).",

            "text": "In April 2009 a new strain of influenza virus, A/H1N1, commonly referred to as \"swine flu,\" began to spread in several countries around the world. Evidence that this new strain could pass from human to human led the World Health Organization to quickly raise its pandemic alert level to phase 5, representing \"a strong signal that a pandemic is imminent and that the time to finalise the organisation, communication and implementation of the planned mitigation measures is short.\" 1 This was subsequently raised to phase 6, indicating that a full global pandemic was under way. Given the lack of any specific vaccine against swine flu, mitigation measures in the United Kingdom have so far focused on identifying, treating, and isolating people who have the disease and educating the public about the steps that individuals can take to reduce the risk of transmission. These recommendations include using tissues when sneezing, washing hands regularly with soap and water, and setting up a network of \"flu friends\" to provide mutual assistance should someone become ill. 2 3 Encouraging the public to undertake specific behaviours related to hygiene has proved useful in containing previous outbreaks of infectious disease. 4 Motivating the public to adopt such behaviours can be difficult. Studies of how people responded to the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome in 2002 suggest that perceptions or beliefs about an outbreak may be important in determining compliance with official advice. In particular the literature on severe acute respiratory syndrome suggests that people may be more likely to comply with health related recommendations if they believe that the recommended behaviours are effective, 5 6 they perceive a high likelihood that they may be affected by the outbreak, [6] [7] [8] they perceive that the illness has severe consequences, 6 they believe that the illness is difficult to treat, 9 and they believe that the government is providing clear and sufficient information about the outbreak and can be trusted to control the spread of infection. 7 In addition, higher levels of anxiety or worry may be associated with an increase in behaviour changes. 5 10 In addition to these factors, two others may be relevant in determining whether people adopt precautionary behaviour in response to an outbreak. Firstly, a sense of public distrust exists about journalists and the sensationalising of health related stories. 11 People may fail to heed official advice conveyed through the media if they believe that this is \"just another health scare.\" Secondly, many scientific uncertainties surround swine flu. 12 Such uncertainty may influence whether people undertake precautionary behaviours. 13 Understanding the role of specific perceptions in motivating people to engage in precautionary behaviour may help health communicators to improve their messages about outbreaks of new infectious disease generally and swine flu specifically.",

This included an information leaflet sent to every home in the country, which discussed, among other things, the nature of swine flu, what the government had done to prepare for a pandemic, and what individuals could do to protect themselves and others. 3 On 11 June, after we had completed our data collection, WHO raised its pandemic alert status to phase 6.",

Most people reported that they had not changed the frequency of their hand washing (72%), increased the amount that they cleaned or disinfected things (83%), or discussed plans with a \"flu friend\" (85%). In fact most people (62%) had done none of these things. There was also little evidence that people were using behaviours with potentially damaging social or economic implications, 16 with fewer than 5% reporting that they had avoided people or places as a result of the outbreak. These results add to an extensive body of work that rebuts any suggestion that the public's first response when faced with a novel threat is to over-react or panic. 17 In practice, convincing the public that the threat is real is often a more pressing task for public health agencies than providing reassurance.",

As might be expected, 6-8 18 believing that there is currently a high risk of catching swine flu and that catching it will have severe consequences were both associated with behaviour change. Perceiving that the outbreak would continue for a long time was also a predictor of whether someone carried out recommended behaviours, presumably because this indicated a higher level of risk over the longer term. Less uncertainty about the outbreak and perceptions that the overall information given out was clear, consistent, and helpful were also associated with an increased likelihood of undertaking recommended changes to behaviour. The importance of reducing uncertainty and providing clear information has been suggested before 11 19 and although most accounts have focused on this as a way of reducing anxiety, these factors can also affect behavioural responses during major incidents. 20 In this study the mean scores of scales for \"good information\" and \"uncertainty\" suggested that public health communicators had some success in preventing confusion and in conveying a consistent set of comprehensible messages, which in turn seem to have increased rates of recommended behaviour change.",

Previous warnings or alerts that have seemingly come to nothing may determine how people perceive the present situation. 11 17 The high mean score on our exaggeration scale suggests that this may have been the case in the early stages of the swine flu outbreak. As might be expected, the perception that the incident had been hyped up was associated with a lower likelihood of behaviour change. Correcting such perceptions in the short term may not be easy. 17 A long history of well intentioned health warnings from the government and scientists have left the public uncertain about the relative importance of each new warning, while a constant flow of \"urgent\" health warnings based on limited, if any, evidence are carried on a daily basis by the UK media. 21 It is therefore unsurprising that 68% of our respondents agreed with one item in our exaggeration scale, \"I think that the media have over-exaggerated the risks of catching swine flu.\" A more encouraging finding was that the authorities still received a relatively high score for trust (mean score 3.9 of 5). Our finding that participants with higher trust in the government and the responding agencies were more likely to follow their recommendations seems logical and corresponds with evidence of a similar relation during the severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak. 7 Finally, most of our sample agreed that if they were careful they could reduce their risk of catching swine flu. This perception was associated with an increased probability of taking action. Fatalistic assumptions that \"there is nothing you can do\" have been observed in some people during previous incidents 22 but did not pose a major problem in this instance. More specific perceptions as to which particular actions are effective in reducing the risk revealed an interesting pattern. Whereas over 80% of participants believed that the hygiene measures recommended by the government were effective, around half of respondents also believed the same about avoiding other people or public transport. The perceived efficacy of such actions was associated with actually performing them. These data suggest that should recommendations for social distancing be required in this or any future outbreak, the public is likely to view such measures as effective.",

We did not have enough participants from ethnic minorities to carry out subgroup analyses and to identify which, if any, ethnic groups were reacting most to the outbreak. Previous research has found that worry and avoidance behaviours relating to terrorism are more common among minority groups in general than in white respondents, suggesting that this effect may be due to shared perceptions of vulnerability or low levels of control. 24 More research on the causes of this phenomenon is required.",

Maximising response rates takes time, however. 26 Yet after a major incident, data on perceptions and behaviours must be collected quickly if they are to have any impact on policy. 25 Because speed was important, we elected to use random digit dialling with quota sampling so that the demographic distribution of our sample matched that of the population of England, Scotland, and Wales. In practice the use of quotas prevented only 55 potential respondents from participating. The low response rate (7%) may be of more concern, although as participants were not informed of the survey topic until consent had been obtained, any non-response bias on the basis of interest in the topic should have been minimal. Given the nature of this telephone survey, we were unable to obtain any data about nonresponders with which to assess potential bias. Aside from design issues, another issue with our study was the choice of primary outcome measure. Behaviour change is not the same as compliance with official advice. For example, some people who reported not increasing their hand washing none the less may have complied with advice to wash hands \"often,\" 3 whereas others who did increase their hand washing may still have fallen short of the optimal frequency. If \"often\" is defined as 10 times or more a day 4 then 41.3% of our sample met the criterion for compliance. If defined as five or more times a day, 27 then 76.9% met the criterion. Using compliance rather than behaviour change as the outcome might have resulted in a different set of findings. However, while such data are of importance to disease modellers and policy makers, from the perspective of assessing public responses to an incident, behaviour change is the key indicator to consider. Compliance by default among people who frequently wash their hands is of lesser interest.",
