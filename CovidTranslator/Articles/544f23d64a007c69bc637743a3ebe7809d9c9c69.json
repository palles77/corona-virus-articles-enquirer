As overall data on the pandemic dynamics around the globe is likely to be biased by regions, often considerable in size and population, for which official statistics might be inaccurate, we decided not to compare overall model results with global data. Instead we limited the analysis of results to sixteen countries across four continents (see Table 2 ) which are, in our belief: a) divergent in the proportion of the tested population, quality of healthcare, and strength of undertaken preventing measures; b) likely to provide the public with real data; c) reporting number of cases high enough to assume their population exchange with the rest of the world did not significantly change the pandemic dynamics.",

This agrees well with intuition: the more tests are carried in the country, the larger becomes its local tDR and the model, for which the tDR value was fixed at the beginning of the simulation, starts underestimating the number of detected cases (e.g. Italy). On the contrary, for countries like Vietnam, Malaysia or Japan, a small number of carried tests leads to reduction of the local tDR to values below the assumed 0.0061, and the model overestimates the number of detected cases. Figures 4 -19 confront the number of actual confirmed COVID-19 cases with confidence intervals for the modelled number of diagnosed cases. Some countries present epidemic dynamics different from the model, however, the direction of these deviations may be explained by the measures undertaken by their governments, their societal response, or the number of tests carried per million of citizens (discussed in captions to figures). We believe that further modelling efforts, including careful parameters' modifications that reflect local response, would greatly improve the accuracy of the model, but it is outside of the scope of this work.",

This would indicate that the vast majority of the COVID-19 infections are so mild that they pass unnoticed. This is not implausible, considering the fact that there are 1 \u00b7 9 billion children aged below 15 years in the world (27% of the global population) and predominantly (ca. 90%) the course of their infections is mild or asymptomatic 23 . Additionally, they gather in large groups at schools on a regular basis which facilitates further disease transmission. Also, some COVID-19 cases may show atypical symptoms (e.g. diarrhoea) 24 which hinders correct diagnosis. Taking all this into account, plus the results of our model, one may risk a hypothesis that the virus is already more prevalent in the global population than shown in official statistics at the moment, and consequently, its mortality rate is much lower.",

Finally, the real spread of the virus should be assessed empirically by conducting a sufficient number of tests on fully random samples (currently most tests are limited to individuals with strong and typical symptoms).

At this stage, by no means should they be used as a reason for governmental decisions on lifting the precautions. Even if the true mortality of the virus is indeed lower than announced by the media, many people remain in the high-risk group. Lack of population resistance facilitates their contact with the virus and may lead to a rapid increase of severe cases in a short period of time (as seen in Italy) leading to the collapse of the healthcare system, which affects the entire society and results in many additional deaths not related to the virus itself. Careful use and tuning of non-drug intervention methods, constant balancing of the disease spread and healthcare capacity, protecting the most vulnerable individuals, farsighted anticipation and agility in decision making may altogether be able to minimize the number of deaths without resulting in the global economic breakdown. .
