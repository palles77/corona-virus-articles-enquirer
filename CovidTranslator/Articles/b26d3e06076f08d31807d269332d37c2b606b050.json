The high case fatality rate, human-tohuman transmission, wide-ranging reservoir distribution and lack of licensed intervention options are making NiV a serious regional and potential global public health problem. The objective of this study was to develop a fast-acting, single-dose NiV vaccine that could be implemented in a ring vaccination approach during outbreaks.",

Although a public health concern to regional, national and even international authorities, a widespread campaign to vaccinate a large percentage of the at-risk human population against NiV infection currently seems unfounded. Outbreaks are rare, result in relatively few cases, are focal and isolated, and human-to-human transmission is generally confined to health care workers and family members engaging in close contact with exposed individuals, thus, rather favoring a ring vaccination approach. Therefore, a vaccine that produces a rapid and robust immune response after a single immunization with the potential for peri-exposure application ('emergency vaccine') would be most beneficial.",

Using passive serum transfer, we further determined that full protection is conferred by glycoprotein (F, G)-specific antibodies, most likely the neutralizing fraction, elicited by the rVSV vaccines. However, other components of the immune system, such as cellular responses, also contribute to protection as demonstrated by partial efficacy and lack of protection in passive transfer studies in the case of the N expressing vaccine vector.",

All NiV-vaccinated animals had lower organ levels of viral RNA compared to the animals in the control groups (>10 3 TCID 50 equivalent/mg tissue), with rVSV-ZEBOV-GP-NiVF and rVSV-ZEBOV-GP-NiVG vaccinated animals showing organ loads <1 TCID 50 equivalent/mg tissue. rVSV-ZEBOV-GP-NiVN vaccinated animals showed a greater than 2-log reduction in viral organ loads compared to the rVSV-ZEBOV-GP vaccinated controls. In order to confirm that the positive immunohistochemistry described below (Fig. 4) represents replication of the challenge virus (NiV) rather than N expressed by the vaccine vector (rVSV-ZEBOV-GP-NiVN), we performed a VSV N-specific qRT-PCR assay.

            "text": "Our goal was to develop a fast-acting, single-dose NiV vaccine suitable for use as a ring vaccination approach during outbreaks as they currently occur in Bangladesh. We chose liveattenuated rVSV vectors as our platform due to their ease of genetic modification and their subsequent efficient and cost-effective manufacturing. We preferred a replication-competent vaccine as those generally provide better durability when compared to a replicationincompetent vaccine approaches, eliciting faster and more effective innate and adaptive immune responses [39] . Replication-competent vaccine approaches, however, are commonly associated with safety concerns, but all of our previous vaccine work using the rVSV platform, including immunization of several immune-compromised animal species, has assigned this approach a good safety record [26, 40] . Noteworthy, a live-attenuated rVSVbased vaccine vector was approved for use in a human laboratory exposure to Ebola virus [41] . Among commonly used replicating vaccine vectors, VSV provides advantages over similar platforms, such as the limited pre-existing immunity against VSV in the human population and the only rare and mild human disease caused by VSV, which is largely an animal pathogen [42, 43] . To further limit VSV immunity and pathogenicity, we removed VSV-G, the major target for neutralizing antibodies and a key VSV virulence factor [43] . VSV-G was replaced in the vaccine vector by ZEBOV-GP to overcome the lack of a functional surface protein for virus entry. Virus entry cannot be achieved by any of the chosen NiV antigens, because henipavirus cell entry is dependent on the presence of both G and F proteins [44] . The ZEBOV-GP was particularly chosen for its known targeting of important immune cells, such as mononuclear phagocytotic and antigen presenting cells [27, 33, 45] . Targeting of these cells allows for their strong stimulation and better antigen presentation by MHC class I and II pathways, and thus leads to more potent innate and adaptive immune responses [46, 47] .",

Previously it has been demonstrated that protection against NiV challenge can be afforded by passive serum transfer that contains neutralizing antibodies [8] . Additionally, m102.4, a human neutralizing monoclonal antibody, can protect against NiV and Hendra virus in several animal models [13, 48] . The rVSV vaccine vectors expressing NiV F or G both induced glycoproteinspecific antibody responses that conferred complete protection against NiV challenge in a serum transfer study. Neutralizing antibody responses are most likely key for protection, as serum transfer of N-specific antibodies did not show any protective effect, even though the role of non-neutralizing glycoprotein-specific antibodies for protection cannot be excluded. VSV is known to also elicit strong cellular immune responses [39, 49, 50] . The role of cellular immune responses mediated through rVSV vectors is supported here by the partial protection achieved through vaccination with the rVSV vector expressing NiV N as well as the lack of protection in serum transfer experiments using sera with N-specific nonneutralizing antibodies. Therefore, these new rVSV vectors might be stronger vaccine candidates than vaccine platforms that more selectively trigger humoral immune responses, such as subunit protein vaccines [9, 12, 18] .",

            "text": "Here we describe a vaccine approach and mechanism of protection that could be used to control NiV infections and spread in outbreak situation if used in a ring vaccination approach. Recent outbreaks have involved increased human-to-human transmission events, most often seen in family members or healthcare workers [7] . Due to the ease in identifying high-risk individuals, those in close contact with patients, fast-acting, single-dose vaccines, like the rVSV vectors here, would be advantageous for targeted use during outbreaks over vaccines that need multiple injections and thus require more time between vaccination and protection. Another advantage of replication-competent rVSVs has been its efficacy upon use peri-exposure, allowing for simultaneous vaccination and treatment in outbreak situations [26, 27, 33, 51, 52] . Future studies are aimed to assess time to immunity and periexposure treatment efficacy of these new rVSV NiV vectors as well as efficacy studies in a second animal model to fulfill FDA requirements for licensing. Tissues (brain, spleen, lung) were collected in RLT buffer from four animals per group on day 5 after challenge and homogenized prior to total RNA extraction. Quantitative RT-PCR using an N-specific primer and probe set was used to determine TCID 50 equivalents by extrapolating from a standard curve from a NiV seed stock of known titer. Individual animals are represented by dots and horizontal lines represent the mean, error bars indicate standard error of the mean (SEM). Serum was collected from groups of 18 hamsters 28 days after vaccination with 10 5 PFU of the specific vaccine vectors. One day prior to, and 1 day post challenge with 1000 LD 50 of NiV, groups of six na\u00efve hamsters were given 1 mL of sera from immunized animals and monitored for 42 days for signs of disease. Humoral immune responses to foreign proteins 26 days after rVSV vaccination as measured by ELISA (whole inactivated NiV particle antigen) and NTCID 50 assay (against live Nipah virus). ",

(B) Verification of foreign protein expression. ZEBOV-GP expression was verified by western blot analysis of rVSV vectorinfected cell lysates using the anti-ZEBOV-GP antibody 43.3.7. Expression of NiV proteins was verified by flow cytometry. Cells were infected with the different NiV proteinexpressing rVSV vaccines (colored lines) or uninfected (gray lines) and surfaced stained with antibodies specific for the respective protein, anti-G 1187 and anti-F 835. In the case of N expression (colored line), cells were fixed in 4%PFA, then per-meabilized using saponin, DeBuysscher et al. Page 12 Vaccine. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2016 April 12.",
