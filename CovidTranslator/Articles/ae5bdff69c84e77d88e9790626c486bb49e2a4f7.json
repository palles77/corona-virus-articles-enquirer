            "text": "Geographical variations in cardiovascular disease rates have been linked to individual air pollutants. Investigating the relation between cardiovascular disease and exposure to a complex mixture of air pollutants requires holistic approaches. We assessed the relationship between exposure to multiple air pollutants and the incidence of coronary heart disease (CHD) in a general population sample. We collected data in the Lille MONICA registry (2008-2011) on 3268 incident cases (age range: 35-74). Based on 20 indicators, we derived a composite environmental score (SEnv) for cumulative exposure to air pollution. Poisson regression models were used to analyse associations between CHD rates on one hand and SEnv and each single indicator on the other (considered in tertiles, where T3 is the most contaminated). We adjusted models for age, sex, area-level social deprivation, and neighbourhood spatial structure. The incidence of CHD was a spatially heterogeneous (p=0.006). There was a significant positive association between SEnv and CHD incidence (trend p=0.0151). The relative risks [95%CI] of CHD were 1.08 [0.98-1.18] and 1.16 [1.04-1.29] for the 2nd and 3rd tertile of SEnv exposure. In the single pollutant analysis, PM 10 , NO 2 , cadmium, copper, nickel, and palladium were significantly associated with CHD rates. Multiple air pollution was associated with an increased risk of CHD. Single pollutants reflecting road traffic pollution were the most strongly associated with CHD. Our present results are consistent with the literature data on the impact of road traffic on the CHD risk in urban areas.",

Hence, environmental pollution must be considered holistically and in the long term. To date, very few studies have assessed the spatialized, cumulative exposure to multiple pollutants (Bennett et al., 2014; Scarborough et al., 2012) . In contrast, exposure to conventionally individual air pollutants has been intensively studiedusually by modelling annual mean concentrations of sulphur dioxide (SO 2 ), nitrogen oxides (NOx), particulate matter (PM 10 and PM 2.5 ), and ozone (O 3 ). Composite index groups together indicators of the various facets of a multiple exposure to air pollutants (European Commission et al., 2008) . In this respect, spatialized composite indices are increasingly acknowledged to be valuable indicators for determining overall air quality (Occelli et al., 2016) . Therefore, the primary objective of the present study was to assess the putative relationship between exposure to multiple environmental pollutants and the incidence of CHD. To this end, we compared the spatial distributions of a composite air pollution index and the CHD rate after adjusting for the level of social deprivation.",

All fatal and non-fatal CHD events whether hospitalised or not, recorded by public-or private-sector hospitals, emergency departments or at home that occurred in the study area were assessed. Multiple overlapping sources of caseascertainment were used to document the CHD events. Medical and administrative sources were cross-checked to ensure the inclusion of all information (discharge letters, computer listings covering the diagnosis on hospital discharge, emergency department listings, death certificates, etc.). Cases of acute coronary events were documented on the basis of the clinical history and the hospital records. The clinical diagnoses were obtained from medical records. For each event, the patient's vital status was recorded. Information on this outcome was obtained directly from the patient's general practitioner, the city's registry office, or the national death certificate database. The causes of death were checked in hospital or autopsy records and by interviewing general practitioners. For the present study, we used data from the 2008-2011 period, which represented 5448 cases.

In the UK, Maheswaran et al. reported on significant elevated CHD mortality risks in the highest quintile of PM 10 and NOx annual concentration exposures (1.17 [1.06-1.29] and 1.08 [0.96-1.20], respectively) (Maheswaran et al., 2005) .

However, the association with NO 2 in women and with PM 10 in men or women was not statistically significant. In California, a significant increment in CHD mortality rates in areas exposed to PM 2.5 was reported, whatever the spatial exposure model used; the RR ranged from 1.20 [1.17-1.23] to 1.28 [1.25-1.32] for each 10 \u03bcg/m 3 increase in concentration (Garcia et al., 2016) .

In a systematic review of environmental metals and CVD, Nigra et al. highlighted the need to understand the role of metals (including exposure to metal mixtures) in the development of cardiovascular disease (Nigra et al., 2016) . In the present study, we found a 17% rise in CHD incidence risk for the T3 of copper, a 14% rise for cadmium, a 13% rise for palladium and an 11% rise for nickel. Mechanistically, the elevated CHD risk might be due to the known adverse effects on intracellular and extracellular structures of an imbalance in the production and detoxification of reactive oxygen species. These consequences include greater lipid peroxidation, cell membrane damage, DNA damage, and oxidation of amino acids in proteins, and therefore change in these components' conformation and function.

While NO 2 is primarily released into the air by the combustion engines of motor vehicles, metals can account for a large proportion of PMs in urban areas because particulate emissions near roads are also due to the wear of brakes, tires, other vehicle components and the road surface, as well as exhaust emissions (Jandacka et al., 2017) . In the present study, these indicators were strongly correlated with SEnv, the highest values of which were observed close to main roads. We hypothesize that SEnv reflects a major influence of road traffic in the Lille urban area, a major agglomeration located at the crossroads of several European freight routes. These large flows of heavy goods vehicles are combined with large numbers of cars, as people commute to work. Thus, road traffic is likely to make the most important contribution to people's exposure in such urbanized area.",

The healthcare supply is dense, and so lack of access is unlikely to have an effect on the incidence of CHD. We used recently develop, validated statistical methods in spatial epidemiology. Our approach to air pollution is novel because we used data from lichen and plant biomonitoring, and a composite pollution index. Environmental biomonitoring might be able to track cumulative exposure over several years, and thus reflect the overall effects of environmental contamination. Consistent with other authors, our findings support the use of environmental biomonitoring as a tool to assess health effects of air pollution (Lequy et al., 2019) .

The environmental score calculated in this study considers cumulative exposure to 20 atmospheric pollutants, including NO 2 , particles, and heavy metals. These data came from different sources, and were provided in various formats and units and on various spatiotemporal scales. However, the methodology used to design our score helps to ensure interoperability. Although standard Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a robust statistical methodology to derive composite index from multivariate data, this leads a risk of overrepresentation of some pollutants compared to others. As we do not know which potential toxic effects each individual pollutant has on CHD, we favored rank normalization and unweighted aggregation for an explorative research. Through the sum of ranks, territories that accumulate high levels of contamination for all pollutants are identified as hot spots. This method guarantees the equal weighting of each variable in the overall score, regardless of the data distribution and variance. Furthermore, this method may not capture the spatial structure of each individual pollutant, and spatial autocorrelation. Geographically weighted PCA or PCA with spatial autocorrelation appears to be useful statistical techniques for these purposes (Dem\u0161ar et al., 2013) , but these consequently involve a weighted aggregation.",

Our results are consistent with an influence of road traffic on the cardiovascular risk in urban areas. Populations living in neighbourhoods close to high-traffic roads are more exposed to multiple air pollutants, and have a greater risk of developing cardiovascular complications. These risks appear to be related to metal pollutants as well as to more commonly studied pollutants like NO 2 , PM 10 and PM 2.5 .",
