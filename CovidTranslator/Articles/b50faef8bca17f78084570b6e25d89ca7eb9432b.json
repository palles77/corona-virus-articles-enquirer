About 30e50% of acute LRTIs are viral in origin; of these, influenza and respiratory syncytial virus are associated with the greatest disease burden in humans. Many different influenza A viruses occur naturally in animal reservoirs, and present a constant threat of zoonotic infections and global pandemics. The pandemic (H1N1) influenza virus that emerged in humans in 2009 contained a unique combination of genes originating in swine and the global human population was highly susceptible to the novel strain. The emergence of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus in 2003, and the ensuing worldwide epidemic, highlights the fact that respiratory viral infections in humans may originate in animals. Preventative measures for influenza include annual vaccination and treatment with antiviral drugs such as the neuraminidase inhibitors oseltamivir and zanamivir. Subtype-dependent resistance to antivirals can develop and should be closely monitored.",

It was previously thought that, for a novel subtype of influenza to arise in humans, reassortment of two virus subtypes had to occur in a mammal that could then transmit to humans. The pig was considered a suitable 'intermediate host', because both avian and human viruses, which differ slightly in their surface receptor requirements, can replicate in pigs. However, following transmission of H5N1 directly from birds to humans on 18 occasions in Hong Kong in 1997, and further zoonotic infections involving several different subtypes of influenza (Table 2) , it is evident that cross-species barriers to transmission may be less stringent than was thought. Nevertheless, the requirements for adaptation of avian viruses to mammals are poorly understood. Cross-species transmission of novel subtypes into susceptible human populations (antigenic shift) are thought to be the source of pandemics of influenza.",

Early clinical data suggest that this preparation of passive antibodies may have wider application, with fewer limitations than RSVIg; however, it is extremely expensive. Few antiviral drugs are available for RSV. Ribavirin is a guanosine analogue that has been used widely, though its precise mode of action is uncertain and many clinical studies show conflicting results.

In 2003, detection of clusters of clinical cases of an unusually severe respiratory illness in South East Asia led to the description of a new syndrome and detection of a new coronavirus e SARS CoV.8 SARS CoV emerged in humans as a result of zoonotic infection. Civet cats and racoon dogs can be infected with the virus and are likely to have been the source of virus in the 2003 outbreaks. Bats have been identified as the host reservoir of many genetically diverse coronaviruses, including some that are related to SARS CoV, which is a strong indication that bats might be the natural reservoir of SARS CoV.Transmission SARS CoV spread worldwide within weeks in early 2003. The major route of transmission was respiratory, primarily through droplet, secretions and aerosol formation. About 60% of cases resulted from infection in healthcare settings, emphasizing the importance of close contact and exposure to bodily secretions. (The syndrome was noticed through unusual clusters of severe respiratory illness in hospital settings.)",
