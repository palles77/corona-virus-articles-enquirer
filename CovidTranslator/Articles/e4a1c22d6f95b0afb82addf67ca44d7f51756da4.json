As a potential vaccine and therapeutic target, the nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV-2 (nCoVN) functions in packaging the viral genome and viral self-assembly. To investigate the biological effect of nCoVN to human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC), genetically engineered iPSC overexpressing nCoVN (iPSC-nCoVN) were generated by lentiviral expression systems. Unexpectedly, the morphology and proliferation rate of iPSC were changed after nCoVN expressing for two weeks. The pluripotency markers SSEA4 and TRA-1-81 were not detectable in iPSC-nCoVN. Meanwhile, iPSC-nCoVN lost the ability for differentiation into cardiomyocytes when using a routine differentiation protocol. Our data suggested that nCoVN disrupted the pluripotent properties of iPSC and turned them into fibroblasts, which provided a new insight to the pathogenic mechanism of SARS-CoV-2.",

According to the continuously updated data from World Health Organization, to date, more than 300,000 infected cases were confirmed, while more than 13,000 individuals died because of COVID-19 (https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novelcoronavirus-2019). Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which was proved to be the pathogen of COVID-19, has 79% identity in genomes with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [1] . 12 coding regions were predicted in SARS-CoV-2, including spike protein, nucleocapsid protein, envelope protein, and membrane protein [1] [2] [3] . The Cryo-EM structure of spike protein had been determined [4] , and more and more evidences showed that the spike protein binds human ACE2 to entry into host cells [4, 5] , which indicated that SARS-CoV-2 might share similar pathogenic mechanisms with SARS-CoV.

Unlike the spike protein with a certain mutation frequency, the sequence of nucleocapsid protein was more stable [7] , which meant it was an ideal target for diagnostic tools [8] [9] [10] and antiviral therapy [11, 12] . The pathogenic effects in host cells caused by the nucleocapsid protein were also studied. It was reported that the nucleocapsid protein inhibited type I interferon production after virion infected the host cells [13] , which was considered as a possible mechanism of immune escape. The nucleocapsid protein inhibited cell cytokinesis and proliferation [14] , and regulated several pathways, such as transforming growth factor-beta signaling [15] , AP-1 signal transduction pathway [16] , and NF-KappaB pathway [17] .",

Unexpectedly, the morphology of iPSC altered obviously when nCoVN had been expressed for 14 days. We turned to investigate whether nCoVN obstructed the pluripotency maintenance in iPSC.

The expression values of a housekeeping gene GAPDH were simultaneously collected as controls. ACE2 was expressed in each kind of stem cells, though the expression values were relatively low compared with GAPDH. The reverse transcription-PCR (RT-RCR) results showed that ACE2 was expressed in iPSC, iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CM) and human coronary artery endothelial cells (HCAEC), suggesting these cells were the potential targets of SARS-CoV-2 ( Figure 1B) .",

The pluripotency maintenance in stem cells requires delicate regulations to maintain the balance of pluripotency gene expression in a complicated network. Since nCovN is able to bind RNAs, it is possible that nCovN suppresses the key pluripotency gene's translation through occupying the particular sites of RNAs. Although the mechanism is unknown, the toxic effects of nCovN are clear, which reminds us that SARS-CoV-2 could impair the reproductive system and hematopoietic system.

STEMUP Medium was changed every two days. IPSC were passaged every three to four days or when the cell culture was 80-90% confluent. During passages, iPSC were rinsed with 1\u00d7 DPBS (Gibco, 14040133) for one time then were treated with 0.5mM EDTA (Invitrogen, 15575020) in 1\u00d7 DPBS (Gibco, 14190144) for 10 mins at room temperature. The split ratio was 1:3-1:6. The detailed differentiation protocol was described in the previous published reports[31,32]. Briefly, iPSC were treated with small molecule CHIR99021 (Tocris, 4423, final concentration 10 \u03bcM) in the RPMI-BSA medium [RPMI 1640 Medium (HyClone, SH30027.01) supplemented with 213 \u03bcg/ml AA2P (l-ascorbic acid 2-phosphate magnesium) (Sigma, A8960) and 0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) (Sigma, A1470)] for 24 hours, then were incubated with RPMI-BSA medium for 48 hours. On differentiation day 4, cells were treated with the small molecule IWP2 (Tocris, 3533, final concentration 5 \u03bcM) in RPMI-BSA medium. After 48 hours, medium was changed to RPMI-BSA medium. Then, RPMI 1640 Medium supplemented with 3% KnockOut Serum Replacement (Gibco, 10828-028) was used to culture the cardiomyocytes in the following experiments. For nCoVN expression induction, doxycycline hyclate (Sigma, D9891) was supplemented in the cardiomyocyte culture medium at a final concentration of 2 \u03bcg/mL.",
