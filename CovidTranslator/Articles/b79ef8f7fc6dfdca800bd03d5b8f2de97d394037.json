WT(vehicle) (n=4 mice), WT (RTX) (n=4 mice) and Tcrd -/-(RTX) (n=5 mice). (b) IL-17A and IL-6 levels in the BALF 6h post-infection with lethal S. aureus. IL-17A: WT(vehicle) (n=6 mice), WT (RTX) (n=9 mice) and Tcrd -/-(RTX) (n=5 mice). IL-6: WT(vehicle) (n=4 mice), WT (RTX) (n=5 mice) and Tcrd -/-(RTX) (n=5 mice). (c) Percentage of neutrophils (Ly6G + CD11b + cells) in lung homogenates 12h following lethal S. aureus lung infection in RTX-treated or vehicle-treated Tcrd -/mice. n=4 mice per group. Statistical analysis by one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post-tests. Error bars indicate mean\u00b1 s.e.m. Depletion of alveolar macrophages does not impact other lung-resident immune cell populations. FACS analyses to determine the number of (a) alveolar macrophages, (b) interstitial macrophages, (c) CD11b + Dendritic Cells, (d) CD103 + Dendritic Cells, (e) Ly6G + CD11b + neutrophils, and (f) Ly6C hi CD11b + monocytes after intratracheal clodronate-laden liposome (CLL) administration or PBS liposome (PBS-L) in vehicle-treated and RTX-treated mice infected with a lethal dose of S. aureus (12h). n=3 mice/group. Data shown in a-f are representative results from two independent experiments with similar results. Statistical analysis throughout figure by two-tailed unpaired t-test. Error bars indicate mean\u00b1 s.e.m.",

Bacteria induce CGRP release from cultured nociceptor neurons that is dependent on the agr virulence determinant. Primary nociceptor neurons from DRG were cultured and infected with WT S. aureus or \u2206agr isogenic mutant S. aureus at indicated doses above for 30 min, and the levels of CGRP in the supernatant were determined by CGRP EIA assay (Cayman Chemicals). 500nM capsaicin stimulation was used as a positive control.

Mice were pretreated with either vehicle control or RTX 4 weeks prior to GFP-S. aureus (green) pneumonia. Animals received 1x10 8 CFU into the lung and intravital imaging was performed at 4 hours post-infection. Neutrophils were visualized using fluorescently conjugated anti-Ly6G antibodies (red) and the endothelium was visualized using fluorescently conjugated anti-CD31 antibodies given intravenously prior to imaging. Representative video recordings of experiments from vehicle control and RTX-treated mice are shown side by side for comparison and then individually. Imaging experiments were repeated 3 separate times for vehicle control and 4 times for RTX.",
