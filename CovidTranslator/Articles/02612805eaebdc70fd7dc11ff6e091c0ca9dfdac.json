Methods: A retrospective cohort study was performed using the Taiwan National Health Insurance research database. A total of 1141 ACO patients aged \u226565 years during 2005-2011 were observed and followed for 2 years. The Bice and Boxerman COC index (COCI) was used to evaluate COC by considering ambulatory care visits duo to COPD or asthma in the first year; ED visits and hospitalization for COPD or asthma were identified in the subsequent year, respectively. The COCI was divided into three levels (COCI < 0.3= low, 0.3 \u2264 COCI<1=medium, COCI = 1=high). The Cox model was used to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) for ED visits and hospital admissions due to COPD or asthma. Results: The average COCI was 0.55. 21.3% patients received outpatient care from a single physician. Compared to patients with high COC, those with low and medium COC had a higher risk of ED visits (aHR = 2.80 and 2.69, P < .01) and admissions (aHR = 1.80 and 1.72, P < .05). Conclusion: Increasing COC is beneficial for elderly patients with ACO in disease management. Policymakers could create effective pay-for-performance programs for the elderly ACO population to enhance COC and improve care outcomes.",

Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) and Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) recognized ACO to notice clinicians, researchers and regulators being aware of these patients because of complex conditions [2] . Studies of ACO reported the prevalence ranges from 0.9% to 11.1% among general population around the world [3] . The disease burden and healthcare utilization such as emergency department (ED) visits and hospital admissions for patients with ACO has been found to be higher than those with asthma or COPD alone [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] . While the importance of caring for patients with ACO has become a critical issue, there is limited information regarding treatment in ACO patients to reduce the resulting healthcare utilization. Additionally, there was a greater increase in the proportion of patients with ACO with increasing age [7, 8, 10] . Hence, an investigation of elderly patients with ACO is necessary because our society is aging.",

Therefore, the Agency of Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) [12] and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) [13] have identified admissions for COPD or asthma in older adults as a prevention quality indicator (PQI), which may be avoided under more effective treatment in outpatient care. In regard with disease management especially for chronic diseases, continuity of care (COC), is a crucial element of primary care [14] to improve clinical outcomes by consistent and seamless treatment between patients and physicians over time [15] . Previous studies revealed COC is associated with healthcare outcomes in elderly patients with asthma or COPD, respecitively [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] . These studies supported higher COC is associated with fewer ED visits [16] [17] [18] and hospitalizations [16, [18-23] , and lower healthcare cost [16, 18] . However, the potential impact of COC and the therapeutic relationship between physician and patient, in which https://doi.org/10.1016/j.healthpol.2018. 11 .005 0168-8510/\u00a9 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The NHI program provides universal and compulsory health insurance to strengthen accessibility of health care services and to reduce patients' financial barriers. Under the NHI program, patients can freely visit any health care provider at any level without referral [25] . Due to features of this healthcare system, patients with ACO may seek out one or more physicians to care for their health, which leads increase outpatient care visits. However, there is no evidence reporting the relationship between COC and healthcare outcomes for these elderly patients. Therefore, exploration of the COC and its effects on healthcare outcomes among elderly ACO patients may offer new contributions to extend current literature regarding healthcare outcomes.

All selected beneficiaries were retrospected to 1996 and followed to 2013. The claim data contain comprehensive personal and healthcare care records, such as cryptographic identification for each patient and physician, patient's gender, date of birth, and International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) codes for primary and secondary diseases. There were no significant differences in the distributions of age or gender between patients in the LHID2010 and the nationwide databases [26] . Therefore, the LHID2010 database is representative of the entire population. The years between 2004 and 2013 were selected in this study because of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak in Taiwan from March 14 to May 22 in 2003 [27] . The institutional review board at National Yang-Ming University of Taiwan approved this study (IRB Approval Number: YM103047E).",

The index date was set as the earliest date for patients who had a record during this period. Patients who were not continuously enrolled in the NHI program (n = 954) until the end of study period were excluded. To identify ACO patients, patients without \u22652 outpatient visit claims or 1 inpatient admission for asthma (ICD-9-CM code 493.xx) in a prior year of index date [29, 30] were excluded (n = 13,409). In order to calculate a stable COC value that requires \u22653 outpatient visits; therefore, patients had <3 outpatient visits during the COC period were excluded (n = 222). In total, 1141 patients were included (Fig. 1 ). To avoid time-dependent bias and incorrect conclusions [31] , we followed each patient for 2 years after the index date.

The average monthly minimum wage in Taiwan was around 20,000 N T dollars in this study period ($US667, one US dollar was equal to 30 New Taiwan dollars in 2012) [36] . Therefore, we used US$667 and doubled this amount (US$1333) to categorize three levels of insurance premiums [37] . Due to the relationship between socioeconomic status (SES) and health care outcomes [38, 39] , insurance premiums were used as a proxy for SES because the NHI claims data set does not provide patients' educational levels or household incomes. In addition, health status and disease severity may affect the measurement of health outcomes [6, 9, 16, 39] ; therefore, any history of hypertension (ICD-9-CM codes 401.xx-405.xx), and diabetes (ICD-9-CM codes 250.xx) [4, 6, 9] , whether a patient had ED visits for COPD or asthma and whether a patient was hospitalized for COPD or asthma were included in the previous year of the index date.

Furthermore, with the valid proportional hazard assumption for ED visit and hospital admission [42] , Cox regression models were used to examine the association between COC levels and the risk of ED visits and hospital admission for COPD or asthma in elderly patients with ACO. In the adjusted model, we calculated the adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) after adjusting for sex, age, insurance premium, history of hypertension and diabetes, ED visits for COPD or asthma, hospital admissions for COPD or asthma, CCI and number of ambulatory visits for COPD or asthma. All variables had no multicollinearity in our model. All statistical analyses and data management were conducted using SAS software version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).

The findings of this study revealed that 21.3% of older patients with ACO had the highest score of COCI (COCI = 1) during the first observational year, and the average COCI was 0.55 among the study population. Previous studies reported that the mean of COCI in elderly patients with COPD ranged 0.49-0.71 [16, 18, 21, 23] and in elderly asthmatic patients the mean ranged from 0.66 to 0.73 [16, 17, 22] . On the other hand, studies revealed the mean of COCI was around 0.3 among senior population when COC was estimated by considering for any condition [35, 43, 44] . A high COC score for the elderly patients with ACO might be attributable to the asthma pay-forperformance (P4P) program. The Taiwan government launched the asthma P4P program in 2001 to encourage clinics and hospitals to provide patient-centered care and focus on disease management. This program proposed a guideline-based practice with financial incentives. Except for the regular reimbursement for health care services, physicians (internist, pediatrician, family physician, and otorhinolaryngologist) who acquire asthma care training at least eight hours can receive additional compensates including case management fees and enlarged physician fees if their patients have a high follow-up rate and a low rate of hospitalization and ED visits for asthma. Previous studies focusing on asthma care found that the asthma P4P program in Taiwan might ameliorate COC score for elderly patients [17] and children [45] . Additionally, the benefit of P4P programs in improving COC as well as health outcomes was found among patients with diabetes [46] .",

Unlike most citizens who seek care first through a primary care physician in the United States, patients in Taiwan enjoy easy access physicians either in a community clinic or in a hospital outpatient care without a referral when they seek care [25] . In this free access policy, these patients directly selected their principal outpatient care providers by themselves.

These findings might indicate that COC is important for older patients with ACO. They would receive timely and efficient care because their healthcare providers has obtained and become familiar with the details of their disease condition. Therefore, we suggest that these patients with low COC should attempt to increase COC in order to reduce the risk of either ED visits or hospital admissions for COPD or asthma because patients have a higher COC, which represents better interpersonal relationships between patients and their physicians and better care outcomes. This robust partnership between patient and physician can be favorable for both patients and the health care system.",

ACO, which does not describe a single disease entity, likely includes patients with several different forms of airways phenotypes caused by a range of different mechanisms. However, there is limited evidence to investigate in regard of treating ACO [2] . This study used comprehensive data from a health care system with free access policy to provide the evidence that better COC is related to lower risk of ED visits and hospitalization for COPD or asthma among elderly ACO patients. Therefore, we suggest that policymakers could consider designing a program that focused on ACO to improve COC and disease-controlling ability.",

Therefore, we used ICD-9-CM codes to define ACO as done in previous studies [4, 6, 29] . Second, the claims data lacks personal anthropometric measurements such as body mass index [39, 40] and smoking status [39, 51, 52] that may affect healthcare outcomes. Therefore, we adopted ED visits and admissions for COPD or asthma as well as the frequency of ambulatory visits for COPD or asthma in the COC period as proxies for disease severity [9, 52] ; also, we used patients' history of hypertension and diabetes and CCI as proxy indicators to present each patient's health status [5, 40] . Third, we used insurance premiums as an indicator to represent patients' socioeconomic status because the database could not provide patients' educational level or household income, which may affect the measurement of COC and outcomes [8] . Forth, we excluded patients who had less than three outpatient visits during the COC period, which might limit the generalizability for elderly patients with ACO. Finally, claim-based COC measurements could offer only limited aspects of information regarding COC [33, 53] and fails to incorporate the view of COC from patient-centered point of view [54, 55] because measures are based on the patterns of patient encounters during a time period.",

First, this retrospective cohort study presents stronger evidence of the association between COC and healthcare outcomes than a cross-sectional study. Second, the dataset are highly representative of the entire population because 99% of Taiwanese residents enroll in the NHI program which may reduce selection bias. Third, using the nationwide electronic health records (EHR) databases can reduce the effect of recall bias and make our results more informative. Fourth, this study focuses on ACO instead of either COPD or asthma, and provides empirical evidence of an adverse association between COC and the risk of ED visit and hospital admission. Fifth, this study adopted COCI which is the most commonly used index to measure the degree of coordination required between different providers during a clinical episode. Finally, the COCI was measured by continuity relationship between patients and physician, which may provide information that is superior to that obtained from measurements between patients and institutions.",
