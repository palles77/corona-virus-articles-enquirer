            "text": "In felids, feline leukemia virus (FeLV) infection results in a variety of outcomes that range from abortive (virus readily eliminated and never detectable) to progressive infection (persistent viremia and viral shedding). Recently, a novel outcome was postulated for low FeLV infectious doses. Na\u00efve cats exposed to faeces of persistently infected cats seroconverted, indicating infection, but remained negative for provirus and p27 antigen in blood. FeLV provirus was found in some tissues but not in the bone marrow, infection of which is usually considered a necessary stage for disease progression. To investigate the impact of low FeLV doses on young cats and to test the hypothesis that low dose exposure may lead to an unknown pathogenesis of infection without involvement of the bone marrow, 21 cats were infected oronasally with variable viral doses. Blood p27, proviral and viral loads were followed until week 20 post-infection. Tissue proviral loads were determined as well. The immune response was monitored by measuring FeLV whole virus and p45 antibodies; and feline oncornavirus-associated cell membrane antigen (FOCMA) assay. One cat showed regressive infection (transient antigenemia, persistent provirus-positivity, and seroconversion) with provirus only found in some organs at sacrifice. In 7 of the 20 remaining cats FOCMA assay positivity was the only sign of infection, while all other tests were negative. Overall, the results show that FeLV low dose exposure can result in seroconversion during a presumed abortive infection. Therefore, commonly used detection methods do not detect all FeLV-infected animals, possibly leading to an underestimation of the prevalence of infection.",

            "text": "Feline leukemia virus (FeLV) is a retrovirus of great veterinary importance that was discovered more than 40 years ago [20] and infects domestic cats and some related small felids worldwide [18, 22, 32] . An infection with FeLV may cause disorders of hematopoietic cells, a state of immunodeficiency and fatal neoplasia. Common symptoms are fever, anaemia, anorexia and weight loss. The prevalence of FeLV infection has been decreasing in the past few years. In Switzerland, FeLV prevalence was found to be 3% in healthy and of up to 13% in ill cats [29] . Decreasing prevalence is the consequence of identification and segregation of infected cats, and of extensive vaccination programs. However, cases of recurrence keep occurring and emphasise the importance of an accurate diagnosis [24] . FeLV is mainly transmitted directly from cat to cat. Transmission occurs through contact with saliva via licking, mutual grooming and sharing of food or water dishes or trough bites [5, 6] . Infectious FeLV can also be transmitted via faeces and milk [8, 34] . FeLV RNA was also detected in urine, but, its infection potential has not been demonstrated so far [1] . Pathogenesis is well understood if infectious pressure is high. Infection starts in the oropharynx where the virus first replicates in tonsils and local lymph nodes [37] , from which the virus spreads to the bone marrow, thymus, spleen and intestine through infected lymphocytes. Bone marrow infection is an important hallmark of FeLV pathogenesis as the virus replicates extensively in bone marrow and infects blood precursor cells first, and many organs and tissues thereafter, including salivary gland, tonsils, pharyngeal, urinary bladder, gastric, intestinal, colonic, pancreatic and endometrial epithelia, lymph nodes throughout the body, bone marrow, and spleen [36, 37] . FeLV infection presents a variety of outcomes [11, 16-18, 25, 27, 35, 37, 38] , which are influenced by both host and virus factors. Known host resistance factors include age and immune system status. Known virologic factors are virus strain, subtype and viral infection dose [18] . The outcome of infection is still a rather controversial issue. In the past, infection outcome was classified as viremic, non-viremic, and transiently viremic based on results of virus isolation, immunofluorescence assays and/or antigen detection [27] . Viremic cats are characterized by continuous expression of p27 viral antigen. FeLV infection is not contained due to a lack of FeLV specific immunity [3, 4, 18] . Viremic cats continuously shed virus, thereby posing a risk of infection to susceptible cats, and usually succumb to FeLV-associated diseases (anaemia, immunosuppression, and neoplasia). In transiently viremic cats, viremia is overcome after a few weeks post-infection (p.i.). However, transiently viremic cats remain provirus positive [15] . In addition, some nonviremic cats were shown to have localized infection characterized by virus replication in certain tissues, such as mammary, salivary and urinary epithelium [8, 12, 34] . This additional form of FeLV infection was termed atypical or sequestered infection. New sensitive molecular assays have been described recently for the use in detection and quantification of FeLV provirus DNA and viral RNA [14, 39, 42] , resulting in a more sensitive measure for FeLV exposure. The spectrum of host response categories was refined accordingly. Especially in p27 negative cats, the outcome should be reevaluated based on the presence or absence of FeLV proviral DNA in blood or bone marrow. The spectrum of host response categories was thus reclassified into: abortive (no virus detected after exposure), regressive (p27-negative, provirus positive after or without transient antigenemia) and progressive (persistently p27 positive, virus isolation, provirus positive, FeLV RNA positive) [16] . Whether cats that show no signs of infection (abortive) are truly immune or just resistant, is still open to debate. In this context, a very interesting finding was that FeLV infection can be transmitted by contact with faeces [8] with no apparent viremia and infection involving the bone marrow, and constant negativity for proviral DNA in blood -which would be classified as abortive infection. However, in the study of Gomes-Keller et al. [8] FeLV provirus could be detected in several organs and the cats showed seroconversion, indicating that infection indeed had occurred. It was concluded that under low infectious pressure a different pathogenesis may take place in which bone marrow is not involved. Since FeLV transmission at very low infection levels appears to be the most natural way of infection, many cats may show this yet uncharacterized outcome. Cats that test negative for FeLV by conventional diagnostic methods could still have been infected and constitute a relevant portion of the cat population affected by the virus. The prevalence of FeLV infection may therefore have been underestimated, a factor that can have important consequences for FeLV control management, e.g. in Iberian lynxes, which seem to be particularly susceptible for FeLV infection and for which a correct estimation of FeLV spreading potential is of great importance [32] . It was thus the aim of this study to further characterize the course of infection after exposure to low infectious pressure and to test the hypothesis that low FeLV doses applied to young cats may lead to seroconversion even when the infection does not progress through bone marrow. The virus may not be completely eliminated and a limited viral replication in tissues may lead to a development of a weak immune response. Three groups of 7 cats were exposed to different, low doses of FeLV. Blood p27 antigen, proviral DNA and viral RNA were measured in blood at regular intervals until week 20 p.i. and in popliteal and mesenteric lymph nodes, bone marrow, spleen, kidney, urinary bladder, lungs, thymus, myocardium, parotid gland, and pancreas after euthanasia. Immune response against FeLV was assessed by the detection of antibodies by ELISA to FeLV whole virus and to FeLV p45 (the recombinant env-gene product), by immunofluorescence assay to feline oncornavirus-associated cell membrane antigen (FOCMA), and by Western blot analysis to the separated FeLV components.",

Tissue samples were co-cultured with FEA cells and supernatants of the co-cultures collected at days 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24 , and 28 post-inoculation were tested for p27 antigen by ELISA as described [7] . Bone marrow samples were cultured in medium and supernatants collected at days 18 and 21 were used for total nucleic acid isolation (MagNA Pure LC Total Nucleic Acid Isolation Kit, Roche Diagnostics) and samples were tested for the presence of FeLV RNA. Additionally, supernatants were tested by p27 ELISA [26] .",

In this alternative course, cats exposed to low loads of virus via faecal route seroconverted without involvement of bone marrow and without showing any other sign of infection [8] . [16] . In this study, we demonstrated that a single oronasal exposure to FeLV as low as 10 000 FFU is sufficient to elicit an antibody response and to lead to seroconversion in at least 18% (lower 95% confidence interval of the distribution) of the cats, demonstrating that the postulated alternative course of infection may occur in a considerable portion of the animals. We propose to designate this outcome of infection as abortive infection with seroconversion. No hallmark of infection was observed in the cats that received the smallest of the three doses (1 000 FFU), for which individual local innate immunity might have been enough to contain viral replication and to lead to abortive infection without a detectable adaptive immune response. However, under field conditions, multiple exposures in the range of 1 000 FFU or lower may occur giving rise to seroconversion or even provirus positivity.",

FeLV provirus may still be integrated into the genome of the cells of some tissues but, in most cases, at levels beyond detection. In the study presented here, FeLV DNA sequences were not detectable in the organs tested. However, the presence of FeLV provirus in tissues other than the ones we analysed can not be excluded and should be investigated further. In localized infection where FeLV replication is confined to certain tissues, presence of plasma viral RNA loads is regarded a sensitive parameter for infection. RNA loads reflect ongoing viral replication somewhere in the cat's body even in sequestered places. However, detection of RNA is generally less frequent than that of proviral DNA [39] . Seroconversion was observed by use of the FL-74 cell membrane immunofluorescence test. This assay originally had been designated FO-CMA test and was thought to detect antibodies at a non-virion tumour-associated antigen [2] . Later, it became clear that the FOCMA phenomenon can be explained not by a tumour specific antigen but by viral proteins including FeLV p15(E), gag-polyproteins and gp70 of FeLV subtype C present on the FL-74 cell membrane [43] .",

This may be due in part to the less stringent test conditions, which allow antibodies with lower affinity to bind to their epitopes, and in part to the fact that in the FOCMA assay the binding targets are presented in a native conformation, thus allowing a better binding of conformation-specific antibodies. Induction of cytotoxic T-cells or virus-neutralizing antibodies by oral low dose infection, or Th1 cytokine expression that might have been induced by the experimental infection were not measured. Instead, antibody response was used as marker of infection. It is unclear to what degree the alternative pathway may be relevant to the spread of FeLV infection. We speculate that in most cases cats will overcome the infection for good. In very few cases -when the infected cats undergo immunosuppression due e.g. to concomitant FIV infection -full-blown FeLV infection with bone marrow involvement and viral shedding may develop. It will be important to determine to what extent this may occur.",
