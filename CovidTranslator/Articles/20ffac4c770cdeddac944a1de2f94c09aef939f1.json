Here, we simulate epidemic spread through various contact networks and fit spatial-based models in a Bayesian framework using Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. These spatial models are individual-level models which account for the spatio-temporal dynamics of infectious disease. The focus here is on choosing a spatial model which best predicts the true probabilities of infection, as well as determining under which conditions such spatial models fail. Spatial models tend to predict infection probability reasonably well when disease spread is propagated through contact networks in which contacts are only within a certain distance of each other. If contacts exist over long distances, the spatial models tend to perform worse when compared to the network model. Crown",

Collection of such data is expensive and there are issues regarding recall and privacy encroachment. A connection, or a contact between two individuals, is usually deemed to be any contact between individuals by which the disease can spread from an infected individual to a susceptible individual. The connections themselves can be hard to describe, as researchers must quantify the type of relationship or contact needed for infection to transfer (Keeling and Eames, 2005) . The networks may be social in nature, spatial proximity based, or demographic (Kolaczyk et al., 2009) . For example, a network may be defined by sexual activity between two individuals in the case of a sexually transmitted disease. Alternatively, if trying to model the spread of the Norwalk virus in people, we might use knowledge about which individuals live together in the same house, attend the same schools, or work together, etc. If modeling a livestock disease at the level of individual farms, say, we may want data on the trade networks, supply networks, and even social networks of farmers and farm workers.",

For example, we may use a spatial network, rather than a more desirable trade network. Examples of such spatial simplification can be found in a number of models of the UK 2001 foot-andmouth disease epidemic (Chis Ster and Ferguson, 2007; Chis Ster et al., 2009; Deardon et al., 2010; Keeling et al., 2001) . Plant epidemiologists often make such simplifications as their subjects are generally stationary thus allowing infective pressures to decrease exponentially with distance (exponential decay), with a power of distance (geometric decay) or with a nearest neighbor effect (Beutels et al., 2009; Filipe and Maule, 2004) . A piecewise function, similar in concept to the nearest neighbor effect only with a given probability of infection from a long distance source, has also been used in modeling wildlife infectious diseases in which a physical barrier (such as a river) reduces mixing within the population . The simplest assumption to make for any infectious disease model is to assume homogeneous mixing within the population thereby, with no other covariate information, assuming equal infective pressure on all individuals within the population. Bansal et al., 2007 provides insight into the ability of homogeneous-mixing compartmental model's ability to predict the characteristics of network-based epidemics.",

The posterior predictive distribution of the epidemic timeline for e out \u00bc 0:0 is severely inconsistent with the true epidemic occurring earlier than predicted, this can be seen in Fig. 4 .",

            "text": "The purpose of this paper, as stated in Section 1, was to examine the effects of using a spatial kernel based ILM to model disease spread actually propagated through a con-tact network. This was carried out by simulating epidemics propagated through two types of random networks. The first type specified the probability of an edge existing between two individuals as depending on the distance between two individuals being greater, or less than, some constant. Spatial distance within the second study was also used to determine the probability of an edge between two individuals, but was based on a continuously spatiallydecaying probability. The second study added complexity through the inclusion of super-spreaders. Various ILMs were then fit to the resulting data. Model fit at the individual level was assessed by considering the one-step ahead predictive probability of infection based on the posterior mean values of the parameters for the fitted models with that of the true model. At the population-level model fit was assessed my analyzing the posterior predictive distribution of the epidemic timeline through a mean predicted squared error calculation.",

            "text": "We have seen that in situations where there are only contacts between individuals within a relatively short distance of each other (i.e. e out \u00bc 0 in study one) or are less likely to have contacts over long distances (D \u00bc 1:1 in study two), there is relatively little difference between the performance of each of the spatial models as they all tend to fit reasonably well, in terms of predicting infection probability. However, when contacts occur over longer distances, the spatial models tend to perform poorly. If the probability of a long-distance contact is relatively high (i.e. e out \u00bc 0:2 in study one, or n and/or SS are high in study two), it seems that each of the spatial models performed roughly as poorly as each other, with perhaps a slight preference for the constant piecewise model. Model fit results were not surprising given the mechanics of the simulation. Essentially in the first study, a piecewise function was used for the contact network generation and as such the constant piecewise model would be expected to approximate this aspect well. In the case of the second study, the homogeneous mixing model showed improved results when the super-spreader information overpowered the underlying spatial decay. The super-spreader aspect of the contact network is random and therefore would be best approximated by the homogeneous mixing model. The homogeneous mixing model is a special case of the constant piecewise model. When the radius parameter (s) of the piecewise kernel is outside the bounds of the possible infection distances observed (i.e. s ! 0 or s ! 1). Preliminary model fit of the constant piecewise model utilized a vague prior of a positive half-normal distributions with a mode of zero and variance of 1000 for s. The resulting MCMC chain would often converge to a homogeneous mixing model case. For the purpose of this simulation study we wanted to force the constant piecewise model to be fitted and thus restrict the radius (s) parameter from extremely low or high values. The use of an informative prior, as described in Section 2.9, applied this restriction. Of course, such MCMC convergence issues are indicative of model uncertainty. In the case of a real data analysis, researchers may want to explore this model uncertainty and could do so using techniques such as reversible jump MCMC to explore the joint parameter and model space (Richardson and Green, 1997) .",

It would be interesting to analyze the results of using the various spatial ILMs for different types of more complex networks. For example, contact structure could be a function of several sub-networks. An example of this might be given by considering influenza for human populations in which different networks describe contacts from living in the same household, attending the same school/workplace, visiting the same general practitioners, and so on.",

We therefore purposefully avoided using a specific application. Of course, when modeling a real life outbreak and specific disease system, the model to be fit will need to be tailored to the data collected, as well as the underlying disease system. We have seen that the performance of the simple spatial disease transmission models can break down easily under various scenarios when the underlying contact structure is more complex. Optimal model fit is achieved when the structure of the model incorporates the characteristics of the disease spread; this includes the contact network. If modeling a wildlife epidemic, steps must be taken to determine how the mixing is occurring. At a spatial level this may mean incorporating aspects describing within herd dynamics, immigration and emigration rates, physical barriers to movement, and peak times of activity. With airborne pathogens spread to plants, models highlighting the spatial decay may indeed be adequate but could be improved upon if windspeed and other weather characteristics were also taken into account. Perhaps the overriding lesson to be drawn from the results shown here is the importance of putting in place a policy of procedures to collect high quality network (and other) data from the system of interest.",
