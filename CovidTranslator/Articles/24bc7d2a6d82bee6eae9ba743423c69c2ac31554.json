Additionally it promotes host cell rupture by cleaving the skeletal proteins of the erythrocyte membrane. Therefore, the inhibition of FP-2 represents a promising target in the search of novel anti-malarial drugs. A potent FP-2 inhibitor, characterized by the presence in its structure of the 1,4-benzodiazepine scaffold and an a,b-unsaturated methyl ester moiety capable to react with the Cys42 thiol group located in the active site of FP-2, has been recently reported in literature. In order to study in depth the inhibition mechanism triggered by this interesting compound, we carried out, through ONIOM hybrid calculations, a computational investigation of the processes occurring when the inhibitor targets the enzyme and eventually leads to an irreversible covalent Michael adduct. Each step of the reaction mechanism has been accurately characterized and a detailed description of each possible intermediate and transition state along the pathway has been reported.",

Among them, vinyl sulfones and aziridines [10] displayed a high potency, measured through the second-order rate constant of inhibition (k 2nd ) that is in the range 10 5 -10 6 M -1 min -1 . Recently, we synthesized a new series of peptidomimetics, based on the 1,4-benzodiazepine (1,4-BDZ) scaffold connected to different warheads, that demonstrated an even better biological activity [11] . Particularly interesting is the vinyl ester 1 that showed high affinity and potency (K i = 0.017 \u00b1 0.004 lM, k 2nd = 3.57 \u00b1 0.40 9 10 6 M -1 min -1 ) and resulted two times more potent than the reference compound carboxyoxiran E-64 (K i = 0.29 \u00b1 0.09 lM, k 2nd = 1.70 \u00b1 0.40 9 10 6 M -1 min -1 ) [7] . Compound 1 derived from several studies conducted modifying the general structure of typical FP-2 inhibitors, such as the vinyl sulfones, E-64, and the peptidyl aziridines inhibitors. Thus, 1 joins together a lipophilic aryl moiety able to increase the interaction with the enzyme P3 site, a central 1,4-BDZ moiety that limits the conformational freedom of the molecule, and a vinyl warhead able to covalently inhibit the enzyme (Scheme 1). Our structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies clarified that compound 1 represents the optimal structure able to block the enzyme [11] [12] [13] . Therefore, 1 has been identified as a new lead compound for the possible development of new antimalarial drugs.",

The other H-bonds were maintained, i.e. that of the carbonyl oxygen with the side chain of Trp206 and that of His174 ? with Asn204. Both the higher stability of EB (DE = -1.2 kcal/mol) and the low energy barrier of 1.5 kcal/mol (TS4) between EA and EB ensured their easy interconversion. Conversely, the energy of E was higher than EA (DE = 1.5 kcal/mol) and the energy barrier was 2.0 kcal/ mol (TS3). It is worthy to note that only EB could be converted into the final adduct K whereas E had to go back to the enolates prior to be converted into its keto-tautomeric form, actually corresponding to the final adduct K.

The relative energy of TS5, very close to that of EB, made this shift straightaway when EB was obtained from EA.

Ligands were built by Sybyl 8.0 [43] and preliminarily minimized by Gaussian09 [34] at the DFT/B3LYP/6-31G(d) level. Docking calculations were then performed with the GOLD 5.0 program [44] into the binding cleft depicted by the presence of E-64. The cavity was detected with an active site radius of 20.0 \u00c5 from the side chain sulfur atom of residue Cys42. The side chain of Trp206 was imposed movable during the docking calculation. The goldscore fitness function and the distribution of torsional angles were chosen to evaluate the quality of the docking results. Van der Waals and hydrogen bonding radii were set at 4.0 and 3.0 \u00c5 , respectively; genetic algorithm parameters were kept at the default value. The complex formed by FP-2 and the highest scored docking solution was submitted to molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with the SANDER module of the AMBER9 package [20] . The ff03 and GAFF force fields were applied for the protein and the ligand, respectively. The complex was immersed in a box containing about 1,000 water molecules and the TIP3P model [45] was employed to explicitly represent the solvent. Na ? counterions were added to maintain neutrality of the system. At first, the energy of the water molecules was minimized, keeping the atoms of the enzyme frozen. Then, a minimization of the whole system was performed by setting a convergence criterion on the gradient of 10 -4 kcal mol -1 \u00c5 -1 . Prior to starting the MD simulations, the system was equilibrated for 40 ps at 300 K in isocore conditions (NVT). Subsequently, 10 ns of MD simulations in isothermal-isobaric ensemble were carried out at 300 K with a 2 fs time-step (NPT). In the production runs, the system was performed in periodic boundary conditions. Van der Waals and shortrange electrostatic interactions were estimated within a 8 \u00c5 cutoff. SHAKE algorithm was applied to all bonds involving hydrogen atoms. When the geometrical stabilization of the complex was reached, a new minimization of the whole system was performed. On this snapshot was applied the subsequent ONIOM calculations.",
