The control programme can be divided into four stages, namely in the early years after the founding of The People's Republic of China from 1949 to 1959, in the later 20th century from 1960s to 1980s, from the late 1980s to the end of the 20th century and the 21st century (Xu et al., 2016a,b) . At each stage, the successful experiences have been summarized into three aspects, namely national policy support and measures, resource mobilization and effect of schistosomiasis control. Such a summary provides the basis for designing an elimination programme against schistosomiasis in The People's Republic of China and be potentially used as a reference for developing schistosomiasis control programmes in other developing countries. CHINA FROM 1949 TO 1959 2.1 Background Before the founding of The People's Republic of China, schistosomiasis was a pandemic disease in southern China (Chen, 2014) , causing great harm to people's life and health. After the founding of The People's Republic of China, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC), headed by Chairman Mao Zedong, considered schistosomiasis a major public health problem and attached great importance to its control (Shi, 2011) . Eliminating schistosomiasis was considered a serious political task at that time. Although the whole country was mobilized to make unremitting efforts to eliminate the disease, the work of schistosomiasis control was exceptionally arduous due to limited economic and technological conditions at that time.",

The leading group was also called the 'nine people group'. Subsequently, leading groups were found at different levels of party committee, including in the provincial party committee, municipal party committee, county party committee and town party committee, which lead the local work of schistosomiasis control (Fig. 1 ). In addition, specific responsibilities and actions at five levels of leadership were clearly stated. Firstly, a regular meeting system was established. Secondly, a regular reporting system, which reflected the true progress and problems of schistosomiasis control was set up the local schistosomiasis control planning was sought to be assessed and reformulated each year. The leading group of the Central Committee of CPC performed its duties fully and consecutive national work conferences on schistosomiasis control were held thrice in Shanghai in a span of 2 years (Shi, 2011) . Directives of the state council for schistosomiasis elimination were issued by Premier Zhou Enlai on 20 April 1957, and the council issued the highest level of government documents on schistosomiasis control (Wang, 2011) . A notice on implementing the directives of schistosomiasis elimination was published by the Central Committee of CPC on 23 April 1957, which expressed the terms that all provincial party committees, municipal party committees of schistosomiasis endemic areas and the party groups of the relevant departments under the state council should ensure the execution of the state council's instructions. From then on, the relevant provincial communist party had to submit a report on schistosomiasis control every 6 months to the Central Committee of CPC.",

The infectious disease management law of The People's Republic of China passed in 1955 was the first health law for the management of infectious diseases issued by the highest authority of the state after the founding of The People's Republic of China. With this law, the prevention and treatment of infectious diseases were brought into the ambit of legal system management for the first time (Zhou, 2004) . Initially, only scientific management system of schistosomiasis control was set up at that time in The People's Republic of China, where schistosomiasis was listed as a 'c' class infectious disease in the law. By setting up a proper legal management system, a comprehensive set of regulations and principles as well as prevention and treatment measures for schistosomiasis were clarified. This included the responsibilities of the citizens, social organizations and relevant government departments (Cao et al., 2016) . In addition, the law reflected science and humanity as more attention was directed at protecting the individual privacy of patients with infectious diseases (Li and Shen, 2006; Yao and Xu, 2005) . Furthermore, the reporting and releasing system of epidemic became more effective as witnessed in the legal infectious disease reporting system carried out in the 1950s in The People's Republic of China. Therefore, the transparency of infectious disease control was strengthened and the citizens' right to know was respected according to the above approach.",

Besides, resources of organizations from different endemic provinces including Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian, Anhui and Shanghai were integrated for the national control of schistosomiasis. In addition, the schistosomiasis control bureau, under the Ministry of Health, was established in Shanghai in July 1957 to strength the leadership of schistosomiasis control. All these activities had led to improved coordination and cooperation between the central schistosomiasis control institutions (Wang, 2011) .",

Various levels of expert advisory committee for schistosomiasis control have also been successively set up during the same period. At a local level, there were people in charge of the schistosomiasis control work in villages. In 1953, stations of disease control and prevention had already been established in provinces, cities (municipalities) and counties (districts) across the whole country. These stations became the professional network for disease control unit of the CPC and the state to implement the strategy and measures of public health (Li, 2013) .

There were 449 epidemic counties (cities, areas), 3563 epidemic towns, resulting in more than 11.6 million patients, 1.20 million cattle infected by schistosome, and an area coverage of 14.3 billion m 2 of snail. The high epidemic areas of schistosomiasis were also located along the Yangtze River and its connected lakes, such as Dongting Lake, Poyang Lake and Tai Lake. The epidemic in other provinces, such as Yunnan, Fujian, Guangxi and Guangdong provinces, were relatively light (Chen and Feng, 1999; Tang, 2012) . According to the epidemiological characteristics and snail-ridden environments, the areas endemic with schistosomiasis were divided into three types in The People's Republic of China, namely marshland, hilly and water network areas (Liu et al., 2016; Shi et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2016) .",

Due to the occurrence of natural disasters and famines in 1960s, a huge negative impact was inflicted on health prevention between 1966 and 1976, causing the work of schistosomiasis control to be severely disrupted. The process of schistosomiasis control was halted, leading to a serious reemergence of schistosomiasis. The leading groups and professional organizations for schistosomiasis control were dissolved at different levels, namely the national, provincial, municipal (city) and county (district) levels (Wang et al., 1989) . After 1970s, the process of schistosomiasis control began to develop steadily, with a national overhaul and recovery. Some epidemic prevention institutions were rebuilt.

The Bureau for Disease Control was renamed to be the Department of Endemic Disease Control in 1989, and the latter was further renamed to be the National Endemic Disease Control office in 1994. After being restructured in 1998, the disease control department guided the work of schistosomiasis control countrywide. Under the leadership of the Ministry of Health, the Schistosomiasis Expert Advisory Committee was established and consisted of experts from the national institutions of schistosomiasis control, medical colleges and different provinces. These experts provided consultation and assisted in decision making. Since the 1980s, the collective ownership economy gradually transformed to the household contract responsibility system in rural The People's Republic of China. Due to changes in the economy system and opening up of markets in The People's Republic of China, the epidemic prevention system was also subjected to modification. It was difficult to organize the mass movement of large-scale snail control, and to assemble the resources of disease control. The idea of 'send away the god of plague' became history (Chen, 2005) and schistosomiasis infections began to rise again in areas where measures of schistosomiasis control failed to be carried out. Meanwhile, it was discovered that the target of schistosomiasis elimination in the marshland and some hilly areas was difficult to achieve with only emphasis on snail control as there were other natural environment and economic factors influencing the progress. The government paid high attention to the schistosomiasis resurgence in The People's Republic of China. Comrade Deng Xiaoping commented: 'It is beneficial for the people to control endemic diseases.' in 1984. Comrade Jiang Zemin said in the letter to the Five Province's Schistosomiasis Control Conference in 1989, 'It is the duty of the governments at all levels of schistosomiasis endemic areas to carry out schistosomiasis control and elimination', which contributed to a new wave of efforts in sending away the god of plague through mobilization of the available resources in the early 1990s.",

The national eighth five-year plan of scientific research of schistosomiasis control has strengthened the scientific research of schistosomiasis control. The national health education implementation planning was made since 1992, where health education was accepted into the overall plan of schistosomiasis control. The purpose of health education was to mobilize the whole society to support schistosomiasis control, and to change the behaviour of target groups who are in close contact with infected water. The State Council issued 'The national ninth five-year plan of comprehensive control of schistosomiasis' in 1997, where the important position and role of science and technology in schistosomiasis control was provided with more attention by the government after 1980s. The government no longer relied on mass movement and participation for schistosomiasis control, but developed the science and technology for it instead.",

The project was implemented from 1992 to 2001 (Collins et al., 2012) . The endemic disease control department of the Ministry of Health and foreign loan office were responsible for the implementation of the project. Within the 10-year period, the total investment for the project amounted to 1.088 billion yuan, including the World Bank loan of RMB 491 million yuan and the Chinese government of different levels matching fund of RMB 597 million yuan (Tables 1e4). The projects covered 219 counties of 8 provinces (Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Anhui, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Yunnan and Sichuan). The total goals of the project were to control the epidemic of schistosomiasis and to interrupt transmission of schistosomiasis in some areas in The People's Republic of China. All project activities were planned till the end of 1998, while three provinces Hunan, Hubei and Yunnan continued till 2001 due to further demands. The project had support from the State Development Planning In addition, 9.64 billion m 2 of area was surveyed for snails, snail elimination with molluscicide was performed on 2.85 billion m 2 , and snail elimination via environmental modification was conducted on 1.05 billion m 2 .

The ecological environment of endemic regions had changed because of the implementation of measures for flood diversion after the flood in 1998. Measures included building of embankments and returning farmland to lake. However, this change of environment has led to the proliferation of oncomelania snaileinfested areas (Yang et a1., 2005) . 2. New epidemic characteristics and regularity of schistosomiasis thus emerged due to the changes of environment. For example, after the completion of the Three Gorges Dam, the extension of the flooding period caused the infectious season to be longer in areas with snails, such as Dongting Lake and Poyang Lake. Global climate change also increased schistosomiasis transmission intensity in some areas (Zhou et al., 2002 (Zhou et al., , 2008 Wu et al., 2007) . 3. The development of animal husbandry led to a more important role of the animal host in schistosomiasis transmission. 4.

Infectious source increased since synchronous chemotherapy of human and livestock could not be carried out. Furthermore the only effective drug, praziquantel, had a potential risk of resistance (Wang and Liang, 2007) because of its wide-range use for a long time in the endemic areas. 6. The increase in social and economic developments brought along a rise in population mobility and livestock trading. Therefore, the frequency of contact with infected water, and reinfection of human and animal increased (Zuo et al., 2003) . 7. Since 2000s, the society and the mass people have paid more attention to the market economy system; however, due to the change of people's ideology and behaviour, schistosomiasis control was ignored to some extent and some measures were hard to carried out at one time (Li et al., 2002; Cai et al., 2003; Yin et al., 2002) . 8. After the WBLP on schistosomiasis control ended in 2001, there was a serious shortage of funding, causing schistosomiasis control in the country to be more passive. 9. The current technology and measures cannot satisfy the needs of the current schistosomiasis control programme, hence it was difficult to effectively control the disease. Thus, at the beginning of the 21st century, there was a significant rebound of schistosomiasis epidemics in The People's Republic of China. As a result, the total number of patients countrywide remains at around 800,000 from 1998 to 2005, and 700,000 of them are from the five marshland provinces. Cattle infection rate was around 4e5%, with an increased spread of snails. The risk of infection with schistosome was rising, with new areas of infected snails estimated to be about 9 million m 2 each year in the marshland areas . The endemic status of schistosomiasis in The People's Republic of China showed that the task of schistosomiasis control was still urgent. The continuous rise in endemic status lasted for 3 years, increasing the risk of human and animal infected by schistosome (Chen et al., 2002 Xiao et al., 2004) . In addition, it was difficult to reach the goal of transmission interruption through snail elimination in the marshland areas, such as Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, Anhui and Jiangsu Provinces, as well as the hilly areas, including Sichuan and Yunnan provinces, where the snails were widely distributed, and the ecological environment were complex. Therefore, during 2000s the emphasis on schistosomiasis control is in marshland and hilly endemic areas (Cao et al., 2003) .",

With the support of all departments, the central fiscal transfer payments programme was quickly implemented, thus achieving the expected results. At the same time, the management model of this project also became the best example for disease prevention and control in The People's Republic of China because of its specific goals, scientific strategies and specific measures, which took into account the vital interests of the people in endemic areas. The 'National Program of Schistosomiasis Comprehensive Control (2004e08)' was organized by multiministries and commissions in October 2004. The central government allocated special funds to carry out comprehensive control of schistosomiasis in heavy endemic areas, focussing on 163 key counties (city, district). The 'National Program of Schistosomiasis Comprehensive Control (2009e15)' was organized in 2010 and reaffirmed the overall goal of schistosomiasis control in The People's Republic of China. The 'National Program of Animal Disease Control for the Mid-and Long Term (2012e20)' was organized in 2012. In addition, suggestions for the twelfth five-year plan of the national economy and social development made by the Central Committee of the CPC were passed during the fifth plenary session of the 17th of the communist party. It was an important task to 'improve the system of public health and medical service' during the \"twelfth five-year' period. According to the policy, a basic public health system, including schistosomiasis control, was to be provided in the future.",

Based on results from epidemiological studies and a further understanding of the characteristics and regularity of schistosomiasis in The People's Republic of China, Chinese scholars paid more attention to the two transmission stages of schistosomiasis, namely the miracidium and snail. It was considered that the waste management of human and livestock was an effective way to control infection and reinfection of schistosome ). The comprehensive control strategy 'on the emphasis of infection source control' was officially announced and implemented in 2006 Wang, 2005; Wang et al., 2009a,b,c) . The central government arranged special funds for water conservancy, agriculture, health and forestry for schistosomiasis control. The comprehensive control strategy 'on the emphasis of infection source control' Policy Support and Resources Mobilization was implemented in endemic areas, through the project resources and the increased investment from the local government. The notice of 'further strengthening the infectious source control of schistosomiasis' was issued to the relevant provinces and the ministries by the State Council general office via an urgent telegram in October 2007. Prohibition of countermeasures to control grazing in the areas of snail habitats was extended since 2008. It was indicated that the Central Committee and the State Council were equally concerned with fighting the 'god of plague', flood prevention and disaster relief and people in the endemic areas were inspired to fight schistosomiasis. In addition, the research institute of parasitic disease of Chinese academy of preventive medicine was renamed to the National Institute of Parasitic Disease, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, in 2002. The national and provincial institutes of parasitic disease made up a scientific research base, which provided guidance for the scientific research of disease control. Three levels of institute (station) of schistosomiasis control, namely municipal (city), county (district) and countryside (town) were still playing a role to organize the implementation of measures. This led to an effective implementation of the measures of the comprehensive control strategy.",

The local governments invested lots of money for it, including agricultural mechanization, safe drinking water, the use of biogas and construction of nonhazardous sanitary latrines. These funds were made up of health project funds from the central transfer payments, construction funds such as agriculture, water conservancy, forestry and land , as well as matching funds from central project supporting funds from the local governments and routine funds of the schistosomiasis control project. This did not only guarantee a smooth development in all the endemic provinces, municipalities (cities), counties (districts), but also improved the efficiency of schistosomiasis control under the construction of a new socialist countryside. In endemic areas of schistosomiasis, the safe drinking water problem of 6 million people were solved, 1.62 million nonhazardous sanitary latrines were built, 490,000 biogas were built, 430,000 cattle were killed, 760 thousands sets of new agricultural machinery were introduced to replaced cattle, 1183 km of the river channel revetment were constructed, 0.17 billion m 2 of paddy fields were changed to dry land, 1272 km of river and lake beach were forbidden from grazing by fence, 20 billion m 2 of prevention forest were built since 2011. The government of Hubei Province invested 240 million yuan to implement cattle elimination, 200,000 head of cattle were killed for 4 consecutive years from 2011 to 2014. Thus, the infectious source of livestock was controlled efficiently by lots of measures, such as promoting the whole county with comprehensive control, establishing agricultural cooperatives and carrying out the 'no oxen county' campaign (data source: Deputy Prime Minister Liu Yandong, speech on the National Conference of Schistosomiasis Control in 2014). Local governments at all levels worked according to the demands of 'building a harmonious society, constructing new countryside' and implemented comprehensive control measures, with emphasis on infectious source e timely suggested by the Ministry of Health. The process of schistosomiasis control were effectively promoted in The People's Republic of China due to the priority of the resources and strategies, methods and technology, and efforts to ensure achievement of anticipated goal (Lin et al., 2007; Yi et al., 2009a,b; Wang et al., 2009a,b,c) . For example, the State Council approved the implementation of the national rural drinking water safety project and solved the drinking water safety problem for 353 million rural residents and more than 24 million students and teachers from 2005 to 2012. In addition, The People's Republic of China has also allocated 18.5 billion yuan to the construction of prevention and control system for animal disease and a comprehensive schistosomiasis control (Li, 2013) . The pilot counties for schistosomiasis-integrated control were set up by the State Council leading group in different endemic areas for the first time, including Jinxian County in Jiangxi Province, AnXiang County in Hunan Province, Hanchuan County in Hubei Province, Guichi County in Anhui Province and Puge County in Sichuan Province. They were the representatives of schistosomiasis-integrated control through implementation of all proposed measures (Yu et al., 2006) . Subsequently, provinces also carried out the pilot work in heavy endemic counties with effective results (Zhang et al., 2009; Zhu et al., 2009; Yang et al., 2009; Yi et al., 2009a,b) .",

There were three rebound epidemics of schistosomiasis in The People's Republic of China: the first one was influenced by the cultural revolution during the 1960s, the second was influenced by the reform of market economy system during the 1980s and the third was affected by the multiple factors of the natural environment and social economy around the 20th century. The CPC and the government paid great importance to schistosomiasis control. The policy system of schistosomiasis control was formed by strengthening the leadership according to the measures of issuing a series of policy document on schistosomiasis control from central to local government, and making central planning and local specific measures. Therefore, the mode of schistosomiasis control depended on the leadership of the government, who indicated the direction of the development and laid the foundation in future.",

But two main problems need to be emphasized on the macrocontrol of policy in future, as follows: Firstly, it was not given enough attention to the schistosomiasis control, which is complex in nature, its economic benefits were always ignored. Therefore, there was a lack in assessment on strategy, especially on comparative assessment on economic benefit analysis of strategy and the rational allocation of resources. Secondly, the investment of schistosomiasis control was under a budgeting system responsible by the state. When the proposed measures did not work, nobody but the state had to bear the economic losses. It also means that there is no competition for investment of schistosomiasis control, so there is no push for an effective use of national resources .",

Vice Premier Liu Yandong, the Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee stressed that the control planning of the next 10 years must be made as soon as possible at the meeting. We must strive to improve the professional technology in order to win the battle of schistosomiasis control in the next 10 years, and strive to realize schistosomiasis elimination. With the social and economic developments, the level of people's life and culture has gradually improved. The government invests more financial and material resources to schistosomiasis control, therefore people will be able to choose a healthy life, far away from schistosomiasis . We believe that we will achieve the goal of schistosomiasis elimination as early as possible, and the long-cherished wish of sending 'the god of plague' will be finally realized through the leadership of the party and government, and the joint efforts from the whole society in the near future (Zheng et al., 2013) .",
