Stepwise logistic regression analyses were performed to identify discriminating variables at baseline and by day 3 of hospitalization. Nasopharyngeal aspiration and antigen detection for influenza virus and respiratory syncytial virus using an immunofluorescence assay (IFA) were routinely performed in patients with CAP. Altogether, 181 patients with CAP (who remained undiagnosed by IFA) and 303 patients with SARS were studied. The mean intervals from symptom onset to admission were 3.1 and 2.8 days, respectively (p>0.05). The etiological agent of CAP was identified retrospectively in only 39% of cases, the majority being bacterial pathogens. At baseline, age and absolute neutrophil count (ANC) were the only independent discriminating variables (p<0.0001). Using a value of <4.4\u00d710 9 /l as the cutoff for ANC, the sensitivity and specificity of ANC for discriminating SARS were 64 and 95%, respectively (AUC 0.90). By day 3 of hospitalization, age (p<0.0001), change in ANC (p=0.0003), and change in bilirubin (p=0.0065) were discriminating variables. A model combining age <65 years, a change in ANC of >\u22123\u00d710 9 /l, and a change in bilirubin of \u22650 mmol/l had a sensitivity of 43% and a specificity of 95% for SARS (AUC 0.90). There are only a few laboratory features (including lymphopenia) that clearly discriminate SARS from other causes of CAP. Nevertheless, when evaluating epidemiologically high-risk patients with CAP and no immediate alternative diagnosis, a low ANC on presentation along with poor clinical and laboratory responses after 72 h of antibiotic treatment may raise the index of suspicion for SARS and indicate a need to perform SARS-CoV testing.",

            "text": "In 2003, the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (CoV) emerged as a new agent of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), causing a global outbreak that led to significant morbidity and mortality [1] [2] [3] . Even in the absence of worldwide transmission, high vigilance is necessary because SARS has the potential to re-emerge. Screening for SARS-CoV among all patients with CAP is not recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) because falsepositive results may have profound infection control implications and lead to unnecessary social disruption [1] . Moreover, such screening is not cost-effective [4] . Therefore, the CDC recommends that SARS-CoV testing be considered in hospitalized patients with radiologically confirmed CAP, provided (a) no alternative diagnosis is identified within 72 h after the initial clinical evaluation, and (b) the patient is thought to be at high risk for infection with SARS-CoV. The risk factors include travel to mainland China, Hong Kong, or Taiwan 10 days before the onset of illness, close contact with sick individuals who traveled to these areas recently, a relevant occupational exposure to SARS-CoV, or association with an unexplained cluster of pneumonia [1] . The epidemiological linkage, however, is often ambiguous and may not be useful in \"nodal\" areas like Hong Kong [2, 5] . Furthermore, the yield of diagnostic tests for CAP is generally low [3, 6] . As the early clinical and radiological features of SARS are rather nonspecific, risk stratification for SARS-CoV testing remains a difficult task. Previous studies have shown that certain hematological/biochemical changes (e.g. lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, elevated liver transaminases) may be useful in the diagnosis of SARS [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] .",

These rapid diagnostic tests are useful because they allow specific treatment (e.g. oseltamivir) to be administered, which is especially important under the current threat of another influenza pandemic [3] .

CAP was diagnosed by physicians in the medical department if symptoms were suggestive of acute lower respiratory infection (e.g. fever, cough with or without sputum production, dyspnea) and were accompanied by acute lung infiltrates evident on chest radiographs, and if the patient had been neither hospitalized within the previous 14 days nor residing in a long-term-care facility [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] .

As the data were not distributed normally, medians and interquartile ranges (IQRs) were used to summarize continuous variables. In the univariate analysis, a nonparametric test (Wilcoxon's rank sum test) was used to compare the baseline values and changes (by days 3 and 5 of admission) of each variable between the two cohorts. The chi-square test was used to compare demographic/clinical variables whenever appropriate. The presence of comorbidity was defined according to systemic illnesses listed in the Pneumonia PORT Severity Index scoring system [3, 16] . Significant variables identified in the univariate analysis (p<0.05) were then entered into separate stepwise logistic regression models together with age, gender, and comorbidity to identify discriminating laboratory changes at baseline and day 3 of admission, respectively [7] . Stepwise methods using the log-likelihood ratio test were performed to see whether the inclusion of new covariates helped to improve the fit of the logistic regression model. Receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves were constructed for each model, and the area under the ROC curve (AUC) was calculated as a measure of discriminative ability for individual/combined variables. In general, AUC \u22650.90 can be regarded as \"excellent\", 0.80 to <0.90 as \"good\", 0.70 to <0.80 as \"fair\", and < 0.70 as \"poor\". Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were provided as estimates of the effect sizes. We also calculated the sensitivity and specificity of independent discriminating variables, using various cutoff values. SAS statistical software (release 8.02; SAS, Cary, NC, USA) was used for the analyses, and the level of significance was set at 0.05 for all comparisons (two-tailed).",

In contrast, lymphocyte counts decreased 12.5 and 25% by days 3 and 5, respectively, in SARS patients, whereas the bilirubin concentration remained static by day 3 and increased 29% by day 5.",

            "text": "Our findings are consistent with those reported by Muller et al. [8] , who found that only the baseline ANC might discriminate \"probable\" SARS-CoV from other causes of CAP by univariate analysis. In addition, we have further demonstrated that even by days 3 and 5 of admission, SARS has few discriminating laboratory changes. The discriminatory ability of ANC observed in Muller's study and in ours likely resulted from the changes in the comparative arm, which consisted mainly of patients with treated bacterial pneumonia [8, 16] . In bacterial pneumonia, neutrophilia is common, and favorable clinical and laboratory responses after appropriate antibiotic therapy usually become evident by day 3 (e.g. resolution of fever and neutrophilia) [6, 16] . The initial transient neutropenia, followed by a gradual increase in neutrophil count as SARS progressed (even before high-dose corticosteroid treatment), might have exaggerated the difference slightly [13, 15, 18] . Similar findings were also noted in a separate analysis (as mentioned in the \"Results\" section) that compared SARS-CoV with other respiratory viral pathogens causing CAP (unpublished data) and in two other independent studies that compared SARS with febrile respiratory illnesses or pneumonia [10, 19] . However, we agree with Muller et al. [8] that the role of a \"low-tonormal\" ANC alone in discriminating SARS-CoV from other causes of CAP is likely limited. Changes of bilirubin concentration in CAP patients might also represent resolution of sepsis [20] , and a small increasing trend of bilirubin in SARS patients might have exaggerated the difference [21] . We also noted that lymphopenia and thrombocytopenia, though prevalent in SARS patients and previously suggested to have diagnostic value in uncontrolled studies, in fact have little discriminatory abilities on their own [7, 8, 10, 18, 19, 22] . Marked lymphopenia and moderate thrombocytopenia tended to occur late in SARS [18] . On the other hand, mild-to-moderate lymphopenia and thrombocytopenia might occur in CAP patients, thus minimizing the differences [10, 23] . Elevated liver transaminases and high C-reactive protein levels (which might indicate a bacterial etiology of CAP) were not useful discriminatory variables according to our analyses [16, 21] . As risk stratification for SARS-CoV testing can be difficult on the basis of clinical and epidemiological evaluations, our results suggest a small but possibly useful role for the routine laboratory variables in the diagnostic algorithm. When managing CAP patients at high risk of infection with SARS-CoV but in whom the etiology remains undiagnosed after rapid antigen detection tests for common respiratory viruses such as influenza virus and RSV, (a) an absence of neutrophilia (ANC <4.4\u00d710 9 /l) on presentation and (b) poor clinical and laboratory responses (change in ANC >\u22123 \u00d7 10 9 /l or change in bilirubin \u22650 mmol/l in patients <65 years) after 72 h of appropriate antibiotic treatment may raise the index of suspicion and indicate the need for SARS-CoV testing, as these variables appear to be quite specific for SARS (95% with each model). Investigation for other viral respiratory pathogens and atypical pneumonia pathogens is also worthwhile because infection with such pathogens can mimic SARS clinically [4, 24, 25] . Because of the low sensitivities (43-64%) of these criteria, about half of the SARS cases will not be identified. We therefore emphasize that monitoring routine laboratory changes can play only a supportive role in the diagnostic algorithm of SARS. The absence of these laboratory changes should not exclude SARS-CoV testing.",
