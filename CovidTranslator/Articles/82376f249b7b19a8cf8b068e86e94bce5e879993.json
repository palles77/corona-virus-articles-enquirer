Implementing the gMMPI, this paper reviews the inequality of the coastal and noncoastal provinces, as well as the latent impact of scale efficiency change (SEC) for China. Using provincial data for the years 1996-2004, the empirical results are as follows. On average, China demonstrates an annual 3.191% productivity change, which is lower than 4.729% for the conventional MPI and accounts for about 26.508% of output growth over the period 1996-2004. Most of this change is propelled by technical progress, while a fraction is driven by the adjustment in production scale, and the efficiency change has an adverse effect. Furthermore, regional inequality is also found in this empirical work, and the productivity change of the coastal region is actually stronger than that of the non-coastal region. This paper also casts some focus on the China Western Development policy. Indeed, we do not find any outstanding achievement from the policy in the sample period, except that the west region sustained its rate of productivity change after 2000. Moreover, the SEC is found to be trivial in the advanced coastal region, but plays an important role in the relatively laggard non-coastal region. The implication of the positive SEC in the non-coastal region means that China's Western Development policy will improve the scale efficiency and the TFP growth of the west region.",

While the change in state policy on international investment and trade has been widely recognized to contribute to the economic growth, 1 technological progress is alternatively regarded as the critical ingredient for sustained economic growth and catching up. Is China's remarkable growth driven principally by factor accumulation? Is there nothing miraculous about its growth, as in Young's (1995) critique on East Asian growth? These issues have inspired a boom of empirical studies to assess productivity growth in China.",

In particular, we assess the contribution of SEC in our model to regional economic growth as an attempt to shed light on regional development policy. Third, the regional (coastal and non-coastal) inequality is widely known as a challenge to the Chinese economy. From the viewpoint of productivity change, we assess whether or not the gap has been harmonized in the past decade. By combining analyses of productivity change on both coastal and non-coastal regions, our results may help to explain the regional disparity between the two regions in China and provide policy implications for regional development. In addition, the article also reviews the attainment of the China Western Development policy in terms of change in productivity and its components.",

O'Donnell et al. (2008, p.232) had indicated that the cause of the differences among the technologies presented by the metafrontier and the group frontiers could be attributed to the deficiencies or discrepancies of economic infrastructure and/or other characteristics of the production environment. In this paper, we regard the coastal and noncoastal regions in China as belonging to different technology sets and operating under distinct group frontiers but facing a common potential metafrontier. The main reason is due to the fact that the economic infrastructure (e.g., transportation construction or available stocks of physical, human and financial capital) and the characteristics of the production environment (e.g., the developmental focus of public policy was heavily skewed toward the coastal regions in the past three decades) in the two regions are widely recognized as heteroskedastic. Nonetheless, from a more long-term perspective, it is possible that the technology gaps might be lessened through designing programs to improve quality, to ameliorate the economic infrastructure and/or to refine the characteristics of the production environment. In recent literature, Fleisher, Li, and Zhao (2009) investigate the income disparity in output and TFP growth. They conduct a series of econometric inspections to show how regional growth patterns in China depend on the economic conditions in terms of human capital and infrastructure capital, as well as foreign direct investment (FDI). A set of cost-benefit analyses is also conducted in the study to derive policy suggestions. The empirical results clearly profile the discrepancies in the intensities of the economic conditions in different development phases and regions. FDI had a significant effect on TFP growth before 1994, and then the effect becomes weaker after that year. The diminished influence of FDI is attributed to the fact that the acceleration of market reforms reduced the relative importance of FDI on technology transmission. Furthermore, both investments in labor factor quality and in physical infrastructure have contributed positively to TFP growth. Nonetheless, investing in human capital would generate higher returns in less-developed regions, while investing in infrastructure would generate higher returns in developed regions. We thus conclude that except for the existing program, China's regional gap could be harmonized by further focusing on and designing suitable schemes of human capital investment in less-developed areas. Thus, the metafrontier conceptually implies a boundary whereby the obstacles of technological development are eliminated and the technological difference among the groups is transcended. Here the metafrontier output-oriented distance function can be expressed as:",

This is due to the fact that the second fraction to the right of the equals sign in the Eq. (10) involves a term of weighted average change rate of inputs, where using the summary average input distance elasticities of the two periods as the weight. Once the weight is not equal to one, the characteristic of VRS is then implied. However, it is a general consensus among researchers that for a wellconstructed productivity index, there are four desirable properties: identity, monotonicity, separability, and proportionality (Orea, 2002) . It is well-recognized that the MMPI shown as Eq. (10) has the first three properties. Nonetheless, the proportionality indicates a homogeneous condition of degree 1. Such a condition would not be satisfied under the VRS, since the summary of the input weights is unequal to unity. In order to rectify the imperfection, we use the distance elasticity shares of inputs to replace the distance elasticity of inputs in Eq. (10) as the weights for the change in inputs. 8 Theoretically, the advantages of such an operation are that it can sustain the ranking and proportion of distance elasticities of inputs and simultaneously ensure the satisfaction of the proportionality property of a well-constructed productivity index.

The scale elasticity is usually defined as a proportion of output change that would be induced by one percent additional factor input change (Ray, 1998) . Meanwhile, the change in factor inputs indicates a cross-period adjustment in the volume of factor use. When the scale elasticity is larger than one, this implies that the production is increasing return to scale.

This study allows us to observe the recent trend of productivity growth. Second, in order to upgrade its economy towards technology-intensive and capital-intensive industries, China created High-Technology Development Zones (HTDZs) in 1995. This indicates that innovative activity has played a role of emerging importance for the Chinese economy since the mid-1990s. Whether or not the emphasis on innovative activity drives China to keep sustainable productivity growth is an important and topical issue. Therefore, it is more relevant to reexamine the issue of regional productivity growth using a data period since the mid-1990s. The data used in this study are mainly sourced from the various issues of China Statistical Yearbook. According to the geographical feature of whether a province is adjacent to the ocean, this study classifies the following twelve provinces into the coastal region: Liaoning, Shandong, Hebei, Beijing, Tianjin, Jiangsu, Shanghai, Zhejiang, Fujian, Guangdong, Guangxi, and Hainan. Table 3 describes the measures of variables and data sources. In Eq. (16), the dependent variable is the gross domestic product (GDP) of region i in year t.

Table 1 respectively reports the estimations of the two regional groups in the regressions 'coastal region' and 'non-coastal region'. As observed from the table, we can see that the intercept of the pooling frontier (i.e., the conventional frontier regarding all of the provinces sharing the same technology) is higher than the two groups' frontiers.

This indicates that a certain functional relationship actually exists among the dependent and explanatory variables that is in line with our fundamental theoretical expectation.

LR test is then conducted referring to the operation in Battese et al. (2004) . The calculated LR statistic is 133.027, which is significant at the 1% statistical level. This result strongly suggests that the provinces in the two regions indeed operate under different frontiers. Thus, the preferred model should be the one separately estimating the frontiers by segmenting the data from the coastal and non-coastal regions. As for the metafrontier, on the basis of Eqs.

            "text": "It is worth noting that the results in Table 3 should be viewed with a degree of skepticism. For a long time, the regional inequality of the coastal and non-coastal regions in China has been intuitively regarded as an accomplished fact that is commonly known a priori. Theoretically, as O'Donnell et al. (2008) have indicated, when production units operate under different conditions of economic infrastructure and/or other characteristics of the production environment, then distinct technological frontiers are implied. An inputoutput combination that is technologically feasible in one group might not be the case in the other group. As discussed in Section 2.1, we treat the coastal and non-coastal regions in China as belonging to different technology sets and operating under distinct group frontiers due to the fact that the economic infrastructure and the characteristics of the production environment in the two regions are widely recognized as heteroskedastic A similar volume of production input might not imply the same volume of output across regions. A similar magnitude and pattern of the values of the two regions are found here in the table despite the significance of the difference test. Based on the diagnosis process of Table 1 , the suspicion of different technology sets should be attributed to the fact that Table 3 refers to results calculated under the conventional setting, which strongly assumes that all of the provinces share the same technology. Thus, as Orea and Kumbhakar (2003) have argued, when production units use different technologies and face different frontiers, estimating an identical frontier function encompassing every unit induces specification bias. Table 4 further demonstrates the estimations of the gMMPI inducted in the preceding section of this study. From the table, it is shown that the productivity growth in the sample period is about 3.191% on average. Comparing with Table 3 , it is easy to find that the overall average change of gMMPI is lower than the 4.729% of conventional MPI. When checking further, this decline could be attributed to disentangling the strong assumption of an identical frontier. Now compared with Table 3 , the average productivity change in the coastal region improves from 4.864% to 5.303%, while the average productivity change in the non-coastal region substantially declines from 4.643% to 1.857%. To interpret the reason that causes the variation more intuitively, we use two figures as illustrations. First, in Fig. 1 , assume that there are two groups of production points, groups 1 and 2. In period t, the groups' frontiers are constructed using the production points of each group respectively, while the pooling frontier is constructed using all the production points together. Here, as estimated in Table 1 , the intercept of the pooling frontier is higher than the intercepts of the group frontiers. Moreover, the metafrontier is depicted as an envelopment curve of the group frontiers.",

Fig. 2 shows that the margin of upward shift in the group frontiers and metafrontier is similar to that of the two groups' production points, because the group frontiers may be estimated separately. However, for the pooling frontier, subject to the assumption of identical technology, the shape of the frontier for the two groups' fractions is the same reciprocally. The margin of upward shift tends to be underestimated in the fraction of group 1's points and overestimated in the fraction of group 2's points.

The 3.191% average growth rate implies that there is about 26.508% of economic growth driven by gains in productivity. 13 To a certain extent, this result supports the viewpoint in the literature that TFP growth plays an important role in the post-reform growth of China (Islam et al., 2006) . Prior to the sample period, Islam et al. (2006) indicated that the TFP growth rate was about 2.95% for 1978 to 2002. Ezaki and Sun (1999) reported the growth rate was 3% to 4% for 1981 to 1995, which contributes 40% of overall growth. Moreover, checking year-to-year productivity change as shown in Table 4 , we clearly see that the TFP change dynamics over the sample period demonstrate a slight slowdown tendency. The change decelerated from 3.912% in 1996 to 2.358% in 2004. While the literature in the past had different views regarding the question of whether China's TFP is accelerating or decelerating, our finding is consistent with the views of Zheng and Hu (2006) and Shiu and Heshmati (2006) that TFP growth in China has slowed since the mid-1990s.",

However, most provinces in the coastal region are in a phase of decreasing return to scale (DRS), and most provinces in the non-coastal regions are in a constant return to scale (CRS) phase. Hence, an increasing input used in the DRS phase further results in the production scale deviating from the TOPS and inducing a negative scale efficiency change. In contrast, an increasing input used in a CRS phase results in the production scale getting closer to the TOPS, which induces a positive scale efficiency change.",

In contrast, the contribution of scale efficiency change in the non-coastal region is positive, which just makes up the inverse impact introduced from the downturn of technical efficiency change on productivity growth. In addition, as in the previous discussion, the TFP growth is almost dominated by the technical change in the coastal region, while the contributions of technical and scale efficiency change are relatively trivial. This situation is not necessarily the case in the non-coastal region. For the non-coastal region, about 47.735% of productivity growth is possessed by the scale efficiency change term despite technical change still having a similar role.",

            "text": "Before reviewing the attainment of the recent China Western Development plan, we briefly summarize the productivity growth and its inclusions in China from a general perspective. Does the Chinese economy sustained by productivity change? Our empirical analysis shows that on the surface of output growth there is indeed the ingredient of productivity gains supporting China's striking economic performance. The TFP growth is about 3.191%, which accounts for about 26.508% of output growth annually over the period from 1996 to 2004. Furthermore, from the introduction of the metafrontier-based methodology, the productivity change should comprise three terms: technical efficiency change, technical and scale efficiency changes; while more of the change is propelled by technical progress (3.395%), and a fraction is driven by the adjustment in production scale (0.399%) and the efficiency change has an adverse effect (\u22120.569%). The reason for these results could be attributed to the fact that after the middle period of the 1990s, the transformation of China towards respecting development of new technology indeed demonstrated its significant achievement on affecting productivity growth. For the developing economies, technological progress usually can be achieved in a shorter period through some formal or informal channels, such as technology purchase or imitation, except for a country's own R&D. Nonetheless, relative improvement of technical efficiency would not be easy to carry out by purchase or through some other borrowing behaviors. Instead, there are needs for fumbling, trial, coordination, experience, and learning by doing, and the required time would be longer. Notes: \u204e\u204e\u204e, \u204e\u204e, and \u204e denote significance of the parameter deviating from 0 at 1%, 5%, and 10% level, respectively. Thus, when the velocity of technological progress is faster than the velocity of enhancement of actual output level, the effect of technical efficiency change using the ratio of actual output to the output level on the technological frontier as the measure on productivity would not be as apparent. This is also the case because the contribution of the scale efficiency change on productivity seems not quite as notable on an aggregate level as compared to technical change. It is not easy for production units to directly perceive whether their own operating scale is too large or too small relative to the optimal scale, which is even more the case with the position of optimal scale. The detection usually requires time for a certain dynamic practical trial and adjustment process. This process involves adjusting and coordinating various types of labor uses and capital inputs. Hence the velocity of scale efficiency change revealed a relatively more moderate result than the technical change.",

This reform pushed China's economy to grow abruptly, and it has drawn much attention from people around the world. However, there is an embedded worry that economic development diverged inside China. The provinces of the east coastal region benefited from the reform by a wide margin and rapidly increased their income level, but the development of inner regions significantly lagged behind. A China Western Development policy was implemented to harmonize the regional gap, which has formally functioned since March of 2000. This plan covers twelve provinces, including Inner Mongolia, Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia, Xinjiang, Oinghai, Tibet, Chongqing, Sichung, Zuizhou, Yunnan, and Guangxi. The core strategy of the policy includes speeding up infrastructure development, enhancing ecological protection, adjusting the industrial structure, promoting education, and magnifying the intensity of openness. In this subsection we evaluate the initial achievement of the policy in terms of productivity gain. To accommodate the review, the provinces of China are further segmented into three regions: east coastal, central and west. 17 The time dimension is also divided into two periods: pre-2000 (1996-2000) and post-2000 (2000-2004) .

The margin of change in the east coastal region significantly weakens from 6.236% in pre-2000 to 4.797% in post-2000, even though the rate still remains high. Similarly, the margin of the changes in the central region also significantly shrinks from 3.248% in pre-2000 to 2.264% in post-2000. The significance of the differences is all checked in Table 6 . In addition, Table 5 shows that the productivity growth hovers about 1.2% to 1.4% in the western region. Despite the low growth rate, Table 6 indicates that the figures of pre-2000 and post-2000 are not statistically different, implying that the productivity growth could be sustained after the year 2000. Indeed, a similar pattern also exists in the dynamics of technical efficiency change. The improved efficiency shows a significant reduction trend from 0.295% to \u22120.037% in the east coastal region and an even a worse trend from 0.019% to \u22120.752% in the central region. As for the western region, the change rates in pre-2000 and post-2000 demonstrate a downturn of about \u22121.035% and \u2212 1.654%, respectively. Nonetheless, the decline trend suggested in Table 6 is not statistically significant.",

On the other hand, the change rates in the central and western regions are weaker, at around 2.929% and 1.436%, respectively. However, the margins of the changes in the central as well as western regions can be sustained after the year 2000. Furthermore, regarding the scale efficiency change, the east coastal region shows a \u22120.451% and the central regions a 0.207% annual upgrade. Interestingly, the western region manifests the strongest scale efficiency growth by a 1.307% margin. This figure is almost equivalent to the magnitudes of overall productivity change, the technical change, and the downturn of technical efficiency change in the western region. Such a result tends to support our argument in the preceding subsection that for the initial development stage of the lagging region, the effect of the scale adjustment would be one dominant factor that is non-negligible and directly apparent. Moreover, Table 6 reports that the difference of the SEC term between pre-2000 and post-2000 is not significant in the western region. The data in Table 6 implies that during the initial period of the West Development policy there remained substantial room for further increases in the input employment scale. That is, factor accumulation serves as the major driving force of economic growth for the western region in the short run. Nonetheless, from a longer-term view of molding an environment of sustainable growth, merely accumulating factors and constructing infrastructure are insufficient. The quality of production factors is particularly critical. As indicated in Fleisher et al. (2009) , to put human capital investment on an equal footing in advancing China Western Development policy is important both from the angles of economic efficiency and for reducing inequality.",

To avoid the potential limitation of China's statistical data, as noted in the literature, and taking into account the characteristics of regional inequality between coastal and non-coastal regions inside China, a rigorously tailor-made methodology is needed. First, this paper embraces the concept of a metafrontier production function model as a means for accurately assessing the issue. The reason for this is mainly because the coastal and non-coastal regions of China face a potentially common metafrontier regardless of the intuitive, theoretical and empirical angles that would assign them to different technology sets and distinct group frontiers. Here, the underlying background is due to the fact that the economic infrastructure and the characteristics of the production environment in the two regions are widely recognized as heteroskedastic. Nonetheless, from a more long-term perspective, it is possible that the technology gaps might be lessened through designing programs to improve the economic infrastructure and/or to refine the characteristics of the production environment. Furthermore, this paper extends O'Donnell et al.'s (2008) metafrontier Malmquist productivity index (MMPI) approach and then develops a framework of generalized MMPI (gMMPI) for meeting the requirement. We impose the regular conditions of a well-constructed productivity index on the MMPI to rectify the potential deficiency that the MMPI does not have the property of proportionality. The major operation is to use the distance elasticity share of inputs to substitute the distance elasticity of inputs for ensuring the weight of cross-period change in inputs of the productivity measure being one to conform to the condition of homogenous of degree 1. This operation has the advantage of developing the MMPI to become a more theoretically rigorous construction. Further, we induct the revised MMPI mathematically and decompose a component of scale efficiency change from it, in addition to the other two components, technical efficiency change and technical change. The scale efficiency change gauges the extent of cross-periods adjustment of production scales toward the technically optimal productive size. Therefore the gMMPI framework is a relatively theoretically complete and rigorous productivity index measure, which gives us the advantage of being able to assess the regional productivity growth and its inclusions in China while considering the characteristic of regional inequality between the coastal and non-coastal regions inside China.",

The TFP growth is about 3.191%, which accounts for about 26.508% of annual output growth over the period from 1996 to 2004. Second, from the introduction of the metafrontier-based methodology, the productivity change should comprise three terms: technical efficiency change, technical and scale efficiency changes; while more of the change is propelled by technical progress (3.395%), and a fraction is driven by the adjustment in production scale (0.399%) and the efficiency change has an adverse effect (\u22120.569%).",

We find that the margin of productivity change in the coastal region seems to shrink more even though growth remained high. Relatively, the western region can sustain its growth despite an absolute low figure. The relative productivity slow-down in the provinces of the coastal region may be due to the natural process of convergence, as discussed in Wu (2000) . This paper also focuses on the China Western Development policy. Indeed, it can be inferred from this study that the Western Development policy has not significantly manifested a benefit on the dimension of TFP in the sample period of 2000 to 2004. However, our results show that the rate of productivity change is sustained for the western region after 2000. Indeed, it is not unusual to obtain such results, since the productivity growth is a concept utilizing a long-term view and there might not have been enough time yet to demonstrate the attainment of the policy. In its initial stage, the Western Development policy places the most focus on the construction of infrastructure, and it is therefore not easy to find significant achievement in the short term.",

In the past, factor accumulation was usually criticized as having no implication in productivity growth. However, we would like to indicate that it is not necessarily the case for all the development phases. Rather, once the usable technology is matched up, the factor accumulation still contributes to productivity. Perhaps the position of factor accumulation is trivial from the perspective of an advanced economy, but for emerging economies in the initial development stage, the scale adjustment plays an important and non-negligible role on TFP growth.",

While China's productivity growth has slowed since the mid-1990s, it is still a spectacular performance when compared to Asian developing and advanced countries. From the perspective of sustainable growth, how to ease the decreasing trend of productivity growth is a critical issue. China should therefore put more effort into innovative activity as well as into protecting intellectual property rights to promote economic growth. Moreover, as indicated in the above discussion, there are differences in productivity growth and its composition between coastal and noncoastal regions. This implies that the government should formulate a specific development policy for the inland region to reduce the income inequality between coastal and non-coastal regions. Essentially, the \"China Western Development\" policy is moving in the correct direction by enabling the western regions to have actually experienced good performance in economic growth in the short term. More importantly, as is also echoed in the recent critical literature of Fleisher et al. (2009) concerning China's regional disparity, the government should carry out some policies to promote persistent TFP growth for the inland regions, such as promoting human resources and technological capability.",
