While its use in chemical hazards and its effect on airway management has been assessed previously, there has been no research assessing whether this equipment affects the ability to perform tracheal intubation. It is the intention of this investigation to answer this question. Methods: Eighteen workers at various level of training were asked to wear three different types of PPE while performing four different types of tracheal intubation. The PPE used included the eye shield, face shield and the ''Dustmaster TM ''. The intubation techniques were direct laryngoscopy, intubation through the intubating laryngeal mask (Fastrach TM ) and flexible bronchoscopy using the eyepiece and an eyepiece with camera attached. We assessed the time to intubate as well as the incidence of oesophageal intubation. A short questionnaire was used to examine participants' subjective experiences of wearing the various types of PPE. Results: There was no significant effect on the time to intubation for any of the methods studied. However, all subjects found that the face shield was uncomfortably hot to wear. Fibreoptic bronchoscopic intubation using the eyepiece was particularly difficult with all of the PPE used due to the distance of the subjects' eye from the eyepiece.",

Unfortunately airway management such as bag and mask ventilation, intubation, suctioning and mask based oxygen and drug delivery appear to have been important vectors of disease transmission. 3 Wearing a correctly fitted face mask (either surgical or particulate respirator type N95) while caring for SARS-CoV patients appears to be protective. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] A variety of personal protection equipment (PPE) has also been suggested for use by HCW in all aspects of patient treatment during such outbreaks. 6 The level of PPE chosen for high-risk procedures such as tracheal intubation is extremely important for both the patient and the treating physician. Rigid prerequisites for the protective ability of such equipment are obviously essential but it is also important that the protective clothing does not impede HCW during clinical procedures, particularly crucial events such as airway management.",

            "text": "Previous studies have investigated the use of protective clothing for chemical hazards [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] and their impact on airway management. Though PPE for chemical and biological hazards may share some common characteristics (e.g. eye and face shields) chemical hazard PPE is often composed of different materials ranging from disposable Tyvek \u00ae to polyvinylchloride ''splash suits''. [8] [9] [10] In contrast, water-resistant or water-proof gowns were the most frequently used clothing during the SARS-CoV outbreak in 2003. [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] During outbreaks of these diseases, anaesthetists are frequently involved in patient airway management, resuscitation and intensive care. This is not because these patients are particularly difficult to intubate, but because the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines 6 stipulate that the most experienced operator should secure the airway in order to minimise delay and secretion dissemination. At such times, tracheal intubation is often necessary and, although other airway devices such as the laryngeal mask may facilitate some temporary ventilation and oxygenation, a properly sealed tracheal tube is often mandatory in the care of these patients. At this stage the optimal level of protection for the HCW performing such high-risk procedures has yet to be found, and in the past the Centre of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) 22 have suggested a number of combinations of PPE. The PPE recommended during the 2003 SARS-CoV outbreak included eye and facial protection, [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] and powered air purifying respirators (PAPR). 14, 15, [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] Recently the WHO has proposed its recommendations for avian flu 6 which includes goggles or eye shields for eye protection. We have, therefore, taken these recommendations as well as reviewed the most commonly used PPE employed during the SARS outbreak in China, Hong Kong and Canada and have adopted this as our ''control PPE''. This control group has then been compared with two other types of PPE to investigate if they had an impact on the ability or time taken to perform tracheal intubation and the comfort of the individual.",

Sixty-seven percent of subjects recorded that PPE 2 generally provided the most comfort for all types of intubation, while the same percentage of subjects rated PPE 1 as having the worst. Numerous comments from the subjects highlighted the uncomfortable environment that PPE 1 produced, with most subjects sweating while wearing the water-resistant surgical gown and face shield despite the air-conditioned environment (23 \u2022 C and 55% relative humidity) in which the study took place. The face shield in PPE 1 often became fogged especially during longer intubation techniques. Subjects frequently needed to adjust their head into different positions to maintain visibility.

The proposal that patients with highly infectious respiratory illness should be placed in negative pressure isolation rooms, which frequently produces a drop in the number of air changes, 17 may compound this temperature problem. Reflections from the back of the face shield in PPE 1 were a problem for two subjects and may be detrimental during tracheal intubation, especially if fogging occurs as well. The use of prescription glasses by subjects wearing PPE 1 while performing fibreoptic intubation with the eyepiece also appears to be troublesome. Two subjects found this combination made the procedure very difficult but not impossible. We suggest that if contact lenses are available, then these should be worn prior to applying the PPE.",

Although there is concern that ventilation other than through a tracheal tube may lead to dissemination of secretions, we felt that initial ventilation via the laryngeal mask would be of lesser risk than for face mask ventilation. On the other hand the average time with no ventilation using the bronchoscopic eyepiece method ranged from 61.9 to 70.2 s for all types of PPE. This may impact on the main-tenance of oxygenation in patients with respiratory illness when the fibreoptic bronchoscope using the eyepiece is used.",

This resulted in all subjects expressing concern if this type of technique was to be used while wearing PPE.

There were also difficulties in viewing the fibreoptic bronchoscopic eyepiece through the face shields of PPE 1 and PPE 2. The study showed that using bronchoscopic methods was inferior to iLMA, which allowed significantly earlier ventilation of the lungs. This suggests that the iLMA should be used in preference to the fibreoptic bronchoscope when difficulties in viewing the larynx are experienced during direct laryngoscopy.",
