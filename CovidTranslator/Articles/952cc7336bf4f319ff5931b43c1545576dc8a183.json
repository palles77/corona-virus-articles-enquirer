In ferret passage, this ''1918-like'' virus acquired substitutions in HA and polymerase associated with altered tissue tropism, enhanced replication, and efficient transmissibility (Watanabe et al., 2014) . Here, we use deep sequencing to evaluate the evolutionary processes by which these viruses adapted to replication and transmission in mammals.

Introducing the mammal-adapting substitution PB2 E627K enhanced replication (Figures S1A, S1B, and S1E), but not transmission. To assess the impact of known mammalian-adapting mutations in HA on transmission of this virus, HA E190D and G225D (H3, mature peptide numbering) were introduced into the 1918-like avian/ PB2 E627K virus, generating what we will term the ''avian-like'' ''HA190D225D'' virus. Deep sequencing showed that both HA E190D and G225D arose naturally before being introduced: each was detectable in one animal 5 days after inoculation with the 1918-like avian virus ( Figures 1A and 1B) . HA E190D became dominant in all three animals inoculated with the 1918-like avian/PB2 E627K virus ( Figure 1C ). The HA190D225D virus was transmitted in 1 of 3 ferret pairs (Figures S1C and S1F). To characterize mutations occurring in HA190D225D, we analyzed RNA isolated from stock viruses and from nasal secretions from all three index animals and the infected contact. We included stock viruses in this analysis both to define ''input'' viral populations and because even viruses created by reverse ge-netics can accumulate mutations during passage in culture. We enumerated all SNPs occurring at R1% frequency in each virus sequenced; we previously established that this conservative cutoff ensures that only bona fide mutations are considered (Wilker et al., 2013) .",

            "text": "Sequencing revealed that two additional HA mutations arose and were transmitted. HA G400A, encoding serine-to-asparagine at amino acid 113 (S113N), was present in 3% of viruses in the HA190D225D stock and rose to 46%-75% in all three index animals by 3 days post-inoculation, declining on day 5 (Figure 1D , solid traces). S113N was detected in 63% of viruses in the contact soon after transmission ( Figure 1D , broken trace). The second mutation, HA A868T, encoded aspartate-to-valine at position 265 (D265V). D265V was not detectable in the virus stock above 1% but increased in frequency in all three index animals and was present in 40% of viruses transmitted to the contact ( Figure 1E ). Both S113N and D265V are located near the base of the HA globular head ( Figure 1F ). Cloning and sequencing of full-length HA from day 5 showed that S113N and D265V were linked in a small fraction of viruses (2/20 [10%] clones in index and 1/32 [3.125%] in contact; Figures  S2A and S2B ). Viruses were next isolated from the contact animal's nasal wash at day 9 post-contact and amplified on MDCK cells to produce the ''Mut'' stock virus, which was used to inoculate another three ferret pairs (Watanabe et al., 2014) . The Mut virus exhibited similar replication kinetics and pathogenicity to human-derived 1918 viruses and was transmitted in 2/3 pairs (Figures S1D and S1F) (Watanabe et al., 2014) . HA S113N and D265V were maintained at frequencies comparable to those in the inoculum (Figures 1G and 1H, solid traces) . Another novel HA mutation, HA T634C, arose, encoding isoleucine-to-threonine at position 187 (I187T) near the receptor-binding pocket ( Figure 1F ). Present at 4% in the Mut stock virus, I187T rose to 32%-41% in all three index animals by day 5 post-inoculation and was fixed after transmission in contact animal 1 ( Figure 1I ). I187T was not transmitted to contact animal 3 but arose on day 9 post-contact. The rapid increase of I187T in all index animals and its independent re-generation in contact animal 3 strongly suggest that this mutation is advantageous. Indeed, all 17 publicly available human 1918 sequences have 187T, as do 310/338 full-length avian H1N1 HAs (Reid et al., 1999 (Reid et al., , 2003 Sheng et al., 2011; Taubenberger et al., 1997) . S113N, D265V, and I187T were not all transmitted together. S113N was fixed in contact animal 3 after transmission, while D265V and I187T were undetectable (Figures 1G-1I, light blue broken traces). By contrast, D265V and I187T were fixed after transmission in contact animal 1, and S113N was undetectable ( Figures 1G-1I , dark blue broken traces). Cloning and Sanger sequencing showed that S113N and D265V were linked at % 33% frequency in Mut index animals 1 and 3 (Figures S3C and S3D); we cannot determine from these data why S113N and D265V were not transmitted together. Our results suggest that in this genetic context, HA 190D and 225D may benefit transmission, but multiple other SNPs may also bestow increased transmission efficiency.",

Introducing HA190D and 225D into the 1918-like avian virus in the laboratory likely affected the evolutionary pathway these viruses followed, and we cannot know how evolution would have proceeded in their absence. Once introduced, HA 225D remained at or near fixation in all HA190D225D-infected animals ( Figure S3A ). Although G225D was present in 97% of the Mut stock virus, its frequency decreased to 72%-87% by day 5 post-inoculation in all three index animals ( Figure 1J , solid traces). Sequencing at day 5 revealed glycine at position 225 (225G) in 9%-15% of viruses (Fig-ures S3B-S3D) . Also, an asparagine (225N) was now encoded by 8%-13% of viruses in index animals 1 and 3 (Figures S3B-S3D). HA 225D was fixed after transmission in both contacts, but its frequency declined to 93% in contact 3 by day 9 (Figure 1J) . Indeed, by day 5 viruses encoded a mixture of 225D/ 225N in contact 1 and 225D/225N/225G in contact 3 ( Figures  S3B and S3C ). Thus, G225D may be favored during transmission between hosts, but polymorphism at 225 seems to be tolerated within a host.",

It enables binding to both a-2,6 and a-2,3 receptors and increases binding to non-sialylated glycans (Matos-Patr\u00f3 n et al., 2015) . Diversity at position 225 may therefore be maintained due to balancing selection, which preserves multiple beneficial alleles in a population.

D265V is located proximal to S113N ( Figure 1F ) and may serve a similar function in modulating heat stability.

Comparing the frequencies of synonymous (silent) and nonsynonymous (amino-acid-changing) polymorphisms, denoted pS and pN, respectively, allows us to evaluate the impact of natural selection. pS > pN indicates that, on average, purifying selection is acting to remove deleterious mutations, while pN > pS indicates that diversifying selection is favoring new mutations. Effectively equal levels of pN and pS suggest that allele frequencies are determined primarily by genetic drift. The influenza genome in index animals infected with the HA190D225D and Mut viruses is generally under purifying selection: pS was significantly greater than pN for almost every viral gene, except for NS2/NEP in the Mut index animals (p < 0.01 or p < 0.001, Tables 1 and S2). Strikingly, the exception to this pattern was the 344-codon HA1 region of HA. pN/ pS ratios for HA1 were >1 at every time point in each index animal (range = 1.128-3.077, Table S2 ), likely primarily due to high-frequency SNPs in codons 113, 187, 225, and 265, although there were also 6-7 nonsynonymous HA1 SNPs present between 1%-13% (Table  S3 ). Average HA1 pN/pS > 1 in HA190D225D and Mut index animals when all time points are combined (mean pN/pS = 1.718 and 2.007, respectively; p < 0.001, Table 1 ). These data provide further indication that diversification in HA1 is strongly favored in index animals.",

We use the term ''haplotype'' to denote a set of mutations that co-occur on the same DNA molecule. If a given set of mutations is beneficial, we would expect the frequency of haplotypes containing those variants to increase. To test whether selection favored specific HA haplotypes, we used LinkGE, a computational tool we developed and validated previously (Wilker et al., 2013) , which enumerates combinations of nucleotides at specified sites in deep sequencing data. We assessed all polymorphic sites in HA1 detected more than once, resulting in a final query of 12 sites (see Supplemental Experimental Procedures and Tables S4 and S5) . Haplotype diversity expanded dramatically during viral replication. Two haplotypes were present during initial HA190D225D infection in the index animal, but five were present by day 5 ( Figure 4A ). Similarly, 3-5 HA haplotypes were present in the Mut virus on day 1, rising to 9-10 on day 3, and 12-14 on day 5 ( Figures 4B and 4C ). By day 5, no HA haplotype was pre-sent above 30% in index animals. In agreement, Shannon entropy in HA dramatically increased over time in index animals ( Figures 4E and 4F ).",

Transmission of only a few virions would result in a founder effect, with reduced diversity across the entire viral genome; this effect does not necessarily involve natural selection. Selection favoring transmission of specific variants might be observed as a reduction in diversity localized to the selected region or gene segment. Fixation of advantageous alleles by selection and the resulting reduction in linked nucleotide diversity is called a selective sweep (Nielsen, 2005) . Strong selection during transmission could favor the emergence of mammalian-transmissible viruses, while strong founder effects might impose a barrier to host switching. To differentiate among these processes, we calculated pN and pS across the viral genome at time points surrounding transmission. As we cannot know the exact day on which contact animals became infected, we evaluated viruses in the contact animal at the first time point at which virus was detectable and the corresponding time point in the index animal. To ensure that this choice did not significantly impact our results, we also performed these analyses using the index animal day 3 viruses.",

These data together suggest that HA190D225D transmission involved a loose genetic bottleneck. This could indicate that infection in the contact was founded by a large viral inoculum.

Mean pN Haplotypes were defined using LinkGE to query 12 nucleotide positions corresponding to amino acids 113, 145, 159, 187, 189, 190, 192, 225, and 265 . Each color represents a unique, arbitrarily numbered haplotype. Numbers above each bar indicate number of haplotypes detected in that time point.

Again, there were no significant differences in the change in pS across genes (F 10, 22 = 0.29; p = 0.976; Figure 5F ). As in pair 1, only a single HA1 haplotype was detectable immediately after transmission, and entropy dropped from 3.06 to 0 ( Figure 4F ). Notably, different haplotypes were transmitted in pairs 1 and 3: HA D265V and I187T were fixed in pair 1 while HA S113N became fixed in pair 3 ( Figures 4B and 4C ). The transmitted haplotype in pair 1 was present in only 5% of the viral population in the index animal on day 3 ( Figure 4B ), underscoring our previous finding (Wilker et al., 2013) that variants present at very low frequencies in a source host can be transmitted by respiratory droplets. Analysis of pN and pS in viruses infecting Mut contact animals revealed that all the gene segments, including HA1, are under purifying selection after transmission. One exception was in pair 1, where pN/pS was 1.471 in PB2 on day 5, after which the entire genome remained under purifying selection for the duration of infection. In pair 3, a signal of diversifying selection is only detectable on day 5 in HA1 (pN/pS = 1.520, Table S2 ), the effects of which are apparent in an expansion of HA haplotypes and increase in entropy on day 9 ( Figures 4C-4F) .",

Much of the genetic variation in HA190D225D was transmitted, and selection continued to favor HA diversification in the contact animal. In contrast, Mut virus transmission involved reductions in genetic diversity that were sharpest in HA1. Patterns of diversity in both Mut pairs suggest that selection for HA1 variants occurred during transmission; the genome-wide reduction in diversity in Mut pair 3 may be a consequence of the combined action of selection on HA1 and a smaller infecting dose than in pair 1. Importantly, the data we observe in the Mut pairs cannot be explained by a founder effect. The increase or maintenance of diversity across the rest of the genome strongly suggests that multiple virions were transmitted, each of which harbored a single HA haplotype packaged with different variants of the other 7 gene segments. Our data therefore indicate that Mut virus transmission involved a selective sweep acting on HA1. We postulate that founder effects could have occurred in this study but that selection for HA1 variants had a greater impact on genetic diversity.",

We have shown that selection reduces HA nucleotide diversity during H5N1 reassortant virus transmission in ferrets (Wilker et al., 2013) , similar to what we observe during transmission of the Mut virus. Although the H5N1 viruses we studied previously had an avian HA, the rest of their genome was derived from a 2009 H1N1 human pandemic isolate, limiting our ability to assess selection acting outside of HA. The present work afforded the opportunity to characterize selection across the entire avian-like influenza genome. An important caveat is that three amino acid substitutions were artificially introduced into the transmissible HA190225D virus. Although both HA E190D and G225D arose naturally before their introduction, PB2 E627K did not, and it is unknown whether these mutations would have become fixed had evolution proceeded organically. The timing of mutation emergence, the identity of adaptive substitutions, and the number of rounds of replication required may have been different if the evolutionary pathway of this particular virus had been completely unaltered. Despite these caveats, we find that selection is primarily confined to HA1, where diversification is strongest at a few sites encoding amino acids in the globular head (113 and 265) and near the sialic acid binding pocket (187, 190, and 225) .",

PB2 A684D was first detectable immediately after transmission ( Figure 2B ), suggesting that it arose de novo in the contact animal. PA V253M, present in only 9% of viruses in the index animal on day 5, was at 73% in the contact immediately after transmission (Figure 2A) . We cannot conclusively determine whether PA V253M was transmitted as a minor variant or arose de novo afterward. What is clear is that these two polymerase mutations drastically changed in frequency during the first transmission event and became fixed for the rest of the study, even though previous functional analyses suggested that these substitutions reduce the processivity of the 1918-like avian polymerase (without PB2 E627K) in vitro (Watanabe et al., 2014) . In the presence of PB2 E627K, these mutations did not alter polymerase activity, suggesting that PB2 E627K was the primary deter-minant of improved viral replication. Viruses reached similar titer in vivo whether PB2 A684D and PA V253M were at low frequency (HA190D225D index animals) or nearly fixed (Mut index animals; Figure S1E ). These mutations could confer an advantage that we did not directly test (e.g., RNA stability, RNA folding, codon bias). Given our phenotypic data and the known potential for bottlenecks to alter diversity in populations without selection (Hamilton et al., 2012; Varble et al., 2014) , perhaps these mutations hitchhiked to high frequency during transmission. These data underscore that fixation of nonsynonymous variants after transmission is not in itself evidence that they are advantageous and agree with a recent study showing that tight bottlenecks during H7N9 virus transmission allowed deleterious variants to remain at high frequency (Zaraket et al., 2015) . Together, our data suggest that for an avian virus to cross species barriers, overcoming the stochastic fluctuation of mutations during transmission bottlenecks may be just as essential as generating a constellation of mammalian-adapting mutations. Fixation or maintenance of non-or maladaptive mutations during airborne transmission may be a previously unappreciated barrier to influenza crossspecies transmission.",

For any virus lineage, evolving human transmissibility may not require convergence on one specific set of amino acid substitutions.

Synthesizing our data and previous studies, we offer the following conceptual framework to explain our observations, acknowledging that expanded studies are necessary to confirm its broader application. We propose that the stringency of transmission bottlenecks and the main evolutionary forces driving them may change throughout the host adaptation process. We speculate that at earlier stages of host adaptation, there may not be one ''most fit'' virus that is able to outcompete the rest of the population after transmission to localized regions of the respiratory tract (Karlsson et al., 2015; Lakdawala et al., 2015; Matrosovich et al., 2004) . A non-mutually exclusive hypothesis is that a larger inoculum may be required to found infection in the absence of a single highly fit variant. These hypotheses could explain the surprising finding that the first transmission bottleneck was loose, even though relatively few ''avian-like'' viruses would be expected to be fit for transmission in mammals. Indeed, we speculate that viruses that are well adapted for transmission in a particular host species would again exhibit loose transmission bottlenecks, as most variants would be of similar transmission fitness; the recent observation of loose genetic bottlenecks in transmission of seasonal influenza viruses among human household contacts supports this hypothesis (Poon et al., 2016) .",

A tight bottleneck could result from numerous mechanisms, including a small founding population or the ability of a particularly fit variant to outcompete other transmitted virions very early after infection. Initial localized infection by one or a few variants in the contact animal (Karlsson et al., 2015) could also allow for the early dominance of a particular HA variant that then spreads through the upper respiratory tract. Airborne transmission involves numerous steps that impact the makeup of the viral population in the contact: to found infection, virions expelled by the source host must remain viable in a droplet, be inhaled in the contact, and then successfully replicate. Selection could act on any or all of these stages to influence the bottleneck we observe. Should these hypotheses be supported by future investigations, then defining within-host selection and transmission bottlenecks occurring in a spillover infection could be a way to assess the pandemic potential of emerging viruses: tight bottlenecks that include mammal-adapting variants would be expected to characterize viruses undergoing a transition to efficient transmissibility. It is also plausible that the size and stringency of influenza transmission bottlenecks vary widely due to chance alone, rather than progressive host adaptation. Multiple productive exposures, different routes of transmission, and/or differing infectious doses could have this effect without involving selection. We find this scenario less likely for our data given the signatures of selection in both contact animals in the second transmission event, but it too remains a possibility that merits further exploration.",

Mut index 3, day 5 n = 13 S113N + D265V S113N I187T I187T + D265V D265V WT Due to read length limitations of Illumina sequencing, we were unable to determine whether HA mutations S113N and D265V were linked using our haplotype analysis. To determine whether these two mutations were encoded on the same HA molecules in infected animals, we cloned and sequenced full length HA from HA190D225D index and contact 3, and from the Mut index animals on day 5. The fraction of clones containing each mutation combination are shown as different colors within the pie chart and the number of clones sequenced is displayed below each. (a) On day 5 in HA190D225D index animal 3, we acquired 20 HA clones, of which 5/20 (25%) encoded only S113N, 5/20 (25%) encoded only D265V, 2/20 (10%) encoded both S113N and D265V together, and the remaining 8/20 (40%) contained neither mutation (WT). (b) On day 5 in HA190D225D contact animal 3, we sequenced 32 clones, of which 25/32 (78.125%) encoded S113N alone, 4/32 (12.5%) encoded D265V alone, 1/32 (3.125%) encoded both S113N and D265V together and 4/32 (6.25%) encoded neither mutation. (c) For day 5 in Mut index animal 1, we were only able to acquire 6 clones. 2/6 (33%) encoded S113N and D265V together, 2/6 (33%) encoded I187T and D265V together, and 2/6 (33%) encoded D265V alone. I187T and S113N were not detected in any of the 6 clones without D265V also present, although the small number of clones we were able to acquire may not fully capture the diversity present in the viral population at that timepoint. (d) For day 5 in Mut index animal 3, we sequenced 13 clones. 1/13 clones (7.69%) encoded both S113N and D265V, 5/13 (38.46%) encoded both D265V and I187T together, and 7/13 (53.85%) encoded D265V alone. Again, S113N and I187T were not found in any sequences that did not also contain D265V. This figure shows the same data as Fig. 5 , except that the \u03c0 statistic was calculated using PoPoolation software, rather than SNPGenie, and corrected for potential template resampling. (a) The first transmission event is characterized by a loose genetic bottleneck, in which a minor, and not statistically significant, reduction in both synonymous and nonsynonymous nucleotide diversity is observed across almost every gene segment. (b, c) After further adaptation, transmission in both Mut pairs is characterized by a selective sweep over the HA1 region of HA, resulting in a significant reduction in nucleotide diversity centered over HA1. In Mut pair 1 (b), nucleotide diversity is increased or only slightly decreased in all gene segments excluding HA after transmission. In Mut pair 3 (c), nucleotide diversity is reduced most strongly in HA but also across the other gene segments, suggesting the possible combination of a selective sweep and a small founding population size. (d-f) Because the exact day that transmission occurred is not known, we compared changes in nucleotide diversity using both the index animal day 5 and day 3 timepoints. The comparison using day 5 is shown in the main text in Fig. 5 and the same data using the index animal day 3 data are shown here. (d) As in Fig. 5 , during transmission between the HA190D225D pair, both synonymous and nonsynonymous diversity are slightly reduced across the genome, with the exception of a large reduction in M2 synonymous diversity. (e and f) In Mut pairs 1 and 3, nonsynonymous diversity is reduced the most significantly in HA1. In Mut pair 1 (e) synonymous and nonsynonymous diversity are only slightly decreased or increased across the rest of the genome, while in Mut pair 3 (f), diversity is also reduced in other genome segments, possibly due to a founder effect. Table S1 , related to Experimental Procedures. Primer sequences used for PCR. Segments were amplified using specific PCR primers as listed above. \u03c0N/\u03c0S ratios of infected index and contact ferrets from the groups inoculated with the HA 190D225D stock virus and the Mut virus. Values represent those calculated using one of two methods. The first is a method that adapts method of estimating synonymous and nonsynonymous substitutions from next-generation sequencing data . These estimates were performed using deep sequence data subsampled such that each base position is covered by approximately 5000x coverage. The second set of values represent those calculated from deep sequence data subsampled such that each base position is covered by 1000x coverage using PoPoolation. For both, red values highlight genes with \u03c0N/\u03c0S ratios greater than 1, suggesting that diversity is favored at these loci. With the exception of the HA gene, most of the influenza genome is under purifying selection during replication at all time points. Table S3 , related to Figure 1 . SNPs detected in HA in index and contact animals in both the HA190D225D and Mut transmitting pairs. Shown are every mutation detected in at least 1% of all sequencing reads for every timepoint in the index and contact animals in the HA190D225D and Mut transmitting pairs. Amino acid changes are represented in H3 mature peptide numbering as is shown in the manuscript. Mutations occurring within the signal peptide are numbered with reference to the amino acid number within the signal peptide and are denoted by \"(SP)\" in the amino acid change column. Mutations occurring before the signal peptide are denoted as \"non-coding\" in the amino acid change column. Nucleotide changes are shown in reference to the original 1918-like avian influenza virus. Syn indicates that the mutation was synonymous, i.e., did not cause a change in amino acid. \"SNP\" denotes a single nucleotide polymorphism and \"fs\" denotes a frameshift mutation. We queried every polymorphic nucleotide site in HA that occurred more than once in the study, i.e., in either more than 1 animal or in more than 1 timepoint. This resulted in a final query of 12 nucleotide positions (400, 507, 550, 634, 640, 644, 648, 653, 747, 748, 749, and 868) , which encode 9 amino acid substitutions (113, 145, 159, 187, 189, 190, 192, 225, and 265) . Due to the limits imposed by the average fragment length of the input sequencing library, we were unable to query all of the sites of interest in HA in a single window. We therefore analyzed each sample with two overlapping windows. Window 1 covered 9 nucleotide sites (634, 640, 644, 648, 653, 747, 748, 749 and 868) and window 2 covered 8 nucleotide sites (400, 507, 550, 634, 640, 644, 648, 653) . Each haplotype was given an arbitrary number as shown in the left-most column. For each window, the nucleotide and amino acid positions queried are displayed in the first row in bold. For each unique haplotype, the identity of the nucleotide and corresponding amino acid identified at that position are shown.

All samples from ferrets infected with 1918-like avian influenza viruses were generated prior to the gain-of-function research pause. Sequences were generated using viral RNA previously isolated from nasal wash samples collected as part of a previously described study (Watanabe et al., 2014) . Briefly, a fully avian reassortant H1N1 virus was generated by combining the gene segments from recently circulating avian influenza viruses that share the closest nucleotide sequence identity to the 1918 human pandemic virus. Plasmids encoding these gene segments were synthesized and used to generate the initial 1918-like avian virus stock by reverse genetics (Hoffmann et al., 2000) . This virus was then used to inoculate 3 index ferrets. One day later, a na\u00efve contact ferret was placed in an adjacent cage separated by wire mesh that allows respiratory droplet transmission but prevents ferrets from coming into direct contact with one another. Transmission was assessed by serology and virus isolation. Live virus was not detectable in any contact ferrets after index animals were inoculated with the original 1918-like avian virus, although the virus replicated to low titer in index animals (Fig. S1 ). Introduction of a glutamate-to-lysine change at position 627 in the PB2 protein (PB2 E627K) increased 1918-like virus replication in index ferrets, but transmission was still not observed in any of 3 ferret pairs and no contact animals seroconverted. Introduction of 2 more amino acid substitutions, aspartates at positions 190 and 225 in HA (HA E190D and G225D), resulted in a virus transmissible in 1 of 3 ferret pairs and seroconversion in the single infected contact animal. We refer to the virus stock containing these 3 substitutions in PB2 and HA (PB2 E627K, HA E190D and HA G225D) as the HA190D225D virus. Virus was isolated from nasal wash fluid from the single HA190D225D-infected contact animal on day 9 post-contact. This viral isolate was amplified on MDCK cells to produce the \"Mut\" stock virus, which was then used to inoculate 3 more index ferrets. Transmission and seroconversion were observed in 2 of 3 contact animals in this experiment. Nasal washes were collected from all infected index ferrets on days 1, 3, and 5 post-inoculation and from contact ferrets on days 5, 7, and 9 post-contact. Viral RNA was isolated from these nasal washes and used for deep sequencing.",

The first, as displayed in the manuscript (Fig. 3, Fig. 5, Fig. S5b , d and f, and Tables 1 and S2), calculated the synonymous (\u03c0S) and nonsynonymous (\u03c0N) nucleotide diversity using SNPGenie , which adapts method of estimating synonymous and nonsynonymous substitutions for next-generation sequencing data Wilker et al., 2013) . For this method, reference-based assemblies were used to call SNPs at a 0.0001% frequency cutoff, which allowed us to detect every single SNP in the assembly. To reduce possible effects of resequencing or uneven coverage across samples, assemblies were subsampled using CLC assembly cell such that each gene had approximately 5000x coverage before SNP calling (average coverage after subsampling = 5054 \u00b1 2438). Inherent in this calculation of \u03c0N and \u03c0S is a method of determining the number of nonsynonymous and synonymous sites that weights the sites by the actual frequencies of codons in the population. Thus, if there is any sort of codon bias, this is reflected in the number of sites, which effectively measures the number of possible changes experienced by the codons that are actually present in the population. This method does not incorporate a correction for transition/transversion rate variation. \u03c0N and \u03c0S were also independently estimated using PoPoolation version 1.2.2 for comparison , which is shown in Table S2 and Figure S5a , c and e. For this analysis, SAM files of the referencebased mappings were exported from CLC Genomics Workbench and converted to sorted pileup files using SAMtools (Li et al., 2009) . To reduce possible bias from resequencing for very high coverage samples (samples for which coverage exceeded the known titer at that timepoint), all pileup files were randomly subsampled to ensure even coverage across every nucleotide position using the PoPoolation subsamplepileup.pl script . After subsampling, all bases in each sample were covered to a depth between 100x and 1000x, and these subsampled pileup files were used for all diversity estimates. \u03c0 was calculated using the Variance-at-position.pl script and \u03c0N and \u03c0S estimates were calculated on a genewise level using the Syn-nonsyn-at-position.pl script. Sliding window analysis of nucleotide diversity was performed with the Syn-nonsyn-sliding.pl script using a window size of 150 nucleotides and a step size of 3 nucleotides. Corrections were disabled for all \u03c0 analyses. Results using the SNPGenie and PoPoolation methods were highly concordant; as such, we only reported the former results in the main manuscript with the latter estimates shown in Supplemental tables and figures.",

In order to rigorously assess as much haplotype diversity as possible, we chose to query every polymorphic nucleotide site in HA that occurred more than once in the study, i.e., in either more than 1 animal or in more than 1 timepoint. This resulted in a final query of 12 nucleotide positions (400, 507, 550, 634, 640, 644, 648, 653, 747, 748, 749, and 868) , which correspond to 9 amino acid positions (113, 145, 159, 187, 189, 190, 192, 225, and 265) . Due to the limits imposed by the average fragment length of the input sequencing library, we were unable to query all of the sites of interest in HA in a single window. We therefore analyzed each sample with two overlapping windows, each covering 11 of the 12 nucleotide positions. As such, haplotypes for each sample were enumerated twice, once by querying sites 400, 507, 550, 634, 640, 644, 648, 653, 747, 748, and 749, and again by querying 507, 550, 634, 640, 644, 648, 653, 747, 748, 749, and 868 .

For example, the comparison of \u03c0N and \u03c0S for index animals in the Mut group used \u03c0N and \u03c0S values for all 3 index animals on all 3 timepoints combined, resulting in a final paired comparison of 9 \u03c0N values verses 9 \u03c0S values testing the null hypothesis that \u03c0N = \u03c0S. These were performed using Minitab. For comparing changes in \u03c0N and \u03c0S during transmission, the mean of the differences in \u03c0N and \u03c0S values between index and contact animals were compared using a 1-way ANOVA. If differences were observed among genes, individual comparisons among genes were performed using Dunnett's test. These analyses were performed in Minitab. The ANOVA test comparing infectious viral titers (Fig. S1e ) was performed in Prism version 6.0b for Mac (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA, www.graphpad.com). A one-way ANOVA with Tukey's multiple comparisons test was used to assess statistically significant differences in titers between groups.",
