No specific analysis has been done on the epidemiological and clinical features of HAdV in pediatric pneumonia in China. Nasopharyngeal aspirates were collected from hospitalized children with pneumonia from June 2009 to May 2014. All samples that tested positive for HAdV were typed by sequencing the hexon and fiber genes. From a total of 3089 samples, 208 (6.7 %) were positive for HAdV, identified as belonging to HAdV-B (186, 89.4 %), HAdV-C (9, 4.3 %) and HAdV-E (1, 0.5 %). HAdV-7 (104, 50.0 %) and HAdV-3 (78, 37.5 %) were the two major types, followed by HAdV-1, HAdV-55 and HAdV-14. There were 87 (41.8 %) single HAdV infections, of which 80 % were HAdV-7 infections. Multivariate analysis showed that single infections with HAdV-7 were associated with a higher prevalence of severe pneumonia. Temporal patterns showed that, except for a simultaneous outbreak of HAdV-3 and HAdV-7 during the years 2010-2011, HAdV-7 and HAdV-3 were alternately predominant, and the dominance shifted to HAdV-3 after 2014. Identification of the predominant HAdV genotypes and their epidemical features is useful for determining preventive strategies. HAdV-7 associated severe pneumonia needs to be considered with high priority in clinical practice.",

            "text": "Human adenoviruses (HAdVs) are a significant cause of acute respiratory disease (ARD). They are associated with sporadic infection, as well as with community and institutional outbreaks, particularly among military recruits [7] . There are at least 68 recognized HAdV genotypes (http:// HAdVwg.gmu.edu/), which are assigned to seven subgroups (A-G) according to their biophysical, biochemical, and genetic characteristics, with marked differences in tissue tropism and clinical manifestations. Depending on the infecting HAdV types, a broad spectrum of clinical illnesses can be observed [13] . The types most commonly associated with respiratory syndromes belong to HAdV species C (HAdV-C1, -C2, -C5, and -C6), HAdV species B, subspecies B1 (HAdV-3 and HAdV-7) and B2 (HAdV-14) [15] . These viruses rarely cause serious or fatal illness in otherwise healthy individuals, but they can cause severe disease in newborn, elderly, or immunocompromised persons [6, 19] . A well-known feature of HAdV is frequent recombination between members of the same species and between members of different species, which has acted as an important force driving the evolution of HAdV genetics [12] . For the emerging new types or recombinant strains, there is strong potential for wide spread and even epidemic outbreaks, partially due to the lack of herd immunity. There is therefore a need for continuous surveillance, with extensive molecular characterization, to determine the prevalence and genetic characteristics of the circulating HAdVs.",

In the HAdV-positive vs. negative model, after adjusting for the effects of age, gender, delay from onset to admission, and coinfection with other viruses, HAdV infection was demonstrated to significantly increase the risk of severe pneumonia (OR, 2.391; 95 % CI, 1.774-3.223). In the HAdV-3 vs. HAdV-7 model, the OR of HAdV-7 for severe pneumonia was 1.318 (95 % CI, 1.119-1.553) compared to HAdV-3 after considering the other effects (Table 3) .",

            "text": "Pediatric pneumonia caused by viral infection has always been of great public-health concern worldwide because of its high morbidity and mortality. A wide variety of etiological agents has been documented, among which HAdV is thought to be a significant contributor. In China, there have been recent studies investigating the prevalence of HAdV subspecies B1 in respiratory distress, but mostly involving adults. A multicenter surveillance for community-acquired pneumonia that was conducted in northern China between 2010 and 2012 demonstrated HAdV-55 to be the predominant genotype, followed by HAdV-7, HAdV-3, HAdV-14 and HAdV-50. This study, however, provided no data on children [2] . In Taiwan, China, a large community outbreak of HAdV in 2011 was shown to be predominantly associated with HAdV-3, although HAdV-7 began to show an increased circulation [10, 20] . Similarly, in some studies and outbreaks in which respiratory adenoviruses were identified and typed, in Guangzhou during 2010 to 2011, in Hangzhou during 2011 [21] and in Shaanxi [18] , the most common HAdV type was shown to be HAdV-3 [8] . The prevalence of HAdV and the circulating genotypes in pediatric respiratory infection have been investigated in two recent studies. In Lanzhou, from 2006 to 2009, HAdV infections represented 6.33 % of ARTI of viral etiology in children, and among all HAdV genotypes, HAdV-3 was most frequently detected, followed by HAdV-11 and other types [9] . Our previous study performed in Chongqing during 2009-2012 identified the emergence of HAdV-55 in pediatric patients with ARTI, but there was no comprehensive analysis of all HAdV genotypes in the local region [11] . In most of the abovementioned studies, no specific analysis was done of the epidemic and clinical features of HAdV in cases of pediatric pneumonia. HAdV coinfection with another respiratory virus was rarely determined, and differentiation of HAdV-associated clinical manifestations from other viral respiratory viral infection was not mentioned.",

These two genotypes alternate as the predominant cause of pediatric pneumonia. Although the seasonality of HAdV-related pneumonia is less distinct, the notable increase in circulation of HAdV-7 between 2010 and 2011 might represent an undetected outbreak in local children, which, however, might have been undiagnosed or misdiagnosed. A recent report of an HAdV-7-associated outbreak in a military camp in Shaanxi, China [23] , could likewise have been caused by the predominant circulation of HAdV-7 in the local area, as demonstrated in the current study. With the advent of HAdV-3 dominance since 2014 in Chongqing, we propose a high potential of outbreak events caused by HAdV-3 in the local area.",

In the United States and southern Ontario from 2004 to 2006, HAdV-3 accounted for 34.6 % of HAdV respiratory tract infection in civilians and 2.6 % among military trainees, while HAdV-7 accounted for only 5/581 (0.9 %) of clinical HAdV respiratory isolates in military facilities and 48/1653 (2.9 %) of isolates in civilian settings [5] and 0.7 % in Zagreb County [17] . By contrast, HAdV-7 has been a prominent cause of FRI in Asia. Especially in the current study, we observed a high proportion of HAdV-7 and HAdV-3 in pediatric pneumonia, which was similar to that in Beijing, China [3] . The predominant serotypes differ among different countries or regions, and they change over time [13] .
