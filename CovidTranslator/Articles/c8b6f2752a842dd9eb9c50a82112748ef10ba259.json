Recent studies show that spike (S) proteins of 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV may use the same host cell receptor called angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) for entering into host cells. The affinity between ACE2 and 2019-nCoV S is much higher than ACE2 binding to SARS-CoV S protein, explaining that why 2019-nCoV seems to be more readily transmitted from the human to human. Here, we reported that ACE2 can be significantly upregulated after infection of various viruses including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Basing on findings here, we propose that coronavirus infection can positively induce its cellular entry receptor to accelerate their replication and spread, thus drugs targeting ACE2 expression may be prepared for the future emerging infectious diseases caused by this cluster of viruses.",

ACE2 is the cellular entry receptor of SARS-CoV and 2019-nCoV, which plays an indispensable role for SARS-CoV infection (Li et al., 2003; Zhou et al., .

ACE2 is a type I membrane protein expressed in the lung, heart, kidney, and intestine . Enhanced expression of ACE2 accelerates SARS-CoV infection and spread, while silencing of ACE2 blocks its entry into cells (Li et al., 2003) . Organs and tissues with high ACE2 abundance like the lung, kidney and small intestine are the infection targets of 2019-nCoV . Taken together, these findings reveal that the expression level of ACE2 is extremely important for the successful infection of SARS-nCoV and 2019-nCoV. Here we analyzed the various microarray database of virus infected-or inflammatory stimulated-animals and cells, and clearly show that virus infection including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can obviously upregulate ACE2 expression, which suggests that 2019-nCoV may use similar strategies to augment its infection and spread.",

Thus, reducing ACE2 expression by siRNA or other drugs may be a direction for drug development. Because this cluster of viruses uses the same cellular receptor ACE for entering, thus preparation drugs which can reduce ACE2 expression may be useful for the future emerging infectious diseases. Our study also suggests that people infected by other viruses such as influenza or with high inflammatory cytokines may more susceptible to 2019-nCoV. This study also indicated that targeting the expression of ACE2 is a direction for drug development and infection control.

HEK293 cells were then collected for RNA isolation and RT-qPCR analysis at 9 hrs post-transfection. Results in each panel are representative of three independent experiments. VSV-eGFP infection induces ACE2 expression. HEK293 cells were cultured in six-well plates and infected with VSV-eGFP as indicated above. 6 hrs later, HEK293 cells were collected for RNA isolation and RT-qPCR analysis. Results in each panel are representative of three independent experiments. Overexpression of TBK1 or TRIF induces ACE2 expression. TBK1 is an essential activator of RNA-sensing pathway. HEK293 cells were cultured in 24-well plates. 24 hrs later, plasmids as shown above were transfected into HEK293 cells. 36 hrs after transfection, total RNA was isolation for subsequent RT-qPCR analysis. Results in each panel are representative of three independent experiments. ACE2 expression is upregulated in the lungs from SARS-CoV MA15 infected C57Bl/6 mouse. Intranasal instillation of 10 2 , 10 3 PFU of SARS-CoV MA15 in 50 \u00b5l of PBS or mock-infected with PBS alone, lungs were harvested 24 hrs later and total RNA was isolated and subjected to microarray analysis. ACE2 expression data was retrieved from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) microarray database (NCBI Accession: PRJNA149057; GEO: GSE33266). ACE2 expression is upregulated in primary human airway epithelial cells in response to wild type MERS-CoV (icMERS-CoV EMC2012). Human airway epithelial cells were infected with a multiplicity of infection of 5 PFU per cell. Infected samples were collected as indicated above. ACE2 expression data was retrieved from GEO microarray database (NCBI Accession: PRJNA391962; GEO: GSE100504). ACE2 expression is upregulated in human airway epithelial cells in response to rhinovirus infection. Primary epithelial cells from 4 donors were exposed to rhinovirus or medium only (used as control). 24 hrs post-infection, gene expression was assessed using Affymetrix U133 plus 2.0 human GeneChips. ACE2 expression data was retrieved from GEO microarray database (NCBI Accession: PRJNA137767; GEO: GSE27973). ACE2 expression is upregulated in human bronchial epithelial cells (HBECs) after IFN\u03b2 and H1N1 influenza stimulation. HBECs were treated with IFN\u03b2 (1000U/ml) or wild type H1N1 influenza (A/PR/8/34). Control samples were incubated with fresh medium under the same conditions. HBECs were harvested at indicated time points (0.25, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 18 hours post-treatment). Total RNA was extracted and analyzed using the Affymetrix High Throughput Array. ACE2 expression data was retrieved from GEO microarray database (NCBI Accession: PRJNA121751; GEO: GSE19392).",

When delivered into HEK293 cell, human ACE2 mRNA expression level is significantly enhanced by RT-qPCR study (Figure 1). poly (I:C) mimics virus RNA and activate immune signaling pathways which lead to interferons (IFN) and inflammatory cytokine production, so next we explored whether RNA virus infection can induce ACE2 expression. As an RNA virus, VSV-eGFP can slightly induce ACE2 mRNA upregulation in HEK293 cells (Figure 2).",

These results clearly reveal that ACE can be upregulated by infection of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Next, we evaluated ACE expression after other RNA virus infection. Data from microarray shows that the ACE2 mRNA level can also be strongly induced in human airway epithelial cells from 4 donors responses to rhinovirus (Figure 5) (Proud et al., 2012). In wild-type H1N1 influenza-infected human bronchial epithelial cells, ACE2 can dramatically increase to about 5-folds higher than the control group (Figure 7) (Shapira et al., 2009). These pieces of evidence indicate that ACE2 is a virus infection responsive gene and its expression can be stimulated by various viruses. Overall, ACE2 expression can be upregulated by virus infection.",
