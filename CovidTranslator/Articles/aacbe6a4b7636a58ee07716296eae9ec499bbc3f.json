Therapeutic interventions have not been evaluated in vivo, thus patient management relies exclusively on supportive care, which given the high case-fatality rate is not highly effective. The rhesus macaque is the only known disease model for MERS-CoV, developing an acute localized-towidespread pneumonia with transient clinical disease 2,3 that recapitulates mild-to-moderate human MERS-CoV cases 4,5 . The combination of interferon-\u03b12b and ribavirin was effective in reducing MERS-CoV replication in vitro 6 ; therefore, this strategy was initiated 8 h post-infection in the Users may view, print, copy, download and text and data-mine the content in such documents, for the purposes of academic research, subject always to the full Conditions of use:",

Moreover, treated animals showed reduced levels of systemic (serum) and local (lung) proinflammatory markers in addition to reduced viral genome copies, altered gene expression and less severe histopathological changes in the lungs. Taken together, these data suggest that treatment of MERS-CoV infected rhesus macaques with IFN-\u03b12b and ribavirin reduces virus replication, moderates the host response and improves clinical outcome. As these two drugs are already used in combination in the clinic, IFN-\u03b12b and ribavirin should be considered for management of MERS-CoV cases.",

Similar to SARS, infection can result in acute respiratory distress syndrome with multi-organ dysfunction 8 . The rapid identification of therapeutics for MERS-CoV is a high priority as there is currently no specific therapy or vaccine. A meta-analysis of data from the SARS outbreak concluded that at best the benefit of different treatment strategies 9-17 was inconclusive 18 . Recently, we have demonstrated in vitro that the antiviral effect of IFN-\u03b12b against MERS-CoV is augmented by the concomitant use of ribavirin and that when combined, effective concentrations were clinically achievable 6 . Here we evaluate the effectiveness in vivo of combination IFN-\u03b12b and ribavirin treatment, in an attempt to identify a therapeutic approach that can be immediately implemented in the clinic for MERS-CoV cases.",

The appearance of breathing abnormalities was supported by evidence of decreased oxygen saturation in untreated animals (2-5% decrease from baseline) (Fig. 1c) . Significantly increased white blood cell counts were noted in untreated animals on 1 dpi, returning to normal levels on subsequent days (Fig. 1d) . The increase in white blood cells was mainly attributed to a significant increase in neutrophils (Fig. 1e) . In contrast, treated animals did not show evidence of increased respiration, piloerection or decreased oxygen saturation levels, nor significant changes in hematology (Fig. 1d,e) . To monitor signs of pneumonia animals underwent daily x-rays. Radiographs from treated animals remained normal on 1 dpi and showed at most light infiltration in a single lobe on 2-3 dpi. In contrast, untreated animals showed evidence of increasing amounts of interstitial infiltration between 1 and 3 dpi ranging from localized (single lobe) to diffuse severe pulmonary interstitial infiltration throughout the lungs ( Fig. 2 ; Supplemental Table 2 ).",

In all of the tissues analyzed, with the exception of left middle lobe lung specimens, the viral loads were lower in specimens from treated versus untreated animals. When the values from all lung specimens were combined, the mean viral load in treated animals was 0.81-log lower than in untreated animals (p=0.0428, unpaired ttest, one tail), demonstrating a statistically significant reduction in virus replication throughout the lung (Fig. 3b , inset).",

This included type 1 and 3 IFN, pattern recognition receptors and interferon-induced with helicase C domain 1 (IFIH1, or MDA5), effector molecules and associated signal transducers.

By examining the 205 DEG identified using a more stringent p-value cutoff (p<0.01) ( Fig. 4b ; Supplemental Table 5 ) and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis we identified many genes that were down-regulated in untreated animals. Many of these were associated with hedgehog signaling (Fig. 4c) , a pathway involved in respiratory morphogenesis and vascularization [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] and potentially involved in inflammatory injury 26 . In treated animals, we observed up-regulation of sonic hedgehog (SHH) and subsequent down-regulation of genes associated with cell proliferation (Supplemental Table 5 ). SHH, the priming protein of the hedgehog pathway, and the associated molecule GLI family zinc finger 1 (GLI1) have been shown to block injurious responses in the pulmonary vasculature induced by multiple types of inflammatory and stress stimuli [27] [28] [29] [30] . Consistent with reduced inflammation, reduction in cellular infiltrates and the lack of perivasculitis in the lungs of treated animals, the upregulation of SHH suggests that the hedgehog pathway regulates the host response to protect the lung from potentially injurious inflammation.",

In addition, treated animals showed both reduced systemic and local levels of proinflammatory markers. Lung tissues collected on 3 dpi showed a significant reduction in viral genome copies, the absence of gross lesions and less severe histopathological changes in treated animals. Microarray analysis of the lung supported the success of treatment and identified the hedgehog signaling pathway as a putative contributor to decreased lung damage. These data suggest that treatment of MERS-CoV infected rhesus macaques with IFN-\u03b12b and ribavirin improves outcome of infection.",

The reduced disease severity in the rhesus macaque model, which appears to recapitulate mild-to-moderate human MERS-CoV cases, makes it difficult to extrapolate the outcome of this treatment in severe human cases. Thus, it is currently unknown whether initiation of treatment upon progression to severe respiratory illness would have any benefit, a situation faced in many acute infectious diseases. Additional therapeutics should be evaluated; however, given the severity and poor outcome of MERS-CoV infection, combined IFN-\u03b12b and ribavirin therapy should be considered as an early intervention therapy for MERS-CoV.",
