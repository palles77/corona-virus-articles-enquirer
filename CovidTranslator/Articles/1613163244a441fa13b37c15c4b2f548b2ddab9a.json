The present study aims to explore the effects of IPs for sex selection or sex selection drugs (SSDs) on pregnancy outcomes in rat models. SSDs contain Bryonia laciniosa, Quercus infectoria and Putranjiva roxburghii along with other ingredients. Methods: An experimental design with successfully mated female rats were randomized into control and treatment groups. Phase 1 had 2 interventional arms while phase 2 had 3 interventional arms (12 rats/ arm) besides control arm. In phase-1, pregnant females were dosed two SSDs(1000 mg/kg) on gestation days 1e5 whereas, in phase-2, on gestation days 6e19 to correlate the effect of the SSDs (500/1000/ 1500 mg/kg) consumption during different stages of pregnancy. Pregnant females were observed for clinical signs following treatment. The rats were sacrificed one day before expected day of delivery for evaluation. Pregnancy rate, gestation index, number of corpora lutea, and litter size were assessed. Foetuses were examined for sex, skeletal and soft tissue alterations. Discussion and conclusion: In phase 1, no appreciable findings were there with SSD exposure. In phase 2, intrauterine growth and survival of foetuses were affected when SSDs were administered during organogenesis period. Decreased number of live foetuses and increased incidence of early and late resorption, reduced fetal growth with significant alteration in skeleton and viscera were found in treatment groups in a dose-dependent manner. This correlates well with findings from observational studies in pregnant women. However, such treatment at any dose did not effect sex differentiation.",

            "text": "Traditional or indigenous preparations (IPs) are getting considerable attention in global health debates. 1 It continues to be used widely in several countries and its consumption is rapidly increasing. 2, 3 Many reports have documented the use of such preparations. For instance, in China, traditional herbal medicines played a critical role during the epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). 4 In fact, many drugs in modern medicine had their roots in the traditional system of medicine. Drugs like Penicillin (from Penicillium fungi) and Digoxin (from Digitalis purpurea) are some such examples. One of the promising therapies for Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infection is a ninth century treatment for eye infections which is a recipe consisting of garlic and onions, wine, and bile from a cow's stomach brewed in a brass cauldron. 5 It is however important to note that culture specific practices are not always safe. Digitalis is a classic example where herbalists use this plant in allopathic treatment strategies; while in some countries such as Britain, law restricts their vast availability. 6 A report from Australia describes the adverse effects of 'herbal' preparations or IPs. 7 Problems arise when people do not report about the consumption of such preparations assuming that these are devoid of any side effects by virtue of them being natural products. 3 The need for research in this field is huge and scientific research into the quality, safety, molecular effects and clinical efficacy is crucial. 3, 8 Pregnancy is considered a time of minimal intervention, and a period when herbal medicines are usually contraindicated. 9 It is reported that many women consume indigenous medicines (that contains Bryonia laciniosa, Quercus infectoria and Putranjiva roxburghii along with other ingredients) during early pregnancy to beget a male child in India. These preparations, often called sex selection drugs (SSD) contain herbal ingredients but these are off the label prescriptions and hence cannot be certified as 'herbal' medicines. The prevalence of consumption varies from 7% to as high as 46%. 10e13 Studies have indicated that there is 3.5e4 times higher risk of birth defects including major malformations of internal organs like urogenital and renal malformation, trachea-esophageal fistula, and visible defects like spina bifida, cleft lip/palate and imperforate anus. 12, 13 Risk of stillbirths also increases 2.5 folds. Studies suggest that a single exposure during pregnancy can be deleterious. 12, 14, 15 SSDs are reported to contain phytoestrogens, steroids and heavy metals. 12, 16, 17 It is also known that although placenta serves as a barrier, most drugs and environmental chemicals enter the foetal circulation by passive diffusion or active transport. 18 However, despite growing evidence on deleterious effects of these herbal formulations, few studies have attempted to systematically understand the risk of such preparations using animal models. Genetic sex of a child is determined at the time of conception by the fertilization of the ovum with X or Y sperms and intake of so called preparations for sex selection can never alter that.",

Due to resource constraints, we did not want to subject all the 18 samples for animal study. Hence, three samples of SSDs, found to be most rich in phenols and steroids were selected for toxicity study. 20 All the three samples were also tested for heavy metals which suggested that Lead and Mercury were in very high quantities. 17 The toxicity was examined using C. elegans, an alternate animal model. Survival analysis and reproductive toxicity was assessed from the brood size and progeny count assay. 21 The two SSDs that were found to be most toxic were selected as test items for the subsequent study in rat models. SSD 1 was reported to contain Shivlingi and Putrajeevak while SSD 2 contained Shivlingi, Majuphal, Putrajeevak, Nagkesar and feathers of peacock. Both the samples were obtained from grocers. Local preparations like these are bound to have certain degree of variability in concentrations but more often than not, these remain the major ingredients.",

Cage side observations for clinical signs of toxicity in the animals were recorded once daily until the day before necropsy. Body weight-Body weight of all experimental animals were recorded once before mating (initial body weight), and then after confirmation of mating. Body weights were recorded on days 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18 and on terminal day before sacrifice. These recorded body weights were used for calculating the dose/volume to be administered. Food consumption-Food consumption was evaluated once after successful mating or on day 0 of gestation (the day of vaginal plug formation or sperms observed in vaginal smear) and on days 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18 and one day prior to sacrifice. Calculated amount of feed were placed in the trough of each cage and the quantity of feed remaining after approximately 24 h were weighed and recorded. Morbidity/Mortality-All the animals were observed twice daily (once in the morning between 8.30 and 9.30 h and once in the evening between 16.00 and 17.00 h) for incidence of morbidity and/or mortality. Maternal examination related parameters-At the end of the observation period, all the dams were sequentially euthanized (by CO2 asphyxiation followed by cervical dislocation) and subjected to gross necropsy. After termination, dams were examined macroscopically for any structural abnormalities or pathological changes. Blinding was done while evaluation of the dams during caesarean section and subsequent foetal analyses to minimize bias. Pregnancy rate was calculated as the proportion of mated pairs that had produced at least one pregnancy within a fixed period where pregnancy was determined by the earliest available evidence that fertilization has occurred. Gestation index was calculated to indicate number of females with live born as a proportion of number of females with evidence of pregnancy. Examination of uterine contents-Immediately after termination, the uteri were removed and the pregnancy status of the animals ascertained. Gravid uteri including the cervix were weighed, and number of corpora lutea were determined. The uterine contents were examined for numbers of embryonic or foetal deaths and live foetuses. The degree of resorption was described in order to estimate the relative time of death of the conceptus. Any increase in the number of resorption and/or implantation loss is an indicator of litter size for the individual dam. Examination of foetuses-The sex and weight of each foetus were determined. Approximately one-half of each litter were prepared and examined for skeletal alterations from selected dams. The remainder were prepared and examined for soft tissue alterations, using accepted or appropriate serial sectioning methods or careful gross dissection techniques. Each foetus was examined for external alterations.",

These findings are different from our study probably because we used SSDs containing natural herbal and non-herbal ingredients unlike those studies where synthetic genistein was used. In both the studies, decreased body weight was observed indicating slight maternal toxicity. Food consumption was unaffected in our study which is contrary to what was reported. 23 In another study, pregnant rats exposed to oral isoflavones (diadzein and genistein in varying combinations) showed alterations in the number of live foetuses, lysed foetuses, number of resorption sites, and implantation sites while no clinical signs suggestive of maternal toxicity (seizures, tremors and salivation) that was observed similar to our study. Maternal mass gain was significantly reduced in rats treated with 100 mg/kg of isoflavones. 24 Ratio of females to males in the litter of different groups was similar akin to our finding. 24 These observations clearly nullify Table 2 Average gain in body weight of dams when exposed to SSDs during Gestational Days (GD) 6e19 in different experimental groups (n \u00bc 12 in each group) (in mean \u00b1 SE of means in gms). Difference in mean statistically significant as compared to the control (p < 0.05). the claim that consumption of SDDs could alter the sex of the growing foetus. An analysis done by the same authors earlier revealed that SSDs contain testosterone and steroids. 12, 16 The prenatal testosterone in pregnancy is known to affect sexual development adversely. 25e27 The principles of reproductive biology state that the genetic sex of an individual is determined at the time of conception and can never be altered under any circumstances. However, phenotypic sex of the growing foetus is likely to be influenced by the hormonal milieu of in utero environment. Our analysis was confined to phenotypic sex only and hence it is difficult to state if any differences existed with reference to genetic and phenotypic sex. This requires further inquiry. Evidence on the effects of SSDs on humans should best be obtained from human beings. The findings of the current study corroborate well with the evidence generated from observational studies in human beings. 13e15 Presence of skeletal and visceral malformations could explain why stillbirths are likely to be more in women who consume SSDs. The dosing of the test drugs was intended not only to examine the period of organogenesis solely but to assess effects from preimplantation, through the entire period of gestation to the day before caesarean section. The results were based on observations of more than 40 female animals with implantation sites at necropsy that added to its strength. Unnecessary handling of pregnant animals as well as any stressors from outside was avoided. At least three dose levels and a concurrent vehicle control were used with dams randomly allocated to different treatment groups that support the validity of the results. However, absence of 20 rats per group does not support it to be a fully OECD compliant study. We did follow the principles of Good Laboratory Practices (GLP) but due to constraints of resources the study could not be conducted as a GLP compliant study, though this is optimal for academic interests.",

Ingredients for herbal medicines are often drawn from different sources and are used in combination, which may exhibit variability in terms of species, growing conditions, and biologically active constituents. To isolate each active ingredient from each herb and then to establish its toxicity is time consuming, resource intensive and not practical. Moreover, drug approval process does not accommodate undifferentiated mixtures. 3 Though important, it surpasses the herb-herb interaction and the potentiating effect of one compound over another. Therefore, in our study, we administered the herbal mixture to assess the effects. Real time evaluations have yielded important observations for several herbal drugs especially related to pregnancy. For instance, Wang et al. (2014) used mice model to evaluate the adverse pregnancy outcomes after maternal exposure to the herbal medicines, particularly during early pregnancy. 28 The major events included maternal and perinatal mortality. Maternal weight gain, embryo growth and post-natal weight gain were significantly decreased. Moreover, foetal resorption and skeletal malformations were increased, signifying potential toxicity of Chinese herbal medicines. This is comparable to our findings.",
