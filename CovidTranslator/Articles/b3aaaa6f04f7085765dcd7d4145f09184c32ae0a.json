The number of under-five deaths worldwide has declined from 12.7 million in 1990 to 5.9 million in 2015 (http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs178/en/). Globally, approximately half of under-five deaths are due to infectious diseases. 1 Although numbers are substantially lower in industrialized nations including the United States, infectious causes remain among the top 10 causes of childhood mortality and cause significant morbidity (http://www.kidsdata.org/topic/659/childdeathrate-age-cause). Moreover, infectious diseases are continually emerging as new pathogens, as more virulent pathogens, and/or in new settings. In the past few years, the World Health Organization has noted the appearance of a Crimean Congo hemorrhagic fever, Ebola virus disease, Marburg virus, Lassa fever, Middle East respiratory syndrome, severe acute respiratory syndrome, coronavirus diseases, Nipah and Rift Valley fever (http://www.who.int/medicines/ebola-treatment/WHO-list-of-topemerging-diseases/en/). Over the past year, Zika virus has emerged as a major threat in the Americas, including the United States (https://www.cdc.gov/zika/ index.html).",
