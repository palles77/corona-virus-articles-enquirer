            "text": "The manufacture of vaccines is composed of several basic steps that result in the finished product. Table 5 .1 summarizes these steps with examples for pathogens that have a licensed vaccine. The first step is the generation of the antigen used to induce an immune response. This step includes the generation of the pathogen itself (for subsequent inactivation or isolation of a subunit) or generation of a recombinant protein derived from the pathogen. Vaccines under development use additional methods that will be discussed later. Viruses are grown in cells, which can be either primary cells, such as chicken fibroblasts (e.g., yellow fever vaccine), or continuous cell lines, such as MRC-5 (e.g., hepatitis A vaccine). Bacterial pathogens are grown in bioreactors using medium developed to optimize the yield of the antigen while maintaining its integrity. Recombinant proteins can be manufactured in bacteria, yeast, or cell culture. The viral and bacterial seed cultures and the cell lines used for viral production are carefully controlled, stored, characterized, and, often, protected. The first step in manufacture is the establishment of a \"master cell bank.\" This is a collection of vialed cells that form the starting material for all future production. It is extensively characterized for performance and the absence of any adventitious agents. From this bank, working cell banks are prepared that are used as the routine starting culture for production lots. The final vaccine is a direct function of its starting materials, and a change in this seed can be as complicated as initiating a new product development altogether.",

Live attenuated vaccines tend to be more susceptible than inactivated vaccines and toxoids. 1 Vaccines are formulated such that the potency at the end of shelf-life remains above the effective dose demonstrated in human clinical trials. As the product may degrade over the 2 to 3 years of shelf life, the release target potency may be significantly above the specified end-of-shelflife specification. This \"overformulation\" can represent a significant production yield loss and cost-of-goods increase for the final product in order to support the necessary lead times to deliver and store the vaccines, especially if they are used as a rotating stockpile to protect against supply interruption or an emergency use that does not materialize. The addition of stabilizers or lyophilization, when feasible, tends to improve the thermal resistance of vaccines. Storage at very low temperatures within the manufacturing supply chain may be used to reduce potency loss during storage.",

Manufacturers are required to assure that products under their control are maintained under appropriate conditions so that the identity, strength, quality, and purity of the products are not affected. 12 Currently, only a limited number of vaccines are required by federal regulation to have specified shipping temperatures. 10 Although most vaccine manufacturers use insulated containers and other precautions for the brief (usually 24 to 72 hours) shipping time, occasional, unanticipated temperature excursions may occur that could have a detrimental impact on the shipped product. Before accepting any vaccine shipment, users should look for any evidence of improper transportation conditions, including excessive transport time and possible adverse ambient temperature conditions. 1",

This vaccine is the primary method for preventing influenza and its more severe complications. 13 Typically, influenza vaccine contains two strains of influenza A viruses (H1N1 and H3N2) and a single influenza B virus. An additional strain of the influenza B virus was added, with the first four-antigen-containing-vaccine licensed in 2012. 14 The two type A viruses are identified by their subtypes of hemagglutinin and neuraminidase. The hemagglutinin and neuraminidase glycoproteins of influenza A virus comprise the major surface proteins and the principal immunizing antigens of the virus. These proteins are inserted into the viral envelopes as spike-line projections in a ratio of approximately 4 : 1. 15 The trivalent subunit vaccine is the predominant influenza vaccine used today. This vaccine is produced from viral strains that are identified early each year by the World Health Organization, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention The next step is to release the antigen from the substrate and isolate it from the bulk of the environment used in its growth. This can be isolation of free virus or of secreted proteins from cells or of cells containing the antigen from the spent medium. The next step is purification of the antigen. For vaccines that are composed of recombinant proteins, this step may involve many unit operations of column chromatography and ultrafiltration. For an inactivated viral vaccine, there may simply be inactivation of isolated virus with no further purification. The formulation of the vaccine is designed to maximize the stability of the vaccine while delivering it in a format that allows efficient distribution and preferred clinical delivery of the product. The formulated vaccine may include an adjuvant to enhance the immune response, stabilizers to prolong shelf life, and/or preservatives to allow multidose vials to be delivered.",

The HBsAg particles expressed by and purified from the yeast cells have been demonstrated to be equivalent to the HBsAg derived from the plasma of the blood of hepatitis B chronic carriers. 17, 19, 20 The recombinant S. cerevisiae cells expressing HBsAg are grown in stirred tank fermenters. The medium used in this process is a complex fermentation medium that consists of an extract of yeast, soy peptone, dextrose, amino acids, and mineral salts. In-process testing is conducted on the fermentation product to determine the percentage of host cells with the expression construct. 7 At the end of the fermentation process, the HBsAg is harvested by lysing the yeast cells.

VLPs have been produced for a wide range of taxonomically and structurally distinct viruses and have unique potential advantages in terms of safety and immunogenicity over previous approaches. 1 Attenuation or inactivation of the VLP is not required; this is particularly important as epitopes are commonly modified by inactivation treatments. 25 However, if a viral vector (e.g., baculovirus) is used as the expression system, inactivation may be required if the purification process cannot eliminate residual viral activity. For a VLP to be a realistic vaccine candidate, it needs to be produced in a safe expression system that is easy to scale up to large-scale production 1 and by an accompanying purification and inactivation process that will maintain native structure and immunogenicity and will meet the requirements of today's global regulatory authorities. A number of expression systems manufacture multimeric VLPs, including the baculovirus expression system (BVES) in Sf9 and High Five cells, Escherichia coli, Aspergillus niger, Chinese hamster ovary cells, human function liver cells, baby hamster kidney cells, transgenic plants (potato, tobacco, soybean), S. cerevisiae, Pichia pastoris, human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells, and lupin callus (a plant-cell production system) with yields ranging from 0.3 to 10 \u00b5g/mL or as high as 300 to 500 \u00b5g/mL with E. coli and HEK293 (purified). 2 The BVES has proven quite versatile, demonstrating the capability of preparing vaccine candidates for papillomavirus, feline calicivirus, hepatitis E virus, porcine parvovirus, chicken anemia virus, porcine circovirus, SV40 (simian virus 40), poliovirus, bluetongue virus, rotavirus, hepatitis C virus, HIV, simian immunodeficiency virus, feline immunodeficiency virus, Newcastle disease virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus, Hantaan virus, influenza A virus, and infectious bursal disease virus. 1 Many pathogenic viruses, such as influenza, HIV, and hepatitis C, are surrounded by an envelope, a membrane that consists of a lipid bilayer derived from the host cell, inserted with virus glycoprotein spikes. These proteins are targets of neutralizing antibodies and are essential components of a vaccine. Owing to inherent properties of the lipid envelope, assembly of VLPs in insect cells for these viral vaccines is a different type of technical challenge to those produced viruses with multiple capsids. 1 For these targets, production of VLPs is a challenging task because the synthesis and assembly of one or more recombinant proteins may be required. This is the case for VLPs of rotavirus, which is an RNA virus with capsids formed by 1860 monomers of four different proteins. In addition, the production of most VLPs requires the simultaneous expression and assembly of several recombinant proteins, which, in the case of RLP, needs to occur in a single host cell. 26 Purification of VLPs also constitutes a particularly challenging task. VLPs are structures of several nanometers in diameter and of molecular weights in the range of 10 6 Da. Also, for guaranteeing the quality of the product, it is not sufficient to demonstrate the absence of contaminant proteins; it is also necessary to show that proteins are correctly assembled into VLPs.",

The polymers used in single-use equipment may have different reactivity with the product (extractables and leachables), have been shown to shed particulate, and have shown a tendency to leak. Many of these concerns are being overcome in time through polymer engineering, and altering production techniques. Next, the ability to eliminate the high cost of cleaning and sterilizing equipment requires that the entire system be single-use. Many processes have not been able to make this conversion because of yield (low yield means high volume; volumes >2000 L are challenging because of weight and hydrostatic pressure), pressure (high O 2 demand, aeration volume, or flow rate), solvent use, and temperature control (heat transfer limitations). Chromatography also has been a challenging process in single-use systems, although there are promising advances and increasing options for prepacked columns. 29 With the promise and dynamic pace of advancement in single-use systems, manufacturers are faced with a plethora of options and a jigsaw puzzle of parts to connect effectively. As the industry is rather new, the standards necessary to allow interconnectivity of parts are still marginal but gaining attention. 31 Standards are in development for extractables and leachables, particulate classification and management, integrity, supplier evaluation, and interchangeability.

Today, a vast majority of supply of vaccines comes from a handful of developed countries because of the cost and complexity of the large-scale facilities and the profitability of those markets that support the significant manufacturing and clinical investment of public companies necessary to license and manufacture a vaccine. Once a large facility is built, duplicating it is a significant challenge as the complexity of the support systems essentially makes every facility unique. The advent of low-capital, single-use manufacturing platforms supports \"scale-out\" of processes built with \"off-the-shelf\" single-use systems, truly duplicating the original licensed process and minimizing the challenge of providing equivalence of the product from new facilities to the original facility. One can also imagine making clinical materials at modest scale and avoiding the challenge of scale-up for all markets, which could leverage addition of multiple single-use bioreactors instead of a large stainless system as demand grows.

By treating the HPV VLPs through a process of disassembly and reassembly, the stability and in vitro potency of the vaccine are enhanced significantly. In addition, the in vivo immunogenicity of the vaccine was also improved by as much as approximately 10-fold, as shown in mouse potency studies. 27 The disassembly and reassembly of particles may also be important to remove residual proteins from the expression system or host cells used in the production and is a serious processing challenge, particularly for enveloped VLPs.",

Existing polio vaccine manufacturing processes were developed years ago and use stainless steel fixed infrastructure manufacturing processes. Newer single-use technologies allow lower costs for initial facility design and could be used for polio vaccine manufacturing. An analysis by Lopes and colleagues shows that using newer facility design approaches that include single-use technologies can reduce bulk IPV costs by 40%, predominantly by reducing the capital costs of the facility. 36 Another approach to decreasing the cost is to increase the productivity of the manufacturing process.",

These viruses have shown lower yields in cell culture, but further work is being done to optimize their expression and purification yields. 39, 40 This work again is focusing on cell-line selection, optimization, and facility design.

            "text": "Given the complexities of developing vaccines for difficult targets like HIV, tuberculosis (TB), and malaria, a new tool has emerged that uses a \"prime-boost\" strategy for vaccination. The concept uses one vaccine as a prime, followed by the use of an entirely different vaccine for the boost. Most notably, an HIV vaccine efficacy trial in Thailand had a positive result using this approach. The Thai trial primed with a recombinant canarypox vector and followed with a recombinant gp120 protein boost. 41 Neither the canarypox nor the recombinant protein had shown efficacy on its own, but when combined gave a positive result in the trial. This approach has been used product available more broadly and more quickly after license through global partnerships and distribution of facilities nearer to the market they will serve. It is well aligned with the current developing policies of multiple emerging economies to be self-reliant for essential services like vaccine supply. For example, a 2009 agreement between GlaxoSmithKline and Brazil describes the sale of GlaxoSmithKline pneumococcal conjugate vaccine to Brazil for 8 years, with an agreement to transfer the manufacturing process to Brazil for potential use in future years. 32 The distributed manufacturing approach has many benefits including limiting global supply shortages from a catastrophic event at a single plant, the ability to customize a product for a region (e.g., strain of organism changing by region), and offsetting some of the cost of manufacturing (potentially paid by government) with tax-generating local jobs. There are some challenges to be considered. Maintaining alignment of the process among multiple facilities can be challenging in biological manufacturing processes. A process can \"drift\" in any single plant; having multiple manufacturing plants increases the chances that at least one plant will drift from the licensed, proven process. Likewise, control of raw material quality and source, single-use component supply, changes in supplier's materials in components, and similar unintended, unexpected consequences can leave a region without supply until the issue is identified and resolved. Single-use systems are ever improving; keeping the very specific needs of a process may be challenging with multiple small purchasers of the equipment versus a large central organization. Managing the regulatory files of a diverse production approach within a single company or across companies for a single product may also be difficult for regulators.",

The OPV is manufactured typically on a cell line with minimal purification postharvest. This combined with the relatively high productivity of doses/ liter of capacity results in a lower cost of manufacture. Because the risk of vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis (VAPP) is estimated at 0.42 per million 33 over a three-dose schedule, there is a planned transition to the Salk IPV as the polio comes closer to eradication.

In addition, the dose of a live viral vaccine is typically much lower than an inactivated one, also helping the productivity of the process. This is reflected in the pricing of these vaccines. UNICEF publishes the prices of vaccine procured, and in 2014 OPV in a 20-dose vial from the Serum Institute of India was $0.14/dose, whereas IPV from Bilthoven Biologicals/Serum Institute of India in a five-dose vial was $1.90/dose. 34 the vaccines cited for HIV, TB, and malaria use products from separate organizations.

For example, the HIV vaccines developed by the Vaccine Research Center at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) for HIV and tested for efficacy contained six plasmid DNA components in the prime, and five recombinant adenovirus vectors in the boost. 43 This requires the production of 10 separate active pharmaceutical ingredients, which must then be combined into two separate formulations and tested.
