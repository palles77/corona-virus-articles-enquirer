Bovine noroviruses (BoNoVs) and neboviruses were detected in 56 (33.5%) and 37 (22.1%) fecal samples, respectively. Sequences of the RdRp and capsid gene of selected BoNoVs showed that the GIII.1 and GIII.2 genotypes were in circulation in Turkey. Two of the BoNoV strains were identified as recombinant strains (GIII. P1/GIII.2). All examined neboviruses possessed a Nebraska-like RdRp gene. The two nebovirus strains were classified into lineage 4 based on phylogenetic analysis of VP1 amino acid sequences. One of them showed evidence of a recombination event within the S domain. This study is thus the first to reveal the presence of the BoNoV GIII.",

Recombination events in the norovirus genotype usually occur close to or within the ORF1/ ORF2 junction [13] . Molecular studies have revealed that the BoNoV recombinant types represent two RdRp/capsid combinations, GIII.P1/GIII.2 and GIII.P2/GIII.1 [13] . The first recombinant BoNoV strain, Bo/Thirsk10/00/UK, had a GIII.1-related RdRp but a GIII.2-related capsid [14] . Molecular investigations of isolates from various geographical regions have shown that most naturally occurring BoNoV recombinants share the same combination with Bo/Thirsk10/00/UK [12, 15] , whereas only one recombinant strain with a GIII.P2/GIII.1 combination has been described to date [13] . Recombination events can also occur in neboviruses. Indeed, two recombinant nebovirus strains (Bo/16TE/2010/ITA and Bo/LZB-1/17/CH) have been identified in recent studies [11, 16] .",

Purified PCR products were sequenced in both directions with the same primers used for amplification. Cognate sequences of reference BoNoVs and neboviruses representing different genotypes were retrieved from the GenBank database using the BLAST engine. Multiple sequence alignments were prepared by the MUSCLE algorithm as implemented in Aliview Software [23, 24] . MEGA 7.0 was used to build phylogenetic trees [25] , the statistical significance of which was estimated by bootstrap analysis (1000 replicates). Nucleotide (nt) and amino acid (aa) identity values were calculated in CLC Main Workbench (CLC Bio-QIAGEN, Aarhus, Denmark). Genetic recombination was analyzed using SimPlot software (version 3.5.1). All sequences (> 200 bp) detected in this study have been made available in the GenBank database under the following accession numbers: KX184721-KX184724; KX216596, KX216597; KX189067-KX189100.",

In this study, we identified BoNoV (33.5%) and nebovirus (22.1%) infections in diarrheic calves from 48 family farms and 11 commercial dairy cattle farms in 10 different provinces of Turkey. Surprisingly, BECs were detected on commercial dairy farms at a much higher rate than on family farms. This could be due to the large number of animals on commercial farms and/or routine vaccination against the other enteropathogens. Further epidemiological studies with BoNoVs were detected in diarrheic calves at a much higher rate than previously seen in Turkish reports (1.7-8.5%) [18] [19] [20] but at a similar rate to that reported in European countries and North America [9, 21, 26] . The prevalence rate of nebovirus was higher than the reported rates in Tunisia [27] , Brazil [28] , Italy [16] , France [9] , South Korea [29] and the United Kingdom [30] , while it was similar to prevalence rates (21.6-39.5%) reported in North America and Iran [21, 26, 31] . There has been only one other study on the prevalence of neboviruses (25.19%) in Turkey [20] , and the similarity in its reported prevalence rates to those seen here is noteworthy. The higher prevalence rate of BoNoV compared to that of nebovirus in this study was an expected observation, as other investigators previously reported this in Tunisia and France [9, 27] . The results show that BECs are prevalent in Turkey and have been recorded in various cases of diarrheic calves, being commonly detected alone or in combination with other agents such as BRVA, BCoV and Cryptosporidium spp. The detected prevalence of BECs demonstrates their importance in calf diarrhea in Turkey, as in other countries [9, 15, 26, 27] . Therefore, BECs should be included in the routine diagnostic procedure for calf diarrhea to reveal the real causative agent(s), to determine their contributions to clinical manifestations and to take precautions to prevent calf diarrhea in Turkey.",

They are the first recombinant BoNoV strains described in Turkey and were identified as GIII. P1/GIII.2, similar to other recombinant strains reported in Europe [14, 15] . These recombinant strains were detected on the same farm (farm no. 2, Aksaray) sampled from diarrheic calves in 2008. Fecal samples were collected from this farm in three different years (2006, 2008 and 2016) . BoNoVs were detected in each sampling year while genotypes GIII.2 were identified in 2006 and 2016, and GIII.1 and GIII.2 were identified in 2008. These results support the argument that the presence of different genotypes concurrently is an important factor in increasing recombination [12] . As in other studies [13, 15] , these findings indicate that genotyping based only on the RdRp sequence may not be sufficient for characterizing BoNoVs due to the existence of a preferential recombination site in the ORF1-ORF2 junction region. Thus, sequence analysis of the capsid gene seems to be necessary for precise characterization [13, 15] .",

This study also provides new genetic data for neboviruses in Turkey, which shows that they are genetically closely related to Bo/ Nebraska/80/US in the RdRp region and have a lineage 4 capsid type. Furthermore, this study is the first to report the presence of recombinant strains of BoNoVs and neboviruses in Turkey. Large-scale epidemiological studies would enhance our understanding of the genetic characteristics and evolution of BECs. Finally, considering their contribution to calf diarrhea, BECs might be incorporated into cattle vaccines in the future.",
