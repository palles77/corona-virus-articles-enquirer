            "text": "Glycyrrhiza glabra is one of the most important and well-known medicinal plants which produces various triterpene saponins such as glycyrrhizin. Beta-amyrin 11-oxidase (CYP88D6) plays a key role in engineering pathway of glycyrrhizin production and converts an intermediated beta-amyrin compound to glycyrrhizin. In this study, pBI121 GUS-9 :CYP88D6 construct was transferred to G. glabra using Agrobacterium rhizogene ATCC 15834. The quantitation of transgene was measured in putative transgenic hairy roots using qRT-PCR. The amount of glycyrrhizin production was measured by HPLC in transgenic hairy root lines. Gene expression analysis demonstrated that CYP88D6 was over-expressed only in one of transgenic hairy root lines and was reduced in two others. Beta-amyrin 24-hydroxylase (CYP93E6) was significantly expressed in one of the control hairy root lines. The amount of glycyrrhizin metabolite in over-expressed line was more than or similar to that of control hairy root lines. According to the obtained results, it would be recommended that multi-genes of glycyrrhizin biosynthetic pathway be transferred simultaneously to the hairy root in order to increase glycyrrhizin content.

            "text": "Licorice is a popular medicinal plant used in many fields such as flavorings, medicaments, and cosmetics [1] . Glycyrrhizin is the most important triterpene saponin in roots and stolons of Glycyrrhiza (licorice) plant and is a conjugate of two molecules of glucuronic acid and glycyrrhetinic acid aglycone [2] . Glycyrrhizin demonstrates a wide range of pharmacological, antibacterial, hepato-protective [3, 4] , antiulcer, anti-allergy [5] , and anticancer [6] [7] [8] activities as well as antiviral function against various DNA and RNA viruses [5] including HIV [9] and severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus [10] . Biosynthesis of triterpenoids in licorice starts with conversion of two molecules, namely farnesyl diphosphate (FDP) and squalene synthase enzyme (SQS) to squalene [11] . Then, oxidosqualene cyclases cause cyclization of 2,3-oxidosqualene to produce triterpenes and phytosterols [12] . Beta-amyrin synthase is one of the oxidosqualene cyclases, producing beta-amyrin which is responsible for biosynthesis of glycyrrhizin and soyasaponin triterpene saponins [13] . Oxidation of betaamyrin at C-11 and C-30 positions produces glycyrrhizin, whereas oxidation at C-22 and C-24 positions leads to the production of soyasaponins [14] [15] [16] . Cytochrome P450s play critical roles in oxidative reactions during biosynthesis of diverse natural plant products. Beta-amyrin 11-oxidase (CYP88D6) is a cytochrome P450 which catalyzes two sequential oxidation steps of beta-amyrin at the position of C-11 to yield 11-oxo-beta-amyrin. Beta-amyrin 24-hydroxylase (CYP93E) is another P450 that catalyzes oxidation reaction of beta-amyrin at C-24 position and is a key initial enzyme in biosynthetic pathway of soyasaponins [15] .",

            "text": "Hairy root cultures provide the potential for production of plant secondary metabolite and metabolic engineering by introducing or alteration the expression of specific metabolic pathway genes [17, 18] . These cultures possess genetic and biochemical stability, rapid growth rate, and high capability for synthesis of secondary metabolites at quantities comparable to the original plants [19] . A lot of researches have shown the increase in production of secondary metabolites using gene over-expression in transgenic hairy roots. The metabolic engineering approach increased production of flavonolignans through over-expressing petunia chalcone synthase (chsA) gene in hairy root cultures of Silybum marianum [20] . Over-expression of 7-O-acetyltransferase (SalAT) gene was employed as the target for metabolic engineering in Papaver bracteatum hairy root cultures, which led to the enhancement of morphinan alkaloid production [21] . There are a number of researches which have been successful in producing glycyrrhizin in G. glabra plant in cell and hairy root culture systems [22] [23] [24] . However, there is only one report on metabolic engineering of glycyrrhizin biosynthetic pathways in Glycyrrhiza plants, which uses gene transfer of squalene synthase 1 (SQS1) to enhance glycyrrhizin production in hairy root lines of Glycyrrhiza uralensis [11] . The cDNAs of CYP88D6 have been isolated and cloned from G. glabra [25] , which provided the possibility to improve the study of glycyrrhizin pathway via metabolic engineering of G. glabra hairy root cultures.",

Either 3-dayold seedlings or 3-week-old leaves were used as an explant for inoculation with A. rhizogenes containing the binary vector.

Some explants were inoculated with A. rhizogene devoid of binary vector which were served as controls. The inoculated explants were transferred to a solid MS medium containing 200 \u00b5M acetosyringone and were kept at 22 \u00b0C in darkness, during co-cultivation for 48 h [28] . In order to eliminate bacteria, the explants were washed in sterile distilled water and transferred to the fresh MS medium supplemented with 0.5 g/L cefotaxime. With emergence of hairy roots, they were selected on MS solid medium supplemented with 20 mg/L kanamycin. Then, 3-4 cm root pieces were transferred to MS liquid medium with 1% activated charcoal and were kept at 25 \u00b1 2 \u00b0C on a rotary shaker (110 rpm) in darkness. The transformation frequency in leaves and seedlings was determined using a percentage of the number of explants inducing hairy roots to the total number of explants inoculated with A. rhizogene.",

Due to the high release of phenolic compounds in liquid medium and its negative effects on the growth of roots, activated charcoal was used which had a favorable effect on root growth and also prevented browning of the tissue. Positive effects of activated charcoal on absorbance of toxic compounds including phenols have been previously reported in different plants [34] . Inoculation of plants with Agrobacterium rhizogenesis results in transfer, insertion, and expression of T-DNA from Ri plasmid in the plant genome, which leads to the expression of rolA, rolB, rolC, and rolD genes, as well as producing hairy roots in plants [35] . Another method for producing transgenic roots with A. rhizogenesis is the composite plant. The most important feature of this system is the reduced production time of transgenic root in plants. In addition to having hairy root culture properties, composite plant has other benefits such as the ability to grow in an ex vitro environment, which reduces the cost and time of production and simplifies the procedure [27] . Initially, the main reason for applying the composite plant method was to reduce the time of hairy roots production. On the other hand, the frequency of transgenic root production was 70% in composite plant method, whereas it was 20% in leaf explants. Plant transformation frequency differs significantly according to the source of the explant. The high frequency of hairy root production is related to tissue susceptibility and sensitivity to inoculation with A. rhizogenesis [36, 37] .",

CYP88D6 expression level showed a 6-12 fold induction in D1 transgenic hairy root line, and suppression in two other transgenic lines compared to control hairy roots (Fig. 6) . Depending on the integration position of T-DNA into the host genome, different hairy root lines are generated [41] . The differences between various transgenes and control hairy root lines occur as a result of the position effects of transgenes, which lead to differences in gene expression and secondary metabolite production. Following rolB and CYP88D6 integration, there are numerous effects on expression of the transgenes. The main reason for over-expression of CYP88D6 in D1 transgenic line Expression level of CYP88D6 gene. Three transgenic hairy root lines harboring pBI121 GUS-9 :CYP88D6 (D1, D2, and D3) and two control hairy roots without CYP88D6 transgene (HR1, HR2) using real-time PCR. Error bars represent standard error of the mean is the existence of constitutive and strong CaMV 35S promoter which results in high levels of transgene expression in hairy roots [42, 43] . The suppression of CYP88D6 expression in D2 and D3 transgenic lines compared to the control can be attributed to many factors such as position effect, gene copy number, gene rearrangement, physiological and epistasis effects, as well as methylation levels [44] . Probably, one of the main reasons for suppression of the gene in two transgenic lines is the existence of a similar copy of the CYP88D6 gene in genome of the hairy roots that resulted in co-suppression of internal and transgene copy of CYP88D6 gene. The CYP93E6 gene was expressed in HR1 line, but was not observed in other control and transgenic lines, which are related to the few amounts of transcript copies in these lines. CYP93E6 expression level showed a fourfold induction in HR1. This gene plays a role in the use of the common beta-amyrin precursor in competition with CYP88D6 gene. Different genes in the T-DNA region of Ri or binary vector are randomly integrated into genome of the hairy roots and alter the genetic content of the hosts, which can further exert a different regulatory effect on the genes involved in production pathway of secondary metabolites [41] . CYP93E6 was expressed in HR1, and the expression of CYP88D6 in this line was twofold more than that of HR2, which might be due to different genetic contents as a result of random integration of rol transgenes into the genome as well as host genetic alterations in HR1 and HR2.",

D2 and D3 transgenic lines, having a reduced expression pattern of CYP88D6 compared to the controls, also displayed lower glycyrrhizin production. D1 which had a significant increase in expression of CYP88D6, demonstrated higher glycyrrhizin content in comparison with HR2, but lower than HR1. Failure to increase the amount of glycyrrhizin following over-expression of CYP88D6 in D1 transgenic line compared to HR1 could be due to the lack of downstream gene expression, and hence protein down-regulation. It has been shown that when SQS1 isolated from Glycyrrhiza uralensis was transferred using Ri under CaMV 35S promoter to licorice, it produced three transgenic lines, two of which showed more glycyrrhizin content, and a lower production was observed in one of transgenic lines in comparison with control hairy root [11] . The putrescine N-methyltransferase (pmt) over-expression in hairy root of two Hyoscyamus species led to a higher level of hyoscyamine and total alkaloid content, but no linear relationship was showed between these metabolites. This could be attributed to the role of other genes contributing to the biosynthetic pathway of tropane alkaloids and consequently its complex regulation [45] .",

The present study is the first report regarding transfer of beta-amyrin 11-oxidase gene to G. glabra using hairy root system that is an alternative way to improve glycyrrhizin production. It seems that the pathway of glycyrrhizin production is very complicated and needs to examine the entire pathway in terms of the genes expression, enzymes activity, and the amount of intermediate metabolites production. Although the amount of glycyrrhizin increased in one of transgenic lines, in order to increase glycyrrhizin content in most of the lines, transfer of multi-genes of the biosynthetic pathway along with up-stream genes might be necessary so as to increase the primary precursor.
