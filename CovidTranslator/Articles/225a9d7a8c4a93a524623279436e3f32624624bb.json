It was the largest known outbreak of EVD in history, with over ABSTRACT 28 ,500 clinically compatible cases and 11,000 deaths reported in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. 1 The impact on the three most affected countries was immense and had the potential to undo important progress and efforts to rebuild following periods of conflict. Some neighbouring countries were also affected, and many countries outside Africa were required to diagnose and manage EVD cases for the first time.",

            "text": "The first World Health Organization (WHO) public announcement of the EVD outbreak was on 23 March 2014. 2 This announcement was shortly followed by a call to action from M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res, who announced their concerns regarding the lack of international response to the rapidly evolving outbreak. 3 It has since been widely acknowledged that the international response to this outbreak was too little, too late. 4 On 8 August 2014, the WHO declared the Ebola outbreak a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC). 5 The case fatality rate (CFR) for this epidemic was estimated to be between 31% and 74% in the three most affected countries in West Africa, with an average CFR of 48% for hospitalised patients; this is largely consistent with the range of CFRs reported for previous Ebola Zaire (EBOV) outbreaks. [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] Cases were also diagnosed in Senegal, Nigeria, Mali, USA, UK, Italy and Spain. Evacuated cases were treated in France, Italy, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Norway, Germany, the USA and the UK. Additionally, a more typical, smaller and unrelated EVD outbreak was confirmed in the Democratic Republic of Congo in August 2014. On 29 March 2016, the WHO declared that the PHEIC had ended. 12 In the three most affected countries in West Africa, sporadic cases remained a concern despite all countries having been declared free of human-to-human EVD transmission. Small hotspots of EVD continued to occur, with new cases reported as late as April 2016. The complex nature of this outbreak posed significant challenges moving forward, for these countries and for the wider public health community, given the possibility of sexual transmission involving survivors and repeated, small clusters of new cases. 1, 10 The UK played a prominent role in the international response, particularly in Sierra Leone. Critical reflection of the events that occurred before, during and after this outbreak are required at both national and international levels, and across all sectors involved in the response. Much of this lookback has been published or is underway. 13 This article aims to provide a factual account of the significant role UK academic, health service, military, commercial and public health professionals played both at home and abroad. It therefore serves as an uncritical piece from which healthcare professionals can consider their own role in the larger national and international responses of past and future epidemics.",

EBOV is one of four Ebolaviruses capable of causing disease in humans. 18 EVD is a recognised zoonosis, with fruit bat species the likely natural reservoir. The geographic coverage of EVD extends throughout Central Africa, but a large EVD outbreak was not anticipated on the West African coast although the region is very familiar with viral hemorrhagic fever outbreaks caused by the unrelated Lassa virus; only one previous case of Ebola had been reported. 19 Case numbers had never exceeded 500 before in an EVD outbreak and never before had EVD affected capital cities. Unexpected, but not unpredictable, the West African epidemic caught the national governments and the world off guard. Existing infection prevention and control (IPC) and treatment guidelines for viral haemorrhagic fevers existed, including for Lassa fever, but had limited application in local clinical settings. 20 A lack of equipment, consumables, staff numbers and training, and inadequate physical infrastructure hampered early control measures. Water, sanitation and hygiene projects were chronically underfunded. As in many outbreaks, nosocomial EBOV infections were prevalent. Local healthcare workers (HCW) suffered a dual burden of disease as they often cared for relatives or community members at home as well as being exposed in the workplace; HCWs had an overall fiftyfold higher rate of EVD compared with the general public during the epidemic. 21 The three most affected countries reported 876 confirmed infections and 509 deaths affecting HCWs. 1 While the infection rate among HCWs was high early in the epidemic, this fell as the epidemic progressed, likely due to improved understanding and implementation of hygiene practices and the availability and correct use of personal protective equipment, along with seeing fewer patients in non-clinical settings. 21, 22 ",

This was staffed and supported by waves of nursing, medical and operational staff from both the NHS and military. Royal engineers advised on the construction of DFID-funded and locally-run ETCs, and British troops helped with large scale, WHO-coordinated support to improve IPC measures, assisting in the training of over 4,000 local HCWs. 23 The Royal Navy ship RFA Argus provided logistical support and offshore treatment for non-EVD injuries, and further support was supplied through transport of medical equipment and supplies to the region.

In October 2014, the decision was made to institute screening for passengers returning from affected areas to the UK at ports of entry, including London Heathrow, London Gatwick, Birmingham and Manchester airports, and London St Pancras station, to offer an additional level of protection to the UK. The process involved a combination of medical assessment of returning passengers and the delivery of advice on what to do should returning passengers develop symptoms at a later date, as well as risk assessment for those returning to work as healthcare professionals. Local area teams were tasked to coordinate extensive tracing to reduce the risk of secondary transmission in the event of individuals having been exposed to known cases. The effectiveness of entry screening in the UK solely in detecting cases (at the point of entry) has been debated, aside from its potential role in information provision. 26 PHE scaled up its core laboratory services for EVD and increased testing capacity by introducing rapid molecular assays at four sites in the UK, in addition to the pre-existing national reference centre at Porton Down.

Following evacuation by the Royal Air Force, they received high-level care in the specialist isolation unit at the Royal Free Hospital (London), which included multidisciplinary input from medical, nursing, pharmacy, intensive care, physiotherapy and nutritional teams. Novel therapeutics were also administered, including monoclonal antibody cocktails (ZMapp, ZMab and MIL77). One UK patient also experienced rare, late recrudescence of disease, manifesting as acute ebolavirus meningoencephalitis; this was treated with an experimental small-molecule antiviral agent (GS-5734) and corticosteroids, and the patient recovered. 32 Individuals who met suspected case criteria underwent clinical assessment at NHS hospitals across the UK. Clinical algorithms and guidelines were made available by PHE to assist UK clinicians with safe assessment and management of suspected cases.

Although the availability of potential treatments was limited, pharmaceutical manufacturers also provided agents for compassionate use on a small scale, including patients treated in the UK. Vaccine developers, including the UK pharmaceutical company GlaxoSmithKline, formed collaborations with the US National Institutes of Health and other international partners to vaccinate at-risk HCWs in the region.

The aim should be to help life to return to a state of normality, while legacy-building and strengthening resilience by improving local capacity in affected and at-risk countries. Work continues in the three most affected countries to ensure robust preparedness for the detection, investigation and management of potential cases and the ability to mount an effective, rapid response if required. This work is being conducted alongside efforts to rebuild health and public health programmes and infrastructures to tackle the risk of other communicable and non-communicable diseases in already vulnerable populations. Surveillance systems need to be strengthened, with significant improvements in laboratory infrastructure from local to national level. It has been suggested that the mobilisation of transferable resources utilised for the Ebola outbreak could be used to minimise such a risk. 39 Domestically, the Science and Technology Committee raised concerns regarding structural weaknesses in relation to human resources and operational procedures for similar events in the future. This includes the UK's capacity to withstand operational disturbances resulting from global health emergencies, and also its ability to develop, assess and manufacture vaccines and medical countermeasures in response to a domestic outbreak. The committee suggested there be greater clarity in the government's global health policy and better-defined triggers for a domestic response to disease outbreaks and its capability for overseas deployment. 40 It was noted that some employers lacked the capacity to release staff who were willing to volunteer or manage their return to work. Some individuals were required to negotiate a leave of absence to volunteer in West Africa. It is recognised that this structural weakness needs to be addressed, for example through the continuation of UK-Med or the support of the WHO's Emerging Diseases Clinical Assessment and Response Network. 41 Appropriate measures for providing advice to returning travellers will aid roll-out of future services. A High Consequence Infectious Diseases programme was initiated by NHS England in 2014, in collaboration with PHE and the Department of Health. This programme, in part, is a response to lessons learned from EVD and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus incidents in the UK and elsewhere. Additionally, the UK government is funding a Public Health Rapid Support Team (UK PHRST), which will be a partnership between PHE and LSHTM, alongside academic partners King's College London and the University of Oxford. On request, the UK PHRST will support low and middle income countries in investigating a possible or known disease outbreak, with the aim of helping to control a threat before it becomes a national or international health emergency. 42 The courageous and selfless actions of UK volunteers, alongside the vast numbers of volunteers from the affected countries and other countries around the world, in assisting in the West Africa Ebola outbreak have been recognised and highly commended. 34 This acknowledges their contribution both to deployment overseas and also in the management of patients and public health preparedness and response efforts in the UK. By November 2014, over 1,000 NHS staff and 185 PHE staff had volunteered their services to the epidemic. The contribution of UK researchers also needs to be recognised. For example, the University of Oxford deployed an international field team of 40 doctors, nurses, pharmacists and scientists to conduct its clinical trials of potential treatments in EVD treatment centres; this was in addition to 14 local HCWs who received training in clinical trials and research staff who contributed from the UK. Significant and important EVD studies have also been conducted by researchers based in the UK, including phase I vaccine trials. Finally, through engaging with NGOs with an in-country presence, such as through KSLP or UK-Med's partnership with GOAL or Save The Children, both local and international leadership and development outcomes can be achieved alongside emergency response.",
