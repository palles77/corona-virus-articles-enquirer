To perform numerous functions within infected cells, the M protein needs to recruit cellular partners. To better understand the role of M during VSV replication, we looked for interacting partners by using the twohybrid system. The eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3, subunit i (eIF3i) was identified to be an M-binding partner, and this interaction was validated by GST pull-down and laser confocal assays. Through a mutagenesis analysis, we found that some mutants of M between amino acids 122 and 181 impaired but did not completely abolish the M-eIF3i interaction. Furthermore, the knockdown of eIF3i by RNA interference decreased viral replication and transcription in the early stages but led to increase in later stages. VSV transcription was increased at 4 h post-infection but was not changed at 8 and 12 h post-infection after the over-expression of eIF3i. Finally, we also demonstrated that VSV could inhibit the activity of Akt1 and that the knockdown of eIF3i inhibited the expression of the ISGs regulated by phospho-Akt1. These results indicated that eIF3i may affect VSV growth by regulating the host antiviral response in HeLa cells.",

It is caused by the vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and characterized by widely erosive vesicles on the surface of the lips, tongue, gums and teats (Letchworth et al., 1999) . Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) is a member of the Vesiculovirus genus, which belongs to the Rhabdoviridae family. The VSV genome is composed of a single negative polarity RNA strand that encodes five proteins: nucleocapsid (N), phosphoprotein (P), matrix (M) protein, glycoprotein (G) and large (L) viral polymerase (Barr et al., 2002) . The nucleocapsid (N) protein tightly binds to the viral genomic and nascent RNA. The polymerase L is an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) that associates with phosphoprotein (P), nucleocapsid (N) and genomic RNA to form the transcriptionally active nucleocapsid (Barr et al., 2002) . This complex is condensed by matrix protein (M) to generate a coiled helical structure and then enclosed within a lipid bilayer directed by the integral transmembrane glycoprotein (G) (Ge et al., 2010; Beilstein et al., 2015) .",

To perform numerous functions, viral proteins may need to interact with specific host proteins. A number of M-interacting cellular proteins have been identified that contribute to these various functions during viral infection. It has been demonstrated that host E3 ubiquitin ligase Nedd4 interacts with M protein to promote efficient virus egress (Harty et al., 2001) . In addition to facilitating virus egress, VSV M protein can deregulate nucleo-cytoplasmic transport to inhibit cellular gene expression by targeting Nup98 (von Kobbe et al., 2000) . Furthermore, M protein can also interact with dynamin and inhibit clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Disrupting the M-dynamin interaction blocks VSV assembly and budding and affects the cellular localization of the N and G proteins (Raux et al., 2010) . In addition, M protein has been shown to be associated with host factor-Rae1, and this complex serves as a T \"platform\" to recruit cellular proteins involved in host transcription (Rajani et al., 2012) . Thus, further exploration of the interaction of M with host cellular protein(s) is essential for understanding the roles of M in the replication and pathogenesis of VSV. In this study, we identified the host protein eIF3i as a novel M-interacting partner that regulates the growth of VSV.",

For example, the rabies virus (RV) M protein can inhibit eukaryotic translation via a protein interaction with eIF3 h (Komarova et al., 2007) . Furthermore, eIF3f can also interact with the S protein of SARS-CoV and infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) to inhibit expression of host genes (Xiao et al., 2008) . In addition to inhibiting host translation, eIF3f can inhibit HIV replication by specifically impeding the 3\u2032 end processing of HIV-1 mRNAs (Valente et al., 2009) . However, no studies have investigated the role of eIF3 complex in the VSV life cycle. Here, we demonstrated that VSV M protein interacts with eIF3i and that this interaction affects the growth of VSV.",

By using GST pull-down and laser confocal assays, the M-eIF3i interaction was validated. We also demonstrated that the globular domain of M was indispensable for the W. Pan et al. Veterinary Microbiology 212 (2017) 59-66 M-eIF3i interaction. Through a mutagenesis analysis, we found that some mutations in M between amino acids 122 and 181 impaired but did not completely abolish the M-eIF3i interaction. To investigate the role of the M-eif3i interaction in VSV propagation, we silenced the eIF3i gene by using siRNA. The results showed that silencing the eIF3i gene decreased the replication of VSV in the early stages but promoted transcription of VSV in the late stages. Over-expression of eIF3i promoted transcription of VSV in the early stages but had no effect on the transcription of VSV in the late stages. Many viruses have been reported to inhibit host translation by interacting with the eukaryotic translation initiation factor complex. Rabies virus (RV) matrix protein can interact with eIF3 h to inhibit the expression of cellular genes (Komarova et al., 2007) . In addition, the spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV and infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) can interact with eIF3f to inhibit host translation. This mechanism has been exploited by coronaviruses to counteract the host-antiviral response and to modulate coronavirus pathogenesis (Xiao et al., 2008) . Wataru Kamitani had reported that the nsp1 protein of SARS-Cov utilizes a twopronged strategy to inhibit translation of host proteins: nsp1 blocked the formation of 80S by binding to the 40S ribosomal subunit and facilitated the degradation of the 5\u2032-end of mRNA degradation, rendering the mRNA translationally inactive (Kamitani et al., 2009 ). However, many reports showed that VSV M did not inhibit host protein translation (Black et al., 1994; Connor and Lyles, 2005; Redondo et al., 2015) . However, Zackary demonstrated that VSV could inhibit the translation of mRNAs transfected prior to infection (Whitlow et al., 2008) . To further confirm whether M played a key role in inhibiting the translation of mRNAs during VSV infection, HeLa cells were transfected with in vitro transcribed luciferase and M mRNAs. Our result showed that M had no effect on inhibiting the translation of luciferase mRNAs transfected prior to the M mRNA. Thus, there might be some other viral components involved in the inhibition of host translation.",
