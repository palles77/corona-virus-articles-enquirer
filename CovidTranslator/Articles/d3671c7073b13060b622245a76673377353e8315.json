The primordial adhesion molecules of this family are the cell-cell adhesion molecules (C-CAMs), which have been found to be multifunctional, signal-regulatory proteins. C-CAMs inhibit tumor growth, interact with calmodulin, protein tyrosine kinases and protein tyrosine phosphatases, and are subject to specific dimerization reactions. These new insights indicate that C-CAMs are important regulators of cellular functions.",

Available data indicate that these molecules are multifunctional, but largely their biological roles have remained elusive. One of the documented properties for many of the CEA family proteins is cell adhesion, and recently results have emerged from several laboratories that demonstrate that some of these adhesion molecules have important functions in signal transduction. This review will focus on recent progress in the study of the role of CEArelated adhesion molecules, particularly the phylogenetically conserved cell-cell adhesion molecules (C-CAMs), as signal-regulatory proteins, and on the possible molecular mechanisms that are involved in signal transduction via CEA molecules. For background information and reference to earlier work, previous reviews [2--6] should be consulted.",

Two major subgroups, designated the CEA and the pregnant-specific glycoprotein (PSG) subgroups, exist [2] . The majority of the proteins in the CEA subgroup are cell surface bound, whereas the PSGs are secreted. Only the cell surface bound molecules of the CEA subgroup will be considered here. Unfortunately, the nomenclature of the CEA family is complex and confusing, and several of the molecules are known under many different names.

It has been reported that the cytoplasmic L domain is needed for C-CAM-mediated homophilic adhesion in insect Sf9 cells [31\u00b0,33]. However, both the L and the S forms of C-CAM can mediate adhesion in mammalian CHO cells [34, 35] ; in these cells there are indications that the S form may even be more effective than the L form (K WikstriSm, B 0brink, unpublished data). Thus, it seems as if the cellular background is essential for the manifestations of C-CAM adhesive activities, which may be a function of the supramolecular organization of C-CAM and its interactions with other molecules (see below).",

The GPI-linked molecules CEA and NCA are also found on apical surfaces and in the glycocalyx of colon epithelial cells [41] . Thus, in these locations the CEA-related molecules may have functions other than intercellular adhesion, although it is possible that they might mediate dynamic adhesive interactions between microvilli.

The C-CAMinduced ecto-ATPase activity in Sf9 cells was abrogated by mutation of Arg98, which is believed to be part of an ATPase consensus sequence [31\u00b0,42] . However, the agreement between the C-CAM sequence containing Arg98 and the ATPase consensus sequence is only partial. It seems more likely that this arginine residue affects the ATPase activity because of its essential role for the three-dimensional structure of the Ig domain, as discussed above. A truncation of the cytoplasmic L domain of C-CAM also destroyed the ATPase activity [31\u00b0]. Thus, both an intact amino-terminal V-type Ig domain and an intact cytoplasmic L domain seem to be required for ecto-ATPase activity in these cells. However, efforts in a number of laboratories have failed to confirm any ATPase activity of purified C-CAM, and it has been found that the bulk of the ATPase activity can be chromatographically separated from C-CAM ( [44] ; I Hunter, B 0brink, unpublished data). How could these apparently conflicting results be explained? There seem to be two possibilities: either the ecto-ATPase activity is not an intrinsic property of C-CAM, which instead might regulate the ATPase activity of another molecule; or the ATPase activity needs a particular C-CAM supramolecular organization, requiring both the amino-terminal Ig domain and the L domain, that is lost when C-CAM is solubilized from the membrane.",

Site-directed mutagenesis demonstrated that this activity required phosphorylation of Set503 and was regulated by phosphotylation of Tyr488; both of these amino acid residues are located in the cytoplasmic domain of C-CAM-L [43] . The transport activity was completely abrogated by truncation of the cytoplasmic domain. However, it is not easy to see how a single-pass membrane protein can act as a transmembrane, taurocholate-transporting molecule, unless specific oligomerization of C-CAM-L occurs. The ileal and hepatocyte sinusoidal bile acid transporters are muhipass membrane-spanning proteins [46, 47] . A possibility is that C-CAM may interact with a bile acid transporter and thus act as a tissue-specific regulator of bile acid transport.",

In one study it was demonstrated that transfection of mouse C-CAM-L (the Bgpla gene product) into mouse colon carcinoma cells inhibited tumor development in mice of the same genetic background as the carcinoma cells [61] . In another study it was found that transfection of rat C-CAMla-L into human prostate carcinoma cells caused inhibition of tumor development caused by injection of these cells into nude mice [62] . In the latter study it was furthermore demonstrated that transfection of an antisense construct decreased C-CAM expression in benign rat prostate cells In most tissues and cells there is a simultaneous expression of C-CAM-L and C-CAM-S [66] , and regulation of the L:S ratios as a means of regulating signal transduction by C-CAM is an intriguing possibility. Support for this idea comes from the finding that the expression levels of the two isoforms can indeed be regulated independently of each other in an epithelial rat cell line, NBT-II [67] . In these cells fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-I (acidic FGF) selectively upregulates the expression of C-CAM-L, and this is correlated with an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition.",

The membraneproximal tyrosine residue (Tyr488 in rat) has been found to be phosphorylated by the insulin receptor kinase in hepatocytes [68] , by c-src in epithelial cells [69] , and by c-src [69] and lyn and hck [70] in granuiocytes. Convincing data about phosphorylation of the membrane-distal tyrosine (Tyr513 in rat) are lacking. These two tyrosine residues are part of a modified ITAM (immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif), although the similarity is imperfect, as the spacing between the two tyrosines (24-26 amino acids) is greater than the spacing of 10 amino acids found in classic ITAMs [71\u00b0]. However, the proximal tyrosine is part of a perfect ITIM (immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motif) [72] . ITAMs and ITIMs are present in a number of membrane receptors, such as T-cell receptor complexes, B-cell receptor complexes, FcTRIIB, CD22, interleukin receptors, and natural killer cell inhibitory receptors (KIRs) [72,73\u00b0] . Upon phosphorylation ITAMs and ITIMs bind protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs) and protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs), respectively, whose actions lead to stimulation or termination of signaling with profound effects on cellular proliferation. Interestingly, different splice variants of KIRs having short or long cytoplasmic domains occur [73\u00b0]; the spacing between the two tyrosine residues in the long KIR cytoplasmic domain is 29 amino acids, which is similar to that found in the long cytoplasmic domain of C-CAMs.",

C-CAM-L is also able to bind the PTP SHP-2, and tyrosine-phosphorylated C-CAM-L is a substrate for both SHP-1 and SHP-2 (N Beauchemin, M Huber, personal communication).

This effect depends on the presence of extracellular calcium ions and involves transient tyrosine phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic domain of C-CAM-L [58\u00b0]. Antibodies against all four CEA-related molecules can trigger respiratory burst and 132-integrin-mediated adhesion, but there is evidence that the stimulatory effect mediated by CGM6 and NCA requires cooperation with C-CAM [57\u00b0]. This is supported by the finding that C-CAM can form complexes with CGM6 and NCA, but not with CGM1, in granulocytes (B Singer, personal communication), and by the demonstration of activation-dependent, conformation-specific epitopes in granulocyte C-CAM[59]. Thus, the signaling effects in granulocytes may require a cytoplasmic domain, such as those carried by C-CAM-L and CGM1.Perhaps the most spectacular demonstration of CEArelated molecules as important regulators of signal transduction comes from the recent findings that the transmembrane C-CAMs can inhibit growth of malignant tumors. The first indication that C-CAM may be important for tumor development was the observation that rat transplantable hepatocellular carcinomas expressed either no C-CAM or only low amounts of chemically altered C-CAM[20]. Recently, downregulation of C-CAM expression has also been reported during, prostate carcinogenesis [26], in colorectal carcinomas in mice [23] and man[22], and in human hepatocellular carcinomas[27], but the picture is complex as significant C-CAM expression has been demonstrated in other neoplasms[21,25]. However, none of these reports has presented any quantitative analyses of the expression patterns of the various C-CAM isoforms. Recent observations indicate that co-expression of C-CAM-L and C-CAM-S, and the ratios of these two isoforms, are crucial for regulation of the functional activities of C-CAM [60\u00b0\u00b0].",

In a preclinical study it was demonstrated that delivery of rat C-CAM-L, by means of an adenovirus vector, to tumor-carrying animals also prevented tumor growth[65]. Efforts are now being made to develop C-CAM-based clinical treatment of cancer, but clearly much work remains to be done to clarify the basic mechanisms of the tumor-inhibitory effects of C-CAM.That the tumor-inhibiting effect depends on the cytoplasmic domain of C-CAM-L was further substantiated by deletion of this domain; deletion abrogated the tumor growth inhibitory effect [64\u00b0]. However, the tumorinhibitory effect is not a simple function of expression of C-CAM-L; upon increasing the expression of C-CAM-L above physiological levels, the tumor inhibitory effect disappeared [60\u00b0\u00b0]. Thus, there seems to be a window of C-CAM-L expression levels in which its inhibitory effects become visible. Interestingly, the settings of this window seem to be regulated by the expression of C-CAM-S [60\u00b0\u00b0]. Upon simultaneous expression of C-CAM-L and C-CAM-S the tumor-inhibitory effect was observed also at much higher expression levels. This was dependent on the ratio of the expression levels of C-CAM-L to C-CAM-S. At L:S levels of <1.3 tumor inhibition occurred, even at very high total expression levels of C-CAM. At higher L : S ratios, there was no tumor inhibition, at either high or moderate total C-CAM expression levels. Thus, the ratio of the expression levels of the L and S isoforms is critical for regulating the tumor-inhibitory effect of C-CAM-L.",

The amino acid sequences of the cytoplasmic domains of mouse, rat and human C-CAM-L are highly homologous. The numbers to the left and to the right of the sequences indicate amino acid positions in the intact proteins. The consensus sequences of ITAMs and ITIMs are shown at the top, with critical amino acids shown in large bold type, and the corresponding critical amino acid residues in the C-CAM sequences are also indicated by large, bold letters. The [TAM consensus sequence contains two tyrosine residues with a spacing of 10 amino acids between them. Note that the distance between the two tyrosines in the C-CAM sequences is larger than that of the ITAM consensus sequence. However, the most amino-terminal of the two tyrosines in C-CAM is part of a perfect ITIM consensus sequence in all three organisms. Binding sites for calmodulin are underlined. The single-letter amino acid code is used, where X represents any amino acid. Dashes indicate where gaps were introduced to maximize alignment of the C-CAM-L sequences. As rat C-CAM-L is shorter, Tyr513 in rat corresponds to Tyr515 in mouse and Tyr516 in man.",

In addition, both C-CAM isoforms can mediate cell adhesion by reciprocal binding between the amino-terminal Ig domains of opposing C-CAM molecules on adjacent membranes (left). As illustrated, it has been demonstrated that monomeric C-CAM can mediate cell adhesion, but it is not known whether dimeric C-CAM mediates adhesion or not. (b) Both C-CAM-L and C-CAM-S can bind calmodulin (CAM) in a Ca2+-dependent manner. Increase of the calcium concentration leads to calmodulin binding to C-CAM; this binding causes dissociation of C-CAM dimers. Calmodulin can be recycled when the calcium concentration decreases. (c) The cytoplasmic domain of C-CAM-L can be tyrosine phosphorylated by src-family kinases and by the insulin receptor kinase (not shown). This can lead to binding both of src-family kinases (e.g. c-src), which contain one SH2 domain (a tyrosine-phosphate-binding domain) per molecule, and of the protein tyrosine phosphatases SHP-1 and SHP-2, which contain two SH2 domains per molecule. The binding modes that are illustrated hera are speculative; it is not known whether it is monomeric or dimeric C-CAM-L, or both, that binds the kinases and phosphatases.

C-CAMs and other signal-regulatory proteins C-CAMs and some of the other CEA-related adhesion molecules constitute a family of signaling and signalregulating proteins that affect growth and other cellular activities. It is thus of particular interest to compare them with another family of signal-regulatory proteins (SIRPs) that has been identified quite recently [76\"',77\u00b0'].",
