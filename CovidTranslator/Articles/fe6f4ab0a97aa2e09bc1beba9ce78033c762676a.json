As a result, it is more realistic to study the spatial pattern of epidemic models with space and time. In this paper, spatial dynamics of an epidemic model with nonlinear incidence rate is investigated. We find that there are different types of stationary patterns by amplitude equations and numerical simulations. The obtained results may well explain the distribution of disease observed in the real world and provide some insights on disease control.",

The black death (bubonic plague) ravaged Europe four times in history. The first time was in 600 AD, and about half of Europe's people had been killed at that time; the second outbreak was in 1346-1350 AD, and it lead to reduce the Europe population by one-third; the third occurred from 1665 to 1666, and 1/6 of the population in London died; the last time was from 1720 to T. Wang (B) Department of Mathematics, Shihezi University, Shihezi 83200, Xinjiang, People's Republic of China e-mail:wtshzdx@sina.com 1722, and it caused half of the population in Marseilles in France. After entering the 21st century, we still face the threat from infectious diseases. After Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) was found in Guang Dong province of China in November, 2002, it spreads in 32 countries and regions, more than eight thousand cases who got the disease and more than eight hundred people died in just a few months [4] . In 2009, H1N1 influenza virus caused a global outbreak and at least 11,516 deaths [5, 6] . In February 2013, there appears a new type of avian influenza named H7N9 in China, and there has been 128 confirmed human cases reported by China's Ministry of Health, among 27 died [7, 8] . Therefore, understanding the rule of infectious diseases transmission rule and providing control strategy is becoming world's significant problems which need to be solved urgently.",

The numerical simulations will reach a stationary state or stop until they show a behavior that does not seem to change its characteristics anymore. In this paper, we want to know the distribution of the infected population (I ), so we only analyze the form of the pattern I . Figure 2 shows spatial pattern of infected population at 0, 10,000, 50,000, and 1,00,000 iterations in Turing space, and initial conditions are (S * , I * ) with tiny disturbance. In that case, we obtain that \u03be 3 < \u03be < \u03be 4 with \u03b2 = 16, which means coexistence of spotted and stripe patterns will appear in the two-dimensional space.",

In Fig. 3 , we show the spatial pattern of infected population at 0, 10,000, 50,000, and 1,00,000 iterations. At the initial time, the infected population shows patched distribu-tion. As time is large enough, stripe pattern appears, and the dynamics does not change anymore. Figure 4 shows the evolution of the spatial pattern of infected population at 0, 5,000, 20,000, and 1,00,000 iterations, with small random perturbation of the stationary solution of the spatially homogeneous systems (3). In the parameter set, A = 1, d = 1, \u03bc = 1, d 1 = 6, d 2 = 1, and \u03b2 = 19.8, we find that \u03be > \u03be 1 , which implies that spotted pattern will emerge. Under this situation, one can see that random initial distribution of the model leads to a highly irregular and very short pattern in the region. After the irregular pattern formation, spatial patterns go by a slow change, finally form regular spotted patterns, and fill up the whole space. Our theoretical results are confirmed by means of the numerical results.",

In other words, the increase of \u03b2 related to pattern selection, whether it is a stripe pattern or spotted pattern. However, we ignore many factors in the model (3) . For example, we do not take into account migration of individuals, the recovery of the infected populations and so on [23] [24] [25] . We need to investigate the pattern dynamics of epidemic models with these factors in the future work. It should be noted that we just investigated Turing instability of system (3) . Other instability (such as Benjamin-Feir instability) may be found in this system. Moreover, we can extend our results in more complex spatial epidemic models like SIR, SIRS, or SEIRS models.",
