            "text": "Kimchi, a traditional fermented vegetable, is an indispensable component of every meal in Korea [1] . There are about 187 kinds of Kimchi according to the ingredients and processing methods [2] . Kimchi is prepared by various ingredients, such as Chinese cabbage, garlic, onion, and red pepper in the presence of salt [3] . Kimchi is currently recognized worldwide as a nutritious and healthy food. Nutritionally, Kimchi is a low-calorie food (18 kcal/100 g) and an important source of vitamins, minerals, and fiber [4] . It is also a good source of phytochemicals (e.g., \u03b2-sitosterol, glucosinolates, isothiocyanate, indoles, allyl compounds) and probiotic strains (e.g., Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus brevis, Leuconostoc mesenteroides) [5, 6] . In regard to these nutrition properties, many functional properties of Kimchi have been reported including anti-oxidative activity [7, 8] , anti-mutagenic and anti-tumor activities [9] , antihttp://e-cnr.org atherogenic activity [10] , and weight-controlling activity [11] .",

Our findings indicated that there is no clear effect of Kimch intake on immune parameters, which is somewhat surprising. Because previous reports have suggested that various Kimchi ingredients (cabbage, garlic, onion, red pepper, and ginger) or probiotic strains improve immune markers both in vivo and in vitro studies, we hypothesized that fermented Kimchi exerts immunomodulatory effects. Chinese cabbage, a main ingredient of Kimchi, is rich in minerals, vitamin C, dietary fibers, and especially phytochemicals [16] . Also, cabbage contains several organic sulfur compounds (OSCs), such as isothiocyanates and dithiolethiones. In a previous study [17] , these OSCs were shown to exert diverse biological effects including the inhibition of tumor cell proliferation, antimicrobial effects, and free radical scavenging. Another ingredient, garlic, contains various sulfur-contained compounds; S-allyl-l-cysteine, S-allyl-l-cysteine sulfoxides and alliin [18] . It suppress the production of inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-a, IL-1, IL-6, and interferon-\u03b3 [19] . Red pepper contains high levels (25-80 mg%) of capsaicin. Capsaicin (8-methyl-Nvanillyl-6-nonenamide) is involved in physiological functions related to immune response [20] .",

Orally ingested probiotic bacteria are able to modulate the immune system; however, differences exist in the immunomodulatory effects of different probiotic strains [21] . Especially, lactic acid bacteria (LAB) produced during the fermentation process [24, 25] . Also, lactobacillus plantarum isolated from Kimchi increased the production of Ig A in normal or S180-bearing BALB/C tumor-induced mouse [26, 14] . On the other hand, 4 weeks of Kimchi supplementation does not changes of Ig A, G, M. Cytokines, protein mediators produced by immune cells, are involved in immune regulation. The levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines are increased in chronic inflammatory diseases while the levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines are decreased. Kim et al. [11] showed that the consumption of fermented Kimchi (300 g/day for 4 weeks) had no effects on the levels of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 in overweight and obese patients (22 subjects, mean age of 38.6 \u00b1 8.5 years). In our study, the levels of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 were significantly decreased in the Kimchi and non-Kimchi groups. It is unclear why the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the non-Kimchi group were decreased.",

The strength of this study is that the effects of the Kimchi supplementation on blood immune parameters are examined. These study results are useful information in further research of the patients with dysregulated immune responses. On the other hand, small sample size and short duration may limit the power in detecting differences between groups. Further studies examining a various subjects with unbalanced immune system, larger samples for longer periods are necessary to determine the immune-modulation of fermented Kimchi. In addition, the decreased levels of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 in placebo group may be due to the use of radish. Because nutritional intakes of the Kimchi and non-Kimchi groups during the 4 weeks of intervention were similar in this study, more research is need to interpret changes observed in the control group.",
