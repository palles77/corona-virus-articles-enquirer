Phylogenetic analysis suggests that SARS-CoV-2 is a new human-infecting betacoronavirus, closely similar to bat coronaviruses, suggesting that bats might have been the original host of this virus (7) . There are no antiviral drugs of proven efficacy or applicable vaccines. Supportive therapy is the main method for the management of symptomatic patients, many of whom require mechanical ventilation and other intensive care services. There is limited information regarding the epidemiology of COVID-19 in maintenance hemodialysis (MHD) patients. MHD patients may be at increased risk of COVID-19 because of many comorbid conditions (8) . In this report we describe our experience with five MHD patients who developed COVID-19 disease at Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University.",

Characteristics of the five patients are presented in Table 1 . The age range of patients was 47 to 67 years and two of five patients were female.

All patients presented with lymphopenia, and the most common chest radiograph abnormality was ground glass opacity, which bears some resemblance to previous reports (9) . Of note the prevalence of 2.5% may underestimate the actual prevalence of infected patients. Screening of all MHD patients began after the first patient was identified on Feb. 9, and screening consisted of a chest CT; rRT-PCR testing was only performed in those with an abnormal CT. In addition all patients had temperature measured prior to dialysis and those patients who had temperature exceeding 37.3 C or with respiratory symptoms had a chest CT \u2079 and, if abnormal, testing for rRT-PCR. Therefore, some patients may have developed COVID-19 prior to screening and patients without an abnormal CT at the time of screening would have been missed, although no symptomatic patients were identified prior to Feb. 9.",
