Among approximately 400,000 infants followed nationally, the incidence rates of early-onset sepsis (EOS) infection within 3 days of life were 0.98 cases per 1000 live births. 1 More than two-thirds of the frequently isolated organisms were associated with group B streptococcus (GBS) (43%) and Escherichia coli (29%). Although 20% of the term infants were treated in the newborn nursery, 77% of the infected infants required intensive care management. Of those who survived beyond 3 days of life, about 21% had an episode of late-onset sepsis (LOS) infection after 3 days of life. The overall mortality rate of infected infants was 16%.",

The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) Committee on Fetus and Newborn 7 has published a clinical report extensively discussing clinically relevant challenges: identifying newborns with signs of sepsis with high likelihood of EOS requiring antimicrobial regimen and identifying healthy-appearing newborns with high likelihood of EOS requiring antimicrobial regimen. The committee concluded that, although these guidelines are evidencebased, they may be modified by the clinical judgment of the provider. The primary reason is that the clinical presentation of neonatal infection may be subtle and nonspecific, and may overlap with noninfectious causes. 7, 8 Many clinicians empirically start broad spectrum antimicrobial regimen for infants considered at risk for sepsis but antibiotics are occasionally continued despite a negative blood culture. This practice may be detrimental to the infant 8 because it increases the risk of invasive fungal infections, 9 necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), or death, 10, 11 which increases the pressure for selecting multidrug-resistant organisms 12 and even the risk of LOS. 11 The purpose of this article is to provide evidence-based practical approaches to the diagnosis, management, and prevention of neonatal infections.",

Hypotension may be more frequently found in infants with sepsis, whereas irritability, convulsions, and bulging or full fontanel is found in those with meningitis. However, they cautioned that absence of any of the aforementioned signs do not exclude central nervous system involvement.

Procalcitonin released from tissues increases with infection at around 2 hours and peaks at 12 hours. 7 It may also increase with noninfectious causes such as in respiratory distress syndrome and a physiologic increase during the first 24 hours of birth. 7 PCT may not be readily available and the turnaround time varies in different institutions from 20 minutes to 5 hours. 24 CRP increases around 6 hours associated with an inflammatory response with release of interleukin-6 and peaks at 24 hours. 7 CRP has been used in the algorithm-based guideline from the AAP Committee on Fetus and Newborn for the evaluation of asymptomatic term and preterm infants with a risk factor for sepsis. 7 It is best used as part of a group of diagnostic tests 2 together with blood culture and white blood cell with differential in the evaluation of neonatal infection. 7 However, there is not enough medical evidence at this time to recommend serial determinations of CRP in guiding duration of antimicrobial therapy in infants. 7, 24 Further studies are needed to evaluate the usefulness of sequential determination of CRP and biomarkers for an antimicrobial stewardship program (ASP) in the NICU setting.",

This is called cocooning 54 and prevents vaccine-preventable diseases, such as pertussis and influenza, in young infants.

            "text": "Neonatal infections continue to cause morbidity and mortality in infants. GBS and E coli are the most common agents of EOS, whereas coagulase-negative Staphylococcus is the predominant cause for LOS. There is increasing recognition of respiratory viral infections contributing to ruling out sepsis in very young infants whose presentations are similar to bacterial infections. Blood culture at birth and white blood cell with or without CRP has been used in the algorithm-based guideline for the evaluation of asymptomatic term and preterm infants with risk factors for sepsis. Ampicillin and gentamicin remains the cornerstone of initial antimicrobial regimen for neonatal infections. Third-generation cephalosporins should be used judiciously. The use of antiviral (acyclovir, ganciclovir, valganciclovir, and oseltamivir) and antifungal (fluconazole, amphotericin B, and voriconazole) treatment and prophylactic regimens may reduce mortality and morbidity to specific viral and fungal disease in infants. There are various strategies, such as GBS prophylaxis, hand hygiene, immunization, and immunoprophylaxis, ASP, probiotics, and prebiotics, and NICU care bundles, which may be used in preventing infections in infants.",

For aspergillosis, voriconazole (loading dose 18 mg/kg/d divided every 12 hours on day 1, then 16 mg/kg/d on day 2) is the drug of choice. Local debridement may be needed for cutaneous aspergillosis.
