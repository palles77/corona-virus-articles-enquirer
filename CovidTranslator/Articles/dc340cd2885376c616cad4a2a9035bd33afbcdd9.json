Accordingly, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which breaks-down Ang II and forms Ang-(1-7), has been suggested as a target against atherosclerosis. Here we investigated the actions of diminazene, a recently developed ACE2 activator compound, in a model of vulnerable atherosclerotic plaque. Atherosclerotic plaque formation was induced in the carotid artery of ApoE-deficient mice by a shear stress (SS) modifier device. The animals were treated with diminazene (15 mg/Kg/day) or vehicle.",

Diminazene treatment did not change the lesion size, but ameliorated the composition of aortic root and low SS-induced carotid plaques by increasing collagen content and decreasing both MMP-9 expression and macrophage infiltration. Interestingly, these beneficial effects were not observed in the oscillatory SS-induced plaque. Additionally, diminazene treatment decreased intraplaque ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 expression, circulating cytokine and chemokine levels and serum triglycerides. In summary, ACE2 was distinctively expressed in atherosclerotic plaques, which depends on the local pattern of shear stress. Moreover, diminazene treatment enhances the stability of atherosclerotic plaques.",

Animals at 15-20 weeks received western-type diet consisting of 15% (wt/wt) cocoa butter and 0.25% (wt/wt) cholesterol (Diet W; abDiets) for the entire 11 week experimental period. After 2 weeks of adaptation to the western-type diet, specific patterns of shear stress were applied to the right carotid artery by the surgical placement of a shear stress modifier device called \"cast\". The cast consists of 2 longitudinal halves of a cylinder with a cone-shaped lumen, which imposes a fixed geometry on the vessel wall. Such geometry produces vortices downstream, therefore exposing the artery wall to oscillatory shear stress (OSS) in the downstream region and a low 5 shear stress (LSS) in the region upstream of the blood flow [5, 28] . Such distinct patterns of shear stress induce atherosclerotic plaques with different composition. LSS-induced plaques present features of vulnerable plaques, whereas OSS-induced plaques display a more stable phenotype [5, 18, 28, 29] .",

These biomechanical elements influence several molecular mechanism and control atherosclerotic plaque composition [3] [4] [5] . In the present study, we found that ACE2, a major enzyme of the renin angiotensin system, was expressed in LSS-induced atherosclerotic plaques in the carotid artery and aortic sinus; however, poor to undetectable expression was seen in OSS- One well-known mechanism responsible for local depletion of ACE2 is an augmented shedding by ADAM17 [32]. Here we observed that ADAM17 was well expressed in both LSS-and OSS-induced plaques; however, no difference in expression between them was observed. As a limitation, the intraplaque activity of ADAM17 was not measured, and despite ADAM17 expression is similar between LSS-and OSS-induced plaques, it could be possible that this enzyme is more active in OSS than LSS region. Indeed, it has been reported that ADAM17 is overactive in human carotid atherosclerotic plaques of type 2 diabetes mellitus patients (condition associated with accelerated atherosclerosis), which was associated with a decrease of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 3, an endogenous inhibitor of ADAM17 13 [35] . Nevertheless, the mechanism by which ACE2 is poorly expressed in OSS-induced plaques remains to be elucidated.",

Additionally, diminazene may also upregulate the expression of ACE2 [27], indicating that this compound not only augments intrinsic enzyme activity, but also increases the total enzyme expression. The relevance of each mechanism most likely depends on the treatment condition and, despite both mechanisms, synergistical output to increase ACE2 activity, it still remains to be elucidated. In our study, we observed that diminazene acted only in atherosclerotic plaque expressing ACE2, suggesting that the effects of this compound depends on ACE2. However, as in the present study was not possible to assess the levels of Ang II and Ang-(1-7) within the atherosclerotic plaques, the mechanism by which diminazene improves the plaque stability should be prudently interpreted. Despite apparently inconsistent data, it is reasonable to infer that the short period of treatment was not sufficient to reduce the plaque size and/or that the pharmacological activation of ACE2 by diminazene is less effective compared to gene transfer overexpression.",

In LSS and aortic sinus plaques, diminazene increased collagen content, decreased MMP-9 expression and reduced macrophage infiltration, while in OSSinduced carotid plaques, none of the studied parameters where altered. The possible lack of action in OSS region might be due to the fact that ACE2 was poorly expressed in such plaques. It is reasonable to argue that, since ACE2 is widely expressed in the cardiovascular system, shifting the balance between Ang-(1-7) and Ang II, it is possible that increased Ang-(1-7) circulating levels would modulate OSS-induced plaque phenotype. Notwithstanding, we previously reported that long-term treatment with Ang-(1-7) ameliorates the phenotype of 16 LSS-induced plaques, but did not affect OSS-induced plaques [18] . Therefore, the probable increase in circulating level of Ang-(1-7) via diminazene would not affect OSS plaque composition. Despite of the above speculations the mechanism as to why diminazene did not affect OSS-induced plaques still remains to be elucidated.",

This interesting finding is in keeping with previous reports indicating a differential modulation of RAS components by distinct shear stress patterns.

Moreover, it was found a pronounced expression of AT1 receptor on the endothelial cells of the inner curvature of mouse aortic arch (atheroprone regions of the aortic arch), while AT1 expression was almost absent on the outer curvature [34].

Using a virtual molecular docking selection strategy, 139735 molecules (library of the National Cancer Institute, US) were screened to access the ability to interact with a specific pocket of ACE2 and sustain a favorable conformation for optimal enzyme activity [36]. The highest scoring compounds were obtained and assayed in vitro to evaluate their abilities to enhance ACE2 catalytic activity. One of the effective compounds was called XNT, which showed anenhanced catalytic rate by increasing the velocity of the enzyme 2-fold [36-39]. More recently, diminazene was identified as another ACE2 activator compound, but this time using a library of 1217 chemicals from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved compounds, therefore, compounds with extensive information on bioavailability, toxicity, and safety [26]. Diminazene was first described as an antitrypanosomal drug. This compound was used for the treatment of early-stage sleeping sickness, an infection caused by Trypanosoma brucei [40]. Interestingly, early studies have shown that diminazene might produce a hypotensive side-effect that was related to direct and indirect effects on the cardiovascular system [40]. Diminazene actions on the cardiovascular system have been documented in different conditions. For instance, diminazene attenuates pulmonary hypertension [27], reduces damages in cardiac [41] and stroke ischemia [42], improves erectile function [43], as well as other others beneficial effects [44, 45]. The mechanisms by which diminazene produce beneficial cardiovascular outcomes are not completely understood. Evidence has demonstrated that diminazene acts by modifying ACE2 activity and, as a result, decreases Ang II and increases Ang-(1-7) levels [19]. In fact, coadministration of C-16, ACE2 inhibitor, abolished the protective effects of diminazene on pulmonary hypertension [27] and post-myocardial infarction [41]. Moreover, it has been shown that treatment with diminazene (15 mg/kg/day) increased Ang-(1-7) circulating level and enhanced endothelial function in a model of diabetes [46]. Similarly, diminazene at 30 mg/kg/day elevated plasma Ang-(1-7) concentrations in Ldlr -/mice [45]. Supporting these observations, co-administration of A-779, an Ang-(1-7)-Mas receptor antagonist, attenuates the beneficial action of diminazene on cerebral ischaemia [42] and glaucoma [44].",

This enzyme is expressed within animal [20, 22] and human atherosclerotic plaques [21] and located in different cell types present in the lesions, such as endothelial cells, vascular smooth muscle cells and macrophages [14]. It has been shown that ACE2 overexpression by gene transfer diminished lesion progression in a rabbit model of atherosclerosis induced by endothelial injury and atherogenic diet [22]. Likewise, overexpression of ACE2 in ApoE -/mice attenuates atherosclerotic lesion size [47], indicating a beneficial role of ACE2 against atherosclerosis development. The protective action of ACE2 on atherosclerosis is also supported by data on ACE2-deficient mice model. ACE2-deficiency in both low-density lipoprotein receptor-deficient (Ldlr-/-) and ApoE -/background presented larger atherosclerotic lesions when compare to their respective controls [23-25]. In the present study, three weeks of treatment with diminazene did not alter the atherosclerotic lesion size.",

            "text": "These results were confirmed by previous studies. For instance, deficiency of ACE2 increased gene expression of VCAM-1 in mouse aorta, while endothelial cells cultured from ACE2 deficiency mice were characterized by increased VCAM-1 gene expression and secretion [24]. A similar effect was observed in cells from wild-type mice treated with the selective ACE2 inhibitor, MLN-4760 [24]. In another study, ACE2 gene transfer inhibited in vitro the monocyte adhesion to endothelial cells, which was associated with a reduction in VCAM-1 and E-selectin protein expression [48]. Moreover, diminazene also reduced IL-1\u03b2, IL-6 and MCP-1, putative mediators of atherogenesis that enhances responsiveness to proinflammatory stimuli. These findings are consistent with previous literature reports [22-24]. Thomas and colleagues [24] found that deficiency of ACE2 in ApoE -/mice was associated with increased gene expression of several inflammatory cytokines when compared to ApoE -/mice, including TNF\u03b1, IL-6 and CCL2. In another study, ACE2-deficiency enhanced accumulation of macrophages into the lesions which was associated with an increase in proinflammatory markers [23]. Likewise, overexpression of ACE2 leads to a reduction in the expression of intraplaque inflammatory cytokines [22]. Interestingly, diminazene strongly diminished VEGF levels, which is in accordance with previous published reports [49, 50]. For example, ACE2 overexpression [50] reduced VEGF expression in rat model of diabetic nephropathy, while Ang-(1-7) administration produced similar effect [49]",
