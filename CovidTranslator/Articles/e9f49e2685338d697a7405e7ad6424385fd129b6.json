Many ancient texts from Chinese Traditional Medicine, Ayurveda and Siddha, and Japanese Traditional medicine have documented the efficacy of H. cordata against oxidative stress and inflammation. Aim of the study: This review aims to provide up-to-date and comprehensive information on the efficacy of H. cordata extracts as well as its bioactive compounds both in vitro and in vivo, against oxidative stress and inflammation Materials and methods: Relevant information on H. cordata against oxidative stress and inflammation were collected from the established scientific databases such as NCBI, Web of Science, ScienceDirect, Elsevier, and Springer. Additionally, a few books and magazines were also consulted to get the important information. Results: Herbal medicines or plant products were traditionally being used for treating the oxidative stress and inflammation related diseases in diverse communities across the world. Scientifically, H. cordata has shown to target several signaling pathways and found to effectively reduce the oxidative stress and inflammation. Phytoconstituents such as afzelin, hyperoside and quercitrin have shown to reduce inflammation both in vitro and in vivo models. These molecules were also shown to have strong antioxidant properties both in vivo and in vitro models. Conclusions: H. cordata extracts and its bioactive molecules were shown to have both anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative properties. As both in vitro and in vivo studies were shown that H. cordata did not have any toxicity on the various model systems used, future clinical studies will hopefully make an impact on the future direction of treating inflammation-related diseases.",

HC extracts were shown to be effective against various ailments including cancer, diabetes, obesity, lung fibrosis, skin diseases and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) (Chang et al., 2001; Du et al., 2012; Kumar et al., 2014; Kwon and Kim, 2014; Lu et al., 2006; Miyata et al., 2010) . In addition, HC extracts were also shown to have both anti-bacterial and anti-viral activities against a host of pathogens such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, corona and dengue viruses etc (Chiow et al., 2016; Lau et al., 2008; Li et al., 2017; Sekita et al., 2016; Verma et al., 2017) . Based upon HC efficacy in improving the immune system of patients infected with the severe acute respiratory syndrome, Chinese experts have also enlisted HC for their national SARS program (Lu et al., 2006) . Oxidative stress and inflammation were considered to be the central mechanisms involved in various disease pathologies. Several studies have provided scientific evidence about the interlinking pathways governing oxidative stress-induced inflammation and vice versa. Thus it became prerogative to selectively target these mechanisms in order to develop therapeutics against many diseases (Khansari et al., 2009; Reuter et al., 2010; Salzano et al., 2014) .",

In North Eastern states of India, it is used as a garnish over ethnic side dishes and leaf salad to lower the blood sugar level. Leaf juices were also known to treat cholera, dysentery, anemia, and purification of blood (Laloo and Hemalatha, 2011) . During the growing season, the stem and leaves are harvested and used for preparing a decoction. Traditionally the decoction is used both internally and externally. Internally it is good for the treatment of many ailments including cancer, coughs, dysentery, enteritis and fever and externally it is applied to treat snake bites and skin diseases (Vent, 1987) . In Japan, a beverage made from an infusion of the leaves of HC herbs called Dokudami Cha mixed in with other herbal remedies were being used for removing free radicals, reducing inflammation and supporting the immune system.",

Role of H. cordata in inflammation-related molecular mechanism in vitro Different solvent extracts of HC and their active biomolecules have been shown to be effective against inflammation caused various inflammagens (Table 1 ). The major macrophage-derived pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-\u03b1, various interleukins (IL) and the reactive free radical NO synthesized by inducible NOS (iNOS) were widely been recognized to be involved in the development of inflammatory diseases (Freeman and Natanson, 2000) . In the study done by Park et al., 2005 has shown the aqueous extract from HC were found to inhibit NO and TNF-\u03b1 (up to 30%) production at 0.06 and 0.12 mg/ml in a dose-dependent manner in LPS induced mouse macrophages (Park et al., 2005) . Moreover, the ethanolic extract of HC was found to inhibit the inflammatory biomarkers IL-6 and NO in LPS treated lung epithelial cells (A549) and alveolar macrophages (MH-S) (Lee et al., 2015) . Furthermore, the ethanolic extracts were shown to inhibit the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway with inhibited phosphorylation of I\u03baB\u03b1, and reduction in TNF\u03b1, IL-6 and IL-8 level in phorbolmyristic acetate (PMA)/calcium ionophore (A23187) induced human mast cells (HMC-1) . These studies have sufficiently provided evidence of the anti-inflammatory role of HC extracts against both bacterial and ionic toxins.",

            "text": "The mast cell-mediated anaphylactic shock is considered to be one of the important molecular mechanisms involved in allergy associated inflammatory pathophysiology. The histamine released from degranulated mast cells and changes in intercellular Ca + are the main factors behind such acute anaphylactic reactions. In a study Li et. al., investigated the anti-allergic activity of HCWE against both systemic and acute anaphylactic reactions in rat peritoneal mast cells (RPMC). The HCWE (0, 2.5, 25, or 250 \u03bcg/ml) has shown to inhibit the histamine release and Ca + uptake in a dose-dependent manner (Li et al., 2005) . The possible mechanism of inhibition of histamine release and lower Ca + uptake was thought to be due to increase in adenylate cyclase activity and subsequent increase in intracellular cAMP level in mast cells. The IgE mediated allergic reactions were also found to play important role in inflammatory pathophysiology. The human basophilic cell expresses a high-affinity IgR receptor known as Fc epsilon RI receptor that can potentially activate allergic reactions. In a study, Shim et al. showed that the HC water extract reduced the IgE binding activity and m RNA expression of both \u03b1and \u03b3chains of Fc epsilon RI receptor in human KU812F cells. Furthermore, the HC extract was also shown to reduce the Fc epsilon RI mediated histamine release in KU812F cells (Shim et al., 2009) . In a yet another study, Han et al. provided evidence of the anti-inflammatory role of HC water extract against IgE mediated allergic response in rat mast RBL-2H3 cells. The HC water extract was shown to suppress the DNP-BSA mediated release of beta-hexosaminidase, histamine, ROS, TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 in IgE-sensitized RBL-2H3 cells. Moreover, it suppressed DNP-BSA-induced phosphorylation of Syk, Lyn, LAT, Gab2, PLC \u03b32, Akt and MAP kinases (Han et al., 2009) .",

Cyclooxygenase is an important regulator of inflammation regulating PGE2. Presence of unmodified 3-hydroxyl and 4-hydroxyl groups is critical for inhibition of COX 1/2 as an important therapeutic target for inflammation (Park, 2015) . Among derivative from H. cordata, becatamide (houttuynamide A) showed the most potent inhibitor of the COX-1 enzyme by (IC 50 = 0.27 \u03bcM), COX-2 enzyme (IC 50 = 0.78 \u03bcM) in mice. Upon comparison with specific COX-1 inhibitor aspirin (IC 50 = 3.57 \u03bcM), becatamide was found to be more potent in inhibiting COX-1. Evidently, becatamide was also found to inhibit collagen-induced production of TXB2 (thromboxane) by 35% and the Pselectin expression on mice platelets by 28% (Park, 2015) .

Firstly, the routes of entry of HC constituents into the cell will be of utmost importance, in order to understand the basic characteristics of the drug molecules interact with the cellular membrane. Secondly, in order to validate the possibility of the molecules of HC as a drug, further studies on its ability to cross blood brain barrier, skin permeability, lipophilicity as well as its pharmacodynamics properties will be useful. Thirdly, the role of HC extract/active molecules in calcium signaling is yet to be studied. Though a few studies have shown HC to inhibit the calcium uptake, still its role has to identify in order to comprehend information on its effect in cAMP/calcium signaling. Recent studies on inflammation have opened up the area of NLRP3 signaling. NLRP3 is found to be predominantly expressed in macrophages and is a component of inflammasome complex. Thus fourthly, elucidation of HC role in NLRP3 inflammasome is needed to understand its anti-inflammatory activities. Furthermore, studies concerning the role played by HC in GSK3\u03b2 signaling will be required in order to understand its role in oxidative stress-induced diseases.
