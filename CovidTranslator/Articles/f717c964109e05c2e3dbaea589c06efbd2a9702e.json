            "text": "Structure e rotaviruses comprise an inner core containing a genome of eleven segments of double-stranded RNA and the transcription/replication complex, a middle layer (inner capsid) consisting of viral protein 6 (VP6), and an outer layer made of VP7 and VP4, the latter protruding as spikes. 1 Classification e rotaviruses are a genus of the Reoviridae family and are routinely classified according to the immunological reactivities and genomic sequences of three of their structural components. Cross-reactivities of VP6 distinguish at least seven groups (AeG). Most human infections are caused by group A rotaviruses, which have been divided into several subgroups. The surface proteins VP4 and VP7 elicit type-specific neutralizing antibodies. Accordingly, for group A rotaviruses, a dual-type classification system has been established, differentiating G types (VP7-specific, G derived from glycoprotein) and P types (VP4-specific, P derived from protease-sensitive protein); 16 G types and 27 P types have been described, of which at least 11 G types and 11 P types have so far been found in humans. Because G and P proteins are encoded by different RNA segments, and rotaviruses of group A are found to reassort readily in doubly infected cells, various combinations of G and P types have been observed in natural human rotavirus isolates. 5 Recently, a comprehensive classification system involving genotyping of all 11 RNA segments has been proposed. 6 Replication and pathogenesis e rotaviruses replicate in mature epithelial cells at the tips of the villi of the small intestine. After virus replication, mature particles are released from cells by lysis. Rotavirus replication is rapid and reaches high titres (up to 10 11 virus particles/ml faeces at the peak of acute diarrhoea) within a short period of time. The diarrhoea arises from epithelial necrosis and atrophy, leading to reduced absorption of carbohydrates and increased osmotic pressure in the gut lumen. Cells emerging from the crypts of the gut epithelium, which exhibit reactive hyperplasia, repair the damage to villous cells. This is accompanied by increased secretion of fluid, which also contributes to the diarrhoea. A viral non-structural protein (NSP4, encoded by RNA segment 10) was shown to be an enterotoxin (the first viral protein) identified to exert this function. 7 Furthermore, a toxic effect of rotavirus infection on the autonomous nervous system of the gut has been described. 8 Immune response e primary rotavirus infection leads to a serotype-specific humoral immune response with initially monotypic protection. During the first two years of life, children are repeatedly infected with rotaviruses of various types, resulting in a more complex immune response that seems to provide partial heterotypic protection. 9 Rotavirus-specific secretory copro-antibodies of the IgA subclass have been identified as the best correlate of protection. 10 Caliciviruses Noroviruses (previously termed 'Norwalk-like viruses') and sapoviruses (previously termed 'Sapporo-like viruses') are two genera of the Caliciviridae family. They are classified into two or possibly three genogroups containing 16 genotypes. Noroviruses of different genotypes co-circulate but genotype II-4 predominates worldwide. Recombination among norovirus strains has been observed and may be more common than initially anticipated. Genetic and antigenic diversity arise through the accumulation of point mutations and the selection of variants through evolutionary pressure likely to be exerted by short-term herd immunity.",

It received US Food and Drug Administration approval for universal use in the USA in August 1998, and 1.5 million doses were used between September 1998 and July 1999. However, a Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System found gut intussusception to be a rare complication epidemiologically correlated with vaccination, particularly on days 3e7 after the first vaccination. The pathogenesis of this association is not clear. Although the vaccine-attributable risk of intussusception was considered very low in recent studies (<1/10,000), the recommendation for use of this vaccine in the USA was withdrawn in October 1999, and it was taken off the market by the manufacturer.",

The pentavalent vaccine (RotaTeq RTM ), containing the human antigens G1eG4 and P [8] in mono-reassortant viruses on a bovine rotavirus (WC3 strain) genetic backbone, is aimed at eliciting type-specific antibodies against all the rotavirus types that are recognized to circulate most frequently. The monovalent vaccine (Rotarix RTM ), an attenuated human G1P [8] strain, is based on two clinical observations. First, cross-protection is accumulated through successive natural infections, and rotavirus disease can be prevented by repeated natural infection. 9 Second, vaccination with one rotavirus type can provide protection, even if subsequent infections are caused by rotaviruses of a different type. Both vaccines have been found to be effective and safe. 19, 20 They have recently been licensed in numerous countries, and in some of them universal mass vaccination of children as part of childhood vaccination schemes has been started. 21 In the USA initial results are very promising 22 with a distinct decline in clinic visits and hospital admissions for rotavirus disease. There will be intense post-marketing surveillance in order to determine the impact of the vaccine and also to monitor whether or not novel rotavirus strains may emerge. Clinical trials with the new vaccines are ongoing in developing countries where they are most needed in order to determine the impact on rotavirus disease-associated mortality.",
