In this study, an original, highly virulent PEAV strain GDS04 was serially passaged in Vero cells. The virus titers and sizes of syncytia increased gradually with the cell passages. Newborn piglets were orally inoculated with PEAV P15, P67 and P100. Compared with P15 and P67, P100 resulted in only mild clinical signs and intestinal lesions in piglets. The virus shedding in feces and viral antigens in intestinal tract were markedly reduced in P100-inoculated piglets. Importantly, all P100-inoculated newborn piglets survived, indicating that P100 was an attenuated variant. Sequence analysis revealed that the virulent strain GDS04 had four, one, six and eleven amino acid differences in membrane, nucleocapsid, spike and ORF1ab proteins, respectively, from P100. Furthermore, more differences in the predicted three-dimensional structure of S protein between GDS04 and P100 were observed, indicating that these differences might be associated with the pathogenicity of PEAV. Collectively, our research successfully prepared a PEAV attenuated variant which might serve as a live attenuated vaccine candidate against PEAV infection.",

Live-attenuated vaccine is prepared from less virulent strain. The virulence of pathogenic microorganisms was reduced by various methods (Blanco-Lobo et al., 2019; Jie et al., 2018; O'Donnell et al., 2015) , such as genetic manipulation , and cell passage is the most commonly used (Jie et al., 2018) . Usually, the virulent parent strain was continuously inoculated cell lines more than 100 generations in vitro, and in this process, some mutations will happen in the viral genome, which might lead to the strain's virulence reduce. These cell-passaged strains are then tested in animals to determine whether they have less virulence and higher immunogenicity before being used to prepare live-attenuated vaccines. Of note, several groups have used cell passage to prepare porcine CoVs attenuated strains, such as PEDV (Lin et al., 2017) and TGEV (Motovski et al., 1985) , which laid a good foundation for preparation of live-attenuated vaccines.",

As shown in Fig. 3A , the newborn piglets inoculated with P15, P67 or P100 all showed diarrhea from 1 d.p.i. to 9 d.p.i., as compared with the control. But compared to P15 and P67, the degree of diarrhea of the newborn piglets inoculated with P100 was the lowest, indicating that viral pathogenicity decreased gradually in 5day-old newborn piglets with cell passage. In addition, we explored the fecal viral shedding in PEAV-inoculated piglets from 1 d.p.i. to 9 d.p.i. by qRT-PCR. Consistent with the clinical signs, the amount of virus RNA was lower in P100-inoculated newborn piglets, and no PEAV RNA was detected in the negative control piglets during the study (Fig. 3B) .

Currently, vaccination remains the most effective measure against swine enteropathogenic CoVs. Of note, several groups have used live-attenuated vaccines to prevent and control PEDV and TGEV in pigs (Aynaud et al., 1991; Song et al., 2007) . As a newly swine enteropathogenic CoV, there are no reports about live-attenuated vaccine for PEAV. Pathogenic microorganisms serially passaged in cells (Jie et al., 2018) is one of the most common methods to prepare live-attenuated vaccine. Vero cells as a stable African green monkey kidney cell line (Rhim et al., 1969) is commonly used to attenuate CoVs like PEDV (Lin et al., 2017) . In this study, PEAV GDS04 was passaged regularly to a total of 100 passages in Vero cells and the growth rate of P15, P67 and P100 was determined in vitro.

The mortality of newborn piglets in each group was recorded from 1 to 9 d.p.i.. significantly higher than those of P15 and P67 at 24 hpi, similar to observations in attenuated PEDV vaccine (Lin et al., 2017) , indicating that P100 had better adaptation in cells in vitro. Usually, adaptation in cell lines coincides with attenuation of the viruses, such as African swine fever virus (ASFV) isolate Georgioa and PEDV isolate PC22A, in swine Lin et al., 2017) . The higher fitness of P100 in Vero cells might suggest the changed pathogenicity of PEAV. For a vaccine candidate, safety is the top concern. It was reported that swine enteric CoVs like PDCoV, PEDV and TGEV are age-dependent disease (Moon et al., 1975; Shibata et al., 2000; Xu et al., 2019b) . Similarly, in another study, we found that PEAV was highly pathogenic to newborn piglets (Xu et al., 2019a) , but did not cause vomiting and death in weaned piglets at a medium dose of 1 \u00d7 10 6 TCID 50 within 7 days (data not shown), for which reason we choose newborn piglets to conduct PEAV pathogenicity study. It was known that PEAV infection caused typical clinical symptoms characterized by watery diarrhea via oral feeding in newborn piglets (Xu et al., 2019a) . In the study, we infected the 5-day-old newborn piglets with P15, P67 and P100 via oral feeding. Compared with P15 and P67, P100 caused slight diarrhea in newborn piglets, suggesting that the pathogenicity of PEAV changed through cell passage. For enteric viruses, viral shedding is often accompanied by diarrhea, so was PEAV infection (Xu et al., 2019a) . Thus, Fig. 6 . Phylogenetic trees constructed on the basis of the complete genome sequences of PEAV P15, P67 and P100 or other CoVs and sequence alignments of PEAV at selected passages. (A) The dendrogram was constructed using the neighbour-joining method in the MEGA software package, version 5 (http://www.megasof tware.net). Bootstrap resampling with 1,000 replicates was performed, and bootstrap values are indicated for each node. Reference sequence obtained from GenBank is indicated by strain name. The scale bar represents 0.5 nucleotide substitutions per site. (B) Sequence alignments of the amino acids of M, N S and ORF1ab proteins were performed using DNAMAN software. Z. Xu, et al. Veterinary Microbiology 239 (2019) 108489 we collected fecal swabs from the PEAV-challenged piglets and detected the fecal shedding by real-time PCR. Consistent with the clinical signs, the amount of virus RNA was lower in P100-inoculated newborn piglets. Interestingly and importantly, the presence of PEAV RNA in fecal samples of P100 inoculated piglets from 1 d.p.i to 9 d.p.i suggested the successful colonization and replication of P100 in intestinal tract, which is essential to induce mucosal immunity for an enteric pathogen vaccine candidate. It was reported that the lesions were only observed in intestinal tract but not any other organs after PEAV infection and PEAV antigen was detected in the villous enterocytes of the PEAV-challenged piglets (Xu et al., 2019a) . Compared to P15 and P67, P100 strain caused slight macroscopic and microscopic lesions in intestinal tract and no PEAV antigen was detected in the cytoplasm of the villous enterocytes of the P100-challenged newborn piglets by immunohistochemical analysis, indicating that the infectiveness of P100 was reduced. Like other swine enteric CoVs, such as PEDV (Shibata et al., 2000) , PEAV infection caused fatal disease in newborn piglets (Xu et al., 2019a) . Thus, death after infection is the key indicator to determine the attenuation of the viral strain. Compared to P15 and P67, no piglets died in P100-inoculated group and the control group during the study, indicating that P100 is low pathogenic to the newborn piglets. Taken together, these results demonstrated that P100 strain is safe for pigs and effective in colonizing and replicating in intestine, suggesting its future application as a good PEAV vaccine candidate. Compared to P15 and P67 strains, the virulence of P100 was significantly reduced in 5-day-old newborn piglets. The S protein of CoVs is the pivotal surface glycoprotein involved in virus attachment and entry, virus attenuation and induction of neutralizing antibodies in vivo (Cruz et al., 2008; Lin et al., 2017; Woo et al., 2010) . In addition, the virulence of a recombinant PEDV with inactivation of the endocytosis signal of the S protein was significantly reduced in piglets (Hou et al., 2019a) , indicating that the S protein might be associated with the virulence of CoVs. Compared to the S protein of parental strain GDS04, P100 possesses 2 aa mutations in aa positions 100 and 670, which were also found in P15 and P67, indicating that these 2 aa-mutations are insufficient to cause viral attenuation. Of note, Compared to P15 and P67, P100 possesses 3 aa deletions and 1 aa mutation in aa positions 1001, 1002, 1003 and 1129, respectively, indicating that the absence and mutation of these amino acids might affect the viral attenuation. Usually, protein with complete structure has corresponding function, and the changes in the protein's structure might affect its function. Overlap of the S protein structures of GDS04, P15, P67 and P100 showed that the difference between P100 and GDS04 was most significant (Fig. 7) , indicating a potential relationship between these differences of S protein and pathogenicity of PEAV. It was reported that the S protein is necessary but not sufficient for the virulence of PEDV (Wang et al., 2018) . M protein plays an important role in the process of virus assembly by interacting with S and N proteins (de Haan et al., 1999; Nguyen and Hogue, 1997) . N protein can encapsulate the viral genome RNA to form the nucleocapsid (Spaan et al., 1983; Sturman et al., 1980) . Inactivation of the viral 2\u2032-O methyltransferase of nsp16 could help to engineer a live attenuated PEDV vaccine (Hou et al., 2019a) . In this study, aa changes were also found in M, N and ORF1ab proteins in P100 strain as compared to GDS04 (Fig. 6B ). In addition, no additional mutation was observed by sequencing the viruses shed from the challenged piglets (data not shown). Therefore, these results suggest that the complete attenuation of a PEAV strain might be the result of a combination of multiple mutations along the genome, and can occur via multiple molecular mechanisms. Whether individual or a combination of genetic changes of PEAV strains alter viral infectivity, pathogenicity and replication efficiency need further examination by reverse genetics technology. Together, all these results confirmed that P100 generated in this study was low pathogenic to the newborn piglets and might serve as a good PEAV vaccine candidate. However, there are still several important questions needed to be addressed. For instance, what is the immunogenicity of P100 strain as a live-attenuated vaccine candidate in pigs? What is the protective effect of P100 strain in pigs? Elucidation of these questions will help us to develop a safe and efficacious live-attenuated vaccine to control PEAV.",
