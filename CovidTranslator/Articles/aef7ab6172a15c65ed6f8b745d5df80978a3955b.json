The objective of this study was to compare the mRNA expression of genes associated with Tregs (CD25, FoxP3, CTLA4, and IDO), after experimental infection of beef calves with low (LV) or high (HV) virulence BVDV. Thirty BVDV-na\u00efve calves were randomly assigned to three groups.

Quantitative RT-PCR was used to determine the expression of target genes in tracheo-bronchial lymph nodes and spleen on day 5 post-infection. The mRNA expression of CD25 was up-regulated in tracheo-bronchial lymph nodes of LV (P < 0.05), but not in HV compared to the control group. The expression of FoxP3 and CTLA4 was not increased in tracheo-bronchial lymph nodes of either of the BVDV-inoculated groups. A dramatic up-regulation of IDO mRNA was observed in tracheo-bronchial lymph nodes of LV (P < 0.05), but not HV compared to the control calves. In conclusion, experimental infection with BVDV did not provide evidence of Treg activation based on expression of FoxP3 and CTL4. Differential expression of CD25 and IDO mRNA on day 5 post-infection with HV or LV BVDV might reflect temporal differences in transcription occurring during the immune response elicited by these viral strains, or differences in viral infectivity of the host cells.",

In addition to FoxP3, functional Tregs often express the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA4), a surface protein receptor associated with transmission of an inhibitory signal to T cells. CLTA-4 is capable of down regulating the adaptive immune response [4] . Moreover, CLTA4-expressing Treg cells induce the expression of the enzyme indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) in antigen presenting cells.

It is believed that Tregs generally suppress the immune response or allow the virus to evade the immune response in these infections [6] . Recent studies have demonstrated induction of Tregs during the early phase of acute infection with PRRSV [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] . Moreover, the increased frequency of CD25 + FoxP3 + T cells during infection with PRRSV in pigs has been associated with an increased secretion of IL-10 and TGF-\u2424, which have recognized immunosuppressive function and are products of induced and natural Tregs [18, 20] . The induction of these T cell subsets could explain the delay in PRRSV cell mediated immunity that is commonly observed [21] and the PRRS induced immunosuppression of infected pigs that defines the classical course of infection [6] . Therefore, an upregulation of Treg associated genes in calves infected with BVDV could indicate a role for these T cell subsets in BVDV pathogenesis.",

The goal of this set of assessments was to elucidate differences in gene expression in lymphoid tissue from calves infected with high or low virulence BVDV that is likely to be associated with immunosuppression and the course of clinical disease, particularly in light of characterization of mRNA expression for type 1 interferon, pro-apoptotic signals, pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokine responses that have been already published for the same tissues [22, 23] . The objectives of this study were to: 1. Evaluate the mRNA expression of genes associated with Tregs (CD25, FoxP3, CTLA4, and IDO) in lymphoid tissues from an early acute infection with non-cytopathic (ncp) BVDV in beef calves and 2. Compare the mRNA expression of these Treg genes in lymphoid tissues during early acute infection between high (BVDV-2 strain 1373) and low (BVDV-1 strain SD-1) virulence strains of BVDV.",

The inoculation was performed by intranasal aerosolization of 5 mL of inoculum with an aerosolizer and a vacuum pump. One additional sample of each inoculum was transported on ice to the farm and subsequently returned to the lab for immediate determination of the CCID 50 /mL after inoculations were complete to determine the minimal viral challenge under the procedure.",

Statistical parametric assumptions of normality and constant variance were tested using Shapiro Wilk's and Levene's tests, respectively. Additionally, normal probability, residuals and quartile-quartile plots were constructed and analyzed to confirm any significant departure from normality and constant variability of the data. Since relative mRNA expression data were not normally distributed (heavily skewed), and had a heterogeneous variance, the comparison of means of the gene expression data were logarithmically transformed. The outcomes produced by the transformation were examined for possible violations of the tentative assumption of normality. The general linear model procedure (Proc GLM) was used for the analysis of variance to compare the relative mRNA level of target genes among groups (using the Least Significant difference, LSD Test). Differences with P-values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant.",

Calves in the HV group did not show a significant increase in CD25 mRNA expression when compared to that of the control group. These results appear to indicate that up-regulation of the IL-2 alpha chain is greater on day 5 post-infection for LV infected calves and that this might be related to the context of immune response to LV infection. CD25 is related to clonal expansion and the early induction of Treg cells. The highly virulent BVDV-2 strain 1373, responsible for causing severe acute disease, has been associated with a greater than 50% reduction in circulating lymphocytes and lymphoid depletion in vivo [22, 25, 29, 30] . In a recent report we showed that the calves inoculated with the highly virulent BVDV-2 strain 1373 had a significant reduction in lymphocyte count on day 5 post infection compared with the calves infected with the low virulence BVDV-1a strain SD-1 and the control group [22] . The observed lymphopenia during BVDV-2 infection might have occurred as a consequence of lymphocytes apoptosis and/or necrosis. [31] . This previously observed depletion of leukocytes could be responsible for a lower mRNA expression of genes associated with Treg markers. Previous studies by Ridpath et al. [31] have shown a decrease in replicating cells and an increase in the fraction of dead cells in cultured lymphoid cell lines in vitro after infection with the highly virulent BVDV-2 strain 1373. On the other hand, infection with a low virulence virus did not have an apparent effect on cell health or replication [31] , which might support our observations of differential CD25 mRNA expression.",

It is proposed that activation of Treg cells generally suppresses immunity, or provide a mechanism for the virus to evade the immune response in several species [13, 15, 17] . Recent studies have demonstrated induction of Tregs during early phase of acute infection with PRRSV [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] . Moreover, the increased frequency of CD25 + FoxP3 + T cells during infection with PRRSV in pigs has been associated with an increased production of the inhibitory cytokines IL-10 and TGF-beta [18, 20] , lymphocyte suppression activity in vitro [20, 32] and increased susceptibility to natural Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae infection [17] . The induction of this T cell subset could explain the decreased and delayed local [33] [34] [35] and systemic [6] PRRSV-directed cell mediated immunity in PRRS infection, and the generalized immunosuppression observed in acutely infected pigs. Furthermore, in humans the suppression of virus-specific immunity associated with an increased expression of Treg associated genes (FoxP3, CD25 and CTLA4) in patients infected with HIV [36, 37] may contribute to uncontrolled viral replication and consequently lead to inflammatory damage and secondary infection during HIV infection [13] .",

This inhibitory molecule is produced by antigen presenting cells and has been most commonly associated with pregnancy related immune suppression that protects the developing fetus from maternal rejection [42] . In addition, reports have previously associated IDO production with viral infections such as influenza virus, hepatitis C virus and HIV [43] [44] [45] . Enhanced tryptophan degradation by this enzyme contributes importantly to disease progression and clinical complications in HIV patients [46] . In the present study, no significant increase of IDO mRNA level was observed on day 5 post challenge in calves experimentally infected with BVDV-2 strain 1373. In contrast, LV BVDV infection with SD-1 did yield a highly significant increase in IDO mRNA level. This differential expression of IDO mRNA in calves inoculated with BVDV of different virulence might be associated with specific virus differences in temporal regulation of the transcription process during the immune response, or with greater efficacy of infection of macrophages and dendritic cells by BVDV-1a strain SD-1. These antigen-presenting cells have a major role in IDO production.",

The use of two type 2 BVDV strains of different virulence might have more clearly shown the specific effect of virulence. The present study was designed to recreate the scenario of comparing BVDV infections that are likely to occur naturally in the field. That is, it is quite common to find infection with a low virulence BVDV-1 virus or higher virulence BVDV-2 virus in the field. However, some BVDV-2 viruses are of low virulence. Prevalence studies examining BVDV isolates from cattle derived from diagnostic laboratory submissions have shown that BVDV-1 genotype was more frequently isolated in the field. In that study 61% of the isolates were BVDV-1 compared to 39% for BVDV-2 genotypes in animals with bovine respiratory disease complex [47] . Most BVDV infections are subclinical. However, BVDV is considered a strong potentiator of secondary infections even in mild infections providing no observed clinical signs. This is a consequence of the ability of BVDV to cause generalized clinical immunosuppression, resulting in polymicrobial respiratory disease. For these reasons we used a model based on two different genotypes (BVDV-1 and BVDV-2).",

Further, the functionally associated CTL4 gene was also not affected by either LV or HV BVDV infection on day 5 post infection. The differential expression of CD25 and IDO mRNA on the fifth day after infection between calves inoculated with high and low virulence BVDV might reflect differences in the subpopulations of leukocytes activated by HV and LV viruses during the early phase of infection. It is possible that LV infection yields IDO mediated suppressor activity by interaction of macrophages and dendritic cells with activated lymphocytes expressing the alpha chain of the IL-2 receptor. HV virus may interact with different leukocyte subpopulations and possibly enhance damage inducing pathways (e.g. through production of IL-17). The differential expression of genes in HV and LV infection on the fifth day after infection may also reflect temporal-spatial differences in the sequence of transcriptional events occurring during the immune response against these two viral strains, or may be due to specific BVDV genotype differences in viral infectivity of the host cells. Overall, under these experimental conditions, the analysis of mRNA expression for genes associated with regulatory T lymphocytes (CD25, FoxP3, CTLA4, and IDO) on the fifth day after infection with ncp BVDV did not provide a solid basis for postulating a role of classical Treg cells in the early pathogenesis of BVDV infection or the differential pathogenesis of high and low virulence BVDV strains.",
