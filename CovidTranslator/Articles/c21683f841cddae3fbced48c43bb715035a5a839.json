            "text": "Humoral immunity is important for controlling viral diseases of poultry, but recent studies have indicated that cytotoxic T cells also play an important role in the immune response to infectious bronchitis virus (IBV). To better understand the cell mediated immune responses to IBV in the mucosal and systemic immune compartments chickens were ocularly vaccinated with IBV. This induced a lymphocyte expansion in head-associated lymphoid tissues (HALT) and to a lesser extent in the spleen, followed by a rapid decline, probably due to homing of lymphocytes out of these organs and contraction of the lymphocyte population. This interpretation was supported by observations that changes in mononuclear cells were mirrored by that in CD3 + CD44 + T cell abundance, which presumably represent T effector cells. Increased interferon gamma (IFN-c) expression was observed in the mucosal immune compartment, i.e., HALT, after primary vaccination, but shifted to the systemic immune compartment after boosting. In contrast, the expression of cytotoxicity-associated genes, i.e., granzyme A (GZMA) and perforin mRNA, remained associated with the HALT after boosting. Thus, an Ark-type IBV ocular vaccine induces a central memory IFN-c response in the spleen while the cytotoxic effector memory response, as measured by GZMA and perforin mRNA expression, remains associated with CALT after boosting.",

It causes huge economic losses to poultry industries by reducing the quality and quantity of egg production in layers and breeders and reducing growth rate in broilers (Cavanagh and Gelb, 2008; Dolz et al., 2012) . Controlling IBV is difficult due to its high mutation rate, which allows it to quickly evolve into variants or serotypes that can escape the immune response (Cavanagh et al., 1992; Jia et al., 1995; Kottier et al., 1995) . IBV infections induce both humoral and cell mediated immune responses Martins et al., 1991; Mockett and Cook, 1986) . Although humoral immunity to IBV in the systemic immune compartment is important, it does not correlate with protection against IBV Ignjatovic and Galli, 1994; Raggi and Lee, 1965) . Collisson et al. (2000) showed that an increase in cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) activity in splenocytes correlated with decreased viral loads in lungs and kidneys of IBV infected chickens.",

Others investigators have also stressed the importance of cytotoxic T cells in the initial phase of the immune response to IBV (Liu et al., 2012; Seo et al., 2000) . The mucosal immune system is perfectly situated to play a role in antigen-specific immune protection against IBV challenge, since IBV enters the host tissue through the mucosal sites of the ocular and nasal epithelium (Cavanagh and Gelb, 2008) . IBV initially replicates in Harderian glands (HG) (Chousalkar et al., 2007) where IBV-specific IgA antibodies are secreted after IBV exposure (Davelaar and Kouwenhoven, 1981; Davelaar et al., 1982; van Ginkel et al., 2008) . Like HG, conjunctiva-associated lymphoid tissues (CALT) also play an important role in mucosal immune protection of the eye (Fix and Arp, 1991; van Ginkel et al., 2012) . However, little is known about the cell-mediated immune response in these mucosa-associated lymphoid tissues.",

To this end the total number of mononuclear cells in CALT, HG and spleen were counted after ocular immunization with 3 \u00c2 10 4 EID 50 per bird of Ark-type IBV. The mononuclear cell counts in CALT and HG increased starting 7-8 days post vaccination (DPV) and peaked on 9 DPV (1.9 \u00c2 10 6 cells in CALT and 5 \u00c2 10 6 cells in HG), representing the expansion phase ( Fig. 1A and B). The number of mononuclear cells in the HG and CALT were statistically significantly higher on 9 DPV than in unvaccinated control chickens. The CALT mononuclear cells were also significantly elevated on day 8. An abrupt decline on day 10 post vaccination was observed (going down to 7 \u00c2 10 5 cells in CALT and 5.6 \u00c2 10 5 cells in HG), representing the beginning of the contraction phase combined with homing of mononuclear cells out of these tissues. The mononuclear cell counts in spleen significantly increased from 1.1 \u00c2 10 8 cells on 3 DPV to 1.8 \u00c2 10 8 cells on 9 DPV and decreased to 1.5 \u00c2 10 8 cells on 10 DPV in the contraction phase (Fig. 1C ). The changes in mono- nuclear cell numbers were not as evident in the spleen as in the CALT and HG relative to the total number of mononuclear cells present. The relative low percentage of change in the number of mononuclear cells of the spleen compared to CALT and HG may be due in part to the ocular immunization route. However, this change still represented the largest decline in cell numbers during the contraction phase of all lymphoid organs analyzed. It decreased by 30 \u00c2 10 6 lymphocytes on average.",

A gradual increase in the average mRNA expression of GZMA was observed starting on 4-5 DPV in CALT (Fig. 4A ) resulting in a significant increase in GZMA mRNA expression during the peak of the response on 8-9 DPV (90 fold higher than controls), after which it declined. This pattern was mimicked by perforin mRNA expression in CALT, but the changes were of lower magnitude and were not significantly increased over control values (Fig. 4B) . The significant decline of perforin mRNA expression on days 2-3 post vaccination (Fig. 4B) in CALT coincided with a decrease of CD44 + CD3 + T cells seen on 3 DPV (Fig. 2A) . The HG displayed significant increases in mRNA expression of both GZMA (18 fold increase over controls) and perforin (7 fold increase over controls) 2-3 DPV (Fig. 4C and D) . The HG also displayed a peak GZMA mRNA expression on days 8-9, which was not significantly elevated over controls due to the high degree of variation in mRNA expression. However, the time points prior to this peak, days 6-7, and following this peak, days 10-11, displayed a significantly elevated GZMA mRNA expression over controls. Perforin mRNA expression in HG also had a significantly higher response 14 DPV (8 times higher).

The route of vac- cination, i.e., ocular vaccination, most likely contributed to this lack of responsiveness in the spleen compared to the HALT. Upon ocular boosting of the IBV-specific immune response 4 weeks after priming, the IFN-c response shifts from the mucosal to the systemic immune compartment. Although the cytotoxic T cell response, as measured by the mRNA expression of GZMA and perforin, remains associated with CALT in the secondary response. Effector memory T cells (T EM ) are known to home to effector sites and contain subsets of T H 1and CTLs in response to a virus challenge. In contrast, central memory T cells (T CM ) home to the lymph nodes and spleen, proliferate and secrete IFN-c in response to stimulation with antigen (Sallusto et al., 2004) . The expression of GZMA in CALT after boosting suggests the induction or presence of cytolytic T EM, while IFN-c expression without GZMA expression in spleen is consistent with proliferating T CM . T EM reside at the ''frontline'' of pathogen invasion and initiate a quick response upon reinfection with the pathogen (Kaech et al., 2002; Masopust and Picker, 2012) . Modification of IBV vaccines to generate greater numbers of these T EM may reduce the severity of an IBV infection.",

CALT follows a similar pattern except that it initially undergoes a drop in CD3 + CD44 + T cells followed by an increase during the expansion phase and a second drop during the contraction phase. This indicates that effector T cells initially leave the CALT upon IBV exposure, followed by a repopulation during the expansion phase and a subsequent decline during the contraction phase, which coincides with homing out of CALT to infection sites.

The CALT shows an extended significant increase of IFN-c mRNA expression, i.e., from 4 to 14 DPV, during the primary response to ocular Ark-type IBV vaccination. A concomitant increase in GZMA and perforin mRNA expression from 4 to 9 DPV in CALT is also observed. These observations, combined with the IFN-c mRNA expression pattern, are consistent with a T H 1-driven cytotoxic T cell response in CALT following primary IBV vaccination.",

            "text": "During the primary response to IBV in the HG two periods of increased IFN-c mRNA expression are observed. The peak response on day 2 may represent an early innate immune response in HG involving NK cells and/or cd T cells capable of displaying cytotoxic activity (Pieper et al., 2008; Seo et al., 2000; Choi and Lillehoj, 2000; Vervelde et al., 2013) . Future studies may be able to confirm this. A second increase of IFN-c mRNA expression in HG occurs on day 5-6 post vaccination at the beginning of the expansion phase and may coincide with induction of a T H 1 response. T H 1 cells, in addition to providing support to cytotoxic T cells, also support antibody production by B cells as is documented for mammals (Jiang and Dong, 2013) . Our observation that IBV-specific IgA secreting cells are observed starting from 7 days post ocular IBV vaccination in HG would be consistent with this notion (unpub-lished observations). It is interesting that the viral load of IBV in the HG starts to decrease after day 7 (Ndegwa et al., 2012) , which coincides with increased IgA production (unpublished observations) and Granzyme A and perforin expression (Fig. 4) . In addition, the largest decrease in virus load occurs when the CD3 + CD44 + T cells are significantly elevated in the HG (Fig. 2) , indicating these cells may also function as T effector cells in the chicken. These observations indicate that both cell mediated and humoral immune responses to IBV may contribute to decreased virus load in the HG after IBV vaccination. Indirect evidence that IFN-c may also support the cytotoxic T cell response comes from a steady increase of perforin mRNA expression from 6 to 14 DPV and of GZMA mRNA expression from 6 to 9 DPV in the primary IBV response.",

The increase in IFN-c mRNA expression in the HG at 5-6 days post primary vaccination could be indicative of a T H 1-dominated immune response. Since the viral replication is restricted to mucosal tissues in the first few days after vaccination, the immune response to IBV prevails in these sites as opposed to the systemic compartment, which the virus has not yet reached (Davelaar and Kouwenhoven, 1981) . Although the spleen does not display a significant increase in IFN-c mRNA expression in the primary IBV response, an increase in IFN-c mRNA expression by sorted CD8 + T cells in the spleen is observed on 10 days post primary vaccination (data not shown). This is consistent with the finding that CD8 + T cells increase 10 days post infection following challenge with the IBV-Gray strain . In addition, the mRNA expression of GZMA and perforin was significantly decreased in the spleen on day 6-11 and 2-7 post vaccination, respectively. This indicates that lymphocytes in the spleen are producing lower levels of mRNA for expression of cytotoxic enzymes or alternatively are homing to mucosal tissues after primary IBV vaccination, reducing expression of these enzymes in the spleen. Since there is no precedent for splenic lymphocytes producing lower levels of cytolytic enzymes after exposure to a virus, the latter option seems the most likely scenario.",

This coincides with an increase in perforin mRNA expression in the spleen (although not significant). A significant increase in IFN-c mRNA expression is observed in HG four days after the booster vaccine was given, while no significant increase in IFN-c mRNA expression is observed in CALT. In contrast to IFN-c, the GZMA mRNA expression in CALT is significantly elevated between 4-7 days and is also increased on day 11 post boosting. However, no significant increases in GZMA mRNA expression are observed in HG or spleen. Thus, after boosting, the observed data is consistent with the induction of a central memory-dominated T cell response in the spleen, and induction of a cytotoxic T EM response in CALT. Interestingly, no increase of GZMA mRNA expression is observed in HG, indicating that the cytotoxic T EM cells may preferentially home to CALT rather than HG.",

The IBV-induced IFN-c memory response is mainly located in the spleen, indicating a central memory IFN-c response while the cytotoxic memory response, as seen in both the primary and secondary response, is predominantly located in CALT indicating an effector memory GZMA response. Thus CALT is the main site for cytotoxic immune responses to IBV in both the primary and secondary immune response based on GZMA mRNA expression.
