The separation and purification of glycyrrhizin from a methanol-water (70:30 (v/v)) extract of liquorice roots was achieved using high-speed counter-current chromatography. The separation was performed at a preparative scale in a one-step separation with a two-phase solvent system composed of ethyl acetate-methanol-water (5:2:5 (v/v)). The lower phase was used as the mobile phase in the head-to-tail elution mode. The present method yielded 42.2 mg glycyrrhizin at 96.8% purity from 130 mg of the crude exact with 95.2% recovery as determined by HPLC analysis.",

            "text": "Glycyrrhizin is one of the main bioactive components in the plant liquorice (Glycyrrhiza uralensis Fisch), a common ingredient of herbal medicines. Liquorice is native to Turkey, Iraq, Spain, Greece, and northern China. The plant has been used as sweetening and flavoring agent and for the treatment of a variety of health problems for thousands of years. Recently, glycyrrhizin has been found to be highly active in inhibiting replication of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-associated virus as well as a potential therapeutic agent for chronic hepatitis and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) [1] [2] [3] . Moreover, glycyrrhizin has many other pharmacological uses that include anti-inflammatory, anti-ulcerous, anti-hepatotoxic, anti-oxidative and anti-allergic activities [1] [2] [3] . The chemical structure of glycyrrhizin is shown in Fig. 1 . At present, glycyrrhizin is commercially purified from liquorice by several steps such as crystallization and chromatography. However, its recovery is only between 20 and 30% and the cost is high [4] . Existing HPLC methods are not suitable for large-scale isolation of glycyrrhizin. Hence alternative methods are being sought. The support-free techniques such as high-speed counter-current chromatography (HSCCC) have gained growing importance in the separation of naturally occurring compounds [5] . HSCCC as an all-liquid chromatographic technique operates under gentle conditions and allows non-destructive isolation even of labile natural compounds [5] . Due to the absence of solid stationary phase, adsorption losses are minimized and hence excellent sample recovery is guaranteed. Furthermore, it permits introduction of the crude sample directly into the hallow column. As a result, the application of HSCCC in purification of natural products is steadily increasing, because of its superior separation abilities and excellent recovery rates [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] . The aim of the present study was to investigate the preparative separation and purification of glycyrrhizin from the root of liquorice by HSCCC.",

            "text": "Glycyrrhizin is one of the glycuronides. Little is known about the use of n-butanol-water for the separation of glycuronides by HSCCC [16] . Using this two-phase solvent system, glycyrrhizin could be separated from the other compounds. But, the flow rate of the mobile phase was very low that resulted in an excessively broad peak with long elution time. Furthermore, the solubility of glycyrrhizin in this solvent system was poor. Consequently such a solvent system was not appropriate for the separation of a large amount of the sample due to the poor solubility. In this paper, a series of solvent systems with a broad range of hydrophobicities (by modifying the volume ratios), such as n-butanol, chloroform and ethyl acetate systems, were tested. The K-values of glycyrrhizin in these solvent systems are summarized in Table 1 . When chloroform-methanol-water (5:6:4, 5:5:3, 4:3:2 (v/v)) or n-butanol-ethyl acetate-water (4:1:5, 3:2:5, 2:3:5, 1:4:5 (v/v)) was used as the two-phase solvent system, glycyrrhizin could be separated from the other compounds. But, its K-values in the two-phase solvent systems were big with which glycyrrhizin was eluted in an excessively broad peak with long elution time. When tert-butylmethyl ether-methanol-water (10:3:10, 5:2:5 (v/v)) was used as the two-phase solvent system, the K-values were small. It was difficult to separate glycyrrhizin from other compounds. When ethyl acetate-methanol-water (10:3:10, 5:2:5 (v/v)), ethyl acetate-n-butanol-methanol-water (1:3:1:4, 2:2:1:4 (v/v)) or tert-butylmethyl ether-n-butanol-methanol-water (1:3:1:4, 2:2:1:4 (v/v)) was used as the two-phase solvent system, the K-values were suitable. Glycyrrhizin could be well separated from the other compounds using these solvent Chromatogram of the crude sample extracted from the root of liquorice by HSCCC separation, along with the HPLC chromatogram of purified glycyrrhizin from HSCCC: 1, glycyrrhizin.
