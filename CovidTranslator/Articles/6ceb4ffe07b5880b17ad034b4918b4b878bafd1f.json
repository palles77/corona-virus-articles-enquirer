            "text": "Sialic acids are a family of approximately 50 naturally occurring 2-keto-3-deoxy-nononic acids that are involved in a wide range of biological processes. [1] [2] [3] The C-5-amino derivative represents the long-known neuraminic acid and its amino function can either be acetylated (Neu5Ac) or glycolylated (Neu5Gc). As terminal components of glycoproteins and glycolipids, neuraminic acids are a-(2?3)-or a-(2?6)-linked to galactosides or a-(2?6)-linked to 2-acetamido-galactosides. [4] [5] [6] Enzymatic acetylation, lactylation, sulfation, methylation and phosphorylation of free hydroxyls give a large structural diversity of sialic acids. 3, 7 O-Acetylation of sialic acids takes place in the Golgi apparatus by membrane bound O-acetyltransferases. Interestingly, different cell types show different substrate selectivity for acetylation of sialic acid indicating that there are different classes of acetyltransfereases. 2, 3, 8 Alternatively, it may be possible that adaptor proteins control the sub-strate specificity. Initially, acetyl transferases introduce an acetyl ester at C-7 or C-9 of sialic acid and under physiological conditions, the C-7 acetyl ester can migrate to C-8 or C-9 making C-9 acetylation (Neu5,9Ac 2 ) the most prevalent sialic acid modification of cell surface glycoconjugates. 2, 7 Acetylation of the C-4 hydroxyl of sialosides has also been observed. 9 It has been shown that 9-O-acetylation of sialic acids can dramatically influence biological properties of glycoconjugates. 2, 7, 10 For example, O-acetylation of sialosides on the surface of thymocytes results in loss of binding to Siglec-2 (CD22b) on B-cells. 11 Abrogation of 9-O-acetylated deleteriously affects development of transgenic mice. This modification is also involved in cell specific recognition by influenza C and corona viruses. 12, 13 It has also been demonstrated that sialoglycoproteins having 9-O-acetylation are expressed on lymphoblasts of children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. 14 Glycoproteins and gangliosides from rat, mouse and chicken erythrocytes express Neu5,9Ac 2 -a-(2?3)-Galb-(1?3)-GalNAc, which serves as targets for the binding of naturally occurring antibodies. 12, 15, 16 In microorganisms, such as the trypanosoma parasite Crithidia fasciculata and the pathogenic fungus Cryptococcus neoformans, Neu5,9Ac 2 can be glycosidically linked to Gal-b-(1?3)-GalNAc. 17, 18 The potential impact of 9-O-acetylation of the GD 1a ganglioside on the overall conformation and recognition by a natural human antibody has been investigated by molecular dynamics simulations and NMR. It was found that acetylation did not affect the conformational properties of the oligosaccharide. However, it was shown that an antibody specific for a 9-O-acetylated ganglioside can make direct interactions with the acetyl group rationalizing the selective recognition of acetylated derivatives. 16, 19 As part of a program to develop monoclonal antibodies against sialo-oligosaccharides bearing 9-O-acetyl esters, we report here an efficient chemo-enzymatic synthesis of Neu5,9Ac 2 -a-(2?3)-Gal-b-(1?3)-Gal-NAc-O-Ser (1) . It is to be expected that this compound can be employed for the preparation of fully synthetic immunogens for the development of monoclonal antibodies. 20-22",

The reported purification strategy 25 gave a compound 4 contaminated with phosphorylated nucleotides (CTP, CDP and CMP) and a small amount of CMP-Neu5Ac and Neu5Ac. However, it was found that highly pure 4 could be obtained by removal of inorganic salts by selective precipitation 31 in an ethanol-H 2 O mixture (9:1, v:v, twice) followed by size exclusion chromatography over extra fine Biogel P-2 using ammonium bicarbonate buffer as eluent at 4\u00b0C.",
