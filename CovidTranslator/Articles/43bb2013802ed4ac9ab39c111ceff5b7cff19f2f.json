The augmentation of the basis sets with diffuse functions showed a marked effect on the profile and barriers of the NO 2 torsional potential. Depending on the applied model chemistry, the heterocyclic ring in some 2-NPOs has proved to be non-planar. The non-planarity of the ring was characterized by Cremer-Pople puckering amplitude Q. The disruption of the ring planarity in some NPOs was accounted for the distinctive reactivity and impact sensitivity of these heterocycles. Consistently, the NBO and the AIM analyses furnished clear evidence for the accentuated weakness of the C-NO 2 bond and provided evidence for the electronic interplay between the NO 2 group, the fluorine substituent and the heterocyclic ring. Deletion of all off-diagonal Fock-matrix elements (NOSTAR) to separate hyperconjugative stabilizing interactions from steric interactions was used. The effect of nitration and fluorination on the aromaticity of the studied 2-NPOs was investigated by using the NICS descriptors NICS(1) and NICS(1) zz . These NICS indices have shown that the fluorination in para position to the nitro group exhibits the highest degree of aromaticity within the fluorinated 2-NPOs.",

These properties have qualified these compounds to be widely used in various fields of applications, e.g., as organocatalysts for asymmetric allylation of aldehydes [1] , as inhibitor of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase [2, 3] , as antiviral agent against various SARS coronavirus strains [4] , as antiadhesive and quorum-sensing inhibitor, and as antifungal agent [5] . Recent studies have shown that pyridine-N-oxide derivatives are genotoxic. The genotoxicity of this class of compounds is a consequence of damaging to DNA by affecting enzymes involved in DNA replication and the subsequent possible cell mutation which may lead to cancer [6] . Due to the conjugation of the nitro group with the N-oxide functional fragment 2-and 4-nitropyridine-N-oxides have been known as versatile intermediates in organic synthesis [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] .",

            "text": "Obviously, the substitution of pyridine-N-oxide with a strong electron withdrawing entity like the NO 2 functional group would lead to the alteration of the charge density distribution and the structural parameters within the heterocyclic system, and thus would widen the scope of its reactivity. The additional substitution of a ring hydrogen by a strong electronegative fluorine atom would certainly result in a sizable rearrangement of the electronic structure of the nitropyridine-N-oxide fragment. Depending on the relative positions of these electron withdrawing substituents to each other and to the N-oxide entity the impact of such kind of substitution on the reactivity of the entire molecule could be noticeable. Moreover, the insertion of the fluorine substituent to the nitropyridine-N-oxide leads to a marked distortion of the sterical arrangement of the nitro group and the ionicity of the N-oxide and N-O bonds of nitro group. Because of the proximity of these multifunctional substituents to each other and due to the electronic mediation of the aromatic system both, the deviation of the NO 2 and N-oxide groups from the co-planarity with the ring as well as the planarity of the heterocyclic ring itself are anticipated to be differently affected. The peculiar crowding of these particular substituents which are electronically coupled through the pyridine ring has qualified this class of multifunctional heteroarene compounds to become the focal point of interest for many researchers in different fields of applied sciences and technology. Nitro pyridine-N-oxides have been used in agriculture for plants growth rate regulation [12] , in photonics like the design and development of new organic nonlinear optical (NLO) materials for frequency doubling by means of secondharmonic generation (SHG) [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] .",

Interesting variations of the structural parameters of the stable rotamers, which correspond to minima on the predicted potential energy hypersurface, were observed. To ensure that these rotamers represent real minima but not saddle points on the potential energy surface we carried out frequency calculations (here and for all molecules occurring in this work) and only rotamers with no imaginary frequencies were considered. These stable out-of-plane rotamers result from a competing electronic interplay between the repulsive N-oxy and NO 2 group interaction on one hand and the attractive N=O\u00c1\u00c1\u00c1H interaction on the other hand.",

            "text": "Our calculations have shown that surprisingly the insertion of the NO 2 group in the ortho position to the N-oxide fragment has no significant effect on the structural parameters of pyridine-oxide (PO). By applying the MP2/ aug-cc-pVDZ chemistry, we found that the N-oxide bond in 2-NPO shortens only by 0.006 \u00c5 (Table 1) in comparison to PO (this work, supporting information Table S1 ) and the ring N-C 2 , C 2 -C 3 , and C 3 -C 4 bonds shorten only by 0.003, 0.003, and 0.004 \u00c5 , respectively (for atomic numbering see Fig. 1 ). The nitration of PO, however, exerts more distinct effect on the bonding angles. For instance the C 2 -N 1 -C 6 angle narrows by 1.7\u00b0and the N 1 -C 2 -C 3 angles widens by approximately 2.7\u00b0upon nitration of PO in ortho position. From Table 1 (in this table the Dunning's basis sets cc-pVDZ and cc-pVTZ are abbreviated as VDZ and VTZ and as AVDZ and AVTZ after their augmentation with diffuse functions), it can be seen that the values obtained from the density functional wave function are generally smaller by 0.005-0.01 \u00c5 than those provided by the MP2 method except for two cases, i.e., C 2 -N 8 and N 1 -O 7 , where the values are slightly larger. The variations of the bond angles as obtained from both methods are almost negligible. Only the N 1 -C 2 -N 8 bond angle widens by 3.3\u00b0when B3LYP/AVDZ is used. The application of the density functional method provides a second stable rotamer in addition to that one shown in Table 1 with a positive low frequency in which the O-N-O plane is perpendicular to the ring plane. However, the energy difference between the two rotamers of 0.02 kcal mol -1 is almost negligible which indicates that the appearance of a second rotamer most likely is an artifact generated by the density functional wave function and is due to the quite flat potential minimum as it will be shown later in this work. Strikingly, the MP2/AVDZ method suggests an eclipsed arrangement for the C 2 -N 8 and N 1 -O 7 bonds in contrast to all other levels of theory in Table 1 which provide a dihedral angle N 8 -C 2 -N 1 -O 7 deviating from zero and the N 8 -C 2 and N 1 -O 7 bonds are no more co-planar. Maybe of interest to note that the total dipole moment of PO increases by about 3 Debye on nitration in ortho position (from 5.2 to 8.1 D for PO and 2-NPO, respectively) emphasizing the asymmetric distribution of charges within 2-NPO and its accentuated polarity.",

Similar trend was also suggested by the B3LYP/aug-cc-pVDZ (Table S3 ) and by applying the same wave functions in combination with the 6-311??G(d,p) basis set (Table 2 ). This weakening of the C-NO 2 bond lends 3-NPO higher reactivity, and thus particular importance for technical and chemical applications. It is generally accepted that the C-NO 2 bond and its properties play a prominent role by the determination of the impact sensitivity of energetic materials [26] [27] [28] .

            "text": "Recently, Li et al. [29] published a theoretical study of several polynitropyridines and pyridine-N-oxides. Among the structures which these authors have optimized by applying B3LYP/6-311??G(d,p) were 2-, 3-, and 4-nitropyridine-N-oxide. The endocyclic N 1 -C 2 , N 1 -C 6 , and the C-NO 2 bond lengths in these NPOs were found to be 1.374, 1.378, 1.472 \u00c5 in 2-NPO, 1.369, 1.377, 1.485 \u00c5 in 3-NPO, and 1.377, 1.377, 1.464 \u00c5 in 4-NPO, respectively (only these bond lengths were cited in this paper). A comparison of these values with those which have been produced by applying the MP2/6-311??G(d,p) method (Table 2) shows that the latter model chemistry predicts N 1 -C 2 , N 1 -C 6 bond lengths which are longer by 0.010 and 0.012 \u00c5 in 2-NPO, 0.018, 0.015 \u00c5 in 3-NPO, and 0.011, 0.011 \u00c5 in 4-NPO. In contrast, the C-NO 2 bond length is shorter by 0.014, 0.007, and 0.002 \u00c5 in 2-NPO, 3-NPO, and 4-NPO, respectively. Similar result was obtained from the comparison of the computed structure of PNPO by applying B3LYP and MP2 wave functions in combination with the 6-311?G(d,p) basis set. As is evident from Table 2 , the MP2/6-311?G(d,p) method provides a N 1 -C 2 (6) bond length which is by 0.015 \u00c5 longer than that produced by the density functional method. However, the perturbation computational method suggests for the three C-NO 2 bond distances, C 2(3)(4) -NO 2 values which are by 0.022, 0.020, and 0.019 \u00c5 shorter than it was predicted by the B3LYP/6-311?G(d,p) levels. Interestingly, comparable behavior of the ring N-C and C-NO 2 bond lengths was obtained by applying the MP2 and B3LYP wave functions in combination with Dunning aug-cc-pVDZ basis set (Table S3 ). It is worth to point out that the crowding of the electron-rich substituents in PNPO leads to an apparent deviation of the ring skeleton from planarity, which is manifested in the puckering amplitude value of Q = 0.028 \u00c5 (Table 2 ) and the dihedral angle N 1 -C 2 -C 3 -C 4 of 2.8\u00b0. Based on the abovedemonstrated dependency of the C-NO 2 bond length on the employed level of theory, it is worth to indicate that using the Fig. 1 Atomic numbering of pyridine-N-oxide, ortho-, meta-, para-nitropyridine-N-oxide Table 2 Structural parameters of 2-nitropyridine-N-oxide (2-NPO), 3-nitropyridine-N-oxide (3-NPO), 4-nitropyridine-N-oxide (4-NPO), and penta-nitro-pyridine-N-oxide (PNPO), as obtained from MP2/ 6- computed lengthening of the C-NO 2 bond (and thus its weakening) is not primarily appropriate criterion for the determination of the impact sensitivity of energetic materials. Chiang et al. [30] determined the structure of 4-NPO by means of the electron diffractions method. A comparison between the calculated structural parameters which we obtained from the MP2/aug-cc-pVDZ method with the experimentally determined values [30] reveals that the experimental values are quite unreasonable. So for instance, the electron diffraction study provided 1.281 (22) and 1.469(66) \u00c5 for the N-O and C 2 -N 1 bond distances, whereas our calculations predict 1.267 and 1.391 \u00c5 . Particularly striking is the C-NO 2 bond length of 1.628(13) \u00c5 versus our calculated value of 1.461 \u00c5 . All these evident discrepancies indicate that the experimental study of the structure of 4-NPO needs to be revisited. In the same electron diffraction investigation, the molecular structure of 4-chloropyridine-N-oxide (4-ClPO) was determined as well. The optimized structure 4-ClPO (MP2/aug-cc-pVDZ was used) revealed that reasonable agreement between the observed N-oxide bond length of 1.262(25) \u00c5 and the calculated value of 1.269 \u00c5 exists but a significant disagreement for all other structural parameters (differences of \u00b10.03 to \u00b10.05 \u00c5 for the bond lengths and up to 5\u00b0for the bond angles) is apparent which also necessitates the experimental reinvestigation of this molecule.",

Numerous papers have been published over the last four decades in which the reasons for the remarkable properties of nitropyridine-N-oxides and their derivatives have been investigated. Mainly intramolecular interactions of various kinds and charge redistribution as a result of substitution have been made accountable for their chemical reactivity, remarkable magnetic and optical properties, and versatile biological activity. However, to the best of our knowledge never before has the contribution of the nonplanarity of these heteroaromatics been considered for the elucidation of these particular properties. We strongly believe that the enforced disruption of the planarity of these heterocyclic compounds and the resulting extra strain play a prominent role by the enhancement of the chemical and biological activity of this class of molecules, e.g., impact sensitivity for characterizing high energy density materials and genotoxicity.",

Such an effect is likely to anticipate since the charge shift towards the fluorine atom and its ability to hyperconjugate with the aromatic ring system by donating lone pair electrons into adjacent antibonding orbital (negative hyperconjugative interaction) and to exert exchange repulsive interaction (Pauli-repulsion) would contribute to pronounced charge density redistribution within the 2-NPO molecular system. In this context, we performed quantum chemical calculations at various level of model chemistry: 2-nitropyridine-X-Fluoro-N-oxide (X = 3, 4, 5, and 6) and 2-nitropyridine-3,4,5,6tetrafluoro-N-oxide (2-NPO-F4).",

The consequences of the neighborhood of the fluorine atom to the N 1 -O 7 bond in 2-NPO-6-F are: (i) shortening of the N 1 -O 7 bond in comparison to the remaining fluoro derivatives, and (ii) narrowing of the C 2 -N 1 -C 6 bond angle ( Table 3) . Inspection of the NBO analysis results reveals that there is no direct electronic interaction between the fluorine atom and the adjacent oxygen atom. However, in the NBO space, the second-order perturbation energy for the n p \u00f0 \u00de F ! r \u00c3 \u00f0N 1 \u00c0C 6 \u00de charge delocalization is 12.1 kcal mol -1 . Therefore, the latter hyperconjugative interaction is the reason for the aforementioned alterations of the N 1 -O 7 bond length and the C 2 -N 1 -C 6 bond angle.

            "text": "Remarkably, neither the successive monofluorination on all positions of the pyridine ring nor the tetrafluorination has a sizable effect on the bond lengths in comparison to the non-fluorinated 2-NPO. The largest variation of 0.009 \u00c5 is attributed to the C 3 -C 4 bond length in 2-NPO-3-F and 2-NPO-4-F. On the other hand, while the C-F bond in 2-NPO-4-F and 2-NPO-5-F lengthens by 0.007 and 0.005 \u00c5 in comparison to 2-NPO-3-F, this bond shortens significantly by 0.019 \u00c5 in 2-NPO-6-F. Obviously, this latter bond contraction is due to hyperconjugative interactions with the neighboring N-oxide fragment. For the same reason while the expected shortening of the C-F bond is almost negligible upon the progressive fluorine substitution in meta and para positions in 2-nitro-3,4,5,6-tetrafluoropyridine-N-oxide (2-NPO-F4) this shortening becomes notable (0.016 \u00c5 ) for the C-F bond in ortho position. Such C-F bond shortening in 2-NPO-6-F and in 2-NPO-F4 is to some extent surprising because the NBO analysis has predicted that the occupancy of the p N 1 \u00c0C 6 NBO remains almost constant in all monofluorinated 2-NPO, i.e., 1.722-1.728 electrons (in 2-NPO-F4 is 1.744 e -). Similarly, the Table 3 Structural parameters of the fluoro derivatives of 2-NPO: 2-NPO-X-Fluoro (X = 3, 4, 5, 6, and 3-4-5-6) as predicted by MP2/augcc-pVDZ (Table 3) show that there is an attractive interaction between the fluorine atom and the nitro group in 3-NPO-3-F and rather more accentuated attractive interaction between the fluorine substituent and the N-oxide oxygen in 2-NPO-6-F and 2-NPO-F4. In these instances where the F\u2026O distance is between 2.6 and 3.3 \u00c5 , it appears that the attractive fluorine-oxygen dispersion interaction is the predominant effect in comparison to the repulsive Pauli exchange interaction. This finding is in agreement with the very recently discussed importance of the dispersion energy by the stabilization of large molecules by means of intramolecular dispersion interaction between, e.g., functional groups [31] . Another intriguing feature is that the geometrical parameters of the nitro group in all fluorinated compounds which are shown in Table 3 are insensitive to the charge density variation of the heterocyclic ring as a consequence of the charge withdrawal by the fluorine atoms. The opening of the endocyclic angles involving the anchor atoms for the fluorine substitution can be explained by invoking the r-electron withdrawing ability of the fluorine substituent. In all fluorinated 2-NP-N-oxides in Table 3 , the contribution of the r-character to the natural atomic hybrid orbital of the carbon anchor atom on which fluorine is substituted amount only to 23-24 % indicating the loss of r-electrons upon fluorination. In addition, as it will be shown later the second-order perturbation energy significantly favors the hyperconjugative bond-antibond interaction between the p 2 electron lone pair of the fluorine atom and the C anchor -C antibond which contributes to the widening of these angles.",

Without going into further details of the computational results, it is interesting to note that surprisingly except for few instances such a halogen substitution has generally a little effect on the bond lengths and bond angles of the 2-nitro-N-oxide moiety. Predominantly some bond distances and bond angles in 2-NPO-6-Cl and 2-NPO-Cl4 show some noticeable differences when compared to the fluorine counterparts. For instance by using the MP2/aug-cc-pVDZ method the N 1 -C 6 and C 5 -C 6 bond lengths in 2-NPO-6-Cl are by 0.008 and 0.011 \u00c5 longer than in 2-NPO-6-F. From the comparison of structural parameters of 2-NPO-Cl4 and 2-NPO-F4, it emerges that the N 1 -C 6 , C 3 -C 4 , C 4 -C 5 , and C 5 -C 6 are by 0.016, 0.013, 0.012, and 0.013 \u00c5 , respectively, longer in the former than in the latter compound. It is also worth to note that the NO 2 plane in 2-NPO-6-Cl is perpendicular to the ring plane which is in contrast to the arrangement of the nitro group in the corresponding fluoro compound (Table 3 ). All these structural trends have also been reproduced by applying the B3LYP wave function and the Gaussian basis set 6-311??G(df,pd).",

Table 4 summarizes the most important structural parameters of these fluorinated pyridine-N-oxides as suggested by the MP2/aug-cc-pVDZ calculations. From the comparison of Tables 3 and 4, it emerges that the absence of the nitro group has almost negligible effect on the ring bond distances. Conspicuously is that the N-oxide as well as the C-F bond lengths in all nitrated homologues are by 0.004 to 0.008 \u00c5 shorter than the corresponding bonds in the fluoro pyridine-N-oxide counterparts. In contrast to the bond lengths the endocyclic bond angles vary more significantly and non-uniform in both series. The largest variations show the angles N 1 -C 2 -C 3 and C 2 -C 3 -C 4 . For instance, the N 1 -C 2 -C 3 angle in Fig. 2 Atomic numbering of mono-and tetra-fluorinated 2-nitropyridine-N-oxide 2-NPO-3-F is by 2.5\u00b0larger and the C 2 -C 3 -C 4 angle is by 2.0\u00b0smaller than in 3-F-PO. Similarly, the former angle widens by 2.4\u00b0and the latter one narrows by 1.6\u00b0on moving from 2-NPO-6-F to 6-F-PO. Moreover, we note that the nitration of the fluoro-pyridine-N-oxides leads to the anticipated increase of the molecular dipole moment and the largest increase of 3.6 D occurs on going from 3-F-PO to 2-NPO-3-F.",

From Table 5 , it is apparent that the insertion of the nitro group in ortho position to the N-oxide moiety results in a withdrawal of charges from the ring atoms and the N-oxide oxygen. The substitution of hydrogens in different positions of 2-NPO by a fluorine atom does not show a clear systematic variation of the charge distribution in this diversity of fluoro 2-NPO compounds. The reason for that could be the alteration of the charge distribution within the ring represents a compromise between two competing effects of substituents: the strong negative inductive and resonance effects of the nitro group (increased electron density in meta position) and the negative inductive and positive resonance effects of the fluorine atom (higher electron density in ortho and para positions). The largest loss of charges, however, shows the C 6 atom of ?0.63 e -(?0.61 eas produced by MP2/augcc-pVDZ, Table S5 ) in 2-NPO-6-F. Also in this compound, the charge of the N 1 atom of ?0.007 e -(?0.03 e -) is close to neutrality and the N-oxide bond possesses a distinct polarity within this series of fluorinated 2-NPOs.

As is shown in Table 3 , the C-F bond length in 2-NPO-4-F is the largest (1.355 \u00c5 ) within the fluorinated 2-NPOs which Table 6 Mulliken atomic charges of pyridine- support such way of elucidation. Another possible rationalization of this feature is that the intramolecular dispersion stabilization interaction in all other fluorinated 2-NPOs is more predominant than in 2-NPO-4-F. While in the monofluorinated 2-NPO derivatives, the variation of the charge density within the ring results from a compromise between the directionality of the nitro group and the fluorine atom, in monofluorinated PO, however, such charge redistribution is dictated only by the ortho and para directionality of the fluorine atom. Therefore, in all monofluorinated PO derivatives which are shown in Table  S9 those ring atoms which are in ortho and para positions possess higher charge density than all remaining ring atoms.",

            "text": "A comparison between the Mulliken population analysis (MPA) and the natural charge distribution for all pyridine-N-oxide derivatives (Tables 5, 6) shows that evident discrepancy exists between the results provided by both charge distribution procedures. For instance, in contrast to the NPA, the MPA suggests negatively charged hydrogen atoms and positive charges on the carbon atoms. Moreover, regardless the significant differences in the evaluation of the charge distribution by both methods, the MPA seems to overestimate the charge depletion and concentration between atoms in a bond. For example in 2-NPO-4-F, the MPA predicts charges of ?0.24 on N 1 and -0.78 on O 7 , while the NPA suggests ?0.04 and -0.52 eon these atoms, and thus different degree of bond polarity. By using different wave functions (B3LYP, HF, MP2) and the basis sets (6-311??G(df,pd) and aug-cc-pVDZ) to examine the dependency of both the NPA and Mulliken charge distribution on the level of theory, we found that the MPA provides inconsistent, and in some cases unreasonably fluctuating charge distribution. Most remarkably the MPA at the B3LYP/6-311??G(df,pd) level predicts for the NO 2 group negative charges on nitrogen and positive charges on the oxygen atoms (Table S7) leading to a bond polarity of the type: O ? -N --O ? . However, by using the HF/ 6-311??G(df,pd) method, it provides negative charges on nitrogen as well as on the oxygens (Table S8) . This example confirms the previously and repeatedly cited inconsistency of the Mulliken charge distribution and its basis set dependency [37] [38] [39] .",

Zhang et al. postulated that there is a relationship between the total Mulliken charges of the NO 2 group (i.e., the sum of the partial charges of the nitrogen and oxygen atoms) and the molecular stability and structure of a variety of nitrobenzene derivatives (the so-called nitro group charge method [43] ). These authors found that the larger the negative charge of the nitro group, Q NO 2 , the shorter (the stronger) the R-NO 2 bond and the higher the stability of the nitroaromatic compounds. It is worth to note that Zhang et al. [44, 45] considered the impact sensitivity (which is defined as the height H50 from where a given weight falling upon the compound gives 50 % probability on initiating an explosion) as a measure for the stability of energetic materials. We extended this concept and considered the total charges of the ring atoms and each of the ring substituents and investigated whether these total charges can provide useful and direct indications of any alterations of the structural parameters in the substituted pyridine-N-oxides that we discussed above.",

From this table, it is evident that the nitration of the PO in ortho position results in a reduction of the natural charges of the ring by 0.353 edue to the strong electron withdrawal ability of the nitro group. Adding a fluorine substituent next to the nitro group, 2-NPO-3-F, leads to an additional loss of the ring charges by 0.533 e -, and thus the net charge of the ring becomes positive. It seems that the variation of the Table 7 Total natural charges of the pyridine ring Q ring , the nitro group Q NO2 , the methyl group Q CH3 in pyridine-N-oxide (PO), 2-nitropyridine-N-oxide (2-NPO) in addition to 3-methyl-2-nitropyridine-N-oxide (3-methyl-2-NPO), 5-methyl-2-nitropyridine-N-oxide (5-methyl-2-NPO) and their 6-fluoro derivatives fluorine position on the ring does not markedly affect the Q ring value. The considerable increase of the positive charges of the ring of Q ring = ?1.84 ein 2-NPO-F4 was obviously expected due to the appreciable electron withdrawal by the four fluorine atoms. Such kind of consideration is also valid for the tetrafluoro PO. Interestingly, the fluorination of the PO ring in meta position (3-F-PO) leads to a loss of ring charges of 0.54 e -, which is comparable to the reduction of ring charge (0.53 e -) on going from 2-NPO to 2-NPO-3-F. Table 7 shows that substantial variation of the Q ring value by the nitration or fluorination of PO in ortho position to the N-oxide fragment occurs. It is also worth noting that the largest loss of ring charges within the monofluorinated derivatives occurs on going from PO to 2-NPO-4-F, where DQ ring is 0.91 e -, and the smallest loss of charges emerges upon moving from PO to 2-NPO-6-F, where DQ ring amounts to 0.88 e -. This is because of the fluorine hyperconjugative effect and the increase of the charge density in ortho position and the higher electronegativity of the oxygen atom. From Table 7 , it can be seen that the fluorination of PO leads to a significant loss of ring charges ranging from 0. Table 7 also shows the loss of ring charge of 0.53 eupon the fluorination of 3-and 5-methyl-2-NPO in ortho position to the N-oxide group is significantly large. Remarkably is that the methyl group seems to donate approximately the same amount of natural charges into the heteroaromatic system regardless the nitration in position 2 and fluorination in various positions on the ring which is reflected by the similar Q CH 3 values in Table 7 .",

Such finding is in agreement with the postulated correlation between the negative charges of the nitro group, Q NO 2 , and the C-NO 2 bond strength [40] [41] [42] . Following this relationship, Table 7 demonstrates that 5-methyl-2-NPO is the most stable and 2-NPO-F4 is the least stable compound. Consequently, the latter compound possesses in comparison to the former one larger impact sensitivity (smaller H50 value). Perhaps of interest to note that in contrast to the findings of Zhang et al. [40] we found that using the Q NO 2 Mulliken charges (Table S10) instead of the natural charges (Table 7) for the nitropyridine-N-oxide compounds leads to an apparent disagreement with this Q NO 2 =R NO 2 relationship. So for instance the largest Q NO 2 Mulliken charge is -0.734 for 3-methyl-2-NPO and the smallest value is -0.634 for 2-NPO-5-F, but the C-NO 2 bond lengths are 1.477 and 1.467 \u00c5 , respectively, which is clearly inconsistent with the Zhang relationship.

The combination of this basis set with MP2 and B3LYP wave functions suggested a doubleminimum potential at c = 56\u00b0and 124\u00b0 (Fig. S1 ). The addition of diffuse functions to the Dunning double-zeta basis set produces the most conspicuous alteration of the shape of the torsional potential energy functions. From Fig. 3d , it is evident that this augmentation of the basis set leads to the appearance of a single minimum potential at 90\u00b0in the case of the HF wave function (instead of doubleminimum potential without augmentation) and a broad flat potential well over the range of c = 50\u00b0-140\u00b0occurs when the MP2 and B3LYP wave functions are used. Many attempts have been undertaken by using different starting values for the torsional angle, c, to find the global potential energy minimum for 2-NPO but in summary we obtained optimized values for c ranging from 83\u00b0to 93\u00b0with almost negligible differences of the total energy and very low positive frequencies.",

For instance, the scan analysis of the internal rotation of the nitro group in 2-NPO by using the HF and MP2 methods in combination with the cc-pVDZ basis set (Fig. 3c) indicates that the application of different wave functions has almost no effect on the trend of the potential function. Nevertheless, the barrier heights at c = 0\u00b0and c = 90\u00b0drop from 2.27 to 0.23 and from 1.52 to 0.99 kcal mol -1 upon using the HF instead of the MP2 wave function. Employing the B3LYP wave function, however, leads to an inversion of the barrier heights at c = 0\u00b0and c = 90\u00b0which means that in contrast to above mentioned methods the density functional method predicts a barrier at c = 90\u00b0which is by 0.9 kcal mol -1 higher than that at c = 0\u00b0. Likewise, the application of the same wave functions in combination with the Pople double-zeta basis set for scanning the NO 2 rotational potential function provides analogous trend. Interestingly, similar dependency of the NO 2 torsional potential function on the applied wave function was obtained for various fluorinated 2-NPOs whose NO 2 torsional potential functions exhibit two distinctive energy maxima at c = 0\u00b0and c = 90\u00b0, i.e., 2-NPO-4-F, 2-NPO-5-F, and 2-NPO-6-F (Figs. 4, 5) . The application of the MP2/cc-pVDZ computational method predicts potential barriers for the NO 2 internal rotation in these compounds (Fig. 4c, e, 5a) ndergo an inversion upon the alteration of the wave function (and a slight shift of the potential minima) which parallels the behavior of the potential barriers in 2-NPO. It remains to point out that using Pople's triple-zeta basis set along with the MP2 and B3LYP wave functions for scanning the NO 2 rotational potential barriers has shown that only in the case of 2-NPO-5-F (not in 2-NPO-4-F and 2-NPO-6-F) such an inversion of the barrier heights occurs (Fig. 4e) .",

Figures 4 and 5 compare the potential energy functions resulting from augmentation of the 6-311 and cc-pVDZ basis sets by diffuse functions on all atoms with those which were obtained from non-augmented basis sets. Figure 4a shows that for 2-NPO-3-F similar profiles of the potential functions for the internal rotation of the NO 2 group were obtained by using the MP2 and B3LYP wave functions in combination with Pople triple-zeta and Dunning double-zeta basis sets.

The augmented Dunning correlation consistent basis set produces with B3LYP and MP2 a single minimum potential at c = 90\u00b0and an increase of the potential barrier at c = 0\u00b0by 2.0 and 1.5 kcal mol -1 , respectively, demonstrating that both model chemistries describe the intramolecular interactions in 2-NPO-F4 equally well.

Nevertheless, the potential barrier at c = 0\u00b0rises by *1.0 and 1.2 kcal mol -1 (Fig. 5d) . Interesting features emerge from the comparison of the potential functions in 2-NPO, 2-NPO-6-F, and 2-NPO-3-F as produced by MP2/aug-cc-pVDZ. For 2-NPO and 2-NPO-6-F, a flat broad minimum ranging from c = 60\u00b0to c = 120\u00b0was obtained. However, in the case of 2-NPO-3-F, the potential function shows a distinctive minimum at c = 90\u00b0 (Fig. 4b) . From this comparison, it can be concluded that the nitro group in both instances, where either the fluorine substituent is absent (2-NPO) or is not in ortho position to the nitro group (2-NPO-6-F), this group performs a large amplitude motion, which is manifested by the flat broad minimum as Figs. 3d and 5b demonstrate. On the other hand, the seemingly attractive interaction between the nitro group and the fluorine atom in 2-NPO-3-F suppresses such large amplitude motion which is evident from the sharp potential minimum at c = 90\u00b0.",

            "text": "Assuming that steric interactions and intramolecular hydrogen bonding do not play a prominent role by the determination of rotational barriers in the investigated 2-NPOs, it can be postulated that the shorter the C-NO 2 bond (the larger the bond strength), the higher is the barrier for internal rotation of the nitro group. Chen et al. [46, 47] and others [48] have found that such correlation is excellently applicable to a variety of aromatic nitro compounds. This correlation seems to be invalid for the series of heteroaromatics which we presented in this work. From Table 3 , it is evident that the C-NO 2 bond length varies only marginally within the fluoronitropyridine-N-oxides, but on the other side, the potential barriers for the NO 2 internal rotation fluctuate over a wide scale of potential energy no matter which computational method is used. For instance, by applying MP2/aug-cc-pVDZ the potential barrier at c = 0\u00b0varies between 1.9 kcal mol -1 for 2-NPO-4-F and 7.6 kcal mol -1 for 2-NPO-3-F (Fig. 4b, d) . Further, MP2/6-311??G(df,pd) predicts a variation of this barriers ranging from 3.2 kcal mol -1 in 2-NPO-4-F to 8.5 kcal mol -1 in 2-NPO-3-F, whereas the alteration of the C-NO 2 bond length within these fluorinated 2-NPOs amounts only to \u00b10.001 \u00c5 . One conceivable interpretation of this striking behavior is that the barrier heights for the internal rotation of the nitro group in the fluorinated heterocyclic series depends on the proximity or remoteness of the fluorine substituent to the nitro or the N-oxide fragment. These barriers are predominantly governed either by attractive intramolecular fluorine-oxygen dispersion interaction or O_H hydrogen bonding but less by mesomeric or hyperconjugative interactions and an increase of the C-NO 2 bond strength.",

For more profound rationalization of the latter interaction, we carried out an NBO deletion analysis by applying the NOSTAR (deletion of all antibonding and Rydberg orbitals), NOVIC, and NOGEM (deletion of all vicinal and all geminal bond-antibond interactions, respectively) algorithms. Furthermore, the most relevant specific donor/ acceptor interactions have been switched off to obtain details about their quantitative contributions to the total electronic delocalization energy of the studied 2-NPOs. We also analyzed the delocalization energies as estimated by the second-order perturbation theory (SOPT) in the NBO space.

Perhaps the most essential features which have been provided by this analysis were the demonstration of the prominent role of the lone pair electrons by the determination of the structure and rotamers stability of the fluorinated 2-NPOs under consideration and thus of their potential energy function. In this context, it is worth to note that in all these compounds, the lone electron pair orbitals (n p2 ) on the oxygen atoms in the N-oxide and NO 2 groups have the lowest orbital charge population and, therefore, the most significant deviation from the idealized Lewis occupancy. For instance, the n p2 orbitals on the N-oxide oxygen, O 7 , are occupied by 1.62, 1.65, 1.58, 1.63, and 1.63 electrons (at the B3LYP/ 6-311??G(df,pd) level) in 2-NPO-3-F, 2-NPO-4-F, 2-NPO-5-F, 2-NPO-6-F, and 2-NPO-F4, respectively, which is way off from the Lewis occupancy. This appreciable loss of electronic charges is mainly due to delocalization of electrons from these occupied orbitals to the vacant non-Lewis antibond orbital p \u00c3 N 1 \u00c0C 6 . As is apparent from Table  8 , the SOPT approach indicates that the perturbation energy for this charge delocalization at the B3LYP/6-311??G(df,pd) level is considerably large and amounts to 58.5, 62. (Table S11) . It is also noticeable that in 2-NPO, 2-NPO-3-F, 2-NPO-4-F, and 2-NPO-5-F, the donor-acceptor hyperconjugative interaction n p1 \u00f0 \u00de O 7 ! r \u00c3 N1\u00c0C2 is energetically more favored than the n p1 \u00f0 \u00de O 7 ! r \u00c3 N1\u00c0C6 charge transfer.

One possible explanation for this disparity is the deviation of the NO 2 group from co-planarity with the heteroaromatic ring and the -sc/ac arrangement of the N=O bonds. (Table 3) . Beside the various donor-acceptor p-p* resonance delocalization interactions within the heteroaromatic ring, the interaction between the fluorine lone electron pairs and the different non-Lewis orbitals plays a crucial role by the donor/acceptor stabilization of the fluorinated 2-NPOs under consideration. Table 8 indicates that the most significant fluorine lone pair hyperconjugative interaction occurs between the (n p2 ) F orbitals and the antibonding p* orbitals of the adjacent ring C=C bonds. The E(2) stabilization energy for this donoracceptor interaction amounts to 21.9, 22.1, and 20. kcal mol -1 .

From Table 8 , it can additionally be seen that the E(2) values for the lone electron pair transfer from the n p1 \u00f0 \u00de O 9 and n p1 \u00f0 \u00de O 10 donor orbitals to the r \u00c3 C 2 \u00c0N 8 antibond acceptor orbital, n p1 \u00f0 \u00de O9;O10 ! p \u00c3 C 2 \u00c0N 8 , vary approximately between 13 and 17 kcal mol -1 which indicates the strengthening of the C 2 -N 8 bond by such kind of orbital interactions.",

As it can be seen from Table 9 , the deletion of all fluorine hyperconjugative interactions in 2-NPO-3-F leads to the highest electronic delocalization energy, E del , of 150.5 kcal mol -1 . The smallest E del value of 107 kcal. mol -1 (which represents 7.5 % of the total deletion energy that was obtained by using the NOSTAR deletion option) emerges by switching off all fluorine donor-acceptor interactions in 2-NPO-4-F. This peculiar small contribution of the fluorine hyperconjugative interaction to the total delocalization energy manifests that 2-NPO-4-F is mostly stabilized by the donor-acceptor interactions of the remaining NBOs in addition to p-delocalization (conjugation) and dispersion interactions. From Table 9 , it can be concluded that generally the fluorine Lewis-non-Lewis interactions play only a moderate role by the stabilization of the listed 2-NPOs except in the case of 2-NPO-F4. In this case, the contribution of the fluorines hyperconjugative stabilizing interactions to the total non-Lewis energy E NL (=E del ) amounts to approximately 30 % of the total deletions energy on zeroing all donor-acceptor natural orbital interactions.",

From Bader's AIM theory, valuable information about bonding properties in molecules and the reasons for their structural stability can be concluded. In addition, changes in charge density distribution, q(r), mirror the effects of substituents and thus the variation of the Laplacian of the charge density, r 2 q(r c ) (which is the algebraic sum of the three eigenvalues, k 1 , k 2 , k 3 of the charge density at a bond point), allows for a three dimensional representation of these effects. Table 10 summarizes some topological properties of q(r) (atomic units are used), which we obtained from the AIM analysis for pyridine, pyridine-N-oxide, and 2-NPO. Table 11 shows these properties at all (3,-1) 1 bond critical points in the fluorinated derivatives of 2-NPO by applying the B3LYP/6-311??G(df,pd) (for the results obtained from MP2/aug-cc-pVDZ level see Tables S12 and S13).",

From the NICS(1) values in Table 12 , it can be generally concluded that neither the N-oxidation of pyridine nor its nitration or fluorination noticeably affects the aromaticity of the parent molecule. These values also reveal that the 2-NPO-F4 exposes the largest aromatic character followed by 2-NPO-5-F, 2-NPO-3-F, 2-NPO-6-F, and 2-NPO-4-F, respectively. As Table 12 additionally shows the nonfluorinated compounds, pyridine-N-oxide and 2-NPO, exhibit almost the same degree of aromaticity as in pyridine indicating the little influence of the diatropicity of pyridine ring by N-oxidation and nitration in ortho position. A comparison of the NICS(1) values for the fluorinated 2-NPO and pyridine-N-oxides (POs) shows that the nitro group leads to a slight increase of the electron delocalization and thus to higher aromatic character (diatropicity) of the fluorinated pyridine-N-oxides. One exception within this series of compounds is provided by the fluorination in ortho position where the NICS(1) value slightly decreases (by 0.6 ppm) upon nitration. However, it should be noted that all differences of the NICS(1) value which are less than 1 ppm are marginal and lie within the uncertainty limits of these values. Aside from that, the NICS index has generally proven to be to some extent dependent on the computational level of theory. For example although the trend of the NICS(1) values which have been obtained from the B3LYP/6-311??G(df,pd) (Table S14) is roughly consistent with the HF/6-311??G(df,pd) results, however, the density functional method predicts a decrease of the aromaticity of the pyridine ring upon N-oxidation (NICS(1) for pyridine is -10.4 and for pyridine-N-oxide -8.8) and a slight increase of the aromaticity of pyridine-N-oxide on nitration in ortho position to the N-oxide group (Table  S14) .",

            "text": "Without going into further details, it is of importance to note that in a vast number of papers it has been elaborately shown that (depending on the size of the ring) the in-plane aromaticity which is indicated by the isotropic NICS(0) value contains considerable contribution of in-plane r-aromaticity resulting from the diamagnetic shielding of the r electronic framework. Although the NICS(1) value is a better descriptor of the p contribution to aromaticity due to the apparent decrease of the local contributions of the r framework at larger distances from the ring center, however, this value is still related to the total isotropic shielding and thus is contaminated by r contributions. A largely separation of the r aromaticity from the out-of-plane p aromaticity was achieved by the introduction of new NICS descriptor which considers the out-of-plane zz components of the shielding tensor elements at a certain distance n in \u00c5 above the ring plane designated as NICS(n) zz . NICS(1) zz is defined as the MO contribution to the zz component of the shielding tensor perpendicular to the ring plane. Since this NICS zz index still incorporates some non-p contributions a new more specific measure for the pure p-aromaticty was introduced (NICS pzz ) which takes into account only the p contributions to the out-of-plane NICS tensor component arising from the canonical molecular orbitals with p character [69, 70] . However, on various occasions it has been pointed out that NICS(1) zz is easily computable and is an excellently performing aromaticity descriptor. Therefore, it represents an adequate substitute for NICS pzz [70] . Moreover, recently it was also shown that the NICS(1) zz value denotes the highest degree of aromaticity for aromatic systems [71] . Based on these observations we focused on the NICS(1) zz index to elucidate the variation of the degree of aromaticity in all fluorinated and nonfluorinated 2-NPOs and pyridine-N-oxides. Assuming that the non-planarity of some of the compounds which are displayed in Table 12 has only marginal effect on the NICS zz tensor component perpendicular to the ring plane, the following conclusions can be derived from the evaluation of the NICS(1) zz values for these compounds: delocalization in these two molecules that is predominantly caused by the fluorine substituent in ortho position to the N-oxide moiety. It is worth to point out that a noticeable discrepancy exists between the trends of the alteration of the aromaticity on moving from one homologue to the other mirrored by the NICS(1) and NICS(1) zz values (Tables 12 and S14). However, the variation of the latter NICS index reflects more reliably the influence of the substitution on the aromaticity of these heterocyclic systems since it is dominated by p contributions to the NICS zz tensor.",

            "text": "1. Remarkably, the successive fluorination of 2-NPO has little influence on its geometrical parameters. On the other hand, while the C-F bond in 2-NPO-3-F, 2-NPO-4-F, and 2-NPO-5-F remains essentially unaffected this bond shortens significantly by 0.019 \u00c5 in 2-NPO-6-F. This bond contraction is due to hyperconjugative interactions with the neighboring N-oxide fragment which has been confirmed by the NBO analysis and the delocalization energy calculated by SOPT. 2. A large variety of NPOs with different kinds of substituents like F, Cl, CH 3 and additional NO 2 groups has been examined in order to get more insight into the reasons leading to the alteration of the structure, aromaticity and the intramolecular stabilizing or destabilizing interactions between substituent/heteroaromatic ring and between substituents themselves including the N-oxide fragment. 3. Analogous to the known relationship between the total Mulliken charges of the NO 2 group, Q NO 2 , and the conformational stability and structures of a variety of nitrobenzene derivatives, we introduced the corresponding total charges for the pyridine ring, (Q ring ), and methyl group (Q CH 3 ). For forming these total charges, we used the less basis set-dependent natural charges. It was shown that the group charges, Q, are basically indicative for occurring electronic effects, but they do not provide indications of directionality of substitution on the heteroaromatic ring since due to their inductive or resonance effects and their relative positions to each other. All these factors may lead to additive or opposing subtracting effects which dictate the reactivity of ring in the NPOs molecular systems and its readiness for electrophilic or nucleophilic attack. 4. This work has also shown that the variation of the basis set and its augmentation with diffuse functions (and in some instances the alteration of the wave function as well) has tremendous impact on the profile, conformational stability and the barrier height for internal rotation of the NO 2 group. The computational results clearly demonstrate that particular caution should be exercised when investigating energy minima on the potential energy hypersurface by performing quantum mechanical calculations and applying various basis sets (and wave functions) at different levels of theory. 5. Not only the size of the selected basis set has profound influence on the potential barrier for internal rotation of the nitro group but also the fluorine substitution. Hyperconjugative interactions as well as electrostatic and Pauli-exchange repulsive interactions (steric effects) are accountable for the alteration of the potential barrier within the fluorinated heteroaromatics which have been presented in this study.",

Switching off all antibonding and Rydberg off-diagonal Fock-matrix elements (NOSTAR deletion) in the NBO space has revealed that 2-NPO-5-F is the most stable molecule among the monofluorinated 2-NPOs. From the D(E L ) values for the variety of fluorinated 2-NPOs, it was concluded that the Lewis energy E L favors 2-NPO-5-F over the other homologues. Consideration of D(E NL ) values revealed that 2-NPO-4-F is mainly stabilized by the delocalization of occupied NBOs into vacant antibonding orbitals. Interestingly, parallel trends have been observed for the chlorinated 2-NPOs. 7. One of the focal points of this study was the scrutiny of the C-NO 2 bond in the fluorinated and non-fluorinated 2-NPOs. As generally accepted, this bond plays a key role by the determination of the impact sensitivity of energetic [26] [27] [28] and genotoxic [6] materials. The NBO analysis has shown that the C-NO 2 bond is mainly stabilized by the n p1 \u00f0 \u00de O 9;10 ! r \u00c3 C 2 \u00c0N 8 orbital interactions. From the AIM results in Table 11 , it was apparent that the charges in the C-NO 2 bond in all fluorinated 2-NPOs are appreciably depleted which is a clear evidence for the accentuated weakness of this bond. From these results, it became apparent that all 2-NPOs (fluorinated and non-fluorinated) exhibit particular C-NO 2 bonding properties which classify them to be potential energetic materials (with high impact sensitivity).and perhaps biologically active agents. 8. Our calculations showed that the C-NO 2 bond length is fairly dependent on the employed level of theory; therefore, it is not appropriate to consider the computed C-NO 2 bond length for the assessment of the impact sensitivity of energetic materials. Also the known correlation between the C-NO 2 bond length and the barrier height for internal rotation of the nitro group (the shorter this bond the higher is the potential barrier) should be considered with caution (at least in similar heteroaromatics presented in this work). 9. Finally, two essential remarks have to be made concerning the topological properties of the charge density distribution and the various conclusions which have been derived from them: (1) The classification of bonds in shared interactions (covalent bond) and closed-shell interactions (polar or ionic bonds) and the consideration of the bond ellipticity as a measure for the extent of the p character contribution to a bond are not strictly direct consequences of the AIM quantum theory but only based on trends observed in the results which were obtained from a large number of theoretical calculations [64] . (2) These properties are inconsistent upon the variation of the level of the computational method in use.",

Obviously the insertion of four fluorine substituents to PO and 2-NPO results in a considerable loss of ring charges of DQ ring = 2.18 eand 2.17 e -, respectively. This result is somehow intriguing because the alteration of Q ring upon fluorination is almost the same in both cases regardless the nitration of PO in ortho position. The substitution of the methyl group in ortho and para positions to the nitro group in 2-NPO provides Q ring values which reflect to some extent the hyperconjugative interaction of the methyl group. A comparison between the Q ring values of 2-NPO-3-F and 3-methyl-2-NPO reveals that the substitution of the fluorine atom by the methyl group in ortho position to the nitro group increases the ring charge density by 0.34 e -. Similarly, the substitution of fluorine in 2-NPO-5-F by the electron donating CH 3 group (which is in para position to the nitro group) raises Q ring by 0.35 e -. As",

From these D(E L ) and D(E NL ) values, it can be concluded that the Lewis energy E L favors 2-NPO-5-F over all other monofluorinated 2-NPOs which implies that electrostatic and exchange repulsion interactions are predominant in this molecule. Consideration of the D(E NL ) discloses that 2-NPO-4-F is mainly stabilized by the delocalization of occupied NBOs into vacant antibonding orbitals.

In addition, the anisotropic charge distribution in these N=O bonds mirrored by the deviation of the ellipticity values from the typical value for a cylindrical charge distribution demonstrates the p character of this bond.
