            "text": "Hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) is an important public health problem that has emerged over the past several years. HFMD predominantly infects children under seven years old and occasionally causes severe disease in adults. Among the enteroviruses, enterovirus 71 (EV71) and coxsackievirus 16 (CA16) are the major causative agents of HFMD. In addition, adenovirus cocirculates with enterovirus and has become a possible additional pathogenic factor for HFMD in some cases. Here, we have investigated the neutralizing antibody responses to both enterovirus and adenovirus in adults, with the aim of exploring the prevalence trends of these viruses and the nature of protective immunity in humans to these viral infections. Sera from 391 healthy adults from 21 provinces and cities in China were tested for the presence of antibodies against EV71, CA16, adenovirus human serotype 5 (AdHu5) and chimpanzee adenovirus pan7 (AdC7) using neutralization tests. High seroprevalence rates of EV71, CA16 and AdHu5 were found in the population (85.7%, 58.8% and 74.2%, respectively). The coseropositivity rate of these three viruses was 39.4% (154 of 391), with median neutralizing antibody titers of 80, 40 and 640, respectively, and the neutralizing antibody titer for EV71 was found to be correlated with those of CA16 and AdHu5. AdC7 was found to be a rare adenovirus serotype in the human population, with a seropositivity rate of 11.8%, suggesting that it could be a good choice for a vaccine carrier that could be used in vaccine development.",

            "text": "The enterovirus genus of single-stranded RNA viruses includes poliovirus, coxsackie A virus, coxsackie B virus, echoviruses and other viruses that affects millions of people worldwide each year. Over 100 human enterovirus serotypes have been identified based on antibody neutralization tests, including enterovirus 71 (EV71) and coxsackievirus 16 (CA16), the main causative agents of hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD), which has emerged as an important public health problem in recent years, especially in Asia and Pacific regions. EV71 and CA16 usually infect infants and children under seven years old and present with a papulovesicular rash. 1 A few children suffer complications such as myocarditis, pulmonary edema and aseptic meningoencephalitis, which can be fatal. Occasionally, HFMD is observed in adults. 2, 3 The major pathogens responsible for HFMD differ across countries. In China, HFMD is primarily associated with EV71, which caused the outbreaks of HFMD in Anhui province in 2008, in Guangdong province in 2009 and in Jiangsu province in 2012. [4] [5] [6] However, in other countries, HFMD is mostly associated with CA16. 7 The seroprevalence trends of these two viruses are changing over time. There are no vaccines or antiviral drugs available for HFMD. Although immunoglobulins and the antiviral agent ribavirin are commonly used, their efficacy remains uncertain. 8 Thus, the development of effective vaccines to prevent HFMD is critical. Knowing the seroprevalence of EV71 and CA16 is necessary to generate a suitable and effective vaccine. The seroprevalence of EV71 and CA16 has been investigated in children and pregnant women, 6, [9] [10] [11] but little is known about the seroprevalence of these viruses in healthy adults, despite the fact that adults do suffer from HFMD and can present with serious symptoms. 2, 3 However, efforts to investigate the seroprevalence of these viruses in adults are increasing and may reflect the continued spread of these viruses.",

            "text": "Co-infection with enterovirus and a second virus, such as adenovirus, has been suggested as another possible pathogenic factor for HFMD. 12 Adenoviruses are a family of double-stranded DNA viruses with more than 100 identified serotypes; adenoviruses cause a wide range of illnesses, from mild respiratory infections to multiorgan disease. Both enterovirus and adenovirus are transmitted via the respiratory or fecal-oral routes, and both can be neurotoxic. These two viruses can be shed for a prolonged period after infection in humans, so they can reach similar co-infection rates. 13 During an HFMD outbreak in Sarawak in 1997, a subgroup B adenovirus and an enterovirus were isolated from three fatal cases, supporting the concept of coinfection with these viruses in humans. 14 Pre-existing neutralizing antibodies in humans not only tell us the history and prevalence trends of certain pathogens but also indicate the nature of protective immunity in humans to the corresponding infections. 15, 16 In this study, we have investigated the prevalence of neutralizing antibodies to four viruses, EV71, CA16, adenovirus human serotype 5 (AdHu5) and chimpanzee adenovirus pan7 (AdC7), in the serum of healthy adults. AdHu5 is a subgroup C adenovirus and is one of the most common adenoviruses circulating in both children and adults. AdC7 originated in chimpanzees and is thought to be a rare serotype in humans, although little is known about its prevalence in the human population. Chimpanzee adenoviruses have been considered ideal carriers for the development of vaccines against a broad range of pathogens because their neutralizing antibodies are rare in humans, and this low antibody prevalence would circumvent the negative effects of pre-existing immunity to common human serotypes of adenovirus. 17, 18 Evaluating the prevalence of neutralizing antibodies to AdC7, compared with AdHu5, may provide evidence supporting the potential use of AdC7 as an additional or alternative vaccine carrier.",

Twentyfour hours later, the 96-well plates were examined by fluorescence microscopy. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without serum was used as the negative control. The neutralizing antibody titer was expressed as the reciprocal of dilutions for which the proportion of green fluorescent protein-expressing cells was reduced to approximately 50% of that for the negative control. A titer o20 was regarded as positive for the serotype-specific neutralizing antibodies. 22 Data analysis Seroprevalence rates were compared between viruses using the Chisquare test. Analysis of variance 23 was performed to compare the means of neutralizing antibody titers across different regions, genders and ages. The correlations between neutralizing antibody titers of the viruses studied were calculated using Spearman's method. 24 All statistical analysis was performed using SPSS (Statistical Package for the Social Sciences, Chicago, IL, USA) software (version 16). A P value of less than 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant.",

AdHu5 is one of the most common serotypes to infect both children and adults. AdHu5 seroprevalence rates in adults vary from 60% to 70% in Europe 31,32 and the USA 33,34 and up to 98% in warmer African and Asian tropical countries. 19, [35] [36] [37] Several studies have shown that AdHu5 seropositivity rates in some areas of China ranged from 72% to 77.34% in adults, 22, 38, 39 consistent with our results (74.2%). We found AdHu5 seroprevalence to be significantly higher in coastal regions than in inland regions, which could be due to the mild and humid climate in coastal areas; it is possible that the coastal climate contributes to the spread of adenovirus infections. We also found a gender difference in AdHu5 seroprevalence, which was not consistent with previous reports. 35 However, AdHu5 and CA16 have similar gender distributions of seroprevalence. In our study, AdHu5 seroprevalence increased with age (21-50 years), with an older population (41-50 years old) having the highest seropositivity (87.5%), in agreement with a previous report. 22 Because the prevalence of AdHu5 is so high in humans and because pre-existing immunity to AdHu5 dampens the immune response induced by AdHu5-based vaccines, rare adenovirus serotypes from other species, such as chimpanzees, have been developed and tested as vectors for vaccine development. AdC7 represents a distinct serotype related to human adenovirus and has already been used as a vaccine carrier in many studies, with promising results. [40] [41] [42] However, the seroprevalence status of AdC7 in humans has not been investigated extensively. In our study, we showed that the AdC7 seropositivity rate in adults is low (11.8%) and similar to that for AdC68 (12.7%) in Chinese adults, 22 and that the AdC7 seroprevalence rate does not vary significantly among regions, genders or age groups. Like AdC7, AdC68 is another rare serotype, related to human adenovirus, from chimpanzees. 17 The neutralizing antibody titer for EV71 correlated with those of CA16 and AdHu5, which implies these three viruses cocirculate in adults and that adenovirus infection also should be taken into consideration in the prevention and treatment of HFMD.",
