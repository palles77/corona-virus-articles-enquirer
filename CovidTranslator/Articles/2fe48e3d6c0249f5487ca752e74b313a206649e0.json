Schwann cells can participate in CNS remyelination (Blakemore 1983 ), but it is now clear that oligodendrocytes are responsible for most of the remyelination in the brain. The question as to whether these are differentiated, adult oligodendrocytes or undifferentiated stem cells is still open. On the one hand, Raft et al. (1983 Raft et al. ( , 1985 have recently demonstrated in the rat that oligodendrocytes and type II astrocytes derive from a common progenitor cell (O2A), stained by A2B5 antibody. These progenitor ceils are still present in the optic nerve of adult rats (Ffrench-Constant and Raft 1986 ). On the other hand, the ability of differentiated adult oligodendrocytes to divide and/or synthesize myelin again is suggested by several recent works (Ludwin 1984; Aranella et al. 1984; Szuchet et al. 1986; Wood and Bunge 1986) .",

The shiverer transplantation model (Lachapelle et al. 1983/84; Gumpel et al. 1985; Baulac et al. 1987) has been used to differentiate myelin formed by transplanted oligodendrocytes from that of the shiverer host. The mouse shiverer mutation consists of a large deletion in the gene coding for myelin basic protein (MBP) (Roach et al. 1985 ) located on chromosome 18 (Sidman et al. 1985) . This deletion prevents the expression of MBP, leading to a defect in myelin compaction and an absence of the major dense line (MDL) (Jacque et al. 1978; Privat et al. 1979) . Thus, myelin formed by normal oligodendrocytes can be easily detected, either by immunohistochemistry (using an anti-MBP antiserum) and/or by EM (showing the presence of MDL). In the present study, we transplanted oligodendrocytes isolated from young adult rat brains into the brains of newborn shiverer mice. Since myelination is postnatal in the mouse (Folch-Pi 1955; Monge et al. 1986 ), the transplanted cells were thus present in the brain during the normal process of myelination, when factors responsible for myelin differentiation are fully expressed.",

Within this loose parenchyma, we observed a high density of oligodendrocytes; it was not possible, however, to differentiate between donor and host oligodendrocytes although some of them had phagocytosed fragments of charcoal. The oligodendrocytes appeared healthy, with a high membrane activity, numerous long cell processes, presence of typical endoplasmic reticulum, Golgl apparatus, microtubules and filaments. Both dark and medium oligodendrocytes were still recognizable. Interestingly, we observed mitoses among oligodendrocytes with dark cytoplasm (Fig. 5) . No myelination (either shiverer or normal) was observed around the graft at this age; the region appeared to be highly vascularized. Twenty days after grafting, the loose appearance of the parenchyma diminished. The oligodendrocytes still extended long processes but their membrane activity was reduced. The main difference between post transplantation days 7 and 20 was the presence, at 20 days, of a large population of astrocytes. Numerous astrocytic processes could be identified in the area of the graft by the presence of gliofilaments (Fig. 6) . At 40, 70 and 130 days after grafting, huge astrocytic processes envelopped and progressively isolated the grafted cells. The graft, still healthy, appeared to be completely surrounded by astrocytic processes and was delimited by a continuous basal lamina (Fig. 7) .",

The transplanted cells were 95~o oligodendrocytes, identified immunocytochemically by the presence of GalC and MBP, two specific markers of matured oligodendrocytes (Raft et al. 1979) but only 90~o of the cells were identified as oligodendrocytes by TEM criteria. This discrepancy is probably due to the impossibility of performing a real cell count on TEM material. Furthermore, a few astrocytes were observed by TEM, although they were not detectable by immunocytochemistry. This can be explained by the difficulty of GFAP staining on newly isolated cells which are round with no extended processes.",

However, in our experiments, very few cells were A2B5 positive, and it seems unlikely that they could account for all the myelination detected. Moreover, several studies suggest that mature differentiated oligodendrocytes can divide and/or synthesize myelin. Ludwin et al. (1984) and Aranella et al. (1984) demonstrated that adult oligodendrocytes are able to incorporate [3H]thymidine after experimental demyelination or CNS lesion. More recently, Wood and Bunge (1986) showed that adult oligodendrocytes can remyelinate dorsal root ganglia axons in vitro. In neuron-free cultures, Szuchet et al. (1986) demonstrated that adult oligodendrocytes retain the capacity to make myelin membranes, a phenomenon she called myelin palingenesis. As in these studies, our data also suggest that matured oligodendrocytes are still able to myelinate.",

            "text": "Our experiments raise the question as to whether matured oligodendrocytes can migrate after transplantation into a newborn brain. Since the host brains were sectioned only at the level of the graft, a large proportion of the MBP-positive patches, present either laterally or in the controlateral hemisphere , was missed. The extent of migration is therefore certainly underestimated. Nevertheless, in 10 cases (8 after immunohistochemical staining and 2 after immunoprelocalisation and EM) long distance migration (more than 1 cm from the graft) was observed. This long distance migration was recently studied on serial sections of the whole brain, after transplantation of either newborn mouse (Gansmtlller et al. 1986) or embryonic human ) CNS fragments. However, in the latter experiments, the grafted fragments contained a high percentage of progenitor cells. These progenitor ceils are able to migrate, as demonstrated by Small et al. (1987) in the rat optic nerve. Our results suggest that matured oligodendrocytes, when present in the brain during the normal myelination process might reexpress those properties enabling them to migrate. However, passive transport along elongating axons (Gansmtlller et al. 1986 ) cannot be totally ruled out. Finally, no sign of acute rejection was observed. The grafted cells at the site of implantation appeared healthy 5 months after transplantation; the MBP positive patches were still present, indicating the survival of the transplanted oligodendrocytes. However, the graft itself was progressively surrounded by numerous astrocytic processes and became completely isolated from the host parenchyma by a delimiting basal lamina. A similar observation was made after transplantation of embryonic human or newborn mouse CNS (GansmtlHer et al. 1986 ). This phenomenon seems peculiar to the CNS transplantation and remains to be elucidated. Interestingly, no such host reaction was ever observed around the MBP-positive myelin patches, suggesting a specific tolerance for grafted cells participating in CNS development. It should be noted that long term immunological rejection cannot be excluded since the survival of the shiverer mouse never exceeds 150 days.",
