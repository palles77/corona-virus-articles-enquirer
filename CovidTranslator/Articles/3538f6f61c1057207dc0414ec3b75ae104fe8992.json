Interventional cardiology, in particular, has shown remarkable advances, especially in the management of coronary artery disease, which, unfortunately, has shown a disconcerting increase in incidence in a country traditionally known for very low incidence of coronary artery disease. Important contributing factors include increasing affluence, westernization of dietary habit and lifestyle, and rampant cigarette smoking. At present, the Chinese population has an annual coronary mortality of one sixth of that reported in the West, an incidence of acute myocardial infarction of one tenth to one eighth, and a mortality of acute myocardial infarction of one eighth. The prevalence of coronary artery disease among the general Chinese population (3 -7%) is roughly one quarter of that among the Caucasians in the West, but this will get worse for sure.",

Despite the accusations that the Chinese authorities have been underreporting or covering up cases of SARS, I saw no evidence of such an occurrence during my visit in October 2002, which included Hong Kong, Guangzhou, Beijing, and Shanghai. It only came to surface early in 2003 when, according to a good colleague of mine in Guangzhou who apologized for not promptly responding to my correspondences, as he always did over the many years of our acquaintance, his hospital ''had been kept busy with quite a few cases of atypical pneumonia since the Spring Festival,'' another term for the Chinese New Year, which fell on February 1, 2003 . Most cases of atypical pneumonia reported during that period were indeed cases of SARS. As a matter of fact, the Chinese term for SARS is still atypical pneumonia . Personally, I do not believe for a moment that China was underreporting or covering up cases of SARS. China was simply caught offguard by the sudden appearance of this mysterious disease, which, on the surface, resembled common colds or ordinary flu. Because it occurred during the usual flu season, I could empathize with China's initial ''what's the big deal?'' attitude. To me, the most important outcome of this whole incident of SARS is that China's press and news media have now become completely transparent-a sign of Chinese ''glasnost''. Of course, SARS is all history now (Fig. 1 ).",

Myocardial infarction, which was extremely rare in old China, has been the fifth leading cause of death in modern China [15] . I still recall that when I was a medical student, I saw only one case of acute myocardial infarction during my entire 5 years of schooling. It was such a rarity that the patient became the subject of Medical Grand Rounds, Cardiology Grand Rounds, ECG Conference, Radiology Conference, Physiology Seminar, Pharmacology Round Table, Journal Club, and Research Conference.

The huge success of the world's two of the best known fast-food giants, McDonald's ( Fig. 2) and Kentucky Fried Chicken, also known as KFC (Fig. 3) , is the result of a change of Chinese lifestyles, which are becoming more geared to speed, convenience, and choice. Although most of the Chinese do not like the taste of either hamburgers (Chinese prefer pork to beef) or cheeseburgers (Chinese compare cheese to vomitus), they possess enough curiosity to try them. Furthermore, consumers in China are buying at McDonald's and KFC because they are fashionable in the West, not because they represent [19] . More than one third of adults in China and over half of adults in China's urban areas consume over 30% of their energy from fat [20] . As a consequence of the recent change in the dietary habits in China, the normal plasma cholesterol values in modern China have shown a steady increase. In 2003, the upper limit of normal was 6.0 mmol/l or 232 mg/dl, and the mean value was 5.06 mmol/l or 196 mg/dl [21] . These ''normal'' values, which were very similar to those reported recently from another study of 1211 retirees in Beijing [22] and the Chinese MONICA project involving 5 million Chinese from 16 provinces [23] , were considerably higher than the normal values in China published in 1958 (155 mg/ dl) [24] , 1981 (191 mg/dl) [24] , and 1997 (200 mg/dl) [25] . In a country known traditionally for its low plasma cholesterol values, low incidence of coronary artery disease, and lean body build, this upward adjustment of the so-called ''normal'' values in modern China represents an alarming trend that deserves special attention. This assumes an even greater significance in view of the recent report that blood cholesterol concentration is directly related to mortality from coronary artery disease even in those with-what was, by western standards-a ''low'' cholesterol concentration [26] .",

China is starting to consume more milk, a basic change in the national diet that reflects an upward shift in the expanding Chinese middle class. In old China, milk was considered a luxury, costing more than water or tea. With the improvement of living standards, near doubling of milk production during the last 5 years [27] , and the fitness craze sweeping across the country, Chinese are drinking more milk in record numbers-25% increase from 2001 to 2002 (Q.Y. Ge, personal communication, April 2, 2003) . China's annual milk production has finally caught up with that of its grain alcohol [27] . So, instead of ''Gan Bei'' (''bottoms up'') with the traditional Mao-tai at most of the state banquets, Chinese hosts are now holding up glasses filled with milk. Unfortunately, while the older generations of Chinese have benefited from a diet high in vegetables and fruits and low in saturated fats, a move to too much milk undoubtedly would accelerate the development of atherosclerosis in modern China. Such changes in China's dietary intake will have a great influence on the coronary artery disease burden, as was supported by the recently reported Singapore experience in which the higher consumption of dietary saturated fat is associated with a higher serum cholesterol and higher coronary artery disease mortality in Singaporean Chinese compared with the Chinese in Hong Kong and mainland China [28] .",

By the end of 2000, the obesity rate of male students in Beijing reached 15%, doubling that of 1990 and approaching that of developed countries [29] . Traditionally, a fat child in China meant a healthy child, one who was likely to survive the rigors of undernourishment and infections. This misconception still prevails today in many parts of China, which, unfortunately, is a participant in an international epidemic of childhood obesity [33, 34] . Fat children grow up to be fat adults. Overweight in China [body mass index (BMI) z 25] has shown a progressive increase in both men and women over the past two decades (Table 3 ) [35] . It is estimated that overweight is present in 50 -60% of northern Chinese and 20% of the total Chinese population [35] . Obesity (BMI z 30) is present in 10% of the population in northern China and 5% in southern China; the total number of obese people in China is now estimated to be 30-40 million [35] . The Chinese have a lower baseline BMI to begin with (baseline value = 21 [36] ; mean = 18.5-23.9 [37] ), and it takes less increment to reach an obese level, so that a BMI of 24 -27.9 is considered as overweight and z 28 as obese [37] . It takes smaller increments to increase the risk of hypertension, coronary artery disease, and type II diabetes in the Chinese population [36, 38, 39] . China is in the midst of an obesity epidemic [40] . Obesity in China has reached such a serious stage that the Chinese government has started a national campaign against it [41] . Furthermore, the Chinese Medical Association just convened its first national symposium on the prevention and treatment of obesity on March 15, 2003 in Suzhou [42] . The recent report that obesity significantly raises cancer risk [43] will undoubtedly add impetus to China's war against obesity because of the Chinese's inordinate fear of cancer.",

This disease entity is encountered more and more often now in China. As a matter of fact, the interventional cardiologists in China have also become quite aggressive in treating these patients with the percutaneous technique of transluminal septal myocardial ablation with alcohol, with one center alone having performed such a procedure in 119 patients with excellent short-and long-term results [61] . According to the Chinese national registry, over 400 such procedures have been performed among 20 hospitals in China by the end of 2002. The Chinese cardiologists have also been actively engaged in laboratory investigations to determine whether it is the volume of the alcohol injected, or the rate of alcohol injection into the first septal perforator of the left anterior descending coronary artery during septal ablation that is important. It was concluded that the size of the iatrogenically induced myocardial infarct in piglets is directly related to the volume of intracoronary alcohol injection, rather than the rate of alcohol injection [62] .",

He did not even mention it in his book ''Chinese Lessons to Western Medicine'' [14] . (2) Even as recent as 1970s, pulmonary embolism was thought to be rare in China [4] The rarity of pulmonary embolism was even more remarkable when one considered the widespread use of birth control pills among the Chinese women of child-bearing age [4] . Perhaps the use of acupuncture anesthesia [2,7 -9] , which permitted early ambulation after major surgery, accounted for the low incidence of postoperative pulmonary embolism in China. Because acupuncture anesthesia is seldom employed in modern China, this protective factor is no longer operative. (3) More accurate in vivo diagnosis of pulmonary embolism is now possible because of improved diagnostic techniques.",

Unfortunately, they tend to interact unfavorably with commonly prescribed western cardiac drugs, including warfarin [93 -98] , digoxin [98 -101] , and hypoglycemic agents [102] .

Publishers include the Chinese Medical Association, which is a nongovernmental organization with many specialty societies, the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, the Chinese Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine, various publishing houses, hospitals, and academic institutions. The major publisher of Chinese medical journals is the Chinese Medical Association, which published 46 journals in 1990, 56 journals in 1994, and 69 journals in 2003 (L.F. Cai, Chinese Medical Association, personal communication, May 2003). Several monthly medical journals began to be published twice a month just as in the United States (e.g., the National Medical Journal of China). There were only seven specialty journals in cardiology in 1978, but in 1998, there were 25-a threefold increase in just two decades (Z.L.

Beginning in 2003, the Chinese Journal of Cardiology, which celebrated its 30th anniversary of publication in February 2003, increased its monthly pages from 64 to 80; beginning in 2004, it will be published twice a month (Y.M. Jiang, Chinese Journal of Cardiology, personal communication, May 14, 2003), just like Circulation and the Journal of the American College of Cardiology in the United States. Many print journals also appear online; there are currently 68 journals published by the Chinese Medical Association, most of which are also available on CD-ROM starting with 1996. Chinese editions of the Journal of American Medical Association and British Medical Journal have been in publication since February 1982 and May 1998, respectively. It may be of interest to note how frequently different foreign medical journals are being cited as references in articles that appeared in the Chinese Journal of Cardiology. A perusal of the list published recently in the Chinese Journal of Cardiology showed that, in 2000-2001, Circulation was on top of the list, followed by the Journal of the American College of Cardiology, American Journal of Cardiology, New England Journal of Medicine, Lancet, etc.",
