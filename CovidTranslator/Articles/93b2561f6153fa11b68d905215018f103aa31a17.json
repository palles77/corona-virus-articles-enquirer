            "text": "Bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV) is a major cause of bronchiolitis and pneumonia in cattle and causes yearly outbreaks with high morbidity in Europe. Commercial vaccines against this virus needs improvement of efficacy, especially in calves with BRSV-specific maternally derived antibodies (MDA). We previously reported that an experimental BRSV-ISCOM vaccine, but not a commercial vaccine, induced strong clinical and virological protection in calves with MDA, immunized at 7-15 weeks of age. The aim of the present study was to characterize the immune responses, as well as to investigate the efficacy and safety in younger animals, representing the target population for vaccination. Four groups of five 3-8 week old calves with variable levels of BRSV-specific MDA were immunized s.c. twice at a 3 weeks interval with (i) BRSV immunostimulating complexes (BRSV-ISCOMs), (ii) BRSV-protein, (iii) adjuvant, or (iv) PBS. All calves were challenged with virulent BRSV by aerosol 2 weeks later and euthanized on day 6 after infection. The cellular and humoral responses were monitored as well as the clinical signs, the viral excretion and the pathology following challenge. Despite presence of MDA at the time of the immunization, only a minimum of clinical signs were observed in the BRSV-ISCOM group after challenge. In contrast, in all control groups, clinical signs of disease were observed in most of the animals (respiratory rates up to 76 min \u22121 and rectal temperatures up to 41 \u2022 C). The clinical protection was associated to a highly significant reduction of virus replication in the upper and lower respiratory tract of calves, rapid systemic and local antibody responses and T helper cell responses dominated by IFN\u2425 production. Animals that did not shed virus detectable by PCR or cell culture following challenge possessed particularly high levels of pulmonary IgA. The protective immunological responses to BRSV proteins and the ability to overcome the inhibiting effect of MDA were dependent on ISCOM borne antigen presentation.",

This virus is cytopathogenic and directly damages the respiratory epithelium in vivo, but also induces host responses that contribute to the development of disease [4, 5] . Synergistically acting co-or super-infections with other respiratory pathogens are common [6] [7] [8] ; however, the clinical signs may be severe by infection with BRSV alone [9] . The disease pattern of BRSV in a cattle population varies according to the level of virus circulation and subsequently eosinophils in the lung, which was also previously observed in children vaccinated against human (H)RSV in the 1960s, with a fatal outcome in two infants [17] . As a consequence of that tragedy, and although HRSV is the most common cause of acute lower respiratory infection in children and a frequent cause of death in developing countries [18] , there is still no effective HRSV vaccine available.",

A major problem to achieve this goal is that maternally derived antibodies suppress active responses to immunization, even at moderate antibody levels that are not per se protecting the young individual against RSV disease [10] and during the age when infections are common. Vaccination in cattle should preferably be performed at a young age; before commingling of calves into large units where BRSV often circulates, at a time when maternal antibody levels differ between calves [19] . To be efficient at the level of a population it is critical that a new vaccine is effective in the face of maternal immunity.",

On the other hand, inactivated conventional BRSV vaccines have showed varying efficacy in young calves against BRSV in the field [13, 16] . Furthermore, these vaccines are rarely evaluated in models that fully reproduce clinical signs of BRSV disease in the presence of maternal antibodies, and seldom with molecular diagnostic tools. Nevertheless, reduction of virus shedding has been demonstrated following one or two immunizations and challenge with BRSV inducing mild disease [23] [24] [25] [26] .",

The aim of the present study is to characterize in more detail the protective immune responses induced by BRSV-ISCOMs in young animals with maternal antibodies against BRSV, as well as to investigate the efficacy and safety in animals representing the target population for vaccination. On this occasion, the vaccine and challenge virus were homologous, and the time between vaccination and challenge was kept short to approximate the situation of BRSV infection after commingling of young calves. A group of calves immunized with BRSV proteins without adjuvant, qualitatively and quantitatively comparable to those in ISCOMs, was included to further elucidate the adjuvant effect of ISCOM in bovidae.",

We thus extend the previous finding in 7-15-week-old calves [27] , to 3-8-week old calves, representing a more relevant target population for BRSV vaccination. Supporting earlier data, BRSV-ISCOMs provided clinical protection and a highly significant reduction in virus excretion from the upper respiratory tract of calves, associated with rapid systemic and nasal antibody responses. Additionally, virological protection of the lower respiratory tract was associated with local and systemic humoral responses as well as T cell responses dominated by IFN\u2425 production. Moreover, we study the safety of this experimental vaccine through clinical and pathological investigations. The absence of clinical signs and the character of pulmonary cellular responses upon succeeding virulent BRSV infection, without excess of neutrophils or eosinophils, indicated good safety of the BRSV-ISCOM vaccine, although this should be further Fig. 6 .

As previously reported after natural and experimental BRSV infection [3, 9, 39] , the clinical signs of disease varied within the control groups. Standard deviations were used to illustrate this variation, instead of standard error of the mean that is often misused for this purpose [40] . The variations in clinical signs and pathology might have been due to the short time between challenge and euthanasia and being the result of the variation in the time needed to develop disease, but were most probably influenced by other factors. The three control calves with most severe tachypnea and gross pathology, also had the highest levels of BRSV-specific maternal IgG at challenge and the highest viral loads in nasal secretions, within their groups, and were among the oldest and youngest. This supports the suggestion that maternal antibodies are not fully protective and that T-cell and/or mucosal antibody responses play an important role in protection. Hypothetically, the severe disease in these three control calves could be linked to individual genetic variation in the response to BRSV infection, as has been suggested in the case of HRSV [41] and other animal viral infections [42] . Calves (identified as calf 'a' through 't') were immunized as described in Fig. 1 and challenged with BRSV on PID 0. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were obtained on PID \u22123 or \u22122 (before challenge, dark grey bars) and PID 4 or 5 (after challenge, light grey bars), and were stimulated with BRSV or control antigen. Proliferation is expressed as corrected OD values (mean of triplicate) after six days of stimulation and addition of Alamar Blue \u00ae reagent. In contrast to controls, the animals immunized with BRSV-ISCOMs were protected against clinical signs of disease. The clinical scorings were further supported by lung function measurements by forced oscillation. This method, originally evaluated in calves using broncho-modulatory treatments [43] , could potentially be used to improve the objectiveness of clinical assessments in any respiratory infection model of calves, as will be discussed elsewhere (Pringle et al., in preparation) .",

These reactions were probably linked to the Quillaja saponin component that was increased from 5 to 13 times that of the lipids and proteins compared to previously [27] . Besides not causing direct toxicity and acute hypersensitivity reactions, BRSV vaccines must not induce exaggerated inflammatory responses upon natural infection. Indeed, this has been a problem both for vaccines against BRSV in cattle and against the closely related HRSV in man. In the 1960s a formalin inactivated (FI)-HRSV vaccine induced severe pulmonary neutrophilia in children, with the presence of eosinophils in fatal cases [17] . The vaccine induced enhanced disease has been reproduced experimentally in mice and cattle, with reduced IFN\u2425 production and even more prominent pulmonary eosinophilia [44] . In small animal models FI-HRSV induces Th2-skewed immune responses that may be responsible for bronchoconstriction and inflammation following RSV infection (reviewed by Castilow and Varga and Meyer et al.

It is clear, however, that this inhibition is determinant-specific and occurs primarily on B-cells, probably by antibody masking of epitopes on vaccine antigens and preventing the binding to these cells. There is possibly also interference with antigen uptake and presentation, although cellular responses are much less affected than humoral responses [48] . Notably, even if a BRSV specific T-cell memory can be induced in the presence of maternal antibodies in calves [49] , the antibody responses, induced by commercial vaccines in previous studies, were commonly absent [26] and the induced clinical protection was poor in a model reproducing the clinical signs of disease observed in the field [27] .",

One possibility is that the effect is due to the antigen dose in relation to the level of maternal antibodies [50] . However, as will be described in detail elsewhere (H\u00e4gglund et al., in preparation [51] ), one dose of BRSV-ISCOMs contained less than 100 g BRSV proteins, which is 3-20 times less than that in other subunit BRSV vaccines administered to calves [52, 53] . Nevertheless, given the weak responses induced by BRSV proteins alone, the presence of antigens in the form of ISCOM particles, and/or the effect of adjuvant component, was essential. We are presently investigating whether the incorporation of BRSV-proteins into ISCOMs is required or alternatively whether similar immunogenicity can be obtained with the antigens mixed with commercially available, pre-formed empty ISCOMs or another adjuvant.",

In contrast, low levels of pulmonary IgG were detected in BAL, probably due to high dilution of samples, which further suggests that the IgA was actively transported into the lung and present in very high amounts.

Thus, in contrast to calves immunized with BRSV protein alone, the animals immunized with BRSV-ISCOMs rapidly acquired serum IgG 2 , an immunoglobulin associated with Th1 cytokines. Furthermore, a similar pattern was seen for the induction of IgG 2a in mice (data not shown). Since the IgG 1 and IgG 2 assays were normalized against different positive control sera, it is not possible to compare the concentrations of these parameters. However, bearing in mind that at four months of age, calves have normally similar levels of total IgG 1 as adult cattle, whereas total IgG 2 then is only half of adult levels [56] , and that IgG 2 is complement activating [57, 58] ; the presence of this antibody isotype might be linked to protection or associated with a strong T-cell response.",

After stimulation, PBMCs from BRSV-ISCOM immunized animals showed significantly higher levels of IFN\u2425 and IL-4 mRNA per cell than those from controls, with about 10-160 times higher levels of IFN\u2425 than IL-4 mRNA. Additionally, significantly higher lymphocyte proliferative responses were induced in animals immunized with BRSV-ISCOMs, indicating that their lymphocytes would both undergo efficient clonal expansion and produce more cytokines per cell, upon BRSV infection. This remains to be verified in vivo. Bovine IL-4 is generally associated with enhanced B-cell survival and IgG 1 antibody production in cattle, whereas IFN\u2425 is normally linked to a Th1 type of response with production of IgG 2 and activation of macrophages as well as cytotoxic lymphocytes (CTL, reviewed by Estes and Brown [57] ). ISCOMs have previously shown an exceptional capacity to induce CTL responses, possibly by enabling B-cell cross-presentation of killed antigens to na\u00efve CD8+ lymphocytes [58] , and this will be investigated for BRSV in the future. Supposedly, the marked IFN\u2425 and the moderate IL-4 mRNA inductions were promoted by ISCOM induction of type I interferons, which in bovine in vitro systems has been shown to induce not only IgG 2 , but also IgA production [59] . IFN\u2425 additionally upregulates the production of IgA secretory component and IgA transcytosis by human bronchial epithelial cells in vitro [60] .",
