The influences of the ethanol concentration, extraction time, temperature, and the liquid-solid ratio on flavonoid yield were investigated. Based on ANOVA results, a secondorder quadratic polynomial model could be applied to characterize the extraction process. The following optimal extraction conditions were identified: ethanol concentration, 52.98 %; extraction time, 2.12 h; extraction temperature, 62.46\u00b0C; and liquid-solid ratio, 35.23. The predicted extraction yield was 19.437 mg/g when these optimal conditions were used. The proposed method was successfully employed to extract flavonoids from S. baicalensis.",

Previous trials showed that the ethanol volume, extraction temperature, extraction time, and liquid-solid ratio have significant effects on the yield of total flavonoid extraction (Liu et al. 2009 ). Given the preliminary results, a central composite rotatable design (CCRD) was used to investigate the effects of four independent variables, namely, the ethanol volume (X 1 ), extraction time (X 2 ), temperature (X 3 ), and the solid-liquid ratio (X 4 ) on the yield of flavonoids (Y). The independent variables were designated as \"+1,\" \"0,\" and \"\u22121\" for high, intermediate, and low values, respectively. The coded and corresponding uncoded levels of the independent variables used in the CCRD design are listed in Table 1 . The complete design consisted of 29 experimental runs, including 5 replications of the center points.",

Thus, few unknown factors can affect the experiment results. The model with R 2 >0.75 was considered acceptable (Yang et al. 2010 ). The polynomial model (p<0.05) and the correlation coefficient (R 2 >0.75) demonstrated that the regression model was suitable for the actual situation. A relationship between the flavonoid yield and the studied extraction conditions was revealed. Therefore, the obtained regression model could optimize and satisfactorily predict the conditions for maximum yield. A, A 2 , and B 2 significantly affected the extraction yield, which demonstrated that the influence factors did not have a simple linear or quadratic relationship (Table 3) .
