Age-dependent decline in immune competence, often referred to as immunosenescence, results from progressive deterioration of innate and adaptive immune responses and most of the insights into mechanisms of immune aging have derived from studies in murine models. In this Review, we explore how well these models are applicable to understand the aging process throughout the 80-100 years of human life and discuss recent advances in uncovering and characterizing the mechanisms underlying age-associated defective adaptive immunity in humans.",

The elderly population increases in different countries at different speed, but the trend is global and involves economically advanced as well as developing countries. Demographic shifts are currently most pronounced in Eastern Asia and some European countries where the number of elderly individuals has or will soon outnumber the number of children and the number of individuals who are actively working will be shrinking. In the future, 75% of elderly individuals will be living in less-developed countries which lack efficient social networks and support systems. Preventing or ameliorating infectious diseases in the aging population has therefore been identified as a public health priority by the WHO through a joined effort of their aging and life-course and immunization departments 10 .",

            "text": "Vaccinations against childhood diseases are one of the most successful and cost-effective interventions in medicine and have completely reshaped the landscape of infectious diseases in children and young adults. Since infections are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the elderly, vaccinations appear to be the optimal tool to promote healthy aging 11 . Four vaccines are currently recommended for individuals older than 60 years to protect against influenza, pneumococcal, tetanus and pertussis infections and to prevent zoster reactivation. All four of them are against antigens for which immune memory already exists. Three of them induce at least in part recall responses while the current pneumococcal vaccine is a polysaccharide vaccine that mostly induces a T cell-independent B cell response. Of these four vaccines, only the tetanus-reduced diphtheria-acellular pertussis vaccine gives a satisfactory, but reduced protective antibody response compared to young adults 12 . In contrast, vaccines for influenza or pneumococcal disease fail to induce protective immunity in a large proportion of the elderly population, but at least appear to be able to mitigate disease to some degree 13, 14 . Similarly, vaccination with the live varicella virus zoster vaccine only partially prevents herpes zoster reactivation or attenuates the severity of postherpetic neuralgia 15, 16 . Primary immune responses are equally or maybe even more compromised in the elderly than secondary responses, as illustrated by the poor vaccine response to hepatitis B 17 , the side effects from yellow fever vaccination or the disease severity of West Nile virus infection and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). More than five decades of experience and the recent 2009 H1N1 pandemic have provided an unparalleled understanding of influenza vaccinations 18 . While most observational studies report a weak increase in hemagglutination antibody inhibitiontiters and mitigation of disease severity, some epidemiological studies have questioned the benefit from the annual influenza vaccination 19, 20 . Attempts at improving vaccine outcomes have included the use of adjuvant, higher vaccine doses or booster vaccination, but such strategies have been of limited benefit [21] [22] [23] . The live influenza vaccine was not efficacious and is therefore not approved in individuals older than 50 years 24 . A better understanding of the mechanisms in immune aging is indispensable to optimally target age-related defects and to restore vaccine responses to a level that vaccination is becoming an effective tool to promote healthy aging. While effective vaccine responses depend on the cooperative action of the innate and adaptive immune systems both of which are subject to aging, this review will mainly focus on the adaptive arm. We will first review the impact of age on T and B cell biology in mouse models and then discuss similarities and differences in human aging.",

            "text": "Basic principles of immune aging have been widely studied in mouse models given that mice are the preferred system for immunological studies and a vast array of tools are available 25 . Early studies describe age-acquired defects in antibody responses, in particular germinal center function and somatic hypermutation, providing evidence that the adaptive immune system deteriorates with age 26, 27 . One obvious culprit is the substantial loss of na\u00efve T cells with age that, together with the recognition of thymic involution, has led to the paradigm that declining regenerative hematopoietic potential is at the core of immune aging 28 . Indeed, the maintenance of a na\u00efve T cell system in the adult mouse is entirely dependent on the ongoing, but vastly diminished thymic activity 29 . Loss in regenerative capacity is predicted to account for the loss of na\u00efve T cells and also for a contraction in T cell receptor diversity 30 . As a result, considerable efforts have focused on understanding the mechanisms of thymic involution and on identifying means of thymic rejuvenation, the subject of several recent excellent reviews [31] [32] [33] . While declining regenerative capacity is most pronounced for the T cell system, other hematopoietic lineages are affected as well.",

HSCs committed to the myeloid lineage increasingly outnumber lymphoid-prone HSCs with age 34, 35 . Preferential survival and population expansion of HSCs, DNA damage and defective repair or epigenetic reprogramming as well as extrinsic factors such as the cytokine environment contribute to this increasing imbalance 36 . The frequency of lymphoid-committed HSCs is rate-limiting for B cell generation since reducing the HSC pool in the young mouse reproduces the B cell subset distribution characteristic of old mice 37, 38 . In addition, age-associated changes in the microenvironment and the regulation of developmental check points result in quantitative and qualitative changes in B cell generation 39 . As a consequence, regenerative B cell capacity in old mice is severely reduced to as little as 10% compared to young mice and the na\u00efve B cell compartment is diminished and contracted in diversity. In contrast to T and B cell, the population of plasmacytoid and myeloid dendritic cells (DCs), essential for adaptive immune responses, does not appear to decline, consistent with the finding that the generation of myeloid cells is favored in the aging host. Available studies have the caveat that DC enumeration is tissue dependent, and most studies in the mouse have focused on DC function rather than numbers 40 .",

In vitro studies have mapped defects to T cell synapse formation and early T cell receptor signaling events 43 . The defects have been attributed to changes in the glycosylation of cell surface molecules or in physicochemical membrane properties, however, the exact mechanisms and in particular the relationship to aging has remained elusive. Diminished interleukin 2 (IL-2) production upon T cell activation was identified as the singular most important consequence, and, indeed, addition of exogenous IL-2 restores many of the age-related defects in T cell activation 44 . T cell defects could also be improved by addition of proinflammatory cytokines or Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands, providing support for the current approach in vaccinology to overcome poor vaccine responses by using an optimal adjuvant 45 .",

Factors that likely contribute to the increased mortality are reduced numbers and T cell receptor diversity of CD8 + T cells, a reduced ability to clonally expand, and a defect to generate CD8 + effector cells that are polyfunctional and produce high amounts of cytokines on a per cell basis 46 . In contrast, T cell memory responses, once established in the young mouse, are less affected by age and recall responses are generally intact 42 .",

Although the decreasing regenerative potential affects the na\u00efve more than the memory compartment, declining absolute numbers are obviously not the only reason. Peripheral selection that influences CD8 + T cell homeostatic proliferation and/or survival can skew and possibly contract the TCR repertoire 49 . The preferential occurrence of cell-intrinsic defects in na\u00efve cells, such as defective signaling and loss of replication and differentiation potential, are difficult to explain since na\u00efve T cells have lower homeostatic turnover rates in vivo than memory cells and are therefore less susceptible to replicative senescence. Observations reporting an increased longevity of na\u00efve CD4 + T cells with age due to a decline in BIM expression have led to the hypothesis that this longer lifespan predisposes the cells to accumulate defects 25 . Na\u00efve T cells can also acquire a semi-memory phenotype with age, indicating that they have entered differentiation pathways. Expression of molecules usually associated with chronic stimulation and exhaustion (such as PD-1 and LAG-3) have been observed in aged na\u00efve T cells 47 .",

Differences exist in innate and adaptive immunity, most obvious in the species-specific regulation and expression of a large number of molecules that are involved in immune processes 53 . Studies of immune senescence add additional levels of complexity ( Table 2 ). It cannot be taken for granted that time can be telescoped and 24 months in a mouse is equivalent to 80 years in a human. This point is of particular relevance as consequences of cumulative replication constitute an important cellular aging mechanism. Not only is the replicative history of mouse and human HSCs and lymphocytes over a life time very different, the two species also markedly differ in the telomeric lengths, with telomeres nearly ten times shorter in human cells. Telomeric erosion and the associated p53mediated induction of cellular senescence are therefore relevant for human but not for murine lymphocyte aging.",

            "text": "Another major difference is that immune aging is shaped by infections and comorbid conditions that are not truly reflected in most murine aging studies 54 . By shaping the immune repertoire, previous infections influence later responses to partially related or completely unrelated antigens 55 . In fact, most of the influenza-specific B cell responses in the elderly are based on mutational modifications of the existing immune B cell repertoire rather than recruitment of new na\u00efve B cells 56, 57 . Latent infections significantly impact the immune aging process. It has been estimated that clinically healthy humans are inhabited by about 8 to 12 latent viruses including herpes viruses, polyoma virus, Anelloviruses and adeno-associated viruses 58 . Having co-involved with the host, many of these viruses are highly species-specific and therefore difficult to model in animal models. While they do not cause overt disease (except in immunocompromised individuals), they shape the immune repertoire and the host environment. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection has received particular attention because CMV-specific responses encompass large proportions of the entire repertoire in some individuals and then appear to accelerate immune aging and depress responses to unrelated vaccines [59] [60] [61] . Equally important, many comorbid conditions are in a reciprocal relationship with the immune aging process in that each of them accelerate or modified the other. Telomere shortening, a hallmark of cellular aging, has been observed in several autoimmune diseases 62 . Accelerated immune aging is possibly best studied in rheumatoid arthritis where increased DNA damage and the initiation of deranged DNA repair responses shape T cell homeostasis and function 63 . Studies in the future may therefore take the reverse approach; rather than studying natural immune aging in the mouse, define age-related immune aberrations in humans and then develop models to study them in the mouse. As one example, the observations on the impact of cytomegalovirus infections have led to several studies in mice demonstrating that chronic infections established early in life influence all-cause mortality and immune responses in later life [64] [65] [66] . These models may now allow longitudinal studies to dissect the mechanisms how infections accelerate immune aging.",

HSCs in humans also show a shift to myeloid lineage commitment at the expense of lymphoid precursors 34 . Recent data indicate that this shift is accentuated under telomeric stress 36 . In a setting of telomerase deficiency, the basic leucine zipper transcription factor ATF-like (BATF) limits the self-renewal of lymphoid-biased HSCs. The combination of compulsory lymphoid differentiation and diminished self-renewal of lymphoid precursor cells is postulated to lead to a loss of pluripotency and dominance of myeloid lineage HSCs 67 . This mechanism should be particularly operational for humans where telomeric erosion is relevant and found in HSCs with aging 68 . Indeed, accumulation of DNA damage and increased expression of BATF are features of human HSC aging. As a consequence of HSC failure, the frequency of early or committed B lymphoid progenitor cells (defined by the expression of CD45RA, CD38, CD10 and CD19) decreases with age 69 . Diminution of na\u00efve B cells, immunoglobulin repertoire contraction and the emergence of increased frequencies of autoantibodies appears to be at least in part a consequence of declining regenerative potential and associated leakage in central selection mechanisms 38, 70 . While this limited capacity is already evident in the healthy people and more so in frail elderly 71 , the defect is of increasing concern for those adult individuals who undergo antibody-mediated B cell depletion, a treatment modality no longer reserved for hematological malignancies but increasingly used as immunosuppressive treatment in various autoimmune diseases.",

            "text": "Similar to mice, the human thymus involutes with the replacement of thymic epithelial cells by fat 72 . Bone marrow transplantation studies have suggested that thymic function does not sufficiently recover after the age of 40-50 or 50-60 years dependent on the study and the conditioning regimen to rebuild a na\u00efve T cell repertoire 73, 74 . Given that thymic involution is a very controlled process and already starts in children at the age of 1 year, some investigators consider it as an evolutionarily selected process of an organ that is needed during organism development but not during adult life and therefore not a typical example of tissue aging 75 . However, in analogy to mice, thymic involution in humans has also been considered detrimental to immune function and a central driver of T cell aging 76 . How much thymic T cell generation contributes to T cell homeostasis in the healthy adult has been a matter of debate. Frequencies of T cells expressing T cell receptor excision circles (TREC) are frequently considered as a mean to quantify thymic output 77 and, indeed, TRECs in peripheral blood T cells exponentially decline throughout adulthood 78 . However, the agerelated loss in TRECs can be explained as a consequence of T cell loss or dilution rather than falling thymic output 79, 80 . A recent study has challenged the paradigm that the thymus is critical in the adult and provided evidence that the maintenance of na\u00efve T cells fundamentally differs in mice and humans 29 . While the na\u00efve T cell pool in mice even with old age is highly dependent on thymic output, T cell generation in humans throughout adult life is mostly derived from peripheral division. Thymic output appears only to be important throughout the growth stages of human life, early life thymectomy induces accelerated immune aging, however only in concert with latent CMV infection 81, 82 . This interpretation is consistent with several observations. Na\u00efve T cell turnover as concluded from the frequency of Ki67-expressing cells does not change significantly between the age of 20 and 65 years suggesting that thymic output is already low during young adulthood with no need for increases in peripheral proliferation with age to compensate for declining output 78 . The absolute size of the na\u00efve CD4 + T cell compartment in humans is relatively well maintained into the 7 th decade of life 83 . In contrast, the na\u00efve CD8 + T cell compartment largely shrinks 46 . This differential attrition is unlikely due to declining input which would affect both lineages equally. CD4 + T cells, while still na\u00efve, lose the expression of CD31 when having proliferated 84 . Compared to CD31 + cells, such CD31 \u2212 na\u00efve T cells have a skewed TCR repertoire even in young adults consistent with peripheral selection 85 . However, the global na\u00efve CD4 TCR repertoire remains highly diverse (Fig. 1) . Only in the 8 th decade of life does cell turnover increase, possibly due to lymphocyte numbers falling below a critical threshold, and the TCR repertoire abruptly contracts 78, 86 . Similar results have been found in a non-human primate model 87 . We have used agent-driven stochastic in silico modeling of the human na\u00efve CD4 + T cell repertoire with age 88 . In this model, even complete thymic demise at the age of 20 years did not have any influence on repertoire diversity. The model only produced a repertoire contraction when multiple inheritable changes in growth behavior were introduced. Restoration of thymic activity in this case could neither prevent nor restore the repertoire collapse. In summary, for vaccine responses in the healthy elderly, thymic activity after the age of 20 years appears to be irrelevant and defects in T cell homeostasis are due to peripheral selection and growth and survival patterns. Nevertheless, thymic activity during adulthood or thymic rejuvenation continues to be important in patients who have depleted their peripheral repertoire during adult life. Obviously, this includes patients with HIV infection who have started highly active antiretroviral therapy in late or midadulthood. An increasing segment of the elderly population has undergone medical intervention such as chemotherapy or bone marrow transplantation for cancer treatment. Several recent studies identified that low TREC concentrations after bone marrow transplantation as predictors for increased complications from infections and poor survival 74, 89 .",

            "text": "Human na\u00efve CD4 + T cells do not develop the severe age-dependent dysfunctionality that is characteristic for murine T cells. Similar amounts of IL-2 were produced when the na\u00efve response of T cells from young and elderly individuals was probed against two new antigens, inactivated rabies virus and recombinant Etr protein of tick-borne encephalitis virus presented by autologous DC 90 . We have stimulated purified na\u00efve CD4 + T cells with DCs and superantigen and found a high correlation in gene expression between young and elderly adults 91 . Under suboptimal stimulation conditions, however, reduced responsiveness becomes apparent. Dissection of the TCR signaling cascade revealed that in particular ERK phosphorylation is blunted with age 92 . The reduced ERK response was due to increased cytoplasmic concentration of the dual-specific phosphatase DUSP6 as individuals progressed in age. DUSP6 is constitutively expressed in T cells and has recently been implicated in attenuating the threshold at which TCR stimulation is translated into a productive signal 93 . It is one of four phosphatases that are regulated by the microRNA miR-181a, which is highly expressed in double-positive thymocytes. miR-181a concentrations sharply decrease in the transition to single-positive thymocyte and na\u00efve T cells concurrent with decreasing TCR sensitivity to respond to the recognition of autoantigen. miR-181a appears to be similarly important in calibrating TCR responses with advancing age (Fig. 2) . miR-181a concentrations in na\u00efve CD4 + T cell decline with age and reconstitution of elderly CD4 + T cells with miR-181a restores responsiveness by repressing DUSP6 translation. The decline in miR-181a may therefore be an example of antagonistic pleiotropy as frequently discussed in the context of aging; beneficial in T cell development in the young to prevent autoimmune disease, but detrimental in the elderly by setting the TCR threshold too high to respond to exogenous antigen. It is currently unclear whether the mechanisms regulating miR-181a expression during thymic development and during peripheral T cell aging are shared. However, the finding that miR-181a expression is lower in memory than na\u00efve CD4 + T cells is consistent with the idea that downregulation is a programmed differentiation process and that aged na\u00efve T cells are semi-differentiated, possibly due to recognition of self-antigen during homeostatic proliferation 94 . Of note, human CD4 + memory T cells are less dependent on the ERK pathway and phosphorylate ERK less than na\u00efve cells as they channel the signal more through the scaffolding molecule human disks large hDLg to activate the p38 pathway 95 . But even for memory CD4 + T cells, reconstitution of miR-181a can improve responses in the elderly. DUSP6 is certainly not the only target of miR-181a that is important for T cell biology. In particular, miR-181a has been found to repress negative regulators of the NOTCH pathway and the decline in miR-181a may therefore dampen NOTCH signaling 96 .",

The most obvious example is reactivation of latent VZV infection which manifests as herpes zoster. Also, the reduced vaccine response to influenza is at least in part due to a defective T cell memory response. T cell memory cells to conserved hemagglutinin and neuraminidase epitopes that are not subject to antigenic drift exist in essentially all elderly individuals. Mechanistic defects appear to be highly dependent on the pathogen. For VZV infection, a steady decline of VZV-specific CD4 + T cells over time has been documented, which is only very transiently boosted with zoster vaccination or reactivation 16 . In contrast, high frequencies of antigenspecific T cells reactive to CMV persist throughout life (Fig. 1) . However, contraction in the diversity of CMV-specific TCR repertoire has been associated with diminished viral containment resulting in higher antibody titers and increases antigen-specific clonal expansion 97 . Polyfunctionality of antigen-specific T cells appears to be one additional factor for effective T cell responses which declines with age with the emergence of more and more monofunctional T cells 46 .",

Interestingly, many of these defects have to do with resource allocation to proper cellular maintenance which can be at odds with the ability to respond to external antigenic stimuli with T cell activation and effector function 94 . The last decade has seen great progress in our understanding on how metabolic pathways in T cells are connected to function 98 . In particular, T cell activation and acquisition of effector function is strictly linked to metabolic activity; not only providing sufficient energy in the form of ATP but also precursor metabolites for cellular synthesis. One metabolic master regulator is the AMP-activated protein kinase AMPK which is activated by a low ATP/AMP ratio, increased reactive oxygen species and, in the context of TCR stimulation, by fluxes in cytoplasmic calcium concentrations. We have proposed that functional defects in elderly CD4 + memory T cells are controlled by AMPK (Fig. 3) 94 . In studying the effect of age on CD4 + T memory cell function, we have identified a negative feedback loop mediated by the dual-specific phosphatase DUSP4 (ref. 99 ). DUSP4 is a nuclear phosphatase controlling nuclear ERK and JNK activity. Its activity peaks two to four days after T cell activation when it is significantly overexpressed in elderly T cells. DUSP4 curtails the expression of CD40L and several other functional molecules on activated CD4 memory T cells. As a consequence of increased DUSP4 inducibility in elderly T cells, their ability to provide help for T cell-dependent B cell responses is severely impaired, but can be restored by DUSP4 silencing. The upstream mechanism of increased DUSP4 expression is an increased activity of AMPK in aged memory CD4 + T cells that leads to the transcription of EGR1 and eventually DUSP4. This finding raises the interesting possibility that CD4 + T memory T cell function in the elderly can be improved by targeting their metabolic activity.",

Of note, DNA damage in memory T cells far exceeds that found in na\u00efve T cells, at any age. DNA damage responses may in part be responsible for the increased expression for p16 INK4a that is found in human T cells as well as other tissues in the elderly 101 . However, p53-mediated cell cycle arrest, typical for cellular senescence, is not a consistent feature of elderly T cells. Decreased proliferative activity is generally not permanent and can be overcome 102 . The proliferative ability in terminally differentiated CD8 + T cells can be restored by overexpressing hTERT to increase telomerase activity 103 . We have found that proliferation of na\u00efve and memory CD4 + T cells from elderly individuals can be significantly improved by providing ionic zinc to upregulate metallothionein expression 91 .",

            "text": "During aging, the expression patterns of T cell regulatory receptors change markedly (Fig.  4) . On balance, expression of various inhibitory receptors is gained, accompanied by a decrease in the expression of costimulatory CD28 family and TNFRSF members 106, 107 . The changes mostly involve CD8 + memory T cells. Often the majority of CD8 + T cells is affected, while only very small subsets of CD4 + memory T cells show these changes in expression patterns. The l expression of cell surface inhibitory receptors is reminiscent of clonal exhaustion, where chronic high-dose antigen stimulation induces high expression of the inhibitory receptor PD-1, LAG-3 and TIM-3 (refs. 108, 109 ). In the murine chronic LCMV infection model, in vivo blockade of PD1-PD-L1 signaling rescues interferon-\u03b3 production, proliferation and cytotoxic activity of virus-specific CD8 + T cells and reduces viral load. The findings are paralleled in several human chronic viral infections, such as HIV, HBV and HCV. ICompared to exhausted CD8 + T cells, different classes of molecules are expressed with aging which generally do not co-segregate in the same T cell subsets with PD1, LAG-3 and TIM-3. These proteins include members of the killer Ig-like receptors (KIRs), killer cell lectin-like receptors (KLRs), in particular KLRG1 and CD85j of the immunoglobulin-like transcript (ILT) family 107 . Although T cell exhaustion and ageassociated expression of negative regulatory receptors appear to be different programs 110 , their functional consequences may be similar and blockade of these receptors may be beneficial to improve anti-viral CD8 + T cell responses. Contrary to this model, we have preliminary evidence that negative regulatory receptors expressed during aging selectively inhibit proliferation while keeping effector function intact (own unpublished observation). They therefore may serve a beneficial function to maintain a diverse T cell repertoire by limiting the clonal expansion of selected virus-specific clones.",

The dependence of many B cell responses on T cell help adds another level of complexity. Regenerative capacity of B cells is compromised due to very similar mechanisms as discussed for the mouse. As a consequence, the number of na\u00efve B cells is reduced. Depending on whether CD19 or CD20 is used to define B cells, total numbers of B cells are slightly or not decreased due to expansion of cells expressing a classical memory or less defined phenotypes 69, 70 . Repertoire diversity is compressed, in particular in those individuals who are frail and not in good health 71 . Several lines of evidence exist that limitations in the available B cell repertoire impair the antibody response. Using high throughput parallel sequencing, the lineage structure of prevaccination antibody repertoire in elderly individuals is clearly contracted and the mutation load is higher 56 . Influenza vaccine responses in the adult highly rely on somatic mutation of the memory repertoire rather than recruitment of new antibody sequences. Even the B cell response against the 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza virus was dominated by antibodies broadly cross-reactive on hemagglutinin epitopes of multiple influenza strains 57, 112 . Examination of the circulating antibody-secreting cells after influenza vaccination in ELISPOT assays revealed a nearly tenfold reduction in frequencies while the functionality of plasmablasts were not impaired 113 . In summary, the data are consistent with the model that the pre-existing repertoire restricts the quantitative response in the elderly. Differences in the quality of the response were less consistent and, if found, may be due to preexisting hypermutations in prevaccination B cells, limiting the ability to optimize the fit of antibodies to newly arising variants. Alternatively, a recent study has correlated a lower induction of AID expression in the elderly with reduced affinity maturation after H1N1 vaccination and production of lower affinity antibodies 114 . Reduced AID induction may be an intrinsic defect in elderly B cells and caused by a defective expression of the transcription factor E47 and associated with defective immunoglobulin class switch recombination in na\u00efve or IgM memory B cells 115 . E47 induction is also regulated by CD40L-mediated signals raising the possibility that the reduced expression is caused by a T cell defect. Indeed, we have shown that restoring T cell helper function by silencing DUSP4 in T cells improved E47 induction in B cells 99 . Obviously, both mechanisms are not mutually exclusive but can be synergistic (Fig. 3) .",

            "text": "With changing demographics around the globe, often described as \"the grey tsunami\", improving vaccine responses in the elderly is not an option, it is a necessity. Progress over the last decade in optimizing vaccine success has been modest, however, the chances for success are not as dim as sometimes thought. Strategies in creating better vaccines have mostly been modeled on vaccine responses in the young or have relied on studying immune aging in the mouse. We have only just begun to unravel how the immune system ages in humans and to identify molecular pathways that can be targeted to specifically improve the vaccine response in the elderly (Table 3 ). Responses to vaccines in the older adult will inevitably depend on available resources in terms of T and B cells, yet, repertoire maintenance in the human adult appears to be relatively robust and not heavily reliant on de novo generation of new B and T cells. Restoring B and T precursor cell generation in the bone marrow or rejuvenating thymic function are challenging objectives and certainly not easily applicable, but may not be a primary necessity for healthy immune aging. Exceptions are individuals whose lymphocyte repertoire has been wiped out by medical interventions or by HIV infection. Available data from studying repertoire contraction in CMV infection and anti-H1N1 influenza responses suggest that a diverse memory T and B cell repertoire is as important as maintaining the na\u00efve repertoire. In the very old, severe contraction of the repertoire variably occurs and appears to be a consequence of abnormal peripheral cell growth and survival. Since a multi-hit model best predicts the repertoire collapse in the very old, identifying and preventing single factors may be sufficient to avert substantial loss in diversity. Increased levels of inflammatory cytokines, also termed inflamm-aging, and tissue aging that have been reviewed elsewhere 40, 116 certainly contribute to defective vaccine responses. Cell intrinsic changes that impair T and B cell activation and differentiation are rather subtle and may be overcome by temporally limited interventions at the time of vaccination. Negative feedback loops in signaling and cellular metabolism emerge as important pathways to understand and potentially modulate the behavior of aging T cells. The cartoon illustrates the T cell receptor repertoire within the na\u00efve and memory CD4 compartments with sizes of circles symbolizing different clonal sizes. By the end of the growth period, a diverse na\u00efve repertoire has been established in the young adult. Irrespective of thymic activity, the na\u00efve compartment only moderately decreases in size during the next decades in life while mostly maintaining overall diversity and distribution of clonal sizes. An abrupt contraction is seen in later life. Memory responses to latent infection with cytomegalovirus and herpes zoster virus (VZV) are established in the memory compartment, but behave very differently to aging. While clonal frequencies and sizes of VZV-specific clones decline with age (yellow circles), T cell clones specific for CMV (red circles) dominate the repertoire in the elderly and contribute to the contraction in diversity in the memory compartment.",

DUSP4 is a nuclear phosphatase that curtails sustained pERK and pJNK activity and impairs the ability of the T cell to provide help to B cells. As a consequence of defective CD40-ligand signaling, B cell activation and expression of the transcription factor E47 is impaired. Defective T cell help coincides with an age-associated intrinsic B cell defect to express E47 and as a consequence transcribe AID. As a consequence, B cell clonal expansion, immunoglobulin class switch recombination and hypermutation are impaired. With increasing age, oligoclonal populations of terminally differentiated effector T cells accumulate that are frequently specific for latent viruses, in particular cytomegalovirus. These T cells differ in phenotype, function and survival from exhausted T cells that develop in response to highly replicating viruses. ",
