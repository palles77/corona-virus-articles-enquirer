The cardiac injury was dominate in the process. However, whether N terminal pro B type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) predicted outcome of COVID-19 patients was unknown. The study initially enrolled 102 patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia from a continuous sample. After screening out the ineligible cases, 54 patients were analyzed in this study. Results found that patients with higher NT-proBNP (above 88.64 pg/mL) level had more risks of inhospital death. After adjusting for potential cofounders in separate modes, NT-proBNP presented as an independent risk factor of in-hospital death in patients with severe COVID-19. : medRxiv preprint Figure 1.

The best NT-proBNP cut-off was that of the highest product of sensitivity and specificity for in-hospital death prediction. Cumulative survival curves of in-hospital death were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier product-limit estimation method with the log-rank test. Spearman correlation analyzing was used to investigate the coefficients of NT-proBNP with selected covariates. Cox proportional hazards models were used to screening out the potential risk factors and analyzing the independent effect of NT-proBNP on in-hospital death. Statistical analyses were performed by SPSS 22.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA) and a two-sided P<0.05 was considered statistically significant.",

Further understanding of physiological and pathological significance of plasma NT-proBNP elevation in severe COVID-19 patients might help clinicians make corresponding decisions to reduce the risks of adverse outcome. The prognostic effect of NT-proBNP might indicate the extent of cardiac stress and inflammation. Previous reports have pointed that heart injury of severe patients with new coronary pneumonia is very prominent and cardiac death has become an important cause of death of patients with COVID-19 5,6 . The mechanism of COVID-19 associated cardiac injury was still unclear. From the result of autopsy by Xu and colleagues, a few interstitial mononuclear inflammatory infiltrates were observed in heart biopsy, indicating an inflammation induced cardiac injury 12 . Other factors including the SARS-CoV-2 infection and invasion cardiomyocytes via the binding site of angiotensinconverting enzyme-related carboxypeptidase (ACE2)13 , the pulmonary infection induced inadequate oxygen supply to the myocardium and the influences of cytokine storm syndrome[14][15][16] might also contribute to the cardiac injury17 .",

The latter exerts anti-inflammation effect to protect tissue while ANGII plays in an opposite role and facilitating the secretion of NT-proBNP 18-20 , indicating the NT-proBNP level might associated with the severity of infection, which needs further verification. Font-line doctors pointed that some non-survivors with severe COVID-19 pneumonia died without warning. By investigating the prognostic effect of NP-proBNP level of severe COVID-19 patients at admission, it might be helpful to identifying patients with poor prognoses early.
