Neurologic symptoms are usually prominent at presentation and can include cognitive impairment, ataxia, and psychosis [10, 11] . Severe respiratory distress and liver failure at presentation have also been reported [11] . Intracellular cobalamin is derived from ingested exogenous cobalamin (vitamin B12) available in several food types (e.g. fish, red meat, fortified Fig. 1 Longitudinal view of left kidney: normal corticomedullary differentiation and cortical echogenicity can be seen cereals, low fat milk, eggs and cheese). It plays an important role in cellular DNA synthesis and deficiencies, especially affecting rapidly dividing cells [11, 12] . After its uptake by cells, exogenous cobalamin is converted into two active coenzyme derivatives: methylcobalamin (MeCbl) and adenosylcobalamin (AdoCbl). MeCbl is essential for the conversion of homocystine to methionine by the cytoplasmic enzyme methionine synthase [9, 12] . AdoCbl is a cofactor of the mitochondrial enzyme methylmalonyl coenzyme A (CoA) mutase, which converts L-methyl-malonyl-CoA to succinyl-CoA. When a homozygous mutation in the MMACHC gene is present, MeCbl will not metabolize homocysteine to methionine and AdoCbl will not metabolize L-methylmalonyl-CoA to succinyl-CoA [10, 12] . In Cbl C disease, this deficiency leads to elevated levels of homocysteine (and Lmethylmalonyl-CoA) which is suspected as being responsible for the endothelial damage and TMA [10, 12] . As a result of cobalamin metabolism abnormalities, the most common biological hallmarks of Cbl C disease, in addition to hyperhomocysteinemia, are low blood methionine levels and methylmalonic aciduria [10, 12] .",

Prognosis is variable, but high mortality rates are reported [16, 17] . Timely treatment can improve outcome with better growth, hematological improvement and preservation of renal function [11] . However, developmental delay due to neurological involvement and visual complications may persist and/or worsen [11] . The case reported here presented a considerable diagnostic challenge. Our patient presented with severe neurological and circulatory involvement, and initially the origin of the problem was unclear. Renin-mediated hypertension inducing encephalopathy secondary to posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) and left ventricular dysfunction secondary to increased preload was at the core of this clinical conundrum. In retrospect, initial fluid therapy most likely increased the preload of the left ventricle, worsening left ventricular failure and pulmonary edema and thereby adding to circulatory and respiratory failure. The suspicion of underlying renal dysfunction as the primary cause arose when ultrasound images were reviewed. The detected increased corticomedullary differentiation, typically associated with vasculitis [18] [19] [20] , was crucial in directing the additional diagnostic workup. Increased fragmentocytes in the blood smear also pointed towards TMA, leading to the workup for atypical HUS. Low albumin and thyroid hormone levels were secondary to significant proteinuria. Plasma homocysteine levels were rapidly assessed, which enabled quick confirmation of this condition and treatment. Low methionine levels and methylmalonic aciduria are also usually seen in Cbl C disease [11] , but these were absent in this case. This atypical phenotype could possibly be explained by the compound heterozygous mutations of the MMACHC gene found, consisting of two different mutations in the paternal and maternal alleles instead of the usual homozygous pattern of inheritance.",

The IV administration of beta blockers, which are first line agents, were contraindicated in light of left ventricular failure [21] , and we decided to initiate treatment with a continuous IV infusion of an calcium channel antagonist (nicardipine) which allowed for gradual reduction of BP and the possibility to quickly adjust dosages. Other alternatives under consideration were hydralizine (vasodilator), fenoldopam (dopamine receptor agonist) and diazoxide (direct vasodilator) [21] . In treating malignant hypertension it is important to adhere to guidelines, as mentioned earlier, in order to prevent cerebral ischemia [21] . This case illustrates the importance of early ultrasound imaging in suspected AKI. Renal ultrasound traditionally performed to exclude obstructive causes can provide crucial information in discerning parenchymal causes of AKI, as illustrated in this case. Cbl C disease needs to be included in any workup of TMA regardless of the age at presentation. Early treatment of this condition can be effective, but long-term neurological and retinal sequelae may persist.",
