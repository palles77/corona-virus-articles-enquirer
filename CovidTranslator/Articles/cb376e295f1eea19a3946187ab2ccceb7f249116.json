            "text": "E-mail address: manon.cox@proteinsciences.com Advances in molecular virology are providing new ways of controlling viral replication and virulence and may lead to the new generation of safer, more widely applicable LAV vaccines [23] . The manufacturing of LAV requires growth of attenuated strains in large quantities. Thirteen (13) of these vaccines are inactivated or derivates of pathogens such as polysaccharides. These vaccines, while alleviating the potential safety concern posed by LAV, are obtained by cultivating often highly pathogenic organisms in large quantities that pose a potential exposure risk for the workers and the environment. Only two (2) out of twenty (20) recommended vaccines are recombinant protein vaccines. The first available recombinant sub-unit Hepatitis B vaccines, ENGERIX-B \u00ae (GSK) or RECOMBIVAX HB \u00ae (Merck), were licensed in 1986 and gradually replaced the plasma-derived hepatitis B vaccine [2] . This vaccine is a purified surface antigen (HBsAg) of the virus obtained by culturing genetically engineered Saccharomyces cerevisiae (S. Poliomyelitis is an acute communicable disease of humans; vaccination has led to polio control (and, since 1988, polio eradication) Inactivated or live-attenuated oral vaccine derived from three serotypes DTP (Diphtheria [4] , Tetanus [5] and Pertussis [6] ) cerevisiae) cells. The antigen is purified by several physicochemical steps and formulated as a suspension of the antigen adsorbed on aluminum hydroxide. It took nearly twenty years before the next recombinant vaccines, GARDASIL \u00ae (Merck) and CERVARIX \u00ae , (GSK) were licensed [12] . This human papilloma virus vaccine consists of purified L1 structural protein (major capsid) produced either in S. cerevisiae cells (GARDASIL) or in the baculovirus expression vector system (CERVARIX). The advantage of recombinant vaccines is that they do not contain the pathogen or its genetic material and therefore cannot cause disease. In addition, recombinant vaccines do not depend on the cultivation of (pathogenic) organisms and offer the potential to utilize flexible multipurpose manufacturing facilities. However, both inactivated and recombinant vaccines have in general been less efficacious than their LAV counterparts and, therefore, often require the use of adjuvants.",

This protein production platform has been extensively explored for the production of viral and parasitic antigens [24] and, more recently, vaccines have been commercialized demonstrating its potential as a commercial manufacturing technology [25] . Baculoviruses are insect pathogens that can cause fatal disease in lepidopteran, dipteran and hymenopteran larvae, resulting in their use as biocontrol agents of insect pests in agriculture and forestry. They are characterized by their narrow host range [26] and their inability to replicate in vertebrates, including man. Baculoviruses are commonly found on green vegetables and, therefore, are part of the daily diet of healthy individuals. For example, a typical serving of coleslaw contains 112 million polyhedra, each containing multiple baculovirus virions [27] . The baculovirus particles or virions contain a large doublestranded DNA genome that on average, depending on the virus species, is 130 kb pairs in size. It can be easily characterized, genetically manipulated and propagated in cell lines derived from a.o. the fall armyworm Spodoptera frugiperda (SF) or the cabbage looper Trichoplusia ni (T. ni) [28] , both of which grow well in suspension cultures [29] .",

This marked the beginning of the BEVS expression era and since then thousands of proteins have been produced using the polyhedrin promoter or later the p10 promoter to drive expression. Insect cells have the capability of performing many of the post-translational modifications such as glycosylation, disulfide bond formation and phosphorylation required for the biological activity of many complex proteins [31] .

For example, the development of FluBlok has taken nearly twenty years and the estimated development costs approach $100 million even though the scientific challenges in this program were limited because hemagglutinin (HA) is the established protective antigen for influenza and the disease is quite well understood, making the clinical development rather straightforward.

Current vaccine costs are high and typically exceed $1000 for a course of rabies immune globulin and five doses of vaccine given over a four (4)-week period [58] . Thus, there is an urgent need for a cheaper rabies vaccine. The rabies virus (RABV) belongs to the genus Lyssavirus in the family Rhabdoviridae. The RNA of RABV encodes five proteins, including the G glycoprotein that carries the main antigenic sites. Human infection usually occurs following a transdermal bite or scratch by an infected animal. Already in 1993, Fu et al. [56] showed that protein G produced in insect cells was effective in vaccinating racoons against rabies. Unfortunately, and surprisingly, not much additional progress has been made since.",

The JE virus causes at least 50,000 cases of clinical disease each year, mostly among children aged <10 years, resulting in about 10,000 deaths and 15,000 cases of long-term, neuro-psychiatric sequelae. The JE virus is a member of the genus Flavivirus of the Flaviviridae family, which comprises about 70 viruses including dengue, yellow fever, and West Nile viruses. The virion consists of a single-stranded RNA molecule enclosed by the core membrane and the envelope (E) protein. The E protein contains the antigenic determinants responsible for hemagglutination and neutralization and induces protective immunity in the host. Therefore, the E antigen is a promising target for vaccine development. The antigen produced in insect cells forms particulates that are biochemically and biophysically equivalent to the authentic antigens obtained from infected C6/36 mosquito and is able to induce neutralizing antibody titers in mice [52] .",

The capital investment required to establish production capacity and the production yield are key drivers for the cost of goods. For example, doubling the capital investment cost from $70 to 140 million increases the cost per dose by 40%, and doubling the yield (or output per L) reduces the cost per dose by 100%. The BEVS may be an attractive choice as manufacturing capacity exists, thereby reducing the investment to an absolute minimum and recombinant protein yields are high and multiple opportunities for further improvement exist as described below. The process steps to produce a recombinant protein in insect cells are shown in Fig. 1 . As described earlier the protective antigen is inserted into the baculovirus to generate the recombinant virus (\"plug and play\") that is amplified in insect cells to generate the Working Virus Bank (WVB). The insect cells are grown in a bioreactor and infected with the WVB that has been expanded in insect cells at a scale that is approximately 100-fold smaller than the protein production bioreactor. Cells are separated from the media using centrifugation and, dependent on the product that is being produced, either the cell paste or the supernatant is further processed. The protein of interest is solubilized (when applicable) and processed using depth filtration. It is then captured using column chromatography and further purified using additional chromatography. Potential further contaminants can be removed, if required, using membrane filtration technology and, finally, the product is brought into its final buffer composition using ultrafiltration. The process steps indicated in italics are routinely used in monoclonal antibody production. Many of such production facilities have become obsolete as a result of yield improvements achieved in mammalian cell culture manufacturing processes and these facilities could be used for insect cell based production processes.",

It is estimated that sufficient monovalent bulk protein capacity exists worldwide to produce approximately 9 million doses containing 15 g of rHA in a 5-day cycle. As reported by Fedson and Dunnill [63] 425 million doses of vaccine containing 10 g/dose could be produced within one month if 25% of the global bioreactor capacity (or 500,000-L) were to be allocated to rHA vaccine production. In order to address the potential threat of a pandemic, WHO has taken a major initiative to increase the global and equitable access to influenza vaccine through technology transfer [64] . Eleven vaccine manufacturers based in Brazil, Egypt, India, Indonesia, Iran, Mexico, Republic of Korea, Romania, Serbia, Thailand and Vietnam were selected to participate in this program. The majority of the effort was based on producing inactivated influenza vaccines in embryonated chicken eggs. Tremendous progress has been made; however, it has become apparent that it is difficult to maintain production capacity for a pandemic in the absence of a regular buyer for vaccine [65] . Hence, sustainability of vaccine supply cannot be guaranteed unless there is an economic motive to maintain that capacity. A BEVS production facility could rapidly be changed over to produce a pandemic influenza vaccine when needed from making other vaccines that are more needed in the absence of a pandemic threat.",

Opportunities include exploration of alternative baculovirus promoters, such as the p10/p6.9 chimaeric promoter [66, 67] , modified baculoviruses such as the cathepsin-/chitinase-negative AcM-NPV bacmid [68] or development of fed-batch fermentation processes [69] [70] [71] . Yield improvement has also frequently been reported as a result of improved cell culture media. Additions of plant hydrolysates, other growth and production enhancing factors and control of proteolysis were reviewed by Ikonomou et al. [72] and offer promise for yield improvement. Specifically, adding the plant hydrolysate, Hypep 1510 to an insect cell culture resulted in a doubling of expression of a reporter gene [73] but, also, simple changes in pH may offer great benefit [74] . Finally, it has been shown that viral and host modifications can improve cell survival and production of heterologous proteins. Modifications to the host insect cell line, for example by including the anti-apoptotic gene Bcl-2, may limit the cytopathic effects of the baculovirus and may result in enhanced expression such as was recently reported for Sindbis virus in a mammalian cell line [75] . Co-expression of chaperones may also be a promising prospect for efficient production of recombinant secretory proteins in insect cells as was recently reported by, for instance, Kato et al. [76] .",

Furthermore, there are many opportunities for process improvements that will enable an even greater reduction in production cost, including molecular biology approaches, media development and alternative cell culture strategies. It was shown previously that 40-fold improvements in antibody production in mammalian cells could be obtained by implementation of a continuous fed-batch process [78] . The worldwide overcapacity for mammalian protein manufacturing reduces the capital investment required for BEVS production to an absolute minimum.

Vaccines against zoonotic diseases caused, for example, by Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), West Nile Virus, Chikungunya Virus, Marburg Virus and Ebola Virus are desperately needed and the BEVS technology provides a great opportunity to develop such vaccines. Surface antigens offer a promising fast approach as exemplified by the virus neutralizing antibodies induced by the spike protein antigen derived from SARS coronavirus [81] . However, it is important to acknowledge that it may not be easy or even feasible to identify the antigen that offers protection as demonstrated by the failure to develop an effective vaccine against HIV over the past two decades. While the insect cell production technology could be deployed to develop other inexpensive, safe and efficacious vaccines listed in Table 4 , it should be noted that subunit vaccines do not always generate potent immune responses needed for the protection against certain pathogens. Especially for diseases like polio, rotavirus, measles, rubella, yellow fever, and mumps, where safe, effective and affordable LAV candidates are available, it may not be useful to pursue development of recombinant vaccines at this time. It would also be useful to explore safe and effective adjuvants to stimulate immune response.",
