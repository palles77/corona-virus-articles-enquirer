            "text": "The avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is the prototype species of the Coronaviridae, a family of enveloped viruses with large positive-stranded RNA genomes. Six mRNA species (mRNAs 1\u00b16) are involved in the expression of IBV genes. Among them, the 27.6-kb genome-length mRNA, mRNA 1, is composed of two large overlapping ORFs (1a and 1b) at the 5\u0408-unique region and has the capacity to encode a fusion polyprotein of 741 kDa by a ribosomal frameshifting mechanism Brierley et al., 1987 Brierley et al., , 1989 . Proteolytic processing of the 441-kDa 1a polyprotein and the 741-kDa 1a/1b fusion polyprotein to smaller functional products is expected to be mediated by viral proteinases. Three proteinase domains, namely, two overlapping papain-like and a picornavirus 3C-like proteinase domains, have been predicted to be encoded by the ORF 1a sequences from nucleotide 4243 to 5553 and from 8937 to 9357, respectively (Gorbalenya et al., 1989; Lee et al., 1991) .",

The two overlapping papain-like proteinase domains and cellular proteinase(s) were demonstrated to be involved in processing of the 1a polyprotein to an 87-kDa protein . The 3C-like proteinase is responsible for processing of the 1a and 1a/1b polyproteins to a 10-and a 100-kDa protein (Liu et al., 1994 (Liu et al., , 1997 . Proteolytic processing of the 1a and 1a/1b polyproteins by the equivalent proteinase activities of human coronavirus and mouse hepatitis virus has also been documented. In the case of human coronavirus, four mature products have been identified so far. These include a 34-kDa protein representing the 3C-like proteinase, a 105-kDa protein corresponding to the 100-kDa protein of IBV, a 71-kDa protein with an ATPase activity and a 41-kDa protein processed from the 1b polyprotein (Ziebuhr et al., 1995; Grotzinger et al., 1996; Heusipp et al., 1997a,b) . Similarly, three mature products, including two N-terminal cleavage products of 28 and 65 kDa and a 27-kDa protein identified as the 3C-like proteinase, have been reported for mouse hepatitis virus (Denison and Perlman, 1987; Denison et al., 1995; Lu et al., 1995) .",

By using a regionspecific antiserum (anti-24) raised in rabbits against the IBV sequence encoded between nucleotides 10928 and 11493, the 24-kDa polypeptide was immunoprecipitated from IBV-infected but not from mock-infected Vero cells. Coexpression, deletion, and mutagenesis studies demonstrated that this polypeptide was encoded by ORF 1a between nucleotides 10915 and 11544 and was cleaved from the 1a polyprotein by the 3C-like proteinase. Substitution mutation studies suggested that the predicted Q 3462 S 3463 dipeptide bond was responsible for the release of the N terminus, and the Q 3672 N 3673 dipeptide bond was responsible for the release of the C terminus of the 24-kDa protein.",

In an effort to identify more viral polypeptides encoded by ORF 1a, a region-specific antiserum, anti-24, was raised in rabbits against a bacterially expressed protein containing the IBV sequence encoded between nucleotides 10928 and 11493. This antiserum was then used to test if specific viral products can be identified from IBV-infected Vero cells. For this purpose, confluent monolayers of Vero cells were infected with IBV at a multiplicity of infection of approximately 2 PFU per cell. The cells were labeled with [ 35 S]methionine at 6 or 14 h postinfection and were harvested 4 h after labeling. Cell lysates were prepared and immunoprecipitated with anti-IBV, anti-24, and antiserum V47. Antiserum V47 was raised against the IBV sequence encoded between nucleotides 11488 and 12600 and was used successfully in the identification of a 10-kDa protein in IBV-infected cells (Liu et al., 1997) . Figure 1 shows the results of this experiment using lysate prepared from Vero cells harvested at 10 h postin-fection. As can be seen, a protein with an apparent molecular weight of approximately 24 kDa was specifically precipitated with anti-24 antiserum from IBV-infected, but not from mock-infected Vero cell lysates (Fig.  1) . Immunoprecipitation of the same cell lysate with antiserum V47, once again, led to the detection of the 10-kDa protein ( Fig. 1) (also see Liu et al., 1997) . No obvious difference in abundance of the 24-kDa protein was observed from lysates prepared from cells harvested at 10 and 18 h postinfection (data not shown).",

Coexpression of pBP5 with pIBV3C resulted in the detection of the 10-kDa protein and a product with an apparent molecular weight of approximately 24 kDa; the 10-and 24-kDa products were specifically immunoprecipitated by anti-24 and antiserum V47, respectively (Fig. 2b) .

Plasmid DNAs were expressed in Vero cells using the vaccinia virus-T7 expression system described in Fuerst et al. (1986) . Fifty to eighty percent confluent monolayers of Vero cells in 35-mm dishes were infected with a recombinant vaccinia virus (vTF7-3) and were transfected with plasmid DNA using DOSPER according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Boehringer Mannheim).

We have noted that the apparent molecular weight of 38 kDa of the fusion protein is slightly larger than its calculated molecular weight of 35 kDa. This discrepancy may be due to some minor conformational changes of the fusion protein. Nevertheless, these results demonstrate that a substitution mutation of the Q 3672 N 3673 dipeptide bond to EN abolishes cleavage occurring at this position and suggest that the Q 3672 N 3673 dipeptide bond is the C-terminal cleavage site of the 24-kDa protein.

From its apparent molecular weight of 55 kDa, this product may be a fusion protein covering both the 24-and the 10-kDa proteins as well as a putative downstream cleavage product of 17 kDa (see Fig. 2a ). As this putative product was flanked by two confirmed cleavage sites of the 3C-like proteins, i.e., the C terminal cleavage site (Q 3783 S 3784 ) of the 10-kDa protein and the N-terminal cleavage site (Q 3928 S 3929 ) of the 100-kDa protein (see Fig. 2a ), and no other potential cleavage site was found to be located between these two sites, it is unlikely that further cleavage may occur in this region. To support this, we have reported that coexpression of pIBV3C with pBP5\u232c4Q 3783 -E, which covers the IBV sequence from nucleotide 11568 to 12312 and contains a mutation of the Q 3783 S 3784 to ES, resulted in the detection of only the full-length product and trace amount of cleavage product derived from cleavage at the Q 3783 S 3784 site (Liu et al., 1997) . No other cleavage product was detected (Liu et al., 1997) , suggesting that this putative 17-kDa protein may represent a mature cleav-age product of the 1a polyprotein.

These include an 87-kDa protein encoded by the first 2.6-kb region of ORF1a and a 10-and a 100-kDa protein encoded by the IBV sequences from nucleotide 11545 to 11877 and 12313 to 15131, respectively (Liu et al., 1994 (Liu et al., , 1997 . The 100-kDa protein may be the viral polymerase as a putative RNA-dependent RNA polymerase domain was identified in the region coding for this protein (Gorbalenya et al., 1989) . So far, no functional roles have been assigned to the 87-, 24-, and 10-kDa protein species. As systems for molecular genetic analysis of the IBV replication machinery are not yet available, it is still difficult to determine the functions of these products in the virus life cycle. However, analysis of their amino acid sequences by computer-aided programs showed that the 24-and 10-kDa proteins may contain hydrophobic/transmembrane domains (data not shown), indicating that they may be hydrophobic proteins. Small hydrophobic viral proteins are usually associated with host cell membranes. This membrane-association property may play an important role in viral RNA replication, as it could act as anchorage of replication complexes. For example, a 6-kDa viral protein from tobacco etch virus was recently shown to be an integral membrane protein associated with large vesicular compartments derived from the endoplasmic reticulum of the host cells (Schaad et al., 1997) . This interaction is proposed to be essential for targeting of the viral RNA replication complexes to membranous sites of replication. Small hydrophobic viral proteins, such as the enterovirus 2B protein, have also been shown to be able to increase membrane permeability of the host cells, causing membrane lesions and facilitating release of the virus progeny (van Kuppeveld et al., 1997) . It is currently unclear if similar functions may be played by the 24-and 10-kDa proteins during the IBV replication cycle.",

(1984) . Briefly, the virus was passaged three times in 11-day-old chicken embryos and then adapted to Vero cells (ATCC CCL-81) by a series of passages at 24-to 48-h intervals. The cytopathic effects, including syncytium formation and rounding up of cells, were initially observed after three passages in Vero cells. Virus stocks were prepared after the 34th passage by infecting monolayers of Vero cells at a multiplicity of infection of approximately 0.1 PFU/cell. The virus was harvested at 24 h postinfection and the titer of the virus preparation was determined by plaque assay on Vero cells.",

Plasmid pBP5Q 3462 -E was coexpressed with pIBV3C in Vero cells using the vaccinia virus-T7 expression system. Cells were labeled with [ 35 S]methionine and total cell lysates were either analyzed directly or immunoprecipitated with antiserum V47 and anti-24. Polypeptides were separated on an SDS\u00b116% polyacrylamide gel and detected by fluorography. Numbers indicate molecular masses in kilodaltons.
