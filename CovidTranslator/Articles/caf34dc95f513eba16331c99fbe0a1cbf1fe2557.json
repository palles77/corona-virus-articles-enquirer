We conducted a prospective study on the clinical, radiologic, and hematologic findings of SARS patients with pneumonia, who were admitted to National Taiwan University Hospital from March 8 to June 15, 2003. Fever was the most frequent initial symptom, followed by cough, myalgia, dyspnea, and diarrhea. Twenty-four patients had various underlying diseases. Most patients had elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) levels and lymphopenia. Other common abnormal laboratory findings included leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated levels of aminotransferase, lactate dehydrogenase, and creatine kinase. These clinical and laboratory findings were exacerbated in most patients during the second week of disease. The overall case-fatality rate was 19.7%. By multivariate analysis, underlying disease and initial CRP level were predictive of death.",

Except for the first patient, who did not receive any of the following treatments, and the second, third, and fourth patients, who received steroid in the first week of their disease, all patients received treatments that conformed to the guideline described here. Oral ribavirin was prescribed soon after the diagnosis of SARS was made; the loading dose was 2,000 mg followed by 1,200 mg per day if the body weight was >75 kg, or 1,000 mg per day if the body weight was <75 kg. This treatment lasted 10 days unless adverse effects developed. Antimicrobial agents for community-acquired pneumonia, either moxifloxacin alone or ceftriaxone plus azithromycin, were administered at the same time. Methylprednisolone was usually administered in the second week of the disease if any of the following occurred: a flare of fever, progression of clinical symptoms (such as dyspnea or diarrhea), a surge or resurge of CRP level, or rapid deterioration of chest radiographic findings (development of new infiltration). Methylprednisolone was indicated in the first week of disease only if clinical symptoms or laboratory abnormalities (such as elevated CK, LDH, CRP) worsened rapidly, and rapidly progressed abnormalities were found on chest radiograph. The dosage was 2 mg/kg/day for 5 days, and then it was tapered off. Pulse therapy with methylprednisolone, 500 mg/day for 3 days, was used if there was major disease progress under the standard regimen. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) was administered if severe leukopenia (<2 x 10 9 /L), thrombocytopenia (<100 x 10 9 /L), or both occurred, or if lesions on chest radiography progressed rapidly in the first week of disease. The dosage of IVIG was 1 g/kg/day for 2 days. Once patients were intubated and supported by a mechanical ventilator, respiratory care followed the principles suggested for managing acute respiratory distress syndrome (8) .",

The timing of steroids was modified according to our experiences in treating the second, third, and fourth patients, whose exacerbation of oxygen demand and chest radiography lesions were not prevented by early steroid use. Moreover, steroids are immunosuppressive. A previous study pointed out that the viral load of SARS Co-V in SARS patients arrived at peak levels at approximately day 10 of disease (5). Steroids were used as an adjunctive therapy for infectious diseases to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage that could occur in the later stage of disease (12) . Using steroids was also a risk factor for subsequent nosocomial infection (13) . For all these reasons, we delayed the use of steroids. Among the 65 patients who received steroids as the treatment protocol, 15 (23.1%) had rebound or persistence of fever after initial steroid use. This fever rebound is less frequent than in prior reports (43.3%-85.3%) (5, 6) . However, the overall death rate in our study was similar to that reported from Hong Kong (7%-20.9%) (3, 5) . Comparing the treatment results of our study and previous ones is difficult because of different case definitions, patient backgrounds, and disease severity, as well as obscure descriptions about complications in SARS patients in previous reports. All our patients had severe cases. Therefore, the best timing of starting steroid usage and the total duration of steroid usage in SARS patients to improve treatment outcome remain unclear and need further study. Hemophagocytotic syndrome was documented in our second patient by bone marrow biopsy (14) . Her initial clinical signs and symptoms included fever, severe leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia. Her hemophagocytotic syndrome was relieved after using IVIG. This treatment was suggested because of its immune modulating effect (15) . The other 21 patients in whom severe leukopenia or thrombocytopenia developed in the first week of disease also received IVIG therapy empirically. IVIG appeared effective for controlling leukopenia and thrombocytopenia: after infusion, the patients' leukocyte and platelet counts increased to a significantly higher level (p = 0.002). The increase of leukocyte and platelet counts might have prevented some further complications directly resulting from severe leukopenia and thrombocytopenia, such as infection and tendency to bleed. Although we had no control group, we believe that IVIG may play a role in treating selected SARS patients.",

By univariate analysis, many parameters predicted death or respiratory failure (Table 3) . However, by using the logistic regression model for multivariate analysis, severe underlying disease and high initial CRP level were the only two factors that predicted death; age, initial CRP level, and worst chest radiographic findings predicted respiratory failure. The role of CRP in predicting the outcome of SARS patients has not been discussed in previous studies (4, 5, 16) . The discovery of CRP was reported in 1930 by Tillet and Francis (17) . CRP parallels the severity of inflammation or tissue injury and is a useful marker for disease, response to therapy, and ultimate recovery (18, 19) . Although initial CRP level was not available in eight patients in this cohort, our findings suggest that CRP also parallels well with the severity and outcome of SARS patients. Age and underlying disease were strongly correlated: all our patients with severe underlying disease were older (age >65 years). In a statistical model, these two factors might interfere with each other and lead to the conclusion that age, not underlying disease, was an independent risk for respiratory failure; however, the opposite was true. The worst chest radiographic finding outlined the most severe extent of impaired lung function. This finding might explain why it was an independent factor for respiratory failure. However, other conditions unrelated to pulmonary condition, such as underlying disease or complications during hospitalization, contributed to death. These findings might explain why worst chest radiographic finding was not an independent factor for death.",

Also, during intrahospital SARS outbreaks (11) , heavy clinical loads and frequent bed transfers made it difficult for the primary care physician to collect laboratory data as the schedule described above. Therefore, initial serum LDH level and CRP level were available for only 16 and 68 patients, respectively; thus, initial LDH level could not be factored into our analyses. Since both CRP and LDH are markers of inflammation, whether the initial LDH level is also an independent risk factor for death or respiratory failure needs further study.",

Acute renal failure, which might be more likely caused by methicillin-resistant S. aureus infection and rhabdomyolysis, was found in three patients. Acute myocardial infarction occurred in a patient who had been diagnosed with long-standing coronary artery disease. Gastronintestinal bleeding, which might be due to critical illness, occurred in two patients. Rhabdomyolysis has been reported to be associated with viral infection (20, 21) . Our observation suggests that SARS Co-V infection might also be associated with this complication (22) . Although peripheral neuropathy had also been reported with viral infection (23) , neuropathy caused by steroids or acute illness should also be considered contributing causes in our four patients with neuropathy (24, 25) . Eleven patients had bacterial or fungal superinfection during hospitalization. All nosocomial infections occurred while patients were intubated and supported with a mechanical ventilator (p < 0.001 by Fisher exact test). The nosocomial infection rate among SARS patients was 237 per 1,000 discharges, which was much higher than that of all patients at NTUH (49 per 1,000 discharges) (26) . Steroid use and more severe clinical conditions than usual patients, such as higher rate of respiratory failure, might be the reasons.",
