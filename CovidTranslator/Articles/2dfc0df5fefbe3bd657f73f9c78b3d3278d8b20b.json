These remaining cases were then used in the PIA model to update the aetiology prior a second time to complete the analysis of all cases. Cases positive on pleural fluid similarly had a 'known cause' but due to the small numbers of remaining cases with a confirmed pleural effusion on CXR without pleural fluid findings, these positive results were not used to update their aetiology prior distributions but were used to determine the aetiology of those positive cases after the model was run. For sites with lung aspirate positives, cases are identified as being in one of two groups; one group representative of those with lung aspirates collected (cases with consolidation on CXR), and a second group of cases with other infiltrate. The aetiology analysis has been run on all sites and case groups combined, allowing the aetiologic distribution and false positive rates to vary across sites, and the aetiologic priors to vary by case sub-group within a site (e.g., based on lung aspirate or pleural fluid data), while the data informing sensitivity are from all the sites.

At the Thailand site which had the fewest number of cases and fewest number of blood culture positives, NoS aetiology increased from 5.4% (base) to 23.9%. This finding demonstrates that the amount of pneumonia due to pathogens that are not measured (NoS), which is determined by lack of evidence for the measured pathogens, is hard to quantify. However, this also demonstrates there is evidence in the data for measured pathogens to suggest that NoS is likely less than the prior of 25% because the NoS estimate was >10% lower than the prior for all sites except Thailand, where there was weak data for aetiologic evidence. While a precise estimate for NoS is not possible, the relative magnitude of the aetiology for the measured pathogens remains constant regardless of this assumption (i.e., the distribution of the pathogens tested for is similar).",

Some targets underwent additional confirmatory testing, as described below. 10 \u2022 Klebsiella pneumoniae: Positive results were considered invalid because of poor assay specificity. 17 \u2022 Moraxella catarrhalis: This target was summarized in the descriptive NP/OP PCR analyses but excluded from aetiology analyses due to poor specificity (odds ratio significantly less than 1.0) and inability to determine a density threshold that improved specificity such that is was positively associated with case status. 12 M. catarrhalis is a commensal bacterium that can cause pneumonia but was observed more commonly among controls than among cases. There is some evidence in the literature that presence in the NP/OP may be protective against developing pneumonia. The hypothesized biological rationale is that if the child's microbiome is slanted more toward colonization of M. catarrhalis, it may out compete other more pathogenic organisms. 18 Because the underlying assumption of the analytic model is that what is measured in the NP is a signal of what is in the lung, the statistically significantly higher rate in controls who do not have pneumonia is in direct conflict with this assumption. Therefore, these NP/OP data do not provide useful diagnostic evidence of pneumonia etiology and so are not used. \u2022 Legionella species: Samples positive for Legionella species underwent confirmatory PCR testing using a different extraction method due to contamination of the original extraction reagents. Only one positive remained following confirmatory testing. Although there was only one positive, since we systematically tested for Legionella species and it is thought to be a potential cause of paediatric pneumonia, it was included as a possible cause in the aetiology analysis; this was handled consistently across all sites, including those where no Legionella species positives were detected. Quantitative PCR density thresholds were applied to NP/OP for pathogens with poor specificity (i.e., odds ratio <1) where a threshold that improved distinction between cases and controls could be identified: pneumococcus, H. influenzae, cytomegalovirus, and Pneumocystis jirovecii by NP/OP. [11] [12] [13] Measles was not systematically tested for in the PERCH study. Of all PERCH study enrolled cases, 33 cases were identified who met the PERCH study clinical criteria for measles testing (history of measles in past month, measles rash, measles admission diagnosis, measles discharge diagnosis); the NP/OP swabs from these 33 cases were tested for measles. Of the 33 suspected measles cases, 4 (12.1%) tested positive (Kenya n=2; Mali n=2; all had either an admission or discharge diagnosis of measles), none of whom had a positive CXR. Since measles was not systematically tested for, we elected to remove this as a potential cause in the aetiology analysis and simply describe the number of positives identified in the PERCH study. These four cases were excluded from the aetiology analyses and population aetiology distributions.",

The exchangeable nature of the symmetric Dirichlet prior treats all pathogens equally likely to be the most important cause prior to being updated by PERCH study data. The distribution and uncertainty around the aetiology priors were also specified (i.e., not a fixed point estimate) and assumed that the majority of pneumonia cases were caused by a subset of the pathogens, without specifically indicating which pathogens; this was implemented by using a small hyperparameter ( = 0.1) to make the prior distribution more flexible and the prior uncertainty larger in contrast to under larger values. Even with this assumption, all organisms are included in the analysis (Table 6 ) and have a non-zero aetiologic fraction estimated by the analysis, in contrast to other analytic approaches that exclude pathogens not associated with case status.

The number of pneumococcal blood culture confirmed cases (numerator) was estimated by the number BCx+ for pneumococcus in the control group who met the PERCH study case definition. The denominator was estimated by the number of PERCH-like pneumonias in the control group that had a BCx taken multiplied by the vaccine efficacy against PERCH-defined pneumonia, adjusted for the vaccine efficacy against vaccine-type BCx+ and the percent of BCx+ that was vaccine-type: results were 6.1% in South Africa and 17.7% in The Gambia (both with wide confidence intervals due to small number of vaccine-type BCx+ in controls (n=6 in SA and n=14 in The Gambia). We also conducted a sensitivity analysis assuming the vaccine efficacy against vaccine-type pneumonia was lower for non-bacteraemic cases (50%) than for BCx+ cases (4/6=67% in South Africa and 11/14 =79% in The Gambia): results were 4.6% in South Africa and 11.3% in The Gambia. Restricting analyses to CXR+ cases only reduced the sample size of vaccine-type BCx+ in controls to only 2 in South Africa (too small to analyse) and 10 in The Gambia, which produced similar results as for all cases (18.5% and 13.2% for the sensitivity analysis). Taking the lowest and highest values from these four results (4.6% to 18.5%) and rounding up (because impact of prior antibiotics was not accounted for in these analyses but is adjusted for the in the PIA -see section 6.2.3) produced the range 5-20%.",

Therefore, to determine the sensitivity prior of WB PCR we considered the evidence from the lung aspirate and pleural fluid specimens. Children who are positive on a pleural fluid specimen are likely different from those positive on lung aspirate since they have advanced to the state where the pathogen is able to travel outside the lung and into the pleural space; as such, they are likely to have a higher sensitivity for detection of pneumococcus on whole blood (i.e., more likely that the pathogen also moved into the blood) than for most pneumonia cases.

The adjustment consisted of stratifying the cases and controls within the model by age and site to allow the aetiology to vary by strata. Including all sites and age strata in a single model (i.e., instead of running separate site-age stratified models) enabled estimation of an all-sites-combined aetiology estimate across the strata. The algorithm does this by using the stratum-specific blood culture data, prevalence and odds ratios for NP/OP PCR and pneumococcal WB PCR to inform on aetiology. At the same time the algorithm updates the sensitivity priors of each measurement by combining evidence across the site-age strata to obtain the posterior sensitivity values for the measurements. For example, the model updates the S. pneumoniae NP/OP PCR sensitivity for sites with no S. pneumoniae positive blood cultures based on the fraction of S. pneumoniae positive blood culture cases at other sites who were also S. pneumoniae positive on NP/OP PCR.",

Aetiology priors were not updated at the other sites without lung aspirate data (Table 15 ). Analyses were run for 25,000 iterations; the first 5,000 were excluded as a 'burn-in' stage and the remaining were sampled every 5 th iteration and were averaged to obtain the aetiology probability distribution of each case, ranging from 0% to 100% for each pathogen. At each iteration of the analysis, PIA assigns each case to a specific pathogen based on their measurements, the measurements of the 'population' of the other cases, the control measurements and the sensitivity and aetiology priors. In this Bayesian model, the unknown parameters to be estimated are the true cause of the infection for each child (aetiology) and the sensitivities for each measurement. The set of unknowns is assumed to follow a joint prior distribution representing prior uncertainty about their values. The Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) estimation method simulates a large number of values for all of the unknowns from their posterior distribution given the observed data. In this simulation, the estimate of the aetiology for each pathogen is approximately the average of the individual case probabilities and is provided with a 95% credible interval (CrI), the Bayesian analogue of the confidence interval. Convergence was checked by repeating the analysis multiple times using different starting seed values and comparing the posterior distributions between the runs.",

Decreasing the sensitivity priors for blood culture and NP/OP PCR by 4-to 5-fold only resulted in a <2fold increase in the S. pneumoniae aetiology fraction at all sites except Thailand, where the base estimate was very small (0.4%).An analysis was performed increasing the aetiology prior for S. pneumoniae from 3% to a site-specific estimate based on the pre-Hib vaccine, pre-PCV S. pneumoniae estimate (28%) from Scott JAG et al. 2008 (J.

Given the absence of evidence to develop pathogenspecific estimates, we applied this range to all PCR targets. Diagnostic sensitivity: All the PCR assays have lower limits of detection of around 10-100 copies/mL, therefore, the assays should have high sensitivity to detect target pathogens in the quantities expected during an infection. However, specimen collection and quality issues may reduce the sensitivity so 90% sensitivity was selected as a reasonable estimate. Diagnostic sensitivities are likely to be high for the viruses, which normally replicate in the nasopharynx.
