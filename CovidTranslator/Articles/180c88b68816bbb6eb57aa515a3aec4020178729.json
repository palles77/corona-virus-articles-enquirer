            "text": "20 E-probe Diagnostic for Nucleic acid Analysis (EDNA) is a bioinformatic tool originally 21 developed to detect plant pathogens in metagenomic databases. However, 22 enhancements made to EDNA increased its capacity to conduct hypothesis directed 23 detection of specific gene targets present in transcriptomic databases. To target specific 24 pathogenicity factors used by the pathogen to infect its host or other targets of interest, 25 e-probes need to be developed for transcripts related to that function. In this study, 26 EDNA transcriptomics (EDNAtran) was developed to detect the expression of genes 27 related to aflatoxin production at the transcriptomic level. E-probes were designed from 28 genes up-regulated during A. flavus aflatoxin production. EDNAtran detected gene 29 transcripts related to aflatoxin production in a transcriptomic database from corn, where 30 aflatoxin was produced. The results were significantly different from e-probes being 31 used in the transcriptomic database where aflatoxin was not produced (atoxigenic AF36 32 strain and toxigenic AF70 in Potato Dextrose Broth). 33 34 Maize [1], peanuts [2], tree nuts, dried spices [3] and cottonseed [4] are crops that can 35 be infected during the pre-harvest, post-harvest and/or storage period with Aspergillus 36 flavus Link. This fungus produces polyketide secondary metabolites named aflatoxins. 37",

EDNA has been considered a good candidate to be used as a 286 diagnostic tool in ports of entry, due to its multiplexing capacity and rapidness. Yet, 287 EDNA does not include an analysis of pathogen viability. If DNA-based detection 288 (metagenomic analysis) is positive and viability needs to be addressed, the use of 289 additional tests is not a viable approach for perishable or time-sensitive shipments. 290",

            "text": "Using RNA sequencing and relative quantification of active genes is ideal to infer the 291 viability of plant pathogens. The use of EDNA transcriptomics to infer the production of 292 aflatoxin is a first attempt to introduce a novel strategy by using new sequencing 293 technologies to identify viable plant pathogens. The use of e-probes that are designed 294 on up-regulated genes incorporates an advantage to EDNA transcriptomics over other 295 tools that use RNA sequencing to assess gene expression [37] . The advantage of 296 EDNA transcriptomics over other methods of transcript frequency inference and 297 calculation is that the time-consuming map against the reference genome is not 298 necessary. Instead, we align the sample reads to the highly specific e-probes, which are 299 designed for known up-regulated genes. Directing the analysis to genes that are known 300 to be up-regulated reduces the analysis time tremendously since a mapping against a 301 whole genome is no longer necessary. Where needed total nucleic acids (DNA and 302 RNA) can be extracted from the sample of interest to perform both pathogen detection 303 and gene activity. 304 .

E-probe specificity was verified by local alignment of each e-173 probes with the intended target genome (AF70) using an stringency of 100% identity 174 and query coverage. Metadata information about the gene where it belongs was also 175 retrieved by the EDNAtran e-probe design pipeline.

Free saccharides (glucose, sucrose, raffinose, etc) are localized in the 195 germ of the corn grain when matured non-germinated seeds; however, in germinating 196 corn, the endosperm is used as a source of saccharides [44].
