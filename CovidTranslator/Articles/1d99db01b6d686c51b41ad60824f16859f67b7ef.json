However, due to the conduction of diagnostic testing for SARS-CoV-2 only at CDC and the strain of spectrum of the available diagnostic tools for this newly discovered virus at this time (Phan, 2020) , imaging examination is one of the quick and convenient methods to diagnosis and monitor disease progress during treatment. Nevertheless, imaging findings of pneumonia caused by viruses can be completely different, sometimes overlapping with other infectious and inflammatory diseases. It is mentioned in a recent study includes 21 symptomatic patients at the time of initial presentation that CT findings are variable, ranging from normal to multiple lobes involvement and J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f patients show different radiologic progression (Chung et al., 2020) .
