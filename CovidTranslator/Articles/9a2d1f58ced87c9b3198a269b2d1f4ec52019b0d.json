We aimed to describe the frequency and predictors of virus and bacteria codetection in children with ARI and cough, irrespective of clinical diagnosis. Bilateral nasal swabs, demographic, clinical and risk factor data were collected at enrollment in children aged <15 years presenting to an emergency department with an ARI and where cough was a symptom. Swabs were tested by polymerase chain reaction for 17 respiratory viruses and seven respiratory bacteria. Logistic regression was used to investigate associations between child characteristics and codetection of the organisms of interest. Between December 2011 and August 2014, swabs were collected from 817 (93.3%) of 876 enrolled children, median age 27.7 months (interquartile range 13.9-60.3 months). Overall, 740 (90.6%) of 817 specimens were positive for any organism. Both viruses and bacteria were detected in 423 specimens (51.8%). Factors associated with codetection were age (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) for age <12 months = 4.9, 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.0, 7.9; age 12 to <24 months = 6.0, 95% CI 3.7, 9.8; age 24 to <60 months = 2.4, 95% CI 1.5, 3.9), male gender (aOR 1.46; 95% CI 1.1, 2.0), child care attendance (aOR 2.0; 95% CI 1.4, 2.8) and winter enrollment (aOR 2.0; 95% CI 1.3, 3.0).",

While upper airway specimens (nasopharyngeal swabs) are controversial because they cannot reliably distinguish between carriage and disease [8] , they continue to be widely used in observational and experimental studies of ARI in children, including those attempting to identify associations between organisms and clinical symptoms and/or severity. Notably, the association between viral ARI and the later development of asthma has been based on upper airway specimens [9] . While a causal association between human rhinovirus (hRV) and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections in early life with future asthma has been proposed by cohort studies [9] , these studies did not report on upper airway bacteria that are likely to be important in early immune development and viral infections [10, 11] . Indeed recent larger studies which examined for both bacteria and viruses found that after adjustment for potential confounding factors it was the number of respiratory episodes rather than hRV or RSV infections in early life that were associated with future asthma [12] .",

An Australian observational study of influenza vaccine effectiveness in children aged 6 months to <3 years in 2010 (a low influenza activity season) found 5 (4.3%) of 117 influenza-like illnesses with specimens were influenza virus positive [26] . Similarly, in an Australian cohort study of ARIs in children aged <5 years followed for 12 months that coincided with increased influenza activity, influenza virus was detected in 4% of 543 ARIs where parent-collected nasal specimens were obtained [27] . However, a study from the United States of paediatric ED visits over a 10-year period found the proportion of ARI/fever visits involving confirmed influenza infections ranged from 10 to 48% (median 15%) [28] , while a French study of a rapid influenza diagnostic tests in a paediatric ED setting reported 57% of children presenting with fever without source were positive for influenza virus during an epidemic period [29] . The difference between these and our study are likely to reflect differences in case definitions and that the study was not conducted during an influenza pandemic, during which parents may be more likely to present to an ED if their child is ill. With respect to B. pertussis, the ratios of notifications of pertussis cases against the 5-year means in Queensland for 2012, 2013 and 2014 were 1.4, 0.6 and 0.2 respectively (https://www.health.qld.gov.au/ph/cdb/sru_data.asp), and the declines were evident in all age groups (Lisa McHugh, personal communication, 2015); hence, it is likely that the study period incorporated an interepidemic period, consistent with pertussis trends over time.",

We accounted for prior antibiotic and oral steroid use and illness duration at presentation and did not limit recruitment to children with specific clinical entities, such as pneumonia or wheezing illnesses. The lack of an effect of prior antibiotic exposure likely reflects our reliance on PCR assays rather than culture for bacteria identification. The major limitation of the study is the proportion of children with cough who were screened but not enrolled, particularly those in the younger age groups and those with mild or severe disease, and our results may thus not reflect the population of children with ARI attending an ED. Further limitations include the inability to investigate causality, given the absence of controls and the cross-sectional design, meaning that temporal relationships between codetected organisms could not be examined. However, that was not the intent of our study. The use of anterior nasal rather than nasopharyngeal swabs may have led to an underestimation of bacteria species. However, anterior nasal swabs are less traumatic in young children and facilitate bilateral sampling; a loss in sensitivity for bacteria was considered acceptable for the purposes of the overall study [13] for which the samples were collected. The infrequency of detecting just a single bacterium with a virus precluded investigating the interactions between organisms in greater detail.",

Thirdly, our finding of the significant association of NTHi with RSV should be further investigated in the context of the increasing appreciation that the contribution of NTHi to acute and chronic respiratory diseases is receiving [8] . We are now in an era of recognizing these complexities and the interactions of individual constituents and how this might influence host-specific factors, including immune responses and clinical severity [19] .
