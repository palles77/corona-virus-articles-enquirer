            "text": "Recent human study data has re-established the value of DNA vaccines, especially in priming high-level antigen-specific antibody responses, but also raised questions about the mechanisms responsible for such effects. Whereas previous reports have shown involvement of downstream signaling molecules in the innate immune system, the current study investigated the role of Aim2 as a sensor for DNA vaccines. The Aim2 inflammasome directs maturation of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18 and an inflammatory form of cell death called pyroptosis. Both the humoral and cellular antigen-specific adaptive responses were significantly reduced in Aim2 \u2212/\u2212 mice in an IL-1\u03b2/IL-18 independent manner after DNA vaccination. Surprisingly, Aim2 \u2212/\u2212 mice also exhibited significantly lower levels of IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 at the site of injection. These results indicate a previously unreported link between DNA vaccine induced pyroptotic cell death and vaccine immunogenicity that is instrumental in shaping the antigen specific immune response to DNA vaccines.",

However, in early clinical studies, the immunogenicity of DNA vaccines in humans was low when such vaccines were used alone. More recent human trials have demonstrated that DNA vaccines are actually extremely powerful in priming the host's immune system to develop high level protective antibody responses against HIV-1 and pandemic influenza viruses (3, (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) . Animal studies further demonstrated that DNA immunization is effective in eliciting higher levels of antigen-specific B cell responses (12) . One mechanism to achieve such an outcome is that DNA vaccination is effective in eliciting higher germinal center (GC) B cell development via enhanced follicular helper T (T f h) cells for the production of high quality antibody responses (13) .",

DNA vaccines produce immunogens in vivo, which are then presented to the immune system via the endogenous antigen processing pathway. At the same time, the DNA plasmid itself confers an intrinsic adjuvant effect that enhances the immune response generated towards the vaccine-encoded immunogens (13, 14) , but the intracellular processes involved remain to be fully elucidated. Several pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs) have been identified which respond to DNA molecules (15, 16) . One of the best-characterized DNA sensing PRRs is the endosomal TLR9, which is essential for the recognition of unmethylated CpG containing oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN) motifs commonly found in bacterial plasmids (17) . As DNA vaccine plasmid backbones contain certain CpG:ODN motifs, it was initially thought that TLR9 would be critical for DNA vaccine immunogenicity. However, while DNA plasmid activates dendritic cells via TLR9, TLR9-deficient mice were able to mount immune responses comparable to wild-type mice (18, 19) . Likewise, DNA immunization of MyD88 and TRIF-deficient mice yields robust immune responses, further suggesting that TLR signaling may be dispensable for DNA vaccine induced immunogenicity (20) .",

            "text": "In recent years, it has become increasingly evident that the double-stranded nature of DNA itself functions as a potent activator of innate immune signals (21) (22) (23) (24) (25) . Cytosolic DNA is a powerful initiator of type I IFN (IFN-\u03b1\u03b2) in both immune and non-immune cells, functioning through a STING/TBK1/IRF3 dependent pathway that is independent of CpG motifs and TLRs. At the same time, it is not clear whether other components of the innate immune system beyond the STING/TBK1/IFN-\u03b1\u03b2 pathway are involved in the immunogenicity of DNA vaccines (20, 21) . This is especially true in the case of inflammasome pathways. Inflammasomes regulate caspase-1 activity, ultimately resulting in cleavage of the pro-inflammatory cytokines pro-IL-1\u03b2 and pro-IL-18 into their active forms. Inflammasome activation also results in pyroptotic cell death; a suicidal form of cell death characterized by the release of damage associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) that further propagates innate immune signaling to surrounding bystander cells (26) . One flavor of inflammasome contains absent in melanoma 2 (Aim2), which is a direct sensor of cytosolic DNA and a member of the PYHIN family (23) . Aim2 contains a DNA binding HIN200 domain, as well as a pyrin domain. While Aim2's role in orchestrating immune responses to both viral and bacterial pathogens is well characterized (27) (28) (29) , the role of Aim2 in DNA vaccination is unknown.",

Gene induction was quantified from wild-type C57BL/6 mice immunized with the pH1HA DNA vaccine. Messenger RNA was isolated and the expression of innate immune genes profiled using the Nanostring nCounter, and changes in gene induction quantified. Notably, Aim2 was induced ~6 fold within 12 hours of immunization when compared to na\u00efve samples. Aim2 is a type I IFN inducible gene suggesting a potent ability of cells at the site of vaccination to recognize cytosolic plasmid vaccines ( Figure 1A ). In accordance with the induction of Aim2, caspase-1 was also highly upregulated. (Figure 1B ). Most striking were the high levels of the inflammatory cytokines IL-1\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 ( Figure 1C,D) . These observations indicate that inflammasome components were present at the site of vaccination. To test if the inflammasome pathway was active at the site of vaccination we utilized a caspase-1 specific FAM/FLICA fluorescent stain to covalently label catalytically active caspase-1. Mature caspase-1 became apparent within 6 hours of immunization and reached a peak at 12 hours (Supplemental Figure 1) . Collectively, these results led us to examine the role of the Aim2 inflammasome pathway in antigen specific immune responses elicited by pH1HA DNA vaccination.",

IL-1\u03b2 production in response to pH1HA DNA vaccine was evaluated in BMDM collected from either Aim2 +/+ or Aim2 \u2212/\u2212 mice ( Figure  2A ). As expected, both the synthetic B-form dsDNA poly(deoxyadenylic-deoxythymidylic) and pH1HA DNA vaccine induced a robust IL-1\u03b2 response in Aim2 +/+ BMDM as measured by ELISA. However, IL-1\u03b2 production was abolished in Aim2 \u2212/\u2212 BMDM. Similar results were seen in BMDC (data not shown). Next, the pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK was included in BMDM cultures prior to adding pH1HA DNA vaccine ( Figure 2B ). This resulted in inhibited IL-1\u03b2 production in Aim2 +/+ macrophages, yielding IL-1\u03b2 levels comparable to Aim2 \u2212/\u2212 wells, supporting the role of Aim2 in DNA vaccine mediated IL-1\u03b2 maturation. Finally, pH1HA DNA vaccine induced an inflammatory form of cell death (pyroptosis) in Aim2 +/+ macrophages, as measured by lactate dehydrogenase release ( Figure  2C ). This response was attenuated in Aim2 \u2212/\u2212 cells. Collectively, these data indicate that Aim2 acts as a sensor of DNA vaccine plasmid and regulates caspase-1 dependent IL-1\u03b2 production and pyroptotic cell death in response to pH1HA DNA vaccines in vitro.",

The pH1HA DNA vaccine induced high-level HA-specific antibody responses in Aim2 +/+ mice, but significantly lower antibody titers in Aim2 \u2212/\u2212 mice ( Figure 3A ). This reduction is isotype-dependent as Aim2 \u2212/\u2212 mice exhibited significantly lower levels of HA-specific IgG1, IgG2b, and IgG2c responses (data not shown). Likewise, Aim2 \u2212/\u2212 mice exhibited significantly reduced HA-specific circulating B cells as well as IFN-\u03b3 secreting CD8 + T cells in the spleen ( Figure 3C,D) . The role of Aim2 in regulating the maturation process of pH1HA-induced antibody responses was further confirmed by measuring the avidity of serum HA-specific antibodies in these mice ( Figure 3B ). Aim2 +/+ mice required high concentrations of the chaotropic agent NaSCN to disrupt antigen/antibody complexes, while much lower concentrations of NaSCN were required for disassociation in Aim2 \u2212/\u2212 mice. To confirm the requirement for inflammasome signaling in DNA vaccine immunogenicity, we also quantified the adaptive response in Asc \u2212/\u2212 mice. Asc-deletion similarly inhibited the generation of optimal HAspecific immune responses (Supplemental Figure 2A-C) .",

Aim2 +/+ and Aim2 \u2212/\u2212 mice reconstituted with Aim2 \u2212/\u2212 bone marrow exhibited strong defects in both the T cell response and HA-specific IgG production.

While HA-specific IgG levels were impaired compared to Aim2 +/+ mice reconstituted with Aim2 +/+ bone marrow, they were significantly higher than Aim2 \u2212/\u2212 bone marrow reconstituted mice.

While the major function of the Aim2 inflammasome is to regulate caspase-1 activation, resulting in IL-1\u03b2, IL-18 and cell death pathways, our data indicate that IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18 are not responsible for the Aim2 dependent effects we observed. We therefore endeavored to quantify IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 as it has been reported to play a key role in the immune response to B-DNA (25, (35) (36) (37) . In addition, it has been established that IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 signaling is required for DNA vaccination (20, 21) . Aim2 does not control DNA induced IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 production directly. Rather the STING pathway mediates these effects. Since the IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 response is so critical for DNA vaccination, we performed a detailed kinetic analysis measuring IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 expression in Aim2 +/+ and Aim2 \u2212/\u2212 mice. To ensure we only detect DNA vaccine-induced IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2, we limited our measurements to the site of immunization. Aim2 +/+ and Aim2 \u2212/\u2212 mice were immunized with the pH1HA DNA vaccine, and punch biopsies were collected from the site of injection. Quantitative rt-PCR analysis of mRNA clearly shows that Aim2 \u2212/\u2212 mice have reduced IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2 expression compared to Aim2 +/+ controls, with expression peaking at 12 hours post immunization in wild-type mice ( Figure 6 ). Intriguingly, IFN-\u03b1\u03b2 expression in Aim2 \u2212/\u2212 mice peaked at 6 hours post immunization and remained static throughout the time course. Consistent with the decrease in IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2, there was a corresponding decrease in the IFN stimulated gene, IP10. We also noticed a significant decrease in TNF. Asc \u2212/\u2212 mice had similar levels of IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2, further confirming the requirement for inflammasome signaling (Supplemental Figure 2D) . These data suggest a previously unreported role for Aim2 in regulating local IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 levels following DNA vaccination. As Aim2 controls cell death at the site of infection, it is likely that Aim2 dependent cell death liberates endogenous DAMP danger signals, which might in turn elicit IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 via the Aim2-independent STING/TBK1 pathways. This broad defect in IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 signaling likely explains the defects we observed in Aim2-deficient mice treated with DNA vaccines.",

Likewise, the involvement of other innate immune signaling pathways is unclear.

Aim2 is required in both cell lineages for optimal humoral responses, as chimeric mice lacked high levels of anti-HA antibodies. This may be attributed to impaired IL-6 production in Aim2 \u2212/\u2212 mice possibly limiting B-cell survival and CD4 + T cell expansion as has been reported in several studies (Supplemental Figure 4) (38) . In addition, recent reports have described the effect of DNA priming on T follicular helper cell generation (13) .

Why IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18 signaling are dispensable remains unclear, but one possible reason is the highly immunostimulatory nature of the DNA vaccine plasmid itself, as DNA is a potent inducer of both IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 and several NF\u03baB regulated immune genes.
