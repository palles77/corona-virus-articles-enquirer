            "text": "Since the discovery of HIV-1 in the early 1980s, an effective HIV-1 vaccine that can elicit bnAbs has yet to be developed. Extensive studies on HIV-1 have revealed various mechanisms for viral escape from human immune surveillance, including genetic alterations, oligomerization of envelope (Env) glycoproteins, We and others have demonstrated that known HIV-1 bnmAbs had uncommon properties compared with bnmAbs against other microbes, including extensive somatic maturation and lack of measurable binding activity of their putative germline antibodies to Envs [13, 15, 16, 18, 27, 28] , suggesting that HIV-1 infection or vaccination with HIV-1 Envs may not initiate the somatic maturation processes of the putative germline Abs to bnAbs. Deep sequencing of the cDNA-PCR products of memory B cells obtained from several 'elite controllers' at different time points postinfection further revealed the limited use of heavy chain V-gene (IGHV) lineages for developing HIV-1 bnAbs in a single infected individual [17, 18, 29] . The infrequency of developing bnAbs in natural infection, the uncommon properties of known HIV-1 bnmAbs, the confined usage of IGHV lineages for developing bnAbs in a single infected individual and the failure in inducing the same or similar bnmAbs by vaccine immunogens prompted us to investigate the human antibody gene repertoire for the availability of the putative germline antibody genes of known HIV-1 bnmAbs at both genomic DNA (gDNA) and cDNA levels and the possibility for existence of alternative germline antibody genes that may potentially mature to HIV-1 bnAbs. The gDNAs of peripheral B cells in uninfected human individuals presumably possess the initial rearranged antibody gene repertoire for affinity maturation upon infection or vaccination. We hypothesized that antibody gene repertoire at the gDNA level may be more diverse than that at the cDNA level. Therefore, we developed a methodology for constructing large combinatorial gDNA antibody libraries and constructed one large nonimmune gDNA library using the PMBCs obtained from 300 uninfected healthy humans and three immune gDNA libraries using the PBMCs obtained from three HIV-1-infected 'elite controllers'. Their corresponding cDNA libraries were simultaneously constructed. We compared the antibody gene repertoires of the four gDNA antibody libraries with those of the corresponding cDNA libraries by deep sequencing. Sequence analysis results suggest that the frequencies of the putative germline antibody genes of known HIV-1 bnmAbs were extremely low, but alternative germline antibody genes may be explored to elicit HIV-1 bnAbs.",

Pt1 was infected with clade B virus whose serum exhibited high titres of broadly neutralizing activity, and a panel of bnmAbs were isolated from pt1 PBMCs by single memory B-cell sorting using gp120 C-C core protein as a bait (pt1 in [18, 28] ). Pt2 and pt3 were infected with clade B' virus and naive to antiretroviral therapy [30] . The sera of pt2 and pt3 also exhibited cross-clade neutralization activity (data not shown).

Each first round of PCR was carried out in a reaction volume of 100 ml containing 90 ng gDNA as a template by running the following PCR programme: initial denaturing at 958C for 3 min, 10 cycles of 958C for 15 s, 458C for 30 s, 728C for 45 s, 20 cycles of 958C for 15 s, 558C for 30 s, 728C for 45 s and an extension cycle of 728C for 10 min.

Both nonimmune and immune cDNA antibody libraries heavily used IGKV3 and IGLV1 lineages (Figs 1 and 3) . These results indicate that HIV-1 infection shapes the patterns of various IGHV lineage usages, but the caused changes at the cDNA level are much less significant compared with the changes at the gDNA level. The differences between the gDNA and cDNA antibody gene repertoires in HIV-1 uninfected (nonimmune) humans reflect host immune regulations, and such regulations may largely determine the host-dependent immune response to HIV-1 infection.",

To our surprise, we found that the frequencies of the heavy chain variable regions with identical putative VDJ recombinations to these known HIV-1 bnmAbs in both nonimmune and immune gDNA and cDNA libraries were extremely low (Table 1) . We did not find any heavy chain variable regions that had identical VDJ recombinations compared with the known bnmAbs in the nonimmune and three immune gDNA libraries (Table 1) . We found a total of five, 10 and two productive heavy chain variable regions (with in-frame junctions) in the cDNA libraries with exactly the same putative VDJ recombinations as VRC01, VRC03 and NIH45-46, respectively (Table 1) . However, their junction regions and the length of the HCDR3s were very different compared with the respective bnmAbs (data not shown), suggesting the unlikelihood for them to mature to VRC01-like bnAbs. We did a similar search for heavy chain variable regions that had identical VDJ recombinations to a nonneutralizing or weakly neutralizing CD4-induced (CD4i) mAb X5 and a bnmAb against SARS-CoV, m396 [31, 32] . We found four productive heavy chain variable regions in two immune gDNA libraries (1 in pt2gH and 3 in pt3gH) and a total of 28 productive heavy chain variable regions in the cDNA libraries (12 in NIH, 2 in pt2H and 14 in pt3H) that had identical putative VDJ recombinations to X5, but all these heavy chain variable regions had a shorter HCDR3 than that of X5 (24 amino acids, AA).

If a certain combination of putative germline heavy and light chains is required for HIV-1 bnAbs, the frequency of such germline antibody genes may be even lower. Compared with the lack of measurable binding of putative germline antibodies of known HIV-1 bnmAbs to Env and the requirement of extensive somatic maturation for broadly neutralizing activity [13, 27] , limited availability of B-cells bearing proper germline antibody genes that may mature to HIV-1 bnAbs upon stimulation may be a formidable challenge for developing an effective HIV-1 vaccine. The extremely low frequency of the putative germline antibody genes of known HIV-1 bnmAbs in the human antibody gene repertoires suggests that the approach for eliciting HIV-1 bnAbs by identifying primary immunogens to trigger the putative germline antibodies of known HIV-1 bnmAbs in vivo may have a very limited chance of success. However, our further sequence analyses revealed relatively high frequencies of the heavy chain variable regions and kappa/lambda light chain variable regions in the human antibody gene repertoires that use the same or very similar IGHVs and IGKVs/IGLVs and have the same CDR3 length as known HIV-1 bnmAbs regardless of (D)J-gene usage. B-cells harbouring such heavy chain variable regions and kappa/lambda light chain variable regions may be stimulated to induce bnAbs. Note that we used the plasmids from the cDNA Fab libraries and the gDNA scFv libraries as templates for PCR amplification of the heavy chain variable regions and kappa/lambda light chain variable regions for deep sequencing. The cDNA Fab libraries were constructed earlier and used in our previous studies. We did not convert the Fab libraries to scFv libraries because it was not necessary to do so. Conversion between two different formats of antibody libraries may cause loss of antibody diversity and result in bias to certain antibody gene families.",

As we hypothesized, the gDNA antibody gene repertoires showed more diverse usages of IGHV lineages than the cDNA repertoires. Indeed, we have isolated a panel of RSC3-specific antibodies from our combinatorial gDNA libraries, but not from the cDNA libraries (manuscript in preparation). The isolated RSC3-specific antibodies had no or very low levels of somatic maturation and used diverse V(D)J recombinations, but they competed with mature b12 and VRC01 for binding to engineered Env, RSC3 [13] , suggesting their potential to mature to VRC01-like bnAbs. We are currently doing in-vitro maturation and selection to confirm that they can potentially mature to VRC01-like bnAbs.",

The unequal usage of IGHV, IGHD and IGHJ genes in the nonimmune gDNA library suggests that VDJ recombination may not be a random event. The differences may be amplified by host immune regulations to remove or functionally silence B-cells expressing autoimmune antibodies or to deplete the B-cells that recognize B-cell superantigens [33] [34] [35] . This could lead to a different frequency of various germline antibody genes in the initial antibody gene repertoire for affinity maturation. For example, the heavy chain variable regions using IGHV1-2 or with HCDR3s of long length (20 amino acids and over) were significantly less frequent than the heavy chain variable regions using IGHV1-46 or with HCDR3s of medium length (10-15 amino acids) ( Fig. 2 and data not shown). Arnaout et al. [36] also showed that V, D and J segments were utilized with different frequencies, resulting in a highly skewed representation of VDJ combinations in the human antibody gene repertoire. However, they found that the pattern of segment usage was almost identical between two different individuals. Our result seems different from their finding. We found that IGHV lineage usage differs from individual to individual. In addition, they reported that IGHV1-2 lineage accounted for 2-3% sequence in nonimmune human antibody gene repertoire [36] . We found a similar percentage in our cDNA libraries, but the percentages of",

Immature B-cells exit the bone marrow and enter the peripheral system in which new emigrant B cells differentiate into immature and then mature naive B-cells. Mature B-cells undergo somatic maturation upon immunogen stimulation and differentiate into Ab-secreting plasma cells or memory B-cells. Thus, the peripheral blood contains a population of B-cells that have undergone V(D)J recombinations, and the gDNAs of peripheral B-cells of nonimmune humans possess the basal rearranged antibody gene repertoire for antibody affinity maturation. The genome-based antibody gene repertoire may differ from the cDNA-based antibody gene repertoire owing to the different transcriptional and/or translational levels of different antibody genes, and both repertoires may be shaped upon viral infection or vaccination. Therefore, we constructed a large combinatorial nonimmune and three immune human gDNA antibody libraries and their corresponding cDNA antibody libraries for comparison of antibody gene repertoires at the gDNA and cDNA levels by deep sequencing and for subsequent isolation of Env-specific germline or intermediate antibodies (with a low level of somatic maturation) by phage display.",
