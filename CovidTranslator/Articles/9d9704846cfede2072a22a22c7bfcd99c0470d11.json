In the reimbursement process in the ROK, a healthcare organization must send their bills for healthcare treatment to the HIRA to get reimbursement from the National Health Insurance Corporation (NHIC).

Although HIRA collected all the health insurance claims in the ROK, the increase was not noticed by the HIRA until several months later. The HIRA realized that there was a dramatic increase in UI surgery through several field inspections of the medical providers [4] . The reason behind it was that there was discrepancy between payment from private health insurance companies and the new coverage expansion of the National Health Insurance (NHI) program as the NHI program was much less than the payment made by private health insurance companies. Many people who had private insurance policies that covered UI received medical care that included UI surgery. This episode enabled the HIRA to realize the necessity of a monitoring system for healthcare utilization of people for systematic maintenance of the NHI system in the ROK.",

The DBMS of the HUMS is operated on an HP-UX operating system, and the other servers use Window NT and Window 7. One features of the HUMS is that it has an independently operated SAS server. The HUMS has servers for data mining to detect abnormal signs of healthcare utilization and to produce utilization predictions. Data produced through this process are stored at the DBMS server. The HUMS has been redesigned since 2013. Raw data loading and data loading for data mining take two days and at least five days, respectively.",

The system does not provide English version. Language format in the Figure 3 was graphically modified from Korean to English for the convenience of the readers. The HUMS monitors healthcare utilization and the volume of healthcare costs by diseases (ICD-10), types of services (e.g., diagnosis, lab test, long-term care, etc.), types of drugs, medical supply materials in order to detect abnormal signs of healthcare utilization. These data are produced through data mining process. The five types of the data mining models are applied in order to detect whether there is any abnormal signs of health care utilization. In addition, the HUMS uses a filtering process in order to produce two indices which are the percentage increase oscillator (PIO) and the relative strength index (RSI) values showing items that are out of specific data ranges.",

This section provides useful information for the directors and the managers of the HIRA to make decisions on the health insurance claims reviews and the overall health insurance budgets. The second section shows information on the total amount of healthcare costs and the proportion of healthcare costs assumed by the insurer (NHIC). This section helps decision-makers to figure out whether there are enough funds available compared to the total budget. The third section shows the cumulative amount of healthcare costs and its proportion by healthcare facility and ser- vices (inpatient/outpatient) types.

One limitation of this investigation was that we only observed the system, and we simply introduced the functionality of the HUMS. There was no testing of the system capacity of operation, measurement of the uploading results requested by users, or a time-motion study.

First, it is necessary for the HIRA to develop a healthcare utilization monitoring system for the national level. This system should have real-time functionality. The current system is based on the review of health insurance claims data, so there is some lag-time between the actual provision of healthcare and the results being available for monitoring by the HUMS. Therefore, a new system should be structured like the HIRA's drug utilization review (DUR) system, which provides possibilities of contraindication of drugs for drug-drug interaction, drug-age interaction, etc. Whenever medical doctors and pharmacists want to check whether there is any possibility of contraindication when they prescribe or dispense drugs to patients, they can obtain confirmation through the HIRA's DUR system by connecting the system. This can be used in a real-time manner. When medical doctors complete their treatment for patients, some important information, such as the patients' identification and disease codes should be able to be transferred to HIRA's new data system specializing in healthcare utilization monitoring. Through such a system, the HIRA would be able to monitor healthcare utilization at the national level. This kind of system could certainly help the government make timely decisions to stop contagion outbreaks, such as the recent spread of MERS, and prevent secondary infections.",
