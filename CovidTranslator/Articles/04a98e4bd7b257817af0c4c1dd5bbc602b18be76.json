We know that adenoid tissue grows mainly between 3 and 5 years of age. Adenoid hyperplasia under 24 months of age is uncommon, and this fact is not yet very well studied. For this reason, we have divided our patients into two groups; one with patients between 12 and 24 months and the other, with patients older than 25 months. We found 34.3% of adenoid tissue with EBV-positive cells in the first group. Would this hyperplasia be the one called ''idiopathic benign hyperplasia,'' due in part to the proliferative action of EBV?",

Some authors have demonstrated that EBV is equally distributed in the Waldeyer's ring; however, this is not in agreement with our findings. Considering the intensity of positiveness, there were no significant differences. EBV was found in the tonsillar parenchyma and in the parafollicular region, or inside the germinal center. It was also found in the adenoid epithelium, though rarely.",
