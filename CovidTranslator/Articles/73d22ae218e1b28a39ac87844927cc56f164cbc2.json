The RNA as a molecular chaperone (chaperna) activity is intrinsic to some ribozymes and is operational during viral infections. Our purpose was to test whether influenza hemagglutinin (HA) can be assembled in a soluble, trimeric, and immunologically activating conformation by means of an RNA molecular chaperone (chaperna) activity. An RNA-interacting domain (RID) from the host being immunized was selected as a docking tag for RNA binding, which served as a transducer for the chaperna function for de novo folding and trimeric assembly of RID-HA1. Mutations that affect tRNA binding greatly increased the soluble aggregation defective in trimer assembly, suggesting that RNA interaction critically controls the kinetic network in the folding/assembly pathway. Immunization of mice resulted in strong hemagglutination inhibition and high titers of a neutralizing antibody, providing sterile protection against a lethal challenge and confirming the immunologically relevant HA conformation. The results may be translated into a rapid response to a new influenza pandemic. The harnessing of the novel chaperna described herein with immunologically tailored antigen-folding functions should serve as a robust prophylactic and diagnostic tool for viral infections.-Yang, S.",

            "text": "Molecular chaperones are involved both in the facilitation of protein folding and prevention of protein aggregation, which would otherwise lead to cytotoxic consequences (1, 2) . Conventionally, these pivotal functions have been considered unique properties of chaperones and chaperonins, which are proteins themselves (3) . Nonetheless, recent reports suggest that RNA molecules can also function as chaperones and are extremely effective in executing the folding of a variety of proteins both in vivo and in vitro (4, 5) . The potential role of RNAs in modulating aggregation and amyloid formation has been reported for the p53 tumor suppressor (6) . Moreover, chaperone activity has been discovered as intrinsic to some ribozymes, which are RNA molecules that function as catalysts: both in the M1 RNA ribozyme that is responsible for the maturation of tRNAs and in the large rRNAs that function as peptidyl transferase during ribosome-dependent protein synthesis (7) (8) (9) . Being distinct from the RNA chaperone, which is a protein that facilitates structural alteration of RNA molecules, the term for RNA as a molecular chaperone (chaperna) refers to an RNA molecule that serves as a chaperone for the folding of client proteins (10) . Nevertheless, neither the extent of its involvement in the folding and homeostasis of normal cellular proteins nor its efficacy in the folding of difficult-to-express proteins has been explored. It is noteworthy that the proper use of molecular chaperones for the in vivo folding of recombinant proteins in Escherichia coli has been reported only in isolated cases, and no study of considerable size that has shown broad efficacy has been conducted (11) . Therefore, the possibility that the moonlighting activity of RNAs as chaperones beyond the known canonical cellular functions could be used as an efficient vehicle for the folding and assembly of proteins requires dedicated exploration.",

In the present study, we show that a chaperna is remarkably effective in the folding and trimeric assembly of influenza hemagglutinin (HA) into an immunologically activating conformation. A convenient avenue for harnessing the chaperone function is to fuse genetically the target protein of interest with an RNA-interacting domain (RID) as a docking tag that enables interaction with cellular RNAs (14) . A judicious choice of the RID is required for a biomolecule to function as a chaperone without physically interfering with the oligomeric structure of the target antigen. Therefore, the RID should preferably be small and sufficiently flexible not to interfere with the multimeric assembly of the target antigen, and moreover, it should be intrinsically nonimmunogenic (15) . In this study, a small tRNA-binding domain of lysyl-tRNA synthetase (LysRS; aa positions 1-70), which was derived from the host being immunized, was selected as the transducer for the chaperna function of cellular RNAs. The N-terminal domain is intrinsically disordered but can switch from an unfolded structure into an a-helical conformation in vitro after tRNA binding (16, 17) . This domain has been shown to interact in vitro with nonspecific tRNAs (18) .",

LysRS of eukaryotic origin carries an extra N-terminal domain (RID) that is absent in the E. coli counterpart (Fig. 1B) .

As a control, direct expression of GFP or bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2) without fusion to an RID yielded predominantly a precipitate of insoluble aggregates under all of the temperature conditions tested (Fig. 2D ). Initial screening of LysRS proteins for solubility revealed that the eLysRS had superb solubility compared with the counterparts of mouse or rabbit origin ( Fig. 2A) . Parallel analyses showed that the RIDs of all 3 species are produced predominantly in the soluble form (.95% for hRID and mRID and ;80% for rRID, respectively; Fig. 2B ). Of note, the RID equivalent is absent in E. coli LysRS (Fig. 1B) and therefore, could not be tested. Thus, the RIDs of human and animal origins were further explored as a docking tag for potential soluble expression of target proteins: BMP2, GFP, and HAgD (Fig. 2D, E) . As shown in Fig. 2E , unlike the HAgD without RID, HAgDs as a fusion to an RID of varied origin were expressed as soluble proteins with a good yield (20-40% of total protein). The solubility of all of the recombinant proteins was greatly enhanced (by ;5-40%) compared with direct expression without fusion (Fig. 2D, E) . Overall, the expression of fusion partners of mouse origin (mRID, mLysN, mLysRS) was higher than the expression of fusion partners of rabbit origin, but their solubility levels were similar ( Fig. 2A , C, E, F). Despite minor differences, each RID fusion showed a strongly increased total soluble yield of the respective proteins. Because there were no significant differences between LysN and an RID in promotion of the solubility of a reporter protein, RIDs were chosen as a fusion tag for the rest of the experiments: an RID of small size (;8 kDa) is not expected to interfere physically with trimeric assembly of HAgD and as a docking tag, is less immunogenic than LysN (;28 kDa) or LysRS (;57.6 kDa; Fig. 2A-C) . Thus, mRID-HAgD and rRID-HAgD were chosen as immunogens for inoculation of mice or rabbits, respectively. In parallel, eGFP was used as a reporter for solubility as a fusion to RID, where its solubility ratio was ;50% at 25\u00b0C (Fig. 2G ).",

Based on the elution volume and partition coefficient (K av ), the MW of mRID-HAgD was estimated to be 140.54 kDa. Likewise, rRID-HAgD showed an elution volume of 17.60 ml and the estimated size of 143.87 kDa (Fig. 3A) . Of note, most of the protein was eluted as a single peak, without any peaks in void volume, suggesting that the protein is predominantly in a defined conformation without any insoluble aggregates of ill-defined conformations. According to the elution pattern, the RID-fused HAgD proteins were predominantly in the trimeric state, resembling the assembly status of the whole HA protein in an influenza virus. The estimated size of trimeric RID-HAgD (140-144 kDa) is slightly bigger than the calculated value (40 kDa 3 3 = 120 kDa). The flexible nature of the fusion junction and the elongated nature of the RID are expected to cause slight overestimation of the overall size of a fusion protein (17, 18) (Fig. 1E) . SDS-PAGE analysis also confirmed that the bulk of RID-HAgD proteins was present in the trimer fraction. Apparently, the bound tRNAs dissociated and failed to be copurified with the HA proteins during the purification process, probably owing to relatively low affinity for RID (31) . Serving as a control, mRID-eGFP was eluted at elution volumes 12.80 and 22.50 ml, indicating a mixture of oligomeric (;30%) and monomeric (;70%) conformations, with the estimated size of the monomer 34.2 kDa, close to calculated 37.8 kDa (Fig. 3A) . eLysRS-HAgD (85.8 kDa) was eluted as a mixture of oligomeric (60%) and dimeric (40%; estimated as 181.97 kDa) conformations (Fig. 3B ). According to the elution pattern, Figure 3 . Determination of the oligomeric status of fusion antigens by gel-filtration chromatography and a fetuin-binding assay. A) mRID-HAgD and rRID-HAgD were eluted in trimeric form on the basis of K av , followed by analysis of RID-HAgD by SDS-PAGE. mRID-eGFP, as a control, was eluted as a mixture of oligomeric (30%) and monomeric (70%; estimated at 34.2 kDa) forms. B) LysRS-HAgD, as a control, was eluted as a mixture of oligomeric (60%) and dimeric (40%; estimated as 182 kDa) forms. C ) The refolded HAgD without RID was eluted predominantly in monomeric form (80%; estimated at 25.6 kDa). D) The glycoprotein (fetuin), which contains terminal sialic acid residues as a receptor for HA, was adsorbed to a microplate and analyzed for binding to mRID-HAgD, HAgD without RID, and eLysRS-HAgD. The mRID-eGFP protein served as a negative control. All of the data were obtained in duplicate. eLysRS-HAgD protein was a mixture of oligomers and the dimer in solution. The HAgD without RID, refolded from inclusion bodies (25.4 kDa), was eluted mainly as a monomeric conformation (Fig. 3C) . The results showed the efficacy of the RID in promoting the folding and assembly of its reporter HA protein into the native trimeric conformation.",

Trimeric HA glycoproteins are responsible for binding of the influenza virus to sialic acid on the host cell membrane for initiation of the infection cycle. Fetuin is a glycoprotein that contains sialic acid and can be used in a convenient assay for evaluation of binding of a functional trimeric assembly of an HA protein (32) . In this assay, the quality of HA folding could be assessed regarding receptor binding at the initial stage of viral infection. Our results showed that the E. coli-derived recombinant HA, which is not glycosylated, binds to fetuin (Fig. 3D) , suggesting that glycosylation is not important for the folding of HA (33) . Of note, the mRID-HAgD trimer manifested stronger binding than did monomeric HAgD (without RID) obtained by refolding (Fig.  3D ). eLysRS-HAgD, which is predominantly in a dimeric form, failed to bind, as was the case for mRID-eGFP, which was thus selected for negative controls (Fig. 3D) . Consistent with other reports (34), the receptor-binding activity of mRID-HAgD reflects its proper folding and assembly into the biologically relevant trimer conformation.",

After immunization with an RID-HAgD or RID-eGFP fusion protein, antiserum was obtained, and an ELISA was performed to estimate the amount of a specific antibody against the docking tag and the reporter proteins, respectively (Fig. 5A-F) . ELISA data confirmed that immunization elicited robust antibody responses against target reporter antigen HAgD or eGFP but much less toward the RID docking tag. First, irrespective of the reporter protein, the ELISA signal was much stronger against fusion proteins than against the RID itself (for rRID, Fig. 5A , B for eGFP and HAgD, respectively; for mRID, Fig. 5C , E for the respective proteins). Second, for the same reporter antigen, the ELISA signal was much stronger for the reporter antigen regardless of the source of the docking protein (compare Fig. 5E with 5F for the HAgD and Fig. 5C with 5D for eGFP). Third, the same conclusions were drawn, regardless of the animal species to be immunized (compare Fig. 5A with 5B for rabbits and Fig. 5C -F for mice). It should be noted that specificity of the antibody response to a reporter protein relative to the RID docking protein was not appreciably different regardless of the origin of an RID and the animal species to be immunized (compare Fig.  5A with 5D for eGFP and Fig. 5B with 5F for the HAgD), probably as a result of high homology (;80%) in an amino acid sequence between the murine and rabbit counterparts. In contrast, data from the ELISA involving eLysRS-HAgD as an immunogen showed a similar magnitude of the responses to fusion proteins eLysRS and eLysRS-HAgD, suggesting that the immune response was directed predominantly against the eLysRS docking tag with a negligible response to the desired HAgD region (Fig. 5G) . High immunogenicity of eLysRS may be because of low sequence homology of LysRS between the mouse and E. coli (;36%). In addition, WB analysis was carried out to examine the binding specificity of the antibodies produced against recombinant proteins. After treatment with the TEV protease, the 6xHis tag and the peptides corresponding to the MCS were expected to be removed from an RID and RID-HAgD (Fig. 1D) . Accordingly, the antibody against RID-HAgD bound specifically to the HAgD (cleaved) and RID-HAgD (remained uncleaved) but not to the RID docking tag alone (cleaved; Fig. 5A -F and Supplemental Fig.  2A-D) .",

The RID fusion tags, RID-eGFP and RID-HAgD, were digested with TEV, resulting in cleavage products of the expected Fig. 2A ). For convenience, protein fragments, with or without the His tag + MCS peptide moiety, are indicated with black and white arrows, respectively. rRID was detected by rabbit antiserum raised against rRID fusion proteins but failed to be detected after TEV treatment (Supplemental Fig. 2B ). These results suggested that the positive detection, albeit a weak one, by WB was a result of the immune response to the His tag + MCS moiety, rather than to the self-rRID docking tag. To determine whether anti-histidine (His) tag antibodies raised against 1 protein could bind to the His tag attached to another (irrelevant) protein, we performed an additional WB analysis. Serum samples from rRID-HAgDimmunized rabbits showed an immunoreaction with the eGFP protein, and conversely, serum samples from mRID-eGFP-immunized mice showed an immunoreaction with the HAgD protein (Supplemental Fig. 2E ). Given that only the His tag was a common region between rRID-HAgD Figure 5 . Analysis of differences in antibody production levels by an ELISA and WB. A) The difference in antibody levels (according to an ELISA) between groups rRID and rRID-eGFP relative to the serum samples from rabbits (n = 2) immunized with rRID-eGFP; (lower) WB analysis for the detection of antibodies in the rabbit serum samples. B) Differences in antibody levels between groups rRID and rRID-HAgD relative to the serum samples from rabbits (n = 2) immunized with rRID-HAgD; (lower) WB analysis for the detection of antibodies in the rabbit serum samples. C-F ) Differences in antibody levels between groups RID and RID-fused protein relative to the serum samples from mice (n = 3) immunized with an RID-fused immunogen; (lower) WB analysis for the detection of antibodies in the mouse serum samples. G) Differences in antibody levels between groups eLysRS and eLysRS-HAgD relative to the serum samples from mice (n = 5) immunized with eLysRS-HAgD. Error bars indicate the SD of each cohort.

The initial serum dilution value was 1/200 and 1/3200 for mice and rabbits, respectively. and eGFP and between mRID-eGFP and HAgD, it is likely that the bands indicated by black arrows represent a specific interaction between the anti-His tag antibody and the His tag. Likewise, in rRID-eGFP or rRID-HAgD, the predominant response was directed against the eGFP or HAgD reporter proteins, rather than rRID. Likewise, mRID was weakly reactive with the murine antiserum against mRID-eGFP (Supplemental Fig. 2C ), but the reactivity disappeared after TEV cleavage (white arrow), suggesting that the self-mRID was not immunogenic in mice. The lack of crossreactivity between mouse antiserum and rRID of rabbit origin was probably a result of high homology of RIDs between the 2 host species (Supplemental Fig. 2C, D) . Therefore, the weak but distinct ELISA response to the RID docking tag (Fig. 5) is not actually a result of immunogenicity of the RID but of the peptides artificially introduced for affinity purification and cloning purposes. This finding indicates that the RID docking tag itself is nonimmunogenic, and the immune response was aimed predominantly at the desired viral antigen after immunization. The WB analyses, along with the ELISA, confirmed that RID can serve as an excellent enhancer of folding and assembly of a target antigen without compromising the specific immune responses.",

Four weeks later, blood was drawn from each mouse via transorbital collection, and serum was prepared. All of the mice survived with a maximal weight loss of 23% by 7 d postchallenge (dpc) and recovered slowly. Furthermore, 2 wk later, blood was collected from the recovered mice, and the resulting serum was subjected to ELISA and WB analyses (Fig. 6A, B and Supplemental Fig. 3A) . The results confirmed that RID-HAgD (trimeric form; Fig. 3A ), as a coating antigen, was detected by highly diluted antisera from infected mice (n = 5), whereas the refolded HAgD without RID (monomeric form; Fig. 3C ) was detected at a much lower dilution of the antisera (;50-fold lower) than RID-HAgD was.

Detection of anti-influenza virus antibodies in mouse serum samples by means of the recombinant viral proteins and the PR8 (H1N1) virus. A, B) ELISA and WB data revealed that the recombinant proteins, RID-HAgD, were detected by highly diluted antibodies against the PR8 (H1N1) virus in serum samples from infected mice (n = 5), whereas the refolded HAgD without RID as a coating protein (compared with RID-HAgD) was detected only at much lower dilution (50-fold or ;2 6 -fold lower) of the antisera, and the RID docking tag failed to show any immunoreactivity. C ) ELISA data for detection of antibodies in serum samples from mice infected with various viruses (n = 3). As a coating antigen, the recombinant mRID-HAgD protein and coldadapted X-31-based genetic reassortants (carrying 6 internal genes from cold-adapted X-31 virus and the surface HA and neuraminidase genes from WT viruses) were used as the source of the HA antigen.

D) ELISA data showing that according to the number of boosts, high-titer antibodies in serum samples from mice (n = 5) immunized with mRID-HAgD (20 mg/mouse) bound to the PR8 (H1N1) virus (10 4 PFU/well).

Error bars indicate the SD of each group. The x-axis indicates reciprocal serum dilution (log 2 ). The initial serum dilution was 1/50. immunoreactivity (Fig. 6A, B) . WB then confirmed that the antibody response was directed against HAgD, whereas RID, either before or after TEV cleavage, failed to react with the antiserum (Supplemental Fig. 3A) . These results indicated that recombinant RID-HAgD may serve as a diagnostic antigen with high specificity and sensitivity for influenza infection. In addition, we compared ELISA reactivity among various antisera from mice infected with different subtypes of influenza strains. As expected, the highest reactivity was seen with the homologous PR8 (H1N1) antiserum (Fig. 6C) . Potential crossreactivity with different HA antigens was examined using cold-adapted X-31-based reassortant strains carrying 6 internal genes from the cold-adapted X-31 virus and the genes encoding surface proteins HA and neuraminidase from WT viruses (35, 36) . Lower reactivity was observed with heterologous virus New Caledonia (NC; H1N1) or heterosubtypes, including Panama (PA; H3N2), Indonesia (ID; H5N1), or Korea (KR; H5N2; Fig. 6C and Supplemental Fig. 3B) . Alternatively, to test whether the antibody elicited by the RID-HAgD vaccine binds to the homologous PR8 (H1N1) virus, we conducted an ELISA with the antisera from mice immunized with mRID-HAgD or HAgD without RID (as a control; n = 5), by means of the PR8 (H1N1) virus as a coating antigen (Fig. 6D, E) . The results confirmed that mRID-HAgD elicited specific antibodies against the homologous virus and that repeated boosts with the fusion protein further amplified the antibody response, suggesting that the quality of the recombinant antigen is immunologically relevant. Despite 3 immunizations, the antisera to the HAgD without RID rarely bound to PR8 (H1N1) viruses, indicating that the HAgD without RID could not induce antibody responses specific to the virus in mice (Fig. 6E) . These results suggested that recombinant RID-HAgD may serve as a good antigen for accurate diagnosis of infection or quantification of vaccine antigens.",

The HI assay against the PR8 (H1N1) virus was carried out by means of antisera collected from the mice (n = 3) immunized with RID-HAgD (4 mg/mouse) or RID-eGFP (as a control, 4 mg/mouse), along with an Alum adjuvant (Thermo Fisher Scientific) via the intraperitoneal route. The mouse antisera against RID-HAgD showed detectable levels of HI titers and NT antibody titers, whereas those from the RID-eGFP group failed to show such an activity (Fig. 7B, C) . The HI activity appeared to be similar, regardless of the origin of the RID docking protein. Therefore, with the use of mRID-HAgD (20 mg/mouse), HAgD without RID (15 mg/mouse), and PBS, detailed analyses of immune responses were conducted after prime-boost immunization (n = 5) via the intraperitoneal route (Fig. 7D, E) . As shown in Fig. 7D , E, boost immunization with mRID-HAgD (20 mg/mouse) augmented the immune responses, and high HI titers (.32) were achieved by the second boost immunization, whereas the NT antibody levels (.10 3 ) correlated with the HI antibody levels. The multiple immunizations with the HAgD without RID did not generate HI or NT antibodies to the PR8 (H1N1) virus (Fig. 7D, E) . Antisera from rabbits (n = 2) immunized with 1 mg of the rRID-HAgD recombinant vaccine (Fig. 7F , G) showed higher HI titers (.64) and higher NT antibody levels (.40) than those shown by mouse antisera (Fig. 7B,  C) . The control rabbit antisera against the RID-eGFP proteins or PBS showed neither the HI ability nor NT titers against the homologous PR8 (H1N1) virus (Fig. 7F, G) . These results clearly showed that the RID-HAgD fusion proteins could be further optimized into effective vaccine antigens that can produce protective NT antibody responses against influenza viruses.",

            "text": "By taking advantage of the chaperna function herein, for the first time, we show that influenza HA can be assembled in a soluble, trimeric, and immunologically activating conformation. The influenza HA antigen could be produced in bacteria as a soluble trimeric structure that can induce the production of NT antibodies for effective protection against a lethal challenge. As revealed during the H1N1 pandemic in 2009, the supply of sufficient doses of vaccines within a short period is a prerequisite for mitigating the economic effect and addressing public health concerns during a pandemic. Previously, all efforts toward the bacterial production of recombinant HA vaccines have been dependent on the chemical refolding of misfolded insoluble aggregates (34, (40) (41) (42) (43) . All of these processes have depended on the initial production of HA as insoluble aggregates and required subsequent chemical refolding procedures, involving solubilization with chaotropic agents, dilution, and concentration before an immunologically relevant conformation was obtained. Therefore, the production of immunologically relevant antigens in mammalian or insect cells in baculovirus vector systems has been favored. Nevertheless, these systems invariably require cell culture methods that are highly expensive and difficult to scale up. The production of HA in a soluble, trimeric conformation should greatly simplify the production process, ensuring the quality of the resultant vaccines and making them amenable to implementation of pandemic preparedness (43) . In the proposed system, an RID serves as a docking tag for transducing the chaperone function of RNA for the folding and assembly of the downstream reporter protein (HA) via interaction with resident cellular tRNAs. From the functional perspective, the coupled action of this chaperone during protein folding and assembly is similar to that of chaperone proteins (44, 45) . Our results also indicate that the RIDs that were derived from various animals can be used as immunologically tailored, antigen-folding vehicles for antigens, which could serve as diagnostic and prophylactic tools for viral infections. In addition to the de novo folding of monomers, the subsequent assembly of monomeric antigens into multimeric-ordered structures is crucially important, especially for augmentation of the immune response and proper presentation of epitopes by immune cells toward protection (12, 13) . Therefore, a judicious choice of an RID is required; while mediating the chaperna function, the docking tag should not physically interfere with the formation of oligomeric structures. In the present study, an N-terminalappended tRNA-interaction domain (18) of a eukaryotic LysRS was chosen as the RID. This domain is small (;70 aa long) and belongs to the family of intrinsically unfolded domains; it is expected to be sufficiently flexible so that it does not physically interfere with the trimer assembly of HA located downstream (46) . Intrinsically, the influenza HAgD proteins were expressed and purified predominantly as trimers (Fig. 3A) . Although the expression levels and solubility of eLysRS-HAgD containing eLysRS as an alternative tRNA-binding domain were substantially higher, the fusion protein existed primarily as a dimer, as confirmed by gel-filtration chromatography under native conditions (Fig. 3B) . Possibly, the stabilization energy of dimerization of the relatively large LysRS (;57.6 kDa) may physically interfere with the trimerization of HAgD (;25.4 kDa) (47) . Therefore, despite high immunogenicity, as demonstrated by an ELISA (Fig. 5G) , immunization failed to provide protection against a lethal challenge (Fig.  8C, D) . However, the HAgD, without an attached RID protein, yielded interesting results when administered to mice. Even without eliciting antibody responses, three immunizations with the HAgD without RID partially protected the mice from the lethal challenge. We assume that this partial protection may be because of the T cellmediated immunity against HA. There are several reports indicating the existence of T cell epitopes in the HA of influenza viruses (48) (49) (50) . It is likely that multiple immunizations with the HAgD without RID induced specific T cell responses, contributing to the protection. The results emphasize the importance of the assembly of antigens in a native conformation for induction of protective NT antibody responses. The process has distinctive advantages over the chemical refolding of insoluble aggregates (42, 43, 51) , which require solubilization with chaotropic agents, dilution, and concentration before adopting an immunologically relevant conformation. The production of the HAgD with a receptor-binding domain in a soluble, trimeric, immunologically activating conformation should ensure the quality of viral antigens and make them amenable to implementation of pandemic preparedness (52) (53) (54) .",

The existing approaches involve fusion of HA with ferritin into nanoparticles or with a foldon that is derived from the natural trimerization domain of isoleucine zippers or T4 fibritin (55) (56) (57) (58) , wherein the major amount of stabilization energy is provided by the external trimerization domain. In the present approach, using a chaperna, the RID remains an independent monomer, and thus, it is not expected to contribute to intermolecular stabilization among HAgDs. Rather, trimer formation is primarily driven by the intrinsic stabilization energy of mutual interactions among HAgDs. Here, an RID, as a small, structurally independent domain, is not expected to interfere with the interactions within HAgD trimers in space, as governed by the thermodynamic stabilization energy in the assembly of trimers.",

It is noteworthy that the unique ability of intrinsically unfolded domains to increase the solubility of target proteins has been reported, although its effect on biologic activities remains unknown (59) . The RID that was used in this study is relatively unfolded, and therefore, the linking of the docking protein with the RID may increase its solubility, in agreement with other reports (14, 59) . Therefore, it is intriguing that the hRIDmu2, hRIDmu6, and hRIDmu9 proteins maintained high solubility (even higher than that of the WT hRID; Fig. 4C) , and yet, the extent of the trimeric assembly of HAgD was greatly lowered (Fig. 4E) . These results confirm that the RNA interaction is indeed crucial for the trimeric assembly of HA. The results also offer a discretionary note on the quality evaluation of recombinant antigens: solubility is necessary but not sufficient to represent a biologically or immunologically relevant conformation.",

Moreover, in contrast to the foldase type of molecular chaperones, which consume ATP for recycling chaperones from docking proteins, a chaperna is expected to function as a chaperone without the ATP requirement, in a way similar to that of the holdase type of chaperones (60) (61) (62) . Here, the affinity of RNA may be a determining factor for the capture and folding of the guest proteins. In addition, the potential effect on the tRNA-induced a-helical structural transition of an RID to folding of the downstream docking protein should be investigated further. Overall, our results show that RNA can affect the kinetic landscape of the folding pathway in favor of the productive folding and assembly of vaccine antigens (37, 63) .",

However, in VLP assemblies, prior cleavage of the RID tag was required to enable the compact packing into VLPs.

Basically, the process involves isolation of spleen cells from an immunized mouse, followed by their fusion with immortalized cells and screening of reactive clones.
