However, little is known about geographic variation in RABV exposure, or if the use of man-made roosts by this species affects enzootic RABV infection dynamics within colonies. We sampled rabies viral neutralizing antibodies in bats at three bridge and three cave roosts at multiple time points during the reproductive season to investigate temporal and roost variation in RABV exposure. We report seropositive bats in all age and sex classes with minimal geographic variation in RABV seroprevalence among Brazilian free-tailed bat colonies in south-central Texas. While roost type was not a significant predictor of RABV seroprevalence, it was significantly associated with seasonal fluctuations, suggesting patterns of exposure that differ between roosts. Temporal patterns suggest increased RABV seroprevalence after parturition in cave colonies, potentially related to an influx of susceptible young, in contrast to more uniform seroprevalence in bridge colonies. This study highlights the importance of life history and roost ecology in understanding patterns of RABV seroprevalence in colonies of the Brazilian free-tailed bat.",

The initial detection of RABV infection in bats prompted multiple surveillance studies, and RABV-infected Brazilian free-tailed bats were detected across their geographic range in the southern United States (Burns and Farinacci 1955 , Burns et al. 1956a , 1956b , Schneider et al. 1957 , Maddy et al. 1958 , Glass 1959 , Dean et al. 1960 , Richardson et al. 1966 . Die-offs of several thousand Brazilian free-tailed bats in New Mexico (1955, 1956) and Texas (1955) prompted additional surveillance of Brazilian free-tailed bat maternity colonies in the southwestern United States, although RABV infection was confirmed in low proportions of moribund bats collected during periods of massive mortality (Constantine et al. 1968 ). Systematic surveillance of apparently healthy adult Brazilian free-tailed bats from maternity colonies in New Mexico has documented variable levels of RABV exposure (12-80%), and low levels of central nervous system infection (<1%) (Constantine et al. 1968, Steece and Altenbach 1989 ), yet few studies have examined the effects of ecological and geographic variation on the dynamics of RABV infection in bats.",

The largest aggregations of these bats often function as maternity colonies, whose diets are supported by the emergence of insect prey from agricultural croplands in south-central Texas (e.g., corn and cotton) during the summer months (Kunz et al. 1995, Lee and McCracken 2005) . This species is known to colonize a variety of roosts, including natural (e.g., caves, trees) and man-made structures (e.g., mines, bridges, bat houses, and buildings). In Texas, large colonies occur in caves (Davis et al. 1962 , McCracken 2003 , Betke et al. 2008 ) and, increasingly, in the expansion joints of highway bridges Tuttle 1999, Keeley and Keeley 2004) , with smaller colonies found in buildings (Davis et al. 1962, Scales and Wilkins 2007) . Bridge colonies are often associated with heavy vehicular or rail traffic, which contributes noise, air, and ground pollution to the local environment. Little is known about how these novel stimuli affect the immune competence and epizootiology of bats living in man-made roosts.",

Periods of sampling correspond with seasonal changes in reproductive activity of adult female bats (e.g., pregnancy, lactation, and postlactation=nonreproductive periods). We predicted that RABV seroprevalence would increase after synchronized parturition, when the overall population size, contact rates, and the proportion of susceptible bats are expected to increase. We expected lower immune competence from bats in bridge roosts because of the perceived stresses associated with anthropogenic disturbances, potentially resulting in fewer bats mounting immune responses to RABV exposure, and lower VNA seroprevalence (Smith 1981 , Smith et al. 1982 . We expected periodic fluctuations in RABV seroprevalence to be greater in adult females, compared to adult males, as reproductive females presumably have greater contact with clusters of susceptible young. As sex ratios are more heavily skewed in favoring females at cave roosts, we expected periodic fluctuations in RABV seroprevalence to be greater in cave roosts. For juveniles, we expected higher RABV seroprevalence during early periods of sampling after parturition, as previous data have suggested high levels of RABV infection during early weeks of life (Constantine 1986, Steece and Altenbach 1989) .",

Free-ranging bats were captured at emergence from all sites between 18:00 and 21:00, using a combination of harp trap and hand nets, and all bats were immediately freed from traps or nets and placed into individual cloth bags (Kunz and Kurta 1988) . Standard measurements were taken on all bats, including mass, right forearm length, age (Anthony 1988) , sex, and reproductive condition (Racey 1988) . A sample (80-100 mL) of whole blood was collected in sterile heparinized microcapillary tubes after aseptic preparation and puncture of the interfemoral artery (Kunz and Nagy 1988) . Plasma was separated within 2 h of blood draw, and stored at \u00c0208C. Bats were observed for clinical signs of RABV infection during processing (i.e., odd vocalizations, ataxia, paresis, and paralysis) . Before release at the site of capture, a nontoxic ink tattoo was applied to all bats to prevent re-sampling of individuals and to assess site fidelity through the sampling season. An index of body condition was calculated by taking the ratio of body mass (g) to length of forearm (mm).",

Mating in this species is thought to occur among colonies in Mexico before the migration of bats into Texas, but has been documented in colonies during March and April (Davis et al. 1962, Keeley and Keeley 2004) . However, none of the male bats that we sampled showed evidence of reproductive activity (i.e., descended testes) during any of the periods sampled. In the Early period, colonies are still assembling as individuals arrive from Mexico at maternity sites that are primarily comprised of adult females in the early to middle stages of gestation. The Mid period immediately follows synchronized parturition, which occurs in early June (Davis et al. 1962 , Constantine 1967a , McCracken and Gustin 1991 . The majority of adult female bats are nursing pups during the Mid period, and milk is easily expressed from nursing females that have visibly swollen nipples that are devoid of hair. Colony sizes peak and are most stable during the Mid period (Davis et al. 1962 , Constantine 1967a , Betke et al. 2008 ). In the Late period, most adult females are in the late stages of lactation and transitioning into a postlactation (nonreproductive) state, as juveniles achieve adult size and begin to forage independently. Postlactational adult females are characterized by the growth of new hair around the nipple and no milk expression after palpation. During the Premigratory phase, all adult bats and young-of-the-year are considered nonreproductive, and are preparing for autumn migration to Mexico (Fig. 2) .",

Contrary to our expectations, roost type alone was not a significant predictor of RABV seroprevalence, but seasonal fluctuations in seroprevalence were affected by roost type. In cave colonies, RABV seroprevalence significantly increased after parturition, whereas RABV seroprevalence at bridge colonies was more uniform across the time periods sampled (Fig. 4) . The increase in RABV seroprevalence after parturition among adult females at cave colonies may be associated with heightened RABV infection in susceptible young (Constantine 1986, Steece and Altenbach 1989) , and an increase in contact rates associated with adult females nursing among clusters of young (McCracken and Gustin 1991) . Although we did not obtain comparative measurements of the densities of bats on roost surfaces in caves and bridges, census data suggest lower colony sizes in bridges when compared to caves (Constantine 1967a , Keeley and Keeley 2004 , Betke et al. 2008 . Sex ratios of adult bats are significantly skewed at cave colonies when compared to bridge or building colonies, with caves having almost exclusively adult female bats before parturition (Davis et al. 1962 , Constantine 1967a , McCracken and Gustin 1991 , Keeley and Keeley 2004 . The proportional number of adult female bats is particularly important in regard to the increase in colony size after parturition; that is, caves support larger colonies and greater proportions of adult females before parturition and therefore are subject to greater increases in colony size. Thus, we expect greater increase in contact rates in caves after parturition, when compared to bridge colonies. However, the largest bridge colony sampled (MB) had a population size comparable to cave colonies sampled (MB \u00bc 0.75 million; DBC, FC, and JRC \u00bc 0.43-1.3 million Keeley 2004, Betke et al. 2008] ), but did not vary in RABV seroprevalence across the sample periods. We conclude that parturition, sex ratio, and colony size contribute to the periodicity in RABV seroprevalence detected among cave colonies of adult female bats.",

The discrepancy in patterns among colonies of adult females may result from ecological variation across years and locations, but may also reflect differences in diagnostics and survey techniques (e.g., capture in roost vs. during emergence) (Constantine et al. 1968, Steece and Altenbach 1989) .",

Despite the perceived stresses associated with anthropogenic disturbance at man-made roosts, bridge females had higher body condition overall than females roosting in caves ( p \u00bc 0.002), with the greatest differences observed in the Mid period (Fig. 6) . The body condition data suggest that bridge colonies of females may have greater energy to allocate to mounting immune defenses when compared with cave colonies of females, although a companion study found equivocal evidence for greater overall immune status of bats in cave or bridge roosts (Allen et al. 2009 ). Alternatively, there may be differences in RABV infection prevalence between cave and bridge roosts. Constantine (1968) estimated RABV infection prevalence at a bridge colony of Brazilian free-tailed bats in New Mexico near Carlsbad Cavern. Although the infection estimates were higher in normal-appearing bats at the FIG. 6. Mean (AE standard error) body condition indices among adult female bats, from three cave (black; FC, DBC, and JRC) and three bridge (white; MB, SCB, and EEB) roosts, across time periods (n \u00bc 351). Different letters above the histogram bars represent significantly different mean body condition indices. bridge colony, it is unclear whether bats at the two different roosts were collected in the same manner (i.e., collected by hand vs. in flight). In particular, most (four of five) of the infected individuals at the bridge roost were immature young, and perhaps would not have been included in similar samples of free-flying bats at the cave roost (Tables 2 and 3 in Constantine et al. 1968 ). Despite equivocal evidence comparing RABV infection between roost types, it is possible that the higher RABV seroprevalence detected among bridge colonies in this study may be associated with higher infection prevalence at bridge roosts. As the current study was nondestructive, there were insufficient data to test the effect of roost type on infection prevalence.",

Our model of immune competence, as it relates to rabies VNA seroprevalence, has been adapted from RABV infection studies in mice (Smith 1981 , Smith et al. 1982 . Recent studies suggest that parasitism and immunocompetence may vary during reproduction in other colonial bat species (Christe et al. 2000, Pearce and , and may be influenced by roosting ecology in Brazilian free-tailed bats (Allen et al. 2009 ). We presume that lower immune competence leads to lower VNA seroprevalence, but lower immune competence may lead to more a productive infection, thus causing induction of a VNA response that may not have been elicited in an immunocompetent animal. Additional experimental studies are needed to address alternative scenarios on the effects of body condition and immune competence on the humoral (VNA) response to RABV exposure.",

Although we did not have robust sampling of adult male bats in cave roosts, three of the four colonies sampled exhibited a peak in VNA seroprevalence during the Mid period (EEB, FC, and MB). It is possible that males experience contact with developing young that could explain the increase in RABV seroprevalence, although the periodic variation in RABV seroprevalence among colonies of adult males contrasts uniform seroprevalence among cohorts of adult female bats in some of the same colonies (FC and MB). Evidence of sex-specific differences in susceptibility to RABV infection, and possible effects on immune response after RABV exposure, among Brazilian free-tailed bats has been lacking. An alternative explanation for the periodicity observed in the seroprevalence among colonies of adult male bats, but not females within the same roosts, may relate to the proportion of time spent in the roost during the Mid period. Male and nonreproductive female Brazilian free-tailed bats spend significantly more time in roosts after parturition when compared to lactating adult females, consistent with lactating females having higher energetic requirements that require longer or more frequent nightly foraging bouts (Kunz et al. 1995, Lee and McCracken 2001) . Thus, although males have less direct contact with developing young compared to nursing females, they may experience similarly high RABV exposure due to significantly longer duration of time spent in the roost with young during the Mid period. The differences in activity patterns among classes of reproductive and nonreproductive bats may be influenced by environmental conditions that impact the availability of prey (e.g., wetter summers lead to higher prey abundance), in terms of energetic trade-offs between foraging behavior and predator avoidance. Periodicity in rabies VNA seroprevalence was not detected in colonies of adult male bats at Carlsbad Cavern, NM, between May and August 1956 ( p \u00bc 0.91) ( Table 4 in Constantine et al. 1968 ), although comparisons of environmental conditions and prey availability between these studies were not possible. The seasonal and year-to-year variation in activity budgets of different classes of reproductive and nonreproductive bats warrants further study for estimating contact rates and disease exposure in colonial species. Two of the sites (FC and MB) with increased VNA seroprevalence in adult males during the Mid period also had significant seasonal variation in male body condition, with peak values during the Mid period. As the energetic requirements of adult males are thought to be relatively uniform across the summer months, higher body condition of males during the Mid period may be due to increased prey availability during late June and July. This hypothesis is consistent with the timing of episodic prey emergence from agricultural fields within the area of study (Lee and McCracken 2005) . Ongoing studies in this system may clarify the interactions of prey availability, distance to foraging grounds (i.e., ability to closely track fluctuations in prey availability), and activity budgets on the body condition of male and female bats in different roosts (LC Allen, unpublished data), and the relationship between body condition and VNA response to RABV exposure.",

Although young pups were not observed in the crevices of two of the bridge sites (EEB and SCB), we did capture juvenile bats in flight during emergence from all colonies sampled. Our capture methods resulted in sampling of juveniles that were likely to be 4 weeks of age or older, and were engaging in practice flights or emerging to forage independently. Seropositive juvenile bats were detected from all colonies sampled except JRC, but samples sizes at JRC were low (n \u00bc 3) (Table 2) . We did not find evidence for significant variation in juvenile RABV seroprevalence by period or sex, but do find a significant association with body condition. Juvenile bats with lower body condition were more likely to be seropositive. However, the significance of this result was sensitive to the inclusion of six juveniles sampled from DBC during the Mid period (Table 2) . These six bats were the only juveniles sampled during the Mid period among all colonies in the study, and five were seropositive (80%).

Although separate analyses of body condition detected increasing values from Late to Premigratory periods, the body condition of juveniles is expected to steadily increase after parturition, initially due to the rapid development during lactation (Kunz and Robson 1995) and later as both adult and young of the year are preparing for migration.

Steece and Altenbach (1989) reported elevated levels of RABV infection in juvenile bats at Lava Cave, NM, after parturition ( July and August). The data in this study are consistent with, but do not lend evidence to, elevated RABV infection in pups during the first month after parturition. RABV infection among juvenile bats during the early weeks after parturition may result from contact with infected adult females, or aerosol RABV exposure in cave roosts (Baer and Bales 1967 , Constantine 1967b , Winkler 1968 , Constantine et al. 1972 , Davis et al. 2007 .",

One study suggests that greater mouse-eared juvenile bats (Myotis myotis) harbor greater numbers of reproductive parasites compared to adults, perhaps due to lower immune competence (Christe et al. 2000) , although another pair of studies found higher parasite intensities on adult big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus) , and did not report any association of rabies VNA with parasite loads on adult or juvenile bats ). Experimental evidence is needed to evaluate whether pups and volant juveniles may be immunocompromised compared to adult bats, and may experience greater susceptibility to doses of RABV that produce abortive infections in immunocompetent adults (e.g., aerosol inoculation) Bales 1967, Davis et al. 2007 ). The cohort of volant juveniles that were sampled from DBC in late July may have comprised individuals that successfully mounted a VNA response to RABV exposure, or had maternally transmitted rabies VNA. Further investigation into the comparative immune competence and disease susceptibility of adults, pups, and volant juvenile bats is needed, particularly with regard to the significance of maternally acquired immune protection.",

Further study is necessary to address the relationship between the activity budgets of different classes of reproductive and nonreproductive bats and potential for disease exposure, in the context of variation in prey availability and adverse weather conditions between years (Davis et al. 1962 , Constantine 1967a , Lee and McCracken 2001 . A study of several vespertilionid bat species found an increase in the prevalence of coronavirus in-fection in adult female bats during lactation (Gloza-Rausch et al. 2008) , and an independent study found higher Hendra virus seroprevalence in pregnant and lactating female little red flying foxes (Pteropus scapulatus; Plowright et al. 2008) , suggesting that epizootiology in colonial bats may be influenced by reproductive activity.",

Most human rabies cases in the United States associated with bats have occurred during September and October, suggesting contact with bats during the late summer months, but variation in bat and human incubation periods preclude a conclusive temporal association with bat reproductive activity (Messenger et al. 2002) . Nondestructive long-term sampling of natural colonies is needed to provide additional insight into how roosting and behavioral ecology affect enzootic RABV infection in colonial and solitary bats (Amengual et al. 2007) , particularly in the context of variable ecological conditions across years. Individual and population-level models of bat rabies have been proposed using the results obtained in this and similar studies (Dimitrov et al. 2007 (Dimitrov et al. , 2008 , and have demonstrated that immunocompromised bats can contribute significantly to RABV infection dynamics within colonies. Models incorporating seasonal variation into the immunotypic structure of colonies may provide additional insight into RABV infection dynamics among colonial bats.",
