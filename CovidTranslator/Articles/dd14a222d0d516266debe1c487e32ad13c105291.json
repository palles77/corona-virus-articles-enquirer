As of March 10, 2020, a total of 80924 COVID-19 cases in China have been confirmed and 3140 lost their life. In the early stages of this COVID-19, respiratory infection symptoms occurred, with some patients rapidly developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute respiratory failure and even death. Compared with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), the concealed onset, similar or stronger contagion and lower mortality could be defined as the clinical features of the disease [2] [3] [4] . However, many patients suffered a death attack in the early stages of the outbreak in Wuhan City, China.",

In this study, 100 (99.01%), 53 (52.48%) and 23 (22.77%) non-survivors suffered respiratory failure, acute cardiac injury and acute kidney injury, respectively. Univariable analysis indicated elevated hsTnI, myoglobin, creatine kinase-MB, BUN, lactate and decreased oxygen saturation were associated with increased risk of death within 3 days of admission. Representative indicators associated with organs injury including hsTnI, BUN and oxygen saturation were selected and included in multivariable regression analysis. Usually, the level of neutrophils is slightly elevated or normal in virus infections, but significantly elevated neutrophils were observed in this rapid death of patients in our study. Viral infections may impair the immune system and facilitate opportunistic infection and neutrophils are crucial in protection of bacterial infections [22] . So, neutrophil count was also included in our multivariable regression analysis. The median age of 101 died patients with COVID-19 were 71 years (IQR, 59-80) which was older compared to recent report [5] . We also included age in multivariable analysis although median age of patients died within 3 days and survived 3 days of admission did not have significant difference, because older age has been reported to be associated with poor outcomes in critically ill patients with COVID-19 [12] . Multivariable regression analysis revealed that decreased oxygen saturation, increased neutrophil count and elevated hsTnI on admission were associated with increased odds of rapid death within 3 days of hospital admission. Early detection of these factors could help physicians to identify rapid progress of disease and death of patients with COVID-19.",
