Like many bacterial infections, antigen-specific antibody responses have been traditionally considered critical, if not solely responsible, for vaccine-induced protection against Y. pestis. Studies in recent years have suggested the importance of T cell immune responses against Y. pestis infection but information is still limited about the details of Y. pestis antigen-specific T cell immune responses. In current report, studies are conducted to identify the presence of CD8+ T cell epitopes in LcrV protein, the leading antigen of plague vaccine development. Furthermore, depletion of CD8+ T cells in LcrV DNA vaccinated Balb/C mice led to reduced protection against lethal intranasal challenge of Y. pestis. These findings establish that an LcrV DNA vaccine is able to elicit CD8+ T cell immune responses against specific epitopes of this key plague antigen and that a CD8+ T cell immune response is involved in LcrV DNA vaccine-elicited protection. Future studies in plague vaccine development will need to examine if the presence of detectable T cell immune responses, in particular CD8+ T-cell immune responses, will enhance the protection against Y. pestis in higher animal species or humans.",

Infection with the Gram negative bacterium Y. pestis, which is the etiological agent of plague, remains a serious public health threat in many parts of the world and it also has the potential to be used as a bioterrorism agent [1] [2] [3] . Infection with Y. pestis can take several forms. For example, the bubonic plague usually results from transmission of the bacteria via the bite of an infected flea; the bacillus may spread to the blood stream and lungs and progress to the more deadly septicemic and pneumonic forms of Y. pestis infection. The pneumonic plague is also transmissible from person to person via airborne transmission and is almost 100% fetal when left untreated. Vaccines are effective in preventing the infection in humans. Previous studies demonstrated that killed whole-cell (KWC) vaccine could protect the less deadly bubonic plague, and a live attenuated plague vaccine has been tested in certain countries. However, the limited efficacy against pneumonic plague and safety concerns surrounding these vaccines have limited their use in the prevention of plague in humans [4] [5] [6] [7] . Most critically, after many years of research efforts, there are still no licensed vaccines that are effective against pneumonic plague.",

Early phase clinical trials examining safety and immunogenicity have been reported for a recombinant protein plague vaccine comprising of F1 and V antigens [17] . Newer vaccine forms, such as DNA vaccines, have also been tested and have been shown quite effective in eliciting protective immunity in small animal models with V, F1, and other new or less studied antigens [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] .

The critical role of humoral immunity in protection against plague is well established and evidenced by the demonstration that passive transfer of convalescent-phase sera, monoclonal antibodies specific to F1 or V antigen, or immune animal sera generated by recombinant F1 and LcrV vaccination could confer protection to mice from pneumonic and bubonic plague challenge [27, [31] [32] [33] [34] . The role of T cell immunity has only been described more recently. In one report, B cell-deficient \u03bcMT mice, which lack the capacity to mount antibody responses, were used to investigate the cellular immunity against plague [26] . The \u03bcMT mice vaccinated with live Y. pestis could elicit protective immunity against a lethal pulmonary challenge and the observed protection was abrogated by treatment with T cell-depleting monoclonal antibodies (mAb). Moreover, the transfer of Y. pestis-primed T cells to naive \u03bcMT mice could protect against lethal intranasal Y. pestis challenge. Although the reports did not specify which specific bacterial antigen(s) may be involved in such T cell responses against plague, the findings demonstrated that vaccine-induced cell-mediated immune responses, in the absence of protective antibodies, may contribute to the protective immunity against pulmonary Y. pestis infection.",

Cellular immunity relies upon the cytolytic and cytokineproducing capacities of T cells to effectively restrict or even eradicate intracellular pathogens, in addition to its helper function for the development of antigen-specific B cells. Vaccination approach plays a key role in eliciting T cell immune responses. Neither killed organism vaccines nor recombinant protein vaccines are effective in eliciting T cell immune responses due to the exogenous antigen processing and presentation pathways used by these vaccines. In contrast, vaccines comprised of antigens produced in vivo, such as live attenuated vaccines, and gene-based vaccines (DNA or viral vector vaccines) are more effective in generating antigen-specific cellular immune responses, especially class I MHC molecule mediated CD8+ T cell responses [35] [36] [37] [38] .",

Depletion of CD8+ or CD4+ T cells was also conducted to determine if any of these T cell subsets contribute to protection elicited by the V DNA vaccine against lethal mucosal challenge of Y. pestis. Our data provided clear evidence that a CD8+ T cell immune response is, indeed, involved in eliciting protection against Y. pestis challenge in mice immunized with the LcrV DNA vaccine and our findings indicate the need to design and develop next generation plague vaccines with optimal humoral and T cell-mediated immunities.",

Splenocytes were stimulated for 24 hours with one of eight predicted T cell epitope peptides, as listed in Table 1 , and positive T cell responses were identified by the secretion of IFN-\u03b3 in an ELISPOT assay. High levels of IFN-\u03b3 responses were observed when cells were stimulated with peptides LcrV-7 (SYNKDNNEL) or LcrV-8 (IYSVI QAEI) but not with the other six predicted LcrV peptides. Stimulation with the negative control HIV-1 Env V3 (HIV-V3) peptide also failed to induce detectable IFN-\u03b3 secretion. Mice that received the empty DNA vector did not have LcrV peptide-specific IFN-\u03b3 spots after stimulation. LcrV-7 elicited higher IFN-\u03b3 ELISPOT responses (500-700 spot forming cells/million splenocytes) than LcrV-8 peptide (200-400 spot forming cells/million splenocytes) (p<0.05). These results clearly indicated the presence of potential T cell epitopes in LcrV protein and that the LcrV DNA vaccine was effective in eliciting antigen-specific T cell responses in immunized Balb/C mice.",

Preliminary analysis of antibody isotypes has suggested that a Th1-type antibody response may be important in providing better protection [18, 20] .

Two positive CD8+ T cell epitopes were identified from animals immunized with the LcrV DNA vaccine. T cell immune responses against these two epitopes were very high, as confirmed by both ELISPOT and ICS assays. More importantly, depletion of CD8+ T cells in LcrV DNA vaccine-immunized mice led to reduced levels of protection when a Y. pestis intranasal challenge was conducted. This would be the first time that CD8+ T cell epitopes have been identified for the LcrV antigen when CD8+ T cell immune responses were elicited by the Y. pestis DNA vaccine and also that these epitopes play an important role in protection against lethal Y. pestis.",

Antibody responses against bacterial toxins are classical examples of the critical protective immunity against infectious diseases caused by exotoxin-producing microorganisms, such as tetanus and diphtheria. For intracellular bacterial infections, such as Listeria and Mycobacterium, protective immunity often relies upon the development of cell-mediated immune responses to control the intracellular bacteria [48] . Although animal tissues obtained at the late stages of the infection revealed aggregates of extracellular bacteria, Y. pestis has long been considered a facultative intracellular pathogen that replicates within the macrophage phagolysosome in the mammalian host [49] [50] [51] . Therefore, it is not unexpected that cellmediated immune responses may be generated during Y. pestis infection. However, as an acute virulent disease, antibody protection has received much attention as the main mechanism of protective immunity while Y. pestis-specific T cell responses have been less studied in the past.",

            "text": "Results from the current report provide further evidence to demonstrate the direct link between CD8+ T cells and protection in a well-established mucosal challenge model. Identification of two CD8+ T cell epitopes proved the effectiveness of DNA vaccines to elicit high-quality T cell immune responses and provided useful biomarkers to monitor CD8+ T cell responses in future plague vaccine development. Our data justify more studies using gene-based vaccination approaches, such as DNA vaccines, to elicit protective CD8+ T cell responses, which are difficult to elicit by either killed virus vaccines or recombinant protein-based plague vaccines. A more complete profile of cytokines should be mapped to understand whether Y. pestis-specific CD8+ T cell responses are polyfunctional, i.e., whether multiple cytokines are elicited with the LcrV antigen. Protection studies should also be conducted in non-human primates to establish if gene-based plagues vaccines can elicit better protection against pneumonic plague challenges, an important benchmark for plague vaccine development. T cell immunity, especially epitope-specific CD8+ T cell immune responses should be measured in such non-human primate studies to provide guidance to later human studies. Intracellular cytokine staining (ICS) analysis of IFN-\u03b3 production in CD8+ and CD4+ T cells isolated from mouse spleens immunized with V.opt DNA vaccine. (A) A set of sample FACS data, showing IFN-\u03b3 production in CD8+ or CD4+ T cells with LcrV-7, LcrV-8, or HIV-V3 peptide stimulation, as indicated. (B) Percent of peptide-specific IFN-\u03b3 production cells in CD8+ or CD4+ T cells following LcrV-7, LcrV-8, or HIV-V3 peptide stimulation. Data represent the average of 5 mice/group \u00b1 standard deviation. \"*\" shows the statistical difference, p<0.05. Splenocytes were collected at 1 week after the last (4 th ) DNA immunization. . LcrV-specific antibody titers in the serum samples collected at Week 9, prior to Y. pestis intranasal challenge. \"PBS\", \"dCD8\", or \"dCD4\" signify groups immunized with V.opt DNA vaccine and treated with PBS, anti-CD8a, or anti-CD4 monoclonal antibody, respectively, for 5 days prior to challenge. For \"Vector\", the group received empty DNA vector. Antibody titers are expressed as the geometric means with standard deviation of 10-20 mice/group. In vivo protection of V.opt DNA-vaccinated mice treated with PBS, anti-CD8a (dCD8), or anti-CD4 (dCD4) monoclonal antibody prior to lethal challenge. Balb/C mice were challenged with a lethal dose of 80,000 cfu Y. pestis (KIM strain) by intranasal inoculation at one week after the 4th DNA immunization and treated for 5 days with PBS (20 mice), anti-CD8a (15 mice), or anti-CD4 (10 mice) monoclonal antibody. Cumulative survival curves were plotted to show the protection for each group as indicated. The vector control group (20 mice) was included as a negative control. \"*\" shows the statistical difference, p<0.05 compared to the PBS-treated group.
