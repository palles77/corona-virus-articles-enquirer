Previous investigations 79 of airway epithelial cells infected with RV in vitro found that type I and III interferon 80 responses were deficient in adults with asthma, leading to impaired viral control and 81 exaggerated secondary responses. 3, 4 However, this finding was replicated in some studies 82 but not others. 5 Human adult asthmatic volunteers experimentally infected with RV in vivo 83 have exaggerated IL-25 and IL-33 responses, which drive Th2 inflammation. 6, 7 Although 84 these data provide a plausible mechanism to link RV infection with the pathogenesis of 85 asthma, they are based on experimental models with artificial infections from laboratory RV 86 6 upregulated in children with RV positive exacerbations (e.g. IL-18R1, CD163), a notable 160 difference was the lack of an interferon signature. 161 162 Discovery of molecular sub-phenotypes of acute wheezing illnesses 163 164",

All associations remained 290 significant after adjusting for age, gender, aeroallergy and Caucasian ethnicity. Our study is the first to investigate acute wheeze/asthma exacerbation phenotypes in 296 children using a systems biology approach. We have confirmed the central role of IRF7 as a 297 gene network hub and have identified two distinct IRF7 molecular phenotypes, IRF7 hi 298 exhibiting robust upregulation of the Th1/type I interferon response and IRF7 lo with an 299 alternative activation signature marked by upregulation of cytokine and growth factor 300 signalling and downregulation of interferon gamma. Importantly, the two phenotypes also 301 produced distinct clinical phenotypes. Compared with children with IRF7 hi , those with IRF7 lo 302 had a slower progression of illness from initial symptoms to hospital presentation, a greater 303 likelihood of a hospital admission, and a greater chance of representation with a further 304 exacerbation. Exacerbation severity at presentation was not different between the two IRF7 305 patterns, perhaps because presentation to hospital is likely to be determined by symptoms 306 reaching a severity threshold that causes parental concern. However also worth noting is 307 that the apparently impaired IRF7 response in IRF7 lo children was not associated with an 308 increase in exacerbation severity at presentation, although perhaps expectedly the reduced 309 IRF7 response was associated with slower resolution of the episode. These findings were 310 unaffected by the respiratory viruses or bacteria detected and medication use. Investigation 311 of a replication cohort using RT-qPCR produced similar findings despite variations in the 312 subject characteristics between the discovery and replication cohorts. In summary our 313 findings reveal two distinct phenotypes with clear differences in gene regulation patterns, 314 either upregulation of robust innate immune responses or cytokine and growth factor 315 signalling, and associated differences in clinical characteristics. 316 317 Asthma and wheezing exacerbations are largely triggered by RV infections but the 318 underlying mechanisms are not well understood. 2 Previous in vitro studies suggested that 319 author/funder.

[9] [10] [11] 36 Moreover, a clinical trial that evaluated the utility of inhaled interferon beta 324 therapy in adults at the first signs of a cold to prevent worsening of their asthma symptoms 325 failed to achieve its primary endpoint. 37 Our data extend these previous findings by 326 demonstrating that wheezing exacerbations in children are heterogeneous and 327 characterised by two very different IRF7 molecular phenotypes. Upstream regulator analysis 328 suggested that IRF7 hi exacerbations were driven by upregulation of IFNL1, IRF7, and 329 interferon alpha signalling. In contrast, IRF7 lo exacerbations were putatively driven by 330 upregulation of cytokine and growth factor signalling (i.e. IL-6, IL-10, TGFb, CSF3, EGF) and 331 downregulation of interferon gamma. 332 333 IRF7 is a master regulator of type I and type III interferon gene expression. 32, [38] [39] [40] We 334 previously reported that IRF7 gene networks were upregulated in nasal wash samples from 335 asthmatic children experiencing mild-to-moderate viral exacerbations. 10 We have also 336 shown that IRF7 promotes RV-induced innate antiviral responses and limits IL-33 mRNA 337 expression in cultured bronchial epithelial cells, 33 and furthermore in our current study IL-33 338 was downregulated in IRF7 hi exacerbation responses. Girkin et al. reported that knockdown 339 of IRF7 abolished RV-induced type I interferon responses in the airways in a mouse model. 40 340",

Given that children with IRF7 hi exacerbations 367 elicit robust antiviral responses, one possibility is that the airways of these children are 368 sensitive to the host response to respiratory viruses. In this regard, several pathways 369 associated with the IRF7 hi phenotype are known to impact on respiratory function. PD-L1 370 (encoded by CD274) is an immune checkpoint that delivers an inhibitory signal for T cell 371 activation. Upregulation of PD-L1 during respiratory bacterial infections in early life 372 suppresses the IL-13 decoy receptor IL-13Ra2, resulting in persistent airways 373 hyperresponsiveness. 45 MDA5 (encoded by IFIH1) is a pattern recognition receptor that 374 senses RV-derived RNA. MDA5 deficient mice infected with RV have delayed type I 375 interferon responses, impaired type III interferon responses, and reduced airways 376 hyperresponsiveness. 46 The proinflammatory effectors TNF, IFNg, and interferon gamma-377 induced protein 10 can also promote airway hyper-responsiveness in animal models. 47-49 378 379 Another possibility is that IRF7 hi and IRF7 lo exacerbation responses converge on a final 380 common pathway to precipitate respiratory symptoms ( Figure 4 ). For example, CD38 is a 381 receptor with enzymatic activity, which hydrolyses NAD, generating reaction products that 382 modulate calcium signalling.
