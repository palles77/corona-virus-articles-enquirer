            "text": "Of the organisms causing systemic mycosis in cats, Cryptococcus is most commonly diagnosed. In the largest retrospective study evaluating deep mycotic infections in 571 cats, 46 .1% of the infections were due to Cryptococcus. 10 The organism is round to ovoid in shape, thin walled with diameter of 2.5 to 8 \u00b5m ( Figure  33-1) . 17, 20 In tissues, it is surrounded by a heteropolysaccharide capsule that varies in thickness depending on the strain and environment. The capsule provides resistance to desiccation and virulence. 20 Cryptococcus multiplies asexually with narrow-based budding. The infectious particle, the basidiospore, is adapted to be dispersed by air and has properties that allow it to adhere to and penetrate respiratory epithelium and cause infection. 20 Typically, cryptococcosis in people and domestic animals is caused by one of two species: Cryptococcus neoformans (var. neoformans or var. grubii) or C. gattii. 20 Globally, C. neoformans var. grubii is the most common isolate associated with disease in people and animals. C. neoformans causes almost all cases in the United States and Europe. 20, 31 Within the United States, the highest incidence of cryptococcosis in cats is reported in California, Florida, Virginia, and Iowa. 10 C. gattii most commonly causes disease in tropical and subtropical areas, including Australia, Papua New Guinea, Southeast Asia, and Central Africa; it has also been documented to cause infection in the temperate climate of the Pacific northwest, including Vancouver, Canada. 37 C. albidus was confirmed to cause one case of systemic disease in a cat in Japan but has not been recognized as a significant pathogen in cats. 31 cough or dyspnea. 10 Thickening and inflammation of nasal mucosa or nasal granulomas may be visible. Osteomyelitis may occur, leading to facial deformity, including broadening of the nose or swelling of adjacent tissue ( Figure 33-3) . If the nasopharynx is affected, clinical signs may be absent until the infection spreads through cribriform plate and causes meningitis. 38 Alternatively, cats may present dyspneic or with stertorous breathing because of obstruction by fungal granulomas. Lymph node involvement was present in 39% of 263 cats. 10 Mycotic pneumonia and hilar lymphadenomegaly because of Cryptococcus is rare in cats.",

            "text": "The exact mode of transmission is unknown, but most likely occurs by inhalation of yeast cells or basidospores. 13, 20 Once inhaled, Cryptococcus lodges in the nasal passages and causes mycotic rhinitis; lower respiratory infection is uncommon because most organisms are larger than the alveolar diameter of 2 \u00b5m. 17 Some strains are particularly virulent and will destroy adjacent facial bones and spread locally. 20 Rarely, cryptococcosis occurs secondary to a penetrating skin wound, causing localized infection. 37 Clinical signs depend upon location of infection. Infection usually involves the nasal cavity, skin, subcutis, central nervous system (CNS), and regional lymph nodes. Dissemination has been documented ( Figure  33 -2). As mycotic rhinitis of the rostral nasal cavity occurs most often, sneezing, wheezing, and unilateral or bilateral nasal discharge are common presenting complaints. Respiratory signs have been reported in 26% to 83% of cats with cryptococcosis. 12, 39 In another study, 63% of 263 cats had nasal discharge, and 12.5% had A definitive diagnosis of cryptococcosis requires culturing the organism from infected tissue (Box 33-1). Both C. neoformans and C. gattii can be cultured from the nasal cavity of asymptomatic patients. Culture of most systemic fungal infections is laborious and poses a zoonotic hazard to laboratory staff. Culture of Cryptococcus on Abouraud dextrose agar may take up to 6 weeks to be evident. 17 In most cases, a presumptive diagnosis is made by cytologic evaluation. The organism may be detected from nasal swab samples, nasal washing, and nasal tissue biopsy imprint or from aspiration of other infected tissues. Rhinoscopy or advanced imaging may aid in diagnosis. If ocular involvement is present without evidence of disease elsewhere, vitreous or subretinal fluid may be aspirated for cytologic evaluation. Quik-Dip (Mercedes Medical, Sarasota, Fla.), Wright Giemsa, or new methylene blue stains enhance visualization of the thickly encapsulated, broad-based budding yeast cells. If cryptococcosis cannot be confirmed cytologically or histopathologically, then serology can be performed. The antigen latex agglutination test is highly specific and sensitive in detecting Cryptococcus capsular antigen in dogs. It can be performed on serum, cerebral spinal fluid, or vitreous fluid. The specificity and sensitivity has not been described in cats, but infected cats can have extremely high titers (>1 : 65,536). 37 Serial serologic testing can be used to assess response to treatment, and a favorable prognosis often accompanies a decrease in titer.",

Animals presenting with or progressing to CNS disease are 4 times more likely to die than those without CNS signs. 12 In one retrospective study of 59 cats from Sydney, Australia with cryptococcosis, 76% were successfully treated. 41 Determining the ideal duration for treatment can be difficult. It is typically recommended to treat for at least 1 month past clinical resolution, and sometimes therapy is needed for 9 months or longer. If fungal hematogenous spread. Neurologic signs occur in 8% to 26% of cats with cryptococcosis and may manifest as blindness, pupil changes, ataxia, depression, and temperament changes. 10, 12, 41 Cryptococcosis has been diagnosed in cats less than 1 month of age and in those greater than 15 years of age. The mean age at diagnosis is about 6 years, with 58% of cats being between 2 to 7 years of age. 10, 17 Some, but not all studies, have shown breed predisposition, with Abyssinian, Siamese, Birman, and Ragdoll cats being overrepresented compared with domestic shorthairs. 10, 17, 42 Indoor as well as outdoor cats are susceptible to infection. A gender predisposition for cryptococcosis in male cats is inconsistently reported. Cryptococcosis occurs most commonly in immunocompromised people, but most studies of the infection in cats do not show an association with retrovirus infection or other causes of immunosuppression. 20 Unlike other systemic fungal infections, histoplasmosis occurs equally in dogs and cats. 32 Histoplasmosis has been diagnosed in cats less than 8 weeks of age to more than 15 years, and it occurs most commonly in cats less than 4 years of age. 10, 32 The mean age at time of diagnosis is 3.9 years. 7 Both outdoor and exclusively indoor cats are at risk of infection. 10, 30 No consistent gender bias is reported. Breed predilection is not consistently described, but Persian cats were predisposed in one report. 10 Although one retrospective study found that concurrent infection with feline leukemia virus (FeLV) was present in 15% of 96 cats with histoplasmosis, in most reports co-infection with feline retroviruses is uncommon. 10, 29, 30, 32 Although infection with H. capsulatum may be asymptomatic and self-limiting, dissemination is common in cats and may occur in up to 95% of cases, despite a lack of systemic clinical signs. 10 The organs most commonly affected include the lungs (Figure 33-6), GI tract, lymph nodes, spleen, liver, bone marrow, eyes, and adrenal glands. The incubation period is approximately 12 to 16 days in people and dogs and is likely the same for cats. 10, 22 Clinical signs are often present for 2 to 3 months prior to presentation. 29 In 96 cats with histoplasmosis, the most common clinical signs, which occurred in 67% of infected cats, were nonspecific and included lethargy, weakness, and fever. 10 Respiratory signs were present in 39% of the cats and ocular in 24%. When pulmonary involvement is present, clinical signs may include abnormal lung sounds, tachypnea, or dyspnea. Ocular abnormalities included blepharitis, conjunctivitis, anterior uveitis, chorioretinitis, optic neuritis, and retinal detachment. 10, 22 Lymphadenopathy and hepatosplenomegaly can occur with dissemination. If present, bone marrow involvement may lead to cytopathies. 32 Uncommon sites for infection include skin, bone, CNS, and oral cavity. 33, 53 Specific GI signs occur less commonly in cats than in dogs. Oral infection may manifest as ulcerated tissue or proliferative lesions on the gingiva or palate. 33 granulomas are present in the nasal cavity or nasopharynx, debulking the abnormal tissue may aid in treatment. Itraconazole is the drug most commonly used for treatment of feline cryptococcosis, but other azoles as well as amphotericin B have been used successfully. 37 There is no evidence that cryptococcosis is either contagious or zoonotic, but pets may act as sentinels for people.",

It is sporadically reported elsewhere, including California, Ontario, Canada, and Australia. 7 Although reported in 31 states within the United States, the highest incidence is in Oklahoma, Texas, Virginia, and Louisianna. 10, 22 The life cycle of H. capsulatum is similar to other dimorphic fungi. The mycelial stage living in soil is resistant to environmental damage. It sporulates at temperatures around 22\u00b0 C, and the spores are known as microconidia or macroconidia. 22 Lower respiratory infection most likely occurs because of inhalation of infective microconidia. Some cases of histoplasmosis are isolated to the gastrointestinal (GI) system, but an oral route of infection has not been confirmed. 22 At body temperature (37 o C), the inhaled organism transforms into the yeast phase within the lungs, is phagocytized, and replicates intracellularly. Infection may be limited to the lower respiratory system and regional lymph nodes, or yeastladen macrophages may disseminate the organism via lymphatics or hematogenously. In most patients, cellmediated immunity is effective in controlling the infection; however, if a large number of organisms are inhaled or if immune compromise exists, severe disease may occur. 22 In patients with an effective immune system, dormant infections may be reactivated because of immunocompromise. urine and serum is tested. The test can be used to monitor response to treatment; titers decrease with effective therapy and increase with disease relapse. In people, cross reactivity occurs with blastomycosis, coccidioidomycosis, and penicilliosis. At the author's institution, the urine antigen test has been used for monitoring purposes in dogs confirmed to have histoplasmosis, based on cytologic diagnosis. The test is likely applicable in cats, but more research needs to be performed to determine sensitivity and specificity.",

These regions have sandy, alkaline soil, and high temperatures, with the summer mean greater than 26.6\u00b0 C and the winter mean 4\u00b0 C to 12\u00b0 C. 24 In addition, elevation and annual rainfall are low. During prolonged periods of dry, hot weather, Coccidioides survives below the soil as deep as 20 cm. 24 After rainfall, the organism replicates near the soil surface and releases large numbers of infective arthroconidia that disseminate. 24 Infection is most common when the soil is dry and is disturbed, such as by dust storms, earthquakes, or crop harvesting, or following the rainy season. 21 C. immitis is the species found in California in the San Joaquin Valley, while C. posadasii is found in all other endemic areas. 24 Disease is most common in California, Arizona, and southwestern Texas and less commonly diagnosed in New Mexico, Nevada, and Utah. Infections outside of endemic areas are sporadic. In such cases, the individual Routine laboratory tests are often abnormal in cats with histoplasmosis, but findings are not pathognomonic for infection. Anemia, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, or pancytopenia may be present. The most common hematologic abnormality is normocytic, normochromic, nonregenerative anemia, which may be due to chronic inflammation, bone marrow involvement, and GI blood loss. Neutrophilic leukocytosis with monocytosis can also be diagnosed, or the leukogram may be normal. The organism can be seen in phagocytic cells on blood smears, and in a study of 56 cases, it was evident in 20% of the cats with histoplasmosis. 10 Other abnormalities reported include thrombocytopenia and severe pancytopenia. 22 Biochemical abnormalities have included hypoalbuminemia, hyperglobulinemia, elevated liver enzyme activity, hyperbilirubinemia, and hypercalcemia. 32 In one report, radiographic abnormalities were present in over 87% of cats with histoplasmosis, and the most common finding was a diffuse or nodular interstitial pattern in the lungs. 10 Hilar lymphadenomegaly was rare.

            "text": "Definitive diagnosis of histoplasmosis requires identification of the organism cytologically or histologically. Histoplasma is usually present in clusters within cells of the mononuclear phagocyte system in the infected organs. When stained with Wright or Giemsa, H. capsulatum appears as a small (2 to 4 \u00b5m) round body with a basophilic center and lighter halo caused by shrinkage of the yeast during the staining process. 22 Diff-Quik can also be used to stain cytologic preparations. In cats, the organism is most commonly found by fine-needle aspirate cytology of infected organs, including lung, lymph node, dermal lesions, spleen, liver, or bone marrow. Organisms may be seen on evaluation of fluid collected by endotracheal wash, bronchoalveolar lavage, thoracocentesis, or cerebrospinal tap. Histopathologic abnormalities include granulomatous inflammation, but H. capsulatum may be difficult to see with routine staining. If fungal disease is suspected then special stains, such as periodic acid-Schiff (PAS), Gomoris methenamine silver, or Gidley fungal stain, should be requested. Immunostaining has been used to diagnose histoplasmosis in skin biopsy samples. 22 Diagnosis of histoplasmosis by culture of the organism is rarely performed because of the zoonotic risk for laboratory personnel; it can also take up to 4 weeks for results to be available. Serologic testing is unreliable and false negatives are common in animals with clinical disease, and false-positive results may occur in previously infected patients with residual antibodies. 22 MiraVista Diagnostics (Indianapolis, Ind., www.miravistalabs.com) has developed a test that can detect H. capsulatum antigens in urine, serum, or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF); this has been used to diagnose histoplasmosis in people. Sensitivity is increased if both chorioretinitis and anterior uveitis, occur with similar frequency among cats and dogs. 24 In cats, approximately 50% of cases are disseminated. 21 Subclinical infection may occur in up to 70% of dogs; it is unknown if this is true in cats. 21 Coughing is uncommon, but 25% of cats may present dyspneic. The CNS can be infected, and granulomatous mass lesions in the brain are more common than fungal meningitis. Ocular signs may include anterior uveitis, subretinal granulomas, retinal detachment, and blindness. There is also a report of cats that presented for periocular swellings with systemic signs, including weight loss, unkempt hair coat, and lethargy. Clinical ophthalmologic abnormalities were bilateral in each cat and included hyperemia, conjunctival masses, fluidfilled periorbital swellings, granulomatous chorioretinitis, nonhematogenous retinal detachments, and anterior uveitis. 51 Cats were diagnosed with coccidioidomycosis using a combination of clinical findings, serology, and, in two cases, visualization of Coccidioides spherules by either aspiration cytology or biopsy. Active anterior uveitis and periocular swelling resolved with treatment. Chorioretinal granulomas, although persistent, significantly decreased in size. 51 Infection is often limited to the lungs and perihilar lymph nodes, although dissemination of the organism through the blood and lymphatics can occur. 21 When dissemination occurs, the skin is the most frequent site of infection. In 15 cats with coccidioidomycosis that underwent post-mortem evaluation, all had multiorgan involvement. 21 Nonhealing cutaneous lesions, including abscesses, dermatitis, chronic draining tracts, and ulcerations are the most common clinical manifestations. 21 Cutaneous and subcutaneous lesions were reported in 56% of cats in one series of 48 cases. 49 In infected cats, laboratory abnormalities have included nonregenerative anemia, neutrophilic leukocytosis with left shift, monocytosis, eosinophilia, hypoalbuminemia, and hyperglobulinemia. Sensitivity and specificity of serology in cats is unknown. In the report of 48 cats with coccidioidomycosis, of the 39 cats undergoing testing, all were seropositive at some point during their illness.",

Antibody formation typically occurs but is more useful as a diagnostic aid than in fighting the infection. Although people who recover from coccidioidomycosis are considered immune to reinfection, recurrence in dogs and cats is common. It is not known if this is due to premature discontinuation of treatment or to a lack of long-term immunity to Coccidioides. 21 Clinical disease varies from subclinical to fatal; it is not known why some infected animals have self-limiting disease and others die despite treatment. Evaluation of necropsy reports from 1995 to 2005 from the Arizona Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory found that in fatal coccidioidomycosis cases, 25% of the animals involved were cats. It is unclear if this finding is due to more severe disease in cats or if coccidioidomycosis is underdiagnosed antemortem in cats. Infection is most commonly reported in middle-aged cats, with no breed predisposition. There is also no correlation between coccidioidomycosis and feline retrovirus infection. 21 Specific clinical manifestations depend on the site of infection and are extremely varied, making early diagnosis a challenge. Coccidioides appears to be able to infect most tissues. Fever is commonly present at diagnosis, as well as nonspecific signs, including lethargy, anorexia, and weight loss. Respiratory signs are uncommonly recognized, and lung and bone involvement occurs less frequently in cats than in dogs.

Because normal soil organisms destroy most Blastomyces organisms, specific environmental conditions are needed for Blastomyces to survive. Blastomyces thrives in a sandy, acidic soil near water. It has also been isolated from decaying wood and vegetation, animal excrement, a beaver dam, and animal waste. 19, 36 Even in endemic areas, blastomycosis occurs in geographically restricted foci. Living near water is a risk factor for blastomycosis in dogs. In people, disturbing soil is associated with infection, and precipitation may facilitate the release of infective spores. Most people and dogs are likely exposed to Blastomyces on their own property, because there has been documentation of repeated cases occurring at the same location despite occupation by multiple families. 3 The source of infection in cats is unclear. Many reported cases of feline blastomycosis have occurred in strictly indoor cats. One study analyzed 60 environmental samples obtained from four homes in which blastomycosis was diagnosed in cats, and all were negative for B. dermatitidis. 3, 19 During a 10-year period, eight cases of blastomycosis were diagnosed in cats at the veterinary teaching hospital (VTH) in Illinois, while during a span of 11 years, 5 cats were diagnosed with blastomycosis at the VTH in Tennessee. 3, 19 The prevalence of canine blastomycosis in Tennessee between 1979 and 1989 was 1.2%, compared with less than 0.1% in cats. 4 Of 571 cats diagnosed with systemic mycosis, 41 (7.1%) were infected with B. dermatitidis. 10 B dermatitidis mainly causes disease in the United States and Canada, but is endemic in Africa and India and has been documented in Europe and South America. 6 Within North America, endemic areas include the Mississippi, Missouri, and Ohio river valleys; the mid-Atlantic states; and the Canadian provinces of Manitoba, Ontario, and Quebec. 36 Blastomycosis has also are infected by wound contamination or penetrating foreign bodies. The organism becomes pathogenic because of its dimorphic abilities. After entering the skin through a puncture, bite, or scratch, the fungus converts to a yeast phase. The organism has also been isolated from the nails and oral cavity of cats and presumably can be inoculated into bites, scratches, or puncture wounds. 47, 48 Three clinical syndromes of sporotrichosis are known in cats:",

            "text": "Outbreaks of sporotrichosis are thought to be rare. In a large series of 347 cats with naturally acquired sporotrichosis in an epidemic in Rio de Janeiro, the median age was 2 years, and cats of male gender predominated. 46 Most cats were infected through fight wounds, and multiple skin lesions were common. Most lesions were on the head. The skin lesions were varied and included small crusted lesions, subcutaneous nodules that progressed to draining lesions and ulcers, extensive heart, liver spleen, trachea, and adrenal glands. 19, 36 Infection is frequently disseminated. Clinical signs vary depending on the site of infection. The most commonly reported clinical signs in cats with blastomycosis vary among publications, but dyspnea, lethargy, weight loss, and fever are frequently present. 19 Other reported respiratory signs have included cough, tachypnea, sneezing, and increased bronchovesicular signs. 19 Central nervous system, ocular, and dermatologic involvement may manifest clinically as well. Ocular changes described include retinal granulomas and detachment, chemosis, corneal edema, and uveititis. 6, 7, 19 Skin lesions may be draining tracts or nonulcerated dermal masses and range from a few millimeters to a few centimeters in diameter. 19 Diagnosis of blastomycosis can be difficult in cats, particularly because there are no pathognomonic clinical manifestations. Hematologic and biochemical changes are neither specific nor consistent among infected cats but may include anemia, leukopenia or leukocytosis, monocytosis, hyperglobulinemia, hypoalbuminemia, and hypercalcemia. 19 Radiographic changes may include poorly defined soft tissue opacities with nodules or masses or alveolar lung consolidation and pleural effusion. 10, 19 Definitive diagnosis is made by cytologic or histologic identification of B. dermatitidis. Pyogranulomatous inflammation is commonly seen associated with large numbers of broad-based budding yeasts. Diagnosis has occurred by cytologic exam of fine-needle aspirate samples of infected skin, draining tracts, lymph nodes, and lung. Bronchoalveolar lavage can also be performed to diagnose pulmonary blastomycosis. 19 In dogs, the sensitivity and specificity of the agar-gel immunodiffusion test (AGID) was reported as 91% and 96%, respectively. The usefulness of AGID testing for blastomycosis in cats is unknown. Of three cats with blastomycosis tested using AGID, one was positive. 10 MiraVista Diagnostics offers an antigen test for B. dermatitidis that has been validated in dogs and has the greatest sensitivity when urine is tested. 50 It is unknown if this test is sensitive or specific in cats.",

Newer formulations are safer but more expensive. The three types of newer formulations of amphotericin B include a lipid mixture (Abelcet), a colloidal suspension (Amphotec), and a liposomeencapsulated form (AmBisome). The lipid complex is the least expensive and has been used the most in veterinary medicine. 26 It is 8 to 10 times less nephrotoxic than the original amphotericin B, when administered to healthy dogs. 26 The new formulations are taken up rapidly by the reticuloendothelial system, leading to the high drug levels in infected organs, including the liver, spleen, and lungs. 26 A higher cumulative dose of the new formulations may be administered without increasing risk of drug uptake by the kidneys and nephrotoxicity. The lipid-complexed amphotericin B has been used successfully in veterinary patients for treatment of cryptococcal meningitis, histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis, blastomycosis, and other systemic mycoses.",

Cats with severe, progressive, or immediately lifethreatening disease may need amphotericin B therapy. When cats are suspected to have CNS involvement, flucytosine combined with amphotericin B may be the best treatment. Patients should be monitored regularly for drug toxicity and side effects. The ideal duration of treatment is unknown, but treatment for at least 1 month past clinical resolution is recommended; if the patient's owner can afford to treat for an additional month or two, that is recommended in order to decrease risk of recurrence. A decrease in antibody titers is often associated with effective treatment but does not always indicate cure. In the future, with newer diagnostic tests available, including the fungal antigen tests offered by MiraVista Diagnostics, we may be able to serially monitor antigen levels in infected cats and determine an appropriate time to discontinue antifungal therapy.",

            "text": "Rickettsia are obligate intracellular gram-negative bacteria that are transmitted by an arthropod vector, typically a tick. Their pathogenicity in people and dogs is well understood; in cats little is known currently. Ehrlichia organisms primarily infect leukocytes, while Anaplasma species typically infect erythrocytes, endothelial cells, platelets, as well as leukocytes. Reclassification of several rickettsial organisms within the families Rickettsiaceae and Anaplasmataceae (order Rickettsiales) occurred in 2001. 40 The genera Ehrlichia was moved from the family Rickettsiaceae to the family Anaplasmataceae, while the genera Rickettsia remains in the family Rickettsiaceae. 40 Within the genera Ehrlichia, E. phagocytophila, E. equi, and E. platys were moved to the genus Anaplasma, while E. risticii and E. sennetsu now belong to the genus Neorickettsia. 40 Specific information about ehrlichiosis, anaplasmosis, and Rickettsia felis will be described subsequently. Cats appear less susceptible than dogs to common vectorborne diseases, including ehrlichiosis and anaplasmosis. There are several reports of ill cats presenting with clinical signs that are similar to the ones caused by rickettsial disease in dogs. Presumptive diagnosis of clinical rickettsial disease in cats has been based on appropriate clinical signs combined with the presence of morulae administered 3 times weekly for an accumulative dose of 12 mg/kg. 26 If the original formulation of amphotericin B is used, a dose of 0.5 mg/kg IV 3 times weekly has been recommended. 37 Monitoring for changes in renal function, such as creatinine, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and glucosuria, is indicated. Amphotericin B may also be effective as a fungicide by causing immunomodulation and activating macrophage uptake and killing of fungal organisms. 26 Amphotericin B combined with flucytosine may provide the greatest efficacy when treating cats with disseminated disease and/or CNS involvement. This combination is considered by some as the treatment of choice for feline cryptococcosis. 37 Flucytosine is rarely used as sole therapy, but is combined with other antifungals to increase efficacy. It is synergistic when combined with amphotericin B and penetrates the blood-brain barrier. It has been associated with drug reactions in dogs, and its use may be limited to the first 10 to 14 days of treatment. 37 Azole antifungals inhibit ergosterol biosynthesis, interfering with fungal membrane function. 26 One benefit of azole drugs is that they allow for treatment of patients without hospitalization. Itraconazole is considered the drug of choice for treatment of most cases of systemic mycoses that are not immediately life threatening in cats. 26, 37 It does not easily cross the blood-brain, bloodeye, or blood-prostate barriers. Although it does not penetrate these organs well, it has been used successfully to treat fungal meningitis in cats. Such success may be due to a decrease in the blood-brain barrier associated with inflammation. It is more effective than ketoconazole and has fewer side effects. Side effects can include GI upset, hepatic disease with elevations in alanine aminotransferase activity, and rarely, cutaneous lesions resulting from vasculitis. The capsule formulation of itraconazole should be administered with food to increase absorption, while the liquid formulation should be given after a fast. It should not be administered with antacids. Itraconazole is typically dosed at 10 mg/kg PO q24h for treatment of cryptococcosis, histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis, and blastomycosis. 6, 22, 37 Fluconazole is effective in treatment of systemic mycoses, particularly when there is involvement of the CNS, eye, or urinary system. It may be the most effective antifungal for treatment of feline cryptococcosis. 37 It has also been used in cats that cannot tolerate itraconazole or in which itraconazole is ineffective. Published doses include 30 to 50 mg/cat PO q12h and 75 mg/cat PO q12-24h. 37 Ketoconazole is not considered a drug of choice for management of feline fungal disease but has been used successfully in treatment of C. gattii. It has a higher rate of side effects and is less efficacious than itraconazole.",

There is a lack of standardization in available methodologies, and variable serologic cross reactivity occurs among species of Ehrlichia, Neorickettsia, and Anaplasma. 35 Some cats with presumed ehrlichiosis test negative for E. canis antibodies but positive for N. risticii.

Direct contact with an infected cat is the most efficient mode of transmission, but spread by aerosolized droplets over short distances or by indirect contact with contaminated objects is also important. Unlike herpesviruses of other animal species, feline herpesvirus primarily targets epithelia of the upper respiratory tract and conjunctiva and only rarely spreads beyond these tissues to cause systemic disease. Virus replication in these cells results in cell death (cytolysis) and loss. This may manifest as ulceration, necrosis, and inflammation in the oronasal and pharyngeal tissue. In the conjunctiva, epithelial necrosis may also occur, with serosanguinous to purulent discharge, which may be profuse. In severe cases, erosion to the bone may occur in the nasal cavity from rhinitis, and the resultant distortion of bone and cartilage may lead to chronic rhinosinusitis (cats known as \"snufflers\"). In a manner similar to all herpesviruses, FHV-1 enters a latent state in innervating sensory nerves after acute infection. In cats, this most commonly occurs in the trigeminal ganglion, and is estimated to occur in about 80% of infections. 88 From this latent state, the virus can be reactivated, especially during stressful episodes, leading to replication in the epithelia, virus shedding, and in a minority of cats, disease. Termed recrudescence, it can be stimulated by any stressor, including trauma, concurrent disease, parturition, boarding, or changes in social hierarchy. Recrudescent episodes are often asymptomatic, and may be an important mechanism of maintaining the virus in a population. As new, immunologically na\u00efve kittens are introduced, whether by birth (e.g., breeding cattery) or intake (e.g., shelter setting), asymptomatic shedders may expose them to the virus.",

Infection may lead to corneal ulceration because of the viral damage of the corneal epithelium. In fact, FHV-1 is believed to be the most common cause of feline ocular disease, and corneal ulceration in a cat should be assumed to be a consequence of FHV-1 infection until proven otherwise. 110 This may manifest as a typical dendritic ulcer or may progress to involve the stroma, leading to a desmetocele. 110 Occasionally, cats may manifest with stromal keratitis; this uncommon manifestation is a consequence of the immune response to herpesvirus 51 Identification of the infecting agent is critical in these multicat settings in order to aid control and prevention. Vaccines to protect against several of these agents have been developed, some of which are considered core vaccine components. Like viral diseases in other species, very few antiviral chemotherapeutics are available for treatment. However, the repertoire of efficacious drugs is increasing as more research is performed.

As a DNA virus, the mutation rate of herpesviruses is relatively low; thus antigenic variation among FHV-1 strains is not a major concern. The lipid membrane encasing the virion is derived from the infected cell, and contributes to the virus' ability to survive desiccation, making it an efficient respiratory pathogen. However, it also contributes to the virus' lability in the environment; it survives up to 18 hours in a damp environment (less in dry conditions) after shedding onto inanimate objects and is unstable as an aerosol. 87 In addition, it is easily inactivated by any detergent or soap.",

This assay, done on similar samples as those described above, amplifies viral genetic material through repeated rounds of DNA synthesis. The amplified viral material is generally identified using a probe (e.g., TaqMan real-time PCR). This technology has very high sensitivity and specificity, and does not require viable virus, unlike virus isolation. The exquisite sensitivity of PCR is a double-edged sword, however, because it may detect subclinical, recrudescent, and even latent infections; thus positive results must be interpreted carefully. 110,284,291 Studies have shown that, using PCR, FHV-1 may be detected in many clinically normal cats, 178, 276, 291 as well as in normal corneas. 277 In addition, it appears possible that PCR assays may detect vaccine virus as well as field strains. 178 Therefore an increase in test sensitivity does not necessarily equate with diagnostic sensitivity. Genetic detection by PCR may also be used to identify virus in skin lesions of ulcerative dermatitis resulting from FHV-1. 161 In addition, histopathology may identify viral inclusions, and immunohistochemistry can be used for viral detection in biopsy samples. 109,161",

Although none are approved for veterinary use in the United States, some success has been achieved with their use. It is critical to remember, however, that human antiviral medications should not be used unless safety and efficacy have been proven in cats because some have proven to be highly toxic, even fatal to cats. Topical antivirals used in cases of FHV-1 ocular disease include trifluridine, vidaribine, and idoxuridine. These drugs are virostatic, and must be given often; thus owner compliance may be a challenge. Typically, recommendations are to apply these as many times as possible throughout the antigen rather than direct destruction by the virus itself. The corneal stroma becomes infiltrated with mononuclear white blood cells, primarily lymphocytes, which may lead to blindness. 110 Less common manifestations of FHV-1 are ulcerative dermatitis and stomatitis. Ulcerative dermatitis may be multifocal, often involving the face or planum nasale, but may involve other areas of the skin (Figure 33-9 ). Affected cats may not have concurrent or historical evidence of respiratory infection. 161 Because lesions may involve eosinophils in addition to neutrophils, and intranuclear viral inclusions may not always be found, misdiagnosis as eosinophilic granuloma complex is a concern. 161 Cases of stomatitis are also relatively uncommon and may involve the soft palate and tongue. 109, 161 An association with chronic gingivostomatitis has not been found. 238",

Prevalence rates for seropositive status may be as high as 97%. 180 In addition, studies have shown that the magnitude of the FHV-1-specific antibody levels does not necessarily correlate with presence of either acute or chronic FHV-1 infection. 180 Diagnosis of the classic presentation of upper respiratory tract disease in kittenhood is relatively straightforward. Methods for viral detection include virus isolation, viral antigen detection, and detection of viral genetic material. With ocular involvement, conjunctival and/or corneal swabs, scrapings, or brushings are collected for testing. In addition, pharyngeal and/or nasal swabs should be collected from cats with upper respiratory tract disease. 299 In experiments, bovine lactoferrin has been shown to inhibit virus attachment and entry, and may eventually be available as an antiviral treatment for FHV-1. 17 An immune-enhancing probiotic, Enterococcus faecium SF68, used as a dietary supplement has been shown to reduce evidence of clinical disease associated with chronic infection. 160 Although the study size was small (12 cats), the findings warrant further clinical evaluation. At least one study has shown improvement in adult cats with chronic rhinitis by administration of liposomal complexes containing interleukin-2 (IL-2) DNA as an immunotherapeutic. 298 Another approach under investigation is the use of ribonucleic acid interference to inhibit FHV-1 replication. 305",

Effectiveness of rFeIFN in vivo for dermatitis associated with FHV-1 has been shown in at least one case report. 105 L-lysine given orally inhibits herpesviral protein synthesis and restricts virus replication by antagonizing the growth promoting effect of arginine. In vitro, FHV-1 replication was significantly reduced when lysine was present in the growth medium. 179 It is optimal when used early in infection, or as a means to prevent recrudescence during stress, where it has been shown to reduce viral shedding in latently infected cats. 181 However, studies evaluating its usefulness in preventing upper respiratory tract disease (URTD) in multicat settings, such as shelters, have shown no positive effect from daily lysine supplementation. 243 In fact, one study actually found increased viral shedding and severity of signs of URTD in shelter cats fed lysine supplements. 62 In another study evaluating the effectiveness of dietary lysine supplementation in shelter cats with enzootic upper respiratory disease, mean disease scores were higher for cats fed the lysine-supplemented diet. 183 However, food intake (and therefore lysine intake) decreased when lysine was added to the diet. In addition, cats in the study were group housed and group fed so that individual lysine intake could not be monitored. Despite this, oral administration as a bolus (250 to 500 mg/cat/day) for acute infections and as a supplement for prophylaxis in cats with recurrent signs has been recommended. 182 Lysine administration to cats appears to be safe, though the effects of long-term administration on plasma arginine concentrations are not known. 183 In one study, plasma arginine concentrations declined in lysine-supplemented cats during a 52-day monitoring period, leading the authors to recommend monitoring of plasma arginine in cats receiving long-term lysine supplementation. 183 As the overlying epithelia necroses, the lesions ulcerate and become inflamed.

For most vaccines, there is sufficient antigenic overlap to allow cross protection to heterologous strains following immunization with one strain of FCV, but protection against all field strains may not be equal. Genetic variability may also have an impact on disease phenotype, but does not segregate with antigenicity; that is, differences in disease manifestations do not correlate with differences in antigenicity. This, too, has an impact on vaccine design and development.",

Confirmation of a diagnosis of FCV, as with FHV, relies primarily on detection of the virus, because the majority of cats are seropositive for FCV. Viral identification is particularly important in multicat settings. Virus isolation is the gold standard, because it detects replicating virus. Virus can be isolated from conjunctival and nasals swabs, but the highest success rate is achieved with oropharyngeal swabs. Samples should be shipped cooled (e.g., with ice packs) overnight to the testing laboratory. Antigen detection on slides made from swabs of the same sites, as for virus isolation, can also be done but is generally of lower sensitivity. As with FHV, detection of FCV nucleic acid by PCR is being used more frequently for diagnosis and is done on the same samples as for virus isolation. 3 The drawback of PCR testing for FCV not observed with FHV is the genetic variation of FCV, potentially leading to false-negative results. At least one report has identified a highly conserved genetic region of the virus that can be targeted for detection of the majority of field strains. 3, 4 However, it is possible that PCR assays may also detect vaccine virus in addition to field strains. 157 It is recommended that samples submitted for PCR NOT be frozen; refrigeration and shipment on an ice pack is suggested. 157 None of the assays described can distinguish the virus of virulent systemic disease from those causing more classic disease; this classification is currently based on",

In each documented outbreak where data is available, the virulent strain seems to have appeared spontaneously by mutation from caliciviruses already present in the group. Each isolate has been genetically unique. VS-FCV isolates are not members of a single clade. 212 Instead, these mutant viruses are emerging from several different lineages intermixed with other field strain FCVs. In addition, the emergence of these variants seems to involve host and environmental conditions as well. Thus far, no common mutation has been identified; however, at least one report describes point mutations leading to an additional glycosylation site in the capsomer protein of some hemorrhagic isolates. 2 Interestingly, most of the outbreaks associated with this form of FCV have arisen in shelter or rescue situations. One theory is that in these settings, FCV infection may be endemic in the population; in these situations, rapidly replicating virus that can attain high titers in a relatively short period of time is selected for because of the immunity of the endemically infected population. 239 When introduced into a population, this rapidly replicating, \"hot\" variant may lead to systemic dissemination and disease.",

The typical presentation is similar to FHV infection; though the ocular discharge generally remains serous, corneal ulcers do not occur and oral ulcers are common. Typically, cats present with vesicular and ulcerative lesions of the oral cavity that may also involve the lips, nares, and even paronychial skin. Sneezing, hypersalivation, serous ocular and nasal discharge, and fever are seen. Ocular lesions include conjunctival hyperemia, chemosis, and blepharospasm. 133 The majority of infections are mild and selflimiting. Acute lameness with joint and muscle pain may be seen in kittens associated with either FCV vaccine strains or field virus. 219 Affected cats may be febrile, and about 25% have oral ulceration. Clinical signs resolve quickly, usually within 72 to 96 hours. 239 Feline calicivirus has also been associated with chronic lymphoplasmacytic gingivostomatitis. 61 However, other pathogens and host factors likely also play a role in this syndrome. 239 although the ability of this vaccine to protect against future outbreaks of VS-FCV disease is unknown. A bivalent vaccine containing two strains with broad cross-antigenicity based on in vitro cross-neutralization evaluation was found to provide protection against heterologous strains. 235 This study validated the use of cross-neutralization tests to evaluate cross-protection of vaccine strains. It is important to bear in mind that inclusion of two or more strains isolated from different disease manifestations does not necessarily insure broad protection against the varied pathogenic phenotypes. Rather, neutralization assays are critical for assessing the protective spectrum of any new vaccine. It will be difficult to achieve a vaccine that provides protection against all strains in circulation because of the antigenic variability of FCV, and continued evaluation of prevalent strains and their antigenic relatedness to vaccine strains will be critical. In a clinical setting, if vaccine breakthroughs are occurring within a cat population, boosting with a different strain of FCV may enhance the protection of the population.

Because of these occurrences, it is important that veterinarians understand the virus and its pathogenesis not only for patient care but, perhaps, even more importantly for communication with the public. clinical presentation. In cases of suspected VS-FCV, samples from the same sites as for typical presentations should be collected.

Recombinant feline interferon has demonstrated antiviral activity in vitro, but in vivo effectiveness is unclear. 209 Currently, no specific antiviral medication for FCV exists. A recent study showed efficacy of virusspecific compounds in blocking FCV replication in vivo. 270 This technology, which is referred to as phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomer (PMO), uses virusspecific nucleic acid sequences that bind to viral RNA, preventing translation of viral proteins. In at least one study, it was safe and reduced disease development, virus shedding, and mortality. 270 As this technology is developed, a commercially produced medication may become available.

For the former, virus isolation as well as genetic detection by PCR may be performed on oropharyngeal swabs or tissues post mortem. 186, 285 In addition, immunohistochemistry for Influenza viruses are members of the Orthomyxoviridae family. These viruses are enveloped viruses with a genome of single-stranded RNA. The majority of influenza viruses are classified antigenically as type A (based on internal viral proteins). Subtypes of the virus are based on antigenicity of the two viral glycoproteins embedded in the viral envelope, the hemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N) proteins, and are designated by numbers (H1-16; N1-9). In addition to antigenicity, the hemagglutinin also affects virulence of the virus, and certain subtypes are associated with more pathogenic strains, notably H5 and H7. Another important characteristic of this family is the segmentation of the genome, with each virus containing seven to eight separate genetic segments encoding individual viral proteins. This allows for a unique form of viral mutation called reassortment. As with all RNA viruses, the mutation rate of the genome is quite high, and generally manifests as small point mutations, which lead to relatively minor amino acid changes in the viral proteins. Reassortment involves the exchange of entire gene segments when one or more distinct influenza viruses infect the same cell. This is often the mechanism of significant changes in antigenicity, virulence, or host/tissue tropism of influenza viruses. For example, the 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza is a quadruple reassortant, having gene segments from four distinct influenza viruses, two mammalian and two avian in origin. 24 Reassortment is often referred to as \"antigenic shift,\" reflecting the relatively large change in the viral genome, while \"antigenic drift\" refers to the smaller point mutations observed from season to season within a single strain.",

In addition to FPV, the newer canine variants of canine parvovirus (CPV), specifically CPV-2a, CPV-2b, and CPV-2c reacquired the ability to replicate and cause disease in cats. All of these variants are closely related, sharing approximately 99% DNA homology. Parvoviruses are small nonenveloped viruses with a single-stranded DNA genome. A notorious property of the parvoviruses is their extreme hardiness in the environment. They are shed in feces of infected animals and may remain infectious in the environment for months, or even years, when protected by organic matter. 101 Parvoviruses are unique among most DNA viruses in that they have a significant mutation rate, more similar to that of RNA viruses; thus mutations occur in circulating field virus. Feline parvovirus is in evolutionary stasis as compared with CPV. 55 Canine parvovirus-2 is believed to be ancestrally related to FPV. It emerged in 1978, and as it adapted to dogs, additional variants arose with relatively minor amino acid changes in the capsomer protein genes. The original CPV-2 is now believed to be extinct, and CPV-2b is the most prevalent variant in circulation. In recent years, additional variants have emerged, and differ from CPV-2b by just a few amino acid residues, with some leading to antigenic differences. The nomenclature of these variants is confusing and has led to the reporting of several distinct CPV-2c isolates. These variants have been identified in Asia, Europe, South America, and most recently, the United States. 55, 124, 134 One of these variants contains a mutation at amino acid residue 426 of the major capsid protein, an important antigenic epitope of CPV, leading to substitution of an aspartic acid residue with glutamic acid. 56 This mutant has been reported to be replacing CPV-2b in Italy and is present examination reveals crypt necrosis with villus blunting in the small intestines and cellular depletion in bone marrow and lymphoid tissues ( Figure 33 -12). 156",

B-vitamin supplementation should be given parenterally because of decreased food intake and loss in diuresis. A platelet count and activated coagulation time should be evaluated for signs of disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC). Initially, oral intake of food should be avoided to lessen vomiting and slow the bowel mitotic activity necessary for viral replication. Antiemetics may be necessary to control persistent vomiting. In addition to dehydration, a major concern is secondary bacterial septicemia resulting from the leukopenia and intestinal epithelial necrosis; thus parenteral broad-spectrum antibiotics with activity against gramnegative and anaerobic bacteria (e.g., amoxicillin/ clavulanic acid with an aminoglycoside, fluoroquinolone, or cephalosporin) are an important management tool.

Thus this serotype of FCoV is more antigenically related to canine coronavirus than to FCoV serotype 1. 195, 300 As alluded to above, there are two antigenically distinct serotypes of FCoV, based primarily on the antigenicity of the viral spike protein. Viruses capable of causing FIP may be of either serotype; however, the majority of field strains are serotype 1. 19 Feline coronaviruses are also characterized according to virulence, referred to as virus biotype. The most common biotype is that of mild or no disease associated with enteric infection by the virus, and it is often referred to as feline enteric coronavirus (FECV). This is actually a misnomer, because even in asymptomatic infections, the virus can spread systemically, albeit at relatively low levels.

Parvovirus encodes no neuraminidase function; therefore this medication has no direct effect on the virus. Proponents of its use indicate it is beneficial because of its effect on bacterial neuraminidase enzymes.

Two types of shedding patterns are observed: cats that shed virus almost continuously and cats that shed virus only intermittently. 77 In addition, a small number of cats are seropositive for FCoV, but never shed virus in feces, apparently having a high degree of immunity. 77 Chronic carriers are an important source of the virus for other cats within the household. Virus persists primarily in the colon; it may also persist in tissue macrophages, giving rise to recurrent viremia. 147 It is important to note that although FECV (the benign biotype) is highly infectious, FIPV (the virulent biotype) is infrequently spread in a horizontal manner. 221 FIPVs are strongly cell-associated and tissue-associated so that shedding into feces would not normally be possible.",

            "text": "Enzootic disease is common in multicat environments, such as catteries, where losses are sporadic and unpredictable. Overall mortality during a period of years is usually less than 5%. 221 Very occasionally, epizootics with high mortality have been reported that generally last less than 12 months. Epizootics are probably multifactorial, involving factors such as population stresses, overcrowding, high kitten birth rates, and genetically predisposed breeding cats. Risk factors for FIP in catteries include individual cat age, individual cat coronavirus titer, overall frequency of fecal coronavirus shedding, and the proportion of cats in the cattery that are chronic shedders. 78 In addition to changes in viral properties causing the shift from a benign to virulent biotype, the pathogenesis of FIP also involves host factors. Genetic predisposition along familial lines has been observed, and breeds in certain countries or areas appear to have a predisposition for FIP development. 75, 206, 229 However, the incidence of FIP in cat breeds can vary greatly among countries, suggesting that susceptibility to disease is more related to bloodlines than the breed itself. 221 These host factors may manifest in the immune response of the cat to systemic spread of FCoV. In cats that develop FIP, a strong humoral response to infection occurs, with inadequate cell-mediated response by cytotoxic T lymphocytes. 220 Virus factors are important to disease development, because virus strains vary in virulence. It has been theorized that a viral mutation is responsible for the change in biotype of the virus, leading to disease production. Speculation on the genomic locale of this mutation has involved the gene encoding the spike protein, as well as genes encoding several nonstructural proteins including 3c, 7a, and 7b. However, no consistent genetic difference between virulent and avirulent biotypes has been found. In fact, one study found 100% homology in the 3-prime one third of the genome when comparing the enteric and nonenteric forms of the virus from a cat with FIP. 65 Recently, genetic analysis of 56 isolates from cases of FIP (n=8) and asymptomatic FCoV infection (n=48) revealed biotype-specific genotypes in the gene encoding the membrane (M) protein. 30 In addition, phylogenetic clustering of virulent isolates was observed when based upon the genes encoding the spike structural protein and 7b nonstructural protein. These researchers concluded that based on their analyses, cases of FIP arise from infection with a distinct strain rather than in vivo mutation.",

            "text": "Other studies have shown that the product of the nonstructural 3c gene may also play a role in pathogenesis. 38, 225 One research group found deletions within this gene occurring in the majority of FIPV isolates examined (n=28) but intact in all FECV isolates (n=27). 38 They speculate that these deletions lead to poor replication of the virus in the intestines of cats and may explain, at least in part, why FIP outbreaks are uncommon. Another research group had similar findings when analyzing the virus in eight cats that died of FIP, in that extraintestinal virus from FIP lesions in the majority of cases (74%) had deletional mutations in the 3c gene, leading to truncation of the protein, while fecal virus in all cats had an intact 3c gene and presumably functional 3c gene product. 225 One phenotypic change in the virus associated with FIP disease production appears to be efficiency of replication in monocytes and macrophages, in that viruses causing FIP have acquired significant tropism for macrophages. Although FECV may spread beyond the intestines, it does so at relatively low levels, probably because of a poor ability to replicate in monocytes and macrophages. 144, 192, 269 The virus of FIP, on the other hand, replicates at high levels in macrophages and may disseminate throughout the body. Macrophage tropism appears to reside in a region of the spike protein. 254 Quantitative differences in viral RNA levels in the blood of cats with and without FIP have been found. 143 Rising amounts of viral RNA in the blood seen in end-stage disease may indicate enhanced viral replication and disease progression. This increased viral replicative capacity may be a key element of FIP pathogenesis. It is likely that the viral properties responsible for development of FIP do not lie in a single or, even necessarily, the same mutation in all cases, but instead lie in the high mutability of the virus prevalence of FIP. 91 In addition, higher interferon-gamma concentrations were associated with FIP lesions, indicating that, at least at the tissue level, cell-mediated immunity may contribute to lesion development. 91 In particular, it indicates that local activation of macrophages by interferon-gamma may be occurring, leading to enhanced viral replication. 22 In contrast, a systemic increase in interferon-gamma concentrations, as indicated by elevated expression in blood, may protect infected cats from disease. 89,91",

Lesions are distributed along the vasculature, particularly along veins. 146 Vasculitis is the hallmark lesion of FIP, whether the effusive or noneffusive form. Emigration of infected monocytes/macrophages from blood vessels into perivascular regions incites local inflammatory responses. Type II and type III hypersensitivity responses occur with complement activation and cellular destruction. This may occur widely throughout an infected cat's tissues, leading to increased vascular permeability, extensive pyogranulomatous lesions, and the classic signs of the effusive, or wet, form of FIP. Alternatively, focal lesions may be confined to one or more organ systems in the noneffusive, or dry, form of FIP. The cells involved in the inflammatory process are primarily macrophages and neutrophils; however, B lymphocytes play a critical role in producing disease. 145 The incubation period for FIP is unknown, but is probably weeks or months, in some cases, even years. 221 The cat with FIP generally presents with weight loss, fever, and inappetence. The fever may wax and wane and is not responsive to antibiotics. Kittens are often underweight and unthrifty compared with normal littermates ( Figure 33-13 ). Icterus may be seen with both effusive and noneffusive forms (Figure 33-14) . Abdominal palpation of affected cats may reveal thickened bowel loops, mesenteric lymphadenopathy, or irregular serosal surfaces of abdominal organs. Cats with the effusive form characteristically present with significant abdominal ascites. In fact, FIP is the leading cause of ascites in young cats, proving a more common cause than cardiac disease, neoplasia, and hepatic or renal disease. 307 The enlarged abdomen can contain a surprising amount of fluid and may be mistaken for pregnancy by owners of female cats. Typically, the abdominal distension is nonpainful, and a fluid wave can be palpated. Effusion in the thorax and/or pericardial sac may also occur. If pleural effusion occurs, the primary clinical signs may include dyspnea, tachypnea, open-mouth breathing, and cyanotic mucous membranes. Heart sounds will be muffled on thoracic auscultation.",

The former is important in coordinating cell-mediated immunity, which is protective against FIP, while the latter is important in humoral response.

It distinguishes between exudates and transudates. A test tube is filled with distilled water and one drop of 98% acetic acid is added, followed by one drop of effusion sample. If the effusion drop dissipates in the solution, the test is negative and not supportive of FIP. If the drop retains its shape, the test is positive and supportive of FIP. In one large retrospective study, the positive predictive value of the Rivalta test was 86%, and the negative predictive value was 97%. 112 Serum chemistry profiles reveal that many cats with FIP have elevated serum total protein concentrations, because of the high globulin concentrations; however, even with normal total protein concentrations, a decreased albumin to globulin ratio may be evident.

Unfortunately, some commercial diagnostic laboratories use the misnomer \"FIP test\" for coronavirus antibody titer. Although a high antibody titer is consistent with a diagnosis of FIP, it is not confirmatory; in addition, some cats with FIP have low antibody titers or are seronegative. 9 This latter situation may occur in fulminant cases or may be due to high virus levels that bind antibody, making it undetectable in the serologic assay. Therefore serology should only be used as an aid to rule in or rule out the possibility of FIP, and a diagnosis of FIP should never be made on antibody titers alone.",

There may be some risk to introducing a new cat to this population, but generally, outbreaks of FIP are not observed. In most pet cat homes, where the number of cats is small, there should be little risk to introduction of a new cat after a resident cat has died of FIP.

Raccoons, skunks, and bats are the main reservoirs in the United States, but other species such as foxes, coyotes, and bobcats may also be infected.

It is an intranasal vaccine containing a temperature-sensitive mutant of feline coronavirus allowing replication in the upper respiratory tract but not systemically. The vaccine is given as two doses, 3 or more weeks apart, but is not started until 16 weeks of age or older. Although this vaccine appears to be safe, its efficacy has been questioned. A small reduction in the number of FIP cases was noted in one study when the vaccine was given to seronegative cats. 244 However, in cats with preexisting antibody, the vaccine showed no protection. In another field study, the vaccine failed to prevent FIP in kittens with preexisting FCoV antibodies in a cattery. 72 In households in which feline coronavirus is endemic or in which FIP has occurred, most cats are seropositive and thus not aided by vaccination. Kittens at highest risk for FIP are those born into colonies in which the virus is endemic, where infection often occurs by 4 to 6 weeks of age. However, the vaccine is not given until 16 weeks of age; thus the vaccine is of dubious usefulness in those situations in which the risk is greatest. It may provide some protection for seronegative cats entering an infected population, but currently, this vaccine is not recommended as part of core vaccines for routine use. 5, 50, 249 ",

Rabies virus particles (rhabdovirions) are a characteristic bullet shape because of the cylindrical form of the nucleocapsid core. Rabies is an enveloped single-stranded RNA virus. Although all warm-blooded animals are susceptible to infection with rabies, mammals are the only known vectors and reservoirs. Species susceptibility varies considerably; for example, cats, foxes, and raccoons are highly susceptible while domestic dogs, horses, and goats are moderately susceptible, and birds have low susceptibility. Younger animals are generally more susceptible than older animals. Rabies virus is neurotrophic, traveling quickly to the CNS after infection. Salivary glands have high concentrations of virus, thus allowing efficient transmission through bites or saliva-contaminated scratches. An infected cat will be able to transmit the disease in saliva about 3 days before clinical signs appear. Environmental transmission by fomites is rare and infected animals are not viremic, so blood is not infectious. As an enveloped virus, rabies is inactivated by many disinfectants and labile when exposed to ultraviolet light and heat. The virus can remain viable in a carcass for several days or longer, depending on temperature.",

Behaviors such as mutual grooming, sharing of food and water bowls and litter boxes, and fighting can contribute to transmission, primarily through saliva. Resistance to persistent infections increases with age, although the degree of natural resistance is unknown. Kittens less than 16 weeks of age are most likely to remain persistently infected after exposure. However, adult cats may be susceptible to FeLV infection after long-term exposure. 100 These and other results suggest that many cats may remain infected with FeLV for life following exposure but may revert to a regressive state. 97,122,227 One study of 597 Swiss cats found that 10% of cats negative on ELISA for p27 antigen were positive for FeLV provirus by PCR. 122 The provirus is integrated into the cat's genome, and so, it may not be possible to clear infection. 36 The clinical significance of antigen-negative, PCR-positive cats is unclear. One study evaluated 152 necropsied cats, with various disorders, that were negative for viral antigen but positive for FeLV provirus in bone marrow. A significant association with anemia, panleukopenia, and purulent inflammation, but not lymphosarcoma, was found. 280 ",

Some viral proteins, particularly the transmembrane protein p15e, are directly immunosuppressive. The p15e protein affects the interleukin 2 signaling pathway. 155, 191 In addition, FeLV infection may lead to lymphopenia, especially a decrease in CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes, which are critical for viral immunity. Granulocytopenia may also occur, as well as effects on neutrophil function. The result is recurrent or chronic infections with other pathogens (e.g., poxvirus, M. haemofelis, Cryptococcus, Toxoplasma gondii), including agents that are usually of little clinical significance, such as Salmonella or Listeria. 175, 240 Concurrent infection with feline coronavirus may lead to FIP development. Other infections, such as abscesses, rhinitis, and stomatitis, may be slow to resolve. 175 FeLV may be neuropathogenic. 60 Neurologic disease not associated with malignancy has been described and manifests clinically as anisocoria (Figure 33-20) and mydriasis, Horner syndrome, urinary incontinence, abnormal vocalization, hyperesthesia, as well as paresis and paralysis. 29, 34 malignancies are occasionally seen. Prior to the 1980s, about 80% of feline lymphomas were FeLV-related. A dramatic shift has occurred, where now only a small percentage of cats with these malignancies are FeLVpositive. For example, only 8% of cats with lymphoma treated at the Animal Medical Center in New York between 1988 and 1994 were FeLV positive. 44 PCR detection of proviral DNA in tumor tissue may uncover more cases than FeLV antigen testing alone. 111,303a Lymphomas are classified based on anatomic locale as mediastinal (thymic; Figure 33-19) , alimentary, multicentric (lymph nodes), or extranodal (kidneys, CNS, skin). Leukemias are generally classified as to the cellular origin (e.g., erythroid, granulocytic, myelocytic). of a positive result obtained by ELISA is recommended, particularly in healthy cats. False-positive results are possible, and may be due to a number of factors, including improper testing or kit storage and hemolyzed samples. A false-negative test result can occur if the cat is tested too early in the course of infection for detection of soluble antigen (less than 4 weeks). In addition, because ELISA testing on serum can detect early infection, it does not distinguish transient from persistent infection. The confirmatory test recommended is the immunofluorescence assay (IFA), which detects virus infected cells, primarily neutrophils. It is best performed on a smear prepared from fresh whole blood, because anticoagulants can interfere with results. 15 This assay can detect infection only after the blood cell precursors in the bone marrow have been infected (stage 4), 6 to 8 weeks after exposure. Thus an IFA positive result indicates that the cat is likely persistently infected. False-negative IFA results may occur in leukopenic cats. False-positive results may occur if the smear is too thick, if background fluorescence is high, or if the test is performed and interpreted by inexperienced personnel. 166 Early in infection a cat may be ELISA positive and IFA negative; these cats should be rechecked with ELISA in 1 to 3 months to determine their status. If the ELISA result remains positive, a second IFA test should be performed to confirm. Uncommonly, a cat may remain discordant (ELISA positive, IFA negative); the reason for this is unclear but may be seen in a latently infected cat that is periodically antigenemic. In these cases, PCR may be used to detect proviral DNA. PCR can also be used to detect provirus DNA in antigen-negative cats that are regressively or latently infected. PCR is recommended only for cats that are to be used as blood donors, cats with persistently discordant ELISA/IFA results, or antigen-negative cats that are believed to have a FeLVrelated disorder, like lymphoma.",

Within a clade, variations in genotype as well as phenotype may occur, including emergence of more pathogenic subtypes. 53, 230 Recombination between two distinct isolates may also occur with co-infection, leading to new strains as well. 118 Infection with lentiviruses related to FIV has also been documented in many nondomestic cat species around the world, such as the lion, puma, and Florida panther. In general, the isolates from nondomestic cats are less pathogenic than domestic cat FIV. This suggests that nondomestic cats have been living with the virus for a long time and that infection of domestic cats is more recent. Domestic cats can be infected with isolates from nondomestic felids, but do not develop the same clinical and immunologic abnormalities found in FIVinfected cats. 292, 297 Variations in the envelope glycoprotein affect crossreactivity and cross-protection among virus strains.

Queens may be infected during mating if bitten by an infected tom cat. However, transmission through sustained contact among infected and uninfected cats, as with FeLV, may occur. 7 In addition, in utero and lactogenic transmission to kittens from queens may occur, especially if the queen is experiencing high levels of viremia. 12, 208 In utero transmission may lead to fetal resorption, abortion, or stillbirth and is likely due to placental inflammation. 40 However, experimental evidence suggests that not all kittens in a litter will acquire infection in utero from an FIV-infected queen. 207, 208, 251 When the pregnant queen is acutely infected and has a high viral load, most of the kittens will become infected. However, when the pregnant queen is chronically infected and healthy, with low a viral load, few kittens will become infected. Complicating the picture is the fact that some kittens born to FIV-infected queens have FIV provirus detected in tissues, but not blood, and are negative for FIV antibody in blood. 11 In experiments, queens can be infected through semen, but it is unknown how important this mode of transmission is in nature. 139 After inoculation of FIV, the virus replicates in T-helper (CD4+) lymphocytes, which are critical cells for appropriate and adequate immune responses to infecting pathogens. The virus binds through CD134 molecules and may also use a chemokine receptor (CXCR4) for attachment on the cell surface. 68 CD134 protein is upregulated on activated T lymphocytes, thus making these cells the primary target of FIV. Viral infection of these cells leads to disruption of normal function, as well as cell death. In addition, during the acute phase of infection, infection of a subset of T-helper cells, the T-regulatory lymphocytes, contributes to the disease process. These cells have an immunosuppressor function. It has been shown that infection of these cells with FIV leads to activation, and, by definition, immunosuppression. This may contribute to the ineffective FIV clearance with resultant chronic infection, as well as immunodeficiency. 194 In addition to T lymphocytes, the virus infects macrophages and dendritic cells.",

FIV may infect neural tissue, causing neurologic disease, affecting central or peripheral nerves. Clinical signs reported include seizures, behavior changes, cognitive difficulties, and paresis. 126 Renal disease has also been associated with FIV infection and may be similar to HIV-associated nephropathy. Affected cats have glomerular and tubulointerstitial lesions, elevations in BUN and creatinine, and proteinuria. 232, 233 In one group of 155 cats with FIV, azotemia and proteinuria were more common than in age-matched uninfected cats. 164 In an Australian case-control study of 73 cats with chronic history of FIV vaccination. 113,168 Despite these results, confirmation of positive ELISA results when screening a healthy cat is recommended.

            "text": "Routine diagnosis of FIV infection currently relies on detection of virus-specific antibody. Rapid screening for viral antigen is not possible, because the amount of circulating virus is low after the acute stage of infection. FIV produces a persistent, lifelong infection so that the detection of antibodies is sufficient for diagnosis as long as the cat has not been vaccinated for FIV. Detection of FIV-specific antibodies is initially performed using a point-of-care ELISA or immunochromatography kits. Using these kits, most cats will have detectable FIV antibody within 60 days of infection, but some cats take up to 4 months to seroconvert. 15 Comparison of several diagnostic kits that are commercially available indicate a high sensitivity and specificity and significant (>90%) negative and positive predictive values in cats with no to FIV-vaccinated queens (n=12), but were no longer detectable at 12 weeks of age. 177 In another study, passively acquired antibodies in five kittens from infected queens declined to undetectable levels only by 17 weeks of age. 237 None of the routine testing methods can distinguish passively acquired maternal antibodies from antibodies produced by infected kittens; thus kittens less than 6 months of age testing positive using these assays should be retested when maternal antibodies wane. For example, kittens can be rested at intervals of 30 days until negative for FIV antibody. Though infection of kittens, even those born to infected queens, is uncommon, one must assume a kitten testing positive is contagious until a negative result is achieved. Kittens greater than 6 months of age with FIV antibodies are more likely to be infected. Because of concerns regarding detection of passively acquired FIV antibodies, it is tempting to delay testing kittens for FIV until after 6 months of age. Because they are a low-risk group, most kittens test negative and can reliably be considered clear of infection. However, infected kittens could be a source of infection for other cats if they are not identified and isolated. Compliance of both owners and veterinarians with retroviral testing recommendations was low in one published study so that delaying testing of newly acquired kittens until 6 months of age would potentially result in many cats that never undergo FIV testing at all. 95 The recent development of a vaccine for FIV has complicated testing in countries where it is available (e.g., Canada, United States, Australia, New Zealand, and Japan, but not Europe), because the current technology used for screening tests cannot distinguish natural infection from vaccination. 168 Antibodies derived from vaccination persist for more than 1 year, and possibly for more than 4 years. 166, 168 In some cats, it may be difficult to determine if a positive FIV antibody test means the cat is truly infected with FIV, is vaccinated against FIV but not infected, or is vaccinated against FIV and also infected. Detection of viral nucleic acid by PCR has been proposed as an alternative testing method for vaccinated cats. However, both false-negative and false-positive results may occur. 25, 46 For the former, the most common cause is the inherent genetic variability of FIV strains, making development of a genetic assay that can detect all strains challenging. False-positive results have been observed in vaccinated cats. 46 In one study, the sensitivity and specificity of PCR testing for FIV varied tremendously among laboratories. The most accurate test was the real-time PCR, but it had a sensitivity of only 76%. 46 Newer PCR technologies, such dual-emission fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) real-time PCR, may prove more reliable for discrimination of FIVvaccinated from FIV-infected cats. 301 Because of the limited sensitivity of currently available assays, PCR is not useful as a screening tool for FIV and will not replace in-clinic or referral laboratory ELISA tests. Rather, PCR testing should be reserved for FIV antibody-positive cats that have an unknown vaccination history or that have been vaccinated against FIV but where infection is still suspected. PCR test results must be interpreted with caution. A positive FIV PCR result from a laboratory with stringent quality control should confirm FIV infection and should not be affected by FIV vaccination. However, a negative FIV PCR result does not rule out infection, but may reflect a level of viral nucleic acid below the limit of detection, or a strain of FIV that is not detected by the test.",

Retrovirus-infected cats may respond to treatment as well as uninfected cats, although in some cases, longer or more intensive courses of therapy may be needed. It is important for both the veterinarian and owner to allow enough time for response to treatment and not become discouraged too quickly. Treatment of the ill FIV cat requires a full health evaluation, including a minimum database (CBC, chemistry panel, urinalysis) and identification of any secondary infecting agent. When secondary infections are identified, institution of appropriate treatment (e.g., doxycycline for M. haemofelis infection) may resolve the clinical problem. Supportive treatment may also be indicated depending on the severity of the illness. Treatment of chronic stomatitis with corticosteroids is controversial because of adverse effects with long-term use. Griseofulvin should never be used in FIV-infected cats, because it causes bone marrow suppression 266 ; newer azole drugs are safe and effective for treatment of fungal infections.",

Limited data from placebo-controlled trials in small groups of cats has been published, reporting increased lymphocyte counts, more rapid recovery from respiratory infections, and reduced viral load in LTCI-treated cats. 90 Data on survival of retroviral infected cats indicate that the lifespan of FIV-infected cats appears similar to that of uninfected cats. FIV-infected cats may have a long disease-free period, especially if wellness care is provided and exposure to other infectious diseases is limited. In one study conducted in the United States, records of 67,963 cats that were tested for FeLV and FIV in 2000, and that had outcome information available 6 years later, were analyzed. 169 The 6-year survival rates were 90% for uninfected cats and 65% for FIV-positive cats. Most deaths in cats with FIV occurred in the first year after diagnosis, probably because of the illness that prompted the original veterinary visit or because of euthanasia for purposes of infection control. A study of 17,289 cats in Germany tested for FeLV and FIV from 1993 to 2002 included survival data on 100 randomly selected cats, including 19 FIV-positive cats. There was no statistically significant difference in the mean survival time of FIV-positive cats (785 days) compared with FIV-negative cats (625 days). 94 In a study of 1,205 cats tested for FeLV and FIV in western Canada, FIV-positive/ FeLV-negative cats were compared with randomly selected, age-matched and sex-matched FIV/FeLVnegative cats. The median survival time for FIV-positive cats (n=39, 3.9 years) was not significantly different from that of FIV-negative cats (n=22, 5.9 years). 242 Management of the FIV-infected cat is similar to the FeLV-infected cat, including client education about isolation (again, not only to prevent spread of FIV, but to protect the FIV-infected cat from infectious agents carried by other cats) and other management issues (see . Guidelines for management of retrovirus-infected cats have been published. 126,166 Wellness exams should be performed every 6 to 12 months to allow early detection, diagnosis, and treatment of health problems (see . FIV-infected cats will require hospitalization both for treatment of illness and for routine wellness care (e.g., surgical sterilization, dental prophylaxis); simple infection control precautions should be instituted (see . Administration of perioperative broadspectrum antibiotics should be considered for surgical and dental procedures. As for FeLV, FIV is not considered a zoonotic disease, and one study of 204 veterinarians and others with potential exposure to retroviruses failed to detect infection using serologic and molecular methods. 31 Vaccination of healthy FIV-infected cats against core diseases should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis, taking into account individual risk factors. As for FeLV, inactivated vaccines are often recommended but no data exist to support the recommendation. Healthy cats with FIV have adequate immune responses to vaccination. 48, 163 Concern exists that activation of infected lymphocytes by vaccinations may increase viral replication 48 ; however, the clinical significance is unclear. 126 FIV vaccination is of no benefit and should not be administered to FIVinfected cats.",

            "text": "Agents of viral enteritis in cats other than coronavirus include astrovirus, rotavirus, reovirus, enterovirus, and calicivirus/norovirus.* These agents, all nonenveloped RNA viruses, may survive for extended periods in contaminated environments. They are transmitted orally, and unlike parvoviruses, infect the intestinal epithelia from the lumen. They target mature epithelia at the villus tips, leading to intestinal villus atrophy. Disease, which manifests as diarrhea without blood, is typically only seen in very young animals, where turnover/ replacement of intestinal epithelia is slower than in adults. The most serious consequence of disease in affected kittens is dehydration. Because these are not systemic infections, changes in leukocyte levels and other signs of systemic disease, such as depression and fever, may not be seen. Diagnosis can generally only be accomplished using electron microscopy. Treatment is supportive, with fluids being the key component. Environmental decontamination involves cleaning with a detergent to remove all organic matter followed by disinfection with an appropriate product with oxidizing activity (e.g., 6% sodium hypochlorite, potassium peroxymonosulfate). Zoonotic transmission of rotavirus and perhaps norovirus is possible; thus owners should take appropriate precautions when handling affected cats. 43, 263 Bornavirus Borna disease was named after a town in Saxony, Germany where, in 1895, an outbreak of fatal neurologic disease occurred in horses. The causative virus was identified in 1925 and named Bornavirus. Since that report, Bornavirus has been identified in a number of species, including cattle, donkeys, dogs, wild birds, and ostriches, and occurs virtually worldwide. 140 It is a cause of encephalomyelitis in many species. In the mid-1990s, *References 42, 43, 188, 248, 263, 275. papillomavirus type 9. 198 In cats, though infection appears to be infrequent, papillomaviruses have been associated with papillomas, fibropapillomas, and squamous cell carcinomas.* Papillomavirus skin lesions have also been reported in a cat with FIV infection. 66 Papillomas most likely develop after introduction of the virus through skin lesions or abrasions. The papillomaviruses have a specific tropism for squamous epithelial cells. Lesions in cats appear distinct from those in other species and are locally extensive, often multiple, and can appear on the skin or in the oral cavity. 279 Oral papillomas are small, soft, light pink, oval, slightly raised, flat, and appear on the ventral lingual surface. 279 Cutaneous papillomas may be rough, raised, pigmented or nonpigmented, scaly plaques (Figure 33-24) . 279 Histologic examination reveals pigmented, hyperplastic Bornavirus was isolated from cats experiencing a neurologic disease in Sweden called \"staggering disease.\" 174 Since that report, evidence of potential Bornavirusassociated disease has been described in cats in Australia, the United Kingdom, and Japan. 141, 201, 213, 245 Evidence of infection with Bornavirus, but not necessarily disease, has been found in several countries. FIV-infected cats may have a higher prevalence of infection. 119, 130 Bornavirus is a single-stranded RNA virus in the family Bornaviridae with a helical capsid and a lipid envelope. Its genome is nonsegmented and approximately 9000 bases in length. Interestingly, the virus does not appear to be cytolytic. In affected animals, the disease is a nonsuppurative meningoencephalitis, and pathology includes an inflammatory response in the CNS and demyelinating lesions. 103 Asymptomatic infection has also been documented. 204 The most characteristic clinical sign is hindlimb paraparesis and ataxia (staggering); other clinical signs include behavioral changes, lumbosacral pain, anorexia, hypersalivation, hypersensitivity to light and sound, visual impairment, seizures, and inability to retract the claws. 103 The clinical signs progress over 1 to 4 weeks until the patient either deteriorates to the point of death or euthanasia, or stabilizes. Recovered cats may be permanently affected with motor dysfunction or personality changes. 103 The mode of transmission of Bornavirus is unclear, though vectorborne transmission has been postulated because of its seasonality, with most cases occurring in spring and summer. 103 Transmission by bodily fluids has also been proposed, and rodents and birds have been postulated to be reservoirs. 103 The virus is believed to reach the CNS from its site of entry by axonal migration. The immune response is believed to play a role in disease development and is primarily mediated by CD8+ T lymphocytes. 23 Diagnosis is problematic and controversial, because the presence of antibody is not confirmatory and virus is present at low levels, even in affected tissue. Ante mortem, it is a diagnosis by elimination of other causes. As well as postmortem examination, histopathology, and immunohistochemistry of CNS gray matter for Bornavirus antigen may be required for diagnosis. Treatment is largely supportive; however, given the immunopathologic component, corticosteroids may be beneficial.",

Orthopoxviruses are enveloped DNA viruses that are relatively stable in the environment, surviving under dry conditions for months to years. They are readily inactivated by common disinfectants. The reservoir hosts are small rodents, such as voles and wood mice. Cowpox infection is seen primarily in rural cats that hunt rodents, and cases are typically seasonal, occurring in the summer and fall. 20 The virus is probably inoculated under the skin through a bite wound. The virus replicates locally, producing a skin lesion, and then spreads systemically, causing more widespread skin lesions within 1 to 3 weeks. The skin lesions are small nodules at first, but form well-circumscribed ulcers that become scabbed. 20 The lesions gradually exfoliate after 4 to 5 weeks, and new hair growth occurs, although some lesions may result in permanent bald patches. Signs of systemic illness occur early in infection in some cats; they are generally mild and include pyrexia, anorexia, and depression. Severe or fatal disease is rare and is typically associated with immunosuppression, such as from retrovirus infection or administration of immunosuppressive drugs. 20, 262 Feline cowpox virus infection is diagnosed by culturing dried scab material, electron microscopy, or PCR.

Antibody levels may remain elevated for prolonged periods, even if the organism is cleared; in addition, the latter is difficult to document. Antigen preparations vary among the different serologic assays, affecting results. Having said this, although the positive predictive value of a positive test is low, the negative predictive value of a seronegative result is much higher. 35 Definitive diagnosis of infection should be performed with culture and/or PCR on blood samples. Generally, multiple samples must be tested because of the intermittent nature of bacteremia. Culture is done by sterile blood collection in ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA)-containing tubes. Tubes should be kept chilled until reaching the diagnostic laboratory. Because special conditions and enriched media are required, labs having experience with this organism should be selected and consulted for optimal collection and transport methods. 35 Nucleic acid detection by PCR is much more rapid, but is no more sensitive than culture, and reveals nothing about organism viability.

Clinical infection with these organisms results in granulomas but not true tubercles. In cats, localized lymphadenitis can occur, but disease can disseminate if the cat does not mount an appropriate immune response. Disseminated MAC infection occurs, therefore, in immunocompromised animals, such as cats receiving immunosuppressive therapy after renal transplantation 31 and cats with retroviral infections; 40 congenital immune deficiencies are also considered to be a possible predisposing factor. 6 Epidemiology MAC and other slow-growing saprophytic mycobacteria are ubiquitous worldwide in soil and water when conditions are acidic (pH 5.0 to 5.5) and soils are high in organic matter, such as swamps, coastal plains, and brackish coastal waters. 48 MAC is found in large numbers in the feces of infected birds. Infection of cats occurs by ingestion of infected meat or contact with infected soil or contaminated fomites. Despite the widespread nature suspected, the sample should be divided into three pieces. One piece is fixed in formalin for histopathology and acid-fast staining, and one is sent for routine bacterial culture. A third piece is placed in a sterile container and frozen.

Unfortunately, the causative species are fastidious and typically cannot be grown using routine mycobacteriologic techniques, even in specialist laboratories. Recent studies incorporating PCR methodologies have led to the recognition that there are numerous agents associated with feline leprosy, including M. lepraemurium as well as at least three novel mycobacterial agents. 4, 7, 27 In Australia and New Zealand, feline leprosy has typically been considered to be composed of two syndromes: one caused by M. lepraemurium (affecting younger, mostly immunocompetent cats) and one caused by a novel mycobacterial species currently described as Mycobacterium sp. cat (affecting older, immunocompromised cats). 52 However, a recent study has recognized another organism from a specific regional area, described as Mycobacterium sp. strain Tarwin, with no obvious age or sex predisposition in affected cats. 27 In a study of 26 cases in New Zealand and British Columbia, Canada, various species were identified, such as M. lepraemurium, M. intracellulare, M. mucogenicum, M. septicum, as well as one case of Mycobacterium sp. cat. 17 Three cats from the northwestern United States and western Canada have been diagnosed with diffuse cutaneous and disseminated disease similar to diffuse lepromatous leprosy in people caused by M. visibile. 7 Feline leprosy has been reported from many areas of the world, including New Zealand, Australia, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, the United States, Canada, and Italy. Many cases originate in temperate coastal areas, suggesting that the route of infection may be rodent or insect bites or contamination of cat fight wounds with soilborne organisms. 56 Feline leprosy is characterized by single or multiple nodules of the skin and/or subcutis, often on the head, face, limbs or trunk. The nodules are painless, well circumscribed, moveable, and firm or soft on palpation. Overlying skin may be intact or may ulcerate if lesions are large.

Treatment of mycobacterial disease poses several difficulties. To be effective, antimicrobials must reach therapeutic concentrations within phagocytes in various tissues but with minimal toxicity to the host. Importantly, there is a propensity for mycobacteria species, in general, and MAC organisms, in particular, to spontaneously and rapidly develop antibiotic-resistant mutants. 58 Multiple agents should therefore be used to reduce the chance of resistant clones developing. Using several agents concurrently, however, increases the likelihood of adverse drug reactions, because each agent has a potential toxicity profile. Furthermore, some of these toxicity profiles overlap. 58 M. bovis and M. microti infections in cats have been successfully treated with a combination of rifampin, plus enrofloxacin or marbofloxacin, plus clarithromycin or azithromycin. 18, 33 It is appropriate to treat localized MAC infections (or other slow-growing saprophytes) with surgical excision followed by combination antibiotic therapy with clarithromycin and doxycycline. 46 Disseminated MAC infections (or other slow-growing saprophyte) are best treated with clarithromycin in combination with at least one other agent, such as clofazimine or rifampin. 6 There is widespread resistance of MAC strains to the traditional fluoroquinolones, 2 but newer agents, such as moxifloxacin, may have some role in treating these organisms.

Hypercalcemia of granulomatous disease develops only occasionally. Diagnosis of mycobacterial panniculitis is similar to other mycobacterial infections; an index of suspicion on the part of the clinician is essential. Specimens for cytology (acid-fast staining) and culture are best obtained by fine-needle aspiration of pockets of purulent material through intact skin that has been disinfected with 70% ethanol (to eliminate skin-dwelling mycobacterial species). 55 Material from draining tracts is usually unsuitable, because of the high numbers of contaminating secondary bacteria.

However, some cases, especially those caused by M. fortuitum in the United States remain frustrating to treat. 39 Initial treatment should be with one or two oral antimicrobials chosen empirically, then adjusted based on susceptibility data. In Australia, doxycycline and/or a fluoroquinolone (such as pradofloxacin or moxifloxacin) are appropriate choices for first-line therapy, whereas in the United States, clarithromycin is the drug of choice for empiric therapy. Treatment durations are typically 3 to 12 months, and agents should be administered for at least 1 to 2 months after affected tissues look and feel completely normal. Surgical resection of persistently nonhealing tissue may be necessary. 63 In human medicine, RGM infections may develop resistance to quinolones (but not doxycycline or clarithromycin) during therapy. 12 For this reason, many veterinary dermatologists in Australia routinely use combination therapy with doxycycline and a fluoroquinolone from the outset. Although some RGM strains show in vitro susceptibility to amoxicillin-clavulanate, this drug combination has no efficacy in vivo.",

Other penetrations of the integument (such as through bite wounds, penetrating foreign bodies, injections, surgical wounds) may also allow RGM infections to become established in subcutaneous tissues, especially in fat.

Initial lesions are circumscribed plaques or nodules at the site of injury, although trauma to the skin is not always reported. 39 Many patients are initially treated for a cat fight abscess with surgical drainage and antibiotics, although the lesions do not have a fetid odor or the typical bacterial discharge.

A definitive diagnosis is best made by documenting current infection, which can be achieved with a variety of techniques that vary by the body system; these include fecal flotation, cytology, histopathology, immunohistochemistry, culture, antigen tests, and molecular diagnostic assays. For some agents, antibody test results are also used to help make a clinical diagnosis. However, presence of antibodies may only document prior exposure, not current infection. Sensitivity is the ability of an assay to detect a positive sample; specificity is the ability of an assay to detect a negative sample. Sensitivity and specificity vary with each assay. Positive predictive value (PPV) is the ability of a test result to predict presence of disease; negative predictive value (NPV) is the ability of a test result to predict absence of disease. Many of the infectious agents encountered in feline practice infect a large percentage of the population, resulting in positive organism detection techniques or serum antibody production. However, they only induce disease in a small number of cats in the infected group. Classic examples include coronaviruses, Toxoplasma gondii, and Bartonella spp. For these agents, even though assays with good sensitivity and specificity are available, the predictive value of a positive test is actually very low.",

It must be noted that antimicrobial sensitivity is not available using this technique; therefore it is complementary to traditional culture techniques. However, the use of PCR for detection of certain genes that encode for antimicrobial resistance genes is starting to gain clinical use as well and may provide additional rapid information prior to sensitivity results being available. 23 It is difficult to acquire quantification information using traditional end-point PCR. Real-time PCR or quantitative PCR (qPCR) is the most recent application of PCR. 12 In this technique, production of DNA is monitored during each amplification cycle so that the original starting quantity could be extrapolated by identification of the logarithmic amplification phase of each individual reaction. This technique uses fluorescent dyes or probes that produce a signal after formation of the product (Figure 33-29) . During each amplification cycle, a detector records the amount of fluorescence in the sample. Pathogen detection and load are one of the many applications of this technology. This assay has all the advantages of traditional end-point PCR (good sensitivity, specificity) but also offers a more rapid result and the ability to quantify microbial DNA or RNA load and so can be used to monitor therapy in some cases (see the following sections of the chapter). Because qPCR is very sensitive, strict quality control must be maintained. In addition, accuracy of quantification is reliant upon the availability of a reproducible, high-quality, standard curve. Although minimum laboratory standards have been proposed and are generally met for published protocols, 4 many diagnostic laboratories use proprietary reactions that are not subject to peer review. Thus all laboratories providing PCR assays may not be equivalent, and so, use of laboratories that have published results of their assays may be prudent.",

Less commonly, FCV is associated with conjunctivitis, polyarthritis, and lower airway disease in kittens. Virus isolation can be used to document current infection but takes at least several days for results to return. Because of widespread exposure and vaccination, the positive predictive value of serologic tests is poor. Reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR assays can be used to amplify the RNA of FCV, and results can be returned quickly. However, these assays also amplify vaccine strains of FCV. 27 FCV RNA can be amplified from samples collected from normal carrier cats as well as clinically ill cats and so have poor positive predictive value. 24 For example, in one study in our laboratory, presence of FCV RNA failed to correlate with the presence or absence of stomatitis in cats. 26 In addition, amplification of FCV RNA cannot be used to prove virulent systemic calicivirus infection. The negative predictive value for FCV RT-PCR assays is currently unknown. Feline caliciviruses, as RNA viruses, have genetic variability among the different strains. Depending on the viral genetic region targeted by the assay, the degree of genetic variation among strains at that site will vary. Most laboratories design their assays to target conserved regions of the viral genome, but even this cannot guarantee that all strains are detectable by any individual assay. FHV-1 is a common differential diagnosis for cats with clinical evidence of rhinitis, stomatitis, conjunctivitis, keratitis, and facial dermatitis. Because of widespread exposure and vaccination, the positive predictive value of serologic tests is poor. FHV-1 can be documented by direct fluorescent staining of conjunctival scrapings, virus isolation, or PCR. FHV-1 DNA can be amplified from conjunctiva, nasal discharges, and pharynx of healthy cats, and so, the positive predictive value of conventional PCR assays is low. 34 Currently used PCR assays also detect vaccine strains of FHV-1, further lessening the positive predictive value of the assays. 21 In one study in our laboratory, presence of FHV-1 DNA failed to correlate with the presence or IFA-negative cats with unexplained small bowel diarrhea and when the genotype of Cryptosporidium is to be determined. However, C. felis infection in cats is common, and so, positive tests results do not always prove that the agent is the cause of the clinical disease. No drug is known to eliminate Cryptosporidium spp. infections, and small animal strains are not considered significant zoonotic agents; so, PCR is never indicated in healthy animals.",

Trophozoites of T. foetus can often be detected on wet mount examination of fresh feces, which can be completed as an in-clinic test. PCR for T. foetus DNA is indicated if wet mount examination is negative and results return more quickly than culture. However, DNA of T. foetus can be detected in healthy carrier cats, and so, positive results do not always prove illness from the organism. 8 Cases with suspected salmonellosis or campylobacteriosis should be cultured rather than assessed by PCR to determine the anti-microbial susceptibility patterns. In dogs, the PPV of Clostridium spp. PCR assays on feces is low and, if used, should be combined with enterotoxin assays. Information in cats is currently lacking. There is no current evidence that parvovirus PCR on feces is superior to currently available antigen assays. It was recently shown that cats vaccinated with modified live panleukopenia-containing vaccines shed parvovirus DNA in feces within several hours. 7 Thus parvovirus PCR testing should not be used to diagnose panleukopenia virus outbreaks in recently vaccinated cats. Toxoplasma gondii is only shed for about 7 to 10 days, and millions of oocysts are generally shed during this time, making the organism very easy to identify. Thus PCR assays are usually not needed to diagnosis this infection. Because virus isolation is not practical clinically, RT-PCR is used most frequently to detect coronavirus RNA in feces. However, positive test results do not differentiate FIP-inducing strains from enteric coronaviruses. Additionally, in one study, presence of coronavirus RNA did not correlate to the presence of diarrhea in shelter cats. 7",

In experimentally infected cats, Mhf is apparently more pathogenic than Mhm. It appears that Mtc has intermediate pathogenicity. Diagnosis is based on demonstration of the organism on the surface of erythrocytes on examination of a thin blood film or PCR assay. Organism numbers fluctuate, and so, blood film examination can be falsely negative absence of stomatitis in cats. 26 Quantitative PCR may ultimately prove to correlate with the presence or absence of disease, but it failed to correlate with the presence of conjunctivitis in one study. 20 The negative predictive value of FHV-1 PCR assays is also in question, because many cats that are likely to have FHV-1 associated disease are negative. This may relate to clearance of FHV-1 DNA from tissues by a hypersensitivity reaction. Tissue biopsies have greater sensitivity than conjunctival swabs but do not necessarily have greater predictive value. FHV-1 DNA can be amplified from aqueous humor of some cats, but whether this indicates FHV-1 associated uveitis is unknown. 22 Mycoplasma spp., Chlamydophila felis, and Bordetella bronchiseptica are other common respiratory pathogens in cats. As for FHV-1 and FCV, PCR-positive test results for these organisms cannot be used to distinguish a carrier from a clinically ill cat. However, in one recent study, Mycoplasma spp. DNA was amplified from conjunctival swabs from more kittens with conjunctivitis than control cats in the same shelters, suggesting the organism can be pathogenic in some cats. 36 In addition, PCR assays do not provide antimicrobial drug susceptibility testing, and so, for cats with potential bordetellosis, culture and sensitivity is the optimal diagnostic technique, especially if an outbreak is occurring. Toxoplasma gondii DNA has been amplified from airway washings of some cats with lower respiratory tract disease, and so, PCR is an option for evaluation of samples from diseased animals from which the organism is not identified cytologically.",

Fecal antigen tests are also accurate, and there are several assays available for pointof-care use, including one labeled for veterinary use. Fecal PCR assays are often falsely negative because of PCR inhibitors in stool, and so, PCR should not be used as a screening procedure for this agent. However, Giardia spp. PCR can be used to determine whether the infective species is a zoonotic assemblage, which is the primary indication for this technique. However, it now appears that assemblage determination should be performed on more than one gene for most accurate results. 30 Although Cryptosporidium spp. infection is common, it is unusual to find C. felis oocysts after fecal flotation in cats. Acid-fast staining of a thin fecal smear is cumbersome and insensitive. Antigen assays titrated for use with human feces are inaccurate when used with cat feces. Thus PCR may be aid in the diagnosis of cryptosporidiosis in dogs and cats and has been shown to be more sensitive than immunofluorescence assay (IFA) in cats. 31 Cryptosporidium spp. PCR assays are indicated in spp. infection. 3 Cats that are culture negative or PCR negative and antibody negative, and cats that are culture negative or PCR negative and antibody positive, are probably not a source of flea, cat, or human infection. However, bacteremia can be intermittent, and falsenegative culture or PCR results can occur, limiting the predictive value of a single battery of tests. 17 Although serologic testing can be used to determine whether an individual cat has been exposed, both seropositive and seronegative cats can be bacteremic, limiting the diagnostic utility of serologic testing. Thus testing healthy cats for Bartonella species infection is not currently recommended. 3, 14 Testing should be reserved for cats with suspected clinical bartonellosis. Because Bartonella spp. infection is so common in healthy cats, even culturepositive or PCR-positive results do not prove clinical bartonellosis. For example, although we detected Bartonella spp. DNA in more cats with fever than in pairmatched cats without fever, the healthy cats were still commonly positive. 16 Combined serology with PCR in evaluation of cats with suspected bartonellosis is likely to give the best predictive value.",

Adapted from Table 50-2 in Greene CE, editor: Infectious diseases of the dog and cat, ed 3, St Louis, 2006, Elsevier. of MAC organisms in the environment, infections in cats have been uncommon because of natural resistance. No evidence has been found for spread of MAC organisms from animals to people. Infection with MAC organisms begins with ingestion of contaminated food or contact with the organism in the environment. MAC infections in cats are often disseminated through many tissues and are due to organisms closely related to the M. avium subspecies paratuberculosis that causes chronic granulomatous enteritis in ruminants (Johne's disease). It is thought that animals with Johne's disease acquire the infection as neonates, although it initially becomes quiescent. Stress or immunosuppression later in life allows the organisms to replicate and produce disease. A similar scenario may occur in predisposed cat breeds (Siamese, Abyssinian) in which disseminated infections typically develop while cats are young, possibly because of defects in cellmediated immunity. 6,44",
