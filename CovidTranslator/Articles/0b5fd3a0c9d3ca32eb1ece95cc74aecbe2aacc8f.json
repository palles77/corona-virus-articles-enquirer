Definitive aetiology for the polyps is not known, however, chronic inflammation, infection with calicivirus, and congenital or familial factors have been hypothesised as causes. Nasopharyngeal polyps usually affect cats less than 3 years of age, however, they have been reported in older cats. Polyps may grow into the middle ear, nasopharynx or external ear canal, and clinical signs occur secondary to obstruction of the nasopharynx or ear canal. Associated clinical signs include: dysphagia, voice change, inspiratory stridor, sneezing, rhinitis, otitis externa, and otitis media/interns, with or without associated peripheral vestibular disease. Diagnosis is made on the basis of an otoscopic examination, nasopharyngeal examination, and imaging (skull radiographs, CT or MRI). Treatment is surgical removal of the polyp by means of ventral bulla osteotomy (Fig 6) . Prognosis following surgical removal is excellent, however, the polyp may return (Seitz et al 1996) .",

Cats should be tested for infection with feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), since concurrent infection with FIV and toxoplasmosis, results in a worse prognosis. Serologic evidence of disease is a four-fold increase in the IgG toxoplasma titre, between acute and convalescent samples, and demonstration of IgM and IgG antibodies in CSF. Diagnosis of clinical toxoplasmosis cannot be based on serology alone.

Primary infection occurs in the upper respiratory tract, sinuses and oropharynx, with secondary systemic spread and extension to the CNS. Although the major site of involvement in the CNS is the meninges, extension to the ependyma of the ventricles and brain parenchyma also occurs. In cats, unlike dogs, the C neoformans organism provokes only a mild inflammatory response. Diagnosis is primarily based on history, physical, neurological and ophthalmoscopic examinations.",
