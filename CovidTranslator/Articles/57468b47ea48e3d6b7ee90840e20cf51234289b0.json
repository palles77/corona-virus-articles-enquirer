In the case of infectious disease, however, the interaction of two natures, that is, two genomes (host and pathogen), is at play. Environmental and social factors, or nurture, may affect the risk of acquiring infection, and also the risk of becoming ill. How we behave and what environment we live in will determine the number of exposure events (Weiss and McMichael, 2004) . The dose of infection and the fitness of the host and pathogen will determine sickness (van Opijnen and Berkhout, 2005) . After all, unfit pathogens can make excellent live attenuated vaccines.",

Herpes B virus elicits little more than cold sores in its natural host, the macaque, whereas in humans it causes a life-threatening encephalitis. Similarly, Escherichia coli O157 rarely affects cattle adversely but gives humans severe diarrhea, and H5N1 avian influenza virus is more virulent in geese, chickens, and humans than in ducks. Many hostmicrobe combinations coevolve with an apparent drive toward decreased pathogenicity of the microbe in its host reservoir, a constraint that can be relieved upon transfer of the microbe to another species.",

In some situations, however, the pathogen can be regarded as a constant, thereby revealing the contribution of the host. For instance, the SARS coronavirus that spread from human to human during the 2003 outbreak came from a point source and was essentially an invariant clone. Yet we can discern at least three human host phenotypes of infection, namely, death, recovery, and superspreaders. Moreover, being a superspreader was not highly correlated with severity of disease, and luckily for the human population, superspreaders represented a small proportion of those who became infected. We do not know to what extent human genetic variation determined death, recovery, and infectiousness to others, but it should be studied. Doubtless, correlations will be found in the immunogenetics of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). However, other factors that are difficult to reduce to one type of gene-possibly specific differences in the coordinated multicell, multipathway response to SARS coronavirus-may have been involved.",

However, clear examples of balanced polymorphisms are few, and we have to beware of altruistic interpretations. Perhaps the best evidence is where there is a tradeoff between resistance to infection and genetic disease. This is seen in the various hemoglobinopathies (\u03b1-and \u03b2-thalassemia, and sickle cell anemia) where the resistance to infection with the malaria parasite of those who are heterozygous for the gene mutation counterbalances the lethal effects of recessive disease in homozygotes. The relatively high frequency of cystic fibrosis may also be explained if those heterozygous for mutations in the chloride channel (CTFR) survive severe enteric infections such as typhoid because of reduced dehydration; in this case, heterozgotes may be considered the functional equivalent of oral rehydration therapy. Five years into the human postgenomic era, we are gaining considerable knowledge about host-pathogen interactions through host genomes. This \"infectogenomics\" approach should yield further insights into both diagnostic and therapeutic advances, as well as normal cellular function.",

The delta 32 deletion in the gene encoding the CCR5 chemokine receptor is frequent in the Caucasian population.

Heterozygotes also benefit from relative resistance to infection and, when infected, progress to AIDS more slowly. But like cholera and CTFR, HIV is too recent an arrival in humans to account for the selection of delta 32 CCR5. Resistance to smallpox or the plague has been postulated as the original selective force, but compelling evidence has not been forthcoming.",

To date, however, scanning the genome for single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) or other markers has not been particularly fruitful in revealing genetic loci associated with a trait for infectious diseases. This is due to the fact that much of the genetic variation underlying infectious disease susceptibility is complex, involving the combination of many loci, and is further confounded by SNP variations between different populations and ethnic groups. Such surveys, therefore, require careful design, and it may be that identifying loci in animal models is a more straightforward way of highlighting loci and genes in humans. Correspondingly, it has been more fruitful thus far to identify polymorphisms in candidate human genes for infectious disease.",

Most of the transmissible strains of HIV-1 require the CCR5 chemokine receptor as a fusion receptor after the virus particles bind to the CD4 receptor on host T cells. There are widespread polymorphisms in the promoter region of the CCR5 gene that affect the density of receptor expression on the surface of CD4 + T lymphocytes. There is also polymorphism in the number of gene copies of its main ligand, the CCL3L1 form of the cytokine MIP-1\u03b1. Careful analysis of susceptibility to HIV infection and progression to AIDS in large human cohorts reveals that it is the combination of CCR5 and CCL3L1 polymorphisms that has the most telling effect on disease (Gonzalez et al., 2005) . High chemokine expression combined with low receptor expression delays the development of AIDS in the host. This makes sense from our understanding of HIV entry into cells because CCL3L1 competes with HIV for a limiting number of receptors.",

Some of these changes are common to large groups of infection; for instance, many viruses stimulate interferon response pathways. Changes in gene expression profiles can also betray the type of pathogen present with the potential of identifying the pathogen through host gene expression (Huang et al., 2001) . Thus, gene expression patterns in blood could serve as a window into the pathogenesis and diagnosis of infectious diseases. Whole blood and purified peripheral blood mononuclear cells exhibit interpatient variation, reflected in the global gene expression patterns of the samples but nevertheless can be interpreted through knowledge of other clinical parameters such as differential blood counts, temperature, and gender.
