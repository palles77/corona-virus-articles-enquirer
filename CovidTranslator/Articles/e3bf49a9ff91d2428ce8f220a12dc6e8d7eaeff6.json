            "text": "Hierarchical geographical traffic networks are critical for our understanding of scaling laws in human trajectories. Here, we investigate the susceptible-infected epidemic process evolving on hierarchical networks in which agents randomly walk along the edges and establish contacts in network nodes. We employ a metapopulation modeling framework that allows us to explore the contagion spread patterns in relation to multi-scale mobility behaviors. A series of computer simulations revealed that a shifted power-law-like negative relationship between the peak timing of epidemics s 0 and population density, and a logarithmic positive relationship between s 0 and the network size, can both be explained by the gradual enlargement of fluctuations in the spreading process. We employ a semianalytical method to better understand the nature of these relationships and the role of pertinent demographic factors. Additionally, we provide a quantitative discussion of the efficiency of a border screening procedure in delaying epidemic outbreaks on hierarchical networks, yielding a rather limited feasibility of this mitigation strategy but also its nontrivial dependence on population density, infector detectability, and the diversity of the susceptible region. Our results suggest that the interplay between the human spatial dynamics, network topology, and demographic factors can have important consequences for the global spreading and control of infectious diseases. These findings provide novel insights into the combined effects of human mobility and the organization of geographical networks on spreading processes, with important implications for both epidemiological research and health policy. human motion, including ultraslow diffusion [3, 4] and strikingly high predictability [6] . It is these abnormal properties that actually shape the difference between the natural human movements and the so-called L\u00e9vy flights [7, 16] .",

Thus, we assume here that besides local, close-contact-driven and smaller outbreaks, it is the movement of individuals among the many different scales of a large geographical network that is actually essential to the spread of a global epidemic.",

In one such model [9] , agents can generate not only power-law-like travel displacement distributions, but are also able to display a scaling behavior in the probability density of having traveled a certain distance at a certain time, which is in agreement with recent empirical observations [4] . In addition, it has been shown that inter-event or waiting time distributions also display non-Poisson statistics. We therefore argue here that an implementation of a hierarchical network in our present study can help us understand highly relevant aspects of real epidemics that are otherwise difficult to capture with models that enable only local behavior, i.e. mixing at only one or two scales [22] .",

We also see that after a sufficient number of iterations, the majority of agents resides in higher-layer cities, which again depends on the value of the parameter w. Thus, as w increases, the long-range jumps to higher-layer cities become more frequent ( Fig. 2(b) ).

As shown in Fig. 3 (a) and (b), the spreading velocity is monotonically accelerated with the increasing value of the layer-dependent weight w. When the ratio of layer-dependent weight w is held constant (Fig. 3(d) and (e)), we find that the contagion spreads first from its source location to the closest higher-layer city (directly linked to the contagion source), and then diffuses to the surrounding same-layer cities of the initially affected higher-layer city via available long-range links. Cities in the lower layers of the network are the last ones to become infected. These results suggest that higher-layer cities are at a higher risk for fastgrowing epidemic, and long-range travelers may play the crucial role in this spreading process. Moreover, it is certainly not by chance that hub-like nodes with great infectivity in epidemic contact networks are actually dubbed the superspreaders in the epidemiological literature [28] .",

This phenomenon will significantly delay the spreading process, which in turn will be gradually enlarged by the hierarchical organization of the system, ultimately resulting in the negative correlation between the spreading velocity and population density. This further implies that the actual population distribution deeply impacts the spreading process: The hierarchical system with many small and loose settlements will result in slower spreading velocity and higher unpredictability.

Obviously, the cost C correlates negatively with d c : When d c is large, only a few higher-layer cities will be screened. On the other hand, small d c implies that much more cities will be involved in the screening procedure. Since there are more long-range travelers for larger w, the cost C also increases with the value of w. Fig. 7(a) shows the relationship between C and d c for different values of w (in the inset).

The higher the ratio s=s 0 the longer the relative delay of the peak timing of epidemic spreading. When compared against the scenario without border control, our simulations show that the efficiency of the screening of long-range travelers is deeply affected by several socio-demographic factors such as city size and population density. First, we find that border control of long-range travelers would be a more efficient measure when the diversity of cities is rather small (i.e. small w). As shown in Fig. 7(b) , the ratio s=s 0 rapidly decreases with the growth of w. As expected, the border control of long-range travelers was found to be more efficient for small w, which corresponds to more homogeneous cities and a lower influx of passengers from distant regions. As mentioned previously, when w is large, only a few higher-layer cities can manage to collect the largest fractions of the simulated population, such that a swift local outbreak in higher-layer cities has much more contribution to the overall spread of infections in the rest of the network. Moreover, since larger w implies a more costly border control for the same threshold d c (Fig. 7(a) ), the feasibility of this control measure for the condition with the larger city diversity is further reduced. Additionally, the relationship between the ratio s=s 0 and the cost of border screening C is logarithmic for w \u00bc 1 (the inset in Fig. 7) , indicating that the improvement of the border screening efficiency would be rather limited if one would only enlarge the screening range. Thus, the above discussed results regarding the efficiency of border control are rather pessimistic, however, the observed sensitivity of the epidemic delay to the probability p of isolating an infected agent shows another picture. The growth of the ratio s=s 0 with p is quite fast and surprisingly shows a super-exponential form (Fig. 7(c) ), suggesting that the efficiency of the proposed border control mechanism can largely be improved if the screening procedure is more dedicated to increasing the probability of infector detection and isolation.",

When w is large, the effect of population density is weakened, because in this case, the rise of local infections within a city weakens the gradual enlargement effect. Thus, we find here that besides w, the population density also has an additional impact on the outcome of a control measure, which would be more efficient in hierarchical systems with many small and loose settlements.",

In the early stages of disease transmission, higher-layer cities are at a higher risk for a fast-growing outbreak, which is mainly caused by the infected long-range travelers.

Generally, studies of epidemic spreading on directed networks are relatively rare [44] , even though directed flow is known as an essential characteristic of many asymmetric real-world processes such as contagion spread in trade networks [45] , in which the availability of a given network link does not guarantee the reciprocal connection. Future investigations of epidemics on hierarchical networks should not ignore these issues. For example, in a hierarchically organized system, some starting peripheral nodes could have only out-links, while the majority of others could allow for mobility in both directions; however, some inter-layer transitions or quarantined areas could be specified with in-links only.",

This may further indicate that just as many other natural phenomena, also epidemic spread patterns may have some universal properties that are shared by all world cities and sustained across different cultures and times [46] .

Our study finds that the effectiveness of border control is sensitive to the specific pattern of cities and the associated population distribution. This in turn suggests that the conclusions of previous studies related to special regions [33] [34] [35] could be carefully promoted to other situations. Generally speaking, the underdeveloped and developing countries usually have more homogeneous cities, and some countries with low population density typically have loose population configurations.

Our results suggest that the interplay between the dynamics of human spatial behavior and network topology can have important consequences for the global spreading of infectious diseases.

This is why the fitting slope in the inset of Fig. B .8(e) is smaller than that in the inset of Fig. 6(a) . Above all, both the shifted-power-function-like negative relationship between s 0 and the population density hm s i and the logarithmic positive relationship between s 0 and S can be explained by the gradual enlargement of the fluctuations in the spreading process. This analysis additionally implies that the smooth-spreading assumption cannot always provide a meaningful description of the spreading process, in particular in hierarchically organized networks. Furthermore, the observed enlargement of the width of the curve of X with larger n s and smaller hm s i implies that the spreading process has less predictability and more variability in the hierarchical organization [48] , especially in networks with more layers or many small and loose settlements.",

(ii) Differently from the hierarchical network scenario, agents can directly jump between any pair of nodes in the L\u00e9vyflight scenario. The move length of each move is here again defined as the Euclidean distance from the starting to the target city, as in the previously discussed hierarchical network structure. (iii) The move-length distribution of the L\u00e9vy-flight model was set to accurately correspond to the move-length distribution of the hierarchical network scenario. To this effect, we first create a data set containing a record of a large number of move lengths in the hierarchical network model with given parameter settings. In the L\u00e9vy-flight model, for each individual movement (starting e.g. with city A), we then randomly pick a move length (e.g. d \u00bc d 0 ) from the hierarchical network dataset and we set it as the length of this move. Next, for the target city of this movement we randomly select one city from the set of cities having exactly the distance d \u00bc d 0 from the city A. (iv) As in the hierarchical network scenario, agents cannot move across the boundary of the lattice.",
