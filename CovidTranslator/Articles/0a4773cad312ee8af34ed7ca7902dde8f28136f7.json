Routine serological diagnosis and surveillance play an important role in the prevention of PRDC, as it is a leading cause of economic losses to the swine industry. We herein describe an advanced microsphere-based immunoassay that permits the simultaneous detection of antibodies to PCV2 and PRRSV, thereby reducing the time and effort involved in testing. Recombinant PRRSV nucleoprotein antigen and the PCV2 capsid antigen were coupled to fluorophore-dyed beads with distinct spectral addresses. Weekly serum samples from 72 pigs that were experimentally exposed to either PCV2, PRRSV, or both PCV2 and PRRSV were used to validate the microbead assay (MBA) in comparison with the \"gold standard\" enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. The kinetics of the PCV2-and PRRSV-specific antibody responses measured by the microbead assay were comparable to those of the standard assays; Spearman's rank correlations were 0.72 (P < 0.001) for PRRSV and 0.80 (P < 0.001) for PCV2. Diagnostic sensitivity and specificity were determined using field sera whose positive or negative status was determined by the standard tests. The diagnostic sensitivity and specificity were both 98% for PCV2 and were 91% and 93%, respectively, for PRRSV (kappa coefficients, 0.85 and 0.67 for PCV2 and PRRSV, respectively). Multiplexing did not interfere with assay performance or diagnostic sensitivity. Therefore, the described study demonstrates proof of concept for the development of more versatile and economical microbead array-based multiplex serological test panels for veterinary use.",

Therefore, early detection and prevention of coinfections are important aspects of managing PRDC. Growing piglets are the most severely affected, with PRDC resulting in morbidity which can be as high as 70%, poor feed conversion, and lower growth rates. Porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) and porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) are the most frequently associated with PRDC. Swine influenza viruses (SIVs), porcine respiratory coronavirus, Mycoplasma spp., Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, Streptococcus suis, and Pasteurella spp. may also be etiological agents (3, 14, 20, 36) .",

            "text": "Due to the severe economic losses associated with PRDC, serological testing for agents involved in PRDC comprises a major part of the diagnostic testing carried out in swine-dense regions. In addition to the fact that multiple agents can be simultaneously involved in causing PRDC, agents like SIV and A. pleuropneumoniae have several subtypes or serotypes which are antigenically distinct (24, 37) . In theory, a comprehensive serological test panel for the differential diagnosis of PRDC should incorporate tests for several different pathogens. The tests of choice for each of these agents could potentially include several different assay formats, such as the enzymelinked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and the more laborious complement fixation tests, hemagglutination inhibition, and virus neutralization tests (18) . Therefore, multiplex testing platforms which can save labor, time, and cost by providing information about more than one pathogen from a single test run will be important as diagnostic tools of the future. While several multiplex tests have been developed for nucleic acidbased detection of pathogens (15, 29, 38) , very few multiplex tests are available for antibody detection, especially for veterinary use (1, 8, 21) .",

Up to 100 different analytes can be detected simultaneously with the Luminex xMap technology. Therefore, the primary advantages of this technology are its multiplexing and high-throughput capabilities. Other advantages include savings of cost, time, and labor and improved assay performance. Interest in the MBA technology as a versatile tool for clinical microbiology with both human and animal applications is widespread and increasing (1, 13, 21, 23, 34) . In this study, we have harnessed the MBA technology to develop a dual serological detection test for PCV2 and PRRSV (PCV2/PRRSV MBA), as a first step toward the development of a comprehensive multiplex test panel for PRDC.",

A slightly modified version is currently offered at the Iowa State University Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory (ISU-VDL). Briefly, 16 ng of PCV2 Orf2 and 5.2 ng of WT antigen/well are coated on adjacent wells of an Immunolon plate (Dynex, Chantilly, VA). A 1:100 dilution of test serum in blocking buffer consisting of 5% skim milk powder is incubated on the plates for 30 min, followed by the addition of anti-swine horseradish peroxidase conjugate at 1:2,500. After incubation with the substrate and stopping of the reaction with 0.1 N H 2 SO 4 , plates are read at 450 nm. The corrected optical density (COD) value of each sample is derived by subtraction of the WT value from the orf2 value for the given sample. The COD value of each sample is divided by the COD value of the positive-control serum sample and expressed as a sample COD-topositive-control COD (S/P) ratio. A cutoff value of 0.3 was used to distinguish between positive and negative samples. For the purposes of this study, samples with values between 0.2 and 0.3 were classified as suspect. As described by Nawagitgul et al. (27) , the assay had a sensitivity of 91% and a specificity of 93%.",

Seventy-two PCV2-, PRRSV-, and SIV-free pigs were randomly assigned to four groups. Group 1 piglets (n \u03ed 12) served as uninfected controls; group 2 piglets (n \u03ed 24) were divided into two subgroups. Each pig in one subgroup of 12 piglets was inoculated with 10 4.5 50% tissue culture infective doses (TCID 50 ) of the PCV2 wild-type virus strain 40895 (6) stock (3 ml intranasally and 2 ml intramuscularly), while the 12 pigs in the other subgroup were administered a mutant virus which had an altered interferon-stimulated response element (ISRE) in its genome (32) . We have previously shown that the mutant virus and wild-type PCV2 are antigenically indistinguishable by the \"gold standard\" PCV2 ELISA (33) . Therefore, no distinction is made between the two viruses for the purpose of validation of the PCV2/PRRSV MBA in this study. Data from animals infected with either the wild-type virus or the mutant PCV2 have been combined for analysis. Group 3 piglets (n \u03ed 12) were inoculated intranasally with 10 6.0 TCID 50 of PRRSV strain VR2385 stock; group 4 pigs (n \u03ed 24) were coinfected with both PCV2 and PRRSV as described for groups 2 and 3. At 14 days postinfection (dpi), 6 pigs from groups 1 and 3 and 12 pigs each from the remaining groups were killed. All pigs were euthanized at 28 dpi. Sera which were collected just prior to infection at 1 dpi and weekly thereafter were used to validate and optimize the PCV2/PRRSV MBA.",

Bead counts were verified on a hemocytometer. A total of 2,500 beads/well/antigen were used for all assays. The microbead assay was carried out as described previously, with modifications (1, 8, 34) . The 96-well filter plates (Millipore, Billerica, MA) were blocked with PBN buffer (phosphate-buffered saline [PBS], pH 7.4, with 1% bovine serum albumin) for 2 min. Test sera were diluted 1:100 in PBN buffer and added to the filter plate. A total of 2,500 coupled beads for each of the three antigens used in the study were added to the wells. The plate was incubated at room temperature for 30 min, followed by three washes with PBS-Tween (PBS-T) using a vacuum manifold. Biotin-labeled anti-swine IgG H&L chain (Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories, San Diego, CA) was added at 1:2,500, and the plate was incubated at room temperature for 30 min. Plates were washed three times with PBS-T. Fifty microliters of streptavidin conjugated with Rhodophyta phycoerythrin (Invitrogen, Valencia, CA) at a 1:100 dilution in PBN buffer was added for 30 min. The plate was again washed twice in a vacuum manifold. The beads were resuspended in 125 l of PBN buffer. Seventy-five microliters of the resuspended beads was transferred to a clear U-bottom plate (Thermo Scientific, Worcester, MA). Plates were read in the Luminex 100 instrument using Bioplex (version 5.0) software (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). The median fluorescence intensity unit (MFU) for each of the three antigen-coupled beads in the wells was the median value for a count of 100 beads detected by the dual-flow laser cytometer (1, 8, 34) . PCV2/PRRSV MBA data for the experimental samples used in this study are presented as the average of the MFU values for each treatment group. Therefore, they are denoted the average fluorescence intensity (AFU) value (see Fig. 1 and Table 2 ). A panel of seven selected serum samples was used as a control in all assays ( Table 1) .",

Two of the seven controls were created by pooling to demonstrate that detection was not affected by either dilution of the positives or the presence of antibodies to more than one analyte. The samples were assessed in duplicate over eight different runs. Analytical specificity was evaluated as cross-reactivity between PCV2, PRRSV, and SIV. Intra-assay variation was measured by testing selected negative, low-positive, and high-positive sera in duplicate in different locations on the same plate. The coefficient of variation (COV) between readings for each sample was calculated as a measure of assay variation (11, 12) . Statistical analysis. For the experimental samples, the correlation between the standard ELISAs and the PCV2/PRRSV MBA was assessed by using Spearman's correlation coefficient. To determine whether multiplexing interfered with detection of either analyte, the effect of the presence of PRRSV antibodies on MBA detection of PCV2 antibodies and vice versa was assessed by the Wilcoxon two-sample rank-sum test. For field samples, receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis (9-11) was carried out for each analyte using the ELISA as the standard test to determine the positive and negative status of a sample. Sensitivity-and specificity-controlled positive, negative, and suspect cutoff values were selected on the basis of the ROC analysis. Positive predictive values, negative predictive values, sensitivities, and specificities were calculated at the selected cutoff values.

The diagnostic sensitivity and specificity were 93% and 91%, respectively, for the PRRSV MBA. On the basis of optimal sensitivity and specificity values, the positive/negative cutoff values were selected to be 400 MFU for PCV2 and 7,000 MFU for PRRSV.

            "text": "Unlike human medicine, the detection of antibodies to multiple pathogens from a single test is of particular value in veterinary medicine, where herd health monitoring relies on statistics-based sampling of a small proportion of the total population to minimize cost. Rarely are entire swine herds screened to monitor for selected pathogens (26) . Multiplex serology may also be of special value to determine the optimal on March 19, 2020 by guest http://jcm.asm.org/ timing of multivalent vaccine administration after waning of a maternal antibody response and to monitor the duration of vaccinal immunity (16, 35) . Multiplex serology plays an important role in clinical differential diagnosis and does so more for economically important swine diseases where multiple antigenic subtypes or serotypes are involved, e.g., SIV infection, leptospirosis, and A. pleuropneumoniae infection (24) . To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to describe an advanced multiplex antibody detection assay for economically important swine viruses. The performance of our PCV2/PRRSV MBA was similar to that of the gold standard ELISAs in sensitivity of detection of both PCV2 and PRRSV in sera with experimentally generated viral infections. However, at later time points, where the magnitude of the antibody response is higher, there were differences in the patterns of detection between the standard tests and the PCV2/PRRSV MBA. These findings indicate that the dynamic ranges of the two assays differed at the higher end. However, this difference was not statistically significant, based on Spearman's correlation coefficient values of 0.72 and 0.80 for PCV2 and PRRSV, respectively. Since the diagnostic value of serological testing is primarily to differentiate negative and positive, the practical utility of the PCV2/PRRSV MBA was comparable to that of the standard tests. In situations where the strength of the antibody response is important, a titration curve can be utilized. The PCV2 ELISA rather than the animal's presumed true-positive status based on experimental infection was used as the standard for the analysis of experimental samples because the true status of the animal at between 7 dpi and 14 dpi, when seroconversion occurs, is variable until the titers are high enough for the animal to become clearly positive. As the standard ELISA cutoffs have already been validated to accommodate such samples in the gray zone (27) , the PCV2/PRRSV MBA was validated by comparison to the standard ELISA and not the presumed true-positive status of the animal.",

The PRRSV MBA had a kappa statistic value of 0.67, which indicated good agreement with the standard test. The negative predictive value for the test was 73% and the accuracy was 82%. The standard PRRSV ELISA is a categorical test that classifies samples as either positive or negative and has no assigned suspect range. The relatively high cutoff value of 0.4 was probably selected to avoid unexpected positive reactions (3, 7, 17, 30) . However, having a relatively high cutoff value would lead to suspect samples being classified negative by the commercial kit, thus explaining the less than desirable negative predictive value for the MBA and the excellent agreement of the PRRSV ELISA and MBA on classification of positive samples. Moreover, the N-protein antigen used in this study was derived from North American PRRSV strain VR2332. It is known that the N proteins of the American and European-like PRRSV isolates share only about 65% identity and have some dissimilar epitopes (5, 25) . Therefore, future plans to incorporate the N protein derived from a type I PRRSV isolate into the PCV2/ PRRSV MBA might improve the sensitivity and assay performance for field samples where antibodies to both strains may be present. Similarly, taking into account the emergence of PCV type 2b in U.S. swine populations, addition of the PCV2b capsid protein to the assay may improve the umbrella of detection (2, 31) . The nsp7 protein of PRRSV has been reported to be successful in distinguishing unexpected positive samples (4) . To improve the sensitivity and specificity of detection by the PCV2/PRRSV MBA, we tested the PRRSV nsp2p protein's ability to distinguish the unexpected false-positive samples. However, no clear differential recognition patterns were obvious (unpublished data).",

The specificity was plotted against sensitivity for the PCV2/PRRSV MBA at multiple AFU values. The working assay cutoffs were selected by comparison of the best sensitivity and specificity values of multiple AFUs. The area under the curve, which is a measure of the diagnostic accuracy of the test (12), was acceptable for both the PRRSV and PCV2 MBAs at values of 0.97 and 0.92, respectively. While the negative predictive value of the PRRSV MBA could have been improved by lowering the cutoff value of 7,000 AFU, the selected cutoff was preferred to retain specificity even at the cost of sensitivity. Although the commercial PRRSV ELISA does not have a suspect range, to avoid any possible error in classifying samples positive or negative, a suspect range was selected for the PCV2/PRRSV MBA.
