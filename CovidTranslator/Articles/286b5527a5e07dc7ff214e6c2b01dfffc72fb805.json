If the fluid is diluted with neutral buffer (mimicking virus uptake with seawater) particles were more resistant. Virions containing an uncleaved HA were even activated suggesting that gastric juice contains a trypsin-like protease. Undiluted intestinal fluid inactivated particles and destroyed HA, but diluted fluid activated virions. A virus isolated from the duck\u00b4s intestine is more tolerant against intestinal fluid compared to fowl plague virus suggesting that the former is better adapted to grow in the intestine. We also demonstrate that influenza viruses replicate to high titers in a novel chicken epithelial gut cell line. While viruses with a monobasic HA cleavage site require addition of trypsin, these cells effectively process HA with a polybasic cleavage site, which could be blocked with an inhibitor of the cellular furin protease.",

HA facilitates attachment of the virus particles to sialic-acid containing receptors and catalyzes the subsequent fusion of viral and cellular membranes. This process is well characterized and mediated by conformational changes triggered by exposure to mildly acidic pH. In order to do so, HA must be cleaved into the N-terminal HA 1 subunit, which carries the receptor binding site and the antigenic epitopes, and the C-terminal HA 2 subunit which anchors the protein to the membrane and also contains another hydrophobic sequence. This fusion peptide is instrumental for membrane fusion since it is exposed at the molecule's surface and inserts into the cellular membrane after triggering by low pH (Skehel and Wiley, 2000) .",

Low pathogenic avian viruses and non-avian influenza viruses possess a single arginine residue, whereas highly pathogenic H5 and H7 viruses contain several basic amino acids at the cleavage site. The expression of a suitable cellular enzyme determines whether infectious viruses are released by a certain cell type. A polybasic motif is recognized by ubiquitous proteases, such as furin and PC5/PC6 (Stieneke-Grober et al., 1992) , and infection with a virus having an HA with a polybasic cleavage site leads to systemic infections. In contrast, HA with a monobasic cleavage site is processed by proteases present only in epithelial cells and hence viral replication is locally restricted. Several of these enzymes have now been identified in respiratory epithelia of humans, cattle and swine (Bottcher-Friebertshauser et al., 2013) . However, essentially nothing is known about whether epithelial cells of the avian gut release infectious virus particles and cleave HA with a monobasic and/or polybasic cleavage site, which is mainly due to the lack of a suitable cell culture system.",

Other proteolytic enzymes, such as chymotrypsin, also process HA into HA 1 and HA 2 (Klenk et al., 1977; Lazarowitz and Choppin, 1975 ), but at a site within the fusion peptide and hence virus infectivity is not activated (Garten et al., 1981) .

After passage through the crop, an enlarged part of the esophagus, which has a slightly acidic pH (5.5-6.0) and thus might already inactivate virus particles, ingested material is delivered to the bipartite stomach. The first part is the proventriculus, a rod-shaped tube, that secrets hydrochloric acid and pepsinogen. The low pH of 2 autocatalytically activates pepsinogen to generate pepsin, a protease with an acidic pH optimum. The second part of the stomach, the more voluminous gizzard (ventriculus) contains several layers of muscles and can grind the food with previously swallowed stones and pass it back to the proventriculus, and vice versa. The average pH of the gizzard content is \u223c3.5, but (depending on the diet) measurements vary between 1.6 and 4.4 (Beasley et al., 2015; Svihus, 2011) . The retention time of food in the proventriculus and gizzard has been estimated to be between 30 min and two hours before the content is released into the small intestine. In the duodenum the milieu changes, the pH is neutralized to \u223c6.5, which inactivates pepsin. Instead, the proteases trypsin and chymotrypsin (among many other enzymes) are secreted by the pancreas and released into the duodenum (Pubols, 1990) . After passage through the small and large intestine, the feces leave birds through the cloaca, the posterior orifice that serves as the only opening for the digestive, reproductive, and urinary tract.",

To determine their effect on infectivity of an avian influenza virus, we first used the fowl plaque virus (A/FPV/Rostock/34, (H7N1)) M1 mutant, which contains a deletion of three and an exchange of one basic amino acid(s) in the polybasic cleavage site of HA, i.e. PSKKRKKR is mutated to PSKGR. Unlike FPV with a polybasic cleavage site, FPV M1 shows low pathogenicity in chicken and requires trypsin for growth in cell culture (Wagner et al., 2013) . For the following experiments, we concentrated FPV M1 by ultracentrifugation from the supernatant of cells, which were infected at a high MOI and incubated for \u223c12 h in the absence of trypsin. Western blotting with HA 2 specific antisera showed that the virus preparations contained mainly uncleaved HA 0 and plaque assays revealed a titer of \u223c8 \u00d7 10 5 pfu/ml. After incubation with a low concentration of trypsin, HA was completely cleaved and virus titers increased to 5 \u00d7 10 8 pfu/ml, i.e. around 600 fold (Fig. 1a) , which is in agreement with published studies (Klenk et al., 1975; Lazarowitz and Choppin, 1975) .",

It is well documented that influenza viruses containing a cleaved HA are inactivated at slightly acidic pH between 5.2 and 6. This acid treatment triggers HA to undergo an irreversible conformational change that catalyzes membrane fusion (Mair et al., 2013; Russier et al., 2016) . Since uncleaved HA is not able to perform this conformational change we asked whether it is more stable under acidic conditions. 5 \u00d7 10 6 infectious particles of FPV M1 were incubated with buffer adjusted to a pH between 3 and 7. No plaques were detected after incubation at pH 3 and pH 4. At pH 5, infectivity was greatly reduced by 90% to 5 \u00d7 10 5 pfu, but was only marginally affected at pH 6 ( Fig. 1b) . Thus, virus particles with uncleaved HA are more stable as particles harboring a cleaved HA, as described before (Scholtissek, 1985) , but are (almost) completely inactivated at the pH of the chicken gizzard.",

Instead, various bands with the size of HA 2 (and smaller) appear that are highly similar to the bands obtained by trypsin-treatment. A possible explanation would be that pepsin, the main protease of the gizzard, which has a pH optimum at \u223c2 but becomes inactive at pH 5, does not digest if the fluid is diluted with neutral buffer. Instead, another unknown trypsin-like protease with a more neutral pH optimum activates HA.",

We used a recently established and to our knowledge the only available chicken enterocyte cell line (Witek, 2013) . The avian origin and the epithelial phenotype were confirmed using marker-specific antibodies against catenin (data not shown) and E-cadherin, villin and cytokeratin (W. Rudy, MicroMol, personal communication). To investigate virus growth, the CHIC 8E11 cells were infected at a low MOI (0.00005) with FPV M1 in the absence or presence of trypsin and HA-and plaque-titers were determined A. The avian influenza fowl plague virus M1 containing HA with a monobasic cleavage site was grown in the absence of trypsin and pelleted from cell culture supernatants. 10 \u03bcl of the preparation was incubated for 20 min with 60 \u03bcl of gizzard fluid serially diluted with buffer adjusted to pH 3.5 and then activated with trypsin (2 \u03bcg/ml). Viral titers were determined with a plaque assay. C1: 10 \u03bcl virus activated with trypsin. C2: 10 \u03bcl of the virus preparation without trypsin treatment. The mean of three different incubations including standard deviation is shown. B. 10 \u03bcl of the virus preparation was incubated for 20 min with buffer adjusted to pH values between 3 and 7 and the plaque titer was determined. C. Aliquots of the samples from A were subjected to SDS-PAGE and western blot using antisera against the HA 2 subunit. Controls: virus particles with cleaved (C1) and uncleaved HA (C2) as size marker for the SDS-PAGE mobility of HA0 and HA 2 , respectively. Numbers indicate the size (kDa) of molecular weight markers. D. FPV M1 was incubated with gizzard fluid serially diluted with buffer adjusted to pH 3.5 and in the absence (\u2212) or presence (+) of BSA (1 \u03bcg/\u03bcl) for 20 min. Samples were then subjected to SDS-PAGE and western blot using antisera against the HA 2 subunit. C: virus particles with partially cleaved HA as size marker for the SDS-PAGE mobility of HA0 and HA 2 . No virus infectivity was detected if an aliquot of each sample was analyzed in the plaque assay. Fig. 3. left part) . In the absence of trypsin, neither hemagglutinating nor infectious viruses were detected in the supernatant, but in the presence of trypsin FPV M1 grows to high titers (\u223c10 7 pfu/ml), very similar to their growth in MDCK II cells, a standard cell line to produce virus particles. A similar growth curve was obtained for A/duck/Bavaria/1977 (data not shown). Human influenza viruses are (often) not able to replicate in the intestine of ducks if infected orally (Kida et al., 1980; Webster et al., 1978) , a genetic trait which has been linked to the neuraminidase gene (Fujimoto et al., 2016; Hinshaw et al., 1983; Kobasa et al., 2001) . However, the 8E11 cells support replication of the human lab strain WSN (H1N1) to similar titers as FPV M1 and as in MDCK II cells (although somewhat slower), but only if trypsin is present in the medium (Fig. 3, right part) .",

With exogenous trypsin HA is almost completely cleaved into the HA 2 subunit, whereas in its absence HA remains predominantly uncleaved (Fig. 4A ). The small amount of an HA 2 band that runs below the major HA 2 band generated by trypsin is probably functional, since virus grown in the absence of trypsin exhibits low infectivity (2 \u00d7 10 4 ), which is activated \u223c100-fold by trypsin treatment (2 \u00d7 10 6 ).

Only at a dilution of 1:1000 the virus preparation with an uncleaved HA was activated \u223c10fold, i.e. an increase in virus titer from 2.8 \u00d7 10 4 to 2.3 \u00d7 10 5 was observed (Fig. 4B ). Since trypsin treatment (2 \u03bcg/ml) caused an increase in viral titers to 5.1 \u00d7 10 6 it can be calculated that \u223c5% of potentially infective virus particles were activated by the gut fluid. Western blotting showed that only a small fraction of HA 0 was processed into functional HA 2 and most bands detected by the antiserum had a higher molecular weight suggesting HA cleavage at amino acids other than the authentic cleavage site. The same two HA degradation products prevail in less diluted gut fluid whereas undiluted fluid almost completely degraded HA (Fig. 5B, left) . Since the pattern of HA bands is different from that obtained with viruses incubated with high concentrations of trypsin it indicates that other enzymes, such as chymotrypsin, also digest the virus particles. This increasing degradation of HA is reflected by a decrease of the virus titers. At a dilution of 1:100 no virus particles were activated, i.e. the virus titer is slightly lower (1.4 \u00d7 10 4 ) compared to samples not treated with trypsin (2.8 \u00d7 10 4 ). At lower dilutions of gut fluid the residual viral infectivity is further diminished; after incubation with undiluted gut fluid 95% of virus particles are inactivated. However, in contrast to experiments with the gizzard fluid about 2000 virus particles remained infectious after A. 8E11 cells were infected at an MOI of 1 with FPV M1 containing HA with a monobasic cleavage site and incubated in the absence (-) or presence (+) of trypsin (2 \u03bcg/ml) for 12 h.

Gizzard fluid completely inactivates 5 \u00d7 10 6 infectious particles of a mutant of fowl plague virus (FPV) harboring a HA with a monobasic cleavage site, even if the gizzard fluid is highly diluted at acidic pH. The same was observed for a virus originally isolated from cloacal swabs of a duck. This is due to the low pH of the gizzard (pH 3.5), since at pH 4 the same amount of virus is also (almost) completely inactivated. In addition, HA (and probably other viral proteins) are most likely degraded by the protease pepsin even if samples were supplemented with additional protein (Fig. 1) These inactivation experiments are compatible with recent studies about survival of two human enveloped viruses in juices from the gastrointestinal tract. Hantavirus (titer 5 \u00d7 10 5 ) is completely inactivated after incubation for 15 min with human gastric juice adjusted to pH 1 or pH 3. Juice adjusted to pH 4 or pH 5 inactivated 99% and 90%, respectively of infectious particles (Witkowski et al., 2017) . Likewise, MERS-coronavirus (titer 7.5 \u00d7 10 6 ) is completely inactivated after an incubation for 30 min in fasted state simulated gastric fluid (pH 1.6, containing pepsin), but stable in a solution simulating the gastric fluid after food uptake (pH 5, but no pepsin) (Zhou et al., 2017) . Taken together, enveloped viruses are apparently rapidly and quantitatively inactivated at a pH below 5. In contrast, non-enveloped viruses known to be transmitted by the fecal-oral route, such as rotaviruses are completely stable at pH 4, partly and slowly inactivated at pH 3 and only at pH 2 rapidly and completely lose their infectivity (Weiss and Clark, 1985) .",

Both koilin and the mucus probably represent a mechanical and biochemical barrier for infection of underlying epithelial cells. However, gizzard pathology has been observed in infections mainly with bacteria and fungi, but also with (non-enveloped and thus more resistant) adenoviruses (Gjevre et al., 2013) . As for influenza infections, a recent report describes that a co-infection with H9N2 virus potentially exacerbates gizzard ulceration induced by feed-borne Bacilus cereus contamination, but the virus alone does not cause gizzard damage (Zhang et al., 2019) .

In principle, this can be achieved by the digestive enzyme trypsin present in the gut fluid, which activates virus particles with uncleaved HA even at concentrations 100-fold higher (2000 \u03bcg/ml) than usually used in multiple cycle growth experiments, although some degradation of the HA 2 band is observed under those conditions (Fig. 5a) . Indeed, viruses are activated by the gut fluid, but a remarkable difference exists between the viruses isolated from a chicken (FPV) and from cloacal swabs of a duck (A/duck/77). Both are slightly inactivated by undiluted gut fluid, but the duck virus is already activated at a dilution of 1:10, whereas FPV M1 requires a dilution of 1:1000 for the same effect (Fig. 5) .

            "text": "However, it remains to be shown whether such a conclusion can be generalized and more viruses isolated from ducks or other water birds needs to be analyzed and compared with viruses isolated from chicken. This might allow identifying molecular markers on viral proteins that confer better adaption to grow in the avian intestine. These observations raise the question whether (and how) viruses survive the passage through the gastrointestinal tract, if they are transmitted between birds via the fecal-oral route, as it is generally assumed (Webster et al., A. FPV M1 was incubated with the indicated concentration of trypsin (2 \u03bcg/ml) for 20 min. Aliquots of samples were then subjected to SDS-PAGE and western blot using antisera against the HA 2 subunit (left part) or to plaque assays (right part). B. FPV M1 was incubated with serial dilutions of gut fluid for 20 min. Aliquots of samples were then subjected to SDS-PAGE and western blot using antisera against the HA 2 subunit or to plaque assay. Controls: virus particles with uncleaved (C1) and cleaved HA (C2). C. FPV M1 was incubated with serial dilutions of gut fluid for 20 min without (-) or with (+) additional BSA (1 \u03bcg/\u03bcl). Aliquots of samples were then subjected to SDS-PAGE and western blot using antisera against the HA 2 subunit or to plaque assay. Controls: virus particles with partially cleaved HA (C), uncleaved (C1) and cleaved HA (C2). Results of plaque assays are shown as the mean including standard deviation of three experiments. D. A/duck/77 was incubated with serial dilutions of gut fluid for 20 min. Samples were then subjected to plaque assay. C1: 10 \u03bcl of the preparation not treated with trypsin. C2: 10 \u03bcl virus activated with trypsin. The mean of three different incubations including standard deviation is shown for all plaque assays. X. Han, et al. Veterinary Microbiology 239 (2019) 108462 1992). We found only a few studies were chickens or ducks have been experimentally infected only via the oral route (Fujimoto et al., 2016; Hatta et al., 2002; Hinshaw et al., 1983; Kida et al., 1980; Kobasa et al., 2001; Webster et al., 1978) . Usually, high doses of virus are required, indicating that this mode of infection is not very effective. Most experimental studies inoculated viruses via the upper respiratory tract, by aerosol, intravenously or by a combination of inoculation routes such that virus passage through the gizzard is not required to reach the intestine. On the other hand, it has been shown that avian viruses can replicate in cells of the intestine since viral antigen has been detected in the epithelium of the cloacal bursa and the small intestine of mallards and ducks experimentally infected with LPAIV (Kida et al., 1980; Kuiken, 2013; Slemons and Easterday, 1977) . In addition, viral RNA and infectious particles are routinely recovered from cloacal swabs of both chicken and ducks and virus is present in feces where it is stable for days or weeks, depending on the temperature (Hinshaw et al., 1979; Webster et al., 1978) . Several recent reports pointed out that LPAIV may spread systemically in chicken. After intranasal or intratracheal infection with various LPAIV of subtypes H5, H7 and H9 viral RNA was found by RT-PCR in a broad range of tissues beyond the respiratory and gastrointestinal tract and H7N7 virus could be isolated from several tissues (Post et al., 2012 (Post et al., , 2013 . Thus, one might speculate that systemic, but asymptomatic infection of LPAIV might occur more often than previously anticipated. This would allow viruses to bypass the stomach and duodenum after oral ingestion, using the blood stream and enter epithelial cells in distal parts of the digestive tract via the basolateral membrane. Here they replicate and are released from the apical membrane into the lumen of the intestine. In distal parts of the intestine, the concentration of digestive enzymes is lower and hence virus particles are not degraded. Instead, viruses with uncleaved HA are processed by trypsin and infectious virus particles are then released via the cloaca. Alternatively, viruses might enter the body from the seawater via the cloaca, replicate in the distal parts of the intestine and again are excreted by feces, as previously suggested (Scholtissek, 1985) . Since methods to label influenza virus proteins with fluorophores are now available (Fukuyama et al., 2015; Vahey and Fletcher, 2019) the hypothesis is now amenable to experimental verification by following expression of viral proteins in various tissues and cells after oral infection of birds.",

One important condition is that the acidic pH of the gizzard needs to be neutralized, which happens if viruses are swallowed together with water. This also inactivates pepsin; its enzymatic activity would otherwise degrade virus particles. Moreover, neutralization uncovers a trypsinlike protease that activates influenza viruses with an uncleaved HA. Chicken epithelial cells in the intestine are not able to process HA with a monobasic cleavage site, but the intestinal fluid is able to activate the virus, at least if diluted. A remarkable difference exists in this regard between the chicken virus FPV M1 and the duck virus A/duck/Bavaria/ 77. While FPV M1 requires a high dilution of 1:1000 to be activated, lower dilutions inactivate the virus and degrade HA In contrast; the duck derived virus is already activated at a dilution of 1:10. ",
