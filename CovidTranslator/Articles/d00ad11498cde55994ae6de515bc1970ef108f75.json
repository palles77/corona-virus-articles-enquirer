LSECs do not simply form a barrier within the hepatic sinusoids but have vital physiological and immunological functions, including filtration, endocytosis, antigen presentation and leukocyte recruitment. Reflecting these multifunctional properties, LSECs display unique structural and phenotypic features that differentiate them from the capillary endothelium present within other organs. It is now clear that LSECs have a critical role in maintaining immune homeostasis within the liver and in mediating the immune response during acute and chronic liver injury. In this Review , we outline how LSECs influence the immune microenvironment within the liver and discuss their contribution to immune-mediated liver diseases and the complications of fibrosis and carcinogenesis.",

Studies of these cells isolated from animals usually refer to them as liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs), whereas isolated human cells have also been referred to as human hepatic sinusoidal endothelial cells (HSECs). For the purpose of this Review, we use the term LSEC. The exposure of these sinusoidal endothelial cells to blood originating from both the gut and the systemic circulation means they are ideally situated to remove and recycle bloodborne proteins and lipids. In combination with Kupffer cells (KCs; liver-resident macrophages), LSECs constitute the most powerful scavenger system in the body 1 . This activity is facilitated by the presence of fenestrae in LSECs, their lack of a classical basement membrane and their expression of promiscuous scavenger receptors combined with the most potent endocytic capacity in the body 2 . Thus, virus particles 3 , advanced glycation end products 4 and modified LDL cholesterol 5 can be cleared from the circulation within minutes by this route.",

However, extensive variations in phenotype and function arise as a consequence of local microenvironmental signals dependent on anatomical localization 6 . The vascular architecture in the human liver is acquired by 17-25 weeks of gestation, but different vessels within the liver have distinct embryonic origins. Thus, portal vessels are derived from vitelline veins, whereas sinusoids develop from capillary vessels of the septum transversum and acquire their distinctive fenestrated phenotype by week 20 of gestation 7 under the control of transcription factor GATA4 (reF. 8 ). From this point onward, sinusoidal endothelial cells remain functionally and phenotypically distinct from the other vascular endothelial cells in the liver microenvironment and assume a phenotype that has many similarities with lymphatic endothelial cells 9 . The unique characteristics of LSECs are presented in Box 1. Both lymphatic and sinusoidal endothelial cells have minimal basement membranes and loosely organized cell junctions 10 and share a complement of receptors such as lymphatic vessel endothelial hyaluronic acid receptor (LYVE1) 11 , prospero homeobox protein 1 (PROX1) 12 , podoplanin 13 and liver/lymph node-specific ICAM3-grabbing non-integrin (LSIGN; also known as CLEC4M) 14 . It has been shown that the phenotype of sinusoidal endothelial cells varies across the liver acinus; a study of human liver tissue published in 2017 demonstrated that zone 1 LSECs are CD36 hi and LYVE1 low , whereas zone 2 and zone 3 LSECs are CD36 low , LYVE1 hi and CD32 hi (reF. 15 ). The presence of fenestrations or membranous pores organized into sieve plates is a feature that also distinguishes LSECs from the other hepatic endothelial populations 2 .",

However, unlike other fenestrated endothelial populations such as those in the kidney, hepatic Liver sinusoidal endothelial cells -gatekeepers of hepatic immunity fenestrations lack a diaphragm or basal lamina and are grouped into organized sieve plates, rendering LSECs highly permeable (Fig. 1d ). Many studies have implicated vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) as an essential factor for regulation of fenestrations 21 , but dynamic changes in hepatic fenestration number and size can occur rapidly in response to agents such as alcohol 22 , diet ary constituents 23 and fasting 24 or calorie restriction 25 . The fenestrations act as a 'dynamic filter' (reF. 26 ) to permit the access of macromolecules to parenchymal cells, and in addition, these pores might allow circulating viruses to gain access to hepatocytes 27 . Evidence from animal studies suggests that fenestrations can constitute up to 40% of the cell and that the size, distribution and clustering of the pores in sieve plates varies with the zonal distribution of the endothelium 28 and across the endothelial surface. Up to one-third of these pores are organized into complex labyrinths, and many are associated with components of microtubules 29 , caveoli and coated pits to form a transport network that could impose additional regulation on the traffic of material into the cells 30 , enabling them to govern the movement of materials to and from the liver parenchyma.",

Pattern recognition receptors are highly evolutionarily conserved and include the Toll-like receptor (TLR) family and the scavenger receptors 31 . An example of how the liver regulates inflammatory and immune responses is seen in the recognition of the TLR4 ligand lipopolysaccharide (LPS) by KCs and LSECs. Chronic exposure of both KCs and LSECs to LPS leads to an LPS-refractory state, and in LSECs specifically, LPS exposure is associated with reduced nuclear translocation of nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) and subsequent reduced leukocyte adhesion 32 . This mechanism prevents the liver from being in a constantly activated inflamed state in response to the constant exposure to bacterial products from the gut. Studies of other TLRs demonstrate that LSECs can respond to signals mediated via TLR1-TLR4, TLR6, TLR8 and TLR9, but their activation has cell-specific responses that are restricted compared with classical antigen-presenting cells, thereby contributing to an organ-specific response to antigens and the tolerogenic environment of the liver 33 .",

            "text": "A unique characteristic of LSECs is their expression of high levels of several scavenger receptors compared with conventional endothelium. Scavenger receptors are a diverse family of pattern recognition receptors that, like TLRs, are highly evolutionarily conserved 34 . In contrast to TLRs, they were believed to be functionally redundant and to perform silent uptake of ligands. However, gathering evidence suggests that this is not the case and that scavenger receptors have an important cell-specific role in immune responses 34 . They have been shown to promote potent pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory signalling as well as to directly interact with TLRs. Membrane-bound scavenger receptors recognize their extracellular ligands, which leads to internalization of the ligand, termed endocytosis, and trafficking from the cell membrane to intracellular compartments such as endosomes. The high levels of scavenger receptors on LSECs give them a high endocytic capacity. One of the most extensively studied scavenger receptors on LSECs is the mannose receptor (MR) 1, 35, 36 . Others include the homologous scavenger receptors stabilin 1 and stabilin 2 (reF. 37 ) and related molecules such as C-type lectins, including the type 2 receptor subclass dendritic cell-specific ICAM3-grabbing non-integrin (DCSIGN; also known as CD209) and LSIGN 14, 38 . The members of the C-type lectin group are involved in varied functions ranging from cell-cell interaction to uptake of serum glycoproteins. A third lectin with a similar structure to DCSIGN and LSIGN has been identified and designated the liver and lymph node sinusoidal endothelial cell C-type lectin (LSECTIN; also known as CLEC4G) 39 . This lectin has been shown to be co-expressed with LSIGN and is encoded in the same cluster of lectin-encoding genes as DCSIGN and LSIGN.",

In a mouse model of adenovirus infection, 90% of virus is found in LSECs and 10% is found in KCs within a minute of intravenous viral infusion 44 . A study published in 2017 reported that HIV-like particles are taken up by mouse LSECs at a rate of 100 million particles per minute 3 . After receptor-mediated endocytosis of circulating matrix breakdown products, the subsequent transit from early endosomes to late endosomes takes several hours 45 . The transit of viruses internalized by LSECs is less well understood. LSECs enable direct entry of certain viruses such as Ebola, whereas with other viruses, such as HCV and HBV, LSECs promote hepatotropism by facilitating parenchymal cell infection 46 . Rapid uptake of virus can also lead to redistribution to other cells, for instance, in animal models of HBV, viral particles are preferentially taken up by LSECs and subsequently passed on to infect underlying hepatocytes 47 . In the case of HCV, innate sensing of viral infection by LSECs leads to downstream signalling and release of paracrine signals such as the pro-viral molecule bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4), which increases viral infection of hepatocytes 48 . On the other hand, direct sensing of HCV RNA in LSECs also leads to the release of type I and type III interferon-rich exosomes that inhibit HCV replication 49 . The balance of such responses will determine whether virus infection is established or prevented, thereby emphasizing the critical role that LSECs play in hepatotropic viral infections.",

Knolle's group demonstrated that LSECs can cross-present antigen to CD8 + T cells 50 by using scavenger receptors, notably the mannose receptor, to take up, process and transfer antigen to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I (reF. 51 ). The presentation of antigen, including oral antigens, by LSECs drives a tolero genic response in naive CD8 + T cells that is mediated by upregulation on LSECs of the co-inhibitory molecule programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 (PDL1), which can activate its receptor programmed cell death protein 1 (PD1) on naive T cells 50, 52, 53 . Endocytosis of antigens by the mannose receptor on LSECs has been shown to promote CD8 + T cell tolerance 54 , including tolerance to tumour antigens 55 . However, it is crucial that rapid effector responses can be generated locally to harmful pathogens; consistently, LSEC-driven T cell activation changes in response to antigen load and local inflammatory factors. For example, in a culture model with mouse LSECs in which antigens at varying concentra tions were delivered to LSECs for cross presen tation to CD8 + T cells, high antigen concentrations led to a shift from tolerogenic to effector T cell differentiation 56 as a consequence of enhanced T cell receptor (TCR) signalling that overcame PD1-mediated tolerogenic responses. This response is also affected by local levels of IL-2. Furthermore, rapid activation of CD8 + T cells by LSECs occurs in the presence of IL-6 trans-signalling, and this activation not only drives rapid effector T cell differentiation but also primes T cells to respond to other inflammatory signals and leads to sustained effector responses 57 .",

In vivo studies have shown that these tolerogenic properties of LSECs can control autoimmunity. Circulating inflammatory CD4 + T cells (T helper 1 (T H 1) cells and T H 17 cells) were shown to interact repeatedly with liver sinusoidal endothelium, and this interaction successfully suppressed inflammatory cytokine release in mice 61 . The induction of autoantigen-specific T regulatory cells by LSECs was also shown to have important systemic effects by ameliorating damage in mouse models of autoimmune central nervous system disease 62, 63 . This finding has therapeutic implications for systemic as well as local immunity and has led to development of nanotechnology-based strategies to deliver autoantigen to LSECs as part of tolerance induction protocols 63 . C-type lectins also contribute to the unique ability of LSECs to control T cell differentiation. Thus, LSECTIN on LSECs inhibits T cell activation and effector functions through its interaction with CD44 on activated T cells 64 .",

They can also present chemokines derived from neighbouring or underlying cells to promote binding and migration of immune cell subsets www.nature.com/nrgastro flowing in the circulation to be captured by activated endothelial cells and then to migrate through the endothelium towards sites of infection or injury 66 . The cascade consists of sequential steps mediated by interactions between receptors on the surface of leukocytes and endothelial cells. The general paradigm applies to all vascular beds, but tissue-specific and inflammationspecific interactions provide powerful local regulation of where, when and which leukocytes are recruited. The steps in the cascade are broadly described as rolling or tethering, in which the leukocyte is captured from the circulation and induced to roll on the endothelial surface. In most vascular beds, this step is mediated by a family of receptors termed selectins, but other receptors are involved under specific circumstances, such as in the hepatic sinusoids 67 . Leukocyte rolling is followed by activation of leukocyte integrins in response to tissue-derived chemo attractant cytokines (chemokines) sequestered in the endothelial glycocalyx 68, 69 , which leads to firm adhesion mediated by integrins binding to immunoglobulin superfamily members on the endothelial surface. This adhesion is followed by intravascular crawling of the adherent leukocyte on the endothelium, which occurs before the final step of transmigration, in which the leukocyte migrates across the endothelium, through the post-endothelial tissue and into the liver parenchyma. The transmigration step is mediated by a complex series of receptor-ligand interactions, with cytoskeletal changes in both the endothelial cells and the leukocytes, and which enable the cell to cross the endothelium without disrupting the vascular barrier 70 . Cell recruitment to the liver has several features that are distinct from the general adhesion cascade (Fig. 3) . Recruitment of the majority of leukocytes occurs within the sinusoidal channels of the liver, in contrast to most other organs in which recruitment occurs within the post-capillary venules 71 . Furthermore, the recruitment of leukocytes subsets to the liver is regulated by specific combinations of typical and atypical adhesion molecules, reflecting the unique phenotype and structure of LSECs and the anatomy and rheology of the sinusoids (Box 1). The sinusoids are narrow, in some places, no wider than a flowing leukocyte, and characterized by low shear stress. These properties mean that the initial recruitment step does not require rolling and in most circumstances is selectin-independent. As a consequence, sinusoidal endothelium expresses minimal levels of selectins in vivo 71, 72 . A summary of the key adhesion factors is outlined in TaBle 1 .",

The conventional endothelial adhesion molecules that mediate firm adhesion of leukocytes, intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM1) and vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM1) 69, 73 , are expressed at high levels on inflamed LSECs 74 . Their role in lymphocyte recruitment to the liver has been confirmed in both in vitro and in vivo assays. VCAM1, which binds the \u03b14\u03b21 integrin expressed on lymphocytes, has an important role in capturing lymphocytes from blood flow and mediating stabilization 65, 75 . ICAM1 binds to \u03b1L\u03b22 integrin to support firm adhesion within the hepatic sinusoids 71 . Another family member is mucosal vascular addressin cell adhesion molecule 1 (MADCAM1), which binds to the \u03b14\u03b27 integrin and plays a major part in lympho cyte homing to the gut via mucosal vessels 76 . Our group demonstrated that this receptor was also upregulated in the liver in some chronic liver diseases, in which it promotes the recruitment of T cells activated in the gut that express high levels of \u03b14\u03b27 integrin , thereby contributing to the link between IBD and inflammatory liver disease 77, 78 . Although many of these immunoglobulin superfamily members are regulated by pro-inflammatory cytokines, their adhesive function is also dependent on the formation of cell surface platforms regulated by the tetra spanin family of receptors, which form microdomains and associate laterally with ICAM1 and VCAM1 (reFs 79, 80 ). For example, our group confirmed that CD151 associates with VCAM1 on LSECs and regulates lymphocyte adhesion under shear stress 81 .",

VAP1 has unique properties generated by its enzyme activity that can upregulate expression of adhesion molecules and chemokines in LSECs, thereby amplifying leukocyte recruitment [84] [85] [86] [87] . The scavenger receptor family of endothelial receptors also contributes to leukocyte recruitment to the liver. Stabilin 2 was shown to regulate lymphocyte adhesion to LSECs via the \u03b1M\u03b22 integrin (reF. 88 ), and its homologue, stabilin 1, was originally shown to mediate recruitment across lympha tic endothelium 89 . Similarly, expression of stabilin 1 is upregulated in chronic liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma, in which it mediates transmigration of lymphocytes across LSECs under shear stress 90 . Following adherence, leukocytes crawl across the endothelial surface before undergoing transmigration, which usually occurs via endothelial junctions, termed the paracellular route 91, 92 . Several studies have demonstrated that lymphocyte interactions with LSECs within the sinusoids trigger important immune effector mechanisms 93, 94 , which might influence the infiltration and positioning of cells within the liver in inflammatory liver diseaes 74 . Thus, it is important to understand how the process of transendothelial migration through LSECs is regulated. Visualization of this process using confocal imaging of lymphocytes migrating across LSECs under shear stress demonstrated that ~50% of cells took a transcellular route of migration and migrated directly through the endothelial body 90 as opposed to the conventional paracellular route. This transcellular migration route involved the formation of ICAM1-rich channels to facilitate lymphocyte migration. Although transcellular migration has been noted in some other specialized endothelial beds, its function and molecular basis remain poorly understood 95 . Transendothelial migration is a multistep process involving different combinations of receptors that enables preferential recruitment of particular leukocyte subsets, as described in the following sections. An additional step in migration was described in 2016 in which lymphocytes migrate into LSECs and then crawl within the endothelial cell to the cell junction, through which they enter the adjacent endothelial cell 96 . This process, which we term intracellular crawling, is dependent on IFN\u03b3 and could not be detected when LSECs were stimulated by other interferon family cytokines. IFN\u03b3 treatment did alter the cytoskeleton of LSECs, which might promote intracellular crawling. This process was also facilitated by the unique junctional complexes between LSECs. The functional consequences of intracellular crawling are yet to be elucidated but could have an important role in lymphocyte positioning in liver tissue.",

In these conditions, chemokines seem to be compartmentalized to the sinusoidal vasculature and portal vessels and have a substantial influence on immune cell localization and subsequent disease progression 100, 101, 104 . T cell migration across sinusoidal endothelium is mediated by the interferon-inducible chemokines CXC-chemokine ligand 9 (CXCL9) and particularly CXCL10, which bind the receptor CXC-chemokine receptor 3 (CXCR3) 105, 106 . In other diseases, including chronic HCV infection, the chemokine CXCL16, which exists in a transmembrane form, is expressed on sinusoidal endothelium, hepatocytes and bile ducts, enabling it to regulate the recruitment and retention of CXCR6 + effector T cells within the liver 107, 108 . Subsets of natural killer (NK) and NK T cells express high levels of CXCR6 that enable them to interact with CXCL16 on sinusoidal endothelium; this interaction promotes active migration along the sinusoids as part of a process of ongoing immune surveillance and patrolling 109 . Studies in mouse liver endothelial cells have shown that a vital property of chemokine-mediated recruitment is the transcytosis of chemokines from the basolateral side to the luminal side of sinusoidal endothelial cells 110 . This process is clathrin-dependent and promotes the transendothelial migration of lymphocytes across LSECs, and inhibition of this pathway reduces CD4 + T cell recruitment during liver injury 111 .",

Subsequent signals determine where these cells localize within the liver, with CC-chemokine receptor 6 (CCR6) + T H 17 cells migrating towards their ligand, CC-chemokine ligand 20 (CCL20), which is secreted by bile ducts, whereas T reg cells respond to different chemokines as a consequence of their expression of CCR5, CCR4 and in some cases CCR10 (reFs 116, 117 ). T reg cells were also shown to use a distinct combination of adhesion receptors, involving stabilin 1, ICAM1 and VAP1, to migrate across human LSECs under flow 90 , whereas recruitment of CD8 + T cells to the mouse liver is primarily dependent on ICAM1 expression by LSECs with a lesser contribution from VCAM1 (reFs 118,119 ). In autoimmune hepatitis and primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) associated with IBD, LSECs present the chemokine CCL25, which can trigger CCR9 + gut-homing lymphocyte interactions with MADCAM1 to promote recruitment of mucosal T cells 103, 120 . These distinct mechanisms of migration across LSECs are probably influenced by epithelial responses to tissue injury 115, 121 , stromal signals 122 and cooperative interactions between several cell types in the sinusoid. For instance, in a model of HBV infection, effector CD8 + T cells were shown to arrest in the sinusoids by interacting with platelets adherent to the sinusoidal surface via hyaluronan-dependent mechanisms 94 . Subsequently, the CD8 + T cells crawled along the sinusoids, probing through the LSEC fenestrae for viral antigens presented by underlying hepatocytes. Antigen recognition as a consequence of this probing behaviour led to effector functions by a diapedesis-independent process. A human model of cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection of LSECs led to the recruitment of effector T cells and activated T reg cells in a lymphocyte function-associated antigen 3 (LFA3)-dependent mechanism 123 . In this study, CMV-infected human LSECs upregulated LFA3 at intercellular junctions, and during effector T cell recruitment, the interaction of LFA3 with its ligand, CD2, on T cells contributed to T H 1 cell activation.",

Neutrophils are one of the earliest immune cells to be recruited to a site of tissue injury, and they are also recruited into the liver via the hepatic sinusoids 125 . It was originally thought that their migration was mediated by simple physical trapping within the narrow sinusoidal channels, but work from McDonald et al. 126 implicated a complex multistep recruitment process involving interactions between sinusoidal hyaluronan and CD44 on the neutrophil surface. Whereas neutrophil interactions in post-sinusoidal venules followed a conventional rolling mediated by selectins and integrin-mediated adhesion, this was found not to be the case in the sinusoids, where the majority of neutrophil extravasation occurred. They found that hyaluronan was highly expressed in liver sinusoids and mediated the recruitment of neutrophils in response to LPS challenge. This interaction was dependent on hyaluronan binding to CD44 rather than to the other hyaluronan receptor, receptor for hyaluronanmediated motility (RHAMM; also known as HMMR). A study published in 2014 also highlighted the importance of TLRs for neutrophil recruitment. TLR2-protein S100A9 signalling in particular promoted the production of the chemokines CXCL1 and CXCL2, which are known to mediate neutrophil migration, by liver macrophages in acute and chronic mouse models of liver injury 127 .",

            "text": "Monocytes. In addition to the activation of resident KCs, monocytes and macrophages are also recruited to the liver from the circulation during inflammation or in response to injury. KCs are yolk sac-derived tissue macrophages found within the hepatic sinusoids; they are immobile and probe the environment with pseudopods 128 . The response to liver injury also includes an influx of monocytes, which have a major role in regulating inflammation, regeneration, repair and fibrosis 129 . Furthermore, acute liver injury is associated with an initial influx of transcription factor GATA6 + peritoneal macrophages that enter directly through the mesothelium in a process dependent on CD44 and the danger-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) molecule ATP 128 . This entry is followed by the recruitment of CCR2 + monocytes from www.nature.com/nrgastro the circulation 130 . The subsequent recruitment signals governing monocyte migration through the sinusoids are less well characterized, but several key factors have been determined. The dominant chemokine receptorligand interaction that mediates migration of CD16 + monocytes across LSECs is CX 3 C-chemokine receptor 1 (CX 3 CR1) binding to its ligand CX 3 C-chemokine ligand 1 (CX 3 CL1), one of the few transmembrane chemokines. Expression of CX 3 CL1 is restricted to bile ducts in the normal liver, yet this protein is expressed at high levels on inflamed sinusoidal endothelium 131 . In this study, VAP1 also contributed to adhesion and transendothelial migration of CD16 + monocytes across LSECs. The accumulation of CD14 + CD16 + monocytes has been reported in inflammatory liver disease, which is due in part to the preferential migration of this subset across LSECs compared with CD14 + CD16cells 132 . Monocytes are known to undergo a phenomenon of bidirectional movement across endothelium that involves a reverse migration step 133, 134 . This migratory behaviour has been confirmed in LSECs and might have a marked effect on the fate of monocytes and the outcome of liver injury because monocyte subsets which undergo reverse transmigration are predominantly pro-inflammatory CD16 + monocytes. By contrast, those remaining in the subendothelial space are anti-inflammatory monocytes that suppress T cells and promote endotoxin tolerance 135 .",

Despite poor understanding of the crosstalk between LSECs and KCs, the release of these mediators probably influences LSEC phenotype and activation and leads to subsequent leukocyte recruitment 138, 139 .

In chronic liver injury, microparticles are released from hepatocytes, leukocytes and LSECs and provide another route for cell-cell communication 145 . Paracrine factors released from hepatocytes influence the expression of adhesion molecules on overlying LSECs and can promote the recruitment of flowing lymphocytes from the sinusoids 121 .

This importance makes them and the molecules they express attractive therapeutic targets in inflammatory liver disease 147, 148 . VAP1 is a good example 149 , with studies confirming that both inhibition of its enzymatic activity or antibody blockade of its adhesive function reduce hepatic inflammation and fibrosis in mouse liver injury models 86 , and this work has led to a clinical trial of a humanized antibody against VAP1 that is currently underway (BUTEO; NCT02239211) in patients with PSC. Chemokines and adhesion molecules expressed by inflamed LSECs are also potential targets for anti-inflammatory therapy in liver disease. For example, patients with PBC have been treated with NI-0801, a humanized monoclonal antibody against CXCL10. Interestingly, the high production rate of CXCL10 by the inflamed liver made it difficult to achieve sustained neutralization of the chemokine in vivo despite evidence that the antibody could remove chemokine from the sinusoidal endothelial bed. Although the drug was well-tolerated and demonstrated immunological changes, the overall results were negative 150 . Thus, therapies directed at the chemokine receptors themselves might have merit, and evidence from early trials using the dual CCR2-CCR5 antagonist cenicriviroc in patients with NASH suggests that such treatment can induce a persistent blockade 151 .",

Nanoparticles loaded with autoantigen can be targeted to LSECs as a consequence of their potent scavenging capability; the ability of LSECs to take up molecules using their scavenger receptors is an excellent way of potentially targeting a range of therapies to the liver. Presentation of delivered autoantigens by LSECs to naive T cells results in the generation of autoantigen-specific regulatory T cells that can suppress systemic as well as local autoimmune responses. This strategy could be applied to a wide range of autoimmune and allergic conditions 63 . Targeting LSEC stabilin 1 and stabilin 2 with nanoparticle-based drugs 153 has been suggested as a way to deliver local treatment to manage a range of conditions including ischaemia-reperfusion injury (a specific type of injury that follows liver surgery and transplantation, which is a biphasic process involving hypoxia followed by restoration of blood flow and reoxygenation) and NAFLD. Similarly, blockade of LSECTIN or the related molecule LSIGN has been shown to reduce the metastasis of colon cancer cells to the liver via impairment of interactions with LSECs in mouse models 154, 155 .",

            "text": "During cirrhosis and chronic hepatitis, LSECs can undergo capillarization 156 . This process is associated with loss of GATA4-dependent signals 8 , upregulation of CD31 and VCAM1 and loss of fenestrations [156] [157] [158] . The number of fenestrations per endothelial cell not only decreases with disease 159-161 but also with ageing 162 , and this phenotypic change is governed by p19 ARF and p53-dependent signalling 163 . These changes might impede the transfer of materials to or from the parenchyma and contribute to regional hepatocyte hypoxia. Capillarization is mechanistically linked to the development of chronic inflammatory disease. In rodent models, it is associated with enhanced antigen presentation and cytotoxic T cell priming during fibrosis 148 , and in NASH, capillarization precedes and contributes to the transition from simple steatosis to steatohepatitis 157 . The changes that occur in LSECs in response to chronic inflammation also affect angiogenic pathways. Neo-angiogenesis is a key feature of chronic liver disease, and the majority of neo-vessels arise from portal vein branches and are closely associated with areas of fibrogenesis 164, 165 . A key initiating step is the capillarization of LSECs, which leads to increased hepatocyte hypoxia and subsequent release of pro-angiogenic factors 166, 167 . The LSEC response is context-specific; for example, acute injury can induce CXCR7 expression and a regenerative response, whereas chronic injury leads to CXCR4 induction, HSC proliferation and fibrogenesis 168 . During ischaemia-reperfusion injury, LSECs develop a pro-inflammatory, prothrombotic phenotype associated with vasoconstriction 169 . These changes have been directly linked to neutrophils because IL-33 released by LSECs during ischaemia-reperfusion injury triggers the release of neutrophil extracellular traps, which exacerbate acute hepatic injury 170 . In chronic injury, the changes in endothelial phenotype that accompany capillarization and precede fibrosis have been linked to alterations in signalling via the Hedgehog gene family 171 and lead to vasoconstriction and increased intrahepatic vascular resistance owing to reduced nitric oxide production by LSECs 172 . Tumour progression in hepatocellular carcinoma is associated with changes in the phenotype of peritumoural LSECs and increased production of angiogenic factors including IL-6 (reFs 173, 174 ).",

For example, pharmacological therapy in the form of a soluble guanylate cyclase activator, which restores fenestrations, has been linked to fibrosis regression in rodent models 21 and it might also be possible to use GATA4-mediated cellular reprogramming to restore the differentiated phenotype of LSECs and promote fibrosis resolution 8 . Similarly, therapies that restore normal Hedgehog signalling promote regression of capillarization and the reappearance of fenestrations, which suggests a potential pathway for reversal of fibrosis and the restoration of lipid transport 171 . However, studies testing cessation of VEGFbased cancer therapies also highlight how important the development of fenestrations can be in the context of metastasis and go some way in explaining the poor performance of some strategies using anti-VEGF drugs as cancer treatments. Withdrawal of anti-VEGF antibody therapy is associated with the development of hyperpolarized LSECs and promotion of hepatic metastasis 175 . Thus, low-dose, non-stop antiangiogenic therapy might present a future solution to minimize these effects.",

Their unique positioning, phenotype and function make them attractive candidates for organspecific therapy, and it is likely that more therapies targeting these cells will be tested in the future as new treatments to reduce liver injury and inflammation and to prevent or reverse fibrogenesis. In the absence of licenced antifibrotic therapies, strategies to maintain the differentiation of LSECs and to inhibit their ability to recruit harmful proinflammatory leukocytes through the selective orchestration of immune cell traffic might provide vital tools to halt the increase in mortality linked to chronic liver failure.",

Lymphocyte recruitment involves an adhesion cascade within the hepatic sinusoids that is influenced by the low shear environment and cellular crosstalk between parenchymal and non-parenchymal cells. Chronic parenchymal cell damage leads to the release of danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) and pro-inflammatory mediators by Kupffer cells, which increase adhesion molecule expression by liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) (step 1). Lymphocyte recruitment across activated LSECs involves a selectinindependent tethering step (step 2), followed by integrin activation and firm adhesion to immunoglobulin superfamily members on the LSEC surface (step 3). This process is influenced by paracrine factors released from hepatocytes. Lymphocytes then crawl along the luminal endothelium (step 4) until they receive a signal to transmigrate across LSECs through either a paracellular or a transcellular route (step 5). A third route of lymphocyte migration involves intracellular migration directly into the LSEC body and then migration to the adjacent LSEC, termed intracellular crawling (step 6). Release of chemotactic factors from activated hepatic stellate cells promotes subsequent migration and positioning in liver tissue (step 7).
