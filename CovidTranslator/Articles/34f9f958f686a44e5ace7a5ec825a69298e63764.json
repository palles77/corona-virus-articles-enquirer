Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is a major enteric pathogen of the coronavirus family that causes extensive mortality among piglets. The involvement of p53 during PEDV infection has not previously been investigated. In this study, we detected p53 upregulation in response to PEDV infection. Treatment with a p53 specific activator or p53 overexpression markedly decreased viral replication, and we showed that there was more viral progeny produced in p53 knock-out cells than in p53 wild-type cells. Finally, we demonstrated that inhibition of viral infection by p53 was mediated via p53-dependent IFN signaling, leading to IFN-stimulated response element (ISRE) activation, as well as the upregulation of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) and IFN-\u03b2 released from infected cells. These findings demonstrate that p53 suppresses PEDV infection, offering a novel therapeutic strategy for combatting this deadly disease in piglets. as a central regulator of the innate immune response (Rivas et al., https://doi.",

PED was first identified in the 1970s in England, but it has become more prominent and lethal in Asia over the past decade, devastating local economies (Wood, 1977; Zhou et al., 2012) . This disease is caused by the coronavirus porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) (Lee, 2015) . This virus is a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus with an envelope and a 28,000 bp genome encoding a total of 7 known open reading frames (ORFs): replicase polyproteins 1a and 1b, ORF3, spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) (Duarte et al., 1993) . Accumulated evidence indicates that PEDV could manipulate the immune responses of its hosts to benefit its own replication. Sun et al. reported that the CH/SXYL/ 2016 strain of PEDV could cause cell cycle arrest in Vero cells at the G0/G1 phase, and synchronization of the cells at the G0/G1 phase could increase the proportion of infected cells (Sun et al., 2018) ; the same results were also observed in transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV)-infected PK-15 cells . In addition, an increasing number of studies have demonstrated that viruses encode defensive mechanisms to evade the antiviral activities of host cells (Xing et al., 2013; Yang et al., 2018) . However, hosts have many mechanisms aimed at detecting and disrupting PEDV replication and spread (Cao et al., 2015; Kong et al., 2016) . An improved understanding of how this pathogen interacts with the host immune system is required to enhance efforts to control PEDV spread and to develop efficacious PEDV vaccines.",

Induction of p53 can trigger responses such as DNA repair, cell cycle arrest, or even cell death (Sherr, 2004; Vogelstein et al., 2000) . p53 is hence termed the \"guardian of the genome\". p53 has now also been described 2010). It was also reported that p53 can activate ISGs, thereby giving it the ability to amplify the intracellular interferon (IFN) response (Mu\u00f1oz-Fontela et al., 2011; Takaoka et al., 2003) . However, exactly what if any role is played by p53 during PEDV infection is unknown. In this study, we reveal that there is a direct role for p53 in mediating host innate immune responses to PEDV infection.",

Vero cells are the most common cell line used to study PEDV infection (Jarvis et al., 2016) . Vero cells, however, do not produce type I IFN when infected with viruses due to loss of the type I IFN gene cluster (Desmyter et al., 1968; Emeny and Morgan, 1979) .

SgRNA158 and sgRNA334 were targeted to the N-terminal domain of p53 ( Fig. 2A) . GFP-positive cells were selected by FACS sorting and were propagated prior to Western blot analysis.

After treatment with increasing doses of Nutlin-3 for 24 h, HEK293 cells were infected with PEDV (MOI = 1), and the infection was confirmed by IFA detection of PEDV spike (S) protein. The results showed that Nutlin-3 pretreatment potently inhibited PEDV replication compared with the DMSO treatment. Additionally, 10 \u03bcM Nutlin-3 resulted in more than 60% inhibition of PEDV infection (Fig. 3A) . Levels of PEDV-N proteins were additionally assessed by Western blot, further confirming the inhibition of PEDV replication by Nutlin-3 (Fig. 3B) . Next, the effect of Nutlin-3 on PEDV replication was examined via assessment of the TCID50. This examination confirmed lower viral yields in the Nutlin-3 treated HEK293 cells relative to the control cells (Fig. 3C ). Finally, we tested whether overexpression of p53 in HEK293 cells would reduce how readily these cells could be infected by PEDV, transfecting cells with various doses of His-tag p53 and then infecting them with mock or PEDV. The Western blot results demonstrated that PEDV infectivity in p53 overexpressing HEK293 cells was significantly Immunofluorescent anti-PEDV spike (S) staining was used to assess infected cell frequency. The number of PEDV-positive cells was calculated by using ImageJ software. In (B) and (C), HEK293 cells were treated with Nutlin-3 or DMSO for 24 h and infected with PEDV at an MOI of 1 in the presence of drug for 48 h. p53 and PEDV-N levels were assessed via Western blotting (B), and viral titers were measured in supernatants (C). (D) HEK293 cells transfected with pHis-p53 or empty vector were infected with PEDV (MOI = 1). Twenty-four hours after infection, His-p53 and PEDV-N expression were examined by Western blot. Data are the means \u00b1 SD of three independent experiments. P-values were estimated with Student's t-tests (***p < 0.05). Z. Hao, et al. Molecular Immunology 108 (2019) 68-74 reduced relative to that in parental controls (Fig. 3D ). This demonstrated that p53 expression reduces target susceptibility to PEDV infection, suggesting that p53 acts as a major antiviral mediator during PEDV infection.",

However, p53 is also vital for the type I IFN response upon viral infection. To assess whether p53 plays an IFN signaling-dependent role in the control of PEDV infection, we assessed the ability of p53 to induce interferon-stimulated response element (ISRE) transcription. The pISRE-Luc vector was used to transfect wild-type and p53 knock-out HEK293 cells with an ISRE-luciferase reporter construct, and cells were infected with PEDV for 24 h, after which luciferase activity was measured. Although PEDV infection significantly activated ISRE in p53 wild-type cells, this activation was substantially reduced in p53 knockout cells (Fig. 4A) . Indeed, there was an over 6-fold increase in ISRE transactivation upon PEDV infection in wild-type p53 cells relative to that in p53 knock-out cells. To determine whether ISRE-dependent ISGs were involved in p53 antiviral function, we infected wild-type and p53 knock-out cells with PEDV and assessed ISG expression at the RNA level. The basal transcript levels of RIG-I, IRF-9, ISG56, PKR, MxA, OAS-1 and IFN-\u03b2 were significantly upregulated in p53 wild-type HEK293 cells relative to those in p53 knock-out HEK293 cells (Fig. 4B) . We next explored how p53 affects IFN-\u03b2 secretion by infected cells. Supernatants from p53 wild-type cells had greater amounts of IFN-\u03b2 upon PEDV infection relative to those from p53 knock-out cells. This observation confirmed the p53-dependent secretion of IFNs during PEDV infection (Fig. 4C ). Taken together, these results demonstrate the mechanism by which p53 enhances IFN signaling and secretion of IFN-\u03b2 during PEDV infection.",

The genome of PEDV contains many genes that act to subvert host innate immunity . Moreover, upon virus infection, the host must have a quick response to the invading virus to avoid infection and prevent viral transmission to nearby cells. By better understanding the host responses important for the control of viruses such as PEDV, it may be possible to better design therapies aimed at PEDV control. In this study, we revealed a role for the tumor suppressor protein p53 as a regulator of PEDV infection, with multiple experiments highlighting the contribution of this gene to viral control.",

            "text": "Previous studies have suggested links between p53 and the IFN antiviral signaling system (Takaoka et al., 2003) . p53 can help perpetuate IFN signaling via ISG-dependent positive feedback loops that contribute to robust antiviral immunity (Miciak and Bunz, 2016) . Our present study demonstrates that p53 contributes to the activation of ISREs and ISG expression during PEDV infection. Moreover, we found that p53 increased both IFN signaling and secretion during PEDV infection, further perpetuating an effective antiviral state in HEK293 cells. Together, these findings suggest a clear link between p53 and IFN signaling during PEDV infection, with this gene modulating IFN-dependent defense mechanisms. Viral infection has the potential to affect myriad signaling pathways, including that of p53, which plays an important role in the antiviral response. A previous report showed that p53 inhibits HIV-1 transcript elongation by disrupting phosphorylation of serine 2 of the pol II CTD, which impairs HIV-1 transcription and replication (Mukerjee et al., 2010) . Influenza virus-infected A549 cells trigger the activation of the p53 pathway leading to apoptosis, and blocking p53 increases viral titers (Turpin et al., 2005) . Similarly, in this study, we observed that PEDV infection enhanced p53 expression in HEK293 cells at 6-24 hpi but not after 48 hpi. This observation suggests that PEDV could antagonize the p53 antiviral response by some unknown mechanism. Some reports indicate that coronavirus papain-like proteinase (PLP) can adversely impact p53 stability via increasing its ubiquitination and consequent export from the nucleus (Yuan et al., 2015) . The precise molecular mechanism through which PEDV viral proteins regulate p53 degradation requires further investigation. Taking our findings together, we conclude that p53 was activated early during PEDV infection to promote antiviral functions, but it was degraded at later stages of infection by PEDV to benefit the replication of the virus.",
