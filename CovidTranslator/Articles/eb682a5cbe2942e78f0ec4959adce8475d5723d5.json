The school includes students of Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal backgrounds drawn from the local town and surrounding First Nations reserves. Because A(H1N1)pdm09 had recently emerged in mid-April as a novel virus and in order to characterize its transmission, clinical profile, risk factors, and impact, an outbreak investigation was organized by public health authorities through household telephone survey between May 15 and June 5, 2009 . Initial findings from this investigation have previously been published. 1 Of note, this outbreak investigation provided first detection of an association between prior 2008-2009 trivalent influenza vaccine (TIV) receipt and A(H1N1)pdm09 risk that was subsequently confirmed in at least four other studies conducted during the summer, 2009 in Canada. 2 In this paper, we report additional epidemiologic features of influenza-like illness (ILI) experience during this outbreak including characteristics such as medical care, risk factors, and duration of illness both on-and off-reserve. As a further main objective, we evaluate transmission patterns such as the household secondary attack rate (SAR) and serial interval (SI: interval between the index and secondary case), both of which are relevant in planning for and responding to novel influenza virus emergence.",

            "text": "As previously described, 1 an elementary school (school A) in a rural BC community identified a >10% absenteeism rate owing to respiratory illness among students. Local health authorities were notified on April 28, 2009 , and nasopharyngeal specimens confirmed A(H1N1)pdm09 as the cause on May 3, 2009 . The school was closed on May 1, 2009 and re-opened May 11, 2009. To characterize clinical and epidemiologic features of A(H1N1)pdm09 illness and spread in the community, a telephone survey of households with at least one child enrolled in any of the community schools was conducted May 15 through June 5, 2009. Among consenting households, an adult respondent provided information about household characteristics and illness among all household members. Household information included the number of household members and sleeping rooms, self-identification as Aboriginal \u2044 non-Aboriginal, and among Aboriginal participants residency on-\u2044 off-reserve. Individual-level information included age, flu-like symptoms and related dates of onset, days spent in bed, health care visits, comorbidity (corresponding to high-risk categories specified by the National Advisory Committee on Immunization), and receipt of 2008-2009 and \u2044 or 2007-2008 TIV. 3 To validate clinical case definitions, households with at least one member reporting ILI (fever and cough plus \u20211 of headache, general aches, sore throat, and \u2044 or prostration since April 1, 2009) were subsequently invited to provide blood specimens from both symptomatic and asymptomatic household members. Antibody response to A(H1N1)pdm09 was measured by the hemagglutination inhibition and micro-neutralization assays according to procedures described earlier. 1 As previously described, 1 serology and RT-PCR testing indicated that the outbreak was mainly confined to households of the initially affected school A and among Aboriginal people who lived onreserve in the surrounding community. Thus, analysis of A(H1N1)pdm09 clinical and epidemiologic features was restricted to elementary school and on-reserve participants. 1",

For these analyses, we considered two scenarios where both index and secondary case had ILI (no. of pairs = 15) and where index case was laboratory-confirmed and the secondary case had ILI (no. of pairs = 6). We assumed that transmission was possible only if the delay between symptom onset of the index case (infector) and of the secondary case (infectee) in the household was \u20211 day. Thus, according to this assumption, it is not possible for both the index and secondary case to start symptoms on the same day. We fit Weibull, gamma, log-normal, and log-logistic parametric models to the number of days, and the Weibull model achieved the lowest Akaike information criterion (AIC) of these distributions. From the Weibull distribution, we computed median serial interval and its 95% confidence interval (CI).",

We capitalized on a discrete, intense but community-wide outbreak involving households associated with a first affected school and on-reserve Aboriginal people to estimate epidemiologic characteristics uniquely across age groups and among on-and off-reserve participants. Overall, we identified illness that was mostly mild and self-limited with no hospitalizations or antiviral prescriptions. Young children, those with chronic diseases, and those who previously received the 2008-2009 seasonal influenza vaccine were more likely overall to report A(H1N1)pdm09-related illness. Participants on-reserve were more likely to report comorbidity and greater household crowding; they also reported higher ILI, MAILI, and SARs. Overall, the median interval between symptom onset and care seeking was about 5 days, and median time to recovery was 9 days, both also longer among on-reserve participants. A similarly low proportion (20%) of on-\u2044 offreserve participants sought care within 48 hours; access to health care services in the region is generally considered comparable both on-\u2044 off-reserve. We identified a very short median SI of about 3 days, suggesting a brief period to intervene in prevention and control.",

Other studies based on surveillance data may have underestimated the actual duration owing to right censoring and a mix of patients who used antivirals and those who did not. 10, 11 As in our investigation, the preponderance of epidemiological and immunological data support an age-related pattern of A(H1N1)pdm09 risk. 9,13-16 People with comorbidities were more likely to report ILI in our study but whether this reflects a greater tendency to recognize and declare illness (reporting bias) versus a greater risk of acquiring infection is uncertain; comorbidity has also been reported to be associated with higher risk of more severe disease.

In our study, the overall SAR was 22%, higher in those age <1 year (38%) and 1-4 years (50%). There is a wide variation in report of SAR from various settings, which is not unexpected. Our estimates are similar to household transmission studies in Germany (26%), 12 Kenya (26%), 20 and the United States (18%). 8 These estimates were slightly lower than other studies in Canada (Sikora C et al: 30%; Papenburg J et al: any ILI: 29%, laboratory-confirmed A(H1N1)pdm09 ILI: 26%, and laboratory-confirmed A(H1N1)pdm09 including asymptomatic infections: 45%) 15,21 and the United States (27AE3%). 22 Conversely, our estimates are higher than others reported from Japan (7AE6%), 23 UK (17%), 24 and United States (4-13%; 11%; 14AE3%). 9, 16, 25 Many factors affect transmission and hence SAR within households including age, antiviral use, and ascertainment of index and secondary cases or contacts, as well as socio-environmental factors such as climate, crowding, and control behaviors such as the use of masks and hand washing. The initiation of treatment for the index case upon illness onset or the following day was associated with a 42% reduction in secondary infections in households in a Japanese study. 26 In the study by Morgan et al. 16 (SAR: 4-13%), most of the index cases (72%) had received treatment. In the New York school household transmission study (SAR: 11%), about one quarter (26%) of index cases took antiviral treatment and 71% started within 2 days of illness onset. 9 About 7% of the household contacts also received antiviral prophylaxis. In the Suess et al. 12 study, SAR among those who did not receive prophylaxis was 26%, very close to our own measured rate. Reduced virus shedding with antiviral treatment for seasonal and A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses has been reported. 13, 27, 28 Thus, differences in SAR may also in part be attributed to variation in antiviral use. The pattern we found of higher SAR among children than adults (highest in 0-4 and lowest in \u202150 years) is also consistent with other studies. 9, 15, 16 A higher SAR among children may be explained by differences in cross-protective innate or acquired immunity as well as contact and hygiene patterns. 22, 29 The spread of an infection is determined by the average number of secondary cases generated by an infectious case. This number is called the basic reproductive number (R 0 ) when the population is completely susceptible and the effective reproductive number (R) when the population is partially immune. The serial interval is an important parameter as it affects the estimation of R 0 . 30 It also determines the rate of growth of an epidemic (R \u2044 serial interval): for a given reproductive number (R), an epidemic will grow faster with a shorter serial interval. 31 These two parameters together are also useful in evaluating the impact of interventions employed to control the outbreak. Thus, estimating the serial interval is important in responding to a novel pathogen such as A(H1N1)pdm09 and convergence of estimates from several sources and settings lends credibility to the measure overall.",

The study relied upon a non-specific clinical outcome (ILI) for defining A(H1N1)pdm09-related illness. There are many causes of ILI as evidenced by other contributing viruses identified through passive surveillance during the study period (see prior publication). 1 Other respiratory viruses detected from the local community during that period included coronavirus and rhinovi-rus \u2044 enterovirus. We thus attempted to validate the ILI case definition based on A(H1N1)pdm09 sero-positive status and used that to define the study population, but participation in the sero-survey was self-selected and sample size was small. Secondly, we relied on report by one adult for all household members. ILI experience, duration of illness, and TIV history may have been less well known for other household members. Thirdly, sample size was small with large confidence intervals especially for stratified analyses. In comparing school A and on-reserve households, we identified some overlap including 36 of 191 on-reserve participants who also attended school A. To address this, we separately presented estimates for school A participants with and without on-reserve residency but this further reduced sample size, introducing variability.",

Young children and those with comorbidities were at higher risk of illness and those living on-reserve tended also to have higher ILI, MAILI, and SAR. The reasons for this warrant better understanding. Like others, we identified a short serial interval suggesting a narrow period to prevent transmission. These early features of the first wave of the 2009 pandemic should also be considered in preparing for emergence of the next novel influenza virus.",
